###Chapter 1

My best friend suggested testing my boyfriend with a fake account.

After I agreed, I created a secondary account and told her it was my boyfriend’s.

She added it and immediately started slandering me, claiming I was dating multiple people and had been used by everyone.

She spammed the chat with revealing photos—low-cut tops, exposed legs, pouty poses in skimpy outfits.

"Hey there, wanna hang out?"

"I’m very obedient. You can play with me any way you like."

I replied, "I don’t believe you. Unless you…"

The next day, during a company meeting, she was rushed away by an ambulance after a foreign object inside her began vibrating intensely.
----------
After my boyfriend proposed, my best friend Mia Lowell seemed upset.

Was she worried I might get hurt?

But my boyfriend isn’t just tall and handsome—he’s well-educated, comes from a good family, and is completely devoted to me. There’s really no flaw to find.

Or was she concerned that after marriage, I’d have less time for her?

I even tried to reassure her. "Liam does love traveling the world with me, but don’t worry—I’ll bring you back souvenirs from every place we visit."

Unexpectedly, that seemed to make her even angrier.

No matter how I tried to smooth things over, it didn’t work. Growing impatient, I asked her what was really going on.

Mia has been my closest friend since elementary school.

She’s been there for almost every important moment of my life. I didn’t want her to have any unspoken reservations about my marriage or my fiancé.

Mia fidgeted, hesitating before she finally spoke. "Olivia, I’m still a little unsure about Liam. Don’t you think deciding to marry him is a bit rushed?"

My heart sank. Had Liam done something to hurt me?

Seeing my reaction, she quickly backtracked. "It’s just a reasonable doubt, you know? Think about it—what man can resist temptation? Especially someone like Liam, who’s so attractive. He’s always had girls chasing after him. Why would he be so devoted to you? You’re… decent, I guess."

I frowned. What was she implying? That I wasn’t good enough for my boyfriend?

Mia hurriedly added, "What I mean is, marriage is a lifelong commitment. It’s better to be absolutely sure about someone’s character before making a decision."

"What if he shows his true colors after marriage—cheating, domestic violence? Your whole life could be ruined."

Hesitantly, I asked, "So what do you suggest?"

Her eyes lit up. She took my hand and said, "Give me your boyfriend’s contact info. I’ll create a fake account and test him. If he can resist temptation, then his character is solid. Only then will I feel comfortable entrusting you to him."

I immediately felt uneasy about this. It clearly showed a lack of trust in Liam, and it wasn’t how I operated.

But Mia kept insisting. I finally told her I needed time to think about it and would give her an answer later.

Back home, I thought it over and decided to be honest with Liam. Marriage should be built on transparency. Instead of secretly testing him, it was better to address any concerns directly. If there were issues, we could deal with them early. No big deal.

I nervously explained the situation, expecting Liam to be angry. Instead, he laughed and ruffled my hair.

"Are you sure she’s your best friend? Sounds more like a frenemy trying to steal your man. Her intentions are so obvious—what a schemer."

I pushed his hand away, annoyed. "How can you say that? We’ve been friends for over a decade. You think she’d betray me over a guy?"

Liam seemed to hold back his words, then suggested, "Here’s an idea. Create a fake account yourself. Give it to her and tell her it’s mine. Then see how she ‘tests’ me."

Just then, Mia texted me again, pressing for Liam’s contact info.

I decided to go along with it.

I created the fake account and sent it to her.

A second later, I received a friend request. "Hi there, handsome."

Thinking about how Liam would respond, I replied, "Who is this?"

She answered instantly, "Who I am doesn’t matter. What matters is whether you know your girlfriend is cheating on you with multiple guys and making you the fallback option."
###Chapter 2

I stared at my phone screen in disbelief.

Was this how Mia Lowell was testing my boyfriend? By throwing dirt on me right from the start?

I took several deep breaths, steadying my trembling hands, and quickly typed: "What do you mean? What about my girlfriend?"

Mia immediately sent a hugging emoji and replied: "You've been deceived by her. Don't be fooled by her innocent appearance. She was actually a well-known party girl in college, dating several guys at once. Her reputation was already ruined."

"For thrills, she specifically sought out international students of African descent. Many classmates saw her going to hotels with several of them at the same time."

"There was a period when she suffered from gynecological issues. She had growths down there. Eww~ so disgusting. It took her a long time to get treated and recover."

"I know you're about to marry her, but I really can't bear to see a decent and kind person like you being tricked by such a woman."

She then sent a series of kissing emojis.

So this was my dear best friend. Under the guise of caring for me, she was viciously spreading rumors about me behind my back!

I was instantly furious, but forced myself to stay calm and replied: "Do you have any evidence for these things? Don't spread baseless rumors."

Mia continued to fan the flames: "I have photos and chat logs from her college days. Do you want to see them?"

How was this possible?!

Before I could ask further, she immediately dumped a pile of chat records and photos.

I opened them. They actually looked real!

But these chat logs had been intentionally altered and spliced together. Many were just nonsense posted under my profile picture.

The so-called photos were from when I participated in the university's international student program, group photos with the international students.

Packaged by Mia like this, along with her detailed and plausible stories complete with times and locations, if sent to someone else, it might actually be convincing.

After all, with such ironclad evidence presented, who wouldn't believe it?

Extreme anger gave way to sorrow and pain. So I was the clown all along.

I had been so good to her. I shared every good thing and every piece of good news with her first. I stood by her unconditionally through everything.

Why? Why would she do this to me?

The next second, I knew the answer.

Mia seemed to give "Liam Evans" three minutes to process, then continued:

"I know you and your girlfriend, and I'm aware of her hidden past. I completely understand how you must be feeling right now."

"A trashy woman like her doesn't deserve you at all. You treat her so well, yet she doesn't appreciate it."

Then she shifted gears: "Hey, what about me? I've been quietly paying attention to you all along. My heart aches for you."

"If I had an outstanding boyfriend like you, I would never ever cheat. I would definitely cherish you properly."

Hahaha...

I laughed out loud in anger at this sudden confession. So that was it.

Liam had been right. She really was trying to steal him from me.

To push "Liam" into making a quick decision, she even sent several revealing, sexy photos—low-cut, showing legs, arched backs—all without faces. They came with captions:

"I know you're hurting. Come out and relax. Stop thinking about that trashy woman."

Liam saw my pale face and labored breathing. He quickly took the phone away, urging me to calm down, and raised his hand to swear: "I would never be interested in a two-faced person like Mia Lowell. You're the only one I love, baby."

"Please don't waste your anger on such garbage."

"It's good that we've seen her true colors. Let's just cut her out of our lives from now on. Out of sight, out of mind."

I curled my lips and patted Liam. "How can that be? She's coming after me directly. You think I'll just let her take a bite out of me for free?"

I thought for a moment, then replied: "Who are you? Why should I believe what a stranger says?"

The reply came instantly: "You'll find out when we meet. It'll be a total surprise."
###Chapter 3

For the next several days, I continued playing the heartbroken Liam Evans on the chat app, occasionally exchanging messages with Mia Lowell but never agreeing to break up.

Mia grew impatient, her words becoming bolder and more direct. "Hey there, wanna meet up?"

"I'm very obedient. I'm up for anything."

"Don't worry, I'll keep it completely secret. Your girlfriend will never know. I'll be your good little secret lover."

Meanwhile, she also probed me for information about my recent relationship with Liam.

I pretended to be deeply despondent, "confiding" in her. "I don't know what's wrong with Liam lately. He's been acting so strange."

"He seems upset about something, but he won't tell me why. He's been avoiding me too. We barely exchange a few words all day."

"He won't even let me near his phone. He's always typing away mysteriously, like he's chatting with someone else."

I suddenly had an idea and grabbed Mia's hand. "Didn't you say you were going to test him? Did you find anything wrong?"

I studied her face carefully. A flicker of panic crossed Mia's eyes, mixed with a hint of smugness.

She laughed, covering her mouth to hide her expression. "No, not at all. Liam was perfectly behaved. You shouldn't suspect him without reason. Maybe he's just stressed about something else. Give him some space."

That evening, Mia immediately escalated her efforts. She sent several extremely explicit, nearly nude photos, accompanied by boldly provocative messages.

Fighting back disgust, I saved all the chat logs and images. I replied to her.

"We've been talking for a while now. You need to show me you're serious. How else can I believe you really like me?"

Seeing an opportunity, Mia immediately asked what she could do to prove her sincerity.

I narrowed my eyes and licked my lips. "To be honest, I like girls who are wild. That makes things more exciting."

"But my girlfriend looks so innocent, yet she's secretly so promiscuous. I find that dirty."

"You understand, right? I want a girl who's only slutty for me. Someone who's up for anything."

Mia declared she was exactly that person, with very high limits, and assured me she was clean with no questionable past.

Given that, I gave her the first task through the chat. "You little slut. Are you that desperate for a man?"

"Fine. Give me your address. I'll send you something. You'll do exactly as I say."

"If you can manage it, I'll agree to meet you."

I sent Mia an upgraded vibrator. High-intensity, oversized, guaranteed maximum pleasure.

She sent me a photo as soon as she received it, teasing me for looking so proper while secretly being into such things.

I instructed her. "Take this to the office tomorrow. Insert it. Then send me a picture."

The next day, I arrived at the office and ran into Mia.

She walked with an awkward gait, biting her lip hard, her face flushed.

I "helpfully" stepped forward and gave her backside a firm pat, asking if she was feeling unwell.

Mia shuddered, a moan escaping her lips, drawing glances from nearby colleagues.

She quickly grabbed my hand, claiming she’d thrown out her back yesterday and telling me not to touch her.

I asked with feigned concern. "The big meeting is today. All the senior management will be there. You have to present the project. Will you be okay?"

Mia nodded vigorously, gritting her teeth against the discomfort. She said goodbye, claiming she needed to prepare.

Soon, my phone buzzed. Mia had sent another extremely explicit, blood-boiling photo with a caption.

"I've been a good girl, Master. I followed your instructions perfectly."

I smirked, fingering the remote control in my pocket.

I wondered if Mia would still be this obedient when she was on stage presenting, once I turned that remote to its highest setting.
###Chapter 4
"Good morning, everyone. I'm Mia Lowell from the project department. It's a great honor to have this opportunity to present the progress of our current project..."

Mia stood confidently on the stage, speaking with ease.

My colleague Chloe Watson, sitting beside me, leaned in and whispered, "Olivia, what a shame. This project was originally yours. You should be the one up there right now."

"If you hadn't been so kind-hearted and handed the project over to Mia, she wouldn't be enjoying this moment in the spotlight."

"And you have no idea what she says about you behind your back. You consider her your best friend, but she's probably just using you as a stepping stone!"

I patted Chloe's hand, signaling that we were surrounded by people and should be careful with our words.

Chloe looked at me with frustration, as if I were a hopeless case, and let out an exasperated sigh.

I watched Mia, radiant and full of confidence on stage, and inwardly sneered. I had been foolish before.

After the manager assigned the project to me, Mia came to me, begging for help.

"Olivia, please let me take this project. It doesn't matter much to you anyway, but if I don't achieve something soon, I'll really be fired."

"You're my best friend. You wouldn't just stand by and watch me fail, would you?"

I couldn't quite describe how I felt at that moment, only that my chest felt tight.

My achievements, my bonuses, and the recognition from leadership were all earned through my own hard work.

While I was staying up late working on proposals, Mia was out shopping.

While I was running myself ragged trying to secure a deal with a client, Mia was browsing online stores and playing games.

How could she just casually say, "You're the best," and take away everything I deserved?

But in the end, for the sake of friendship, I gave in.

Like an idiot.

To get the leadership to agree, I even promised to assist Mia from the sidelines to ensure the project's successful completion.

But I never expected that after giving an inch, Mia would take a mile.

She dumped the entire project on me, claiming it was because she "believed in my abilities" and that I was "such a good friend."

As a result, I was the one staying up late working on the project.

I wrote the script.

Even the PowerPoint presentation was done by me because Mia claimed she couldn't figure it out.

Now she stood on stage, full of confidence, reading the script with dramatic flair, earning praise from the leaders in the audience.

It was time to expose her true colors.

I reached into my pocket and turned on the vibrator to its lowest setting while keeping my eyes fixed on Mia on stage.

Mia was just mentioning the project's investment amount. "The initial investment for this project totals 18 million... ah~ mm~ dollars!"

Her voice suddenly cracked, followed by a series of moans.

She clenched her lips tightly, one hand pressed firmly between her legs, the other gripping the podium, barely managing to stay upright.

Her face was flushed, her eyes darting wildly, and her entire body trembled.

The audience was bewildered. What was happening?

Chloe, always blunt, muttered, "Oh my god, is it what I think it is? Mia looks like she's..."

"Is she getting turned on by reading the script?"

Instantly, whispers filled the room.

Even those who had been dozing off were now wide awake, watching Mia with keen interest.

Mia seemed flustered.

She took a deep breath, trying to compose herself, and continued her presentation.

Did she really think I would let her off that easily?

I turned the vibrator to medium intensity.

"Oh~ ah~ ah!" Mia's voice suddenly rose sharply.

She collapsed to the floor, her thighs twisting and turning uncontrollably.

She looked... utterly overwhelmed with pleasure.

The senior executive frowned deeply. "What's wrong with this colleague? If you're unwell, take leave and go home to rest. We can reschedule the project presentation."

Mia shook her head repeatedly.

This was a rare opportunity to shine, and she didn't want to miss it. "No, no, I'm fine! I can continue!"

The audience erupted in murmurs.

Many pulled out their phones to record, eager to witness the drama.

Seasoned observers chuckled and whispered among themselves. "Mia looks like she's in the middle of... you know."

"Wow, really? She has the nerve to put on a show in front of so many people? What kind of weird fetish is this?"

"No mistake about it. Based on my years of experience, she's definitely..."

To prove herself, Mia struggled to get up from the floor, determined to continue her report to the leadership.

I turned the vibrator to its highest setting instantly.

"Mr. Anderson, ah ah ah ah ah ah!" Mia suddenly screamed, her eyes rolling back, her entire body convulsing like a fish stranded on shore, thrashing desperately.

"Mmm, oh oh oh, Mr. Anderson, ah ah ah~"

Mr. Anderson's face turned green.

Hearing his name being moaned like that was utterly embarrassing for a man of his age.

The next second, Mr. Anderson, sitting in the front row, stared in disbelief and pointed at the podium. "She... she wet herself!"

Upon hearing this, Mia finally passed out.
###Chapter 5

An employee having an incident at the office was no small matter.

The manager immediately dialed for an ambulance.

Paramedics arrived quickly and prepared to lift Mia onto a stretcher.

Just as they moved her, a large object slid out from between her legs.

She wasn't even wearing underwear. She was completely exposed!

Even the experienced paramedic froze.

Wearing rubber gloves, he tremblingly held up the wet object.

"Is this... belonging to the young lady on the floor?"

It had slid right out of her body. Of course it was hers.

This scandal fed the entire company's gossip mill.

The manager, fearing further trouble, assigned a colleague to accompany her to the hospital.

Before Mia even regained consciousness that day, hundreds of employees knew.

Mia Lowell had used a vibrator during a company meeting.

She had pleasured herself into oblivion and ended up in the hospital.

Instantly, Mia became infamous. She earned the nickname "The Vibrator Queen."

"I never would have guessed. I thought Mia was such a good girl. I didn't know she played so wildly in private."

"Oh please, this wasn't private play. This was out in the open."

"Do you think she was doing a task for her 'Master'? Otherwise, it's just too perverse."

...

Some busybody, knowing my connection to Mia, pressed me for inside information.

I just shrugged. I said a girlfriend's private life is her own business. I didn't dare ask too many questions.

Mia had botched the project.

She had also performed a rated-R show for the entire company. She made a deep impression on the managers.

She received a major disciplinary warning.

Any further inappropriate behavior would result in immediate termination.

Mia came to work the next day wearing huge sunglasses and a hat pulled low. She moved furtively.

I spotted her immediately.

I called out loudly to her retreating back. "Mia! Are you feeling better?"

"I saved the vibrator you left on the stage. I put it in your desk drawer."

"Please be more careful with that thing next time! The current was too strong. It's dangerous!"

Mia stumbled, nearly falling.

Snickers erupted around her.

The pointing fingers and knowing looks made her burn with shame. She fled in humiliation.

Back at my desk, my burner phone immediately received a message from Mia.

"Master, you've ruined me!"

"I did what you said. I put that thing inside me. But who told you to turn it to the highest setting?"

"You made me pass out on stage! I was sent to the hospital! The whole company is laughing at me!"

"Wahhh! I don't want to live anymore!"

I smirked. Then go die.

Still putting on this innocent act with me.

She kept messaging. "I don't care! I sacrificed so much for you! I want compensation!"

I thought for a moment, then replied. "You were so obedient. It really turns me on."

"This Saturday night. Room 308, the XXX Hotel. Get cleaned up and wait for me."

"You little slut. I'm going to find out who you really are."

Mia was clearly thrilled.

She instantly forgot about her humiliation.

She agreed immediately. She even said she had a surprise for me.

I didn't know about any surprise. But a shock was definitely coming.

Because Saturday was our high school reunion.

It was being held in the banquet hall on the third floor of the XXX Hotel.
###Chapter 6

After I embarrassed Mia Lowell at the company, she gave me the cold shoulder for three whole days.

She probably wanted to show off later, having already hooked up with Liam Evans.

She came back to fish for information, asking how things were going between Liam and me lately.

Perfect timing.

I "kindly" reminded her about the class reunion on Saturday and told her not to forget.

She calculated the date and quickly shook her head.

"I have an important date that day. I won't be going."

"You have a good time with our old classmates."

I frowned appropriately and sighed.

"You're just like Liam. He originally promised to go with me, but he stood me up last minute too."

"He said he has to entertain some important client all night."

"Pfft. What client is more important than his girlfriend?"

Mia was utterly pleased.

She licked her lips.

"Men focusing on their careers is a good thing."

"Maybe his client is really a heavyweight."

"They probably have a lot to discuss, with some drinks, conversation, and maybe even some... sparring."

She was there daydreaming, her eyes glazed over.

She clearly didn't notice the location I mentioned for the class reunion was the exact same hotel they had agreed to meet at.

On the day of the reunion, the old classmates met and chatted animatedly.

I sat alone in a corner, chatting with Mia on a secondary account.

She said she had already arrived at the hotel and had prepared her "battle attire" for this meeting.

Just then, a few female classmates came over.

They exchanged glances and asked me why Mia wasn't here, since she was usually attached to my hip.

I was about to answer.

One of the female classmates suddenly spoke up.

"Olivia, I think you should stop hanging out with Mia Lowell."

"She might not genuinely want to be your friend."

My heart tightened.

Did they know something?

Starting from high school, I don't know exactly when, I was inexplicably isolated.

My classmates held a lot of hostility towards me.

No one would talk to me or hang out with me.

Only Mia stayed by my side.

So, deep down, no matter how far Mia went, I was willing to forgive her.

After all, during my teenage years, she was the only one who stayed with me.

It wasn't until she used despicable means to spread rumors about me and stole my boyfriend that I realized Mia never saw me as a friend.

She was just trampling on my friendship, treating me like a wishful-thinking fool.

Seeing my confusion, the female classmate laid it out plainly.

"Back in school, we all wanted to be friends with you."

"You were quiet, seemed nice, and had good grades."

"But Mia told us privately that in middle school, you bullied a female classmate so badly she became depressed and dropped out."

"That's why we stayed away from you and didn't want to get involved."

"Mia even cried to us, saying you were vicious and domineering."

"She said if she didn't stay by your side as your friend, you would bully her just like you did to that middle school classmate."

...

I clenched my fists tightly.

The flames of anger almost burned through my rationality.

It was because of this?

So this was the reason!

The colorful teenage years I should have had were cast in gray early on, all because of my best friend.

How much did she actually hate me?
###Chapter 7

Mia Lowell had an abusive, alcoholic father.
A mother addicted to mahjong and gambling.
And a good-for-nothing delinquent older brother.
Her family life had always been miserable.
So miserable that I couldn't bear to watch.
I shared half my allowance with her.
Gave her the new clothes I bought.
Let her use my meal card freely.
I sheltered her unconditionally whenever she got hurt.

Was it all just one-sided giving from me?
Did I raise a ungrateful snake?

The female classmate saw me frozen in place.
She looked at me with concern.
"I'm really sorry," she said.
"We were young back then."
"Mia said something, and we believed her."
"We never confronted you directly."
"We wronged you."

"Later, I met your junior high classmate."
"That's when I found out you're a good person."
"You've always been kind to everyone."
"Mia lied to us."
"I'm sorry we didn't believe you then."
"I'm sorry we didn't speak up for you."

Tears welled up in my eyes.
What use was this belated apology?
Those days were gone forever.

All that was left now was an eye for an eye.
A tooth for a tooth.

Coincidentally, Mia texted me.
"Big brother, I'm all cleaned up."
"I'm dressed exactly how you like tonight."
"Hurry up and come to the room."

I smirked coldly and replied.
"Sweetheart, I have a surprise for you too."

I quickly made a phone call.
I gave some brief instructions.
I took a deep breath and settled in to watch the show.

Soon, screams and angry shouts echoed from the lobby.

An excited male classmate yelled to the group.
"Whoa, everyone, come quick!"
"There's a show outside!"
"A wife caught her husband's mistress at the hotel!"

"I took a quick peek at the door."
"The mistress has her hair all disheveled."
"The wife is on top of her, hitting her."
"She's wearing lingerie."
"Not a single one of the three points is covered!"

Who could resist that?

Everyone rushed out of the hall and ran toward the scene.

"You wretched woman!"
"How dare you seduce my man!"
"He's over fifty years old!"
"Who knows if he can even get it up!"
"He's bald and covered in fat!"
"How could you even bring yourself to kiss him?"

"What a sin!"
"Are you that desperate for a man?"
"That thirsty?"
"You'll jump on any man you see?"

"How much did he pay you?"
"A few hundred? A few thousand?"
"You dress like this cheap slut?"
"Spreading your legs wide open for him!"

"Why are you covering your face?"
"Let everyone see you, you shameless whore!"

The older woman was incredibly strong.
She grabbed Mia's hair and forced her head up for everyone to see.

The moment Mia looked up, she saw me.
She saw the stunned expressions of all our old classmates.
She instantly broke down.
"Ahhh! No! It's not me! I didn't do it!"

"Don't look at me! Please, don't look at me!"

The older woman slapped her hard across both cheeks.
"Who else could it be if not you?"
"Dressed like that, in a hotel."
"If you're not here to please a man, are you just here to be a slut and put on a performance art show?"

The classmates were just as shocked.
They came for an ordinary reunion.
They never expected to see their former classmate in such a state.

Everyone started talking at once.
"Isn't that Mia Lowell?"
"Why is she dressed like that?"
"Did she switch careers and become a working girl?"

"What do you mean?"
"Didn't you hear? She's a mistress caught in the act."

"Oh my, you really can't judge a book by its cover."
"Who would have thought that famous pure white flower would fall this far."
"Even an old man is good enough for her now."

"The world is going downhill."
"People's hearts aren't what they used to be."

Mia desperately tried to cover herself with her hands.
One moment she covered the top.
The next moment she covered the bottom.
In a panic, she screamed at me.
"Olivia Sullivan, are you just going to stand there?"
"Hurry up and take your clothes off for me to wear!"
###Chapter 8

I clicked my tongue in disapproval.

Pulling out my phone, I snapped pictures of her from every angle without mercy.

"Oh dear, this is the only outfit I have on. If I give it to you, what will I wear? I'm not as bold as you, going commando like this."

Seeing the fury in Mia Lowell's eyes, I quickly added, "Don't worry, I'll find someone to help you."

I took a deep breath and shouted down the empty hallway, "Someone come quick! There's a woman here without any clothes! Is there anyone kind enough to lend her something to wear?"

My loud voice attracted attention from those who hadn't noticed before.

Within moments, dozens of people rushed out to see what was happening.

Their stares burned into Mia like laser beams, pushing her to the brink of collapse.

The older woman who had been confronting Mia received a phone call.

"Oh my, young lady, my apologies. I got the wrong person. My husband's mistress is on the fourth floor, not the third."

She then looked at Mia with disdain. "But dressed like that, you're clearly no saint either. You had it coming."

With that, she dusted off her hands and walked away.

She left Mia lying there exposed for everyone to see.

Finally, Mia struggled to her feet.

Covering her face, she ran back to her room.

She left behind a crowd of curious onlookers.

After tonight, Mia's legend would surely grow.

I was in excellent spirits.

I transferred $70 to the older woman.

Yes, I had specifically hired her for this.

She was thrilled, saying she'd gladly take on such jobs again—venting anger while getting paid was wonderful.

The situation escalated quickly.

Posts about Mia spread rapidly online, with all sorts of claims circulating.

"I know that woman. She's my aunt's daughter-in-law's neighbor. I heard she never wears clothes at home, keeps her curtains wide open, and has even dragged delivery guys inside naked. They were so scared they called the police."

"Ha! That's nothing. My friend is her coworker, and this is reliable info. During a company meeting, she used a vibrator right in front of everyone and ended up in the hospital."

"Oh, I heard about that too. She's hit on almost every man at her company, even the front desk security guards. She's wild—can handle several at once!"

"Latest news: she was caught wearing lingerie while playing BDSM games with her Dom at a hotel. Got beaten up. I even have photos!"

"Really? Kind stranger upstairs, please share!"

"+1"

"+10086"

Though no names were mentioned, those in the know recognized it was Mia.

She had truly become infamous.

Even the company couldn't tolerate it anymore.

They told her to sort out her personal life immediately.

They feared more angry wives would show up to confront mistresses, disrupting the workplace.

Unexpectedly, instead of a wife, Mia's boyfriend appeared.

I was busy working when I heard loud commotion.

A man's angry shouts mixed with a woman's furious screams.

Chloe Watson grabbed my arm, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

"Oh my god, come quick! Mia's boyfriend is here. They're pulling hair and slapping each other!"

Mia had a boyfriend?

I thought she always portrayed herself as a single, wealthy, beautiful woman.
###Chapter 9

I arrived at the scene to find a man holding Mia Lowell's phone and shouting.

"You slut! No wonder you've been ignoring me lately! You're already chasing after someone else!"

"Are you that desperate for a man? You'd do anything he tells you to? Why don't you just die!"

"Inserting vibrators, wearing sexy lingerie—you really know how to play dirty! Back when we were together, you made a fuss just holding hands. Disgusting!"

"I spent over a hundred thousand on you in more than a year, and now some other guy gets to enjoy it? Damn it!"

He turned to his colleagues and yelled. "Come quick! See how Mia Lowell seduces men! She sends one dirty photo after another!"

Mia was terrified, especially when she saw me. She trembled and desperately fought to grab her phone.

She was guilty. If I saw those chat records, her secret would be exposed.

Left with no choice, she swung her purse hard at the man.

"Ouch!" He covered his head and fell to the ground, bleeding.

Mia quickly snatched her phone while he was distracted.

The man pointed at her in disbelief. "You bitch, just wait! I'll sue you until you're bankrupt! I'm not a man if I don't! You'll pay back every penny you spent! If you're short even a dollar, you'll regret it!"

He stumbled away.

Mia was left alone to face the mocking stares of the onlookers.

"What about Mia is even real? Her single status is fake. Her pure and chaste image is fake. Her rich white girl persona is fake. Oh my god, I have goosebumps. I don't dare work with someone like this. Who knows when she might stab me in the back."

"So her using a vibrator wasn't with her boyfriend? Was it a sugar daddy?"

"Look how desperately she guards that phone. There must be something shady in there."

"Hah, probably one sugar daddy isn't enough. She needs several. So insatiable."

...

After this incident, Mia could no longer stay at the company. She was fired that same day.

The worst part was, Mia didn't dare report her ex-boyfriend's harassment or the online bullying to the police. She felt guilty and still had hopes for Liam Evans.

As long as she could cling to Liam, a big tree, all her sacrifices would be worth it.

To settle the matter, Mia forced herself to pay her ex-boyfriend $70,000 to get rid of him.

She even had the nerve to ask me for a loan. "Olivia, you're the best. You wouldn't leave me to die, right? I'm really broke. If this continues, I'll have to eat instant noodles. Please lend me $70,000. No, $55,000 will do. I promise I'll pay you back."

I stared at her and laughed. "If you're that poor, you can still afford instant noodles? One plain steamed bun a day is enough. It's good for losing weight."

"Besides, you dumped your boyfriend for some man behind the scenes. Isn't he helping you?"

"I'm your best friend. Who is this man? Why are you hiding it from even me?"

Mia was initially angry that I refused to lend her money. But when I mentioned the man, she immediately became smug.

She grinned and rolled her eyes at me. "He's a super rich, handsome, and tall CEO. We're almost official. I'll introduce you when the time comes. Don't be too shocked!"

I pressed further. "Why not now?"

She looked at me meaningfully. "He hasn't broken up with his girlfriend yet, but it'll be soon."

"He always complains to me. His girlfriend doesn't know how to have fun like I do. She's not as understanding. She doesn't get him like I do. I am his true soulmate."
###Chapter 10

I pretended to be shocked. "So you're the other woman? You're actually proud of being a mistress? You've got some nerve."

"Seems to me he's just playing with you. He never intended to make it public. You should give up on this fantasy."

Mia panicked and blurted out, "Bullshit! The one who isn't loved is the real mistress. What we have is true love!"

I raised an eyebrow. "True love that tells you to go without underwear and use a vibrator? True love that parades you in lingerie for everyone to see? True love that won't stand up for you when your boyfriend hits you?"

"Wow. Such true love indeed."

Mia choked on her words. She stomped her foot in frustration and ran off.

Later, she sent my burner account several pleading emojis. Unable to resist, she finally asked for money.

"Hey, I'm going through a rough patch right now. Could you lend me some cash? Not much, just fifty thousand dollars."

I replied, "I never thought you'd be like this. I misjudged you!"

Mia sent a question mark.

I launched into a lecture. "I thought you were different—sweet, understanding, not materialistic. I believed you loved me for who I am, not like those gold diggers out there. But you're just after my money too!"

She desperately typed back. "No, that's not true! I really do love you. I'm only asking because I'm in a tough spot."

I sent a few heartbroken emojis. "I don't believe you. Let's end this. I guess there really isn't a woman worth loving in this world."

Terrified of losing her catch, Mia backtracked immediately. She claimed it was just a joke. She swore she never meant to borrow money. Her love was pure and genuine, completely separate from financial matters.

I "calmed down" and continued our casual conversation.

To get rid of her ex quickly, Mia maxed out her credit cards. She took out every online loan she could find, even resorting to a naked loan.

I accidentally saw the notifications popping up on her phone.

Now she faced endless debt collectors. Panicked, she knew she had to secure Liam Evans fast.

Desperate, she finally revealed her true identity to my burner account.

"Actually, I'm Mia Lowell. I've had a crush on you for so long. Watching you with Olivia Sullivan breaks my heart."

"Please give me a chance to love you properly."

"I promise I'll cherish you and never hurt you."

I laughed at her "confession" and replied, "Silly, I've known it was you all along."

Mia sent a question mark.

I told her I'd been interested in her too. But out of respect for Olivia, I never made a move.

Besides, the only person who knew so much about Olivia and me was her best friend.

I was testing her all along. Now she had finally passed.

I believed she truly loved me.

Mia was overjoyed. She immediately asked when I would break up with Olivia. She couldn't stand pretending to be friends with that disgusting woman any longer.

I sent a mischievous emoji. "Olivia cheated on me behind my back. I can't let her off easy. I'll make sure she suffers humiliation and ruins her reputation."

Mia replied, "I never knew you could be so ruthless. But I like it. I've always hated Olivia. Tell me, how do you plan to get back at her?"
###Chapter 11

I told her, "Let's keep Olivia in the dark for now."

"Keep planning the engagement party as usual."

"When the day comes, I'll publicly dump her."

"I'll expose her true promiscuous nature."

"Then you can become my fiancée."

"How does that sound?"

Mia Lowell had no objections.

She was eager to ruin my reputation and immediately agreed to Liam Evans's proposal.

Thus began Mia's series of outrageous actions.

As I planned the wedding, Mia insisted on accompanying me.

She involved herself in every detail.

From venue decorations and vendor selections to wedding dresses and catering.

She even micromanaged the invitations and wedding favors.

She demanded everything be tailored to her personal preferences.

The staff was confused, unsure who the actual bride was.

When Liam's parents arrived, Mia rushed to greet them.

She showered them with overly sweet compliments and excessive attention.

The elderly couple was thoroughly startled.

They pulled me aside to ask what was going on.

I smiled and reassured them.

"She's been through a rough patch recently."

"A bad breakup and losing her job."

"Her mental state isn't great."

"Please just humor her."

Liam's mother remained uneasy.

She pointed at Mia, who was shadowing Liam's every move.

"If she's heartbroken, why is she clinging to Liam?"

"She doesn't even avoid getting close to her best friend's fiancé?"

I glanced over and nearly laughed aloud.

Mia kept brushing her chest and hips against Liam.

She repeatedly called him "Big Brother Liam," annoying him intensely.

Liam raised his hands, shooting me a pleading look.

He begged me to rescue him from this torment.

I pulled Mia away and redirected her energy elsewhere.

I privately comforted Liam.

"Just a little longer."

"Hang in there."

"It'll all be over soon."

After the preparations, Mia had the audacity to invite herself to our family dinner.

I treated it as entertainment and agreed.

During the meal, she was tirelessly busy.

She kept toasting Liam's parents, calling them "our mom and dad."

She flirted shamelessly with Liam, rubbing her foot against his leg under the table.

She thought she was being clever, treating me like a fool.

She likely never imagined she was the one being played.

Liam couldn't tolerate it any longer.

A vein throbbed on his forehead.

He finally snapped and kicked Mia hard.

"Ouch!" Mia immediately burst into tears.

No wonder—Liam held a black belt in taekwondo.

That kick could have easily broken her leg.

She abandoned the meal, gritting her teeth as she limped to the hospital.

She claimed her leg had cramped and excused herself.

Soon, I received a message from Mia.

She sent a photo of her severely swollen ankle and complained.

"Darling, you kicked me so hard."

"Look how swollen my ankle is—it's like a pig's trotter."

"And why have you been ignoring me?"

"Aren't we getting married soon?"

"Why are we still pandering to that bitch Olivia?"

"Seeing her makes me furious."

"What kind of person has the nerve to cling to you like this?"

I laughed while soothing her.

"We have to make the act convincing."

"Until the very last moment, we can't let our guard down."

"I need to humiliate Olivia publicly at the engagement party."

"Be patient a little longer."

"I promise you an engagement ceremony you'll never forget."
###Chapter 12

The engagement party was filled with guests.

Liam stood on stage, pouring his heart out in a passionate declaration.

Just as he reached the most emotional part, the hall doors swung open.

Mia Lowell stood there in a white wedding dress, microphone in hand, shouting at Liam.

"Liam, I'm here to marry you!"

"Today, I want everyone to know you love me, not that promiscuous slut Olivia!"

I stood on stage with my back to her, struggling to hold back laughter.

Liam watched my reaction with amusement, tapping my head gently.

Then he turned to Mia with a stern expression.

"Please be silent! My heart has always belonged only to Olivia."

"Someone two-faced who betrays friends like you? I wouldn't touch you with a ten-foot pole."

"Stop misleading everyone with these false claims about our relationship."

Mia stammered, completely bewildered. This wasn't according to plan.

"But Liam, you said you wanted to be with me! You promised to break up with Olivia!"

"You're lying! I don't believe you! You love me! Is Olivia threatening you? Don't be afraid - come to me and we'll face this together!"

Sorry, but I couldn't hold it in any longer.

I turned around, smiling at Mia. "Let me guess - you and Liam have been secretly messaging, pledged your love privately, and planned to humiliate me today by having him leave me for you?"

Her eyes widened in shock. "How... how did you know?!"

I chuckled. "Silly girl, because you've been talking to my alternate account all along."

"Now for everyone's entertainment - please direct your attention to the big screen!"

The massive screen displayed my carefully prepared PowerPoint presentation with over 100 slides.

It contained all of Mia's attempts to seduce Liam through messages, her provocative photos, even pictures of her hospitalized after the vibrator incident at work.

There were news links about her being caught in lingerie at a hotel affair.

The hall erupted in chaos. Mia completely lost it.

Standing there in her white wedding dress, she might as well have been naked before everyone, exposed to their ridicule and contempt.

"Wasn't Mia supposed to be Olivia's best friend? How could she stab her in the back like this?"

"Look at these messages - she's been spreading horrible rumors about Olivia's character. Disgusting."

"She threw away all self-respect for a man? Following his every command? What a shameful woman."

"Who does she think she is? Believing Liam would choose her over Olivia? The audacity!"

"It's you! You knew all along! You played me! Olivia, you bitch! I'll kill you!"

She lunged at me but her injured foot and long dress made her stumble.

She fell flat on her back without even touching me.

I looked down at her coldly. "None of this would have happened if you hadn't entertained these wicked thoughts."

"Mia, after everything, I kept asking myself - what did I ever do to deserve your hatred? Why destroy me like an enemy when I genuinely considered you my friend all these years?"

"Stealing my man was bad enough. But you even spread rumors in high school that I was bullying others? Getting me isolated by classmates? You hated me that much over a decade ago?"
###Chapter 13

Mia Lowell lay sprawled on the floor.
Her venomous gaze fixed on me like a serpent's.
"Yes, I hate you!"
"The person I despise most in this world is you!"

"Why do you get everything?"
"You come from a wealthy family."
"You're beautiful."
"Your parents adore you."
"You have a perfect boyfriend who loves only you."
"All the world's blessings belong to you alone."
"While I'm forced to stand beside you like an ugly duckling, just for contrast?"

"Being nice to me?"
"Spare me your hypocritical act."
"It makes me sick."
"You treated me like a beggar."
"Did you think I'd be grateful?"
"Dream on!"

"I only hate you."
"Every miserable moment of my life, you were there."
"You stood by, pitying me, handing out charity."
"You must have been thrilled deep down."

"Did you think I couldn't manage without you?"
"You meddling bitch!"
"All you ever did was laugh at my misfortune!"

"So I thought, why shouldn't I have what you have?"
"Everything you possess, I'll take for myself!"

I shook my head in disbelief.
So this was how she had always seen me.
This was how she viewed my help.
This was how she regarded our friendship?

It was utterly irrational.

Liam Evans had long lost his patience.
"This is the fundamental difference between you and Olivia!"
"Olivia genuinely cared for you."
"She wanted to help you escape your family's troubles, asking nothing in return."
"She considered you a friend and shared her happiness with you."

"But you?"
"You only saw it as her showing off."
"As her humiliating you."

"Someone like you doesn't deserve friends."

Mia tried to speak again.

Suddenly, loud noises erupted from the doorway.
"Where's my daughter? Where is she?"
"That damned girl! She vanished after getting into college! Took me forever to find her!"
"Mia, you wretched girl! Look who's here!"

Hearing this, Mia's eyes widened in terror.
Her entire body trembled.
She turned her head shakily.
The sight before her filled her with dread.

Her family had found her.
Her father, her mother, and her brother with the dyed blond hair.
All three of them, standing together.

"No! No! Get out! I don't know you!" Mia screamed hysterically.

Her father stepped forward and slapped her across the face, silencing her.

Her mother viciously yanked her hair and tore off the cumbersome wedding dress.

Her blond brother began dragging her toward the exit.

Mia struggled desperately.
She reached out to me, pleading.
"Olivia, I'm sorry! I was wrong! I shouldn't have had those wicked thoughts! Please forgive me!"

"Help me one more time!"
"I'll repay you for the rest of my life!"

"You helped me once before with college!"
"Help me again now, please!"
"I can't go back!"
"If I go back, they'll definitely sell me off! I beg you!"

I watched Mia's desperate pleas with cold indifference.
My heart remained utterly calm.

So she did remember.
Back then, to help her escape her family completely, I encouraged her to apply to a university far from home.
I even helped her keep it secret from her parents.

I paid for her tuition and living expenses all four years of college.
All these years, I knew her parents were searching for her, and I still kept her secret.

I even helped her find jobs and apartments later on.

But in her eyes, all of this was just humiliation.

In that case, I told her, "I'm sorry."
"This time, I won't humiliate you again."

Mia wept bitterly, kowtowing to me, apologizing.

I simply watched coldly.

In the end, her family took her away.
Back to where she came from.

Later, I heard about Mia from hometown classmates.

Apparently, as soon as she returned home, her parents accepted a "$52,000 bride price" for her.
They married her off to a fifty-something-year-old loner.

The loner probably heard about her premarital antics.
He kept her under tight watch, locking her indoors every day.
He was constantly paranoid and would beat her when drunk.

Less than a year later, the loner drowned in a river after a drinking binge.

To pay off their son's gambling debts, Mia's parents married her off again.
This time, they say she was sent even farther away.
To remote mountains without road access, where escape was impossible.

She had three daughters in three years.
And now she's pregnant with another...

I never appeared in her life to interfere again.
This time, she probably can't complain about me meddling.

(The End)
