###Chapter 1: I'm the One Walking Away

**Summer's POV*

The crisp autumn breeze at JFK carried the familiar scent of home as I wheeled my luggage through the arrival gates. After a year of managing Fortune Corp's European division, I couldn't wait to surprise Alexander.Our third anniversary was coming up, and I'd deliberately finished my assignment two weeks early to celebrate it with him.

*God. I've missed him so much.* My heart fluttered as I checked my phone,half expecting to see a message from him. The screen showed nothing but the usual notifications and a missed call from Victoria. *Whatever drama my sister's cooking up can wait.*

The taxi ride to Fortune Corp felt endless. I'd rehearsed this moment countless times during those lonely nights in London - walking into his office,seeing his face light up with that boyish smile I'd fallen in love with.Three years together, and he still made my heart race like a teenager's.

"Miss Taylor?" The receptionist's bright voice snapped me out of my daydream. "Welcome back! Are you here for the General Manager's wedding?"

I froze."The...what?"

"Oh!" Her smile faltered. "The engagement party, I mnean. At The Plaza Hotel? For Mr. Alexander Stark and Miss Victoria Taylor?" The words hit me like a physical blow. *Alexander and... Victoria?* My sister? "There must be some mistake," I heard myself say, my voice unnaturally calm. "Alexander Stark is my fiancé." The receptionist's face drained of color. "I... um...perhaps you should speak with Mr. Stark directly? He's at The Plaza Hotel for the engagement ceremony..."

I don't remember leaving the building. My feet carried me automatically while my mind spun in circles, trying to make sense of what I'd just heard.*This is crazy. There has to be an explanation. Victoria would never...Alexander couldn't possibly...*




The Plaza Hotel loomed before me, its elegant facade seeming to mock my disheveled state. And there it was - a massive photo display in the lobby.Alexander and Victoria, looking picture-perfect together. His arm around her waist. Her diamond ring catching the light.
*This isn't happening. This can't be happening.*

My legs shook as I made my way to the Grand Ballroom. The sound of laughter and clinking glasses grew louder with each step. Then I saw them.
Alexander had his arm around Victoria's waist, just like in the photo.She was wearing a stunning white dress, her smile radiant as she leaned into him. They looked... perfect together. Like they belonged.

"Summer!" Alexander's voice cut through the buzzing in my ears."You actually came to our engagement party?"

"Your.,,engagement party?" The words tasted like ash in my mouth.′′Aryou kidding me right now? Alexander, what the hell is going on? Victoria.how could you do this?"
###Chapter 1: I'm the One Walking Away

away, and I'm the one making a scene? That's rich!"

The sharp crack of the slap echoed through the ballroom.Mymother.Elizabeth, stood before me, her hand still raised. "You disgraceful child!How dare you try to ruin your sister's special day?"

"Mom, have you literally lost your mind?" My cheek burned where she'd struck me. "Alexander is MY fiancé! What is wrong with you people?"

"What absolute nonsense are you spouting?" Elizabeth's voice dripped with disdain. "Alexander will be your brother-in-law soon. Why must you always try to compete with Victoria? It's pathetic,really."

The room spun around me. Faces blurred together-shocked guests,smirking Victoria, stern Elizabeth. And Alexander, looking at me with something between pity and annoyance.

"Alexander." My voice shook. "Tell them the truth. Tell them who you were really engaged to this whole time."

He met my eyes, and I saw nothing of the man I'd loved for three years."Summer, I'm sorry, but Victoria is the one I truly love. She always has been. You need to accept that and move on."

Something broke inside me then. The last thread of hope, maybe.Or perhaps it was just my heart.

"Alexander Stark." I straightened my spine, forcing steel into my voice."Remember this - I'm not the one being left. I'm the one walking away.And you'll regret this day for the rest of your life."



The New York evening air hit my face as I stumbled out of The Plaza.Tears blurred my vision as I rushed down the sidewalk, needing to get as far away as possible from that nightmare scene. The weight of everything I'd lost pressed against my chest: three years with Alexander, countless shared dreams, the simple trust I'd placed in my own sister. How long had they been seeing each other behind my back?How many of our phone calls had been lies? How many times had Victoria smiled at me while knowing what she planned to do?
A sudden screech of tires jerked me from my spiral of thoughts.*Great,just what I need - to be run over on the worst day of my life.* Bright headlights flooded my vision as a black Bentley came to an abrupt stop mere inches from where I stood frozen in the crosswalk. The shock sent me stumbling backward, my ankle twisting as I lost my balance and fell hard against the asphalt. *Perfect. Absolutely perfect.*
The car's rear door opened, and two men stepped out. The first was in an impeccable suit, clearly some kind of assistant. But it was the second man who made me forget to breathe for a moment.
He was tall, at least 6'2", with sharp features that seemed carved from marble and brown hair. His presence radiated authority, the kind of power that came not just from wealth, but from absolute confidence. Those eyes,though-they held me captive. Deep brown with flecks of amber that caught the streetlight, they studied me with an intensity that felt almost physical. His jaw was sharp and defined, with a hint of stubble that gave him a dangerous edge. Full lips set in a stern line completed a face that would make sculptors weep-perfect in its symmetry yet utterly masculine in its severity.

"Mr. Stark?" The assistant's voice carried a note of concern. *Another Stark,* I thought bitterly, recognizing the way oldmoney seemed to cling to him like a second skin. But there was something different about this one -something almost predatory in his focused gaze.
"James," The taller man's deep, commanding voice sent an inexplicable shiverdown my spine. "Stay back." Without waiting for his assistant's response, he stepped forward,his movements deliberate and precise. I found myself unable to look away from those dark eyes as he extended his hand toward me. For a moment.I just stared at it, my mind struggling to process this simple gesture after everything that had happened.

"Are you alright? Take my hand."
###Chapter 2: Get Your Fucking Hands off Her
**Summer's POV**

I scrambled to my feet, wincing as pain shot through my anle. "I'm fíne.Just leave me alone." My voice came out rougher than intended, thick with the tears I refused to let fall in front of strangers.

The taller man took a step forward, his dark eyes locking onto mine with unsettling intensity.

"Wait," he said, his voice commanding yet somehow gentle. His hand shot out.catching my wrist before I could turn away.

I jerked my arm away, anger and heartbreak from the day's events suddenly boiling over. "I don't fucking know you!" I snapped, tears threatening to spill. "Don't touch me!"

Something flickered across his perfect features-surprise? Interest? His hand dropped to his side, but his eyes never left my face.

"Hey-" he started again.

"Just leave me alone!" I limped away as quickly as my injured ankle would allow, not bothering to hide the tears streaming down my face now.

I didn't look back, butI could feel those dark eyes following me, their intensity burning into my skin like a physical touch. The Manhattan Club's crystal chandeliers sparkled overhead, refracting through my fourth-or was it fifth?-glass of whiskey. I'd never been much of a drinker, and I definitely wasn't the type to frequent Manhattan's elite nightspots alone. *But what else can I do?* After the nightmare at The Plaza, I needed something stronger than tears to dull the bitter taste of betrayal lingering in my mouth.

Each sip burned going down, but it was nothing compared to the pain eating away at my heart.

"Now that's a crime," a male voice drawled from my left. "A beautiful lady drinking alone?"

I didn't bother turning my head. My skin crawled at his tone-that particular blend of entitlement and false charm I'd grown too familiar with in the financial district. "Not interested."

"Playing hard to get?" A second voice joined in, closer this time. "Come on,sweetheart. Let us show you a good time."

My head was spinning more than it should have been, even with the alcohol. The room seemed to tilt and shift around me, the crystal chandeliers blurring into streaks of light. *Something's wrong.*Creeping dread seeped through my alcohol-induced haze. This wasn't normal drunkenness.

"Back off," I managed, my tongue feeling strangely heavy. "I said I'm not interested."*Why can't I think straight? What's happening to me?*

The first man chuckled as he got closer. "That's not what your eyes are saying. Let's go somewhere more... private." I tried to stand, but my legs wouldn't cooperate. Terror clawed at my chest as I realized how vulnerable I was. *Oh god, what did they put in my drink?* "Looks like someone can't handle her liquor," the second man said, his voice dripping with false concern. "We should help her out." Strong hanads gripped my arms, pulling me up. I tried to fight, to scream.but my muscles refused to respond. Everything was blurring,fading at theedges.

"Let go!" I slurred, the words barely audible even to my own ears.

"Don't worry, sweetheart. We'll take good care of you1,"one of them whispered, his breath hot against my ear.

They half-dragged, half-carried me toward the back of the club. Through my drug-induced haze, I registered dim lighting, private booths, the sounds of exclusive Manhattan nightlife fading behind us. We stopped at a door marked "VIP," and panic shot through me like electricity.

"No," I gasped, summoning every ounce of strength to pull away. "Stop!"

One of them laughed, the sound harsh and grating. "Feisty. I like that."

The door swung open, revealing a plush private room with low lighting and leather couches. They shoved me inside, and I stumbled, falling onto one of the couches. My limbs felt leaden, unresponsive.

"Please," I whispered, hating how weak I sounded but too terrified to care."Let me go."

"Relax," the taller one said, loosening his tie with practiced ease."You'll enjoy this."


The other one locked the door, then turned to me with a predatory smile. "No one's going to interrupt us now." Horror washed over me as they began unbuckling their belts, their intentions sickeningly clear.

 "Open wide, sweetheart," one of them sneered, unzipping his pants. "We've got something for that pretty mouth of yours." Tears blurred my vision as I tried to push myself up, to find some escape route. My limbs felt like lead, refusing to cooperate. *This can't be happening. Not today. Not after everything else.*

"Don't-" My protest came out as a weak whisper.

The door suddenly burst open wih enough force to splinter the frame.

"What the-" One of the men spun around, his protest dying on his lips.

Framed in the doorway stood a tall figure in an impeccable suit. Even through my hazy vision, I recognized the sharp angles of his face,those dark eyes that seemed to freeze everything they looked at.

"Get your fucking hands off her." His voice was deceptively soft, but something in it made the room temperature drop several degrees.

My would-be attackers froze. "Who do you think... wait, Mr.Stark? We...we didn't know she was with you."

*Stark.* The name penetrated my fog-filled mind, sending a jolt of recognition through me. The man from the crosswalk. The one with the Bentley. *Of all the people in New York, I had to be rescued by another Stark?*


"Did you touch her?" His voice remained calm, but the threat beneath it was unmistakable. This wasn't the casual arrogance I'd grown used to from Alexander-this was something else entirely. Raw power,barely contained.


The two men fumbled to zip up their pants, terror evident on their faces. "Mr. Stark, we.,. we haven't touched her yet, I swear!" The shorter one backed away, hands raised.defensively. I struggled to stand, but my legs gave out. Instead of hitting the floor, I collided with something solid-someone. Strong arms steadied me, and I caught the faintest hint of a crisp, winter-fresh scent. "So hot." I muimbled, pressing closer to the cool fabric of his suit.

There was a moment of absolute stillness. Then those strong arms swept under my legs, lifting me effortlessly. The sudden movement sent the room spinning again, and I buried my face in his shoulder with a small whimper.

"Please," I gasped, not even sure what I was asking for.

He didn't respond, but his arms tightened slightly around me.The gesture sent an odd shiver through my overheated body. Or maybe that was just the drugs. Everything was getting harder to track, reality dissolving at the edges.

"James." The single word carried the weight of a command.

"Yes, sir." A new voice, crisp and professional. I hadn't even noticed the second man entering behind Stark.

"Make sure they never touch another woman again," Brandon ordered,his voice ice-cold. "Permanently."

"With pleasure,sir."

The world swayed as he carried me out of that terrible room, past wide-eyed club patrons, toward what I vaguely recognized as a private elevator.
###Chapter 3: You Have a Beautiful Figure

**Summer's POV**

Fire. My whole body was on fire, and I couldn't make it stop. Through the haze of whatever they'd slipped into my drink, I was vaguely aware of being carried-strong arms cradling me, the steady rhythm of footsteps.

"So hot," I whimpered, pressing my face against the cool fabric of his suit.My skin felt like it was trying to crawl off my body. Everything hurt.Everything burned. "Please... make it stop."

The arms around me tightened, his grip flexing against my trembling body,but he didn't say a word. Even through the drug's grip, I could feeI the coiled tension in him-his chest hard against my side, his breath steady.My hands clawed weakly at his jacket, fingers fumbling for anything to anchor me as the heat pulsed lower, pooling wet and insistent between my thighs.

We were moving again-door opening, shoes clicking on hardwood-then the world lurched as he shifted me in his arms. I heard water running,a distant roar, and then-oh fuck-ice-cold water slammed into my overheated skin. I gasped, my body jerking violently, tits straining against the soaked fabric of my dress as I tried to scramble away from the shock.But his hands-big, unyielding-pinned me down, one gripping my waist,the other clamping my shoulder, forcing me back into the tub.

"Stay still!" His deep voice brooked no argument. I shook my head frantically, my body fighting against both the drug's heat and the water's chill. "Cold... too cold..." My nipples hardened painfully under the drenched fabric, poking out like they were begging for attention,and I couldn't tell if it was the ice or the way his fingers dug into me that made me squirm.

I heard him speaking into what must have been a bluetooth earpiece, his voice sharp and commanding. "James. I need ice. Every piece you can find.Bring it to my suite. Now."

There was a pause as he listened to the response. "Immediately, James."

The water kept rising, lapping at my hips, my shivering uncontrollable.I knew this had to be saving me-had to be--but my body didn't give a shit about reason. It craved escape, craved him. His hand slid from my shoulder to my forehead, checking my temperature, and the touch was like a live wire-electric, jolting through me. I arched hard against him, a needy moan slipping out as my chest pressed into his arm,my wetness soaking through my panties and mingling with the water.

"Please," I begged.

He didn't reply, but one of his hands moved to my forehead,checking my temperature. The touch sent an electric shock through my system, and I arched involuntarily, seeking more contact with his cooler skin.

Minutes that felt like hours passed before I heard a quick, efficient knock at the door. Mr. Stark's hands never left me as he called out, "Enter."

"The ice, sir," James's voice was professionally crisp.

"Leave it there. Go." The door shut, and I heard the clatter of ice hitting the tub, the water turning arctic as he dumped it in. I yelped, trying to claw my way out,my nails scraping his forearm, but he caught me effortlessly. One arm hooked under my tits, pressing them up as he yanked me back, the other hand sliding down to grip my thigh, fingers dangerously close to where I was dripping wet and aching.

"Hold on," he murmured, his voice carrying an odd note of gentleness that seemed at odds with his forceful grip. "It'll be over soon."

I didn't know how long it lasted-me thrashing against him, half-sobbing.half-moaning as the ice bit into my skin and the drug pulsed in my cunt.His chest pressed against my back now, his breath hot on my neck as he held me down, and I could feel the hard line of his cock through his pants,brushing my ass every time I moved. At some point, tears mixed with the water, my body a trembling mess of fire and frost, and I didn't care-I just wanted him to touch me, to make it stop or make it worse, anything.

Eventually, the burning began to fade,replaced by bone-deep exhaustion.My struggles weakened, then stopped entirely. The last thing I remember was his voice, low and reassuring: "Sleep now. You're safe."




I woke to sunlight streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows and the worst headache of my life. For a moment, I just lay there, trying to piece together where I was. The bed was definitely not mine-the sheets felt like they cost more than my monthly rent. The room itself was equally luxurious,all cream and gold with tasteful modern art on the walls.

The Manhattan Club. The drugged drink. The mysterious Mr. Stark.The memories came flooding back, bringing with them a wave of anxiety. I sat up carefully, fighting back a wave of dizziness. My whole body felt like I'd gone ten rounds with a heavyweight champion. Looking down, I realized I was completely naked. My heart rate spiked as I quickly pulled the silky sheets up to cover myself. I did a careful self- assessment. No soreness, no marks, nothing to suggest... I took a deep breath. Okay. Okay. Let's think this through.*

"Good morning, Miss Taylor."

The voice from the doorway made me jump. Mr. Stark stood there,impeccable in what had to be a Tom Ford suit, his dark eyes studying me with an intensity that made my skin prickle. In the harsh morning light.he looked even more striking than I remembered - all sharp angles and controlled power.

I clutched the sheets tighter to my chest, feeling my face flame with embarrassment. His eyes traveled over me with deliberate slowness before returning to my face.

"You have a beautiful figure," he remarked casually, as if commenting on the weather. "Though I imagine you'd prefer some clothes now."

"I... yes," I managed, mortification making my voice crack.

He moved into the room with fluid grace, picking up a glass of water from the bedside table and holding it out to me. The gesture was surprisingly considerate, though his expression remained unreadable.

"Thank you," I said after taking a careful sip. My eyes caught on his hands as he withdrew them - long-fingered and elegant, but with a strength I remembered all too well from last night. Those hands had kept me from drowning myself in a drug-induced haze.
About... about my clothes..," I started awkwardly, desperately hoping there was an innocent explanation. One corner of his mouth lifted slightly. "Miss Taylor, don't worry.Nothing happened last night. Your clothes were soaked through from the ice bath- a necessary precaution against the drugs in your system. The maid removed them after you fell asleep."
I nodded, relief washing through me. Then something clicked. "How do you know my name?"

The slight smile disappeared, replaced by something more calculating."You really should seen the headlines, Miss Taylor. The jilted fiancée who cursed her sister's engagement to Alexander Stark. Quite dramatic."

All the blood drained from my face. My hands started to shake, and I clutched at the silk sheets to hide it. Of course. Of course the story had spread. In the cutthroat world of Wall Street, this kind of scandal was better than currency.

"About those rumors going around about you, Miss Taylor," he continued.his dark eyes never leaving my face, "there are quite a few versions floating around. Which one would you like me to fill you in on?"

A chill ran down my spine at his tone. This wasn't just idle curiosity. This was... something else. Something with purpose behind it.

"Who are you anyway?" I asked, my voice steadier than I felt. "And what do you really want from me?"
###Chapter 4: From Now On, You Have Me

*Summer's POV**

Mr. Stark's fingers traced the edge of his platinum cufflink as he spoke,the gesture casual yet somehow predatory. "Who I am doesn't matter.What matters is that I can help you."

*That commanding tone... like he's used to people following his every word.* I clutched the silk covers tighter to my chest, painfully aware of my nakedness beneath them. The realization that I wasn't wearing anything sent a wave of vulnerability crashing through me. "I don't need your help."The words came out sharper than I intended, tinged with the bitter memories of the last time I'd trusted someone's help. My fingers clenched in the fabric, knuckles turning white.

He moved closer, each step measured andI deliberate, like a predator approaching cornered prey. My heart stuttered as his expensive leather shoes whispered against the plush carpet.

"Really?" His deep voice carried a hint of amusement, but his eyes... God.those eyes. Dark and intense, they seemed to see right through my fragile defenses. One corner of his mouth lifted in a knowing smirk as he continued, "Why did you come to Manhattan Club last night? Your fiancébecoming your brother-in-law, your parents' distrust - you've become the target of everyone's gossip." "Who are you?" I demanded again, but this time the question carried a different weight. He knew too much for this to be a coincidence. He took another step closer, and I caught that same winter-fresh scent from last night. "Brandon Stark." *The Brandon Stark? Seriously?* The name hit me like a physical blow.My mind raced through the possibilities, the connections. "Wait.., what's your connection to Alexander?"

His lips curved into a predlatory smile. "If I say there's no real connection.would you believe me?"

I narrowed my eyes, suspicion flaring as I pulled the sheet higher.ensuring it covered me completely. "Are you trying to use me against him or something? Some Stark family feud I don't know about?"

A bark of laughter escaped him, sharp and dismissive. "Against him? You're giving him way too much credit!"

He closed the distance between us in two long strides, his movements fluid and graceful despite his imposing height. At this distance,I could see how his perfectly tailored suit accentuated his broad shoulders and lean frame.how the morning lght caught the sharp angles of his face. Suddenly the room felt too small, too warm. I clutched the sheet tighter around myself.terribly conscious of my complete nakedness beneath the thin barrier of silk. I tried to scoot back, but my bare skin against the smooth sheets reminded me of just how vulnerable I truly was. Trapped. Again.

His tie pin caught the morning light as he leaned closer, casting golden reflections on the wall. "Miss Taylor," his voice dropped lower, a velvet rumble that sent an involuntary shiver down my spine. His eyes searched my face with an intensity that made my breath catch. "Don't you hate them? Being betrayed by the ones closest to you, don't you hate them?" *Yes. No. I don't know anymore.* The conflicting emotions must have shown on my face because something flickered in his expression-satisfaction maybe,or triumph. "That's none of your business," I whispered, but the words lacked conviction. His proximity was making it hard to think straight, especially with nothing but a thin sheet between my bare skin and his fully clothed presence.

His hands came to rest on either side of me on the bed, effectively caging me in. The morning light caught the perfect edge of his jawline as he spoke two words that stopped my world on its axis:

"Marry me."

The words hung in the air between us, stunning me into silence. I stared at him, certain I'd misheard, watching the way his lips curved into a slight smile. My pulse roared in my ears. "What?"

"I can give you happiness that no one else in this world can reach." His tone was matter-of-fact, as if he were discussing the weather rather than proposing marriage to a virtual stranger.

"Are you serious right now?" I felt heat rush to my face, acutely aware of my complete nakedness beneath the covers. "You're proposing to me while I'm completely naked in your bed? That's beyond inappropriate!"

I pushed against his chest with one hand while desperately clutching the sheet to my body with the other, trying to create some distance betwveen us."You're ridiculous!" But he caught my wrist, using my momentum to spin me around until my back hit the cool glass of the floor-to-ceiling window, the sheet still wrapped securely around me like an impromptu toga. "Ridiculous? Is that what you think?" His breath ghosted across my neck as he leaned closer, making my pulse jump erratically. One of his hands came up to tilt my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze, while I clutched desperately at the silk sheet with my free hand.

"Just because you saved me doesn't mean I haveto marry you," I managed to say,fighting to keep my voice steady despite my precarious state. "What era do you think we're living in?"

His dark eyes seemed to darken further, and something in them made my breath catch. "The more you resist, the more determined I am to marry you."

"You're insane," I breathed, but I couldn't look away from his intense gaze."You don't even know me."

"I know enough." His thumb brushed across my jawline, the touch sending electricity dancing across my skin. "I know you're stronger than you think. I know you deserve better than what they've done to you."

"Stop it." My voice cracked on the words, betraying the tremor I was trying so hard to hide. "Just... stop." My hand pressed against his chest,feeling the steady beat of his heart through the expensive fabric of his suit while my other hand maintained its death grip on the only thing preserving my modesty.


His free hand came up to brush a strand of hair from my face, the gesture startlingly gentle compared to his earlier intensity. "Don't belittle yourself."His tone softened slightly, but his grip remained firm, his thumb tracing a small arc along my jawline. "You're not alone." He leaned closer, until I could feel the heat radiating from his body. His next words seemed to brand themselves into my soul: "From now on, you have me."
###Chapter 5: Mr. Stark, You Might Wanna Check Your Brain
**Summer's POV**

"Are you out of your mind?" I clutched the silksheets tighter around my body,painfully aware that I was completely naked beneath. I pressed my back against the headboard, my heart racing as I watched him move with that predatory grace that seemed to come so naturally. Every gesture,every look reminded me that this man was dangerous - not in the crude way of those guys at the bar last night, but in a way that made my pulse skip. "Marriage? We don't even know each other!"

His dark eyes tracked my movement, and the corner of his mouth lifted in that infuriating half-smile that somehow managed to be both arrogant and attractive. Those eyes - they seemed to see right through every defense I tried to put up, including the sheet I was desperately clinging to. "Don't we?" The subtle sound of his footsteps made my pulse race. "You crashed into my arms last night, Summer. And I didn't find your touch...unpleasant."

I jerked away as his fingers reached for my chin, pulling the sheet higher."Mr.Stark-"
 
"Brandon." "Whatever." I wrapped the sheet tighter around myself, trying to create some kind of barrier between us. "Don't you understand? I won't marry you. I don't know you, and I definitely don't love you." Something dangerous flickered in his eyes. "Then who do you love?Alexander?" His voice carried a razor's edge. "Well, he's going to be yourbrother-in-law soon."
The casual cruelty of his words hit me like a slap. "What's that got to do with you?" My voice cracked embarrassingly. "Why are you so obsessed with marrying me? Can't you find someone else?"

"You're the first woman I don't find repulsive."

I stared at him, momentarily speechless. *Was that supposed to be a compliment?* "Wow. Really? That's your pitch? Mr. Stark, you might want to work on your proposal skills."

He moved to the leather sofa, settling into it with the casual grace of a predator at rest. Even just sitting there, he exuded an aura of absolute control that made me painfully aware of how out of my depth I was-especially in my current undressed state. "It's simple. Let's make a deal."

*A deal? With Brandon Stark?* My mind flashed back to all the whispered stories I'd heard about his business dealings - about how no one ever came out ahead when making deals with him. "A deal?" I pulled my knees to my chest, keeping the sheet securely wrapped around me. "This isn't a merger or acquisition, Mr. Stark. This is marriage we're talking about."

"I need a wife." He stated it like he was discussing the weather. "And you're perfect for the position."

I laughed, "Mr. Stark, you might need to check up your brain." "Miss Taylor." His voice softened slightly, but his eyes remained intense."Take your time. I'm a patent man." Before I could form a response, there was a discrete knock at the door. I flinched, instinctively pulling the sheet higher as James entered with the same efficient grace I'd noticed last night, carrying what looked like designer shopping bags.

Brandon barely moved, just lifted his chin slightly. "Your clothes, Miss Taylor."

I hesitated. eyeing the bags suspiciously. The events of last night were still fuzzy,but I was acutely aware of mycurrent state of undress.*Did he have his assistant buy me an entire wardrobe?*

James set the bags down with a slight bow. "The bathroom is through that door,Miss Taylor."

I glanced anxiously between the bags and the bathroom door,painfully aware of my predicament. To reach the bathroom, I'd have to cross the room with nothing but a sheet to cover myself.

"Could you both please..." I started, my voice trailing off as Brandon made absolutely no move to leave. His dark eyes held mine with that unsettling intensity,clearly having no intention of giving me privacy.

"James, you may go," Brandon said, his gaze never leaving mine.

"You too," I said firmly, clutching the sheet tighter around me.

Brandon's lips curved into that infuriating half-smile. "This is my suite,Miss Taylor."

My face burned. "Then at least turn around!" One perfect eyebrow arched slightly, but after a moment, he turned to face the window. I slid out of bed carefully, wrapping the sheet around me toga-style, knowing it was far from secure. Every step toward the bathroom felt like walking a tightrope, the silk sheet threatening to slip with each movement.

Just as I reached for the bags, the sheet caught under my foot. I fumbled desperately, but it was too late-the fabric slipped,exposing my bare back and side before I could catch it.

I heard Brandon shift behind me, and froze. Had he turned around? Had he seen me? My heart hammered against my ribs as I clutched the sheet back into place. grabbed the bags, andrushed into the bathroom without looking back.

I chose a Chanel outfit from the bad. What made my skin crawl wasn't the obvious expense - it was how everything fit perfectly. *How did he know my exact size?*

Alone in the massive marble bathroom, I finally let my mnask slip. The face that stared back at me from the mirror looked foreign - pale, with shadows under the eyes that even designer concealer couldn't quitehide.*One year.* I'd been gone for just one year, managing Fortune Corp's European division. One year of late-night calls with Alexander,of missing him so much... I gripped the marble counter until my knuckles turned white. *Come on, Summer, don't cry over them again.*

When I emerged, I knew my eyes were red-rimmed despite my best efforts.Brandon was standing by the window, his tall frame silhouetted against the Manhattan skyline. He tuarned as I approached, something unreadable flickering across his face. He held out a business card, the cream cardstock thick and expensive between my fingers. My breath caught as I read the embossed text: *Brandon Stark, CEO,Stark Group.* "Don't reject help when it'soffered." His voice was quiet but carried that same undercurrent of steel I'd noticed before.

"Help?" I couldn't helpbut laugh. "What about you just say what you want from me?"

His fingers brushed my forehead, tucking away a stray strand of hair. The touch sent an involuntary shiver down my spine - gentle, almost tender,but somehow still feeling like a claim being staked. I found myself holding my breath, caught between the instinct to pull away and a traitorous urge to lean into his touch. "Ill be waiting for your good news."

I stood frozen, watching his retreating back. The door closed with a soft click, leaving me alone with my thoughts and a business card that felt like it was burning a hole in my palm.

*Brandon Stark.* One of Wall Street's Four Kings. The financial prodigy who'd taken control of the Stark Group at an age when most people were still figuring out their careers.

And he wanted to marry me? *Why?* What could someone like him possibly want with someone whose reputation was in tatters, whose own family had turned against her?

I slipped the card into my bag before I left, trying to ignore how my fingers trembled slightly. Whatever game Brandon Stark was playing, I wanted no part of it. *So why can't I just throw his card away?*
###Chapter 6:How Shameless


**Summer's POV**

The morning sun felt like a mockery as I stepped out of the taxi in front of my apartment building. *God, what a night.* My head still throbbed from whatever those creeps had slipped into my drink, and Brandon Stark's bizarre marriage proposal kept replaying in my mind like a fever dream.

I stared up at the gleaming glass tower that had been my home for the past year. Alexander had helped me choose this place when I'd finally had enough of my parents' manipulation. *"This will be our fresh start,"* he'd promised. *"Just you and me."* Now those words tasted like ash in my mouth.

The doorman gave me a sympathetic nod as I walked past. *Great. Even the staff knows about the scandal.* I jabbed the elevator button harder than necessary, willing the doors to close before anyone else could-

"Hold the elevator!"

*You've got to be kidding me.* Victoria's perfectly manicured hand shot between the closing doors, forcing them back open. She stepped in with her usual grace, Alexander trailing behind her like a well-trained puppy.The space suddenly felt suffocating.

"Summer,you're finally back?" Victoria's voice dripped with false concern."We've been so worried." I watched her reflection in the elevator's polished doors - perfect makeup,designer outfit, not a hair out of place. *Even for this early morning ambush,she had to look perfect.* My own reflection looked pae and drawn in comparison. I kept my eyes fixed on the elevator numbers, climbing far too slowly.*Deep breaths. Don't let them see you crack. Don't give them the satisfaction.*

"You went missing after the party," Alexander added,his tone carrying that familiar note of disapproval that I'd somehow never noticed before."Do you know how worried we've been?"

A bitter laugh escaped before I couId stop it. "Worried? Since when do you care about my whereabouts, Alexander?"

The elevator dinged, and I practically bolted out. But Alexander's hand caught my arm, spinning me around to face them.

"Look, we get that you're upset," Victoria said, all honey-sweet poison.She reached for my hand, and I had to fight the urge to recoil. "But what Alexander and I have... it's the real deal. While you were gone this past year, he was going through so much, and I was just there for him..."

"Wow.Supporting him. How thoughtful of you." The words burned my throat. "You knew he was my fiancé, but you just had to be there for him,right? What's your actual game here?"

I shoved past her, probably harder than necessary. She stumbled back with an exaggerated gasp.

"Jesus, Summer!" Alexander's face twisted with anger. "You're being ridiculous! Yeah, we hurt you, but it's done. We're engaged now. Just deal with it." "Deal with it?" My voice cracked with disbelief. "Oh, I'm dealing withit.By telling you both to stay the hell away from me!" Victoria's eyes filled with perfectly-timed tears. "Summer,please...we never meant to hurt you. We just... fell in love."

I couldn't hold back the harsh laugh. "That's rich. Victoría,if you're so desperate to take other people's leftovers, be my guest. I don't want anything that's been touched by someone like you."

Alexander's hand shot up, and for a moment, I thought he might actually hit me. His face twisted into something ugly -so different from the gentle expressions I'd fallen in love with.

"Alexander, don't!" Victoria grabbed his arm, playing the perfect peacemaker. "She's still my sister."

"Sister?" The word felt like poison. "Don't make me sick. You two deserve each other. Now tell me why you're really here or get out of my way!"

"It's Grandpa," Victoria finally admitted, dropping her voice. "He says he won't support our marriage unless you come home."

*There it was.* The real reason for this little ambush. "So that's what this is about? You need Grandpa's blessing for your perfect wedding?"

"Come on, Summer," Alexander said with that condescending tone he used with junior employees. "Just think about Victoria for once. Don't you want her to be happy?"

"When did either of you think about mine?" I could hear my voice rising despite my best efforts to stay calm.
"Look, this just happened," Victoria said, spreading her hands helplessly."You can't blame us for following our hearts." "Following your hearts?" I nearly choked on the words. "Was that what you were doing when you asked about my relationship every time wetalked? Playing the concerned sister while planning to take him?"

"That's not fair-" Alexander started, but I cut him off.

"Fair? You want to talk about fair?" The word exploded from me. "What about all those promises, Alexander? 'T'llnever betray you,Summer.You're the only one for me.' Was that fair?"

Victoria's perfect mask slipped for just a moment, revealing something ugly underneath. "God, you're being so dramatic right now-"

"You don't know me," I said, my voice suddenly quiet. "You never did.Neither of you did."

Victoria reached for my arm. "Summer, please. Remember when we were little? Those men who tried to take you... I saved your life!"

The mention of that childhood incident hit me like a physical blow.*How dare she use that against me now?*

"Yeah,Victoria. You saved me once. And now you've destroyed my life.Consider us even." I opened my door and faced them one last time. "You got what you wanted. Now get out."

The moment the door clicked shut behind them, my legs gave out. I slid down the wall, the tears I'd been holding back finally breaking free.
###Chapter 7: Good to See You Again, Ms.Tayla
**Summer's POV**

The next morning, my reflection in the bathroom mirror looked like something out of a hangover PSA. Dark circles under puffy eyes, pale skin.and a general air of someone who'd spent the night crying on their floor instead of sleeping in their ridiculously expensive bed. *Perfect. Just perfect.*

Victoria's words from yesterday kept echoing in my head. Each memory felt like a fresh slap.

I splashed cold water on my face, willing the icy shock to wake me up properly. *Come on, Summer. Pull yourself together. You're better than this.* The familiar routine of applying concealer and mascara helped steady my hands, if not my heart. Layer by layer, I rebuilt my armor-foundation to hide the tearstains, concealer for the dark circles, mascara to brighten eyes dulled by another sleepless night.

*God, when did I become this person?* A year ago, I'd been the golden girl of Fortune Corp's European division, engaged to Alexander, secure in my sister's love. Now? Now I was the scandal of Wall Street, hiding in my apartment and crying myself to sleep. *No. No more of that.* My phone buzzed just as I was finishing my makeup, making me jump.My maternal grandfather Jonathan Thompson's familiar contact photo lit up the screen, and just seeing it made something in my chest ache.Grandpa had always been my safe harbor, the one person who never played favorites between Victoria and me. "Hi Grandpa," I managed, trying to inject some cheer into my voice.Fake it till you make it, right? "Missing me already?"
"You silly girl!" His warm voice wrapped around me like a hug. "Come see me tomorrow!"

"Grandpa,I-"

"Don't forget!"

A small, genuine smile tugged at my lips despite everything. "Alright.alright,I'll come,okay?"




The next afternoon found the cab I was in pulling into the familiar driveway of Grandpa's Upper East Side brownstone, a bag of groceries from Whole Foods riding shotgun. I'd spent way too long debating what to bring-the whole point of visiting was supposed to be checking on him.making sure he was eating properly, but somehow I'd turned it into an hour-long anxiety spiral. *Should I get organic kale or regular? Does he still like those fancy protein shakes? Will he roll his eyes at the gluten-free bread?* After the driver pulled over, the bag of groceries shifted slightly in the back seat, a box of his favorite Earl Grey tea threatening to spill out. I'd grabbed it on impulse, remembering all the times he'd made us tea while helping me with my calculus homework. Such a small thing, but thinking about it now made my eyes burn. Parker, Grandpa's long-time butler, opened the door before I could even ring the bell. His familiar dignified face brightened with a warm smile."Welcome back, Miss Summer. Please, come in." I started toward the kitchen with my grocery bag, but Parker cleared his throat softly. "Professor Thompson has a guest today."

"A guest?" I frowned. "But Grandpa said today..."

A deep,familiar voice drifted from the study, stopping me in my tracks."The market indicators were clear, Professor. The real question was whether the board would recognize them in time."

*That voice.* My heart stuttered in my chest. *It couldn't be.*

"Brandon, my boy." Grandpa's warm chuckle carried down the hall. "You haven't visited your old professor in ages. Too busy with Wall Street?"

*Brandon. Brandon Stark. Here.* The grocery bag suddenly felt too heavy in my arms. What were the odds? What were the *fucking* odds that he'd be here today of all days?

"Summer's here?" Grandpa's voice carried from the study, and I realized I must have made some sound of distress. "Come in, dear!"

My feet carried me forward on autopilot. The study door seemed to loom before me, heavy oak panels hiding whatever scene waited on the other side. *Get it together. You're not doing anything wrong. This is your grandfather's house.*


I pushed open the door, plastering on my best attempt at a casual smile. "Hi,Grandpa! I brought some groceries-" "I told you to just come over." Grandpa's mock-stern voice was belied by the warmth in his eyes. I set the bag down and moved to hug him, breathing in the familiar scent of his cologne and old books. For a moment, I could pretend everything was normal. That I was just visiting my grandfather like always,not hiding from scandal and society gossip.

"Come here," he said softly. "Let me have a good look at you."

I pulled back, summoning my best playful pout. "Grandpa, I've missed you so much! Did you miss me?"

"Miss you? Nonsense." But his hand came up to pat my head gently,just like when I was little. Then his tone shifted slightly. "Still acting like a child. Can't you see I have a guest?"

*Right. Him.* I turned slowly, knowing exactly what I'd see. Brandon Stark sat in one of the leather armchairs, looking every inch the Wall Street titan in another perfectly tailored suit. His dark eyes watched me with that same intensity I remembered from the Manhattan Club,like he could see right through every defense I tried to put up.

"Brandon," Grandpa's voice carried a note I couldn't quite read. "Let me introduce you to my granddaughter, Summer Taylor."

I wanted to laugh at the absurdity of it all. *Oh, we've met, Grandpa. He saved me from being assaulted, gave me an ice bath, and then proposed marriage. You know, totally normal stuff.*

"Summer, this is my former student, Brandon Stark."

"What are you doing here?" The words slipped out before I could stop them. One corner of Brandon's mouth lifted in that infuriating half-smile."Ms.Taylor. Good to see you again." "Oh?" Grandpa's eyebrows rose slightly. "You two know each other?" "Haha." I jumped in quickly, probably a bit too brightly. "We've met briefly.Mr. Stark helped me out of some trouble, right. Mr. Stark?"
###Chapter 8: Mr. Stark, Could You Please Kee Your Distance?
**Summer's POV**

Brandon's eyes never left my face as hereplied, "Indeed, Professor.Though seeing Ms. Taylor's spirited appearance today, it seems she's already moved past that difficult time?"

*That bastard.* The subtle emphasis he put on 'difficult time' made my cheeks heat. Was he referring to the drugging incident or my public humiliation at The Plaza? Either way, the knowing look in his eyes made me want to throw something at his stupidly handsome face.

"Well," Grandpa's voice carried a hint of curiosity now. "Isn't that interesting?"

I could feel my carefully constructed composure cracking under Brandon Stark's intense gaze. The familiar comfort'of Grandpa's study suddenly felt stifling, like the walls were closing in.

"Brandon," Grandpa's voice carried that particular warmth he reserved for his favorite students, "it's been too long since you've visited your old professor. And now that my granddaughter is back from Europe, this calls for a celebration." He turned to Parker, who still hovered near the doorway."Parker, please prepare dinner. Brandon and Summer will both be joining us." "Of course, Professor," Parker's expression remained perfectly professional,but I caught the slight twitch at the corner of his mouth. *Great. Even Parker's in on whatever this is.* "Professor, I wouldn't want to impose-" I started, but Grandpa waved away my protest with the same gesture he'd probably used to dismiss countless academic arguments.
"Nonsense! Brandon, you must stay. Summer just got back from managing Fortune Corp's European division. She's still adjusting to the time difference, aren't you,dear?"

Brandon's dark eyes flickered to my face, and I fought the urge to fidget under his scrutiny. "Miss Taylor seems rather surprised to see me here."

"To be honest, Mr. Stark," I couldn't keep the edge from my voice, "finding out you're my grandfather's student is... unexpected."

One corner of his mouth lifted in that infuriating half-smile. "Do you think we have any reason to deceive you about this?"

"Brandon," Grandpa cut in before I could respond, his voice carrying a hint of pride, "this is the granddaughter I've mentioned so often.She followed in your footsteps at Columbia, you know. Graduated with honors,and now she's already an Executive Director at Fortune Corp."

I wanted to sink into the leather armchair and disappear. *Was Grandpa actually bragging about me to Brandon Stark?* The same Brandon Stark who'd seen me at my absolute worst just days ago?

"Her workwith the European division has been particularly impressive,"Grandpa continued, either oblivious to or deliberately ignoring my discomfort. "The quarterly reports show significant improvement under her management." Brandon's expression remained unreadable, but something in his eyes made my skin prickle. "Indeed. Very... impressive.""Well," Grandpa suddenly pushed himself up fom his chair, "you young people should chat. I need to organize some important documents in my study."

*What?* My head snapped up. "Grandpa-"

"Summer, be a good host to Brandon. He's my most brilliant student, you know." With that parting shot, Grandpa disappeared through the study door, leaving me alone with the last person I wanted to be alone with.
The silence stretched between us, heavy with unspoken words. I could feel Brandon's gaze on me, as tangible as a physical touch. *Don't fidget. Don't show weakness.* "So, Mr. Stark," I kept my voice carefully neutral, "Which year were you Grandpa's student?" *And how have I never heard about Brandon Stark being his student before?*

He studied me for a moment, that hint of amusement playing at the corners of his mouth. "I graduated before you started. I was fifteen when I entered Columbia."

*Fifteen?* I tried not to let my surprise show, but failed miserably. "You were a child prodigy?" *Of course he was. Because being the most powerful man on Wall Street wasn't impressive enough.*

"The Professor didn't mention that either?" His voice held a note of genuine curiosity. "Interesting, considering how frequently he talks about you." Something about the way he said it made me wonder what exactly Grandpa had been saying. Before I could pursue that thought, Brandon rose from his chair with that fluid grace that seemed to come so naturally to him. My pulse quickened as he moved to sit beside me on the antique Chesterfield sofa-much closer than strictly necessary. *God, this man.* I fought the urge to bolt from the sofa like a startled deer."Mr. Stark, could you please keep your distance?"
His dark eyes held mine with that unsettling intensity. *Why does he have to look at me like that? Like he's trying to read every thought in my head.*The weight of his gaze made my skin prickle with awareness.

"Professor Thompson clearly thinks highly of you. Perhaps we should get to know each other better, as he seems to wish."

*Yeah, right. Because the CEO of Stark Group just happens to want to 'get to know' his old professor's granddaughter. The same granddaughter who's currently the talk of Wall Street for all the wrong reasons.* I fought back a hysterical laugh. This whole situation felt like some bizarre dream-or nightmare.

"Mr. Stark." I kept my voice professionally detached despite our proximity,proud that it didn't betray the nervous flutter in my stomach. "I appreciate that you're my grandfather's former student, but that doesn't require us to become... acquainted."*And I definitely don't need another Wall Street titan complicating my life right now.*

A slight smile played at the corners of his mouth. "You're making assumptions about my intentions, Miss Taylor."
"And you're making assumptions about my interest in any sort of acquaintance," I countered, trying to maintain my composure despite how his presence seemed to fill the entire room. *Why does he have to sit so close? The sofa's huge- there's literally no reason for him to be practically breathing down my neck,* My fingers twisted nervously in my lap,betraying the calm I was trying so hard to project. *Focus,Summer.Don't think about that night. Don't think about waking up naked in his room, or the way he carried you, or...* I cut that thought off abruptly. *Nope. Not*What the hell?* I pressed my hands against his chest, trying to push him away.
###Chapter 9: Don't Wear Such Heavy Makeup Next Time
**Summer's POV**

My hands trembled slightly against Brandon's chest as I tried to maintain some distance between us. Through the expensive fabric of his suit, I could feel the steady rhythm of his heartbeat, completely at odds with my own racing pulse.

His dark eyes studied my face with an intensity that made my skin prickle.Then, without warning, his hand came up to touch my cheek. The contact sent an electric shock through my system, and I froze.

"Don't wear such heavy makeup next time," he said, his deep voice carrying an edge I couldn't quite identify. "It doesn't suit you."

The words hit a nerve I didn't even know was exposed. After everything that had happened - the betrayal, the public humiliation,the gossip-how dare he comment on my appearance? "Are you crazy?" I snapped,anger giving me the strength to finally push away from him. "Since when do you get to dictate what makeup I wear? I'll wear it as heavy as I want!"

I stood up abruptly, nearly stumbling in my haste to put some distance between us. "I should check on Grandpa!"

His eyes followed my retreat, that infuriating half-smile playing at the corners of his mouth. *God, I hate how he looks at me like that -like he knows something I don't.* I knocked on the door to Grandpa's private study, trying to calm my racing heart. "Grandpa? Can I come in?"

"Come in, dear!" His warm voice helped steady my nerves.

The familiar scent of old books and leather enveloped me as I entered.Grandpa sat in his favorite armchair, surrounded by stacks of papers and leather-bound volumes. Just seeing him there, exactly as he'd always been,made something in my chest ache.

"Come here, sweetheart." He patted the space beside his chair, and I went willingly,grateful for any excuse to be away from BrandIon's unsettling presence.

"What are you reading?" I peered at the book in his hands, then reached over to close it. "I finally come to visit you, and not only do you invite a stranger, but you hide away in here?"

Grandpa tapped my forehead gently. "You silly girl!" He sighed, his expression growing more serious. "Do you know who Brandon really is?"

"Of course I know who he is, Grandpa." I couldn't keep the edge from my voice. "Everyone on Wall Street knows Brandon Stark. But why didn't you ever mention he was your student?"

"You were just a child then. Brandon was my most brilliant student - after graduating Harvard, he went to London, so it's natural you haven't mnet him before."Something in his tone made me wary. I knew that look in his eyes - it was the same one he got right before launching into one of his famous lectures.He took my hand in his, his grip still strong despite his age. "Dear, what do you think about Brandon? I think he's quite remarkable.If..." "Stop right there." I pulled my hand away. "Grandpa, what do you think I am? Some clearance item to be sold off?"
"Oh? Using business terms now, are we?" His eyes twinkled with amusement. "Even if you were a clearance item - which you're not-Brandon certainly isn't. I'm thinking of your happiness! These past few years... you think I don't know what happened just because you didn't tell me? I warned you about Alexander being unreliable, but you wouldn't listen."

"Grandpa!" I felt tears threatening to spill over, ruining my carefully applied makeup. "Stop! I... I just trusted the wrong person. Now I see clearly, and I won't make that mistake again."

"Alright, alright, let's not talk about that useless man anymore." He squeezed my hand. "Let's talk about Brandon. Summer, darling, I'm old.You're my only worry now. I don't care if you become rich or powerful-I just want you to be happy. Brandon... I know him. I trust him."

"But I..." The words stuck in my throat. How could I explain? That the mere thought of trusting someone again made me feel sick? That every time Brandon looked at me with those intense dark eyes, I felt like I was standing on the edge of something dangerous?

*How do I tell you, Grandpa, that your brilliant former student has already proposed to me? That he found me at my lowest point and offered marriage like he was suggesting lunch?* I just watched Grandpa reorganize the papers on his desk - a nervous habit he'd had for as long as I could remember. The familiar gesture made my throat tight. Here was the man who'd supported me through everything, and now he was trying to play matchmaker with Brandon Stark of all people. *I mean, come on - I just got my heart broken, I'm not that desperate.*The thought came with a flash of indignation. *If I wanted to date, I'm sure there would be plenty of men interested in me. And seriously, I just turned down Brandon's proposal not long ago. What must he think of me now, with my own grandfather trying to set us up? God, this is mortifying.*

The leather armchair creaked as I shifted. Afternoon sunlight streamed through the study windows, catching the dust motes dancing in the air.Everything about this room was exactly as it had always been - the wall of leather-bound books, the ancient desk Grandpa refused to replace, even the subtle scent of leather and old paper. It should have been comforting.Instead, it just reminded me how much everything else in my life had changed.

Through the study's half-open door, I heard Parker's efficient footsteps in the main hall. "Mr. Stark? Are you alone? Where are the Professor and Miss Summer?"

Brandon's deep voice carried clearly to where I sat. "Pretty sure Miss Taylor can't stand me right now."
###Chapter 10: Mr. Stark, Let Go of Me!


**Summer's POV**

I fought back a hysterical laugh. Something in his tone made me pause though-that hint of... what was it? Amusement? Challenge? The way he said it reminded me of a chess player contemplating his next move.*Don't flatter yourself. Brandon Stark. I'm not one of your Wall Street acquisitions.


I glanced at Grandpa, watching how the late afternoon light caught the silver in his hair. His eyes had that familiar thoughtful gleam - the same look he got when working out a particularly complex theorem. *God,please don't tell me he's trying to solve the equation of my love life.*

His hand squeezed mine gently, those professor's fingers still strong despite their age. The familiar gesture brought a lump to my throat. *How many times had those same hands dried my tears when I was little?*Before I could spiral further into memories, Grandpa cleared his throat,drawing my attention back to our conversation.

"Grandpa, I'll do anything you ask, but not this." My voice wavered slightly despite mny best efforts to keep it steady.


Grandpa's eyes held that partícular gleam I remembered from childhood-the one that meant he thought he knew what was best for me. "Summer,darling, Brandon is really-" "Grandpa!" I cut him off, perhaps more sharply than I'd intended. The mere mention of Brandon's name sent an uncomfortable flutter through my stomach. "Keep this up and I won't visit next time!" He sighed,his fingers drumming a familiar pattern on the arm of his chair. The gesture reminded me of countless afternoons spent here, seeking his advice on everything from calculus to college applications. But this-this was different. "You're being stubborn, child."
"I'm being sensible." I stood up, smoothing my skirt with trembling fingers."We should go back out. It's not polite to leave Mr. Stark alone in the living room." *Even if that's exactly where I'd like to leave him -preferably forever.*

"I hope you won't regret this..." Grandpa's voice carried equal parts affection and exasperation. The familiar tone made my throat tight.*Why does everything have to beso complicated?*

The walk back to the living room felt longer than it should have. Each step brought me closer to those dark eyes that seemed to see right through every defense I tried to put up. Brandon stood as we entered, that predatory grace making even the simple movement look dangerous.

"Professor." His deep voice seemed to fill the room, and I had to fight the urge to retreat back to the study.

"Brandon, my boy." Grandpa's tone carried a note of apology. "You rarely visit me, and I've been such a poor host.Well,let's have dinner."

I watched Parker efficiently set the dining room table, grateful for any excuse to avoid Brandon's intense gaze. The familiar routine of a formal dinner suddenly seemed like the most complicated dance in the world.*Just get through this. Smile, nod, and get out of here as fast as possible.* Parker had outdone himself with dinner - a perfectly grilled salmon that probably cost more than my monthly grocery budget, paired with roasted vegetables that looked like they belonged in a food magazine. But I could barely taste an y of it.Every bite felt like a challenge, especially with Brandon sitting directly across from me, those dark eyes catching mine whenever I dared look up.
*God, does he ever stop watching?* Ipushed a piece of asparagus around my plate, trying to look invested in the vegetable's journey rather than acknowledge the weight of his gaze. The way he ate was infuriating too -each movement precise and elegant, like everything else about him. *Even eating dinner has to be a power move with this man.*

"Summer, dear, you've hardly touched your food," Grandpa observed,making me jump slightly. "Is something wrong with the salmon?"

"No! No, it's perfect." I rushed to take a bite, nearly choking in my haste.Brandon's lips twitched slightly, and Ihad to resist the urge to throw my napkin at his stupidly handsome face. *Don't give him the satisfaction of knowing he affects you.*

"The wine is excellent, Professor," Brandon commented, his deep voice sending an involuntary shiver down my spine. "A '82 Bordeaux?"

"Ah, you have a good eye, my boy!" Grandpa beamed, launching into a story about how he'd acquired the bottle. I used the distraction to try to calm my racing heart, but then Brandon's leg brushed against mine under the table. The contact, brief as it was, felt like an electric shock. *This has to be deliberate,* I thought, shooting him a glare. He met my eyes with that infuriating half-smile, and I swear I could see the challenge in them.*Two can play at this game.* I straightened my spine and adopted my best boardroom smile - the one I used when dealing with particularly difficult clients. "Mr. Stark," I cut into their wine discussion with practiced sweetness, "how fascinating that you're so knowledgeable about wine. Do you often spend your evenings educating young ladies about vintage years?"

His dark eyes gleamed with something that looked dangerously like amusement. "Only the interesting ones."
Before I could formulate a suitably cutting response, his phone buzzed.He checked it with a slight frown, and for a moment, I dared to hope this might be my escape. *Please let it be some urgent Wall Street crisis.A market crash. Anything.*

"Brandon," Grandpa's voice carried a note that immediately set off warning bells in my head. "it's getting late. Would you mind driving Summer home?"

*No. No, no, no.* "Grandpa..." I started, but the words died in my throat as Brandon's lips curved into that infuriating half-smile.

"It would be my pleasure." The way he said it made it sound like so much more than a simple offer of transportation.

I scrambled for an excuse, any excuse. But under Grandpa's expectant gaze and Brandon's knowing smirk, I said nothing


The way out of my grandpa's place felt endless. Brandon's presencebeside me was like a physicalforce, drawing my attention no matter how hard I tried to ignore him. As soon as we stepped out onto the sidewalk, I turned to him. "Mr. Stark,please don't trouble yourself. I can take a cab." The words came out more breathless than I'd intended, betraying my nerves. His dark eyes studied my face with an intensity that made my pulse skip."Miss Taylor seems to really dislike me." A pause, heavy with implication. "Or perhaps... it's quite the opposite?" Heat flooded my cheeks - anger, definitely anger. Not embarrassment.Absolutely not anything else. "Don't flatter yourself, Mr.Stark. We're nothing to each other. Better keep it that way." I took astep back,trying to put some distance between us. "I'm sure you have other matters to attend to."

"Nothing urgent." He moved closer, erasing the space I'd created. "Besides,I promised your grandfather. A gentleman keeps his word." His hand caught my wrist, the touch sending electricity dancing across my skin. "And abandoning a lady midway isn't very gentlemanly, is it?"

The contact sparked something in me - panic, maybe, or defiance."Mr.Stark,let go of me!"
###Chapter 11: Who Just Drove You Home?


**Summer's POV**
"Miss Taylor." His deep voice seemed to fill the space between us."Sometimes you need to face what's inevitable. Don't you agree?"
I wanted to argue, to insist on my independence, but something in his expression told me this wasn't a battle I was going to win. *Fine. One car ride. What's the worst that could happen?* With a resigned sigh, Ilet him guide me to the waiting Bentley.

The interior felt like another world entirely. The soft leather seats probably cost more than my monthly salary, and the subtle scent of his new car leather made my head spin slightly. Or maybe that was just the effect of being trapped in an enclosed space with Brandon Stark.

I caught his reflection in the window - those dark eyes studying me with that same intense focus. *Don't engage. Just get through this ride.* "Left at the next light," I said instead of answering his question.

The corner of his mouth lifted slightly. "You're quite determined to ignore me."


"I'm quite determined to get home, Mr. Stark." I kept my voice professionally detached. "And I appreciate the ride, but that's all this is."

The Bentley glided to a smooth stop at a red light, and I could feel his gaze on me."Is it?" Something in his tone made me finally turn to look at him. The streetlights cast shadows across his face, highlighting those sharp cheekbones and the subtle curve of his lips. *God, why does he have to be so... Brandon Stark?*
"Mr. Stark." I fought to keep my voice steady. "Whatever game you're playing-"
"Game?" He cut me off, his voice carrying an edge that made my pulse jump. "Is that what you think this is?"

"What else would it be?" The words came out sharper than I'd intended. "You're Brandon Stark. You could have any woman in Manhattan.Why would you possibly-"

"Second light on the right?" he interrupted smoothly.

"Yes,but-"

"Then let's focus on getting you home safely." His tone brooked no argument. "We can discuss your fascinating theories about my motivations another time."

I bit back a frustrated reply and returned to staring out the window. The familiar buldings of my neighborhood came into view, and I felt some of the tension leave my shoulders. *Almost there. Just a few more minutes.*

The Bentley came to a stop in front of my building, the engine purring softly in the night air. Before I could reach for the door handle, Brandon's voice stopped me.

"My offer still stands, Miss Taylor. Call me when you're ready." I turned to face him, suddenly angry. "Mr. Stark, I'm sure half of Manhattan's eligible women would line up for a chance with you. Why waste your time on me?" His dark eyes held mine. "That's your perception, not mine."

"Mr. Stark." I gripped my bag tighter, needing something to ground me. "Thank you for the ride, but about your proposal - I'm sorry, I can't accept it. I just escaped one trap. I'm not looking to jump into another one."
Something flickered in his expression. "How can you be so sure it's a trap when you haven't given it a chance?" His voice softened slightly. "Nothing is absolute, Miss Taylor. It's late now, get some rest."

I practically fled from the car, my heels clicking against the pavement as I hurried toward the building entrance. The sound of the Bentley's engine fading into the night should have been reassuring. Instead, it left me feeling strangely hollow.

"Who was that in the car that just dropped you off? You can't just find yourself a random guy so soon!"

The voice hit me like a physical blow. *No. Not now. Not him.* I turned slowly, already knowing what I'd see. Alexander stood in the shadows of the building's entrance, his familiar face twisted with an expression I'd never seen before.

"I don't see how that's any of your business." I was proud of how steady my voice sounded, even as my heart threatened to beat out of my chest.

He took a step closer, and I fought the urge to back away. "How is it not my business? Summer, do you even realize what you're doing?" A bitter laugh escaped before I could stop it. "What *I'm* doing? That's rich,coming from you." "I understand this is hard for you to accept-Victoria and me." His tone carried that patronizing note I'd somehow never noticed before. "But you' re young, you'll find someone else. Look, I'm going to be your brother-in-law soon. I just want what's best for you."
The words hit like acid, burning through what little composure I had left."How thoughtful of you! Please, just do me a favor and stay out of my life."
"Summer, why are you being like this?" He ran a hand through his hair-a gesture I'd oncefound endearing. Now it just made me want to scream."What's done is done. Victoria and I - it's real love."

"Fine, I get it. You love Victoria." My voice cracked slightly. "What more do you want from me? I've already stepped aside. Why can't you just leave me alone?"

His expresson darkened. "Victoria's suffering because of you. Your grandfather won't approve our marriage. Don't you feel guilty about that?"

"Guilty?" The word exploded from me like a bullet. "Are you kidding me?The only ones who should feel guilty are you two. Now, get out of my sight. Oh god, I've got tired of keeping say that!"

But he didn't move. Instead, his eyes narrowed dangerously. "Who was that man? What did he say to you? You've changed."
###Chapter 12: Back to Wall Street

**Summer's POV**
Something snapped inside me. All the pain, all the betrayal,all the carefully contained fury of the past weeks came rushing out in a torrent."Changed? You mean I'm not your obedient ex-fiancée anymore? When you sent me to Europe for a year, claiming it was for my career growth-was that when you started seeing Victoria? Did you plan it all along? Get me out of the way so you two could be together?"

"Summer-"

"Leave!" The word exploded fromn me with enough force to make him flinch. "Leave now, or I swear I'll call security!"


\---

The weekend passed in a blur of wine, ice cream,and alternating waves of anger and despair. I'd spent Saturday morning aggressively cleaning my apartment, as if I could somehow scrub away the memories of Alexander and Victoria along with the kitchen counters. By Saturday night, I'd graduated to sitting on my balcony with a bottle of cabernet, mentally rewriting every conversation I'd ever had with my sister.

Sunday wasn't much better. I'd woken up with a headache and the kind of bone-deep exhaustion that came from crying yourself to sleep. Now it was Monday morning, and I had to face reality. I stood in front of Fortune Corp's gleaming glass entrance, trying to calm my racing heart. *Just breathe. In and out. You can do this.* My Louboutins clicked against the marble floor as I walked through the revolving door, head held high despite the whispers that followed in my wake. "That's her..."

"Can you believe she had the nerve to show up?"

The whispers weren't even trying to be subtle anymore. I kept my face carefully neutral, channeling every ounce of composure I'd learned in my years navigating Wall Street. *Let them talk. They don't know anything.*
"I heard Victoria saved her life when they were kids," a woman in Chanel whispered to her companion. "And this is how she repays her? By trying to steal her fiancé?"

*God, is there anyone in Manhattan who doesn't know about this mess?*I gripped my leather portfolio tighter, using the sensation to ground myself.The lobby suddenly felt endless, each step bringing a new wave of whispers and judgmental stares.

My steps faltered for just a moment before I caught myself. *Don't react.That's what they want.* I focused on my breathing, just like I used to before big presentations. *In through the nose, out through the mouth. You're Summer Taylor, and you didn't survive Columbia Business School to let these vultures see you crack.*

"Miss Taylor?"

I turned to find the front desk receptionist, looking at me with genuine concern in her eyes. Unlike the others,her expression held no judgment -just sympathy and something that might ha ve been respect. "The whole street is talking about..." she hesitated, glancing around before continuing in a lower voice. "You should be prepared. It's...not good." A genuine smile tugged at my lips despite everything. In the cutthroat world of Wall Street, even small kindnesses felt like lifelines. "Thank you. Do you...do you believe what they're saying about me?"

She met my eyes steadily. "Miss Taylor, I've worked this desk for three years. I've seen how you treat people, how you work. I don't believe those rumors for a second."

Before I coud respond, a particularly loud voice cut through the lobby."Stealing her sister's fiancé and still acting so shameless? She's a disgrace to Wall Street."

I watched Amy's face flush with anger on my behalf, and something in my chest tightened. "It's okay," I said softly. "Let them talk. The truth has a way of coming out eventually."




The boardroom felt like a shark tank as I walked in for the Monday morning meeting. Every face turned to watch my entrance,expressions ranging from barely concealed curiosity to outright hostility. *Welcome back to Wall Street, Summer.*

I took my usual seat, arranging my materials with deliberate precision.The European division's quarterly reports sat in frontof me like a shield.*Let them try to question my professional capabilities. Numbers don't lie.*

"Well, well." Lawrence's voice dripped with condescension. "Some people seem to have no shame, showing their faces at board meetings after disgracing themselves in front of all of Wall Street." I kept my eyes on my reports, my voice steady and professional. "I wasn't aware that Wall Street's elite had nothing better to discuss than personal matters. Should we review last quarter's portfolio performance instead?" His face reddened slightly. "The European numbers look impressive. One has to wonder what... methods were used to achieve such results."

"Questioning my methods, Mr. Lawrence?" I met his eyes directly now,letting a hint of steel enter my voice. "Perhaps we should compare our respective investment strategies? I believe my return rates speak for themselves."

A ripple of uncomfortable shifting went through the room. Lawrence's track record was notably less stellar than he liked to pretend, and everyone knew it.

"Now see here-" he started, but the boardroom door opening cut him off.

Alexander and his father Old Mr. Alexander Stark walked in together,and the air in the room seemed to thicken instantly. I kept my expression neutral, though my hands clenched beneath the table. *Professional.Stay professional.*

"Good morning,everyone." Old Mr. Stark's voice carried that familiar note of authority. His eyes skimmed over me as if I didn't exist, focusing instead on the papers in front of him. "Shall we begin?"

I straightened my spine, pulling up the European division's numbers on the projection screen. If they wanted to judge me, fine. But they'd have to do it based on my work, not their gossip.

"The European market presented several unique challenges this quarter,"I began, my voice clear and confident. "However, our strategic adjustments resulted in a 15% increase in portfolio value..." As I walked them through the data, I could feel the room's energy shifting.Whatever they thought of my personal life, these numbers were impossible to dismiss. Even Lawrence's attempts to find fault grew increasingly desperate.
"These returns are unprecedented for that market sector," he tried one last time. "It seems...suspicious."
I allowed myself a small smile. "Actually, Mr. Lawrence, if you'll turn to page 47 of your packet, you'll find a complete breakdown of our methodology. Every transaction is fully documented and verified by our compliance team. Unless you're suggesting that all of London's financial oversight committees are somehow compromised?"

A few poorly hidden smirks appeared around the table. Lawrence's face turned an interesting shade of purple.
###Chapter 13: Her Photos

**Brandon's POV**
The morning sun cast long shadows across my office on the 27th floor of Stark Tower, highlighting the subtle grain of my mahogany desk. I'd been here since dawn, reviewing quarterly reports that could have waited,but sleep had become an elusive companion lately. My thoughts kept drifting to a pair of defiant eyes and the subtle tremor in her voice when she'd told me she wouldn't marry me.

A knock at the door interrupted my musings. "Come in."

James entered with his usual efficiency, a stack of reports in his arms."Good morning, Mr. Stark. The financial statements from last month."

I nodded, not looking up from the document I'd been pretending to read."Go on."

"The marketing department has significantly exceeded their budget.Finance is requesting your decision on-"

"James." I cut him off, finally meeting his gaze. "Why are you bringing this to me?"


He hesitated, just for a moment. In the decade he'd worked for me.I'd learned to read those microscopic shifts in his expression. "Sir, given the scale of the overrun-" "I hired competent people to manage these departments." I leaned back in my chair, studying him. "Let them do their jobs. If it's within acceptable parameters, I don't need to know about it." "Of course, sir." He adjusted his stance slightly - another tell. There was something else.

"What is it?"

"Miss Taylor went to Fortune Corp today."

My fingers stilled on the pen I'd been holding. *Summer.* "And?"

"The rumors..." James paused, choosing his words carefully. "They're saying she tried to steal her sister's fiancé. Lawrence and several board members have been particularly vocal about it. Some of the staff were overheard discussing her... methods of achieving success in Europe."
Something cold settled in my chest. *Of course they would attack her reputation. It's what vultures do.* "Continue."

"She handled herself well in the morning meeting, sir. But the whispers continue."

"This is her complete background file." He placed a thick folder on my desk with characteristic precision.

I waited until he finished his other updates before issuing the order that had been forming in my mind since her last rejection. "Reduce Fortune Corp's investment allocation."

"By how much1,sir?"

"Enough to make them nervous." *Let's seehow Alexander handles that.* James nodded and retreated, leaving me alone with the folder that seemed to pulse with possibility on my desk. I waited exactly thirty seconds after the door clicked shut before reaching for it. The file was comprehensive -birth records, school transcripts, medical history,financial records. James's thoroughness never disappointed. But it was the photographs that caught my attention. Professional headshots from various stages of her career, casual snapshots from social media,family events...
Then I saw it. A photo from Columbia, dated three years ago.Summer and Alexander, standing together on the campus lawn. His arm around her waist, her smile bright and unguarded. The lighting caught her profile perfectly,highlighting the gentle curve of her smile. Something about that smile...

I forced myself to breathe, to examine this visceral reaction with the same analytical precision I applied to market trends. This... irritation at seeing her with Alexander was unexpected. Inconvenient.

Something dark and possessive twisted in my chest. Without hesitation,I tore the photo cleanly in half, separating the sisters. Victoria's half went straight into the trash. Summer's portion, I carefully slid into my wallet,right behind my business cards. *Mine.*

The next photo in the stack showed Summer alone, caught in a candid moment at what appeared to be a charity gala. Her head was turned slightly,profile illuminated by warm lighting, a small smile playing at her lips.

"James." I didn't raise my voice-I never needed to.

He appeared instantly, as if he'd been waiting. He probably had been. "I want Victoria Taylor's complete file. Everything. Especially anything involving Summer." "How soon,sir?" Thirty minutes."
His expression didn't change, but I caught the slight tightening around his eyes. Getting that much information that quickly would be challenging,even for him. "Yes,sir."
I returned to the file, examining the sections about Summer's family dynamics. The patterns were... interesting. The strained relationship with her mother Elizabeth, the complex dynamic with Victoria,the way she'd moved out of the family mansion years ago. But through it all, one connection remained strong-her relationship with Professor Thompson.

*My old mentor. Her beloved grandfather.* The coincidence was too perfect not to use.

A paragraph about a childhood incident caught my eye - something involving Victoria saving Summer's life. *That explains the hold she has over her.* I made a mental note to dig deeper into that particular story.

My phone buzzed with a message from James: "Meeting with Mr. Lee for expedited assistance."

Closing the file, I let my gaze drift to the city skyline beyond my office windows. Somewhere out there, Summer was probably sitting in her office at Fortune Corp, dealing with the whispers and stares that Alexander's betrayal had generated.

*Let them talk,* I thought, my fingers brushing over the photo in my wallet. *Soon enough, they'll have something else entirely to whisper about.*


The intercom buzzed. "Sir? Mr. Lee's team has begun the investigation.The preliminary information about Miss Victoria Taylor will be ready in twenty minutes."

"Good." I didn't bother responding further.

I turned back to the window, watching the morning sun glint off neighboring skyscrapers. The Taylor sisters... such an interesting study in contrasts. Victoria, the favored daughter, perfectly groomed for high society.And Summer...
The memory of her defiant eyes as she rejected my proposal brought an unexpected smile to my lips. *You can run all you want, Summer Taylor.But I've never lost something I truly wanted.*

And I wanted her.
###Chapter 14: Changes

*Summer's POV**
The pristine glass walls of Fortune Corp felt different somehow.Maybe it was the way the morning light hit them, or maybe it was just me. A year in Europe had changed more than just my perspective- it had changed everything I'd once taken for granted. *Even the familiar scent of coffee from the break room seems foreign now,* I thought, adjusting my grip on my bag. The weight of my laptop inside felt like armor against whatever was waiting for me.

My heels clicked against the marble floor as I made my way through the investment division. The sound echoed differently now, like a stranger's footsteps in a place that used to feel like home. New faces looked up as I passed, their expressions a careful mix of curiosity and calculation. *Where are all the familiar faces?*

Sarah's desk - the one by the window where she'd worked for several years-now belonged to someone I didn't recognize. Mark's corner office had a new nameplate: "Daniel Cooper, Senior Investment Manager." Even Lisa, my friend in this office for three years who knew exactly how I liked my coffee,was gone.

*This isn't a coincidence.* My fingers tightened around my portfolio as the realization sank in. One or two personnel changes were normal in a year,but this? This was a systematic purge. *They've been planning this,haven't they? Methodically r emoving everyone loyal to me while I was toofar away to notice.* A polished voice interrupted my thoughts, the tone carrying just enough warmth to seem friendly while remaining professionally distant I turned to find myself facing a woman about my age, dressed in a perfectly tailored suit that probably cost more than most people's monthly salary. Her smile was professional, but something in her eyes reminded me of a cat watching a particularly interesting mouse. *Victoria used to look at me the same way,* Irealized with a jolt. *Right before she'd take something that was mine.*
"Miss Morgan." I kept my voice neutral, professional, even as my stomach tightened with instinctive wariness. "I've heard about your work while I was away." *And about how quickly you aligned yourself with Alexander's interests,* I added silently.

"These are the investment project reports from the past six months." She handed me a thick folder. "Considering you've been in Europe for a year.you might need some time to catch up on headquarters operations. I've prepared detailed materials for your reference."

*Really? How thoughtful of you to remind me that you've been running my department.* The folder felt heavy in my hands, weighted with implications and hidden agendas. I accepted it with a smile that didn't quite reach my eyes, one I'd perfected during countless Wall Street negotiations. "Thank you, Miss Morgan. That's very thorough of you.After all, this is part of your job description."

Something flickered in her expression -annoyance,maybe,or frustration at my lack of reaction. "If there's anything unclear, feel free to ask me. I've been managing all the investment projects this past year."

"Is there anything else, Miss Morgan?" I met her gaze steadily, refusing to be baited. She smiled ágain, all perfect teeth and calculated warmth that never reached her eyes. "Actually, I was thinking we should organize a department dinner tonight? With so many new faces, it would be good for everyone to get better acquainted." Her tone suggested she was doing me a favor, but her eyes held a predator's focus.
The invitation hung in the air between us like a carefully laid trap.*A dinner where I'd be surrounded by Alexander's people, watching them size me up and report back to him? Where every word I say would be dissected and twisted? No thank you.* My chest tightened at the thought of sitting through hours of fake smiles and veiled insults.

"What's wrong, Miss Taylor?" Her tone carried just a hint of challenge.

"I apologize, but my schedule is quite full at the moment." I gave her my best boardroom smle. "I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint everyone."

Before she could respond, a familiar figure appeared at my office door -Old Mr. Stark's secretary, looking as eficiently unreadable as ever. "Miss Taylor? Mr. Stark would like to see you."

"I'll be right there." I nodded at Katherine. "If you'll excuse me,Miss Morgan."

As I followed the secretary toward the executive floor, memories from my last board meeting washed overme. The way Alexander had barely looked at me,how Old Mr. Stark had treated me like a stranger... *God, what a difference a year makes.* I remembered the day Old Mr. Stark had first hinted at a potential marriage between Alexander and me. He'd praised my work ethic,my Columbia education, my family background, his eyes twinkling with paternal warmth. *"You remind me of my late wife,"* he'd said, his eyes warm with approval as he'd studied my face. *"She had that same spark."*Back then, those words had filled me with pride and belonging. Now those same eyes would probably look at me with carefully masked disdain. After all, I was the scandal of Wall Street-the jilted fiancée who'd dared to curse her sister's engagement. The thought made something bitter twist in my stomach.
The secretary gestured to the familiar oak doors. I took a deep breath,straightened my spine, and knocked.

"Come in."

Old Mr. Starksat behind his massive mahogany desk, the Wall Street Journal spread out before him like a judge's verdict. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows behind him, turning him into a silhouette of power and authority. He looked up as I entered, and for a moment, I caught a glimpse of that old warmth in his smile, like an echo of happier times. "Summer, please, have a seat."

"Mr. Stark." I remained standing, maintaining a professional distance."You wanted to see me?"
###Chapter 15: Bribery

**Summer's POV**
"Summer," his voice carried that practiced warmth I'd once found so paternal. "It's been over a year. How are you finding things after Europe?"
I kept my expression professionally neutral, channeling every lesson I'd learned in Columbia's negotiation classes. *Deep breaths. Channel your inner ice queen.* "Everything's fine, Mr. Stark. The European division's performance speaks for itself."

His eyes narrowed slightly at my formal tone. A year ago, I would have called him "Uncle Alex" - the way he'd insisted when Alexander first introduced us. *God, I was so naive back then.*

"Yes, the numbers are... impressive." He shuffled some papers on his desk,though I knew it was just for show. Old Mr. Stark never needed to check numbers - he remembered everything, It was one of the first things Alexander had warned me about. *Another red flag I chose to ignore.*"But that's not why I called you here."

"Oh?" I kept my voice light, professional, even as my stomach twisted with dread. "Is there an issue'with the quarterly reports?"

He sighed, setting aside the pretense of paperwork. "Summer, we need to discuss you and Alexander." "My grandfather specifically asked me not to return yet." The lie slipped out smoothly, but I kept my face straight. *Sorry,Grandpa George,but I need this excuse.* My heart twisted a little at using my grandfather's name this way, but desperate times called for desperate measures. "Mr. Stark." I cut him off before he could continue, my voice sharp enough to make him blink. The mere mention of Alexander's name sent a wave of nausea through me. "This is a work environment. And I have nothing to discuss regarding Alexander." *Nothing except how he and my sister stabbed me in the back,but somehow I doubt that's what you want to hear. "Don't be difficult." His tone hardened slightly. "You know Victoria and Alexander's engagement has put us all in an... awkward position."
*Awkward position?* I had to bite back a bitter laugh. *Is that what we're calling it when your son betrays his fiancée with her own sister? When my entire life gets torn apart and rewritten without my consent?*
"The only awkward position," I said carefully, gripping the arms of my chair to keep my hands from shaking, "is you trying to discuss personal matters during office hours."

His expression darkened. "Have you even been back to the Taylor house since returning? Your family is worried."

I had to hold back a bitter laugh. *Now* I understood his game. Victoria had always been the golden child - after all, Father had given her a 15%stake in the company as her coming-of-age present. And me? I couldn't even get a decent position in the company, let alone any shares. The unfairness of it allburned in my chest like acid.

*Talk about double standards.* When I graduated, Mother had insisted I find my own job, claiming it would build character and teach me independence. Everything I owned paled in comparison to Victoria's possessions. Sometimes I couldn't help but wonder if I was even truly a Taylor at all. *Maybe I was switched at birth. That would explain so much.* "George saidI that?" Something calculated flickered in his eyes. "His birthday celebration is coming up soon. Next week,surely you'll attend?"
I frowned, my stomach tightening. If there was anyone in the Taylor family I truly cared about, it was my paternal Grandpa George. Old Mr.Stark's sudden interest in my family reconciliation had nothing to do with concern for me - he just wanted me to sweet-talk my grandfather into accepting Alexander and Victoria's marriage. *Nice try, but I'm not your puppet anymore.*

"Of course I'll attend my grandfather's birthday." I kept my voice steady,professional, even as anger burned through my veins. "Was there something specific about work you needed to discuss,Mr.Stark?"

He leaned forward, his voice dropping to that conspiratorial tone he used when offering particularly lucrative deals. The same tone he'd used when he first suggested I date Alexander. *Fool me once, shame on you...*"Summer, be reasonable. This situation benefits no one. Just... put in a good word with George about Victoria and Alexander's marriage. Make things smoother for everyone." His smile turned indulgent,like he was offering me a special treat. "I could ensure your promotion to Managing Director in return."

The blatant attempt at bribery made my stomach turn. *So this is what I'm worth to them - a promotion in exchange for helping Victoria steal my life.*The realization felt like swallowing broken glass. "Mr. Stark, are you trying to buy my cooperation with a job title?" circle?"*Family unity - is that what we're calling betrayal these days?* "Don't be crude." His mask slipped slightly, showing a flash of irritation that reminded me so much of Alexander it made my chest ache."I'm offering you an opportunity. Victoria's already received her 15% stake in Capital Corp. Surely you understand the importance of family unity in our "Mr. Stark." I stood up, smoothing my skirt with hands that wanted to shake. "If there's nothing else, I have reports waiting."
"Sit down!" The command cracked through the air like a whip. "You're being unreasonable. This attitude of yours - this is exactly why Elizabeth pushed for you to move out. You never could understand your place in the family."
*My place.* Something cold and hard crystallized in my chest. Years of swallowed hurt and forced smiles solidified into diamond-hard resolve."My place, Mr. Stark? You mean the place where I watch my sister take everything that's mine while smiling gratefully? The place where I trade my self-respect for a promotion?"*The place where I'm supposed to thank you all for treating me like dirt?*

"You ungrateful-" He cut himself off, visibly trying to regain his composure.His face was turning an interesting shade of red. "Summer,think carefully about your next moves. Fortune Corp isn't just any company. Your position here..."

I was done listening to his bullshit. I turned and walked out, my heels clicking against the hardwood floors with military precision. Each step felt like a small victory, even as my heart hammered against my ribs. I made it all the way to my office before my hands started to shake.
###Chapter 16: Ms. Taylor, You'd Like My Help Choosing A Gift?
**Summer's POV**
The smile his words brought to my face faded as soon as I ended the call.*Home.* The word felt different now, heavy with complications I'd never noticed before. Last time I'd been at the Taylor mansion... *No. Don't think about that now.* "Summer." Two days before Grandfather's birthday party, my quiet morning at Fortune Corp was interrupted by a familiar ringtone.
Grandpa George's voice on the phone carried that familiar warmth that always made my heart ache a little. "Come home, dear. Whatever's troubling you, I will stand by your side."

I gripped my phone tight. *I know avoiding things won't soIve anything.No matter what happens, I'm still a member of the Taylor family.* "Of course I'll come, Grandpa. You've always been my strongest support. And how could I miss your birthday? I wasn't here last year - I have to make it up to you properly this time."

"Just having you home is enough." His' tone held a hint of worry that made me feel guilty. "Don't worry about the formalities."

"No way!" I tried to inject some cheerfulness into my voice. "I'm definitely getting you a present that will make you smile."

There was a pause, and I could almost see him shaking his head with that fond exasperation he reserved just for me. "You stubborn child."
###Chapter 16: Ms. Taylor, You'd Like My Help Choosing A Gift?

*Speaking of complications.* Despite my best efforts to avoid Alexander over the past few days, he still managed to find me. I'd carefully timed my movements around the office, taking different routesand skipping the usual lunch spots, but here he was anyway. And I didn't need to turn around to recognize his voice. "I'm working." I kept my eyes fixed on my computer screen, though the quarterly  Christie's elegant interior felt like stepping into another world. The soft lighting caught on glass display cases, making the antiques within gleam with quiet dignity. I wandered between the exhibits, trying to focus on finding the perfect gift for Grandpa rather than the hollow ache in my reports had blurred into meaninglesspatterns.
"We need to talk." His tone carried that particular note of patronizing concern that made my skin crawl. "You can't keep avoiding this conversation forever."
"Actually, I can." I started gathering my things, determined to maintain my composure. "And I will."

"Can't we at least be friends?" The way he said it - like he was being so reasonable, so mature about everything - made something twist painfully in my chest.

"Friends? Seriously?" *He's definitely kidding me.*

His expression shifted to something almost guilty. "Summer, the day after tomorrow is your grandfather's birthday. Victoria and I really want you to come home."


"I will be there." The words came out sharp. "But not for you. Not for her." "Can I help you find something specific, miss?" A sales specialist materialized at my elbow, her smile professional and practiced.
"I'd like to look around myself first, thank you." I tried to project confidence I didn't feel. Better not let them realize I have no idea what I'm doing. Last thing I need is to buy something that makes me look like an amateur in front of Grandpa. Everything looked valuable, but I couldn't tell what would truly catch Grandpa's eye. He had such specific taste in art and antiques - the kind that came from decades of passionate collecting.*Maybe I should have paid more attention during all those times he tried to teach me about them...*

The quiet murmur of conversation died suddenly, like someone had pressed a mute button on the room. I turned, already knowing what I'd find.*Who else could command that kind of attention just by walking into a room?*

Brandon Stark's tall figure cut an imposing silhouette against the evening light streaming through Christie's windows. His dark suit probably cost so much money, butit was the quiet authority in his bearing that drew every eye in the room. James and another man I didn't recognize flanked him like well-trained shadows.


Those dark eyes found mine immediately, and that familiar half-smile played at the corners o his mouth. My pulse jumped traitorously. *Get it together, Summer. He's just another Wall Street titan who happens to keep showing up everywhere,* "Mr. Stark!" The sales specialist who'd approached me earlier practically materialized at Brandon's side. "We've received an exceptional collection of antiques. As per your last request, we've set aside several pieces for your on."
Brandon's gaze never left my face as he addressed her. "Thank you. James will review them shortly." With a subtle gesture, he dismissed his entourage to the waiting area.
My fingers twisted nervously in the strap of my bag as he approached.The evening light caught the sharp angles of his face, somehow making him look even more dangerous than usual. *Why does he have to look like that? It's honestly unfair. Well... I had to admit that he's a bit... stunning.*
"Miss Taylor." His deepo voice carried just a hint of amusement. "What a pleasant surprise."

I straightened my spine, determined to maintain my composure."Mr.Stark. I didn't know you were interested in antiques."

"I know a little." The way he said it suggested he was being modest.Those dark eyes studied my face with unsettling intensity."You seem...lost."

*Was I that obviouas?* "No. I mean..." The words stuck in my throat.*Come on. Summer. Swallow your pride. This is for Grandpa.* "Actually,Mr.Stark,you are right."

One perfect eyebrow arched slightly."Oh?"

"It's my grandfather's birthday in two days." The words came out in a rush. "He's a serious collector, and I want to find something special, but I'm a bit..." I gestured helplessly at the displays around us. *I can't believe I'm actually asking for his help!*

"Ms. Taylor, you'd like my help choosing a gift?" That infuriating half-smile was back, making my stomach do odd flips.
###Chapter 17: A Private Viewing at Christie's


**Summer's POV**
"If it's not too much trouble?" I hated how uncertain my voice sounded."I know you must be busy..."
His dark eyes held mine for a long moment, and I fought the urge to fidget under that intense gaze. "Not at all, Miss Taylor. It would be my pleasure."

His dark eyes studied me with that unsettling intensity I was starting to recognize. "What kind of gift did you have in mind for Mr. Taylor?"

"Maybe a painting, or another suitable collection piece?" I kept my voice carefully casual, though my heart was doing odd little flips under his scrutiny. "Grandpa George has always loved collecting art. His taste is quite similar to Grandpa Jonathan's, actually." *There. A subtle hint about their shared interests. That should help him choose.*

Brandon's expression shifted almost imperceptibly. "James."

His assistant materialized beside us with that eerily efficient silence I was beginning to associate with him. "Yes, sir?"

"Have Christie's manager prepare the special collection."

I caught the flash of surprise that crossed James's face before he could mask it. His eyes darted to me for just a moment before quickly looking away. I offered a polite smile, more out of habit than anything else.

Brandon's brow furrowed slightly- the tiniest movement that nonetheless made James straighten his spine and school his features into perfect neutrality. "Right away, sir." James's voice was crisp and professional as he turned to carry out the order.
I watched Brandon lean against one of the display cases with casual grace,wondering how he managed to make even that simple action look like something from a luxury advertisement.
"Sir, everything is ready." James's voice broke through my thought.

Brandon's eyes found mine. "Please." He gestured toward a doorway I hadn't noticed before, his hand coming to hover near the small of my back without quite touching me.
The private viewing room took my breath away. If the main gallery was impressive, this space was extraordinary. Elegant wood paneling lined the walls, providing a perfect backdrop for costly artwork. The lighting was perfectly calibrated to showcase each piece, creating an atmosphere of hushed reverence.

I was so caught up in examining a particularly striking oil painting that I almost missed the sound of the door closing. When I turned, I realized James and the Christie's manager had disappeared, leaving me alone with Brandon. The room suddenly felt much smaller.

"My grandfather has a rare early Monet in his collection," I said quickly,desperate to fill the loaded silence. Then I made the mistake of meeting Brandon's gaze. The intensity in those dark eyes made my pulse skip, and I quickly looked away, heat creeping up my neck. "Oh... where did James and the manager go?" "See anything you like?" He didn't answer my question. "I... not yet. I'm not very familiar with fine art." I hated how breathless I sounded. "Perhaps you could walk me through these pieces,Mr.Stark?"

A rare smile tugged at his lips, transforming his usually stern features into something that made my heart do a complicated gymnastics routine in my chest. *God, he should come with a warning label when he does that.*
"Mr. Stark?" I prompted when he didn't respond immediately, trying to ignore how the roomn's intimate lighting seemed to soften the sharp angles of his face.
"My pleasure," The words rolled off his tongue like velvet, dark and rich with promise. A little pause, then: "Let me show you something."
I followed him to a wall where several paintings hung in perfect lighting.His arm brushed mine as he gestured to a particularly striking piece,and I had to suppress a shiver at the contact.

"Early 18th century," he explained, his deep voice taking on a scholarly tone that somehow made him even more attractive. "Notice the brushwork here." His hand traced the air just above the canvas,drawing my attention to subtle details I would have missed.

*Focus on the art, not his hands,* I told myself firmly. But it was impossible not to notice how those elegant fingers moved with such precision, how his whole demeanor shifted when discussing the artwork.


"The artist was relatively unknown in his time," Brandon continued, "but his technique was revolutionary. See how the light falls across the landscape?" He leaned closer, "It creates a depth that was unusual for that period." "It's beautiful," I managed, though I wasn't entirely sure if I was talking about the painting or the way his eyes lit up with genuine passion as he explained its significance.
Then he surveyed the room slowly, his movements deliberate and graceful.When his gaze settled on something near the far wall, I followed his line of sight to a chess set displayed in an antique case.
The chess set was breathtaking - each piece crafted in pure silver, the workmanship so fine it looked almost alive. A small placard identified it as a 19th-century piece from the British Royal Collection. Just looking at it made my palms sweat.*That's probably worth more than my entire apartment building.*
"Does Professor Taylor enjoy chess?" Brandon's question was casual,but something in his tone made me look up sharply.
I couldn't quite hide my awe at the chess set, but practicality won out."That's... that's far too extravagant. Perhaps we should look at something else?"

His lips curved into that infuriating half-smile that never failed to make my pulse race. "Too extravagant for your grandfather? Or for you,Miss Taylor?"

The way he said my name - soft but somehow intense - made me acutely aware of how alone we were in this beautiful room full of priceless treasures. *Focus, Summer. You're here to buy a gift, not get lost in Brandon Stark's eyes. Even if they do look particularly dangerous in this lighting.* I moved toward a collection of smaller paintings, putting some much-needed distance between us. "Mr. Stark, I appreciate your help, but I'm looking for something... reasonable." *Something that won't make me feel like I'm accepting another form of proposal.* "Reasonable." He repeated the word like he was tasting it,finding it wanting."An interesting choice of word, Miss Taylor."
###Chapter 18: Walking Into His Trap

**Summer's POV**

I followed him around the room, listening as he explained the significance of various artworks. His knowledge was impressive, but what caught me off guard was his obvious passion for the subject. This wasn't the cool,calculating CEO of Stark Group- this was someone who genuinely loved art and its history.

"You know so much about all of this,"I remarked as he finished explaining the historical context of a particularly valuable sculpture.

"Art tells us about more than just beauty," he replied, his voice taking on that velvet-soft quality that made my skin prickle. "It tells us about desire,obsession, the lengths people will go to possess something they consider precious."

*Why do I feel like we're not just talking about art anymore?* "That's quite philosophical,Mr.Stark."

Brandon's eyes held that dangerous glint I was starting to recognize all too well as he swept his hand across the private viewing room. "So, that piece?Or perhaps the Royal Collection chess set? I think they are both quite good.-


We were standing close enough that I had to tilt my head back to meet his eyes. "Your grandfather would appreciate the historical significance of that piece," he said softly. "But this piece has another interesting feature." "Oh?" My voice came out embarrassingly breathy. Brandon's lips curved into that dangerous half-smile. "The artist painted it for the woman he loved. It's said he spent months perfectingevery detail,wanting to capture the exact way light fell across the hills near her home."

The intensity in his dark eyes made my pulse race. "That's... quite romantic," I said, trying to keep my voice steady.

"Indeed." His eyes never left mine. "So, do you think that is a reasonable gift? No?"

I shook my head. "Mr. Stark, I-"

"There's more to see," he cut me off smoothly, already moving toward another display. *Okay, he must have known that I simply cannot afford them.*


His gaze traveled around the room before suddenly stopping. "Perhaps this would be more suitable."


I followed him to a display case, curious despite my better judgment.Inside sat what appeared to be a relatively simple fountain pen. The design was classic and elegant - exactly the kind of thing Grandpa George would appreciate. He'd always loved writing with fountain pens,claiming they gave his thoughts the proper weight on paper.

*Finally, something that doesn't look like it costs more than my apartment.*I studied the pen more closely, admiring how the light caught its understated gold accents. The craftsmanship was clearly exceptional, but in a way that spoke of quality rather than ostentation. "This one," I said firmly. "It's perfect for Grandpa." "Have it wrapped for Miss Taylor." Brandon's deep voice carried that note of absolute authority that seemed to make everyone around him snap to attention. The manager hesitated."This...um..."

"Is there a problem?" I asked, my stomach sinking. *Please don't let it be astronomically expensive. I've already blown through so much of my savings moving out of the family mansion.*

"No, no!" The manager's smile looked slightly strained as his eyes darted between Brandon and me. "If Miss Taylor likes it, I'll have it wrapped right away."

I watchedthe staff handle the pen with almost reverent care, which did nothing to ease my growing suspicion about its true value. *It's fine. I'm an Executive Director at Fortune Corp. I can handle this.* Even if I had to eat instant ramen for a month, Grandpa was worth it.

A familiar anxiety gnawed at my stomach - the same feeling I'd had when signing the lease for my new apartment. Every major purchase now came with a mental calculation of how many extra hours I'd need to work, how many luxuries I'd need to cut back on. Gone were the days when I could swipe the Taylor family credit card. *But isn't this better? No strings attached, no obligations, no having to smile and nod while Victoria gets everything handed to her on a silver platter.*

"Manager," I squared my shoulders, "how much is the pen?"

"Let James handle the payment details." Brandon's tone brooked no argument. My protests died in my throat as he turned those dark eyes on me. "Miss Taylor, after all my assistance today, perhaps you'd like to show your appreciation?" Heat crept up my neck. *Was this his plan all along?* "I... I could treat Mr. Stark to dinner?"

The smile that curved his lips made my heart do a complicated gymnastics routine. "I'd be delighted to accept Miss Taylor's invitation."

"But Mr. Stark, I haven't paid yet!" I protested weakly as he guided me toward the exit.


James materialized beside us with his usual eerie efficiency. "Miss Taylor,please go ahead with Mr. Stark. I'll handle everything here and arrange delivery of your gift. You can pay the bill later. It's all right."

As Brandon led me out of Christie's, I couldn't shake the feeling that I'd just walked into an expertly laid trap. Everything had happened so smoothly,like pieces moving across a chessboard according to some master plan.

Brandon's hand at my elbow guided me through Christie's elegant doors and into the cool evening air. My mind was spinning with questions and suspicions, but something told me I wouldn't get straight answers even if I asked.


He stopped so suddenly I nearly ran into his back. "What are you thinking?"

I stumbled slightly, catching myself just before colliding with his impossibly expensive suit. "I... where would Mr. Stark like to have dinner?" His dark eyes studied my face with that intensity that never failed to make my pulse race. Something about his expression made me wonder if I'd just agreed to much more than a simple thank-you dinner. *What have I gotten myself into?*
###Chapter 19: It's Just You

*Summer's POV*

"Since it's your treat, Miss Taylor, it is naturally your choice." His deep voice carried just a hint of amusement.

I fought the urge to fidget with my bag strap. *God, what do you even suggest to someone like Brandon Stark? The places I usually eat probably don't even register on his radar.* "As long as you don't mind..." My voice trailed off uncertainly.

Something flickered in his expression - understanding.maybe,or something deeper. "Miss Taylor, you seem to have some misconceptions about me." His tone softened slightly. "I'm not as unapproachable as you might think." He made an elegant gesture toward the street. "Please."

The way he said it - like he was trying to put me at ease while simultaneously maintaining that aura of absolute control that seemed to come as naturally to him as breathing. *How does he do that? Make even a simple word soundI like both an invitation and a command?*

To my surprise, instead of the imposing Bentley from our first meeting, a sleek but relatively understated luxury car waited at the curb.*Ishe...trying to make me feel more comfortable?* The thought made something warm flutter in my chest. Brandon moved with that predatory grace to open the passenger door for me, waiting with surprising patience as I settled into the butter-soft leather seat. The door closed with a soft click that somehow managed to sound expensive, and I watched through the window as he rounded the hood to the driver's side. *Even walking to a car, he moves like he owns the whole street. Which, given this is Manhattan, he probably does.* He slid into the driver's seat with fluid elegance, the movement drawing my attention to the perfect cut of his suit. *Stop staring at him like a teenager with a crush,* I scolded myself, quickly looking away.

"Miss Taylor, please direct me."

"116th Street, thank you." I kept my voice steady, professional. *Just because he's being nice doesn't mean anything has changed. He's still Brandon Stark, and I'm still...*

"Near Columbia?" His question interrupted my spiral of self-doubt.

I turned to him in surprise, catching that familiar glint of amusement in his dark eyes. "Miss Taylor seems to have forgotten - I attended Columbia as well."

*Right. Of course he did.* The reminder of our shared alma mater somehow made the space between us feel both smaller and more charged.The soft glow from the dashboard caught the sharp angles of his face as he programmed the navigation system, and I had to force myself to look away.

We rode in comfortable silence for a while, the lights of Manhattan sliding past the windows like stars. The car's interior smelled faintly of leather and his perfume.

"It's been years since I've been back to Columbia," he said suddenly, his deep voice thoughtful, "I wonder how much it's changed." "You haven't visited?" The question slipped out before I could stop it,genuine curiosity overriding my usual caution. *I'm the sentimental type-whether it's people, places, or things, I get attached.* I thought about my own habits, how I made a point to visit several times a year, always stopping by the campus food trucks and small restaurants nearby to relive those carefree college days.

His expression shifted slightly, becoming more guarded. "Work keeps me busy. Besides, I'm not one to dwell on the past."

The way he looked at me as he said it - like the words carried some deeper meaning - made my heart skip a beat. I turned to watch the city lights blur past the window, trying to gather my thoughts. "Everyone has a past."

"True." His voice took on that velvet-soft quality that never failed to make my skin prickle. "But letting it control your present and future? That's a mistake, don't you think?"

"Mr. Stark, you should be a lawyer. Or maybe a therapist." I tried to inject some lightness into my voice, desperate to break the intensity of the moment.


One perfect eyebrow arched slightly. "Oh? Why is that?"

I studied his profile in the passing streetlights,gathering my thoughts."Your way with words," I said finally. "You have this way of making complicated things sound simple. When you talk about the past or the future... you make it sound like everything has a clear solution. Like life's big problems arejust... puzzles waiting to be solved." *God, I'm rambling.* But something about the quiet intimacy of the car, the way his presence seemed to fill the space without being overwhelming, made me want to keep talking. "It's... comforting, actually. Even when you're being infuriatingly cryptic." His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile I was starting to know too well. "Life is a series of puzzles. Miss Taylor." His deep voice carried an edge of intensity that made my skin prickle. "The key is knowing which ones are worth solving." The way his dark eyes flickered to me made it clear this wasn't just about metaphors anymore.

"Are you always like this?" The words came out more vulnerable than I'd intended, "I mean... when you are comforting someone else?"

His fingers tapped a gentle rhythm against the steering wheel as he considered his response. When he finally spoke, his voice carried a weight that made my breath catch. "No. There is no 'always."

I waited for him to elaborate, but he remained silent, those dark eyes focused on the road ahead. The city lights played across his sharp features,highlighting the perfect line of his jaw. *God, I hate his pause.*

"Mr.Stark-"

"And. there is no 'someone else'." He cut me off, his voice carrying that note of absolute certainty I was starting to associate with him. "It's just you.
###Chapter 20: Your Boyfriend Looks Amazing

*Summer's POV**

His words hung in the air between us, making my heart skip several beats.It's just you. The weight of those three simple words seemed to fill the entire car, and I found myself staring out the window, desperately trying to collect my thoughts.

The soft purr of Brandon's car faded to background noise as we drove through familiar Manhattan streets.

"Mr. Stark," I said, desperate to break the loaded silence, "did you ever visit the food streets near Columbia when you were a student?" The question came out more abrupt than I'd intended, but anything was better than sitting here hyperaware of his presence.

He turned those dark eyes on me, one perfect eyebrow arching slightly. "Skipping classes?"

"What? No!" Heat flooded my cheeks as I rushed to explain. "We always went after classes! I would never-" I cut myself off, realizing I was only making it worse. *Great job, Summer. Really selling that responsible student image.* The corner of his mouth lifted in that infuriating half-smile that never failed to make my pulse skip. He looked different here, away from the cut-throat atmosphere of Wall Street - more relaxed, almost playful.*Stop noticing things like that.* When we reached Columbia's campus, he started to say, "You can go ahead while I park-" "No!" I interrupted. then quickly modulated my tone. "I mean,you might not know where to go. You should just drive in."


He studied me for a moment, then nodded. Something about the way he looked at me made my skin prickle with awareness. *Focus on giving directions. Left turn, right turn, parking spot. Simple.*

I waited under a towering ginkgo tree while he parked, absently tapping my foot against the pavement. The late afternoon sun filtered through the leaves,casting dancing shadows on the ground. When I looked up. I found Brandon watching me with an expression I couldn't quite read.

"This way!" I called, trying to ignore how my voice wanted to shake under his intense gaze.

He approached with that fluid grace that seemed to come so naturally to him. "Would you like a tour?"

I shook my head quickly. "Maybe another time. Let's get food while it's still quiet - once classes let out, the lines get crazy."

The streets around Columbia hadn't changed much since my student days.The same mix of trendy cafes and hole-in-the-wall gems lined the sidewalks, the air rich with competing food aromas. I led Brandon to my favorite spot, a tiny place that always had a line during peak hours. "Oh! Someone's leaving!" Without thinking, I grabbed Brandon's hand to pull him toward the newly vacant table. His fingers were warm against mine, and something about the contact sent electricity dancing up my arm.When I realized what I'd done, I quickly dropped his hand, heat creeping up my neck.He didn't move to sit, and I suddenly worried he was having second thoughts about the decidedly un-Wall Street atmosphere. "Is something wrong?"


"No." But he still didn't sit.

*Oh god, he probably thinks it's dirty.* I grabbed some napkins and carefully wiped down the chair. "There! All clean nowv, Mr.Stark."

The look he gave me made my breath catch - something between amusement and something darker that I didn't dare analyze. *Stop imagining things.*


"We can go somewhere else," I offered quickly. "There's a nice restaurant just-"


He sat down before I could finish, that half-smnile playing at his lips. "This is perfect."


"Summer!" The owner's enthusiastic voice made me jump. "Long time no see!" Her eyes darted between Brandon and me, a knowing smile spreading across her face. "And who's this? Your boyfriend?"

"No, he's-" I started to explaín, but Brandon smoothly cut me off by handing me a menu.

"Shall we order?" His voice was perfectlycasual, but something in his eyes made my pulse skip. I accepted the menu gratefully, though the familiar text blurred before my eyes. "Um, their cheese steak sandwich is famous. It's a student favorite."

 "What do you usually get?" The gentle interest in his voice made something warm unfurl in my chest. "The cheese steak, actually." I couldn't help smiling at the memories."They slice the beef fresh, and their secret cheese sauce is amazing. Imissed it so much when I was in Europe."

Brandon turned to the owner, his deep voice carrying that natural authority that probably made Wall Street titans weak in the knees."Two cheese steak sandwiches." His eyes found mine again. "Drinks?"

"Their herbal tea is really nice..." I trailed off, suddenly remembering who I was talking to. *He probably thinks I'm crazy, suggesting street food tea to Brandon Stark.*

"Two herbal teas, please." He didn't even hesitate.

The owner beamed. "Coming right up!" She threw me a not-so-subtle wink as she turned away.

I could hear the whispers from nearby tables, mostly from female students:

"Oh my god, look at him!"

"He's even hotter than those Hollywood stars..."

I tried to focus on arranging my napkin, but I couldn't help stealing glances at Brandon. *They're not wrong,* my traitorous mind supplied. In this setting, away from the sterile perfection of Wall Street, he looked even more striking -like a lion who'd decided to grace a local cafe with his presence.

"See something you like?" His voice carried just a hint of teasing.

Heat flooded my cheeks. "Mr. Stark is being very conceited!"

"Confident," he corrected, dark eyes glinting with amusement. "Didn't you hear their assessment?"

"They're just... dazzled by appearances." *Like I apparently am. Stop it.*

The owner returned with our food,giving Brandon another appreciative look. "Your boyfriend is so handsome!"

"Thank you." His response was smooth and natural, making my heart do a complicated flip.

I staredat my sandwich, which was easily twice the normal size and overflowing with beef. "This is... excessive."

Brandon dabbed his lips with a napkin, the gesture somehow elegant even in this casual setting. "Is something wrong?"

"The portions are never this big normally." I couldn't help laughing.Apparently good looks do buy special treatment."

His eyes caught mine, dancing with barely suppressed mirth. "Miss Taylor,was that a compliment?"

"I was commenting on the restaurant's double standards!" I protested,realizing too late what I'd implied.

"So you agree that I'm..." He paused deliberately. "Handsome?"
###Chapter 21: When I Was in College, You Wer e Just a Little Girl
**Summer's POV**

"I didn't say that!" MMy face felt like it was on fire.

He leaned back, clearly enjoying my discomfort. "I believe you just did."

I stirred my tea with probably more force than necessary, refusing to meet his amused gaze. "Mr. Stark is becoming quite impossible."

"I'm simply seeking clarity on Miss Taylor's opinion." His voice carried a warmth I wasn't used to hearing. "HIonesty is a virtue, after all."

The familiar buzz of campus life wrapped around us like a warm blanket as students hurried past our table. I couldn't help stealing glances at Brandon between bites of my sandwich. He carried himself with that natural elegance that probably came from a lifetime of private schools and privilege.

*I bet the last time he ate anything this cheap was... well, was he ever a normal student?* The image of a teenage Brandon in this same restaurant almost made me laugh. *Though knowing himn,he probably had his own private chef even back then.*

"What?" His dark eyes caught mine, making my pulse skip.*Great,he caught me staring.*"Nothing!" I said quickly - too quickly. My cheeks felt warm as I scrambled for an explanation. "It's just... I mean, this isn't exactly the kind of place someone like you usually..." I trailed off, not sure how to finish that thought without sounding ridiculous. *Someone like you-why did I phrase it like that? As if Brandon Stark needs reminding that he's different
from normal people.*

The corner of his mouth lifted in that dangerous half-smile. "Someone like me?"

Heat crept up my neck. "You know what I mean. Wall Street titans don't usually grab cheese steaks at student hangouts."

"And yet," his voice carried just a hint of amusement, "here I am."

I glanced at my watch, anxiety suddenly spiking as I imagined the upcoming rush of students. *The last thing Brandon Stark needs is to be surrounded by starstruck college kids with smartphones.* His presence already drew enough attention - I'd noticed at least three girls at nearby tables sneaking photos. "It's getting late - the students will be out of class soon! We should probably..." *God, I sound like I'm trying to get rid of him. Am I trying to get rid of him?*

The familiar chime of a phone cut through my rambling. *Saved by the bell - literally.* Brandon pulled out his phone with that effortless grace that seemed to accompany his every movement.

"Sir," James's efficient voice carried clearly across the table. "Miss Taylor's gift has been prepared."

"We're at Columbia." Brandon's response was brief, his eyes finding mine. "Where are you headed after this, Miss Taylor?" "Home." I fiddled with my napkin, avoiding his intense gaze. "You don't need to trouble yourself, Mr. Stark. James can just deliver it later.""That won't be necessary." The finality in his tone brooked no argument. When he stood to pay. I scrambled to my feet. "Mr. Stark, I agreed to treat you! I know it's not a fancy restaurant, but this meal was supposed to be my thank you."


Those dark eyes studied me with an intensity that mnade my skin prickle."Letting a lady pay? That's not how I do things."


"But-" My protest died as he moved past me with that predatory grace.heading for the counter with the kind of confidence that probably got him everything he wanted in life.

*He does this every time,* I thought, watching him handle the payment with efficient authority. *Somehow manages to get his way without making it feel like a power play.*

The setting sun painted golden streaks across the campus grounds as we stepped outside. Brandon paused, his dark eyes taking in the familiar architecture. "Would you like to walk for a bit? I wonder how the campus looks like now."

I hesitated, surprised by the suggestion. But something in his expression -a rare softness that seemed at odds with his usual intensity - made me nod."Sure."

My heels clicked against the familiar pathways as we walked, each step bringing back memories of rushed morning classes and late-night study sessions. The evening air carried the scent of autumn, crisp and full of possibility.

"Mr. Stark," I ventured, curiosity finally overcoming caution, "you don't seem that much older than me, but I know pretty much all of Grandpa's students.How come I've never seen you before? Which year were you?" He paused for a moment, something unreadable flickering across his face."When I was in college, you were probably still a little girl."

"That's impossible!" I couldn't help laughing. "I'm 25, and you can't be that much older than me!"


The way he looked at me then - like he was enjoying some private joke -made my pulse skip. "You can ask Professor Thompson if you don't believe me. I only spent two years here. Entered at 15, which would have made you... what, seven or eight?"

The words hit me like a physical shock. "How is that possible? You must have been some kind of genius!"

Something shifted in his expression at the word 'genius'- a darkness passing behind those eyes like a storm cloud across the sun. "Genius?"

The weight he gave that single word made me pause. *There's a story there,* I realized. *Something about that word means more to him than he s letting on.*

A memory suddenly surfaced - fragments of conversations I'd overheard as a child, trailing after Grandpa through the halls of Columbia. His colleagues talking about some prodigy, lamenting how he could have been the university's brightest star if he hadn't left for London. I remembered how Grandpa's expression would turn wistful whenever the subject came up. how he'd spoken of lost potential and missed opportunities. *Was that... Brandon? All this time, those stories were about him?* His phone buzzed again, breaking the moment. "James is waiting in the parking lot." We made our way toward the parking lot, our footsteps falling into an easy rhythm. The campus had grown quieter now, most students already headed home or to the library. I snuck a glance at Brandon's profile.noting how different he looked here - less like the intimidating CEO of Stark Group and more like someone who might have once walked these same paths as a student, albeit an extraordinarily young one.

James stood by a sleek black car, his professional mask firmly in place. "Miss Taylor,your gift."

"Thank you!" I accepted the elegantly wrapped package, then remembered the whole point of this excursion. "How much do I owe you?"

The moment I saw the number on the bill James handed me, my heart nearly stopped. *This can't be right. Howis it so cheap? A pen from Christie's should cost way more than this.* Even with my limited knowledge of luxury goods, I knew something was off. The price was barely a fifth of what I'd expected - still expensive, but nowhere near what a Christie's piece should cost.

"This... there must be some mistake?" I looked between James and Brandon, trying to read their expressions.
###Chapter 22: Eavesdropping

**Summer's POV**

James cleared his throat, his eyes darting to Brandon for a fraction of a second. "Miss Taylor, you may not be aware, but Mr. Stark is a valued client of Christie's. The store places great importance on their relationship with Stark Group." He hesitated, then added quickly, "The pen isn't one of their more significant pieces. In fact, the manager wantedI to offer it as a complimentary-"

"James." Brandon's voice cut through the explanation like a steel blade.James fell silent immediately, and I couldn't blame him. Even that single word carried enough authority to make my skin prickle.

I bit my lip, mentally calculating my savings. Even at this suspiciously low price,it would still make a significant dent. "The account detaiIs..."

"That can wait." Brandon's tone brooked no argument. "Let me drive you home."

Something flickered across James's face - relief, maybe? "Sir, I just remembered there's an urgent matter at the office that requires attention."

I watched James make his suspiciously hasty retreat, leaving me alone with Brandon. Again. *How does this keep happening?*

"Mr. Stark,you really don't have to-"

"Get in." He was already moving toward the car, his long stride purposeful and elegant. On the day of Grandpa's birthday, I found myself driving toward the Taylor mansion, my stomach doing nervous flips despite my best efforts to stay calm. I'd deliberately left early, hoping to avoid the usual family dramatics, but apparently everyone else had the same idea.

The long driveway leading to the mansion was already lined with luxury cars - Bentleys, Rolls-Royces, and enough Mercedes to fill a dealership.*Looks like the whole of Manhattan's elite decided to show up.* I couldn't help but laugh at the irony as I pulled over to the side of the road,realizing there was no way I'd find parking closer to the house.

*Great. Now I get to walk in these heels.* At least I'd had the foresight to bring a pair of flats in my bag. The Taylor mansion's imposing facade loomed ahead, a stark reminder of everything I'd left behind. White roses adorned every visible surface, and an army of staff bustled about, making last-minute preparations.

I'd barely made it halfway up the winding path when voicescaught my attention - hushed but intense, coming from behind one of the massive topiaries. Mother's distinctive tone made me freeze in my tracks.

"That ungrateful girl better not cause any trouble tomorrow." Her voice dripped with familiar venom. "After everything we've done for her..."

"Elizabeth." Father's tone carried a warning. "Not here. The guests might hear." "I don't care! Do you know how many times Victoria has tried to reach out? Always coming back in tears. And Summer just..." Mother's voice cracked with what might have been genuine emotion if I didn't know better. "We raised her, gave her everything, and this is how she repays us?" I quickly stepped behind a nearby hedge, heart hammering.Through the perfectly manicured branches, I could see Mother's agitated pacing and Father's stiff posture. *They're so caught up in their plotting they haven't even noticed me.*


"Lower your voice." Father's words came out clipped and tense."You know how Father feels about Summer. If she makes a scene tomorrow..."

"That's exactly my point!" Mother's whisper had taken on a frantic edge."Your father needs to accept Victoria and Alexander's marriage. But every time someone mentions it, he gets that look - like he's about to cut off their inheritance right there!"

"What do you expect?" Father's voice had dropped even lower. "After what Alexander did..."

"Oh, please." Mother's scoff was painfuly familiar. "Summer should be grateful anyone wanted to marry her at all. Victoria is doing her a favor,taking that burden off our hands. But no, she has to play the victim,crying to your father about betrayal..."

I felt the blood drain from my face, my fingers digging into the rough stone of the wall. *So that's what they really think of me.*

"She's always been like this." Mother's voice had taken on that particular tone she reserved for discussing my failures. "Remember when she insisted on getting a job instead of just marrying well like Victoria? So stubborn, so...common. Nothing like her sister."

"Elizabeth." Father sounded tired. "Not now. We need to focus on getting Father's approval for the marriage. Once that's done..."

"Right, right." Mother's voice shifted to something more calculating."Did you call Summer? Make sure she's coming?" "T'll do it now."

As if on cue, my phone started vibrating in my bag. I fumbled to silence it before the sound could give away my position, but Father's name was already lit up on the screen. *Perfect timing as always, Dad.* After a moment's hesitation, I answered - not answering would only make them more suspicious.

"Hello?" I kept my voice carefully neutral, moving further away from their hiding spot.

"Summer, where are you?" Father's fake warmth was almost painful to hear now. "Your grandfather keeps asking about you. We're all family here -whatever misunderstandings there are, we can work them out face to face. If you have any grievances, you can tell your grandfather, right? Don't make him sad on his birthday..."

The casual manipulation in his tone made something twist in my chest.All those years of thinking I just wasn't good enough, that I needed to try harder to earn their love... *God, I was so blind.*

"I know." My voice came out steadier than I felt. "Of course I'll be at Grandpa's birthday party. As for my grievances, Dad, do you really not know what they are?" A pause, then his tone shifted to something more authoritative. "What are you talking about? You're my daughter- Richard Taylor's daughter.If anyone's wronged you, I will make it right. Stop being difficult and come home!" "Home?" The word tasted bitter on my tongue. "I'll be there. For Grandpa." I ended the call before he could respond, my hands shaking slightly as I gripped my phone. Their voices had shifted to discussing seating arrangements and guest lists, the same calculating precision in their tone as when they'd been dissecting my failures.

Straightening my dress, I took a deep breath and started walking toward the mansion's main entrance. My mind was spinning with everything I'd just heard. *They're really using Grandpa's birthday to force his approval of Victoria and Alexander's marriage.* The realization made me feel sick. *Even this - even Grandpa's happiness - is just another thing for them to manipulate.*

As I approached the grand doors,already propped open to welcome the steady stream of guests, one thought kept echoing in my mind: *This party is going to be interesting.*
###Chapter 23: Family Reunion

**Summer's POV**

"Miss Summer!"

Jenkins's familiar voice made me turn. The old butler's face lit up with genuine warmth as he hurried toward me, his usual formal demeanor softening. "You shouldn't be standing out here in this weather. Come inside quickly!"

"Jenkins." Just seeing his kind face made my eyes sting. He'd been more of a parent to me than Elizabeth or Richard ever were. "How's Grandpa?"

"Mr. Taylor has been asking about you all day." He took my bag with practiced efficiency, leading me toward the garden path. "He'll be overjoyed to see you."

I followed Jenkins through the back gardens, grateful for his thoughtfulness in choosing this route. The smell of late roses mixed with the earthy scent of autumn, bringing back memories of childhood afternoons spent hiding among these same hedges with my books.*Before Victoria learned to use my secrets against me. Before Alexander...*

"Has he been taking his medicine?" I asked quickly, pushing away the unwanted thoughts.

"Religiously." Jenkins's voice carried a hint of amusement. "Though he complains about it every morning. Some things never change."

We passed the conservatory where Mother used to host her tea parties,showing off Victoria's latest achievements while pointedly ignoring my existence. Through the glass, I could see staff members arranging elaborate flower displays. *White roses. Victoria's favorite. Of course.*

"The preparations seem... extensive." I kept my voice carefully neutral.

Jenkins's expression remained professional, but something flickered in his eyes. "Indeed. Mrs. Taylor has invited quite a few guests from Wall Street.Something about expanding the family's investment portfolio."

*Using Grandpa's birthday to court investors. How very Elizabeth.* The bitterness must have shown on my face because Jenkins quickly added,"He is in his study. He specifically asked me to bring you to him as soon as I see you."

My heart warmed at that. Even now, Grandpa George was looking out for me,creating a safe space away from the circus downstairs. As we climbed the familiar stairs to the second floor, I could hear voices drifting up from the main hall - Mother's practiced laugh, Victoria's melodic tones, the general buzz of Manhattan's elite doing what they did best: networking and judging.

Jenkins stopped outside the heavy oak door of Grandpa's study,giving me an encouraging smile.

"Summer?" Grandpa George's voice carried through the door,still strong despite his age. "Is that you?"

Taking a deep breath, I knocked softly. "Yes, Grandpa. It's me." "Come in,come in!"The study looked exactly as I remembered - walls lined with books and art.the massive desk dominating one end, comfortable leather chairs arranged near the fireplace. The only difference was the new painting propped against one wall, its protective wrapping only partially removed. Grandpa stood from his desk chair, his face lighting up with genuine joy."Finally! I was beginning to think you'd changed your mind."

"And miss your birthdlay?" I crossed the room quickly, letting him pull me into a tight hug. He smelled the same as always - a mix of old book and that indefinable scent that just meant *home*."Never."

"Let me look at you." He held me at arm's length, his keen eyes taking in every detail. "You've lost weight. Are they working you too hard at Fortune Corp?"

I thought of what my parents had just said in the garden, feeling down.For a moment I forgot to respond.

Grandpa's grip on my shoulders tightened slightly. "You don't have to go down there if you don't want to. We can have our own celebration up here."


"This is your birthday party, Grandpa." I forced a smile, though my heart was racing at the thought of facing them all. "I won't let them drive me away."

His expression softened with understanding and something that might have been pride. "My brave girl." He gestured to one of the leather chairs."Sit with me for a moment. Tell me what's really going on in that brilliant mind of yours."I sank into the familiar comfort of the chair, watching as he settled into his usual spot by the fireplace. For a moment, it felt like nothing had changed -like I was still that little girl coming to him with scraped knees and hurt feelings, knowing he'd make everything better. "Summer." His voice grew serious. "If you still have feelings for Alexander-"

"No!" The word came out sharper than I intended. Taking a breath,I modulated my tone. "No, Grandpa. That's not... A man who could betray me like that isn't worth a second thought."

"Good." He nodded approvingly. "You deserve so much better than a man who can't recognize your worth."

Before I could respond, Jenkins knocked softly. "Sir? Mr. Richard Taylor asks that you and Miss Summer join the party. The guests are asking for you."

Grandpa's expression darkened slightly. "Tell my son-"

"It's okay." I stood, smoothing my dress. "We should go down. This is your party,after all."

The halls of the Taylor mansion seemed longer than I remembered as we made our way downstairs, the sound of the party growing louder with each step. Grandpa's hand found mine, giving it a reassuring squeeze.*At least I'm not facing this alone.*

The ballroom was a sea of designer suits and evening gowns, the air thick with expensive perfume and carefully crafted laughter. As we entered, I felt rather than saw the ripple of attention - the subtle shift in conversations, the quick glances,the barely concealed whispers.

"There you are!" Richard's voice carried across the room, forcefully cheerful."We were starting to worry."

I felt Grandpa's hand tighten on mine as my father approached, Victoria and Alexander trailing in his wake like perfectly trained show dogs. The sight of them together still had the power to make my chest ache, but the pain was different now - more like the phantom sting of an old wound than the raw agony it had once been.
"Summer." Alexander's voice carried that particular note of condescension that I'd somehow never noticed before. "You look... well."

Victoria's smile was picture-perfect as she clung to his arm. "We've missed you,sister dear. Haven't we,darling?"

The endearment hit like a slap. I watched them standing there, so pleased with themselves, so certain of their victory. *They really think they can just rewrite history, don't they? Make me the villain in their little love story.*

"Have you?" My voice came out cool and steady, surprising even myself.How thoughtful of you both to care so much about my wellbeing. Though I can't help but wonder- when exactly did this concern develop? Before or after you decided to announce your engagement while I was overseas?"

Victoria's perfect smile falteredI for just a moment. "Summer, darling, you're not still bitter about that, are you? We only want what's best for everyone."

"What's best?" I couldn't help the bitter laugh that escaped. "Is that what we're calling it now?"

"That's enough." Ríchard's voice cracked like a whip. "This is your grandfather's birthday celebration. I believe you have brought enough shame on this family. Save your dramatics for another time."
###Chapter 24: Unexpected Guest

*Summer's POV**

"Careful. Richard." Grandpa George's voice carried the kind of authority that could silence a boardroom. "Remember whose house this is. Is this how you speak to my granddaughter? Is this how you treat your own child?"

The tension in the air thickened as Father's face darkened. "Father, you don't understand-"

"Oh. I understand perfectly." Grandpa's grip on my arm tightened protectively. "I understand that you've forgotten what it means to be a father. That you've chosen to sacrifice one daughter's happiness for another s ambition."

Victoria's perfect smile faltered for just a moment. "Grandpa,please.We only want what's best for everyonie. Summer is just being... difficult."

"Difficult?" The word dropped from Grandpa's lips like ice. "Some things,once tainted, should be discarded. Like trust. Like family loyalty." His eyes fixed on Victoría and Alexander with unmistakable disappointment. "Like the illusion that blood is thicker than water."

The weight of unsaid words hung heavy in the air. I could feel Mother's fury radiatingfrom where she stood, her fingers white-knuckled around her champagne glass, *This isn't how tonight was supposed to go. They wanted a puppet show, with all of us playing our assigned roles.*

A sudden hush fell over the room. The kind of silence that spreads like a wave, pulling everyone's attention toward the entrance. Even the soft music seemed to fade into the background. Brandon Stark stood in the doorway, cutting an impossibly elegant figure in what had to be a custom Tom Ford suit. Everything about him radiated power- from the perfect cut of his clothes to the quiet authority in his bearing. James followed two steps behind, carrying an elegantly wrapped box.

*What is he doing here?* Mly mind raced with possibilities. Sure, he was Grandpa Thompson's former student, but this was a Taylor family event.And despite Alexander sharing the Stark name, I knew Brandon held no real connection to that branch of the family.*Isthis about our dinner the other night? Or is there something else going on?*

The whispers started immediately, rippling through the crowd like wind through tall grass:

"Brandon Stark?"

"Stark Group's CEO..."

"What's he doing here?"

"I didn't know the Taylors had that kind of connection..."

I watched Victoria's hand tighten on Alexander's arm. "Darling," she whispered, though her voice carried clearly in the hushed room, "you never mentioned this Mr. Stark before." *Of course he didn't mention Brandon, I thought wryly. Hard to brag about a connection that barely exists.* The way Brandon completely ignored Alexander's presence spoke volumes about their supposed "family"relationship. Alexander's expression shifted through several emotions before settling into something carefully neutral. "Brandon Stark. He's... family." "The Brandon Stark?" Victoria's eyes widened slightly. "One of Wall Street's Four Kings?"

I couldn't help but notice how Alexander's posture had changed -something about the way he held himself now reminded me of a smaller animal in the presence of a predator. The realization brought an unexpected smile to my lips. *Interesting. The mighty Alexander Stark,reduced to this by just Brandon's presence.*

James approached with smooth efficiency,presenting the wrapped package to Grandpa with a perfect bow. "Mr. Taylor, Mr. Brandon Stark sends his warmest birthday wishes."

"Summer," Grandpa's voice carried a hint of amusement, "would you do the honors?"

My fingers trembled slightly as I helped unwrap the gift. The moment the lid came off. I felt my breath catch. *No. He didn't...* But there it was -the exquisite silver chess set from Christie's, each piece gleaming like captured starlight.

"My word," Grandpa breathed, his eyes lighting up with genuine delight."This is from the British Royal Collection, isn't it? I've only ever seen photographs..." Old Mr. Stark materialized at our side like a ghost, his smile just a touch too eager. "Brandon! What a pleasant surprise. We didn't expect you at George's birthday celebration." He turned to Alexander with barely concealed impatience. "Alexander, aren't you going to greet your uncle properly? He was supposed to be at your engagement, but I'm sure that something had kept him busy." I watched Alexander approach Brandon with careful steps, like someone trying not to startle a dangerous animal. "Uncle Brandon. We... we didn't know you were coming."
Brandon's dark eyes swept over Alexander with casual indifference before finding mine. The intensity of his gaze made my pulse skip, even from across the room. *That chess set... he knew exactly what he was doing,didn't he?*

"Mr. Stark," Grandpa's voice carried genuine warmth as he carefully examined one of the silver chess pieces. "That's too kind of you. You must join us for a game later."
Brandon's lips curved into that dangerous half-smile I knew so well. "It would be my pleasure, Professor Thompson."
Victoria's smile widened, satisfaction glinting in her eyes as she turned to me. "Summer, darling, what did you get for Grandpa? I do hope it's not something cheap."

I stepped forward, retrieving the carefully wrapped box from my bag."Grandpa? Would you like to open your gift now?"

His eyes crinkled with genuine warmth as he took the package. "From my favorie granddaughter? Of course!"

I heard Victoria's soft scoff but kept my attention on Grandpa as he carefully unwrapped the Christie's box. His eyes widened as he lifted out the fountain pen, fingers running reverently over its elegant lines. "Oh, just a pen?" Victoria's voice dripped with false sympathy."How...practical." "Actually," James's smooth voice cut through the tension like a knife, "I believe I recognize that piece from Christie's. Quite the coincidence-Mr. 
Stark had his eye on it as well."

A ripple of interested murmurs swept through the crowd.I caught Brandon watching the scene unfold, his dark eyes unreadable as always.

"Christie's?" Mother's voice had taken on a different tone entirely. "Summer,darling, you didn't mention..."
Grandpa was still examining the pen with obvious delight, his expert eye catching details others might miss. "Summer, this must have cost-"
"The price doesn't matter," I said quickly. "I just wanted to get you something special."
"Thoughtful as always." His eyes met mine with understanding. "Though I hope you didn't spend too much."



The evening had become suffocating. I slipped away to the gardens,seeking refuge among the carefully tended roses. The cool evening air did little to ease the tightness in my chest. *All these years, was this how they really saw me? The difficult daughter, the stubborn one, the disappointment?*

"Alone out here?"

The deep voice made me jump. Brandon stood a few feet away, his tall frame casting long shadows in the garden lighting. Even here, away from the polished marble and crystal chandeliers, he looked impossibly elegant.

"Mr. Stark?" I took an instinctive step back, my heel catching on the garden path. "What are you doing here?"
###Chapter 25: Send Her to Mr. Windsor


*Summer's POV**

He moved closer with that predatory grace that seemed to come so naturally to him. Even in my Louboutins, I had to tilt my head back to meet his eyes. The height difference suddenly felt overwhelming, like he was deliberately using it to make me feel small.
"The garden seems to be your preferred escape." His deep voice was surprisingly gentle, though it still carried that underlying intensity that never failed to make my pulse skip.

I turned away, focusing on a particularly perfect white rose. "Sometimes you just need a moment to breathe."

"The party too overwhelming?" There was something in his tone - not quite concern, but a careful attention that made my chest tighten.

"No. I..." I trailed off, unsure how to explain. The evening air carried the scent of roses. "It's nothing."

"Miss Taylor." The way he said my name made me shiver slightly."Honesty is a virtue,remember?"

"You're very observant, Mr. Stark." I meant it to sound sharp, but my voice came out softer than intended. "Too observant." He moved closer, his presence like a physical force at my back. "Earlier, in the ballroom. Your mother seemed.., concerned about your wellbeing." The careful way he said it - like he was laying out pieces of a puzzle -made something in my chest crack. Mother's words from this morning echoed in my head: *"Summer should be grateful anyone wanted to marry her at all."*
"Concerned?" I couldn't help the bitter laugh that escaped. "Is that what we're calling it now?"
His silence was an invitation to continue, but I hesitated. Why was I even considering telling him? Brandon Stark didn't need to hear about my family drama.

"Summer." The use of my first name made my heart skip. When had he moved so close? "It's okay, you can tell me about it."
Maybe it was the gentle command in his voice, or maybe it was just the weight of carrying these words alone, but something in me cracked. "I overheard them. Right here, actually." I gestured vaguely at the garden path. "Mother and Father, discussing how grateful I should be that anyone wanted to marry me at all. How Victoriawas doing me a favor by taking Alexander." The words spilled out like poison, each one burning my throat."Apparently, I'm too stubborn, too common. Nothing like my perfect sister.


Brandon was silent for a long moment, his expression unreadable in the shadow of the garden lights. When he finally spoke, his voice carried an edge that made me shiver. "Is that what you believe?"

"What?" "That you should be grateful?" His tone made it clear what he thought of that idea. "That you're somehow less than your sister?" "I..." The words stuck in my throat. *Did I believe it? After all these years of being compared to Victoria, of never quite measuring up?* "Your silence answers my question." He stepped closer, close enough that I had to tilt my head back to meet his gaze. "You actually believe them."


"Mr.Stark-"
"Let me be clear." His voice dropped lower, intense enough to make my skin prickle. "Your family's opiníons are... severely misinformed. And Alexander?" A slight smile curved his lips, but it held no warmth. "He's a fool who doesn't deserve a second thought."
Behind us, the sounds of the party drifted through the open doors like a bitter reminder of everything I'd lost - and maybe never really had.
"Want to cry?" His deep voice softened, though that underlying intensity remained.

I forced a smile, though it felt more like a grimace. "What's there to cry about? Do I look that pitiful to you, Mr. Stark?"

His dark eyes studied my face with that unsettling intensity I was starting to know too well. The evening light caught the sharp angles of his features,making him look even more dangerous than usual. "Everyone has their own path to walk, Miss Taylor." His voice dropped lower,sending an involuntary shiver down my spine. "Have you considered my proposal?"

"What?" The word came out breathless. "I... you are Alexander's uncle...they said you were supposed to attend their engagement party..." His hand came up to brush a strand of hair from my face, the touch so gentle it made my heart ache. "In fact, I didn't come for them." Those dark eyes held mine with an intensity that made it hard to breathe. "Take your time. I'll wait for your good news, my girl." The possessive note in his voice when he said 'my girl' made something flutter in my stomach. Before I could respond, a servant appeared with practiced discretion.

"Miss Taylor? Your father is asking for you."




"Summer, come here. Your father has something to say." Father's voice carried that particular tone he used when trying to sound paternal.Elizabeth hovered near the door like a perfectly coiffed vulture.
Father gestured to the chair across from him. "Sit. Your mother prepared this tea-this year's finest Darjeeling. Working in Europe for a year couldn't have been easy. Your sister..."

"Father." I too a sip before I cut him off. "If you want to talk about Victoria, don't bother. You know, Alexander and I were together for so long. Did you ever consider my feelings? If you cared about me even a little, this wouldn't have happened."

"Summer," his voice took on that patronizing tone I'd grown to hate."Your sister didn't mean for this to happen, but feelings..."

"Enough!" The word exploded from me. "Fine tea? Mother never thought to give me the best of anything! When it comes to Victoria, Mother never considers my feelings.You too,father."

"How dare you!" Elizabeth's voice cracked through the air like a whip as she burst back into the room. The slap caught me across the face before I could react. "Don't waste words with her! This ungrateful girl needs discipline-she needs to learn her place!"

I pressed my hand to my stinging cheek, bitter laughter bubbling up in my throat. "Discipline? Like you were discussing in the garden?" "You... you heard that?" Something almost like fear flickered across Elizabeth's perfect features.
"Your mother has arranged someone for you," Father said quickly, not meeting my eyes. "The candidate is..."

The room started spinning slightly. *Something's wrong.* My limbs felt heavy, disconnected. "What... what did you do to me?"
Elizabeth's smile turned predatory. "Summer, your father is negotiating an investment. They've promised to invest $200 million in Capital Corp if you marry into their family. You know your father's company is expanding -this money is crucial."

"So you're selling me?" The words came out slurred. *The tea. Of course it was the tea. Last time it was stranger, and this time it's my own family.Fucking unbelievable.*

Elizabeth's laugh was cold and sharp. "You should be grateful the Windsor family even considered you. At least you're worth something."

The world tilted dangerously as I tried to stand. Through the growing haze. I heard Elizabeth's final command: "Get her to the next room. Don't keep Mr. Windsor waiting!"
###Chapter 26: Windsor's Trap

**Summer's POV**

The familiar patterns of my bedroom ceiling swam in and out of focus above me.

"Finally awake, Miss Taylor?"

The unfamiliar male voice sent ice through my veins. I tried to turn my head toward the sound, but even that small movement made the room spin wildly. Through the haze, I could make out a figure lounging in the armchair by my window - tall, well-dressed, with the kind of casual arrogance that came from old money.

"Who..." My voice came out as a rasp. "Who are you?"

He laughed, the sound sharp and unpleasant. "Playing dumb,or has the drug affected your memory? Charles Windsor, at your service." The mock bow he gave made my skin crawl. "Though I must say, your parents were quite... eager to arrange this meeting."

*Windsor. The investment deal.* Elizabeth's words echoed in my head:*"They've promised to invest $200 million in Capital Corp if you marry into their family."*

"Don't..." I tried to push myself up, but my arms felt like they were made of lead. "Don't touch me." "Or what?" He stood, moving toward the bed with predatory grace. "Your parents are downstairs, probably explaining your sudden illness to the party guests. Your beautiful sister Victoria is keeping everyone entertained.And your ex-fiancé..." He paused, lips curving into a cruel smile. "Well, he seems quite content with his new arrangement, doesn't he?"

The casual way he laid out my isolation made bile rise in my throat.*They planned this. All of them.* "What do you want?" I managed to get the words out despite my tongue feeling too thick in my mouth."Whatever it is, we can discuss it when I'm... when I'm clear-headed."
His laugh held no warmth. "Discuss? Oh, you still think you have a choice in this matter? How... quaint." He reached out, fingers brushing my cheek in a mockery of tenderness. "Your father needs that investment, Miss Taylor. And I... well, I enjoy collecting beautiful things. Especially when they come with such interesting family connections."

I jerked away from his touch, the sudden movement sending the room into a nauseating spin. "Don't... don't touch me!"
"Summer?" Victoria's voice called through the door, sugary-sweet with false concern. "Summer, darling, are you in there? Grandpa's looking for you."

Windsor's smile widened. "Your sister has impeccable timing, doesn't she?Always knows exactly when to check on you."

*She's part of this,* I realized with a fresh wave of horror. *Of course she is.She's always been part of their plans.* "Summer?" Victoría called again, her voice taking on an edge of theatrical worry. "Darling, are you feeling unwell? Should I call someone to help?Just open the door..." The sound of her voice, so perfectly pitched to sound concerned while knowing exactly what was happening in here, made something snap inside me. With strength born of desperation, I pushed myself up and lunged for the crystal vase on my bedside table - a birthday gift from Grandpa George years ago.
Windsor's eyes widened in surprise as I swung the heavy crystal at his head. There was a sickening crack, and he crumpled to the floor like a puppet with cut strings.

"Summer!" Victoria's voice sharpened with real alarm now. "What's going on in there? I'm getting Alexander-"
The room tilted dangerously as I tried to stand. *Have to get out. Have to...* My legs gave out, and I would have hit the floor if strong arms hadn't caught me.
"Brandon?" The word came out as barely a whisper. Those dark eyes I'd know anywhere stared down at me with barely contained fury.
"Here." He shrugged off his suit jacket, wrapping it around my shoulders."Can you walk?"

I shook my head,immediately regretting the movement as nausea swept through me. "They... the tea..."

"I know." His voice carried a dangerous edge I'd never heard before. Footsteps thundered in the hallway- multiple sets,getting closer. Brandon's arms tightened around me as footsteps thundered in the hallway.Without a word, he lifted me and moved swiftly toward the balcony doors.The world spun sickeningly with each step, but his grip was steady and sure. Just as we slipped through the French doors, the bedroom door burst open with a crash. shielding mine from view. Through my drug-hazed mind. I could hear the chaos unfolding in my bedroom.

"What happened here?" Alexander's voice, trying for authoritative but landing somewhere around panicked. "Victoria, get your parents.Now!"

The cool night air helped clear my head slightly, but every muscle in my body feIt like lead.

"Brandon, I whispered. my voice barely a breath. "I feel..."

"Shh." His finger pressed against my lips, the touch sending electricity through my drug-addled system. His other arm tightened around my waist.supporting my weight as my legs threatened to give out.

The voices from the bedroom grew more agitated:

"What do you mean, he was just lying there?" Richard's voice,sharp with barely controlled panic.

"I heard noises," Victoria explained, her voice trembling with perfectly orchestrated distress. "When Summer didn't answer, I got worried and had Alexander break down the door, and we found him like this!"

"Where is she?" Elizabeth's voice carried an edge of hysteria. "That ungrateful girl... I mean, where could she have gone?"

"Search the room,"Richard.commanded. "She has to be here somewhere."

Footsteps moved around the bedroom. I could hear them checking the closet, under the bed, even the bathroom. Each sound seemed to echo in my spinning head.
"Nothing in the bathroom," Alexander reported. "But all her things are still here. She couldn't have gone far."

"Check everywhere!" Elizabeth's voice cracked with barely controlled fury."That ungratefuI child couldn't just disappear!"
Richard finally declared. "She must have run. Elizabeth, calI security.Have them search the grounds. And get someone up here to help Mr. Windsor-quietly!"

We stood frozen as footsteps approached the balcony doors. Brandon's body pressed me further into the shadows, though I couldn't have made a sound if I'd tried. The drug was hitting me harder now, making everything blur at the edges.

"Wait," Alexander called out. "What about the balcony?"

My heart nearly stopped as his shadow fell across the glass doors. But he only glanced outside briefly, not bothering to step through. "Nothing out here either. Just those roses Victoria had planted."

Finally, the bedroom door closed, leaving us in blessed silence. Brandon's hand moved to my forehead, checking my temperature with clinical precision. "You're burning up," he murmured, his voice tight with controlled anger."We need to get you out of here." I tried to focus on hs face, but it kept splitting into doubles. "Can't... can't walk..."

 "I know." His arms tightened around me. steady and sure. "I got you."
###Chapter 27: Mr. Stark, I Feel So Hot

**Summer's POV**

The world was spinning, but Brandon's neck felt wonderfully cool against my burning skin. I pressed closer, seeking relief from the fire coursing through mny veins. My lips brushed against his ear, and I heard his sharp intake of breath.


His hand came up to cup my face, the slight chill of his palm heaven against my feverish skin. Everything burned-my skin, my blood,my core-too hot,too tight, too much. "Mr. Stark," I breathed against his ear,"I feel so hot."


His fingers tangled in my hair, gripping hard, yanking my head back just enough to expose my throat. I whimpered, wrapping my arms around his neck, my nails digging into his shoulders as I pressed my aching pussy against his thigh, desperate for friction. Like a ship crashing into harbor, I clung to himn, my body trembling as I rubbed myself shamelessly against his solid frame, soaking through my panties with every needy grind.

Footsteps echoed down the hallway, growing closer. Brandon tensed, but I barely registered the danger through the haze of whatever they'd put in that tea.


"How could she just vanish?" Richard's voice carried clearly through the door. "We brought her in ourselves!" "Keep looking!" Elizabeth's sharp command cracked through the air."After what she did to the Windsor heir, how are we supposed to secure that investment? This is your fault- I told you to guard the door until everything was settled. Now she's gone!" Brandon's arm tightened around my waist, "Hold on to me," he commanded softly.  The world tilted as he shifted me in his arms. The cool night air against my face helped clear my head slightly. Just enough to realize...

"Brandon?" My fingers clutched at his shirt as I processed our position."What are you..."

"Hold on." His voice brooked no argument as he shifted me in his arms,balancing on the balcony's edge. Below us, the garden stretched out like a dark maze, illuminated only by scattered security lights. "And whatever happens,don't scream."

*He's insane,* I thought distantly. *We're going to die.*

"Close your eyes."

The world tilted sharply as he moved. Cool night air hit mny face,and I felt the strange sensation of falling. But Brandon's arms remained steady around me, his grip secure as wwe somehow ended up in the garden below.

I clung to him like a koala, face pressed into his shoulder as he navigated through the shadows. His expensive suit would probably be ruined, but I couldn't bring myself to care. Eveything hurt except where I touched him.

"Sir?" James's efficient voice cut through my haze. "WNhat happened to Miss Taylor?"

"Hamptons estate," Brandon's command brooked no argument. "Now."

The world shifted again as he settled me into the car's leather seat. He draped his suit jacket over me, but it was suffocating against my burning skin. I squirmed, shoving it off, my hands fumbling to hike my skirt higher,desperate to cool the throbbing heat between my thighs. My fingers brushed my soaked panties, and I rubbed myself shamelessly, moaning as I spread my legs wider,

"Stop that," Brandon's voice carried a note I'dI never heard before as he caught my wandering hands.

"You're mean," I pouted, my words slurring as I arched my hips,trying to grind my dripping pussy against his thigh again.

"How am I mean?" His deep rumble vibrated through his chest, pressed tight against my aching tits.

"You just are!" I whined, struggling to focus on his face-two gorgeous versions of him swimming in my vision. "I'm hot,I feel awful,and you won't help!"

"Summer," his voice dropped, a husky growl that sent a fresh gush of wetness between my legs, "you're not thinking clearly."

The car jerked, and I was flung against his chest, my nipples scraping against his shirt through my thin top. My head bumped the window,tears stinging my eyes as he lowered it, cool air rushing in-useless against the fire in my core. My hand slid down, brushing something hard and thick straining against his pants. "What's this?" I giggled, palming his cock through the fabric, feelingit twitch under my touch. "Why is it-"

"Don't move." His grip on my wrist tightened, firm but gentle, as he throbbed beneath my fingers.

"You're being mean again!" I whined, stroking him harder, reveling in the way his jaw clenched.

"Be good and stay still."

"But you haven't told me what that was! Why was it-"

"Behave." The word was a whip of authority, and I pouted, sulking as he spoke into his phone: "Twenty minutes to Hamptons!"

James raised the privacy partition, and Brandon's cologne enveloped me- woodsy, masculine, intoxicating. I nuzzled closer, ignoring his efforts to keep space between us, and pressed my open mouth to his neck, sucking hard, leaving wet, red marks. My tongue traced his pulse, and I ground my pussy against his thigh, soaking his pants with my dripping arousal.

"Summer." His voice was rough, strained, as I caught his earlobe between my teeth, biting down, delighting in his sharp inhale. His hands clamped on my waist, fingers digging in, and I couldn't tell if he was pushing me away or pulling me tighter as I rocked against him, my clit pulsing with every grind.

"You smell so good," I murmured, my lips trailing sloppy, wet kisses along his jaw, finding the corner of his mouth. I licked there,tasting him,my hands sliding under his shirt to claw at his chest, nails raking over his nipples.

For one electrifying moment, he gave in, his lips crashing against mine,tongue thrusting deep into my mouth, fucking it with slow, deliberate strokes. I moaned into him, my pussy clenching as I rubbed myself harder against his thigh, chasing release. Then he pulled back, his dark eyes blazing, his cock visibly straining against his pants, a damp spot forming where I'd teased him.


"Not like this," he rasped, his voice raw with restraint. His thumb traced my lower lip, and I sucked it into my mouth, swirling my tongue around it,imagining it was his cock. The touch sent a jolt straight to my core, my hips bucking against him. "When you kiss me,I want you fully aware of what you're doing."




The Hamptons estate loomed out of the darkness like a dream. As the car stopped, I glimpsed Dr. Sean leaning against the entrance,a cigarette dangling from his fingers, his eyes narrowing with curiosity as he watched us. Brandon lifted me from the car effortlessly, my legs wrapping around his waist, my soaked pussy pressed tight against his abs as he strode past Dr.Sean without a word. The motion sent the world spinning,and I whimpered, burying my face in his shirt, my lips sucking at his collarbone.

"Well, well." Dr. Sean's voice dripped with amusement as he crushed out his cigarette. "Who's this? Brandon Stark bringing a woman to his private sanctuary? I never thought I'd see the day."

Brandon's only response was a curt "Get inside" as he carried me through the mansion's elegant halls.

"Seriously, Brandon," Dr. Sean continued, following with that effortless grace. "Who is she? You drag me out in the middle of the night-don't tell me you're having... performance issues?"

I felt Brandon's muscles tense beneath me. "Another word," his voice was pure ice, "and I'll make you regret it."

"Alright, alright!" Dr. Sean's tone stayed light, but it sharpened. "She's been drugged? Who would dare touch someone under your protection?"

Brandon laid me carefully on the softest bed I'd ever felt, his hands lingering on my hips, his fury palpable. "Just check her condition. Now."
###Chapter 28: I'm Cold, Stay With Me

**Brandon's POV**

Sean pushed off from where he'd been leaning against the wall, cigarette dangling between his fingers. His usual playful smirk faded as he took in Summer's condition.


"The drug's strong," he noted, professional demeanor replacing his typical casualness. "Whoever did this knew what they were doing." His eyes flickered to my face. "You know, if she's under your protection,why not just take her to a hospital?"

I ignored his probing tone, laying Summer carefully on the sofa. Her fingers clutched at my shirt, reluctant to let go. "You recognize her?"

"Don't worry - just saw her once at some charity gala." He crushed out his cigarette, moving closer to examine her. "Though I am curious how you got mixed up with the Taylor family. Isn't your distant relative Alexander somehow connected to them too?"

"Something like that." I kept my voice neutral, though the mention of Alexander made my jaw clench.

Sean's hands were gentle as he checked Summer's vital signs. "So what's the plan here?"


"You're the doctor." I couldn't quite keep the edge from my voice."Why are you asking me?"

He glanced up at me, that familiar mischievous glint returning to his eyes."Come on, man. Beautiful girl like this, and you're acting so cold? That's not like you at all." His grin widened. "Though I just finished surgery, and we don't have any antidote here. The most direct solution is right in front of us..," The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees as I met his gaze.
"Don't tell me..." His eyebrows shot up. "You haven't sealed the deal yet?"

"Are you going to help her or not?"

"Hey, you're the one asking for favors here..." He held up his hands at my expression. "Fine, fine. James, we need ice-lots of it. Physical cooling is our only option right now. Though I should warn you, she'll probably spike a fever afterward. I'll write you a prescription, but you're in for a long night."
Summer stirred restlessly on the sofa, her skin flushed with fever. "Hot..."she mumbled, trying to push away the light blanket James had draped over her. "Everything's burning..."
I moved her to the master bathroom while James gathered supplies. The massive tub filled quickly, steam rising as hot water mixed with the ice James kept bringing in. Summer fought weakly as I lowered her into the water, her fingers digging into my arms.

"You're cruel" She looked up at me with tear-filled eyes, bottom lip trembling. "It's too cold, you bad man!"

"Stay still." I kept my voice gentle despite the rage still simmering beneath the surface."Just a little longer."

She pouted, pressing closer despite the way I tried to maintain some distance. "I'm cold.,. stay with me."

I comforted Summer briefly and went out after she felt better,finding Sean sprawled in my favorite armchair.

"How is she?" he asked, studying me with unusual intensity. 
"Still here?"

"You know, what you're doing isn't exactly fair."

"Fair?" I could feel my patience wearing thin. "I don't need to discuss this with you."
"Hey, I just helped you out big time! And aren't you worried about potential complications tonight? I am a doctor-having me stay would be beneficial."

"Not necessary.James,show him out."

After they left. I stood on the balcony, watching the moon cast silver shadows across the manicured lawn.Self-control had always been my strong suit. But now... I glanced back at Summer's sleeping form. Perhaps she would be the exception.

In the car earlier, I'd nearly given in to desire. Only the thought of her potential panic and regret upon waking had stopped me.
She shifted in her sleep, letting out a soft sigh. My fingers hovered over her cheek, pulling back just before making contact.

"Mr. Stark." James's voice pulled me from my thoughts. "Here's the surveillance footage from the Taylor mansion tonight."

"Double your bonus this month."

"Dr. Sean was fishing for information, but I didn't reveal anything.Though knowing him..."

"Let him be."

James hesitated before continuing. "Sir, about Charles Windsor-he does have an oral agreement with Richard Taylor about the investment, but it's just talk so far. Charles doesn't have much influence in the Windsor family. 
George Windsor makes all the decisions, and he might not even know about this."

"I heard Charles Windsor was interested in Victoria," James added carefully.

I couldn't help but laugh. "You think Victoria was his target? No, James."

"What should we do now,sir?"

"Watch and wait. This isn't your concern. Look into Capital Corp's recent activities instead."

"About Fortune Corp's investment reduction you ordered?"

"They haven't noticed yet?"

"No,sir."

"Reduce it another 10%. And that new project bid in the South District-speed it up."

I worked through the rest of the night, finishing up various tasks until the early hours. *The Taylors will regret this,* I thought, reviewing the surveillance footage again. *Especially Elizabeth and Richard.*

After putting away the last of the documents, I lit a cigarette and stood on the balcony, staring into the pitch-black night. The familiar taste of nicotine did little to calm the rage still simmering beneath my surface.I waited until the cigarette burned down to nothing before releasing it, my dark eyes unusually bright in the darkness.

Standing at Summer's bedside, Llooked down at her sleeping form. The fever-induced flush had finally faded from her face, leaving behind delicate features that caught the moonlight. I'd known from the first moment that Summer was beautiful, but I hadn't realized just how striking she was without makeup.*God,she's stunning.*

A slight smile touched my lips as I adjusted her blanket. She sprawled across the bed in a way that completely contradicted her usually composed daytime demeanor. *Always trying to maintain control, aren't you,Summer?* The heat must have bothered her - she'd kicked off the covers at some point, exposing one smooth shoulder to the night air.

My gaze darkened as I felt my breathing accelerate. Looking down at my own body's reaction, I realized I was hard again. Since meeting this woman,I seemed to be... losing my self-control. *What are you doing to me.Summer Taylor?* The desire to touch her, to claim her, was becoming harder to resist with each passing moment.

A phone buzzed by the window, the sound sharp in the quiet night.

Walking over, I picked up Summer's phone. Several missed calls lit up the screen-some from George Taylor and Professor Thompson, but also Alexander's number among them. *Alexander.* The name alone made my jaw clench.

I smiled, switching the phone to silent and watching it continue to flash uselessly in the darkness.
###Chapter 29: Does That Proposal Still Stand

**Summer's POV**

Even in my drug-induced haze, I could feel someone watching me.The intensity of that gaze followed me through fevered dreams. When consciousness finally returned, the first thing I noticed was the unfamiliar ceiling - all clean lines and modern elegance, nothing like my apartment's cozy simplicity.
My head felt stuffed with cotton, and every muscle ached like I'd run a marathon. Memories of last nightcame flooding back in fragments:Grandpa's birthday party, the drugged tea, Charles Windsor's cruel smile,Brandon carrying me through the darkness... *Oh god. Brandon.*
The room screamed masculine luxury -all grey and white tones, with expensive furniture. Sunlight streamed through floor-to-ceiling windows,catching on what had to be custom Italian sheets. *Where am I? And why am I wearing...* I looked down at myself, heat flooding my face as I realized I was wearing nothing but a man's white dress shirt. The fabric felt impossibly soft against my skin, carrying a hint of that winter-fresh cologne I'd come to associate with Brandon.

"Ms. Taylor?"

The deep voice startled me, banging my head against the headboard in my haste to pull thesheets higher. Brandon stood in the doorway, looking unfairly perfect in what had to be Tom Ford loungewear. His dark eyes studied me with intensity that never failed to make my pulse race.

"Mr, Stark!" I tried for a casual laugh, but it came out slightly hysterical, *God,could this be more awkward?*

"There's fever medication on the table." He nodded toward an elegant side table where several pill bottles sat arranged with military precision. "How are you feeling?"

"Fever?" I frowned, trying to piece together the fragments of last night."I don't have a fever. You... you saved me last night?"
One corner of his mouth lifted. "Obviously."

"Thank you, but..." I glanced down at the shirt I was wearing,heat creeping up my neck. "These clothes..."

"I changed them." He said it so matter-of-factly, like discussing the weather. "There are no maids here,only James."

My face felt like it was on fire. "That's not what I meant! I was asking about my dress..."

"Hmm?" His eyes gleamed with something that looked suspiciously like amusement. "It should still be at the cleaners. All clothing here goes to a specialist service."

I clutched the sheets tighter, painfully aware of how vulnerable I felt under his intense gaze. The events of last night came back in sickening waves -Mother's calculated cruelty, Father's cold betrayal, the way they'd tried to...
*No. Don't think about that now.*

"Hungry?" His deep voice pulled me from my spiral of dark thoughts.

I nodded, not trusting my voice.

"The bathroom has fresh toiletries. Get ready and come down for breakfast.11

"Okay." The word cameout smaller than I intended.

The ensuite bathroom took my breath away -all gleaming marble and state-of-the-art fixtures that probably cost more than my car. Everything was new and unopened: Hermès toothbrush set, Egyptian cotton towels, an entire collection of La Mer products arranged with precise care. *Even his bathroom screams perfectionist.*
After washing up, I padded down the sweeping staircase, feeling oddly small in Brandon's oversized shirt. The marble floors were cool against my bare feet, and morning light streamed through massive windows,making the whole space feel almost ethereal.
A gentle tap on the banister made me jump. Brandon stood at the bottom of the stairs, those dark eyes tracking my descent with predatory focus."Miss Taylor isn't hungry anymore?"

"You've gone to so much trouble, Mr. Stark." I tried to keep my voice steady despite how his gaze made my skin prickle with awareness.

The dining room was a study in understated elegance, with views of manicured gardens through floor-to-ceiling windows. "Do you live here alone? Where is your family?"

His eyes met mine with an intensity that made my breath catch. "Alone.Though not for long."

The breakfast spread was surprisingly homey - fresh fruit,pastries,and what looked like perfectly prepared eggs. "Last night we had to use an ice bath to bring down your fever," he explained, pulling out a chair for me with that casual grace that seemed to come so naturally to him."Dr.Sean said you might spike a fever afterward,but you seem to have recovered well. I kept breakfast light."

"It looks amazing," And it did - simple but elegant, just like everything else about him.


"I made it myself." Something about the way he said it made my heart do a complicated flip. "James usually handles this, but..."

"It's better than anything I could make," I took a bite of the eggs,trying not to think about how domestic this all felt.

"If you like it, have more." His voice carried that gentle command that never failed to make my pulse skip.
I nodded. The simple domesticity of the moment felt dangerous somehow-like stepping onto thin ice, knowing it might crack but unable to resist testing its strength.

My parents betrayed me. They were willing to sacrifice me to secure an investment, and I remembered the cold calculation in Mother's voice as she discussed my fate. But here, in Brandon's private space... everything felt different.Safer.

*He's perfect,* my traitorous mind supplied.*Grandpa Thompson's favorite student, powerful enough to protect me from the Windsors,completely outside my parents' influence...* The memory of his marriage proposal at Manhattan Club floated through my mind. Back then, it had seemed absurd - now, it felt like a lifeline.

"Mr.Stark?" My voice came out shakier than I'd intended. "That day at Manhattan Club... does it still stand?"

His perfect eyebrow arched slightly. "Which part?"

Heat flooded my face. *God, he's going to make me say it.*

"Hmm?" The amusement in his tone made me want to throw something at his stupidly handsome face.

"The... the marriage proposal." The words came out in arush."Does it still stand?"

His dark eyes studied me with that unsettling intensity,but his lips curved into that dangerous half-smile that never failed to make my heart race.The silence stretched between us, heavy with possibility. "Does it?" I repeated, hating how vulnerable I sounded.
###Chapter 30: You'll Have Everything You Want
**Summer's POV**

Time seemed to freeze in that moment. My heart was racing wildly, the sensation completely beyond my control. *What have I done?* Instant regret washed over me for being so impulsive - I should never have blurted out something like that.

My face burned as I kept my head down, unable to look at Brandon. I felt utterly mortified. *What kind of woman just asks about marriage proposals like that? So much for playing it cool.*


The morning sunlight streamed through Brandon's floor-to-ceiling windows, making the elegant breakfast spread before me look almost surreal. I stared down at my plate, unable to meet his intense gaze. *God. What was I thinking? Can I take back what I just said?*

"That..." My voice came out embarrassingly squeaky. "I was just asking! Please don't take it seriously!" Brandon's fingers drummed a gentle rhythm against the pristine tablecloth. "Miss Taylor," his deep voice carried just a hint of amusement, "do I seem like someone who makes jokes?" "What? I mean..." The words died in my throat as I finally looked up, meeting those dark eyes that never failed to make my pulse race. "Wall Street knows one thing about Brandon Stark-I always mean what I say." His tone was calm but carried an undercurrent of steel that made my skin prickle. "I gave you time to think it over. Now that you've made up your mind,I won't let you take it back."

"Mr. Stark, I just wanted to-"

"You don't need to explain." He cut me off smoothly,his expression unreadable. "Whatever changed your mind isn't important. What matters is the result." His dark eyes held mine with an intensity that mnade it hard to breathe. "Miss Taylor, I promised you - marry me,and you'll have everything you want. Name your terms."

The casual way he said it - like we were discussing a business deal instead of marriage-should have bothered me. But after last night, after seeing how easily my own family had tried to sell me off... *At least Brandon's being honest about his intentions.*


"Mr. Stark?" I twisted my napkin nervously. "Can I ask you something?"

One perfect eyebrow arched slightly. "Why me?" The question that had been burning in my mind since that first proposal finally spilled out. "There must be dozens of women who'd jump at the chance to marry you."He studied me for a long moment, his expression thoughtful."Is Miss Taylor very concerned about the answer?" I nodded, unable to look away from his intense gaze.

"Sometimes," his voice softened slightly, "the right person appearing at the right time is reason enough."

The weight of his words hung between us like a physical presence. *The right person at the right time.* It sounded almost romantic, except this was Brandon Stark-Wall Street's most infamous CEO. Nothing about him wasthat simple.

"If we get married," I said carefully, "I'll take it seriously.I don't like complications, and I've never considered divorce as an option."

"Good." His approval sent an unexpected warmth through my chest. "Unless you choose to end it, this marriage will be permanent."

I couldn't help but laugh, though it came out slightly bitter."You should know - I have no power in the Taylor family. No shares in Capital Corp,no-"

"Only weak men care what their wives bring to a marriage."The steel was back in his voice.

"But in Manhattan, many people-"

"Is that what you're worried about?" His dark eyes pinned me in place. "Your complicated family situation? Or perhaps how your parents tried to trade you to the Windsors for a two hundred million dollar investment?" Heat flooded my face at the reminder of last night's humiliation.
"I just... you should know what you're getting into."

"These problems will resolve themselves after the marriage."The casual confidence in his tone made something flutter in my stomach. "Unless Miss Taylor doesn't trust me?"

Before I could respond, he asked, "When would you like to get married?"


"As soon as possible." The words tumbled out before I could stop them. "I don't want my parents to have a chance to interfere."

"Today."

I nearly choked on my tea. "Today? But..."

"All the arrangements are in place." He turned to James, who materialized beside us with his usual silent efficiency.′′IsJack Peterson still at the City Clerk's Office?"

"Yes, sir. He's awaiting your instructions."

"Have him come over. Bring all necessary documents." I watched in stunned silence as James made the calls.Everything moved with military precision, like a perfectly choreographed dance where I was the only one who didn't know the steps. Within an hour, a distinguished-looking man arrived with a briefcase full of papers. "Mr. Stark, it's been too long." Brandon nodded slightly. "Everything prepared?"

"Of course. Given the special circumstances, we can waive the standard waiting period."

"Is this even legal?" I couldn't help asking.

Peterson smiled kindly. "Don't worry, Miss Taylor. We allow exemptions in certain cases."

The weight of what we'd just decided to do hit me like a physical blow. This wasn't how I'd imagined my marriage-no white dress, no flowers, no family gathering to celebrate.The last time I'd planned a wedding, it had been with Alexander,full of romantic dreams and naive hopes.

But maybe this was better. No pretense, no false promises of eternal love. Just two adults making a choice, eyes wide open.

The next hour passed in a blur of signatures and legal jargon.Brandon's private attorney appeared to witness everything,his presence lending an air of absolute legitimacy to what felt increasingly like a dream.

I stared down at the marriage certificate in my hands, my signature still drying beside Brandon's bold strokes. "Just like that? We're married?"
###Chapter 31: Don't Answer His Call

*Summer's POV**


"Yes." Brandon's deep voice carried that familiar note of absolute certainty.
*God, how can he be so calm about this?*

"Well, it's getting late. I should probably go..." I started to stand, but Brandon's raised eyebrow stopped me mid-motion.

"Summer." The way he said my name made my pulse skip. "It's still morning."

Heat flooded my face as I realized he was right. The bright morning sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows made that perfectly clear. *Great job, Summer. Really nailing this whole 'sophisticated new wife thing.*

"Oh... right." I sank back into my chair,suddenly hyperaware of what I was wearing - or rather, what I wasn't wearing. Brandon's white dress shirt barely reached mid-thigh, and I'd just sat through the registration progress dressed like this. In front of James. And Peterson.*Oh god.*

"Why didn't you say something?" I demanded, mortification making my voice crack slightly. "Those marriage registration photos... I look..." "Beautiful." The way he said it - like it was simply a fact-made my heart do complicated gymnastics in my chest. "Mr.Stark-" "Brandon." He corrected smoothly, "We are married now,after all." *Married.* The word still felt surreal. Less than twenty-four hours ago, I'd been getting ready for Grandpa's birthday party, and now.. "Your dress is still being cleaned." His voice pulled me from my spiral of thoughts. "You should head upstairs. Your phone is in the master bedroom."

The mention of my phone sent a jolt of anxiety through me. *How many missed calls do I have by now?* "Right. I should... check my messages.And maybe... find some proper clothes?"

His dark eyes swept over me in a way that made my skin prickle with awareness. "Upstais. First door on the right."

Brandon's master bedroom felt different in the morninglight-less intimidating somehow, though no less luxurious. My phone sat on the bedside table, its screen lit up with notifications. *Twenty-seven missed calls.* Most were from Alexander and my parents, but seeing Grandpa Jonathan and Grandpa George's names made my heart twist with guilt.
Taking a deep breath, I called Grandpa Jonathan first. He picked up on the first ring.

"Summer, darling?" His worried voice made tears prick at my eyes."Where have you been?"

I hesitated, memories of last night's events flashing through my mind.Grandpa Jonathan had never hidden his dislike for the Taylor family-a coldness that extended even to his own daughter, my mother.For as long as I could remember, there had been this inexplicable tension between them, though I never knew why. "Grandpa, I'm so sorry! My phone died last night..," The lie tasted bitter,but I couldn't tell him about Windsor. About how my own parents had tried to... After a moment's consideration, I decided to keep last night's events to myself. Grandpa Jonathan already harbored such negative feelings toward the Taylor family- if he learned what they'd tried to do to me,he'd storm over toconfront them immediately. I couldn't bear the thought of him getting into a heated argument with them, especially over me. Besides.Grandpa George had always been different from the rest of them, always showing me genuine kindness and care.

"Are you alright? When you disappeared from the party..."

"I'm fine, Grandpa." I forced cheer into my voice. "I just wasn't feeling well after wishing Grandpa George happy birthday. Please don't worry."

His sigh carried years of understanding. "You know you can tell me anything,right?"

"I know, Grandpa." *Just not this. Not yet.*

After reassuring him a few more times, I called Grandpa George. His voice was gruff with concern: "I may be old, but I'm not blind. Something happened last night."

"I'm fine, Grandpa," I assured him quickly. "I just... needed some time alone after the party. Please don't worry about me."

"You should have come to me." The hurt in his voice made my chest ache.
"Whatever it was, you didn't have to face it alone."

"I know." My voice cracked slightly. "I just... I didn't want to ruin your birthday.""Silly girl." His tone softened. "Listen, maybe it's better if you stay away from the house for a while. Ifyou want to see me, we can meet outside.Jenkins can drive me." "I'd like that." The tears I'd been holding back finally spilled over. A discrete knock at the door made me jump. Brandon stood there with a Chanel shopping bag, his expression unreadable as always. "Your dress is still at the cleaners. This will have to do for now."

Inside the bag was a stunning cream-colored dress that probably cost more than my monthly rent. "How did you... this is exactly my size."

That dangerous half-smile played at his lips. "Of course it is."

*Of course it is.* The casual confidence in his tone made something warm flutter in my stomach. "I'll go change."

The dress fit perfectly - *because of course it did* - highlighting curves I hadn't even known I had. I placed a hand over my racing heart, only to catch sight of Brandon emerging from the walk-in closet. The sight made me freeze, my breath catching in my throat.

I'd always known he had an excellent physique - perfect proportions that made him look like he was born to wear bespoke suits. But this...this was something else entirely.

He wore a light-colored suit that had clearly been tailored specifically for him, the cut emphasizing his athletic build without a hnt of excess anywhere. The tailoring wasn't entirely traditional - there were subtle modern touches that set it apart. His shirt underneath was clearly expensive, the top three buttons left casually undone to reveal a tantalizing glimpse of his tanned skin. The effect was less formal than his usual attire,carrying a hint of deliberate casualness that somehow made him even more attractive. A simple silver pin served as his cufflink, the understated elegance perfectly matching his style. *How does he manage to look this good in everything?* I couldn't tear my eyes away - there was something magnetic about his presence that demanded attention. He adjusted his cufflink with one hand, the gesture effortlessly elegant.Catching my bright-eyed stare, the corner of his mouth lifted in that dangerous half-smile I knew so well, his perfect eyebrow arching slightly."See something you like?"

I quickly looked away, offering a small smile but no verbal response.∗Cod,he knows exactly how good he looks.*

My phone buzzed again, and my stomach dropped when I saw the caller
ID. Brandon must have noticed my expression because he smoothly plucked the phone from my hand.

"If you don't want to answer," his deep voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse race, "then don't."
###Chapter 32: My Marriage Ends Only in Deat Not Divorce
**Summer's POV**

I couldn't help letting out a small sigh as I watched Brandon take my phone. He stood in the center of his expansive living room, one perfect eyebrow arched as he studied my expression. "Having second thoughts?"

"No!" I shifted uncomfortably on the Italian leather sofa, painfully aware of how defensive I sounded. The morning sunlight streaming through the floor-to-ceiling windows made everything feel surreal, like I was stuck in some strange dream where I'd somehow ended up married to Brandon Stark.

"Hmm." The sound carried volumes of meaning I wasn't readyto unpack.

"Look." I said quickly, "whether you believe it or not, what happened with Alexander is over." The words came out steadier than I felt. "You don't need to worry. Since I chose to marry you, I won't do anything inappropriate."
Something flickered across his face - surprise, maybe? - before his lips curved into that dangerous half-smile I was starting to know too well."Good. I'll take you home."
"Okay." I tried to match his casuial tone, though my heart was racing. He moved toward the foyer with that predatory grace that seemed to come so naturally to him. "I know this has all happened very quickly," his deep voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my skin prickle, "but we are married now. I hope you understand what that means.11 I followed him, chewing my lower lip as Itried to formulate a response." Give me some time," I managed finally. "I mean, you don't need to remind me. Since I agreed to marry you, T'll definitely respect our marriage-"

"Summer." The way he said my name made me stumble slightly.He turned to face me, his dark eyes holding mine with that unsettling intensity. "You don't need to be so tense. I'm just talking to you, not some kind of monster."

*You're scarier than any monster,* I thought, but I forced a smile. "Right."




The ride to my apartment felt endless. Brandon's presence beside me in the car was like a physical force, drawing my attention no matter how hard I tried to focus on the passing scenery.

"You had a rough night," his deep voice broke the silence. "Get some rest when you get home. Don't catch a cold."

Heat flooded my face despite nothing having actually happened last night.
I stared down at my hands, twisting my fingers nervously. "You..."

"I'll give you three days," he said, eyes fixed on the road ahead. "Then I'll come get you."

I turned to him, startled. "What? What three days?"

"You didn't think we'd live separately after marriage, did you?" The way he emphasized 'separately' made something flutter in my stomach. Embarrassment washed over me as I realized I hadn't thought that far ahead at all. My hands clasped together in my lap, palms suddenly sweaty."L.. I'm sorry, I'm not ready." The reality of my situation hit me like a physical blow. I knew almost nothing about this man I'd just married. His likes, his dislikes, his family background. his social circle - it was all a mystery. "Mr. Stark"I pressed a hand to my forehead."can I take it back?"

"We just got married right?" panic made my voice shake slightly. "Maybe it's not too late. No one knows about this yet, we could-

Miss Taylor." His fingers tapped a gentle thythm against the steeting wheel. "My matriage ends only in death, not divorce." His tone remained casual,almost playful, but something in it made my skin prickle."And didn't you just say we just got married? Yet you're already talking about divorce?"

I let out a nervous laugh, words failing me. My hand moved to the doot handle on instinct, only to find it locked. "Brandon Stark," I couldn't keep the frustration from my voice,"you can't force people like this!"

His brow furrowred slightly, "Force?" The temperature in the car seemed to drop several degrees. "Have you forgotten something? Marrying me was your idea."

My heart thundered against my ribs as his eyes fixed on me with predatory focus."But... but I..."

Something in my expression must have given away my panic because his gaze softened slightly. "Did I scare you?" He reached over to brush a strand of hair from my face. "I was just teasing." The casual intimacy of the gesture made my breath eatch. He leaned closer to undo my seatbelt, and suddenly the space between us feltcharged with electricity. "I didn't mean to frighten you," his voice carriedI that velvet-soft quality that never failed to make my pulse race. "I just hope you understand -what's done is done. Why run from it?" His dark eyes held mine, "Instead of avoiding it, why not accept it? You might find a different perspective." I took a deep breath, trying to steady my racing heart. "Fine. I'll try to adjust. Three days - you promised me three days."

Something that looked dangerously like approval flickered in his eyes."Of course. I always keep my word." His lips curved into that half-smile that made my stomach do complicated flips. "Though I hope after three days,you won't still be this...skittish."




I practically ran into my apartment, locking the door behind me before sliding down against it. My legs felt like jelly, and myface burned as I tried to catch my breath. *What have I done? What have I done?*

"This is bad," I muttered to myself, pressing my hands against my flushed cheeks. "This is really, really bad."

Everything had happened so fast. I'd always prided myself on being careful, on thinking things through. But in less than twenty-four hours, I'd gone from discovering my parents' betrayal to marrying Brandon Stark. *Summer Taylor, what were you thinking?*

I dragged myself to the bathroom, needing to see my reflection -to make sure I was still me. The woman in the mirror looked startled, cheeks flushed and eyes too bright. *Was I just scared? Scared of what my parents tried to do?* There had to have been other options besides marrying Brandon. Had I just traded one form of control for another?

Cold water helped clear my head slightly, but my hands still trembled as I patted my face dry. The strange thing was, I felt surprisingly calm about Alexander's betrayal. Maybe it was the shock of my parents trying to sell me to the Windsors, or maybe Alexander's true nature had been apparent for longer than I'd wanted to admit. Either way, my heart felt oddly steady when I thought about him now. A knock at the door made me freeze. Thmrough the peephole. I saw Alexander standing there, looking as perfectly put-together as always. My stomach twisted with disgust. *After what happened last night, he actually has the nerve to show up here?*
###Chapter 33: At Least He Won't Sell Me out for Two Hundred Million
**Summer's POV**

*Knock. Knock. Knock.*

"Summer, open the door. We need to talk."

"Summer, I know you're home. I saw you come back." Another series of knocks, more insistent this time. "Everyone's worried about last night.Where did you go? Why didn't you answer anyone's calls? Do you know how worried Victoria was?"


A bitter laugh came out from my mouth. "Worried? What's there to be worried about? Disappointed that Charles Windsor didn't get what he wanted?" *The audacity of them - to act concerned after what they tried to do.*

Through the peephole, I watched his perfect facade crack slightly. The memory of last night made bile rise in my throat- not just Elizabeth and Richard's betrayal, but Alexander's role in it all. *If Brandon hadn't shown up when he did...* The thought sent ice through my veins. *My own family. They were willing to sacrifice me for money.* "God." I pressed a hand to my mouth, fighting back a wave of nausea.That was Grandpa George's birthday party. If anyone had seen me with Charles Windsor... my life would have been over. *They didn't just try to sell me-they tried to destroy me completely,* "Summer, let me explain." Alexander's voice took on that reasonable tone he used when trying to manipulate me. "I really didn't know what happened last night. Victoria said you disappeared, your room was locked,we were worried..." "Bullshit! Alexander." My voice came out steady despite the way my heart hammered against my ribs. "I'm not a child anymore. I can tell right from wrong. You were there last night-we both knew it. No need to put on an act." *The way he stands there, still thinking he can control the narrative.Still thinking I'll believe whatever story he spins.*

"Trading me for Windsor's two hundred million dollar investment? Keep dreaming!" The words tasted like poison. "Just go away. I don't want to see you."

"Summer!" His composure cracked further, real emotion bleeding through. "What happened to you? You're like a hedgehog, all spikes! We're all trying to help you!"

The laugh that burst from my throat sounded almost hysterical. "Help me?Haven't you done enough damage?" *Three years of my life wasted on this man. Three years believing in a love that never existed.*

"Alexander, please leave. Just hearing your voice makes me sick!" *And it does - physically sick, like my body is rejecting every memory of him.*

There was a moment of tense silence. Then: "Do you have another man?"

My heart skipped a beat. *Brandon.*

"I saw you get out of a Bentley." Alexander's voice had taken on an edge I'd never heard before. "Were you with him last night? Where did you go?" "Enough!" The word exploded fromme like a bullet. "Who I'm with is none of your business." *The jealousy in his voice - after everything he's done, he still thinks he has some claim  on me?* "How is it not my business? I'm your-" "My what?" I cut him off, anger giving me strength. "Or did you forget?You're Victoria's fiancé now," *The words don't even hurt anymore. Maybe that's the strangest part - where there used to be pain, there's just...nothing.*

"There's nothing left to discuss between us. I remember everything from last night, and I'm not someone you can manipulate so easily. Go tell my sister she better watch her step - if I get the evidence of her pulling anything like this again, I'll make sure she regrets what she did to me!"

My mind drifted to childhood memories-all those times my parents favored Victoria,all those quiet afternoons with Grandpa George. *"Chess teaches you to think clearly,"* he'd always say. *"To see what you really want."* The memory brought unexpected tears tomy eyes. *He always knew, didn't he? That someday I'd have to learn to stand up for myself.*

"T've always seen you as a younger sister," Alexander was saying, his voice softening in that way that used to make my heart flutter. "That year you were in Europe, we spent more time together, and things just..."

"So you decided to get engaged while I was away?" The bitterness in my voice surprised even me. "The whole of Manhattan knows you're engaged to Victoria. And what about me? In everyone's eyes, I'm the homewrecker who tried to steal my sister's fiancé?"

"Do you even know who that man is?" Alexander demanded.

Something warm bloomed in my chest as I thought of Brandon's quiet strength, his unwavering protection. "I know he's better than you-better than all of you. At least he won't betray me. At least he won't sell me out for two hundred million dollars!" "Better? You barely know him! How long have you even known this man?"
"Enough, Alexander. If you don't leave, I'm calling the police." I was done with this endless cycle of confrontation. Nothing good could come from dragging this out any longer. But Alexander had always been stubborn,
incapable of letting things go.

He kept calling my name through the door, his voice carrying down the hallway. I caught fragments of neighbors' conversations as they passed,their whispers adding to my mortification.

*What's the point of allthis?* I let him continue his tirade, refusing to engage. The silent treatment had never worked with Alexander before, but I had nothing left to say to him.

His voice took on an edge of desperation. "Summer, open the fucking door!Do you think running away solves anything?"

"Excuse me, sir. Are you a resident here?"

The unexpected question cut through Alexander's rant. Two police officers had appeared in the hallway, their expressions professionally neutral as they sized him up.

"We received a complaint about a disturbance," one of them continued."Sir,if you're not a resident, we'll need you to come with us."

I listened to their footsteps fade away, Alexander's protests growing fainter until finally, blessed silence fell. The tension drained from my shoulders as I leaned against the door,exhausted.

My phone sudden rang. An unknown number flashed on the screen. After a moment's hesitation, I answered. "Hello?"

"It's me." His deep voice sent an unexpected wave of calm through me.


"Brandon?"

"Mm.Is he gone?"

"Did you..." I glanced at the security guard through the peephole. "Did you call the police? Are you still nearby?"
###Chapter 34: Between Husband and Wife, No Thanks Needed
**Summer's POV**

"I saw him following my car when I left," Brandon's deep voice carried that casual confidence I was starting to know well. "Given his... persistence,
I thought it best to alert the police before he could cause any trouble."

Running to my balcony, I scanned the street below for any sign of that familiar Bentley. "I don't see your car!"

Brandon's soft laugh rumbled through the phone,sending an unexpected warmth through my chest. "I'm already back at the office."

"Do you have connections at the police department?" The words tumbled out before I could stop them. "I've never seen them respond so quickly to a complaint."

"You seem very curious." That dangerous amusement was back in his voice. "Let's just say I prefer to be... prepared. Especially when it comes to protecting what's mine."

The possessive note in his voice made my pulse skip. *What's mine. When did I start thinking of that as comforting instead of threatening?*

"Oh." The word came out smaller than I intended. Something about knowing he'd arranged protection without needing to be there himself made my heart do complicated things. *He didn't need to show off or take credit- he just... helped.*

"Thank you," I said softly, meaning it more than I had in a long time.

"Between husband and wife," his voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse skip, "there's no need for thanks." *Husband and wife.* The words hit differently now, making heat creep up my neck. This morning's marriage registration felt like a dream, but his casual use of our new status made it suddenly, startlingly real.

"Now that he's gone," Brandon continued, "get some rest. And pack your things- I'll come get you in three days."

After he hung up, I sank onto my couch, mind spinning. The events of the past twenty-four hours felt surreal -from Grandpa's birthday party to my parents' betrayal to... marriage. To Brandon Stark, of all people.

*But he's different, isn't he?* The thought came unbidden. Besides my grandfathers, he was the first person to protect me without expecting anything in return. Even when I'd rejected his initial proposal,he'd respected my decision while still looking out for me.




The next three days felt like walking through a storm. My phone buzzed constantly with messages from my parents while headlines about the Windsor drama filled my social media feeds. The Wall Street Journal's headline made my stomach drop: "Windsor Family Threatens to Withdraw $200M Investment from Capital Corp After Heir's Mysterious Injury."

*God, they're really milking this story.* I scrolled through the article,catching phrases like "incident at Taylor family gathering" and "sources close to the family suggest potential lawsuit." According to the gossip columns, Richard Taylor had been seen practically camping outside Mount Sinai Hospital, desperately trying to smooth things over with the Windsors.

My phone lit up with yet another call from Father. After twenty-seven missed calls, I finally answered, more out of exhaustion than anything else.

"Summer!" His voice carried that particular blend of anger and desperation I'd grown up fearing. "Do you have any idea what you've done? The whole Windsor family is out for blood!"

"What I've done?" The words came out sharp with disbelief. "You mean defending myself after you and Mother tried to..." My voice cracked. "After you drugged me and left me with that monster?"

"Charles Windsor is from an excellent family. This marriage would have saved Capital Corp! Instead,you've ruined everything with your stubborn-"The dismissal in his tone made something snap inside me.

"Saved Capital Corp?" I couldn't hold back a bitter laugh. "By selling your daughter? Is that really your solution?"

His voice rose dangerously, "Everything I've done has been for this family's future! The Windsors are threatening to pull their investment-do you know what that means? Capital Corp will be finished on Wall Street!"

"And somehow that's my fault? Not yours for trying to..." I had to take a deep breath before continuing. "What kind of father drugs his own daughter and leaves her with a stranger?"

"I did what had to be done!" The raw fury in his voice made me flinch despite myself. "If you had just played along, everything would be fine!But no, you had to make a scene, had to embarrass us in front of everyone-"

"Make a scene?" The words exploded from me. "You tried to sell me! Your own daughter! And now you're angry because your plan failed?"

His voice turned cold. "Summer, listen carefully. You will go to the hospital. You will apologize to Charles Windsor. You will do whatever it takes to fix this mess you've created. If you play your cards right, maybe he'll still consider-"

"Still consider what?" My hands were shaking so hard I could barely hod 
the phone. "Marrying me? After what you and Mother did?"

"This isn't about what you want!" He shouted. "This is about family loyalty! About duty! About-"

"Enough! Just shut the fuck up!"

I ended the call and immediately blocked his number, my hands shaking as fresh tears spilled down my cheeks.

My hands shook slightly as I sorted through my belongings, deciding what to take to Brandon's. The process felt strangely therapeutic- like shedding an old skin, leaving behind the naive girl who'd trusted her family unconditionally.

Just then, my phone rang again. The number looked vaguely familiar, but after that draining conversation with Father, I was too emotionally exhausted to think straight. *If this is another relative trying to guilt-trip me...*

"Who is this?" I answered sharply.
###Chapter 35: We're Already Married

**Brandon's POV**

"You haven't saved my number?" I kept my voice carefully neutral,though something dark and possessive twisted in my chest at the realization.Through the phone, I could hear Summer's breath catch.

"I'm sorry..." Her voice came out small, uncertain. "I forgot."

"Explain." The word carried more weight than I intended, but the thought of her not even having my contact information sparked something dangerous in me. *My wife shouldn't have to search for my number.*

"It's just... so much has happened lately..." She trailed off, and I could picture her nervous fidgeting perfectly.

"I'm downstairs." I watched the entrance to her building through the Bentley's tinted windows, remembering how she'd looked this morning in my shirt. The memory made something warm coil in my stomach. *Soon she'll be permanently in my home,where she belongs.*

"What? Already?" The surprise in her voice almost made me smile. Almost."I need to pack some things-"


"Stay where you are." I cut her off smoothly, already moving toward the building's entrance. "Wait for me." The elevator ride felt endless, though I knew it couldn't have been more than thirty seconds. My fingers tapped a restless rhythm against my thigh as I watched the floor numbers climb. When the doors finally opened,I found Summer already waiting in her doorway,wearing a simple sundress that somehow managed to look more appealing than any designer gown.*She has no idea how beautiful she is, does she?* Her eyes widened slightly as she took in my appearance. "You really came up yourself..."

"Obviously." I moved past her into the apartment, scanning the space with new eyes. The place was smaller than my walk-in closet, but there was something undeniably... Summer about it. Books arranged by color on floating shelves, a small collection of throw pillows arranged just so on a modestly sized sofa, everything neat but lived-in. *This is where she's been living, while her family plotted against her.*

"I haven't finished packing," she said quickly, gesturing to several half-filled suitcases scattered around the living room. "I didn't expect you so soon."


Without waiting for her to continue, I moved to the nearest suitcase and began efficiently organizing its contents. The sight of her personal belongings-delicate blouses,well-worn books,carefully folded sweaters-stirred something possessive in my chest. *All of this will be in our home soon.*


Summer's surprise was evident. "You don't have to..."

Before I could respond, familiar footsteps sounded in the hallway."Seriously, Brandon?" Sean's voice carried clear annoyance as he appeared in the doorway. "You dragged me away from surgery for this? Edward couldn't help?"

I continued folding one of Summer's cashmere sweaters,enjoying how the soft material felt against my fingers. "Professional movers aren't reliable enough." *And I don't want strangers handling my wife's belongings. "Oh?" His eyes sparkled with barely suppressed mischief as he took in the scene. "So you thought a surgeon would be better? Though Brandon Stark doing manual labor- that's a sight I never thought I'd see."I shot him a warning look while carefully placing the sweater in the suitcase. "Make yourself useful or leave."

Sean's grin widened as he picked up a box of books. "The mighty CEO of Stark Group, packing a lady's clothes. If Wall Street could see you now..."

"Shut up and work," I growled,though there was no real heat in it.*L them see. Let everyone see that Summer is different.*

Summer shifted nervously, clearly uncertain how to handle our interaction.
"There's...quite a lot of stuff..."

"That's not a problem." I moved to examine another open suitcase,methodically reorganizing its contents for maximum efficiency. The task was oddly satisfying - each item carefully placed, each space perfectly utilized. *Like pieces on a chessboard, everything falling into its proper place.*

"But if I'm moving out, shouldn't I give notice to-"

"Keep it." The words came out more commanding than I intended, but the thought of her having no retreat, no space of her own, didn't sit right."The Hamptons estate has everything you need,but you might want to come back occasionally."

Sean chose that moment to set down another box, his eyes dancing with barely contained amusement. "Well, well! Ms. Taylor, I'm Sean Sullivan,this tyrant's best friend and occasional accomplice." I felt rather than saw Summer's tension at the title. "Hello, Dr. Sullivan. I'm Summer... Taylor." The slight pause before her surname made something possessive stir in my chest. "It's going to be Summer Stark, am I right?" Sean's eyebrows shot up as he glanced between us. "Focus on the boxes." I cut him off before he could say anything else, lifting a particularly heavy trunk myself. The physical exertion felt good-a tangible way to contribute to this transition in our lives. *When was the last time I did something like this with my own hands?*

Summer, ever the perfect hostess, tried to salvage the awkward moment."Would you like something to drink?"

"I'd love a-" Sean started.

"He doesn't need anything." I interrupted smoothly, carefully stacking another box. "Keep packing."

The next hour passed in a blur of efficient movement. Between the three of us, the apartment slowly emptied, each box and suitcase a step closer to our new reality. I found myself oddly invested in the process, taking particular care with anything that seemed personal or fragile.

"Thank you for helping, Dr. Sullivan," Summer said once the last box was loaded, watching as I secured it in place.

"Please, call me Sean." He flashed her that trademark charming smile that had half of Manhattan's society women swooning. "Though I have to ask -are you sure about moving to The Hamptons? That's quite a-"

"Problem?" I asked quietly, letting just enough danger seep into my tone.

"Not at all!" Sean held up his hands in mock surrender. "Though Brandon.your reaction is a bit obvious, don't you think?" Summer glanced at her watch. "Why don't you both sit down for a bit? I'll just make a few simple dishes - it won't take long."Neither Sean nor I refused, and she took our silence as agreement, heading straight for the kitchen.

 I watched her move efficiently around her small kitchen,the sight of her cooking in that sundress doing complicated things to my chest. The domesticity of the moment felt dangerously appealing.

Once she was fully occupied with preparation, I turned to Sean. "You can leave now."


"You can leave now." I directed the words at Sean, who was already opening his mouth to accept. My shirt was slightly damp with sweat from the moving, but I felt oddly satisfied.This kind of physical work was far from my usual routine, but doing it for Summer felt right.


"Hey, this is still Summer's apartment, and she offered lunch!" Sean's eyes danced with mischief. "You're not her husband yet, what right do you have to kick me out?"

"About that..." I couldn't help the dangerous smile that curved my lips as I watched understanding dawn on Sean's face."We're already married."
###Chapter 36: I Need Mrs. Stark, Not Just Summer Taylor
**Brandon's POV**

"You can't be serious." Sean's voice dropped to a whisper as he watched Summer busy herself in the kitchen, his usual playful demeanor replaced by genuine shock.


I allowed myself a dangerous smile, enjoying his reaction. "Have you ever known me to joke about such things?"


"Brandon..." His eyes narrowed as he studied my expression. "Have you lost your mind? She's nothing like-"


The temperature in the room dropped several degrees as I fixed him with a cold stare, cutting off whatever he'd been about to say. Sean might be one of my closest friends, but some topics were off limits. He knew that better than anyone.

"Whatever you're planning," he continued in a lower voice, "Summer's innocent in all this. If she knew the truth about-"

"I know exactly what I'm doing." My tone brooked no argument. "This doesn't require your interference. Summer is my wife now. It's that simple."

Sean ran a hand through his hair, a gesture I recognized from our college days- his tell when he was genuinely worried. "Simple? Will the Stark family accept her? You know better than anyone how deep Wall Street's waters run."


"Is that why you're opposed?" I-couldn't help the slight amusement that crept into my voice. Sean had always been the most straightforward of our group,wearing his concerns on his sleeve.


He wisely changed the subject, though his eyes remained troubled. "Just... be careful. Not everyone adapts well to our world."

"Like how you chose to be a surgeon instead of taking over family business?" I kept my tone light, but we both knew the weight behind those words. The Sullivans were one of New York's most powerful family. But Sean had never cared about any of that.

I still remembered the uproar his decision had caused. The entire Sullivan family had opposed his choice to become a surgeon rather than takeover the family business. Even now, years later, the tension remained palpable at any Sullivan family gathering. But Sean had always been stubbornly independent, following his own path regardless of others'opinions. He'd chosen surgery despite unanimous family opposition, and looking at him now, it was clear he had no regrets.

"My decisions, like yours, don't require others' approval." I continued

Sean shrugged, some of his usual humor returning. "Come on, I became a surgeon specifically to avoid all this financial district drama."

The sound of plates clinking in the kitchen drew both our attention.Summer moved with unconscious grace as she prepared dinner,completely unaware of our conversation. Something in my chest tightened at the sight of her in my space, so naturally domestic it almost hurt.

"Dinner's ready," she called, her voice carrying that hint of uncertainty that made me want to both protect and possess her. "Brandon," Sean's grin turned mischievous as we moved toward the dining room, "who would have thought Mrs. Stark would be such a domestic goddess?" "Just eat." But I couldn't quite hide my satisfaction at his use of her new title. Summer set down a perfectly arranged plate in front of me, her cheeks flushing slightly as our fingers brushed. "I'm sorry if it's not up to restaurant standards..."

"Much better than hospital cafeteria food,"Sean assured her with that easy charm that had half of Manhattan's society women swooning."You know,there aren't many Manhattan socialites who still cook these days."

"Please have more if you like it." The shy pride in her voice made something possessive stir in my chest.

I watched her take small, careful bites, hyperaware of every movement.When a strand of hair fell across her face, I couldn't resist reaching out to brush it back, enjoying how she froze at my touch.

"The food will get cold," she mumbled, trying to hide her reaction.

Sean's eyes danced with barely suppressed amusement. "Mrs.Stark,you should know - Brandon isn't nearly this gentle normally."


"Sean." I let just enough warning seep into my voice. "Didn't you just finish surgery?"


"Not tired at all!" He backtracked quickly. "Summer's cooking is really excellent."


After dinner, as we moved to the living room, Sean brought up the inevitable: "Now that you're married, when are we getting together with the others?" I glanced at Summer, noting how she tensed at the mention of social obligations. "When she's ready." "Anytime works for me-us surgeons have way more flexible schedules than you finance types. It'd be great to get Edward and everyone together." Summer's eyes widened slightly. "The Wall Street Four Kings... that's the group people always talked about?"

"You've heard of us?" I couldn't help the pleased note that crept into my voice.

"At Columbia," she admitted, not meeting my eyes. "Students used to talk about you all the time."

"So you were interested in me even back then?" I couldn't resist teasing her,enjoying how her cheeks flushed darker.

"Mr. Stark, please don't joke!" She twisted her fingers nervously. "I didn't even know you then. It was just campus gossip."

Once Sean had finally left, I turned to find Summer still looking adorably flustered. "It's getting late. Let's go home, Mrs. Stark."

"Could you... not call me that?" The way she ducked her head made something warm unfurl in my chest.

"Why not?" I kept my voice gentle but firm. "We're legally married now.You need to get used to your new identity."

She bit her lower lip, a gesture that never failed to capture my attention."Do you know why I'm not introducing you to anyone else yet?"

"Why?" Her voice came out small, uncertain. "Because I need Mrs. Stark, not just Summer Taylor." I watched the words land, noting how her eyes widened slightly. "Until you fully accept that identity, I won't introduce you to anyone. Do you understand?" "I... I'm sorry." She wouldn't meet my eyes. "I'll give you time to adjust." Looking at her now - still shy, still uncertain,but trying so hard-I felt that dangerous possessiveness rise again. *Well,*I thought, watching her fidget under my gaze.*She'll understand exactly what it means to be Mrs. Stark.*
###Chapter 37: You Can't Go Back on Your Wor d
**Summer's POV**

The Hamptons estate materialized out of the gathering dusk like something from a dream. As Brandon's Bentley glided through wrought iron gates that probably cost more than my entire apartment, my stomach did a complicated flip. *What have I gotten myself into?*

"All of this..." I gestured vaguely at the sprawling grounds, the manicured gardens, the elegant fountains. "This is yours?"

Brandon's lips curved into that dangerous half-smile I was starting to know too well. "Most of this area." His casual tone made something flutter in my chest. *Most of this area. Right. Because owning just one massive estate would be too modest.*

James stood waiting at the entrance, his professional mask firmly in place despite the late hour. As Brandon guided the car into what had to be the world's most impressive garage, I couldn't help the small gasp that escaped.The space looked more like a luxury car showroom than a private garage-gleaming floors, perfect lighting, and more exotic cars than I'd ever seen in one place.

"These are all..." I trailed off, not quite sure how to finish that sentence without sounding completely overwhelmed.

"You have a driver's license?" Brandon's deep voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse skip. "Got it at Columbia." *Back when life made sense and I wasn't suddenly married to one of Wall Street's most powerful men.*His dark eyes studied me with that unsettling intensity. "That Porsche- won it from Dr. Sean last year in a bet. Barely drive it. You can use it."

"What? No!" The words came out too quickly, too sharp. "I mean, I can just use Uber."

"A car is basic necessity here." The way he saidit-like gifting six-figure vehicles was perfectly normal- made my head spin. "You'll need it for work. The area's quite isolated."

"It's too expensive..." Even as I said it, I knew how ridliculous it sounded.To Brandon Stark, a Porsche probably was like a basic necessity.

"As my wife, this is the minimum standard." The casual possessiveness in his voice sent an unexpected shiver down my spine.

The house itself-if you could call something this massive a house- took my breath away. Modern minimalist design somehow managed to be both imposingly elegant and subtly welcoming. Floor-to-ceiling windows offered stunning views of the ocean, and every piece of furniture looked like it belonged in a museum.

"Besides James, there's no permanent staff," Brandon explained as he led me through rooms that could have comfortably housed my entire apartment building. "Professional cleaning service comes three times a week. Private chef on call whenever needed."


"I can cook!" The words tumbled out before I could stop them. "I mean. I'm not great,but..."

His dark eyes held mine for a moment longer than necessary."That would be...interesting."


We reached what had to be the security hub, and Brandon's fingers flew over a sleek control panel. "Put your hand here," he instructed."Need to set up your biometrics." I placed my palm against the cool surface,watching in fascination as green light traced my fingerprints. "Thisis like something out of a spy movie."

"Fingerprints, iris scan, facial recognition." He guided me through each step with surprising patience. "The code is my birthday."

"Oh..." Heat crept up my neck as I realized I had no idea when that was."When is..."


"You don't know?" Something flickered across his face-disappointment?

"You never mentioned it," I said quickly, hating how defensive I sounded.

"June 5th."

"Wait, that's..." I stared at him in shock. "That's my birthday. How did you... are we born on the same day?"

"You seem quite unconcerned about your husband." His tone carried just a hint of reproach that made my stomach twist with guilt.

"I..."

Something about his expression made me reach for my bag, where I'd carefully stored our marriage certificate. My hands trembled slightly as I unfolded the document, scanning until I found the information. There it was, in black and white: June 5th, 1992."Oh my god." The words came out as barely a whisper. "We really do have the same birthday." "Oh my god." The words came out as barely a whisper. "We really do have the same birthday."

 *Same birthday. What are the odds?* Something warm and complicated unfurled in my chest at this discovery. It felt like the universe was playing some elaborate joke-or maybe trying to tell me something.

My mind was still reeling from this revelation as we reached the master bedroom. The space was stunning -a 180-degree ocean view,custom furniture that probably cost more than my yearly salary, and a walk-in closet bigger than my entire apartment.

Brandon carried my suitcases in himself, moving with that predatory grace that seemed to come so naturally to him. I watched in stunned silence as he began efficiently arranging my things in the massive closet, which had clearly been prepared for my arrival. Half the space was already organized with empty hangers and drawer space, waiting to be filled.

"Actually..." My voice came out smaller than intended. "Maybe my things could go in one of the guest rooms?"

He continued hanging my clothes as if I hadn't spoken.

"I mean..." I twisted my fingers nervously. "We're still getting to know each other."

"Summer." His deep voice brooked no argument. "We're married. As your husband,I see no reason for separate rooms."

"But we barely know each other!" The words burst out before I could stop them. "You said you'd give me time." "I did." He turned to face me, those dark eyes pinning me in place. "Time to adjust to our relationship. Not to create more distance between us." "This is all happening so fast." My voice cracked slightly. "I need time." "Too fast?" One perfect eyebrow arched. "I find it rather slow." "Hmm?"Brandon moved toward me with that predatory grace, backing me up until I stumbled against the wall. I found myself caught between the cool surface at my back and his overwhelming presence,my hands pressed flat against the wall as I tilted my head back to meet his gaze.He was close enough that I could feel the heat radiating from his body.barely inches separating us.

He braced one hand against the wall beside my head, effectively caging me in. The position forced me to look up at him, making me acutely aware of our height difference and how completely he dominated my personal space.*When did the room get so warm?*

I unconsciously licked my dry lips, watching his dark eyes track the movement. "You..."

"Brandon, you can't do this!" Frustration finally overcame my nervousness."You can't go back on your word!"

"I promised you time to adjust." His tone left no room for argument."I never mentioned separate rooms."

I stared at him, torn between admiration for his logical trap and frustration at being outmaneuvered. *He's right - technically,he never promised separate rooms.* But something in his expression made me wonder if he'd planned this all along.
###Chapter 38: The First Night

*Summer's POV*

"If I really wanted to do something to you," Brandon's deep voice had carried that dangerous edge that never failed to make my pulse race,"would I need to wait until now?"

I'd frozen as hhe withdrew his hand, my voice coming out small: "I'm sorry..11


"No needto apologize." His dark eyes had held mine with unsettling intensity. "We're married now. I'll treat you as my wife, and you need to remember-I'm your husband."

He'd continued after a moment, his tone carrying a weight that made my skin prickle: "If I really wanted to take advantage of you,those two times you were drugged would have been perfect opportunities. But I don't prey on the vulnerable."

My heart had clenched painfully at the reminder."I..."

"T'll give you time to adjust," he'd said finally, "but not indefinitely. You take the master bedroom. I'll use the guest room."

Despite the luxurious comfort of the custom king-size bed, sleep eluded me completely. Every time I closed my eyes, memories of the day flooded back.

*Our shared space.* The thought alone made my heart race. Everything felt surreal, like I'd stumbled into someone else's life by mistake.

After an hour of tossing and turning, I finally gave up on sleep. The house felt different at night - all sleek shadows and quiet elegance. As I padded down the hallway in my simple pajamas, I couldn't help feeling like an imposter in this world of casual luxury. A warm glow spilled from Brandon's study, the door left slightly ajar.I hesitated.torn between curiosity and caution. *Should I knock? Just walk away? What's theprotocol when you're married to someone you barely know?*

Before I could decide, his deep voice carried through the gap: "Come in."

Heat flooded my face as I pushed the door open. Brandon sat on an Italian leather sofa, surrounded by stacks of documents. He'd loosened his tie and rolled up his sleeves, somehow managing to look even more devastating than usual. The sight of those forearms shouldn't have affected me so much, but something about the casual intimacy of the moment made my pulse skip.

"I didn't mean to disturb you," I said quickly, suddenly very aware of my bare feet and simple sleepwear. "I just couldn't sleep and saw the light..."

His dark eyes studied me with that unsettling intensity I was starting to know too well. "Trouble sleeping in a new place?"

"Something like that." I shifted nervously, unable to meet his gaze. The study was incredible - floor-to-ceiling bookshelves lined with everything from investment treatises to rare art books. My fingers itched to explore them. "Your collection is even more impressive than Grandpa Jonathan's."

"Looking for something specific?" The amusement in his voice made me realize I'd been staring at the books like a kid in a candy store. "No, I just..." I grabbed the nearest volume, needing something to do with my hands. "I saw you weren't in the guest room, so..." "Work doesn't stop for personal matters." He set aside some papers,giving me his full attention. "Today's impromp tu move threw off my schedule." The guilt must have shown on my face because his expression softened slightly. "Come here." My feet carried me forward before my brain could object. Up close, I could see the subtle signs of fatigue around his eyes, though his posture remained perfect as always.

"It's just..." The words stuck in my throat as I watched him loosen his tie further. "About our marriage... could we keep it quiet for now? At least from my grandfathers?"

One perfect eyebrow arched."Why?"

"You know how Grandpa Thompson is." I twisted my fingers nervously. "I just ended things with Alexander, and even though he likes you. I explicitly told him nothing would happen between us..."

"And now we're married." That dangerous half-smile played at his lips."Worried about his reaction?"


"He'll think I was lying to him!" The words burst out before I could stop them. "And Grandpa George... after everything that happened at his birthday party..."

"Summer." The way he said my name made my skin prickle. "They'll find out eventually. Hiding it will only make things more complicated."

"I know. I just need time to figure out how to tell them." I sank onto the sofa beside him, careful to maintain some distance. "Everything's happening so fast." He studied me for a long moment, his expression unreadable. "You're overthinking things." "Easy for you to say! You're..." I gestured vaguely at him,encompassing everything from his perfect posture to the casual authority he  radiated."You. And I'm just..." "My wife," He cut me off smoothly, those two words carrying enough weight to make my breath catch. "That's all that matters."




Sunlight was streaming through the windows and the smell of coffee filled the air,waking me up.

The smell of breakfast drew me downstairs like a siren song.I found Brandon in the kitchen, looking unfairly attractive in casual clothes as he moved with easy confidence between professional-grade appliances. The sight of him cooking was so unexpected it stopped me in my tracks.

"Sleep well?" He didn't turn around, but I could hear the smile in his voice.

"You cook?"

"Basic skills." He plated what looked like a perfect omelet. "Freshly squeezed orange juice in the fridge."

I retrieved place settings, hyperaware of his presence as we moved around each other in the massive kitchen. Everything felt strangely domestic, like we'd been doing this for years instead of hours.

"I can cook next time," I offered, watching him add a sprig of herbs with chef-like precision. "You shouldn't have to..."


"I'm used to it." He set a plate in front of me, the presentation worthy of a five-star restaurant. "Eat. You'll need energy for work." The mention of work sent a jolt of anxiety through me. Reality crashed back in - I still had to face Fortune Corp, deal with Alexander and Victoria,navigate this new life I'd chosen. As if reading my thoughts, Brandon pulled something from his pocket.The keys sparkled in the morning light as he set them beside my plate."For the Porsche. You'll need it for the commute."
"But what about you?"

That dangerous half-smile played at his lips. "Worried about me already?"

Heat flooded my face. "That's not what I meant!"

"The car's yours." His tone brooked no argument. "I have other options."

The drive to Fortune Corp felt surreal, like I was playing dress-up in someone else's life. The Porsche handled like a dream, responding to the slightest touch. *This is really happening,* I thought, watching the speedometer climb. *I'm married to Brandon Stark, driving his car,sleeping in his bed...*

The familiar sight of Fortune Corp's parking garage helped ground me.But as I pulled into a spot, a shadow fell across my window. My heart nearly stopped as I recognized that silhouette.

"Summer." Alexander's voice carried that particular blend of concern and condescension that used to make my heart flutter. Now it just made my skin crawl. "We need to talk."

Before I could respond, his hand shot out, grabbing my wrist as I tried to step away from the car. "Let go!" The words came out sharp with genuine anger.
###Chapter 39: How Did I Ever Love Him?

*Summer's POV**

"Nice car." Alexander's eyes fixed on the Porsche,something ugly flickering across his features. "Who bought it for you?"

I kept walking, refusing to engage. But his next words stopped me cold.

"This quickly, Summer? I didn't think you'd find another Stark so fast."

The insinuation in his tone made my blood boil. "Move, Alexander.Some of us actually have work to do."

He stepped closer, eyes fixed on the Porsche's keys in my hand. "Custom edition. Must have cost a fortune." His laugh held no humor. "Though I guess that doesn't matter when you're sleeping with-"

"Don't." The word came out sharp as a blade. "You lost any right to comment on my life when you chose Victoria."

His hand shot out, grabbing my wrist with bruising force. "Lost the right?After three years together, you thinkyou can just-"

"Let. Go." Each word carried ice as I tried to pull away. "We're in the company parking lot. Is this really how you want people to see you?""Let them see." His grip tightened painfully. "Everyone already knows our history. That day at your apartment, how could you call the police? You wouldn't even listen-" "Because there's nothing left to say!" I finally managed to wrench free, my heart pounding against my ribs. "You're engaged to my sister. End of story," He followed as I strode toward the elevator, his longer legs easily keeping pace, "It's not that simple and you know it. Victoria,the engagement-it's 
just business.Her shares in Capital Corp-"

"Stop following me." My voice carried more steel than I feltas I jabbed the elevator button repeatedly. Come on, come on.*


The moment the doors opened, I darted inside, praying they'd close before he could follow. No such luck. Alexander slipped in just before they shut,effectively trapping me in the small space.

"Summer." His voice softened to that particular tone that used to make my heart flutter. "Just listen to me. Please."


I pressed myself against the far wall, maintaining as much distance as possible. "There's nothing to discuss."

"Victoria means nothing." He moved closer,crowding me into the corner."The engagement, her fifteen percent of Capital Corp - it's all just strategy.Once I secure my position in the company..."

"You're disgusting." The words burst out before I could stop them. "Do you even hear yourself? You want both sisters? Is that it?"

His eyes darkened dangerously. "You know you're the only one I really want. Victoria's shares are just a stepping stone. Once everything's settled-"


The elevator dinged open onto the executive floor, and I practically bolted out. But Alexander caught up in the empty hallway, spinning me around to face him. "Summer,wait-" "Don't touch me!" But his arms came around me from behind, pulling me against his chest in a twisted parody of intimacy. "Just wait for me," he breathed against my ear, the familiar scent of his cologne making my stomach turn. "Once I have control of Capital Corp,we can-


The crack of my palm against his cheek echoed in the quiet hallway.We both froze, stunned by the sudden violence of it. My hand stung from the impact, but the shocked look on his face was worth every second of pain.

"Today never happened." My voice came out steady despite my racing heart. "Try this again, and I won't be so nice. We're done,Alexander.Forever."


I didn't wait for his response, just turned and walked away on legs that threatened to give out. My whole body trembled with the aftermath of adrenaline as I practically ran to the executive washroom.

The elegant space was mercifully empty as I leaned over the marble sink,trying to scrub away the feeling of Alexander's touch. The water was probably too hot, but I welcomed the sting. Anything to erase the memory of his hands on me.


*How did I ever love him?* The thought came unbidden as I stared at my reflection. The woman in the mirror looked different somehow - stronger maybe, or just more aware. I'd told myself over and over that Alexander meant nothing to me now, but the memories still had the power to hurt.He'd been my dream once, back when we weren't even together. He was a few years older than me, and I'd always see him after classes. Back then, I didn't even understand what it meant to like someone. Just seeing him was enough to make me happy. Then one day he happened to help me out of a tight spot, and we became friends. Everything was beautiful then, before Victoria inserted herself between us.Even when my family pushed me away, he gave me warmth. Alexander was the first person who ever celebrated my birthday with me. My eyes stung as memories flashed through my mind like shooting stars.I remembered everything from back then, but the man in those memories was long gone. Time, it seemed1. had been the greatest destroyer of what we'd had.


The sound of voices in the hallway pulled me from my spiral of memories.

"Did you see Taylor's new car?" The words carried clearly through the door. "That Porsche must have cost a fortune."

"In Manhattan, a Porsche isn't that special." A second voice chimed in.dripping with false moderation.

"This isn't just any Porsche- it's a custom edition. Word is it belongs to someone from Stark Group."

"Really? You think Summer Taylor found another Stark that quickly?"

"Careful," a third voice warned. "The walls have ears at Fortune Corp."

Their footsteps faded away, but their words lingered like poison in the air.*Let them talk.* I thought, straightening my spine as I checked my
makeup one last time. *They don't know anything.*

The walk to my office felt longer than usual, every pair of eyes following my progress down the hallway. The whispers weren't even trying to be subtle anymore. "Good morning, Director Taylor!" The chorus of greetings carried varying degrees of sincerity as I passed the analyst pool. I managed a professional smile, keeping my head high. "Good morning,everyone."My office felt like a sanctuary as I closed the door behind me,finally allowing my shoulders to drop. The view of Manhattan stretched out beyond my windows, reminding me of mornings in Brandon's kitchen.*Brandon.* Just thinking his name brought a complicated mix of emotions.

"Amy?" I pressed the intercom button, needing to focus on work before I got lost in thoughts of my new... husband. *God, that word still feels surreal.* "Could you come in for a minute?"


Amy appeared with her usual efficiency, tablet ready. "Yes, Miss Taylor?"
###Chapter 40: Is He Doing This Because of Me?
 **Suimmer's POV**

"Come in, Amy." I gestured to the chair across from my desk. "It's been a year since last time you worked for me. I'm hoping you can come back to my side as my assistant."

She perched on the edge of the seat, professional mask firmly in place despite the tension radiating from her. "I... I wasn't sure if you'd still want me as your assistant."

"Why wouldn't I?" I kept my voice gentle, remembering all the late nights we'd spent preparing presentations, all the times she'd covered for me when I needed a moment to breathe. "You've always been my most reliable support."

Her eyes flickered to mine before quickly looking away. "Since you returned from Europe,you haven't come to me. I thought you don't want me as your assistant anymore..."

"And I apologize for not communicating with you sooner."

Something in Amy's posture relaxed slightly. "No, Miss Taylor, you don't need to apologize. I've heard... things. But I've worked with you and Mr.Alexander Stark before. I know the rumors can't be true." My heart warmed at her loyalty, even as a familiar ache bloomed in my chest at the mention of Alexander. *Focus on work,* I told myself firmly."Well,since you're staying with me, let's concentrate on the tasks at hand." I pulled out the European division's files, spreading them across my desk."I need your help reviewing all this data, especially the projects involving Stark Group." Amy's professional demeanor snapped back into place as she accepted the documents. "Of course. What should I focus on?"

"Cash flow patterns and project termination rates." I tapped a particular spreadsheet meaningfully. "Some of these numbers don't quite add up."




The boardroom felt like a shark tank as I took my usual seat, careful to keep my expression neutral despite the tension crackling through the air.Old Mr. Stark sat at the head of the table,his usual commanding presence somewhat diminished by the dark circles under his eyes. *Trouble sleeping?Good.*

Lawrence's smug smile as he arranged his papers made my skin crawl.But it was Alexander's late entrance that really caught my attention - his normally impeccable appearance slightly disheveled, tie askew as he slid into his seat.

"Alexander." Old Mr. Stark's voice cracked like a whip. "This is the third time you've been late."

"Sorry, Father." Alexander straightened his tie with fingers that trembled slightly. "There were some issues with the Windsor family..."

"Sit down." The dismissal in Old Mr. Stark's tone would have been funny if I hadn't been so focused on maintaining my professional mask."Lawrence,continue your report."I let Lawrence's droning voice wash over me as I reviewed my own notes one last time. The pattern we'd uncovered was impossible to ignore -systematic withdrawal of Stark Group investments, strategic termination of key projects, a slow but steady erosion of Fortune Corp's foundation. "And that concludes the quarterly performance review." Lawrence's voice carried that particular note of self-satisfaction that always made me want to throw something at him. "As you can see, despite some minor setbacks...

1

"Actually." I couldn't quite keep the steel from my voice as I stood. "I noticed some concerning trends in the data."

The projector hummed to life as I brought up the first chart. "Over the past three months, Stark Group has been systematically reducing their investment position. Here-" I highlighted a particularly dramatic drop,"you can see the pattern accelerating."

"These numbers are misleading!" Lawrence's face had taken on an interesting shade of red. "Our relationship with Stark Group remains strong as ever."

"Really?" I switched to the next slide, watching his expression carefully. "Then how do you explain these terminated projects? Each one was vital to our growth strategy, yet they were all canceled with minimal notice."

"Brandon did this!" Alexander's outburst earned him a sharp look from his father.

"Control yourself." Old Mr. Stark's voice could have frozen hell itself.But I caught the flicker of fear in his eyes as he studied the data. "How will this affect our IPO plans?" I took a deep breath, steeling myself for the impact of my next words."Based on current trends, we're looking at a minimum six-month delay.And that's assuming other investment firms don't follow Stark Group's lead." The silence that followed felt heavy enough to crush diamonds. I could practically see the wheels turning in Old Mr. Stark's head as he processed the implications. Fortune Corp needed that IPO - needed it desperately,if my analysis was correct. "These projections." Lawrence tried again, though his voice had lost some of its earlier confidence, "they're based on incomplete data. If we just-"

"The data speaks for itself." I met his gaze steadily, refusing to back down."Unless you'd like to explain why these particular projects were terminated?Their profit margins were well above threshold."

I watched Alexander squirm under his father's intense scrutiny,remembering how that same gaze used to terrify me. Now it just seemed...pathetic. A man desperately trying to maintain control as everything crumbled around him.


"He's always been jealous," Alexander started, then seemed to realize how childish that sounded. "I mean, the timing can't be coincidental. Right after Summer-"

"Enough." Old Mr. Stark cut him off with a sharp gesture. "This meeting is adjourned. Everyone except Alexander, leave."




I'd barely made it three steps out of the boardroom before Lawrence materialized beside me, his usual smug expression replaced by something darker.


"Miss Taylor." His voice dripped with false concern as he blocked my path."That was quite a performance in there." His face darkened. "Do you have any idea how important this IPO is to Old Mr. Stark? The damage you've done today-" "Then we should address the real issues," I interrupted, "instead of hiding uncomfortable truths." I turned to leave, done with this conversation. "You'll regret this, Summer Taylor." His words followed me down the hallway like poison. "Mark my words." I returned to my office, finally allowing myself to relax slightly. Fortune Corp had always depended heavily on Stark Group as its major backer-Brandon's family enterprise. And Brandon wasn't just any exeeutive at Stark Group; he was the CEO and future heir to the entire empire.

Alexander's branch of the Stark family was merely a small offshoot of the main line. Fortune Corp had always survived by relying on Stark Group's support.


*So this sudden withdrawal of projects and support from Stark Group...*My heart skipped a beat as a new possibility occurred to me. *Is Brandon really doing this because of me?*
###Chapter 41: You Are The Boss's Wife

**Brandon's POV**

"Sir." James's measured tone drew my attention from the city vista."Fortune Corp's will have to postpone it's IPO plans..."

"The higher they climb, the harder they fall." I settled into my custom leather chair, enjoying the weight of the moment. "They lack the ability to survive on Wall Street. Always."

"I understand, sir." James's efficiency was one of his best qualities. "I'll continue monitoring the situation."

"And Summer?" The name left my lips before I could stop it.

Something flickered across James's face -too quick to read. "Mrs. Stark raised concerns about reduced investment projects during Fortune Corp's morning meeting.Lawrence attempted to...create difficulties."

My fingers stilled on the Mont Blanc pen I'd been toying with. "Lawrence?"*That parasite dares to challenge my wife?* "His courage is... noteworthy."

"Should I..." James began.

"No." The word came out sharper than intended. "Let her handle it." *She needs to learn to navigate these waters herself.* James cleared his throat softly. "About the Windsor situation - Charles has received a formal warning from the family. Regarding the proposed $200million investment in Capital Corp, George Windsor hasn't officially commented, but appears to be allowing the situation to develop." "George Windsor." I couldn't help the dark amusement that colored my tone."That old fox knows exactly what's happening. Always has.""Charles seems unlikely toaccept defeat quietly. Especially concerning the investment-"

"She needs this." I cut him off, my mind filled with images of Summer's vulnerable strength. "Some lessons must be learned through pain to truly sink in."

The intercom buzzed. "Mr. Stark? Tommy from Finance is here with the quarterly reports."

"Send him in." I turned back to James. "Keep monitoring the Windsor situation."

Tommy entered with that particular nervousness I'd come to expect from junior staff. Harvard Business School graduate, top of his class-and currently sweating through his Armani suit.

My phone buzzed just as Tommy was setting up his presentation. Summer's contact photo lit up the screen, making something warm unfurl in my chest despite the timing. I'd changed her contact information to "Wife" in her phone yesterday, and "Husband" in mine. *Let's see if she's noticed.*

"Hello?" Her voice carried that hint of uncertainty that never failed to stir something possessive in me.

"Still not used to my new contact name?" I kept my tone light, enjoying how I could practically hear her blush through the phone.

"I..." She faltered, exactly as expected. "Busy?""Just reviewing some reports." Her voice steadied slightly. "It's trading hours-is something wrong?" "One moment." I turned my attention to Tommy,who had gone pale as he reviewed his own numbers. "Explain these quarterly figures." 
"I... I need to verify some data..." His voice cracked slightly.

"A Harvard graduate who can't understand basic financial statements?"The temperature in the room dropped several degrees. "These errors-you dared to bring them to me for signature?"

Tommy's facade cracked completely. "Mr. Stark, please let me explain..."


"Speak."

"It was... it was the CFO's suggestion." The words tumbled out in a rush."He said if it could just get past my review..."

*Interesting.* "James." I didn't need to raise my voice. "Have the CFO sent up. Immediately."

"Yes,sir."

Tommy practically fled the room, leaving his flawed reports scattered across my desk. A soft breath on the phone line reminded me Summer was still listening.

"Still there?" I gentled my tone automatically.

"Yes..." Her voice wavered slightly. "I heard..."

"Did I frighten you?" The thought bothered me more than it should have.

"No." Her voice came through clear and steady. I couldn't help but smile. "Good to hear that." "What did you actually call about?" The question carried a hint of curiosity. I paused, considering my words carefully. "Just wondering about dinner plans. Would you prefer to eat at home or go out?" "Let me get this straight," Summer's tone held equal parts amusement and 
disbelief. "You called during trading hours just to discuss dinner plans?
Mr. Stark, may I remind you that you're at work?"

"Hmm." I could perfectly picture her expression. "I'm the boss."

"Well, I'm not!" The frustration in her voice was oddly endearing. "Some of us have actual work to do!"

"You're the boss's wife."

When silence felI on her end, I frowned slightly. "Nothing to say to that?"

"You've said it all, haven't you?" Summer's resignation carried a touch of humor. "Whatever works for dinner is fine. I'm not picky."

"That won't do." My frown deepened. "Your eating habits might be hard to change, but now that you're with me, they need to improve." A thought occurred to me. "I could pick you up after work?"

"No, no, absolutely not!" Her quick refusal was almost amusing. "Our offices are on opposite sides of Manhattan. It makes no sense."

"Oh?" I arched an eyebrow. "Am I that unpleasant to be seen with?"

"That's not it at all!" The panic in her voice made my lips twitch. "You know how far apart our offices are, and during rush hour... it would waste so much of your time!" She paused, then continued more thoughtfully,"How about we meet somewhere in the middle?" She hesitated before adding softly, "What would you like? I could cook for you?" Something warm unfurled in my-chest at her offer. I caught sight of James hovering in the doorway with Robert, the CFO, and held up a hand to signal them to wait. James, ever efficient, turned to Robert. "Mr. Stark requests a moment." "Of course, of course! No rush!" Robert's quick agreement barely registered.

"The General Manager needs me," Summer said to someone on her end."Brandon, I have to go -something's come up!"

"Fine. Let me know when you're done with work?"

"I will!" She hung up quickly.

I found myself staring at the phone screen. a smile lingering at the corners of my mouth. But as James led Robert into my office,all traces of warmth vanished from my expression.

"Mr. Stark," James announced, "the CFO is here."
###Chapter 42: Confrontation

**Brandon's POV**

The smile vanished as quickly as it had appeared. "Make him wait. Ten minutes." My voice carried that particular edge that made even seasoned executives flinch. *Let him stew. Fear makes men honest.*

Through the glass walls of my office, I watched our CFO's reflection in the window. Johnson stood in the reception area, already showing wrinkles from his constant fidgeting. *Guilty men always fidget.* His eyes kept darting to his phone, probably wondering if he had time to warn Matthew.

I turned my attention back to the financial reports spread across my desk,each page meticulously annotated by James. The discrepancies were obvious now that we knew where to look - clever, but not clever enough. *Matthew, Matthew. Did you really think you could hide this from me? In my own company?* The thought almost made me smile. Almost.

"Ten minutes have passed, sir." James's voice carried that perfect neutrality that made him invaluable. He understood the game we were playing - the careful chess match where timing was everything.

"Bring him in." I didn't look up from the documents,letting the weight of silence do its work. Johnson entered with the careful steps of a man approaching his executioner. His attempt at a confident smile looked more like a grimace.Even from here, I could smell his expensive cologne - another little luxury that should have been beyond his means. *Following the money always reveals the truth.*"Mr. Stark, about this morning's report-" His voice already held a tremor.*Too easy.*"Sit." I didn't bother looking up from the documents, letting him marinate in his own anxiety. Years of experience had taught me that silence was often the most effective interrogation technique.

James caught my eye, his expression carrying the question we'd discussed earlier. A slight shake of my head was enough-we'd worked together long enough that words weren't necessary. He knew his role in this play.

"Tll prepare the SEC documents," James announced as heleft,dropping the three letters that could end any Wall Street career. The effect on Johnson was immediate and visceral - a visible tremor ran through him,and his perfectly manicured hands clutched the armrests of his chair.

I let the silence stretch, mny fingers drumming a slow, deliberate rhythm against the polished surface of my desk. Each tap seemedI to increase Johnson's discomfort. Beads of sweat formed on his forehead despite the perfectly regulated temperature of my office. *The guilty always sweat.*

"You should understand how to read a balance sheet." I picked up one of the reports, noting how his eyes followed the movement like a mouse watching a snake. "These numbers. Walk me through them."

"Mr. Stark, if you're referring to the quarterly projections, I can explain-"His words tumbled over each other in their haste to escape.

"Three months." I cut him off smoothly, watching his face for the moment of recognition. "How long have you been falsifying these accounts?"The color drained from his face so quickly I could almost hear his blood pressure drop. "Falsifying? I don't-" "Do you really think I'd call you here without evidence?" The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees as I leaned forward slightly.The movement was minimal, but its effect was immediate-Johnson pressed himself back into his chair as if trying to escape. "How much did Matthew offer you? Shares? Cash? Or something else?" "Sir, my relationship with Mr. Matthew Stark is purely professional-"The lie sat heavy in the air between us, amateur and obvious.

"Are you sure you want to stick to that story?" I stood with deliberate slowness, moving to the window like a predator circling its prey.Manhattan stretched out below, a concrete jungle where I'd spent years ensuring only the strongest - only the loyal- survived. "The SEC has become quite... zealous about financial fraud recently."

A soft knock interrupted whatever protest Johnson was about to attempt.James entered with a fresh stack of documents, his timing pefect as always.We'd choreographed this dance carefully, each movement designed to break down Johnson's already crumbling resolve.

"Tommy's complete statement has arrived, sir." James's voice carried just the right note of professional detachment.

*Perfect timing, as always.* I gestured for James to set the papers on my desk,watching Johnson's reflection in the window. The man looked ready to faint, his expensive suit now wrinkled and damp with fear sweat. *The higher they climb, the harder they fall.*

"This is interesting." I flipped through the pages with deliberate casualness,each turn of a page making Johnson flinch. "A twenty million dollar transaction through a Cayman Islands shell company. Care to explain?" Johnson's professional facade finally crumbled like a sandcastle in high tide. "Mr. Stark, please!" The words burst from him like water from a broken dam. "Matthew... he threatened my son's position at Goldman Sachs. Said if I didn't help, he'd make sure the boy never worked on Wall Street again!" "Continue." One word, but it carried the weight of an imperial command.The floodgates opened. Johnson's words tumbled out in a des perate rush- Matthew's plans, the fake accounts, the network of shell companies set up to hide the manipulation. Each confession added another nail to Matthew's coffin. By the time he finished, his expensive suit was soaked with sweat,the fabric probably ruined. *Such a waste.*

"He said you were too powerful," Johnson's voice had dropped to barely a whisper, the last gasps of a drowning man. "Said the group needed...needed balance."

"Balance." The word tasted like ashes in my mouth. I picked up my phone,pressing a single button. Within moments, two SEC agents entered the office with the silent efficiency of well-paid professionals. Johnson's face went from pale to ashen as realization dawned.

One of the agents stepped forward, his government-issue suit a stark contrast to Johnson's bespoke tailoring. "Would you come with us, please?"

I watched through the window as they led him away, his shoulders slumped in defeat. The afternoon sun caught on the surrounding skyscrapers, turning them into mirrors that reflected the power of the financial district. *Another piece removed from the board.*

"Should I alert Matthew about the investigation?" James asked once we were alone, his voice carrying that slight edge of anticipation I rarely heard.

"No." A smile curved my lips, but it held no warmth - just the satisfaction of a predator watching its trap close. "Let him enjoy his illusion of victory a little longer. Three days, James. In three days,he'll come crawling back himself."
###Chapter 43: Call Me June

**Summer's POV**
I'd just hung up with Brandon, feeling a mix of emotions I couldn't quite name. Who would have thought he'd call during work hours just to ask what I wanted to eat?

Even though I was still adjusting to our relationship, his determination to build a real life together was clear. And if he was willing to take this seriously, then I needed to make an effort to adapt too.

Brandon was right about one thing - I couldn't live in the past forever,and I couldn't keep running away. The best approach was to face things head-on and learn to accept them gracefully. After everything I'd been through. I owed it to myself to build a better life.

\---

My phone buzzed again just as I was gathering my things to leave the office. Brandon's name lit up the screen, making my heart do a little flip despite my best efforts to stay cool.

"Done with work?".

"Yeah, I'm on my way." I juggled my bag while trying to lock my office door. "Should be there in about half an hour. What about you?"

"Just left the office. I'll meet you there." I found myself smiling as I ended the call. The drive to Whole Foods gave me time to wonder what I'd gotten myself into. *Shopping with Branadon Stark? The man probably has personal chefs on speed dial.* But all thoughts of personal chefs fled mny mind when I saw him waiting at the entrance. He stood with casual grace, one hand tucked into the pocket of what had to be custom-tailored dress pants, that dangerous half-smile playing at his lips. The late afternoon sun caught the sharp angles of his face, softening themn just enough to make my breath catch.
"Where's your car?" I asked, trying to focus on anything other than how the evening light caught his perfect features.
"James drove it back." His smile widened slightly at whatever he saw in my expression.

"Oh!" I knew I was staring, but I couldn't help it. Something about seeing him in this casual setting, away from the intensity of Wall Street, made him seem almost... approachable.*Almost.*

"My wife doesn't seem pleased?" The amusement in his voice snapped me back to reality.

"What? No! You must be seeing things!" Heat crept up my neck as I realized I'd been caught admiring him.

"Is that so?" His dark eyes held that dangerous glint I was starting to know too well. "Well, since I must be mistaken, I suppose I'll have to trouble my wife for a ride home."

"You could just call me Summer, you know." I tried to sound casual despite how my heart raced every time he said 'wife'.

"I like Summer," His hand came up to brush a strand of hair behind my ear, the gesture so gentle it made my heart race. "But I prefer this. "Then... maybe use a nickname?" I suggested,desperate to find an alternative to the formal 'wife' that made my stomach do backflips every time."I don't want to use names others call you." The intensity in his gaze made me forget to breathe for a moment. "Wife suits you perfectly. It's something only I can call you."

"Then think of something else that only you would use?" I couldn't quite keep the plea from my voice. *Anything but 'wife'- it makes me too aware of...everything.*

His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile. "I'll consider it."


"Oh!" The word came out embarrassingly breathy.

"Haven't thought of the right one yet." He gestured toward the store entrance.

Inside, watching Brandon navigate the produce section with practiced ease made something warm unfurl in my chest. "What foods do you like?" I asked, trying to focus on practical matters. "I should know your preferences if I'm going to be cooking. Are there things you don't eat?"

"I'm not particularly picky." Hlis long fingers drummed a gentle rhythm against the shopping cart handle. "As long as it's properly cooked. Though..." He paused, studying the sparse contents of our cart. "Is this alI you're planning to get? What about vegetables?"

"Can't we just grab whatever?" I gestured vaguely at the produce displays."They're all basically the same, right?"

"Not actually. So my wife prefers meat dishes?" The amusement in his voice made me blush.

"Yeah!" I couldn't help smiling at the memory. "When I was little, I used to love Grandpa Thompson's cooking. I can't make it quite as well as he did,but I always ate so mnuch when he cooked, especially the meat dishes."
Heat crept up my neck as I realized I was rambling. "Is that weird?"

"Not at all." His dark eyes held mine with unexpected warmth. Watching him expertly select vegetables and check produce quality, I couldin't help commenting. "Maybe I should just let you handle all the cooking!"
"If that's what my wife prefers." His casual acceptance made my heart do a complicated flip.
"I thought you were going to think of a different name for me?" I tried to change the subject before my face could get any redder.
"Still considering options." His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile that never failed to make my pulse race.
"You could call me June." The words tumbled out before I could stop them."I was born in June. Grandpa used to say it was when summer really began, so he called me that when I was little."

Something flickered across his face - surprise maybe?-before his expression settled into that familiar gentle intensity. "June..." He said it like he was tasting the word, and something about the way it rolled off his tongue made my stomach flutter. "I'll think about it."

As we continued through the store, I found myself studying him with new eyes. The way he moved - elegant and purposeful even doing something as mundane as grocery shopping. The quiet authority in his bearing that made other shoppers unconsciously step aside. Even here,in fluorescent-lit aisles between cereal boxes and canned goods, he carried himself with that natural grace that seemed to come as easily as breathing.*This is my husband,* I thought, watching him compare two different brands of soy sauce with the same intensity he probably used to evaluate million-dollar deals. The word still felt foreign,but something about seeing him like this - so capable and yet so... human - made it feel a little more real. A little less overwhelming."You're staring again. June." His voice carried that dangerous edge of amusement.

"Am not! Wait, what did you call me?"
###Chapter 44: Please Forgive My Husband


**Summer's POV**
"June." Brandon said, eyeing me. "We were both born in June, when summer really begins... You grandpa don't call you that now, does he?"
I shook my head, something warm unfurling in my chest at the way he said it. The nickname Grandpa used to use felt different coming from Brandon's lips- more intimate somehow, like a secret shared between us.

His dark eyes studied my reaction, and something in that intense gaze made mny pulse skip. The way he watched me- like he was cataloging every micro-expression, every subtle shift in my features - should have been unnerving. Instead, I found myself holding my breath, waiting for his verdict.

"Good." That dangerous half-smile played at his lips,the one that never failed to make my stomach do complicated flips. "It suits you." His voice dropped lower, carrying that velvet-soft quality that sent shivers down my spine."My June."

*My June.* The possessive note in his voice made heat creep up my neck.It was better than 'wife', at least - that title he'd been using all day that made me hyper-aware of our new status. But there was something about the way he said this nickname, like he was claiming it as something just between us, that made my heart race even faster.I tried to distract myself by watching him navigate Whole Foods. His long fingers moved with surprising delicacy as he tested the ripeness of a peach,and I caught myself staring at the way his rolled-up sleeves revealed his forearms.*Stop it,* I scolded myself. *They're just forearms.* "These need to be eaten fresh," he said, expertly examining some heirloom tomatoes. "Three days maximum." I quickly put back the extra ones I'd grabbed. "Oh, right.I didn't think about that."
His eyes caught mine, that hint of amusement I was starting to recognize dancing in their depths. "First time grocery shopping properly?"
"Hey! I shop for groceries!" But even I had to admit my usual shopping habits involved a lot more instant meals and a lot less...whatever that exotic-looking vegetable was that he'd just added to our cart.
I was so busy watching him examine an artichoke (*who knew vegetables required such careful inspection?*) that I didn't notice the runaway shopping cart until it was too late.
"Ow!" The metal frame caught my leg hard enough to make me stumble.Brandon's arm shot out to steady me, but the damage was already done.

"Oh my god, I'm so sorry!" A harried-looking woman hurried over, her bag swinging wildly as she tried to corral a child who seemed more interested in his iPhone than the havoc his mother's cart had caused. "I was just trying to stop him from-are you okay?"

Before I could respond, Brandon was already crouching to examine my leg,his touch surprisingly gentle as he checked for injury. "Does it hurt?" "I'm fine," I started to say, but couldn't quite suppress a wince as his fingers found a tender spot. But it wasn't what I was focused on - it was the way Brandon's jaw clenched when he saw my reaction to the pain, the barely perceptible tightening of his fingers on my waist."Brandon," I said softly, resting my hand on his shoulder. The expensive fabric of his shirt couldn't quite hide how tense his muscles were. "Really, I'm okay." His dark eyes met mine, and the intensity in them made my breath catch.We stayed like that for a moment, caught in some strange bubble where the bustling store around us seemed to fade away. Then his hand moved from my waist to brush against my cheek, so quickly I might have imagined it if not for the lingering warmth of his touch.
"I'm really sorry!" The woman was still apologizing, though her voice faltered slightly when Brandon straightened to his full height,his expression making the temperature around us drop several degrees."Should we...do you need a doctor?"

"It's okay," I said quickly, recognizing the look in Brandon's eyes. "Really,I'm fine. These things happen."

The woman glanced between us, clearly picking up on Brandon's displeasure. "Are you sure? I could..."
"We're fine." Brandon's tone could have frozen hell itself. The woman beat a hasty retreat, practically dragging her oblivious child behind her.

"You didn't have to scare her," I said, trying to take a step and immediately regretting it. "It was an accident."

Brandon's eyes narrowed as he watched me wobble. "You're limping."

"Just a little!" But before I could protest further, he'd swept me up into his arms like I weighed nothing. "What are you doing? Put me down!"

Instead of answering, he deposited me directly into the shopping cart,ignoring my squeak of protest. "Brandon Stark! You can't just..." "Don't move." The command in his voice made me pause mid-struggle."Unless you'd prefer the hospital?"I slumped back against the cart, face burning as I noticed other shoppers trying (and failing) not to stare. "This is ridiculous. I'm not a child!" "Either this or the hospital." His lips curved into that infuriating half-smile. "Choose."
"Fine!" I crossed my arms, trying to maintain some dignity despite my position. "But can we at least hurry? Everyone's staring!"

Something dangerous glinted in his eyes. "Want to go faster?"

"What do you mean -*eek!*" The cart shot forward as Brandon gave it a push, sending us zooming down the aisle. My hair whipped around my face as we took a corner at what had to beillegal shopping cart speed."Brandon! Slow down!"

But I couldn't quite keep the laughter from my voice, and I swore I saw his smile widen slightly. We must have looked absolutely ridiculous - the CEO of Stark Group pushing his wife around Whole Foods like a scene from some romantic comedy. But somehow, I couldn't bring myself to care.

"Over there!" I pointed excitedly at the beauty section. "I need face wash!"

"Done." He smoothly-guided the cart in that direction, adding items to the basket around me with efficient grace.

We might have gotten away with it if I hadn't gotten a bit too enthusiastic about pointing out items, nearly tipping the cart in my excitement. The store security guard who approached us looked like he was having the worst day of his life.

"Sir, ma'am," he said with admirable professionalism despite the situation,"you're disturbing other customers."Brandon's expression could have melted steel. "And?" "Listen, sir..." The guard's face reddened. "Oh no, there's been a misunderstanding!" I cut in quickly, recognizing the signs of imnpending Brandon Stark intimidation. "We're really sorry about this. It's my fault for getting carried away." I gave the guard my most apologetic smile. "Please forgive my husband-he's not very good with words. Right. honey?"
###Chapter 45: A Stark's Apology

**Summer's POV**
I gave the security guard my most apologetic smile while gently tugging on Brandon's sleeve. The tension in the Whole Foods aisle was thick enough to cut with a knife, and I could practically feel Brandon's irritation radiating off him in waves.

The security guard -a middle-aged man who looked like he'd rather be anywhere else-shifted uncomfortably under Brandon's arctic glare. "Ma'am,we have policies about customer safety..."

"Of course you do!" I jumped in quickly before Brandon could say whatever was clearly brewing behind those dangerous dark eyes. "And you're absolutely right. We got a bit carried away, and it won't happen again."

Brandon's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. I knew that look - it was the same one he got right before destroying someone's career on Wall Street. *God, he's really not used to backing down, is he?*

"It's fine," I said softly, my fingers finding his wrist. "Really."

The security guard watched our interaction with visible relief as the temperature in the aisle seemed to drop back to normal levels. "Well,ma'am, you seem reasonable enough." The guard straightened his shoulders, clearly more comfortable addressing me than Brandon. "Since no damage was done, we'll let it slide this time. But you and your husband need to be more careful in public spaces. With our customer volume, safety has to be the priority." I nodded enthusiastically, "Absolutely. We completely understand,don't we?" I gave Brandon's sleeve another gentle tug. The silence stretched for what felt like hours but was probably only seconds. Then, just when I thought we'd be stuck in this standoff forever,Brandon did something that made my jaw drop.

"My apologies for the disturbance."

The words came out perfectly polite, though I caught the barest edge of ice in his tone. Still, the fact that Brandon Stark-*the*Brandon Stark-had actually apologized... *Is this really happening?*
The security guard looked as stunned as I felt, though he covered it quickly with a professional nod. "Right, well... just be more careful.Especially with the shopping carts."

As the guard walked away, I caught several other shoppers quickly averting their gazes. *Great. We probably just made someone's Instagram story.* The thought of Wall Street's most feared CEO being caught zooming around Whole Foods with his wife in a shopping cart was almost enough to make me laugh. Almost.

"Are you actually pouting?" I couldn't heIp asking as we made our way to the checkout. Brandon's expression was doing something complicated that on anyone else I would have definitely called a sulk.

"I don't pout." His voice carried that dangerous edge that probably sent junior executives running for cover.

"Mmhmm." I bit back a smile as I started unloading our cart. "You know,most people just say 'sorry' instead of..." His dark eyes fixed on me with that intensity that never failed to make my pulse skip. "I am not most people."

  "Trust me, I noticed." The words came out softer than I intended. Just then, James materialízed beside us. "Sir, I apologize for the delay.The Manhattan traffic..." "You could have been later." Brandon's tone could have frozen hell itself.

James, bless him, didn't even blink. "The construction on Fifth Avenue,sir..



"Just help with the bags." Brandon cut him off, though I caught the slight softening in his expression. Whatever James had been late for, it had apparently worked out in Brandon's favor.
The drive home started with me behind the wheel, trying not to feel too self-conscious about driving such an expensive car.
"Relax your grip on the steering wheel," Brandon instructed from the passenger seat. "You're not strangling a snake."
I forced my fingers to loosen slightly. "Easy for you to say. This car probably costs more than my annual salary."
"The car is insured." His voice carried that hint of amusement I was starting to recognize.."And I trust your driving more than your vegetable storage habits."

"Hey!" I couldn't help laughing despite my nerves. "I store vegetables just fine!"

I merged onto the highway,starting to feel more comfortable with the powerful engine. "You know, when you apologized back there..."
  
"Mm?" "I don't think I've ever seen you apologize to anyone before." His fingers tapped a gentle rhythm against the steering wheel. "I haven't." The casual admssion made something warm unfurl in my chest. "So why... "You know why." His voice carried that velvet-soft quality that sent shivers down my spine.
I did know why, and that knowledge made my heart do complicated things. Brandon Stark, the man who brought Wall Street titans to their knees, had apologized to a grocery store security guard. Because of me.
"About Fortune Corp." I said quickly, desperate to change the subject before my face could get any redder. "The reduced investments and terminated projects... that was you, wasn't it?"
His dark eyes flickered to mine for just a moment. "You're smart enough to figure that out."

"But why?" The question had been burning in my mind ever since I noticed the pattern. "Fortune Corp depends on Stark Group's support.Without your investment projects..."

"Sometimes," his voice dropped lower, carrying an edge of something dangerous, "people need to learn the cost of their choices."

The weight of his words hung between us. *He's doing this because of what they did to me,* I realized with a jolt. *He's systematically dismantling their foundation because they tried to hurt me.*

"You shouldn't..." I started, then stopped, not sure how to finish that thought. Shouldn't what? Shouldn't use his power to protect me? Shouldn't care enough to want revenge? "I do what I want, June," The way he said my nickname - soft but intense -made mny pulse skip. "Always have." I guided the Porsche into the Hamptons estate garage with probably more concentration than necessary, determined not to scratch Brandon's car on my first day driving it. As I turned off the engine, I felt oddly proud of managing the drive without any incidents. "Not bad." Brandon commented.
"Really?" I turned to him with a smile I couldn't quite suppress."No criticisms about my turning speed or gear changes?"
His dark eyes held mine with unexpected warmth. "You did well. June."

"Brandon?" I reached over to touch his sleeve, the expensive fabric smooth under my fingers.
###Chapter 46: She's Mine

**Summer's POV**
I found myself picking at a loose thread on my sleeve, unable to meet his intense gaze. "So Fortune Corp is really finished?"
Brandon studied me with that unsettlingfocus I was starting to know too well. "What's wrong? Having second thoughts?"
"You know that's not what I mean." I caught my lower lip between my teeth, hesitating. "Does it have to be this way?"
"The company's situation isn't something you need to worry about right now." His voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse skip. "Some things are better left unexplained until the right time."
"But if Fortune Corp goes under, what am I supposed to do?" The question burst out before I could stop it.

"I've told you before - you're smart." The casual confidence in his tone made something warm unfurl in my chest. "Finding a better position won't be an issue."

Heat crept up my neck as I realized how my concerns might sound."I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't be asking about Stark Group's internal matters."

"No." His dark eyes met mine briefly before returning to the road. "If you want to know, I can tell you." "It's fine." I swallowed hard, suddenly very aware of my position."I'm not a Stark Group employee,after all." "Need any help?" I leaned against the kitchen island, trying to look casual despite how my heart raced every time he rolled up his sleeves."I cancook too,you know."
His lips curved into half-smile. "You can wash the vegetables. There'll be plenty of chances for you to cook in the future. Why the rush?"
"Right." My body tensed slightly at his knowing tone.

The peaceful domestic moment was shattered by the sudden sound of the doorbell. I glanced at Brandon, surprised. "Who could that be at this hour?


His eyes narrowed slightly. "Go ahead and answer it."

I made my way to the door, wondering who would visit Brandon's private sanctuary unannounced. The moment I opened it, I let out a startled yelp and stumbled backward. A massive German Shepherd bounded forward,nearly knocking me over in its enthusiasm.

"I..." My voice came out as a squeak as I pressed myself against the wall.

Brandon appeared beside me in an instant. "What's going on?" His eyes found Dr. Sean standing in the doorway. "What are you doing here?"

"Heard Summer just moved in!" Dr. Sean's easy smile didn't falter under Brandon's cold stare. "Came to celebrate! Don't worry, Max is very intuitive -he only gets this excited around people he likes."

I managed a weak laugh, my heart still racing from the surprise encounter.

"Showing up uninvited?" Brandon's tone could have frozen hell itself. "Aw,come on! Surely Summer doesn't mind?" Dr. Sean's eyes danced with barely suppressed mischief. "I'll go check on things in the kitchen." I started to edge away,but Brandon's hand caught mine. "Were you scared?" His voice softened as he studied my face.

"It's nothing." I tried to smile despite my still-racing pulse. "Just startled me for a moment. You two catch up - I'lI get dinner ready."
I retreated to the kitchen, but their voices carried clearly as they moved toward the living room area. I couldn't help but listen as I pretended to be busy with dinner preparations.
"Going for the warm and caring husband angle?" Dr. Sean's teasing voice made me blush. "That's new."

*God,do they have to discuss this where I can hear them?* I focused intently on chopping vegetables, trying to ignore the conversation while simultaneously straining to catch every word.
"You know, this isn't very brotherly of you." Dr. Sean continued. "The rest of us are still single."

"Is that so?" Brandon's tone carried a dangerous edge that made me shiver even from the kitchen. "Should I call her back to hear this?"

"Brandon Stark, you're doing this on purpose, aren't you?" There was a pause, and I could practically picture Dr. Sean's grin. "Come on,what's really going on here?"

"You tell me. Why are you really here?" I heard movement, and their voices grew clearer as they approached the kitchen area. *Are they really going to continue this conversation right here?* My hands trembled slightly as I focused on stirring the pot,hyper-aware of their presence. "Like I said - celebrating! We were all supposed to get together,but clearly you're not readdy for that yet. If the others can't meet her, I had to at least check things out myself." There was a pause. "Max, sit!" "Are you serious about this?"
"We're legally married. What do you think?" Brandon's response made my heart skip despite its clipped tone.
"Alright, truth time." Dr. Sean's voice grew more serious. "You know how busy I've beenlately, and Max hates the hospital environment."
"You want to leave Max here? You saw how Summer reacted to him." The protective note in Brandon's voice made something warm flutter in my chest.

"Why not leave him with Edward?"

"You think I haven't thought of that? But you know Edward-he only likes his own dogs. I wouldn't be here if I had another option. I have to go to Boston for a medical conference the day after tomorrow."

"No way, Summer doesn't like it."

"Summer, Summer, Summer... Is everything's about Summer?"

I couldn't contain my curiosity any longer and peeked around the corner."What's about me?"

Dr.Sean turned those pleading eyes on me. "Summer, I'm desperate here.You wouldn't let Max stay home alone for a week without food or water,would you?" "He needs to be away for a week," Brandon explained, his dark eyes studying my reaction. "If you're comfortable with it, we can watch Max.If not,they'll leave right now." *He's actually asking my opinion instead of just deciding?* The realization made me pause. "I.., don't mind." "Max is super low maintenance!" Dr. Sean jumped in quickly. "Just give him a corner, and if you don't like him around, just keep him at a distance.


1
A sudden burning smell hit my nose. "Oh no.my stew!"

"Summer is... not bad at all." Dr. Sean's appreciation was evident in his tone.
"She's mine." Brandon's casual possessiveness made my cheeks flush.He turned to Dr. Sean. "Now that that's settled, isn't it time for you to leave?"
"Leave? No way! It's been ages since I visited, and it's dinner time! I remember the last time I had your cooking. Summer- it was amazing."

Brandon's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Sean, are you looking for a fight?"
###Chapter 47: June, Your Taste Is Already Per fect
**Brandon's POV*
Despite my reluctance, Sean had successfully managed to stay for dinner.As I watched him sitting at my dining table, playing with Max while deliberately ignoring my cold stares, I couldn't help but wonder why I'd tolerated him all these years. But that thought vanished the moment Summer walked in with the final dish.

The scent of Summer's cooking filled the room, transforming the usually austere space into something warmer, more intimate. I watched from the doorway as she moved around my kitchen with growing confidence, her simple movements holding my attention more than they should have.

"This is amazing!" Sean's enthusiastic praise made Summer blush, the color spreading across her cheeks in a way that stirred something possessive in my chest. "Brandon, where have you been hiding this amazing cook?"

I shot him a warning look, but he just grinnedclearly enjoying himself too much to take the hint. "The food is perfect as is," I said, my eyes finding Summer's. "No need for excessive praise." After dinner, Summer insisted on clearing the dishes despite my objections."I'm sure you have things to discuss." she said, waving us off. Sean raised an eyebrow at me as we headed upstairs to my study,but wisely kept his mouth shut until the door closed behind us. Max, his German Shepherd, had settled himself outside the kitchen, clearly hoping She ducked her head, but not before I caught the small smile playing at her lips. The sight made something warm unfurl in my chest, a feeling I wasn't quite ready to examine too closely. for scraps from Summer.

I pulled out two cigars, offering one to Sean. The familiar ritual gave me a moment to study his expression -something was bothering him,beyond his usual dramatic tendencies.

"Spill it." I said, lighting my cigar.
Sean's usual playful demeanor faded slightly. "StiIl reading me like a book,huh?"

"I wish I didn't have to." I took a slow drag, letting the silence build."What's happening with the Sullivans?"

His smile turned brittle. "What else? That damn cousin of mine. Michael Sullivan's decided to grace New York with his presence."

"Michael?" The name sparked a memory - ambitious, reckless, with none of Sean's natural charm to smooth over his rough edges. "Wasn't he settled in Boston?"

"You'd think." Sean ran a hand through his hair, a nervous tell I hadn't seen since our college days. "The family's in an uproar. You know how they feel about his...methods."

"You're not involved in the family business," I pointed out. "Why does this concern you?" "Because he's making it my concern!" The frustration in Sean's voice was real. "The medical conference is just an excuse. I need to lay low until he leaves town." "First time I've seen you run from anyone." I couldn't help the slight amusement in my tone. "Besides her." The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. Sean's expression shuttered, all traces of his usual warmth vanishing."Low blow.man. You were involved in that too,remember?"
"You brought it up." My voice carried an edge of ice. "I wasn't helping you-you were wrong for her."
"And who was right?" The bitterness in his voice surprised me. "You?"

"Anyone but you." The words came out sharper than intended. "You promised to let her go. You owed her that much."
"She probably still resents you for it." Sean's laugh held no humor. "Her own brother, taking my side."

"That's none of your business." The cigar had burned down to ash,forgotten in my hand. "Don't mistake my silence for approval. She wasn't right for you, and she wasn't right for the Stark family."

Sean studied me for a long moment, something calculating replacing his usual easy charm. "Speaking of family... word is you're making moves against Matthew? He might not be a Wall Street tiger, but even cats have claws."

"Take care." I said instead of acknowledging his warning. Some games were better played close to the chest.

By the time we headed back downstairs, Summer had prepared iced tea.The sight of her ín my kitchen, so naturally domestic, did something complicated to my chest. "Sorry, can't stay!" Sean called out, already heading for the door. "Got some follow-ups at the hospital. You two enjoy!" I watched Summer's face fall slightly at Sean's abrupt departure. "Want to try?"she asked, holding out a glass. "I made it earlier, justremembered it was in the fridge." The tea was perfect - exactly the right balance of flavors, served at the ideal temperature. Of course it was. Summer had that gift for getting things right. even when she didn't realize it.
"You're in Fortune Corp's project department?" I kept my voice casual,though the question was anything but.
She nodded, something guarded creeping into her expression. "Yes. Why?"


"Ever considered leaving?"

The way she tensed told me everything about how much thought she'd already given this idea. "What's your reasonfor asking?"
"Fortune Corp has hit its ceiling." I set down my glass,choosing my words carefully. "Old Mr. Stark lacks vision. He's trying to milk benefits from Stark Group instead of leveraging our resources for growth. A company like that will never thrive."

Summer pressed her lips together thoughtfully. "I may not understand things from your perspective as CEO, but Fortune Corp has had issues for a long time now. It's not exactly news."

"Why did you choose to join Fortune in the first place?" I asked.

"If I said it was for personal reasons," she said slowly, "would you think less of me?" "No." The word came out more forcefully than I intended. "Everyone misjudges people sometimes. Your judgment's better now - that's what matters." She twisted her fingers nervously, a gesture I was coming to know well. "I've always known I couldn't join Capital Corp. Never knew why, but I didn't really care either." A bitter laugh escaped her. "Sometimes I wonder,are these things really that important? Victoria and I never got along, and Alexander chose her because of these things."

"They are important." I moved closer. unable to stop myself from reaching out to still her restless hands. "You don't not care - you just understand there's a limit to their value. Compared to family, they seemed less important."
"But what would fighting get me?" The vulnerability in her voice made something protective stir in my chest. "I don't want that. Don't want to make things worse."

"You think things aren't bad now?" I couldn't keep the edge from my voice. "Haven't you noticed - the more you give in, the more they'll take?"

She looked up at me then, really looked, and something in her expression made my breath catch. "Do what you need to do," she said softly. "I'm just an employee there - you don't need to consider my feelings." A pause,then: "Want more iced tea?"

"Yes."

I watched her pour another glass, her movements graceful and precise.Something about seeing her here, in my space, felt dangerously right. Like a piece clicking into place that I hadn't known was missing.

"June." Summer's eyes widened at my words. "Your taste is already perfect.Don't let anyone tell you otherwise."
###Chapter 48: Old Friend

**Summer's POV*

The next day, I found myself speaking with Amy in my office.

"Something's off about these numbers." I frowned at the spreadsheet on my desk, tapping my pen against the polished wood.
Amy leaned over my shoulder, "The withdrawal patterns are too systematic."she agreed. highlighting another row of data. "It's almost like-"
My phone's sudden buzz made us both jump. The familiar ringtone cut through the afternoon quiet of my Fortune Corp office, and something in my chest tightened when I saw the caller ID. *No way...*

"Hello?"

"Hey girl! Come pick me up!"

The voice hit me like a physical shock. "Ruby? You're back in New York?"

"Yep, your girl's back!" Her laugh hadn't changed at all, still carrying that infectious energy that had gotten us through countless all-nighters at Columbia. "Less talk, more action - comeget me!"

"Where are you?" My voice cracked with excitement. "Why didn't you tell me you were coming?" "Tell you later. I'm near Columbia. Car trouble, of course." Her tone carried that familiar mix of exasperation and amusement that made me want to laugh despite myself. "Got it, I'll be right there!"I turned to Amy, already gathering my things. "Something came up and I need to head out. Let's wrap up for today. If anyone asks, just say I'm out. 
Amy's eyes flickered toward the door before returning to me."′′Okqy.But if Mr. Alexander Stark comes..."
"Don't worry about him, and don't tell him where I went!" The keys to Brandon's Porsche felt warm in my palm as I headed for the door. "Oh.and those files for the Stark Group project -give them directlyto Mr.Stark.Tell him I'm out doing field research."
The familiar streets around Columbia brought back a flood of memories as I navigated the Porsche through afternoon traffic.
I spotted Ruby before she saw me - the bright yellow sundress was impossible to miss, even if everything else about her had changed.Her once-long hair was now cut in a stylish bob, and her skin had darkened to a rich tan that spoke of serious time in the sun. She stood on the corner of 116th Street, somehow managing to juggle two ice cream cones while waving frantically with her free hand.

"Over here!"

"You've lost weight!" I couldn't help staring as I pulled up to the curb."And you're so tan! Why did you cut your hair? It was so beautiful!"

Ruby rolled her eyes, passing me one of the ice cream cones before climbing into the passenger seat. "Beautiful? Try maintaining long hair in Africa! Had to go practical. Plus it's way cooler like this!" "Africa?" I nearly dropped my ice cream. "What were you doing there?" "War correspondent." She grinned at my shocked expression. "What? Di you think I'd stay in Manhattan forever? Though speaking of changes...Her eyes traveled over the Porsche's interior with obvious appreciation. "Nice wheels! You're doing well for yourself!" Heat crept up my neck. "It's nothing special. I'm just an employee. If you're talking about the Porsche, it's my husband's."
The ice cream cone stopped halfway to Ruby's mouth. "Husband? What's going on? You said you and Alexander didn't get married?"
"We didn't." I kept my eyes fixed on the road ahead,grateful for the excuse not to meet her gaze. "I married someone else. It's... complicated."

Then I explained what had happened to Ruby briefly.

"So you married a guy you barely knew for a month?" The concern in her voice made my chest ache.

"Don't look at me like that. It's... not what you think."

Before she could respond, my phone buzzed. Brandon's name lit up the screen. making my pulse skip despite my best efforts to stay cool.
"It's me." His deep voice carried through the speaker. "When are you finishing work?"

"I... you might need to handle dinner yourself tonight."

"Hmm? Why's that? Meeting someone?"

"Yes, I'm out with a friend right now!"

"Tell your husband to join us!" Ruby called out, loud enough that I knew Brandon must have heard."Stop it!" I hissed, but Ruby just grinned wickedly. "Friend?" Something in Brandon's tone made my skin prickle. "Male or female?" "Hey Summer, let's meet this husband of yours!" Ruby's voice carried clear mischief. "You're married now, right? As your best friend, I need to check if he's hotl If he's not up to standard, dump him-I'll find you someone way better looking than that jerk Alexander!"
He+Sgood looking, he's good looking!" I felt my face flame. "Ruby,please stop!"
"Um...my friend's a bit crazy, just ignore her." I wanted tosink into the leather seats and disappear.

"I see." Was that amusement in his voice? "If it's your best friend,spend time with her.June."

My heart did a complicated flip at the nickname. "Huh? What is it?"


"Nothing.Come home soon."

"Okay, this won't take long. Um... what do you want to eat? I can bring something back?"

"Alright. I'll wait for you."

The moment I hung up, Ruby pounced. "Ooh, so your husband IS hot!"


"You're impossible!"

"What? How is this my fault? 'Husband'? Seems like you two get along pretty well?"

I couldn't quite hide my smile. "'It's... okay. He's not bad."

Ruby's expression softened. "As long as he treats you right. I was worried about the Alexander and Victoria situation affecting you, but seeing you now, I feel better. Stop being shy - if you're married, make the best of it.Bring him around sometime!"


"Okay!" The word came out more enthusiastic than I'd intended.
We ended up at our old favorite restaurant near campus. the familiar smells bringing back a rush of memories. Ruby caught me up on her adventures-the wildlife conservation projects in Africa, her new job at a major news outlet, the crazy stories she'd collected along the way. It felt like no time had passed at all.
My phone buzzed again just as we were finishing dessert. It was Brandon again.
"Stay out longer with your friend." His voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse race.

"What? But you haven't had dinner- I was going to bring you something."


"Don't worry about it. I need to go out."

The silence stretched between us for a moment.

"I need to return to the Stark mansion." Something in his tone made me pause. "Some matters to attend to."

"Oh! That's fine then, go ahead. I'll stay out with Ruby a bit longer!"


But even after I hung up, something felt off.

"Earth to Summer!" Ruby waved her hand in front of my face."You're thinking about him again, aren't you?"

"What? No!" But the heat in my cheeks betrayed me. Ruby's grin turned knowing. "Girl, you've got it bad! But hey, at least this one seems better than Alexander. I mean, letting you use his fancy car?Actually caring about where you are and who you're with? That's already a huge upgrade!" I walked Ruby backs to her hotel, promising to meet up again soon. But as I drove home alone in Brandon's Porsche, the emptiness of the passenger seat felt more noticeable than usual. The familiar route to the Hamptons estate stretched out before me. and I couldn't help wondering what"matters" had called Brandon back to the Stark mansion.
###Chapter 49: Just This Once

**Brandon's POV**
The Stark mansion materialized out of the gathering dusk, its imposing silhouette a reminder of everything I'd spent years trying to leave behind.The familiar drive felt longer than usual, each turn bringing back memories I'd rather forget.
"Welcome back, sir." The butler's carefully neutral tone carried years of practice as I pulled up to the entrance.

I lowered the window slightly. "Who's home?"

"Your father and grandfather are both in residence, sir. Your sister has also arrived."

*Sarah.* The name alone made something tighten in my chest. I nodded curtly and guided the car toward the garage, already regretting my decision to come. Butsome battles needed to be fought in person.

"Uncle Brandon!"

The high-pitched squeal of delight was my only warning before a small figure launched itself at me the moment I stepped out of the car. I caught Angela instinctively, years of practice taking over as my niece wrapped her arms around my neck. "How did you get here?" I couldn't quite keep the surprise from my voice.The garage wasn't exactly a typical hangout spot for seven-year-olds.

 Angela's round face lit up with that innocent joy that made her the only true bright spot in this family. "With mommy! We came to see you!" She planted a wet kiss on my cheek, completely unfazed by my usual stern demeanor. "Did you bring me a present?"I found myself smiling despite everything, the expression feeling foreign on my face. "And why would I have a present?”
"Because you always do!" She pouted adorably. "Mommy says you never come home anymore. Why don't you visit us?"
Something warm and complicated unfured in my chest, but I kept my expression neutral. "We'll see each other soon."
"Sarah." I acknowledged my sister's presence without turning.Her footsteps had always been distinctive - cautious, hesitant, like she was perpetually walking on eggshells.

"Brandon." The tension in her voice was familiar too. "Father and Grandfather are waiting."

Angela's small hand found mine as we walked toward the main house,her cheerful chatter a buffer against the storm I knew was brewing.The entrance hall hadn't changed-still the same oppressive grandeur,still the same portraits of Stark patriarchs glaring down from the walls.

"That troublemaker's finally here?" William Stark's voice carried clearly from the study, sharp wwith displeasure. Same tone he'd used since I was fifteen and refused to follow his precious "traditional" path.

"Father." Robert Stark's attempt at peacekeeping was as ineffective as ever."Brandon's not a child anymore.""Not a child?" The scoff in William's voice could have stripped paint. "Look at what he's doing to Stark Group! Throwing out loyal employees,dismantling decades of tradition..." I let their voices wash over me as I guided Angela toward the study. She skipped beside me, completely oblivious to the tension crackling through the air.*At least someone in this family still has their innocence.* The study door opened before us, revealing the familiar tableau-William in his throne-like chair. Robert hovering nearby like an anxious courtier.Sarah perched on the edge of a sofa as if ready to flee at any moment.
"Great-grandpa!" Angela's enthusiasm cut through the tension like a knife through butter. "Uncle Brandon's here!"
William's expression softened slightly as it always did for Angela, but his eyes remained cold when they fixed on me. "So, the prodigal son returns."
"Grandfather." I kept my voice neutral as I settled into one of the leather chairs,positioning myself so I could see everyone's faces. "You wanted to see me?"

He tossed a folder onto the coffee table between us. "Matthew's complaint.Care to explain yourself?"

I picked up the folder without opening it, already knowing its contents."Explain what? That one of your old guard has been embezzling company funds? Or that he thought his connection to you would protect him?"

"You ungrateful-" William started to rise, but Robert placed a warning hand on his shoulder.

"Brandon." My father's voice carried that particular note of disapproval I'd grown immune to years ago. "These men have served the company faithfully for decades. Your grandfather trusted them-""And that trust was misplaced." I cut him off smoothly, watching Sarah flinch at my tone. "The market has changed. Stark Group needs to evolve." "Evolution doesn't mean destroying everything we've built!" William's face had taken on that particular shade of red that usually preceded one of his legendary tirades. "No." I agreed, my voice carrying an edge that made Sarah shift nervously. "But it does mean removing dead weight."

"Brandon, please." Sarah finally spoke up, her voice barely above a whisper. "Think about what you're doing. Matthew has connections throughout the industry. If you force him out..."
"Only this once." The words dropped into the silence like stones into still water."I'll let him keep his shares, out of respect for Grandfather. But his resignation letter needs to be on my desk by morning."

"You-"William started, but I was already standing.

"Angela." I turned to my niece, who had been unusually quietduring the exchange. "Time for me to go home."

Her lower lip trembled slightly. "But Uncle Brandon, this is your home too!

n

*Home.* The word tasted bitter. I smoothed her hair gently, the gesture automatic after years of practice. "I'll seeyou soon,okay?"

The balcony offered temporary refuge from the suffocating atmosphere inside. The familiar scent of old money and older prejudices followed me out, but the cool evening air helped clear my head.

"Brandon!" Sarah's voice carried a note of desperation as she followed me out. "You can't do this!" I lit a cigarette, watching the smoke curl into the darkness. "Can't I?""He's family-" "No." I cut her off without turning. "He's your investment partner.Don't think I don't know about your little side deals." The sharp intake of breath told me I'd hit my mark. "How did you..." "I grew up watching you defend me from the nannies, Sarah."The memory almost made me smile. Almost. "But I'm not that little boy anymore. And I won't let anyone use my weakness against me-not even you."
The silence stretched between us, heavy with years of unspoken words.Finally, Sarah's quiet footsteps retreated, leaving me alone with the night air and my thoughts.



The Hamptons estate felt different when I finally returned - warmer somehow, despite the late hour. The sound of running water drew me toward the master bathroom, where steam curled invitingly through the half-open door.

Summer stood at the sink in a silk robe, her wet hair falling in dark waves down her back. She caught my reflection in the mirror and turned, those expressive eyes widening slightly.

Summer must have felt the weight of my gaze, because she suddenly followed my line of sight. Her eyes widened in realization, and she quickly crossed her arms over her chest protectively.

"Ah, you... when did you get back?" Her voicecame out higher than usual,
a flush creeping up her neck.
###Chapter 50: Making Sure He Eats Somethin


**Summer's POV**
The steamy air wrapped around me like a warm blanket as I stood in front of the master bathroom mirror, my damp hair falling in dark waves down my back. Brandon's silk robe felt impossibly soft against my skin-I'd found it hanging in the closet and couldn't resist trying it on, especially since he was supposed to be at the Stark mansion tonight.
I twisted slightly, watching how the expensive fabric caught the light. The bathroom was still filled with steam from my shower,giving everything a dreamy,surreal quality.
Then I caught a glimpse of something in the mirror that made my heart stop. *No. No way.*

Brandon stood in the doorway, his dark eyes reflecting in the foggy mirror as they traveled over my form with dangerous intensity. I spun around,suddenly very aware of how the silk clung to my still-damp skin.

"Ah, you... when did you get back?" My voice came out embarrassingly high as I crossed my arms protectively over my chest. The robe suddenly felt far too thin, too revealing.

He didn't answer immediately, just continued to study me with that predatory focus. One corner of his mouth lifted. *Move, Summer!* I edged toward where I'd left my clothes, trying to maintain some dignity despite how my cheeks burned. By the time I'd grabbed my pajamas and ducked behind the shower curtain to change, I heard his footsteps retreating. I waited until my heart stopped racing before emerging from the bathroom,but Brandon was already gone. The master bedroom felt strangely empty without his overwhelming presence. 'What just happened?* I pressed my cool palms ngainst my flaming cheeks.trying to process the last few minutes. The memory of his intense gaze made something flutter in my stomach. Get it together, Summer.He's your husband - of course he's going to see you in various states of undress eventually.*
But knowing that didn't make it any less nerve-wracking.

After what felt like hours but was probably only minutes, I finally gathered enough courage to leave the bedroom. The sound of running water from one of the guest rooms made me pause. "A cold shower?* The thought sent an unexpected shiver down my spine.
I found myself drawn to Brandon's study, seeking comfort in the familiar space. The walls of leather-bound books reminded me of Grandpa Thompson's library, and I couldn't help running my fingers along their spines as I browsed.

"Interested?"

I jumped at Brandon's voice, nearly dropping the financial history text I'd been examining. He stood in the doorway, hair still damp from his shower,looking unfairly attractive in casual clothes.

"Grandpa Thompson has these in his study too." I managed to keep my voice steady despite how my heart raced. "Now I understand why you like collecting them." One perfect eyebrow arched slightly as he moved into the room with that predatory grace that seemed to come so naturally to him. "Looking for me?" The amusement in his tone made heat creep up my neck. "I..." My fingers twisted nervously in my shirt hem. *Why did I come here again?*"Yes or no?" His dark eyes held mine with dangerous intensity.

"My friend today..." I started, desperate to change the subject. "Ruby Scott-we were classmates at Columbia. She's been working as a war correspondent in Africa, just got back..."
"Is that why you didn't stay out longer?" He settled into one of the leather chairs, his presence somehow managing to fill the entire room.
"You had dinner at the Stark mansion, right?" The question tumbled out before I could stop it.
His expression shifted slightly, something dark flickering behind his eyes.

"You didn't eat?" Concern overrode my nervousness. "Brandon! How can you skip meals? That's not good for your health!"

He studied me with that unsettling focus. "I wasn't hungry."

"But you went to the mansion..." I trailed off as his expression closed off completely.

Without another word, I headed for the kitchen. The food I'd picked up from the new French place downtown would only need minimal reheating.I'd ordered it after our phone call earlier, but then he'd suddenly needed to go to the Stark mansion. I'd thought the food would go to waste,but now... *At least I can make sure he eats something.* The thought brought an unexpected smile to my face. "What did you get?" His deep voice behind me made me jump. "Just... whatever looked good," I gestured vaguely at the containers. "Have you washed your hands?" He nodded, accepting the plate I handed him. "Join me?" "I already ate with Ruby." But I found myself settling into the chair across from him anyway, unable to resist watching as he ate with that unconscious elegance that seemed to define his every movement.

His dark eyes caught mine.
Heat flooded my cheeks. "Ruby wants to meet you," I blurted out,desperate to change the subject. "But if you're too busy, it's fine! She just..wants to make sure I'm okay."

"When?"
"Whenever works for you..." I twisted my fingers nervously. "It won't be too much trouble?"

"No." His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile. "It's rare for you to want to introduce me to your friends."

"You must be starving!" I couldn't heIp noticing how quickly he was finishing the food. "You should have eaten at the mansion!"

"Indeed." The way he said it - soft but intense - made my skin prickle.

Later, as I lay in bed exchanging voice messages with Ruby about dinner plans, I couldn't help smiling at her enthusiasm.

"Come on, bring that husband of yours out!" Ruby's voice carried through my phone speaker. "If he can give you a Porsche, he can afford the best restaurants in Manhattan!"

"He is pretty successful..." I sent back, trying to keep my voice down.

"Then let's hit the most expensive places! Make him work for it!"

I laughed, holding down the voice message button. "Foodie! So... Per Se or Le Bernardin?".

"Per Se." Brandon's voice from the doorway made me yelp and nearly drop my phone.
"You were standing there the whole time?" I tried to sound stern despite how my heart raced at his sudden appearance.
"You were talking quite loudly." His dark eyes danced with barely suppressed amusement.
"That's still..." I huffed, then paused. "Wait, so... Per Se?"
###Chapter 51: Brandon, You'll Die A Horrible Death
**Brandon's POV**

The morning sun cast long shadows across my office as I reviewed the files James had prepared. Each document told its own story-a web of deceit carefully woven by Matthew and his allies. My fingers traced the edge of a particularly damning report, a slight smile playing at my lips. *They never learn. do they?*

The intercom buzzed. "Sir, the board members are arriving early."

"Good." I didn't look up from the files. "Keep Matthew waiting."

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows of my office, I could see Manhattan stretching out before me, a concrete jungle where I'd spent years ensuring only the strongest - only the loyal - survived. The timing was perfect.Matthew's desperation had made him sloppy, and now...

My phone vibrated with a message from James: "SEC agents in position."

I allowed myself a moment of satisfaction before tucking the final piece of evidence into my briefcase. The weight of June's marriage certificate brushed against my fingers - I'd taken to carrying it with me, though I'd never admit why, The thought of her brought an unexpected warmth to my chest, but I pushed it aside. *Focus. Business first.*

The boardroom fell silent as I entered, the tension thick enough to cut with a knife. Matthew sat at the far end, his usual arrogance unable to hide the nervous sweat beading on his forehead. The other directors shifted in their seats, eyes darting between us like spectators at a prizefight.

"Didn't Matthew have something to share with everyone today?" I kept my voice casual as I settled into my chair. "Brandon, do you really want to do this?" Matthew's attempt at confidence couldn't hide his unease.

"Uncle Matthew, you should know how I operate by now."

"What if I refuse?" His voice took on an edge of desperation. "You know that even though my shares aren't the majority,I still-"

"There are no 'buts'!" I cut him off sharply. "I've never liked negotiating with people who don't have enough chips to play with."

"Would you like to see what these documents contain?" I spread them across the table with deliberate precision.

"I don't believe you have anything on me." Matthew's voice cracked with false bravado. "Johnson's evidence might get me jail time at worst,but I've already sold my shares. Brandon, you think you can threaten me with this?



"Impossible!"

"This can't be!"

"How could this happen?"

One of Matthewv's allies spoke up, his voice dripping with disdain. "That's right! The annual dividends from Stark Group aren't even worth mentioning.These past few years under your leadership, Brandon, every shareholder has been suffering. We've thought it through - rather than slaving away under you, we might as well sell our shares and enjoy life." "Now that the shares aren't in our hands, we're naturally no longer Stark Group shareholders," Matthew's smirk widened. "Brandon, you think your threats still work on me?" "Mr. Matthew, don't you want to take a look?" James's professional tone carried just a hint of satisfaction.

Matthew's hands trembled as he read the documents. "You... you actually...
"

"If you had submitted your resignation earlier, this file would have remained sealed forever." I watched his face crumple as the truth sank in.

"How did you know? I don't believe it."

"Money laundering overseas, dealing with arms dealers - these aren't minor infractions." I leaned forward slightly. "Stark Group has always operated cleanly. My grandfather may have stepped down, but his rules still stand."

"When did you find out?" Matthew's voice shook. Then understanding dawned in his eyes. "You planned this all along? Letting Sarah get away?Making us sell our shares? So our shares are now..."

"At least you're not completely stupid, Uncle." My smile held no warmth. "Too bad you realized too late."


"Hah, truly a Stark, truly Robert's son!" Matthew's laugh was bitter and sharp. "Plotting against your own family - Brandon, are you even human?"

"Are you my family?" The words dropped like ice into the silence.

A knock at the door interrupted whatever he'd been about to say. "Mr.Stark, the police are downstairs for a routine questioning. They're asking for Mr.Matthew.""Brandon, you think this is enough to take me down?" Matthew's voice took on a desperate edge. "Let mé tell you, I have evidence about Sarah-" ′′Isthat so?" I met his gaze steadily. "Try it. I never fight battles I'm not certain to win, Security! Please escort Mr. Matthew and his associates out to meet the police."

"Brandon, you'll die a horrible death!" Matthew shouted as he was led away.




"Mr. Stark, Miss Sarah is here to see you! She's already in your office." My secretary's voice carried through the intercom.

"I know."


When I entered my office, Sarah was already there, her fingers twisting nervously in her lap.

"Brandon!" The relief in her voice was palpable.

I paused, my hand resting on the door handle. "This is the company."

"Mr. Stark." She corrected herself reluctantly. "Mr. Stark, I came today to..."

"To ask about today's outcome?" I settled behind my desk.

"You... Matthew didn't resign?"


"After working with him for so long, surely you know what kind of person he is?"


"So you knew everything," She studied my face.

"Yeah." "But what about his other shares in Stark Group? If he and the others sold them to outsiders, wouldn't that put the company at risk?" I slid a folder across the desk. "They're in my hands." 
"What?"

"He dumped his shares last night - moved even faster than I expected."I leaned back slightly. "And now I'm giving you your rightful portion.Angela needs you. She's still young."

Her hands trembled slightly as she realized what I was offering - not just documents, but financial independence. Freedom from Matthew's manipulation.

The relief that flooded her face made her look young again- like the sister who used to sneak me cookies when Grandfather's tutors were being particularly harsh. "Brandon, I..."

"That will be all." I turned my attention to the files on my desk, a clear dismissal.

She paused at the door. "Brandon, if you ever need anything, I'll definitely help."

I just smiled, offering no response.
###Chapter 52: Inheritance

**Summer's POV**

I was gathering my things to leave Fortune Corp. My phone's sudden buzz made me jump-Grandpa George's familiar contact photo lighting up the screen.


"Grandpa?"

"Summer, dear." His warm voice carried that particular mix of authority and affection I'd grown up with. "Are you done with work?"

I glanced at the clock, biting my lower lip. "Almost. Is everything okay?"

"Can't an old man want to see his granddaughter?" The gentle teasing in his tone made something in my chest ache. "I was thinking... I know the mansion isn't convenient right now, with your parents..." He trailed off with a soft sigh that spoke volumes. "Perhaps we could meet somewhere else?"

"Of course!" The words tumbled out before I could stop them."The St.Regis? Their tea room is nice and private."

"Perfect." His voice brightened slightly. "I'll have Jenkins make the arrangements." After hanging up, I found myself staring at Brandon's contact photo. *Should I call him?* The thought made my stomach do a little flip,but I pressed the call button anyway. ′′It2Sme!" "Hmm?" His deep voice carried a hint of surprise. "Everything alright?" "Yeah, I justn." I twisted my fingers in my blouse hem. "I might be home late tonight. Grandpa wants to see me. It seems important." There was a moment of silence, then: "Alright." Another pause. "Be careful.Call if you need anything."

"I will!"

\---

My friend Scarlett, who owned this place, greeted me at the St. Regis entrance. "Your grandfather's already waiting," she said softly, gesturing toward the private rooms. "He arrived early."

The tea room's elegant atmosphere wrapped around me like a familiar blanket as I followed the attendant. Grandpa George sat in his usual commanding pose, though something about the set of his shoulders seemed different tonight. Jenkins stood at attention nearby, his professional mask firmly in place.

"Summer!" Grandpa's face lit up as he waved me over. "Come here, dear."

"Grandpa!" I couldn't help smiling as I settled into the chair across from him."You got here early?"

He busied himself pouring tea with the same precise movements I remembered from childhood afternoons. "Work keeping you busy?"

"Not too bad." I accepted the cup gratefully, inhaling the familiar Earl Grey aroma. "What's on your mind, Grandpa? You seem..."

He set down his cup with deliberate care. "Jenkins." Jenkins moved forward smoothly, producing a leather document folder that made my stomach twist with sudden anxiety. The weight of it felt impossibly heavy as I accepted it with trembling fingers. "Grandpa?" My voice cracked slightly as I opened the folder."Capital Corp shares? Why would you..." "Because you're my granddaughter." His tone carried that particular mix of authority and affection that had always made arguing with him impossible."Victoria isn't the only Taylor heir, despite what your parents might think." He nodded to Jenkins, who produced an elegant fountain pen. "Sign the transfer documents. I've already arranged for the notary."

"I never wanted any of this," I pushed the folder away, my voice trembling."If you give me these shares now, won't they think I'm trying to compete with Victoria for thefamily fortune?" I swallowed hard, twisting my fingers in my lap. "I'm already not in my parents' good graces. If I take these shares now, they'll see me as even more of a thorn in their side."


"Let them think what they want!" Grandpa's voice carried that familiar steel. "These shares are my gift to you. Now sign the papers!"

"That's right," Jenkins stepped forward, unable to stay silent any longer."Mr. Taylor has been planning to give these to you for a long time. If you don't take them, and they end up in your sister's hands..."

"But Grandpa..."

"Summer," Grandpa's expression turned stern. "Do you want to see the Taylor family fall into outsiders' hands?"

"What do you mean?" I stared at him, confused. "Why would you say that? "The Stark family is ambitious," his eyes fixed on mine with intense focus."Why do you think Alexander wants to marry your sister? Victoria has never had a head for business - she's only interested in the entertainment industry. Capital Corp will need to be in your hands eventually." He leaned forward slightly. "The Starks may carry our name, but they're not Taylors. Do you understand?" My heart sank as his meaning became clear. "With these shares in your hands," he continued, his voice softening slightly, "no one can stop you from taking your rightful place at Capital Corp.Remember that."

"Grandpa..."

"Don't 'Grandpa' me with those eyes." But his tone softened slightly. "I'm not doing this out of pity or guilt. You're a Taylor-it's time you had the power to protect yourself."

My fingers trembled as I accepted the pen from Jenkins. Each signature felt like crossing a threshold I couldn't uncross, but Grandpa's steady presence gave me strength. When I finally finished, he tucked the documents safely away with a satisfied nod.

"There. Was that so hard?" His eyes crinkled with familiar warmth. "How are you holding up?" His eyes studied my face with grandfatherly concern."After everything that happened at the birthday party..."

I swallowed hard, forcing a smile. "I'm fine, Grandpa. Really."

"Summer." The way he said my name - gentle but firm - made tears prick at my eyes. "You don't have to pretend with me. I know what they tried to do."

"Can we... not talk about that?" My voice came out smaller than intended.

He reached across the table to pat my hand. "Alright, dear. But remember-you're stronger than they think. Than you think." The rest of our tea passed in comfortable conversation1, Grandpa sharing stories from my childhood that made me both laugh and cry. By the time we finished, the sun had long since set over Manhattan. I insisted on waiting until Grandpa and Jenkins had safely departed before leaving myself. The night air felt crisp against my face as I stepped out onto the sidewalk, my mind still spinning with everything that had happened. *Capital Corp shares. Real voting power in the family company.*The weight of it felt almost physical.
The sudden purr of a familiar engine made me jump. A sleek black Bentley pulled up beside me, the passenger window rolling down to reveal Brandon's perfect features.
"Get in." His deep voice brooked no argument as he reached across to open the door.

I slid into the butter-soft leather seat. Brandon leaned over, his cologne wrapping around me as he carefully fastened my seatbelt. The casual intimacy of the gesture made my heart race.

"How did you know where I was?" I managed to ask once my heart stopped trying to escape my chest.
His dark eyes flickered to mine for just a moment. "James mentioned seeing your car still at Fortune Corp. Thought you might need a ride."

"Oh." I couldn't quite meet his gaze. "Thank you."

His fingers drummed a gentle rhythm against the steering wheel as we merged into traffic. "Good talk with your grandfather?"

"Mm." I twisted my fingers in my lap, suddenly uncertain how to explain what had happened. "He... gave me something.""Twenty percent of the Capital Corp's shares," the weight of the document folder in my bag suddenly felt heavier, "I didn't want this. Any of it."
###Chapter 53: Brandon's Gentle Side

**Summer's POV**

"Twenty percent..." I couldn't keep the disbelief from my voice. "This is more than Victoria's shares. Why would Grandpa do this?"

Brandon's dark eyes flickered to mine for just a moment. "You seem surprised."

"Of course I'm surprised!" The words burst out before I could stop them."Do you know what this means? The power structure at Capital Corp could-"

"It's your grandfather's decision," Brandon cut me off smoothly,his deep voice carrying that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse skip. "Accept it. Don't overthink it."
I twisted my fingers nervously in my lap. "You don't seem shocked at all.Twenty percent of the shares! This makes my stake bigger than Victoria's!"
"George Taylor has his reasons." Brandon's tone remained steady as he navigated through traffic with effortless grace. "The Taylor family only has you and Victoria. And since your uncle Alan is adopted, your grandfather naturally worries about the company falling into outsiders'hands.Giving you these shares is just his way of protecting the family legacy."

"How do you know so much about our family?" I couldn't hide my surprise. "Even about Alan being adopted..." The corner of his mouth lifted in that dangerous half-smile. "It's not hard to figure out."A comfortable silence fell between us as the city lights blurred past the windows, Finally, Brandon's voice broke through my swirling thoughts:"Hungry?" "What about you?" I glanced at him, suddenly concerned."Have you eaten?11

"Not yet." His dark eyes held mine for a moment. "Where would you like to go?"

"We're eating out?"

"Mm." He guided the Bentley smoothly around a corner. "It's getting late -might take too long to cook at home. But we can head back if you prefer."

"No, out is fine!" I found myself studying his profile in the passing streetlights. "Actually, I know this nice place near Columbia..."

"Tell me."

Heat crept up my neck as I explained, "It's just a regular restaurant in a mall."

"If you like it, that's enough." His voice softened slightly. "Give me the address."

As we approached the familiar streets around Columbia, memories washed over me. "It's just behind the university," I found myself saying. "Used to come here all the time during college."

"Sounds like you had an eventful college life." The amusement in his tone made my pulse skip. "Just hanging out with friends sometimes," I smiled at the memories. "It was close to campus and affordable. Haven't been back much since graduation..." I snuck a glance at him. "Oh, my friends, Ruby and Scarlett - you'd like to meet them sometime?" "Of course," His casual acceptance surprised me. "Whenever you're free." "You really want to meet my friends?" I couldn't quite keep the uncertainty from my voice.

"Why wouldn't I?"

Brandon drove with steady precision, getting us to the mall in about thirty minutes. The restaurant I'd suggested had been here since the mall first opened, a constant fixture through all my college years.

Thankfully, I'd called ahead to reserve a table - the place was packed when we arrived. I fidgeted nervously with my sleeve. "Um... we could go somewhere else!"

"No need." His hand found mine as he led us to the waiting area. The casual contact made my pulse skip. I clutched the number slip in my free hand,hyperaware of his fingers intertwined with mine.

When we sat down, he loosened his grip slightly. My palm felt strangely empty, and I couldn't help staring at the spot his hand had been, noting the slight dampness there. *Was I actually nervous enough to have sweaty palms?* Heat crept up my neck as I tried to look anywhere else.

Unfortunately, my gaze landed directly on those dark eyes of his. My heart did a complicated flip as I clutched the number slip tighter. "It's really crowded!" I managed, trying to sound casual.

"Mm." His eyes danced with barely suppressed amusement. "No rush.""Right, no rush!" I smiled weakly as he reached over to unfold my death grip on the number slip, smoothing it out with deliberate care. The way he looked at me afterward made my skin prickle with awareness. "Just two tables ahead of us." I bit my lip, certain he was teasing me on purpose. "Yeah, shouldn't be long!" True to the hostess's word, we only waited a few minutes before our turn came up. "That's us!" I jumped up, unconsciously grabbing his hand to pull him along.

One perfect eyebrow arched at my boldness, but his lips curved into that dangerous half-smile as he let me lead the way. When I finally realized what I'd done, I tried to pull back - but his grip tightened,keeping our fingers firmly intertwined.

The table was cozy - not huge, but perfect for two. I pushed the menu toward him. "See what you'd like? I forgot to ask if you can handle spicy food." The realization hit me that in all our meals at home, we'd never had anything particularly strong-flavored.

He slid the menu right back. "Don't worry about me. Order whatever you want."

My eyes lit up despite myself. "Really?"

"The place is still this busy even at this hour," I commented, looking around at the packed tables. "They must be doing something right."

"I'm sure it's goingto be tasty,June."

Heat flooded my cheeks. "You could just use my real name,you know."

"Don't you like when I call you June? It's different from what anyone else calls you." I had no response to that. *Who uses their birth month as a nickname except for my grandpa anyway?* He poured me more tea, his movements elegant even in this casual setting."About those shares your grandfather gave you - accept them without hesitation. You must know what Alexander and his father are planning." The shift in topic sobered me immediately. I nodded. "I know Grandpa must have his reasons. I just thought... 'maybe things didn't have to be so complicated."

"Capital Corp was built from nothing by your grandfather." Brandon's voice carried that gentle authority I was starting to know well. "He started with nothing,so he values the company above everything."

He paused, studying my reaction. "Victoria has fifteen percent of the shares,but she has no head for business and she's focused on her entertainment career. If she marries Alexander, who do you think those shares will really belong to?"

A bitter smile crossed my face. "I know. That's why Alexander..."I swallowed hard. "That's why he got together with Victoria behind my back.I figured it out a while ago. But my father isn't that foolish, so..."
"No, he's not foolish," Brandon's voice turned sharp. "That's why he tried to use you to secure the Windsor investment instead."

I must have paled because his expression immediately softened."I apologize, I shouldn't have-"
"It's fine," I cut him off, though my attempt at a smile felt brittle. "You're just stating facts. Capital Corp isn't as prestigious as it seems anymore.I just... I never thought my father would go that far. I always thought it was just my mother favoring Victoria because she's more...charming." Brandon's hand found mine across the table, his touch unexpectedly gentle.The warmth of his skín against mine felt like an anchor, keeping me from drowning in bitter memories.
###Chapter 54: Dating Like A Normal Couple


**Summer's POV**

Brandon's fingers threaded through mine across the restaurant table, the unexpected intimacy making my breath catch. I ducked my head,suddenly finding the elegant tablecloth fascinating. My heart was racing so fast I was sure he could hear it, even over the gentle restaurant ambiance.

What do I say? What do I do? My mind went completely blank under the weight of his intense gaze. Just when I thought I might spontaneously combust from embarrassment, the waiter appeared with our first course.

"Your appetizers," the waiter's professional voice broke through the charged moment. I'd never been so grateful for an interruption in my life.
Brandon's hand reluctantly released mine as the dishes were arranged before us. He began transferring food to my plate with precise movements,that casual authority back in his bearing.

"I can do it myself," I protested weakly, but he continued as if he hadn't heard.

"Brandon..." I reached for my plate, our fingers brushing briefly. The contact sent another jolt through my system, reminding me of how natural his touch had felt moments ago. "Really, I can handle it!"

The corner of his mouth lifted in that dangerous half-smile that never failed to make my pulse skip. "Eat." The word carried that gentle command that was becoming frustratingly familiar. I found myself studying him as we ate,noting how he barely touched the heavily seasoned dishes, preferring the simpler preparations.*He likes his food clean and light,* I realized, mentally filing away the observation. Not that I was planning to cook for him or anything. Though his kitchen was really nice... After dinner, we found ourselves walking through an upscale shopping mall. The weekend crowd had thinned out, but couples still dotted the polished corridors. A young pair ahead of us caught my attention-the girl was clearly upset about something.

"You fell asleep!" Her voice carried clearly through the quiet space. "You promised to watch the movie with me!"
Her boyfriend's defensive tone made me hide a smile. "Come on, it's not my fault! You girls always want to watch these romantic dramas full of misunderstandings. Real life isn't like that!"
"But that's the point!" She huffed. "Art is supposed to be elevated from real life! You promised to watch it with me!"
I couldn't help the small laugh that escaped once they were out of earshot."Pfft..."

Brandon glanced at me, one perfect eyebrow raised. "Something funny?"

I shook my head, still smiling. "Girls aren't actually that complicated,you know? She just wanted him to spend time with her. The movie itself doesn't matter - it's about the companionship. As long as he's not completely checked out..."

Something flickered across Brandon's face as he checked his watch. "It's still early. Let's watch a movie."

"What?" I stared at him, sure I'd misheard. "You... want to watch a movie? Before I could form a coherent response, he was already on his phone."James, Get us two tickets." He scanned the movie posters with casual disinterest. "Hmm, 'Like You' will do.""Like You'?" I couldn't keep the disbelief from my voice. *The romantic drama that's been all over social media?* "Are you serious?"
"Why are you looking at me like that?" The amusement in his tone made my cheeks flush.
"You really want to watch this kind of movie?" I twisted my fingers nervously. "You don't have to humor me..."
His hand found mine, fingers intertwining with casual possessiveness. "Didn't you just say girls need companionship?" That dangerous half-smile played at his lips. "If that applies to dating couples, shouldn't it apply even more to married ones?"

The warmth of his hand against mine made it hard to think straight. We made our way to the ticket counter, where a small crowd had gathered around the self-service machines.
"Could you hurry up?" Someone called from behind us, impatience clear in their voice.

"Sorry!" I apologized quickly, then noticed Brandon's hesitation with the touch screen. *No way...* I leaned closer, trying to hide my grin. "Don't tell me you don't know how to use the self-service kiosk?"

The look he gave me could have frozen hell itself. "Here," I bit back a laugh as I took his phone, quickly navigating the interface. His glare promised retribution, but I couldn't help finding it oddly endearing that the mighty Brandon Stark had been stymied by a movie ticket machine. He pulled me away from the crowd, his grip on my hand firm but gentle."June," "Hmm?" I looked up, caught off guard by the intensity in his expression."I know we're married," his voice dropped lower, sending shivers down my spine, "but l also know you're still adjusting to us. To this."

Guilt twisted in my stomach. "I'm sorry, it's my fault-"

"No." He cut me off smoothly. "It's not your fault at all." He bent slightly,bringing himself to my eye level. The move should have felt condescending.but something in his expression made my breath catch instead. "We can start from the beginning."

"What do you mean?"

His fingers threaded through mine, the gesture somehow both possessive and tender. "Dating. We'll do what other couples do. Take it step by step."
"Are you sure?" I searched his face for any sign of mockery,but found only that steady intensity that seemed to be his default state.

His free hand came up to brush my cheek, the touch feather-light."Absolutely sure. No pressure, June. We'll take it at your pace." His thumb traced my lower lip, making my pulse race. "Though you should stop looking at me like that, or I might have to kiss you."

"Stop teasing!" I ducked my head, but couldn't quite hide my smile.

"As you wish." He squeezed my hand gently. "Let's get some snacks before the movie starts." Despite my protests, Brandon returned with a large popcorn and two drinks. "Shh," he pressed a finger to his lips as thè lights began to dim."Movie's starting."Finding our seats in the darkness proved interesting. Brandon helped me with my bag, passing me a drink with careful precision. "Thirsty?" I shook my head but took a sip anyway, hyperaware of his presence beside me. The theater was full of young couples, reminding me of my own college days.
Hlis fingers tightened around mine as the movie began. The romantic plot unfolded on screen - a classic tale of misunderstandings and eventual reconciliation between a powerful CEO and his employee.
"Brandon," I whispered, trying to pull my hand free. "What are you doing?11

"Watching a mnovie." His voice carried that velvet-soft quality that never failed to make my skin prickle. His thumb continued its maddening path across my palm.
"Let go..." But even to my own ears, the protest sounded weak.

He leaned closer, his breath warm against my ear. "Stay still."

My heart clenched as the movie reached a particularly intimate scene between the leads. Just then, Brandon's grip on my hand tightened slightly.He guided my hand to rest on his thigh, his fingers still intertwined with mine. Tapping my fingertips gently, he leaned close and murmured, "June.do you all really like these kinds of movies? The domineering CEO type?"
"I am not!" I yelled, but my face felt like it was on fire.*Though the CEO in the movie wasn't half asintimidating as the real thing sitting next to me.*
###Chapter 55: He's Jealous

**Summer's POV**

After I yelled, several heads turned in our direction, curiosity evident in their expressions even in thedim light. I wanted to sink into my plush seat and disappear, but Brandon seemed completely unfazed by the attention.

My embarrassment was getting unbearable. "Let go," I whispered, trying to pull my hand free. "My palm is all sweaty."
"Is it?" His deep voice carried that dangerous edge of amusement. He shifted his grip slightly buIt showed no intention of releasing me.
"How am I supposed to eat popcorn like this?" I tried again,gesturing at the large bucket balanced precariously on the armrest between us.
Without missing a beat, Brandon reached over with his free hand, picked up a piece of popcorn, and held it to my lips. The casual intimacy of the gesture made my heart skip several beats. *Is this really happening?Brandon Stark, the most feared CEO on Wall Street, is actually...*

"Eat." he murmured, his deep voice carrying that velvet-soft quality that never failed to make my skin prickle. Even in the darkness of the theater,his voice seemed to wrap around me like silk - richer and more compelling than even the movie's leading man. How does he make even a simple word sound so... intense? I stared at him in disbelief, grateful for the darkness hiding my flaming cheeks. He met my gaze steadily, that infuriating half-smile playing at his lips as he waited. After what felt like an eternity but was probably only seconds, I gave in, accepting the offered popcorn."Want more?* The amusement in his tone was unmistakable. "I can feed myself!" I protested weakly.

He passed me a drink instead. "Don't havetoo much."

I found myself automatically following his instruction before realizing what I was doing. *When did this dynamic become so... natural?*
Behind us, a female voice carried clearly through the quiet theater: "Look at how sweet they are! He even feeds her popcorn. Meanwhile, you're just glued to your phone!"
"If other boyfriends are so great, why don't you go date them instead?"Her companion shot back, clearly annoyed.
"Are they talking about us?" I whispered to Brandon, mortification making my voice crack slightly.
His dark eyes gleamed with something dangerous. "Not convincing enough as a couple? Should I feed you again to prove it?"
"That's not the point!" I hissed. "We're being used as some kind of relationship benchmark!"
Brandon's only response was to offer me another piece of popcorn,his movements impossibly elegant even in this mundane task. *How does he make everything look so effortless?* I couldn't help studying his perfect profile in the flickering light from the screen. The sharp angles of his face seemed softened somehow, though no less striking.

"So romantic!" The girl behind us sighed loudly. "Why can't we be like that?"

 "It's bad enough watching couples be lovey-dovey in the movie,"her boyfriend grumbled. "Now we have to deal with it in real lifetoo?""Why are you being so difficult today?" Shedemanded. "And you're being dramatic!" He shot back. "He can't be her real boyfriend,they're obviously putting on a show."

I turned to Brandon, unable to hide my amusement. "He thinks we're acting."
"He's jealous." Brandon's voice carried that velvet-soft quality that never failed to make my skin prickle.
Looking back at the screen, I had to admit the boy wasn't entirely wrong.We weren't a normal couple - we'd literally gotten married before dating.The thought should have been unsettling, but somehow, sitting here in the dark with Brandon's hand warm around mine, it just felt..right.
The rest of the movie passed in a blur of stolen glances and shared popcorn. By the time the lights came up, my cheeks hurt from smiling.
"This is all your fault," I complained as we left the theater. "You kept feeding me popcorn!"

"I thought you enjoyed it." His dark eyes danced with barely suppressed mischief.

"Brandon Stark!" I tried to sound stern despite the warmth blooming in my chest. "You're impossible!"
His fingers threaded through mine as we made our way into the mall."Speaking of impossible... your car is still at Fortune Corp."
 
"Oh no,I forgot-" "James took care of it." Of course he had. Brandon never left loose ends."Want to look around?" Hle gestured at the high-end shops lining the mall's corridors."We have time." I hesitated, suddenly nervous. "What if someone sees us?" "Worried about being seen with Stark Group's CEO?" His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile. "Am I that recognizable?"
"You know what I mean!" But I couldn't help laughing at his mock offense. "Weren't we keeping this private for now?"

He pulled me closer, his cologne wrapping around me like a familiar blanket. "This nervous about dating your husband?"
"Wait..." A thought suddenly struck me. "Isn't this mall owned by Stark Group? I remember hearing about the acquisition two years agoat Fortune Corp."
"Wondering if that's why I know the layout so well?" His dark eyes held mine with dangerous intensity.
"It's getting late," I said quickly, trying to ignore how my pulse raced under his gaze.

"Relax." His thumb traced gentle circles on my palm. "If we're starting with dating, we should do it properly." He guided me toward the upscale boutiques, his stride shortening to match my pace. "Let me take my wife shopping."

I found myself following half a step behind, hyperaware of our joined hands and the height difference that forced me to look up at him. My Louboutins clicked against the polished floor as I tried to maintain my usual grace.

"Tired?" His voice softened as he noticed my slightly uneven steps. "I'm fine!" But he'd already slowed his pace further, his hand steady and warm around mine. "June," The way he said my name made my breath catch. "You don't have to try so hard. We have all the time in the world."
###Chapter 56: Who Are You Again?

**Summer's POV**
Brandon and I made our way through the mall. My heels clicked against the floor with each step, a sound that usually made me feel confident but now just reminded me of how much my feet were killing me.
I must have winced slightly because Brandon's hand tightenedaround mine. "You're limping."
"Just these heels," I tried to smile despite the discomfort. "They're not exactly made for mall walking."
His dark eyes studied my face. "Why didn't you say something earlier?"

"It's nothing! Really." I attempted to quicken my pace to prove my point,but my ankle chose that moment to wobble traitorously. Brandon's arm shot out to steady me, his movements fluid and precise.

"Stop pretending." He said softly. "Come here."

Before I could protest, he was guiding me toward Stuart Weitzman's gleaming storefront. The luixury shoe boutique sparkled with tasteful lighting and elegant displays, making me suddenly very aware of my increasingly uncomfortable footwear.

"Brandon!" I tried to dig in my heels, which only made them hurt more."This isn't necessary. I can just change when we get home." "June." The way he said my nickname sent an involuntary shiver down my spine. "You need comfortable shoes. And when we're dating,you shouldn't have to suffer." I couldn't help the little snort that escaped. "Even buying shoes has to be 1up to Brandon Stark's standards?" His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile that never failed to make my heart race. "You still don't know me very well,do you?"
Before I could formulate a response, a sales associate materialized beside us with professional efficiency. Brandon's hand found the small of my back,guiding me forward with gentle insistence.

"Go look around." His fingers brushed my hair back from my face,the gesture so casual it made my breath catch. "Find something comfortable."

I ducked away from his touch, my cheeks burning. "Don't treat me like a child!"

"Hmm." That knowing glint in his eyes made my stomach do complicated flips.

"You'll... wait here?" I couldn't quite keep the uncertainty from my voice.

He settled into one of the plush VIP seats with that predatory grace that seemed to come naturally to him. "Of course."
The sales associate guided me through their newest collections,her professional enthusiasm never wavering. "These just arrived from our fall collection," she gestured to a display of elegant pumps. "Perfect for the office,and the lower heel height means you can wear them all day."

My attention caught on a pair of deep wine-colored heels. The design was sophisticated but not flashy, with clean lines that spoke of quality craftsmanship. *These would work for both client meetings and dinner events...* "Those would look lovely on you," the associate commented,already moving to retrieve my size. "The color really suits your complexion." "Oh my god, isn't this the pair Vogue featured last month?" A familiar voice cut through my contemplation like a knife. "They're absolutely gorgeous!"
My blood ran cold as I turned to find Victoria standing there,her perfect smile firmly in place. Anna Wilson hovered at her shoulder like a well-trained shadow, and I caught sight of Sophie lingering behind them,her expression carefully neutral.
"Summer!" Victoria's voice dripped with false warmth as she grabbed my hands. "What a coincidence! Shopping therapy?"

I pulled my hands back as casually as I could manage."With friends?"

"Yes! You remember Anna, right?" Victoria gestured to her companion,who gave me a look that could have curdled milk.
"Of course." I kept my voice professionally neutral, already planning my escape route. "Well, you all enjoyyour shopping. I have work to handle."
"Summer, wait!" Victoria said, "Are you still angry? I know Alexander and I hurt you, but that's in the past. We'll always be sisters!"

I bit back a bitter laugh. "Sisters? Is that what we are?"

"Everyone's so worried about you," she continued, her eyes wide with practiced concern. "Especially Grandpa George - his health hasn't been great lately. Even if you hate me, you should visit them."

"If you're uncomfortable seeing me," she added with masterful manipulation, "I can always make myself scarce..." "Enough." The word came out sharper than I intended. "Drop the act,Victoria. Whether I visit home or not is my business." I couldn't help the cold smile that curved my lips. "What's wrong? Feeling guilty?"

 Victoria's perfect mask cracked slightly. "How can you say that? Alexander and I are in love - your obsession won't change anything!" "She's right," Anna jumped in, her voice dripping with venom. "You need to face reality, Summer. Alexander and Victoria are perfect together.Why keep causing trouble?"


"Such loyal friends." I couldn't quite keep the bitterness from my voice.

"Of course we're loyal!" Anna's eyes narrowed dangerously. "That's why we have to tell you the truth. You're Victoria's sister, so we've tried to be nice, but you're being so ungrateful! If Victoria hadn't saved your life back then...".


"Don't." I cut her off, ice crystallizing in my veins. "Don't you dare bring up ancient history."

I turned to Victoria,letting her see the steel in my eyes. "Let me be clear.
You live your life, I'll live mine. We don't need to pretend anymore."

"As for Alexander," I continued, proud of how steady my voice remained,"since you want him so badly, treasure him. I never look back once I've decided to let go."

"Summer!" Victoria's voice cracked with genuine emotion.

"Don't bother arguing with her!" Anna cut in. "Look at her attitude! You treat her like a real sister, but she clearly doesn't see you the same way!"

"Your friend's right." I smiled, though it felt more like baring teeth. "From the moment you betrayed me, I stopped considering you my sister.Let's just be strangers from now on." "See?" Anna's voice rose triumphantly.′′Itold you you're too soft,Victoria!Give people an inch and they'll take a mile!" "Anna, don't..." Victoria's voice wavered perfectly. "She's still my only sister..." "Mr. Stark?" Victoria's voice suddenly shifted to something breathless with surprise.

My heart nearly stopped as I turned to find Brandon approaching. My own panic must have shown on my face because Brandon's hand found mine, his touch grounding me even as my mind raced. *We can't let Victoria know about us. Not yet.*

His thumb traced a gentle circle on my palm, and I forced myself to breathe. Brandon's presence beside me felt like a shield, his quiet strength holding me steady.

"Do I know you?" His deepvoice carried just a hint of arctic chill.

Victoria's perfect smile faltered slightly. "Mr. Stark, don't you remember? I'm Victoria Taylor, Alexander's fiancée. At Grandpa George's birthday party,you gave that beautiful chess set..."

"Ah." Brandon's expression could have frozen hell itself. "Vaguely recall something like that." His dark eyes swept over her dismissively. "Who are you again?"

I caught Sophie hiding a smile behind her hand, her sharp eyes missing nothing as Victoria's perfect mask cracked just a little more.
###Chapter 57: Put on A Play

**Summer's POV**

Victoria glided forward with practiced grace, her perfect smile firmly in place. "You must be very busy, Mr. Stark. That day at the party,there were so many people - you probably don't remember me. Let me introduce myself: I'm Victoria Taylor, daughter of the Taylor family and Alexander Stark's fiancée." She emphasized each title like she was reading from a particularly impressive resume.

Brandon's dark eyes swept over her with deliberate slowness and let go of my hand, his expression unreadable as he studied her. His lips curved into a slight smile that held no warmth. "The Taylor family... I remember." He paused, his eyes narrowing slightly. "But Alexander Stark? Who might that be?"

I watched Victoria's perfect smile freeze for just a fraction of a second. The temperature in the store seemed to drop several degrees. The awkwardness was palpable. *God, he's really going to pretend he doesn't know who Alexander is,* I thought, watching my sister's composure crack just slightly around the edges.

"Miss Taylor is looking at shoes?"

Victoria recovered quickly, but I could see the tension in her shoulders as she forced a light laugh. "Oh, I'm just here shopping with friends! Are you here to shop as well,Mr.Stark?" If Brandon noticed the strain in her voice, he gave no sign. Instead, his gaze found mine with unerring accuracy. It took me a moment to realize he was addressing me. "Are you asking me, Mr. Stark?" "Who else?" The amusement in his tone made my pulse skip despite myself.13 I caught Victoria's expression darkening from the corner of my eye."Yes,just looking for some flats."

The saleswoman who'd been hovering nearby practically materialized at my elbow. "What size would you like, miss?"

"Seven, please." I kept my voice steady despite how my heart raced under Brandon's intense scrutiny.

"Mr. Stark, are you shopping too?" I asked, desperate to break the charged silence that had fallen.

His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile. "Summer Taylor remembers me?"

"How could I forget?" The words came out softer than intended. "You made my grandfather so happy that day,playing chess with him."

"George Taylor is a respected elder." His dark eyes held mine with an intensity that made my skin prickle. "His opinion matters greatly.That pen was a good gift too. You have a good taste, Miss Taylor."

Before I could respond, Anna stepped forward with the kind of confidence that came from years of elite finishing schools. "Mr. Stark, I'm Anna Watson,Joe Watson's Sister." Brandon barely spared her a glance, just a slight nod before his attention returned to me. Anna's perfect smile froze, uncertainty flickering across her features as Brandon continued to ignore her. She and Sophie exchanged glances - they'd been captivated by Brandon's striking appearance at first, drawn in by his obvious wealth and power. But now they were learning the hard way that Brandon Stark played by his own rules. I found myself raising an eyebrow, unsure whether to smile or not.Brandon was complimenting me, sure, but wasn't he really just showing

 off his own power? The way he'd orchestrated this whole scene... I hadn't expected him to actually stick around and play this game with Victoria.

I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel good though. I admitted to myself. Being treated like this by Brandon Stark, having him so obviously choose me over everyone else-what woman wouldn't enjoy that kind of attention?

Victoría's face was a study in barely contained rage. I could practically read her thoughts: Why Summer? What makes her so special that Brandon Stark would remember her? Her perfect composure cracked further as she watched our interaction. We both met him for the first time at Grandpa's party, but he barely noticed me then. So why is he paying attention to Summer now?

"Miss, your flats are ready!" The saleswoman's voice cut through the tension. "Size seven - would you like to try them on?"

"Mr. Stark, I should..." I gestured vaguely toward the fitting area.

He nodded slightly. "Ġo ahead."

Victoria seized her chance the moment I moved away. "Mr. Stark, what do you think of these heels? They're quite-"

"Box these up." Brandon cut her off smoothly, gesturing to a pair of elegant heels. "Size seven."

My heart did a complicated flip.*Is he...*

"Miss Taylor, would you do me a favor?" His deep voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse race. "Of course, as long as Mr. Stark doesn't mind!" The words tumbled out before I could stop them. Victoria's voice turned sharp. "Hey! Box up those heels for me-Iwear a seven too, no need to try them on!"

The saleswoman shifted uncomfortably. "I'm sorry, miss, but we only have one pair in that size."
"Mr. Stark hasn't purchased them, right? Now I'm going to buy them!"Victoria's perfect composure cracked slightly. "Here's my card! What are you waiting for?"
"I apologize, miss, but Mr. Stark doesn't need to pay with a card. The shoes are his."

Victoria's face twisted with fury. "Do you know who I am? Do you want to stay in business in Manhattan? I could have this storeshut down with one phone call!"

The silence that fell was deafening. Victoria stood there, chest heaving,her usual poise completely shattered. Anna and Sophie exchanged worried glances,clearly unsure how to handle this new development.

Brandon's expression hadn't changed, but something in his bearing made the temperature in the room drop several degrees. The saleswoman straightened her spine, years of professional training evident in her polite but firm tone: "I apologize, miss, but the shoes belong to Mr. Stark."
###Chapter 58: Teaching Victoria a Lesson


**Summer's POV**

The sales associate's professional voice cut through the tension like a knife."I apologize, Miss Taylor, but there seems to be a misunderstanding.These shoes were already selected by Mr. Stark. And since you haven't made a payment yet, it's only fair that we prioritize Mr. Stark's request. Here at Stuart Weitzman, we treat all our customers equally, even if they are from the Taylor family."

The associate's gaze remained steady, never wavering as she met Victoria's increasingly hostile glare. I caught the subtle curl of her lips, the slightest hint of satisfaction in putting an enatitled customer in her place. My sister's face flushed with barely contained rage.

"Mr. Stark," I ventured cautiously, "should I try them on?"

Brandon's dark eyes found mine with unerring accuracy. "If you would,Miss Taylor."

"Let's just forget aboutit," I said softly, trying to defuse the situation before it could escalate further. The last thing I needed was Victoria making an even bigger scene. "There's no need to-"

"Please try them on," Brandon cut me off smoothly, his voice carrying that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse skip. Victoria's voice shook with fury. "You..." She seemed to choke on her own anger for a moment before recovering her usual haughty tone. "Get your manager. No, get your regional director. I want to see who dares treat me like this in Manhattan!" The sales associate's smile never wavered, though a knowing glint appeared in her eyes as she glanced at Brandon, "Of course, I'll fetch our manager right away. Please wait a moment." Brandon turned to me, his expression softening imperceptibly. "Is something wrong?"
Watching Victoria seethe, I couldn't help but feel a twinge of anxiety. My sister had never been good at handling public humiliation. "Mr. Stark,really,it's not necessary to-"
"Try them on, June." His voice dropped lower, sending an involuntary shiver down my spine.

The moment I settled onto the plush leather seat, Brandon's presence seemed to fill the entire store. His movements were precise and elegant as he watched me slip off my uncomfortable heels. The new shoes fit perfectly - *of course they did* - but as I stood to test them, my ankle wobbled traitorously.
Brandon's hand shot out to steady me, one arm wrapping around my waist while the other caught my elbow. The contact sent electricity dancing across my skin, and I found myself clutching his shoulder for balance.

"Shameless!" Anna's voice dripped with venom. "Throwing yourself at any man who shows interest. I guess old habits die hard!"
Heat flooded my cheeks as I quickly pushed away from Brandon's support."Thank you," I managed, my voice barely above a whisper. But even as I tried to create distance between us, I could feel the lingering warmth of his touch. His dark eyes studied my face with dangerous intensity, a muscle ticking in his jaw at Anna's comment. "Are you alright?"Before I could respond, hurried footsteps announced the manager's arrival.The moment he caught sight of Brandon, his eyes widened with recognition, and beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. "Mr. Brandon Stark!" The manager's voice carried equal parts surprise and deference. "I didn't realize you were visiting personally!"

I caught Anna and Sophie's frantic whispers:

"Why didn't you tell me he was *the* Brandon Stark?"


"I told you he was a Stark!"
"You idiot! You made us call for the manager! Do you even know who Brandon Stark is?"

"He's just from the Stark family, right?"

"You have no idea what you've done!"

"You must be joking!" Sophie's voice rose slightly in panic. "Taylor family or not, Alexander is your fiancé - how can you not know about the Stark family hierarchy?"

The manager's professional smile never wavered as he turned to Victoria."What seems to be the problem,miss?"
Victoria drew herself up, her chin lifting defiantly despite how her hands trembled slightly. "I want to buy those shoes, and your staff is refusing to sell them to me! Do you know who I am? I have more than enough money, yet you won't let me make a purchase - what kind of service is this? And your sales associate's attitude is completely unprofessional!" "Actually," the associate cut in smoothly, a slight smile playing at her lips, "I was just explaining the situation. Mr. Stark doesn't need to pay-anything he selects is automatically his. Though it's understandable this young lady wouldn't know, since Mr. Stark owns this entire shopping complex. If he wanted every item in the mall, they would all be complimentary." The manager nodded sagely. "The situation seems clear -just a simple misunderstanding. It's perfectly natural that this young lady wouldn't recognize our owner. Very few people have the privilege of knowing Mr.Stark personally. Since these particular shoes are spoken for, perhaps we could show you1 some other styles?"
I watched understanding dawn in Victoria's eyes. The realization that nearly every high-end retail space in Manhattan operated under Stark Group's umbrella seemed to hit her like a physical blow.
Sophie-tugged urgently at Victoria's sleeve, her expression tight with concern. "Remember who you are - you're a movie star. Think about the paparazzi! We need to leave before this gets worse."
Throughout the entire exchange, Brandon maintained his elegant bearing,his attention focused solely on me as if the others didn't exist. The weight of his gaze made my skin prickle with awareness, and I couldn't help wondering if he'd orchestrated this entire scene.
Brandon's only response was to reach for my hand, his touch sending warmth spreading through my chest despite my concerns. The gesture felt oddly protective, even as it marked me as definitively his in front of everyone present.

Victoria's face had gone through an impressive array of emotions - from shock to understanding to a kind of horrified realization. Her perfect facade had crumbled completely, revealing the ugly truth beneath:the mighty Taylor family, for all its prestige, was nothing compared to the power Brandon Stark could wield with a single word.As Sophie practically dragged Victoria toward the exit, I caught my sister's expression in the store's mirrors - a complex mix of humiliation,rage,and something that looked unsettlingly like calculation."She's going to hate me even more now," I couldn't help murmuring. "She'll hate you anyway." One of Brandon's finger traced along my jawline,the touch so light I might have imagined it if not for the electricity it sent dancing across my skin.

"You don't understand. Victoria isn't someone who just lets things go...She'll find a way to make me pay for this humiliation."
###Chapter 59: Are You Afraid She'll Take Me Away?
**Summer's POV**

"Is that what you're worried about?" His dark eyes studied my face with dangerous focus, catching every micro-expression I tried to hide. "Sounds like you've had plenty of experience being her target. And you're so used to playing defense, aren't you, June?"
The observation was casual, but something in his tone made me look up.

"Isn't that obvious? I moved out of the Taylor mansion the moment I could afford my own place. I only go back for things like Grandpa George s birthday, when absence would cause more drama than presence."
His dark eyes studied my face, taking in every subtle tell I couldn't quite hide. My fingers twisted nervously in the hem of my blouse as that penetrating gaze seemed to strip away every defense I'd built over the years.

"She's quite skilled at manipulation," he concluded, his voice carrying an edge that made me shiver. His thumb brushed across my knuckles,stilling my fidgeting hands. "But she's never faced someone like me before."

"Brandon..." I said, "You don't have to get involved in Taylor family drama. Victoria has this way of making everything so much worse than it needs to be."The sales saleswoman approached with perfectly wrapped boxes,her professional demeanor never wavering. The store manager followed close behind,practically radiating deference. "Mr. Stark, the shoes..." The manager's voice carried just the right note of respect.
Brandon's brow furrowed slightly as he accepted the box containing the heels. "And the flats?"

"Right here, Miss Taylor." The saleswoman produced another box with impressive efficiency. "Your size, as requested."
I glanced at Brandon, suddenly uncertain. He nodded once, his expression softening imperceptibly. "Try them on. And wear less heels from now on."A smile played at his lips as he added, "Except at home."
Heat flooded my cheeks as I caught his meaning, understanding dawning as I watched the manager's careful orchestration of the entire scene. The height difference between us was even more pronounced now- my 5'6" to his 6'2"- but something about it felt oddly right.
"Thank you," I said to the saleswoman as she packed up my old shoes.Then, to Brandon: "Shall we go?"



"Thank you for helping me today." I turned to face him once we reached the mall's main corridor. Without those heels digging into my feet, walking felt like floating.

The corner of his mouth lifted in that dangerous half-smile."Is that all?"

"What else do you want?" I couldn't quite hide my own answering smile. "No wonder you're no match for her." He closed the distance between us in two long strides, taking the shopping bag from my hand and naturally intertwining our fingers.My body went rigid, face flaming as I registered the casual intimacy of the gesture. "There are people everywhere!" I tried to pull away, though not very convincingly. My eyes darted around nervously,hyper-aware of potential observers.
"Am I embarrassing you?" The amusement in his voice made my pulse race.
"No!" I forced an awkward laugh. "I just... what if Victoria's still around?If she sees us together..."

"What is there to be afraidof?" He cut me off smoothly, something like disdain coloring his tone. "I didn't expect you to be so wary of your sister.She's all bluster."
The words hit harder than they should have. I bit my lip, memories of twenty-plus years of sisterhood washing over me like acid. "You don't understand. It started with small things - toys, clothes. Then it was friends.Then our parents' affection. Victoria... she doesn't just take things. She makes sure you know they were taken."
"Are you afraid she'll try to take me away too?" Brandon's deep voice carried a hint of amusement, though something darker lurked beneath.
I froze, caught completely off guard by his question. "What? No,why would you think that?" The denial came automatically, but when I caught sight of his slightly darkening expression, I realized I might have given the wrong answer. I let out an awkward laugh, trying to backtrack. "I mean... that's not what I meant. I know Victoria couldn't take you away - I know what kind of person you are." My voice softened as I continued, "But you don't really understand my family. They always find new ways to surprise me with how low they can go. If Victoria finds out about us, about our marriage...well, if she can't have the best, she'll try to destroy everything around it." "You think she can destroy me?" Brandon's low laugh held a dangerous edge, though his mood seemed to lighten at my fumbling explanation."Don't worry. Your husband isn't so easily broken."
"Oh. I know she doesn't have that kind of power," I said quickly,remembering exactly who I was talking to. "But she'll keep pushing and pushing, until it becomes so annoying you'll get sick of dealing with it all.And if my father finds out about our relationship..." I trailed off,remembering how quickly Richard Taylor had been willing to sacrifice his own daughter for business interests.
"I'm serious," I said softly, letting all my fears spill out. "My father was willing to sacrifice me for a two hundred million dollar investment. The Taylor family... I don't want them causing trouble for you."

A low chuckle escaped him. "Silly girl."

"This isn't funny!" I protested, but his gentle squeeze of my fingers made the words lose their edge.

"I'm not mocking you," Brandon said softly. "Since I chose to marry you, I've considered all of this. We're husband and wife now -shouldn't we face everything together, share both the good and bad?" His voice deepened with conviction. "If I were so easily manipulated, I wouldn't be Brandon Stark. Trust me to handle these matters." Seeing my still-uncertain expression, he reached out to stroke my hair again. I ducked away with a pout. "Do you have some kind of compulsive need to pat my head? You're messing up my hair." I leaned against the window, watching the buildings blur past. "Sometimes I just wish life could be simpler, you know?" Brandon's eyebrow arched slightly, a smile tugging at his lips. The sudden buzz of his phone interrupted whatever he'd been about to say."Get that for me?" I picked up his phone, checking the screen. "It's James."


"Put it on speaker."
"Okay." I turned on the speakerphone, and James's crisp voice filled the car. "Sir, we have an update."
I glanced uncertainly at Brandon. "Should I turn off the speaker?" But Brandon just shook his head. "Go ahead, James."

"The investigation is moving forward, but there's something else." James hesitated for a moment. "I just received a video. It's about your wife."
I looked at Brandon in confusion, mouthing "Me?" His expression darkened slightly.

"Continue," Brandon commanded.

James cleared his throat, his usual efficiency tinged with uncertainty.His hesitation made my stomach twist with anxiety. I gripped the phone tighter, and Brandon must have noticed my tension because his eyes narrowed slightly,giving me a reassuring look.

I forced a small smile, trying to show I was fine. "James, it's Summer. You said there's a video about me? Just tell us."

"Yes, ma'am. It's... it's footage from your grandfather's birthday party.What happened upstairs that night." The phone slipped from my suddenly numb fingers, hitting the console with a sharp crack. My hands trembled as I scrambled to pick it up. "What video? I was unconscious upstairs - who could have taken a video?"
###Chapter 60: Racing

**Summer's POV**
Brandon's hand found mine in the darkness, his touch surprisingly gentle despite the tension radiating from him. "Send it," he ordered, his voice carrying enough ice to freeze hell itself. "Now."

The video arrived seconds later, its timestamp showing less than a minute of footage. My heart hammered against my ribs as Brandon pulled over to the shoulder of the road, the Bentley's engine purring softly in the night air.

"You don't have to watch this," Brandon said quietly, but I shook my head.


"I need to know." My voice came out steadier than I felt.

The video was brief but crystal clear, a close-up shot from what must have been a phone camera. I watched myself writhing on the bed, my movements clearly influenced by whatever they'd put in that tea. My face was flushed, my expressions unguarded. The intimate angle of the footage made my stomach turn.

"It was Charles Windsor," I whispered, my voice shaking. "It had to be.There was no one else in that room except..." I couldn't finish the sentence.My own family had drugged me and left me there with him.

"But why?" I coudn't keep my voice from shaking. "He was filming me.Why would James have it?" Brandon's thumb traced gentle circles on my palm, the gesture at odds with the dangerous glint in his eyes. "Because I have James monitoring all communication between the Windsors andI your family." His dark eyes found mine in the dim light. "What?" The word came out as barely a whisper. "Maybe this was a threat."

"Threatening my parents?" The words tasted like ashes in my mouth."What do we do now?"
Brandon's free hand came up to brush my cheek, the touch feather-light."June. Look at me."

I turned, caught off guard by the intensity in his expression.

"They can't touch you anymore." His voice dropped lower, sending shivers down my spine. "You're mine now. My wife. Let them try their pathetic schemes -I'll show them what real power looks like."
Something warm unfurled in my chest at his words. The possessive note in his voice should have frightened me, but instead it felt like armor-protection against everything my family had tried to do.
Suddenly, Brandon shifted gears, guiding the Bentley back onto the empty highway. "Want to try?"

"Try what?"

That dangerous half-smile played at his lips. "Want to try racing?"


"Racing?" I stared at himn in disbelief. "Now? With what car?"

His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile as he started unbuckling his seatbelt. "Who said I was the one racing?" "Wait..." I pointed at myself in shock. "You want me to race? No, no, I can't! I only have a basic license- I can barely drive normally, let alone race!And this isn't even a proper racing car!""I'm not scared!" The denial came automatically. "Just... this is a very expensive car" "June, don't be afraid." He reached over and squeezed my hand reassuringly. "Some things you need to try before you know your limits.I wasn't always good at racing either."
His gentle voice washed over me like a spell, drawing me in despite my fears. I blinked at him uncertainly. "But I don't know..."

"When I'm feeling down, I like to race," he continued softly. "Pushing your limits, feeling that speed - it makes you forget everything else. Want to try?".

"Okay," I heard myself say.

The driver's seat felt different- more intimidating somehow, with all those controls and that perfectly polished dashboard. Brandon settled into the passenger seat like a king on his throne, watching with barely concealed amusement as I adjusted everything to my height.

"Nervous?" His voice carried just a hint of teasing.

"Shut up." I gripped the steering wheel, trying to remember everything I knew about driving luxury cars. Which was basically nothing. "If I wreck this..."

"You won't." His confidence made something warm flutter in my stomach."Trust yourself.June." The engine purred to life under my touch, responding to the slightest pressure on the pedal. We cruised through the empty streets, the city lights blurring past like stars. Despite my initial nerves, the Bentley handled like a dream -smooth and powerful and impossibly responsive. I couldn't help but press down harder on the accelerator, feeling the thrill as the speed increased. The empty road stretched before us like an invitation. Brandon sat quietly beside me, his presence giving me a strength I didn't know I possessed.  "Brandon, I feel like I'm flying!" I exclaimed, gripping the steering wheel tighter. "The car and me together, we're flying!"
"Mm." His approval was subtle but clear. He reached over and lowered both windows,letting the rushing wind fill the car. The cold air stung my cheeks, but I couldn't stop grinning.
Suddenly, a modified sports car shot past us, followed by several others.My competitive spirit flared unexpectedly. I glanced at Brandon.
He raised an eyebrow, looking pleased at this turn of events.

"There's a gathering up ahead," Brandon said suddenly, gesturing to a cluster of headlights in the distance. "Interested?"
As we got closer, I could make out several modified sports cars arranged in a loose semicircle. The smell of burning rubber and high-octane fuel filled the air, mixing with the thunderous sound of revving engines.
"Is this... are they actually racing?" My heart rate picked up despite myself.

A figure approached our car, whistling appreciatively at the Bentley's sleek lines. "Well, well! What do we have here? Bentley's not exactly street racing material, but..." He grinned, leaning against my window. "Want to try your luck,beautiful?"

I should have been intimidated. Should have politely declined and driven away. But something about having Brandon beside me, about the way he looked at me lie I could do anything... I turned to Brandon, expecting him to shut this down immediately.Instead, those dark eyes studied my face with dangerous intensity.′′YOur choice,June." I unbuckled my seatbelt. "Brandon, I think for the sake of your reputation., "Hmm?" He raised an eyebrow.clearly amused.

"I mean, your car might look understated, but that license plate is impossible to miss," I gestured at the pristine Bentley. "If I lose today and these people look up your car... Wall Street's most powerful CEO participating in illegal racing? Your reputation would be ruined!"
###Chapter 61:Kiss

**Summer's POV**
"Is that really your only concern?" His voice carried that velvet-soft quality that never failed to make my pulse race.
Heat flooded my cheeks as I finally admitted, "Okay, fine! I'm worried I'll lose,alright? Happy now? We should switch places!"
His smile widened slightly. "Come on then." Without another word,he stepped out of the cár, leaving me to scramble after him.
The group of modified car enthusiasts watched with barely concealed skepticism as Brandon approached. Their vehicles formed an impressive lineup - GTRs, Supras, and other heavily modified machines that made the Bentley look almost tame in comparison.

"Rules?" Brandon asked simply.

They exchanged uncertain glances, clearly thrown by the sight of a Bentley owner actually willing to race. The leader, a tall guy with facial piercings,recovered first. "Standard route - straight down the coast to the end.Though uh, with that ride..." He gestúred at the luxury car. "We could handicap it if you want?"
A redhead with a heavily modified GTR stepped forward, grinning."Or just beat one of us! That'l count as a win, yeah? No need to smoke the whole field with that fancy ride." "Deal." I couldn't help chiming in. "Just one car, right?" Brandon's sidelong glance made me step back automatically, fighting a guilty smile. As everyone moved to their cars, I caught fragments of whispered conversation between the racers: "Boss, that plate number..."

"Shut up and get in your car!"
"Don't mess this up - if we let a Bentley pass us, we'll never live it down..."1

"Give me the clean channel on the radio..."

The leader's voice cut through the chatter: "Everyone clear on the rules?And hey,careful on that last curve."
Brandon buckled his seatbelt with practiced efficiency, then turned to me. "Ready for this speed?"
I thought about how the car had felt under my control earlier and nodded.trying to project more confidence than I felt. "I think so."

"Hold on tight."
The moment Brandon hit the accelerator, I knew I'd made the right choice letting him drive. The Bentley surged forward with impossible grace, the engine's purr deepening to a satisfied growl. Within seconds. we'd passed two modified cars on the first curve, the movement so smooth I barely felt it. My fingers dug into the leather armrest as I stared at Brandon's profile,mesmerized by his absolute focus.
"Oh my god!" A voice crackled through someone's radio. "Who is this guy?The way he took that curve..." "Were you a professional racer?" I couldn't help asking, watching in awe as he navigated another bend with perfect precision. That dangerous half-smile played at his lips."Scared?" "No! I'll be quiet - you focus on driving!" Still, I couldn't tear my eyes away from his hands on the wheel, the way he seemed to anticipate each turn before it came.
We flew past another car, the night air whipping through the open windows. The coastal road stretched before us like a ribbon of silver in the moonlight. "Just keeping ahead of one car is enough!" I reminded him, but Brandon just hummed noncommittally.
"Not a racer," he finally said, smoothly dodging another challenger. "Just a college hobby."
*Of course.* I fought back a smile. *Brandon Stark,casually mentioning street racing was his "college hobby" like it was intramural soccer or something.*
A yellow GTR suddenly roared past us, its driver calling out, "Sorry man!"through his open window. The car cut in front of us aggressively, clearly trying to force us to slow down.

Brandon said nothing, just smoothly accelerated. His movements were so precise, so controlled - within moments the GTR was nothing but taillights behind us. As we approached the steepest coastal curve, the one the leader had warned about, he suddenly spoke. "Talk to me."

"What?" I turned to him, startled.

"Anything. Just talk," his lips curved into that dangerous smile. "Don't forget why we came racing in the first place."

I frowned slightly,sudIdenly remembering that we'd gone racing because of my dark mood. "DDid you really have to bring that up now?" "It needs to be addressed eventually," Brandon maintained a steady pace,keeping the car ahead of us in sight while ensuring none behind could pass. He seemed completely at ease as he chatted with me. "Feeling better?" "No," I said playfully. "But I might feel better if you passed everyone.Though that's probably impossible!"
"Is that so?" Brandon's smile deepened as he glanced at me. "Well, if my wife expects such things of me, I can hardly disappoint. Hold tight."
In an instant, he shot past several cars on the next curve,leaving them far behind in what felt like mere seconds.

I stared at Brandon in amazement, then turned to look back at the shrinking taillights behind us. "How did you--"
Before I could finish my question, Brandon's expression sharpened. "Hold on tight." With that warning, he floored the accelerator,sending us flying down the most treacherous part of the road.
"Shit!" The redhead leader's voice crackled over the radio. "Is he trying to get himself killed?"
Most racers would slow down on this section, but Brandon was actually accelerating. I gripped the handle above the door so hard my knuckles turned white, my entire body rigid with tension.
My heart was in my throat- in that moment, all I could do was trust Brandon completely.
Then, to my utter surprise, the car came to a stop. I turned to Brandon,confused."What's wrong?" Brandon killed the engine and closed the windows, then reached for me."Were you afraid?" His arms wrapped around me, pulling me close against his chest. I swallowed hard, my hands coming up to rest on his biceps. My body was still trembling slightly from the adrenaline, but I tried to sound brave."N-not at all." His low chuckle vibrated through his chest as he held me tighter,one hand coming up to stroke my hair. "Very brave," he murmured, the praise making something warm unfurl in my chest.
I took a deep breath. When I'd calmed down enough to pull back slightly,I found myself staring at his perfect features in the dim light. The way the moonlight caught his sharp jawline, the intensity in those dark eyes as they studied my face.
Before I could overthink it. I leaned up and pressed a soft kiss to the corner of his mouth.
Brandon's arm snaked around my waist, pulling me closer as he deepened the kiss. I started to retreat, suddenly overwhelmed by the intensity,but his hand came up to cradle the back of my head,holding me in place with gentle firmness.
Gradually, I found myself winding my arms around his neck, responding with growing enthusiasm. The tension of the evening, the thrill of the race,everything seemed to pour into that kiss.

When we finally broke apart, I was breathless."I..."

Brandon pulled me back against his chest, a low laugh escaping him."A bit late to be shy now, isn't it?"

My face burned as I pushed against his chest halfheartedly. Then I remembered something and bit my lip, "We're going to lose the race."

"Does that matter?" His dark eyes held mine, thumb tracing my lower lip. I shook my head, smiling. It had never been about the race anyway.In my mind, Brandon had already won-in more ways than one.
###Chapter 62: Brandon, You'll Protect Me,Rgt?

**Brandon's POV**
We crossed the finish line. June's presence beside me was a warm distraction, her earlier kiss still lingering on my lips. The memory of her boldness made something possessive stir in my chest. She'd initiated that kiss - my usually cautious wife had made the first move. The thought brought a slight smile to my face.
The red-haired leader approached as we stepped out of the car, his respect evident in the way he held himself. He pulled out a cigarette,offering it with a grin. "Nice driving, man! Where'd you learn those moves?"
I caught the cigarette with practiced ease, turning it between my fingers without lighting it. His eyes followed the movement, clearly impressed by even this small display of control.
"Want to join our crew?" He asked eagerly. "We could use someone with your skills."

I allowed myself a slight smile. "But I lost."

He laughed, shaking his head. "No way, man. We all know who really won here."

"The rules were clear," I kept my tone light as I handed the cigarette back."I'm the last one who past the line." As I turned to guide June back to the car, his voice called out behind us:"Hey,wait! You can take your prize, you know?"I shook my head without turning. "Keep it.""At least tell us your name?" The eagerness in his voice was almost endearing. "Let's stay in touch!"
One of the crew members stepped forward, his eyes fixed on my license plate. "Wait a minute..." His voice trailed off as realization dawned.
"Holy shit," another racer whispered. "Brandon Stark?"

The red-haired leader's eyes widened. "No way... *The* Brandon Stark?Wall Street's most powerful CEO?"

I met his gaze steadily, neither confirming nor denying.

"Man, if we'd known who you were..." The leader shook his head in disbelief. "You could have smoked us all if you wanted. Why'd you stop?"
"Had something more important to attend to." My eyes flickered briefly to June.
"Damn," the leader laughed. "Getting schooled by Brandon Stark himself.Guess we need more practice, boys!"

\---
The drive home was filled with a different kind of tension. June kept stealing glances at me when she thought I wasn't looking, her tongue darting out to wet her lips nervously. Every time she did, I had to resist the urge to pull over and kiss her again.

"You could have won easily," she finally broke the silence. "And they admitted you were better! Why didn't you take the prize?" I raised an eyebrow,keeping my eyes on the road. "You wanted it?" She hesitated, then nodded almost shyly, "You were clearly better than them. Why give up the prize?" "We can go back and get it if you want." I couldn't resist teasing her. Her hand shot out to grab my arm, the touch sending warmth through my sleeve. "No, no! I was just saying... They're probably gone anyway."
The rest of the drive passed in comfortable silence, broken only by June's soft breathing as she dozed off. By the time we reached the Hamptons estate, she was fighting to keep her eyes open.
"We're home," I said softly, reaching over to ruffle her hair.

She ducked away with an adorable pout. "Stop treating me like a kid! And don't pat my head ever again!"



The familiar comfort of my study welcomed me as I settled in to deal with the day's remaining business. James's updates about Matthew and the Taylor situation demanded immediate attention.
"Sir, about Matthew," James's voice carried his characteristic efficiency. "He's in police custody now, but he's refusing to reveal who's behind all this.Without that information, it complicates our next steps. How should we proceed?"
"Contact Edward Lee," I instructed, remembering the calculating gleam in Edward's eyes whenever Matthew was mentioned. "He'll know what to do."
"I see." The pieces were falling into place exactly as I'd expected. "Also, sir," James continued, "our sources confirm Capital Corp is in serious trouble. That's why Richard Taylor is pushing for Victoria's marriage to Alexander. They desperately need Stark Group's support."I leaned back slightly, pieces clicking into place. "Look into Summer's history with the Taylor family. Don't tell her about this yet." A soft knock interrupted whatever James had been about to say.June stood in the doorway, her damp hair falling in waves around her shoulders. The sight of her in silk pajamas, looking soft and vulnerable,made something protective stir in my chest.
"Am I disturbing you?" Her voice was barely above a whisper.

"Come here." I gestured her closer, noting how she clutched the neckline of her robe.

"It's late," she said softly. "Shouldn't you rest?"

My gaze dropped to where the silk robe clung to her curves, lingering on the generous swell of her breasts. She caught the direction of my stare and quickly tightened her grip on the neckline, a beautiful blush spreading across her cheeks. "Stop staring!"
I waited as she gathered her thoughts, watching various emotions play across her expressive face. Finally, she spoke: "About that video James sent... The one of me. You were there that night... I don't know what my father or Charles Windsor really wants." Her voice cracked slightly."Brandon,you'll protect me,right?"
The vulnerability in her tone made my jaw clench. "Are you scared?"

"A little." The admission seemed to cost her something.

"Don't worry about it." I kept my voice gentle despite the rage building in my chest. "T'Il handle everything." She nodded, clearly fighting exhaustion. As she turned to leave, I couldn't resist: "Is my wife inviting me to bed?" The blush that spread across her cheeks was absolutely worth it."What?No! I... I should go rest. You should too!"At the door, she paused and turned back. "Brandon... thank you."The soft sincerity in her voice made something warm unfurl in my chest.I watched her disappear down the hallway, already planning exactly how I would destroy everyone who had dared to hurt her.
###Chapter 63: Summer's Secret


**Victoria's POV**
The Taylor mansion's marble floors echoed with the sharp click of my heels as I stormed through the grand entrance. My hands trembled with barely contained rage as Brandon Stark's dismissive words played on repeat in my mind. The humiliation burned through my veins like acid,making my breath come in short, angry gasps.
*How dare he? How DARE he treat me like I'm nothing?*

I. Victoria Taylor - Hollywood's rising star, society's darling, the one everyone wanted to be or be with. What made Summer so special? She was nothing but a pathetic little corporate drone at Fortune Corp,and yet somehow she'd caught Brandon Stark's attention?
The Italian crystal vase made a satisfying crash as it shattered against the wall,sending prismatic shards skittering across the floor. Not enough. The antique clock followed. Each explosion of breaking pottery sent a jolt of bitter satisfaction through my body.
"Miss Victoria!" Betty, our newest maid, scurried after me with a dustpan,her mousy features pinched with concern. "Please be careful with the antiques! You might hurt yourself!" "You think this is funny?" I whirled on her, my voice rising to a shriek."You're  laughing at me, aren't you?" "No. Miss Victoria, I would never-"My hand shot out, tangling in her brown hair. The sharp gasp of pain as I yanked brought a cruel smile to my face. "Don't lie to me! I saw you I caught her reflection in one of the gilded mirrors - was that a hint of a smirk playing at her lips? The sight made something snap inside me. smirking! You think it's hilarious that Summer got what I wanted, don't you?"
Betty crumpled to the floor, tears streaming down her face. "Please, Miss Victoria! I wasn't laughing, I swear!"
"Wasn't laughing?" I tightened my grip, satisfaction coursing through me as she whimpered. "You think you can lie to my face? You're just like all the others, aren't you? Always taking her side-"

"Victoria!"
Grandpa George's commanding voice cut through my rage like a knife. He stood in the doorway, leaning heavily on his cane, his weathered face tight with disapproval. Mom appeared behind him, her perfectly mnanicured hand coming to rest on his shoulder.
"Father," Mom's voice carried that particular note of maternal concern she'd perfected over the years. "Victoria's clearly upset. Something must have happened..."
"Mom..." I let my voice crack, tears filling my eyes on command.

"Look at what she's done to the house!" Grandpa gesturedat the destruction around us, his voice sharp with anger. "Is this how we raised you? To throw tantrums like a spoiled child when things don't go your way?"

"Father," Mom's voice took on a reproachful tone. "Victoria's a successful actress now. If she's this upset, someone must have really hurt her feelings. "Hurt her feelings?" Grandpa's laugh held no humor. "She's been Hollywood's darling since her first role. The whole world bends over backward to please her. Who could possibly hurt precious Victoria?" The bitterness in his tone made my blood boil. "You're just angry because I'm not your precious Summer!"
"Victoria!" Dad's sharp voice made me flinch. I hadn't even noticed him arriving.
"What?" I met his gaze defiantly. "Am I wrong? Grandpa's always favored her.Summer can do no wrong in his eyes!"
"Enough!" Dad's face had gone an interesting shade of red."Go to your room.Now."


\---

"What happened, darling?" Mom asked me later.

My eyes gleamed. This was exactly the opening I needed. "It's all because of Summer."

"Summer?" Mom's voice rose sharply, immediate displeasure coloring her tone. "What did she do this time? Did she cause trouble for you?"
I let my eyes water slightly, the perfect picture of a wronged daughter. "I saw these shoes today - you know the ones from Paris Fashion Week? The ones my favorite actress wore? They finally had them in Manhattan, but..”I let my voice crack slightly. "Summer and this man just... they humiliated me,Mom!"

"A man?" Mom's attention sharpened instantly, her eyes narrowing."Summer was with a man? Are you sure about this?" "Yes," I confirmed. "And you know she's still playing innocent with Alexander! How could she do this to me? She knows how I feel about him,and yet here she is,going around with other men!""That little Viper!" Mom's grip on my hand tightened painfully."Has anyone else heard about this?"

"No. I haven't told anyone." I said quickly.

"Good. Don't breathe a word of this to anyone - not even Alexander. Do you understand?"
I frowned slightly. "But why? Mom, if Summer's seeing someone behind Alexander's back..."

"No. Victoria." Mom's voice turned sharp. "Have you forgotten about Charles Windsor?"
The name sent a jolt through me. Suddenly, I remembered the birthday party, watching Mom carefully prepare that special tea with double the usual dose. We'd had Summer right where we wanted her, and yet somehow she'd slipped away.
A slow smile spread across my face as understanding dawned."Mom...is this about the video Dad received?"

Mom's eyes glittered dangerously. "Charles has always preferred...innocent gírls. The fact that Summer's running around with other men needs to stay our little secret. Do you understand what I'm saying?"
"Perfectly." I couldn't help the vicious satisfaction blooming in my chest."Don't worry, Mom. I won't say a word to anyone."

"Good girl." Mom patted my hand. "Now, let Mommy handle everything.We'll make sure Summer learns her place soon enough." Later that night, I crept down the hallway toward Dad's study, drawn by the sound of raised voices. The thick mahogany door didn't quite muffle their argument. 
"-can't risk it. Elizabeth!" Dad's voice carried clearly through the door."Father already knows about what happened at his birthday party. If we try anything else-"

"What choice do we have?" Mom's voice held an edge of hysteria."Capital Corp needs that investment! Two hundred million dollars, Richard. Where else are we going to get that kind of money?"

"But Summer-"

"She's lived off our charity long enough!" Mom's voice turned sharp. "It's time she did something for this family!"

"You're insane," Dad's voice dropped lower, forcing me to press closer to the door. "We're never discussing this again. Do you want everyone to know?"

"What does it matter?" Mom's bitter laugh made me flinch. "This has nothing to do with you anyway. We shouldn't have taken her back when-


"Elizabeth!" Dad's voice cracked like a whip. "Never speak of this again.Do you understand? Never!"

I sagged against the wall, my mind spinning. The way Mom talked about Summer, the secrets, Dad's reaction... The implications made my head hurt.


"Good grief, I need to think!" Dad's exhausted voice interrupted my thoughts. "We need to find a way to get Summer to come home." "Think about what?" Mom's voice turned sharp. "Don't forget about the Windsors..." "Enough!" Dad's tone brooked no argument. "I know you don't like her,Do you think I do? Father isn't blind - he knows exactly what we're trying to do."

1 pulled away from the door, a slow smile spreading across my face as pieces clicked into place. Whatever secrets they were hiding about Summer's past, one thing was clear - she wasn't what everyone thought she was.And that... well, that just made everything so much more interesting.What I need now is just patience.
###Chapter 64: Threats

**Summer's POV**

The next day at work, the sharp click of familiar footsteps made me look up from my computer screen. Alexander was heading straight for my desk,his face tight with barely contained emotion. My stomach clenched as I recognized that look - it never meant anything good.

"You yesterday..." he started, his voice carrying an edge I'd never heard before.

I kept my expression professionally neutral despite how my pulse quickened. "Did you need something?"

"You didn't come home last night!" His voice rose slightly, drawing curious glances from nearby cubicles. "Running around all night - do you have any idea what people will say? A young woman like you..."
"Excuse me?" I set down my papers carefully, figting to keep my voice steady. "Since when do I need to report my whereabouts to you?"
Alexander's face darkened as I stood to leave. He caught up in two quick strides, grabbing my arm. "Summer! Where were you last night? It was Brandon, wasn't it? That bastard - do you even know what kind of person he is? How could you just spend the night with someone like that? Have you thought about what people will say?"
"Enough!" The word burst out. My mind flashed to Brandon - his quiet strength, the way he always seemed to appear when I needed him most. "He's not the kind of person you think he is." I said firmly.
"Summer, how could you disappoint me like this?" Alexander's eyes were wild with something that looked unsettlingly like possession. "How could you do this to me?" Before I could react, his hands shot out, grabbing my shoulders with bruising force. The world tilted as he shoved me into the empty elevator,my back hitting the wall hard enough to knock the breath from my lungs.
"Let go!" I gasped, fear and fury warring in my chest. "Alexander, you've lost your mind! Let me go!"
He pressed closer, his cologne suddenly suffocating. "Tell me the truth -did you sleep with him? Answer me!"
Terror gave me strength. I thrashed against his grip, managing to land a stinging slap across his face. "Look at who I am! I'm Summer, not Victoria.If you want to go crazy, go find Victoria!"
The mention of his fiancée's name had an unexpected effect. Instead of backing off, he suddenly wrapped his arms around me in a crushing embrace.
"Summer, I'm sorry," his voice turned sickeningly sweet. "You know you're the one I really love. Victoria... that was just a moment of weakness.She seduced me.Summer."
"Let go," I could barely breathe through his grip. "Let go or I'Il scream."

"Go ahead," his tone turned ugly. "Scream. And I'll tell everyone how you're still in love with me, how we were together first. Summer, I know you're angry about Victoria, but you have to understand-she has Capital Corp shares. I had no choice. But once we're married and those shares are mine,I'll divorce her. Then we can be together." The words hit like physical blows. With strength born of desperation, I drove my knee up between his legs. The moment his grip loosened, I lunged for the elevator buttons. "You don't love me anymore, is that it?" He wheezed, still managing to catch my wrist, "So you've fallen for that thug instead?" "He's not a thug." The defense came automatically. I took a deep breath.meeting his eyes steadily. "And go fuck yourself."

\---
My phone's shrill ring felt like an ice pick through my skull. I stared at the screen for long moments before finally answering.
"Why did it take so long to pick up?" Elizabeth's sharp voice carried its usual note of displeasure.
The familiar tone sent a lance of pain through my chest. No matter how many times she proved otherwise, some small part of me still couldn't understand how she could treat her own daughter like this. Victoria got all her maternal warmth while I... I got this.
"I was working," I managed, trying to keep the bitterness from my voice."Did you need something?"
No matter how much I resented her, I couldn't change the fact that she was my mother. That truth was carved into my bones, impossible to excise.
"Come home!" The command in her voice hadn't changed since my childhood. "Don't forget, this is your høme. Your grandfather has been so good to you..."
"I'm busy." I cut her off, unable to bear another lecture about family duty.


"Busy?" She scoffed. "What could you possibly be busy with? You're just an employee. Listen carefully - if you don't come home today..."
"Then what?" A bitter laugh escaped me. "If you'd shown even a fraction of the concern for me that you show for Victoria, maybe I wouldn't dread coming home so much." "What are you implying?" Her voice turned deadly soft. "That this is my fault? Summer, I'm warning you - if you don't come home today, you'll regret it."
Ice crystallized in my veins. "What could I possibly have to regret?"

"Those videos of you and Charles Windsor are right here."The satisfaction in her voice made me want to throw up. "Think carefully about what you might regret. Come home. Now."
My voice shook despite my best efforts. "I'm your daughter too! How could you do this to me?"

"There is no 'how could I." The casual cruelty in her voice felt like knives in my chest. "Capital Corp needs funding, and Charles is willing to provide it. If you still consider me your mother, come home. Otherwise, these videos go public. Your choice."
Her voice softened to something almost maternal. "You should understand - Charles is the third son of the Windsor family. They're far more powerful than the Taylors. If you become his woman, everything the Windsors have could be yours. I've arranged everything for you. One day you'll thank me for this."

The mask of maternal concern made bile rise in my throat. But those videos in her hands were a ticking time bomb. Elizabeth would do anything for Victoria - if she gave those videos to my sister... I couldn't even imagine surviving that kind of humiliation.

"Fine," I forced the words past numb lips. "I'll meet you. But not at home." "Perfect." The satisfaction in her voice made my skin crawl.
The moment the call ended, my legs gave out. I slid down the wall,staring blindly ahead as the world spun around me. "Miss Taylor!" Amy's worried voice seemed to come from very far away."Are you alright?"
I forced my lips into something approximating a smile. "I'm fine.Everything's fine."
Back at my desk, my trembling fingers found Brandon's contact in my phone. I stared at his name for long moments before changing the contact to simply "Bran."

The first call went straight to voicemail.

*Maybe he's in a meeting?* I tried again immediately.

My fingers shook as I hit redial for the third time. The phone felt impossibly heavy in my hand as I waited, praying to hear his deep voice instead of another voicemail message.

*Please pick up. Brandon, I need you...*

But only silence answered.
###Chapter 65: Taking Precautions


**Summer's POV**
The walls of my Fortune Corp office felt like they were closing in. After Elizabeth's threat, I could barely breathe. The video from the birthday party hung over my head like a sword, ready to drop at any moment.I needed help, and with Brandon unreachable...
Ruby answered on the first ring. "What's up girl? Want to grab lunch?"

"Sort of..." My voice cracked as I tried to explain the situation. The words tumbled out in a rush - Elizabeth's call, the threats, the video.
"What the hell?" Ruby's voice rose sharply. "Elizabeth and that Windsor guy... What kind of sick game are they playing? Where's your husband?What does Brandon say?"
I caught my lower lip between my teeth. "He knows about the video situation and promised to handle it. But Elizabeth just contacted me today - I don't think he knows yet. I tried calling him, but he seems busy." The admission felt like acid in my mouth. "What should I do about this?"
"Your mother is something else!" Ruby's anger crackled through the phone.
"Using that kind of video to threaten you? Shouldn't she be protecting you and fighting against the Windsors?"
The silence stretched between us. My lack of response must have hit Ruby hard because her voice suddenly softened. "Oh god, I'm sorry..." "It's fine, you're right." I swallowed hard. "I have to meet her today. Ruby,can you help me?" "Of course!" The immediate response made something warm unfurl in my chest."When and where tonight?" "Seven o'clock, at The Plaza Hotel." My fingers twisted nervously in my blouse. "Please,you have to come!"
"Got it." Ruby's voice carried absolute conviction. "And hey, try calling Brandon again. He needs to know about this."
After hanging up, I stared at Brandon's contact info again. One more try couldn't hurt. This time, the call connected almost immediately.
"Yes?" His deep voice sent relief flooding through me.

For a moment, I couldn't speak, my reliefat hearing his voice colliding with the terror of Elizabeth's threats in my throat. The comfort of his deep tone made me want to curl up somewhere safe and just listen to him breathe, but we didn't have that luxury right now.

"June?" The slight concern in his tone made my heart skip.


"Yes, it's me. Brandon."
I could hear the smile in his voice. "I was in a board meeting," his deep voice carried a hint of apology. "Had my phone on silent - there's been quite a battle." A pause, then: "What's wrong?"
"My mother called today." The words cameout smaller than intended.


His tone sharpened instantly. "What did she say?"

"About that video..." I twisted my fingers nervously. "Brandon, she wants to meet." The sound of his fingers drumming against his desk carried clearly through the phone."You agreed?""Yes." I closed my eyes, hating how weak I sounded. "She threatened to release the videos if I didn't show up. Brandon, should I go?" "Go." His voice carried that gentle authority that never failed to make my pulse race. "Let's see what she's really after. I'll come with you."
"No need." The words tumbled out before I could stop them. "When I couldn't reach you earlier, I called Ruby. She's a reporter and agreed to come with me."
Something dangerous flickered in his tone. "That works too. It's probably better if I don't show up right now. Not for my sake, but for you..."
"You agreed we'd keep our marriage private for now." I couldn't quite keep the tremor from my voice.
His soft sigh made my chest ache. "Right. So I'm supposed to stay hidden."

"Don't be like that." A helpless laugh escaped me. "I'll...I'll introduce you to my friends next time, okay? Tonight I'll go with Ruby. She's a reporter,she can help!"
"Fair enough." The amusement in his voice eased some of the tension in my shoulders. "Be careful. I'll wait for you at home."

"Okay."



The Plaza Hotel loomed before us, its elegant facade a stark reminder of another party - Alexander and Victoria's engagement celebration.The memory made my stomach turn. "Here." Ruby pulled something from her bag, pressing it into my hands. "Take these." I stared at the small devices in confusion. "What's this?" "Audío recomder and hidden camera." She grinned, but her eyes were serious. "Hey, I'm a journalist- these are essential tools,right?" "Why are you giving me these?"
Ruby's expression hardened. "Your mother threatens you with a video and you're asking why? After what happened at the party, we need insurance.Who knows what they might try?"
Her fingers moved quickly, showing me how to operate the equipment."When you get in, find a chance to place the recorder under the table. Make sure it's running - we need to record everything."
The weight of the devices felt impossibly heavy in my hands. "Ruby..."

"Better safe than sorry." Her voice softened slightly. "They may be your parents, but after what happened last time..."

I managed a weak smile. "I get it."
"The camera goes in your purse." She helped me position it carefully."Make sure it captures your parents and Charles Windsor.Got it?"
My heart clenched at the name. *Charles Windsor.* The man who'd drugged me at my grandfather's party, who'd filmed me in that vulnerable state. And now my own mother was trying to force me to meet him again.
"Summer?" Ruby's concerned voice broke through my spiraling thoughts."You okay?"
I straightened my spine, forcing steel into my voice. "I'm fine."*have to be.*
###Chapter 66: Apologize to Mr. Windsor

**Summer's POV**

I couldn't help smiling as Ruby demonstrated how to use the recording equipment for what felt like the tenth time. Her genuine concern warmed my heart in a way my own family never managed anymore.

"What are you smiling about?" Ruby's sharp voice cut through my dark thoughts. "This is serious! Listen to me carefully!"

I carefully tucked the recording device into my purse, double-checking the hidden camera. "I know, I know. Don't worry, I'll be careful!" The words came out softer than intended as emotion threatened to overwhelm me. *How did I get so lucky to have a friend like Ruby?* While my own sister plotted behind my back, here was Ruby, going above and beyond to protect me.

Ruby's frown deepened as she studied my face. "Fine, call me overprotective. But you have to be extra careful, especially with drinks.Don't consume anything they offer you."
"I understand." The weight of the recording equipment felt impossibly heavy in my bag, a physical reminder of how far things had fallen. That I needed to secretly record a meeting with my own family...
"They're here!" Ruby's whispered urgently. We watched as Richard,Elizabeth, and Victoria swept through the hotel's grand entrance, my sister'
s perfect posture a stark contrast to our mother's agitated movements.I managed a bitter smile, patting her shoulder."I should head in."∗t′S almost funny,* I thought, watching Victoria's perfect posture as she disappeared into the hotel, *My sister walks like she's still on a movie set,always performing,* The realization brought more sadness than anger now -when had we become such strangers?

Ruby's hand shot out, gripping my arm. "Wait! Let's wait for Charles Windsor to arrive first!"

I shook my head firmly. "No time. I've met Charles before - he's more complicated than he appears. I need to plant these devices before he gets here!"

"Okay!" Ruby nodded, "Go on then, I'Il be in the next room!"

My phone's sudden buzz made us both jump. Elizabeth's name flashed across the screen, making my stomach clench.

"Where are you?" My mother's sharp voice carried its usual note of displeasure. "Summer, don't try anything clever. You must come. It's almost seven."

I forced my voice to remain steady despite how my hands shook. "Almost there.Which room?"

"The Plaza, room 3702. Come up immediately."

The elevator ride to the 37th floor felt endless. Each floor that passed brought me closer to whatever trap they'd set. My reflection in the mirrored walls looked pale but determined. *I'm not that naive girl anymore,* I reminded myself. *The one who believed family meant unconditional love, who thought Victoria's cruelty was just sisterly teasing,who trusted Elizabeth's maternal facade.* Brandon's strength seemed to flow through me just thinking about him. And now I had Ruby too -proof that real love didn't need manipulation or threats. As I approached room 3702,voices carried clearly through the heavy door. "Mom, didn't you say she was coming?" Victoria's anxious tone made me pause. "What if she changed her mind?" Elizabeth's cold laugh sent shivers down my spine. "Impossible. That stupid girl wouldn't dare. Or did youforget about the video I have?"

"Who's out there?" Richard's voice boomed suddenly. "Open the door!"

I took a deep breath, squared my shoulders, and pushed open the door.Victoria immediately rushed forward, her perfect smile firmly in place. "Summer,you came!"

I stepped back before she could touch me, watching her expression falter slightly.

"Summer," she tried again, her voice dripping with fake concern, "I know you're still angry,but..."

"Angry?" I cut her off, keeping my voice deliberately light. "Why would I be angry? What have you done that's worth getting angry about?"

Victoria's perfect mask cracked just slightly as she shot a helpless look at Elizabeth.

Our mother slammed her hand on the table, making the crystal glasses rattle. "Watch your attitude! What right do you have to be angry with your sister? We should be the angry ones!"

I met her gaze steadily, refusing to flinch. Something in my expression must have startled her because she faltered for just a moment before recovering her usual venom."Don't blame us for being harsh," Elizabeth's voice dripped with false concern. "You know the Winddsors' position on Wall Street. Charles Windsor showing interest in you is a blessing you don't deserve. Don't be ungrateful." "Is that so?" I turned to Richard, who'd been suspiciously quiet. "Father thinks I'm being ungrateful too?" His uncomfortable silence spoke volumes.

I let my gaze sweep the suite, noting potential places to plant the recording device while keeping my tone casual. "A blessing? How thoughtful of you, Mother! Such a golden opportunity,and instead of saving it for your beloved Victoria, you're giving it to your disappointing younger daughter. How very generous of you!"

"You ungrateful little-" Elizabeth's face contorted with rage. "I'm your mother! Do you think I'd harm you?"

"Of course not," I couldn't keep the bitterness from my voice. "You didn't drug my tea, you didn't film me, and you're not the one forcing me here today."

A lazy drawl from the doorway made my blood run cold. "Long time no see,Summer."

Charles Windsor leaned against the doorframe with casual elegance, his presence immediately dominating the room. Elizabeth and Richard scrambled to their feet. "Mr. Windsor, please come in!"

I caught Victoria secretly studying Charles's refined features, jealousy flickering across her face before she could hide it.

Charles settled into the seat beside me, pushing an empty glass my way."Do me a favor?"

I forced myself to stay still as I poured his drink, fighting the urge to recoil from his proximity. "Mr. Windsor, we're honored you could join us." Richard's tone dripped with obsequious charm. "About last time - Summer was just being impulsive,Please forgive her youthful mistake."Charles raised one perfect eyebrow. "Oh? Is that why you called me here
###Chapter 67: Tasting Despair

**Brandon's POV**

June's call had left me more unsettled than I cared to admit. The tremor in her voice, the way she tried to sound brave even as fear crept in - it made something protective and dangerous stir in my chest. I'd promised to stay away, to let her handle this herself, but...

"James." My voice carried absolute authority as I hit the intercom. "Find out which room the Taylors booked at The Plaza. Then get everything ready - surveillance, security, all of it. I want eyes and ears on that entire floor."

A few minutes later.

"Done, sir." James said. "Room 3702."

A slight smile tugged at my lips. "Good. Have the car brought around."

The drive to The Plaza felt endless, my mind racing through contingencies.June might think she needed to face her family alone, but I'd be damned if I let her walk into another trap unprotected. The memory of finding her drugged at her grandfather's party still made my blood boil.
The Plaza's thick carpeting muffled our approach as we neared room 3701.James had already secured the entire floor - necessary precautions when dealing with someone like Charles Windsor. The bastard had no idea who he was really dealing with. The door opened silently, revealing a young woman with short hair pressed against the adjoining wall. She spun around at our entrance,eyes widening in alarm. "You are?" Her voice carried more steel than fear. James stepped forward smoothly. "This is Mr. Stark's room.Perhaps you'd like to explain your presence here?"

I studied her carefully - this must be Ruby Scott, the war correspondent June had mentioned. Her defensive posture and quick assessment of exits marked her as someone used to dangerous situations. Good. June needed friends like this.

"Brandon Stark." I introduced myself simply, watching understanding dawn in her eyes.

"Oh thank god!" Relief flooded her face. "You're Summer's husband! She told me about you. Mr. Stark, you have to help -they're threatening her with some video and that Charles Windsor is here and-"

"I know." I cut her off gently, gesturing for her to take a seat. The monitoring equipment James had set up covered every angle of room 3702.June's voice carried through clearly, making my jaw clench. Even through the grainy footage, I could see how they crowded her, trying to break her spirit.

"You're just going to watch?" Ruby's voice rose slightly. "We have to do something! Summer's in there alone with those people!"

"Miss Scott." I kept my voice steady despite the rage building in my chest."Do you really think June is that easily broken?"

Ruby's expression shifted from outrage to thoughtful consideration."No...actually, Summer's stronger than most people realize. It's just... these are her family members. They know exactly how to hurt her." "Precisely." I settled into one of the chairs, eyes fixed on the monitors.Every cell in my body screamed to intervene, to shield June from their poison. But she needed this - needed to face the truth about her family head-on. "She needs to face this. Sometimes you have to taste true despair 
before you can break free."

"That's cruel!" Ruby protested, but there was understanding in her eyes.

"Crueler than what they're doing to her now?" I raised an eyebrow, even as my hands clenched into fists beneath the table. "You're her friend -you've watched this pattern repeat for years, haven't you?"

Ruby's silence was answer enough.

My eyes never left the montor as June squared her shoulders, facing down her so-called family with quiet dignity. Pride and protectiveness warred in my chest. *Show them who you really are, June. Show them they can't break you anymore.*

\---

**Summer's POV**

The weight of Charles Windsor's gaze made my skin crawl as I shifted in my seat. The Plaza's elegant dining room suddenly felt suffocating,trapped here with the very people who were supposed to protect me.

"Mr. Taylor," Charles's lazy drawl carried an edge of amusement,"your family certainly puts on quite a show."

Richard's face turned an interesting shade of red. "Mr. Windsor, please forgive my younger daughter's behavior. She's being incredibly rude-"

"Actually," Charles cut him off smoothly, "I find Summer quite fascinating." His eyes found mine with predatory focus. "Won't you sit down, Miss Taylor?"
 "Excuse me." I stood abruptly, unable to bear another moment of his presence. "I need to use the restroom." Victoria's heels clicked against the marble floor as she followed me out.I could feel her perfect mask cracking with every step.

"Charles Windsor choosing you is a blessing," she hissed once we were alone in the hallway. "You should be grateful!"

I turned to face her, finally letting my own mask drop. "Grateful? Like how grateful I should be that you stole my fiancé?"

"Don't act so superior!" Victoria's composure shattered completely. "You think I don't know about the video? Mom has it ready to release any time.And Charles Windsor... well, you've heard the rumors about his...particular tastes, haven't you?"

Ice crystallized in my veins as I studied the stranger wearing my sister's face. "Drop the act, Victoria. We both know you've never seen me as a sister."

"Of course not!" The words exploded from her like poison. "Why should you get everything? I'm just as good as you - better even! But somehow you're always the special one!"

"You're not worse than me," I said quietly, studying her perfect features twisted with hatred. "You might even be better in many ways. Victoria,what exactly is your problem with me? I'm done talking to you."

"Scared?" Her laugh held no humor. "Well, you should be. The venom in her voice made my skin crawl. "You won't escape this, Summer."

"That's not for you to decide," I met her gaze steadily.I pushed past her into the bathroom, feeling her eyes burning into my back. Something about her expression made me uneasy. This wasn't like Victoria- normally she would have kept pushing, kept twisting the knife.Why back off so quickly? The thought nagged at me as I washed my hands. The bathroom felt eerily quiet, the elegant marble surfaces suddenly oppressive. Then I caught a glimpse of movement in the mirror- a dark figure appearing behind me with terrifying speed. Before I could react,a hand clamped over my mouth.pressing something sweet-smelling against my face.

My last coherent thought as consciousness slipped away was of Brandon.

The world went black.
###Chapter 68: I Promise She'll Be Safe

**Brandon's POV**

Ruby paced nervously behind me, her war correspondent training evidlent in how she positioned herself to see both the door and the monitors. "We should do something," she muttered for what felt like the hundredth time.

The surveillance feed from room 3702 showed Victoria returning with a satisfied smile, her perfectly manicured fingers tapping out a message on her phone. Through the camera, I watched her lean close to Charles Windsor, who lounged on the leather sofa with practiced indolence.

"Mr. Windsor," Victoria's voice dripped honey, "Summer's had a change of heart. She wants to surprise you."

Elizabeth jumped in immediately, her maternal mask firmly in place. "Mr.Windsor.you may not know this, but my younger daughter is quite shy.She's actually expressed her admiration for you privately." Her smile turned conspiratorial. "Summer has such genuine feelings for you."

Richard stood silently by the window, his eyes darting nervously toward the door. The man's tells were pathetically obvious - he knew exactly what they'd planned for his own daughter.

Charles's lazy smile widened as he rose from the sofa. "Well then, who am I to keepo the lady waiting?" His movements were too precise,too measured as he straightened his jacket. "I believe I'll take my leave now.After all, it would be rude to keep Miss Summer waiting for too long." My fingers tightened on the desk as I watched him exit 3702. The moment he disappeared from the camera's view, I hit the intercom. "James. Lock down every exit. No one leaves The Plaza." 
Ruby said anxiously. "Where's he going? We have to find Summer!"

"No." I kept my voice steady despite the rage building in my chest. The sight of Elizabeth practically offering her daughter to Charles again made something dark and violent stir inside me. But I couldn't let that show -not now, not when June needed me thinking clearly. "James will escort you home."

"Mr. Stark." Ruby's voice cracked with emotion as she watched Elizabeth's performance on screen. "I've known Summer since college. She's always tried so hard to please them, to be the daughter they wanted. And now they're just..." She trailed off, hands clenching into fists.

I understood her fury all too well. The protective instinct that roared through my veins demanded immediate action, demanded that I make them pay for every time they'd hurt June. But that wasn't what she needed right now.

"No!" Her protest carried genuine concern. "I'm not leaving without Summer!"

"If you truly care about her safety, you'll stay put." I watched Charles's careful movements on the monitor. "I'll handle this."

"But Summer-"

"I'm her husband." The words carried more weight than I'd intended. "I promise she'lI be perfectly fine tomorrow. Those recordings you helped her set up might prove useful very soon." Ruby's hesitation was brief but noticeable. "I... alright." "Miss Scott." I softened my tone slightly. "We may need your professional skills again soon." "Anything for Summer, Just keep her safe." "Get Marcus on the line." I kept my voice steady despite the rage building in my chest. The fact that I couldn't see where Charles was headed made something dark and violent stir inside me.

The connection was immediate. "Brandon? What's wrong?"

"You don't know where Charles is right now, do you?" I let the implications hang in the air.

Marcus's sharp intake of breath was audible. "Charles? That fucking troublemaker..."

"He's at The Plaza." My voice carried just a hint of steel.

"I'll handle it." Marcus's tone promised swift action.

"Stop him quickly, Marcus. And I'll give you the land you've always wanted."

Several minutes later my phone buzzed -Marcus. "Go to room 808. Took a while to make Charles tell me where he is. That fool... You'd better be quick because I'm not sure if he would listen to me..."

I was already moving before he finished speaking. The eighth floor hallway was silent as I approached room 808, but the faint sound of voices carried through the door. The door to 808 was unlocked - another deliberate message from Charles.The moment I stepped inside, my trained eyes began cataloging details.The lingering sweetness in the air told me they'd used some kind of drug.The hotel's surveillance device had been destroyed - Charles making sure there'd be no direct evidence of what transpired. James's professional mask cracked into a slight smile. "Victoria's entire life is an open book to us now.""Perfect." I allowed myself a cold smile, absently stroking June's hair as she shifted restlessly.′′Iwant headlines about Victoria tomorrow.Make My eyes caught more details as I moved closer. The careful placement of the broken vase pieces. The deliberate shallow cut on her hand,precise enough to leave a mark without causing real damage. Even the way he'd positioned her on the bed -everything had been staged to send a message.

The flawless perfection of her skin seemed to mock the violence they'd tried to do here. I could almost see Charles standing over her, touching her face with those entitled hands, thinking he had the right to even look at what was mine.


"Sir?"

"Call Dr. Sean," I ordered, already shrugging off my suit jacket to wrap around June. "Have him meet us at the Hamptons estate."

I gathered Summer carefully against my chest and carried her out of the hotel. Her skin still burned with whatever drug they'd given her, but her breathing had steadied slightly.

James couldn't quite hide his surprise. He'd clearly expected more immediate retaliation, perhaps even direct conflict with the Windsor family.But the Windsors would have to wait-for now.

"The investigation into Victoria," I kept my voice low,conscious of June's proximity. "What did you find?" sure it's front page."

"Yes, sir." James hesitated briefly."And the Taylor family?"

"Leave them for now." My gaze dropped to June's sleeping face,something warm unfurling in my chest despite the rage still simmering beneath the surface. The gentle innocence of her expression made all my protective instincts surge. Right now, keeping her safe was all that mattered.
###Chapter 69: I'll Stay With You Always


**Brandon's POV**
"Every time I'm about to rest after surgery, you call." Sean's complaint carried clearly through the mansion's foyer as he strode in, medical bag in hand. Despite his words, his quick movements betrayed his concern."This better be important."
"You weren't sleeping anyway." I kept my voice steady despite the rage still simmering beneath the surface. June lay unconscious upstairs,her skin burning with whatever drug they'd given her. Every second we wasted felt like torture."Come.Now."
Sean's usual playful demeanor vanished the moment he saw June's still form on my bed. His movements turned precise and professional as he began checking her vitals.
"What happened?" His voice carried that particular edge I recognized from our collegedays - the one that meant he was genuinely worried.
"Just check her condition." The words came out sharper than intended.

Sean's hands moved with practiced efficiency as he examined June,his expression growing more focused by the second. When he reached her hand,he paused, studying the shallow cut there with narrowed eyes.
"This was deliberate," he said quietly, not looking up. "Someone knew exactly what they were doing. The cut's precise -meant to counteract whatever drug they used without causing real damage.""Brandon." Sean's voice cut through my murderous thoughts. "She's going to be fine. The drug's not dangerous - looks like a standard sedative,nothing more.Combined with exhaustion..." He trailed off, studying my face, "She just needs rest." "She's been unconscious for hours."
"Because she's sleeping," Sean's exasperation carried clearly as he packed away his equipment. "When was the last time you saw her get proper rest?The sedative's wearing off, but her body's taking advantage of the chance to recover." A slight smile tugged at his lips. "Never thought I'd see the day - Brandon Stark, worried sick over a woman."
My glare should have frozen hell itself. "If you value your life..."

A knock at the door interrupted whatever threat I'd been about to make.James entered with his usual efficiency, though something in his bearing caught my attention.
"Sir, we caught the one who drugged her." His voice dropped lower."Edward's assistant Landon is questioning him now."
"Study. Now." I cast one last look at June's sleeping form before following James out.
Sean's footsteps echoed behind us. "You got Edward's people involved?This must be serious."

"Why are you still here?"

He grinned, all traces of the professional doctor vanishing. "Can't sleep anyway. Might as well watch the show." His eyes gleamed with dangerous interest as he turned to James. "Where's Landon working?"
James glanced at me uncertainly. At my slight nod, he answered,"The usual place." "Perfect." Sean's smile turned predatory. "I'll have answers for you within twenty-four hours."The moment 'he left, James's professional mask cracked slightly."Sir,did you plan for Dr. Sullivan to take over the interrogation?"

I allowed myself a slight smile. Sean's seemingly casual interest had been exactly what I'd counted on. His methods of extracting information were...uniquely effective. "Have Landon give him whatever he needs."
"About Miss Victoria's investigation," James continued smoothly,producing a thick folder. "We found quite a bit about her activities in the entertainment industry. She's been... busy."
I studied the documents with growing satisfaction. Victoria's perfect mask hid years of careful manipulation and strategic destruction of rivals. "Not all at once," I decided, selecting one particular incident. "Start with this.Give it to the gossip magazines."

"Yes, sir." James's efficiency never wavered. "And the Windsors?"


"Later."
I spent another hour in my study before finally returning to the bedroom.The sight that greeted me made something warm unfurl in my chest -June sleeping peacefully, completely defenseless. In this unguarded state,her face held a pure innocence that stirred unfamiliar protective instincts.

After a cold shower, I emerged wearing only a white silk robe. I dimmed the lights, letting the soft glow cast gentle shadows across the room.Standing by the bed, I found myself studying her face with an intensity that surprised even me. Her breathing was deep and even, face relaxed in complete tranquility. I settled into the chair by the window, reaching out to brush my fingers along her cheek. In her sleep, June seemed to sense my touch. A small,contented smile curved he lips as she instinctively grasped my hand. Something about that unconscious gesture of trust made my breath catch.I slipped off my shoes and moved closer, the mattress dipping slightly beneath my weight. As if sensing my presence, June shifted in her sleep.making room for me beside her.

The smile that spread across her face was achingly sweet, even in dreams.Before I could pull away, her arms wrapped around my neck,drawing herself closer until she was practically draped across me.

My eyes darkened as I braced myself on one arm, looking down at her peaceful expression. She nuzzled closer, still smiling, and whispered my name with such warmth it made my chest ache, "Brandon..."

I've always taken what I wanted without hesitation, using any means necessary to achieve my goals. But with June... with her, I found myself exercising a patience I never knew I possessed. I understood her hesitation with relationships, her careful approach after being betrayed. While part of me ached for more, I would wait until she was ready to accept me completely.

When I finally moved to get up, her hand shot out, grabbing mine. "Don't go," she mumbled, still half-asleep.
My resolve melted instantly. "Alright, I won't leave." I squeezed her hand gently, threading our fingers together. "I'll stay right here with you."

Her smile of pure contentment was both reward and torture.For any other man, having their wife this close would be simple pleasure. But I wanted more than just physical intimacy- I wanted her heart given freely, not out of obligation or circumstance."Sleep," I murmnured, watching her drift deeper into dreams. "T'll stay with you always."
###Chapter 70: Dear, Don't You Remember?


**Summer's POV**
I drifted slowly from a warm dream where Brandon held my hand,leading me forward through an endless path of light. The dream felt so real that when consciousness finally crept in. I could still feel the lingering warmth in my palm.
My eyes fluttered open to find myself in the familiar master bedroom of the Hamptons estate. Soft morning light filtered through the floor-to-ceiling windows, casting everything in a gentle golden glow. The first thing I noticed was Brandon's cologne - that subtle, masculine scent that always made my pulse race.

Then I saw him.
Brandon was asleep in the armchair beside the bed, his perfect features softened by sleep. His suit jacket lay carelessly draped over the chair's arm -so unlike his usual precise habits. In the morning light,his face looked almost vulnerable, those impossibly long eyelashes casting shadows across his cheeks.
My heart did a complicated flip as memories from last night tried to surface. The Plaza Hotel... Victoria's accusations... being drugged in the bathroom... Everything after that was a blur of disconnected sensations.Panic started to build in my chest as I realized I couldn't remember how P'd gotten home.I touched my lips absently, finding them slightly swollen. Heat flooded my face as implications started to sink in. *What exactly happened last night?* His hand found mine again as I slipped them on, the gesture so natural it made my heart skip. "After Victóría and I fought..." I couldn't quite keep my voice steady. "And then being drugged in the bathroom. What really happened?" I couldn't quite meet his eyes. "You... I mean, last night..."The corner of his mouth lifted in that dangerous half-smile. "Nothing happened. You're perfectly safe.""Really?" I couldn't keep the hope from my voice. "You're not just saying that?"
"Why would I lie about this?" His dark eyes held mine with quiet intensity.

I twisted my fingers nervously in the silk sheets. "But Victoria and I had that argument, then someone drugged me in the bathroom.What exactly happened?"
"They kidnapped you." His jaw tightened slightly. "But we got you out in time."
"I must have been so useless..." The words came out smaller than intended.
Brandon's fingers found mine, his touch surprisingly gentle. "Actually, you did very well. Those recording devices you and Ruby set up? They'll be very useful."
Heat crept up my neck. "That was Ruby's idea - she's a reporter,remember?"
"Mm." His approval was subtle but clear. "She's a good friend to you."

When I started to getup, Brandon moved with that predatory grace that seemed to come naturally to him. He retrieved a pair of soft slippers,setting them precisely by my feet. "The floor's cold."  slightly, but his voice remained gentle. "It was a planned kidnapping attempt. But you were never in any real danger - I had people watching. We got you out immediately."
Something about the careful way he phrased it made me wonder what details he was leaving out. But before I could press further,my phone buzzed insistently.
I fumbled for it, realizing I should probably let Ruby know I was okay.Her sleepy voice answered on the third ring: "Who dares to call at this ungodly hour? Don't you know it's bad karma to wake people up?"
"Ungodly hour? It's almost noon, Ruby."
"Summer?" All traces of sleep vanished from her voice. "Oh my god, you finally called! Do you have any idea how worried I was when you disappeared?"
My throat tightened with emotion. "I'm fine! I'mn so sorry I worried you!"

"Thank god..." The relief in her voice made tears prick at my eyes."But why are you only calling now? I was up all night worrying! Only got to bed at 5AM!"
"Go back to sleep then!" Guilt twisted in my stomach. "I just woke up myself. Brandon mentioned you were worried..."
"No, no, I'm awake now," Her voice turned sharp with interest. "But how did Brandon rescue you? He wouldn't let me help look for you." "I'm not sure about the details myself, but I'm safe now." I caught Brandon watching me with that intense focus that never failed to make my skin prickle. "Let's meet for brunch?""Definitely!"

The smell of fresh coffee and warm croissants drew me downstairs after I hung up. Brandon had already arranged everything perfectly -fresh fruit,pastries, and what looked like an entire French café's worth of breakfast options.
"Smells amazing!" I couldn't help the enthusiasm in my voice.

"Hungry?" Brandon pulled out my chair with casual elegance. "Come eat."

I studied his face as I settled into my seat, noticing the slight smile that seemed to linger at the corners of his mouth. "You seem happy."

"Shouldn't I be?"
My fingers unconsciously went to my lips again. "Did something happen last night that I should know about?"
That dangerous half-smile widened. "Dear, don't you remember what you did?"
"I was unconscious!" Heat flooded my face. "I couldn't possibly remember!You must have done something!"
His low laugh sent shivers down my spine. "If that's what you think."

"I was unconscious," I tried to sound stern despite how my pulse raced,"so whatever you say must be true!"
Brandon's phone buzzed, interrupting whatever he'd been about to say.His expression shifted subtly as he answered. "What is it?" I could hear James's carefully professional tone through the speaker. "Am I interrupting,sir?" "Report." Brandon's voice carried that gentle authority as he turned to me."Drink your tea." The casual command made something warm unfurl in my chest.I sipped obediently, watching his expression turn to ice as Jamescontinued speaking.
"Sir, Dr. Sullivan has been... thorough. The suspect insists Victoria was behind this, but we traced two payments-one from Victoria, another from an untraceable offshore account."

Brandon's fingers drummed a dangerous rhythm against the table. "And?"

"The suspect's kneecaps are... no longer intact." James's voice carried clear discomfort. "Dr. Sullivan mentioned something about his pet sharks needing feeding."
I nearly choked on my tea. Brandon's hand found mine under the table,his thumb tracing gentle circles on my palm even as his voice turned arctic."I see."

The casual way he discussed violence while still holding my hand with such tenderness should have frightened me. Instead, I found myself leaning into his touch, grateful for the protection he represented. The memory of last night's terror felt distant now, like a bad dream that couldn't touch me anymore.
*Maybe that's what safety feels like,* I thought, watching Brandon's profile in the morning light. *Not the absence of danger, but knowing someone will always come for you.*
###Chapter 71: You Married Brandon Stark?

**Summer's POV**

"Is everything okay?" Brandon's expression softened instantly as he turned to me, though I could still sense the lethal intent simmering beneath the surface.

"Nothing to worry about."

"Let them feed the sharks if they want," Brandon's casual comment to James made my spoon clatter against the bowl. "As long as we get what we need."

James's professional mask cracked slightly as he fought back a smile. "Sir,we haven't even started yet. We're just... preparing to move."

Brandon's perfect brow furrowed slightly. "Have them wait. I'll handle it myself before passing things to Sean."

I watched James's slight flinch with fascination. Whatever storm was brewing in the financial world, it was clear Brandon's methods were particularly feared.

"Understood." James's efficiency never wavered. "I'll have Landon continue investigating that offshore account. About last night's drug analysis from the hotel room - it wasn't standard fare. Based on our investigation.Victoria wouldn't have access to something like this."

"Keep digging." Brandon's command carried absolute authority. I focused on pouring his coffee, trying to distract myself from the dark undercurrents of their conversation. A sudden sting made me pause as the cup's edge brushed against my finger. "What's wrong?" Brandon's voice carried immediate concern. "It's nothing," I examined the small cut with a frown. "Must have happened last night somehow."

"Does it still hurt?" The dangerous edge in his tone made me look up.

"I'm not that delicate," I managed a smile despite howmy skin prickled under his intense scrutiny.

"Brandon." I gathered my courage, meeting those dark eyes directly.


"Hmm?"

"Thank you for last night." The words came out softer than intended."And... I'd like you to meet my friends properly sometime."
"I don't have many friends - just Ruby and Scarlett. Ruby's the war correspondent,and Scarlett owns that coffee shop next to the St. Regis."
"I remember." His voice carried a hint of amusement. "Arrange whatever time works for you. I'm free whenever - I just don't want you feeling uncomfortable."

My eyes lit up at his consíderate response. "Great! I'll meet with Ruby and Scarlett today then," I said eagerly. "It's been so long since we've all gotten together."

"Good." Brandon nodded, his thoughts clearly turning to last night's events. "Take one of the cars." I'd arranged to meet Ruby and Scarlett for a long-overdue catch-up.Given how rarely we all managed to get together these days, we were determined to make the most of it. Scarlett had always been the quieter one of our group - it's wwhy we'd partnered to open the tea shop together. When she wasn't managing the shop,she could usually be found curled up with a book. Ruby, on the other hand, was our bundle of energy. Her vibrant personality made her perfect for her job as a reporter, constantly traveling across the country for stories.

Now that we were finally all together, we were determined to enjoy ourselves properly. As we bounced from store to store, the shopping bags multiplied - though most of them, I noticed with amusement, were things Ruby insistedon buying for me rather than herself.

"You're married now," Ruby declared, holding up another designer dress against me. "You need to dress the part!" I couldn't help rolling my eyes,though privately I didn't think there was anything wrong with my usual style.

"Summer, you're married?" Scarlett's soft voice held genuine shock as we browsed through the designer boutique. I could see the concern in her eyes - after all, she knew about what had happened with Alexander.

"It was pretty recent," I managed an awkward laugh, fidgeting with a dress sleeve. "Just a registration, no ceremony. I wasn't planning to tell anyone yet, but after everything that happened, Ruby found out first."
Catching Scarlett's worried expression, I gently tugged at her sleeve. "I know it seems sudden, but our relationship is... complicated.I've been trying to figure out the right time to introduce him to you both."

"Is he good to you?" Scarlett asked softly, her usual calm demeanor giving way to protective concern. "Oh my god, he's amazing!" Ruby bounced over, practically vibrating with excitement as she grabbed Scarlett's arm. "He's absolutely gorgeous,and you wouldn't believe how he treats Summer!" Scarlett rolled her eyes at Ruby before turning back to me. "Summer, I just want to make sure you're not rushing into this." "I understand your concern," I said softly. "But trust me, this isn't some impulsive decision. You'll understand when you meet him."

Something in Ruby's expression made me pause. "Wait - when exactly did you meet him? I don't remember introducing you."

Ruby's grin turned mischievous. "Remember last night when I couldn't find you? Brandon told me to head home, said he'd findyou himself. God,you should have seen how worried he was about you! And all those rumors-about Brandon Stark being cold and untouchable - clearly they've never seen him around you!"

"Brandon Stark?" Scarlett's eyes went wide. "You married Brandon Stark?"

"Shh!" I quickly glanced around, relieved to see no one had heard. "What happened to my calm, collected friend? You're as bad as Ruby today!"

Scarlett shot me an exasperated look. "Even I have my limits! This is Brandon Stark we're talking about - of course I'm going to be shocked!"

"She's right," Ruby nodded sagely. "I had the exact same reaction when I found out." She suddenly threw an arm around my shoulders. "Hey,since we're talking about introductions, why not today? It's the weekend,and who knows when your busy CEO husband will have free time again!"

"Now?" I hesitated, then pulled out my phone. "Well, let me at least call and check if he's free."

Ruby took the opportunity to snatch my phone, scrolling through my contacts. "Hold up - you saved him as... That's adorable!" "Let me guess," Scarlett's eyes danced with amusement, her shock giving way to teasing. "Is it 'Honey'? Or maybe 'Darling?" I shot Ruby a helpless look and took back my phone to call Brandon. It was only then that I noticed them - two men in impeccable suits who seemed to appear wherever we went. always maintaining a careful distance.At first I thought I was being paranoid. but they mnoved with too much purpose, their attention too focused despite their attempts at casualness.

*Brandon.* The realization hit me with surprising warmth rather than annoyance. Of course he'd arranged security after last night. The men were clearly professionals, hanging back far enough to give us privacy while keeping watch.I caught one of them speaking quietly into an earpiece, no doubt reporting to James.
###Chapter 72: Ironic Situation

**Summer's POV**
Brandon's phone answered on the first ring, but instead of his usual crisp greeting. I heard muffled sounds in the background that made my skín prickle. *What's that noise? A man's scream?* The ominous echoes reminded me that despite his gentle treatment of me, Brandon Stark was still one of the most feared men on Wall Street.

"June?" His deep voice was gentle. "Give me a moment."

I heard him moving, his footsteps echoing against what sounded like concrete. Through the phone, I heard a unfamiliar voice: "Mr. Stark."
"Results?" Brandon's voice remained perfectly controlled despite the ominous atmosphere I could sense even through the connection.
"He just wouldn't tell us more." James hesitated slightly. "But Dr. Sullivan's methods are proving effective."
"Hand him over to Sean then." The casual way Brandon discussed what was clearly an interrogation should have frightened me. Instead,I found myself grateful he'd answered despite clearly being in the middle of something important.

"About meeting my friends," I rushed to get the words out. "Would today work?"

Ruby's voice suddenly carried through the phone as she leaned close: "Mr.Stark! When are you treating us to dinner?"
I could hear the smile in Brandon's voice at the formal address. "Now works. Where would you like to go?"
"Well, we just finished shopping." I gestured frantically at Ruby to be quiet. "No rush," Ruby waved dismissively. "Let's shop a bit more. Unless..." Her eyes narrowed playfully, "Wait, he can't cook, can he? Summer, be careful "Ruby and Scarlett said they'd like to properly meet you. Since it's the weekend..."
"Perfect." His immediate response caught me off guard. "Any preferences for the restaurant?"
"You decide! It's not even dinner time yet, you don't have to rush-"

"Do your friends have anydietary restrictions?" The gentle concern in his tone made something warm unfurl in my chest.

"They're pretty easy-going,like me."
"So, Miss Scott," Brandon's voice carried clear amusement, "restaurant preference or...?"
Ruby snatched my phone before I could stop her. "Can we come to your place? We don't really care about the food - we just want to see where Summer lives now!"
"Of course." Brandon's agreement was immediate. "Have June bring you over."
After I hung up, Ruby turned to Scarlett wvith a triumphant grin. "Brandon's so agreeable! Who would've thought?"
"First impressions matter," Scarlett pointed out reasonably. "Of course he wants to make a good one."
"Plus we get to see their home!" Ruby bounced excitedly. "See how Brandon treats our Summer."or you'll end up being the housewife!"

"That makes no sense!" I couldn't help laughing.

Scarlett nodded thoughtfully. "Ruby has a point though. Let's browse a bit longer."



The drive to the Hamptons estate gave us plenty of time to talk. Ruby couldn't contain her amazement as we drove through the exclusive neighborhood.
"Oh my god, your husband has amazing taste! I heard Hamptons property prices are insane now - it's not even about affordability anymore, it's about availability!"
"Well, he is Brandon Stark," Scarlett mused. "Summer, how did you two meet anyway?"
I hesitated,carefully choosing my words. How could I explain the complex web of circumstances that had brought Brandon and me together? The memory of our first real meeting still made my heart skip - his quiet strength when I'd needed it most, the way he'd protected me without making me feel weak. "It's quite a coincidence actually." I smiled softly,lost in the memory. "He helped me when I was in trouble. Later I found out he was my grandfather's favorite student - remember that genius from Columbia I mentioned before?" *The same genius who now looks at me like I'm the most precious thing in his world,* I added silently. "Brandon Stark?" Ruby's eyes went wide. "No way! So you married him because he was your grandfather's student?" I explained the situation with the Taylor family, watching Ruby's expression darken with each detail.with indignation. "God, this is like a movie plot! But the Taylors are horrible - you're part of the family too!"
"Summer," Scarlett's gentle voice carried clear concern, "is this really what you want? I know the Taylors forced your hand, but your feelings for Brandon..."
I took a deepbreath, meeting her worried gaze in the rearview mirror. My fingers tightened on the steering wheel as I searched for the right words to explain how Brandon had become such an essential part of my life."Scarlett, I understand your concern." The warmth that filled my chest whenever I thought of him made my voice soften. "Love grows gradually-he treats me so well, and with someone as exceptional as Brandon,falling for him feels natural." *More natural than breathing sometimes,* I added silently, remembering how safe I felt in hisarms,how his mere presence could make the world feel right again.
"As long as you know what you're doing." Scarlett's expression softened."Don't handle everything alone - we're here for you."
"Absolutely!" Ruby declared. "Call us anytime. Though Summer,it's actually interesting."

"What do you mean?"
Ruby's grin turned wicked. "Didn't you say Alexander is just a distant relative of Brandon's? By family hierarchy, he'd have to call you 'Aunt'!Can you imagine Alexander and Victoria's faces when they find out you married Brandon? Once they're married, the whole family will have to bow to you and Brandon. God, that's satisfying just to think about!" "Maybe," I murmured, though the thought did bring a slight smile to my face.  "Victoria especially will be furious.Right.Scarlett?"
is pretty ironic. Alexander and Victoria Scarlett couldn't help laughing.′′It deserve some comeuppance after how they treated you. Let Brandon put them in their place!"
###Chapter 73:Was That You?


**Summer's POV**
"I can't believe how much you've changed!" I couldn't help laughing as Scarlett fired off another sharp-tongued observation about Manhattan's elite."Ruby's been a terrible influence on you!"
"What do you mean, terrible influence?" Ruby protested from the backseat of Brandon's Porsche, which I was carefully navigating through weekend traffic. "I'm a perfectly good influence!"
The familiar banter felt like college all over again, when we'd spend hours in our favorite coffee shop near Columbia, sharing dreamns and complaints.Now here we were, years later, headed to the Hamptons estate I shared with my... husband. The word still felt strange, even in my thoughts.
"Ruby..." I started, but she was on a roll.

"No. Summer, listen! Scarlett and I have had enough of watching these people hurt you. Just because they're your family doesn't give them the right to treat you like this! If it wvere me, I'd make sure they couldn't show their faces on Wall Street ever again!"
"Oh please," I couldn't help smiling despite the serious subject. "Remember when that guy stole your coffee in college? You ranted for hours but never actually confronted him!"
"That was different!" Ruby huffed, "I was saving my energy for more important battles!"

 A sleek, modified sports car suddenly roared past us, cutting so close I had to swerve slightly. The driver leaned out his window, waving mockingly before accelerating away. "What the hell?" Ruby surged forward between the front seats. "Who does that jerk think he is? Summer, catch up to him!"

"No way!" I kept my grip steady on the wheel. "I'm not that good a driver,and besides,we're almost there. No point picking fights with strangers."

"But didn't you see how smug he looked?" Ruby's voice rose with indignation.

"Maybe I was in his way?" I suggested mildly.

"You..." Ruby slumped back in her seat. "You're impossible! How can you be so calm about everything?"

The Hamptons estate came into view, its elegant facade gleaming in the afternoon sun. Ruby pressed her face against the window like an excited kid.

Ruby's eyes went wide as she took in the collection of luxury cars."Summer, I knew your husband was rich, but this is something else!"
Scarlett observed quietly, always the more practical one. "And look at the grounds - there's not another house in sight. Don't you find it lonely out here?"

"It is pretty big," I admitted, leading them toward the house."Here,guest slippers are this way."

The sound of voices from the kitchen made us all pause. A man's playful tone carried clearly: "Brandon, I haven't seen you cook in ages! Don't tell me you're doing all this just for me?"
I watched June lead her friends toward the living room, something warm and unfamiliar stirring in my chest at how naturally she moved through what had once been my solitary domain. The sound of their laughter floating back made the usually empty house feel different - alive in a way it hadn't been before. "Come on, brother, don't be like that! All this food can't just be for... oh." "Well, well," Sean's knowing voice from the doorway broke through my We roundedathe corner to find Dr. Sean grinning like a cat who'd found the cream. "Summer! You're back!" "Hello!" I greeted.

"If you need to be at the hospital, go." Brandon's sharp tone made Sean's grin widen. Then Brandon turned to me, his voice softening instantly: "You're home."

The contrast in his demeanor made something warm unfurl in my chest.

"Hey, Mr. Stark!" Ruby bounced forward before I could stop her."Remember me from last night? I'm Ruby, Summer's friend, and this is Scarlett!"

Brandon acknowledged them with a polite nod. "Welcome."

Brandon took theshopping bags from my hands. "You must be tired.Why don't you show your friends to the living room? Dinner will be ready soon." He turned to Ruby and Scarlett, his usual intimidating presence softening slightly. "Please make yourselves comfortable."
Ruby waved off his concern. "Don't worry about us - we'll take care of ourselves,right Summer?"

I squeezed Brandon's arm gently. "Go finish what you were doing.I'll keep them company."




Brandon's POV
thoughts. "You're really serious about this, aren't you?"

I continued preparing dinner, not bothering to look up. "When have I ever not been serious?"

"Look," his voice lost its usual playful edge. "I probably don't have any right to say this, but... don't let her down, okay? Not when she's finally starting to trust you."

"I know what I'm doing."

Sean's soft laugh held no humor. "You know how it is for people like us on Wall Street. Real feelings? That's rarer than unicorns."

"Sean." I finally turned to face him. "I'm not like you. I've never been like you. You know that."

"Yeah." His expression softened as we heard another burst of laughter from the living room. "You're different. And it looks like she's accepting you-bringing her best friends to meet you? That's a pretty big step."

I studied his face, noting the unusual seriousness in his bearing. "What else?"

He produced a medical report from his jacket. "About the drug they used on your wife last night... I ran the analysis myself. It's a controlled substance, very rare. Victoria wouldn't have access to something like this on her own. She might just be the front for someone else."

"You're sure?" I examined the report carefully. "You doubting my professional skills now?" His mock offense couldn't quite hide his concern. "Just... be careful, okay? Keep Summer safe."I filed the information away for later consideration. "I know." I could hear the laughter spilling from the living room as June's friend Ruby recounted their Columbia days. The usually formal space felt different somehow, warmed by their easy camaraderie and June's soft responses.

"And then Summer actually got the professor to change his mind!" Ruby's enthusiasm carried clearly through the open doorway. "She was so quiet usually,but when she believed in something..."

"Speaking of belief," Sean's voice held that particular note of mischief that usually-preceded trouble, "what's got three beautiful ladies laughing so hard?"

"This Dr. Sean Sullivan." June introduced.

"Please, call me Sean." His natural charm shifted smoothly into place."Though I have to ask - was that you in the Porsche earlier? The one that wouldn't race?"

Ruby's voice sharpened with recognition. "Wait, that fancy sports car outside is yours? So you were the one trying to provoke us?"

"Ah, about that..." Even without looking, I could picture Sean's sheepish expression. "I lost that car to Brandon in a bet. Thought he might be driving it and wanted to mess with him a bit. My bad!"

"The commute to the office is pretty far," June explained, and I could hear the smile in her voice. My fingers paused briefly in their work,remembering how naturally she'd adapted to driving the Porsche. I smiled at his concern, nodding in acceptance while adjusting the heat."Okay. But what exactly was I drugged with? I can't remember anything about it." My brain finally caught up with the events of the past twenty-four hours."Wait... Victoria..." "Just a misunderstanding then." The soft rustle of movement suggested June rising. "I should go help Brandon with the dinner!" I frowned, turning the burner to low as instructed, Something wasn't quite right with this whole scenario.
###Chapter 74: Victoria's Scandal

**Summer's POV**

I slipped quietly into the gleaming kitchen, pausing at the threshold to take in the unexpected sight. Brandon stood at the stove, his movements precise and efficient as he tossed ingredients into a sizzling pan.

He sensed my presence without turning, his hands never stopping their work. After a moment, he glanced over his shoulder, dark eyes finding mine with unerring accuracy. "Why aren't you sitting with your friends?"

"We're all just sitting there while you're doing all the work," I replied,stepping further into the kitchen. My eyes tracked his movements, noticing how methodical he was even with something as mundane as cooking.Each motion was deliberate, nothing wasted. "Need any help?"

His hands paused briefly over the pan, and I caught the slight lift of his eyebrow before he nodded. "Check the soup. I had it on high heat earlier.Turn it down to low now."

"Sure." I moved to the stove, lifting the lid of a large pot. An incredible aroma wafted up, making my stomach rumble appreciatively. "Wow, that smells amazing. What kind of soup is this?"

"Bone broth," Brandon replied, his attention back on the vegetables he was sautéing. "You were drugged yesterday. There's likely still some residue in your system. The soup will help flush it out." I returned to the living room to find Ruby and Dr. Sean setting up what looked like an intense card game, with Scarlett observing from the sidelines. "Full house!" Ruby declared triumphantly, laying down her cards. Dr. Sean's smile widened as he revealed his own hand. "Four of a kind.I believe that's another win for me." on's face for clues.
Brandon raised an eyebrow, looking almost amused by my question. "You're awfully slow on the uptake. Only now you're asking?"
"Well, you did say I was drugged," I reminded him, biting my lip. "My brain's still a bit foggy."
After adjusting the heat under the soup, I leaned against the counter,watching Brandon work. There was something hypnotic about his movements - the careful precision, the fluid grace. Even doing something as ordinary as cooking, he commanded attention.
I tapped my fingers against the countertop, mimicking his characteristic gesture. "You said you rescued me yesterday. But what about Victoria?With her personality, if she didn't get what she wanted, she'd definitely come after me again. But it's been a whole day with no news from her."
Brandon's lips curved slightly, a dangerous half-smile playing at the corners of his mouth. "Isn't that a good thing? Or do you actually enjoy being tormented by her?"

"That's not what I meant!" I protested, feeling heat creep into my cheeks.

"You should go rest," he said smoothly, effectively changing the subject. "I can handle this. And stop worrying about them. They can't hurt you anymore." Ruby's jaw dropped in disbelief. "How? That's, like,the fifth time in a row!"

Scarlett sat nearby, watching their competition with barely concealed amusement. Her own face was suspiciously free of the paper strips that covered Ruby's forehead and cheeks -remnants of our college drinking game that Ruby had apparently revived for this occasion.

"That's it!" Ruby finaly exclaimed, throwing her cards down in frustration."You're cheating! There's no way you could win every single round!"

Dr. Sean raised an eyebrow, looking comically innocent. "Miss Scott, I'm playing completely fair. It's hardly my fault if your poker skills aren't quite up to par."

"You..." Ruby bristled, then ripped the paper strips from her face with a dramatic flourish. "I'm done. I quit!"
Dr. Sean spread his hands in a placating gesture. "A true gentleman never pushes a lady too far." But the twinkle in his eyes betrayed his enjoyment of her frustration.

Ruby huffed,grabbing the remote control and switching on the television,clearly looking for a distraction from her defeat. She flipped through several channels before coming to an abrupt stop, her expression shifting from annoyance to shock.

"Holy shit!" she exclaimed, turning up the volume. "Summer, isn't that your sister?" On screen, Victoria's usually perfect composure was nowhere to be seen.Her face was twisted with panic as she fled from a crowd of reporters,their questions overlapping in an unintelligible cacophony. The headline at the bottom of the screen read: "Rising Star Victoria Taylor's Career Built on Casting Couch Scandals?"7% "What the hell?" Ruby breathed, already pulling out her phone to search for more information. "Talk about karma!"
Scarlett leaned forward, eyes wide with disbelief as she read over Ruby's shoulder. "Oh my god, it's everywhere. Every entertainment site has this as their lead story."
Dr. Sean watched their reactions with keen interest, his eyes narrowing slightly as they flicked toward the kitchen. Something in his expression suggested he wasn't entirely surprised by this turn of events.
Ruby scrolled through her phone, reading aloud: "Victoria Taylor,recently engaged to Alexander Stark, has been exposed for systematically sleeping her way to the top... Multiple sources confirm... Photos show her leaving director Jonathan Miller's hotel room at 3 AM..." She looked up,incredulous. "There are pictures! Actual pictures!"
"No wonder Summer could never win against her," Scarlett said quietly."Victoria's been playing a completely different game all along."
My eyes widened, and I had to reread them to make sure I wasn't hallucinating. "When did this happen?"
Ruby's expression turned triumphant. "Just today! The entertainment industry can be brutal - one minute you're on top, the next you're being destroyed on every platform. Look, it's been what, a few hours? And Victoria's already trending on Twitter, Instagram, everywhere!"
"I had no idea Victoria was this... calculating," Scarlett added, her normally gentle voice hardened with disapproval. "Who broke the story?" I asked, scrolling through article after article. Each one seemed more damning than the last, with quotes from "inside sources"detailing Victoria's manipulative climb through Hollywood. Ruby shrugged,""No idea. Twitter's full of people claiming they always knew she was fake, Apparently, she's made a lot of enemies along the way- sabotaging other actresses, spreading rumors. Maybe one of her victims finally decided to get even."




"Are you crazy?" Ruby snatched the phone from my hands before I could dial. "What are you thinking? Victoria brought this on herself! If you call the Taylors now, what do you think they'll assume? That youI're gloating?That you're behind this somehow?"
"Miss Scott is absolutely right," Dr. Sean chimed in, his expression uncharacteristically serious. "The entertainment industry is a complex ecosystem. As outsiders, it's best if we stay clear of the fallout."
"Exactly!" Ruby nodded vigorously. "Victoria's been playing dirty for years.There must be dozens of people who'd love to see her fall. Consider this cosmic justice - she's finally getting what she deserves for how she's treated you."
Brandon appeared in the doorway, carrying a large serving platter. "Dinner's ready.Come eat."
"Great!" I smiled gratefully, tucking my phone away and letting the subject drop.As we headed to the dining room, I couldn't help wondering what Brandon thought about Victoria's sudden public downfa11. His face had revealed nothing, but something in the calculating depth of his eyes made me wonder if he knew more than he was letting on. After all, nothing in Brandon Stark's world happened by coincidence - especially not when it involved someone who had harmed me.
###Chapter 75: Seeking the Starks' Help


**Victoria's POV**
My trembling fingers scrolled through yet another scathing headline:"Victoria Taylor: Hollywood's Newest Fraud Exposed!" I threw my phone across the bedroom, watching with grim satisfaction as it bounced off my silk pillows. The sound wasn't nearly as satisfying as glass shattering against the wall-like the vase I'd destroyed yesterday, or the crystal decanter from the day before.
"Miss Victoria?" A timid knock at the door. "Would you like some breakfast?"
"Get the fuck away from my door!" I screamed, hurling a designer shoe at the wooden panel. The thud was followed by hurried footsteps retreating down the hall.
I collapsed onto my bed, curling into a fetal position as tears burned behind my eyelids.

My phone buzzed again from somewhere in the bedding.

And those photos... God, those photos. The ones my PR team had assured me were destroyed years ago. I'd been young, desperate, and stupid. Now they were everywhere.
I scrolled through my contacts, desperate for anyone who might help. My agent's calls went straight to voicemail after he'd delivered the news yesterday: "Take some time off, Victoria. We'll reassess when this blows over." Translation: you're toxic, and we're cutting you loose.

 "This is fucking insane," I whispered to my empty room, voice cracking from hours of screaming and crying. "Who would do this to me?"

 My phone buzzed with an email notification: *Dear Ms. Taylor,*
*In light of recent events, Luminous Cosmetics regrets to inform you that we must terminate our contract effective immediately. As per section 12.3of our agreement regarding moral turpitude clauses...*
I didn't bother reading the rest. That was the fifth brand to drop me in three days.
A sob tore from my throat as I hurled my phone at the mirror, watching my reflection splinter into a thousand pieces. The crash brought an immediate pounding on my door.
"Victoria!" My mother's voice, sharp with concern. "Open this door right now!"

"Go away!" I screamed back, my voice raw.

"Victoria, darling, please!" The doorknob rattled.

I collapsed onto the floor amidst the shattered glass, too exhausted to fight anymore. "It's open," I finally called out.
Mom rushed in, her perfectly manicured hand flying to her mouth at the sight of me surrounded by broken glass. "Oh my God, Victoria! What have you done?"
"What have *I* done?" I laughed bitterly. "I didn't do anything! Someone is trying to destroy me!" Her eyes swept over the destruction of my room-the overturned furniture,shattered glass, clothes strewn everywhere. For three days, I'd refused to let the staff clean, preferring to wallow in the physical manifestation of my ruined life. "You can't stay like this," she said firmly, stepping carefully through the debris. "Look at yourself."
I caught a glimpse in what remained of my mirror-mascara streaked down hollow cheeks, unwashed hair clinging to my scalp, designer pajamas wrinkled and stained. I barely recognized myself.
Mom's face twisted with a mixture of heartbreak and frustration. "How long are you going to keep acting like this? Look at yourself!" She gestured wildly at my disheveled appearance. "You've barely eaten anything for two days. You break whatever the staff brings you. What's the point of all this?
"1
The concern in her voice broke through the numbness that had been my only protection. Tears welled up and spilled over before I could stop them.
"But Mom, what am I supposed to do? My career is over!" The words caught in my throat, choking me. "The agency says I should 'take a break,'but I know they're just dumping me. All those brands are canceling my contracts." My voice cracked with desperation. "Mom, who would do this to me?"
"I worked so hard to become a star," I whispered, clutching at her sleeves like a child. "I can't let my career end like this! Mom, please help me!"
I watched her face closely, panic rising as I saw the uncertainty in her eyes.Mom's brow furrowed as she seemed to mentally sort through her options.For the first time, I realized she might not have an immediate answer.The thought was terrifying. "Mom, don't you love me anymore?" The words came out childish and desperate. "Are you just going to watch while someone destroys me?" Her expression hardened at that, her spine straightening. "How could you say that? Of course I love you!" She pulled me into her arms, stroking my tangled hair..05You're my only daughter that matters.I'd do anything for you. There is a solution, but..."

Hope flared in my chest, bright and desperate. "But what?" I grabbed her hands, squeezing them tightly. "Mom, I knew you'd have a plan. What is it?"

Mom's eyes met mine, calculating. "What about Alexander? Have you forgotten him?"

"Alexander?" The name felt strange on my tongue. In the chaos of the past few days, I'd barely thought about my fiancé.
*Oh God, Alexander.* Had he seen the headlines? The photos? The accusations? Panic clawed at my throat. What if the Stark family decided I was too much of a liability? The engagement had never just been about love-it was a business arrangement too, a way to secure my family's standing with my shares in Capital Corp.
My fingers dug into Mom's arms with bruising force, my nails leaving half-moon imprints in her skin. She winced, drawing in a sharp breath.

"Victoria! What are you doing?" Her voice was tight with pain.

I released her immediately, summoning the expression that had won me my first movie role-wide eyes, trembling lower lip, the perfect picture of vulnerability. "Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. It's just...Alexander hasn't even called to check on me.I..." Mom's expression suddenly shifted, the slight narrowing of her eyes indicating she'd just had an idea. "Do you remember that important guest at your grandfather's birthday party?" The question seemed odd, disconnected from our conversation. "Mom, you mean...Brandon Stark?" "Exactly." Her eyes gleamed wih purpose. "Isn't Alexander related to Brandon? If Brandon Stark helps us, your problems will disappear overnight!"
But I remembered our last encounter-how he'd looked straight through me, pretending not to even know who I was. The memory stung. My brief moment of hope deflated.
"But that Brandon Stark is so awful," I began, the complaint automatic. "He-"
"Do you want to salvage your career or not?" Mom cut me off sharply,her voice like a whip.

I flinched at her tone.
"If you want to stay in Hollywood, sometimes you need to swallow your pride," she continued, her eyes hard. "Besides, if our family connects with Brandon Stark, your father wouldn't need to beg the Windsors for anything."
I knew what she wasn't saying. The Windsors had pulled their investment after that disaster with Summer at Grandpa's birthday party. No one on Wall Street would touch Taylor family businesses now. Dad had been locked in his study for days, making desperate calls to save Capital Corp.

But still...Brandon Stark? The man intimidated me in a way few people ever had. There was something in those cold eyes that made me feel transparent, like he could see through every calculated move I'd ever made. If he'd been so dismissive before, why would he help me now? Unless...Alexander could convince him. After all,they were family,even if distant. I needed to believe this would work. "Alexander and Brandon must be
close. right? Alexander and Brandon will definitely help me!"

Mom's smile was triumphant. "Of course he will. You're gorgeous, darling.Any man would fall for you!"
###Chapter 76: You're Both Starks

**Victoria's POV**

Taking a deep breath, I dialed Alexander's number.

Alexander picked up on the fourth ring, his voice distracted. "Hello?"

"Alex, are you busy?" I made sure my tone was light and airy, with just the right touch of sweetness.

There was a pause. "Um, yes, I have some work. What's up?"

Perfect opportunity. "I'm actually right outside Fortune Corp! I brought lunch for you," I glanced down at the empty space beside me where an imaginary lunch would be. *I'll pick something up on the way.* "Can I come up and see you?"

"Victoria..." He sounded exhausted. "I'm in the middle of something-"

"Alex," I injected a slight tremble into my voice, "I know this week has been crazy. I've been... struggling. Ijust need to see you, even for a minute."I bit my lower lip hard enough to make my eyes water, though of course he couldn't see that through the phone. The emotion in my voice was real enough,though.

He sighed heavily. "Fine. You can come up."

"You're the best! I'll be there in twenty." I hung up before he could change his mind. I walked through the imposing glass doors of Fortune Corp, holding a perfectly arranged meal in an elegant white box. The security guard recognized me immediately - not surprising, given how often my face had been splashed across entertainment news this week. "Miss Taylor," he nodded, trying not to stare.

As I waited for the elevator, I became acutely aware of the whispers around me. Office workers pretended to be occupied with their phones while stealing glances in my direction.

"That's her-Victoria Taylor..."

"Didn't you see the photos? She totally slept her way..."

"I heard she sabotaged that actress from the Netflix show..."

My fingers tightened around the lunch box handle until my knuckles turned white. *Fucking vultures.*

The elevator doors opened, revealing a mercifully empty car. I stepped inside, my smile dropping the instant the doors closed. *Just breathe,
Victoria. Remember why you're here.

Alexander was hunched over his desk when I entered, surrounded by stacks of papers. His usually immaculate appearance was slightly rumpled - tie loosened, hair mussed as if he'd been running his hands through it repeatedly. He glanced up briefly as I walked in.

"Alex!" I infused my voice with warmth. "Look what I brought you!"I held up the Jean-Georges bag.

He barely looked at it. "You can set it down. I need to finish these reports first." "Sure!" I studied him as he worked, noting the dark circles under his eyes and the tension in his shoulders. The scandal had hit him too,though not nearly as hard as me. The Stark name had shielded him somewhat, but I'd heard whispers that his family was pressuring him to reconsider our engagement. *Not a chance." I needed this marriage more than ever now. The Taylor name had taken enough hits lately- I needed the stability and protection of becoming a Stark.

After fifteen excruciating minutes. Alexander finally closed the file he'd been reviewing andI set down his pen with deliberate precision.

I leapt to my feet immediately, rushing over to the side table to pour him a glass of water from the crystal decanter. I handed it to him with a demure smile, then grabbed a tissue from the box on his desk and offered it to him.

"Here,wipe your hands before you eat," I said, already unpacking the gourmet lunch. The containers released mouthwatering aromas as I arranged everything perfectly, setting out the silverware with practiced grace.

"Alex, you must be starving," I smiled warmly. "I specifically ordered from Jean-Georges-your favorite!"

Alexander's gaze sharpened, a slight frown creasing his brow as he looked from the food to me.

My heart skipped uncomfortably. "What? Don't you like it? Is something wrong?"

He shook his head slowly. "No, it's fine. I'm just surprised to see you here,that's all. You usually avoid office visits- something about paparazzi and being photographed in the same outfit twice," *Shit.* I'd forgotten I'd used that excuse before. I forced alight laugh.11People change, don't they? Can't a girl do something nice for her fiancé?" I leaned forward slightly, letting my blouse gap just enough to be distracting. "Don't you like me being thoughtful?" Alexander's eyes didn't drop to my cleavage as expected. Instead, he maintained uncomfortable eye contact. "Of course I do. Thank you."

He picked up a fork and took a small bite. "How are you feeling? Better today?”

This was my opening. I lowered my eyes, letting vulnerability show on my face. "Alex," I began softly, wringing my hands in my lap. "You love me.don't you?"

His hand paused halfway to his mouth, his expression guarded. "Yes. Why do you ask?"

I reached across the table, grasping his free hand between both of mine.I could feel him tense at the contact, but I held on tighter. "Alex, if you love me, you'll help me, right? I have nowhere else to turn. I'm *begging* you."

Alexander set down his fork with a soft clink, his appetite visibly gone. "What exactly do you want me to do, Victoria?"

*Here goes nothing.*

"You're close with Brandon, aren't you? You're both Starks!"I leaned forward eagerly. "That man who gave Grandpa that priceless chess set at his birthday party. He's incredibly influential, isn't he? I heard he owns a media company. Could you possibly..."

Alexander's expression darkened, his jaw tightening visibly. He pulled his hand from my grasp.I didn't notice his reaction, too caught up in my desperate plan. "Alex, you and Brandon Stark are relatives, right? Couldn't you ask him to help me weather this storm? Just one word from him, and I could make a comeback in the entertainment industry. Alex, I know you care about me.Please help me!" "But-" Alexander started, his voice tight.

"But what?" I didn't let him finish, switching to my most vulnerable expression-wide eyes, slightly trembling lower lip. "Don't you want to help me? I know I brought some of this on myself. But those photos and stories-they're mostly taken out of context! Yes, I had some conflicts with production teams, but that was just me fighting for better roles! I haven't done anything truly terrible. Someone's clearlyout to get me. Alex, please!"

Alexander looked genuinely pained. "I..."

Before he could finish, the door swung open. Alexander's father strode in confidently, his sharp eyes taking in the scene instantly.

"This matter is settled," he announced without preamble. "Alex will speak with Brandon about this!"

"Dad-" Alexander tried to interject.

His father silenced him with a stern look. "Victoria, don't worry about a thing. Alex will help you. And I'm certain Brandon will offer his assistance as well!"

"But Dad," Alexander protested weakly. "Brandon and I aren't exactly-"

"She's your fiancée," his father cut in harshly. "Her reputation affects our family name now. Besides, I'm sure Victoría is the victim of a smear campaign. What kind of man stands by while his future wife is attacked?The decision is made." I could have kissed the old man. Instead, I gave him my most grateful smile. "Thank you so mauch, sir. I really appreciate your support."*Perfect. With old Mr. Stark on my side, Alexander would have to help me. And once Brandon Stark got involved, my problems would disappear overnight. I'd be back on magazine covers in no time. Everything was going according to plan
###Chapter 77: Victoria's Lifeline

**Brandon's POV**

My hand paused mid-signature as I heard the expected footsteps approaching my office. I glanced up, a small smile playing at my lips. "He's here already? Sooner than I anticipated."

"Sir, your foresight continues to amaze me," James remarked,standing at attention by my desk. "Though I must admit, I'm surprised Alexander actually had the nerve to show up"

I allowed myself a brief, cold smile. "Even if his pride objects, his father would find a way to make him come."

James nodded, understanding perfectly. "And now, sir?"

"Send him up." I signed the last document with a flourish. "And make sure the team knows I'ma only giving them one year on this project. The first phase needs to launch immediately."

"Of course, sir." James collected the papers efficiently. "I'll have him sent up right away."

Alexander was escorted to my office by one of the junior assistants, his expression carefully composed though I could see the tension in his shoulders. This was his first time on the executive floor of Stark Tower-a privilege he hadn't earned before and likely wouldn't again. He stepped inside, immediately adopting a smile that didn't reach his eyes."Uncle Brandon." The familial address was a transparent attempt to establish connection-to remind me of our blood ties, distant as they might be. Each syllable seemed to cost him, the forced respect clearly burning his pride.I could almost taste his resentment. "What brings my nephew to visit today?" I asked, my tone deliberately neutral, emphasizing our familial relationship and the implicit power dynamic. Each word was carefully chosen to remind him of his place-beneath me in every hierarchy that mattered.

"Uncle Brandon," he began, the words clearly leaving a bitter taste in his mouth. "Ill be direct. I've come to ask for your assistance with a somewhat delicate matter."

I lifted an eyebrow, feigning interest while inwardly enjoying his discomfort. Every moment in my presence was clearly torture for him-good. After what he'd done to June, this was the least he deserved.

"Go on," I said.

Alexander took a deep breath. "Do you remember George Taylor's birthday celebration a while back?"

I nodded once. "I do." The memory of finding June drugged and vulnerable that night made my jaw tighten imperceptibly. "Why bring that up now?"

"Well, you may have heard that I recently got engaged to Mr. Taylor's granddaughter," he continued, fidgeting slightly. "Victoria Taylor-she was standing beside me that evening. The Taylor family's eldest daughter."

"I see," I responded, my expression revealing nothing while inwardly savoring what was coming. "I don't recall." Alexander's face stiffened noticeably, He clearly hadn't expected such a dismissive response, especially regarding someone as recognizable as Victoria. His confidence wavered visibly,but he pressed on."Victoria works in the entertainment industry," he explained,his voice strained."It2Sa cutthroat business, full of unsavory characters. Recently,she's become the target of a rather vicious online smear campaign. She's the victim here, being attacked by-"

"Get to the point," I interrupted, pinching the bridge of my nose. "What does this have to do with me?"

Alexander straightened, sensing my waning patience. "I know Stark Group owns a film production company. I was hoping you might... help Victoria.These attacks could destroy her career."

"Ah, now I understand." I pressed the intercom button. "James, come in for a moment."

Every cell in my body wanted to throw him out of my office, to make him suffer for how he'd betrayed June. But patience was required here.Victoria's current troubles were just the beginning-I had far more comprehensive plans for both of them.

James entered promptly, nodding politely to Alexander. "You needed me,

sir?"

"We own a film production company, correct?" I asked, though we both knew I was perfectly aware of every asset under my control.

"Yes, sir," James confirmed, seamlessly following my lead. "I've been overseeing it on your behalf." I turned back to Alexander, noting how he struggled to maintain eye contact. Asking for my help clearly cost him his pride, especially given the barely concealed hatred he felt toward me. The fact that his father had forced him into this meeting for Victoria's shares in the Capital Corp made it all the sweeter. "There you have it. James manages our entertainment division. Whatever you need, discuss the details with him. He has my full authority in these matters." The momentaryflash of disappointment on Alexander's face was telling-he'd hoped to establish a direct connection with me, not be pawned off to my assistant. Nevertheless, he recognized the offer for what it was: a grudging concession.

"Thank you, Uncle," he said, each word clearly painful to pronounce. "I appreciate your help."

"Of course," I replied, waving toward the door. "James will take care of everything."

As they left, I allowed myself a small smile. Let Alexander think he'd won a victory-it would make the eventual lesson all the more effective.Let him go back to Victoria with good news, let them celebrate this small reprieve.

After several minutes, James returned alone, his expression hesitant, as though wrestling with an unasked question.

I raised an eyebrow. "Something on your mind?"

James nodded, choosing his words carefully. "I don't quite understand your strategy, sir. We have enough damaging information on Victoria to completely destroy her career. Why offer her a role at all? Why not simply release everything at once and be done with her?"

His confusion was reasonable. James had worked with me long enough to know my usual approach to enemies-swift, decisive, and without mercy.This more measured response clearly puzzled him. I allowed myself a cold smile. "Killing her career outright would be too merciful, don't you think?" I swirled the bourbon in my glass,watching the amber liquid catch the light. "No, I prefer a different approach. Build her up first. Let her climb to the very pinnacle, taste what real success feels like." I leaned back in my chair, setting down the untouched drink. "Then, when she's at her highest point, when she believes herself untouchable... that's when we pull the rug out. The fall from such heights isn't just devastating-it's obliterating. She won't just be ruined; she'll be shattered beyond repair."

James couldn't quite suppress a shiver. "I see,sir."

"Gradually direct our best resources her way," I instructed. "But first,have her terminate her current contracts. I want her fully under our control."

James looked surprised. "You want the production company to sign Victoria Taylor?"

I nodded. "If she craves the spotlight so badly, let's give it to her." My lips curved into a dangerous smile. "Let her learn that being the center of attention can quickly turn into being the target of everyone's disgust."

"But sir, we've only offered her a supporting role. Will she even accept?"

"She will," I said with absolute certainty. "People like Victoria, with that kind of ambition? They never refuse an opportunity, no matter how small.She's desperate now-she'll grab any lifeline we throw her."

"Very well, sir. I'll see to the arrangements."
###Chapter 78: Brandon's Signing Victoria?

**Summer's POV**

"Organic or non-organic?" I held up two perfectly identical bunches of spinach, watching Brandon's expression for guidance. The high-end supermarket's lighting made everything look unnaturally perfect, but I still couldn't teIl the difference between the thirty-dollar greens and their fifteen-dollar counterparts.

Brandon paused his methodical selection of tomatoes to glance over. "Whichever you prefer."

"That's not helpful," I complained, dropping both bunches intoour cart."You're the food expert here. I've been eating takeout for the past three years."

The corner of his mouth lifted in that dangerous half-smile that never failed to make my pulse skip. "Is that so? I thought Fortune Corp had a company cafeteria."

"Yeah, with food that tastes like cardboard." I wrinkled my nose,wandering over to examine a display of artisanal pastas.

His phone buzzed as we reached the wine section. That familiar crease appeared between his brows as he read the message.

"Problem?" I asked, already recognizing the look. "Just something I need to handle." He tucked the phone away,his expression smoothing over. "I can finish this later." I shook my head firmly. "No need. I'll finish up here. You do what you need to do." Those dark eyes studied my face with that unsettling intensity. "You sure?" "Positive." I gave him a small push toward the exit. "Go handle your business empire. I'll make dinner tonight."

Brandon raised one perfect eyebrow. "You can cook?"

"Don't look so surprised!" I crossed my arms defensively. "I'm not a complete disaster in the kitchen."

His lips twitched with barely suppressed amusement. "I'll look forward to it. But don't overdo it - just one or two dishes is fine."

"Are you worried I'll burn down your fancy kitchen?" I challenged,fighting a smile.

Brandon leaned down, his breath warmn against my ear. "No, I'm worried you'll exhaust yourself trying to impress me."

Heat flooded my cheeks as he straightened up. "Just go already! I'll see you at home."

\---

Three hours later, I surveyed the kitchen with a mix of pride and exhaustion. Despite Brandon's advice, I'd gotten carried away,preparing a spread that could easily feed six people instead of two. My grandmother's recipes had come flooding back once I started cooking - comfort foods that reminded me of happier times. After setting the table, I headed upstairs to find Brandon. His study door stood ajar, but the room was empty. I frowned, checking the time.He'd mentioned having things to handle, but I'd expected him back by now. My attention caught on a folder lying open on his desk - unusual for Brandon, who typically maintained meticulous order in his workspace.Without thinking, I picked it up, my eyes scanning the top page. *Stark Entertainment Group-Talent Contract-Victoria Taylor*

My brow furrowed as I flipped through the pages, each one detailing extensive terms for what appeared to be a significant role at Brandon's entertainment company. A company I hadn't even known he owned.

"Find something interesting?"

I nearly jumped out of my skin, the folder dropping from my hands.Brandon stood in the doorway, his expression unreadable as he approached.

"Ask whatever you want to ask." His voice was surprisingly gentle as he retrieved the fallen documents.

I swallowed hard, organizing my thoughts. "You're signing Victoria? I mean. I didn't even know you had an entertainment company."

Brandon slipped the papers from my fingers, his thumb brushing against my wrist in a touch that seemed more deliberate than accidental. "Is that what you came up here for? To snoop through my business affairs?"

"No! I came to tell you dinner's ready." I felt heat creeping up my neck. "The documents were just... there."

"I see." His dark eyes held mine for a long moment. "Ready to head down?

"

I nodded, then hesitated. "If you don't want to tell me about it, that's fine."

 Brandon's unexpected laugh caught me off guard. His hand  reached out,fingers ruffling my hair with casual intimacy."Hey!" I protested, trying to smooth the sudden disarray. "Don't mess up my hair!" His expression softened with something that looked suspiciously like affection. "You know, for someone who's usually so even-tempered, you can be quite rebellious."

"I'm not being rebellious," I huffed, still attempting to fix my hair."And that's not even the right word. Do you even know how to use vocabulary properly?"

"Apparently not," he conceded, though the amusement in his eyes belied any real contrition.

As we headed toward the stairs, Brandon's hand found mine, our fingers intertwining with a naturalness that still surprised me.

"About that entertainment company," he said casually. "It was an investment from a few years back. James and his team handle the day-to-day operations. I rarely get involved directly."

I glanced up at him, curiosity piqued. "So why are you getting involved with Victoria?"

His grip tightened slightly. "Alexander came to see me. Victoria sent him to ask for my help."

A strange conflict churned inside me~ deep down, I trusted Brandon,believed in the connection we'd built these past weeks. The safety and care he'd shown me were real; that much I knew with certainty. But Victoria had been tormenting me for years, had nearly gotten me assaulted at Grandpa's party, had stolen my fiancé and tried to drug me. Why would Brandon, who'd protected me from all that, suddenly extend a helping hand to the person who'd caused me so much pain? It didn't make sense. "And you said yes?" I couldn't keep the disbelief from my voice. "You know what she did to me, yet you're helping her?"
###Chapter 79: A Stroke of Anger

**Summer's POV**

Brandon's thumb traced a soothing pattern across my knuckles. "Trust me.Let's eat first- I have something to show you later."

The spread I'd prepared covered almost the entire dining table-roasted vegetables, pan-seared fish, pasta with homemade sauce, a fresh salad, and even a small dessert.

Brandon paused at the doorway, one eyebrow lifting. "I thought I said one or two dishes."

I bit my lip, suddenly uncertain. "Is it too much? I..."

"It looks incredible," he said,his voice softening. "Thank you."

As we settled at the table, I couldn't hold back anymore. "The Victoria scandal was your doing, wasn't it?"

Brandon's hand stilled momentarily as he reached for his water glass.Then his lips curved into that dangerous half-smile.

"I couldn't just stand by and do nothing," he admitted. "You're my wife.When someone hurts you, they deal with me. That's how it works."

Something warm unfurled in my chest at his straightforward declaration."But why help her now? And why would Alexander even come to you?From what I know about him, he's too proud. He never seemed to like you much, even though you're both Starks." "My wife is quite perceptive." Brandon nodded approvingly. "You're right about Alexander. We've never been close - different branches of the family,different circumstances growing up." His expression turned contemplative."But Victoria'sshares in Capital Corp are valuable enough for Alexander to
set aside his ego. And his father is particularly ambitious."

I nodded slowy, absorbing his explanation. "I understand. Do whatever you think is best. I trust your judgment."

Brandon shifted closer, taking my hand and placing it on his knee. His fingers gently tilted my face toward his, until we were barely inches apart.My heart hammered against my ribs as I instinctively tried to look away,but he held me steady.

"Trust me?" he asked, his voice dropping to that velvet-soft tone.

I nodded, unable to form words with him so close. "I do."

His smile widened slightly, genuine warmth replacing his usual reserve."
Good. Now let's eat before all your hard work gets cold."

Dinner passed pleasantly, with Brandon complimenting each dish in his understated way. When I stood to clear the plates, he caught my wrist.
"Ill handle this. Household duties should be shared between spouses, don't you think?"

I blinked in surprise, not expecting such domestic equality from someone like Brandon Stark. Warmth spread through me as I watched him efficiently stack the dishes and carry them to the kitchen.

My phone's sudden ring shattered the peaceful moment. Elizabeth's name flashed across the screen, making my stomach twist with instinctive dread.

 "Summer, come to the hospital immediately!" Her sharp voice carried its usual note of displeasure. I gripped the phone tighter, instantly alert. "What's happened?" "You have the nerve to ask what happened?" Elizabeth's voice rose with accusation. "You don't even call when your sister's career is falling apart, My mind latched onto the important information, ignoring her barbs. "Wait, what did you say? Grandpa's sick? What happened to him?"
"It's all your fault!" Elizabeth's fury crackled through the connection."What did you say to him? How did you manipulate him to wrap him around your finger? You-"

"ENOUGH!" I rarely raised my voice, but fear for my grandfather overrode everything else. "Which hospital is he in? I'm coming right now!"

There was a startled silence before Elizabeth finally answered. "Manhattan General."

I ended the call, my hands already searching for my purse and car keys.Brandon emerged from the kitchen, immediately alert to my distress.

"What's happened?" His voice was calm but focused.

"My grandfather's in the hospital." My voice cracked slightly. "I have to go see him."

Without hesitation, Brandon reached for his jacket. "Give me a minute.I'll come with you."

"No." I shook my head firmly. "It's better if you don't. If the Taylor family sees you with me right now, it'll just complicate things. Apparently they've had a fight with Grandpa abou t the stock transfer. I need to handle this myself." Something flickered in Brandon's dark eyes. "Then I definitely should be there," "But-"1hesitated,suddenly imagining Brandon getting tangled in the

Taylor family web the way Charles Windsor had. The thought made me shudder.

"No more buts." His tone brooked no argument. "I'll drive you there and wait downstairs. I won't intrude, but I'll be nearby if you need me."

Before I could protest further, he had taken the keys from my hand and was guiding me toward the garage. The decisive way he bundled me into the passenger seat of his car should have felt controlling, but instead, it was oddly comforting. In crisis, Brandon acted quickly and decisively-a trait I was becoming increasingly grateful for.

The drive to Manhattan was mostly silent, my mind racing with worst-case scenarios. Had Grandpa George collapsed? Had his heart given out? The thought of losing one of the few people who had always loved me unconditionally made my throat tighten with panic.

When we pulled into the hospital parking lot, Brandon found a spot in a secluded corner, away from the main entrance.

"June." His voice pulled me from my spiraling thoughts as I reached for the door handle.

"What is it?" I couldn't keep the impatience from my voice, every second feeling crucial.
Brandon reached over, his hand covering mine with reassuring pressure."Be careful in there. If anything happens-anything at all-call me immediately. Remember, I've got your back. Always:" Unexpected warmth bloomed in my chest despite the circumstances."Thank you. Brandon, when Grandpa's better... I want you to meet him properly." A slight smile curved his lips as he brushed a strand of hair from my face."I thought you'd want me to meet your maternal grandfather first." I paused, confused by the comment. "Why?"

He shook his head. "Go. Your grandfather needs you."

"Okay." With a quick nod, I hurried toward the entrance, his promise of support giving me the courage to face whatever waited inside.

Outside the treatment area, I spotted the Taylor family clustered together-Richard pacing anxiously, Victoria sitting with perfect posture despite her worried expression, and Elizabeth gesticulating wildly as she spoke to a nurse.

The moment Elizabeth saw me, her face contorted with rage. Before I could ask about Grandpa's condition, she stormed over and slapped me hard across the face.

"You worthless girl! Look what you've done!" she screamed, her voice echoing through the waiting area. "You've given your grandfather a stroke with your selfishness!"

I stood frozen, my hand rising to my stinging cheek as I tried to process her words. "I don't understand. How is Grandpa? What happened to him?"

Elizabeth's face turned an alarming shade of red. "Don't pretend you don't know! How did you convince him to transfer all his Capital Corp stocks to you? You ungrateful little snake - what more do you want from this family?"

She raised her hand to strike me again, but this time I caught her wrist mid-air, something cold and hard settling in my chest. I pushed her hand away firmly. "Whether Grandpa gave me stocks ornot is between him and me. What right do you have to fight with him about it?Don't think I don't know what you've been doing to him all these years." I stepped forward, forcing Elizabeth to back up. "I don't have time for this right now. Get out of my way. I need to see my grandfather."
###Chapter 80: Bit by Bit

**Summer's POV**

Elizabeth lost her balance, teetering dangerously on her high heels.Alexander rushed forward, catching her elbow just before she toppled over.

"Summer, what the hell!" Alexander snapped. "Apologize to Elizabeth right now!"

"Apologize? Seriously?" I scoffed. "Grandpa's fighting for his life in there,and you're all out here pointing fingers at me? When he wakes up, we'll see who really sent him to the hospital."

I walked away, needing space from their toxic energy. The only thing that mattered right now was Grandpa George.

Victoria's voice carried across the waiting room.

"Mom, cool it," she said loudly. "Summer's worried too.And Alex,she's just upset, cut her some slack."

*Classic Victoria*, I thought. Her talent for playing the peacemaker when others were watching was so predictable it was almost funny.

She sidled up to me with practiced grace. "Summer, you okay?"

I just stared at her, taking in the calculated concern in her eyes. Behind her, Elizabeth and Alexander watched our interaction like hawks. "Looks, I know you're still mad at me," Victoria continued, her voice honey-sweet. "But Grandpa's sick. What's so bad between sisters that we can't just get over it? I was wrong before. Can't we just move past everything for Grandpa's sake?" I almost snorted at how transparent she was. Victoria hadn't suddenly grown a conscience-she wanted something. "You're right, sister." I replied flatly. "Since Grandpa's sick, let's not discuss anything else. I need some space right now."

Victoria's eyes narrowed, but she pressed on. "Summer, do you know why Grandpa had a stroke?"


I just stared at her.

Her perfect mask slipped slightly as the silence stretched. "Summer, did Grandpa-"


The operating room doors swung open, interrupting her. A tired-looking surgeon emerged.

"Family of George Taylor?" he asked.

I rushed forward. "I'm his granddaughter, Summer Taylor."

"Your grandfather is stable for now," the doctor said. "We've relieved the pressure on his brain, but he's not out of danger yet."

"Will he be okay?" My voice cracked.

"He's temporarily out of danger, but at his age, this kind of stress is extremely risky. Whatever triggered this can't happen again."

I nodded quickly. "Of course. How is he now?" "Still unconscious. We're moving him to ICU for the night. If he wakes up tomorrow, that's a good sign." The doctor glanced at my family, who hadn't moved an inch. "Go handle billing. No need to crowd here. The patient needs complete rest tonight." "Thank God. Thank you, doctor," I said, relief washing over me. "Just doing my job." He gave me a small smile before walking away. I rumed to leave,but Victoria grabbed my arm.

"Summer, we need to talk." she insisted.

I yanked my arm free. There's nothing to talk about. Since we can't stay with Grandpa. I'm going home. I'll be back tomorrow."

Elizabeth's voice cut through the hallway. "Summer! Stop right there!

I ignored her and kept walking. Before I could reach the elevator.Elizabeth grabbed me so hard I nearly fell.

"What now?" I snapped.

You're not going anywhere until you tell us the truth!" Elizabeth hissed."Did you manipulate your grandfather into giving you those Capital Corp shares?


*Unbelievable. That's all they care about.*

"Manipulate? Seriously?" I stared at her in disbelief.


"Don't play dumb." Elizabeth snapped. "He's getting oldand you saw an opportunity. You've been buttering him up while ignoring the rest of us. It's obvious you just want his shares."

Something inside me finally broke. Years of seeking approval, making excuses for their behavior, hoping things might change-all of it suddenly felt pathetic.

"Wow. You think I fake-love Grandpa for his money?" I asked, my voice eerily calm.


"I always thought you disliked me because I'd done something wrong," I continued. "But the problem was never me-it's you. All of you. I care about Grandpa because he's my grandfather, not his damn shares." Elizabeth's face hardened. "Fine. If that's true, give the shares to Victoria.I'Il even start being a good mother to you!"

I laughed harshly. "Are you serious right now?"

I looked at Richard and Alexander, seeing the same calculating expressions on all their faces.
"If you want the shares so badly, let Grandpa decide when he wakes up.But right now, whether I have them or not, you're getting nothing from me."

Elizabeth raised her hand to slap me again. "You ungrateful-"

I shoved her away. "Three strikes and you're out, Mother. I'm a person with feelings too, but they're not infinite. You've been wearing them down bit by bit for years. And when they're gone, they're really gone."

I walked away, feeling strangely liberated. The last thread of obligation I'd felt toward my parents had finally snapped.

I walked aimlessly through Manhattan's streets, barely registering the crowds or the noise. My mind was empty, my body moving on autopilot.I didn't even notice the car following slowly behind me until I found myself in a small park, the concrete paths winding between carefully manicured shrubs. Headlights suddenly illuminated the path in front of me. I turned,momentarily blinded by the brightness, but I recognized the sleek silhouette of Brandon's car immediately. Something warm stirred in my chest, melting the ice that had formed there. My eyes began to sting with unshed tears as I quickened my pace toward him. Brandon lowered the window, his dark eyes taking in my disheveled appearance and red-rimmed eyes. He didn't ask questions, didn't demand explanations. "Get in," he said simply.

Those two words-so direct, so Brandon-felt like a lifeline thrown to someone drowning. My hand rested on the door handle, squeezing it tightly as I made a decision.

Instead of opening the door, I leaned through the window, cupping Brandon's face between my cold hands. Without overthinking it, I pressed my lips against his in a desperate, searching kiss. It wasn't skilled or practiced-it was raw and needy, a desperate attempt to find shelter from the storm inside me.

Brandon's hands came up to cradle the back of my head, deepening the kiss.
###Chapter 81: No Going Back

Summer's POV**
Brandon's lips moved against mine with a gentleness that contradicted everything I knew about him. My hands trembled as they found their way to his shoulders, uncertain at first, then growing bolder as he deepened the

When we finally pulled apart. I was breathless, clinging to his neck as my forehead rested against his. My heart hammered against my ribs.
I-sank into his embrace, my hands pressed against him ear a ars heart. The steady rhythm grounded me when everything else felt like
spinning out of comrol.

"You're bleeding," I murmured, noticing the small cut at the corner of his


captured my hand when I reached to touch it. "It's nothing."

en't you asdeg me what happened?

The comer of his mow.h lifte d in that dange rouhalf-smile. You'll tell me
when you're ready.
His thumb traced my cheek, his expression darkening slightly. "They hit you."
My body tensed as the scene at the hospital flashed through my mind-Elizabeth's rage, her handprint still burning on my skin. Brandon leaned down, placing a gentle kiss on my reddened cheek. "You don't have to carry everything alone," he said quietly. "You're not alone anymore. You have me." I lcoked up at him: "Can we go now? I'm exhausted." "Of course. Let's go home."

*Home.* The word hit me harder than I expected.

"Get some sleep when we get back," he continued. "Whatever happened,we can deal with it tomorrow."

"I don't think I can sleep," I admitted. "I'd rather just talk. That okay?"

Brandon's expression softened. "Of course."

As we drove toward the Hamptons, I found myself watching Brandon's profile.

"They found out Grandpa George transferred his Capital Corp shares to me," I finally said. "They think I manipulated him into it. That's why he had the stroke- they confronted him."

Brandon nodded slightly. "That was expected. Your father won't be in control as long as George is alive. Him wanting those shares is natural."His voice was calm. "What happened next?"

"Grandpa's in the ICU." My voice cracked. "They don't know if he'll wake up tomorrow. And now that they know about theshares,they won't leave me alone."

I stared out at the passing streetlights. "I always thought if I just kept giving in, things would never reach a breaking point. But today I realized it doesn't matter how much I give up - they'll never be satisfied."

Brandon reached over, his hand covering mine. The warmth of his touch anchored me. "What do you want to do?" he asked simply.The question caught me off guard. No one in my family had ever asked what *I* wanted.I took a deep breath. already prepare the exchange agreement?"

Brandon handed me the document. "It's for you, but it's not an exchange agreement."

I frowned. "Then what is it?"

"Remember at dinner when I said I had something for you? Seems we had similar ideas."

Confused, I opened the folder and scanned the first page-a transfer of 20% ownership in Stark Entertainment Group, directly to me.

"Brandon, what is this?"

"We've been married for a while now, and I never gave you a proper wedding gift." He spoke casually. "Consider this your bride price."

"But this is..." I stared at the document. "This is way too much. I don't need all this."

"Nothing is too valuable compared to you." The intensity in his voice made me look up. "Your grandfather was right - money may be external,but that doesn't mean it's not necessary. You married me, and I won't have you at a disadvantage."

"But what about Grandpa's shares-” "James will draft another agreement tomorrow," he cut in smoothly."What your grandfather gave you was his gesture of love, What I'm giving you is mine."

  "Brandon," I said softly, "why are you so good to me?" His answer was immediate: "Because you deserve it." The words hit me hard. All my life, I'd been told I didn't deserve things-

 
not my family's love, not Alexander's loyalty, not even basic respect.

I circled the desk and wrapped my arms around him. He stiffened momentarily before his arms came around me,holding me close.

"Brandon," I murmured, "since you're being so good to me, you have to stay that way forever. No changing your mind." The childish demand made me blush. "My heart isn't very big. It's already been broken once. If you ever betray me, I don't think I could forgive you."

His arms tightened. "I won't. Not in this lifetime."

For a long moment, we just stood there. Then, slowly, he loosened his grip.putting just enough distance between us to lift my chin.

"Are you sure?" The question was loaded with meaning, his dark eyes searching mine.

I knew exactly what he was asking.

"I'm sure," I said, holding his gaze. "We're husband and wife, aren't we?"

"We are." His voice dropped lower. "June, do you understand what you're saying? Once we start this, there's no going back. I won't let you change your mind."

The possessiveness in his tone should have frightened me. Instead, it made something warm unfurl in my chest.

My answer was to rise on my tiptoes and press my lips to his.
###Chapter 82: First Time Making Love

**Summer's POV**

My breath snagged in my chest as Brandon's lips collided with mine.a slow,consuming kiss that set my skin ablaze. His powerful hands cupped my face, fingers digging in with a possessive yet delicate grip that made my pulse stutter. When he eased back, his dark eyes burned into mine.molten with lust, silently daring me to pull away. A flush scorched up my neck, my flesh prickling as if he'd already stripped me bare with that look alone.

"Are you scared?" His voice dropped to a low, velvety growl, coiling around me and sending a tremor straight to my core.

Words failed me. My head tipped in a faint nod, then jerked into a quick shake-caught between the raw hunger clawing at me and the nervous thrum twisting low in my belly. I wanted him, a need so primal it drowned out everything else, but the weight of giving myself to him thundered in my ears, my heart slamming against my ribs.

His thumb skimmed my lower lip, a whisper of a touch that left me quivering. "If it's too much, we stop. Anytime. Just say it."
I shook my head, my voice escaping in a shaky whisper. "No. I want this.I want you." His gaze turned feral, a storm of desire churning behind it. He surged forward, his mouth claiming mine with a savage hunger that sucked the air from my lungs. His hands slid from my face,gripping my waist and yanking me against him until I felt every hard, unyielding inch of his body grinding through my blouse. His heat seeped into me, melting my resolve, my knees buckling as I pressed myself closer. With a predator's grace, he maneuvered me backward until my thighs hit the bed. I collapsed onto the sheets, the cool fabric a stark contrast to the fire raging in me, and he followed, his muscled frame looming over me like a promise. His arms caged me in, elbows braced beside my head, his stare so intense it stripped me raw, my chest heaving as I drowned in it.

"June," he breathed, the nickname spilling from his lips like liquid sin.thick with want. "You're fucking gorgeous."

His mouth descended again, blazing a trail from my lips to the soft dip of mny throat. His fingers attacked my blouse, popping buttons loose with a slow,torturous precision, peeling it open to expose my trembling skin.Each kiss seared into me-down my collarbone, over the swell of my breasts-his lips and tongue ignitinga pulsing heat that had me gasping,my nipples tightening under the thin lace of my bra.

"Brandon," I whimpered, my hands fistingin his dark hair, tugging as my back arched. offering myself to him without shame.

He growled low against my skin, his hands roaming with a greedy reverence. My blouse fell away, my bra yanked free in a swift tug, and the cool air hit my bare breasts a heartbeat before his hot mouth latched onto me. I cried out, fingers clawing at his scalp as he sucked and teased, his tongue flicking over my hardened peaks until I was squirming, a slick ache throbbing between my legs.

He pulled back, his eyes devouring me, dark and insatiable. I moved to cover myself, but he pinned my wrists with a gentle but firm grip."Don't hide from me," he murmured, his voice rough with want. "I want to see all of you." His words unraveled me, nerves dissolving into a pulsing need that set my skin on fire. He tore off his shirt, exposing the sculpted ridges of his chest,the tight V of his abdomen leading down to the bulge straining his pants.When he pressed himself against me, bare chest to bare chest,the heat of him was a drug, his firm pecs grazing my swollen breasts as he kissed me, 
tongue plunging deep, claiming every corner of my mouth.

"Tell me if it hurts," he whispered against my ear, his breath jagged and hot, betraying the leash he kept on his desire.

I nodded, mute with anticipation as his hanad slid down my side, tracing the curve of my hip before diving beneath my skirt. He dragged it off.panties and all, in one slow, deliberate pull, leaving me naked and exposed.My thighs squeezed shut, a fleeting wave of shyness crashing over me.but his-fingers brushed the tender skin there, parting them with a slow,coaxing stroke that made my breath hitch and my core clench.

"You're shaking," he murmured, pausing to meet my eyes, concern flickering through the haze of want. "We can stop-"

"No," I gasped, voice trembling. "Please...don't."

His fingers sank between my thighs, finding the dripping heat that betrayed how badly I ached for him. I bit my lip, a flush scorching my face as he parted my folds, stroking the slickness there with a slow,deliberate rhythm. He teased my clit, circling it until I was panting,hips bucking against his hand as he plunged a finger inside me, then two,stretching me with a delicious burn that had me clutching the sheets and moaning his name. When he shed his pants, I couldn't look away. His cock sprang free, thick and rigid, and he settled between my legs, the weight of him pressing me into the mattress. His eyes locked with mine, searching for hesitation, and I answered by hooking my arms around his neck, dragging him down until his tip nudged my entrance.

 The first thrust was a jolt-a sharp, stretching invasion that made me tense,my walls clenching around him. He froze, jaw tight, muscles rigid with restraint."Breathe, June," he murmured, kissing my brow, my cheeks,my lips. "Open up for me." I exhaled shakily, nodding as he pushed deeper, inch by thick inch.A sting flared as he breached me, my body resisting the sheer size of him.and I whimpered, nails digging into his shoulders. He stilled, stroking my hair, whispering against my skin untiI the pain dulled, replaced by a throbbing fullness as he filled me completely, his cock buried to the hilt.

"Does it hurt?" he asked, voice tight, eyes scanning my face.
###Chapter 83: Protect What's Yours

**Brandon's POV**
I watched June sleeping beside me. Her hair was a mess against the pillow.with traces of last night visible on her skin. As her eyes fluttered open, she noticed me watching and quickly pulled the sheets higher.

"You're awake," I said.

She blushed, avoiding my gaze. "Yeah,,. you got up early! About last night.



"What about last night?" I couldn't resist teasing her.

Her blush deepened when I sat on the bed's edge. She realized how revealing her thin silk nightgown was and yanked the covers to her chin.

"Don't look!" she protested.

I laughed, unable to help myself. This accomplished woman was hiding under sheets like a shy teenager after how she'd come apart in my arms hours ago. I reached out to stroke her hair before pulling her against my chest.

"Is my June feeling shy?" I murmured. "That's not how I remember you last night."

"Stop it!" She covered my mouth with her palm. "Don't say another word!Just pretend last night never happened,okay?" I kissed her palm. "Alright, I'll stop teasing you." I pressed my lips to hers."Hungry? Let's get you fed." Downstairs, I was finishing breakfast when June appeared, dressed in jeans and a simpleblouse. She moved with a slight hesitation that sent a jolt of masculine pride through me. "You good?" I asked, setting a plate before her.

"I'm fine," she insisted, though her cheeks flushed again. "Just a little-"

Her phone interrupted us. After answering, her expression brightened. "He's awake? That's amazing news!"

She hung up, already standing. "Grandpa George is awake. I need to see him."

"Before you go," I said, "there's something we need to handle."

In my study, I handed her the ownership transfer documents for the entertainment company.

"Since this is yours, you should sign it," I said.

June hesitated. "Wasn't I supposedto exchange my shares with you first?"

"You might ruan into your folks at the hospital," I reminded her. "Better get this settled now."

Understanding dawned, followed by a flicker of pain. "God, I'm such a failure at this whole family thing."

"No way," I said firmly. "You're making the smart move. Sign these,and we'll handle the rest together."

James texted that the paperwork was ready. I printed the documents and handed them to June. "Damn, you work fast,"she commented. "When it matters, yeah." I watched her face. "You sure about this? Your family's gonna flip." Her expression h ardened. "I'm sure. As long as you're sure -you're taking on the Taylor family drama."

I laughed. "You think I'm worried about the Taylors? Please. You're my wife now. Your problems are mine."

My words seemed to touch her. She retrieved her grandfather's stock certificates and drafted the transfer letter. I signed without reading it.

"James will get these notarized today," I assured her. "It'll be official by tomorrow."

"They're going to lose it." she said softly.

I cupped her cheek. "Let them. This is about what's best for us-not keeping them happy."

She nodded, placing her hand over mine. "I want to introduce you to both my grandfathers soon. They should meet the man I married."

"Whenever you're ready," I agreed. "I need to hit the office for a few hours.Some meetings can't wait."

June surprised me by rising to press a quick kiss to the corner of my mouth. Before she could pull away, I held her close, studying the newfound warmth in her eyes.

I captured her lips properly, and she responded eagerly. When we broke apart, she pushed gently atmy chest.

"You should get to work," she murmured. "How am I supposed to leave now?" I traced her jawline."I just want to keep you with me all day." She laughed. "Unless you've got a magical pocket like Doraemon, you can't exactly carry me around everywhere." I pretended to consider this seriously. "Maybe I should just tie you to me with a string, make sure you don't wander off."

Her eyes danced with amusement, and I found myself captivated by this lighter side of her.

Later, as I finished dressing, June spotted me by the door and frowned.

"Your tie's all messed up," she said, stepping forward to fix it.

I stood still, fighting the urge to pull her back to bed as her fingers worked.She looked completely focused, tongue caught between her teeth.

"There, perfect," she announced with a satisfied pat.

"Thanks," I said, my voice deeper than intended. "My hands are too clumsy for this. Guess I'll have to rely on my wife from now on."

Her eyes brightened at "wife." "I charge extra for this service, you know."

"How about breakfast every morning as payment?" I kissed her forehead. "See you tonight."

James waited by the car when we came downstairs. I handed him the documents.

"Mr. Taylor is awake," James informed us. "The family's already at the hospital."

June nodded. "I know. I'm going there now." "Alone?" I couldn't hide my concern. "I can't keep running from confrontation," she said firmly. "Some things I need to face myself." I reluctantlyagreed. "Call me if anything happens-anything at all." After she left, my expression hardened as I turned to James."Have Desmond follow her. Don't let her see him."

James looked surprised. "Desmond, sir?"

"You heard me," I explained. "Tell him to report directly to me if anyone gives her trouble."

"What's the status on Victoria Taylor?" I asked, shifting focus.

"She's agreed to the role, but getting out of her current contracts is complicated."

A cold smile spread across my face."Then let's give her another fall before she can rise again - one so hard she won't get up without our help."

As we drove away, my thoughts returned to June. The memory of her shy smile this morning,the way she'd blushed at my teasing.

*Protect what's yours*, my father had taught me. And June was mine now - completely, irrevocably mine. "Like hell you are!" Elizabeth grabbed my wrist. "Nobody's going in until we figure out this shares situation. What did you say to him,huh?" I looked down at her hand, then back up to meet her eyes."Let. Go."
###Chapter 84: Grandpa, I Married Brandon Sta

**Summer's POV**

The antiseptic smell of Manhattan General hit me the moment I stepped off the elevator. I clutched my bag tighter, bracing myself for the inevitable confrontation.

Elizabeth's voice reached me before I saw her, echoing down the hall.

"This is bullshit! You can't keep family from seeing their own father!" She was gesturing wildly at a nurse who looked completely over it. "Do you have any idea who we are?"

Richard sat nearby, scrolling through his phone with that tight-lipped expression I knew too well. Victoria huddled in a corner chair, hiding behind massive sunglasses anad a scarf, clearly terrified of being recognized by anyone.

"Mom, seriously, chill out," Victoria hissed. "Everyone's staring."

"Chill out? They're blocking us from seeing your grandfather! What am I supposed to do?"

I took a deep breath and stepped forward. Elizabeth spotted me immediately.

"What the hell are you doing here?" She stormed toward me, finger jabbing in my direction. "Haven't you done enough damage?"
I sidestepped her smoothly. "I'm here to see Grandpa." 
*How ironic*, I thought. *Columbia professor's daughter with zero class.*

"You manipulated him!" she hissed.

I didn't respond, just fixed her with a cold, steady gaze. Something in my expression made her suddenly go pale.

"Those eyes..." she whispered, almost to herself. "Just like her..”

Her grip loosened, and I pulled free. A nurse approached with a relieved smile.

"Are you Summer Taylor?" she asked eagerly.

"Yeah.that's me."

"Oh thank god! Mr. Taylor's been asking for you since he woke up. This way,please."

As I followed her, I could feel Elizabeth's glare drilling into my back.




Grandpa looked smaller against the white sheets, but his eyes lit up when he saw me.

"Summer!" He tried to sit up straighter.

"Grandpa!" I rushed over, tears springing to my eyes. "I'm so sorry I wasn't here sooner." He reached for my hand. "Don't be ridiculous, kiddo. You're here now." I squeezed his fingers. "How are you feeling?""Way better," he assured me, though strain showed in his face. "Nothing major." His gaze drifted toward the door. "They're all out there, aren't they?"

I nodded. "Yeah. They want to see you too."

"I bet they do," he said wryly. "Especially now that they know about the shares."

"About that... Mom confronted you, didn't she? Is that what caused...?"I couldn't finish.

Grandpa sighed. "It was gonna happen eventually. Just didn't expect this old body to give out on me." He patted my hand. "Look, I gave you those shares because I wanted to. I know they'll give you grief, but you need to understand something."

His expression grew serious. "I'm not gonna be around forever. Without those shares,Capital Corp would end up in outside hands. You were always the one who got what family legacy really means."

My fingersstiffened in his grip, guilt washing over me.

Grandpa noticed immediately. "What's wrong?"

"It's not that I don't want them," I said hesitantly. "Grandpa, I need to tell you something, but please don't freak out."

"Shoot. I can handle it."

I took a deepbreath. "Grandpa, I transferred the shares.""You what?" The shock in his voice made me wince. "I transferred the Capital Corp shares," I repeated more firmly. He stared at me, his expression shifting from surprise to curiosity. "Why,Summer? That's not like you." "Grandpa, I got mnarried."

"You..." His eyes widened. "Married? When? To who?"

"It's not what you think," I hurried to explain. "It has nothing to do with Alexander. It's someone good, someone who actually cares about me.Someone you've met."

"Have I?" Grandpa studied my face. "You look... different. Happier."

I couldn't help smiling. "It's Brandon Stark."

"Brandon Stark?" Recognition dawned. "The young man who gave me that chess set?"

I nodded, feeling my cheeks warm. "Yeah, that's him."

"I remember him well," Grandpa said thoughtfully. "Stood out from the crowd. Sharp as a tack." His eyes narrowed. "So he wasn't at my party just for business... he came because of you?"

"Yeah. And he helped me that night when..." I trailed off, not wanting to upset him with details.

Understanding flashed in his eyes. "I see. And the shares? You gave them to him?"

"But Grandpa, I didn't just give them away," I explained quickly."Brandon gave me shares in Stark Entertainment Group in exchange.""Stark Entertainment Group?" His eyebrows shot up. "That's quite a trade."

 Grandpa was silent for a moment, then chuckled softly."Well, well," he said, patting my hand. "My Summer's landed on her feet,hasn't she? Brandon Stark..." He shook his head. "I couldn't have picked better myself." "So you're not mad about the shares?"

"Mad? Why would I be mad? I gave them to you to secure your future."He studied my face. "He's treating you right, isn't he?"

"Better than I ever thought possible," I admitted softly.

Grandpa nodded, satisfied. "Good. You deserve that."

"When do I get to meet this husband of yours properly?" he asked.suddenly energized.

"As soon as you're better," I promised. "I want to introduce you formally."

"I'm perfectly fine now!" he protested.

"Grandpa. take it easy! Brandon isn't going anywhere."

"Fine," he relented with a dramatic sigh. "But soon. I've got questions for that young man."

"He'll be ready." I assured him, grinning.

"What about your parents? Do they know?"

I shook my head, "No. Only you. I'd like to keep it that way for now."

"Smart move," Grandpa agreed. "This is your life. You don't need their drama." *If Richard and Elizabeth knew I married Brandon Stark, they'd be kissing up to him in a heartbeat. No thanks.* "What about the Stark family?" Grandpa asked. "That'll happen when the time's right," I said. My phone buzzed. I smiled seeing "Bran" on the display. "Excuse me, Grandpa. I should take this."

Grandpa waved dismissively. "Go ahead."

"Hey. Bran," I answered,smiling.

"Say that again." Brandon's deep voice sent a shiver down my spine.

"Say what?" I asked,confused.

Then it hit me. "Oh!" I felt my face heat up as I turned away from Grandpa."No way!"

"You called me that yesterday," Brandon reminded me, amusement clear in his tone.

"Stop it." I whispered. "I'm with my grandfather.He's awake!"


"Good.How is he?"

"The doctors say he'll be fine with rest," I replied. "Oh, and I told him about us."

I glanced at Grandpa, who was watching me with knowing eyes. "Grandpa,want to talk to Brandon?"

He shook his head. "Not now. You two go ahead."

I adjusted his blanket before turning back to the phone. "WWhen Grandpa's better, I want to formally introduce you." "Looking forward to it," Brandon replied, his voice softening in that way that was just for me.
###Chapter 85: Giving Brandon a Surprise

**Summer's POV**

I tucked the blanket around Grandpa's frail form as he drifted off to sleep.Poor thing couldn't even finish telling me about his chess collection before the meds knocked him out. Watching his chest rise and fall, I felt that familiar ache. He was the only Taylor who'd ever truly loved me without conditions.

After adjusting his pillow one last time, I grabbed my purse and braced myself. The vultures were waiting.

The second I stepped into the hallway, Elizabeth pounced, her manicured claws digging into my arm.

"What did your grandfather tell you?" she demanded. "Did he agree to give Victoria the shares?"

I stared at her hand, then slowly raised my eyes. "Let. Go."


Elizabeth's grip only tightened. "Answer me!"

I yanked my arm free. "Seriously? Grandpa's fighting for his life, and all you care about is who gets his damn shares? What kind of daughter are you? I've already told you - I'm not helping with this twisted scheme."

"How dare you?" Elizabeth's face contorted. "You ungrateful little brat! Is this how you speak to your mother?" "Oh,so you remember you're my mother?" I laughed bitterly."That's rich." Victoria stepped between us, her expression a perfect mask of concern."Summer! God, what's gotten into you?" She reached for my hand, but I sidestepped her. Right on cue,her eyes filled with tears-the same trick that had won her countless auditions. What happened to you?" Richard demanded. "Did your grandfather tell you anything?"

"Just that someone deliberately upset him, which triggered his stroke," I replied coolly. "Since you two live with him, maybe try caring about his health instead of his portfolio for once."

Richard's face darkened. "Watch your tone! If you need money, just ask.But company shares? Absolutely not. You know nothing about running a business."

"And there it is," I said softly. "Your real concern."

"I'm the CEO of Capital Corp -of course I care!"

"You're also his son," I countered. "Have you asked about his condition even once sincehe collapsed? And you wonder why Grandpa might give his shares to me?"

Elizabeth cut in, "Enough! Just make her hand over the shares!"

"Forget it. I'm not giving you anything."

Victoria's eyes narrowed. "So they really are yours now?"

Something shifted ina her expression. After a quick glance at Alexander, she completely changed tactics.

"Summer, honey,"she cooed, "I'll buy them from you. Fair and square." "Buy them?" I couldn't help but laugh. "With what money?" Victoria straightened. "I've made plenty in Hollywood! My last three films were-" "If you love entertainment so much, stick with it," I interrupted."Wall Street isn't your scene.""I can learn!" she snapped. "Those shares are wasted on you.Someone might take advantage!"

I borrowed Brandon's cold smile. "I think I'm good. The shares aren't for sale. Not for any price."

I hitched my bag higher. "Grandpa's asleep. I'm leaving."

Elizabeth blocked my path. "You're not going anywhere until this is settled!11


"Summer, be reasonable," Richard used his boardroom voice."Anything else you want, I can give you."

"So now you're threatening me?" I shook my head. "Oh, by the way -Grandpa gave me the shares, but I've already transferred them to someone else."

Richard's jaw dropped. "What? You gave away the shares? When? To whom?"

"I'm not telling you," I replied evenly. "But I'll make you a deal-manage Capital Corp properly and don't transfer your current shares, and I guarantee Grandpa's shares won't threaten your position. However,"I added, "if you change anything about the current structure, I will take action."

"Are you threatening me?" Richard's voice dropped dangerously. "I'm just being clear," I met his gaze. "I'm not the same Summer who always caved. The sooner you understand that, thebetter." I caught Victoria's venomous look and Alexander's calculating stare. "I have to go," I said firmly. Elizabeth stepped forward. "You stop right there,you ungrateful little bitch! I dodged her easily. "Push me too far, and Capital Corp might find itself under new management entirely."

As I reachedthe exit, Alexander caught up. "Summer, wait! Is what you said true? About the shares?"

I slid into my car without acknowledging him. As I pulled away, I made another decision - I was done with Fortune Corp. No more working with Alexander. Time for a fresh start.




The Hamptons estate was quiet when I arrived, Brandon still at work. I headed upstairs with determined steps and gathered all his belongings from the guest room - suits, books, watch case, everything.

One by one, I moved them to the master bedroom, arranging his clothes in the empty side of the walk-in closet. I placed his books on the nightstand closest to the door, remembering how he always positioned himself between me and potential threats.

I changed the sheets to deep navy, added warm amber curtains, and placed fresh flowers on the dresser- nothing too feminine, just enough to add life to the space. Downstairs, I made subtle changes to the living room, then headed to the kitchen. My cooking skills were basic, but I'd been practicing secretly.Tonight would be the real test -a proper welcome home for my husband.I was chopping vegetables when I heard the front door open. Earlier than expected-perfect. I smiled, listening to his footsteps. His footsteps moved upstairs, and I imagined his reaction to finding his things moved. Part of me worried he might be upset- Brandon was partícular about his space. But something told me he'd understand what this gesture meant.

I was arranging plates when I felt him enter the kitchen behind me. Even without turning, I knew he was there - something about the energy shifted when Brandon entered a room.

"Brandon?" I turned, spatula in hand, suddenly feeling oddly shy despite everything we'd shared.
###Chapter 86: I'll Always Be With You

**Summer's POV*

"You're cooking," he observed, his expression softening in a way that made my stomach flutter.

"I thought I'd surprise you," I said, setting down the knife. "But that's not the only surprise."

He raised an eyebrow, waiting.

I wiped my hands on a towel, suddenly unsure how to explain. "I,um...I moved your things. From the guest room. To our room." The words tumbled out in a rush. "I thought since we've already... I mean, I should have asked first,but I wanted to-"

"June." he said softly, cutting off my nervous rambling.

I looked up at him, searching his face for any sign of displeasure. "You're not mad,are you?"

Instead of answering, he stepped closer, brushing my hair back before pulling me against his chest.

"Why would I be mad about that, silly?" he murmured.

I relaxed into his embrace. "You're homeearly today."

His fingers traced lazy patterns on my back. "Missed you." The simple admission sent warmth through my chest. Rising onto my tiptoes, I pressed a quick kiss to his jawlne. "Come on," I said, tugging his hand. "I was in the middle of making dinner." "Let me help." he offered.

In the kitchen. I returned to my chopping while Brandon rolled up his sleeves.

"I can finish this," I insisted. "You've been working all day."

"So have you," he countered, taking the knife from my hand with gentle firmness. "Take a break. I'll handle dinner."

"But I wantedto−′′

A slight smile played at his lips. "Consider it a reward. For your initiative."

He tapped my nose playfully, the casual intimacy of the gesture making my pulse skip.

The rich aroma of sizzling steak soon filled the house. Brandon plated everything with expert care while I poured wine into the crystal glasses that caught the light from the chandelier, casting tiny rainbows across the polished dining table.

"Oh my god," I moaned around a forkful of perfectly seared steak. "Where'd you learn to cook like this?"

Brandon looked amused as he sipped his wine. "College. It was either cook or starve."

 I couldn't stop stealing glances at him across the table, mesmerized by the way the light caught his jawline. After the third time I got caught staring,Brandon set down his cutlery with deliberate precision. I jumped slightly. "Not hungry?" he asked. "No! I mean,yes-it's delicious," I stammered, suddenly focusing on my plate. He shook his head. "Eat properly. Whatever's on your mind can wait."

"Right. Sorry." I nodded, feeling my cheeks heat up.

When we finished, I straightened in my chair, gathering my courage. "I told Grandpa George about us today."

"I know," he replied calmly. "And?"

"My parents found out too," I continued, twisting my napkin. "They think I'm lying about giving the shares away. They seriously think I was after Taylor family money all along!"

Brandon's expression remained neutral. "What's your plan? Need my help?”

"Not yet." I shook my head. "I told them as long as they don't mess with the current ownership structure, my portion won't threaten them. But if they try changing things, I'll use my shares to stop them."

Something flickered across Brandon's face.

"What?" I asked anxiously. "Did I say something wrong?"

"No,you did well," he assured me. "But the shares you have no enough for full leverage. At most, you can establish equal footing want real power, you need absolute advantage. Understand?"

I sighed. "You know I never wanted to get involved in this mess. But I ge what you're saying. The problem is, these are all the shares I have." I paused. "I just found out today that what Grandpa signed over earlier wasn't everything. The complete transfer was in the second document. He gave me all of his shares-forty percent of Capital Corp. No wonder Richard and Elizabeth were freaking out." Even with my limited business knowledge, I understood what forty eant-significant, but not controlling interest.Brandon nodded. "Tll handle this. Don't worry."

His chair scraped against the hardwood as he stood, gathering our empty plates. The crystalware clinked softly as he stacked everything with practiced efficiency.

"Let me help with that," I offered, following him to the kitchen.

He placed his hand over mine, shaking his head. "Go relax. I'Il clean up."

I ignored him, trailing behind as he moved towward the sink. "You know, I always thought Wall Street hotshots like you wouldn't do household chores."

"What did you think I'd do?" he asked, sleeves rolled up to reveal tanned forearms as he ran water over the dishes.

"I don't know. Hit up fancy parties? Network with other finance bros?"

Brandon smiled faintly. "I lefthome young, remember? And not all wealthy people live that lifestyle. Stark family education was... extremely strict."

Something in his eyes flickered-a brief shadow of loneliness. Without thinking, I stepped behind him, wrapping my arms around his waist.

"Thank you, Brandon," I said softly. "For what?" "For giving me a home," I whispered. I closed my eyes, breathing him in, realizing only now did I truly feel like we were family, The thought made me hold him tighter. "Tll always take care of you." I promised. "TI'll always be with you."

"Tll always be with you too," he said, a smile in his voice. "But if you keep hugging me like this, these dishes aren't getting done."

"Oh!" I stepped back, embarrassed. "Right! I'll just... go watch TV!"

I hurried out, his low chuckle following me as I retreated to the living room. The enormous flat-screen glowed dimly against the wall,but I barely registered what was playing as I sank into the plush cushions of the sofa. My mind kept drifting to Brandon-the gentleness beneath his tough exterior, how natural it felt to promise him forever.

The soft padding of his footsteps on the carpet announced his arrival. He settled at the opposite end of the sofa, patting his leg invitingly. Without hesitation, I slid over, laying my head in his lap.

His fingers found my temples, massaging in slow circles that made me sigh.

"That feels amazing," I murmured,eyes drifting closed.

I reached up, finding his jawline. "Lower," I commanded playfully."Bend down more."

Brandon caught my hand. "Stop that."

I pulled free, determined to touch him. My fingers traced his jaw,marveling at the smoothness. "How is your skin so perfect?" I complained. "It's better than mine! Better than most women's. So unfair." His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile. "Why be jealous? I'm all yours." The casual declaration hit me like a physical force, I froze,heart hammering as his dark eyes captured mine. "1, uh... wow. I don't even know what to say," I stammered. "I'm tired. I should go to bed!"

I tried to sit up but my muscles protested, aching from stress and emotion.
I looped my arms around his neck.

"I can't move." I admitted. "Carry me?"

Brandon's eyes darkened. "You sure about that?"

Before I could respond, he stood in one fluid motion, lifting me effortlessly against his chest.

He didn't say a word as he carried me through the dimly lit hallway,his jaw set in a way that made my heart race.

My face burned as I realized what he might be thinking. I buried my face against his shoulder, too embarrassed to meet his eyes, my fingers nervously clutching at his shirt. What have I gotten myself into? I thought,my entire body tingling with a mixture of anticipation and shyness as he pushed open the bathroom door with his foot, the soft click of the latch echoing in the silence.
###Chapter 87:Making Love In A Tub

**Summer's POV**

The bathroom door clicked shut, and Brandon carried me straight to the tub. the air thick with steam from the hot water. He set me down on the edge, my toes dipping into the warmth as he turned off the faucet, the soft drip of water echoing in the quiet. My heart pounded, my skin prickling as he stood between my legs, his hands resting lightly on my hips. I could feel him through his pants, hard and insistent, and a nervous flush crept up my chest.

"Summer," he said quietly, his voice low and soothing as his thumb grazed my cheek. "You okay?"

I nodded.biting my lip, my fingers fidgeting with the hem of his shirt.

He smiled, gentle and reassuring, and leaned in, kissing me slow and deep,his tongue tracing mine until my nerves melted into heat. My hands shook as I fumbled with his shirt buttons, popping them open one by one to reveal his broad chest. I ran my fingers over his skin, hesitant andunsure,and he hummed softly, encouraging me without rushing.

Then came his pants. I bit my lip, my hands trembling as I reached for his belt. The metal clinked loudly in my fumbling grip, and I struggled with the zipper, my knuckles brushing against the thick bulge beneath. My face flamed as I finally tugged his pants and boxers down together, his cock springing free-long, hard, and already slick at the tip. I froze,staring,my breath shallow. "You don't have to be shy," he murmured, his tone warm as he tilted my chin up, meeting my eyes. "It's just me." He stepped out of his clothes,fully bare now, and guided me into the tub, the water sloshing as he settled in first, pulling me down to straddle his lap. 
I yelped softly as the heat enveloped me, my knees pressing into the porcelain on either side of him. He tugged my shirt off, then my shorts,leaving my panties last. His fingers slipped under the waistband,peeling the soaked fabric down my thighs, and I shivered as he tossed them aside,the water lapping at my bare skin. His eyes darkened, roaming over me,and I felt my core clench under his gaze.

"You're so beautiful, you know?" he said quietly, his hands sliding up my thighs as he pulled me closer. The water rippled around us, warm and slick, and I gasped as his fingers found me, teasing my folds before pressing inside, slow and careful. My walls fluttered around him,wetter than the bath itself, and I clutched his shoulders, my nails digging in as he curled his fingers, stretching me gently.

"Brandon..." My voice trembled, needy, and I shifted in his lap, feeling his cock nudge against my thigh. I reached down, wrapping my hand around him,but my grip was awkward, too tight then too loose, my strokes jerky and uneven. I glanced up, embarrassed. "Is this...okay?"

He exhaled shakily, his hand guiding mine with patience. "You're perfect,"he said, his voice soft and steady. "Just go slow-feel me." I tried again,my palm gliding over his length, slick with water and his own arousal,and he groaned quietly, the sound making my pulse race.But he didn't let me fumble long. He lifted my hips, the water sloshingas he positioned me over him. Then he guided me down, his cock pressing into me, thick and unyielding. I whimpered, the stretch burning as he filled me, inch by inch, the water doing little to ease the raw sensation. My hands gripped his neck, my body trembling as I sank fully onto him, his hips flush against mine. "Oh god," I gasped, the fullness overwhelming, my pussy clenching tight around him as the water lapped at my waist. He started to move, slow at first, his hands on my hips lifting me up then pulling me back down,each thrust sending waves through the tub. The wet slap of our bodies mingled with my shaky moans, the heat of him inside me blending with the bath's warmth.

"You feel so good," he murmured, his lips brushing my ear as he rocked into me, deeper now, his cock dragging against every sensitive spot. My breasts bounced with each motion, water dripping from my skin, and I arched into him, desperate for more. He spread my thighs wider,his grip firm but tender, and the angle shifted, hitting something inside me that made me cry out, my voice echoing off the tiles.

"I-I can't-" I stammered, the pleasure coiling tight and fast as he thrust harder, the water splashing over the edge. He reached between us, his fingers finding my clit, rubbing slick, tight circles, and I shattered. My orgasm hit like a flood, my cunt spasming hard around him, gushing into the water as I shook, sobbing his name. He held me through it, his thrusts steady,drawing out every tremble.

"You're amazing." he whispered, his voice breaking as his pace faltered.He buried himself deep, groaning softly as he came, his cock pulsing inside me.spilling hot and thick. I felt it leak out, mixing with the water, and he pulled me against his chest, both of us breathless, the bath rippling around us.

Afterwards, I lay wrapped in sheets, my body still tingling. The memory of him carrying me to the bathroom, how we'd made love in the warm water,made me flush all over again.

"Quit staring at the ceiling," Brandon's deep voice pulled me back. "I'm not," I protested weakly. "Just thinking.""About?" His eyes flicked up from his laptop. "You," I admitted. 
Brandon set his work aside. "You should get somne sleep."

"What about you?" I tuagged at his arm. "Aren't you coming to bed?"

"Hmm." He closed his laptop and slid down beside me. I shifted closer until my arm pressed against his.

I tilted my head toward him, hands reaching for his arm. Brandon leaned over.pressing a soft kiss to my forehead. "Sleep," he murmured.

I closed my eyes, still holding onto him as I drifted off.

I jolted awake hours later to empty space beside me. The clock read 3:27AM.

I switched on the lamp. Brandon's side was empty, like he'd never been there.

I padded across the cold floor to the guest room and knocked softly. No answer.

Turning to head back. I nearly ran into Brandon standing in the hallway with a glass of water.

His eyes dropped to my bare feet. "Where are your slippers? Floor's freezing."

"I woke up and you weren't there," I said, feeling suddenly small."Thought maybe you'd bailed." "Come on." He handed me his slippers and scooped me up. "Where were you anyway?" I asked. "It's like, the middle of the night." "Working. Had to finish some stuff.""What's so important it couldn't wait tillmorning?" My voice had an edgeI couldn't hide.

Brandon studied my face, something shifting in his expression."Nothing that matters."

"Don't go back to work," I blurted, tugging his sleeve. "Stay with me,okay?1

He nodded. "Work can wait." He pulled me closer. "I'm not going anywhere,June. Not ever."
###Chapter 88: Come Work at Stark Group

*Summer's POV

My morning at Fortune Corp started with disaster. I'd barely set my coffee down when Lawrence appeared at my door, his face rigid with anger.

"The Harrington bid was leaked. Board meeting. Now."

In the conference room. I found myself facing a firing squad of executives.They wasted no time getting to the point: the confidential bid documents I was responsible for had somehow ended up in our competitor's hands.costing us a major project.

"I secured those files personally," I insisted, but my protests fell on deaf ears.

The timing couldn't have been worse.Fortune Corp was already struggling since Stark Group had reduced their investment projects - our main source of revenue. They needed a scapegoat, and I was the perfect target.

After an hour of thinly veiled accusations, Richard delivered the final blow:"We're reassigning your projects. Alexander will take over the Johnston account effective immediately."

I left the meeting with my dignity intact but my position effectively gutted.As I mechanically packed up the Johnston files, a strange feeling washed over me.*I should be devastated,* I thought.SOwhy do I feel almost... relieved?* My phone's vibration broke through my daze. Brandon's name flashed on the screen, bringing an instant wave of comfort. "Hey,"Ianswered,my voice softer than intended. "Busy?"His deep voice immediately eased some of the tension  from my shoulders.

"Not really.What's up?"

"What's wrong?" he asked immediately, catching the strain in my tone.

I sighed, leaning back in my chair. "Just... work stuff. The company had a bid leaked to competitors, and guess who they're blaming?"

"What happened exactly?" Brandon's voice sarpened with interest.

I quickly explained the situation - the leaked documents, the accusations,being stripped of my projects.

"They're basically pushing me out without firing me," I concluded."Typical corporate politics."

Brandon's low, derisive snort carried clearly through the phone. "Why keep doing something that makes you miserable?"

The blunt question caught me off guard, then made me smile despite everything. So perfectly Brandon - cutting straight to the heart of the matter.

"Honestly, I've been thinking the same thing," I admitted. "Even before this happened, I was... I was pretty much ready to hand in my resignati 11


"I'll come pick you up." he said. "Pick me up? For what? Don't you have work?" "To take you somewhere. You've got nothing better to do at Fortune Corp now anyway,right?"

  I glanced at my empty inbox, at the Johnston files boxed and ready for Alexander. He was right- I'd been effectively sidelined, with no real work left to do.

"You know what? You're right. Come get me."

After hanging up, I started gathering my personal items-the framed photo of Grandpa George, my favorite pen, the small cactus Ruby had given me last Christmas. Amy rushed in, her eyes wide with alarm.

"Miss Taylor, what are you doing?" she gasped, looking horrified. "You can't leave now! They'll say you're guilty for sure!"

I set down the small box and gave her a reassuring smile. "I'm not quitting,Amy. I just don't have anything to do right now, so I'm heading out early.



"But..." she began, wringng her hands anxiously.

I reached out, gently squeezing her shoulder. "Amy, thank you for believing in me. But... you should focus on your own work. I'll be fine."

She didn't look convinced, but nodded reluctantly. I could feel her confused gaze following me as I headed toward the elevators.



Outside Fortune Corp's towering glass facade, I spotted Brandon's sleek car parked across the street. My phone buzzed with his incoming call,but instead of answering, I waved and jogged over, feeling oddly light despite the morning's drama.
I opened the passenger door, then paused when I saw James behind the wheel."It's pretty obvious they want me to quit voluntarily," I said, wat city blur past the window. "Easier than firing me.""Are you upset about it?" Brandon asked, still playing with my fingers. "Yes, Mrs. Stark, Hello!" James's greeting was perfectly professional, though I caught the slight smile in his eyes through the rearview mirror. Brandon turned to him with a pointed look. "Are we going to sit here all day?"

"No. Mr. Stark!" James immediately straightened,putting the car in drive.

I couldn't help staring at Brandon's profile,admiring the sharp line of his jaw, the quiet confidence in his bearing. Even in casual clothes, he radiated authority.

He caught me watching and his lips curved into that dangerous half-smile.
"How do you think my look?"

I said honestly. "Mmm, very handsome."

Brandon reached back, taking my hand and placing it on his knee. The casual possessiveness of the gesture sent warmth through me.

"Taking you to Stark Entertainment for a bit," he said, his thumb tracing circles on my palm.

"Stark Entertainment? Why-" Understanding dawned. "Victoria's audition is today?"

Brandon nodded. "Since you've got nothing better to do, thought you might enjoy seeing your sister's acting skills in action."

"Good point. Not like I have anything else on my plate right now."

As we drove through Manhattan's crowded streets, I found more about the Fortune Corp situation. tugged my hand. The small gesture brought me back to the present.

"Honestly? Not really," I admitted. "I was planning to resign anyway. This just makes it easier. I'll go in tomorrow and make it official."

I frowned slightly. "Though I guess this doesn't look great on my resume."

Brandon made a dismissive sound. "You're worried about that?"

"Aren't you? I mean, doesn't reputation matter in our world?"

"If you've got skills, there's always someone willing to hire you," he stated with absolute certainty.

I was about to respond when I noticed he was drawing something on my palm. the light touch sending tingles up my arm. His dark eyes held mine as his finger traced patterns across my sensitive skin.

"Come work at Stark Group." he said suddenly.

I blinked, sure I'd misheard."What?"

Brandon's expression turned serious. "Come to Stark Group. I know what you're capable of. Come work with us."

My face heated as I gently pulled my hand away. "I don't know if that's a good idea..."

I instinctively glanced at James, wondering what he thou obviously nepotistic offer. Brandon's brow furrowed. "Why are you looking at him?" James immediately stiffened, focusing intently on the road ahead. "I just don't want special treatment," I mnumbled, feeling my cheeks flush hotter.
###Chapter 89: A Good Show

**Summer's POV**

Brandon's eyebrow shot up at my comment about not wanting special treatment, a dangerous half-smile playing at his lips. "Is my wife trying to avoid nepotism accusations?"

I shot him an irritated glare, sensing the teasing undertone in his voice. "That's not what I meant and you know it."

He smirked, giving my hand a gentle squeeze with a slight sigh. "Nobody even knows about our relationship yet!"

My chest tightened at the reminder. It was my decision to keep our marriage private-something Brandon had agreed to-but hearing him say it out loud made me feel strangely conflicted. I glanced toward the rearview mirror, my eyes meeting James's for a brief second.

"Well, except for James," I pointed out quietly.

Brandon's eyes snapped to the rearview mirror, his gaze hardening into a warning that made James instantly stiffen. The poor assistant's spine went ramrod straight, though I could sense his inner frustration at being caught in our marital dynamics yet again.

James cleared his throat awkwardly, clearly trying to gather his courage."Actually, Mrs. Stark, you can pretend I don't exist. I'm extremely discreet in most situations-practically invisible!" I looked at Brandon in surprise before a laugh bubbled out of me. His assistant was genuinely entertaining, and I had to admire how he owned up to his "situational invisibility" without a hint of embarrassment.

 "Alright," I grinned, "I'll try to pretend you're not here." The car glided into Stark Entertainment's underground garage, pulling into what was clearly Brandon's private parking spot. James hurried out to open Brandon's door, his professional demeanor firmly back in place.

"Sir, producer Quinn called again," James reported urgently. "Victoria's throwing a tantrum!"

Brandon's lips thinned into a hard line. "Keep her waiting."

I stepped out of the car, shocked at this information. "She's actually losing it?" This didn't sound like the Victoria I knew. My sister was a master.at image control-she never showed her true colors in public, saving her nastiest behavior for behind closed doors.

"That's pretty standard for celebrities," James explained with practiced diplomacy. "Especially when they're made to wait."

Brandon turned to James. "What about the script we arranged?"

"As instructed, sir. It's for the spy drama adapted from that historical espionage piece. She'll be playing the female antagonist-the one who dies quite horribly in the end."

"And Thomas? I assume he's still unhappy with our choice?"

James nodded. "He's making his displeasure known, sir."

"Find a way to calm him down," Brandon directed before turning to me. "Let's go upstairs. I want to show you around-you might be spending a lot of time here in the future." Brandon led me through the sleek corridors of Stark Entertainment,eventually bringing me to what looked like a modern control room.Multiple screens displayed different parts of the building, including Studio One,where I could see my sister pacing impatiently. 
"Monitoring room," Brandon explained. "We can see what's happening in all the studios from here."

On one of the screens, Victoria was sitting in what appeared to be a waiting room, her body language screaming impatience. Even through the surveillance feed, I could tell she was seething. Her manager sat beside her,constantly checking his watch.

"I can't believe this," Victoria hissed, loud enough for the microphones to pick up: "I've been waiting for over an hour!"

I winced at her entitled attitude. This was the real Victoria-the one only our family usually got to see.

"Let's go," she announced suddenly, standing up. "This role is mine anyway. I don't need to sit around all day."

Her manager jumped up, grabbing her arm. "Victoria, please! You know Stark Entertainment is a mnajor player. The role might be pretty much guaranteed, but we don't want to burn bridges. They're probably just busy--let's wait a little longer."

A secretary entered the waiting room just as Victoria was about to respond."Miss Taylor? Mr. Wilson is ready for you in Studio One."

Victoria instantly switched on her public persona, though I could te the tightness around her eyes that she was still fuming. The secret neutral expression made me wonder if she'd overheard Victorias complaints. Her manager pulled out an envelope as they prepared to leave. "Please,take this as a token of our appreciation for your assistance," he said smoothly to the secretary. "That won't be necessary," the woman replied coolly. "I'm just a secretary-I couldn't possibly influence anything for someone of Miss Taylor's caliber. Mr. Wilson is here from headquarters, and he's on a tight schedule."

Victoria's smile remained fixed, but I could see the fury behind her eyes."Of course, Mr. Wilson is a busy man. Please, lead the way."

I turned to Brandon. "She has no idea,does she?"

Brandon shook his head, that dangerous smile playing at his lips. "Not a clue."

On another screen, I watched Victoria enter Studio One. The vast space was nearly empty except for three people-James, a woman I assumed was the producer, and a bored-looking guy who might be the assistant director.

"Miss Taylor," the producer called out without getting up. "I assume you've reviewed the script Mr. Wilson sent over? Let's get started."

Victoria glanced helplessly at James, who merely gestured for her to proceed.

I could see panic flash across my sister's face. "She didn't prepare," I realized aloud.

"Of course not," Brandon replied. "Victoria thnks she's too important for that."

On screen, Victoria was clearly stalling."I,um..."

"Miss Taylor," James interrupted, looking shocked. "Are you not prepared?Mr. Stark specifically asked me to oversee this casting personally."

Victoria's face went pale. "Mr. Stark? Brandon Stark himself?"

"Naturally," James confirmed. "This production represents a significant investment. While you're only playing the second female lead,

  it's a substantial sole that could overshadow the protagonist if performed correctly. After your recent.,, difficulties, I assumed you'd appreciate this opportunity."

Victoria's expressionshifted through shock, panic, and finally calculation.

"I'm so sorry," she said, suddenly looking fragile. "I haven't been feeling well.and-"

"If you're unwell, perhaps you should go home and rest," James suggested smoothly. "We can always wait. Though I should mention that Director Thomas already hadsomeone else in mind for this role-"

"No!" Victoria cut him off desperately. "I just need a few minutes to prepare.Please!"

I couldn't help but notice how perfectly she summoned tears to the edge of her lashes without letting them fall. She truly was a natural actress-just not in the way she thought.

"Thirty minutes," James conceded.

Victoria nodded gratefully, then turned to her manager. "The script?"

The manager's panicked expression said it all-they hadn't brought it.

Victoria's face fell as she turned back to James. "Mr. Wilson... could I possibly borrow a copy? I left insuch a hurry this morning,and..."

"Unbelievable," I muttered,watching this disaster unfold.
###Chapter 90: The Boss's Wife?

**Summer's POV**

"Forgot?" James's voice showed barely contained irritation. He then turned to the producer. "Quinn, would you please give Miss Taylor the script?"

Victoria's smile was starting to crack at the edges. Even through the grainy footage. I could see the tension in her shoulders as James continued.

"Miss Taylor, this film is extremely important to Mr. Stark. He's invested considerable capital in this project," James said, his professional tone barely hiding his frustration. "If I don't fulfill my responsibilities here, it'll be my ass on the line when I report back to him."

Victoria shot her manager a venomous glare before quickly composing herself.

"Yeah, this was totally our oversight," she said, voice dripping with practiced contrition. "Won't happen again. Just give me tirty minutes,I'll-"

"Fine," James pinched the bridge of his nose. "Make it quick, Miss Taylor.Mr. Stark has other matters waiting for my attention."

"Of course!" Victoria nodded eagerly.

I watched my sister struggle to focus on the pages, her eyes darting back and forth as she tried to memorize the lines. Her fingers gripped the script so tightly the pages crumpled.

 After James departed, Victoria maintained her strained smile. "Quinn," Victoria ventured, "what happens next...?"The producer settled more comfortably into her chair. "Mr. Wilson might be in a hurry, but I've got all day, Miss Taylor. No need to rush-take it slow. I'll be right here with you."

"I've never seen her like this," I murmured, unable to look away from Victoria's increasingly desperate attempts to memorize her lines.

"So you brought me here just to watch her act?" I asked.

His lips curved into that dangerous half-smile as he beckoned me over.Without warning, Brandon pulled me into his lap, his arms wrapping firmly around my waist.

"What the hell?" I gasped, squirming in surprise. "Let me go!" I shot him an exasperated glare, my cheeks burning.

Brandon chuckled. resting his chin on my shoulder. "Just chill for a sec.Let me hold you."

I sighed in defeat. gradually relaxing against him. His warmth enveloped me, and despite my initial protest, I found myself oddly comfortable.

A knock at the door made me stiffen. "Is that James?"

Brandon's arms loosened. "Come in," he called, as I scrambled to my feet and quickly smoothed down my blouse.

James entered, immediately noticing my flushed face and Brandon's satisfied expression. He cleared his throat awkwardly.

"Sir, about Victoria Taylor.,. she's quite the performer," he reported diplomatically. "Oh yeah?" Brandon asked, amusement evident. "She's..." James hesitated. "Well, let's just say she's persistent." Brandon's smile returned as he gestured toward me. "Wanna take a tour of the place?" "A tour of what?" I asked, eyeing him suspiciously.

"Since she enjoys making things difficult," Brandon said,glancing at James,"might as well play along. How you handle it is upto you." He paused."Let's give her something to really freak out about."

"Brandon!" I bit my lip hesitantly. "Do you really have to do this?"

"Don't you want me to?" He raised an eyebrow, studying my face."If you don't. I won't. But think about it-your kindness doesn't exactly get you muchin return."

I felt my resolve waver. I knew Victoria better than anyone-if Brandon didn't intervene, she'd absolutely focus on making my life hell. Especially now that the Taylors knew about Grandpa's shares.

"Fine," I sighed. "Do whatever you think is best."

"Good." Brandon nodded, dismissing James with a wave.

James had left, Brandon studied my distant expression. "What's going on in that head of yours?" he asked, reaching over to ruffle my hair. "Hmm?"

I shook my head. "I feel like I'm turning into Victoria. But maybe that's not so bad."

"You're nothing like her," Brandon said with unexpected gravity.He cupped my face between his hands. "She's not worth a fraction of who you are."His words sent warmth cascading through me. Even if he was just trying to make me feel better, it worked. "C'mon," Brandon said, offering his hand. "Let me show you around." He led me out, fingers intertwined with mine. We'd entered through the CEO's private access earlier, which was why nobody had noticed us arrive.Now. as we walked through the main corridor, employees stopped and stared at the notorious Brandon Stark holding hands with an unknown woman.

"Cut it out," I muttered, trying to pull away. "Everyone's staring."

Brandon tightened his grip, smiling smugly. He walked slightly ahead,holding my hand behind him in a possessive gesture that practically screamed relationship.

"If you keep this up, the whole damn Street will know about us by tomorrow," I warned.

He turned, suddenly serious. "Does that bother you?"

The directness caught me off guard. Did it? A few weeks ago, I'd have freaked out. But now...

"No," I said finally. "It doesn't."

His face lit up. "Good," he said, ruffling my hair affectionately,causing nearby female employees to gasp. "Don't sweat it, they won't gossip."

"Yeah, right," I scoffed. "People love to talk, especially about someone like you."

"This is my company," Brandon squeezed my hand. "I make the rules. If I can't control something this basic, how do you think I run this place?"

I noticed department heads already directing curious employees back to work. "Guess I was overthinking it."

"Let's meet some people," Brandon said, pulling out his phone. "James,get all department heads in the conference room. Ten minutes." There was a long pause on the other end. "Didn't you hear me?" Brandon's voice turned cool.

"Yes, sir!" James replied quickly. "I'll handle it right away!"

When the executives hurried into the conference room, their surprise was evident. Brandon sat in a side chair rather than at the head of the table,while I was positioned in the main seat. Brandon's hand remained linked with mine, and I could see the curiosity and confusion in everyone's eyes as they connected what they were seeing with the rumors already circulating about Brandon walking through the building hand-in-hand with me.

Their expressions were a mixture of surprise and confusion as they exchanged glances.

Brandon surveyed the room with calm authority, waiting until the last executive had taken their seat before he spoke. I could feel the weight of everyone's gaze, the silent questions hanging in the air.

This was it. No going back now.]
###Chapter 91: New Scandal

**Victoria's POV**

"That's all for today, Miss Taylor." Quinn's voice dripped with fake politeness asshe handed me the script. "Be sure to keep this copy safe.We wouldn't want you losing it again, would we?"

I forced a smile that felt like it might crack my face. The moment the studio door closed behind me, I let my perfect posture slump. Three goddamn hours of being treated like some desperate nobody! Me-Victoria Taylor-Hollywood's rising star and the future Mrs. Alexander Stark.

I stormed through the hallway and pushed through the exit doors, my Christian Louboutins clicking angrily on the pavement.

"How did it go?"Maya asked the second I slid into the backseat.

I threw the script against the opposite door with such force that pages scattered everywhere. "How do you think it went? They made me wait for over an hour! Then that nobody producer treated me like I was auditioning for a student film!"

"Victoria,please calm down. This script is important-"

"Calm down?" I whipped around to face her. "Did you see how that Quinn bitch talked to me?"

"They're testing you," Maya said, carefully arranging the script pages. "It's standard procedure after,.. everything that's happened.""Testing ME? I'm Victoria Taylor! I shouldn't have to jump through hoops for anyone, especially not for some second-rate producer who thinks she's hot shit just because she works for Brandon Stark!" Maya touched my arm. "Take a deep breath. Have some water and try to
relax."

"A small-time producer acting like she's running the show? Please!Brandon Stark himself didn't even have an attitude with me!"

"You're absolutely right!" Maya nodded enthusiastically. "And your performance was incredible. The way you immediately got into character with barely any preparation time? Victoria, your talent just keeps growing."

"My talent has always been exceptional," I corrected her,though I felt myself softening under the praise. "You're just now noticing?"

"No, no, it's always been exceptional, but now it's... transcendent.Who cares about Quinn? Remember who you know. You have Brandon Stark's personal support! Once this film helps you make your comeback, all those people trying to tear you down will be eating their words."

I leaned back against the leather seat, letting Maya's flattery soothe my bruised ego. She was right. This was just a temporary setback. With Brandon Stark backing me, I'd be back on top in no time.




I was halfway through a glass of Pinot Noir when I first saw it.

My name, trending at #1 on Twitter. Not unusual in itself-I was often trending for my roles or red carpet appearances. But these hashtags made my blood freeze.

#VictoriaExposed #FakeInnocence #TaylorGate With trembling fingers, I clicked on the first tag. Photos I thought had been destroyed years ago-me at 18 in a MIonaco hotel suite, straddling the lap of an Italian director. Another with two male models from my first European shoot, their hands places that made me want to vomit just looking at it now.

"No, no, no," I whispered, frantically scrolling through post after post."This can't be happening."

I was everywhere-Twitter, Instagram, entertainment blogs. The carefully cultivated image I'd spent years building was disintegrating before my eyes.

**BREAKING: Victoria Taylor's Good Girl Image SHATTERED**

**Taylor's European Escapades: The Photos She Didn't Want You to See**

My fingers flew across the screen as I desperately tried to understandI the scope of the disaster. My agent, publicist, the studio-why wasn't anyone calling me?

As if on cue, my phone lit up with my agency director's number.

"Patrick," I gasped, "thank God you called-"

"Victoria," he cut me off, his voice glacial. "I need you at the office. Now."


"It's almost midnight," I said, glancing at the clock.

"And yet somehow these photos of you are working overtime. Get here in thirty minutes or don't bother coming in at all." I jumped up, frantically searching for clothes. In the hallway, I nearly collided with my mother."Victoria!" Elizabeth's perfectly plucked eyebrows shot up in surprise." Where on earth are you going at this hour?""Mom, I can't talk now. Emergency at the agency. If any reporters or paparazzi show up at the house, don't open the door and don't answer any questions. Got it?"

"What? What's happened? Victoria-"

"Just promise me!" I begged,already backing toward the stairs.




"Look," Patrick said after hours of closed-door meetings, "I'm going to be straight with you, Victoria. This is bad. Really fucking bad."

"I can explain," I started, but he held up his hand.

"Save it. Those photos are genuinely you, aren't they?"


I swallowed hard."Yes,but-"

"Then there's nothing to explain." He sighed. "We'vebeen trying to contain this all night. It's not working. Whoever released these has serious resources behind them."

The sun was rising by the time I stumbled out of the meeting. Maya was waiting for me in the hallway, her usually perfect makeup smudged from her own sleepless night.

"Well?" She jumped to her feet. "What did they say? What's the plan?"

"There is no plan," I whispered. "They're 'assessing the situation.'Translation: they're going to let me drown." "That can't be right," Maya insisted. "They've invested too much in you!" My phone buzzed in my hand. Alexander's name flashed on the screen.

 "It's Alex," I whispered, showing her the screen before answering."Alex?" "What the actual fuck, Victoria?" His voice was razor-sharp."My phone's been blowing up since dawn with reporters asking for comments. You told me those rumors were all lies! Now there are fucking pictures everywhere!"

"Alex, please, you have to believe me," I pleaded, injecting a sob into my voice. "These aren't real-they're all fake. Someone's trying to destroy me!"

"Don't insult my intelligence," he hissed. "Those photos are clearly you.The same mole on your shoulder that I've seen a hundred times. You lied to my face,Victoria!"

"No, Alex, please!" Genuine panic seized me now. I couldn't lose Alexander-not when I needed the Stark connection more than ever. "This will blow over, I promise. I still have Brandon's support. You could talk to him again, convince him to help me more directly. Brandon will fix this!"

"Brandon?" His voice turned to ice. "You want me to beg Brandon for help again? Do you have any idea how humiliating that was the first time?



The call disconnected.

I turned to Maya, suddenly desperate. "You need to do something.Call in favors, hire a crsis team, anything! That's your job!"

Maya took a step back. "Victoria, I've been trying all night. I've called everyone I know. No one wants to touch this."

"Try harder!" I shrieked. "What kind of agent are you if you can't even handle one PR crisis? If you can't fix this, what good are you to me?""Victoria." Maya's voice turned cold. "I understand you're upset, but this is beyond anything I can control. The director himself has pulled back-what do you expect me to do that he can't?""Wait a second..." My eyes widened. "We need to find someone with enough influence to shut all this down!"
###Chapter 92: Like a Whore

**Victoria's POV**

Maya gave me that look-the one that said she thought I was being delusional. "Victoria, even your agency can't="

"Not them, you idiot!" I felt the first spark of hope I'd had in hours."Someone bigger. Someone with real power." I snapped my fingers rapidly,suddenly energized. "Maya, call Quinn. Tell her I need to-actually, forget it. I'll do it myself!"

I grabbed my phone, scrolling frantically through my contacts until I found Quinn Hall-Stark Entertainment's producer who'd treated me like garbage at my audition. The same Quinn who worked directly for Brandon Stark. The same Brandon Stark who could make this entire nightmare disappear with one phone call.

The phone rang four times before she picked up.

"Quinn Hall speaking." Her voice was cool and professional, with that hint of condescension I'd come to hate.

"Quinn! Hi, it's Victoria Taylor." I forced warmth into my voice, despite wanting to claw her eyes out just yesterday. "I was hoping we could meet?It's rather urgent."

There was a pause. "Miss Taylor," she finally said, her tone deliberaformal. "As you can imagine, I'm quite busy right now. And shouldn't you be dealing with your... publicity situation?" I bit back a sharp retort. The old Victoria would have put this bitch in her place,but desperate times called for desperate measures. "Quinn, please," I softened my voice, injecting just the right amount of vulnerability. "Those photos online-they're not what they seem, They've been manipulated, taken out of context. I just need a chance to explain.Could we meet? Or perhaps you could give me Brandon's contact information? Or even James would work!"

Another pause, longer this time. I could practically hear her internal eye-roll.

"Mr. Stark doesn't take personal calls, and I'm not authorized to share his contact information," she replied, her voice clipped. "As for James, he's unreachable at the moment."

"But this is important!" I insisted. struggling to keep the desperation from my voice. "Quinn, please. My career is on the line here!"

"Miss Taylor. I sympathize with your situation, but there's really nothing I can do." Her tone made it clear she didn't sympathize at all. "If you're still interested in the role, we can proceed with your reading next week.Assuming you're available, of course."

The dismissal was so casual, so cutting, that for a moment I couldn't respond. Was she serious? Treating me like just another actress while my entire life was falling apart?

"Of course I'm still interested," I managed, my throat tight. "I'll be there.Thank you,Quinn."

I hung up before she could say anything else, throwing my phone onto Maya's desk with enough force to make her jump."Fuck!" I screamed, not caring who heard me. "That cold-hearted bitch!" Maya looked up cautiously. "I take it that didn't go well?" "No shit!" I snarled, grabbing my purse. "Call my driver. I need to go to Fortune Corp." "Fortune Corp? But what about your parents-"

"Alex is my fiancé," I cut her off, already halfway to the door. "If anyone's going to help me, it's him. He has to."




Alexander's secretary tried to stop me, of course. Some mousy little thing whose name I'd never bothered to learn.

"Miss Taylor. Mr. Stark is in a meeting right now. If you could just-"

I brushed past her, heading straight for Alexander's office. "He'll see me."

"But Miss Taylor!" She scurried after me, her sensible shoes squeaking against the polished floor. "You can't just-"

I pushed open Alexander's door without knocking, ignoring her protests.Alexander looked up from his desk, his expression shifting from surprise to annoyance when he recognized me.

"Alex," I said breathlessly, "you have to help me this time!"

He frowned, glancing at his flustered secretary. "It's fine,Amy. You can go.



The moment the door closed behind her, I dropped the desperate act and switched to full seduction mode. I locked the door with a soft click,then turned to face Alexander, letting my coat slip from my shoulders to reveal the skimpy dress underneath. His eyes widened slightly-a good sign. "Alex," I whispered, slinking toward him. "You have to believe me. Those photos aren't real. Someone's out to ruin me." I circled his desk, catching his eyes as they dropped to my plunging neckline, my tits practically spilling out. Men were so fucking predictable. "Sabotage?" Alexander scoffed, but the raw lust in his stare betrayed him as I perched on the edge of his desk. "Victoria, don't play me for an idiot.Some of those shots are obviously old-you look barely twenty. Tell me the truth. Were you really-"

"Alex." I cut him off, sliding onto his lap and wrapping my arms around his neck, pressing my body flush against his. "I'm serious about us. You know that. How could I be that kind of slut?" I ground against him,feeling his cock stiffen instantly under me. "Those photos are fake. Okay,maybe one or two are me, but they're from movie scenes! Check them yourself if you don't believe me!"

I buried my face in his neck, letting my tears soak his skin. Guys like Alexander couldn't resist a gorgeous woman in distress-especially one rubbing her pussy against their throbbing hard-on.

"I need you," I purred into his ear, my hand slipping down to grip his swollen dick through his pants, stroking it slow and firm. "Only you can save me now."

Alexander groaned, his fingers knotting in my hair. "Fuck, Vicky... it's the middle of the goddamn workday..."

I'd never let him call me Vicky before-I despised that nickname-but now I just smirked against his skin. "No one will know," I cooed, sliding off his lap and dropping to my knees.I yanked his zipper down, and his thick cock sprang free, veins bulging,the tip already glistening with precum. "Please, Alex. Let me show you how much I need you right now."His grip tightened in my hair,pulling hard. "Yeah, I know, Vicky! Hurry up! Suck it now!"

I flashed a triumphant grin before lowering my head, knowing I had him by the balls-literally. Men were so easy to twist when you knew how to work them. I wrapped my lips around his fat cock, swallowing it deep, my tongue swirling around the head, throat squeezing him tight. I fucking hated every second of it, but I moaned like a porn star, bobbing my head fast and sloppy until he bucked and came hard, grunting as his hot,salty
load flooded my mouth.

After, I climbed back into his lap, straddling his thighs like a cheap whore,my skirt hiked up to my waist, soaked panties grinding against him.

"Alex," I said softly, pressing a gentle kiss to his jaw. "I'm sorry about everything. This was all my fault."

He stroked my hair absently, his expression distant. "I understand. I'll talk to Brandon again, but this is the last time, Victoria."

I kissed him properly, hiding my triumph. "Thank you. I love you,Alex."
I shifted suggestively against him. "Do you want more?"

Alexander's eyes darkened momentarily before he shook his head."Tonight. Not here."
###Chapter 93: Slavery

**Victoria's POV**

I paced outside Stark Tower, checking my phone obsessively. My entire career hung by a thread, and Alexander had been inside talking to Brandon for over an hour. When he finally emerged, I rushed forward.

"Alex! What happened? Did Brandon agree?"

Alex nodded, his expression unreadable. "He did."

Relief flooded through me. I threw myself at him, wrapping my arms around his neck.

"I knew it! Thank you, thank you!" I kissed him passionately, not caring who saw us.

Alex pushed me away. "Victoria, not here."

"Sorry. I'm just so happy! So what's the plan?"

"Don't celebrate yet," Alex warned. "He agreed to help, but there's a condition. You need to sign with Stark Entertainment."

I froze. "Sign with Stark Entertainment? But I'm already under contract with Horizon." "That's his requirement. My uncle made it clear-he helps family, not strangers. He's not going to clean up your image just so another agency can profit."*Family*. That word changed everything. If I signed with his company, I'd be under Brandon Stark's protection. "Fine," I decided immediately. "I'll break my contract with Horizon right now." Alex looked surprised. "Just like that?"

"What's there to think about? Horizon is practically a boutique agency compared to Stark Entertainment! Brandon Stark runs half of Wall Street.If I'm connected to him, my career won't just recover-it'll skyrocket!"

"So you're in?"

"Tell Brandon I accept. One hundred percent."

Breaking my contract with Horizon proved harder than expected. My agent's boss, was infuriatingly smug.

"Victoria, we've invested millions in your career," he reminded me."Your damaged brand doesn't invalidate our agreement."

"With the current publicity. I'm worthless to Horizon."

"Perhaps. But we'd still take a substantial loss by releasing you."


"Name your price," I challenged.

He named a figure so outrageous I nearly choked. "That's fucking insane!"

This dragged on through multiple meetings, with my parents and Alex eventually joining. Horizon wouldn't budge-until suddenly, after a mysterious phone call, the boss changed his tune.

"We've reconsidered. We're prepared to release you for a reasonable termination fee." I knew Brandon must have pulled strings. The "reasonable" fee still hurt,but my parents and Alex covered it. By day's end, I was free.Walking into Stark Entertainment felt different this time. This wasn't just another audition; this was my salvation.

James Wilson greeted me in the conference room, placing a thick document between us.

"This is your contract. Once signed, we can address your publicity concerns."

I reached for a pen immediately. What did details matter when my career was imploding?

"Miss Taylor. you're signing without reading?" James asked, eyebrow raised.

I flashed my most winning smile. "Mr. Wilson, I trust you completely.Given my situation, I'm grateful anyone would take a chance on me."

"While I appreciate your confidence, I must insist you review it first. We'll be colleagues, and I'd hate for misunderstandings to arise later."

Something in his tone made me pause. I started reading, and my stomach dropped. By page three, my hands were shaking with rage.

"What the fuck is this?" I slapped the contract down. "These terms are completely one-sided!"

James remained infuriatingly calm. "I believe I suggested you read it first."

"But you didn't warn me it would be this bad!" I flipped through frantically. "This isn't a contract-it's slavery!" The terms were brutal: For five years, Stark Entertainment would rebuild my career, but I wouldn't see a penny from my first year's earnings.I couldn't date anyone, couldn't attend industry events without permission,and if I violated any term, I'd owe them 50% of my potential five-year earnings. "This contract is invalid. It's completely unfair!"

"Invalid?" James's voice hardened. "A signature makes a contract quite valid,regardless of whether you read it. That's basic business."

"I'm related to the Stark family," I tried desperately. "Mr. Stark wouldn't do this to me!"

"Which Mr. Stark are you referring to?" James asked coolly.

He gathered his papers. "I understand if you need time to reconsider.However, our offer to help with your PR issue was contingent on signing with us. So if you're declining..."

"Wait!" I called as he reached the door. As brutal as these terms were,what choice did I have?

"I'll sign," I said through gritted teeth. "But you need to fix my situation immediately. And I want guarantees about my role in the film-significant screen time and the best scenes."

James smiled thinly. "Follow the rules, and everything will work out fine.Don't you agree?"

I forced myself to nod. "Yes."

True to their word, Stark Entertainment worked quickly. Within hours, the most damaging photos vanished from major sites. Their social media announced me as their newest talent, and the film's account revealed details about my character-a complex villain with a tragic backstory.

Most impressively, they proved the explicit photos were actually from a European art film I'd shot years ago. I could finally breathe again.

Mom appeared in my doorway that evening. "Victoria,is everything okay?Did something happen with Brandon?" "No, Mom, everything's fine," I assured her. "Brandon came through, and P've signed with Stark Entertainment. It's all taken care of."

I didn't mention the brutal contract terms.

"Alex really came through for me,"I added.

"Of course he did," Mom sat beside me. "He's your fiancé. But Victoria,you need to be smarter from now on. Whatever happened in the past needs to stay buried."

I nodded. thinking about how I'd secured Alex's cooperation in his office.

"But Mom, we still have a problem with Grandpa's shares. Summer can't be allowed to keep them."

"I know!" Mom's face hardened. "Your grandfather has lost his mind,but your father and I see clearly. We know who's truly family."

"My concern," she continued, "is that Summer might have already sold those shares."

I laughed. "Mom, don't worry. Summer's not that stupid. She's spent her entire life coveting Grandpa's attention and assets. She's never given up anything-not her toys, not Grandpa and Professor Thompson's affection,not even Alexander!"

I gripped Mom's hands tightly. "Now that she finally has those shares,she'Il want to gloat. We'll find a way to take them back. We absolutely *will*get those shares back. No matter what it takes."
###Chapter 94: What a Married Man Should Noti ce
**Brandon's POV**

I adjusted my tie as the face of Edward Blackwell, CEO of one of London's largest investment firms, stared back at me from my laptop screen. The poor bastard looked exhausted - unsurpising given it was nearly midnight in London. But that was his problem, not mine. When Stark Group called,you answered,regardless of the hour.

"As I was saying, Brandon," Edward continued, his British accent more pronounced with fatigue, "the regulatory changes present some challenges,but nothing insurmountable if we-"

A soft knock interrupted us. I glanced up to see the door crack open slightly.

"Sorry, come in!" I called out, turning back to the screen. "Edward, let's call it a day."

"Something urgent?" I asked, leaning back in my chair.

"Mr. Stark, this is regarding Victoria's contract," James replied,his expression carefully neutral as he placed a folder on my desk.

I flipped it open to see Victoria Taylor's signature scrawled at the bottom of our most stringent talent contract. "She signed? Without pushback?"

"She was absolutely livid," James's lips twitched slightly. "Didn't even read it before signing. When she finally did, she nearly had a meltdown right there in the conference room."

I couldn't help but smirk. "I expected at least some negotiation.Handle the rest as you see fit," "Yes. Mr. Stark." James hesitated before continuing."I met someone today who might interest you."

"Who?"

"Victoria's manager, Maya Coleman. She was with Horizon but wasn't included when Victoria terminated her contract there." James's efficiency was evident as he continued without prompting. "Horizo released Victoria.However, they left Maya hanging without any direction. Since she's already familiar with Victoria's... peculiarities, I thought she might continue serving as Victoria's manager under our umbrella."

I waved dismissively. "Use your judgment on these trivial matters."

"Of course." James straightened slightly. "There's one more thing."


"Go on."

"Regarding Mrs. Stark's former apartment... she never officially terminated her lease, so the landlord has been holding it for her." James shifted his weight slightly - a tell that what he was about to say required my attention."The landlord contacted me today inquiring about Mrs. Stark's whereabouts. I'd previously instructed him to alert me of anything unusual.He reports someone has been loitering around Mrs. Stark's apartment frequently."

My fingers stilled on the desk. "What exactly did the landlord say?" "He asked if Mrs. Stark might have 'gotten into trouble with someone.' He's taken photographs and wanted to know if he should call the police next time." "Absolutely call the police," I said, my tone hardening. "Unidentified individuals lurking around private property should be handled by law enforcement. That's what taxpayers fund them for, after all." "T've already instructed the landlord accordingly." James paused, clearly weighing his next words. "There's more. Elizabeth Taylor-Mrs. Stark's mother-also visited the apartment.

When she didn't find Mrs. Stark there, she apparently left in a rage,spewing quite vicious remarks about her daughter."

My jaw tightened. "Noted."

I shifted gears, turning the conversation to another pressing matter. "When is Alexander and Victoria's wedding scheduled?"

James looked surprised by the question. "I don't believe Alexander has made any concrete plans yet."

"Then give him the motivation to do so. I want them married immediately.



James's momentary hesitation spoke volumes about his opinion of Alexander Stark, but he simply nodded. "Ill handle it, sir."

A soft knock interrupted us again, and Summer's head peeked around the door, her expression curious as she took in the scene.

"Am I interrupting? Are you still working?" she asked, her eyes moving between James and me.

"Not at all," James replied quickly, gathering his papers. "I was just finishing my report." He suddenly straightened as if remembering something urgent. "Actually,I just recalled another matter that needs my attention. Mr. Stark, Mrs. Stark,I should be going." "Wait," Summer called as he headed for the door. "I made dinner. James,you're welcome to join us before you leave.""You're too kind. Mrs. Stark," James declined with practiced politeness,"
but I really must attend to this matter immediately. Please enjoy your meal without me. Good evening to you both."

I caught the flash of confusion on June's face as James made his hasty exit.She turned to me with a puzzled expression once the door closed behind him.

"Was he in a hurry for a reason? Did you assign him something urgent?"she asked.approaching my desk.

"Nothing out of the ordinary," I answered, watching as her eyes fell on the open folder.

"Is that Victoria's contract?" She picked it up, eyes widening as she scanned the contents. "I'm not reading this wrong, am I?"

"What do you think?" I couldn't help but smile at her shocked expression.

"But... Victoria is one of the shrewdest people I know. This is clearly an unequal contract. How did she possibly agree to this?"

"What's unequal for you might not be for her," I said simply, rising from my chair and placing my hand at the small of her back.

"What did you make for dinner?" I asked, guiding her toward the door.

"Just some light dishes," she replied, momentarily distracted. "I noticed you've been coughing lately. You refuse to goto bed early or take medicine, so I figured I'd at least try to help through your diet."

"Don't change the subject," she added quickly, her sharp mind returning to our previous topic. "What do you mean it might not be unequal for Victoria? What's her situation?"
 
"Think about what position she's in right now," I suggested as we made our way downstairs.

The dining room was impeccably set, with several dishes laid out-all noticeably bland and healthy-looking. I couldn't help but grimace slightly.

"June,this meal looks... extremely light."

"If you'd just take your medicine like a normal person. I wouldn't have to resort to this," she retorted, a hint of challenge in her eyes.

I laughed softly, pulling out her chair. "Perhaps I should start considering what a married man needs to pay attention to."

Her eyebrow arched delicately as she sat down. "Oh really? And what might that be?"

"That when your wife starts monitoring your diet," I said, leaning down to kiss her forehead, "it means she genuinely cares about your health."

She blushed slightly but met my gaze directly. "Someone has to look after you,since you clearly won't do it yourself."

Later, as June described her progress learning the entertainment industry through James's reports, I realized I'd been absentmindedly rubbing my thumb over her knuckles. These small intimacies had become second nature, happening without conscious thought. Perhaps that, I reflected,was what a married man shouId truly notice - not just when his wife was trying to improve his health, but how fundamentally his life had changed for the better with her in it.
###Chapter 95: Time for a Fresh Start

**Summer's POV**

The past week had been a blur of hospital visits and quiet evenings at the Hamptons. Ever since Grandpa collapsed, my life had narrowed to Brandon's estate and Manhattan General. I hadn't set foot in Fortune Corp since quitting.

Grandpa had been stuck in that hospital bed for a week, and I'd visited him every chance I got. Since telling him about marrying Brandon,he'd been dead-set on meeting my husband properly.

"How's it looking?" Brandon appeared behind me, his hand settling on my waist.

"Six hours and counting," I replied. "Think that's enough?"

Brandon tasted a spoonful. nodding approvingly. "Perfect. The longer you simmer, the better the flavor. George will love it."

I filled a thermos, screwing the lid tight. "God, I hope this helps. He's been cooped up way too long."

"When he's feeling better, we'll make time for that proper introduction,"Brandon said. "I'm actually looking forward to it."




The antiseptic smell hit me the moment I stepped off the elevator at Manhattan General. Halfway down the corridor, a familiar figure blocked my path-Elizabeth Taylor, arms crossed and eyes cold.

"Well, look who finally showed up," she snapped, her mmanicured fingers suddenly digging into my arm. "You ungrateful little brat, you can't even say hello to your own mother?" I yanked my arm free. "Mom." The word felt hollow.

Her eyes narrowed. "Is that your attitude now? After everything we've done for you?"

"If there's nothing else, I should go in. I brought Grandpa some soup."

"You're not going anywhere," Elizabeth blocked my path. "Tell me the truth about those shares. Did you really give them away?"

I laughed incredulously. "Wasn't I clear enough the other day? You were right there."

"Don't get smart with me," she hissed.

"Look, I already told you-as long as Capital Corp's ownership stays unchanged,may portion won't cause problems. But if anyone tries to mess with the structure..."

"How dare you!" Elizabeth's voice rose. "Capital Corp has nothing to do with you! Who the hell did you give those shares to? How much did they pay you?"

"It doesn't matter," I replied. "The shares were Grandpa's to give, and now they're mine to manage."

Elizabeth's hand shot up, ready to strike. I jerked backward, dodging the slap. The door to Grandpa's room swung open, and George Taylor stood there, leaning on his cane,face flushed with anger. "That's enough!" Grandpa shouted. "What the hell do you think you're doing,Elizabeth? You'd hit your own daughter right in front of me?" Elizabeth paled. "George, you don't understand-Summer betrayed this family! She gave your shares to some outsider!" I yanked my arm free. "Mom." The word felt hollow.

Her eyes narrowed. "Is that your attitude now? After everything we've done for you?"

"If there's nothing else, I should go in. I brought Grandpa some soup."

"You're not going anywhere," Elizabeth blocked my path. "Tell me the truth about those shares. Did you really give them away?"

I laughed incredulously. "Wasn't I clear enough the other day? You were right there."

"Don't get smart with me," she hissed.

"Look. I already told you-as long as Capital Corp's ownership stays unchanged,my portion won't cause problems. But if anyone tries to mess with the structure..."

"How dare you!" Elizabeth's voice rose. "Capital Corp has nothing to do with you! Who the hell did you give those shares to? How much did they pay you?"

"It doesn't matter," I replied. "The shares were Grandpa's to give,and now they're mine to manage."

Elizabeth's hand shot up, ready to strike.

I jerked backward, dodging the slap. The door to Grandpa's room swung open, and George Taylor stood there, leaning on his cane, face flushed with anger.

"That's enough!" Grandpa shouted. "What the hell do you think you're doing, Elizabeth? You'd hit your own daughter right in front of me?"

Elizabeth paled. "George, you don't understand-Summer betrayed this family! She gave your shares to some outsider!" Grandpa snorted. "Summer, come here, sweetheart."

I smoothed my sleeve and moved to his side, taking his arm. "You shouldn't be up. Grandpa. Let me help you back."

"I'm fine," he waved me off. "Been lying around too damn much anyway."

He turned to Elizabeth, his expression hardening. "Those shares were mine to give, and I gave them to Summer. What she does with them is her business." His voice was steel. "And as for outsiders-I think we both know who the real traitors are in this family."

Elizabeth gasped. "We would never let Capital Corp shares leave the family!
11

"Wouldn't you?" Grandpa laughed coldly. "Don't think I don't see what's happening just because I'm old."

"That's not fair! Our shares remain with the Taylors. It's Summer who won't even tell us who she's given control to!"

"Enough!" Grandpa cut her off. "Instead of worrying about Summer.maybe focus on keeping Victoria out of the tabloids. Summer doesn't need your 'concern'anymore."

"Now," he added firmly, "I need to rest. You should leave."

Elizabeth stood with fists clenched before finally storming toward the elevator.

Back in the hospital room, I helped Grandpa settle into his chair and unpacked the thermos.

"You shouldn't stress yourself out, Grandpa," I said, pouring the broth.'s not good for your recovery."
F%
Grandpa chuckled, "You moved pretty quick back there. Not such a pushover anymore,huh?"

I sighed. "She's still my mother. I may have dodged her this time,but she Il find other opportunities."

"Let's drop it," I added, handing him the soup. "Try this instead. Made it specially for you this morning."

Grandpa took a spoonful, his face lighting up. "It's good! Your cooking gets better every time."

"I'm glad you like it. Brandon suggested simmering it longer for more flavor."

"Brandon. Brandon," Grandpa's eyes twinkled. "Sounds like that young man is taking good care of you."

I felt heat creep into my cheeks. "He is."

Grandpa studied me. "You've been here almost every day. Don't you have work?"

I hesitated. "Actually, I'm not at Fortune Corp anymore."

"What?" Grandpa straightened. "What happened?"

I explained briefly-the accusations, being stripped of responsibilities.my resignation.

"Those bastards," Grandpa muttered, "Alexander thinks he can treat my granddaughter like this?"

"It doesn't matter," I assured him. "I was planning to quit anyway. Things were too awkward with Alexander, and Victoria's constant hostility... I just needed out." Grandpa squeezed my hand. "I'm sorry, kiddo. I know how much that job
 meant to you."

I shrugged, fighting the pang of loss. "Some people just aren't worth the effort. Time for a fresh start."

"So what's next?" Grandpa asked. "Any plans?"

"Taking some time off first. Don't worry, I'll figure something out."

"And what does your husband think about all this?"

"Brandon wants me to work at Stark Group," I said with a small smile. "It's a great opportunity,but..."

"But what?"

"I want to earn my position. Not just get it because I'm the boss's wife."

Grandpa chuckled. "Smart man, that Brandon. Stark Group would be lucky to have you." He took another spoonful of soup before asking,"Those Capital Corp shares-do you really not regret giving them up?"

The question caught me off guard. "Are you having second thoughts,Grandpa?"
###Chapter 96: He Is Leagues Ahead of You

**Summer's POV**

Grandpa's eyes crikled at the corners. "This child! Those shares were given to you, so they're yours to dispose of however you wish. I just want to make sure you thought this through. This Brandon Stark..."

"Grandpa, please don't worry," I squeezed his hand. "Brandon is nothíng like Alexander. He's good to me. And trust me, he doesn't need Capital Corp shares."

He nodded slowly. "Capital Corp is nothing compared to Stark Group, I'm old but I know that." His voice softened. "I just want you to be happy,Summer."

"I know what you mean," I smiled. "Actually, Brandon made it clear that while the shares are in his name, they're still mine. And honestly, I got the better deal. Not only did I exchange them for Stark Entertainment shares.but he also gave me some of his own. I'm actually the largest shareholder of Stark Entertainment now."

Grandpa's eyebrows shot up. "You're the majority shareholder of Stark Entertainment?"

I nodded, unable to suppress a smile at his shocked expression.

"Wel1. that eases my mind," he sighed. "Summer, when will you bring him to meet me properly? I need to size up this man who's stolen my granddaughter's heart."

"Soon!" I promised. "As soon as you're discharged."

"Good1, good!" Grandpa nodded, a genuine smile lighting his tired face.

The doctor arrived, insisting Grandpa needed rest. I kissed his forehead'and promised to return tomorrow.

I stepped out of the hospital into the bright midday sun, too distracted to notice the clicking sounds from nearby bushes. I'd been followed since entering the hospital.

"Summer."

I froze at Alexander's voice. He stood directly in my path, immaculate in his designer suit. The shock made me stumble, and my thermos clattered to the pavement.

I quickly crouched to retrieve it before Alexander could help,stepping around him as I rose.

"Summer, what areyou doing?" Alexander's voice carried that familiar exasperation. "Do we really have to be like this?"

"Like what?" I replied coldly. "Mr. Stark, would you please move aside?"

"I heard what happened. Why didn't you come to me?"

"What are you talking about? Come to you for what?"

"You know exactly what I mean. The company situation." His voice lowered. "The leaked files. Was it really you who-"

"Does it matter?" I cut him off. "Why would you care what happens to me?Does it actually matter if I leaked those files or not?"

Alexander's brow furrowed. "Of course it matters. You're-"

"Enough, Alexander. I don't have the energy for this conversation."

"Summer!" He grabbed my arm. "Can't we just talk? Why are you always so hostile? Have you forgotten what we used to have?" What we used to have?" I laughed humorlessly, pulling free."I've forgotten all about it."
I stepped back, voice icy. "Mr. Stark, remember your current posítion. We're nothing more than in-laws now. I'll handle my Fortune Corp issues myself."
Alexander's jaw tightened. "Summer. I've told you about Victoria and me.I don't love her,I-"

"Whether you love her is none of my business," I cut him off. "You chose her, so be good to her. Stop saying these things to me."

The memory of his words at the Plaza Hotel engagement flickered through my mind-his declaration that he'd always loved Victoria.
"You think you're blameless?" Alexander's voice hardened. "You never had your parents' affection or family shares. You have no standing in your own family. You never fought for anything."

He stepped closer. "If you'd had Victoria's position in the family,if you'd had shares in Capital Corp, it would be us getting engaged. I wouldn't have needed to marry Victoria. We were good together."

I stared at him, genuinely stunned. "So this is all my fault? That's the funniest thing I've ever heard."

Anger bubbled up inside me. "You're a grown man with Fortune Corp behind you. Yet here you are with the most pathetic mindset. Do you need a woman's shares to validate yourself? I didn't have shares, Victoria did, so you chose her? Fine. But blaming me? Only men wvithout real ability need to climb on a woman's back. I thought you were different,but clearly..."

I shook my head. "With the same last name, Mr. Brandon Stark is leagues ahead of you." Alexander's face turned red. "What? You're comparing me to Brandon Stark? What does he have? Just family backing and Stark Group. Without those,he'd be just like me."

"No," I said coldly. "You're nothing alike, and you're not worthy of comparison. Brandon has so much more than just his family name and company."

"You seem to know him well. What's your relationship with him?"

"Nothing special. I just think you're absolutely pathetic."

I glanced over his shoulder. "For someone of your stature, causing a scene outside a hospital isn't smart. You may not be famous, but your fiancée certainly is."

Alexander followed my gaze to where a camera flash had gone off. His face paled.

Taking advantage of his distraction, I slipped into my car and sped away,leaving him choking on exhaust fumes as he ran after the photographer.

Safely away. I pulled over and called Brandon. He picked up immediately,his voice unusually gentle. "Hello?"

In the background, I heard muffledI meeting sounds.

"Hi," I replied, hesitating. "I visited Grandpa todlay. I ran into two people."

"People who upset you?" Brandon asked,his tone shifting slightly.

"Yeah. My mom and Alexander, as expected." I admitted, tension releasing at the sound of his voice.

"What did they do?" The dangerous edge in his words was unmistakable.
1%
"It's not a big deal. But when I was leaving, someone was following me and took photos. I've been thinking about who might have it out for me.and besides Victoria and her crew, I can't think of anyone. Could it be her?


There was a brief commotion on Brandon's end, then his voice came through more clearly. "It's okay. I'll handle this. They won't dare do anything to you."

###Chapter 97:Sex

**Brandoni's POV**

"I'm not worried or anything," her voice came through, attempting casual but I caught the uanderlying tension. "Just thought you should know someone's been trailing me. No clue what they're after with these photos!"

"Hmm," I responded, keeping my tone neutral while my mind was already running through possibilities. The timing was too perfect to be coincidental.

Right on cue, my email notification pinged. I opened the message to find several photographs attached - Summer and Alexander outside Manhattan General. The angles were deliberately chosen to suggest intimacy. a carefully orchestrated setup that could easily be misinterpreted.

"Are you heading home now?" I asked.

"No." Summer sighed, and I could picture her pacing, that little crease forming between her brows. "I'm just out wandering around. Nothing urgent." There was a pause. "Oh, you're in the middle of something,aren't you? Don't worry about this now. We can talk when you're home."

I allowed myself a small smile at her consideration. "Not necessary. I'm not busy."

I caught James's eye as he approached with another stack of documents.I held up a finger, signaling him to wait.

"Was there something else?" I asked Summer, turning away from the window.

"Not really," she replied, her voice brightening slightly. "Just wondering what you want for dinner tonight? I could pick up some groceries."

Such a simple domestic question, yet it sent a surprising warmth through me. These little moments of normalcy with Summer were becoming increasingly precious.

"Whatever you'd like,"I told her. "Head home after shopping if you're bored out there. Or you could meet up with Ruby and Scarlett."

"Sounds good," she said, sounding more relaxed. "See you tonight."

After ending the call, I gestured for James to approach. "Mr. Stark,these are the key points I compiled from the meeting," he said, handing me the documents.

I turned to my computer, examining the photographs more carefully. The setup was amateurish but effective - Summer and Alexander, seemingly in a heated discussion that could easily be misinterpreted as intimate by viewers unaware of context.

"Send these photographs to Victoria," I instructed James, my decision made.

James didn't question the order, merely nodding. "Right away, sir."




I arrived home, the Hamptons estate quiet except for the sound of running water from the master bathroom. Summer was showering, oblivious to my presence. Her phone lay on the nightstand, screen lighting up with an incoming call.

Alexander Stark.

My eyes narrowed at the name flashing on the display. I picked up the device, watching it fall silent only to start ringing again seconds later. The persistence was telling.

I settled on the edge of the bed, phone in hand, waiting. The shower stopped, and she emerged, a towel barely clinging to her wet skin,thedamp fabric outlining every curve-her full breasts straining against it,nipples poking through. Water dripped down her body, sliding over her collarbone, tracing the valley between her tits, and trickling down her flat stomach to disappear into the shadowed cleft between her thighs.Her hair hung in soaked strands, clinging to her neck, and she froze when she saw me, her lips parting in a soft gasp.

"What's going on?" she asked, eyes dropping to her phone in my hand.

I extended it toward her without comment, watching her reaction carefully.Her face hardened immediately upon seeing Alexander's name. She declined the call without hesitation.

When it rang again, her irritation was palpable as she hit decline once more. Rather than questioning her about Alexander, I focused on something more immediate.

"Why didn't you dry your hair? You'll catch cold." The sight of her damp hair clinging to her neck stirred something protective in me.

I retrieved a fresh towel from the bathroom. "Come here," I said,gesturing to the spot in front of me.

"Um..." She hesitated, fidgeting with the edge of her towel.

"Come," I repeated, patting the bed more firmly.She perched where I'd indicated, her body stiff, the air between us buzzing with unspoken heat. I moved behind her, pressing the towel to her hair.but my hands quickly strayed, sliding down her neck, fingers brushing the tops of her breasts where the towel barely held. Her skin was hot and slick,and she shivered as I tugged the fabric loose, letting it fall to her hips,baring her completely-her tits round and heavy, nipples tight and dusky,begging for my mouth. Yet her phone lit up yet again with Alexander's call. "For fuck's sake," she muttered, declining the call and immediately blocking the number. She tossed the phone aside with evident frustration."There.Problem solved."

She turned to face me, searching my expression. "Aren't you going to say something?"

I allowed myself a slight smile. "What should I say?"

"I don't know... I thought you might be annoyed or something." She bit her lip in that way that always drew my attention.

"Why would I be?" I asked simply. Alexander Stark was a non-entity in my world, a minor annoyance at most. His desperate attempts to contact Summer only confirmed what I already knew - he'd realized too late what he'd lost.

"I have no idea why he's suddenly calling me," she sighed, some of the tension leaving her shoulders.
"If you don't know, then don't worry about it," I told her,pleased by her obvious disinterest in her ex-fiancé. "You've blocked him now. He won't bother you anymore."

She studied me with curious eyes. "You're so... chill about everything. That's not a bad thing! I just wonder sometimes what it would take to actually get you worked up. Like, does anything ever make you truly angry?"Instead of answering that loaded question, I pressed her down and began gently massaging her body. Her immediate relaxation into my touch was gratifying, a wordless trust that meant more than she likely realized. "Mmm, that feels amazing, you could make a fortune running a massage place, you know." she murmured, her head tipping back, eyes fluttering shut as she leaned into my touch. My cock throbbed, straining against my pants as I pictured her writhing beneath me. I dropped the towel,my hands roaming freely now, cupping her breasts, squeezing the soft flesh until she gasped, her nipples hardening further between my fingers as I rolled them,tugging lightly.

"You think I should open a massage parlor?" I rasped, my voice thick with desire as I pinched her nipples harder, watching her squirm.
She twisted to face me, a sly grin lighting her face. "Definitely. But with only one customer allowed-me."

"Brat," I chuckled, tapping her nose, but the mischief in her eyes shattered my restraint. She reached up, clawing at my face, whining, "Come down a little!" When I stayed out of reach, she huffed, "Don't slack off!"

That bossy tone snapped me. I flung the towel aside and seized her face,my thumbs digging into her cheeks as I slammed my mouth onto hers.She gasped, and I plunged my tongue inside, tasting her-sweet and wet and desperate. I palmed her tits, kneading them roughly, then dragged one hand lower, cupping her pussy-already drenched, her folds slick and swollen under my fingers. I groaned into her mouth, rubbing her clit in slow, teasing círcles until she whimpered, her hips bucking against my hand.
###Chapter 98: We Need to Rest Now

**Brandon's POV**

"Brandon..." Summer moaned, her fingers fumbling with my shirt, tearing it open to rake her nails down my chest, leaving red trails that burned deliciously. I hissed, my cock aching as Igripped her hips and yanked her onto my lap, her thighs spreading wide to straddle me. She ground against me, her soaked cunt soaking my pants, the heat of her searing through the fabric. I shoved her back onto the bed, tearing off my clothes in a frenzy-shirt, belt. pants gone in seconds, my cock springing free, thick and pulsing,precum already beading at the tip.

Summer spread her legs, her pussy glistening-pink and puffy, dripping with arousal, the sight making my mouth water. I crawled over her,pinning her wrists above her head with one hand, my other guiding my cock to her entrance. I teased her first, dragging the head through her slick folds, coating myself in her juices, tapping her clit until she writhed,begging. "Please... now..."

I didn't make her wait long. I thrust in slow, deliberately, stretching her tight cunt inch by inch, savoring the way she clenched around me,her walls fluttering as I filled her. She moaned, loud and raw, her legs wrapping around my waist to pull me deeper. I pulled back, almost out.then slammed back in, hard and deep, making her tits bounce with the force. Her nails dug into my shoulders as I set a brutal pace, fucking her with long, punishing strokes, the wet slap of our bodies echoing in the room.

Her pussy gripped me like a vise, hot and slippery, and I angled my hips,hitting that spot inside her that made her scream, her head thrashing against the pillows. Sweat slicked our skin, her thighs trembling as I drove into her, relentless, my balls slapping against her ass with every thrust.I leaned down, sucking a nipple into my mouth, biting down just hard 
enough to make her arch, her cries sharpening as I flicked my tongue over the sensitive bud, then moved to the other, leaving wet, red marks on her pale skin.
"Brandon... oh God..." she panted, her hands clawing at my back, urging me faster. I flipped her over without warning, yanking her hips up so her ass was in the air, her face pressed into the sheets. I spread her cheeks,admiring the sight-her pussy dripping, my cock glistening with her wetness-before plunging back in, deeper this time, the new angle letting me bottom out. She sobbed into the mattress, her ass jiggling with each brutal thrust, and I fisted her hair, pulling her head back to hear her moans clearer, the sound driving me wild.

I reached around, finding her clit, rubbing it in tight, fast circles as I fucked her senseless, her body shaking under me. She came hard,her cunt spasming around my cock,a gush of wetness soaking my thighs, her walls milking me so tight I nearly lost it. But I held on, slowing my thrusts,dragging it out, letting her ride the aftershocks-her body twitching,her breath ragged-before picking up again, chasing my own release.

I pounded into her, my grip bruising her hips, the tension coil my gut. Her pussy fluttered again, a second orgasm build growled, "Come with me," my voice rough and commanding.S her cries peaking as her cunt clenched one last time, pulling m edge. I roared,slamming into her as I came, my cock pulsing, sp thick ropes of cum deep inside her, filling her until it leaked out, drip down her thighs in messy, white streaks. We collapsed, her sweat-slicked body sprawled across mine, my softening cock still inside her, our mixed fluids staining the sheets. Her chest heaved against me, her tits pressed into my skin, and I traced lazy circles over her back, her hair fanning across my chest, dry now from our heat. The room smelled of sex-musky and primal-and I was lost in the filthy bliss of it when her phone buzzed, slicing through the haze. "Unknown number. Tired?" I kissed the corner of her mouth gently. "Rest a bit. I'll carry you to the shower in a moment."

Summer's eyes closed drowsily as she nodded like a sleepy chick. "Mmm."

I swiped to answer the call and immediately heard Alexander's voice coming through the speaker.

"Summer, you finallypicked up? Is this really necessary? We just had an argument. It's bad enough you wouldn't let me in, but calling the police?Summer.you-"

My eyes narrowed as I glanced at Summer, who had already fallen asleep within seconds. I carefully laid her down on the bed and was about to step away when her hand suddenly caught mine. "Where are you going?"she mumbled, her voice thick with sleep.

I chuckled softly, reaching out to smooth her furrowed brow. "Go to sleep.I'm not going anywhere."
"Who are you? Why are you with Summer?" Alexander's angry voice came through the phone as he heard our exchange. He must have caught Summer's sleepy murmur because his tone immediately darkened. "Who the hell is this?"

I narrowed my eyes and ended the call without a word.

Alexander called back almost immediately. I silenced the phone, watching the screen light up with his pathetic attempts to reconnect. Let him try.I had more important matters to attend to.

When the bathroom door opened, Summer stirred again. The phone rang once more, and this time she reached for it before I could intervene.

"Hello?" she answered groggily. "Who is this?" I watched her expression change as she recognized the voice, her drowsiness rapidly clearing. Her eyes darted toward me standing in the doorway, then back to the unfamiliar number on her screen.

"Alexander, are you insane?" she snapped, suddenly fully awake. "What's the point ofcalling from different numbers in the middle of the night?What's wrong with you?"

I leaned against the doorframe, observing her growing irritation. Her lips pressed together in a thin line as she listened.

"Enough. You're being ridiculous," she cut him off. "I never called the police. And by the way, that was my husband who answered. It's none of your business. Goodnight." She hung up and tossed the phone aside,burying her face in the pillow.
The phone rang yet again. Summer grabbed it with visible frustration,answering with sharp irritation. "For God's sake-"

Her expression suddenly shifted to confusion. She sat up straighter,checking the number again before glancing in my direction.

"Oh, officer, hello," she said, her tone completely transformed. "I'm sorry for the confusion. He's my sister's fiancé. If you need anything,you should really contact her instead."

I crossed the room to join her, stting on the edge of the bed. "Who's calling this tíme?" I asked, placing one hand on the bed beside her. "It's the New York Police Station. That asshole actually borrowed a police officer's phone to call me, can you believe that?" Summer replied, reaching up to touch my damp hair. "Dry your hair properly. We need to get some sleep." She turned her attention back to the phone. "My husband and I need to rest now,officer. If that's all?" I watched her hang up, a smile playing at my lips. My wife had just referred to me as her husband without hesitation-twice.
###Chapter 99: Grandpa Jonathan Knows


**Summer's POV**

The private meeting room at Scarlett's coffee shop smelled like fresh espresso and cinnamon, a comforting contrast to the spreadsheets scattered across the table making my head pound. I rubbed my temples, staring at the revenue reports.
Scarlett pushed through the door, balancing two steaming mugs."Found you hiding back here," she said, setting one in front of me.

"Not hiding," I protested. gesturing at the paperwork. "Just doing my due diligence as a silent partner. Though honestly, can't we just skip to the part where you tell me how much my share of the profits is?"
Scarlett rolled her eyes. "How on earth did you survive in finance? This is a fraction of what you dealt with at Fortune Corp."

I reminded her. "And I'm not at Fortune Corp anymnore."

"Well,tough luck. It's our business, and you're looking at these reports whether you like it or not." She pushed the statements closer to me. "Even if you don't care about the money, I want another set of eyes on this."

"Fine. But just so you know, Brandon's financial team could review these in five minutes flat."

"Well," Scarlett leaned forward, "you'll never guess who I just saw in the main café." "Who?""Your mom and Victoria, with Alexander's mother!" She looked delighted to deliver this gossip bomb. I nearly choked on my coffee. "Here? At your shop? What were theydoing?"
"Planning a wedding." Scarlett announced triumphantly. "Victoria and Alexander's wedding, to be specific."

I set down my mug, genuinely surprised. "You're kidding."

Scarlett grinned. "I may have lingered near their table a bit longer than necessary. They were discussing venues, guest lists,the works."
"Wait," she said slowly, studying my expression. "You're not still hung up on Alexander, are you?"

"God, no!" I laughed. "Do I look like I'm pining over that spineless man?Trust me, I'm completely over him."

"Then why the face?"

"It's just... Brandon told me both families would be rushing to get Victoria and Alexander married."

Scarlett whistled. "Your husband has some serious foresight. How does he know these things?"

"He understands people's motivations," I explained. "Alexander needs the Taylor family connections, Victoria needs the Stark name, and both families are desperate to cement the alliance." "And you're sure you're okay with it? Victoria has always seen you as competition. This rushed wedding is probably her way of marking her territory." I gathered the documents. "Anyway, I've gone through everything and looks good. I need to get going.""Fine, keep your secrets," Scarlett relented. "Just promise we'll get together soon? With Ruby too?" I shrugged, genuinely unconcerned. "Let them do whatever they want. I'm done with all that drama." "Absolutely," I agreed. "And now that I'm married to Brandon, I'm really done with all the Taylor family drama." "Summer, you know Victoria won't be satisfied until she's rubbed your face in it."
orry about."

Scarlett changed topics. "Oh, speaking of things to worry about-did you hear about the Columbia reunion?"

"No? Is there one planned?"

"Kristin mentioned it at her wedding. She called me a few days ago.Apparently, when they heard you and Ruby were back in New York..."

I groaned,already sensing where this was heading. "When is it?"


"Beginning of next month."

I nodded noncommittally. "We'll see."

"Has Victoria been causing trouble recently? I've heard she's had quite the rollercoaster in entertainment. Though she seems to have landed on her feet-signed with Stark Entertainment, from what I hear."

I felt a smile tugging at my lips, unable to hide my amusement at this particular twist of fate.

"What's with that mysterious smile?" Scarlett demanded. "I'n about you!"

"It's nothing," I insisted. "Just... yeah, she got lucky, I guess. Let's di "That's what I like to hear," she said. "Stay away from that toxic mess."

"Yes, mom," I teased. "Though at least you're not as bad as Ruby with her endless chatter."

Scarlett laughed. "If Ruby heard you saying that behind her back, she'd make your life hell."




After wandering through Manhattan for a few hours, I returned to the Hamptons estate as the sun was setting. Finding Brandon's study empty,I settled into his leather chair and began browsinga manuscript he'd left on his desk.

My phone rang, displaying my grandfather's number. "Hey, Grandpa."

"So you still recognize your old grandfather, do you?" Jonathan Thompson's gruff voice came through, tinged with displeasure. "Seemns like you've forgotten to keep me informed about major life events, young lady."

I sat up straighter, confused. "Grandpa? What are you talking about?"

"Your mother visited today. Mentioned Victoria and Alexander's engagement,among other things."

My stomach dropped. "Did... did she say anything else?" "Like about George Taylor giving you his shares in Capital Corp?" The disapproval in his voice was evident. "What game is that old man playing?Why drag you into the Taylor family mess?""Grandpa, please don't be upset," I pleaded. "Grandpa George means well.He's always been good to me." "If he truly cared for you, he wouldn't hand you those shares now.Doesn't he realize they're like a ticking time bomb for you?"
I sighed. "I know you're worried. But I promise I'm handling this carefully.

"There's something else," Jonathan continued. "Are you getting married?"

I froze, completely caught off guard. *How on earth did he find out?*

"Summer?" His voice sharpened. "Are you still planning to keep secrets from your grandfather?"

"How did you find out?" I finally managed.

"I have a friend who works at the city hall." Jonathan's voice grew serious.

"Summer, did you really get married?"

I turned at the sound of footsteps, spotting Brandon leaning against the doorframe. He was still in his work clothes, his tie loosened and jacket draped over one arm.
"Yes, Grandpa," I admitted. "I did get married. And you actually know him."

"I know him?" Jonathan sounded genuinely startled.

"Yes, and I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner. It all happened rather quickly."

"This isn't some trivial decision, Summer. Marriage isn't something you rush into without consulting family!" I winced at his tone. Brandon crossed the room in a few strides,reaching for the phone. I surrendered it without protest."Professor Thompson," Brandon said, his voice warm with respect. "It's me,Brandon." There was a shocked silence on the other end. "Brandon? Brandon Stark?" "Yes,sir,it's me."

"*You're* the one who married my granddaughter?" Jonathan's voice rose with disbelief.

Brandon's lips quirked up. "I am indeed, Professor Thompson."

"You little-" Jonathan spluttered. "You marry my granddaughter without so much as a word to me? I thought your relationship was strained! How did this happen so suddenly?"

"Were you planning to keep this from me indefinitely?" Jonathan demanded. "And does George Taylor know about this?"

Brandon perched on the edge of the desk beside me,his free hand gently stroking my hair in a soothing gesture.
"We had intended to tell you once things settled down," Brandon explained smoothly. "June was quite adamant she wouldn't fall in love with me, and I thought it best to wait for the right moment to approach you formally."

I rolled my eyes at his selective memory, and he gave me a playful wink.

"As for George Taylor," Brandon continued, "we haven't visited him yet.June and I wanted to speak with you first. You are her grandfather and my respected mentor, after all. Your blessing means everything to us."
###Chapter 100: Bound For Life

**Summer's POV**

"Of course I understand your concern, Professor Thompson," Brandon said.his voice carrying that perfect blend of respect and confidence that he somehow always managed to nail. "Your granddaughter is precíous to me too."

I rolled my eyes at his diplomatic tone. This was the same man who'd pinned me against the kitchen counter just this morning,whispering things that would make even Ruby blush.

"Hmph, don't think your sweet talk will fool me," Grandpa Jonathan grumbled through the speaker, though I could hear his irritation softening."If you don't give me a proper explanation about this whole situation,you know exactly what I'm capable of!"
Brandon's lips curved into a slight smile. "Of course I do, sir. What kind of man would I be if I didn't recognize who I'm dealing with?"
I mouthed "suck-up" at him, and he winked back at me, completely unfazed.

"Now, Professor, since my marriage to Summer is already a reality, when can we formally meet?" Brandon continued smoothly. "Despite you being my mentor, I'm now your granddaughter's husband. We should meet properly.""When you're free, come over," Grandpa replied, his tone warming considerably. "Perfect! I'm available tomorrow, if that works for you?" "Tomorrow it is,then!"When Brandon finally hung up. I collapsed into his desk chair with a groan. "I can't believe you just invited us over to see my grandfather tomorrow."

Brandon leaned against the desk, looking annoyingly calm. "Relax. If I'm not worried,why are you?"

"Because this is Grandpa Jonathan we're talking about!" I threw my hands up. "He might have been your professor, but I've had to deal with him my entire life. You don't know how intense his interrogations can get."

"Trust me, I do," Brandon chuckled. "I was his student, remember? I've faced plenty of his questioning-though admittedly, not about marrying his granddaughter."

"That's exactly my point!" I pressed my fingers to my temples."When Grandpa first introduced us months ago, I completely rejected the idea.Now we have to tell him we're suddenly married? He's going to know something's fishy."

Brandon moved behind me, his hands settling on my shoulders with a gentle, reassuring pressure. "Silly girl. Don't worry about it. If he asks, we'Il just say I pursued you relentlessly until you gave in."
I nearly choked. "And you think he'll believe that? You don't exactly come across as the desperate, lovesick type."

"Don't I?" There was that dangerous half-smile again. "You'd be surprised what I'mn capable of." "Right," I scoffed, fighting a smile. "So that's our story tomorrow-the great Brandon Stark was brought to his knees by love? Let's see if Grandpa buys that." "Matters ofathe heart aren't always easy to explain," he shrugged,effortlessly elegant even in that simple gesture. "Anyway, enough aboutthat. Where did you go today?"

"I stopped by the coffee shop to help Scarlett with the monthly accounts,"
I replied, stretching in the chair. "And guess who else was there?"

"Someone giving you trouble?" His voice immediately took on that protective edge I was starting to get used to.
"No, nothing like that. My mother anid Victoria were there with Alexander's mother."

Brandon raised an eyebrow. "And what were they doing there?"

"Planning a wedding," I said, watching his face carefully. "Victoria and Alexander's wedding, to be specific. You called it, by the way-they're rushing to make it happen."

"Richard Taylor's motivations are hardly a mystery," Brandon replied,utterly unsurprised. "He couldn't pass up this opportunity."

"James mentioned Alexander was causing trouble at my old apartment?"I asked,recalling what Brandon had mentioned earlier.

"Apparently," Brandon nodded. "He showed up, made a scene, and the police got involved. That explains why he was calling from the police station last night."

"God, what's wrong with him?" I shook my head in disbelief. "After I found out about the shares from Grandpa George, his attitude toward me shifted. He said the most bizarre things.""Let me guess," Brandon's voice took on a harder edge."He wanted to reconcile? Claimed his relationship with Victoria was just for her shares?" I stared at him, surprised by his accuracy. "Exactly that. How did you know?"
 "It's predictable," he shrugged.

A comfortable silence settled between us before Brandon suddenly announced, "Let's go out for dinner."

"Oh!" I checked the time and realized with a jolt that it was already past seven. "I didn't make anything! Why didn't you remind me earlier? You've been working all day, and I should have made dinner for you!"

"Silly girl," Brandon said, brushing a strand of hair from my face."Get changed. We'll go out, and maybe pick up a gift for your grandfather while we're at it."

"Right! Give me ten minutes!" I jumped up, suddenly energized by the prospect of going out. Despite living together for weeks now, we'd rarely gone on what could be considered actual "dates."
In the massive walk-incloset, I stood paralyzed by choices. Everything in here was nicer than anything I'd owned before moving in.

"Brandon," I called out, holding up two different outfits. "Which looks better-this one or this one?"

He glanced over from where he was seleeting a fresh shirt. "Both look fine."


"I can only wear one!"

"Then wear that one tonight," he decided, pointing to the deep blue dress in my right hand. "Save the other for tomorrow when we visit your grandfather." I nodded, satisfied with the plan, but another question had been nagging at me. "Brandon, is Diana your own brand?" He looked surprised by the question. "What makes you ask?" "I've been wondering for a while. Since I moved in, everything gets magically taken care of and all the clothes in the closet-except what I brought-are this brand. I've never seen it in stores."
"It's a Stark Group subsidiary," he explained. "Our department stores carry it. but it's not widely known to be connected to us."
As I watched him deftly button his shirt. I couldn't help noticing how different life had become. Just months ago, I was heartbroken and betrayed.living in a tiny apartment and working at a job I barely tolerated. Now I was discussing luxury clothing brands with my husband in our Hamptons estate.

"Here.let me do that," I said, approaching Brandon as he fumbled with his tie.

"I don't know why I have to tie this for you," I complained, though there was no real annoyance in my voice. "Before we got married, you managed just fine on your own."

Brandon's eyes held mine as I looped the silk around his collar."Now that we're married, isn't this the wife's job? There's an old saying-the woman who ties her man's tie binds him to her for life."

I fought back a smile, focusing on the knot. "I've never heard that saying before. Did you just make that up?"

"Maybe," he admitted, his voice softening as I finished the perfect Windsor knot. "But does that make it any less true?"
