Summer Taylor's life turned upside down when she discovered her fiancé's betrayal with her own sister. As if to torment her further, her own family drugged her and sent her to a stranger's bed for a $200 million investment. But Brandon appeared like a dark angel and saved her. He carried her to safety in his arms as the aphrodisiac coursed through her system. As Brandon settled her into the car, Summer's wandering hands sought relief from the burning heat. Every point of contact—her tits pressed against his chest, her soaked pussy grinding against his thigh—crackled with raw, electric hunger. “Stop that,” Brandon commanded, but she only arched closer. “I’m burning up,” she pouted, writhing against him, her hips bucking as her exploring fingers slid lower, palming the thick, hard bulge straining against his pants. His sharp inhale fueled her, and his grip on her wrist tightened, firm yet gentle, as his cock twitched under her teasing touch. Ignoring his warning, she buried her face in his neck, sucking hard, leaving wet, red marks as she trailed sloppy, heated kisses up his jaw. She caught his earlobe between her teeth, biting down, reveling in his ragged gasps as she ground her dripping cunt harder against him. His hands clamped onto her waist, fingers digging into her flesh, caught between shoving her off and yanking her tighter against his throbbing erection. For one electrifying moment, he gave in, his lips crashing against hers, tongue thrusting deep into her mouth, fucking it with slow, deliberate strokes. She moaned into him, her pussy clenching as she rubbed herself harder against his thigh, chasing release. --- But Brandon is practically also a stranger to her. After she got sober, she has to wonder: Did she escape one trap only to walk willingly into another?
