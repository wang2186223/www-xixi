###Chapter 1 The Breaking News

The breaking news flashed across the television screen. "Flight 387 bound for Pamore has crashed upon landing at 12:47 am Eklora time."

"The death toll has risen to 142 passengers, with only four survivors confirmed so far."

The live coverage of the plane crash jolted Evelyn Carter back to reality.

She was one of those four survivors.

Lying in the hospital bed, her body ached with injuries, both legs wrapped tightly in bandages.

"Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please try again later," the automated voice repeated through her phone.

Not a single call had been returned by Nathan Sterling, her husband in name only, since the crash.

The disaster had made national headlines. There was no way he hadn't heard.

The crash site had been littered with bodies. The terror of nearly dying still clung to her, making every breath feel like a struggle.

Yet when she needed comfort most, the man she'd been married to for three years remained silent.

Disappointment settled heavily in her chest.

After what felt like eternity, her phone finally rang. Evelyn's heart leapt as she grabbed it.

Then her hope shattered when she saw the caller ID.

"Hello?" Her voice came out rough.

"Evelyn, darling! You nearly gave me a heart attack!" Margaret Winslow's worried voice filled the line. "Are you alright? Is Nathan with you?"

Nathan's grandmother was the only person in the Sterling family who truly cared about her.

"He—"

Margaret immediately understood from Evelyn's hesitation.

"You're both his executive assistant and his wife! You went to Darai on his behalf for business, and now when tragedy strikes, he disappears?"

"Just wait until I get my hands on him! Which hospital are you at? I'm sending Walter to fetch you immediately!"

The call ended after Evelyn shared her location.

Without hesitation, Evelyn removed her IV needle, wincing at the pain as she forced herself upright.

"Miss Carter! You can't get up yet!" The nurse rushed over. "Your leg injuries require bed rest."

"Bring me crutches. I'm checking out." Evelyn's voice held steel.

The Sterling Estate would be far better for recovery than this hospital.

Not to mention she had work to handle. As VP of Operations at Sterling Enterprises, she'd been representing the company in Darai.

She needed to compile her report immediately.

More importantly, she needed to find out where the hell Nathan was.

After much arguing, the nurse reluctantly brought crutches.

Evelyn hobbled toward the billing department, then froze.

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, she spotted a familiar black Bentley followed by a fleet of luxury cars—all bearing the Sterling Enterprises logo.

A crowd of executives surrounded the tall man in the tailored black suit.

He carried a woman in his arms, cradling her protectively, his coat draped over her legs.

Nathan rushed past the lobby without noticing Evelyn standing there.

She watched numbly as he carried the woman into the private VIP wing.

Three years of marriage, and she'd never seen him show such tenderness.

Who was she?

Nearby nurses whispered as they passed.

"Oh my God! Isn't that Nathan Sterling? The billionaire CEO always featured in Forbes?"

"Did you hear? She's twelve weeks pregnant!"

Twelve weeks.

That was three months ago. Right when Nathan had started working late every night.
###Chapter 2 He'll be Home Soon

Evelyn suddenly remembered Nathan's business trip from two months ago. Her fingers clenched around the phone until her knuckles turned white.

Had he been unfaithful?

As his secretary and secret wife, she'd never heard whispers of infidelity before now.

"Mr. Sterling treats his girlfriend so well! Who's the lucky woman? They must be going public soon."

"I looked her up. Is this her?"

The nurse passing by took the phone from her colleague. "Yes, that's Isabella Delaney!"

"The Delaney heiress? With her beauty and status, she's perfect for Nathan!"

Their voices faded as they walked away, leaving Evelyn frozen in the hallway.

"The Delaneys..." The name echoed in her mind.

After completing her discharge paperwork, Evelyn slid into the waiting car. Her thoughts swirled like a storm.

The half-open window let in a cool breeze as her phone's glow illuminated her pale face. She searched desperately for connections between the Sterling and Delaney families - two of Pamore's most powerful dynasties.

Nothing. The silence was deafening.

When Evelyn arrived at Sterling Manor, only Margaret waited in the lit living room, leaning on her cane. "Thank heavens you're safe, dear! You nearly gave this old heart an attack!"

"Don't worry, Grandma." Evelyn forced a smile, desperate to escape upstairs. "I'm just... tired."

"Rest then. I've sent for Nathan. He'll be home soon!"

Evelyn's breath caught. The pain returned sharper than before, draining the color from her face.

She was the only one being kept in the dark.

Margaret mistook her distress for loneliness. She never imagined another woman's shadow had pierced Evelyn's heart, making all her sacrifices seem foolish.

Nathan didn't return until midnight the next day.

Darkness filled their bedroom until he flicked on the lights, irritation lining his features. "Still awake? Why sit in the dark?"

Evelyn hadn't moved from bed all day. The untouched meals by her bedside had gone cold.

"Where were you these past two days?" Her back remained turned, her voice hoarse with exhaustion.

Nathan paused mid-way through removing his suit jacket. His brows furrowed at the unfamiliar question.

In three years of marriage, she'd never demanded his whereabouts like this.

"Business in Misdeon," he answered coldly, loosening his tie with sharp movements before heading toward the bathroom.

"Really?" Evelyn's bitter laugh hung in the air. "Simon confirmed no flights to Misdeon."

Nathan froze at the bathroom door. "What are you implying?"

Though she couldn't see his face, Evelyn felt the icy anger radiating from him. The temperature in the room seemed to drop.
###Chapter 3: "How Long Have You Known Her?"

The dim lighting revealed Evelyn leaning heavily on her crutches. Nathan's breath caught when he realized how much weight she'd lost since their wedding three years ago.

She looked fragile enough to be swept away by the slightest breeze.

"You were following me?" Nathan's expression darkened instantly.

"Do I look that desperate?" Her voice was soft but razor-sharp. "I was at the same hospital. Saw you with my own eyes."

Nathan's anger flared while Evelyn battled overwhelming grief. How could he?

Not a single word of concern about her car accident. Only irritation and contempt laced his tone.

Three years of marriage. Three wasted years.

She'd played the perfect daughter-in-law to Margaret's impossible standards. Endured Vanessa's constant disdain.

A servant at home. A workhorse at Sterling Enterprises.

All to fulfill Margaret's demand for an heir. Hoping Nathan might finally see her worth.

Even a crumb of affection would've made it bearable.

Yet Nathan had barely touched her.

They shared a bedroom but never a bed.

Biting back pain, Evelyn met his icy gaze with a hollow laugh. "Your mother calls me barren while your mistress carries your child. Do I mean nothing to you?"

She reached for him, but he caught her wrist instantly.

"Isabella isn't some mistress. We've known each other twenty years."

Childhood sweethearts. His grip tightened.

"She was abroad five years. Zero contact."

That explained why Evelyn's investigators found nothing.

Her gaze dropped to his hand on her stomach. "And now you've reconnected?"

Nathan's throat worked. He considered explaining, then thought better of it. "You forget how you became Mrs. Sterling."

As if she could forget.

With multiple heirs vying for control of Sterling Enterprises, Margaret had sought a Pamore bride to secure the family line.

Evelyn, Margaret's lifesaver, had volunteered.

She'd approached Nathan herself. Promised not to interfere in his life.

Closed her thriving boutique. Became his secretary. Their marriage remained a secret.

Now he accused her of overstepping.

Evelyn's laugh was brittle. "Humans are greedy creatures, aren't we?"

Pale as death, only her smile proved she wasn't a specter.

Nathan studied her, sensing a change he couldn't define.

Suddenly, Evelyn slipped free from his grasp.

A floral scent filled the room, growing stronger despite closed windows. The temperature climbed.

Nathan glanced at the thermostat - 30°C.

His scowl deepened when Evelyn's fingers found his collar.

He couldn't bring himself to stop her.

"What did you do?" he demanded as his breathing turned ragged.
###Chapter 4 I just Want a Child

Evelyn peeled off Nathan's shirt, her lips trailing fiery kisses down his sculpted torso. The ache for him burned so fiercely that a crimson flush crept up to the tips of her ears.

"You asked how I became Mrs. Sterling," she murmured against his skin, her breath hot. "I almost forgot my most important duty—giving you an heir."

Her fingers traced the ridges of his abdomen as she continued, "Consider this me... fulfilling my obligations."

Nathan's entire body went rigid. "You dare—?" His voice was a growl, muscles coiling with barely restrained fury.

Evelyn smirked, unfazed. "I may have sprayed something... stimulating in the air. Don’t fight it. The effects won’t last long."

Her touch grew bolder, a stark contrast to the demure facade she’d worn around him before.

"I just... want a child. Your child."

Nathan’s breathing turned ragged, his control fraying under her shameless advances.

With a snarl, he seized her wrist, his grip bruising. "You’re revolting, Evelyn."

The fire in her eyes dimmed instantly.

"Does touching me really disgust you that much?" Her voice wavered, tears glistening.

"Yes." His answer was immediate, his glare cutting deeper than any blade.

He shoved her away, snatching his discarded clothes. He didn’t bother buttoning his shirt before storming out, the door slamming behind him with finality.

Only then did Evelyn collapse to the floor, nails biting into her palms. A hollow laugh escaped her.

Time to let go.

The next morning, Evelyn descended the stairs, her suitcase scraping against each step.

The dining table was set, but the usual breakfast chatter was absent—Margaret was at her morning prayers.

Vanessa Sterling, Nathan’s sharp-tongued sister, lounged in the foyer. A sophomore at Pamore University, she’d never hidden her disdain for Evelyn.

"Running away after nearly dying?" Vanessa sneered. "Too bad. You’re doing my hair first. I have a party tonight."

Evelyn ignored her, heading straight for the door—only to collide with Eleanor Blackwell, her mother-in-law, impeccably dressed as always.

Eleanor’s lip curled. "Where do you think you’re going? Put that luggage down and help Patricia clean the guest suite. We have a special arrival."

Evelyn’s stomach twisted.

Vanessa perked up. "Who’s coming?"

Eleanor’s smile was saccharine. "Isabella Delaney, of course."

"Isabella’s back?"

"And pregnant with Nathan’s child," Eleanor added, her gaze slicing to Evelyn. "The Sterling estate is the perfect place for her to stay. Far better than the Delaney residence."

Her words were a knife to Evelyn’s ribs. Isabella had always been Eleanor’s choice.

If not for that night, Nathan would’ve married her instead.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her suitcase handle.

Eleanor snapped, "Why are you still standing there? Move!"

In the past, Evelyn would’ve obeyed.

Not today.

Her voice was eerily calm. "Nathan and I are done. Find someone else to play maid."
###Chapter 5 How Pathetic

Eleanor Blackwell couldn't believe Evelyn Carter had actually dared to speak to her like that.

Her jeweled finger, weighed down by an enormous emerald ring, jabbed toward Evelyn. "How dare you use that tone with me? Repeat what you just said!"

Not a trace of fear showed on Evelyn's face.

She met Eleanor's glare head-on. "Since Isabella is moving in, let her do your errands. I'm done being your servant." Each word was enunciated with icy precision.

For the first time in years, Evelyn felt an exhilarating rush of liberation.

Eleanor's face turned crimson with rage. "You ungrateful—"

"Mother!" Vanessa Sterling suddenly grasped Eleanor's arm, whispering urgently. "Evelyn's clearly upset about last night. I heard Nathan couldn't even—"

Vanessa's exaggerated retelling of events made her smirk with malicious delight.

Eleanor's expression shifted instantly. "So you're taking your marital failures out on me? How pathetic."

Evelyn had already reached the grand staircase. She paused mid-step, fists clenched as she fought the urge to retaliate physically.

Turning slowly, she delivered her counterstrike with chilling calm. "For three years you've blamed my supposed infertility. Why not have Nathan examined too?"

Her voice dropped to a venomous whisper. "After all, nothing could rouse him last night despite my best efforts. Makes one wonder where the real problem lies."

The color drained from Eleanor's face. Even Vanessa gasped.

"You—" Eleanor sputtered before finding her voice. "Mark my words, Evelyn, I'll make sure Nathan divorces you immediately!"

In the past, Evelyn had tolerated their abuse for Margaret's sake. No more.

"By all means," Evelyn shrugged, descending the stairs with effortless grace. "Do enlighten me when the papers are signed."

The slam of the front door echoed through the mansion.

An uneasy suspicion gripped Eleanor. "Search her room! That suitcase looked suspiciously heavy—who knows what she stole!"

Minutes later, Vanessa rushed downstairs clutching a legal folder. "Nothing's missing but—this was on the nightstand!"

Eleanor snatched it open. Her breath hitched.

Divorce papers. Already signed by Evelyn.

Fury propelled Eleanor to call Nathan immediately. "Your wife left divorce papers! And she's spreading vile lies about your—your manhood!"

Nathan was mid-presentation when the call came. At his mother's words, he abruptly dismissed his entire boardroom.

"Calm down, Mother," he growled, shrugging into his suit jacket.

"Calm? This is perfect timing with Isabella returning! But she doesn't get to leave first!" Eleanor shrieked.

Nathan hung up mid-tirade. His knuckles whitened around his phone. The docile Evelyn he knew would never—

Then he remembered last night's humiliation. Scrolling through contacts, he realized with shock this was his first call to his wife in three years.

Before the call connected, Simon burst through the executive doors. "Mr. Sterling! Evelyn just emailed her resignation!"

Simon gulped air. "She's overseeing twelve active projects—including the critical Darai Medical Expo. There's no transition plan!"

Nathan's expression darkened further when Evelyn's phone went straight to voicemail.

"The number you have dialed is currently unavailable—"

She'd blocked him.
###Chapter 6 Mind Your Manners

Evelyn stood in the bustling airport terminal, her fingers tightening around the phone that had just gone dark.

The weight that had been crushing her chest for months at Sterling Manor finally lifted.

Raindrops streaked across the floor-to-ceiling windows as travelers rushed past her. Would she miss Pamore?

Perhaps. But relief drowned out any lingering nostalgia.

The truth had crystallized in her mind - Nathan didn't love her. Never had. His heart belonged to another.

What purpose did clinging to false hope serve?

She approached the first-class counter, boarding pass for Darai in hand.

Years ago, she'd abandoned her family and identity to stay in this city.

Had it not been for her grandfather's intervention, the medical expo deal with Sterling Enterprises would never have materialized.

Yet Nathan sent her alone to negotiate, proving exactly where she stood in his priorities.

"Miss Carter?" The airline agent's voice snapped her back to reality. "Your ticket appears to be on hold. I can't issue your boarding pass."

Evelyn's stomach dropped. "That's impossible. Please check again."

"Was this booked through a corporate account? There seems to have been a recent refund processed. May I see your ID for verification?"

The realization hit like icy water.

Every account, every access - all controlled by Sterling Enterprises.

Even her identification card remained with HR after last week's registration update.

In her haste to escape, she'd overlooked these shackles.

"One moment please." She stepped aside, dialing HR with trembling fingers.

The call never connected.

Of course. Her phone service was another corporate leash.

"Sterling Enterprises," she muttered through clenched teeth.

Hailing a cab through the downpour, Evelyn watched Sterling Tower's imposing silhouette emerge from the storm.

She tossed a hundred-dollar bill at the driver and dragged her luggage through the revolving doors.

The facial recognition system rejected her three times before finally granting elevator access.

On the twelfth floor, Derek Monroe's smarmy grin greeted her dripping form.

"My, my, Ms. Carter. You look positively... fugitive." The HR director's nasal voice dripped with mock concern.

"Where's my ID?" Evelyn ignored his jab.

"Simon collected it minutes ago." Derek's smirk widened. "Pity you missed him."

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. She should have anticipated Nathan's retaliation.

The man never tolerated defiance.

As she turned toward the executive elevators, Derek called after her, "Do mind your manners up there. Mr. Sterling's fiancée is visiting for their important meeting."

The word fiancée struck like a blade between her ribs.
###Chapter 7: Fiancée?

Her secret marriage to Nathan Sterling had never been made public. To everyone at Sterling Enterprises, she was merely his executive assistant.

The "fiancée" Derek had mentioned could only be Isabella Delaney.

Evelyn Carter had just finalized her divorce from Nathan, and already Isabella was making appearances at Sterling Enterprises.

Not only that, but Isabella would soon be moving into Sterling Manor - sleeping in Evelyn's bed, enjoying everything that should have been hers.

The thought made Evelyn's chest tighten painfully.

Still, she thanked Derek for the information before leaving HR.

Derek watched her retreating figure with narrowed eyes.

Even an idiot could see Evelyn still carried a torch for Mr. Sterling. No wonder she'd been let go.

As he turned back to his computer, he muttered under his breath, "This is going to be quite the spectacle."

When the elevator doors opened on the executive floor, Evelyn nearly collided with Simon.

"Ms. Carter, you're here." Simon's gaze flickered to the suitcase in her hand, immediately understanding she'd come for her ID.

He gestured toward the conference room. "I've given your identification card to Mr. Sterling."

"He's in his third meeting today. Is it urgent? Should I interrupt?"

"That won't be necessary. I'll wait." Her tone was ice.

"Would you like some coffee then?" Simon offered, knowing full well Nathan had no intention of accepting her resignation.

Evelyn had too many critical projects underway. Replacing her would be nearly impossible.

"It's Tuesday's special hand-drip blend. I just learned the technique." His manner was noticeably warmer than usual.

"No thank you." If she was cutting ties with Nathan, she saw no reason to be cordial to his associates.

Simon nodded and disappeared into the conference room with his documents.

Evelyn passed the open workspace, her eyes drawn to the conference room's partially open door.

Dozens of executives surrounded the massive table. Nathan's broad back faced her as he listened intently to reports, his sharp profile occasionally offering terse comments.

He'd always been ruthlessly focused during meetings.

Evelyn looked down at her damp clothes and the suitcase weighing down her arm.

As much as she wanted to storm in, she knew better than to cause a scene.

Her gaze shifted to the CEO's office. Through the frosted glass, she could make out a feminine silhouette.

Isabella, no doubt - the same woman she'd seen at the hospital.

Entering now would only humiliate herself further.

Setting her luggage aside, Evelyn retreated to the restroom. Cold water splashed against her face as she struggled to compose herself.

How exactly should she demand her ID back from Nathan?

"Ms. Carter, you're in early," chirped an intern washing her hands nearby.

Evelyn offered a noncommittal hum. Once alone, she blotted her face with a paper towel.

The mirror reflected dark circles and hollowed cheeks - the physical toll of her failed marriage.

Her brother Dominic had commented on her dramatic weight loss during her last visit to Darai.

She'd joked about being on a diet.

The truth was far more bitter.

Ending things was for the best.

The restroom door swung open abruptly.

A willowy woman entered, her pregnancy bump barely visible beneath an elegant silk dress. Everything about Isabella Delaney radiated effortless privilege.

Evelyn instinctively straightened, hastily drying her face before turning to leave.

"Excuse me," Isabella's melodic voice stopped her.

"That woman called you Ms. Carter. You must be Nathan's assistant?"

Evelyn froze as delicate footsteps approached.

Isabella positioned herself directly in Evelyn's path, offering a saccharine smile. "Nathan's meeting should wrap up soon."

"Would you mind brewing coffee for his office? You know how he takes it, don't you?"
###Chapter 8 You May Leave Now.

Evelyn hesitated. Her resignation letter was already submitted. She had no obligation to handle such trivial matters anymore.

Besides, while Isabella's words sounded like a request, her tone carried an unmistakable command.

It rubbed Evelyn the wrong way.

Yet Nathan still had her ID card. This would be the last time she'd run such petty errands anyway.

She could use this opportunity to ask for her identification back when delivering the coffee later.

Taking a deep breath, she finally agreed. "Alright."

"Thanks." Isabella walked away without another glance.

Since becoming pregnant, Isabella carried herself with maternal grace. Yet her natural confidence as the privileged heiress still contrasted sharply with Evelyn's current state.

Years ago, Evelyn's prestigious family background had made Isabella pale in comparison. But time had changed everything.

Now Evelyn seemed to have lost all her former poise and elegance.

She stood frozen for a long moment before shaking herself out of it. Heading to the pantry, she prepared the Americano with three-quarter sugar and one-quarter milk - exactly how Nathan preferred it.

Returning with the coffee, she noticed the meeting had ended. Employees streamed out of the conference room.

Not seeing Nathan among them, she assumed he'd gone to his office.

Coffee in hand, she knocked on his door.

"Come in." Isabella's flirtatious voice answered.

Evelyn nearly dropped the cup. It took all her willpower to finally turn the knob.

The sight that greeted her made her blood run cold. Isabella had her arms wrapped around Nathan's neck while perched on his lap.

Despite mental preparation, the scene still stabbed through Evelyn's heart like shards of glass.

Isabella appeared slightly embarrassed at being caught. "Just leave the coffee and go," she instructed.

Snapping back to reality, Evelyn slowly raised her head. Her eyes met Nathan's.

His icy glare could have frozen hell over. The sheer contempt in his gaze made her feel like prey cornered by a predator.

Evelyn realized this was deliberate. He knew she'd come, yet chose to let her witness this intimate moment - all to humiliate her.

"Ms. Carter?" Isabella prompted when Evelyn didn't move.

Evelyn forced a nod. Setting down the coffee, she turned to leave.

After two steps, she froze.

The murmurs behind her painted vivid images of Nathan and Isabella's intimacy. Her legs turned to jelly, requiring every ounce of strength not to collapse.

"Is there something else, Ms. Carter?" Isabella's voice dripped with annoyance at her lingering.

"I..." Evelyn finally found her voice. "Mr. Sterling has something of mine. I'd like it back."

The atmosphere in the spacious office instantly thickened.

Despite the stacks of documents covering the desk, nothing could hide what the couple was doing on the leather chair.

Nathan's white shirt hung open, revealing a fresh love bite on his neck.

"Oh?" Isabella's curiosity piqued. She tightened her grip on Nathan's arm. "Nathan, what do you have of hers?"

"Nothing important." Nathan pulled Isabella closer.

Watching their bodies press together, Evelyn pressed her lips into a thin line.

After a tense silence, Nathan finally spoke, his voice frosty. "You may leave now."

He looked at her like she was a stranger.

Clearly, he wouldn't return her ID easily.

"It's my identification card," Evelyn stated bluntly, deciding to speak frankly since Isabella was present. Right now, she just wanted her ID back so she could leave Sterling Enterprises forever.

"Actually, I've resigned, but Mr. Sterling has confiscated my ID. I can't help but wonder if he has ulterior motives."

"Sterling Enterprises employs countless capable people. There's no need for him to resort to such petty tactics against a mere secretary like me."
###Chapter 9  Stripping Off the Corporate Attire in Full View

The atmosphere turned suffocating in an instant.

Evelyn had always measured her words carefully around Nathan. Never before had she displayed such unshakable defiance in his presence.

Nathan's expression darkened immediately.

"Is that true, Nathan?" Isabella pressed closer to him, a subtle frown creasing her perfect features.

"Absolutely not," he replied coolly.

"As she pointed out, Sterling Enterprises employs only the most competent staff. Why would we withhold her ID?"

"But since she's resigning, corporate policy requires her to remove the company attire and complete all handovers. Otherwise, it would violate company regulations."

Now Evelyn understood why Nathan had forced her to come here today.

He'd presented her with two cruel options—remain shackled to Sterling Enterprises or walk away empty-handed.

She could scarcely believe he'd sink to such tactics to break her will.

He was stripping away the last remnants of her dignity.

"I see. Then you're in the wrong, Ms. Carter." Isabella's laugh tinkled like broken glass. "For a moment I thought there was something between you and Nathan—"

As Isabella began snuggling against Nathan's chest, something inside Evelyn shattered. She shrugged off her blazer and began unbuttoning her silk blouse with trembling fingers.

"I'll remove it right now," she declared.

Nathan was correct—it was better to make a clean break.

The executive office plunged into stunned silence. Isabella gaped at her in disbelief.

Nathan, who had been staring at his desk while wrestling with some unnamed emotion, looked up sharply.

Over recent days, he'd sensed a fundamental change in Evelyn.

He couldn't articulate it, but it felt like she was slipping through his fingers.

Had he ever truly known this woman during their three years of marriage?

Word of the confrontation spread through the executive floor like wildfire. Employees strained to glimpse the drama unfolding behind the frosted glass.

No one expected meek, compliant Evelyn Carter to reveal such steely resolve.

She was actually removing her corporate attire in public to secure her resignation.

When the blouse pooled at her feet, Evelyn stood in only a fitted white camisole that accentuated her toned figure.

"Damn! Who knew Ms. Carter had that kind of body?" whispered one stunned colleague.

"No wonder—our corporate uniforms are practically sacks. You could hide an entire bakery under those," another muttered.

Their gossip died instantly when Simon slammed his palm on a nearby desk.

"Don't you have work to complete? Or should I deduct this month's bonuses right now?"

The chastised employees exchanged glances before scrambling back to their tasks.

Simon risked a glance through the slatted blinds. He'd never seen Nathan torment a resigning employee like this.

What the hell was really going on between them?

Inside the office, Evelyn shivered as the aggressive air conditioning raised goosebumps on her exposed skin.

Teeth nearly chattering, she lifted her chin. "Mr. Sterling, may I have my identification card now?"

Anticipating further excuses, she added, "Regarding the handover—I'll email completed documents to Simon."

"You may withhold my final paycheck if you have concerns."

The unspoken message was clear—she wanted nothing more to do with him.

Nathan's eyes darkened to stormy obsidian.

Confronted with her unexpected steel, an unfamiliar emotion clawed at his chest—something disturbingly close to regret.
###Chapter 10 The Arrival of Her Brother

"Is that...Nathan?"

Isabella had no clue about the true nature of Nathan and Evelyn's relationship. But what she'd witnessed was enough to make Evelyn's presence unbearable.

"Just send Ms. Carter away already. My parents are waiting for you at the estate. It's been ages since—"

Her sharp tone snapped Nathan from his thoughts.

The Sterlings owed the Delaneys a considerable debt, making this visit unavoidable.

Evelyn's face remained an unreadable mask throughout the exchange.

As if she'd already erased him from her heart.

Nathan's jaw tightened visibly, irritation flashing across his features.

"Over there."

Following his gaze, Evelyn spotted her ID card wedged beneath the water dispenser. The way it lay discarded mirrored how insignificant she must be to him.

"Appreciate it." She swallowed the bitter taste in her mouth as she retrieved the card.

Without a backward glance, she strode toward the exit.

She could feel his icy stare burning holes into her retreating figure.

The moment Evelyn pushed through the office doors, dozens of eyes locked onto her.

Some held pity. Most brimmed with morbid curiosity.

The whispers hit her like daggers—how she'd been caught throwing herself at Nathan, how his pregnant girlfriend had rightfully kicked her out.

The irony stung. She was his legal wife, yet here she stood, branded the other woman.

Hot tears threatened, but she blinked them away fiercely.

Footsteps echoed behind her in the lobby.

Simon. He extended an umbrella. "Ms. Carter, it's pouring out there. You'll catch cold—take my jacket too."

At least one soul in Sterling Enterprises retained basic decency.

Evelyn stopped him before he could remove his coat. The lump in her throat made speaking impossible.

Simon opened his mouth, then closed it, helpless against her shattered expression.

In that hesitation, Evelyn fled. She plunged into the storm, letting the icy rain numb the pain.

Hours later, she found herself in a taxi bound for the airport. As the city lights blurred past, she dialed a familiar number.

The moment the line connected, her voice cracked. "Dominic..."

The call lasted mere seconds.

Eight hours later, a private jet touched down at Pamore International.

A towering man engulfed Evelyn in a bear hug while his bodyguard collected her luggage. Together, they boarded the waiting aircraft.

Midnight found a sleek Bentley idling outside Sterling Manor.

From the backseat, Nathan studied the darkened windows of the master bedroom—usually illuminated, now hauntingly vacant.

A tangible reminder of her absence.

Isabella misread his tension. "Nathan, I know what happened between Harrison and my sister hurt everyone. Marriage isn't urgent—"

"Your sleeve." His cold interruption made her jump. "It's wrinkled."

She recoiled as if burned.

Nathan exited without another word, leaving Isabella gaping.

That morning, he'd allowed her to perch on his lap in his office. Now he treated her like a stranger.

What had changed?

Shaking off her confusion, she scrambled after him into the storm.
###Chapter 11 Sterling Enterprises Gets the Boot

The grand foyer of Sterling Manor was bathed in golden light as Patricia Winslow stood waiting for their arrival. The seasoned housekeeper took Nathan Sterling's coat with practiced ease, then froze when she spotted Isabella Delaney trailing behind him.

"Ms. Delaney," Patricia recovered quickly, "your guest suite is ready on the second floor."

Evelyn paused mid-step, her designer heels clicking against the marble. "Excuse me? I assumed I'd be staying in Nathan's wing." Her voice carried the unspoken implication - by inviting her into his home, Nathan had tacitly agreed to their impending marriage.

Nathan's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.

Patricia shifted uncomfortably. Mrs. Blackwell had been adamant about removing all traces of Evelyn Carter from the master suite. The housekeeper couldn't meet Isabella's expectant gaze.

"I have work," Nathan said curtly, dismissing them both with a glance that brooked no argument.

Isabella's perfectly sculpted brows drew together. "But darling-"

Patricia smoothly intercepted, "This way please, Ms. Delaney." The elevator doors slid shut, cutting off Isabella's view of Nathan's retreating form.

Upstairs in his study, Nathan stood under a scalding shower, trying to wash away the day's tension. Wrapped in a silk robe, he stared at financial reports without seeing them.

At this hour, Evelyn would usually appear with chamomile tea - never coffee, she knew it kept him awake. She'd leave it on his desk with that quiet smile before retreating to their... no, his bedroom.

Most nights he'd work until dawn. The rare times he joined her, he'd taken the couch without discussion. Yet every evening without fail, the tea would appear.

Tonight, his desk remained empty.

The absence gnawed at him.

His phone shattered the silence. Simon's name flashed on the screen.

"Mr. Sterling," his assistant's voice was tense, "Darai Medical Expo just informed us we've been removed from their participant list. They're citing insufficient sponsorship funds."

Nathan's grip tightened on the phone. Evelyn had handled this account personally until her abrupt departure. "Explain. We donated nearly three hundred million last year."

"I don't understand either, sir. I tried contacting Ms. Carter, but her number's been disconnected..." Simon trailed off, the silence heavy with implication.

Nathan remembered Evelyn standing in his office, stripping off her company badge with shaking hands. The way she'd held herself together despite the humiliation.

An unfamiliar tightness gripped his chest.

Evelyn had once told him about growing up in that tiny Appalachian town, working three jobs to put herself through design school. How she'd barely scraped together enough to open a boutique before their marriage, only to close it at his family's insistence.

For years, she'd existed on the allowance he'd provided. No credit cards in her name, no property.

Where would a woman with nothing go?

"Two tasks," Nathan's voice was steel. "First, send someone to West Virginia." He still remembered the address from her emergency contacts. "Second, arrange a meeting with Darai's chairman."

He ended the call and hurled his phone onto the leather couch. The study's windows reflected a man he barely recognized - jaw clenched, eyes dark with something dangerously close to regret.
###Chapter 12 The Kingsley Brothers in Darai

Evelyn's eyes fluttered open to the familiar scent of lavender and silk sheets. The opulent bedroom hadn't changed a single detail since she'd last slept here years ago.

A steaming bowl of her favorite chicken soup sat on the nightstand. Three designer dresses were carefully arranged at the foot of the bed - all in her exact size and preferred colors.

Her throat tightened with emotion.

No one in Sterling Enterprises had ever shown her this level of care.

The sound of polished shoes clicking against marble announced his arrival before he appeared in the doorway. Dressed in an impeccably tailored black suit, Dominic Kingsley carried himself with the effortless authority of a man who commanded empires.

Her eldest brother had personally retrieved her from Pamore's airport last night.

As current head of Kingsley Industries, Dominic rarely displayed emotion. Yet the subtle tension in his jaw betrayed his concern.

"Grandfather nearly collapsed when he heard about your accident. When your phone kept going to voicemail, his blood pressure spiked dangerously."

Evelyn's heart lurched. She threw off the covers. "Dominic! Is Leonard alright?"

"Stable. Doctors insist on complete bed rest." His gaze swept over her disheveled appearance. "You, however..."

Dominic caught her wrist as she tried to rush past. "Look at yourself. Is this how you want Grandfather to see you?" His voice dropped. "Have you forgotten your promise?"

The words hit like ice water.

Of course she remembered.

She'd sworn to Leonard that if Nathan Sterling didn't fall in love with her within their marriage term, she'd return home without protest.

She'd even agreed to consider an alliance marriage with the Prescott heir to strengthen Kingsley Industries' position among the Four Great Families.

Why bring this up now? Had Dominic already negotiated with Adrian Prescott?

Rumors painted the Prescott heir as a notorious playboy.

"But Dominic," she pleaded, "the ink isn't even dry on my divorce papers. I can't possibly—"

His stern expression softened. "We'd never force you into marriage, Evelyn." He sighed. "But it's time you assumed your responsibilities. While Grandfather recovers, you'll work directly under me."

Meaning she'd finally take her place at Kingsley Industries headquarters - the destiny her family had prepared her for when they sent her to Eklora's prestigious business school.

Not running a boutique in Pamore. Certainly not chasing after Nathan Sterling like a lovestruck fool.

"Alright." She'd agree to anything if it postponed talk of remarriage.

Dominic studied her for a long moment before nodding. His gaze held equal parts frustration and pity. Perhaps her failed marriage had taught her something after all.

"Sir?" A discreet knock preceded Maxwell Donovan's entrance. "Sterling Enterprises is demanding an explanation for their sudden exclusion from the Darai Medical Expo. They're insisting on an emergency meeting."

Evelyn froze. "Dominic, you didn't—"

Of course he had. Her brother had moved against the Sterlings the moment her plane touched down.

Nathan had pretended indifference about the expo, but only because he'd assumed Evelyn would fix everything for him.

How arrogant.

"I made sure they understand," Dominic said coldly, "that no one mistreats a Kingsley without consequences." He adjusted his cufflinks. "You know what's expected of you now."

With that, he strode out, Maxwell falling into step beside him.

"Schedule orientation for Evelyn tomorrow," Dominic ordered. "Full tour of production facilities. Then walk her through the Executive Vice President's responsibilities."

"Yes, sir."

Their voices faded down the corridor.

Executive Vice President. Second only to Dominic himself.

Evelyn clenched her fists. This time, she wouldn't fail her family.

"Surprise!"

On her second morning in the corner office atop Kingsley Tower, her door burst open without warning.
###Chapter 13 Julian's Past

"Why am I the last to know you're back? Seriously, Evelyn! Did our sibling bond mean nothing to you?"

The familiar teasing tone belonged to her third brother, Julian Hartwell.

Julian wasn't related by blood. The Kingsleys had adopted him as an infant after his biological parents abandoned him at the hospital.

Evelyn didn't glance up from her financial reports. "Sit down and stop being dramatic. I'm working."

Three days had passed since Dominic assigned her this mountain of corporate documents from Kingsley Industries, and she'd barely made a dent.

Her phone hadn't stopped ringing either - calls from global partners, investors, and media outlets left her head spinning.

Julian flopped onto the leather sofa uninvited. "Dom's working you too hard. This executive training is ridiculous. Come tour Europe with me instead."

"Not interested." Evelyn organized another stack of files.

"Remember when paparazzi thought we were dating? If Dom hadn't intervened, your fans would've stoned me with rotten tomatoes!"

"You still bring that up?" Julian chuckled.

"Clearly you're obsessed with me if you remember every little moment."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "You need professional help."

His grin widened. "You're the only therapist I need."

After years of his playful flirting, his antics no longer fazed her.

Despite his superstar status as an international pop icon, Julian always made time for her.

When she'd stubbornly married Nathan, Julian had canceled his sold-out London show to fly back and "have words" with the Sterling heir. Dominic had barely restrained him.

Looking back, she couldn't fathom choosing Nathan over the exceptional men already in her life.

"My phone's ringing. One moment."

"Yes, Mr. President."

Silence reclaimed the office after the call ended.

Vice President of Kingsley Industries.

The title carried immense weight, second only to Dominic himself.

Evelyn clenched her pen. This time, she wouldn't disappoint her brother.

"Surprise!"

On her second day in the executive suite, her office door burst open.

"Why am I the last one to know you're back? I can't believe you kept this from me, Evelyn! Did our friendship mean nothing?"

Evelyn recognized that playful yet wounded tone immediately. It belonged to her third brother, Julian Hartwell.

Julian wasn't related by blood. The Kingsleys had adopted him as an infant after his biological parents abandoned him at the hospital.

She didn't glance up from the financial reports. "Sit down and stop being dramatic. I'm working."

Three days had passed, and the mountain of documents Dominic's assistant delivered still overwhelmed her.

Her phone hadn't stopped ringing either - calls from global organizations, investors, media outlets. The sheer volume left her head spinning.

Julian flopped onto the leather sofa, unfazed by her sharp tone.

"Dominic's pushing you too hard. This isn't training, it's torture." He stretched his arms behind his head. "Come tour Europe with me. Consider it a mental health break."

"Not interested." Evelyn organized another stack of files.

"Remember when your fans mistook me for your secret lover?" He chuckled. "If Dominic hadn't intervened, I'd still be picking eggshells out of my hair."

"You're still hung up on that?" She finally looked up, arching an eyebrow.

His grin widened. "You remembered too! Admit it, you're obsessed with me."

"Get therapy." She rolled her eyes.

"You're the only therapist I need." He winked.

Years of Julian's shameless flirting had immunized her to such remarks.

Despite his international pop star status and grueling schedule, Julian always made time for her.

When she'd stubbornly married Nathan, Julian had canceled his Madison Square Garden concert, ready to fly to Sterling Manor and punch him. Dominic had intervened just in time.

Looking back, she couldn't fathom choosing Nathan when men like Julian existed.

Her phone vibrated with an unknown number.

Julian fell silent as she moved toward the window.

"Hello, is this the Kingsley Industries executive assistant? I'm calling regarding Sterling Enterprises' participation in the Dar—"

Simon.

Dominic had blocked all Sterling numbers. They must have used a burner phone - undoubtedly Nathan's idea.

"The sponsorship terms were clear. Your contribution fell short." Her voice remained steady.

Sterling Enterprises had only qualified because she'd begged Dominic on Nathan's behalf.

"Ms. Carter?" Simon's shock crackled through the line.

Having worked alongside her for years, he'd recognize her voice anywhere.

Evelyn neither confirmed nor denied. "I'm busy. Goodbye."

She exhaled sharply after hanging up.

Simon was definitely in Nathan's office. Nathan was probably listening in, that familiar calculating gaze fixed on the speakerphone.

Just as she predicted, Simon handed the phone to Nathan, his face pale.

"Mr. Sterling... that sounded exactly like Ms. Carter. How could she—"

Nathan's jaw clenched. He'd recognized her voice too.

Recently, Simon reported failing to locate Evelyn's supposed rural parents.

The entire backstory had been fabricated.

For three years, she'd deceived the Sterling family.

"Sir... about the expo?" Simon hesitated at Nathan's stormy expression.

Nathan's lips thinned. "Keep calling."
###Chapter 14 Sharing a Bed

Nathan clenched his jaw as he repeatedly dialed Evelyn's number. Each attempt was met with the same automated message - the line was busy.

Finally, Julian snatched the phone just as the call connected.

"What's your problem, Nathan? Just tell Simon you're skipping the expo this year," Evelyn snapped impatiently.

Silence stretched on the other end.

After a long pause, a deep voice responded. "It's me."

Evelyn's breath hitched when she recognized Nathan's voice.

He ignored her previous comment entirely. "Would one billion dors secure our spot at the expo?"

At that moment, Evelyn sat in Julian's sleek sports car. "Nathan, what game are you playing?"

Seeing how overworked she'd been, Julian had insisted on taking her for a city tour. She'd protested but ultimately given in.

"If one billion isn't enough, name your price."

"And if that still doesn't work, I'll have to bring this matter before the International Commerce Board. Kingsley Industries isn't the only-"

"You-" Evelyn found herself speechless.

Julian, gripping the steering wheel, grew irritated and snatched her phone.

"Why so persistent? You're divorced now."

"Trying to win her back? Not happening. She's mine now. We're sharing a bed tonight!"

To Evelyn's shock, he ended the call and tossed her phone aside.

"Sharing a bed?"

"That'll drive him insane. Guaranteed."

Nathan's expression darkened as he lowered his phone.

Simon looked confused. "Ms. Carter resigned voluntarily. How did she even land that position at Kingsley Industries? Their hiring standards are notoriously strict."

Nathan wondered the same, which only worsened his mood.

"Book two tickets to Darai," he ordered coldly.

"Isn't Reginald Prescott still heading the International Commerce Board?"

"Yes, Mr. Sterling. He was reelected recently."

"Good. Inform Adrian we'll meet him in eight hours."

Adrian Prescott, Reginald's only son and heir to the Prescott fortune, was one of the wealthiest bachelors outside Eklora.

Known for his playboy lifestyle, he always traveled with an entourage of beautiful women.

He was also one of Nathan's few close friends, though their international lifestyles kept them apart.

Before departing, Nathan returned to Sterling Manor to pack.

As he entered, he spotted contractors exiting the elevator.

"Nathan, you-"

A sense of foreboding gripped him. Ignoring the two people on the couch, he strode straight to the elevator.

He headed directly for the third-floor master suite.

The room was unrecognizable. Every detail - from drapes to linens - had been replaced. All traces of Evelyn had been erased.

"Who authorized this?" he demanded furiously.

The trembling housekeeper answered, "Ms. Delaney."

Nathan's expression darkened further.

Before he could react, Isabella entered. "Nathan," she said smoothly.

"I know about you and Ms. Carter. Now that you're divorced, a refresh seemed appropriate. I hope you don't mind my initiative."

Nathan ignored her, turning instead to Eleanor.

"That woman left a ring behind," Eleanor quickly explained. "Isabella noticed it."

She'd been fielding Isabella's subtle interrogations all day.

"She planted it deliberately to cause trouble."

"What ring?" Nathan demanded.

He'd slept in this room nightly. How could Isabella spot something he'd missed?
###Chapter 15 Restoring the Past

Isabella extended her hand, revealing a simple silver band that caught the light. "This ring."

Nathan's breath hitched as he recognized it instantly. The only gift he'd ever given Evelyn during their three years of marriage.

His fingers trembled slightly as he took it, thumb tracing the engraved initials inside: N & E.

The memory surfaced unbidden - Evelyn's hopeful eyes as she'd asked him to slip it onto her finger. His dismissive "Later" still echoed in his ears.

Yet she'd worn it every single day since. He couldn't recall ever seeing her bare left hand.

Isabella's painted nails dug into her palm as she watched Nathan's faraway expression. She forced her lips into a practiced smile.

"This seems important. How could Ms. Carter forget it? Should we return it or—"

"Return it?" Vanessa scoffed, tossing her highlighted hair. "That snake pretended to be harmless, then stabbed us in the back without warning!"

Eleanor nodded in agreement. "I never trusted her from the beginning."

Nathan's jaw tightened. The phone call from earlier flashed through his mind - that man's smug voice. His grip on the ring turned white-knuckled.

So this was why she'd left in such a hurry. Already found her next victim.

"Toss it," he commanded, voice like ice.

Vanessa smirked. "Good riddance. Get rid of everything that woman ever touched."

"Absolutely," Eleanor added. "Replace it all with new things."

But Nathan remained motionless, the ring still clenched in his fist.

His gaze swept across the bedroom before landing on the housekeeper. "I don't tolerate interference in my private space. Have this room restored to its original state by tonight."

With that, he yanked at his tie and strode toward the walk-in closet to pack.

Isabella's face drained of color. She stood frozen, the cheerful facade crumbling.

"What's the big deal?" Vanessa flopped onto the chaise lounge with a huff. "Evelyn redecorated constantly to get his attention. He never complained then."

The irony wasn't lost on Isabella. When Evelyn lived here, Nathan avoided her. Now that she was gone, he guarded her things like sacred relics.

Something was very wrong.

Eleanor noticed Isabella's distress and swatted Vanessa's shoulder. "Hush!" Turning to Isabella, she adopted a soothing tone. "Nathan's particular about his belongings. Don't take it personally."

The words barely registered. Isabella couldn't tear her eyes from Nathan.

This was their marital bedroom. Evelyn's presence lingered in every corner. Of course he'd remember her here, in the bed they'd shared.

She understood with dawning horror - Nathan meant every word. The room would be stripped of all traces of Evelyn.

A cold realization settled in her stomach.

Nathan Sterling wasn't as indifferent to his ex-wife as he pretended.

As the closet door clicked shut behind him, a dangerous idea took root in Isabella's mind.
###Chapter 16 The Secretary Who Was My Wife

Nathan Sterling sat in the plush first-class seat of the private jet, staring at the pair of wedding rings in his palm—the ones he had ordered his housekeeper to discard.

After a long moment, he slid the larger ring onto his finger.

He had never worn it before. Yet it fit perfectly, as if it had been crafted just for him.

For three years, he had refused to wear it, claiming it was unprofessional for work.

Any other woman would have protested.

But Evelyn Carter hadn’t. She had been patient, understanding, always yielding to his whims.

He never imagined she would leave him so abruptly—so decisively. She hadn’t even taken her own ring with her.

Nathan twisted the band around his finger, his expression darkening.

Was she truly the docile, obedient wife he thought she was? Or was there a fiercer, more determined woman beneath the surface?

When the jet landed in Darai, Nathan went straight to the headquarters of Prescott Enterprises. Without hesitation, he strode into the CEO’s office.

Adrian Prescott squinted at his computer screen before picking up the proposal and scanning it again.

Then, he set the file down and sighed. "Nathan, I’ve double-checked. Sterling Enterprises meets all the requirements for the expo."

Nathan’s jaw tightened. So he had been right—Dominic Kingsley was the one blocking them.

"Did you piss off the president of Kingsley Industries?" Adrian asked, tapping his pen against the desk.

"The records show he used his veto power to exclude Sterling Enterprises from the event."

Nathan’s gaze turned icy.

"I’ve never even met him. My secretary handled everything. The negotiations were smooth until now. We were just waiting to sign the contract."

"Then where is she? Let her fix this," Adrian said with a smirk.

Nathan’s fingers curled into fists. "She resigned."

Adrian raised a brow. "Ah. So she’s the one sabotaging you."

"She quit and took valuable connections with her, costing you this deal. You had her sign a non-compete clause, right? Sue her."

Every word only stoked Nathan’s simmering fury.

Simon, sensing his boss’s mood, cleared his throat awkwardly. "Mr. Prescott, that secretary was Mr. Sterling’s wife."

Adrian’s eyes widened.

"Hell. Nathan, who did you marry? Some kind of superhuman? How did she juggle being your wife and your secretary?"

Nathan didn’t answer.

Adrian had never been one for tact, so Nathan was used to his bluntness.

And in this case, Adrian wasn’t wrong.

Evelyn had been exceptional—so efficient, so flawless, it was almost inhuman.

The realization weighed heavily on him.

All this time, he had only seen her as the perfect secretary, forgetting she had also been his wife.

Adrian stood and clapped Nathan on the shoulder with a teasing grin.

"When did you even get married? Why wasn’t I invited? You should’ve introduced me to your wife."

Though they were close friends, they rarely met, their family businesses based in different countries.

Nathan and Evelyn had married quietly, without any grand celebration.

Only a few of Nathan’s inner circle in Pamore, including Gregory Hammond, had known.

Most of them had looked down on Evelyn for her background, believing Nathan had settled for less.

So they never spoke of his marriage to others. To them, he was still the untouchable bachelor.

"They’re divorced now," Simon blurted out.

The moment the words left his mouth, he regretted them.

Simon ducked his head, bracing for Nathan’s glare. Why couldn’t he keep his mouth shut?

Adrian’s teasing expression faded. "Well… marriage isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, anyway. You’re better off."

Then he sighed, his own troubles surfacing.

"What’s wrong?" Nathan asked.

Adrian rubbed his temples. "My father is forcing me to marry Dominic Kingsley’s sister. She’s hideous. I’ve avoided her for years because she was overseas."

He groaned. "But now she’s back, and my old man won’t let it go. He’s already scheduled the damn wedding!"

"I refuse to go through with it."
###Chapter 17 Midnight Feast

"A marriage of convenience isn't so bad as long as you respect each other's boundaries," Nathan remarked casually, swirling his whiskey.

"You say that because profit is all you care about." Adrian scoffed. "We're nothing alike!"

"I want fireworks when I meet my future wife." His eyes sparkled with idealism. "She'll be stunningly gorgeous, razor-sharp intelligent - that's my dream woman."

Nathan waved him off. "You wouldn't get it."

Seeing no point in arguing, Nathan steered the conversation back to business. "Any solutions for the expo situation?"

Adrian thumped his chest confidently. "The Prescotts and Kingsley Industries are partners on this. One call to Dominic and it's sorted."

He reached for his phone, dialing with theatrical flair.

The call went unanswered. When Adrian tried again, Dominic declined it outright - the rejection couldn't be clearer.

Adrian set his phone down awkwardly, cheeks burning.

He'd promised his best friend this would be easy. Now he looked like a fool.

Rubbing his neck sheepishly, he offered, "Must be tied up with something. Let me treat you to a proper midnight feast. We'll figure this out later."

Nathan followed him out, already knowing the truth - Adrian couldn't help him here. His only hope remained Evelyn.

Meanwhile, in an exclusive VIP-only atelier where every stitch was couture perfection, Dominic lounged on a leather sofa radiating authority. He declined the call without hesitation, watching Evelyn being measured for a new gown.

"Nathan Sterling's in Darai," he mentioned casually. "Asking Adrian for favors."

His eyes studied Evelyn carefully, searching for any residual affection.

Evelyn remained impassive, turning slightly for the designer. "Let me handle Nathan."

The mirror reflected a transformed woman - radiant, confident, a far cry from the disheveled shadow who'd lived under the Sterlings' roof.

This was the real Evelyn Carter. Nathan Sterling could rot for all she cared.

"Darling!" A whirlwind of perfume and silk crashed into Evelyn, nearly toppling her. Olivia Sinclair clung to her like a koala. "Three years without a word! Do I mean nothing to you?"

Evelyn's eyes glistened. "You'll always mean everything." Her voice cracked. "I was... ashamed."

She swallowed hard. "You warned me about Nathan, but I wouldn't listen. Even fought with you. And now..."

"After the divorce, I couldn't face you."

Years flashed by - shuttering their boutique dreams to become Nathan's secretary at Sterling Enterprises. Olivia's protests. The bitter fight. Her friend's exile to Frenda.

Olivia gripped Evelyn's hands fiercely. "That idiot threw away a diamond! Welcome home, babe. Anyone messes with you now, they answer to me!"

Evelyn's tears spilled over as she laughed.

"None of that now." Olivia dabbed her cheeks with a tissue. "We're celebrating tonight! To dumping trash and upgrading to luxury!"

Evelyn squeezed her hand tighter, glancing at Dominic's watchful gaze.

How could she have been so blind? Trading unconditional love for a man who never deserved her?

Blood and chosen family - that was real. The rest was just painful lessons.
###Chapter 18 Mind Your Step

The exclusive nightclub in Darai pulsed with energy as Olivia Sinclair threw an extravagant celebration for Evelyn Carter.

Crystal chandeliers cast shimmering reflections across the dance floor where Olivia slung an arm around Evelyn, raising her champagne flute high.

"To my ride-or-die Evelyn - fresh out of hell and reborn like a damn phoenix!"

"Cheers!"

"To new beginnings!"

Evelyn drained her glass in one smooth motion before letting Olivia drag her through the glittering crowd.

"That's the heir to Titan Capital. Net worth? Let's just say he could buy this club ten times over."

"See the CEO of Veridian Holdings by the bar? That jawline could cut glass."

Evelyn followed as Olivia pointed out various VIPs. Turning abruptly, she collided with someone.

"Watch where you're going, you clumsy cow!" A familiar shrill voice pierced through the music.

Evelyn's lips curled in recognition. Vanessa Sterling - her ex-husband's spoiled sister.

Olivia immediately stepped between them. "Who the hell let this rabid chihuahua in here?"

Vanessa glared at her ruined designer heels before finally noticing Evelyn. "Oh look, it's my brother's discarded trash," she sneered.

She'd convinced Eleanor Blackwell to let her accompany Isabella Delaney to Darai, though not without considerable whining.

Olivia's fists clenched, but Evelyn restrained her with a calm hand. "Don't bother. She's not worth the energy."

The old Evelyn would've tolerated Vanessa for Nathan's sake. Now? The girl barely registered as a nuisance.

Her dismissive gaze slid past Vanessa to land on Isabella - noticeably pregnant in her loose designer tracksuit.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. Shouldn't the expectant mother be nesting instead of clubbing?

Isabella made no attempt to hide her hostility. She'd come to Darai specifically to discuss Evelyn with Nathan. Yet here stood the subject of their conversation - poised and unbothered.

Evelyn couldn't care less about either woman. She tugged Olivia's arm to leave.

Being ignored - especially by Evelyn - sent Vanessa into a rage. "You ruined Sterling Enterprises' expo deal! Fix it or I'll make sure you—"

Evelyn kept walking.

"You barren bitch! You must've already found your next sugar daddy to divorce Nathan so fast!"

Olivia wrenched free from Evelyn's grip, snatching a champagne flute from a passing server.

With perfect aim, she drenched Vanessa's designer outfit.

"This is my fucking party, sweetheart." Olivia leaned in, voice dripping venom. "Insult my best friend again and security will drag you out by your extensions."

The surrounding crowd erupted in laughter.

Humiliated, with mascara running down her cheeks, Vanessa turned desperately to Isabella. "Do something!"
###Chapter 19 Retribution Multiplied

The crowd surrounding Evelyn Carter was overwhelming, leaving Isabella Delaney utterly humiliated by the confrontation.

She stumbled backward instinctively, desperate to put distance between herself and Vanessa Sterling.

Olivia Sinclair swirled her champagne flute before turning with icy precision. "Your sister's being publicly shamed. Won't you defend your family's honor?" she taunted.

"What's happening here?" A thunderous voice cut through the murmurs.

The sea of guests parted to reveal Nathan Sterling, his stormy expression darkening with each approaching stride.

His gaze locked onto Evelyn immediately.

Months had passed since their last encounter. She'd gained healthy weight, her complexion glowing beneath the chandeliers - a stark contrast to the gaunt woman he'd last seen.

Her emerald gown accentuated every curve, the neckline framing her radiant smile. She looked like royalty reborn.

He couldn't look away.

Vanessa spotted her brother and immediately regained her bravado. "Nathan! They're attacking us!" she shrieked, pointing accusingly.

Nathan's sharp eyes took in his sister's ruined makeup and Isabella's trembling form. The crowd held its breath.

"Bullying defenseless women? How noble." His voice dripped sarcasm.

Evelyn merely shrugged. "Believe what you want."

Her smirk held centuries of unspoken retribution. "Though you should know your sister's true nature by now."

Olivia stepped forward, eyes blazing. "Get out! Sterlings aren't welcome at my events!"

The gathered elite quickly voiced their support:

"She insulted them first!"
"That vile comment about infertility!"
"Threatened to call police over spilled champagne!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. He knew Vanessa's temperament all too well. "Is this true?" he demanded.

Vanessa dropped her gaze, suddenly fascinated by her ruined shoes.

Isabella seized the moment, crafting her perfect victim persona. "It's my fault, Nathan. I should've stopped her." Her voice trembled artfully.

Turning to Evelyn with tear-brightened eyes: "Ms. Carter, I never knew about your... condition when Nathan and I... If I could undo it all..."

She clutched her stomach dramatically. "Please don't take it out on Sterling Enterprises."

Her performance painted Evelyn as the bitter ex seeking corporate vengeance.

Olivia saw through the act instantly. "You homewrecking hypocrite!" She snatched a champagne bottle from a nearby tray.

Evelyn caught her wrist. "She's carrying a child. Not worth it."

Isabella chose that moment to swoon dramatically into Nathan's arms.

Nathan shoved Olivia back with enough force to send her stumbling. Only Evelyn's quick reflexes prevented a fall.

Once Olivia steadied herself, Evelyn moved like lightning.

The crack of her palm against Isabella's cheek echoed through the ballroom. Isabella staggered, clutching her flaming cheek in shock.

No one had ever dared strike her before.

Evelyn flexed her stinging fingers, locking eyes with Nathan. "Touch Olivia again," she vowed, "and I'll make sure Isabella receives twice the pain. Let's see how many blows your delicate flower can withstand."

The deadly promise hung in the air between them.

Not a soul present doubted she meant every word.
###Chapter 20 Not a Single Soul Dares to Contradict Her

"Grandmother acts like she's some kind of divine blessing to this family. The way she dotes on Evelyn, you'd think she walked on water!"

"Not a single soul dares to contradict her. The only person who ever dared mention grandchildren was Mother!"

Nathan's expression darkened like storm clouds gathering.

In all his years at Sterling Manor, he'd only known peace and quiet. Never once had he heard raised voices or arguments.

A disturbing thought struck him - had Evelyn been suffering in silence all this time? His fingers moved before he could stop them, pulling out his phone to text her.

Meanwhile, in the guest bedroom, Evelyn was lounging across the bed, giggling with Olivia over some private joke.

The sudden ping of her phone interrupted their laughter.

She glanced at the screen and immediately rolled her eyes so hard it hurt.
###Chapter 21 The Assistant's Grand Entrance

Nathan's message popped up on my screen like an unwelcome intruder.

"Today's incident was entirely Vanessa's fault. She'll apologize, but you must apologize to Isabella too!"

My fingers trembled with rage as I read the absurd demand. "What absolute garbage is this man spewing?" I muttered under my breath before decisively blocking his number.

Olivia leaned against my dresser with a mischievous grin. "Darling, you're attending the gala with Dominic tomorrow, yes? Let me style you - I insist on seeing your wardrobe first."

"Be my guest," I waved her toward the walk-in closet.

The moment the doors swung open, Olivia gasped. "Holy couture! This is larger than our flagship boutique in Manhattan!"

The three-level closet beneath my bedroom suite overflowed with designer gowns and rare jewels. Dominic had commissioned the renovation as a homecoming gift, completing it just yesterday.

"My walk-in seems pathetic compared to this fashion paradise," Olivia marveled, running her fingers through racks of silk and chiffon.

I held a sapphire-blue Gucci against my frame before the full-length mirror. "Might need expansion soon if I keep acquiring pieces."

How naive I'd been before - why reject family wealth and comfort?

A crisp knock interrupted us. Walter entered with two attendants pushing a rolling rack of pristine garment bags.

"Miss Evelyn, Prada's private collection just arrived. Each piece has been custom-fitted to your measurements." His gloved hand gestured gracefully. "These designs won't hit stores for months - you get first selection."

Olivia squealed, planting an enthusiastic kiss on my cheek. "You magnificent creature!"

Our laughter echoed through the spacious room.

Across town, Nathan glared at his phone screen where a single gray tick mocked him. Evelyn never powered off her devices - she'd deliberately blocked him.

The phone shattered against leather upholstery, making Vanessa jump.

That infuriating woman! Blocking him like some insignificant nuisance.

Clearly, Evelyn wouldn't assist with his business crisis. "Any response from Kingsley Industries?" he snapped at Simon.

Simon adjusted his tie nervously. "Still radio silence, sir."

Nathan yanked at his constricting neckwear. "Did you secure Dominic Kingsley's schedule?"

"Confirmed - he's attending Kristina's charity auction tomorrow evening."

Nathan's jaw tightened. "We're going. Make arrangements."

Vanessa perked up immediately. "Nathan, please let me come! I've never seen a proper auction."

"This isn't a field trip. You'll only distract me."

"But Nathan-"

When her pleading failed, Vanessa turned to Isabella, who'd been feigning sleep. "Isabella, help me. I promise to behave perfectly."

Isabella fluttered her lashes awake. "Nathan darling, I'll supervise Vanessa personally. No disruptions, I guarantee."

With Isabella's assurance, Nathan reluctantly agreed.

Kristina's auction drew Darai's elite like moths to flame.

A midnight blue Rolls-Royce purred to a stop at the venue. Nathan emerged with Isabella clinging to his arm - the picture of power and grace with her delicate beauty complementing his commanding presence.

Vanessa stumbled out behind them, awkwardly smoothing her ill-fitting gown.

Well-wishers immediately swarmed the striking couple. Then murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Only Kingsley Industries would send an assistant with this much fanfare," someone whispered.

The doors of a pearl-white Lincoln swung open. Every head turned as I emerged in a blood-red Valentino, the gown's train fluttering like victory banners behind me.
###Chapter 22 The Price of Pride

Evelyn Carter was a vision that evening.

Her raven locks cascaded down her back like liquid silk. The custom-designed gown she wore shimmered under the chandelier lights, its intricate beadwork catching every gaze in the room.

All eyes followed her graceful movements.

She approached Nathan Sterling with deliberate steps.

Nathan's stormy gaze tracked her every move, his expression unreadable.

This wasn't the timid woman he'd married. The Evelyn before him now carried herself with regal confidence.

She'd transformed completely.

"Mr. Sterling, your persistence is truly remarkable," Evelyn said, her crimson lips curling in amusement.

"Where's your benefactor?" Nathan demanded coldly.

Evelyn's laughter tinkled like crystal. "As you can see, I came alone. Feeling disappointed?"

So his pathetic messages had failed, and now he sought out Dominic instead.

He'd have to get past her first.

Nathan's jaw tightened when he realized she'd seen through his ploy. Her mocking smile only fueled his irritation.

The auction coordinator rushed forward. "Ms. Carter, your private booth is ready."

Without sparing Nathan another glance, Evelyn swept past him.

Vanessa Sterling leaned close to whisper, "See? I told you she found herself a sugar daddy. No way she could afford this otherwise."

Nathan's grip on his champagne flute tightened. "Enough," he snapped.

Recognizing his dangerous mood, Vanessa fell silent.

Isabella Delaney touched Nathan's arm gently. "Shall we?"

The auction commenced precisely at eight.

Spotlights illuminated the first item - a diamond bracelet glittering under the display lights.

"Opening bid at two hundred thousand dollars!"

Evelyn recalled Margaret Winslow's upcoming birthday. She raised her paddle. "Three hundred thousand."

"Three hundred thousand to the lady in front!"

Isabella immediately countered. "Five hundred thousand." She turned to Nathan with calculated sweetness. "This would complement your grandmother perfectly, don't you think?"

Nathan gave a curt nod.

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "Six hundred thousand."

That was her reasonable limit. The piece wasn't worth more.

"One million!" Isabella announced triumphantly.

She knew Evelyn's financial situation. The divorce settlement couldn't have exceeded seven figures. Meanwhile, money meant nothing to the Delaney heiress.

Their eyes met across the room. Evelyn's lips curved.

"Five million."

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Even the auctioneer faltered.

"F-five million, going once!"

Isabella's face flushed. "Ten million!"

Nathan frowned. "That's excessive."

"For Margaret, nothing is too much," Isabella simpered.

"Thirty million," Evelyn countered calmly.

The audience erupted in murmurs. Isabella's hands trembled on her paddle.

"Thirty-one million!" she choked out.

The auctioneer's voice rose. "Thirty-one million, going once! Twice!"

Isabella's panic grew. Why wasn't Evelyn bidding?

"Sold! To Ms. Delaney for thirty-one million!"

Only then did Isabella realize she'd been played. The smug satisfaction in Evelyn's eyes confirmed it - she'd just paid thirty-one million for a bracelet worth two hundred thousand.
###Chapter 23 The Allure of Beauty

The auction staff moved with practiced efficiency. During a brief intermission, they discreetly delivered the bracelet to Isabella and stood expectantly, awaiting her payment.

Every participant had undergone rigorous financial verification prior to the event. Backing out after winning a bid wasn't an option - the organizers would immediately pursue legal action against defaulters through their corporations.

Isabella's hand trembled visibly as she signed the exorbitant check.

Several rows behind her, Adrian Prescott barely concealed his amusement. "Fortune smiles upon me today," he murmured. "How rare to find someone willing to pay triple an item's worth."

The bracelet's true value barely touched three hundred thousand.

He'd been swindled by a dishonest jeweler, purchasing it for five hundred thousand as a gift for his mother. When she'd rejected it, he'd been forced to liquidate the unwanted present.

His gaze drifted toward Evelyn Carter, who had participated in the bidding. She was stunning - the kind of beauty that demanded appreciation.

But more intriguing than her looks was her mysterious aura.

Adrian's interest sharpened.

"She seems familiar," he remarked to the HB Group executive beside him. "Who is she?"

"That's Evelyn Carter," came the reply.

"Evelyn Carter?" Adrian repeated, recalling the sickly girl from the Carter family rumors. The contrast was too stark.

Impossible.

He blinked, studying Evelyn again. "Must be a coincidence. Just sharing the same name."

The auction resumed with the next lot.

"An antique Epigny pocket watch! Opening bid - five million!"

This was the item Dominic Kingsley had instructed Evelyn to acquire. Without hesitation, she raised her paddle. "Six million!"

"Six point five million!"

Without Isabella's interference, the bidding proceeded smoothly. Evelyn secured the watch for seven million.

Isabella seethed with silent fury but dared not challenge Evelyn again, fearing another financial trap.

Her funds were depleted regardless.

Leaning toward Nathan Sterling, she whispered poisonously, "Evelyn's transformed remarkably, Nathan. She took nothing in the divorce, didn't she?"

"Where does an assistant - even to Kingsley Industries' president - get such wealth? Seven million for a pocket watch seems... excessive."

She watched Nathan's reaction carefully.

"They say Dominic Kingsley trusts her with critical projects, just like you once did..."

Each word darkened Nathan's expression further. An inexplicable rage simmered within him.

Just like when she'd been with him?

Was history repeating itself with Dominic?

Before Isabella could continue, Nathan cut her off coldly. "Are you done here? If not, we're leaving."

Recognizing his dangerous mood, Isabella immediately backtracked. "Forgive me, Nathan. I spoke out of turn."

"Let's go."

As major stakeholders in Kristina's auction house, Kingsley Industries enjoyed certain privileges. Evelyn was escorted to an exclusive VVIP lounge to finalize her purchase.

After signing the necessary documents, the staff discreetly withdrew, leaving her alone with the antique watch.

She was examining the timepiece when the door burst open.

Nathan stood framed in the doorway, eyes blazing with barely contained fury. "What exactly is your relationship with Dominic Kingsley?" he demanded.

He'd left Isabella waiting in the car, claiming a need for the restroom. But this confrontation couldn't wait.
###Chapter 24 Blind to the Truth

"Why should I answer that? What makes you think you deserve an explanation?" Evelyn rose gracefully, her piercing gaze filled with contempt as she stared down Nathan.

The realization hit Nathan like a tidal wave - their divorce severed any claim he had over her personal life. Yet the image of another man holding her sent an unfamiliar pang through his chest.

She had been his. Should still be his. This irrational possessiveness surprised even him.

"What really ended us?" His voice was ice.

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "After all this time? What's the point?"

Meeting his stormy eyes without flinching, she declared, "I left because I couldn't stand another moment of your neglect!"

"Neglect?" Nathan scoffed. "For three years, I provided everything - designer wardrobes, gourmet meals, a vice president position. How does your life differ now?"

His mind flashed to their last night together before the divorce papers came. The way she'd seduced him with desperate intensity.

"Was it the sex?" The words tasted sour. "Is that what you lacked?"

He'd avoided intimacy after overhearing her whisper another man's name in her sleep. His pride couldn't stomach being second choice.

Evelyn's incredulous laugh cut through the tension. "You're unbelievable!"

"I can give you that now." In three strides, Nathan had her face cradled in his hands, his lips descending.

The slap echoed through the room.

Nathan worked his jaw, tasting blood. Rage and confusion warred within him. The woman before him was a stranger.

Tears glistened in Evelyn's eyes, her chest heaving. Did this arrogant fool truly believe their marriage collapsed over bedroom matters?

Why had she ever loved someone so emotionally stunted?

Composing herself, she spoke with chilling clarity. "For three years, you saw only what suited you. You might as well have been blind."

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "No, I was the blind one. To think you'd ever change. Ever love me."

Picking up her clutch, she moved past him. "Sign the papers, Nathan. Or I'll have my lawyers handle it."

The door slammed with finality.

Nathan stood frozen, haunted by the devastation in Evelyn's eyes. Had he truly made her that miserable?

On the moonlit balcony, Evelyn gripped the railing until her knuckles whitened. The ocean breeze did little to soothe her frayed nerves.

"Allow me."

A monogrammed handkerchief appeared beside her.

Turning, she found herself facing a devastatingly handsome stranger. His tailored suit hugged broad shoulders, and his smirk held practiced charm.

When she hesitated, Adrian Prescott gently dabbed her tears himself. "Eyes like yours shouldn't be red from crying. Let me weep for you instead."

He'd followed the intriguing woman from the auction, finding her even more captivating under the stars - her gown fluttering like a wounded butterfly, tears tracing delicate paths down her cheeks.

Evelyn surprised herself by laughing. Accepting the handkerchief, she wiped her face.

"Adrian Prescott, at your service." He bowed slightly. "President of Prescott Holdings. And you are?"

Recognition flashed across Evelyn's face. "Ah, the man who drove up the price on my bracelet. I'll send you a thank you gift." Her smile vanished. So this was her auction rival.
###Chapter 25 The Pursuit Begins

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms as she fought the urge to punch him.

This was the man Dominic wanted her to marry—the heir of the Prescott family, Adrian Prescott.

An arranged marriage alone wouldn't have infuriated her so much.

What truly set her blood boiling were the cruel rumors he'd spread since childhood, mocking her appearance when they were barely five years old.

He'd even publicly sworn he would never marry her.

As if she'd ever consider it!

If not for Reginald Prescott being her father's mentor, she would've taught Adrian a painful lesson already.

Adrian kept rambling, completely oblivious to Evelyn's darkening expression.

He had no idea this was the same Evelyn Carter he'd tormented for years. "Could I get your—"

The handkerchief hit his face before he could finish. By the time he caught it, Evelyn had already stormed off.

Adrian blinked at her retreating figure, utterly confused.

What had he said wrong?

The damp cloth crumpled in his fist as he watched her disappear into the crowd.

Then his lips curled into a predatory smile. "Feisty. I like that."

His phone buzzed to life as he opened his elite group chat.

AceAdrian: "Gentlemen, prepare your congratulations. I've found my future wife."

Gregory: "You're drunk again."

Trevor: "Let me guess—another supermodel with the IQ of a goldfish?"

AceAdrian: "Wrong. She's brilliant, breathtaking, and just put me in my place. It was glorious."

HopelessRomantic: "This is destiny! She's perfect!"

Gregory: "Spare us. You'll forget her name by tomorrow."

HopelessRomantic: "Not this time. I'm turning over a new leaf. One month—that's all I need to make her mine."

Trevor: "I'd sooner believe pigs can fly."

HopelessRomantic: "Care to wager? When I win, I'll send you all our wedding invitation."

Back at Kingsley Manor, Evelyn entered the study where Dominic was working. "The pocket watch you wanted." She placed the velvet box on his desk.

"Appreciated." Dominic barely glanced up from his tablet, setting the box aside without opening it.

"I didn't realize you collected antiques." Her tone held subtle accusation.

Dominic finally met her gaze. "There's much you don't know about me, little sister."

The air between them crackled with unspoken tension as Evelyn studied her brother's impassive face. What game was he playing now?
###Chapter 26 You've Met Him Before.

"It's for a friend," Dominic said without glancing up from his task.

Evelyn pulled up a chair beside him, her curiosity piqued. "What friend? Tell me everything."

The delicate wristwatch in his hands was unmistakably feminine - far too elegant for Dominic's usual minimalist style.

Dominic Kingsley wasn't known for having close female acquaintances. Why would he be purchasing such an obviously feminine timepiece?

Evelyn's instincts tingled with suspicion.

Setting down his tablet, Dominic finally met her gaze. "Harrison Whitmore asked me to pick this up for Aunt Beatrice."

"Harrison Whitmore?" Evelyn blinked rapidly, trying to place the name.

"You've met him before. Does it ring any bells?"

Evelyn nodded slowly, then shook her head. "The name sounds familiar... but I don't think we ever really connected."

Her fragmented memories painted Harrison as someone raised solely by his mother. He'd taken over his father's empire while still in his early twenties.

His serious demeanor had always made him seem older than his years, creating an invisible barrier between them.

The study door swung open abruptly. Walter stood at attention. "Sir, Mr. Sterling of Sterling Enterprises is here to see you."

Evelyn scoffed under her breath. Just as she'd predicted, Nathan had reached his breaking point.

"Did he honestly believe I'd meet with him when even Adrian Prescott failed to change my mind?" Dominic's voice dripped with icy disdain.

"Send him away."

"But sir—"

"But what?"

Walter hesitated before delivering the bombshell. "Reginald Prescott is with him. He's requesting an audience as well."

Dominic could dismiss Nathan Sterling, but refusing Reginald Prescott wasn't an option.

With visible reluctance, he rose from his chair. "Escort them to the drawing room. I'll be there shortly."

Turning to Evelyn, his expression softened slightly. "Stay here. I'll handle this."

Evelyn gave a tight nod, watching as her brother strode out with purposeful steps.
###Chapter 27 Just Sign the Divorce Papers

"Evelyn is returning to Sterling City?" Nathan's eyes lit up with excitement.

"Since she's going back, should we discuss the arranged marriage between our families?"

Dominic remained composed, unlike Nathan's visible enthusiasm. "That depends entirely on them. It's their marriage, after all."

Nathan understood the unspoken message.

He knew his son too well. Having lost his wife early, he'd spoiled Adrian rotten.

Though Adrian managed Prescott Corporation competently, his personal life was scandalous. From wild parties to endless flings, he'd done it all.

Far from the ideal match for the Kingsley heiress.

Evelyn was the cherished only daughter of the Kingsley family. Her overprotective brothers would never allow her to marry someone like Adrian.

Nathan remembered Evelyn - beautiful, intelligent, kind. The perfect daughter-in-law.

He'd have to send Adrian to Sterling City immediately. This might be his last chance to secure the match.

Excusing himself hastily, Nathan rushed home to deliver the news. Dominic saw him out politely.

Returning to the living room, Dominic found Evelyn emerging from the study.

"Dominic, you're sending me to Sterling City?"

His expression turned serious. "Yes. You know the city best. You'll oversee our expansion strategy there. But the choice is yours."

Determination flashed in Evelyn's eyes. "I'll go."

"Remember," Dominic cautioned, "you'll represent Kingsley Industries in Sterling City."

"The company comes first. Personal feelings can't influence business decisions."

Nathan's recent defeat in Darai would have repercussions. Kingsley's Sterling branches would face the backlash first.

He wouldn't force her if she refused.

Evelyn understood perfectly. The company's future hung in the balance.

"Don't worry, Dominic. I know this is my chance to prove myself."

"Many questioned my sudden promotion. Handling smaller branches first will silence the doubters before I return to headquarters."

Dominic nodded approvingly. "Good. You've grasped the situation perfectly."

"But..." Evelyn's expression turned playful.

"But what?"

"If I'm in Sterling City, I won't see you every day!" She grinned mischievously.

Dominic's stern expression softened instantly. All traces of anger from Nathan's visit disappeared.

He ruffled her hair affectionately. "Always the charmer. I'll visit whenever possible."

"Promise?"

"Promise."

Meanwhile at Sterling Manor, Nathan stormed in, ripping off his tie in frustration. Vanessa and Isabella trailed silently behind, not daring to speak.

In his study, Nathan poured a generous glass of whiskey, staring out the window darkly.

Without Kingsley's support, he'd overspent massively to secure the expo slot.

Total defeat in Darai.

And Evelyn had orchestrated it all.

His greatest supporter had become his fiercest opponent, standing firmly against him now.

She'd clearly severed all ties.

His grip tightened around the glass as emotions churned violently.

The phone rang abruptly. "Yes?" he growled.

"Mr. Sterling," Simon hesitated, "the lawyers just received divorce papers. Ms. Carter's attorney conveyed a message..."

His assistant's nervous pause signaled bad news.

"What did she say?" Nathan snapped.

"That her lawyer will handle all divorce proceedings henceforth. Since you refused mediation, she's proceeding with..."

Simon trailed off, bracing for the explosion.

The shattering of glass answered first. Even through the phone, Simon broke into a cold sweat.

Evelyn had truly pushed Nathan to the edge this time.
###Chapter 28 You Heartless Woman

"If she's so determined to end this marriage, then let it be done!" Nathan's voice boomed through the penthouse, his fingers tightening around the whiskey glass.

"Contact my attorney. Schedule the divorce proceedings at City Hall immediately."

Simon hesitated on the line. "Mr. Sterling, she's insisting on expediting the process. Her legal team is prepared to adjust to our schedule."

The crystal tumbler shattered against the marble floor as Nathan hurled his phone across the room.

His temples throbbed as he pressed his palms against his forehead.

"You heartless woman, Evelyn!"

Meanwhile at Kingsley Industries' Pamore headquarters, Evelyn strode into the executive boardroom with Olivia at her side.

Their reconciliation had led Olivia to postpone her return to Frenda. She'd chosen to support Evelyn's corporate ascent while managing their joint fashion venture.

"Gentlemen," Evelyn addressed the room with polished professionalism. "I'm Evelyn Carter, newly appointed General Manager by Kingsley Industries' headquarters. This is Olivia Sinclair, my strategic advisor."

She let her gaze sweep across the assembled executives. "I look forward to building Kingsley Industries' success together."

Most department heads were transplants from Darai, having established their power structures during the year-long setup phase.

The GM position had been their coveted prize - until corporate parachuted in this outsider.

Their research had uncovered only her three-year tenure as Sterling Enterprises' executive assistant. Nothing more.

"Welcome, Ms. Carter."

The greetings came through gritted teeth. All except one.

Trevor Maddox from R&D leaned back with a smirk. "So the Sterling Enterprises secretary becomes Kingsley Industries' general manager overnight."

His fingers drummed the conference table. "Should we be concerned about corporate espionage?"

Olivia's nails dug into her leather portfolio. Evelyn's subtle headshake stopped her intervention.

Trevor had been the frontrunner for GM before Evelyn's appointment. His department's performance metrics topped all divisions.

This was his opening salvo.

Evelyn's crimson lips curved without warmth. "Corporate oversight isn't your concern, Mr. Maddox. Kingsley's board doesn't make reckless appointments."

She'd studied each executive's dossier en route from Darai. Trevor's rebellion was anticipated.

"Well I don't recognize this appointment!" Trevor shoved back his chair. "I won't work under some corporate nepotism hire!"

The room froze. This was mutiny against headquarters' decree.

Evelyn didn't blink. She signaled the minute-taker. "Draft Mr. Maddox's termination papers. I'll sign them now."

The air crystallized.

Trevor's bravado faltered. This wasn't the reaction he'd anticipated from the supposed figurehead.

The secretary stood abruptly. "I'll prepare the documents immediately."

As she moved toward the door, Trevor's resolve crumbled. He forced a laugh. "Merely testing your mettle, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn's glacial stare didn't waver. "I don't test. I execute."

Sweat beaded on Trevor's brow. "My apologies. That was... unprofessional. You have my full cooperation."

"Meeting adjourned."

Evelyn's stilettos clicked decisively across the marble as she exited, Olivia falling into step beside her. The message had been delivered - this was no puppet regime.
###Chapter 29 The Vipers Return

A sleek five-story office building dominated the high street, its entire facade gleaming with stainless steel.

Today marked the grand reopening of Olivia Sinclair's boutique.

Three years had passed since she last designed anything. Now she was reclaiming her place in the fashion world.

This new location outshone her previous boutique in every way.

The interior dazzled with avant-garde decor—spotlights highlighting meticulously curated garments and jewelry. Minimalist yet sophisticated, it reflected Olivia's impeccable taste.

Back in the day, Evelyn Carter and Olivia's designs had been the talk of Pamore's elite. Their creations were must-haves for every socialite.

A line of wealthy women already snaked around the block before opening. Clutching reservation numbers, they waited eagerly for their turn.

Evelyn had taken time away from Kingsley Industries to assist with styling clients.

The morning flew by in a whirlwind of fabric swatches and accessories. By lunchtime, both women collapsed onto a plush velvet couch, utterly drained.

Olivia rested her head against Evelyn's shoulder. "Does this feel familiar?"

"Like we've traveled back in time," Evelyn murmured with a tired smile, brushing a stray lock from Olivia's face. "I'm so glad you're doing this again."

"Me too."

Olivia excused herself to check on upstairs clients, insisting Evelyn take a proper break.

Alone on the couch, Evelyn's sharp eyes caught movement near the entrance. Vanessa Sterling and Isabella Delaney had arrived.

Vanessa wore last season's designer dress, pausing every few steps to snap selfies. After curating the perfect gallery, she posted with the caption: "Spoiling myself at Pamore's hottest new boutique!"

Dragging Isabella along, Vanessa held up an emerald-green gown. "Don't you think this would look divine on me?" Her unspoken request hung heavy in the air.

Isabella, still recovering from her 31-million-dollar bracelet purchase, pretended not to understand. She drifted toward the accessories display instead.

Vanessa's lips pursed in displeasure. Spotting Evelyn, she grabbed Isabella's arm. "Well, well. I didn't realize they allowed divorcees in establishments like this." She surveyed the boutique with exaggerated disdain. "Perhaps it's not as exclusive as advertised."

Exhaustion made Evelyn blunt. "The door works both ways."

Vanessa's face flushed crimson. "How dare you! I'm a paying customer!" She snapped her fingers at a nearby associate. "Fetch the owner! This woman is ruining my shopping experience!"

Evelyn crossed her legs, smoothing her skirt. "You're looking at her."

Vanessa's mouth fell open. "You? That's impossible!"

Isabella stepped forward with a saccharine smile. "Since you're the owner, Ms. Carter, perhaps you could style me? I need something spectacular for my upcoming wedding."

The unspoken challenge hung between them—this was payback for the bracelet incident.

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her frosty gaze. She remained seated.

"Is there a problem?" Isabella pressed. "Shouldn't boutique owners cater to their clients?"

Evelyn rose gracefully. "I absolutely serve my clients." Her heels clicked against the marble as she approached. "But your names aren't on today's guest list."

Two spots of color appeared on Isabella's cheeks. Vanessa looked ready to combust.

The truth was undeniable—they'd crashed the event using someone else's invitation, desperate to stay relevant in Pamore's ever-shifting social hierarchy.
###Chapter 30 The Secret Behind Their Marriage

"Counterfeit invitations hold no validity here," Evelyn stated, arching one perfectly sculpted brow with deliberate condescension.

"You're hardly worth my time."

She added with a calculated pause, "Though if you spend over fifty thousand today, I might reconsider serving you."

The Delaney fortune wasn't bottomless. Isabella had limited funds, and after squandering thirty-one million on that diamond bracelet, Evelyn knew she was financially drained.

Even if she miraculously scraped together the money, it would only boost Olivia's sales figures.

Either outcome meant victory for Evelyn.

Vanessa, ever the fool, started egging Isabella on. "Let's buy out this entire store! That'll show her!"

Isabella kept her gaze lowered, pointedly ignoring Vanessa's outburst.

"Financial difficulties?" Evelyn projected her voice just enough for surrounding shoppers to hear.

"If you're broke, why waste money on black market invitations to gawk at what you can't afford? Security will have to escort you out."

High society could be vicious. Within minutes, gossipmongers were already live-tweeting the scene.

Notifications pinged across the boutique as the scandal spread.

Isabella and Vanessa stood frozen as muffled laughter surrounded them.

Humiliation burned through them.

"Evelyn, your arrogance will be your downfall," Isabella hissed through clenched teeth, her cheeks flaming.

Evelyn's smile remained unshaken. "And what will you do about it? This is simply who I am."

On cue, sunglass-clad security personnel materialized behind the two women, gesturing firmly toward the exit.

They fled the boutique under a hail of whispered judgment.

The disastrous encounter killed Isabella's shopping mood entirely.

After berating Vanessa, she stormed to her waiting car, abandoning her companion to seethe alone on the sidewalk.

Vanessa's rage grew with each passing minute. She yanked out her phone and dialed Nathan.

Nathan was at a downtown lounge with his inner circle when Vanessa's call came through.

"Nathan! Evelyn's gone too far this time!"

Her screeching voice made him wince, the mention of Evelyn's name intensifying his headache.

"What now?" he snapped.

"She humiliated Isabella and me! Called us paupers and had security throw us out!"

"You must divorce that woman immediately! I can't stand the sight of her!"

Nathan terminated the call mid-tirade. He drained his whiskey in one swallow.

Gregory, seated beside him, had overheard the entire exchange.

He refilled Nathan's glass. "We've got your back if you file for divorce."

"That scheming gold-digger trapped you by exploiting your grandmother's gratitude."

"Now that she's successful, she's discarding you and tormenting your sister and Isabella. We warned you—"

"Enough," Nathan cut him off sharply.

For reasons he couldn't explain, he couldn't tolerate anyone speaking ill of Evelyn.

He fixed Gregory with a dangerous stare. "Is that your genuine opinion of her?"

Gregory gestured toward their card-playing friends. "Not just mine. Everyone thinks so."

"She's just some peasant who got lucky with her looks. None of us approved. She only landed at Sterling Enterprises because of you. What real talent does she have?"

He took a swig of bourbon. "You kept the marriage secret because you're ashamed of her, right?"

Nathan's fingers tightened around his glass. He yanked at his constricting tie.

The truth was, he'd chosen secrecy to protect Evelyn from society's vipers.

He never anticipated this would lead to such gross misinterpretations. Because of it, Gregory believed he despised Evelyn, that he'd never truly accepted her as his wife.

If his closest friends thought this way, had Evelyn been laboring under the same painful misconception?
###Chapter 31 The Final Stamp

Three days later, the lawyers from both sides assembled at City Hall for the divorce proceedings. Evelyn Carter arrived precisely on time, her heels clicking against the marble floors with purpose. Nathan Sterling followed moments later, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn completed the paperwork swiftly, her pen moving without hesitation. Nathan, however, stared blankly at the forms before him.

"Time is money, Mr. Sterling," she remarked coolly, not bothering to look at him.

Nathan's jaw tightened at her tone. He finally began filling out the documents with deliberate strokes. When finished, they slid the papers through the service window together.

"Wait." Nathan's command halted the clerk's hand just as she prepared to stamp their divorce decree.

The young woman's eyes widened when she recognized the CEO of Sterling Enterprises and his former executive assistant. She'd expected wedding announcements from this power couple - not dissolution papers.

Nathan turned to Evelyn, using that infuriatingly superior tone she knew too well. "Last chance to reconsider."

All the extravagant spending in Darai, the public humiliation, Isabella's pregnancy - he'd overlook everything if she'd just back down now.

Evelyn's lips curled in derision. "Still playing the magnanimous benefactor? How very...you."

The weight pressing against Nathan's chest intensified as he recognized the finality in her gaze. Something vital was slipping through his fingers.

Since Evelyn left, he'd realized they'd never truly communicated. His voice softened unexpectedly. "We should talk properly. I never acknowledged your contributions to Sterling Enterprises these past three years."

His dark eyes held hers. "You belong in my home. In my company."

Evelyn actually laughed. "Too little, too late. Isabella's practically ready to deliver your heir. What exactly are you offering her? The mistress suite?"

"I'll handle Isabella," Nathan said, an unfamiliar desperation coloring his words.

They stood at the precipice of divorce, yet this arrogant man still believed she'd come crawling back. The realization made Evelyn's blood boil.

"Your ego is truly staggering," she spat. "Did you actually think sweet words would undo years of neglect?"

Nathan's composure shattered. "You'll regret this," he hissed.

"Not in this lifetime," Evelyn countered without missing a beat. To the clerk she said, "Proceed."

The stamp came down with finality. Evelyn snatched her copy and strode out without a backward glance, leaving Nathan rooted in place.

His gaze tracked her retreating figure. Three years of marriage erased in three minutes. She left nothing behind - not even a trace of perfume. The hollowness that followed nearly brought him to his knees.

At Sterling Manor, Eleanor Blackwell had prepared a lavish celebration. Isabella Delaney wore crimson silk - a bold departure from her usual pastel modesty. The scene resembled a wedding feast more than a divorce party.

"Finally free of that gold-digging wretch!" Eleanor raised her champagne flute triumphantly.

Vanessa Sterling clinked glasses eagerly. "Now you can marry properly, Nathan."

Isabella lifted her juice glass with a demure smile. "To new beginnings," she murmured sweetly.
###Chapter 32 False Accusations

Isabella's heart swelled with triumph. After years of patient scheming, Nathan Sterling was finally within her grasp. If he got down on one knee this very moment, she'd scream her acceptance before he could finish the question.

Yet the man of the hour remained disturbingly silent. His jaw clenched visibly, storm clouds gathering in his piercing blue eyes as he pressed his lips into a thin line.

The memory of Evelyn's departure haunted him like a stubborn ghost.

Vanessa sensed the tension thickening the air. "Say something, Nathan! This celebration's turning into a funeral with your gloomy face."

Eleanor Blackwell nodded vigorously. "Honestly, that bad luck charm is finally gone. You should be celebrating hardest of all. Why the long face?"

She turned to beam at Isabella. "All I want now is for you two to marry quickly and give me a grandchild."

A delicate blush colored Isabella's cheeks. "These things take time, Mrs. Blackwell."

Nathan's glacial gaze swept over them. "Grandmother mustn't hear about the divorce," he stated icily.

Isabella's smile froze. What game was he playing? Hadn't they agreed? Would her child be branded illegitimate now?

Tears welled in her eyes as she placed a protective hand on her stomach. "What about us? What about our baby, Nathan?"

A single tear traced down her cheek, darkening the fabric of her designer dress.

Nathan inhaled sharply, visibly restraining his irritation. "I'll handle it. Excuse me." With that, he strode toward the staircase, leaving three stunned women in his wake.

Isabella sat motionless, her manicured nails digging into the armrests. So he still carried a torch for that secretary! Her eyes burned with venomous rage.

"You'll regret this, Evelyn Carter," she vowed silently.

Eleanor and Vanessa rushed to console her. "Divorce affects everyone, darling. Even Nathan needs time to adjust," Eleanor soothed.

Vanessa nodded. "You're the only one for him. He's just... processing that disastrous first marriage."

"Give him a few days. He'll return with roses and a ring," Vanessa predicted confidently, though neither woman truly believed it.

The next morning found Evelyn reviewing contracts when Olivia Sinclair burst into her office.

"Sweetheart! That bastard Nathan is testing my last nerve!"

Evelyn blinked. "What now?"

Olivia thrust her phone forward. Evelyn's lips curled in cold amusement as she scanned the screen. "How creative."

Bold headlines screamed: "Secretary-Turned-Golddigger Exposed: Cinderella's Glass Slipper Shatters!"

The article spun a sordid tale - a powerful CEO's three-year secret marriage ending when his secretary wife betrayed him with a wealthy Middle Eastern businessman during a work trip. It accused her of corporate espionage and demanding an outrageous divorce settlement.

A strategically angled photo made an innocent business handshake appear intimate.

The comments section overflowed with vitriol:
"Disgusting! How dare she ask for his money after cheating?"
"Rumor says it's Nathan Sterling of Sterling Enterprises and his secretary Evelyn Carter!"
"That scheming bitch got what she deserved! Burn her!"
Olivia trembled with rage. "That backstabbing snake! Smearing you right after the divorce!"

Evelyn scrolled calmly, her expression unreadable. "Photos as evidence and simplistic narrative. Decent tabloid work."

Olivia's anger dissolved into startled laughter. "Only you could find humor in this."

Just then, Evelyn's phone buzzed. Natalie Reeves' name flashed onscreen. "Ladies, just traced the article's source. Isabella Delaney paid for the hit piece. What's your history with her?"

Evelyn's smile turned arctic. "I suspected as much."

"Want me to bury it?" As editor-in-chief of GEM Magazine, Natalie wielded considerable media influence.

Evelyn's eyes glittered dangerously. "No. Taking it down quietly would be boring. We counterattack in broad daylight."
###Chapter 33 The Gilded Showdown

"I admire your choice," Natalie responded without hesitation.

"Reach out anytime. I've got your back."

"Appreciate it." Evelyn had barely ended the call when Olivia nudged her shoulder.

"What's the plan? That witch makes my blood boil!"

"Nathan's escorting me to the Sterling Enterprises gala tomorrow. Every elite in the city will be there. That's where—"

Olivia pumped her fist. "Go get 'em, queen! Wipe that smirk off her face!"

The following evening, the grand ballroom glittered with sequined gowns and diamond cufflinks under crystal chandeliers. The air buzzed with champagne laughter and whispered intrigues.

Evelyn made her entrance in a custom-made, sapphire-encrusted mermaid gown that hugged her curves like liquid moonlight. The plunging backline revealed delicate shoulder blades that moved like wings when she walked.

All conversation ceased as heads turned. Her smoky eye makeup accentuated piercing emerald eyes that held glacial detachment. The blood-red lipstick matched her stiletto nails that tapped rhythmically against her champagne flute.

Society girls who devoured gossip columns immediately clustered together when they recognized Evelyn.

When Vanessa appeared clutching a martini glass, they swarmed her with barely concealed schadenfreude.

"Vanessa darling, is it true? That stunning woman by the orchestra is actually your former sister-in-law?"

"Goodness, the resemblance in those tabloid photos! Though she's far more striking in person."

"My brother's castoff? Please." Vanessa's nose wrinkled in distaste. "Nathan dumped that gold-digger years ago."

Across the room, Evelyn's lips curled as she spotted Vanessa. She moved through the crowd like a panther stalking prey, the slit in her gown revealing toned legs with each deliberate step.

"Back when we took pity on her, she was just some boutique clerk who seduced my brother while he was with Isabella."

The socialites leaned closer, champagne forgotten.

"She weaseled her way into our family, playing housemaid by day while—"

"—spreading her legs for business partners at night," Vanessa finished with a vicious smirk. "A glorified servant with benefits."

As she signaled for another drink, she missed Evelyn's approach. "The minute she sniffed money in Darai, she demanded a divorce. Typical whore—"

The circle abruptly stiffened, their frightened gazes darting behind Vanessa.

Evelyn's glacial voice cut through the silence. "Don't stop on my account. I was enjoying the creative writing exercise."

Vanessa whirled around, her glass shattering on the marble floor.

"You deny it?" Vanessa jutted her chin. "Nathan's marrying Isabella now. An actual lady, unlike some back-alley—"

"Isabella's three months pregnant," Evelyn countered smoothly. "Funny math, considering our divorce was finalized... last Tuesday."

Eleanor suddenly materialized, yanking Vanessa behind her. "You barren shrew!" she shrieked, finger jabbing at Evelyn. "At least Isabella can give my son heirs! What were you good for besides—"

"Enough!" Nathan's command sliced through his mother's tirade.

Eleanor blanched at the surrounding stares and pursed her lips.

Nathan had witnessed the entire exchange. What unsettled him wasn't Evelyn's composure under fire—it was the disturbing plausibility of his family's accusations.

Gripping his whiskey tumbler, he stepped forward. "Tell me truthfully. Did my family really treat you as... domestic help for three years?"

Evelyn's mocking laughter tinkled like broken crystal as her gaze flickered between Nathan and the visibly pregnant Isabella. "Why ask the villainess when your precious saints stand right here?"
###Chapter 34 The Weight of Past Wounds

Nathan couldn't form a response.

His entire life, he'd blindly taken Vanessa and Eleanor's side, never once truly hearing what Evelyn had to say.

Had that been the final straw that drove her to divorce him?

A wave of remorse crashed over him at the realization.

"Apologize," he commanded Vanessa with a thunderous glare. She lowered her gaze but kept her lips sealed.

Dominic moved protectively beside Evelyn, his expression dark with barely contained fury.

"Do you think a simple sorry can erase three years of humiliation and the slander you spread after the divorce?"

After witnessing how the Sterlings had tormented Evelyn, the mere sight of them turned his stomach.

When his gaze landed on Isabella, he added, "I've already identified who leaked those fabricated stories about my company executive."

Isabella's fingers twisted nervously in her dress under Dominic's icy stare.

It wasn't possible. They couldn't know it was her.

She'd sent those photos anonymously. There was no trail leading back to her.

"That article contained nothing but malicious lies designed to tarnish an executive of Kingsley Industries' reputation."

"The police will be arriving shortly. You'll need to cooperate fully with their investigation, Ms. Delaney," Dominic stated.

Isabella's face drained of color, her heart hammering against her ribs.

She stumbled backward, shaking her head frantically at Nathan's questioning look.

Tears welled up on cue as she pleaded, "You have to believe me, Nathan! I would never do something so vile!"

Nathan pulled Isabella behind him, his voice flat. "Surely there's been some mistake, Mr. Kingsley?"

"What mistake?" Eleanor exploded. "These two are clearly trying to frame my daughter-in-law!"

"She's carrying your child! You're going to scare her into losing the baby! Who'll take responsibility then?"

Evelyn's laugh was sharp as broken glass. "If you're so concerned, you're welcome to join her at the police station."

Vanessa's temper flared at Evelyn's words. "What's that supposed to mean?"

"Have you forgotten your own crimes? We haven't even discussed you trashing my boutique yet!"

"H-how did you—" Vanessa's voice cracked with disbelief.

Still smarting from her boutique humiliation, she'd hired thugs to vandalize the place.

After days passed without consequence, she'd assumed she'd gotten away with it.

"I tracked down your hired goons. They've already confessed everything to the police," Evelyn said coolly. It had been almost too easy.

Her gaze swept over them like a blade. "Property destruction, defamation through false rumors... I'm holding you all accountable."

Vanessa's knees threatened to buckle. What now? As the mastermind, she'd be the first one arrested.

Her only hope was clutching Nathan's sleeve, sobbing, "Help me, Nathan! I can't go to jail!"

Isabella chose that moment to collapse dramatically in his arms, still protesting, "I'm innocent, Nathan! I swear!"

Nathan seethed internally. He wanted to shake Vanessa for her stupidity. But she was family.

Taking a steadying breath, he forced calm into his voice. "Ms. Kingsley, I acknowledge Vanessa's wrongdoing. Can't we settle this privately?"
###Chapter 35: Consequences and Confrontation

"Nathan, why are you even entertaining this conversation with that cursed woman?"

Eleanor Blackwell gripped Nathan Sterling's arm tightly, her nails digging into his suit sleeve. She had never seen him lower himself to negotiate with Evelyn Carter—let alone with such deference.

Since when did Evelyn, who had always been obedient, dare to challenge them?

Eleanor stormed toward Evelyn, her chin lifted in disdain. "So what if we ruined your pathetic little shop? What reputation do you even have to protect?"

Her voice dripped with venom. "You never fought back before when we put you in your place!"

But the moment she saw Nathan's expression darken, she realized her blunder.

She had just exposed how horribly they had treated Evelyn for years.

Dominic Kingsley, standing beside Evelyn, scoffed in disgust.

"These are the people you've been serving all this time?" His voice was laced with disbelief. "This is the family you called your own?"

Then, remembering his sister's suffering, he clenched his jaw. "It's your choice to deal with them, but if you embarrass our family by being weak now, I won’t forgive you."

Evelyn gave him a small, reassuring smile before turning back to Eleanor, her gaze icy.

"Let me guess," she said coolly. "You're about to tell me that your precious daughter just needs to compensate me, right?"

Eleanor didn’t even bother denying it.

"Am I wrong?" she sneered. "How much could that dump possibly be worth? We can afford whatever petty sum you're demanding."

Evelyn tilted her head, a dangerous glint in her eyes. "Three hundred million dollars."

Eleanor nearly choked.

"What?" she shrieked. "That’s impossible! Who do you think you’re scamming?"

Evelyn didn’t flinch. "If you don’t believe me, I have the financial records to prove it. But don’t worry—you’ll believe me soon enough."

"You wretched girl!" Eleanor’s face twisted in fury. "I’ll tear you apart before I let you humiliate us!"

She lunged forward, but Nathan caught her wrist, his grip unyielding.

"Enough," he snapped, his voice low and dangerous.

The argument had drawn the attention of half the gala’s attendees, and whispers spread like wildfire.

"That’s the Blackwell family? Disgusting."

"Did you hear how they treated her? No wonder she left."

"Honestly, if I were Evelyn, I would’ve cheated on him too."

Nathan flinched at the words.

Had he really been so blind?

While Vanessa sobbed theatrically and Isabella played the victim, Nathan exhaled sharply.

"Evelyn," he said, forcing calm into his voice. "I’ll pay the three hundred million. Can we end this here?"

Evelyn smiled, but there was no warmth in it.

"Oh, they’ll pay," she said. "And they’ll go to jail."

Nathan stiffened. "That’s excessive."

"Is it?" Evelyn arched a brow. "Destroying a business worth three hundred million is a felony. If your family failed to teach her consequences, the justice system will."

Then her gaze locked onto Isabella, sharp as a blade.

"And you."

Isabella paled.

"You know exactly what you did," Evelyn murmured. "By the time the police finish with you, I’ll have all the evidence I need."
###Chapter 36 For Victor Langley

The moment the police arrived, they swiftly identified their targets and moved in without hesitation.

"Vanessa Sterling, Isabella Delaney, you need to come with us," an officer announced firmly.

Eleanor Blackwell rushed forward in protest, desperate to stop them from taking her daughter and the pregnant mistress away.

But in her haste, she caught her heel on the hem of her designer gown. She stumbled violently, her head striking the marble floor with a sickening thud before she lost consciousness.

As officers escorted Vanessa and Isabella out, Nathan Sterling carried his unconscious mother away, bringing the disastrous evening to a humiliating close.

With the unwanted guests finally removed, Dominic Kingsley guided Evelyn Carter to the center of the grand ballroom.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he announced, his voice commanding attention. "Ms. Evelyn Carter is no longer the secretary to the president of Sterling Enterprises."

A hush fell over the crowd as he continued. "She is now the general manager of Kingsley Industries' Pamore branch. I look forward to seeing fruitful collaborations between all of you in the future."

Murmurs erupted instantly.

"Did you hear that? She climbed the corporate ladder that fast?"

"They share the same last name, but I doubt they're related. Why would a Kingsley woman endure such humiliation in Pamore otherwise?"

"Honestly, after what the Sterlings put her through, she had every right to walk away—cheating or not."

With Dominic's public endorsement and the Sterlings' spectacular self-destruction, the scandalous article lost all credibility.

Evelyn found herself surrounded by eager business connections, including one particularly intriguing figure—Victor Langley, the enigmatic CEO of Langley Group.

He approached with a glass of red wine, his sharp gaze assessing her. "Ms. Carter," he greeted smoothly. "Your reputation is… fascinating."

She met his piercing stare without flinching, raising her champagne flute in response. "Mr. Langley. A pleasure."

Kingsley Industries' medical expansion required strong alliances, and Langley Group topped her list.

"Congratulations on your newfound freedom," Victor murmured, his voice like velvet over steel. "And your impressive career leap."

His knowing smirk suggested he saw right through her ambitions.

Unfazed, Evelyn drained her glass. "Thank you. Expect a meeting request soon—I hope this introduction leaves a lasting impression."

Victor's lips curved as he mirrored her gesture, finishing his wine. "Oh, I'll remember."

Later that night, Evelyn returned to the Kingsley estate.

A sealed envelope from Natalie Reeves waited on her desk, marked URGENT—READ IMMEDIATELY.

Inside was a scathing exposé, meticulously detailing the Sterlings' crimes while shielding Evelyn's privacy. The writing was razor-sharp—each accusation deliberate.

First: Nathan Sterling, the serial cheater.
Second: Isabella Delaney, the homewrecking mistress.
Finally: Vanessa Sterling, the mob-connected socialite.

If Eleanor read this, she'd faint from rage—only to wake up and faint again.

Evelyn dialed Natalie at once.

"Hello?" came the editor-in-chief's crisp voice.

"Brilliant work," Evelyn said, impressed. "GEM Magazine's reputation is well-earned."

A pause. Then, softly: "Thank you."

Before she could reply, Olivia Sinclair's voice crackled through the speaker: "Stop gushing and get over here! Halo Bar, now."

Evelyn laughed. It was time to celebrate. "On my way."

"So I publish?" Natalie verified.

Olivia cut in: "Damn right! Let the internet roast those Sterlings alive!"

Evelyn grinned. "Couldn't have said it better myself."
###Chapter 37 Shadows of the Past Revealed

The Sterling mansion was shrouded in heavy silence.

Nathan sat rigidly on the leather sofa, his stormy expression unreadable. He hadn't spoken since returning from the police station after bailing Vanessa out.

Though he'd compensated for the boutique damages, Evelyn remained adamant about pressing charges. The destruction had been too extensive.

Vanessa faced at least three years in prison according to Nathan's legal team.

Eleanor had just woken from her medication-induced sleep. The news about her daughter's impending imprisonment sent her into hysterics.

"Nathan, listen to me!" Eleanor's voice trembled as she clutched his arm. "Your sister cannot go to prison! She's too delicate for that environment!"

Her manicured nails dug into his suit sleeve. "Go talk to Evelyn again. Flatter her if you must. Do whatever it takes to make her drop the charges!"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "She conspired with criminals to destroy private property. There are consequences for such actions."

Eleanor's face contorted. "She only acted out because that woman provoked her! This is all Evelyn's fault!"

When Nathan remained unmoved, Eleanor's desperation escalated dramatically.

She flung open the nearest window, hiking one leg over the sill. "If you won't help Vanessa, I'll jump right now! I swear I will!"

Isabella gasped, rushing to pull Eleanor back. "Nathan! Do something!"

"Enough!" Nathan's roar echoed through the grand hall, freezing both women in place.

Neither had ever seen him so furious. Eleanor quickly withdrew her leg, collapsing onto the chaise lounge while Isabella retreated to the corner.

Nathan had been simmering with rage since the disastrous gala. Now the dam had broken.
###Chapter 38 She'll Serve Three Years in Prison

"I've uncovered everything! Vanessa was the one who humiliated Evelyn in her boutique and kept showing off until she got exposed and thrown out for buying counterfeit goods," Nathan declared.

He slammed a recording device onto the desk. "These are testimonies from every staff member who's worked here in the past three years."

"Every single one confirmed you treated Evelyn like a servant. You screamed at her, forced her to cook for us, even demanded she wash our underwear!" His voice shook with barely contained rage.

Eleanor pouted like a chastened child when confronted with the evidence.

"She offered to do those things! That gold-digger should've expected such treatment when she shamelessly married into our family," she muttered petulantly.

"Is that really how you all saw her?" Nathan's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper.

He'd never imagined his seemingly perfect family could harbor such cruelty.

For three years, Evelyn had shouldered double duties - working grueling hours as his executive assistant by day, only to return home to Eleanor and Vanessa's torment.

Yet she'd never complained. And he'd never bothered to notice. What kind of husband had he been?

"Not content with abusing her at home, you destroyed her belongings at her own store! With Vanessa's entitled attitude, she was bound to land herself in trouble eventually."

"She'll serve three years in prison. Maybe that will teach her some humility," Nathan pronounced coldly.

Eleanor opened her mouth to protest, but one glacial look from her son sent her collapsing back onto the sofa, teeth clenched in frustration.

Nathan tore off his tie with a sharp jerk, then turned his piercing gaze to Isabella.

She'd remained silent throughout, but the condemnation in his eyes made her breath hitch painfully.

"You knew exactly who Evelyn Carter was. Why pretend ignorance? And why send someone to stalk her and stage those misleading photos?"

Isabella's lips parted soundlessly. She hadn't anticipated he'd uncover that particular betrayal.

###Chapter 39 Must Be Nice

There she was. The intriguing woman he'd encountered on the rooftop.

Adrian froze, his gaze locked on the stage. Evelyn's soulful voice filled the entire lounge as she performed a bluesy rendition of "Young and Reckless."

Perched on the stool under the spotlight, her crimson lips parted to release notes that transported the audience through waves of nostalgia. The way her body swayed with the music made her glow even more radiant.

As the melody washed over him, Adrian vividly recalled finding Evelyn in tears that night on the roof. Those glistening eyes had added such poignant depth to her beauty - the kind of heartbreaking loveliness that could shatter a thousand hearts.

He didn't realize how intensely he was staring until his thoughts began drifting dangerously far away.

Meanwhile, Olivia shouted from the front row. "Too depressing, darling! You're making me weep! Give us something happier!"

Evelyn flashed her best friend a mischievous wink. "Your wish is my command." With a dramatic flip of her hair, she launched into an upbeat rendition of "House Party Anthem."

Her entire demeanor transformed as she sang, feet tapping to the rhythm, smile bright enough to outshine the stage lights. The playful energy matched the cheeky lyrics perfectly.

The infectious melody had the entire crowd dancing along, creating an electric atmosphere that pulsed through the venue. For Adrian, it suddenly transported him back to the streets of Montclair - he could almost feel Evelyn's hand in his as they strolled together.

He was utterly, hopelessly enchanted.

Never had he encountered a woman so beautifully unpredictable, so vibrantly alive that it shook him to his core. An insistent voice in his head kept repeating: "This is it, Adrian! She's the one!"

"That's your goddess of serendipity! The woman who outshone every star in the sky! Imagine how incredible life would be with her by your side!"

When the final note faded, the audience erupted in thunderous applause. Olivia whooped, "You slayed that, babe!" Even typically reserved Natalie was clapping enthusiastically with a rare smile.

Adrian quickly schooled his lovestruck expression and checked his appearance before moving to approach her. But just as he took his first step, the door burst open and a drunken Nathan Sterling stumbled into him, reeking of alcohol.
###Chapter 40 Shut Your Trap

The scent of whiskey clung to him like a second skin.

Nathan Sterling was completely wasted, yet he managed to raise a trembling finger toward the stage. "Gorgeous, isn't she? That's my ex-wife." His head then slumped forward as if sleep had claimed him.

"You're full of shit, Nate. Why would you cheat on someone who looks like that?" Adrian Prescott nudged Nathan's shoulder, checking if he'd truly passed out.

"If she were mine, I'd be grinning in my dreams," Adrian mused, convinced Nathan was just spouting drunken nonsense.

"She's my goddess now, so shut your trap, alright?" Adrian demanded.

But Nathan was already unconscious, deaf to his words.

Adrian's gaze returned to Evelyn Carter.

With a drunkard draped over him, he wouldn't make much of an impression approaching her now.

After a moment's hesitation, he changed course, hauling Nathan back to their VIP booth instead.

Dumping Nathan with Gregory Hammond and the others, Adrian rushed back to catch another glimpse of Evelyn. But the stage now held a different performer. She'd vanished.

His longing burned hotter. Snapping his fingers, he summoned his assistant. "Find out where Evelyn Carter is staying in Kingsley Heights."

The next morning, Evelyn's assistant entered with news. "Ms. Carter, someone's waiting downstairs to collect the 999 roses they sent you."

Evelyn glanced up, perplexed. She had no clue who could have sent them.

###Chapter 41 The Hotel Key

The stench of cigar smoke assaulted Evelyn's senses, making her recoil instinctively. She shifted seats to put distance between herself and Trevor Maddox.

When she looked up, the yellow stains on Trevor's teeth made her stomach churn.

Middle-aged men might appear decent from afar, but up close? Disgusting.

"What's this about? You're keeping me prisoner now?" She held her breath, refusing to share the same air with this creep.

"First you divorce Mr. Sterling, then immediately cozy up to Kingsley Industries' president? Making waves the moment you return to Kingsley Heights? Impressive, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "Did you drag me here just to compliment me?"

"Hardly. I'm curious what it's like to bed someone Nathan Sterling has had." Trevor's leer was unmistakable as his eyes raked over her.

Days ago, she'd humiliated him publicly. He'd assumed that was the end of it. Then she'd proceeded to eviscerate every department with pinpoint critiques.

Her rise threatened him.

Evelyn scoffed. "I had no idea you missed me so desperately."

"How far can women really go on merit? Without bedroom skills, you'd never have climbed so high." His misogyny hung thick in the air.

Evelyn wondered if Kingsley Industries' HR department needed vision tests. How else could trash like this get hired?

"Besides, I want the juicy details about your marriage to Sterling. Especially what you were like between the sheets. Sound good?"

"That desperate to hear it?" Evelyn's smirk widened as she scanned their surroundings. "Too public here. Not exactly appropriate."

"Don't fret, Ms. Carter. I've prepared for that." Trevor's grin turned predatory as he produced a keycard for the luxury hotel across the street. "Been looking forward to this."

"You claim I'm in Mr. Kingsley's favor. Aren't you worried I'll tell him about this?" Evelyn's mocking gaze dissected Trevor, searching for cracks.

Sure enough, his expression faltered momentarily before he recovered with a laugh. "You're just a secretary who happened to marry Sterling. Why would our president care? You're disposable. Once he's bored, why shouldn't his employees have a turn?"

The man had audacity, she'd give him that.

"Brilliant analysis, Mr. Maddox." Evelyn sipped her wine, smile intact.

"Your position's still unstable since you just started. Get inside Barnes Medical's development project, and Mr. Kingsley will take you seriously."

"Are you finally sharing that insider info about Langley Group?" Evelyn feigned nervousness to play along.

"Depends how eager you are." By now, Trevor had mentally stripped her multiple times. "After I'm done with you, you'll get what's coming, you bitch," he thought.

Nearby, Gregory Hammond found their interaction suspicious. He elbowed Nathan. "Check it out. Your ex is getting cozy with her coworker. Looks like she's seducing him."

"Everything looks like seduction to your dirty mind. Shut it," Nathan warned.

Gregory pouted but stuffed his mouth with food, falling silent. They'd planned a simple dinner, not expecting to encounter Evelyn and Trevor.

When Nathan saw them, his gaze turned arctic. But when they headed for the hotel, that cold fury ignited into white-hot rage.

She'd actually gotten a hotel room? How could she move on so shamelessly after their divorce?
###Chapter 42 What Do You Want From Him

Nathan's fury propelled him out of his seat, his footsteps echoing through the restaurant as he pursued the departing couple.

Gregory matched his pace. "See? I told you! No man takes a woman to a place this expensive without booking a hotel suite afterward."

He clapped Nathan on the back. "Let it go, man. You already know what kind of woman she is."

Nathan shoved Gregory's hand away, his jaw clenched as he stormed toward the hotel entrance. The divorce papers were barely dry, and already Evelyn was entangled with Dominic Kingsley from Kingsley Industries while cozying up to her coworker.

Had she always been this way, or had the divorce unleashed something in her?

The elevator doors slid open. Trevor stepped inside first. Just as Evelyn moved to follow, an iron grip closed around her wrist.

"We need to talk." The voice was dangerously low.

Evelyn's scoff was ice-cold when she recognized Nathan. "Don't you have companies to run, Mr. Sterling? Some of us have actual work to do."

Nathan had appeared at the worst possible moment—just as she was about to enter a hotel suite with Trevor. For half a heartbeat, she wondered if it was intentional.

No. That was ridiculous.

"You two chat." Trevor's smirk was infuriating as he pressed the elevator button. "I'll be waiting upstairs, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn's glare could have melted steel as the doors closed. If that bastard thought he could manipulate her, he had another thing coming.

Nathan's grip tightened until her bones protested. She wrenched free. "Spit it out or leave."

"What could you possibly want from scum like him?" Nathan's eyes were thunderclouds.

Trevor's reputation in Pamore was legendary—and not in a good way.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Since when do you care?" Her mocking smile hit its mark. "The divorce was finalized months ago. I'll sleep with whoever I please."

Something flickered in Nathan's expression—regret? Anger? It vanished as quickly as it appeared.

"You think becoming Dominic Kingsley's lover bought you that promotion?" Nathan's laugh was bitter. "But Trevor? What's your angle there? I could give you ten times whatever he's offering—"

The slap echoed through the lobby. Evelyn's palm stung, but the pain in her chest was worse. Three years of pouring her soul into Sterling Enterprises, and this was how he saw her?

Nathan touched his split lip, tasting copper. He didn't retaliate.

Evelyn squared her shoulders, the mask of indifference sliding back into place. "My reasons are none of your concern." She stepped into the elevator, jabbing the close-door button.

As the elevator ascended, she imagined grinding Nathan's pride beneath her heels.

Trevor's door swung open before she finished knocking. "Took you long enough," he purred, eyes roaming her body.
###Chapter 43 Still Got It

The door clicked shut behind Evelyn. Trevor wasted no time tearing off his clothes.

"Relax, Ms. Carter. By morning, I'll spill every secret about Langley Industries. You'll be unstoppable at Kingsley Corp," he sneered.

Drool practically dripped from his chin as his eyes flickered toward the hidden camera nestled in the headboard.

Why settle for one night when he could relive it forever?

He'd have his way with every woman those high-profile men had touched. If things went south, he'd have enough blackmail material to ruin Evelyn.

Bare and breathless, he lunged.

Glass shattered.

Pain exploded across his skull. Blood trickled down his temple as he staggered back.

"You psycho!" he roared, clutching his head. "I'll kill you!"

His fist flew—only for Evelyn to catch his wrist midair.

A sharp twist. A sickening pop.

His arm hung limp.

Before he could scream, her stiletto slammed into his ribs. The crack echoed.

Fear drowned his lust. He scrambled backward, but her fingers tangled in his hair, yanking him close.

"P-please," he choked. "I was wrong—"

"Changed your mind?" Her voice dripped ice. "Thought you wanted to see how I perform."

The rib fragment stabbing his lung answered for him. "N-no! I surrender!"

Her palm patted his cheek. "Still think I'm helpless?"

Three years without practice, yet her heels had done the job. Satisfaction curled her lips.

Trembling, Trevor shook his head.

"Bed. Now."

"You're joking! I can't even—"

Her fist silenced him. "Filthy mind. Lie down."

He crawled onto the mattress, whimpering.

Evelyn's phone flashed. Click. Click. Click.

"Stop! My reputation—" He shielded his face, but the damage was done.

She plucked the camera from the vase, lip curled.

"Watching trash get wrecked? My new favorite hobby."

Leaning in, her whisper turned lethal. "If I find you've filmed anyone else... hell will feel cozy."

Trevor's throat closed. The tapes hidden in his penthouse flashed behind his eyes. He nodded wildly.

Disgust clung to her skin. She scrubbed her hands under the faucet, wine swirling down the drain.

A waiter passed. "Call an ambulance. Room 1203. Man down."

The kid bolted inside. Trevor had already blacked out.

"Front desk!" The walkie-talkie crackled. "Medical emergency!"

Staff swarmed within minutes. Evelyn's crossed arms and glacial stare killed any questions.

"Ma'am, are you—"

She waved them off and strode out.

The hallway stretched empty—until Nathan Sterling stepped into view.

Their eyes locked. An ocean of unspoken words between them.
###Chapter 44 Enough Already

Nathan couldn't pretend he hadn't witnessed everything. He had to get Evelyn out of that situation immediately, regardless of her protests.

But when he reached the room, he'd learned Trevor had gotten hurt.

Only when he saw Evelyn's composed expression did he realize how terribly he'd misjudged her.

An unfamiliar ache tightened in his chest. It was unbearable.

Evelyn's scornful gaze lashed at him like a whip. He couldn't muster the courage to approach, much less continue his charade of interrogation.

Trust? What trust? He couldn't recall ever truly giving that to Evelyn, not even during their marriage.

After leaving the hotel, Evelyn saw paramedics rushing inside with a stretcher.

She summoned her driver, then noticed Nathan standing nearby in his tailored suit.

"I'll take you," he offered calmly, as if she might actually consider it.

The suggestion surprised her, but her glare remained icy.

"No thanks. I wouldn't want to dirty your precious car."

"I know I was wrong," Nathan admitted, a trace of regret in his voice. "Let me apologize for what Isabella and Vanessa did to you."

Evelyn stepped back, every fiber of her being rejecting him. Yet her expression stayed perfectly composed. "Unnecessary."

"Why didn't you tell me how exhausted you were all those years?" Nathan had only discovered the truth after she left. Even now, asking these questions, he could see Evelyn's patience had evaporated long ago.

"Are we done here, Mr. Sterling? It's been ages. Why dwell on ancient history? Don't you have more important things to do?"

Belated apologies were worthless.

When her chauffeur arrived in the sleek town car, she walked away without a backward glance, leaving Nathan rooted to the spot.

At home, Evelyn showered and collapsed into bed. Her phone buzzed incessantly with messages from her friends.

When she shared what she'd done to Cameron, the responses flooded in.

"Queen behavior! That black belt finally paid off. White briefs? I'm blind now," Olivia texted.

"Should I delete the video?"

"Absolutely not! I'm showing it to my puppy as a chew toy deterrent."

"Perfect framing. Next time, let me handle cinematography," Natalie replied.

"Still got those killer instincts," Sophia chimed in.

The group chat exploded. No one expected Evelyn's message to lure Sophia Whitmore out of her usual silent lurking.

Founder of VERE Jewelry, Sophia's pieces routinely sold at international auctions as masterpieces. Even Pamore's elite considered her creations status symbols.

"The queen has spoken! Praise be!" Olivia declared.

"Overseas exhibition wrapping up. Back in Pamore soon. Drinks?" Sophia responded.

"Julian's in town. Have you two talked?" Evelyn asked.

The moment Julian's name appeared, Sophia went radio silent.

"Call me if you need backup," Natalie offered.

Evelyn stifled a laugh as she set her phone down.

Their friendship ran deep - petty drama never caused real tension.

But Sophia's reaction proved she still hadn't moved on from Julian. The trio had grown up together, with Sophia secretly pining for him.

Too shy to confess, she'd lost her chance forever.

Now that Julian was famous, women flocked to him constantly. Too proud to speak up, Sophia remained silent.

Evelyn wanted to shake some sense into her friend. They were from the same city, for heaven's sake. It was time to make a move.

Sophia definitely needed a stern talking-to when she returned to Pamore.

After chatting with Olivia, Evelyn fell asleep clutching her phone.

When she noticed her colleagues' admiring glances the next morning, she spotted the lobby roses - identical to yesterday's bouquet.

Neptune roses didn't grow in Pamore, but since Julian had money to burn, she let him indulge.

Evelyn simply instructed her assistant to distribute all incoming flowers to female staff.

Then, opening her office door, she found Trevor Maddox waiting with crutches.
###Chapter 45 Adrian Makes an Appearance

Evelyn leaned back in her chair with a mocking smile. "Discharged after just one night? You must be made of steel, Mr. Maddox."

"You flatter me, Ms. Carter. I simply couldn't bear the thought of my absence impacting Kingsley Industries' operations."

Trevor's head remained bandaged, the hospital gown peeking beneath his formal jacket. He shifted uncomfortably under her gaze.

"There's also the matter of Langley Group I forgot to mention. That's why I rushed back."

Evelyn gestured toward the sofa with a flick of her wrist. Some men only learned through pain.

When she'd asked politely, he'd remained tight-lipped. Now, after a thorough beating, he couldn't wait to spill his secrets.

"Langley just announced completion of their nanotech initiative. It aligns perfectly with Kingsley's biomedical expansion plans."

Evelyn's fingers stilled against her temple. "Either provide useful information or get out."

Trevor visibly paled. He'd learned the hard way that her threats weren't empty.

Switching tactics, he blurted, "Langley Group is negotiating with Sterling Enterprises! They're finalizing contract details—"

"Sterling Enterprises?" Evelyn's eyebrows shot up.

When Trevor moved closer to elaborate, a single warning glance sent him scrambling back to his original position.

"My sources say they're holding a private meeting at the Meadowbrook Racecourse to sign the agreement."

Evelyn twirled her pen thoughtfully. "How reliable is this intel?"

"One hundred percent. I'd stake my reputation on it."

She gave a noncommittal hum, filing away this unexpected development.

If someone like Trevor could access such confidential information, his contact must be high-ranking indeed.

He'd already crossed her once. He should know the next transgression would cost more than a few broken ribs.

"Ms. Carter," Trevor ventured cautiously, "if you secure the Langley partnership, I have a small request..."

Evelyn cut him off with a knowing smirk. "You want in on the project."

"Brilliant deduction! Exactly what I—"

"Denied." She didn't even glance up from her notes. "Get out."

After the door clicked shut, Evelyn considered her next move. This meeting demanded her personal attention.

Since Kingsley Industries kept clashing with Sterling Enterprises in Pamore, she might as well confront them directly and settle this rivalry once and for all.

Scrolling through her phone, she noted all articles about the Sterling family had vanished after the three-day ultimatum.

Even some news aggregator accounts had been suspended. The official Sterling Enterprises statement denied all allegations.

Evelyn's laughter held no warmth as her expression turned glacial.

Damage control. If they cared so much about their reputation, perhaps they shouldn't have committed those atrocities in the first place.

The investment director entered, placing a stack of files before her. "Ms. Carter, the new hire dossiers you requested."

As Kingsley Industries' most critical department, Evelyn scrutinized each candidate personally.

After years of stagnant recruitment, HR had worked overtime to secure top talent for their Pamore expansion.

Evelyn skimmed the impressive resumes with approval—until one name made her freeze.

Adrian Prescott.

Her finger jabbed the photograph. "Terminate this one immediately."

The director hesitated. "But Ms. Carter, Mr. Prescott's investment record is impeccable. He made his first million at sixteen on Wall Street. He's exactly—"

"I said fire him." The ice in her voice left no room for argument. Their enmity ran deeper than professional rivalry.

As the director turned to leave, Evelyn's voice stopped him. "Wait."
###Chapter 46 The Unexpected Applicant

Evelyn straightened her posture and pulled out her phone, dialing Dominic's number. He had just returned to Darai after his business trip.

This was bizarre. Why would Adrian Prescott abandon his prestigious position as president of Sterling Enterprises in Darai to apply for a job at her small branch office in Pamore?

Something smelled fishy. She needed Dominic's insight.

When he answered, his voice was warm yet authoritative. "Evelyn? What's the matter?"

She glanced at the director standing awkwardly beside her, then lowered her voice. "Dominic, Adrian is here in Pamore. He just applied to work at our branch. Did the Prescotts go under or something?"

Dominic chuckled. Evelyn had always despised Adrian, never missing a chance to mock him.

"No, Mr. Prescott Senior sent him back. But I had no idea he applied to your branch."

"Good. I'll have HR reject him immediately."

"Hold on, Evelyn," Dominic interjected smoothly.

"You know how brilliant Adrian is with investments. He's practically a prodigy."

"If he joins your team, your branch’s performance will skyrocket this year. The shareholders will be thrilled."

Evelyn hesitated, her tone softening into something almost playful. "But what if he brings up the engagement?"

"You've kept your identity hidden all this time. He has no idea you're his fiancée. Unless you tell him, how would he know?"

Sensing her hesitation, Dominic pressed further. "Your branch needs talent like his right now. Are you really going to let personal grudges get in the way of success?"

He had a point. Her priority was turning the Pamore branch around, and rejecting a genius over old resentment was unprofessional.

After a reluctant sigh, she ended the call and turned to the waiting director. Clearing her throat, she muttered, "Fine. Let him stay."

The director beamed, showering her with praise before scurrying off—just like Trevor had done the other day.

The next morning, Evelyn stepped into the company lobby only to hear excited whispers.

"He's gorgeous!"

"So he's the one sending all those flowers!"

Following their gazes, she spotted Adrian in a custom-tailored suit, holding an extravagant bouquet of roses. His flirtatious smile made her scoff.

So he was the mystery admirer. She should’ve known it wasn’t Nathan.

Her expression turned icy as she strode past him without acknowledgment. But he darted in front of her, undeterred.

"Long time no see. You remember me, don’t you?"

"No."

His grin widened. "I made you laugh on that balcony in Darai. You even used my handkerchief to dry your tears. Still nothing?"

Evelyn flicked her bangs aside, irritation rising. "Move. Now."

"I never thanked you for the gold bangle." He offered the bouquet again, but her glare only darkened.

She had hoped ignoring him would make him disappear. Instead, he clung like gum on her shoe. Infuriating.

Switching to boss mode, she gave him a scathing once-over. "You work here?"

Unaware of her simmering rage, Adrian answered cheerfully, "Yes! First day in the investment department. Hi, boss!"

Evelyn tapped her watch sharply, raising her voice. "What time is it? Get to work! Or do you want to be fired for harassing your CEO?"

Adrian froze. He’d never seen a woman command such authority.

Nearby, the investment director panicked. Spotting his new employee’s blunder, he snatched the roses, tossed them in the trash, and yanked Adrian toward the emergency stairs.

Finally satisfied, Evelyn stepped into the elevator—only to realize everyone else had fled to the stairs.

What was wrong with these people?

Meanwhile, the staff exchanged stunned glances. Evelyn usually arrived with a smile. None had ever seen her snap like that.

Why was she so furious over flowers?
###Chapter 47 The $180 Million Necklace

The evening air was crisp as Evelyn Carter and Olivia Sinclair stepped into the glittering boutique. The scent of expensive perfume lingered in the air, mingling with the soft hum of classical music.

A sales associate's eyes widened in recognition. "Ms. Carter!" She scurried off to fetch the manager.

The manager appeared moments later, hands clasped professionally. "One moment, Ms. Carter. The piece you selected is still in our vault—it requires special retrieval."

He gestured toward the displays. "Perhaps you'd like to browse our new arrivals while you wait?"

Evelyn shook her head. "We're fine here."

Olivia tugged at her sleeve, whispering excitedly. "The good stuff's upstairs, Evie!"

As they turned toward the staircase, the manager blocked their path with an apologetic grimace. "I'm afraid the second floor is currently reserved for a private viewing."

Evelyn gave him a polite smile. "We'll just wait for my purchase then."

The manager exhaled in relief. Wealthy clients with manners were becoming rare these days.

Upstairs, Eleanor Blackwell's perfectly sculpted brows furrowed at the familiar laughter drifting upward. Peering over the railing, her lips twisted at the sight of Evelyn.

The socialites surrounding her exchanged knowing glances.

"Mrs. Blackwell," one drawled, "isn't that your former daughter-in-law? The one making headlines?"

Another tittered behind her hand. "Has Vanessa finished her... extended vacation abroad?"

Eleanor's manicured nails dug into her clutch. "Those are baseless rumors. My daughter is studying in Paris."

The mocking laughter below grated on her nerves. With a sharp inhale, she stormed downstairs.

"Well, if it isn't the walking bad luck charm," Eleanor sneered.

Olivia jumped to her feet, fists clenched. "You—"

Evelyn caught her arm. "Don't waste your breath."

Turning to the manager, Evelyn said coolly, "Actually, I'll collect my order another day."

She had long since stopped caring about the Blackwell family drama.

The manager checked his watch anxiously. "Ms. Carter, your item is arriving momentarily. Just five more minutes?"

Evelyn relented. She needed that necklace for the upcoming gala.

Eleanor, frustrated by Evelyn's indifference, crossed her arms. "Can you even afford anything here? Perhaps I should buy you something—charity cases need proper clothing too."

Olivia looked ready to throw a punch. "Who do you think you are, you pretentious—"

Evelyn's lips curved. "How generous, Mrs. Blackwell. Anything I choose?"

"Within reason," Eleanor sniffed, gesturing to the staff. The humiliation she'd endured online and from her peers demanded retaliation.

Evelyn surveyed the store lazily. "I'm not interested in these."

Eleanor smirked. "Prices too steep for you?"

Just then, an armored van pulled up outside. Two guards entered carrying a silver case.

The manager donned white gloves, carefully unlocking the case. Nestled in blue velvet sat a diamond necklace that caught the light like captured stars.

Evelyn tilted her head. "Since you offered, I'll take this one." She turned to the manager. "The price?"

"$180 million, Ms. Carter."

Eleanor's designer bag hit the floor with a thud.

$180 million? That was more than her entire liquid assets!

The color drained from her face as realization struck—she'd just been outplayed at her own game.
###Chapter 48 The Obsidian Card

"How can a necklace cost this much? This is daylight robbery!"

Eleanor Blackwell's carefully cultivated poise shattered as her true penny-pinching nature surfaced.

Her screeching voice made the boutique staff visibly flinch.

The manager stepped forward with practiced patience. "Mrs. Blackwell, this is a VERE Jewelry exclusive collaboration piece."

"The canary diamonds were personally selected by Queen Isolde of Eldoria. Frankly, we're offering it at a steal—"

"You expect me to swallow that sales pitch?" Eleanor sneered, jabbing a manicured finger at the manager's chest.

"Rich people aren't ATMs you can just withdraw from!"

The manager's ears turned crimson. She'd handled difficult clients before, but never someone this crass.

Evelyn Carter's lips curled in icy amusement. "Why embarrass yourself harassing staff?"

"You promised I could have anything. Pay up already."

She gestured to the upper balcony where Palmere's elite ladies leaned over the railing, cocktails in hand.

"The entire social register heard your little performance. Wouldn't want to be known as a welcher, would you?"

Eleanor's stomach dropped as she caught the gleeful smirks above.

This humiliation was worse than the charity gala incident.

Under the chandelier's glow, the necklace transformed when Evelyn put it on. The rare diamonds blazed like captured sunlight, complementing her effortless grace.

Olivia Sinclair gushed dramatically. "Darling, this was made for you."

She shot Eleanor a withering look. "What's wrong? Not as loaded as you pretended?"

"Don't torment poor Mrs. Blackwell," Evelyn said lightly, producing a matte black card from her clutch. "Just run this."

Gasps erupted from the balcony.

"Is that—?"

"The Obsidian Card! Global unlimited spending!"

"Only five exist worldwide. That's real generational wealth!"

Eleanor's jaw went slack.

Her own platinum card with its paltry $50 million limit suddenly felt like monopoly money.

The manager processed the transaction with trembling hands, presenting the velvet box like a sacred relic.

"Ms. Carter, shall we arrange armored transport?"

Evelyn waved dismissively. "It's just costume jewelry."

The crowd collectively choked. $200 million—pocket change!

As they swept out, Olivia practically vibrated with excitement in the Lamborghini.

"Let's do this every week! Their faces were priceless!"

Evelyn chuckled. "Your wish is my command."

She checked her diamond-encrusted watch. "Any progress on those Belmont tickets?"

"Please," Olivia scoffed, producing VIP passes from her Birkin. "When have I ever let you down?"

"Go claim your pound of Sterling flesh." She winked. "Make Nathan regret crossing you."

Evelyn's eyes glinted like the diamonds at her throat. "Oh, he'll beg."

Two days later at the Sterling-Langley merger meeting...

Nathan Sterling barely registered Victor Langley's droning presentation.

His attention snagged on a thunderous silhouette cresting the hill.

A woman astride a Friesian stallion charged toward them at breakneck speed, hooves kicking up clods of earth.

The beast reared violently mere inches from Nathan's face—he didn't flinch.

Only one person rode with that particular reckless elegance.

Evelyn dismounted smoothly in skin-tatched riding gear, raven hair secured in a severe ponytail that accentuated her razor-sharp cheekbones.

She approached with the lethal grace of a panther, stopping just shy of Victor.

"Mr. Langley," she purred, ignoring Nathan completely. "Fancy meeting you here."

The diamond necklace glinted at her throat—a $200 million middle finger to the man who'd underestimated her.
###Chapter 49 Are You Scared Now

"Ms. Carter, your equestrian skills are truly impressive."

Victor Langley's compliment carried genuine admiration without a trace of mockery.

Evelyn Carter glanced briefly at Nathan Sterling standing nearby before turning back to Victor. "Mr. Langley, might we find a private place to talk?"

Langley Technologies specialized in cutting-edge technological development.

Founded just five years ago, the company had already pioneered numerous advanced bionic robots, earning accolades across multiple industries.

Their latest breakthrough in nanorobot technology promised revolutionary solutions to previously unsolvable medical challenges.

This was precisely why Evelyn had prioritized securing this partnership upon assuming her new position at Kingsley Industries.

Nathan's expression darkened, his voice laced with irritation. "Langley Technologies has already signed with Sterling Enterprises. What could possibly require privacy?"

His gaze remained locked on Evelyn. From the moment she'd galloped into view, she'd commanded his complete attention.

He'd never seen her ride before. In fact, she'd never even mentioned she could.

There were still so many things he didn't know about this woman.

The Sterling-Langley partnership remained confidential, yet she'd discovered it almost immediately and now sought involvement.

The corporate landscape of Pamore was about to become considerably more... interesting.

Evelyn's eyebrows lifted slightly - she hadn't anticipated such rapid progress between the two companies. They'd finalized their agreement in mere days.

Though frustrated by her late arrival, her flawless complexion betrayed nothing. "Would Kingsley Industries be able to join this project?"

Victor chuckled, his eyes revealing nothing. "Sterling Enterprises has already provided full funding. Introducing another investor at this stage would be... complicated."

Evelyn remained composed, as if she'd expected this response.

Her voice remained measured as she continued, "Additional investment would expand the project's scope while distributing risk. Surely that's beneficial?"

"Kingsley's medical R&D division could provide invaluable support for practical nanorobot applications."

"No serious innovator would pass up such advancement opportunities."

Her confident gaze locked with Victor's.

"Mr. Langley, I urge you to reconsider."

Victor appeared swayed but deferred the decision. "Ms. Carter negotiates as skillfully as she rides. Admirable. But this decision isn't mine alone - we must consult Mr. Sterling."

Evelyn suppressed a smirk. Victor was playing them perfectly. Business was business - he wouldn't refuse additional funding and reduced risk.

But given Evelyn and Nathan's very public divorce, this business reunion promised fireworks.

If Nathan outright refused cooperation, Victor's hands would be tied.

Why not let Evelyn make her case directly?

Nathan's eyes narrowed. "I disagree."

"On what grounds?" Evelyn tapped her riding crop against the chair before sitting gracefully.

"No need."

His curt response delivered, Nathan turned to leave. Evelyn's voice stopped him cold. "Are you frightened, Mr. Sterling?"

"Preposterous. Of what?"

Evelyn approached him, lips curving. "Afraid Sterling's profits might be divided? That I'll take my share?"

"This is clearly mutually beneficial - increased profits, reduced risk. All sacrificed to Mr. Sterling's cowardice..."

She turned to Victor. "Don't you agree, Mr. Langley?"

Victor maintained his diplomatic smile, wisely avoiding entanglement in the ex-couple's sparring.

"Say what you will, but Sterling Enterprises will never partner with Kingsley Industries," Nathan stated coldly, his expression stormy.

"Could it be Mr. Sterling still has feelings for me?" Evelyn dropped her bombshell with perfect timing.
###Chapter 50 The Equestrian Wager

Nathan reined in his horse abruptly, his piercing gaze locking onto Evelyn. The silence between them grew heavy as he remained motionless, his expression unreadable.

She was breathtakingly beautiful yet utterly unpredictable. Every time he thought he understood her, she'd prove him wrong.

Her questions always carried hidden traps. Approaching her felt like stepping toward a precipice - one wrong move and he'd fall into darkness.

Did he still have feelings for her? The uncertainty gnawed at him. One thing was certain - he regretted ending their marriage too hastily.

Evelyn lowered her lashes, a faint smile playing on her lips while frost glimmered in her eyes.

"Oh, forgive my careless words. A man like Mr. Sterling, with his heart of ice, wouldn't be swayed by such trivial past matters."

She continued smoothly, "Business comes first, doesn't it? As a shrewd entrepreneur, you understand that better than anyone."

"What are you really trying to say?" Nathan's voice dropped dangerously low, his stormy expression darkening.

Unfazed, Evelyn countered, "If our past isn't the reason you're blocking Kingsley Industries from the project, then there must be another explanation."

She tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear, her expression turning daring. "Shall we settle this with a race?"

"If you win, Kingsley withdraws permanently. If I win, Sterling Enterprises accepts our partnership."

Nathan had trained in equestrian sports since childhood, his skills rivaling professionals. Yet Evelyn radiated absolute confidence in her ability to defeat him today.

Victor Langley observed them with apparent neutrality, though his bias showed when he remarked, "Ms. Carter's proposal demonstrates remarkable sincerity. Her riding prowess speaks for itself."

"The only question remains - does Mr. Sterling have faith in his own abilities?"

Nathan's brow furrowed slightly as his obsidian eyes bored into Evelyn. "Why should I entertain this challenge?"

Evelyn shrugged nonchalantly. "Very well. When I leave, I'll inform all of Pamore how Nathan Sterling cowers before his ex-wife."

She'd pushed him to the edge. If Nathan ignored her provocation now, he wouldn't be the man she remembered.

"Deal," he bit out coldly.

Evelyn's crimson lips curved triumphantly. "Naturally."

The race would cover two thousand meters - three laps around the course. From the viewing platform, spectators could clearly see the riders approaching the starting line.

Evelyn had chosen the same chestnut Warmblood again. She adjusted her position, legs pressing firmly against the horse's flanks as they waited at the starting point.

Turning to Nathan, she flashed a brilliant smile beneath her helmet. "Prepared to lose, Mr. Sterling?"

Racing against her ex-husband for a business deal wasn't something she'd ever anticipated. The irony thrilled her more than the impending competition.

She would defeat Nathan, crushing his arrogance beneath her boots just as he'd trampled her heart during their three-year marriage.

Nathan caught Evelyn's radiant smile, committing the rare sight to memory. That dazzling expression - one he'd never witnessed during their marriage - made his breath catch.

The starting whistle shattered his thoughts. Evelyn's horse lunged forward half a stride ahead.

Nathan snapped to attention and gave chase immediately.

Spectators watched breathlessly as the stunning pair raced neck-and-neck around the track. Their professional-level competition held everyone spellbound.

Evelyn maintained a slight lead through the first lap, her horse galloping at full speed.

Nathan closed the gap on the curve, overtaking her by a hair's breadth in the second lap.

His chiseled profile, intense focus, and the way his muscles strained against his shirt as he gripped the reins elicited admiring gasps from female onlookers.

As they entered the final lap, the competitors were perfectly matched. Nathan held a razor-thin advantage, ratcheting up the tension among spectators.

The outcome hung in the balance.
###Chapter 51 You Lost

Evelyn wasn't worried about the outcome of the second round. Her focus remained entirely on the third curve.

At the decisive moment, she edged past Nathan by a hair's breadth, crossing the finish line first.

Their silent competition concluded with Evelyn's triumph.

The spectators had been holding their breath. As the race ended, cheers erupted for Evelyn's victory.

This was the thrill of horse racing - the final outcome always remained uncertain until the last possible second.

After completing a cooling-down lap, Evelyn reined in her mount before Nathan and dismounted gracefully.

Her vibrant smile lit up her face as she removed her helmet, releasing a cascade of raven-black hair over her shoulders.

Her breathtaking beauty commanded attention. Slightly breathless from exertion, she declared, "Mr. Sterling, you lost."

Evelyn had once claimed victory in the prestigious Queen's Cup, earning royal commendation.

Horseback riding had been her passion since childhood. Dominic had spared no expense, acquiring priceless steeds and hiring countless trainers for her.

At fifteen, her prized companion had been an Akhal-Teke worth millions - a breed renowned for its speed and endurance.

This sport demanded years of dedicated practice. There was no way she could lose to Nathan, whose training had been merely casual under ordinary instructors.

Previously, she'd suppressed her competitive spirit to maintain a demure facade, hoping to gain Nathan's affection.

How laughable that seemed now.

Nathan's breathing remained uneven. He studied Evelyn with an inscrutable expression before looking away.

"When did you learn to ride like that?"

Her initial appearance had surprised him, but her skill level astonished him even more.

Evelyn radiated untamed confidence - a rose with dangerous thorns. Every movement exuded lethal charm.

He had to admit - he might be developing feelings for her.

"Mr. Sterling, we're discussing Kingsley Industries joining this project," Evelyn reminded him coldly, maintaining professional distance.

Nathan swallowed his questions. "Bring the contract to my office tomorrow."

Evelyn lifted her chin proudly, her elegant eyes flashing with derision.

"Mr. Sterling, you amuse me. Why should others accommodate your schedule?"

"Understand this clearly - Kingsley Industries participates as an equal partner."

"No party is disadvantaged here. We're not Sterling Enterprises' subordinate."

She needed to constantly remind Nathan she was no longer his obedient secretary.

Handing the reins to a waiting groom, she turned away coolly.

"My assistant will handle the details. We'll talk when my presence is required."

Nathan's gaze followed her retreating figure until Victor appeared beside him.

"Be honest, did you go easy on her?" Victor's eyes twinkled with amusement. This collaboration was ideal for his nanorobot project.

A win-win situation for all parties - surely Nathan recognized that.

Nathan averted his gaze. "No. She's genuinely skilled."

Reluctant as he was to admit it, Evelyn had bested him fairly.

"Seems you'll be holding a grudge," Victor teased.

"No. She spoke truthfully. Business is business. No reason to reject profitable opportunities."

Nathan concealed his faint disappointment. "Let's proceed immediately." With that, he departed the course.

Changing from her riding gear, Evelyn exited the locker room just as Gregory and Nathan appeared.

Nathan listened impassively while Gregory chattered animatedly, arm slung over his shoulders.

"Seriously, how'd you lose to her? You're legendary in Pamore's riding circles! You threw the match, right?"

"No."

Nathan's impatience showed. He wanted nothing more than to leave immediately.

"Then she's full of surprises. First she initiates divorce out of nowhere."

"Now she's back in Pamore, constantly appearing before you. I wonder if her patron Dominic thinks you've rekindled something."

Nathan's icy glare could have frozen lava. "Curious? Ask her yourself."
###Chapter 52 Whatever Amount You Desire

Nathan Sterling's jaw tightened at his friend's sharp words. He assumed Gregory Hammond was just bitter about losing their earlier bet.

"I don't have time to deal with that kind of woman. Gold-diggers like her should be avoided at all costs."

"Is that so?" Evelyn Carter's icy voice sliced through the air directly behind Gregory, making him jump.

He whirled around, nearly stumbling. "Do you always sneak up on people like some kind of ghost?"

"Since I'm right here, why don't you say it to my face?"

Evelyn stood with arms crossed, her piercing gaze making Gregory shrink back. She'd clearly heard every word of his insulting remarks.

Nathan remained silent, though his eyes kept flickering toward Evelyn against his will. An unfamiliar tightness gripped his chest.

"Please, I'd never be interested in someone like you. Go find some other rich fool to leech off of," Gregory scoffed, waving his hand dismissively.

The click of designer heels echoed as Evelyn advanced, her commanding presence forcing Gregory backward.

"Has anyone ever mentioned you sound exactly like a fishwife when you gossip?"

Gregory's face turned crimson. "You! You keep clinging to my best friend after your divorce and ruined his business deal!"

"I've met dozens of scheming women like you. How dare you mock me? Ridiculous!"

Just then, a janitor pushed a cleaning cart past them.

Without hesitation, Evelyn grabbed a bucket of filthy mop water and flung its contents over Gregory's pristine white suit.

The expensive fabric turned transparent, clinging to his body in the most humiliating way possible. He scrambled to cover himself, looking more ridiculous by the second.

"Evelyn Carter! Have you lost your mind?" he shrieked.

"Is this what you expect from a gold-digger?" Evelyn pulled out a checkbook from her Chanel bag.

"Name your price. Consider it compensation for both your ruined outfit and wounded pride."

"Next time I hear you slander me, it won't be dirty water I throw at you." Her stilettos clicked decisively as she walked away.

Gregory stared at the blank check bearing only Evelyn's elegant signature.

Turning to Nathan, he spluttered, "Is she insane? How am I supposed to leave looking like this?"

Nathan's voice was glacial. "You brought this on yourself."

He shrugged off his jacket and threw it at Gregory's face before striding away.

"Hey! You can't just leave me like this!" Gregory yelled after them, struggling to wrap the jacket around his waist.

Back in her office, Evelyn reviewed the investment department's recent reports.

Since Adrian Prescott joined, their returns had increased dramatically. Keeping him at Kingsley Industries had clearly been the right decision.

Adrian had always possessed an uncanny instinct for venture capital. At fifteen, he'd already made waves on Wall Street before his father forced him into corporate management.

After finishing her review, Evelyn prepared to leave for the day.

The moment she stepped outside, a gleaming red Ferrari screeched to a halt before her.

Adrian emerged, this time holding an exquisite velvet box instead of his usual roses.

His trademark smirk played across his lips as he bowed dramatically. "My lady, fate brings us together again."
###Chapter 53 Grudges Are My Specialty

A misunderstanding?

Oh, this was far beyond a simple misunderstanding.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed dangerously as vivid memories of Adrian humiliating her flashed through her mind. This wasn't some petty mix-up—this was personal.

"Funny coincidence. That's just who I am."

She excelled in every way—except for one tiny flaw. She adored holding grudges.

Remembering Dominic's advice, Evelyn smirked. Keeping her true identity hidden while watching Adrian scramble around was far more satisfying than she'd anticipated.

"You should stay far away from me. Understood?"

Adrian wasn't listening. His focus was entirely on the velvet box in his hands.

Inside rested an emerald bracelet, its glow soft yet unmistakably luxurious. One glance confirmed its worth—hundreds of times more valuable than the one Isabella had stormed off with.

"I promised you a token of my appreciation. Do you like it?"

Adrian had spent weeks selecting this piece, consulting countless experts before making the purchase. His sincerity was undeniable.

"Take it back. I don't want it."

"Evelyn, I like you," he confessed again.

His confidence was dazzling, his charm undeniable. Any other woman might have melted under that gaze.

But Evelyn wasn't just any woman.

"I don't like you."

"Why not?"

"You're not my type."

Adrian looked genuinely wounded. Even his dream woman had standards? After a brief struggle, he steeled himself.

"Then tell me what your type is."

Evelyn glanced at her watch, ready to dismiss him.

"Don't use your work tone with me. It's after hours." His voice held a hint of wariness—clearly, her previous scolding still lingered.

She checked the time. 6:03 PM.

"You think cornering your boss after work makes it acceptable?"

Adrian swallowed hard. "I know you're not cruel. Is there... something I did to upset you?"

Evelyn's expression turned icy. "You're an idiot. I won't risk that affecting my future child's IQ."

Adrian nearly laughed. With an IQ of 167, this had to be a joke. "That's hard to believe."

"Is it?" She arched a brow. "I heard your department still hasn't secured that project with Morgan Bank. Isn't incompetence the reason?"

Recognition flashed in his eyes. The Morgan Bank deal had been a challenge—every strategy he'd tried had failed.

Now, her words lit a fire in him.

"Evelyn, I'll secure that project and prove my worth."

His voice brimmed with determination. "When I do, will you have dinner with me?"

Seeing her plan work, Evelyn shrugged. "Prove yourself first."

Adrian grinned. "Consider it done."

Her chauffeur arrived in a sleek Porsche, and she left without another word.

That night, Evelyn called Dominic, pride coloring her voice.

Dominic chuckled. "I've already arranged everything. Maxwell will deliver the gifts and assist you with the Sterling Enterprises project tomorrow."

"You're sending Maxwell?" Her breath caught.

Maxwell Donovan had been Dominic's right-hand man for a decade. His involvement signaled unwavering support.

"I know you can handle it," Dominic said softly. "But this will make me feel better."

"You're amazing." Warmth spread through her chest.

Since returning to Kingsley Industries, countless eyes had waited for her to fail. But Dominic's faith was her anchor.

"Get some rest," he murmured before hanging up.

She slept soundly.

The next morning, Evelyn yawned as she entered the living room.

Maxwell stood waiting, impeccably dressed. "Ms. Carter, I'll be assisting you today."

His tone was crisp, professional—exactly the kind of efficiency she admired.

"Good."

Her gaze drifted to the gift boxes on the table—Dominic's presents. She leaned against the sofa and opened the smallest one.

Inside lay a Chopard watch, its 201 carats of diamonds glittering. Conservative estimate? Three hundred million.

She slipped it on, admiring how it caught the light. Dominic's taste remained flawless.

Later, at the office, Maxwell delivered his morning report with precision. Evelyn reviewed each detail, ensuring nothing was amiss.

Then the door burst open—Trevor Maddox shoved past the secretary, his face stormy.
###Chapter 54 The Tables Have Turned

"Ms. Carter, I tried to stop him—" The assistant shifted uncomfortably in her heels.

Evelyn waved a manicured hand. "It's fine. Close the door."

Trevor Maddox's injuries had healed considerably, the last of his facial bandages removed just yesterday.

"Ms. Carter, I reviewed the Sterling Enterprises proposal." His voice dripped with false concern. "My name appears to be missing. An oversight, surely?"

Evelyn spun a platinum Montblanc between her fingers, her expression unreadable. "No oversight. I deliberately excluded you."

"We had an agreement."

The pleasant mask slipped from Trevor's face, revealing something far uglier. "You're making a dangerous enemy."

Her gaze sharpened like honed steel. "You'd do well to remember who signs your paychecks, Mr. Maddox. My decisions aren't up for debate."

Trevor abandoned all pretense of civility. "You're playing with fire, Ms. Carter."

"Am I?" A cold smile played on her lips. "What exactly do you intend to do about it?"

With deliberate slowness, Evelyn withdrew a thick manila envelope from her desk drawer. The contents spilled across the polished mahogany—grainy photographs of compromising positions, time-stamped over several months.

"Having someone with your... extracurricular activities on this project would be problematic, don't you think?"

Trevor's face drained of color. His knees buckled slightly as he recognized his own penthouse in the damning images.

"I've got boxes of these. Would you like me to have more developed, Mr. Maddox?"

"N-no, that won't be necessary—"

His bravado evaporated like morning mist.

Evelyn's stiletto tapped a slow rhythm against the floor. "Just as I suspected. That hotel incident wasn't your first rodeo." She leaned forward, voice dropping to a lethal whisper. "I've already identified every woman in these photos. Imagine their reaction when they discover you've been recording your... encounters."

Trevor's pulse hammered in his throat. He'd been so careful—burning the original drives, paying off the cleaning staff. How had she—?

Still, the Sterling deal represented millions. He forced a sneer. "Those women got exactly what they wanted. If you think public scandal scares me—"

"Save your breath." Evelyn cut him off with a slash of her hand. "Your name stays off the project."

Something shifted in the air—an almost palpable shift in power dynamics. For the first time, Trevor truly saw the ice in Evelyn Carter's gaze.

"Tell me who your contact is at Sterling Enterprises," she purred, "and I might reconsider."

Trevor's jaw worked soundlessly.

It wasn't loyalty that kept him silent—but self-preservation. Naming his benefactor would be tantamount to admitting corporate espionage. One word to Nathan Sterling, and his career would be ash.

"You'll regret this," he spat, slamming the door hard enough to rattle the framed degrees on her wall.

Maxwell stepped forward. "Shall I have security escort him out?"

"Not yet." Evelyn examined her perfect manicure. "Let him scurry back to his master. I want to see which rat hole he disappears into."

She glanced at her watch. "The Sterling meeting?"

"Scheduled for 2:30. Conference room B."

"Excellent." A genuine smile touched her lips for the first time that day. "What's Adrian's status?"

"Private jet to Mardovia departed at 6 AM."

"Finally." Evelyn stretched like a satisfied cat. "Some peace and quiet."

At noon, Victor Langley called with apologies—an unavoidable shareholder meeting would prevent him from attending. Any questions could be directed to his VP.

Evelyn acknowledged the change without comment, collecting her materials. The white crocodile Birkin matched her dove-gray Valentino suit perfectly, the ensemble projecting effortless authority.

She entered the Sterling conference room precisely at 2:28, Maxwell trailing with the presentation materials.

Nathan Sterling already occupied the head of the table, long fingers steepled before him. When Evelyn walked in—every head turning at her entrance—something dark flickered behind his impassive gaze.

"Gentlemen." Evelyn's greeting held just enough warmth to be professional, just enough chill to remind them she wasn't here to make friends. Her eyes skimmed over Nathan as if he were part of the furniture. "Shall we begin?"

Nathan's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly. The air between them crackled with unsaid words, with the memory of last night's argument still raw.

"Hmm." His response was glacial, matching her tone perfectly.

Maxwell hid a smile. This would be an interesting afternoon.
###Chapter 55 I Won't Be a Silent Partner

The fundamental agreement between Kingsley Industries, Sterling Enterprises, and Langley Corporation had finally been reached.

After triple-checking the contract terms, only minor details remained to be finalized.

As primary investors providing both capital and personnel, Kingsley Industries and Sterling Enterprises naturally demanded thorough oversight.

Even the slightest oversight could cost millions in lost revenue - no one wanted their investments mismanaged.

Evelyn Carter flipped through the project timeline, her brow furrowing. "Why haven't any Kingsley Industries personnel been included in the knowledge exchange program?"

Standard practice dictated all three corporations share strategic resources. Yet the document explicitly listed only Sterling Enterprises and Langley Corporation as participants.

"Langley Corporation and Sterling Enterprises have been collaborating on this initiative from inception," came the smooth reply. "Introducing Kingsley Industries staff now would disrupt workflow."

"We'll brief your team once we achieve tangible results."

The speaker was Cassandra Blake - a forty-something director from Langley Corporation whose frozen Botox smile never reached her eyes. "Is that so?" Evelyn's lips curved in a deceptively mild smile as she closed the proposal folder.

"Then perhaps Ms. Blake could explain why Kingsley Industries still can't access the nanorobot core technology despite our signed agreement?"

Cassandra sipped her water, clearly prepared for this challenge. "These matters require Mr. Langley's personal authorization. We can't risk security breaches through premature disclosures."

Her sideways glance at Nathan Sterling confirmed his silent complicity. Their very public divorce had clearly eroded any professional courtesy.

Evelyn's smile turned glacial. "So until Mr. Langley returns from overseas, Kingsley Industries remains locked out of the technology we're funding?"

"Are you suggesting we should just write blank checks while you make all the decisions?"

"Ms. Carter, you're overreacting." Cassandra appealed to the other executives. "We're simply prioritizing security. Wouldn't you agree?"

The silent conference room spoke volumes.

Nathan observed quietly from the sidelines as Evelyn leaned forward. "Then we'll terminate the contract."

Cassandra's facade cracked. If Kingsley Industries withdrew because of her power play, Victor Langley would have her head.

"That's impossible! All parties have signed binding agreements. Withdrawal constitutes breach of contract."

Evelyn shrugged. "We can afford the penalty."

Cassandra's glass hit the table with a clatter. "The damages would be astronomical!"

"Kingsley Industries would rather burn that money than fund our own exclusion." Evelyn's eyes glinted dangerously. "Especially since blocking your future medical distribution channels would recoup our losses tenfold."

Cassandra's forehead gleamed with sweat. Langley Corporation needed Kingsley' capital, but more critically, their global healthcare network.

Contract termination could derail the entire nanotech initiative - including Trevor Maddox's carefully orchestrated investment scheme.

She suddenly regretted letting Trevor manipulate her into strong-arming Evelyn. This profit grab had backfired spectacularly.

"Let's not be hasty, Ms. Carter. Everything's negotiable. We'll implement the knowledge transfer immediately."

"If everything's negotiable..." Evelyn's gaze swept across the suddenly attentive executives. "Then let's renegotiate everything."

###Chapter 56 We Can't Do That.

"Raise your hand if you think adding new team members is too much hassle. Consider this your resignation notice effective immediately after this meeting."

The room erupted in chaos. They hadn't included Kingsley Industries' staff under Cassandra's instructions. Why should they face consequences now?

"The contract explicitly states Kingsley Industries retains full authority over all department heads involved." Evelyn Carter's voice cut through the noise like ice. "Isn't that correct?"

Cassandra Blake's forced smile grew increasingly strained. "Ms. Carter, have you considered how this will impact project continuity?"

"Deputy heads can step up. If Barnes Group can't even provide adequate backups for such a small team..." Evelyn's lips curled into a humorless smile. "Then perhaps contract termination becomes necessary."

Nathan Sterling's jaw tightened. "We can't do that."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow, her voice glacial. "Funny how you never objected to this tone before. Doesn't feel so good when the tables turn, does it?"

Nathan froze as memories flooded back. He searched desperately for any instance where he'd spoken patiently to Evelyn, but came up empty-handed. The realization left him speechless.

"While our companies are collaborating, let's minimize personal meetings unless absolutely necessary." Evelyn adjusted her blazer. "We wouldn't want another... elevator incident."

When the doors opened on the ground floor, Evelyn strode out with regal indifference, leaving Nathan trapped in the elevator with his thoughts.

That evening at Halo Bar, Evelyn, Olivia Sinclair, and Natalie Reeves collapsed onto plush velvet couches after dancing. Natalie handed Evelyn her phone with unusual seriousness. "Thoughts?"

Evelynn's confusion melted into amusement when she saw the screen. Olivia peeked over and immediately erupted. "Which gutter-dwelling paparazzi took these? Natalie, track them down and destroy them!"

The headline screamed: "Executive's Scandalous Affair With Subordinate." Below grainy photos showed Evelyn entering a hotel with Trevor Maddox after his altercation.

The comments section overflowed:

"No way! She traded Sterling Enterprises for this?"
"At least make the rumors believable - an affair with her boss would be more credible!"
"Divorce clearly broke her. Now she's power-hungry and desperate."
Natalie swirled her whiskey, ice cubes clinking. "My team's already tracing the source. We'll have answers by morning."

Evelyn set the phone down calmly. "How uninspired. These tabloids are recycling the same tired narratives."

Natalie shook her head in disbelief. "Only you would analyze gossip like market trends."

Olivia tugged Evelyn up. "Enough! Let's go sing."

As they approached the outdoor stage, they nearly collided with Gregory Hammond, who had two scantily clad models draped over him. Nathan stood nearby, looking irritated.

"Mission accomplished, bro." Gregory pulled the women closer with a drunken laugh.

Nathan's gaze sharpened. "Explain."

Gregory smirked. "Found security footage of Ice Queen Carter's hotel rendezvous. Posted it everywhere with juicy headlines." He raised his glass triumphantly. "That cheating bitch deserves the public shaming."
###Chapter 57 Who Gives Me That Right

"Erase it immediately." Nathan's expression darkened.

"You don't understand the full story. Things happened after you left."

Gregory scoffed. "What's there to understand? She's exactly that type of woman."

"If you hadn't dragged me away that day, I would've exposed those two cheating scumbags myself! They should be ashamed of their disgusting affair!"

Remembering Nathan's devastated expression recently, Gregory burned with righteous anger for his friend.

The more he spoke, the more furious he became. "First she humiliated me at the racetrack, then threatened me. The world needs to know what kind of—"

"Really? I'm waiting to see how you'll expose me." Evelyn's icy voice cut through the air, making Gregory jump.

"Damn it, why do you keep appearing everywhere?" Gregory shuddered, goosebumps rising on his skin. His luck was terrible—always getting caught badmouthing people.

Evelyn stood with arms crossed behind him.

She turned to Natalie beside her. "Perfect. Seems we've found our culprit without even searching."

Olivia pointed an accusing finger at Gregory. "So you're the one bullying my Evelyn! You'll pay for this!"

Evelyn restrained her, pulled out her phone, and typed rapidly.

She showed Gregory the screen. "Just sent your wife photos of your little escapades with these ladies."

Gregory immediately pushed away the women clinging to him. "Evelyn! You snitched on me?"

"I hear your wife earns triple your salary, and you have zero say at home."

"Now that she's seen evidence of your infidelity, I wonder if she'll file for divorce."

Gregory's jaw dropped. "That's—that's nonsense! My wife would never believe you!"

Despite his bravado, he frantically checked his phone. Seconds later, his wife called.

He stepped aside, answering meekly. "Hello, darling."

His wife's enraged screams blasted through the speaker, forcing Gregory to lower the volume.

"You have twenty minutes to get home. Or face the consequences!"

"Yes, yes! Coming right now! Don't be angry, sweetheart!"

Hanging up, Gregory stormed toward Evelyn. "What the hell is wrong with you?"

"You're signing my death warrant! This is worse than your stupid reputation!"

His words ignited Evelyn's fury. Her voice turned deadly calm. "So only your reputation matters while mine—"

Evelyn's sharp gaze swept over Gregory's companions. "What makes you people so superior?"

She couldn't believe her reputation had been destroyed by baseless rumors while Gregory acted like his image was priceless.

As Nathan moved to explain, he met Evelyn's blazing eyes and froze.

Under her accusatory stare, he remembered the online hate she'd endured—all because of him. Guilt crushed him.

Meanwhile, Evelyn mocked herself for ever considering lowering herself to please these people.

What utter foolishness.

During her marriage to Nathan, they'd always looked down on her. At every gathering, they'd treated her like dirt beneath their designer shoes.

Now divorced, they still acted superior, as if she'd taken advantage of him.

Her blood boiled. Just then, a janitor passed by carrying a bucket of vomit with yellow oil floating on top.

Without hesitation, Evelyn grabbed the bucket and dumped its contents on Gregory.

"Ahhh!" The putrid stench made Gregory scream. He looked to his friends for help, but they all backed away.

Nathan turned his head, grimacing. "Go clean yourself. Don't come near me."

Evelyn accepted tissues from Olivia, wiping her hands. "Why didn't you cash my check? Did you trash it? I'll write another one tomorrow."

With that, she linked arms with Natalie and Olivia, heading toward the stage.

Gregory shoved Nathan. "Dude, control your woman! She's completely lost it!"

Nathan shot him a frigid glare. "Who gives me that right? We're divorced."
###Chapter 58 The Mask Slips Off

"Gregory didn't mean it like that. He misunderstood you, so just drop this argument." Nathan's voice was strained as he caught up to Evelyn in the hallway.

Evelyn yanked her arm free. "How noble of you to defend your friend, Mr. Sterling. Who gave you the right to tell me what to do?"

Nathan glanced past her at Natalie and Olivia, both glaring daggers at him.

"Can't you be the bigger person here? Let's talk this out like civilized adults."

A slow, icy smile curved Evelyn's lips, her eyes sharp and unfeeling. "You're nothing but a ghost from my past. We were never friends."

Though he'd heard those words before, they still cut deep. His jaw tightened.

"The apology statement goes live tomorrow morning. I'll make sure he takes down that poster."

"Stop pretending," Evelyn scoffed. "They treat me this way because you let them. Don't act innocent now."

"Me?" Nathan's brow furrowed in disbelief.

Disappointment darkened Evelyn's expression as she held his gaze.

"Your silence gave them permission. They thought I was weak, someone they could walk all over. So why put on this act now?"

"Vanessa and Eleanor's disdain was bad enough, but Gregory's tantrum? Your hypocrisy makes me sick."

Nathan stiffened. He'd never paid attention to how Evelyn was treated when she lived under his family's roof.

He'd assumed everything was fine—surface-level peace. He'd kept his distance. No children, a fact Eleanor never let her forget.

His friends had mocked Evelyn in front of him, and he'd never corrected them. Their contempt had festered because of his indifference.

The realization filled him with shame.

Evelyn turned away, the ache in her chest fading. "I don't need your help to make Gregory apologize. I have my own ways."

Without another glance, the three women walked off, leaving Nathan standing alone.

Evelyn looped her arm through Olivia's. "What song do you want to hear tonight? I'll sing it for you."

Natalie studied her. "Are you okay?"

"Never better."

"If you're not feeling it, we can leave." Natalie, usually stoic, sounded genuinely concerned.

Evelyn shook her head. "He's not worth ruining our night over."

"My girl doesn't get sad over trash men!" Olivia tugged them toward the crowd. "We're getting wasted tonight!"

"You're right. We're not leaving until we can't walk straight!"

The next morning, Evelyn sat in her office, skimming through a report while the investment director beamed beside her.

The document detailed Adrian's victory against Morgan Bank, securing a high-profile acquisition.

"Ms. Carter, we hit the jackpot with Adrian! The odds were against us, but he pulled it off. I was too excited to sleep last night."

"Agreed. Outstanding results." Evelyn nodded, her tone measured.

Once he left, her phone buzzed with an unknown number: Tonight, as promised.

Her brow arched. Adrian.

He'd proven himself, so she wouldn't back out. But she would find out how he got her number.

At closing time, Evelyn headed straight to the lobby—only to find Adrian's sleek sports car already waiting.

He stepped out, rounding the hood with confident strides before opening the passenger door. "After you, my lady."

This time, she slid in without protest.

Adrian took her to Lumière, an upscale restaurant bathed in soft candlelight. He pulled out her chair, then signaled the violinist nearby.

The musician began playing Canon in D as the manager approached, presenting a crystal rose bouquet.

The effort was undeniable. Evelyn eyed the roses coolly. "Set them down."

"You don't like them?" Adrian asked.

Her expression remained unimpressed.

"Look around. This place is full of couples, and you're staging a proposal scene. Did you really think I'd enjoy this?"

"It's our first date. I wanted to make an impression. Isn't this what women like?" His grin was boyish.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Only if they like you. Otherwise, it's just awkward."
###Chapter 59 The Divorcee's Revelation

Adrian's lavish display drew envious glances from every couple in the upscale restaurant.

Whispers rippled through the dining room as patrons speculated whether this was an elaborate proposal setup.

At a corner table barely fifteen feet away, Nathan Sterling sat stiffly beside his wife, their reconciliation dinner turning bitter.

It had taken Nathan three days of groveling to coax his furious spouse into this public outing. Now fate had cruelly placed Evelyn Carter directly in his line of sight - with another man.

Nathan's fingers flew across his phone, capturing Adrian's profile before texting Gregory. "Check this out. Your ex-wife's already hunting fresh prey. Not bad for a rebound, eh?"

Downtown at Sterling Tower, Nathan was mid-presentation when his phone vibrated. The CEO's expression darkened as he read the message, a vein pulsing at his temple.

The entire boardroom froze when Nathan suddenly slammed his phone onto the polished mahogany table.

"Carry on without me," he growled, snatching his suit jacket as he stormed out, leaving stunned executives exchanging bewildered looks.

Back at the restaurant, Adrian straightened his tie with theatrical solemnity. "Ms. Carter, I owe you an apology for my previous... misguided approach."

Evelyn swirled her merlot, lips quirking. "Apology accepted. Provided you never pull such a stunt again."

Adrian leaned forward, eyes burning with sincerity. "But you must understand - my feelings are genuine. When you outmaneuvered that fool into overpaying for that bracelet at auction, I was captivated."

His voice dropped. "Then seeing you vulnerable on that rooftop... Evelyn, I may play the playboy, but that night changed everything."

Evelyn remained unmoved, taking a measured sip. "You do realize I'm divorced?"

Adrian didn't hesitate. "That changes nothing. You're perfection."

A dangerous smile played on Evelyn's lips. "Don't you want to know who my ex-husband is?"

"Some idiot who didn't deserve you," Adrian scoffed, just as Nathan's imposing figure materialized behind him.

Evelyn's eyes glittered with mischief as she nodded toward the approaching storm. "That would be him."

Adrian whirled around, his confident smirk freezing when he recognized Nathan. "Sterling? What are you—"

Nathan ignored him, his smoldering gaze locked on Evelyn. Gregory chose that moment to saunter over, comprehension dawning as he took in the scene.

"Well, well," Gregory drawled, smirking at Adrian's confusion. "Didn't I mention? Your 'perfect woman' is Nathan's ex."

Adrian's face drained of color.

With deliberate slowness, Evelyn rose and thrust the crystal rose bouquet into Adrian's arms. "Keep these," she purred. "Or sell them to pay for your friends' eye exams."

Gregory spluttered indignantly, but one icy glare from Evelyn silenced him.

Adrian swallowed hard, looking between them. "Nathan... is this true?"

The restaurant held its breath as three lives teetered on the edge of revelation.
###Chapter 60 I Would Rather Die Than Marry That Witch

Nathan took an excruciatingly long pause before finally growling, "What's your explanation?"

"Her?" Adrian gasped, his finger trembling between Evelyn and Nathan. "And you?"

The realization hit him like a freight train. His own finger now pointed accusingly at himself. "I—"

"What fresh hell is this?" Adrian's voice cracked. His world tilted on its axis. He needed air. Space. A damn time machine.

Gregory coughed into his fist, leaning in with mock sympathy. "Rule number one, mate—never mess with another man's wife. You've stepped in it now."

Adrian's face flushed crimson. "She told me she was divorced! Free as a damn bird!"

His fist connected with Nathan's shoulder. "How was I supposed to know she was your ex?"

Evelyn moved to leave, but Nathan's icy command froze her mid-step. "Aren't you going to explain this mess?"

Her laugh was sharp as shattered glass. "Explain myself? To you?" The door slammed behind her with finality.

"Wait! You're just leaving us like this?" Adrian's shout echoed down the hallway.

Nathan stormed out next, Gregory hot on his heels like a loyal shadow.

Adrian spent the ride home in stunned silence. Sleep? Impossible. His mind raced all night.

By dawn, he was barging past Evelyn's startled secretary without apology.

Evelyn didn't even glance up from her documents. "Here to grovel? Or did your little bro-code lecture not take?"

"I've done nothing but think all night." Adrian squared his shoulders, voice steady with newfound conviction. "If anything, I'm more certain now. I want you."

Evelyn's pen stilled. "You're joking."

"Your past doesn't define you." Adrian spoke faster, afraid she'd cut him off. "Nathan was the fool who let you go. You made the right choice."

Evelyn had expected retreat. Not this... bewildering persistence.

"Not interested."

"Don't shut me down yet!" Adrian dragged a hand through his hair. "We're both single adults, even though—"

Evelyn's lips curled as she tapped her tablet screen. "Even though what?"

Adrian collapsed into a chair. "It's complicated."

"Then uncomplicate it."

"Fine." He exhaled sharply. "No more secrets. I'm the Prescott heir. Only took this stupid job to be near you."

Evelyn nodded. "Obviously."

Adrian blinked. "You knew?"

"Please. Did you really think a fake name badge would fool me?"

Adrian swallowed hard. "Then you know about... the engagement?"

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "The one with your boss's sister? Oh, I've heard."

Adrian groaned. "Exactly! Some dried-up spinster named Evelyn Carter. Can you believe the coincidence?"

Evelyn's grip tightened on her stylus. "Ever consider I might be her?"

Adrian barked a laugh. "Not a chance. That woman's probably got warts and a mustache. You're... well, you're you."

The temperature in the room dropped ten degrees.

"Is that so?" Evelyn's voice dripped venom. "And your brilliant plan?"

"Simple!" Adrian slammed his palms on her desk, leaning in with fiery determination. "I'm breaking it off today. That witch will never be my wife."

Evelyn's sudden chuckle sent chills down his spine. "No cold feet? What if she makes you pay?"

Adrian scoffed. "What's that hag going to do? Hex me?"

His ringing phone shattered the moment. Reginald Prescott's name flashed on screen.

"Dad, not now—"

"You ungrateful little shit!" The roar made Adrian jerk the phone away. "Have you lost your damn mind?"

Adrian frowned. "How did you—"

Then he heard it. The faint echo of his own voice.

Evelyn slowly rotated her tablet.

Adrian's blood turned to ice.

On screen, Reginald's puce face filled the frame, phone pressed to his ear. Beside him, Adrian's mother clutched her pearls in horror.

Just like last night, Adrian's brain short-circuited. The room spun.

History was repeating itself in the worst possible way.
###Chapter 61 The Truth Revealed

"You insolent fool! She's Evelyn Carter! The youngest Carter heir, your betrothed!" Reginald's voice boomed through the speakers, vibrating with barely contained rage.

He had sent Adrian to Pamore specifically to cultivate closeness with Evelyn.

Dominic had objected to this arrangement, forcing Reginald to promise secrecy about Evelyn's true identity. In exchange, Adrian had been permitted to work at Kingsley Industries.

Yet this imbecile had not only broken the engagement but dared to call Evelyn an ugly hag in front of their elders.

Reginald's temples throbbed with rising blood pressure. How he longed to reach through the screen and throttle his son.

Adrian staggered to his feet, shaking his head in disbelief as he stared at Evelyn.

The stunning goddess before him couldn't possibly be the same woman from his memories.

"The woman I've been pursuing... is the fiancée I've been trying to avoid?"

He wished the floor would swallow him whole. "This can't be happening!"

With a shuddering exhale, he stumbled out like a man possessed, drawing muffled laughter from Evelyn.

After terminating the call, she collapsed into gales of unrestrained laughter in her empty office. Sweet revenge tasted better than she'd imagined.

Watching her tormentor's soul leave his body brought more satisfaction than any lottery win. Moments later, Dominic called. "Yes, Dominic?" she answered, still breathless with amusement.

"How can you laugh when your fiancé just humiliated you publicly?" Dominic's voice crackled with indignation. How dare Adrian Prescott reject his precious sister?

"Of course I'm laughing. That arrogant peacock needed this reality check. Nobody insults a Carter and gets away with it."

"And his courtship?" Dominic paused. "Don't concern yourself with the Prescott alliance."

"Our business stands strong without marriage pacts. Follow your heart - I'll handle the fallout."

Warmth flooded Evelyn's chest. Her family's unwavering support always fortified her. "Dominic, you remember how he mocked me. Why would I—"

A small smile played on her lips. "At most, I hold a petty grudge. Nothing more."

"Understood," Dominic said simply. "Aunt Beatrice just returned from her global tour and will be in Frenda briefly. Care to visit?"

Evelyn's eyes sparkled. "Finally! I've been dying to see her!"

"She's hosting a photography exhibition there and requested your presence."

"Count me in. I'll fly over immediately after Sophia's jewelry showcase. Julian will be in Frenda too - perfect timing!"

Evelyn's heart swelled with joy. Dominic remained the sole person before whom she could shed her prickly exterior. After discussing the Horizon Technologies collaboration, they ended the call.

That evening, Evelyn accompanied Olivia to VERE Jewelry. Sophia was preparing another Pamore exhibition, demanding her best friends' support.

VERE's avant-garde designs had earned global acclaim.

Pamore's elite had gone into frenzy upon hearing designer Sophia Whitmore would exhibit locally.

Society women clutched their purses in anticipation. While browsing, Evelyn and Olivia discovered several exquisite bracelets.

As a staff member retrieved their selections, Evelyn's fingers brushed against another's.

Celia - or rather, Vanessa Sterling - stood surrounded by socialites, her face twisting in disgust.

"Ugh, my evening's ruined!" Vanessa sneered, snapping her fingers. "Someone fetch sanitizer. Immediately."

Olivia recognized her instantly. "Shouldn't you be in custody? The Sterlings must've pulled strings again."

Ice crystallized in Evelyn's gaze. Predictable - that family specialized in evading accountability.

Vanessa's expression darkened. "Slander! I'll sue you for defamation!"

"Please do! The publicity might revive your dying social relevance," Olivia shot back.

Gasps erupted from Vanessa's entourage. "Vanessa, we missed that banquet... Are the rumors true? Did you actually get arrested?"

"You insolent fool! She's Evelyn Carter! The youngest Kingsley heir, your betrothed!"

Reginald's voice boomed through the speakers with such force it seemed to rattle the screen.

He had sent Adrian to Pamore specifically to foster closeness with Evelyn.

Dominic had objected to this arrangement, forcing Reginald to swear secrecy about Evelyn's true identity. In exchange, Adrian had been permitted to work at Kingsley Industries.

Yet this imbecile had not only broken the engagement but dared to call Evelyn an ugly hag in front of their elders.

Reginald could feel his temples throbbing. He desperately wished he could reach through the screen and throttle Adrian himself.

Adrian staggered to his feet, shaking his head in disbelief as he stared at Evelyn.

The stunning woman before him bore no resemblance to the plain girl he remembered.

"The goddess I've been pursuing... is actually the fiancée I've been avoiding?"

He wanted the ground to swallow him whole. "This can't be happening!"

With a shuddering sigh, he stumbled out like a man possessed, his soul seemingly drained from his body. Evelyn couldn't suppress her laughter at the sight.

After ending the call, she laughed until tears streamed down her face in the privacy of her office. Revenge truly tasted sweetest when served cold.

Seeing her tormentor so thoroughly crushed brought her more satisfaction than any business triumph. Later, Dominic called. "Yes, brother?" Evelyn answered, still chuckling.

"How can you laugh when your fiancé just humiliated you publicly?" Dominic's voice simmered with anger. How dare Adrian Prescott reject his precious sister?

"Laugh? I'm celebrating. That arrogant peacock needed this lesson. Now he'll think twice before disrespecting a Kingsley."

"And what of his courtship now?" Dominic paused. "Don't concern yourself with the Prescott alliance."

"Our family needs no marriage contracts to secure power. Follow your heart, and I'll handle the consequences."

Warmth flooded Evelyn's chest. Her family's unconditional support was her greatest strength. "Dominic, after how he mocked me all these years? You think I could ever care for him?"

A small smile played on her lips. "At most, I'll stop resenting him. But that's all."

"Understood," Dominic said simply. "Aunt Beatrice just returned from her global tour and will be in Frenda briefly. Would you like to visit?"

Evelyn's eyes sparkled. "Finally! I've missed her terribly!"

"She's hosting a photography exhibition there and specifically requested your presence."

"Consider it done. I'll fly over immediately after Sophia's jewelry showcase. Julian will be in Frenda too. What perfect timing!"

Evelyn's heart swelled with joy. Only with Dominic could she shed her prickly exterior completely. They discussed the Horizon Technologies collaboration before ending the call.

That evening, Evelyn and Olivia attended VERE Jewelry's exclusive preview. As Sophia's closest friends, supporting her Pamore exhibition was non-negotiable.

VERE's avant-garde designs had captivated elites worldwide. Pamore's socialites had been in a frenzy since news broke of Sophia's exhibition.

Every heiress clutched their purses in anticipation. Meanwhile, Evelyn and Olivia browsed the collection, selecting several exquisite bracelets.

As a staff member retrieved their choices, Evelyn's hand accidentally brushed against another shopper's. She turned to face Vanessa Sterling, whom she hadn't seen since the scandal.

"Ugh, my evening's ruined!" Vanessa sneered to her entourage of socialites. "Someone fetch sanitizer immediately. I need to disinfect."

Olivia recognized Vanessa instantly. "Shouldn't you be in custody? The Sterlings must have pulled strings to spring you so quickly."

Ice flashed in Evelyn's eyes. Just as expected - the Sterlings' shameless privilege knew no bounds.

They always excused their family's transgressions while holding others to impossible standards.

Vanessa's face twisted in rage. "How dare you! I'll sue for defamation!"

"Please do! The publicity will remind everyone of your arrest," Olivia fired back without hesitation.

The socialites gasped. "Vanessa, we missed that gala. Are the rumors true? Were you actually detained?"
###Chapter 62 Play Stupid Games, Win Stupid Prizes

Vanessa's smirk faltered. "That's ridiculous. I was abroad when that happened. Rumors mean nothing."

Had Eleanor not secretly asked Vanessa's grandfather, Tyler Sterling, to pull strings behind Nathan's back, she might have actually served time.

Evelyn studied Vanessa with icy detachment.

"Now that you're out, try behaving. Feel free to vandalize my store again - if you don't mind going back to jail. I certainly wouldn't mind."

"I never went to jail! Are you even listening?" Vanessa lunged forward, only to be blocked by Olivia.

"Two against one. Really want to try us?"

Both Evelyn and Olivia had reputations for being ruthless.

Vanessa clenched her fists until her manicured nails drew blood from her palms. With no outlet for her rage, she spat through gritted teeth, "Why bother? I'd rather avoid your kind."

Nathan's warning about provoking Evelyn still rang in her ears.

"Finally showing some sense! Our Evelyn isn't someone trash like you should mess with," Olivia sneered, draping an arm over Evelyn's shoulder possessively.

Humiliated, Vanessa stormed off to find her friends - only to learn from staff they'd left without her.

The rejection stung. Shooting daggers at Evelyn and Olivia, Vanessa's hatred burned brighter.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had helped Olivia try several bracelets, but none suited their tastes.

As they turned to leave, a sales associate stopped them. "Ladies, did you forget to return one of our bracelets?" Her smile didn't reach her eyes.

Another associate approached. "We're missing an item. Would you mind checking your belongings?"

"Not our responsibility," Evelyn replied coolly.

The associates exchanged glances, their eyes lingering on Evelyn's open tote before subtly blocking the exit.

Olivia's temper flared. "What's the meaning of this?"

"They obviously think you're thieves!" Vanessa crowed, pointing dramatically. "I saw her slip it into her bag!"

Bolstered by the accusation, the associates grew bolder. "Miss, we'll need to search your bag."

"I stole nothing," Evelyn stated calmly.

"If you're embarrassed, just pay for it discreetly," the associate insisted.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Why would I?"

"Search her!" Vanessa shrieked. "I know it's there!"

When the associates reached for the bag, Evelyn's glacial glare froze them mid-motion.

"Touch it and regret it," she purred, sending chills down their spines.

Vanessa made a grab for it herself, only to yelp in pain as a delicate but viselike hand clamped around her wrist.

The staff gasped upon recognizing the newcomer - Sophia Whitmore, VERE's lead designer, had arrived unannounced.

Olivia beamed. "Sophia! You're early!"

Evelyn smiled. "Good to see you."

But Sophia had priorities. Wrenching Vanessa's arm away, she turned to the trembling staff. "You're both terminated."

The associates paled. They'd never imagined these "window shoppers" were Sophia's personal friends.

Realizing the tide had turned, Vanessa rubbed her wrist, sneering, "Covering for your thieves, I see."

Sophia's voice could have frozen hell. "I'm calling the police. Security footage will reveal the real thief."

"Go ahead! Search every bag here!" Vanessa taunted, confident they'd been in a camera blind spot.

She reached into her purse for her phone - and froze.

Her fingers brushed against cold metal.

Why was the bracelet in her bag?
###Chapter 63 Vanessa the Villain

Evelyn arched an eyebrow with mocking amusement as she stepped closer to Vanessa. "What's the matter? Cat got your tongue? Go ahead, dial the police. I'm waiting."

Vanessa's palms turned clammy, her fingers trembling around her phone. Her mind raced for an escape that didn't exist.

"Puzzled about how my diamond bracelet miraculously appeared in your purse?" Evelyn's voice dripped with sarcasm.

Vanessa's breath hitched. "I don't know what you're implying."

"Did you honestly believe I wouldn't catch you slipping that into my bag?" Evelyn's sudden sharp tone made several shoppers turn their heads.

Unbeknownst to Vanessa, Evelyn had witnessed the entire theft reflected in a nearby mirror. The moment Vanessa's back was turned, Evelyn had returned the favor by placing the bracelet back where it belonged - in the thief's own designer handbag.

Olivia gasped dramatically. "Oh Vanessa, they ought to rename you Vanessa the Villain! What possessed you to try this again?"

"Clearly prison didn't teach you anything last time. Allow me to give you the lesson your family failed to provide," Evelyn declared.

Turning to the store associates, she commanded, "Call security. Now!"

"No! Please don't!" Vanessa lunged at the employees, physically blocking them from reaching the phone.

Fate intervened when Nathan's call flashed on her screen. "Nathan! Help me!" she sobbed into the phone. "They're trying to have me arrested!"

Olivia rolled her eyes. "Listen to her waterworks. As if she's not the criminal here."

Nathan arrived within minutes, his imposing frame cutting through the crowd. The scene before him - Evelyn and Olivia restraining his hysterical sister - made his jaw tighten.

"Nathan! They're attacking me!" Vanessa pointed an accusatory finger, tears streaking her mascara.

Nathan's glacial stare landed on Evelyn before addressing his sister in an emotionless tone. "Explain."

Vanessa opened her mouth, but the damning evidence silenced her. Her wails grew louder instead.

Olivia crossed her arms. "Your darling sister planted a stolen bracelet in Evelyn's bag. When caught, she's suddenly the victim?"

Nathan's mind flashed to every injustice Evelyn had endured from his family. Instead of demanding answers from her, he asked quietly, "Is this true?"

Evelyn's bitter laugh held no warmth. "Why ask me? The proof's in her Prada. Though I suppose tears excuse everything in your world."

"I didn't do it!" Vanessa shrieked.

"Then empty your bag right now if you're so innocent!" Olivia's patience snapped. "Someone call the authorities! Maybe handcuffs will jog her memory!"

Cornered, Vanessa finally cracked. "They humiliated me! Made my friends laugh at me! I just wanted-"

Nathan's rage simmered beneath his stoic facade. He fantasized about shaking his sister until her warped logic rearranged itself. Bailing her out last time had been a mistake.

"I'll purchase the bracelet. Consider the matter closed," he offered dismissively.

Evelyn's piercing gaze stopped him cold. "Did I say we were done here?" The disappointment in her voice cut deeper than anger ever could. Some bonds, it seemed, transcended justice.

"Name any piece in this store as compensation," Nathan tried.

Her bitter chuckle echoed through the jewelry department. "How generous. But unlike some, I can afford my own luxuries. Funny how you're suddenly eager to buy me jewelry after three years of marriage yielded nothing but that ring I returned."

The truth landed like a physical blow. Nathan's chest constricted at the long list of his marital failures.

"Then what will satisfy you?" he ground out.

Evelyn's eyes held Arctic frost. "What do you think?"

Nathan exhaled sharply before turning to his sister. "Apologize. Now."

"Never! I'd rather get booked than apologize to that witch!" Vanessa spat.

"Vanessa Sterling," Nathan's voice turned deadly quiet, "if you land in jail tonight, not one cent of Sterling money will bail you out. Not even Grandmother Margaret's. Understood?"
###Chapter 64 A Vision in Blue

Vanessa finally shuffled toward Evelyn with all the enthusiasm of a condemned prisoner. "I... apologize," she mumbled, barely audible.

Olivia crossed her arms. "Speak up! The entire room didn't hear that."

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms as she forced out louder words. "I'm sorry! Okay? Are you happy now?" Her gaze darted to Nathan. "Satisfied?" The expression on her face suggested she'd rather be anywhere else.

Nathan's voice could have frozen hell. "The question isn't for me to answer." Vanessa turned pleading eyes toward Evelyn.

"If apologies solved everything, we wouldn't need law enforcement. Did I ever say sorry was enough, Mr. Sterling? You overestimate your influence," Evelyn countered.

Her mocking smile made Nathan realize he no longer recognized this woman before him.

"Why should I forgive being wronged so easily? Does her last name make her untouchable?" Evelyn continued.

Vanessa had grown bold precisely because the Sterlings kept excusing her behavior. Evelyn wouldn't make that mistake.

When Sophia understood Evelyn's position, she immediately dialed 911. Within minutes, officers were dragging a screaming Vanessa away for the second time that week.

Watching his sister being manhandled into a squad car, Nathan's expression darkened like a gathering storm.

"All this over jewelry?" He stared at Evelyn in disbelief. "When did you become so cruel?"

Before their divorce, she'd endured every slight with quiet dignity. Now she treated the Sterlings like sworn enemies.

This new version of Evelyn grew more unrecognizable each day. He'd forced Vanessa to apologize, even offered compensation. What more did Evelyn want?

"Funny. I've always been this person. You simply never cared to notice." Evelyn's careless smile didn't reach her eyes. She owed Nathan no explanations.

Without another word, Nathan left for the police station. The moment he disappeared, Evelyn's mask slipped away.

Days later, Sophia's jewelry exhibition opened to much fanfare. Tickets sold out instantly, but she'd reserved prime seats for her closest friends.

Backstage before the show, Evelyn and Olivia arrived wearing custom Prada that complemented Sophia's designs perfectly.

Sophia had been pacing anxiously until their arrival visibly relaxed her. "Two models dropped out last minute. I was terrified we'd have to cancel displaying some pieces."

Her assessing gaze swept over them. "You'd both be perfect."

"Seriously?" Evelyn raised an eyebrow.

Sophia winked. "Absolutely. You'll outshine any professional model."

Exchanging amused glances, the friends realized they'd been recruited as impromptu models. "Well then," Olivia grinned, "let's give them a show to remember."

The exhibition's "Nature's Essence" theme featured jewelry inspired by organic forms and colors. Critics praised how these pieces redefined traditional design paradigms.

Every guest sat riveted, unwilling to blink and miss any detail of Sophia Whitmore's groundbreaking collection.

For lively Olivia, Sophia selected "Golden Sunrise" - yellow diamonds arranged like sunbeams. Paired with flowing chiffon, Olivia became a woodland nymph come to life.

As music swelled, Olivia's radiant entrance captivated the audience. The jewelry sparkled, but her infectious energy stole the show. Catching Sophia's eye, she tossed her hair with theatrical flair before making way for the professional models.

Then came the moment everyone awaited - the reveal of the collection's pièce de résistance.

Under ethereal lighting, a vision in blue emerged. When Nathan recognized the model, his breath caught painfully.

Evelyn moved with effortless grace, her delicate collarbone adorned with Sophia's masterpiece - "Ocean's Lament."

The exquisite blue diamond necklace should have been the star. Yet somehow, Evelyn's quiet elegance outshone even these priceless gems. Together, they created magic.

The audience sat transfixed. No one dared breathe as Evelyn commanded the space with each measured step. Her subtle smile held mysteries they longed to solve, her poise demanding their complete attention.

For those privileged few, time stood still before such breathtaking beauty.

Vanessa finally shuffled toward Evelyn with reluctant steps. Her apology came out in a whisper barely louder than rustling leaves. "I... I'm sorry."

Olivia crossed her arms, her voice sharp. "Speak up! That's not an apology."

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms as she forced the words out louder. "I said I'm sorry! Are you happy now?" Her gaze darted to Nathan. "Is this enough for you?"

Nathan's expression remained frosty. "That's not my decision to make." His eyes flicked toward Evelyn meaningfully.

Vanessa turned pleading eyes toward Evelyn, who merely arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow. "If apologies solved everything, we wouldn't need law enforcement. Did I ever say an apology would keep you out of handcuffs?" Evelyn's laugh was cold. "You overestimate your family's influence, Mr. Sterling."

The mocking curve of Evelyn's lips made Nathan's chest tighten. This woman before him felt like a stranger.

"Why should I forgive being framed so easily?" Evelyn tilted her head. "Does the Sterling name grant immunity from consequences?"

Vanessa had grown bold precisely because the Sterlings had always shielded her from repercussions. Evelyn had no intention of letting history repeat itself.

Sophia wasted no time calling the authorities. Within minutes, officers arrived to escort a screaming Vanessa away for the second time. She kicked and thrashed like a wild animal being caged.

Watching his sister being manhandled into the police car, Nathan's expression darkened to thunderous levels. "All this over jewelry?" He stared at Evelyn in disbelief. "When did you become so cruel?"

Before their divorce, she'd endured every slight with quiet dignity. Now she treated the Sterlings like sworn enemies.

This version of Evelyn grew more unrecognizable by the day. He'd forced Vanessa to apologize publicly and offered compensation. What more did Evelyn want?

"Darling," Evelyn purred, "I've always been this person. You simply never bothered to look closely enough." She waved him off without further explanation, her smile vanishing the moment he turned toward the police station.

Days later, Sophia's highly anticipated jewelry exhibition opened to rave reviews. Tickets had sold out within hours, but Sophia had reserved front-row seats for her closest friends.

Backstage before the show, Evelyn and Olivia arrived in stunning custom Prada ensembles that turned heads. Sophia, who'd been pacing anxiously, visibly relaxed at their arrival.

"Two models dropped out last minute," Sophia confessed, running a hand through her hair. "I was panicking about filling their spots in time." Her assessing gaze swept over them. "You two would be perfect."

Evelyn blinked. "Seriously?"

Sophia grinned. "Absolutely. You'll outshine any professional model out there."

Exchanging amused glances, the friends agreed. "Alright, let's do this."

The exhibition's "Nature's Symphony" theme featured pieces inspired by organic shapes and colors. International critics praised the collection for revolutionizing traditional jewelry design.

Every attendee remained riveted, unwilling to miss a single moment of Sophia Whitmore's genius.

For vibrant Olivia, Sophia selected the "Golden Sunrise" set - yellow diamonds that complemented her effervescent personality perfectly. As the music swelled, Olivia floated down the runway like a woodland nymph, earning gasps of admiration.

Then came the moment everyone awaited - the reveal of the collection's pièce de résistance.

Spotlights illuminated the runway as a breathtaking vision emerged. Nathan's breath caught when he recognized Evelyn gliding toward him, her delicate collarbone adorned with Sophia's masterpiece - "Ocean's Lament."

The exquisite blue diamond necklace paled in comparison to Evelyn's ethereal beauty. Together, they created magic.

The audience sat transfixed, unable to look away from Evelyn's graceful movements. She commanded the space with effortless elegance, her aloof magnetism holding everyone captive.

No one dared breathe for fear of breaking the spell. Every eye followed her, every heart beat faster at her smile. In that moment, Evelyn Carter wasn't just beautiful - she was unforgettable.
###Chapter 65 Not for Sale

The moment Evelyn stepped onto the runway wearing "Ocean's Whisper," Sophia knew she'd made the right decision. The audience's collective gasp confirmed it.

Nathan Sterling's breath caught in his throat. He hadn't anticipated seeing Evelyn again after their last disastrous encounter.

For weeks, he'd been drowning in regret, convinced fate had played a cruel joke on him. He'd resolved to stay away, to respect her boundaries after his mistakes.

Yet here she was, making his pulse race uncontrollably just like that moonlit night on the terrace.

"Mother, look! It's that cursed woman again!" Vanessa hissed, tugging at Eleanor Blackwell's sleeve.

Eleanor's lips curled in distaste. "I have eyes, Vanessa. No need to announce the obvious."

Vanessa immediately fell silent. After her latest arrest scandal, even breathing too loudly earned her mother's wrath.

Eleanor's gaze fixated on the sapphire necklace, a new scheme forming. Purchasing that masterpiece could restore the Blackwell family's tarnished reputation.

Recent events had been disastrous - Evelyn's public humiliation at the luxury boutique, Vanessa's arrest. They'd become laughingstocks among Pamore's elite.

Whispers followed them everywhere - "tacky," "pathetic," "thieves."

As the show's finale piece, Evelyn remained onstage while Sophia delivered her closing remarks.

"Thank you all for supporting VERE Jewelry. My deepest gratitude to our incredible team, and especially to-"

Eleanor rudely interrupted. "Ms. Whitmore, name your price for that necklace."

Sophia's eyes flashed. "How extraordinarily rude."

The crowd murmured disapprovingly, but Eleanor stood her ground, arrogance dripping from every pore. "Spare us the theatrics. I'm offering to buy it now."

She'd come prepared this time, armed with Nathan's black card with its astronomical limit. That necklace would be hers.

Evelyn's icy voice cut through the tension. "It's not for sale."

"You're just the hired help! What gives you the right to decide?" Eleanor shot to her feet.

Sophia smiled serenely. "Actually, she has every right. Ladies and gentlemen, may I present my muse and the true designer of this piece - Ms. Evelyn Carter!"

The audience erupted in fresh admiration.

"That's incredible! She designed it herself?"
"Sophia Whitmore's personal muse!"
"Talented and stunning - what a combination!"

Eleanor scoffed. "Designer or not, if VERE wants my business, you'll sell it."

Sophia delivered the final blow. "Actually, Ms. Carter provided all materials herself. We're merely exhibiting it for her."

Eleanor's face turned purple, as if she'd swallowed something vile, while the crowd's whispers grew louder.

"Rich, beautiful AND talented?"
"The ex-mother-in-law's making quite the spectacle."
"True artistry can't be bought."
"New money never learns."

Vanessa tried dragging Eleanor away, but reporters swarmed them.

"Mrs. Blackwell, how does it feel being publicly rejected by your former daughter-in-law?"
"That necklace is valued at nearly a billion. Rumor says you couldn't afford a $180K piece last month. Care to comment?"
"After how your family treated Ms. Carter, do you really think you can buy her forgiveness?"

###Chapter 66 Makeup Removal Gone Wrong

"Forgiveness? Don't make me laugh!" Eleanor spat before fleeing with Vanessa in tow.

The reporters pursued relentlessly, their cameras capturing every humiliating moment.

Backstage, Evelyn casually set Ocean's Whisper aside while Olivia changed in another room. She smiled at the photos flooding their group chat.

"Babe, we killed it out there!" Olivia had texted.
"Absolutely stunning," Evelyn replied.
"Wish I hadn't missed it for that business trip!" Natalie chimed in.
"Drinks later to celebrate?" Sophia suggested.
"Did you see Eleanor's face? Priceless!" Olivia added.
"Some people never learn," Evelyn typed.

As if summoned, the door burst open to reveal Eleanor and Vanessa, faces contorted with rage. Evelyn smirked, regarding them like particularly bothersome insects.

"Back for more humiliation? How... persistent."

"Sell me that necklace!" Eleanor demanded, eyeing the carelessly placed masterpiece with envy. Her salvation lay in that sapphire.

"Need your hearing checked? I said no." Evelyn began removing her jewelry before the mirror.

"Name your price!"

"Not happening." Evelyn's nonchalance made Eleanor sway dangerously.

Seeing her mother falter, Vanessa snatched Evelyn's makeup brush and lunged with a bottle of remover.

"Let's wash off that whore's paint!"

Evelyn dodged effortlessly, her gaze turning arctic. "You've gotten bold."

In one fluid motion, she seized Vanessa's wrists and dragged her toward the restroom, forcing her face toward the toilet bowl.

"Let go! Mom! Help!" Vanessa shrieked as the water loomed closer.

"Since you're so eager to remove makeup..." Evelyn purred in her ear.

Eleanor stumbled in, only for Evelyn to overpower them both. With brutal efficiency, she dunked their heads repeatedly until they emerged gasping, their designer outfits ruined, makeup running in black streaks.

As Evelyn shoved them out, Nathan appeared down the hallway. "Your knight in shining armor," she mocked.

This time, he didn't ask for explanations. "What did you do now?" he demanded of his family.

"Nathan! This witch tried to drown us!"
"She refused to sell her necklace then attacked us!"

Nathan's gaze lingered on Evelyn, struck anew by her beauty. Since their confrontation at the jewelry store, an inexplicable pull had grown stronger.

"I apologize for my mother's behavior earlier," he said stiffly.

"Save it. They can speak for themselves." Evelyn's tone left no room for argument.
###Chapter 67 It Was Me

"Trust me, Nathan. Mother and I wouldn't be in this situation if that cursed woman hadn't provoked us first." Vanessa's voice trembled with desperation, her fingers twisting nervously in her lap.

Eleanor Blackwell swayed dramatically, clutching her chest as if about to collapse—until Vanessa caught her just in time.

Evelyn Carter watched their theatrics with a smirk. "That's right. It was me," she declared, lifting her chin defiantly. She had no patience left for their games. Turning on her heel, she moved to leave.

But Nathan Sterling blocked her path, his dark brows drawn together. Evelyn took a deliberate step back, her expression icy. "Move."

Nathan's gaze flickered to Eleanor and Vanessa, both feigning distress, and something in his expression shifted.

"How long are you going to keep this up?" His voice was low, edged with irritation.

Evelyn let out a humorless laugh. "Keep what up?"

"Aren’t you just punishing them because you're still bitter about the past?"

"You really think that little of me?" She shook her head, incredulous. "I don’t have time for petty revenge. They’re not worth the effort."

"If you’re so above it all, then why attack me?" Vanessa shrieked, struggling to hold up Eleanor, who promptly swooned again.

Evelyn arched a brow. "You keep pushing, and you won’t like where it leads."

She turned her sharp gaze back to Nathan. "Control your family before they humiliate themselves further."

Her voice dropped to a warning. "Next time, I won’t stop at just wiping off their makeup with toilet water."

Nathan remained unmoved, his jaw tight.

"We were married once. Do you have to be this cruel?"

Evelyn’s lips curled into a mocking smile. "Oh, I ran out of nice things to say long before the divorce."

She tilted her head, eyes glinting with disdain. "If you want flattery, ask Isabella Delaney. I’m sure she’s full of sweet nothings for you."

"Nathan!" Vanessa wailed. "How can you let her talk to us like this?"

Eleanor stirred weakly, clutching her chest. "Nathan… defend me…"

Her act was painfully transparent, but she clung to the hope that Nathan would take her side.

Yet he stood frozen, caught between anger and something else—something like regret.

He couldn’t bring himself to scold Evelyn, not when he was the one who had pushed her away.

"Adrian Prescott’s voice cut through the tension. "Nathan, what’s going on?"

He stepped between them, shielding Evelyn protectively. "Are you okay?"

His concern was genuine. He’d seen the articles about the Sterlings’ treatment of Evelyn, and the sight of them ganging up on her made his blood boil.

Evelyn blinked in surprise but quickly composed herself. "I’m fine, Mr. Prescott. Thank you."

Nathan’s expression darkened at the way Adrian hovered over her. "This is a private matter. Stay out of it."

Adrian didn’t back down. "You’re divorced. Evelyn isn’t part of your family anymore." His voice hardened. "Her business is my business now."

A muscle twitched in Nathan’s jaw. "Even divorced, she’s still mine."

"Was yours," Adrian shot back. "Past tense, Nathan."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "I’m leaving before this gets any more pathetic."

She turned on her heel, striding toward the exit.

"Come back here, you witch!" Vanessa screeched.

Adrian hesitated, torn between confronting Nathan and following Evelyn. In the end, he chose her. "Wait for me!"

Nathan watched them go, his posture rigid, but the loneliness in his stance was unmistakable.

Outside, Evelyn walked aimlessly, the cool night air clearing her mind. She barely registered Adrian’s presence until she reached the overpass, staring down at the blur of headlights below.

When she turned, Adrian stood behind her, holding out a handkerchief.

Silence stretched between them—heavy, but not unwelcome.
###Chapter 68 Less Annoying Than Before

Adrian Prescott's usual playful demeanor was replaced by a gentle smile. "Seems you don't need my handkerchief after all."

Evelyn Carter maintained her stoic expression. "Obviously. I wasn't crying."

"I thought you'd be sobbing like last time." Adrian produced a second handkerchief from his pocket, eyes twinkling with mischief. "Came prepared with backups."

The memory of that rooftop night in Darai flashed through Evelyn's mind. She cringed internally at the thought of breaking down before her supposed rival. Her mask slipped slightly.

"That never happened. Your memory's faulty."

Adrian didn't argue, simply nodding. "Must be mistaken then." Watching Evelyn's stormy expression, he wondered if Nathan Sterling had been the cause of those tears.

"Want me to rough him up for you?" Rare seriousness colored Adrian's voice as he cracked his knuckles. "Just say the word."

Evelyn scoffed. "He's your best friend. The fact you're not taking his side is miracle enough."

Adrian thumped his chest dramatically, triggering a coughing fit. "Justice doesn't pick sides! Friendship doesn't excuse bad behavior."

His earnest expression reminded Evelyn of a knight pledging fealty to his queen. There was something disarmingly genuine about how he looked at her.

The ridiculousness made Evelyn's lips twitch. "You're full of nonsense."

"Only if you're willing to listen." Adrian closed the distance between them.

"Smooth talker," Evelyn teased, but this time her smile reached her eyes.

Compared to Nathan's willful blindness, Adrian's loyalty felt like a breath of fresh air. When she met his gaze again, she realized something surprising - he wasn't nearly as irritating as before.

"Serious question," Adrian straightened abruptly. "Can we pretend I never insulted you? I was an idiot."

He rubbed his neck sheepishly. "I've grown since then. Didn't realize I was hurting someone so..." His voice trailed off meaningfully.

Evelyn tucked windblown hair behind her ear. "Already forgotten. Just stop with the daily declarations of love."

"Not happening!" Adrian's stubborn grin returned. "I'm not giving up on courting you."

"Insufferable." Evelyn turned to leave but paused, throwing over her shoulder, "Thanks."

"Anytime! And if Nathan bothers you again—"

"I know, I know." She waved him off, calling for her driver.

That night, Sophia Whitmore called as Evelyn prepared for bed. "You vanished! Olivia was worried sick."

"The Sterlings showed up. Couldn't deal with their nonsense." Evelyn flopped onto her silk sheets.

"Tears of the Ocean's secured in the vault."

"Oh. Right." Evelyn had completely forgotten about the billion-dollar necklace.

Sophia's exasperated sigh traveled through the phone. Only Evelyn could treat a fortune like spare change.

"Speaking of," Evelyn teased, "I'm visiting Frenda tomorrow. Any messages for Julian?"

"Brat. Goodnight." The line went dead with a click.

Evelyn giggled. She really needed to orchestrate Julian's return to Pamore - those two were painfully obvious.

The next morning found Evelyn boarding a private jet to Frenda. She went straight to Beatrice Whitmore's villa.

"Evelyn darling!" Beatrice swept her into a perfumed embrace the moment she arrived. "I've missed you terribly!"

"Missed you more." Evelyn nuzzled into Beatrice's shoulder like a contented kitten. "Aunt Bea, I've been dreaming of your cooking."

"Anything for you, sweetheart." Beatrice cupped Evelyn's face fondly, then feigned sternness. "If you missed me so much, why the radio silence?"
###Chapter 69 Contemplating Harrison

"I had prior engagements," Evelyn replied with a practiced smile.

Beatrice had been like a second mother to Evelyn ever since her biological parents passed away. Beatrice and her husband Arthur Whitmore had stepped in to fill that void.

Only when Evelyn turned eighteen did Beatrice finally stop hovering and began her globetrotting adventures.

Throughout Evelyn's formative years, Beatrice had been the maternal presence she desperately needed. That bond made Evelyn consider her family.

Evelyn's gaze swept the room before landing playfully on Beatrice. "Aunt Beatrice, where's Uncle Arthur hiding?"

"Why bring him up?" Beatrice feigned irritation. "Don't waste breath on that impossible man."

"Understood." Evelyn suppressed a chuckle. Beatrice and Arthur were like oil and water - constantly bickering when together, yet anxious when apart.

Their youthful passion had led to a divorce during one particularly heated argument.

Arthur's regret had been instantaneous. Thus began his decades-long quest to win back his wife.

He'd abandoned all interest in running Whitmore Enterprises, dumping the responsibility on Harrison's shoulders when the boy wasn't even eighteen, choosing instead to chase Beatrice across continents.

"Evelyn, Dominic told me about your divorce." Beatrice tapped Evelyn's nose reproachfully. "You're a grown woman now. When will you stop treating marriage like some fleeting whim?"

"My dear, haven't I always taught you? When someone wrongs you, strike back twice as hard." Beatrice's eyes flashed with protective fire. "You're my precious girl. Between Whitmore Enterprises and Kingsley Industries, you've got an army behind you."

"I stayed silent because I didn't want to burden my family." Evelyn clung tighter to Beatrice's arm, her voice softening. "Forgive me."

Evelyn wasn't incapable of vulnerability. She simply reserved her tenderness for those who truly mattered.

Beatrice's sudden sigh after Evelyn's apology prompted concern. "What troubles you, Aunt Beatrice?"

Fingers carding through Evelyn's hair, Beatrice murmured, "Given how close I was with your mother, you should have been my daughter-in-law. Then you'd never have endured such pain."

"But the Prescotts claimed you first." Beatrice's voice thickened with regret. "My fault for being so preoccupied with travel."

"That chapter's closed now."

Eyes glistening, Evelyn leaned into Beatrice's embrace. "You and Uncle Arthur are family. With you both in my life, I lack for nothing."

"Evie darling," Beatrice's tone turned mischievous, "now that you're unattached, have you considered Harrison? Tall, devastatingly handsome, mature beyond his years. I should arrange a meeting."

"If sparks fly, we could host the wedding immediately." Beatrice's enthusiasm grew with each word. "Well? What say you, my dear?"

Silence stretched. Only Evelyn's steady breathing filled the space between them. Beatrice paused, then squeezed Evelyn's hand with understanding.

"Rest now, sweetheart. It's been an exhausting day."

That night, Evelyn slept more peacefully than she had in months. Come morning, she accompanied Beatrice to the highly anticipated photography exhibition.

Beatrice wasn't merely Harrison Whitmore's mother. She was also the legendary travel blogger "Sunny," ranked among Instagram's top three influencers.

Her photographs were hailed as timeless masterpieces in artistic circles. Today's exhibition chronicled her global adventures.

Art connoisseurs and corporate sycophants alike had fought viciously for tickets, with the gallery selling out six months in advance.

"Aunt Beatrice, did you truly encounter a tribal chief in the Azantian rainforest?" Evelyn asked in awe.

"Would I fabricate such tales?" Beatrice guided Evelyn toward a striking photograph. "There's the man himself."

Just then, Evelyn's peripheral vision caught Nathan Sterling and Isabella Delaney across the gallery. Nathan stood ramrod straight amidst the crowd, his aloof demeanor and piercing gaze projecting his usual aristocratic detachment.

Isabella, noticeably pregnant, flaunted her Chanel ensemble while constantly cradling her belly. The sight turned Evelyn's blood to ice.

Her smile froze as an arctic chill spread through her veins.
###Chapter 70 Fate's Twisted Joke

The world truly worked in mysterious ways.

"I'm delighted you made it, Nathan," Isabella cooed, reaching for his hand only to have him skillfully evade her touch.

"Business associates to attend to," Nathan stated curtly, already turning away without a backward glance.

Isabella's nails dug into her palms. Two entire months in Frenda without so much as a phone call from him. Not even for the sake of their unborn child.

When she turned back from watching Nathan's retreating figure, her breath caught. Evelyn stood mere feet away, accompanied by an elegant older woman who carried herself with quiet dignity.

Isabella deliberately smoothed her dress over her pronounced bump, approaching with the air of a queen confronting her usurper.

"You again? Do you have some sort of tracking device on me?" Isabella sneered.

Evelyn didn't bother looking up. "I was about to ask you the same question."

The pregnant woman's smile turned venomous. "How pathetic. You couldn't wait to sign those divorce papers, yet here you are, haunting him like some lovesick specter—"

"Is this the homewrecker who destroyed your marriage, darling?" Beatrice cut in, eyeing Isabella with open disdain.

"Watch your tongue, grandma," Isabella snapped.

Beatrice's perfectly sculpted eyebrows shot up. "Grandma? Gracie, do I look like someone's grandmother to you?"

As the founder of ME Cosmetics, Beatrice Whitmore had access to every anti-aging secret known to mankind. Most mistook her for Harrison's older sister rather than his mother.

"You're breathtaking, Aunt Beatrice," Evelyn said smoothly. "Some people just have the manners of a backalley cat."

She added with deliberate nonchalance, "And for the record, Nathan Sterling is about as appealing to me as yesterday's garbage. Your insecurity is showing."

Isabella's face darkened. "You little—"

"We're in polite company," Evelyn interrupted, still examining the exhibition pieces. "Walk away now, and I might forget this ever happened."

"This isn't your personal property," Isabella scoffed.

Beatrice stepped forward, her smile razor-sharp. "Actually, that's exactly what it is."

"Impossible!" Isabella laughed derisively. "This is Sunny's exclusive collection. What would two nobodies like you know about high art?"

She advanced, malice dripping from every word. "From what I hear, you're just some orphaned country bumpkin who got lucky bedding a CEO. Stop pretending to be something you're not."

The temperature seemed to drop several degrees. Beatrice's usually warm eyes turned glacial. "Repeat that. I dare you."

Evelyn grasped her arm. "She's not worth it, Aunt Beatrice."

But the older woman shook her off. She could tolerate personal insults, but no one disparaged her goddaughter.

Isabella smirked at her reaction. "What? Did I hit a nerve? Everyone knows the truth—she's just a gold-digging whore, and you're some peasant aunt tagging along for free vacations."

Her voice turned saccharine. "Better take lots of pictures. They'll be the only luxury you'll ever—"

"APOLOGIZE!" Beatrice's command cracked through the gallery like thunder.

"Make me," Isabella taunted. "You raised this gutter trash, and now you want to play offended?"

Something in Beatrice snapped. In one fluid motion, she seized Isabella by the collar and slammed her against the nearest wall with surprising strength.
###Chapter 71 The Spoiled Brat

"I said, apologize!"

"Dream on!" Isabella spat back defiantly. "I'm a Delaney heiress. Why would I apologize to some washed-up old woman like you?"

Beatrice's hand shot out like lightning, delivering another stinging slap across Isabella's face. "Such disrespect!"

The second slap had Beatrice raising her hand for a third strike, but Isabella managed to duck this time.

Evelyn subtly flashed Beatrice an approving thumbs-up, whispering, "That was brilliant, Aunt Beatrice."

"Naturally. Trash like her deserves nothing less." Beatrice smirked. "Just stay behind me, darling. I'll handle this."

Warmth flooded Evelyn's chest at Beatrice's fierce protection. This was what real family felt like - unconditional love that didn't require gifts or favors.

The forceful impact sent Isabella staggering against a nearby pillar. The commotion drew curious onlookers like moths to flame.

Clutching her reddened cheek, Isabella whimpered for her brother Sebastian. Tears welled in her eyes as she pointed accusingly at Beatrice.

Sebastian rose, ready to defend his sister's honor - until he saw who she'd provoked. His anger evaporated instantly, replaced by nervous sweat.

These were people far beyond their league.

"My deepest apologies! We've overstepped. We'll leave immediately!" Sebastian bowed deeply, voice trembling with deference.

"What are you apologizing for? She assaulted me!" Isabella shrieked.

"Silence!" Sebastian roared.

As the crowd thickened, Sebastian grew desperate to remove his sister before further damage was done. He grabbed her arm, but she resisted like a petulant child.

"I want that hag to apologize!"

Just then, a team of imposing bodyguards materialized beside Beatrice. "Shall we remove them, Madam Whitmore?"

"No need." Beatrice waved dismissively. "Let them continue embarrassing themselves."

The realization finally struck Isabella. "Sebastian...who is she?"

"Madam Beatrice Whitmore of Whitmore Enterprises!" Sebastian hissed through clenched teeth. "You just insulted the hostess at her own gala!"

Isabella's legs nearly gave out. That country bumpkin beside Evelyn actually owned the exhibition? Her stomach dropped as she realized the magnitude of her mistake.

"Please forgive us, Madam Whitmore. My sister is...inexperienced." Sebastian's bow deepened further.

"Inexperienced?" Beatrice scoffed. "She's pregnant, not prepubescent. Or is she some overgrown infant?"

Evelyn stifled a laugh. Classic Beatrice - ruthless wit backed by absolute authority.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"The Delaneys have lost their minds crossing the Whitmores!"

"They should be groveling for favors, not causing scenes!"

"Wasn't Sebastian negotiating a Whitmore partnership? That's dead now."

"Damn! I've got pending deals with Whitmore in Milan!"

"Forget Milan. Offend the Whitmores and you're blacklisted continent-wide!"

The whispers crescendoed. Several CEOs immediately called their assistants to withdraw Delaney investments before hastily exiting.

Sebastian's face darkened with each overheard comment. He whirled on Isabella. "Look what you've done!"
###Chapter 72 Under Her Spell

Isabella Delaney had never been screamed at with such intensity before. Her lips quivered with humiliation, yet she refused to let her posture falter.

She would never lower her head before anyone - least of all Evelyn Carter. This entire mess in Frenda instead of Pamore was Evelyn's doing to begin with.

Just as the tension peaked, Nathan Sterling came striding toward them.

A wicked idea sparked in Isabella's mind. She closed the distance between herself and Evelyn until they stood mere inches apart.

Evelyn regarded her with exhausted eyes. "What now?"

There was a dangerous glint in Isabella's gaze - the look of someone ready to drag their enemy down with them. "You brought this on yourself, Evelyn," she sneered.

Then with a dramatic shriek, she deliberately collapsed backward into an ornate three-foot vase.

The priceless ceramic shattered as Isabella's head struck the pillar with calculated precision before she feigned unconsciousness.

Evelyn watched impassively. Same old tricks from the same old schemer.

As Nathan rushed to Isabella's side, his voice turned glacial. "Why didn't you catch her, Sebastian? You were right there!"

Sebastian Delaney's expression darkened. He'd seen his sister pull this stunt since childhood whenever she couldn't manipulate her way out of trouble.

As her brother, he recognized the performance instantly. Yet family loyalty kept him from exposing her.

Nathan's icy glare shifted to Evelyn. "Have you no decency? Not even for a pregnant woman?"

His emotions toward Evelyn remained a turbulent storm - including an anger he couldn't rationalize.

He'd tried to talk. She'd refused. He'd humbled himself with apologies on his family's behalf. She'd offered no forgiveness.

When Beatrice Whitmore recognized Nathan defending Isabella, her voice turned lethal. "You cheating scoundrels! Get—"

"Aunt Beatrice, I've got this." Evelyn gently squeezed the older woman's hand before turning to Nathan.

"Are you truly so bewitched by Isabella?" She gestured sharply to the security camera overhead. "Shall we review what actually happened?"

"By all means." Nathan matched her frosty tone. "No expectant mother would risk her child like that."

Sebastian nearly laughed aloud. If only you knew.

Isabella, still playing unconscious, began panicking. In her haste, she'd forgotten about surveillance.

With Evelyn's powerful allies, this could force her into a humiliating public apology. Unthinkable!

"Nathan...what happened?" Isabella fluttered her eyelids dramatically, pressing a delicate hand to her forehead.

Evelyn smirked. "Right on cue. The performance concludes."

Nathan released Isabella, his expression turning arctic. "Did Evelyn push you?"

"No, I...I just fell." Isabella's sheepish act was Oscar-worthy.

Rage flashed in Nathan's eyes as he scrutinized her. "Then why the scream?"

His glacial stare sent chills down her spine. "I was startled!"

"Are we done here?" Evelyn asked pointedly. Nathan flushed with embarrassment at her indifference.

With Isabella's stunt ruining his potential partnership with Fulton Group, Nathan had no choice but to retreat.

"Take her home," he ordered Sebastian before striding away. Outside the exhibition hall, he called his driver with a sharp command. Isabella hurried after him.

"Nathan, I'm so sorry. I don't know what came over me."

He remained stone-faced.

Isabella's eyes welled with practiced tears. "I've been under such stress...with Diana's anniversary approaching..."

Nathan's expression softened slightly at his late fiancée's name. "Just focus on the baby. No more theatrics."

"Nathan...would you visit Diana's grave with me?" Her pitiful gaze would melt most hearts. "I've been in Frenda too long. I just..."
###Chapter 73 She Made Evelyn Cry

"Then go home for a day or two, but come back right after the anniversary."

Nathan had always been endlessly patient with Isabella because of Diana and Alistair. This time was no different.

Isabella placed a hand on her stomach, her expression growing increasingly sly.

This time, she would do whatever it took to stay in Pamore. She refused to spend another second in that cursed villa.

She wanted to see how Evelyn planned to seduce her man if she were dead.

Meanwhile, after kicking them out, Evelyn's mood lifted. She spent the next hour chatting with Beatrice about her travels.

When the exhibition ended, Beatrice had the mall shut down the boutique so the staff could focus entirely on serving her and Evelyn.

By the time they finished shopping and returned home, hours had passed. Evelyn collapsed onto the couch.

"You really are the woman who crossed the Mkkan Strait. Your stamina is unreal. I'm impressed," she mumbled.

Beatrice directed the maids to hang up her designer purchases, then smiled.

"I haven’t bought you clothes in ages, so I went all out today. Tomorrow, we’ll hit a different mall."

Evelyn glanced around the living room. Despite its massive size, it was now packed with enough clothes and jewelry to stock a boutique.

"We’re still shopping?" Evelyn groaned.

"Obviously."

"I’ll be back in Pamore soon. I can’t possibly wear all of this."

"Then I’ll ship them to you. Or keep them in a dedicated room here for your next visit."

Evelyn shook her head, amused. What a luxurious problem to have.

Then, Beatrice remembered something important and quickly sat beside her.

"Evie, stay a few more days. Harrison returns tomorrow—you two should meet up."

Evelyn didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. "Fine, whatever you say, Aunt Beatrice. I haven’t seen him in years anyway. Might as well catch up."

Beatrice frowned. "Stop calling him your other brother. He’s just Harrison. You’re not even related, and I’m trying to set you two up."

"Help! Aunt Beatrice is playing matchmaker again!" Evelyn bolted to her room.

"Oh, come back here! I haven’t even listed all his good qualities yet!"

Evelyn locked herself in her room. When she checked her phone, she saw a message from Julian:

"Evie, why haven’t you visited me in Frenda? I’m heartbroken."

"Weren’t you busy with your concert prep? Didn’t want to bother you," she replied.

"Nope. Stadium show tomorrow. If my precious Evie isn’t there, I’m walking offstage."

"Ugh. Fine. I’ll be there."

The next morning, Evelyn was jolted awake by noise outside.

"Beatrice! Open the damn door!"

Peering through the curtains, she spotted Arthur downstairs, knocking with a bouquet of lilies.

When he noticed her, he waved frantically. "Evie! Let me in! I’ve been standing here forever!"

"Don’t you dare, Evie! Let him suffer!" Beatrice’s voice rang from the adjacent window.

Evelyn stifled a laugh. Watching these two act like teenagers in a rom-com was endlessly entertaining.

"Evie, do this for me. I’ll owe you big."

She cleared her throat. "Aunt Beatrice, it looks like rain. What if Uncle Arthur catches a cold?"

From the other room, Beatrice sighed. "Fine. Let him in—but not upstairs."

"Got it!"

At breakfast, Beatrice reminded her, "Remember, Evie. You’re meeting Harrison today."

"But I promised Julian, Aunt Beatrice," Evelyn said guiltily. She could have rescheduled, but the idea of dating Harrison still felt weird.

The Harrison she remembered was a rigid traditionalist, years older than her. She couldn’t shake that image.

"Hmm, true. Julian first." Beatrice nodded. "Take my car."

"Thanks, Aunt Beatrice!" Evelyn hugged her tightly.

Soon, she was speeding down the road in Beatrice’s Pagani Zonda. The car’s sleek design drew stares from every driver.

After all, this limited-edition hypercar was one-of-a-kind. Most had only seen it in ads.

They craned their necks, desperate to glimpse the owner.

But Evelyn checked the time and hit the gas, leaving them all in the dust.

All they could do was sigh as the car vanished.
###Chapter 74 Celestial Spotlight

When Evelyn arrived at the concert venue, Julian's manager was already pacing by the VIP entrance. Tossing her keys to a waiting valet, she slipped into the exclusive front-row seat reserved just for her.

The proximity to the stage was breathtaking. Sapphire banners emblazoned with Julian's stage name - "Hartwell" - rippled across every surface of the arena.

As house lights faded, thousands of blue LED bracelets ignited simultaneously, transforming the space into a shimmering galaxy.

The bassline thrummed through Evelyn's chest. When the curtain dropped revealing twelve synchronized dancers, her gaze instantly found Julian center stage.

After an electrifying opening number, Julian struck his final pose beneath a single spotlight, chest heaving. In that crystalline moment, he wasn't just a performer - he was a supernova.

The crowd erupted.

"Hartwell! Marry me!"

"You're my eternal muse!"

Spotting Evelyn, Julian's lips curved into that trademark smirk that made stadiums swoon. Jumbotrons magnified the expression, triggering shrieks so intense several fans required medical attention.

Adjusting his headset mic, Julian's voice dropped to that intimate register fans adored. "Tonight's special because someone irreplaceable is watching." He paused dramatically. "My heart's compass."

The arena collectively held its breath.

Camera operators scrambled until spotlights pinned Evelyn in their glare. The screens zoomed in on her startled expression - raven hair framing delicate features, sapphire pendant catching the light like captured starlight.

For three heartbeats, thirty thousand fans assessed the woman who'd stolen their idol's affection. Then Julian disarmed them completely.

"Will my angels protect her like you protect me?"

The resulting roar shook the foundations.

"Always!"

"Consider it done!"

Evelyn's irritation melted under this unexpected shield of devotion. The raw sincerity in thousands of voices kindled something warm behind her ribs. For the first time, she grasped why Julian sacrificed privacy for this connection.

Post-concert, Evelyn leaned against Beatrice's custom Aston Martin. Instead of the anticipated entourage, Julian appeared alone, shrugging off his leather jacket.

"Miss me, trouble?" He grinned.

Evelyn jabbed a manicured finger at his chest. "You fed me to your fangirls like tribute! I should-"

Paparazzi descended like vultures smelling blood. Their lenses caught everything - the intimate body language, the seven-figure sports car, the way Julian instinctively positioned himself between Evelyn and the cameras.

"Who's the mystery woman, Hartwell?"

"Secret romance?"

"Is she why you turned down the Coachella headline?"

As more fans spilled from the venue, Julian smoothly guided Evelyn into the car. Once clear of the chaos, he scrolled through trending hashtags, chuckling at wild fan theories:

"Childhood sweethearts reunited!"

"Fated since the maternity ward!"

"Arranged marriage between music royalty!"

Evelyn groaned. "Your stans need psychiatric help."

Julian's amusement died when he spotted hate comments. His knuckles whitened around the phone. "I'll bury whoever-"

A sudden glare of headlights.

Evelyn's scream lodged in her throat as eighteen wheels veered into their lane. The Aston Martin's collision sensors shrieked warnings too late.

Metal screamed.

Airbags exploded like gunshots.

Through the spiderwebbed windshield, Evelyn saw the truck reverse for another impact before fleeing into the night. Distantly, she registered reporters too terrified to approach the wreck.

Then - through smoke and twisted steel - a silhouette emerged. Broad shoulders. Precise stride. A face like carved ice beneath the emergency lights.

Nathan Sterling didn't run.

Men like him never did.

But the way his dress shoes crunched broken glass? That was pure fury.
###Chapter 75

"Step on it, Evelyn!"

Evelyn slammed her foot on the accelerator. The sleek silver convertible vanished into the night. Beside her, Julian kept refreshing his social media feed.

He kept shoving his phone in her face with ridiculous theories.

"Listen to this one - they think we were childhood sweethearts reunited by fate."

"Here's another claiming we had a whirlwind romance in Mardovia."

"This one's my favorite - says our mothers arranged our marriage in the womb."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "The internet really needs better hobbies."

"Oh, and—"

"And what?"

"And there's some nasty comments about you—"

Evelyn shot him a death glare. "I swear I'll throw you out of this moving car!"

The convertible roared down the deserted highway. Suddenly, an eighteen-wheeler swerved into their lane without warning.

Evelyn's instincts screamed danger. She jerked the wheel, but too late. A blinding flash of headlights—

Every nerve in her body fired at once. Primal terror seized her as the massive truck plowed into them.

The airbags exploded on impact, pinning Evelyn against her seat. The steering wheel crumpled like paper as the front end collapsed.

Their car spun violently before skidding to a stop in the middle of the road.

The truck reversed deliberately—then rammed them again before speeding off. This wasn't an accident. This was attempted murder.

Paparazzi who'd been tailing them kept their distance, terrified of a potential explosion. Only a few had the presence of mind to dial 911 with shaking hands.

Through the settling dust, a black Bentley screeched to a halt.

The man who emerged moved with lethal grace. He sprinted toward the wreckage, his designer shoes crunching over broken glass.

"Wait—is that—?"

The reporters' cameras started clicking furiously. "That's Harrison Whitmore!"

"Fulton Group's CEO!"

Evelyn felt warm blood trickling down her neck. The acrid smell of gasoline filled her nostrils.

"Evelyn!"

Someone was calling her name through the fog.

The world muted except for that desperate voice. Her eyelids grew impossibly heavy. Through the haze, Harrison's face came into focus.

He wrenched the mangled door open like it was tissue paper, gathering her into his arms.

She pressed her cheek against his chest, soothed by the steady rhythm of his heartbeat.

"Julian..." she whispered.

"He's safe." Harrison cradled her carefully, avoiding her injuries. His calm voice anchored her as darkness crept in.

At the hospital, Julian escaped with just a fractured wrist.

But Evelyn—

Harrison paced outside the OR, his gaze locked on the glowing surgery sign. When the surgeon emerged, his expression was grim.

"She's hemorrhaging. We need blood immediately, but we don't have enough."

Before Harrison could respond, Nathan rounded the corner. "Take mine. I'm O negative."

He'd been drinking when he got the call. Thankfully, Simon had heard the news and alerted him.

The doctor wiped his brow. Every passing second decreased Evelyn's chances.

"The patient has Rh-null blood—the rarest type. Regular donations won't work."

Nathan froze. "What now?"

"You didn't know your own wife had a rare blood type?" The doctor's voice rose in panic. "Besides, you reek of alcohol! Even if she had a common type, your blood's useless!"

For once, the arrogant CEO had no retort. Since when did he pay attention to Evelyn's medical history?

"You never even bothered to learn her blood type?" Harrison's voice cut like a blade. "What kind of husband were you?"

So the rumors were true—Nathan Sterling had neglected his wife. Good riddance to their marriage.

Nathan bristled at the doctor's scolding. When this stranger joined in, he turned with icy disdain.

He recognized the man—Harrison Whitmore, Fulton Group's wunderkind.

"And why exactly do you care?" Nathan sneered. "You seem awfully invested in my ex-wife."

"You're divorced!"

"Everything about her is still my business!" Nathan shot back.

Harrison clenched his fists but held his temper. Saving Evelyn came first. He pulled out his phone.

"Activate the emergency donor list. Get every possible match to this hospital immediately."

After a beat, he added, "Expand the search to all Fulton Group employees. We can't take any chances."
###Chapter 76 Harrison Saved You

"Family members, please wait. I need to verify some details," the doctor said, but his attention was clearly focused on Harrison this time.

When the doctor glanced at Nathan, he barely suppressed the urge to shake his head. This man was completely clueless. No wonder he was the patient's ex-husband.

Nathan stared at Harrison, jealousy burning in his chest. Blood types were such personal information, yet Harrison knew Evelyn's by heart. Swallowing his pride, he demanded, "How did you—"

"That's none of your concern," Harrison cut him off icily. "You should leave now."

"I'm staying until she wakes up." Nathan had sobered up slightly during the ordeal.

Harrison massaged his temples with elegant fingers. "Even if she does wake up, she won't want to see you."

"I was her husband. Doesn't that count for more than some stranger like you?"

"Actually, no. It counts for less."

The two men engaged in a silent battle of wills. Harrison held Nathan's gaze with such unwavering confidence that the latter eventually looked away first.

"At least she'll be alright."

"Naturally. I'm here." Harrison didn't give an inch.

Two days later, Evelyn's eyes fluttered open to find Julian in the adjacent hospital bed, his arm encased in plaster.

"Oh thank God you're awake!" Julian visibly relaxed as consciousness returned to his sister.

"Julian, who saved us?" Evelyn struggled to sit up, her head swimming with the movement. Her last memory was of someone risking their life to pull her from the wreckage.

She only recalled that the rescuer had seemed familiar.

"Harrison! Beatrice Whitmore's genius son. Ring any bells?"

Him? Evelyn's pulse quickened. "Where is he now?"

"Gone already. Said something about urgent business with Whitmore Group and told you to focus on recovering." Julian's words tumbled out excitedly. "You have no idea how bad it was. With your rare blood type, the hospital was helpless, but Harrison had it all arranged. He mobilized a dozen donors—"

"Wait, you mean he knew my blood type in advance and had preparations made?"

"That's exactly what happened."

Evelyn was stunned by such meticulous consideration. "Maybe Aunt Beatrice told him."

"Yeah, you should properly thank them later. But seriously, why didn't you steer the car?"

In a head-on collision, any driver would instinctively protect themselves by swerving to minimize impact on their side—sacrificing the passenger's safety. But Evelyn's passenger had been Julian, and she couldn't bear to endanger him.

She forced a weak smile. "I couldn't risk damaging that famous face of yours. Your fans would have murdered me."

Touched, Julian reached over to ruffle her disheveled hair. "Silly Evie. Promise me you'll never do that again. Protect yourself first. I'm—"

"If anything happened to you, Dominic and Elliot would hunt me to the ends of the earth."

"Alright, fine." Evelyn rolled her eyes playfully. "And let's hope there isn't a next time, you jinx."

Her expression darkened as she recalled how deliberately that truck had plowed into them.

"That accident was suspicious. We need to investigate."

"Already on it. Results should come in a couple days."

Evelyn nodded, her eyelids growing heavy. "I'm exhausted, Julian."

Julian immediately helped her lie back down, tucking the blankets around her. He debated mentioning Nathan's hospital visit but decided against it. Trash like Nathan didn't deserve a second of Evelyn's thoughts.

After two days of bed rest, Evelyn felt restless. The moment Julian stepped out, she attempted to get up.

"What do you think you're doing?" Julian's voice boomed before he even entered the room.

Pouting, Evelyn reluctantly slid back under the covers. "Ugh, come on! I'm turning into a bedridden potato here!"

Julian signaled the attendants to bring her gourmet meal. "Doctor says two more days of rest."

"Julian, why are you so considerate with me but completely clueless with Sophia?" Evelyn couldn't resist asking.

"Are you two gossiping about me?" Sophia's melodic voice interrupted as she appeared in the doorway.
###Chapter 77 Revenge is Best Served Cold

Evelyn Carter stifled a laugh behind her hand, exchanging knowing glances with Julian Hartwell. "Absolutely nothing. We weren't discussing you at all."

"You'd better not be spreading rumors about me," Sophia Whitmore warned sharply.

Julian, normally so talkative, abruptly fell silent. "I need some air," he muttered, adopting an aloof demeanor in Sophia's presence.

The moment he stepped outside, his pleasant expression hardened into icy disdain at the sight of Nathan Sterling waiting there. Blocking the entrance with his body, Julian announced loudly, "You're not welcome here."

Nathan motioned for Simon to present a lavish gift basket. "Please deliver this to her."

"Take that trash elsewhere!" Julian waved dismissively. "Our Evelyn deserves better than your pathetic attempts at apology."

"Is she awake?" Nathan barely acknowledged Julian's presence. Some pretty-boy singer posed no real threat - not like Harrison Whitmore did. That man made Nathan's instincts flare with warning.

"She's awake and recovering splendidly. Now leave." Sophia joined Julian in the doorway, forming an impenetrable barrier.

"See that she's properly cared for," Nathan said before turning away.

This dismissal ignited Julian's temper. "We're taking care of Evelyn because we love her, you arrogant bastard! Not because you ordered us to!"

Sophia tugged Julian's sleeve. "Lower your voice. Evelyn needs rest."

"You're right," Julian conceded with a reluctant smile.

Their eyes met briefly before they both turned away, the unspoken tension between them thickening the air.

At dinner time, Beatrice Whitmore visited Evelyn's room, presenting an elegant leather portfolio. "Harrison asked me to give you this."

Inside, Evelyn found damning photographs of Isabella Delaney exchanging cash with a shadowy figure. Her grip tightened until her knuckles bleached white.

"I always thought Nathan's mistress was just a petty, manipulative woman," Beatrice whispered, trembling. "I never imagined she could be this monstrous. Thank heaven you survived."

Evelyn took Beatrice's shaking hands in her own steady ones. "Don't worry, Aunt Beatrice. I'll be back on my feet in no time."

A dangerous glint flashed in Evelyn's eyes. "If she wants to play dirty, I'll return the favor tenfold."

Days later, exiting the international terminal at Pamore Airport, Evelyn came face-to-face with Nathan and Isabella.

Isabella placed a protective hand on her swollen belly, smirking as she leaned into Nathan. "What a shame your accident wasn't more... conclusive, Ms. Carter. Shouldn't you still be convalescing?"

The missed opportunity to eliminate her rival still burned in Isabella's mind.

"Save your concern for yourself, murderer," Evelyn replied casually, watching Isabella's smirk freeze solid. Had this bitch actually uncovered the truth?

But she'd been so careful! The driver had been paid and dispatched to another continent. This was impossible!

Right on cue, a swarm of reporters descended, microphones nearly gouging Isabella's eyes in their frenzy.

"Ms. Delaney! You're trending worldwide for allegedly hiring an assassin! Care to comment?"

"Is the story true?"

"Did you return because Interpol requested it? Do you think you'll avoid prison?"

Isabella had become public enemy number one during her flight. She looked desperately to Nathan, only to find him staring at her with dawning horror.

"What are they talking about?" Nathan demanded, his voice like cracking ice.

"Lies! All lies!" Isabella shrieked, then turned on the reporters. "I'll sue every one of your publications into oblivion!"

A police cruiser pulled up, officers emerging through the parted crowd.

"Ms. Delaney, you're needed for questioning regarding a serious crime. Please come with us."

Isabella's legs buckled as she clutched at Nathan. "Believe me, darling! I didn't do anything!"

Nathan stepped forward. "Officers, there must be some mistake-"

"We have substantial evidence linking Ms. Delaney to the crime," one officer stated firmly. "This is just routine questioning."

As they led the sobbing Isabella away, reporters swarmed Evelyn instead.

"Ms. Carter! Have you fully recovered?"

"Do you think Ms. Delaney is being framed?"
###Chapter 78 The Sterling Debt to the Delaneys

Evelyn offered a faint smile. "Thank you for your concern, everyone. I'm fully recovered now."

She continued calmly, "Regarding the accident... I trust our legal system won't permit injustice against the innocent. Nor will it allow the guilty to escape consequences."

The journalists immediately redirected their questions toward Julian.

"Online rumors suggest Harrison abandoned all his commitments after the accident to personally care for you. Can you confirm this?"

"Would you share some details about your relationship with Harrison Whitmore?"

"Are wedding preparations underway between you two?"

Evelyn gave an exasperated chuckle. They never forgot the juiciest topics. "At present, I have no comment regarding my relationship with Harrison."

Recognizing her firm stance, the reporters began dispersing.

Nathan observed from the sidelines. That "no comment" earned Evelyn a sharp glance from him.

He burned with questions - about Julian's involvement, about her mysterious connection with that insufferable Harrison Whitmore.

His curiosity matched the media's intensity.

Yet all he could do was watch Evelyn grab her purse and stride away with that infuriating confidence.

That evening found Nathan back in Sterling Enterprises' CEO office.

The entire day spent dealing with Isabella's police station ordeal had drained him.

Isabella had been released on bail pending trial. Her incessant weeping grated on his nerves, so he'd sent her back to Delaney Manor.

The inevitable chaos at home - Eleanor and Vanessa's bickering - held no appeal. The office provided much-needed solitude.

Flipping the lights on, he froze.

Alistair Delaney occupied his chair.

The initial shock faded quickly. Given Isabella's situation, the Delaney patriarch's presence made sense.

"Good evening, Mr. Delaney."

Alistair cut through formalities. "When are you making an honest woman of my granddaughter?"

Nathan paused mid-motion while hanging his coat. The same question had haunted him.

"Let's discuss this after the current situation stabilizes. My schedule's been overwhelming."

"Humph! You've been divorced for months!" Alistair's cane struck the floor sharply. "Yet you still hesitate to formalize things with Isabella! What game are you playing?"

Nathan's irritation flared. "She now has a criminal record from that staged accident. My family won't approve easily."

Alistair scoffed. "You married that nobody Evelyn Carter without hesitation. And now you balk at a minor legal issue?"

"Minor?" Nathan's voice turned icy. "Attempted murder qualifies as minor to you?"

"Never forget - the Sterlings owe our family a life!" Alistair slammed both palms on the desk, his glare murderous.

"Danielle's death resulted from your brother's recklessness! Now Isabella bears the scarlet letter of 'the other woman' because of you!"

"Her reputation's in tatters thanks to your family's disgrace. How much more humiliation must the Delaneys endure?"

"Insult me all you want, Mr. Delaney. But Alexander... is gone. Let the past rest." Pain flickered in Nathan's eyes.

Years ago, his eldest brother Alexander and Isabella's sister Danielle had perished together in a tragic accident.

That day branded the Sterlings forever indebted to the Delaneys.

As for Isabella... truthfully, he remained baffled. One drunken night he barely recalled.

He'd awakened to find a tearful, naked Isabella beside him. Her pitiful sobs would've moved stone.

Then came her pregnancy announcement.

When Evelyn discovered it, she'd demanded divorce papers. Even now, the events felt surreal.

"Some wrongs demand eternal remembrance!" Alistair rose, his warning unmistakable. "This is your final warning regarding Isabella. Refuse again, and that Carter girl will learn what consequences mean."

His smile turned cruel. "Let's see how protective you remain then."

Nathan's gaze turned lethal. "Evelyn stays out of this."

"That's not your decision!" Alistair kicked the office door open and stormed out.

Alone in the darkness, Nathan's fists clenched until his knuckles whitened.

At Kingsley Manor, Olivia studied Evelyn intently.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Planning to stare holes through me?"

"Thank goodness you're intact. Still gorgeous, all limbs accounted for." Olivia flopped onto the sofa dramatically.

Suddenly she sat upright, eyes gleaming mischievously. "So... rumor has it Harrison Whitmore played knight in shining armor?"

Evelyn's lips curved slightly as she nodded.

That dark silhouette in the night remained etched in her memory. Even the recollection now made her pulse quicken.

"He was legendary at our university! What are the odds he'd rescue you? Julian mentioned he arranged a mobile blood bank! How romantic!"

Olivia's knowing glances practically screamed for gossip.

"Aunt Beatrice probably instructed him," Evelyn deflected. "Besides..."

"Besides what? Spill it!" Olivia bounced excitedly.

"I haven't seen him since regaining consciousness. He's... preoccupied."

Olivia groaned. "That's not how this story should go!"

"There is no story!" Evelyn lunged playfully to tickle her friend.

After resting, Evelyn arrived punctually at Kingsley Industries' office.

She'd barely settled when Natalie called.

"Hey superstar, how's our little project progressing?"

"Flawlessly. Everything's falling into place."

Public sentiment had turned decisively against Isabella, with overwhelming sympathy for Evelyn.

The trending headline "CEO 'S' Turns Blind Eye" gained traction by the hour.

"Got a charity gala tonight. You know how I dread these things."

Evelyn chuckled. "Fine, I'll babysit you."

Natalie's bluntness often created awkward social moments. With Evelyn smoothing things over, events became bearable.
###Chapter 79 Strip Down

The clock struck nine when Evelyn Carter and Natalie Reeves made their grand entrance at the high-profile cocktail soirée.

This was no ordinary gathering—it was an exclusive event where Hollywood's elite mingled with media moguls. Naturally, everyone had brought their most dazzling companions.

Evelyn wore a floor-length emerald gown that shimmered under the chandeliers. The silk fabric cascaded like liquid over her curves, secured only by a delicate satin ribbon at the waist.

No jewelry adorned her slender neck or wrists. She needed none. Her natural elegance outshone every diamond in the room.

The moment she stepped through the gilded doors, conversations stuttered to a halt. All eyes turned toward the vision in green.

Gasps rippled through the crowd. No one had expected the editor-in-chief of GEM to arrive with Nathan Sterling's rumored lover in tow.

Yet despite their curiosity, the guests maintained a respectful distance. GEM Magazine's influence commanded that much deference.

Natalie remained her usual icy self, barely acknowledging the endless stream of greetings. Evelyn smoothly intercepted the champagne flutes thrust their way.

"I can actually tolerate these events when you're here," Natalie murmured over the rim of her glass. "Normally I'd snap one photo for social media and escape within fifteen minutes."

Evelyn's crimson lips curved. "I'm honored to receive such high praise from the legendary Natalie Reeves."

Their conversation halted when Charles Sanders, CEO of rival company Glory Entertainment, waddled over.

The squat man's tailored suit couldn't disguise his protruding belly. He resembled a child playing dress-up in his father's clothes.

"Ms. Reeves," he leered, raising his champagne flute toward Evelyn. "Isn't this the infamous Ms. Carter? She's been dominating tabloid headlines lately." He drained his glass in one gulp.

Natalie's reaction was markedly different from her usual detached politeness. Her eyes narrowed to dangerous slits. "Are you blind or just stupid?"

GEM had suffered multiple security breaches recently—all traced back to Glory Entertainment's corporate espionage.

Charles chuckled, unfazed. "Now, now, Ms. Reeves. With all your recent... troubles, I understand the hostility."

His beady eyes gleamed. "Perhaps you should monitor your employees better before I poach them all."

"By all means," Natalie countered smoothly. "Anyone swayed by your offers isn't worth keeping. Consider it free housecleaning."

Her meaning was clear—he'd only stolen her garbage.

Undeterred, Charles turned to Evelyn. "Rumor has it you were involved with Nathan Sterling while still married. Care to comment?"

He licked his lips. "An exclusive interview, perhaps?"

Glory Entertainment desperately needed investors. While their resources paled compared to GEM's, Charles specialized in sensationalism.

The more outrageous the story, the better. It created the illusion that his second-rate company rivaled GEM's prestige.

His question drew every ear in the vicinity. Even the string quartet seemed to play softer.

"Charles—" Natalie's glacial tone now carried lethal intent.

Tampering with her employees was one thing. Spreading vicious rumors about her friend? That demanded retaliation.

"Tired of breathing?" she asked softly.

One word from Natalie, and Glory Entertainment would collapse overnight.

Charles smirked. "Why would I fear? You're still standing here talking to me, Ms. Reeves."

Evelyn stepped forward, her stilettos clicking like a countdown. "Tell me, Mr. Sanders... care to make a wager?"

His eyebrows shot up. "Do continue."

"If you win, you get your exclusive interview." Her gaze traveled pointedly down his ill-fitting suit. "If you lose..."

She crossed her arms, tapping one manicured finger against her elbow.

"You strip naked and walk out. How's that?"

Charles's smile froze. The barb about his physique struck home.

But the opportunity to humiliate GEM's golden girl and gain insider access to Nathan Sterling's private life? That was worth any embarrassment.

"Deal." He extended a sweaty palm. "Just remember your promise, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn's mocking smile widened as curious onlookers edged closer. "Oh, I will. I'm more concerned about your modesty when the time comes."

"What's the game?"

Her emerald eyes flicked toward the nearby gaming tables. "Dice. Highest roll wins."

Charles nearly choked on his laughter.

This woman had just handed him victory on a silver platter.

Before founding Glory Entertainment, he'd been a casino hustler. His entire startup capital came from gambling winnings.

What chance did some socialite have against him?
###Chapter 80 You Lost

"Ladies first."

Nathan leaned back in his chair, gesturing for her to take her turn.

Evelyn picked up the dice cup with an air of disinterest. Her delicate fingers barely moved as she gave it a half-hearted shake before setting it down. "Done."

Nathan smirked, watching her with amusement. She wasn’t even trying.

The dice hadn’t so much as rattled inside the cup. It was almost as if she wanted to lose.

The crowd exchanged confused glances.

Was that it?

No dramatic flourish, no showmanship—just a lazy flick of her wrist.

Did she really think she could win like that?

Pathetic.

Nathan had no intention of holding back. He needed that exclusive scoop on Simon, and he wasn’t about to let some amateur ruin his chance.

He took a deep breath, then launched into an elaborate routine, shaking the cup with practiced precision.

His height made it difficult to see over the table, but that didn’t stop him from putting on a show.

After several minutes of theatrics, he slammed the cup down with a flourish.

Four fives.

A near-perfect roll.

Victory was his.

The spectators erupted in cheers. "Mr. Sterling is unbeatable! No one stands a chance against him!"

Natalie stood beside Evelyn, arms crossed, smirking. "Don’t celebrate too soon. Let’s see what Evelyn has before you start gloating."

Evelyn didn’t even bother to stand. She simply tilted her head toward the cup. "Open it for me."

Her confidence was unnerving.

Natalie lifted the lid—revealing four sixes.

Evelyn leaned back, a slow, mocking smile curving her lips. "Mr. Sterling, you lose."

Nathan’s jaw dropped.

Four sixes? Impossible.

But there they were, undeniable. No tricks, no cheating—just sheer, impossible luck.

His face darkened as he slumped back into his chair.

"Time to pay up, Mr. Sterling." Natalie held up a professional camera, lenses gleaming. "I’ll make sure this goes viral. Consider it my gift to you."

Nathan forced a laugh. "Ms. Reeves, surely we can discuss this like civilized people?"

"I don’t negotiate with losers. Strip."

Evelyn gave him a once-over, unimpressed. "Honestly, I doubt anyone wants to see this as breaking news."

The crowd jeered, egging him on. "Come on, Sterling! A bet’s a bet!"

With no way out, Nathan reluctantly stripped down to his underwear, face burning with humiliation.

"Seems Ms. Carter doesn’t play games unprepared. Clever girl." A deep, gravelly voice cut through the noise.

The crowd instantly parted.

Alistair Delaney, chairman of Delaney Group, stood there, his presence commanding silence.

Everyone knew the rumors—his granddaughter, Isabella, had been tangled up in Evelyn’s messy divorce.

The air grew tense.

Alistair’s men shoved Nathan aside as he took a seat across from Evelyn.

"He got greedy. I just gave him a lesson." Evelyn met his gaze without flinching.

She knew all about Alistair.

He was the real power behind Delaney Group, the puppet master pulling strings.

And he was the one who had encouraged Nathan to leave her.

"Ms. Carter, since you’re so skilled at gambling, why not play a round with me?"

"Why should I?" She tilted her chin up, unimpressed. "What do you have that I’d want?"

Alistair’s jaw tightened. "The internet is buzzing with lies about my granddaughter harming you."

Evelyn laughed. "Lies? She’s already been convicted, Mr. Delaney."

He slammed his fist on the table. "The case isn’t closed!"

Natalie scoffed. "You think you can silence the truth?"

"That depends on how I handle it." Alistair’s eyes gleamed. "If I win, you’ll hold a press conference. You’ll admit Isabella never hurt you."

He leaned forward, voice dropping to a venomous whisper.

"You’ll confess that you were the one who came between her and Nathan. That you were the other woman."

His smile turned cruel.

"And then you’ll strip naked and walk out of here in front of everyone."
###Chapter 81 The Gambit of Deceivers

The crowd gasped in collective shock.

Alistair Delaney was a living legend in Pamore's underground gambling circles. Though he'd maintained a low profile in recent years, his reputation remained untarnished.

Compared to his grandson Sebastian's amateurish attempts, Alistair was in an entirely different league.

Yet for a man of his stature to challenge a young woman seemed undignified.

Evelyn Carter tilted her head with casual indifference. "And what happens when you lose?"

Alistair's intentions were transparent - he meant to humiliate her publicly.

The audacity!

Admit to being the other woman?

Preposterous.

"Young lady, I never lose!" Alistair thundered, his voice echoing through the silent room. "Do you accept my challenge or not?"

His bullying tactics were obvious, yet none dared intervene.

Evelyn's lips curved into a dangerous smile. "If you lose, Isabella kneels before me to confess her sins. She'll slap her own face for meddling in my marriage."

Her gaze dropped to the antique signet ring on Alistair's thumb. "And that heirloom becomes mine."

A collective intake of breath filled the room.

That single ring could purchase a small country.

Alistair had worn the Delaney family treasure for decades - its value beyond monetary measure.

All eyes turned to Evelyn with newfound respect. The girl had steel in her spine.

"Problem?" Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "You demand I strip naked for public humiliation, yet balk at matching the stakes?"

Alistair's fingers twitched around his precious ring, veins bulging at his temples. How dare this insolent chit covet his birthright!

Remembering Sterling Enterprises' plummeting stocks, his expression hardened. "Done."

Natalie Reeves gripped Evelyn's arm. "Are you certain about this?"

"Relax." Evelyn winked. "Just enjoy the show."

Alistair's confidence was absolute. That earlier perfect roll had been beginner's luck. He controlled the dice like a maestro.

"One round. No second chances."

He snatched the dice cup, shaking it with theatrical flair before slamming it onto the velvet surface.

Four perfect sixes stared up at them.

Gasps rippled through the crowd. The master had shown his true skill. All eyes turned to Evelyn with pity.

What could possibly beat this?

Evelyn gave the cup three lazy shakes before setting it down. "Mine's better. You lose."

"Impossible!" Alistair scoffed. "Nothing beats four sixes."

With a flick of her wrist, Evelyn revealed the dice while simultaneously extending her palm. "My ring, please."

The crowd surged forward.

Five sixes.

How?

There had only been four dice!

"Cheat!" Alistair roared, slamming his fist on the table hard enough to rattle the crystal chandeliers.

Evelyn tutted. "Careful, grandfather. You'll damage my new jewelry." Her laughter was light as champagne bubbles.

"If I cheated, so did you." She flipped the cup, revealing a hidden magnet.

Alistair's face darkened to thundercloud purple, but decades of high-stakes gambling had thickened his skin.

"Since we both cheated, we go again!" he declared shamelessly.

Without tricks, pure skill would prevail. He'd crush this upstart properly!

"You said one round, no exceptions." Evelyn's gaze turned razor-sharp. "The only question is - whose deception was more elegant?"

The realization dawned on the spectators - Evelyn had outplayed the master at his own game.

"The entire room witnessed your promise." Evelyn's voice cut like diamond. "Would the great Alistair Delaney really disgrace himself further?"

Natalie chose that moment to raise her camera, the shutter clicks deafening in the tense silence. "Thank you for the exclusive, Mr. Delaney. The tabloids will adore these."
###Chapter 82 The Kneeling Ultimatum

The atmosphere shifted instantly. The crowd had believed Alistair Delaney to be a man of principle, but now they saw him for what he truly was - no different from any other schemer.

"How shameless! Retracting his words after being caught cheating!" someone muttered.

"If Evelyn hadn't exposed him, Ms. Carter would've been publicly humiliated for no reason."

"To force someone to admit being the other woman when she was the legal wife? That's beyond despicable."

"We may be tabloid journalists, but we have standards. Mr. Delaney Senior must be losing his touch in his old age."

"All bark and no bite - how pathetic."

Alistair's veins bulged at his temples as the insults grew more vicious.

"Take it!"

He yanked off the thumb ring violently, nearly slamming it onto the table before thinking better of it. With trembling hands, he placed it gently into Evelyn's palm instead.

His voice dripped with menace. "Guard it well. I'll be reclaiming it soon enough."

Evelyn tilted her head, her smirk widening. "We'll see about that."

She glanced at Natalie, signaling their departure.

"Ms. Carter, allow me to find a proper case for your ring," offered an awestruck waiter who'd witnessed the entire exchange, clearly impressed by Evelyn's gambling prowess.

"No need. A plastic bag will suffice." Evelyn waved dismissively.

"It's not worth special treatment. Just something to toss it in."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

This was a priceless artifact comparable to national treasures! Alistair treated it as more precious than life itself!

Yet here she was, treating it like disposable trash!

Alistair's face twisted in agony. Having surrendered the ring, he could only vent his fury by kicking over a chair before storming out, his face purple with rage.

"Mr. Delaney," Evelyn called sweetly, "don't forget about Isabella's kneeling apology!"

"Hmph!"

Alistair quickened his pace.

Natalie giggled. "Pity Isabella didn't show. Would've loved to see her knees hit the floor right then."

Evelyn's lips curved. "Patience. There's plenty of time for that."

"How are you so good at gambling?" Natalie asked curiously.

"Julian and I used to sneak into casinos for months at a time," Evelyn confessed. "After watching professionals daily, you pick up a few tricks."

"Julian's even better at cheating than I am. I'll have him give you a private demonstration sometime."

Natalie's eyes sparkled with the perfect headline: "Pop Icon's Secret Gambling Mastery."

It would trend for weeks.

But she'd never betray the Kingsley family's secrets.

Their laughter trailed behind them as they exited.

Nathan Sterling's imposing figure leaned against a car, his tailored suit accentuating his broad shoulders. His chiseled features remained impassive, the picture of aristocratic detachment.

Natalie had to admit - the man's looks justified the hysteria he caused among Pamore's women.

Pity about his personality.

Living with that temper would drive anyone insane.

Evelyn pretended not to see him, scanning the parking lot for her vehicle.

Nathan's gaze locked onto Evelyn's emerald dress - a color he'd never seen her wear. Under the golden entrance lights, she glowed like some ethereal woodland spirit, her bare shoulders luminous.

Every laugh, every gesture tugged at something primal within him.

He approached. "Where's the ring?"

Evelyn arched a brow, her expression dripping with disdain. "How obedient. Always fetching things for others."

"You don't need it." Nathan's voice turned icy. "Name your price. Will a check suffice?"

He'd wanted no part in this, but Alistair had dangled Alexander's name yet again.

No choice but to intervene.

"Sent you to collect his prize?" Evelyn's slender neck straightened, her chin lifting defiantly. "What makes you so certain I'll surrender it?"

"You'd gain millions effortlessly. Consider it compensation for our marriage."

"Are you mentally deficient?" Evelyn's disgust was palpable.

"I won this fairly. If you want it, pay properly. How dare you frame this as compensation?"

Nathan faltered. The words had slipped out unbidden.

Despite their severed ties, he kept referencing their marriage whenever they met.

Even he recognized the absurdity.
###Chapter 83 Go Home and Keep Dreaming

The roar of a high-performance engine cut through the air.

From the line of luxury vehicles, a stunning sapphire blue sports car pulled up in front of Evelyn and Natalie.

Julian's right arm remained in its cast as he stepped out from the passenger side. "Evie, I made it!"

Evelyn's gaze immediately went to Julian's injured arm. "You shouldn't be moving around when you're still recovering."

She had returned to the country quietly, hoping Julian would continue his recovery in Frenda. Yet here he was, chasing after her.

"I missed you too much! Besides, the doctor cleared me. Did you really think I'd let you face this alone?"

Julian shot Nathan a challenging glare, marking his territory. He signaled the driver to hand the keys to Evelyn.

"You should drive today."

"You still trust me with your car?"

Evelyn hesitated as she took the keys, her fingers trembling slightly.

Since the accident, nightmares had plagued her sleep. Visions of Julian's lifeless body haunted her.

All because of Isabella!

"Absolutely." Julian nudged her shoulder playfully. "That's all behind us now."

"Perfect chance to test your new toy." Evelyn forced a small smile.

The past was past. She doubted Isabella would dare try anything again. Evelyn controlled her own destiny now.

She wouldn't let trauma defeat her.

Before leaving, Julian turned to Nathan with an icy expression Evelyn had never seen before.

"Keep your mistress on a shorter leash."

"If Evelyn had pressed charges about the accident, we wouldn't have hesitated to take legal action."

Nathan's frustration boiled over. "When the baby comes, I'll leave Isabella!" he blurted.

When Evelyn showed no reaction, he pressed on desperately. "Can't we start over then? Forget everything—"

His words cut off as Evelyn suddenly stopped walking. Nathan's heart leapt.

Was she reconsidering?

Evelyn turned with a dangerous smile, striding back toward him. Without warning, she brought her stiletto heel down hard on his foot.

The sharp point pierced through his leather shoe as she twisted mercilessly.

"Does that hurt?" Evelyn's gaze burned into his. "Wake up, Nathan. Go home and keep dreaming!"

Nathan endured the pain, disappointment flashing across his face.

He'd been fooling himself. Years of neglect couldn't be erased with empty promises.

Evelyn yanked her heel free and rejoined Julian and Natalie. "Let's go!"

After dropping Natalie home, they were en route to Kingsley Manor when Julian suddenly winced in pain.

Evelyn panicked, immediately diverting to the nearest hospital.

The emergency doctor examined Julian and diagnosed simple fatigue from travel.

Evelyn sighed in relief. The long flight had taken its toll.

Nearby, another doctor pulled back a curtain and said bluntly, "Just normal fetal movement. No cause for alarm."

Isabella caressed her belly with slender fingers, her expression softening.

"As long as the baby's fine."

Since the accident revelations, Nathan's attitude toward her had cooled dramatically.

This child was her last hope.

"Evie, want me to settle the score?" Julian nodded toward the neighboring bed with a cryptic smile.

Here? Now?

Evelyn had her back turned and hadn't noticed their unwelcome company.

Isabella felt the weight of their stares. Looking up, she found Evelyn standing mere feet away.

Remembering Evelyn's recent victory, Isabella rose defiantly. "Evelyn! Return my grandfather's ring!"

Evelyn finally understood Julian's meaning. She ignored Isabella, taking Julian's arm to leave.

"I'm talking to you!" Isabella rushed to block their path.
###Chapter 84 The Boy Who Cried Wolf

Evelyn remained motionless.

"Slap yourself, kneel, and beg for forgiveness. You still owe me both. What gives you the right to act so superior?"

Isabella's face twisted with fury. "Have you lost your mind? I'd never kneel to someone like you!"

That icy, detached expression on Evelyn's face infuriated Isabella most of all. She seethed at her failed attempt to eliminate Evelyn, which had backfired spectacularly.

"No matter. If you refuse to kneel now, you'll still end up behind bars after delivering that baby. I have all the time in the world to watch karma claim you."

Isabella scoffed. "Even in prison, I'll bear Nathan's child - the living proof of our love. Our bond can never be severed." Her lips curled maliciously. "Unlike you. Three years of marriage and you couldn't even produce an egg!"

Evelyn's eyes turned glacial. That had always been her breaking point.

The cruelest insult from her failed marriage.

Remembering how Isabella had orchestrated that car accident yet escaped consequences due to pregnancy, Evelyn's restraint shattered. Now this woman dared flaunt her advantage?

Evelyn seized Isabella's collar, yanking her backward like handling a ragdoll. "Say that again."

Isabella flailed helplessly, her petite frame suspended mid-air. One released grip would send her crashing down. At her advanced pregnancy, the consequences didn't bear thinking. Panic set in. "I'm carrying a child! You can't—"

"Where's that arrogance from moments ago?" Evelyn's laugh was arctic. "Scared now?"

Isabella nodded frantically, trembling.

Her frantic gaze found no potential rescuers in the deserted hospital corridor.

"Will you kneel and apologize?"

"Yes! Yes!"

Evelyn had no intention of actual harm - she simply wanted to shut Isabella up. With a vicious shove, she released her grip.

Isabella collapsed to her knees, tear-streaked face pale with shock.

Then she spotted Nathan approaching.

"Nathan! She attacked me and your baby!"

The scene mirrored their confrontation at the Frenda exhibition. Nathan's expression darkened, Isabella's crocodile tears grating on his nerves.

He made no move to assist her, having long since stopped believing her theatrics.

His concerned gaze found Evelyn instead. "Why are you at the hospital? Have your injuries from the accident fully healed?"

"Don't trouble yourself over her. My Evie's perfectly fine!" Julian interjected irritably. Slinging a protective arm around Evelyn, he steered her away.

Isabella struggled upright, tears flowing freely. "Nathan, why won't you defend me anymore?"

Nathan's glacial stare pierced her. "Fabricate enough false alarms, and eventually no one comes when you're truly in danger."

Receiving no comfort, Isabella could only trail after him, silent sobs shaking her shoulders.

Days later, in the executive office...

"Ms. Carter, preliminary negotiations with Langley Group are complete," Maxwell reported. "Mr. Langley returns from overseas shortly for detailed discussions about the technology upgrades." He accepted the signed documents from Evelyn.

"Excellent."

Maxwell hesitated after his report.

Evelyn turned. "Was there something else?"

"Ms. Carter... Sterling Enterprises just announced Nathan Sterling and Isabella Delaney's engagement."

Evelyn's smile turned glacial. "How fitting for the adulterous pair."

Her phone interrupted the moment.

Julian's voice bubbled through. "Evie, come help me select accessories for my next concert theme today? Please?"

Walter had confined Julian to mandatory rest, monitoring his every move. Only by summoning Evelyn could he escape house arrest.

"You need more recovery time."

"It's just browsing designs! No strenuous activity! Come on!"

Evelyn chuckled at her restless brother's antics. "Fine. Have Walter bring you after work."

"Freedom at last!"

At VERE Jewelry...

No staff dared disrespect Evelyn now. The employee who'd accused her of theft had been promptly dismissed.

Since Sophia Whitmore revealed Evelyn as the exhibition's lead designer, staff regarded her with starstruck awe.

And she arrived with Julian Hartwell!

The pop icon himself!

Those relationship rumors must be true!

Employees itched to snap photos of the gorgeous pair but restrained themselves during work hours.

As Evelyn advised Julian on accessory pairings, a familiar voice carried from the entrance.

"Let's select our engagement rings from VERE. What do you think, darling?"
###Chapter 85 The Proposal

Evelyn couldn't help but turn toward the familiar voices, even though she knew she shouldn't.

There they were - Nathan Sterling and Isabella Delaney, walking arm in arm.

The city suddenly felt suffocatingly small.

Isabella tugged Nathan into the jewelry store, their intimate posture making Evelyn's stomach twist.

A bitter taste flooded her mouth as time seemed to freeze.

She'd just heard about their engagement, and now fate had thrown them together while ring shopping.

During their three-year marriage, Nathan had only ever given her one piece of jewelry - her wedding band.

He hadn't even bothered to learn her ring size, forcing her to secretly measure his sleeping finger.

Now here he was, personally selecting rings with Isabella.

The betrayal wasn't just from Nathan - it was from her own past naivety.

A warm pressure on her shoulder announced Julian's arrival. With his bandaged hand, he clumsily held up a sapphire ring. "How's my taste, princess?"

Evelyn shoved her dark thoughts aside, accepting the ring with a small smile. "Not bad. You chose your sister's design."

"Naturally. Great minds think alike." Julian moved in front of her, his broad frame blocking Nathan and Isabella from view. "I want you to have it."

"I can't. The tabloids would have a field day." She shook her head.

Undeterred, Julian dropped to one knee dramatically. "Then will you at least put it on me, my queen?"

The boutique erupted in squeals.

Was Julian Hartwell actually proposing?

With Evelyn Carter's own design, no less?

The staff clutched each other in excitement - this scandal was worth more than their paychecks.

Evelyn swatted his shoulder playfully. "Stop fooling around and get up!"

The assistants gasped louder.

Was she rejecting America's heartthrob?

What a power move!

Outside, paparazzi pressed against the glass, cameras flashing wildly before swarming inside.

"Julian! Are you and Ms. Carter engaged?"

He shrugged with practiced charm. "You saw - I got rejected. Guess I'll have to try harder."

The reporters laughed. "After surviving that car crash together, is she the one?"

Julian winked. "I'll let your imaginations run wild."

He expertly controlled the narrative, giving just enough for headlines without commitments.

"Give us the exclusive when you pop the question!"

"Of course. Now if you'll excuse us..." Julian gestured toward the rings, smoothly dismissing them.

Isabella watched the scene, nails digging bloody crescents into her palms. "Nathan, look how she's stringing along Dominic Kingsley and now Julian Hartwell."

Nathan's expression darkened dangerously.

His engagement to Isabella was purely political - but was Evelyn actually getting married?

To multiple men?

She'd truly become a different woman.

Before he could stop himself, Nathan stormed over. "You're already involved with Dominic. Why play games with Hartwell?"

Julian shoved Nathan back. "Back off. Who Evelyn sees is none of your damn business."

Tension crackled between the men.

Injured arm be damned, Julian was ready to throw down.

He'd waited years for this - ever since Nathan married Evelyn. Now that they were divorced, all bets were off.

Evelyn set the ring down slowly, her voice dripping ice. "By what right are you asking, Mr. Sterling?"
###Chapter 86 You're the Blind One

"As the fiancé of the Delaney heiress or as my ex-husband?" Evelyn's words were measured, each syllable dripping with icy precision.

"Think carefully. Which role gives you the right to ask?"

Nathan stiffened, the weight of his own audacity crashing down on him.

He had no standing here—not when he was currently shopping for an engagement ring with another woman.

Without another word, Nathan turned to Isabella. "Let's go."

Her eyes glittered with smug satisfaction. "But we haven't chosen a ring yet."

"We'll find one elsewhere."

Isabella hurried after him, looping her arm possessively through his. "Wait for me," she murmured.

The moment they disappeared, the mask of indifference slipped from Evelyn's face.

"Still upset?" Julian studied her carefully.

"Say one more word, and I'll tell Dominic you're harassing me," she warned.

Julian immediately raised his hands in surrender. "Don't. He tasked me with looking after you. If you complain, I'm dead."

When they returned to Kingsley Manor, Adrian was already lounging in the living room.

Seeing them laden with shopping bags, he pouted dramatically. "Evie, why didn't you invite me? Shopping with Julian instead of me?"

Julian and Adrian had been childhood rivals, though it was mostly Julian who tormented Adrian.

The grudge stemmed from Adrian once calling Evelyn unattractive as kids—forcing Julian to spend years convincing her she was stunning.

"I only found out about your little stunt because it's trending. Came straight here after my flight." Adrian sprawled across the couch, exhaustion evident.

"How's the project?" Evelyn shifted to a professional tone.

Adrian had been buried in an overseas venture, his workload brutal.

"Relax, Ms. Kingsley." He grinned. "I'm home now. No shop talk."

"If she doesn't discuss work with you, what else is there?" Julian lobbed a cushion at Adrian's head.

"We could talk about dreams. Life. Though neither compares to your spectacular public proposal at the jewelry store."

Adrian flashed his phone screen. "Look. It's everywhere. Multiple hashtags."

"Aren't your fangirls going to attack Evie?"

"Please. They'll adore her." Julian rolled his eyes.

Suddenly, Adrian's expression shifted. "Wait—is Nathan really getting engaged to Isabella?"

He clicked his tongue. "My entire circle's buzzing about him landing a wealthy bride this time."

"But honestly, the man's blind. Letting go of a billion-dollar goldmine like you? Pathetic."

He'd never tell Nathan the truth. Some secrets were best saved for maximum impact.

"You're the blind one." Evelyn's smile was razor-sharp, sending a chill down Adrian's spine.

He'd forgotten how long his cousin held grudges.

Of all the topics, he'd picked this one.

The only reason Nathan had ever gotten close to Evelyn was because Adrian had missed his chance first.

Julian smirked, tossing Adrian's words back at him. "Pathetic."

After dinner, Adrian leaned against the doorway with a cheeky grin. "You've got so many rooms. Mind if I crash here tonight?"

"Get out." Before Evelyn could respond, Julian planted a firm kick on Adrian's backside.

At Sterling Enterprises, Nathan was summoned to Alistair Delaney's office.

"Isabella said you refused to pick a ring. Is that true?" Alistair's tone was laced with disapproval.

Calmly, Nathan replied, "I need to reconsider this engagement."

His mind was still tangled in the remnants of his failed marriage.

Agreeing to marry Isabella had been impulsive. Just like his divorce.

Alistair slammed his desk, face darkening. "You've already announced it publicly! You can't back out now!"
###Chapter 87 A Web of Deception

"I'll expose this to the media," Nathan declared before storming out of the room.

The moment the door closed behind him, Alistair hurled his crystal tumbler against the wall, shattering it into pieces.

His chest heaved as he dialed a number with trembling fingers. "I need you to handle something. Make sure there are no traces left."

"Evelyn Carter." His lips curled into a vicious sneer. "Time to show you what happens when you cross the Delaney family in Pamore."

One week later...

The scheduled meeting between Kingsley Industries and Sterling Enterprises to discuss software upgrades arrived. Evelyn arrived with Maxwell Donovan by her side.

This wasn't just another routine meeting. Today, Sterling's board members would be present to evaluate potential technological breakthroughs.

The air turned frigid the moment Evelyn stepped into the conference room. Victor Langley and Nathan Sterling sat in stony silence at opposite ends of the mahogany table.

"Someone forgot their morning coffee, Mr. Langley?" Evelyn quipped as she set down her designer handbag.

Victor didn't respond. His fingers steepled before him, the usual twinkle in his eyes replaced by cold fury.

He turned to Cassandra Blake with a clipped command. "Explain the situation to Ms. Carter."

Cassandra's voice dripped with accusation. "Three hours ago, our entire nanorobot encryption database surfaced on the dark web. The source code we shared exclusively with Kingsley Industries forty-eight hours ago."

Her glacial stare pinned Evelyn. "Quite the coincidence, wouldn't you say?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a dangerous smile. "Are you implying Kingsley leaked proprietary data, Ms. Blake? That's quite an allegation without proof."

"The timeline speaks for itself." Cassandra's manicured nails tapped the table. "Perhaps this was deliberate sabotage."

A derisive laugh escaped Evelyn. "Tell me, Ms. Blake - did they hand you that director position or did you have to blackmail someone for it? Your lack of basic logic is astounding."

Cassandra's fists clenched, her face flushing crimson. "Or maybe this is your petty revenge for our past disagreements."

Evelyn's glacial stare made the other woman shift uncomfortably. "Do you honestly think I'd risk my company's reputation over something as trivial as you?"

"Enough!" Victor's roar silenced the room. He turned to Nathan. "What's your take on this?"

Nathan's gaze flickered to Evelyn for the briefest moment before his expression smoothed into neutrality. "Ms. Carter makes a valid point. Moreover, having worked closely with her, I can attest she's not one to mix personal grievances with business."

Evelyn's eyebrow arched. Was Nathan Sterling actually defending her?

Her momentary surprise quickly turned to suspicion.

"Mr. Sterling," Cassandra sneered, "perhaps she's changed since your divorce. Your certainty makes me wonder if you're covering for her."

Nathan's head snapped toward Cassandra with lethal precision. "Watch your mouth." The quiet menace in his voice made several board members stiffen.

Cassandra's face burned scarlet, but she wisely remained silent.

"We don't have time for finger-pointing," Victor interjected, running a hand through his graying hair. "Our encryption will be cracked within twelve hours at most."

The gravity of the situation settled over the room. The nanorobot technology represented Sterling Enterprises' entire R&D investment for the next fiscal year.

"I just checked the markets," a board member announced. "Our stock has plummeted fifteen percent in the past hour. The downward trend shows no signs of stopping."

"If that code gets cracked," another director added, "we might as well file for bankruptcy."

Panicked murmurs erupted around the table.

For Victor Langley to appear this distressed signaled catastrophic implications.

"The source code won't be breached." Evelyn's clear voice cut through the chaos.

Every head turned toward her.

Cassandra's lips twitched before she schooled her features into concern. "What fantasy world are you living in, Ms. Carter? The dark web hackers targeting us are global elites."

+15 BONUS

Evelyn leaned forward, her emerald eyes flashing with quiet confidence. "Then it's fortunate I don't play by their rules."
###Chapter 88 Elliot Arrives

Victor Langley shared Evelyn Carter's skepticism. "You can't be serious, Ms. Kingsley. By the time we finish this conversation, some hacker might have already breached our system."

"Trust me. That's impossible." Evelyn leaned back with effortless confidence, murmuring to Maxwell Donovan, "Has he arrived yet?"

"Ten minutes out," Maxwell confirmed.

A self-assured smile played on Evelyn's lips. "Everyone, come downstairs with me. There's someone you need to meet."

The board members exchanged bewildered glances, some even suspecting this was some elaborate joke.

"Is she really making us all go downstairs during a crisis?"

"Doesn't she grasp the severity of the situation?"

"This is absurd!"

Evelyn ignored the murmurs. Standing gracefully, she addressed the room. "Your choice. Don't say I didn't warn you."

Nathan Sterling abruptly rose. "I'm coming with you."

Though Victor Langley hesitated, as a major shareholder, he had no choice but to follow.

With the CEO leading the way, the remaining directors fell in line behind them.

Evelyn stood at the forefront of the corporate procession, her team fidgeting impatiently behind her.

A yellow taxi pulled up to the curb.

Confusion rippled through the crowd. They'd expected limousines, private jets - not a cab.

Then emerged a striking six-foot-two figure in understated athleisure wear, his effortless elegance belying his technical genius.

"You made it!" The moment Elliot Kingsley stepped out, Evelyn sprinted forward and threw her arms around him.

She whispered urgently in his ear, "I'm banking on you, big brother."

"Already handled in the cab." His voice remained calm. "Took care of it en route."

Evelyn beamed, linking arms with him. "I knew you wouldn't let me down."

"Flattery won't get you everywhere." He affectionately ruffled her hair.

Elliot - cybersecurity expert for the National Cyber Defense Agency, the legendary hacker "AK" who topped every dark web ranking.

Anticipating trouble, Evelyn had secretly recruited him three months ago to safeguard Kingsley Industries' systems.

She hadn't expected the attack to come so soon. Clearly, she'd underestimated their adversary.

The reckless actions of Sterling Enterprises' general manager had everyone regretting their decision to follow her downstairs.

"Let me introduce our cybersecurity architect. He's already scrubbed our source code from the dark web." Evelyn guided Elliot inside, leaving a murmuring crowd in their wake.

"Resolved already? Impossible!"

"Who is that man? Has anyone seen him before?"

Nathan watched their retreating figures with an unreadable expression.

Who was this stranger sharing such easy intimacy with his wife in front of everyone?

Back in the conference room, Victor Langley verified the system status. Just as Evelyn had promised.

He exhaled sharply in relief.

"Thank God it's contained."

Taking a steadying sip of water, he studied Elliot typing rapidly. "What should we call you, Mr...?"

"Double-Oh-Seven."

Victor blinked at the unconventional alias before rationalizing that top cybersecurity experts often worked under pseudonyms.

Evelyn shot her brother an exasperated look. "Forgive the code name. My colleague enjoys his...quirks."

She made a face at Elliot, who remained impassive.

He'd interrupted his vacation for this emergency, so anonymity was non-negotiable.

But did he have to choose something so ridiculous? Only her eccentric brother would...

"You anticipated this breach, Ms. Kingsley. Impressive foresight."

Evelyn nodded. "Standard contingency planning. I accounted for corporate espionage risks."

"Now that the immediate threat is neutralized..." She turned with deliberate slowness, eyes glinting. "...it's time we identify our mole."
###Chapter 89 Operation Firewall Activated

Evelyn Carter's lips curled into a knowing smile as she locked eyes with Nicole Pate. "Care to confirm my suspicions, Ms. Pate?"

Nicole's fingers twitched against the conference table. "You're absolutely correct, Ms. Carter."

The sapphire ring on Evelyn's finger caught the light as she leaned forward. "Then explain why you disappeared during the security breach."

"Me?" Nicole's laugh sounded brittle. "Bathroom emergency. Surely even executives have biological needs?"

"Funny." Evelyn accepted a tablet from Maxwell Donovan and slid it across the polished surface. "Because our firewall logs show your device transmitting data to offshore accounts during that 'bathroom break.'"

Victor Langley snatched the tablet, his expression darkening with each swipe. "Explain this, Nicole."

Nicole's throat worked visibly. The damning evidence glowed onscreen - timestamps matching her absence, encrypted transfers to shell companies buying Sterling Enterprises stock.

Evelyn tapped a manicured nail against the glass table. "Let me reconstruct your play. First, you leaked the AI algorithm specs after Kingsley Industries shared them."

"Then," she continued, watching Nicole's pupils dilate, "you triggered the sell-off panic by shorting our stocks through third parties."

Maxwell crossed his arms. "We've traced the digital breadcrumbs. Every byte points to you."

Nicole's chair screeched as she stood abruptly. "I was protecting company interests! If outsiders acquired controlling shares—"

"Save it." Nathan Sterling's voice cut through like Arctic wind. He'd been silent until now, observing from the head of the table. "We have termination paperwork ready."

Evelyn admired how Nathan's presence commanded the room. Their gazes met - an unspoken alliance forged in corporate warfare.

"Consider our partnership," Evelyn said sweetly to Victor, "contingent on removing this... liability."

Nathan's tablet pinged with a new alert. "My board agrees. We're suspending all joint ventures pending internal audits."

The other directors shifted uncomfortably. Victor's jaw worked before he delivered the killing blow. "Effective immediately, you're terminated. Our legal team will handle the securities fraud charges."

Nicole collapsed into her chair, makeup streaking as reality set in.

Evelyn rose gracefully, pausing beside Elliot Kingsley - her genius hacker brother whose fingers still flew across a holographic keyboard. "Wrap it up, Code Phantom."

Elliot smirked, executing one final command that made Nicole's personal devices chime simultaneously across the room. "Just ensuring no data escapes."

As they exited, Evelyn heard Victor murmur to his CFO, "Since when does Evelyn Carter have a human side?"

She hid a smile. If only they knew about the midnight coding sessions with Elliot, or how she'd personally designed the honeypot that ensnared Nicole.

The game was far from over. But today's victory?

Absolutely delicious.
###Chapter 90 He's Impotent

"That's none of your concern," Nathan said icily.

"My situation has been resolved, though not without sacrifices." Victor Langley offered Nathan a bottle of water. "What about you? Rumor has it you're about to—"

"I haven't made a decision yet."

Nathan shoved the bottle away and walked off without another word.

On the drive back, Elliot suddenly asked, "Was that Nathan Sterling defending you earlier?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "He wasn't defending me. He's an investor in the project too."

"Well, he's decent-looking. But since he has no interest in women, he's not right for you. Good thing you divorced him." He nodded approvingly.

Evelyn nearly groaned. His mouth is truly something else.

"You're absolutely right. That's exactly why I left him."

When she had married Nathan years ago, Elliot had been overseas, tied down by obligations that kept him from returning.

To vet Nathan's character, Elliot had discreetly hacked into his private files and combed through everything. To his shock, he'd found... nothing. No scandals, no affairs—just an unsettling absence of any romantic history.

At the time, Elliot had concluded Nathan was impotent. He'd emailed his findings to Evelyn, who promptly deleted them without a second thought.

Now, reflecting on their three-year, passionless marriage, Evelyn couldn't help but wonder.

Yet somehow, Nathan had managed to father a child with Isabella. That was a mystery worth unraveling.

"Why did you come back alone this time, Elliot? Where's my sister-in-law?"

"She's either still in my dreams or hasn't been born yet. Either way... I haven't met her," Elliot replied with infuriating calm.

"I don't care. Find her soon. With that personality of yours, you'll die alone."

Evelyn shook his shoulder, making him chuckle.

Her eldest brother, Dominic, was too much like their father—stern and unyielding. Julian, the youngest, was reckless, always chasing adrenaline.

But Elliot? He was different. Quiet, calculating, the only one who ever truly listened to her wildest ideas.

Evelyn had Maxwell drive her back to the office first before sending him to drop Elliot off at Julian's place—just to stir up some chaos.

Sure enough, within minutes of settling at her desk, her phone buzzed.

"Evie! Unbelievable. Elliot dismantled my smart humidifier and turned it into a damn coffee machine." Julian's voice crackled with indignation. "Come get me. I'd rather be anywhere than trapped here with a walking computer."

Evelyn laughed. "Play nice, both of you."

Julian hung up with a huff.

Hours later, when Evelyn finally looked up from her work, it was past 11 PM.

She stepped out to find Maxwell still waiting. They left the building together.

The streets were quiet until they reached a dimly lit intersection.

The light turned green.

Maxwell eased the car forward—

Then, out of nowhere, a swarm of armed men surged toward them.

Blades glinted under the streetlights. They surrounded the car, slamming fists against the windows.

"Call the police, Ms. Carter. Stay inside. I'll handle this."

Maxwell's voice shook. For all his competence as an assistant, he'd never faced anything like this.

He reached for the door—

Evelyn's hand clamped down on his shoulder. "You stepping out won't help. They're here for me." Her voice was steel. "Stay put. I'll protect you."

Maxwell met her gaze in the rearview mirror.

The fear in his chest dissolved.

Outside, the thugs roared, battering the car.

Then—

A stiletto heel shot out like a bullet.

The rear door flew open.

A man went airborne, crashing into the bushes ten feet away.

Silence.

Every head swiveled toward the tattooed figure lighting a cigarette nearby.

"Boss... You said this was some fragile socialite. Nobody mentioned she'd bring a damn bodyguard."
###Chapter 91 Subdued the Goons in Record Time

Evelyn pushed open the car door and stepped onto the pavement.

"My muscles could use some exercise." Her sharp gaze swept across the gang of armed men. "All at once or taking turns?"

The knife-wielding thugs exchanged glances, sizing up their unconscious comrade in the bushes before peering into the vehicle.

Seeing only one opponent, their tension visibly eased.

The ringleader, a tattooed brute with a cigarette dangling from his lips, swaggered forward.

"Numbers don't lie, sweetheart. Hand over the signet ring and we'll make this painless."

Evelyn's lips curled. "Alistair's lackeys, I presume?"

"Shut your mouth and give us the damn ring!" he snarled.

In a blur of motion, Evelyn snatched the cigarette and stamped it out on his forehead.

A spinning kick sent him crashing to the pavement.

"Seems you're the chatty one," she remarked coolly. "You first."

"Bitch broke my teeth!" The tattooed man spat blood as he scrambled up. "Get her!"

The gang surged forward - only to be systematically dismantled.

Within eight minutes, the street resembled a battlefield of groaning bodies.

Evelyn towered over their leader. "You call this leadership?"

"Technically... yeah."

"Funny. You sounded tougher five minutes ago."

Her boot connected with his ribs. "Pair up and march yourselves to the precinct."

"Come on, lady! We swear we'll never—"

"Option one: die here. Option two: jail." Her glacial stare left no room for negotiation. "Choose."

"We're going! We're moving!" The thugs hastily bound each other, terrified she might reconsider.

Satisfied, Evelyn slid back into the car. "Drive, Maxwell."

Her assistant's usually composed face betrayed undisguised awe before professionalism reasserted itself.

"Right away, Ms. Carter."

En route to Kingsley Estate, Maxwell voiced his concern. "Should we inform Mr. Sterling about this incident?"

"Unnecessary. Amateur hour." Evelyn examined her nails. "With Alistair's precious heirloom in my possession, he won't risk escalation."

"Understood."

"Actually, help me locate that ring when we get back."

She frowned in recollection. "After winning it, I believe I tossed it in a red velvet pouch. Probably in one of the garage trunks."

Maxwell nearly swerved off-road.

Only after being ambushed did she remember the artifact? And storing a seven-figure antique in a random pouch?

Truly... remarkable.

Upon arrival, Evelyn discovered Dominic and Elliot video-calling their grandfather in Darai.

The screen showed Leonard Kingsley - true patriarch of Kingsley Industries - looking markedly improved in his hospital bed.

"Grandfather! You're awake!" Evelyn nearly collided with the monitor, eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "This is all my fault—"

"Nonsense, child." His voice, though aged, carried its familiar strength. "Let me see you properly."

Evelyn dashed away tears. "I'm booking the next flight to Darai."

"Doctor says I'll be dancing at my seventieth birthday." Leonard's eyes crinkled. "Speaking of which, you'd better be there, young lady."

Julian pouted. "Why's Evelyn the only one getting a personal invitation?"

Leonard's expression darkened. "Need I remind you of that concert debacle? Your sister endured public humiliation because of your thoughtless remarks!"

"I got carried away in the moment," Julian mumbled, properly chastised.
###Chapter 92 Cut Your Losses

The tension in the air was palpable.

Dominic, ever the peacemaker, turned to Julian with a pointed question. "Even if Grandpa hadn't summoned you, would you have dared not to show up?"

Julian kept his head low, chastened. "Of course not. It's Grandpa's birthday. I wouldn't miss it for the world."

Evelyn stifled a laugh. Only Dominic and Leonard had this effect on Julian.

By now, Leonard's anger had cooled.

"Support Evelyn well in the nanorobotics project," he instructed Elliot.

"Oh, Grandpa, you don't need to remind Elliot. He'll give it his all," Evelyn said with a smile, wrapping an arm around each of her brothers.

Elliot responded with a casual shrug. "Naturally."

Seeing Evelyn so committed to her work, Leonard felt a swell of pride.

"Grandpa needs his rest. We'll talk another time," Dominic said.

The call ended, leaving the room in silence.

Meanwhile, in the Delaney mansion, Alistair lounged in his study, sipping tea as he awaited good news.

Absentmindedly, he rubbed his thumb—only to remember his missing diamond ring.

His mood darkened, but the thought of reclaiming it soon had him humming again.

His butler, Walter, had been standing motionless for some time. When the men he'd sent out failed to report back, he discreetly stepped away to make a call.

After multiple attempts, someone finally picked up.

"Well? What's taking so long? Do you have the ring or not?" Walter demanded.

"This is the police. We've been looking for you. Come down to the station immediately," came the curt reply.

Walter's face paled. He dropped the phone and rushed back to Alistair.

"Sir, we have a problem. The men we sent—they've been arrested. The police want you to come in."

Alistair's teacup shattered against the wall, followed by the teapot.

He couldn't believe it. A woman who'd clawed her way up using men had the audacity to humiliate him? No one had ever dared.

"Summon every executive from the entertainment companies. I want her name dragged through the mud across Pamore!"

At that exact moment, Nathan Sterling arrived at the Delaney estate.

Isabella was due for a prenatal checkup. After escorting her inside, he'd intended to leave—until he spotted a gathering of familiar faces in the courtyard.

Approaching quietly, he overheard Alistair's orders.

"The information I'm providing is enough to fill headlines for weeks. None of it goes to print without my approval."

Alistair's voice turned icy. "Cross me, and you're declaring war on the Delaneys. You know what that means."

Nathan retreated swiftly to his car and dialed Evelyn.

The first call went unanswered.

He tried again, and this time, she picked up.

"Yes, Mr. Sterling?"

"Listen carefully. Return Alistair's ring. Now."

Evelyn's tone was glacial. "That's none of your concern."

"Why provoke him?" Nathan's patience frayed. She never listened.

A dry laugh escaped her. "You and I both know who started this, Nathan."

Isabella had struck first. Evelyn was merely retaliating.

"He's rallied the entire media against you. Is this really worth it over a ring?"

"Just a ring?" Her voice dripped with disdain.

"Cut your losses, Evelyn." Nathan's words were sharp. "Same deal as before. I'll cover the costs."

"Not happening."

His frown deepened. "You're picking a fight you can't win. Over what?"

"Because to you and Alistair, I'm just some woman who slept her way to the top." Her voice turned razor-sharp. "In your eyes, my dignity isn't worth the dirt beneath your shoes. All that matters is whether you get what you want."

A pause. Then, quieter: "If I didn't have this ring, would you even be talking to me right now?"

Nathan fell silent. She'd hit the mark.

Had she still been his wife, he'd have ordered her to surrender it.

Without it, he might have stood back and watched her burn.
###Chapter 93 The Fallout

"Am I wrong?" Evelyn's sardonic tone cut through the phone line.

Nathan remained unrepentant. "You're in no position to challenge Alistair yet. This is for your protection."

"Spare me the false concern and let him come at me!"

The call ended abruptly. Nathan glared at the darkened screen, his jaw tightening with barely contained fury.

"That foolish woman!" he muttered. "Let's see how she handles this mess!"

His assistant interrupted from the front seat. "Mr. Sterling, Simon just messaged. There's an urgent situation with the Frenda project requiring your immediate presence."

Nathan pinched the bridge of his nose. "Book the earliest flight."

The Frenda venture was critical - important enough that he'd entrusted Simon with oversight.

Lately, Nathan had been drowning in corporate affairs, feeling Evelyn's absence more acutely than he'd anticipated. Perhaps letting her face consequences would be instructive. When she hit rock bottom, he'd extend a hand. Then she'd return to Sterling Enterprises without resistance.

Meanwhile, Evelyn turned from the call to find Elliot restraining Julian, preventing his interference. Once the line disconnected, Elliot finally released him.

"Why'd you stop me? I wanted to tear into that bastard!" Julian protested.

"Looking for another broken arm?" Elliot's quiet warning made Julian instantly back down.

The tense exchange lifted Evelyn's spirits despite the earlier confrontation.

How could she feel alone with such loyal support? Her family was her foundation.

She chuckled. "Easy, Elliot. Julian's still healing."

"Exactly! Since when do you manhandle your baby brother? I'm telling Dominic and Grandpa!" Julian seized on Evelyn's defense.

"I didn't touch your injury." Elliot settled into a chair. "If necessary, I'll summon the family physician. My treat."

Julian turned pleading eyes to Evelyn. "Back me up here!"

Evelyn made a strategic retreat upstairs. "Early night for me. Big day tomorrow."

Dawn brought Olivia's frantic call. "Eve! The internet's imploding!"

Evelyn sighed. "Let me guess - public execution by hashtag?"

"Execution? They're burning you at the stake! Natalie tried removing posts but it's like playing whack-a-mole with comments!"

Checking social media confirmed her fears. #EvelynTheHomewrecker and #EvelynTheBully dominated trends.

A viral post accused her of cheating on Nathan with Harrison Whitmore to secure her Kingsley Industries position.

"Proof" included:

A photo of Julian driving her home pre-divorce
A coffee meeting with Dominic in Darai
A blurred "school bullying" video captioned: "We didn't need hidden cameras for this monster"
The internet erupted:
"Knew she was trash!"
"How dare she cheat on Nathan Sterling!"
"Harrison Whitmore deserves better!"
"Bullies never change!"
"DIG DEEPER!"

Kingsley Industries' stocks plummeted 10% as investors panicked.

Julian and Elliot burst into her room.

"Eve..." Julian gently smoothed her hair.

"I'm sorry for dragging you into this," Evelyn whispered.

"Please, my fans know better than to believe tabloid trash," he scoffed.

Elliot remained pragmatic. "I can scrub this, but large-scale deletion may trigger cybersecurity scrutiny."

"No," Evelyn refused. "This is coordinated. Remove one post, ten more appear."

Was this Alistair's retaliation Nathan warned about? The scale was unprecedented.

"Dominic's catching the first flight back," Elliot reported. "He wants you homebound until this blows over. Maxwell will handle company damage control."
###Chapter 94 The Moment of Truth

"Absolutely not. I need to stand tall now more than ever. The world won't see me cower."

They expected her to crumble under the weight of their accusations, but surrender wasn't in Evelyn Carter's vocabulary.

She threw off the silk sheets and strode to the ensuite, splashing cold water on her face. The reflection staring back was steel wrapped in satin—unbreakable.

Over at Kingsley Industries, the media circus had descended. Reporters from every major outlet jostled for position outside the glass towers.

The growl of an engine cut through the chaos as a crimson Porsche 911 pulled up.

Inside, Maxwell Donovan adjusted the rearview mirror. "Ms. Carter, perhaps some sunglasses? The paparazzi flashbulbs might—"

"Let them shoot." Evelyn's lips curved as she reapplied her signature red lipstick. The mirror caught the dangerous glint in her hazel eyes. "I want every lens to capture how little their words affect me."

Maxwell exited first, signaling the security detail. Black-suited guards formed a barricade as cameras exploded like fireworks.

When Evelyn emerged, the crowd inhaled sharply. Her emerald-green Valentino gown caught the morning light, each hand-sewn crystal reflecting her defiance. The whispers began instantly—how could someone embroiled in scandal look so utterly victorious?

"Evelyn! Does Nathan Sterling know about your affairs?"

"Who else did you sleep with during your marriage?"

"Care to comment on the bullying allegations?"

A projectile whizzed through the air—a half-empty coffee cup aimed at Evelyn's head. A tanned hand intercepted it mid-flight, splashing caramel macchiato across Italian leather shoes.

Dominic Kingsley's voice turned arctic. "Find that person. Now."

Evelyn's breath hitched as her eldest brother materialized beside her. She threaded her arm through his, drawing strength from his presence. Of course he'd come. The Kingsleys always protected their own.

The reporters turned rabid.

"Mr. Kingsley! Will your family still accept her after this?"

"Does Leonard Kingsley approve of his granddaughter's behavior?"

Dominic's jaw tightened. He propelled Evelyn through the revolving doors, his silence more terrifying than any outburst.

In the executive suite's sanctuary, he handed her a steaming mug. "You were supposed to stay home."

Evelyn's laugh sparkled like champagne. "And let them think I'm hiding? Never."

Her brother flicked her forehead affectionately. "Stubborn as always." He grew serious. "Grandfather's announcing your true identity at his gala. The world will finally know you're a Kingsley."

Memories surfaced—boarding school under an alias, art galleries where no one knew her lineage. The carefully constructed anonymity ending in three days.

"Ready to claim your birthright?" Dominic searched her face.

Evelyn squared her shoulders. "Born ready."

"Good. Pack for Darai. We leave after the—"

Her phone chimed. A message lit up the screen:

Calico, we made it to Pamore. Can you meet us?

Evelyn's heart swelled. These were her scholarship kids—the ones she'd mentored in secret. Against all odds, they'd kept their promise.

Her fingers flew across the screen: Name the place.

The game wasn't over yet. It was just beginning.
###Chapter 95 Calico

"Let's meet at the entrance of Kingsley University?"

Evelyn suddenly remembered she shouldn't be making public appearances these days.

"Where are you? I'll arrange a car to pick you up."

An hour later, reporters still swarmed Sterling Enterprises' headquarters, hoping to catch Evelyn's appearance for more sensational footage.

Just then, a sleek black sedan pulled up. Three bright-eyed teenagers stepped out.

Sharp-eyed journalists immediately recognized the girl leading them - this year's SAT top scorer from Pamore, Clara Bennett.

The two boys following her were equally impressive -

Owen Carter, who aced the science division, and Ryan Foster, recipient of the National Writing Award.

All three bore faint surgical scars on their upper lips - remnants of cleft palate surgeries from their childhood.

With SAT results freshly released in June, these academic achievers became instant media darlings alongside celebrity gossip.

Cameras and microphones instantly surrounded Clara and her companions.

"Congratulations Clara, Owen, and Ryan on your stellar achievements and admission to Kingsley University!"

Typically, children with facial differences might shy away from cameras. But these three stood tall, smiling confidently as they responded, "Thank you."

"You've all risen from the most impoverished mountain regions to attend our nation's most prestigious university. Could you share your secret to success?"

"We had an angel named Calico."

"She funded our education and arranged life-changing surgeries for hundreds of cleft palate children in our hometown."

"She's been our guiding star."

Though reporters thrived on sensational celebrity scandals, they maintained professional decorum when interviewing the country's brightest young minds.

Their research had revealed these students' heartbreaking backgrounds - orphaned children from remote mountain villages where poor prenatal care led to high rates of birth defects.

Then Calico appeared, funding corrective surgeries for nearly a thousand affected children and sponsoring their education to escape poverty.

"Could you tell us who Calico is? We'd love to interview her."

Journalists worldwide had been searching for this mysterious benefactor.

Clara and her friends shook their heads. "We've never met her. Our communication was only through text messages. But today, we're finally meeting her in person."

At that moment, their escort led them into Sterling Enterprises' towering headquarters.

The reporters gasped collectively.

"Does this mean Calico works at Sterling Enterprises?"

"Of course! Such a generous soul must be a high-ranking executive."

"That makes perfect sense. We can't leave now."

"Absolutely! We must wait for these students to come out!"

Inside the building, Clara's group followed the suited man to the penthouse.

When they saw Evelyn, all three froze in shock.

Seeing their stunned expressions, Evelyn rose gracefully, opening her arms. "Hello darlings, I'm Evelyn Carter. It's wonderful to finally meet you."

"You're Calico!"

Owen was first to recover. The realization that their anonymous benefactor was this elegant, poised woman left him breathless.

"She's even more beautiful than I imagined," Clara whispered in awe.

"Exactly like the angel in my dreams," Ryan beamed.

Though hesitant at first, the teenagers melted when Evelyn embraced them warmly. "You've made me so incredibly proud!"

Her words unlocked a floodgate of emotions. Remembering their struggles to keep their promise, tears spilled freely.

"We did it, Evelyn."

"Those exams were brutal, but your messages kept me going."

"Thank you...for everything."

Evelyn gently patted their heads. "I knew you could do it. You're all extraordinary."

Suddenly, Clara's expression darkened. "Evelyn...are you really that person everyone's criticizing online?"
###Chapter 96 His Priorities Have Shifted

Evelyn flashed a bright smile. "That's right, it's me."

"How dare they slander you like this? I'm going down there to set them straight!" Ryan was clearly the most impulsive of the three.

"I'm coming with you!"

"Count me in!"

"There's no need." Evelyn chuckled at their protective instincts. "The truth always surfaces eventually."

She added softly, "What matters is that the people I care about know the real me."

She then shifted the conversation, asking detailed questions about their university enrollment needs and requirements.

With practiced efficiency, she confirmed the living allowance transfers to their accounts and reminded them to be responsible with their finances.

A final warning about keeping her Calico identity secret preceded her arranging their discreet exit through the secured underground parking.

As the security team escorted the students away, her phone buzzed with Adrian's call.

His recent string of business trips—all orchestrated by Evelyn—had left him feeling guilty enough to comply without complaint.

Through the phone, he first unleashed colorful curses at the unethical media, then offered heartfelt reassurances before finally expressing his longing to return home.

Evelyn cleared her throat, amusement coloring her voice as she granted permission.

She instructed him to head straight to Darai after concluding his Mardovia meetings for her grandfather's upcoming birthday celebration.

The call ended with Adrian's cheerful goodbye.

The office door swung open to reveal Dominic's concerned expression softening at the sight of her smile. "There's some boardroom turbulence. I'd planned to stay longer but—"

His sentence hung unfinished as he checked his watch. "I need to leave today."

"Elliot will accompany me back, so Julian can keep you company."

Evelyn propped her chin on her palm, feigning exasperation. "Julian's energy is exhausting."

Dominic's lips quirked. "Exactly why you won't have time to brood."

"Fine. Safe travels to you both."

She suspected the stock fluctuations demanded his attention and didn't press further.

Meanwhile, Nathan worried Evelyn might decline lunch invitations, so he'd arranged for a Michelin chef to prepare a private meal at Kingsley Industries.

Her hearty appetite during the meal eased his concerns.

Dominic's parting instruction to Maxwell had been explicit: monitor Evelyn's mood and ensure her happiness.

That afternoon's video conference with Langley Corporation confirmed the joint venture remained unaffected by recent events.

After finalizing upcoming arrangements, Evelyn decided to wrap up early.

Tight security measures were in place—human barricades at every entrance, preventing any repeat of the morning's chaos.

A crimson Porsche sat at the center of a four-vehicle security convoy when Evelyn departed.

Her graceful exit left the assembled reporters in confused silence.

"This wasn't the script! Sterling was supposed to publicly humiliate her!"

"Since when did he start treating her like royalty?"

"The woman's clearly manipulative."

"Do we wait or leave?"

"We still haven't spotted Calico!"

"Let's stake out those three students then."

The Sterling estate's private mountain perimeter now resembled a military compound, with security so thorough even insects couldn't penetrate undetected.

Julian was waiting with slippers in hand when Evelyn entered, the pop idol kneeling to assist her like an attentive butler.

The amused glint in Evelyn's eyes suggested she'd anticipated Dominic's stern warnings. "Someone's being unusually attentive today."

Julian rolled his eyes. "Dominic's threats were very... persuasive."

Post-dinner found Evelyn sprawled on the sofa, staring blankly at the ceiling.

"Julian, I'm dying of boredom!"

"Outings are off-limits, so let's find indoor entertainment."

Evelyn sprang up, eyes alight with mischief. "Gaming marathon!"

"Now you're speaking my language!"

The siblings migrated to the mansion's state-of-the-art gaming suite.

Cutting-edge systems awaited them as they launched into "Legends of Triumph," the global phenomenon boasting 800 million registered users.

Two humiliating defeats later, Evelyn slumped in her ergonomic chair. "We're embarrassingly bad at this."

Julian was already reaching for his phone. "Time to call in reinforcements."
###Chapter 97 The Dragon Is Mine

Julian made an overseas call. "Get the entire team online for 'Legends of Glory' with my sister right now."

Then he handed Evelyn a perfectly crafted cocktail. "Give it a minute. They'll log in soon."

Evelyn curled up in her gaming chair, sipping her drink lazily.

Across the ocean in Galloria, dawn hadn't even broken.

Patrick Sullivan, manager of the EDF Esports Club, jolted awake from the call.

He sprinted down the hallway, banging on his players' doors like a madman.

Within three minutes, bleary-eyed team members shuffled out wrapped in blankets, yawning.

"Patrick, it's 3 AM! Since when do we do midnight training sessions?"

Rubbing his tired eyes, Patrick forced himself alert.

"Listen up! The boss just called."

That instantly woke everyone up.

Their mysterious benefactor poured 300 million into their team quarterly, with massive bonuses for tournament wins.

After EDF's recent global championship victory, he'd rewarded them with a staggering billion-dollar bonus.

The money hit harder than the trophy ever could.

"Thirty seconds to log in! We're helping the boss's sister crush some noobs tonight!"

Players scrambled to their stations like their lives depended on it.

Once ready, Patrick called Julian back. The singer replied casually, "Just make sure they prioritize my sister's gaming experience."

"Absolutely."

After hanging up, Julian told Evelyn to log in.

The match began with four elite players strategically positioning themselves around Evelyn.

In fifteen brutal minutes, Evelyn landed the final blow, annihilating the enemy base before they could counterattack.

The opposing team erupted in chat.

"What the hell? Who ARE you people?"

"We've dominated regional leagues for years! This is humiliating!"

"Delete that! You're making it worse!"

Too lazy to type, Evelyn activated her mic with a smirk. "Payback's sweet. You shouldn't have targeted me last game."

"It IS 'The Dragon is Mine'! I knew she was a girl!"

"Why's there a weak link among these pros?"

Evelyn scoffed. "So what if I'm weak? My teammates carry just fine!"

Her pro teammates stayed silent. World champions stomping amateurs? Beyond embarrassing.

Then they noticed their accounts.

In their sleepy haste, they'd forgotten to switch from their official championship IDs.

The enemy team caught on fast.

"Wait...are those EDF's actual player IDs?"

"Holy shit! It's the whole championship roster!"

"Someone pinch me! Am I dreaming?"

The chat exploded into chaos, voices screaming through headsets.

Evelyn winced at the noise. "Thanks guys," she told her four champions before logging off.

They disconnected like their reputations depended on it.

Just then, their phones chimed with transfer notifications: $100 million deposited per account.

Tearing off headsets, they cheered. Best payday ever for bullying amateurs!

Meanwhile, other EDF members clamored for their turn.

"When's the boss's sister playing again?"

"One game and she's done?!"

"$100M for fifteen minutes? Sign me up!"

That night birthed Legends of Glory's most enduring mystery - 'The Dragon is Mine' and her team of champion bodyguards.

At every tournament thereafter, reporters hounded EDF about the mysterious girl. But the players kept their lips sealed tighter than vaults.
###Chapter 98: The Second Crash

Julian casually directed Patrick, "Tell them to concentrate on the championship and remember the prize money awaits."

He ended the call with a tap.

"Since when did you invest in an esports team, Julian?" Evelyn inquired, swirling her martini glass.

"Ever since I kept losing every single game," he admitted with a chuckle. "My teammates mocked me relentlessly. So out of sheer spite, I dropped two billion dollars to build my own dream team."

Leaning back in his ergonomic gaming chair, he added, "I refuse to believe money can't buy raw talent."

With a playful grin, he spun the chair toward her. "Consider this team yours from today onward. My gift to you."

"Well, aren't you generous?" Evelyn winked, clinking her glass against his.

Her phone buzzed with an unknown caller. She dismissed it instantly. The persistent caller tried again.

"Hello?"

"Evelyn, you know exactly who I am now." Alistair's voice dripped with condescension. "Return my diamond signet ring and publicly apologize to Isabella."

His tone turned mocking. "By the way, how does it feel being internet fodder?"

Evelyn's lips curled. "Is this really your best move?"

She continued, voice laced with amusement, "For someone who's ruled the corporate world for thirty years, I expected more creativity."

"All I see are cheap tricks."

"Rigged casino games, hired thugs, smear campaigns... You're nothing but a small-time gangster with a fancy title. Is this the fearsome Delaney patriarch?"

Alistair's laugh was icy. "My methods may be simple, but they'll ensure you never work in Kingsley Industries again."

"Here's your final chance. Return my ring, and perhaps I'll tell the press to go easy on you. Keep defying me, and—"

He left the threat hanging.

"What exactly will you do?" Evelyn challenged.

"In three days, Leonard Kingsley celebrates his seventieth birthday."

"Dominic might tolerate your scandals, but do you think his grandfather will? When I expose you at that party, let's see how long you keep that GM title."

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud. "Please do. I'll be front row waiting."

Her grandfather wouldn't spare a glance at some provincial businessman, much less entertain his nonsense.

"Mark my words!" Alistair spat.

"Wait," Evelyn interrupted. "This is your only warning."

"Make Isabella confess everything, and I might let you crawl away with some dignity."

"Over my dead body!"

The line went dead with a crash.

Julian shook his head. "The man's ego is his own worst enemy. Time to teach him humility, Evie."

"That ring deserves a better owner anyway." Her smile turned razor-sharp.

Days later at Darai International, emergency sirens wailed.

Wrapped in a thermal blanket, Evelyn couldn't stop trembling despite the tropical heat. Her gaze fixed on the wreckage—a commercial airliner torn apart by flames, rescue crews swarming like ants.

She'd survived her second plane crash.

At 60,000 feet, Engine Two had exploded. The pilots managed an emergency descent until—thirty feet from touchdown—hydraulics failed. The impact had been brutal.

In the terminal, Evelyn clenched her fists. Breathe. Just breathe. At least she'd walked away.

#15 BONUS

Disasters had a way of reducing humans to insignificance.

Paramedics rushed past with stretchers. Walkie-talkies crackled with updates:

"—still missing twelve passengers—"

"—fire spreading to Section C—"

"—need medevac now for critical injuries—"

The déjà vu was overwhelming.
###Chapter 99 I'm Here

The first plane crash had shattered Evelyn's illusions about Nathan and their marriage. It left her heartbroken, realizing that giving more would only lead to more pain.

Now, during this second accident, she found herself completely alone.

Tears blurred Evelyn's vision as she stared at the cracked screen of her phone.

Outside, the storm howled as a sleek black helicopter descended. A commanding figure in a tailored suit emerged, his presence radiating power.

The moment his polished shoes touched the tarmac, his piercing gaze locked onto his target. He moved with purpose through the chaos.

The helicopter's arrival caused a stir among the rescued passengers. Whispers spread like wildfire.

"Is that Harrison Whitmore? Who's he here for?"

Evelyn kept her head down, but the comment made fresh tears spill over her cheeks.

Everyone had someone coming for them. Everyone except her.

Suddenly, the chatter died down. The only sound was the steady rhythm of approaching footsteps.

Against her better judgment, Evelyn looked up.

Backlit by the helicopter's searchlights, the man walked past rows of hopeful faces, coming straight toward her.

Her vision swam with tears, but the silhouette looked hauntingly familiar. When he was just steps away, her lips formed a name without thinking.

"Harrison?"

He stopped before her, his warm hands cradling her face. His thumb brushed away her tears with surprising tenderness.

"I've got you, Evelyn."

His deep voice instantly soothed the storm inside her. His firm grip on her hand anchored her to reality.

Blinking away tears, she studied him properly. Chiseled jaw, intense eyes - every inch the powerful CEO.

She'd believed herself abandoned, yet her knight had come after all.

Around them, excited whispers erupted.

"That's Harrison Whitmore! I can't believe he's here!"

"A helicopter rescue? That's next level romance."

Amidst the flashing cameras and envious stares, Harrison swept Evelyn into his arms and carried her away.

The helicopter's rotors roared to life, kicking up a whirlwind before disappearing into the night sky.

They landed shortly at the Whitmore estate.

Harrison had the staff prepare a warm bath while the family doctor examined Evelyn. Only after receiving the all-clear did his shoulders relax.

Tucking her into bed, he murmured, "Get some rest."

Evelyn burrowed into the blankets obediently.

Then her eyes flew open. "Wait! I need to call Grandfather. My family must be-"

"Already know," Harrison interrupted, handing her a tablet.

The headline screamed: "WHITMORE'S DRAMATIC RESCUE - THE ROMANCE OF THE CENTURY!" Below it was a photo of Harrison carrying her, followed by gushing comments.

"OMG! This is straight out of a movie!"

"Even blurry, they look perfect together!"

"New relationship goals unlocked!"

"Someone get me a billionaire boyfriend!"

Harrison smoothed Evelyn's hair. "Don't worry about the press. I'll handle everything."

Comforted by his assurance, she closed her eyes again.

As Harrison quietly shut the bedroom door, Beatrice appeared, practically vibrating with excitement.

"Harrison! That was magnificent!"

"Mother, the media exaggerates. Don't read too much into it."

Beatrice waved him off. "Nonsense! Leonard and Evelyn's brothers are downstairs right now, demanding answers!"

Harrison sighed. His mother worked fast.
###Chapter 100 Get To Know Me

Leonard Kingsley and his three grandsons had been seated in the parlor for nearly an hour when the Whitmore family arrived.

The news broadcast had initially brought them relief, seeing their beloved Evelyn safe. But as the details sank in, questions began forming in their minds.

How had Harrison Whitmore and Evelyn already been portrayed as a couple across social media?

Julian Hartwell clenched his fists, regretting his decision to take an earlier flight to meet friends in Darai instead of accompanying his sister home.

Arthur Whitmore entered first, his arm linked with his wife Beatrice. "Harrison, greet Mr. Kingsley properly."

Harrison stepped forward with perfect posture. "Good evening, Mr. Kingsley."

Leonard adjusted his navy suit jacket. Though silver-haired, his piercing gaze remained sharp as ever.

Dominic Kingsley exchanged a brief nod with Harrison. As former classmates at Harvard, they shared mutual respect.

Elliot Kingsley studied Harrison analytically, already considering hacking into the Fulton servers for background checks.

Julian's glare could have melted steel. No one would take his sister away again.

"Evelyn is resting upstairs," Harrison informed them calmly.

"You don't get to call her that!" Julian's outburst earned a warning look from Leonard.

Turning to Harrison, Leonard demanded, "These media reports about you and my granddaughter - what exactly is happening?"

Beatrice clapped her hands excitedly. "We'd be delighted to welcome Evelyn into our family! The wedding arrangements should begin immediately."

"When Harrison heard about Evelyn's plane incident, he commandeered a helicopter to reach her," Arthur added proudly.

"I want to hear this from the young man himself," Leonard stated firmly.

The Kingsleys had come seeking answers. Harrison's presence at the chaotic airport despite his limited interactions with Evelyn raised questions.

Leonard's sharp eyes assessed the young CEO who'd built an empire before thirty. Even Dominic vouched for his character.

Perhaps Evelyn's failed marriage had been Leonard's oversight. But if Harrison had genuine feelings...

"We shouldn't rush this," Harrison said carefully.

Leonard arched an eyebrow. "Do you think my granddaughter isn't good enough because she's divorced? She has no shortage of suitors!"

"Harrison doesn't care about past relationships," Beatrice interjected, nudging her son forward.

Under the collective scrutiny, Harrison remained composed.

"I've admired Evelyn for years," he confessed. "Beneath her strength, she's still healing. She may only see me as a friend now. I ask that you give her time to know the real me."

Leonard's expression softened visibly.

Even Evelyn's protective brothers couldn't fault Harrison's sincerity. His respect for Evelyn's healing process contrasted sharply with Nathan Sterling's behavior.

Beatrice and Arthur exchanged proud smiles.

Outside the doorway, Evelyn pressed a hand to her chest. The self-pity she'd felt at the airport now seemed ridiculous.

Her entire family - and Harrison - only wanted her happiness. Why should she remain chained to the past?

With renewed determination, she returned to her room where a maid presented a new phone.

"Ms. Kingsley, you have a call."

Lying across her bed, Evelyn glanced at the screen and waved dismissively. "Block it."

Across the ocean in Frenda, Nathan Sterling stared at his phone's rejection notification.

"Simon!" he barked. "Give me your phone!"
###Chapter 101 The Grand Reveal

Nathan's calls went straight to voicemail.

Watching the news footage of Harrison carrying Evelyn in his arms, Nathan's grip tightened around his whiskey glass until his knuckles turned white.

Had she completely forgotten about their past?

With a violent sweep of his arm, he sent files scattering across his office floor, his expression thunderous.

"Mr. Sterling, Leonard Kingsley is hosting his 70th birthday gala at Skyview Tower this weekend."

"Shall I arrange our travel?" Simon inquired.

"Immediately!"

The penthouse of Skyview Tower glittered like a constellation that evening. The world's wealthiest man, Leonard Kingsley, spared no expense for his milestone celebration.

Every billionaire on the Forbes list had received an exclusive invitation.

All culinary ingredients had been flown in from Michelin-starred restaurants across Europe, prepared by celebrity chefs.

A Grammy-winning orchestra provided live entertainment, ensuring an unforgettable experience for the elite guests.

The trending hashtags #EvelynTheGoldDigger and #EvelynTheBully had finally begun fading from public memory.

Meanwhile, #FindCalico gained traction as netizens worldwide searched for the mysterious philanthropist.

Security resembled a presidential detail, given the concentration of power and wealth in attendance.

Celebrities whispered in awe at the Kingsley family's extravagance.

Rumors swirled about Leonard introducing his long-lost granddaughter tonight - the event's most anticipated moment.

Selected journalists prepped their equipment, honored to document this historic occasion.

Meanwhile, Evelyn sat before a vanity in the VIP suite.

Dominic had commissioned the most exclusive stylists in Monte Carlo, who presented racks of couture gowns.

"My sister must outshine every woman tonight," he'd instructed.

Her phone chimed with a message from Harrison: "Counting the minutes until your grand entrance, darling."

A secret smile played on her lips.

"What's got you grinning?" Olivia materialized behind her, peeking at the screen.

Evelyn quickly locked her phone, cheeks flushing. "Just nerves."

She and Harrison were still navigating their new relationship - best kept private for now.

Natalie and Sophia arrived together, champagne flutes in hand.

"The Darai squad reunites!" Olivia declared, distributing drinks.

"To watching our girl reclaim her throne tonight!" Natalie toasted.

Sophia smirked. "After this, no one will dare call you a social climber again."

"Damn right! Kingsley blood runs through these veins." Olivia linked arms with Evelyn.

Sophia drained her glass. "The gossip columns won't know what hit them."

Evelyn squeezed her friends' hands. "Couldn't do this without you."

The stylists presented an array of breathtaking designs with newfound deference.

"Miss Kingsley, when shall we begin your fitting?"

"Let my sisters choose first. They deserve to shine just as bright today."

The lead stylist bowed slightly. "Of course."

Olivia's expert eye landed on a blush pink chiffon masterpiece embroidered with thousands of micro-diamonds forming delicate floral patterns.

"This is the one," she declared.

A jewelry specialist produced a velvet case containing a breathtaking antique necklace. "This heirloom has been in the Kingsley collection for centuries."

Evelyn nodded. "We'll take both. I trust my girls' judgment."

Sophia examined the gems professionally. "Flawless clarity. These are museum-quality pieces."

Casually, she asked, "So...where's Julian tonight?"

"Elliot and Julian prefer intimate family dinners over these spectacles. We'll celebrate privately later."

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with sudden understanding - the first time Sophia had ever inquired about Julian voluntarily.

Exchanging knowing glances with Natalie and Olivia, they immediately began teasing their usually composed friend.
###Chapter 102 The Persistent Tattletale

The gala outside the VIP lounge continued without a hitch.

At the heart of the event, Leonard Kingsley and Dominic Kingsley held court, their commanding presence drawing a constant stream of well-wishers and business associates.

From across the room, Alistair Delaney approached with Isabella Delaney in tow, his steps measured and deliberate.

"Mr. Kingsley," Alistair greeted with forced politeness, his voice carefully modulated to show deference.

Leonard's smile didn't reach his eyes as he replied, "Mr. Delaney, I see you've finally clawed your way back into the Fortune 100 this year."

The barb landed precisely as intended.

Alistair's cheeks flushed slightly. "Barely scraping in at number 100, I'm afraid."

The power disparity between Delaney Enterprises and Kingsley Industries remained vast. It had taken every resource Alistair possessed to reach this precarious position.

"I understand you're introducing your granddaughter to society tonight," Leonard continued smoothly.

Alistair placed a proprietary hand on Isabella's shoulder. "My granddaughter is quite sociable. I'm sure she'd make excellent company for your Evelyn."

Isabella offered her most charming smile. "Mr. Kingsley, Mr. Dominic, it's truly an honor."

Dominic's gaze turned glacial. "My sister doesn't associate with identity thieves, Ms. Delaney."

Isabella's smile faltered at the direct reference to her past deception.

Alistair understood the hostility - Dominic was Evelyn's devoted brother after all. He suppressed a smirk, thinking, "No matter, your grandfather would never accept that gold-digger into your family."

He resolved to find a private moment with Leonard later to discuss Evelyn's inappropriate ambitions.

"If you'll excuse us," Leonard said with false politeness, "other guests require our attention."

"Of course," Alistair replied smoothly. "A pleasure as always."

Spotting Nathan Sterling across the room, Isabella brightened. "Grandfather, Nathan's here. I should—"

"That man publicly humiliated you by breaking the engagement!" Alistair hissed. "Have some pride!"

Isabella's hand drifted to her stomach. "He'll come around."

She maneuvered through the crowd, carefully protecting her belly as she approached Nathan.

"Nathan! You didn't tell me you were coming!" Her face lit up with hope.

Perhaps he still cared about her and their unborn child. That must be why he'd come after she'd mentioned the event.

Nathan barely glanced at her, his gaze scanning the room. "Last minute decision."

"Grandfather's occupied with other guests. May I join your party as your plus-one?" Her eyes shone with expectation.

Nathan finally met her gaze. "I've made my position clear to Mr. Delaney. Maintain your distance." With that, he disappeared into the crowd.

Isabella's hope shattered like dropped crystal. She clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms as she fought back tears.

This was all Evelyn's fault. That scheming witch had stolen Nathan's affection.

Needing to compose herself, she retreated to the ladies' room.

The moment she entered, she froze. Evelyn stood at the marble sink, calmly drying her hands.

"You!" Isabella spat. "Must you haunt my every step?"

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "I believe you owe me something, Isabella."

She took a step forward, forcing Isabella back against the wall.

"Shall we have that public apology now?" Evelyn's voice was deceptively sweet. "Would you prefer to kneel, or will a simple bow suffice?"

"In your dreams!" Isabella shot back. "Look at you - dressed like a common shopgirl. What makes you think you belong here?"
###Chapter 103 A Calculated Fall

Isabella had spent weeks meticulously preparing for this event. Her custom couture gown had been flown in from Paris three weeks prior.

Though five months along, the empire waistline of her tulle skirt perfectly disguised her pregnancy bump.

She looked passably attractive.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "If you can show up uninvited, so can I."

With that, she strode past without hesitation.

"Wait! We're not finished here!" Isabella scrambled after her.

The marble floor was slick from recent polishing. In her precarious stilettos, Isabella's foot slid violently forward.

A sharp gasp escaped her lips.

As she pitched toward the ground, maternal instinct kicked in. Just before impact, firm hands caught her shoulders, pulling her against a solid chest.

Isabella trembled. "Th-thank you," she stammered between ragged breaths.

"Careful now," came the deep reply.

At the sound of that voice, Isabella's face drained of color. She shoved away from her rescuer with surprising strength.

Without explanation, she smoothed her dress and practically ran from the foyer.

The mysterious man disappeared into the ballroom without another word.

Evelyn watched the exchange with narrowed eyes.

Isabella had reacted to that gray-suited stranger with unmistakable fear. Normally, she'd never retreat from any confrontation, no matter how humiliating.

So why this sudden change?

Evelyn checked her watch. Time to slip away and change into her evening gown.

Inside the grand ballroom, a string quartet played Vivaldi beneath crystal chandeliers. Golden light danced across champagne flutes and diamond jewelry.

Guests murmured about quarterly earnings and mergers while pretending to enjoy the canapés.

Nathan ascended the podium. A single glance silenced the musicians.

The crowd stilled, sensing the evening's main event was about to begin.

Margaret stood near the front, hands clasped behind her back, watching her grandson with quiet pride. She'd deliberately stepped back from public life years ago to let Nathan take center stage.

Though she'd lost her son and daughter-in-law too soon, their remarkable children had more than honored their memory.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Nathan raised his glass, "thank you for celebrating my grandmother's seventieth birthday tonight."

The guests mirrored his toast with practiced smiles.

"There's someone special I'd like you all to meet." Nathan extended his hand toward the grand staircase.

All heads turned as he announced, "My sister, Evelyn Kingsley."

Spotlights illuminated the stunning figure descending the stairs. A collective gasp rippled through the crowd.

Evelyn's lips curved in a subtle smile. She gathered her skirts with effortless grace.

Her stylist had swept her raven locks into an intricate updo, leaving delicate tendrils framing her sculpted cheekbones.

The smoky eye makeup accentuated her feline gaze, lending an air of sophisticated mystery.

Her couture gown shimmered like liquid silver under the lights, hand-embroidered with thousands of micro-crystals from bodice to hem.

The emerald parure around her neck and wrists was rumored to have once belonged to Russian royalty.

Murmurs spread through the crowd. Beyond her breathtaking beauty, the sheer opulence of her ensemble rivaled small nations' GDPs.

All eyes inevitably drifted to Harrison Whitmore.

The granddaughter of the world's wealthiest man had been his secretary - and wife - before he'd callously discarded her. Did he regret it now?

Evelyn reached the microphone. Her gaze instantly found Harrison in the crowd.

He raised his glass in silent salute, making her cheeks flush that pretty rose gold.

Nathan observed their wordless exchange, his expression darkening.

He'd never imagined his former secretary was Leonard Kingsley's granddaughter.

Three years of marriage, and she'd never once revealed she was billionaire royalty.

The woman was a masterful deceiver.

White-hot anger surged through him as he recalled her intimate smile with Harrison. His knuckles whitened around his champagne flute.

Had she left him for Harrison? How long had this been going on?

Meanwhile, Isabella was barely containing her rage.

Watching Evelyn bask in the spotlight brought back every humiliating memory of her own past arrogance.

The bitter hatred churned in her stomach until she feared she might actually scream.
###Chapter 104 The Revelation

Only fifteen paces stood between Isabella and the raised platform, yet the distance felt insurmountable.

She had always prided herself on being the privileged heiress of the Delaney fortune. But in this moment, she realized how utterly small she appeared.

"Good evening everyone," Evelyn Carter announced with effortless grace, her smile radiant under the spotlight. "Thank you for joining my grandfather's birthday celebration."

"You've all heard the rumors circulating about me recently," she continued, pausing deliberately.

The reporters' cameras flashed wildly, capturing this bombshell revelation.

Evelyn Carter, the managing director of Kingsley Industries' Pamore branch, was Leonard Kingsley's granddaughter!

The crowd gasped. They had assumed her relationship with Dominic Kingsley was romantic. No one imagined they were siblings.

Now they noticed the striking family resemblance between them.

Evelyn's expression turned serious. "I must clarify that Maxwell and I are simply childhood friends. Our friendship predates my relationship with..."

Her gaze flickered to Nathan Sterling and Isabella before continuing, "As for my marriage to Mr. Sterling, That chapter is closed. I'd appreciate if everyone could respect our privacy."

She spoke with dignified composure, showing none of the awkwardness typical of divorced couples.

The contrast was stark. Here stood the ex-wife making a graceful statement, while her cheating husband attended with his pregnant mistress.

Camera lenses immediately swiveled toward Nathan and Isabella.

Nathan remained stoic, but Isabella squirmed under the sudden media scrutiny.

Public opinion was shifting rapidly, and her reputation as the other woman would only deteriorate further.

Suddenly, reporters' phones began buzzing simultaneously. Their expressions turned to shock as they read the notifications.

"Ms. Carter!" one journalist called out. "We've just received confirmation that you're—"

Evelyn blinked in surprise, realizing Sophia's warning about her identity being exposed had come true.

She smiled warmly. "Yes, it's true. I am The Calico."

"What inspired your decade-long charity work for children with cleft palates in mountain regions?" another reporter pressed.

Evelyn's smile softened. "That's personal. I simply hope others will join me in supporting these children through action, not just words."

She continued firmly, "Additionally, I must address another rumor. I attended Royal Academy from age five, and the bullying allegations are completely false."

"The edited video footage will be sent to your media outlets shortly with identities protected."

"Of course, Ms. Carter," the reporters nodded eagerly. "We'll issue corrections immediately."

It was impossible to reconcile the image of a cruel bully with this compassionate woman beloved by underprivileged children.

First shocked by her royal lineage, the crowd now stood in awe of her genuine nobility.

The truth became clear - Evelyn had been innocent all along, victimized by false accusations.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Dominic Kingsley stepped forward. "I have an additional announcement. I'm transferring all my shares to Evelyn and nominating her as—"

The crowd erupted before he could finish.

This meant Evelyn wouldn't just be the granddaughter of the world's wealthiest man - she'd become president of its top corporation!

A status beyond most people's wildest dreams.
###Chapter 105 A Web of Deceptions

"In the coming weeks, Kingsley Industries will initiate legal proceedings against every media outlet involved in defaming my sister."

Dominic's voice cut through the ballroom like ice. His piercing gaze briefly locked onto Alistair across the crowded hall.

Alistair Delaney stood frozen, champagne flute slipping through his fingers. The glass shattered at his feet as realization dawned - the woman he'd tried to destroy now had the full might of the Kingsley empire behind her.

The assembled journalists gasped. This wasn't just damage control - it was a declaration of war.

Pamore's entertainment landscape would never be the same.

Meanwhile, Natalie Reeves' GEM Magazine broke the exclusive story revealing Evelyn Carter's true identity and the Calico Foundation's charitable work.

Public opinion shifted instantly.

"Unbelievable! What cosmic karma makes someone both ridiculously wealthy and kind-hearted? I need her life!"

"That Sterling fool must be blind. Dumping a goddess for that plain-looking mistress?"

"Karma's coming for them hard. You love to see it."

"Serious question - does Evelyn have any long-lost siblings? I feel we'd be soulmates."

As Evelyn descended the stage with Dominic, Alistair rushed forward with forced cheer. "Mr. Kingsley! Had I known your relationship with Ms. Carter-"

"Save your breath," Leonard Kingsley snapped. "Your family's crimes against my granddaughter won't be forgiven with pretty words."

Dominic's grip tightened on his sister's arm. "Hired thugs. Slander campaigns. That staged car accident. The Delaneys will answer for everything."

Alistair's smile turned desperate. "Those were rogue employees! I knew nothing-"

"Really?" Evelyn's musical voice held dangerous amusement. "Because I distinctly recall your threats over the phone. Something about exposing me to my grandfather?"

Alistair's face drained of color. His gamble had spectacularly backfired.

"Ms. Carter, please - once Isabella delivers her child, I'll ensure she faces justice. Compensation for your suffering, retractions of every false story-"

"You think money fixes this?" Leonard's roar silenced the room. "The Kingsleys don't need your blood money."

Evelyn stepped forward, tapping Alistair's lapel with one manicured finger. "You're absolutely certain you want to make amends?"

"One hundred percent!"

"Maxwell?" Evelyn called sweetly.

Her brother's right-hand man appeared with a red velvet pouch. When he tipped out Alistair's prized diamond signet ring, the old man's knees buckled.

The same ring he'd worn during every underhanded deal. The one that never left his finger.

Until now.
###Chapter 106 Shattered Legacy

Alistair's most prized possession, the diamond thumb ring that had been passed down through three generations of Delaneys, was always kept in a velvet-lined safe when not worn.

Seeing Evelyn casually dangling it in a plastic bag made his stomach twist violently.

"Miss Carter—" His voice cracked.

At Evelyn's slight nod, Maxwell placed the ring into Alistair's trembling palm.

For a brief moment, hope flickered in Alistair's chest. Perhaps she was showing mercy after all.

"Ms. Carter, your beauty is only matched by your generosity—"

His fingers twitched toward the family heirloom.

Then Evelyn's icy voice cut through the air. "If you truly wish to atone, prove it by crushing this under a hammer."

The blood drained from Alistair's face.

Destroy it?

This couldn't be happening. The Delaney ring was priceless—a symbol of their lineage since the Gilded Age.

"You can't be serious!" His voice rose an octave. "This is a museum-quality artifact! Its value—"

"Wasn't it you who offered compensation?" Evelyn tilted her head, watching his panic with detached amusement. "Unless... you're having second thoughts?"

This wasn't just letting go. This was tearing out a piece of his soul.

But with Kingsley Industries poised to dismantle Delaney Enterprises, Alistair had no choice.

His jaw clenched. "Fetch... a hammer."

Gasps rippled through the assembled executives.

Dominic's voice cut through the murmurs. "Your men attacked my sister. Your granddaughter orchestrated that 'accident.'" His glare could freeze lava. "Consider this merciful."

Alistair's hands shook. "Those were rogue employees! I knew nothing—"

The lie tasted bitter. One word from the Kingsleys could erase generations of Delaney wealth.

Especially now that Nathan Sterling had chosen Evelyn. The power imbalance was catastrophic.

"Funny," Evelyn mused, tapping one manicured nail against her champagne flute. "I distinctly recall threats about exposing me to Leonard."

Alistair wanted to vomit. That phone call would haunt him forever.

"Ms. Carter, listen—when Isabella delivers her child, I'll personally ensure she faces justice. Name your price for the attacks, the slander... anything."

Leonard Kingsley's cane slammed against marble. "You think money fixes everything? That my granddaughter can be bought?"

"No! I swear—"

"Prove it." Evelyn extended the hammer Maxwell had procured.

Alistair's vision swam. Seventy years of family history balanced on this moment.

With a strangled cry, he brought the hammer down.

The resounding crack echoed like a gunshot.

As diamond shards skittered across the floor, Evelyn finally smiled. "Now we're getting somewhere."

Maxwell produced another plastic bag—this one containing documents that made Alistair whimper.

The real game was just beginning.
###Chapter 107 Facing the Fallout

The crowd pressed in from all sides as Isabella Delaney stood frozen in place. Her fingers twisted the delicate fabric of her designer dress into knots.

A cold dread settled in her chest. Something terrible was about to happen.

"Grandfather..." Her voice cracked with desperation. She couldn't bear the thought of public humiliation from Alistair Delaney.

But the old man's expression remained stony. His life's work - the Delaney Corporation - meant more than family ties.

"Ms. Carter," Alistair declared loudly, "I assure you Isabella will face consequences for her actions."

The once-proud businessman now stood meek before Evelyn Carter, all traces of his former authority gone.

Evelyn tilted her chin upward, her silence more powerful than words.

Without warning, Alistair seized Isabella's arm and dragged her forward. "Apologize to Ms. Carter immediately!"

"Grandfather!" Isabella resisted weakly.

An apology here would destroy her social standing forever. The whispers had already begun circulating through the elite crowd.

"Do it now." Alistair's patience had evaporated.

Isabella understood her precarious position. Without the Delaney name, she'd be nothing.

Gritting her teeth, she swallowed her pride. "I... I'm sorry."

Olivia Sinclair scoffed loudly. "After everything you've done? Grace nearly died because of you!"

The murmurs grew louder.

"Mr. Delaney should be terrified. Attempted murder carries serious prison time."

"Apologies don't erase crimes."

"If I were Evelyn, I'd have her arrested already."

Isabella's face drained of color. "I'm not some cheap mistress!" she shrieked, scanning the crowd desperately.

Her eyes locked onto Nathan Sterling. He was her last hope.

She lunged forward, clinging to his arm. "Nathan! Tell them! You didn't even know Evelyn when we met!"

Nathan remained impassive, his cold gaze fixed on Evelyn's indifferent expression. Her calm demeanor only deepened his resentment.

With brutal efficiency, Nathan shoved Isabella away.

"Nathan!" She stumbled backward, landing hard on the marble floor.

A sharp pain shot through her abdomen, but she had bigger concerns.

"Please, explain to everyone!" she begged from her knees.

Disheveled and weeping, Isabella looked like a tragic clown. Nathan regarded her with detached indifference.

The spectators watched with cold amusement, enjoying the spectacle.

"Someone take her to the police station immediately," Alistair commanded, his voice heavy with false righteousness.

Isabella scrambled to her feet. "No! Please, Grandfather, don't do this!"

Alistair turned away as security moved in.

"Nathan! Help me! Grandfather, please!"

Her desperate cries fell on deaf ears as the guards seized her arms.

She fought against their grip, but their strength made resistance futile. The crowd parted as they dragged her away, her screams echoing through the grand hall.
###Chapter 108 A Farewell to Yesterday

The crowd stood frozen in shock as Sterling Enterprises' security team escorted Isabella Delaney away.

Cheaters deserve their consequences.

Yet murmurs of sympathy still rippled through the assembled guests.

"Imagine what Sterling Enterprises and Kingsley Industries could have achieved together."

"Nathan had the perfect marriage with the Kingsley heiress, but he threw it all away."

"That man must be drowning in regret right now."

Under the weight of judgmental stares, Nathan's gaze found Evelyn Carter, radiant as a diamond amidst the crowd. A storm of emotions raged within him.

The truth had left him reeling.

The dramatic reversal of their circumstances since the divorce felt like something out of a dream.

He remembered three years ago when Evelyn had proposed their secret marriage herself.

He'd been touched by her consideration and maturity. For three years, she'd played the role of perfect wife flawlessly.

Now he couldn't help wondering - why would a woman of her status marry him while hiding her true identity?

"Mr. Sterling," Dominic Kingsley materialized beside him, "we need to talk about you and my sister."

Nathan remained composed despite the swirling rumors. His unshakable poise set him apart from ordinary men.

"What is it, Mr. Kingsley?"

"Let's be clear," Dominic said bluntly. "Whatever happened between you and Evelyn is in the past now."

"And?" Nathan responded coolly, his innate sophistication undiminished.

Dominic raised an eyebrow. The man truly lived up to his formidable reputation.

"My sister suffered during those three years with your family. Your family's behavior was... less than admirable."

"If we're keeping score, your family has its own debts to settle," Nathan countered.

"If relationships were that simple, the world wouldn't be full of broken hearts."

"Mr. Kingsley, I respect you as Evelyn's brother. But that doesn't grant you rights to my personal affairs."

Dominic's expression darkened. "I admire your courage, Mr. Sterling. But do you truly understand who you're challenging?"

The unspoken threat hung heavy between them.

Nathan merely smiled. "There's only one way to find out."

Their gazes locked in silent battle. "We'll see about that," Dominic said finally.

As Dominic walked away, Nathan's attention returned to Evelyn standing beside Leonard Kingsley. Her radiant smile drew him like a moth to flame.

###Chapter 109 The Truth Behind the Mask

"Evelyn!" Nathan called out. He turned to Leonard. "May I speak with her privately?"

Leonard deferred to Evelyn with a glance. Her expression remained unreadable, only the slightest curve of her lips betraying any emotion.

"Very well," she said.

As Leonard departed, he fixed Nathan with a stern look. "The divorce is final. Don't make this harder than it needs to be."

Nathan simply nodded before turning back to Evelyn.

"What do you want?" Her voice was calm, as if discussing the weather.

Nathan remembered their wedding day three years ago - how she'd stood shyly beside him for their marriage photo.

The memory faded as quickly as it came. Now he searched her face for answers.

"Why did you hide your identity to marry me?"

The question caught Evelyn off guard. What difference did it make now?

"Why does it matter, Mr. Sterling?"

Nathan's ocean-deep eyes bored into hers. "Just answer me."

Evelyn looked away, her thoughts drifting to another time.

"My family disapproved. But I couldn't imagine life without you."

She'd abandoned everything for him - her name, her status, her family's approval. All for love that turned to dust.

"Now I understand love requires two willing hearts. My one-sided devotion only brought pain."

A self-deprecating smile touched her lips. "Youthful folly, Mr. Sterling. Now if you'll excuse me."

She walked away, her seven-inch heels clicking with finality. Every step radiated confidence and independence.

The birthday celebration eventually concluded, but the revelations dominated headlines for weeks.

"Unbelievable! Evelyn Carter is actually Kingsley royalty!"

"Is this some fairy tale? Rich girl marries in disguise, divorces, and becomes the world's wealthiest woman!"

"The Sterlings must be kicking themselves! Beautiful, kind, and loaded - she's literally a storybook heroine!"

When Gregory Hammond saw the news in Sterling Heights, he nearly fell off his couch.

He rubbed his eyes, pinched himself. The pain confirmed this wasn't a dream.

Frantically, he texted his group chat: "HOLY CRAP! Evelyn's part of the Kingsley empire!"

Remembering how he'd treated her made him cringe. He'd thought her lucky to marry up - little did he know.

"My face is burning just thinking about it," he typed. "The Kingsleys could crush us like ants. Is it too late to apologize?"

His messages hung in digital silence. No one could process this seismic shift.

The news cycle eventually moved on. After resting at home, Evelyn prepared to return to Sterling Heights. Dominic accompanied her to the airport.

Before boarding, he handed her an envelope.

"What's this?" she asked.
###Chapter 110 A Binding Vow

The email notification pinged on Evelyn's phone.

"The share transfer agreement has been distributed to all board members electronically." Dominic's message appeared crisp on her screen.

"This year's annual meeting will take place at Kingsley Tower, where your official appointment as CEO will be announced."

Though Dominic had declared this publicly at Leonard's birthday gala, Evelyn still felt the crushing weight of inheriting Kingsley Industries.

"Isn't this too abrupt? I've barely settled into my executive role," Evelyn fretted, twisting her pearl bracelet. "There are entire divisions I haven't even reviewed yet."

Dominic's laughter rumbled through the phone. "You've been preparing for this since you negotiated our family out of that hostile takeover. The board respects you, little sister."

A hesitant pause. "But—"

She could practically see him running fingers through his dark hair. "Evelyn Carter Kingsley, this empire was built for you. Stop overthinking."

His next words wrapped around her like a cashmere shawl. "Every Kingsley stands behind you. No challenge is yours to face alone."

Warmth flooded her chest. "I won't let you down."

"Never crossed my mind," Dominic said softly before ending the call.

Back in Kingsley Tower's executive suite, Maxwell Donovan briefed Evelyn on the upcoming meeting details. The polished mahogany conference table gleamed under recessed lighting as board members filed in precisely at 9:03 AM.

Whispers died when Evelyn entered in a tailored navy Stella McCartney suit. The diamond studs at her ears caught the light as she took the head seat.

Maxwell cleared his throat. "Before we review Q3 projections, I have a critical announcement." He tapped his tablet. "Per the executed transfer documents, Dominic Kingsley has relinquished all voting shares to Evelyn Kingsley."

The room erupted.

Julian Hawthorne, the longest-serving director, raised a manicured hand. "With respect, this seems... precipitous." His gaze swept the table, gathering nods. "While Ms. Kingsley's lineage is impeccable, corporate leadership requires proven—"

"—experience I lack?" Evelyn finished smoothly. She stood, palms flat on the table. "Kingsley Industries isn't just our family legacy. It's the livelihood of thirty-seven thousand employees."

Silence.

Julian's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Lofty words, Ms. Kingsley. But we answer to shareholders expecting twelve percent growth." He leaned forward. "Unless you're prepared to stake something tangible..."

Maxwell started to interject. Evelyn silenced him with a glance.

The antique clock ticked three times before she spoke.
###Chapter 111 The Stakes Are Set

Evelyn's piercing gaze swept across the boardroom before landing on Julian Hawthorne. Her lips pressed into a thin line as she demanded, "Explain yourself, Director Hawthorne."

"Prove your worth with tangible results. Let's make it simple - 30% growth."

"If you can boost Kingsley Industries' performance by 30%, the presidency is yours. Fail, and well... let's just say convincing the board won't be so easy."

Silence.

Julian's outrageous demand sent murmurs through the assembled executives. A 30% increase? Impossible. Not even Dominic Kingsley could achieve such numbers.

He was setting her up for failure.

"Director Hawthorne," Evelyn countered coolly, "We both know even a 10% growth would be challenging for an international conglomerate like Kingsley Industries."

"What exactly are you trying to accomplish with this impossible demand?" Derek Monroe couldn't contain his outburst, though no other board member dared speak up.

Julian merely shrugged. "Only such a challenge can truly demonstrate Ms. Carter's capabilities."

"Should she succeed, every director here would support her presidency - not just me."

"You—!" Derek's face flushed with anger.

Evelyn placed a restraining hand on his arm before locking eyes with Julian. "Is this your final offer?"

"Unless you're afraid to accept?" Julian's smirk was predatory.

A slow smile curved Evelyn's lips. "Since you've issued the challenge, refusing would be... impolite. However—"

The room erupted in whispers.

"She actually accepted! Does she understand what 30% means?"

"That's expanding operations by a third! The profit margins alone—"

"Pigs will fly first."

"Youthful arrogance. She doesn't grasp the impossibility."

Julian's laugh dripped with condescension. "However what, Ms. Carter? Speak freely."

"We need consequences." Evelyn's voice cut through the murmurs.

Julian's eyes gleamed. She'd walked right into his trap. "Then let's make it official."

"Name your terms."

"If you fail to achieve 30% growth within one year, you resign immediately and forfeit all claims to the presidency."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "And if I succeed?"

Julian's booming laugh echoed through the boardroom. The woman was delusional. 30% growth? Impossible.

Already envisioning her removal, he declared, "Should you somehow succeed, I'll surrender my voting rights."

"I'll retain dividend privileges but abstain from all future corporate decisions."

Gasps filled the room. "Director Hawthorne, reconsider! This isn't a joking matter!"

"You've contributed so much to Kingsley Industries. Don't make rash decisions!"

Julian waved them off with arrogant confidence. "My word is my bond."

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "Then we have an agreement."

As the meeting adjourned, Derek followed Evelyn to her office, anxiety lining his face.

"Ms. Carter, they're deliberately sabotaging you. Why accept? A 30% increase is—"

Evelyn knew exactly what it was.
###Chapter 112 Date Me

"Do you honestly believe I had any other option?" Evelyn asked, her voice laced with steel.

As the newest executive at Kingsley Industries, she knew the old guard would never respect her without concrete results to back her position.

"Director Hawthorne is only pushing so hard because he's determined to block my presidency. If I'd backed down now, they'd keep walking all over me."

"So I chose to establish dominance instead," Evelyn declared, her chin lifted in defiance.

"But this wager is dangerously ambitious. Director Hawthorne was so confident because he knows a thirty percent increase is nearly impossible," her assistant argued.

Evelyn gave a sharp nod. "What's said is said. Now we roll up our sleeves and make it happen."

Simon, ever loyal, stepped forward. "You can count on me, Ms. Carter. I'll give everything to support you."

"That's exactly what I needed to hear."

News of the boardroom showdown spread through Kingsley Industries like wildfire. By lunchtime, every department was buzzing about the bold new executive.

When Adrian Prescott heard the rumors, his eyebrows shot up. "Is this true? Did Evelyn really do that?"

"Absolutely," his informant confirmed. "Ms. Carter stood her ground so fiercely the entire board was speechless."

Adrian let out a low whistle. "That's my Evelyn! Absolutely brilliant!"

"But... thirty percent? That's an impossible target. She's taken an enormous risk."

Adrian smirked, swirling his whiskey. "You don't know her like I do. She always takes the path no one else dares."

Evelyn had done what he'd always fantasized about but lacked the courage to attempt. His admiration for her grew exponentially.

"Oh no," he murmured to himself, a slow smile spreading across his face. "I'm falling for her all over again."
###Chapter 113 Still Not Here

Adrian Prescott stormed into Evelyn Carter's office the moment he returned to Kingsley Industries.

"Evelyn, now that everyone knows who you really are, why don't we just honor our families' wishes and get married?" His voice carried an unusual urgency.

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "I appreciate the offer, Adrian, but marriage isn't something I'm considering right now."

His expression softened. "Then whenever you're ready, just say the word. I'll be waiting."

She massaged her temples, feeling the beginnings of a migraine. "Mr. Prescott, we've had this conversation before. We're not compatible."

"What makes you say that?" He leaned forward, his blue eyes intense. "You haven't given me a proper chance. How can you reject me without even trying to know me better?"

"Do you actually know me?" Her sharp retort left him momentarily speechless.

"We have all the time in the world to learn about each other," he recovered, though some of his earlier confidence had faded.

Evelyn sighed. "Marriage requires love as its foundation. Not family expectations or business alliances."

"Then I'll make you fall in love with me." The determination in his voice surprised her. "Don't worry, I won't pressure you. We'll take things slow."

Before she could respond, he flashed his signature charming smile and stood up. "Back to work, Ms. Carter. I've got meetings to attend."

As the door closed behind him, Evelyn exhaled deeply. The weight of her responsibilities pressed down on her shoulders.

The following days saw Evelyn buried under endless meetings. The executive floor remained brightly lit late into every night.

Meanwhile, Julian Hawthorne listened to his subordinates' reports with growing satisfaction.

"She's putting on quite the show," he sneered. "Let's see how she plans to turn this company around."

"Director Hawthorne, we're monitoring all her projects closely. None show potential for significant impact yet."

"Excellent. Keep watching her every move. Don't let her slip through our fingers."

"Of course, sir."

"Any updates on my meeting with Mr. Sterling and Mr. Langley?"

"Confirmed for seven tonight at Le Jardin. Both gentlemen have confirmed their attendance. The restaurant has been notified."

"Good. Ensure I'm not late."

Julian's eyes gleamed with calculation. The very public divorce between Nathan Sterling and Evelyn Carter had created ripples throughout the business world. Their animosity was common knowledge now.

As the old saying went - the enemy of my enemy is my friend. If Julian could secure Nathan as an ally, his path to control would become much smoother.

This thought brought him immense satisfaction.

At precisely seven, Julian arrived at the upscale restaurant and settled into the private dining room.

He checked his gold wristwatch impatiently. "Where are they? They should be here by now."
###Chapter 114 A Favor

"I'll make a call," Zane said as he reached for his phone, but Julian stopped him with a raised hand.

"Not yet. Let's give it a few more minutes."

Nearly an hour later, Nathan arrived with Simon in tow.

"Mr. Hawthorne, I've been looking forward to meeting you," Julian said, approaching with an ingratiating smile that didn't quite reach his eyes.

Nathan's face remained an unreadable mask, giving nothing away.

"Director Hawthorne, apologies for the delay."

"No trouble at all. I just got here myself. Since Mr. Langley hasn't arrived yet, perhaps we could talk while we wait."

Julian pulled out a chair with exaggerated courtesy. "Mr. Sterling, please."

Nathan sat down, stretching his long legs with casual elegance.

"Mr. Sterling, I'm truly honored you could spare time from your busy schedule."

"Director Hawthorne," Simon cut in smoothly, "perhaps we should get straight to business. If you have something to discuss, please proceed."

Julian chuckled nervously. "Mr. Sterling, you're as perceptive as they say. Indeed, I requested this meeting for a specific purpose."

Nathan finally spoke, his voice cool. "As a board member at Kingsley Industries, you have no official ties with Sterling Enterprises. I'm curious what this might concern."

Julian leaned forward eagerly. "Well, Mr. Sterling, I'm sure you're aware our new CEO, Evelyn Carter, happens to be your ex-wife."

At the mention of Evelyn's name, Nathan's fingers began drumming a slow rhythm on the tabletop. Though his expression remained neutral, the tension in his jaw betrayed his irritation.

Without confirming or denying Julian's assumption, he gestured for the man to continue.

"Ms. Carter has quite the audacity. She's barely settled into her position and already promised to increase company profits by thirty percent."

Nathan arched an eyebrow. "And your point is?"

Julian failed to notice the dangerous glint in Nathan's eyes. Mistaking his silence for agreement, the director pressed on eagerly.

"Mr. Sterling, I want to discuss Evelyn's pet project - the collaboration between Sterling Enterprises, Kingsley Industries, and Langley Group."

"If anything were to... disrupt this venture, not only would she fail to deliver on her promise, but she might lose the entire investment."

"Under those circumstances, her position would become untenable."

As he spoke, Julian couldn't hide his smug satisfaction, already envisioning Evelyn's humiliation when her plans collapsed.

He completely missed the way Nathan's knuckles whitened around his glass. "Director Hawthorne, you've certainly devised an... interesting strategy."

The sarcasm in Nathan's voice went right over Julian's head. "Exactly! This way, I win our little wager, and you get to—"

The door burst open abruptly, cutting off Julian mid-sentence and freezing the room in sudden tension.

Julian jumped in his seat. When he looked up, his face drained of color.

Evelyn stood framed in the doorway, her sharp gaze pinning Julian to his chair.

"Director Hawthorne, it seems I've interrupted at a rather... revealing moment."

Though her tone was light, the words sent a visible shudder through Julian's body.

"H-how did you get here?"
###Chapter 115 The Truth Behind the Gossip

A knowing smirk played on Evelyn Carter's crimson lips as she leaned against the doorframe. "I see my presence isn't exactly welcome here."

Despite her sarcastic remark, she strode into the private dining room with effortless grace.

The atmosphere turned instantly tense. Julian Hawthorne hadn't anticipated being ambushed by Evelyn in this manner.

But as a seasoned businessman, he quickly masked his surprise.

"Ms. Carter, whatever gave you that impression?" Julian rose smoothly from his seat. "Your company is always appreciated."

As she settled into the offered chair, Evelyn's gaze locked with Nathan Sterling's for a charged moment. Electricity crackled between them.

She arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow. "How interesting to find Mr. Sterling here. I hope I'm not interrupting anything... sensitive."

"Not at all," Julian interjected smoothly. "We were just discussing your remarkable achievements. Who would've guessed you'd take Kingsley Industries by storm after leaving Sterling Enterprises?"

"Director Hawthorne was particularly impressed," Nathan added, his deep voice resonating. "Claimed you could boost board performance by thirty percent this year. Isn't that right, Ms. Carter?"

"Merely an observation," Julian said with false modesty. "No offense intended."

The tension in the room thickened as Julian realized the rumors about Evelyn and Nathan's bitter divorce might have been greatly exaggerated.

He'd clearly miscalculated.

Evelyn had overheard enough at the door to understand Julian's sudden change of heart.

She knew his game, but Nathan's unexpected presence complicated matters.

Were they conspiring against her?

Her dark eyes flashed dangerously, though her voice remained composed. "Director Hawthorne and I did make a wager, that much is true."

She fixed Julian with a piercing stare. "Now that our little bet has become public knowledge, let's maintain some dignity, shall we? Backroom deals don't become men of your stature."

Julian's expression darkened. He hadn't expected such direct confrontation.

But severing ties completely would be premature.

"Forcing a smile, he protested, "Ms. Carter, you misunderstand me. My professional integrity is beyond reproach."

"Our agreement stands exactly as we made it. I wouldn't dream of interfering."

Evelyn nodded curtly. Mission accomplished, she saw no reason to linger.

"Now that we understand each other, I'll take my leave. Gentlemen." She rose gracefully.

Nathan stood as well, adjusting his tailored suit jacket. "Allow me to escort you out."

His tone brooked no argument.

The pair exited, leaving a bewildered Julian in their wake.

This wasn't how divorced couples behaved according to the tabloids.

"Ms. Carter!" Victor Langley's voice rang out as Evelyn stepped into the restaurant's lobby.

He approached with long strides. "How did it go? Everything settled?"

Evelyn paused, studying his concerned expression.

"Mr. Langley, I owe you my thanks today."

Without his timely warning, who knew what schemes Julian and Nathan might have concocted?

At least Julian was temporarily contained.

Victor opened his mouth to respond when he noticed Nathan approaching at a leisurely pace.

His lips curved into a knowing smile as he murmured, "Between us, formalities aren't necessary."
###Chapter 116 A Tangled Web

Evelyn offered a genuine smile. "Regardless of circumstances, I owe you for today's assistance. Should you ever require my help, don't hesitate to ask."

Victor inclined his head slightly, his expression turning serious. "Director Hawthorne isn't what he seems."

His voice dropped lower. "With decades in business, his connections and cunning surpass ordinary comprehension. You'd do well to watch your step around him."

"I'll be more vigilant," Evelyn promised.

Victor's gaze lingered on a loose strand of hair framing her face. His fingers twitched toward it instinctively.

"Nathan Sterling!" The sharp interruption froze Victor's movement mid-reach.

With practiced ease, Victor withdrew his hand, offering Evelyn an apologetic smile. "Your hair was coming undone."

Evelyn blinked in surprise, her fingers automatically checking her updo.

Nathan positioned himself between them like a human shield. "I hear congratulations are in order, Mr. Langley. The engagement to Sterling Enterprises' heiress must be thrilling news."

Victor's brow furrowed. The arranged marriage remained a private family matter - how had Nathan obtained this information?

"Premature congratulations," Victor deflected, his eyes flickering to Evelyn. "When I find someone truly worthy, you'll receive a proper invitation."

The unspoken challenge hung between them. Nathan's jaw tightened as understanding dawned - Victor's interest in Evelyn was unmistakable.

A possessive fury ignited in Nathan's chest. The thought of Victor coveting what was his made his blood boil.

Evelyn remained oblivious to Nathan's presence, having ignored him since he'd followed her outside.

"Ms. Carter, allow me to escort you," Victor offered, deliberately ignoring Nathan's glare.

"That's unnecessary, Mr. Langley. I drove myself."

"Then at least let me walk you to your car."

Evelyn nodded gratefully. "Thank you."

As they turned to leave, Nathan's hand shot out, gripping Evelyn's wrist. "We need to talk."

Evelyn recoiled as if burned. "Mr. Sterling, control yourself." Her frosty tone contrasted sharply with her earlier warmth toward Victor.

"Privately," Nathan ground out through clenched teeth.

Evelyn's refusal was immediate. "Say what you must here. I haven't time for games."

Nathan's eyes darkened dangerously. "Don't concern yourself with Director Hawthorne-"

"Funny," Evelyn cut in coldly. "You seemed quite cozy with him earlier."

The memory of Nathan's private conversation with Julian Hawthorne turned her stomach. Did he take her for a fool? After three years by his side, she'd learned all his tricks.

"Do you even hear yourself?" Nathan's control was fraying. Being misunderstood by her was unbearable.

Yet pride prevented explanations. "You think I'd collaborate with him?"

"The evidence speaks for itself." Evelyn turned decisively to Victor. "Shall we?"

Victor's lips curved in quiet triumph.

Nathan watched them walk away, his frustration exploding into a vicious punch that left the nearby pillar dented.
###Chapter 117 Your Ex-Wife

The private room at Saffron Bistro echoed with the sound of shattering glass and splintering wood as Julian Hawthorne vented his rage on everything in sight.

"That insolent woman! How dare she humiliate me like this?"

He kicked over a chair, sending it flying across the room with a violent crash.

His jaw clenched. He couldn’t let this stand.

If he backed down now, Evelyn Carter would forever have the upper hand, and he’d never regain control.

Pulling out his phone, he dialed a number.

"Use whatever means necessary. I want Evelyn disgraced and out of Kingsley Industries by the end of the week."

He hung up, but before he could leave, a sharp knock interrupted him.

"Who is it?" he demanded, wary.

The door swung open.

"Mr. Hawthorne, our chairman requests your presence."

Julian frowned. "And who is your chairman?"

"Alistair Delaney."

The name was familiar, but Julian had no dealings with the Delaneys. "What does Mr. Delaney want with me?"

"You’ll find out soon enough."

After a brief hesitation, Julian followed the man out.

At 11 PM, the neon lights of Eclipse Lounge pulsed with life. The bass thrummed through the floor, electrifying the crowd, pulling them deeper into the night’s intoxication.

In a shadowed corner booth, Nathan Sterling sat with a stormy expression, downing glass after glass of whiskey.

"Man, what’s eating you?" Gregory Hammond leaned in, studying his friend’s dark mood.

Nathan remained silent.

Gregory smirked. This was rare. "Let me guess… trouble with your ex-wife?"

Nathan’s grip tightened around his glass.

Gregory’s grin widened. "Damn, I hit the nail on the head!"

"Don’t bring her up." It was the first sentence Nathan had uttered all night.

Gregory chuckled. "So she did get under your skin?"

"Shut up."

Gregory sighed dramatically. "Man, we really screwed up back then."

Every time he remembered how they’d treated Evelyn, regret twisted in his gut.

They’d lost their chance to be on good terms with the Kingsley heiress.

"Come on, it’s just a woman. Cheer up! Look around—plenty of beautiful women here. Tell me your type, and I’ll have one sent over."

Nathan’s cold gaze swept the room. "Not interested."

"Fine. Suit yourself." Gregory turned his attention to the dance floor.

Just then, the music surged, the spotlight shifting to a woman in a crimson dress that clung to her curves like liquid fire.

"Holy hell, look at her!" Gregory’s eyes widened as he watched the woman move with hypnotic grace.

Long legs, a waist that begged to be held, and a presence that commanded every gaze in the room.

Her dance was pure seduction, drawing screams and whistles from the crowd.

Even the way she turned her back was enough to make men lose their minds.

Gregory let out an impressed whistle.

Then, she turned—her face illuminated under the shifting lights.

Gregory nearly choked.

"No way—that’s Evelyn!"

Nathan, mid-sip, froze.

Gregory was practically vibrating with excitement. "Nathan, look! It’s your ex-wife!"
###Chapter 118 Sparking Her Fire

Nathan's gaze followed Gregory's pointed finger, landing on a silhouette he'd recognize anywhere.

Even if she turned to dust, he'd still know that figure instantly.

Hadn't she left with Victor Langley? What was she doing here?

Evelyn moved with hypnotic grace on the dance floor. The moment she appeared, every eye in the club turned toward her.

Within minutes, she'd become the radiant epicenter of the entire venue.

Her laughter sparkled like champagne bubbles, radiating confidence that made the air hum with electricity. She looked ethereal, causing Nathan's pulse to quicken against his will.

This was a side of Evelyn he'd never witnessed. He never imagined she could glow like this.

Nathan's fingers tightened around his whiskey glass. He drained it in one burning swallow.

All pretense of restraint vanished. Slamming the glass down, he stalked toward the dance floor.

"Damn, Evelyn! You're setting this place on fire!" Olivia whooped over the music.

She grabbed Evelyn's hand, spinning her under the strobe lights. "Best decision ever bringing you out tonight! Let's burn this city down!"

Evelyn felt electric, alive in ways she'd forgotten. She clinked her cocktail against Olivia's. "To freedom!"

Their shared grin spoke volumes.

Evelyn tossed back her drink, the citrus tang bursting on her tongue. Without hesitation, she signaled the bartender for another.

"Hold my purse," she told Olivia. "Restroom break."

She'd barely turned the corner when Nathan materialized before her like a storm cloud.

Her smile died instantly.

She pivoted sharply, treating him like a ghost.

"Evelyn!" His voice cracked like a whip.

Her pace quickened, heels clicking like gunshots against the tile.

Nathan's jaw clenched. In three strides he had her pinned near the restroom entrance.

"Let go!" She twisted violently, but his grip was steel.

The memory of her accusations about him conspiring with Julian Hawthorne burned in his throat. The whiskey fueled his temper.

"Whatever you think happened with Hawthorne—"

"I don't care!" She kicked at his shins. "Nathan, release me!"

His gaze dropped to her heaving chest. Her signature jasmine perfume wrapped around him, intoxicating. Something primal stirred.

Before he could stop himself, he leaned in.

The slap echoed like a gunshot. His head snapped sideways.

The sting cleared the alcohol fog instantly. What had he almost done?

"Enjoying your little power trip?" Evelyn's voice dripped ice.

She shoved against his chest. "Still think you can snap your fingers and I'll come running?"

"That's not—"

"Save it." She twisted free, eyes blazing. "Stay the hell away from me."

Nathan didn't chase her. Instead, a slow smile curved his lips.

"You good, man?" Gregory appeared, having witnessed the slap.

In the past, Nathan would've made her regret that. Tonight? He just touched his stinging cheek, remembering the fire in her eyes.

At least she wasn't that hollow shell anymore.

He could still make her feel something.

"Isabella!" Vanessa came rushing over in a panic. "Are you hurt?"

Isabella clutched her stomach, face paling. She pointed a trembling finger at Evelyn. "She—she hurt my baby! Somebody call an ambulance!"
###Chapter 119 Isabella's Return

The neon lights of Halo Bar flickered as Vanessa Sterling stood outside, tapping her foot impatiently. Her phone call to Nathan Sterling went straight to voicemail again.

A pale hand gripped her arm. "Are you absolutely certain he's here?" Isabella Delaney's voice trembled with urgency.

Vanessa nodded vigorously. "I saw him enter with my own eyes, Isabella. He's definitely inside."

Isabella's nails dug into her palms. Just weeks ago, she'd been rotting in a jail cell, abandoned by the Delaney family after Alistair disowned her.

The Sterling family had compiled enough evidence to bury her alive in court.

But fate had granted her one mercy - the pregnancy. It was her golden ticket out of confinement.

She'd called. She'd texted. But Nathan had ghosted her completely.

Desperation drove her to escape the hospital surveillance.

"Let's go in," Vanessa urged, pulling Isabella toward the pulsing entrance.

The bar's energy should have been exhilarating, but Isabella froze mid-step when her eyes landed on the VIP section.

Vanessa followed her gaze and gasped. "That witch! She's clinging to Nathan again like some pathetic ex. Don't they know it's over?"

Isabella's grip on Vanessa's wrist turned vice-like as she watched the scene unfold.

Evelyn Carter had just playfully flicked Nathan's forehead. And worse - he was smiling. Actually smiling.

Isabella's stomach churned with acid.

When Evelyn finally walked away, Isabella moved like a panther stalking prey.

Meanwhile, Evelyn stormed back to her table, snatching her purse with enough force to rattle the glasses. "I'm out," she told Olivia Sinclair. "You guys enjoy your night."

Olivia, already three drinks deep, waved absently. "Drive safe, babe."

Evelyn turned - and came face-to-face with a ghost.

Isabella looked like death warmed over. Gaunt. Pale. But most disturbingly - free.

"How?" The word slipped out before Evelyn could stop it.

Isabella's lips curled. "Surprised?" The venom in her voice could kill a horse.

Evelyn's eyes flicked to Isabella's still-flat stomach. "You always were resourceful."

"Enjoying your victory lap?" Isabella's voice cracked. "While I lose everything?"

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine as Isabella's gaze darted toward Nathan.

Then - pain. Sharp nails digging into her forearm.

"Please Evelyn," Isabella suddenly wailed, loud enough for half the bar to hear. "Have mercy on my baby! I love him! Just let us be happy!"

Evelyn tried to wrench free. "Have you lost your damn mind?"

Isabella's smile turned feral as she dramatically released Evelyn's arm - only to hurl herself backward onto the floor.

The sickening thud of flesh meeting hardwood silenced the surrounding tables.

"ISABELLA!" Vanessa shrieked, rushing forward.

Isabella cradled her stomach, face contorted in theatrical agony. She pointed a shaking finger at Evelyn. "Why...why would you hurt my baby?"

The entire bar turned to stare as Isabella's dress began blooming with red.
###Chapter 120 The Familiar Game

The pulsing music in the nightclub came to an abrupt halt as a shrill scream pierced through the air.

"Help! Someone save my baby!"

Evelyn Carter stood frozen, watching the scene unfold with disbelief.

This wasn't Isabella Delaney's first performance. Had she developed some sick addiction to theatrics?

Across the room, Nathan Sterling's gaze darkened as he took in the commotion. Without hesitation, he strode toward where Isabella had collapsed.

Right now, questions about her presence here were irrelevant.

Isabella clutched at Nathan's hand desperately, her face twisted in exaggerated pain.

"Nathan! Please...save our baby!"

"Vanessa Sterling immediately pointed an accusing finger. "It was Evelyn! She pushed Isabella!"

Nathan remained silent, his expression unreadable.

This didn't appear to be one of Isabella's usual performances. He reached down to help her up.

The moment his hand touched her dress, he felt something warm and sticky.

"Blood! Nathan, she's bleeding!" Vanessa shrieked, sending the surrounding crowd into panic.

"Someone call an ambulance!" A voice shouted from the gathered onlookers.

Without wasting another second, Nathan scooped Isabella into his arms and carried her toward the exit.

Olivia Sinclair arrived just in time to witness the commotion. "What in the world happened here?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a bitter smile. "Seems I've walked into another one of their traps."

"What do you mean?"

Evelyn's gaze dropped to the crimson stains on the floor.

She never imagined Isabella would go this far - sacrificing her own unborn child just to frame her.

After a tense moment, Evelyn's eyes flickered toward the security camera in the corner. A cold determination settled in her gaze.

At the hospital, Nathan and Vanessa waited outside the operating room in tense silence.

Finally, a nurse rushed out with urgent news.

"Family of the patient?"

Nathan stepped forward immediately. "How is she?"

"Are you the husband? The patient has suffered a miscarriage and requires an emergency procedure. We need your signature immediately."

The words hit Nathan like a physical blow.

"The patient's condition is critical. Please sign quickly."

His hand moved automatically, scrawling his name across the form.

After the procedure, Isabella was transferred to a private ward.

By morning, the Delaney family had descended upon the hospital in full force.

Alistair Delaney's face darkened when he saw Nathan. "Explain yourself! How did my granddaughter end up in this condition?"

Nathan's jaw tightened. "The matter requires proper investigation before conclusions can be drawn."

Vanessa, however, couldn't resist interjecting. "It was Evelyn Carter! She pushed Isabella down the stairs!"

Her accusation created an instant silence in the corridor.

"I saw it with my own eyes. Evelyn deliberately caused the fall. Mr. Delaney, you should press charges immediately!"

"Vanessa!" Nathan's sharp reprimand silenced her.

He maintained his composure. "We shouldn't jump to conclusions without all the facts."

Alistair's lips curled into a cold sneer. He hadn't forgotten the humiliation Evelyn had caused him in Frenda.

Only her status as a Kingsley had protected her then. But now...this incident provided the perfect opportunity for revenge.
###Chapter 121 The Truth Unravels

"Then we should involve the authorities!" Alistair's voice cut through the tension like a blade, his piercing gaze locked onto Vanessa.

"Since Ms. Sterling claims to have witnessed everything, surely she wouldn't let Isabella suffer injustice. Ms. Sterling, I expect you to testify honestly about what you saw."

Vanessa hesitated. "I—"

Her teeth sank into her lower lip. She had intended to testify, but one look at Nathan's stormy expression made the words die in her throat.

She changed her statement. "The lighting was poor. I might not have seen everything clearly."

She'd just altered her testimony in front of Alistair Delaney himself! Vanessa's pulse hammered so violently she feared everyone could hear it.

"Ms. Sterling," Alistair said icily, "All I require is the truth. Why are you behaving this way?"

Vanessa dropped her gaze, silently pleading with Nathan for intervention.

Nathan's expression darkened. Even now, he still protected Evelyn.

Using his authority as the eldest present, Alistair confronted Nathan. "That was your child Isabella carried! Your heir is gone, yet you show no remorse!"

"Instead, you shield the woman responsible. How can you face Isabella after this?"

"My apologies," Nathan responded coolly. "I'll personally oversee the investigation into this matter."

"An investigation?" Alistair scoffed. "Or another opportunity to protect her?"

Their heated exchange carried into Isabella's hospital room. Silent tears soaked her pillow as her fingers twisted the sheets.

Nathan's protection of Evelyn proved he cared nothing for their lost child.

Very well. If this was his choice, she'd drag Evelyn down with her—straight to hell.

"Grandfather—" Isabella's fragile voice shattered the standoff between the men.

"Isabella's awake!" Vanessa rushed into the room first.

"Isabella, how are you feeling?"

Isabella didn't respond. Tears welled in her eyes as she stared at Nathan. "Nate... our baby is gone..."

Nathan's face remained impassive, as if the tragedy meant nothing to him.

He approached the bed, studying her pallid face. "What really happened last night? How did you fall? I want the truth."

Isabella's tears fell faster, staining the pillow. "What are you implying? That I'd endanger our child?"

Nathan said nothing, his scrutinizing gaze never leaving her face. "Just the truth."

Her lips curled into a bitter smile. "You can't believe Evelyn would do this, can you?"

"But she pushed me! If not for her, I wouldn't have fallen. Wouldn't have lost the baby! She's responsible!"

Nathan regarded her dispassionately. "Is that so?"
###Chapter 122 A Lesson in Truth

Isabella's voice trembled with conviction. "Nathan, I know you might still have feelings for her. Those three years of marriage meant something."

Her hands clenched the hospital sheets. "But she's a monster! She's the one who pushed me. She murdered our unborn child!"

Nathan's expression remained unreadable. "Very well." His voice was ice. "If you insist she pushed you, we'll involve the authorities. Let the police conduct a thorough investigation. The truth will come out."

He turned toward the door, his broad shoulders tense beneath his tailored suit.

The door swung open before he could leave.

Evelyn stood framed in the doorway, arms crossed, her emerald eyes burning with quiet fury.

"Isabella lost control instantly. "Evelyn! How dare you show your face here?" Her scream echoed off the sterile walls.

Evelyn ignored the outburst. "I heard every word." Her gaze locked onto Isabella's. "Ms. Delaney, is this truly what happened?"

"You vicious witch! You killed my baby!" Isabella's face contorted with rage.

Evelyn's eyes darkened like a gathering storm, yet her voice remained measured. "Mind your language, Ms. Delaney. Even children know better than to make baseless accusations."

"I'm telling the truth! It was you! I'll have you arrested! I'll hire the best lawyers and make you pay!" Isabella's shrieks grew more hysterical.

Through the tirade, Evelyn remained perfectly composed. "No need to call the police." She stepped aside gracefully. "Officers? You may come in now."

Two uniformed officers entered the room, their badges glinting under the fluorescent lights.

Isabella's mouth fell open in shock, her face draining of color.
###Chapter 123 Masterful Performance

Isabella had been threatening to call the police, but she never expected them to arrive this quickly!

Evelyn had completely outmaneuvered her with this unexpected move.

"Ahhh! Leave! All of you, get out now!" Isabella clutched her ears and began shrieking, her composure completely shattered.

Nathan's expression darkened as he stepped forward to address the officers.

"She recently suffered a miscarriage and is emotionally fragile right now. I hope you'll understand."

The two officers exchanged glances but maintained their professional demeanor. "We received a report and need to assess the situation."

"My head! It's splitting open! Nathan, the pain is unbearable!" Isabella grabbed Nathan's arm dramatically.

"It feels like my skull is being crushed!"

"I'll call the doctor immediately," Nathan said, pressing the emergency call button.

Isabella was spiraling out of control. "Make them leave! I refuse to give any statements!"

Nathan hesitated before placing a stiff hand on her shoulder in a poor attempt at comfort.

Alistair intervened diplomatically. "Officers, as you can see, she's in no condition to answer questions after losing her child. Perhaps you could return when she's more stable."

Seeing the chaotic scene, the officers reluctantly agreed.

"Very well. We'll follow up later. Other officers are already investigating the reported incident."

"The results should be available soon. We'll return with that information."

"Thank you for your understanding," Alistair said, personally escorting them out.

Once the police left, Isabella shot Evelyn a venomous glare.

Evelyn smirked. "Why stop the performance now?"

"You vicious witch! Karma will destroy you!" Isabella spat with barely contained rage.

Evelyn's smile turned lethal. "The wicked always meet their downfall. The same to you, Ms. Delaney."

"You'll pay for my baby's life, you bitch!" Isabella's voice trembled with hysteria.

Evelyn remained calm. "Then why the theatrics for the police? You can delay, but you can't escape."

Without waiting for a response, Evelyn turned to leave.

Nathan moved to follow, but Isabella clung to his arm desperately. "Don't go!"

His patience was wearing thin. Isabella's earlier dramatics had revealed more truth than she realized.

The only reason he hadn't exposed her was lingering sentiment.

Strangely, despite losing their child, Nathan felt no grief - only an odd sense of relief.

"Isabella, you need rest after your miscarriage. I'll visit later."

"No!" Isabella's grip was surprisingly strong, tears streaming down her face in a calculated display of vulnerability.

Nathan shook her off impatiently and rushed after Evelyn without a backward glance.

Outside, Evelyn was intercepted in the corridor by Alistair.

"Ms. Carter, we need to talk." His tone left no room for refusal.
###Chapter 124 A Billion-Dollar Ultimatum

Evelyn Carter followed Alistair Delaney to the hospital's rooftop garden.

The crisp autumn air carried the scent of disinfectant from below. "What's this about, Mr. Delaney? If it's regarding Isabella's unfortunate accident, I believe we have nothing to discuss."

Alistair's piercing gaze studied her before speaking. "My team has reviewed the bar's surveillance footage."

"Interesting how the crucial moment wasn't captured. If Isabella maintains her accusation, how do you plan to disprove it?"

A wry smile touched Evelyn's lips.

"Truth has a way of surfacing. Though I see the Delaney influence still holds weight in certain circles." Her voice carried subtle derision.

Alistair straightened his tie. "The Kingsleys may dominate Frenda. But in Pamore? When the Delaneys want something done..."

He let the implication hang between them. "However, I didn't summon you here for confrontation. I propose a resolution beneficial to both parties."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Do enlighten me, Mr. Delaney."

"One billion dollars. Consider it compensation, and we'll drop all charges."

The audacity made Evelyn's pulse spike. A billion? The man had no shame.

"That's daylight robbery. Or should I take this as confirmation the Delaney empire is crumbling?" Her retort sliced through the tense air.

Alistair's grip tightened on his cane. "Merely compensation for my damaged heirloom ring."

Evelyn spread her hands in mock surrender. "How unfortunate. But no. I intend to see Isabella answer for her actions in court."

Her stance was unequivocal.

"So you choose war?" Alistair's voice turned glacial.

"I choose justice. We both know what truly happened that night. Isabella's misfortune was self-inflicted."

"Your word against hers. Without evidence, her testimony stands."

Evelyn turned to leave, pausing at the doorway. "Who says I lack evidence?"

The door clicked shut behind her. Alistair's knuckles whitened around his cane, his expression darkening.

Back in the private suite, he found Isabella weeping alone, Nathan Sterling conspicuously absent.

"Grandfather! I want that Kingsley bitch destroyed!" Isabella's tear-streaked face twisted with venom.

Alistair's voice dropped to a whisper. "Then we strike where she's vulnerable."

"Tell me how!"

The old man's eyes gleamed with calculated malice. A plan was already forming.

By afternoon, police returned for follow-up questioning. Isabella maintained her accusation with theatrical sobs.

Somehow, the scandal broke online. Within hours, #KingsleyHeiressScandal trended nationwide.

"OMG! The Kingsley princess pushed a pregnant woman? Even if it was an affair, that's cold!"

"A life is a life! That embryo deserved a chance. Disgusting behavior from high society."

"Homewrecker or not, violence against pregnant women is unforgivable. Evelyn Carter should face consequences!"

"Are you kidding? Cheaters' spawn don't deserve sympathy! Good riddance!"

The digital maelstrom grew fiercer by the minute.
###Chapter 125 Public Statement

The internet exploded with activity as netizens flooded Kingsley Industries' official Twitter account with comments.

Opinions varied wildly, turning the incident into the most talked-about scandal in recent memory.

Meanwhile, the Delaney family called an emergency press conference, gathering journalists from every major media outlet in Pamore.

Isabella Delaney stood before the cameras with tear-streaked cheeks, leveling shocking accusations against Evelyn Carter. She recounted in vivid detail how she'd been pushed, her words painting a damning picture.

"Ms. Delaney, can you confirm these allegations? Did Ms. Carter truly cause your miscarriage?" a reporter shouted.

Isabella nodded weakly, dabbing at her eyes with a tissue.

"Evelyn shoved me violently. I fell... and lost my baby." Her voice broke. "The doctors just informed me... the damage is permanent. I may never conceive again."

Her sobs echoed through the room.

The crowd stirred with sympathy for the weeping woman. Journalists exchanged pitying glances.

"Please, don't distress yourself, Ms. Delaney."

"Justice will prevail."

"Rest assured, the law won't protect criminals nor punish the innocent!"

Finally, Alistair Delaney stepped forward, his aged face etched with sorrow. "Our entire family mourns this tragic loss."

"Mr. Delaney, what actions will your family take next?"

"We demand accountability," Alistair declared solemnly. Then, unexpectedly, he softened his tone. "But we believe in redemption. We're willing to offer Ms. Carter an opportunity to make amends."

Murmurs spread through the press corps as Alistair addressed the cameras directly. "Ms. Carter, a sincere public apology to Isabella is all we require. No legal action will be taken."

His statement ignited fresh controversy online.

"The Delaneys show incredible mercy! After such tragedy, they only ask for an apology!"

"My respect for the Delaneys just grew tenfold."

"Something's off here. Why would they settle so easily? This doesn't add up."

"Let's wait for the other shoe to drop."

As the world waited for Evelyn's response, anticipation reached fever pitch.

The scandal had become the most sensational story of the year.

Less than sixty minutes after the Delaney press conference, Kingsley Industries' official website published a bombshell.

Security footage from the bar played clearly, showing the unedited events. The website nearly crashed from the traffic surge.

Though the audio was muffled, the video told a damning story: Isabella had been the aggressor, lunging at Evelyn.

Evelyn never laid a hand on her.

"This can't be! Isabella claimed Evelyn pushed her!"

"Clear as day - Isabella initiated contact! Evelyn didn't touch her!"

"I've rewatched this ten times. No push happened."

"Isabella lied! She tried manipulating public opinion. She never expected Evelyn to have the receipts!"

Following the video's release, Kingsley Industries issued an official statement that sent shockwaves through the city.
###Chapter 126 The Reckoning

The official statement from Kingsley Industries dropped like a bombshell.

"All allegations against Ms. Evelyn Carter are categorically false. At no point has she harmed any individual involved in this matter."

"Law enforcement has conducted thorough investigations with irrefutable evidence supporting these findings."

"Regarding the defamatory accusations made by Delaney Group, we reserve full legal rights to pursue compensatory action."

The internet erupted instantly.

"Talk about shooting yourself in the foot! The Delaneys just played their entire hand and lost spectacularly."

"Anyone with half a brain can see Evelyn's innocent. This was a blatant smear campaign that backfired horribly!"

"Not pressing charges? That reeks of guilt. They knew their case would crumble in court!"

But the real knockout punch came hours later.

A leaked audio recording surfaced - Alistair Delaney's private hospital conversation with Evelyn, demanding an outrageous settlement.

"One billion dollars? Is this some sick joke?"

"Daylight robbery doesn't even begin to cover it. The Delaneys have lost their damn minds!"

"At this point, Monopoly money would be more realistic. The audacity!"

The backlash was nuclear. Delaney Group's stock plummeted 10% within thirty minutes. By market close, shares hit the daily limit down.

Olivia Sinclair nearly choked on her champagne when she saw the trending topics. "Karma's a beautiful bitch, isn't it?"

Evelyn scrolled through the updates calmly. "Isabella's lost her pregnancy privilege. Bail revocation means she's going straight to remand."

"With our evidence? That's twenty years minimum."

A thoughtful pause. "Though it's curious Nathan hasn't made a peep. Wasn't that supposed to be his miracle baby?"

Evelyn's shrug was ice-cold. "Irrelevant. That chapter's closed permanently."

"Damn right!" Olivia tackled her with a celebratory hug. "Forget him! Harrison Whitmore's been eyeing you at every gala. Now there's a proper catch!"

Evelyn shook her head. "He's never been married. I'm divorced. That math doesn't work."

"Since when do you care about society's rules?" Olivia planted exaggerated kisses on her cheeks. "This new pragmatic you? Obsessed. Men are distractions. Money never is."

The fallout continued mercilessly. Isabella was escorted from her penthouse in handcuffs. Delaney Group's clients terminated contracts en masse.

Meanwhile, Kingsley Industries secured three major Delaney accounts before sunset.

The hunter had become the hunted.

And the prey had no escape.
###Chapter 127 The Enigmatic Horizon Technologies

"Why does Evelyn seem to thrive no matter what?" Julian's voice dripped with bitterness.

Never in his darkest nightmares had he envisioned Kingsley Industries, one of Pamore's top real estate giants, vanishing overnight. And all of it—every crumbling brick—was tied to Evelyn.

"Mr. Hawthorne, I must say Ms. Carter is audacious. That wager between you two—"

Julian cut him off sharply. "Enough! She's just a woman deluding herself into thinking she can survive in this cutthroat world. Let her dream!"

"Even if she's absorbed Kingsley Industries, it's still a speck compared to Sterling Enterprises. And utterly insignificant next to 30%!"

Yet, despite his words, Julian's eyes darkened.

No matter what, he couldn't lose this bet.

Evelyn had better watch her back.

Within a week, Kingsley Industries filed for bankruptcy.

But then, a shadowy figure quietly acquired its remnants, pouring vast resources into its revival. In just two weeks, a new entity—Horizon Technologies—exploded onto Pamore's corporate scene.

Soon, it cemented its dominance.

Rumors about Horizon Technologies spread like wildfire through Pamore’s elite circles.

"Horizon is shrouded in mystery! Their CEO hasn’t revealed a single detail!"

"I heard they have formidable backing. Only someone with immense power could rise this fast and swallow a third of Pamore’s market!"

"The Delaneys' downfall should’ve reshuffled the upper echelons. But Horizon’s emergence changed everything!"

Evelyn and Maxwell strode through the lobby, catching snippets of hushed conversations.

An hour later, stock prices hit rock bottom.

The Delaneys had become public enemy number one.

"Serves them right!" Olivia couldn’t resist commenting as she scrolled through the online vitriol.

"Isabella’s lost her pregnancy immunity. Bail’s off the table now."

"With the evidence we handed over, she’s looking at twenty years, easy."

Evelyn nodded. "Sounds fair."

"Strange, though—Nathan hasn’t uttered a word. Wasn’t that baby supposed to be his?"

Evelyn shrugged, indifferent.

"Whether he speaks or not, it changes nothing. Our paths won’t cross again."

"Exactly, darling! Plenty of fish in the sea. Harrison Whitmore seems lovely. Why not—"

At the mention of Harrison, Evelyn shook her head.

"He’s untethered. I’ve already been married. I won’t tarnish his reputation."

"Besides, why do I need a man? Building my empire sounds far more rewarding."

Olivia squeezed her, planting exaggerated kisses on her cheek. "God, I love this new you! Sharp as a blade!"

"Forget men. Let’s conquer the world instead!"

Soon after, Isabella was hauled away by police, the evidence against her airtight.

Meanwhile, the Delaneys faced relentless backlash. Clients abandoned them en masse.

Sterling Enterprises seized the opportunity, poaching several major accounts. In days, they secured massive deals.

As the elevator doors closed, Evelyn broke the silence. "The rumors about Horizon are everywhere."

Maxwell nodded. "Their mystique is fueling the frenzy. All of Pamore’s buzzing about their elusive CEO."

"Any leads?"

"None. Our investigations hit walls. Whoever’s behind Horizon is terrifyingly well-connected."

Evelyn exhaled, frustrated.

"Then they’re a formidable threat."

"Undoubtedly. Their sudden rise isn’t coincidence. When they make their move, it’ll be a storm."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened.

"Friend or foe, we tread carefully. Until we know their game, avoid direct clashes."

"Understood."

The doors opened.

Evelyn stepped out, heels clicking decisively. At her office, her secretary handed over the day’s agenda.

"Your schedule, Ms. Carter."

She skimmed it. "Good."

"Oh—one more thing. Horizon Technologies sent an invitation this morning."

Evelyn froze. "What kind of invitation?"

The secretary hurriedly presented it.
###Chapter 128 Haute Couture Gown

"The Horizon Technologies grand opening gala is in three days." Olivia Sinclair waved the embossed invitation with a flourish. "Every major corporation in Pamore received one, including Kingsley Industries."

Evelyn Carter studied the gold-foiled letters spelling "HT" on the thick cardstock. Horizon Technologies had been making waves in the business world lately.

This gala would be the social event of the season. The perfect opportunity to network and potentially secure new clients.

"Mark it on my calendar. I'll attend."

"Yes, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn immediately dialed Olivia's number. "Liv, I need you to pick out a showstopper from your boutique for the Horizon gala."

"Let me guess - the Horizon Technologies event?" Olivia's voice bubbled with excitement.

Evelyn's brows arched. "You know about it?"

"Darling, half my appointment book is filled with clients preparing for that gala! But don't worry, I've saved the most breathtaking piece for you. You'll outshine every socialite there!"

"I prefer subtle elegance."

"Consider it done. I'll handle everything."

The next morning, a velvet-clad package arrived at Evelyn's office. Inside lay an exquisite lavender haute couture gown that made her gasp. The intricate beadwork shimmered like morning dew.

"Ms. Carter, this is stunning! It complements your complexion perfectly!" her assistant gushed.

Evelyn's fingers traced the delicate embroidery as she texted Olivia: "This is magnificent! Your eye for design keeps getting sharper!"

Olivia's reply came instantly: "Darling, your gown is still at the boutique! I was planning to deliver it tomorrow before the event."

Confused, Evelyn snapped a photo. "Then whose creation is this?"

"Not mine!" Olivia responded.

Just as Evelyn frowned at the mystery, her phone lit up with a video call. "Aunt Beatrice!"

"Darling, did my little surprise arrive?" Beatrice Whitmore's eyes twinkled.

Realization dawned. "This masterpiece is from you?"

"What do you think? I commissioned it specially from a Parisian designer! Only the best for my favorite niece."

Evelyn's lips curved. "Are you psychic? How did you know I needed a gown? And the timing is impeccable!"

Beatrice's smile turned enigmatic. "Great minds think alike, darling. But you must wear it! I want to see all of Pamore gasp when you arrive."

Evelyn's suspicion grew. "How did you know about tomorrow's event?"

"Lucky guess." Beatrice laughed melodically before adding, "Wear the gown, darling!" and disconnecting.

Evelyn held the dress against herself, spinning before the mirror. "You and I will make quite the impression tomorrow."

The Horizon Technologies gala transformed Pamore's most luxurious seven-star hotel into a glittering wonderland. Crystal chandeliers cast diamond-like reflections across marble floors as the city's elite arrived in a parade of designer gowns and tuxedos.

As the event hour approached, the hotel's circular driveway became a showcase of rare automobiles, each more expensive than the last. Valets scrambled to accommodate the endless stream of luxury vehicles delivering Pamore's most powerful guests.
###Chapter 129 Shameless Bragging

Evelyn Carter stepped into the grand ballroom wearing a violet couture gown that shimmered under the chandeliers. Her twelve-inch Louboutins clicked confidently against the marble floor as every head turned in her direction.

The dress hugged her curves like liquid amethyst, accentuating her hourglass figure. With her hair swept up in an elegant chignon, diamond teardrop earrings caught the light with every graceful movement.

"Is that the Kingsley heiress? My God, she's breathtaking!" whispered a socialite behind her fan.

"That gown must be worth a fortune! Only Sophia Whitmore could design something so exquisite," her companion murmured back.

"Can you believe Nathan Sterling dumped this goddess for Isabella Delaney? The man must be clinically insane."

All eyes darted toward Nathan Sterling, who stood frozen near the champagne fountain. His gaze burned into Evelyn with undisguised hunger.

"Mr. Sterling!" Simon's sharp whisper broke Nathan's trance.

"I've made inquiries, but Horizon Technologies' president remains a ghost. The only lead suggests he might be from Frenda."

Simon wiped his brow. "But it's unverified. No one's seen him. We don't even know if he'll show tonight."

Nathan's jaw tightened. Half the elite here were vultures circling for a glimpse of Horizon's mysterious leader. That he couldn't uncover this man's identity gnawed at him.

"Keep watching. I want to know what game he's playing."

His attention snapped back to Evelyn, now effortlessly charming a circle of tycoons. This was the polished executive he remembered from Sterling Enterprises - confident, radiant, untouchable.

After collecting a stack of embossed business cards, Evelyn discreetly massaged her aching feet and retreated to a velvet settee.

"Ms. Carter! Rumor says Horizon's president is single!" Vanessa Sterling materialized with her sycophants, her emerald gown straining at the seams. "You should make your move tonight."

Eleanor had drilled into Vanessa that securing Horizon's elusive CEO would cement the Blackwell legacy.

"What if he's some troll?" giggled one follower. "Ms. Carter would be downgrading terribly."

Vanessa's chin jerked up. "Don't be absurd! He's..." She caught herself with a smug smile.

The group leaned in. No one had seen Horizon's leader - yet Vanessa spoke as if she knew something they didn't.
###Chapter 130 The Name Game

"You're kidding, Vanessa! Don't tell me you've already met this elusive CEO?"

"Darling, if you have, you've been keeping secrets!"

"Spill it now - what does this mysterious billionaire look like? Is he gorgeous?"

Vanessa studied their excited faces, her ego inflating like a balloon. Though she'd never laid eyes on the man, her imagination had already painted him as Adonis incarnate.

A man with that kind of power and influence simply couldn't be unattractive.

With shameless confidence, she declared, "I might as well confess. We've actually known each other for years!"

The group erupted in gasps.

"Vanessa, you absolute legend!"

"The Sterling heiress always gets exclusive access. I bet you're the only woman in all of New York who's seen his face!"

"Exactly! Tell us everything - what's he really like?"

Drunk on their admiration, Vanessa spun her web of lies without hesitation.

"He's devastatingly handsome, of course. Just extremely private - hates the spotlight. That's why there are so many rumors."

"But we're quite close. I'll introduce you when he arrives."

From her seat behind them, Evelyn Carter choked back laughter.

The sound drew immediate attention. Vanessa's eyes flashed with rage when she recognized her former sister-in-law. That mocking chuckle could only mean one thing.

"Vanessa, isn't that your ex-husband's little secretary? How rude!"

"I heard she's some Kingsley heiress now, but eavesdropping? Classless."

Vanessa sneered. "Something amusing you, Evelyn?"

Evelyn met her glare with amusement dancing in her eyes. "Forgive me. It was just too ridiculous not to laugh."

She addressed the women flanking Vanessa. "I wasn't eavesdropping. Your voices carry."

"How dare you! You're just jealous Vanessa knows the Horizon Technologies CEO - a man far beyond your reach."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow at Vanessa. "Is that so?"

Trapped by her own boast, Vanessa doubled down. "Of course it's true! Do I look like I joke about these things? We're very close."

Evelyn nodded slowly, then delivered the killing blow. "If you're so intimate, surely you can tell us his last name?"

Vanessa's mouth opened and closed like a fish.

She knew nothing about Horizon's CEO. How could she possibly name him?

Still, she blustered, "Why should I tell you?" The tremor in her voice betrayed her.

Evelyn pounced. "If you're truly 'close,' his surname would be common knowledge between you."

"I know it! I just choose not to tell you! I see what you're doing, Evelyn."

"You're trying to latch onto his coattails!"

"Dream on! A man like that wouldn't spare you a second glance!"
###Chapter 131 It's Harrison

Evelyn's lips curved into an amused smile as Vanessa ranted. "Do you honestly believe I need social climbing?" she asked, swirling her champagne flute.

The simple question struck like a dagger.

Vanessa's friends gasped. "She's the Kingsley heiress! CEO of Kingsley Industries!" one whispered loudly.

Evelyn's pedigree placed her in an entirely different stratosphere.

If anyone was setting social climbing standards, it was Evelyn Carter.

Vanessa's face darkened instantly.

Evelyn's smile remained unshaken as she added, "Though it seems someone here is desperately trying to scale those heights."

"You—!" Vanessa's voice turned shrill. "Nathan discarded you like trash! How dare you speak to me like this? I'll—"

"Vanessa." Nathan's commanding voice cut through the tension like a blade.

The crowd parted as he approached, his presence commanding immediate silence. Vanessa looked stunned that her brother would still defend Evelyn after everything.

"Nathan!" she protested.

His icy glare silenced her mid-sentence. When his gaze shifted to Evelyn, her expression remained coolly detached. Before he could speak, the ballroom lights dimmed dramatically.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd as all eyes turned toward the stage.

"Ladies and gentlemen," a booming voice announced, "welcome to Horizon Technologies' grand opening gala!"

The emcee commanded attention effortlessly. "Horizon's expansion into this market wouldn't be possible without your support. Together, we'll forge a brighter future!"

Polite applause filled the room, but whispers quickly overtook it.

"Where's the Horizon CEO? Why all the mystery?"

"This suspense is ridiculous!"

"I hope he lives up to the hype."

The speculation reached fever pitch when the emcee finally declared, "Please welcome Horizon Technologies' president—Mr. Harrison Whitmore!"

A collective gasp swept through the crowd. The name meant nothing to most attendees.

"Vanessa, Harrison? What an unusual name!" one friend giggled.

Vanessa's forced smile barely concealed her discomfort. "It's a distinguished name!" she snapped.

Her friends exchanged knowing looks. "Oh? Are you two already on a first-name basis?"

Vanessa preened, glancing pointedly at Evelyn. "Don't be absurd. Harrison and I merely move in the same circles."

She lowered her voice conspiratorially. "Though our families have been... encouraging certain possibilities. But it's early days—no gossip, understood?"

###Chapter 132 A Perfect Pair

Vanessa's bravado couldn't mask her growing panic. Meanwhile, Evelyn's reaction to Harrison's name was far more genuine—a fleeting moment of surprise before recognition dawned.

Beatrice's mysterious phone call suddenly made perfect sense.

Evelyn's lips curved knowingly as she drained her glass.

Every head turned as confident footsteps echoed through the silent ballroom. The mysterious figure remained shadowed until stage lights revealed him in breathtaking clarity.

His aubergine suit accentuated his towering frame. Chiseled features, piercing eyes, and an aura of absolute command left the crowd breathless.

"My God, he's magnificent!"

"Exactly my type!"

"Successful and gorgeous—is he single?"

Harrison ignored the adoration, his gaze sweeping the room until it locked onto Evelyn. Their silent acknowledgment passed between them like a private conversation.

"Vanessa! He's looking right at you!" a friend squealed.

Vanessa's head snapped up, but Harrison had already turned away. "Please, let's not make a scene," she muttered, desperate for an escape route.

On stage, Harrison's introduction was brief but electrifying. "Welcome to Horizon Technologies. I'm Harrison Whitmore."

The applause was thunderous. The mystery CEO's identity was finally revealed.

Dozens of executives swarmed him afterward, but Harrison politely dismissed them all. His path through the crowd was deliberate—straight toward where Evelyn stood.

"Vanessa, he's coming this way!" Her friends nearly vibrated with excitement.

Vanessa's panic spiked. What could she possibly say to him?

Then Harrison walked right past her.

"Hello, Evelyn," he said, his voice warm with familiarity. "Long time no see."

The crowd erupted in whispers.

"They know each other?"

"Look at their outfits—they're perfectly coordinated!"

Harrison chuckled at Evelyn's expression. "You didn't guess when Aunt Beatrice called?"

Evelyn smiled. "I had my suspicions. Though the reality is still... surprising."

"Pleasantly, I hope." His hand rose, gently tousling her hair in a gesture of obvious affection.

The intimate moment sent shockwaves through the ballroom. Every eye tracked them, every conversation centered on the implications of their connection. The social hierarchy had just been upended—and Vanessa's lies were crumbling before everyone's eyes.
###Chapter 133 The Truth Behind Your Boast

Evelyn gave a subtle nod. "Indeed, I am!"

The content of N?vel(D)rama.Org.

Little did they know, their exchange was causing stunned whispers among the surrounding crowd.

Everyone could clearly see the adoration in Harrison's eyes as he gazed at Evelyn. The intensity of his stare made them appear like long-lost lovers reunited.

Murmurs spread like wildfire, particularly because their coordinated outfits in identical shades created undeniable visual harmony.

"Are they actually together?" someone gasped, igniting immediate speculation.

Nathan stood nearby, his expression darkening instantly. His burning glare could have melted steel as he watched the pair.

"Mr. Whitmore, have you two met before?" one of Vanessa's companions dared to ask.

Harrison's eyes never left Evelyn as he replied, "We've known each other since childhood."

The revelation sent shockwaves through the gathering.

Since childhood?

That implied they'd grown up together!

This revelation made perfect sense. After all, Evelyn was the heiress to Kingsley Industries, one of the world's most powerful conglomerates.

Any man who shared her privileged upbringing would naturally possess comparable status. Wasn't Horizon Technologies' rapid expansion in Pamore proof enough?

Vanessa's face paled dramatically. Moments earlier, she'd been shamelessly boasting about her close ties to Harrison.

She never imagined Evelyn would be the true insider all along!

Vanessa wished the marble floors would swallow her whole in her humiliation.

"Evie, let me introduce you to someone special." Harrison extended his hand. Evelyn hesitated under the weight of countless staring eyes.

Accepting his hand publicly would undoubtedly spark rumors. While she didn't care for herself, she worried about consequences for Harrison.

Before she could refuse, Harrison decisively clasped her hand. His palm radiated comforting warmth against hers.

The mysterious CEO of Horizon Technologies had finally revealed himself!

Dozens of business magnates swarmed toward Harrison, but he politely declined their advances with practiced ease.

He moved purposefully through the crowd toward his singular focus.

"Vanessa, Harrison's coming over!" a friend squealed, tugging excitedly at her sleeve.

Vanessa froze in shock.

She never expected Harrison to approach her. What should she say? Nervousness overwhelmed her.

Then Harrison stopped before Evelyn, declaring for all to hear, "Hello, Evie. It's been too long."

The crowd erupted in astonished whispers.

"What's happening? Do Harrison and Evelyn know each other?"

"What's their relationship?"

"Look at their matching outfits! They're clearly a couple!"

Every eye in the room locked onto the pair as speculation ran wild.

Evelyn smiled knowingly. "I should have guessed when Aunt Beatrice called me. Still, this is quite unexpected."

Harrison reached out, affectionately tousling her hair.

"Unexpected? Or pleasantly surprised?"
###Chapter 134 Nathan Is Furious

Harrison didn't stop until they reached the far end of the hallway. "Go ahead. Your answers are waiting inside." With a gentle push, he opened the door and stepped through.

"Mr. Kingsley, I've brought Evelyn."

Evelyn gasped. Following Harrison's gaze, she saw Leonard seated in an armchair.

"Grandfather!" Her face lit up with joy as she rushed forward without hesitation, throwing herself into his embrace.

"Grandfather, why didn't you tell me you were coming to Sterling Enterprises?"

Leonard chuckled warmly. "I wanted it to be a surprise."

Beatrice's voice suddenly chimed in, making Evelyn jump. "I was the one who insisted on secrecy."

"Aunt Beatrice! You're here too!"

Beatrice stepped forward and playfully pinched Evelyn's nose. "How could I miss this? We heard all about your electrifying speech to the board!"

Evelyn's cheeks flushed pink. "That bet with Mr. Hawthorne isn't exactly confidential anymore. What's your next move?"

She gave a sheepish grin. "Work harder than ever to reach my target."

"Excellent attitude!" Leonard beamed. "That confidence reminds me of my younger self!"

"Now that Harrison is stationed at Sterling Enterprises too, you two can collaborate closely," Beatrice added. "Any work challenges, bring them to him."

Evelyn turned curious eyes toward Harrison. "So... you're leaving Fulton Group to manage Horizon Technologies here?"

Beatrice nodded. "Our families jointly invested in Horizon. Harrison will take temporary leadership."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn. The name "Horizon" and its initials "HT" suddenly made sense - a fusion of the Hartwell and Whitmore legacies.

Her eyes sparkled. "With Harrison backing me, I'll conquer Sterling Enterprises in no time!"

Harrison met her gaze, his affection undisguised.

When they reentered the grand hall arm-in-arm, every eye followed them. Harrison remained unbothered by the attention as he introduced Evelyn to Horizon's partners.

Since her divorce from Nathan, most of Sterling Enterprises' elite had kept their distance out of respect for the Blackwell family. But with Horizon's endorsement, attitudes shifted instantly. Several lucrative offers came Evelyn's way.

"See?" Harrison murmured in her ear. "These projects should keep you busy through next quarter."

Evelyn laughed softly. "Thank you for this incredible support! My 30% performance boost seems achievable now."

Harrison shook his head with an amused smile. "Aim higher."

"You're right. I've already gone all in - failure isn't an option now."

"Don't worry," he assured her. "With me here, no one can touch your position."

"I'll hold you to that," she teased.

Their easy camaraderie drew envious glances. Among the crowd, one pair of eyes remained fixed on them with unsettling intensity.

Nathan's expression darkened as he recalled being barred from following them earlier. Suppressed rage simmered in his gaze as he drained glass after glass.

The expensive wine tasted like ash on his tongue.

After countless refills, Nathan finally set down his glass with a decisive click and strode toward Evelyn.
###Chapter 135 Consumed By Envy

"Nathan!" Vanessa barely let him take three steps before cutting him off.

Nathan Sterling's face darkened with irritation. "What do you want?"

Vanessa's cheeks burned from the humiliation of her friends' mocking laughter. She needed Nathan to restore her pride.

In her mind, only her brother could help now. The Sterling name commanded respect throughout Pamore.

"Nathan, how well do you know Mr. Whitmore from Horizon Technologies?"

At Harrison's mention, Nathan's eyes turned glacial, his lips twisting into a sneer. "We're not acquainted. But someone here seems quite familiar with him."

Vanessa followed his gaze and spotted Evelyn Carter standing close to Harrison in the crowd.

Jealousy erupted inside her like wildfire, her nails digging into her palms.

"That witch Evelyn! She barely left your side before attaching herself to Horizon's CEO! The audacity!"

Especially with someone as distinguished as Harrison Whitmore. Evelyn didn't deserve to breathe the same air as him.

Nathan recognized the bitter envy in her voice - it mirrored his own. "You're interested in Harrison?"

Vanessa scoffed. "Don't you think it's criminal for a man like him to waste his time on Evelyn?"

Frustration gnawed at her. How did Evelyn always land such extraordinary men?

"Nathan, help me!"

He found her pathetic. "No."

Her face fell. "Still carrying a torch for your ex-wife? Is that why you're protecting her?"

"Not your concern!"

"Nathan!" Vanessa stamped her designer heel in frustration.

"Whatever you think, I'm determined to have Harrison!" Her declaration rang with conviction.

The memory of her friends' smirks fueled her determination. This was her only path to redemption.

Vanessa squared her shoulders. "I'm Vanessa Sterling. When I want something, I get it. And I will have Harrison Whitmore."

"Do as you please. But don't say I didn't warn you. Men crave what they can't have. Those who throw themselves at them end up..."

His words fell on deaf ears. Vanessa was already plotting her approach, barely registering his warning.

"Yeah, whatever."

With that, she marched toward Harrison and Evelyn.

"Mr. Whitmore! I've heard so much about your accomplishments!" Vanessa flashed her most dazzling smile.

As a Sterling heiress, Vanessa possessed striking beauty. She tilted her head coquettishly, certain no man could resist her charms.

Yet Harrison remained engrossed in conversation with several executives, oblivious to her presence.

Annoyance flickered across her face. "Mr. Whitmore? Vanessa Sterling of Sterling Enterprises. A pleasure."

The Sterling name finally caught his attention. Harrison's assessing glance immediately decoded her intentions.

He'd encountered countless women like her.

With deliberate casualness, Harrison pulled Evelyn closer. "Sterling who? Do you know these people?"

Evelyn suppressed an eye roll at Vanessa's blatant flirtation. "Ah, the Sterling heiress. My former sister-in-law."
###Chapter 136 Think Before You Speak

Harrison Whitmore's expression darkened instantly at Evelyn's words. His fingers tightened around the crystal tumbler, the amber liquid inside swirling violently.

The Sterling family's mistreatment of Evelyn still burned in his memory - how Eleanor and Vanessa had tormented her for years.

"Mr. Whitmore, what an honor!" Vanessa Sterling chirped, completely oblivious to the tension as she extended her manicured hand toward Harrison.

Her outstretched hand hung awkwardly in the air, receiving no response.

Flushing crimson, Vanessa withdrew her hand with forced composure. "To become CEO of Horizon Technologies at your age is truly remarkable."

"I was hoping Sterling Enterprises might have the privilege of working with your company."

Harrison's smile didn't reach his cold eyes. "Flattery won't change my mind, Ms. Sterling. We won't be collaborating."

The brutal rejection made Vanessa's smile falter.

Gasps rippled through the crowd. No one dared snub the Sterling family in Pamore this way.

Vanessa stood frozen, her carefully constructed mask slipping. Never in her life had she been publicly humiliated like this.

"Mr. Whitmore," she hissed through clenched teeth, "do you understand who you're speaking to? Crossing the Sterlings has consequences."

Her gaze flicked venomously toward Evelyn. "Unless... you're doing this for her?"

"My business decisions are none of your concern, Ms. Sterling."

Vanessa's eyes burned with jealous rage. How could Harrison defend this divorced nobody?

Was he blind?

"Do you even know what she is?" Vanessa spat. "That woman was nothing but a pathetic stray my family took in. Her very presence disgusts me."

CRACK!

The sharp sound of Evelyn's palm connecting with Vanessa's cheek echoed through the room.

Vanessa staggered back, clutching her stinging face in shock. "You dare strike me?"

She lunged forward, only to be intercepted by Harrison's iron grip.

"Compose yourself, Ms. Sterling," he warned coldly.

Evelyn's voice cut like ice. "That was for insulting my dignity. Consider it a lesson in manners."

"You'll regret this!" Vanessa struggled against Harrison's hold. "My family will make you pay!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "Can you truly speak for the Sterlings?"

The question gave Vanessa pause.

"Remember," Evelyn continued smoothly, "I have Kingsley Industries and the Carters behind me. Do you really think Nathan would challenge them... or sacrifice you to keep the peace?"

Each word struck Vanessa like a physical blow. The truth burned - she couldn't represent her family, and Nathan would never risk their empire for her pride.

"Vanessa," Evelyn said with chilling calm, "the world isn't kind to those who act without thinking. You should remember that."
###Chapter 137 Haven't You Humiliated Yourself Enough?

Harrison released Evelyn abruptly, leaving her seething with rage.

"You think you've won, Vanessa? Just wait—I'll make sure you're thrown out of Sterling Enterprises and left with nothing."

Evelyn couldn't help but smirk at the empty threat, her gaze drifting casually toward Nathan who stood nearby.

"Mr. Sterling," she said smoothly, "your sister appears to have overindulged. Perhaps you should escort her home before she makes more of a spectacle?"

Nathan strode forward, his expression thunderous as he gripped Vanessa's arm. "We're leaving."

"But Nate! I was defending your honor! Why are you—"

"Enough!" His voice cut through her protests. "Do you enjoy being the evening's entertainment?" The realization of their audience's judgmental stares finally silenced her.

A flush of shame crept up Vanessa's neck as she recalled her earlier outburst.

The siblings exited abruptly, Nathan practically dragging his humiliated sister through the gilded doors.

Once they'd gone, Harrison turned to Evelyn with concern. "Are you alright?"

She gave a small shake of her head. "Perfectly fine."

"Did she always treat you this way?" His voice held unexpected tenderness. "What kind of life did you endure these past years?"

Vanessa's behavior had shocked him more than he cared to admit. The thought of what Evelyn must have suffered twisted something in his chest.

"That life is over now." Her chin lifted slightly. "I won't be anyone's victim again."

Suddenly, Harrison pulled her into an embrace. "If she ever dares approach you again, I'll make certain she regrets it."

Warmth flooded Evelyn's chest. "Thank you, Harrison. You're like the brother I never had."

The word "brother" made his arms stiffen momentarily before he released her with a quiet sigh. His expression quickly schooled into neutrality.

"Think nothing of it. I made a promise to Mr. Kingsley to look after you."

Evelyn responded with a grateful nod.

"Actually," Harrison continued smoothly, "I have a meeting tomorrow regarding investments in quantum computing. Interested?"

The emerging quantum technology field had barely touched domestic markets—whoever established foothold now would reap tremendous rewards.

"What time? I'd love to join you."

"My driver will collect you at eight." Harrison produced two crystal glasses seemingly from nowhere. "To new ventures?"

Their glasses touched with a musical chime. "To lucrative partnerships."

Horizon Technologies' gala continued until nearly midnight. As guests departed, Evelyn found her evening had been remarkably productive—several influential figures had expressed interest in collaboration.

Just as she considered leaving, a poised woman approached. "Ms. Carter, may I see you home?" The woman's tone held professional deference.

Her tailored suit spoke of quiet confidence, her makeup accentuating striking features.

Evelyn arched a brow. "And you are...?"

"Diana Chamberlain," she introduced with practiced grace. "Mr. Whitmore's assistant. He's currently detained, but asked that I ensure your comfort."

As she spoke, Diana's sharp eyes discreetly assessed Evelyn. After years as Harrison's right hand, she'd witnessed countless women come and go—yet none had ever commanded his attention quite like this one.
###Chapter 138 The Inevitable Rivalry

Evelyn offered a polite smile as she declined. "That won't be necessary, Ms. Chamberlain. My ride should be arriving any moment now."

"At least let me escort you out," Diana insisted, already gesturing toward the exit before Evelyn could protest further.

With a gracious nod, Evelyn turned on her designer heels and made her way toward the lobby.

At the main entrance, Harrison stood conversing with several executives from Horizon Technologies. His gaze casually drifted across the room, landing on Evelyn's approaching figure.

"Excellent, Mr. Montgomery. We'll finalize the details for the quantum computing initiative tomorrow at your office."

"Looking forward to it, Mr. Whitmore."

After bidding farewell to the businessmen, Harrison swiftly crossed the marble floor toward Evelyn. Noticing her bare shoulders against the evening chill, he immediately shrugged off his tailored jacket. "The temperature's dropped considerably."

His hands lingered momentarily as he draped the garment over her shoulders.

Diana observed the exchange with practiced composure, though inwardly startled by Harrison's uncharacteristic display of tenderness.

"My car's here," Evelyn announced, spotting the familiar black sedan pulling up.

"Until tomorrow, Harrison."

He responded with a quiet hum of acknowledgment, watching carefully as she settled into the vehicle before raising his hand in farewell.

Only when the taillights disappeared around the corner did Harrison finally turn away.

The next morning found Evelyn's personal driver waiting at the curb outside her townhouse.

She emerged dressed in a sharply tailored pantsuit, her makeup flawless and professional. The moment she slid into the leather seat, the driver handed her a thick dossier.

"Ms. Carter, Mr. Whitmore requested you review these before the meeting."

Flipping through the pages, Evelyn's eyes lit up at the detailed reports on the quantum computing project. "How thoughtful of him."

As the car pulled into traffic, she immersed herself in the documents.

Their destination was Nexa Group - a multinational leader in quantum technology development.

The moment the car stopped at the corporate plaza, Evelyn stepped out.

Simultaneously, a sleek black limousine pulled up beside them. The tinted window lowered to reveal Simon's familiar profile.

"What an unexpected pleasure, Ms. Carter!" he greeted cheerfully.

Evelyn's smile froze momentarily.

If Simon was here, Nathan couldn't be far behind.

At that moment, she couldn't help thinking the business world was frustratingly small. "Quite the coincidence, Simon."

Simon adjusted his glasses with a knowing look. "Don't tell me you're here for the quantum computing presentation too."

Evelyn thought wryly, "Some rivalries are simply unavoidable."

Before she could respond, Nathan's commanding voice came from the backseat. "Park the car, Simon. We're going in."

"Right away, Mr. Sterling."

When Nathan emerged, his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Quantum technology? It appears we're competitors today, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn masked her surprise - she hadn't known Sterling Enterprises had ventured into this cutting-edge field.

But years of practice kept her expression neutral. "Then may the best proposal win."

With that, she turned toward the gleaming Nexa Group headquarters.

Nathan watched her retreating form with amusement before following at a measured pace.

"Ms. Carter, Mr. Montgomery is expecting you. Please follow me."

The receptionist escorted them to the seventeenth-floor conference room. Evelyn deliberately chose a seat as far from Nathan as possible.
###Chapter 139 His Shield

The moment Evelyn Carter settled into her chair, the conference room doors swung open. A sharp click of stilettos announced the arrival of a woman in her early thirties. Her designer glasses perched on a nose held high, exuding icy professionalism.

She carried a stack of files like weapons, addressing Nathan Sterling the second she entered. "Mr. Sterling, what an unexpected pleasure."

Nathan's gaze lifted, one eyebrow arching in recognition. "Ms. Sinclair."

Victoria Sinclair, Nexa Group's tech director, gave a curt nod before turning laser-focused eyes on Evelyn. Disdain dripped from her voice. "And this must be the famous Ms. Carter?"

Every syllable carried venom.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her pen. She'd never met this woman, yet the hostility was palpable. "Evelyn Carter. A pleasure."

Victoria's arms crossed like a barricade. "Oh, I know exactly who you are. Mr. Sterling's discarded wife."

The temperature in the room plummeted.

"At such a tender age, you've somehow landed the presidency of Kingsley Industries." Victoria's smirk was razor-sharp. "I'm curious - how much do you actually know about quantum computing? Or are you just a pretty figurehead propped up by family connections?"

Evelyn kept her voice steady. "I'm familiar with the fundamentals."

Victoria's eyes flashed. She'd come specifically for this - to humiliate the woman who'd married then divorced her cousin's lover. When Nexa proposed collaborating with Kingsley, she'd seized the opportunity.

"Business isn't child's play, Ms. Carter. If you're out of your depth, do us all a favor and resign before you embarrass yourself further."

Evelyn's smile didn't waver. "Constructive criticism is always welcome, Ms. Sinclair. I'm here to learn."

Victoria slammed her palms on the table. "Learn? Is that what you call wasting our time?" Her voice turned lethal. "Are Kingsley's standards so low they'd send an amateur to negotiate with Nexa? Or is this your idea of a joke?"

The door burst open before Evelyn could respond.

"Ms. Sinclair, you're misinterpreting the situation." Harrison Whitmore strode in, his custom Tom Ford suit hugging broad shoulders. The air crackled with his presence.

Victoria's haughty demeanor shattered. "Mr. Whitmore!" Her voice climbed an octave.

Harrison ignored her, pulling out the chair beside Evelyn. His knee brushed hers as he sat. "Evelyn's here at my personal invitation." He steepled his fingers. "Horizon Technologies fully endorses Kingsley's participation. Unless you're questioning my judgment?"

The unspoken threat hung heavy.

Victoria backpedaled instantly. "Of course not! I merely—"

"Merely what?" Harrison's gaze turned glacial. "Attempting to sabotage a potential partner before negotiations begin?"

Victoria's throat worked. She'd never anticipated Evelyn having Harrison Whitmore's protection. The man was a myth in their circles - untouchable. What was their relationship? The divorce from Nathan had only just been finalized...

The implications made her palms sweat.
###Chapter 140 The Forced Apology

Victoria couldn't shake the thought of how Evelyn had manipulated Harrison into taking her side with such alarming speed.

Her cousin Isabella had warned her about Evelyn's meddling in her relationship with Nathan.

The realization hit her hard. "Isabella was right all along. This woman is dangerous."

Swallowing her pride, Victoria forced out an apology through gritted teeth. "My apologies, Mr. Whitmore. That was inappropriate of me. Please forgive—"

"You're apologizing to the wrong person, Ms. Sinclair," Harrison interrupted coldly.

Victoria's breath caught in her throat. Apologizing to Evelyn? Impossible.

In her mind, Evelyn was solely responsible for the Delaney family's downfall and Isabella's imprisonment. She'd come here today to make Evelyn pay.

"But Mr. Whitmore, I—"

Harrison's fingers drummed an ominous rhythm on the conference table. The air grew thick with tension.

His patience had worn thin. Seeing Victoria's stubborn refusal, he stood abruptly, straightening his suit jacket.

"Then this meeting is over. Horizon Technologies has no shortage of potential partners."

"No, wait!" Victoria nearly tripped in her haste to stop him.

Her company had invested billions in this nanotechnology venture. Failure meant unemployment.

"I... apologize, Ms. Carter," she choked out, each word tasting like ash. Losing this deal wasn't an option.

Evelyn wasn't inclined to forgive easily, but the strategic importance of this partnership outweighed personal grievances.

"Apology accepted, Ms. Sinclair."

Their eyes met briefly, and Evelyn felt an unexpected warmth at having someone defend her so fiercely.

Nathan had been ready to intervene, but Harrison had beaten him to it.

Watching another man protect Evelyn left Nathan with a hollow ache, as if he'd lost something precious.

Simon observed the exchange with growing concern for Nathan.

Something fundamental had shifted between Nathan and Evelyn, and there was no going back.

"My sincere apologies for the delay," Theodore Montgomery announced as he entered briskly. "Another meeting ran over."

"Not at all, Mr. Montgomery," Nathan responded first.

Theodore acknowledged Nathan with a polite nod before approaching Harrison. "Mr. Whitmore, thank you for your patience. Shall we begin?"

Only after Harrison's subtle nod did Theodore take his seat.

Victoria watched in shock as her superior treated Harrison with more deference than he showed Nathan.

She'd known Horizon Technologies had powerful backing, but never imagined Theodore would be so visibly intimidated.

Her nails dug into her palms as she glared at Evelyn. No wonder Isabella had failed against this woman.

But Victoria wasn't like her cousin.

"Ms. Sinclair here is our lead director for this project," Theodore announced. "She'll present our preliminary findings and initial preparations."

Composing herself, Victoria rose to address the room.
###Chapter 141 Victoria's Challenge

"First, I'd like to express my gratitude for this opportunity. Nanotechnology represents the cutting edge of modern innovation—"

Victoria stood center stage with effortless poise, her manicured fingers gliding across the tablet to advance her slides.

Her credentials as Nexa's Technical Director were undeniable. Every statistic, every projection flowed with practiced precision, showcasing her mastery of the subject.

As she concluded, she tapped her tablet screen closed with a satisfied smile.

"These are our preliminary findings. I welcome any questions or insights from our distinguished colleagues."

Her gaze swept across the boardroom, lingering pointedly on Evelyn.

"Ms. Carter, as President of Kingsley Industries, your perspective would be particularly valuable. Would you care to share your thoughts?"

The abrupt invitation turned every head toward Evelyn.

Evelyn caught the challenge in Victoria's eyes but remained composed, merely arching one sculpted brow in response.

When Evelyn didn't immediately speak, Victoria's lips curled. Clearly, the woman was out of her depth—probably hadn't understood half the technical specifications.

"Actually," Evelyn finally said, her voice smooth as aged whiskey, "Ms. Sinclair's presentation was remarkably thorough. I find little to critique."

Victoria's triumph flared. Just as she'd suspected—the so-called president was nothing but a pretty face playing executive.

But she wouldn't let Evelyn escape so easily.

"Please, Ms. Carter," Victoria purred, "your modesty does you no favors. Those of us new to this sector could learn much from your... extensive experience."

The barb about Evelyn's youth and inexperience hung in the air, sparking murmurs around the conference table.

Nathan's knuckles whitened around his pen. His warning glare went ignored.

"While you may be young," Victoria pressed on, "I'm certain someone in your position must have unique insights. Consider it a learning opportunity for us all."

The room hushed. All eyes locked onto Evelyn.

Nathan suppressed a smirk. He'd witnessed Evelyn dismantle far more formidable opponents during her years as his secretary. This would be entertaining.

Evelyn rose with the grace of a panther uncoiling from repose.

"Since Ms. Sinclair insists," she said, moving toward the display screen with predatory elegance.

Victoria crossed her arms, smirk firmly in place. The stage was set for Evelyn's humiliation.

Evelyn tapped the tablet, bringing Victoria's presentation back to life. "The proposed methodology demonstrates impressive innovation," she began, tracing a fingertip along a data stream. "The market analysis is particularly robust."

She pivoted to face the room. "Ms. Sinclair has done exceptional work contextualizing this venture's potential."

Then her finger froze on a slide. "Though I do wonder—" Her nail tapped a seemingly innocuous figure. "—if the projected 47% yield accounts for the recent FDA regulatory changes?"

Victoria's smile faltered.

Evelyn continued before she could respond. "And while the Singapore trial results are promising," she swiped to another slide, "have we considered how the seasonal monsoon patterns might impact production timelines?"

A beat of silence. Then another.

Victoria's manicure dug into her forearm. Every supposed flaw Evelyn highlighted was devastatingly accurate.

The board members began murmuring, some reaching for tablets to verify the claims.

Evelyn leaned casually against the presentation table. "Of course, these are minor considerations. Overall, Ms. Sinclair's work is..." Her lips curved. "...quite adequate for a first attempt."
###Chapter 142 Underestimated Evelyn

Evelyn's voice carried effortlessly across the boardroom, crisp and professional. Her poised demeanor instantly commanded respect from the assembled executives.

"However, there are several critical oversights we should address."

The sudden shift in her tone sent murmurs rippling through the room. Eyebrows raised as colleagues exchanged skeptical glances.

"What exactly are you referring to, Ms. Carter?" Victoria's voice cut through the tension, laced with barely concealed irritation.

She had spent weeks perfecting every slide, triple-checking each data point. The thought of Evelyn - someone she considered utterly unqualified - daring to critique her work made her blood boil.

"Ms. Carter, I invited you as Kingsley Industries' president, not as some amateur critic. How dare you speak with such authority when you clearly lack basic understanding!"

Victoria's words hung in the air, sharp as knives. In her field, she was considered elite - lightyears ahead of someone like Evelyn.

Theodore began nervously mopping his brow, stepping forward as mediator. "Ms. Sinclair, perhaps we should hear Ms. Carter's perspective first?"

His eyes darted toward Harrison, seeking support. The CEO remained impassive, though his gaze never left Evelyn.

"Ms. Sinclair," Harrison interjected smoothly, "there's no need for hostility. I'm certain Ms. Carter has substantive feedback, not petty criticisms."

Victoria's cheeks flushed crimson. "By all means," she spat, crossing her arms.

Evelyn remained unruffled, flipping to the first slide with elegant precision. "The primary error is fundamental - you've conflated 'nanobiotechnology' with 'nanobiological theory.' They're completely distinct disciplines."

A collective gasp filled the room. Even junior staff recognized this basic distinction.

Victoria's face drained of color. Such an elementary mistake - and she'd missed it completely.

Nathan suppressed a smile. Evelyn's attention to detail surpassed even his own, let alone Victoria's.

"Though this is merely the most obvious example," Evelyn continued, methodically advancing through the presentation. With each slide, she exposed another flaw - some subtle, others glaring.

The atmosphere grew electric, executives leaning forward in their seats.

Victoria swayed slightly, her assistant's steadying hand the only thing preventing her collapse. Each pointed critique landed like a physical blow, dismantling her professional pride slide by devastating slide.
###Chapter 143 She Crushed It

"Ms. Sinclair, are you alright?" Theodore couldn't hide his concern while silently worrying for Victoria.

Evelyn had demonstrated remarkable competence, shattering Victoria's assumption that she was clueless.

Victoria's fingers curled into tight fists as she glared at Evelyn with burning intensity, but she managed to restrain herself.

"I'm fine."

After Evelyn finished her detailed explanation, the room erupted with questions and discussions.

She answered each query with confidence, supplementing with insightful details that earned unanimous admiration from everyone present.

This was a lesson—delivered flawlessly.

Applause broke out, and Nathan was the first to rise. His gaze held unmistakable admiration. "Your expertise remains as sharp as when you worked for Sterling Enterprises."

The moment those words left his lips, murmurs spread through the room like wildfire.

"Ms. Carter used to work for Sterling Enterprises?"

"Sterling Enterprises has notoriously high standards. If she not only worked there but excelled, her skills must be exceptional."

"How could someone who thrived at Sterling Enterprises be incompetent? We misjudged her."

"I thought she was just a spoiled socialite, but she’s the real deal."

Each comment felt like a stinging slap to Victoria’s pride.

"Ms. Sinclair, if your proposal has been reviewed multiple times, why does it still contain so many errors?" Nathan pressed, striking at the heart of the issue.

Despite the glaring flaws in Victoria’s proposal, no one had pointed them out before. Why?

Nervously, Victoria glanced at Theodore, but he deliberately avoided her gaze.

Lowering her eyes, she forced humility into her voice. "My apologies. The oversight was mine. I’ll make the necessary corrections immediately."

Nathan, however, wasn’t satisfied. "Ms. Sinclair, perhaps you should focus less on undermining others and more on refining your own professionalism."

The implication was clear—he was calling out her hostility toward Evelyn.

Victoria stiffened, rendered speechless. She stared at Nathan in disbelief. Even after their divorce, he was still defending Evelyn.

What did Isabella truly mean to him?

"Given the circumstances, there’s no need to continue this meeting. We’ll reconsider investment once Nexa Group submits a properly prepared proposal." Harrison’s voice cut through the tension.

As the most influential figure in the room, his word was final. With that, he stood, signaling the end of the discussion.

"Let’s go, Evelyn."

Without hesitation, Evelyn followed. She had only attended this meeting for Harrison’s sake. Nexa Group’s lack of professionalism and their error-riddled proposal had sealed their fate.

There was no point in wasting further time.

"Of course, Harrison," she replied smoothly.

The two exited the conference room, leaving a stunned silence in their wake.

Theodore, realizing the meeting had spiraled out of control, hurried after them. "Mr. Whitmore, I believe there’s been a misunderstanding—"
###Chapter 144 Shattered Alliance

Theodore rushed to intercept them just as the elevator doors began to close.

"Mr. Whitmore! Kingsley Industries has poured significant resources into this venture." His voice carried a desperate edge. "If Sterling Enterprises backs out now, it could cripple our operations. Please reconsider."

Harrison and Evelyn exchanged silent glances.

With each passing floor, Theodore's window of opportunity narrowed. Sweat beaded on his forehead as he scrambled for persuasive words.

"Ms. Carter, I sincerely apologize for today's unfortunate incident. Successful partnerships require—"

The elevator chimed. The couple stepped inside without hesitation.

"That will be all, Mr. Montgomery." Evelyn's tone left no room for negotiation.

The doors slid shut, cutting off Theodore's final plea. His shoulders slumped in defeat.

Nathan approached with Simon in tow. "Theodore."

Theodore startled at the unexpected address. "Mr. Sterling?"

Nathan adjusted his cufflinks with deliberate calm. "Today's... demonstration was quite illuminating. Let's ensure such theatrics don't become habitual in our professional circles."

Theodore swallowed hard. "Surely we can find some compromise—"

"Effective leadership requires discernment in personnel decisions." Nathan's gaze turned steely. "I trust I don't need to elaborate further."

Understanding dawned on Theodore's face. He nodded vigorously.

Once the Sterling entourage departed, Theodore summoned Victoria to his office.

"Sir, I can expl—" Her words dissolved into a sharp gasp as Theodore's palm connected with her cheek.

Victoria clutched her stinging face, eyes wide with shock.

"Do you comprehend the magnitude of your blunder today?" Theodore's voice trembled with suppressed rage.

Victoria stared at the floor. The situation had spiraled far beyond her expectations.

"My behavior was unacceptable. I'll make amends." Her contrition rang hollow.

Theodore's jaw tightened. Victoria wasn't typically this reckless. "What's your history with Ms. Carter?"

Silence.

Theodore slammed his fist against the mahogany desk. "Effective immediately, you're relieved of all responsibilities. Indefinite suspension."

"Sir!" Panic laced Victoria's voice. "This isn't what it seems! Let me—"

"Enough!" Theodore massaged his temples. "Get out."

Victoria exited under the weight of her colleagues' judgmental stares. The office door slammed behind her with finality.

Alone, she dialed a familiar number with trembling fingers. "Uncle..."

Her voice cracked as months of pent-up frustration came pouring out.

Meanwhile, Harrison and Evelyn emerged into golden afternoon light. As they walked, Harrison shared his findings.

"Victoria Sinclair is connected to the Delaneys. Isabella's her cousin."

Evelyn's lips curved in sudden understanding. "That explains today's theatrics."

A dry chuckle escaped her as the pieces fell into place.
###Chapter 145 Was I the Villain?

"But I came prepared, thanks to you." Evelyn's fingers tightened around her purse straps. "You gave me the nanotechnology intel beforehand. Otherwise, Victoria might have completely humiliated me today."

The conference room's glass walls reflected Harrison's smirk as he leaned against the marble table. "So, Evelyn... Are we still moving forward with Nexa on this collaboration?"

Nathan's shadow fell across the doorway just as Harrison reached out to tousle Evelyn's hair. His touch lingered a second too long, fingertips brushing her cheek. "What do you think, darling?"

Evelyn stepped back, putting professional distance between them. "Business is business. Personal feelings shouldn't interfere."

Harrison's chuckle vibrated through the air conditioning. "Exactly. Though Nexa will need to prove their sincerity first." His gaze dropped to her lips. "But before we continue... I've been meaning to ask you something."

Sunlight caught the gold flecks in Evelyn's widened eyes, making Nathan's breath hitch from his hidden vantage point.

"From now on," Harrison traced the edge of his tie, "call me Harry. Everyone uses Harrison. It's so... impersonal."

"Harry?" The unfamiliar nickname tasted strange on Evelyn's tongue.

Harrison's dimple appeared. "Just like that."

Evelyn's stomach twisted. Twenty-eight years of calling him Harrison couldn't be undone in one conversation. "It feels... wrong."

"You'll adjust." His confidence was infuriating. "Come on, I'll drive you home."

When his large hand engulfed hers, Evelyn instinctively flinched. Harrison's grip tightened, his palm radiating heat that reminded her too sharply of Nathan's habitual coldness.

Across the lobby, Nathan's knuckles turned white around his car keys. Simon barely dared to breathe beside him.

"Mr. Sterling... Should we head back to the office?"

Nathan didn't move. Even after the elevator doors swallowed Evelyn and Harrison, the glacial fury in his posture remained. When he finally spoke, his voice cracked. "Simon... Tell me honestly. Was I the villain in her story?"

Simon's tie suddenly felt too tight. The truth - about the affairs, the neglect, the Isabella debacle - stuck in his throat. He'd never seen Nathan's armor this shattered.

"Sir... We've all made mistakes. What matters now is-"

"Don't." Nathan's laugh was bitter. "Just tell me - is there any chance she could forgive me? After everything?"

Simon chose his words like stepping through a minefield. "Ms. Carter has a compassionate heart. But sir... The baby with Ms. Delaney..."

Nathan's shoulders slumped. "You think she even cares about that anymore?"

The unspoken answer hung between them as Nathan's reflection stared back from the polished marble - a ghost of the man who'd once held Evelyn's heart.
###Chapter 146 The Defeat of Julian Hawthorne

"No woman would ever accept a third person in her marriage, and Ms. Carter is certainly no different."

That might have been true for the Evelyn who was blindly devoted to Nathan. But now?

Everything had changed.

Nathan drew a deep breath, his momentary despair vanishing instantly. The defeated man from moments ago might as well have been an illusion.

"Let's go, Simon." With that, Nathan strode away.

The moment Evelyn returned to her Kingsley Industries office, an uninvited guest arrived.

Julian Hawthorne had received inside information about the failed collaboration between Kingsley Industries and Nexa Group.

Delighted by the news, he couldn't resist paying Evelyn a visit to witness her failure firsthand.

"Ms. Carter! You look positively exhausted. Work must be weighing heavily on you!" His voice dripped with barely concealed glee.

Without looking up, Evelyn replied, "You seem to have ample free time to wander into my office, Director Hawthorne."

With a smug half-smile, Julian pulled out a chair and sat across from her. "Success takes time, my dear. Rome wasn't built in a day. Though it is unfortunate you lost the Nexa Group deal."

Evelyn's hands stilled at his words.

Closing the file in her hands, she met his gaze squarely. "You're remarkably well-informed, Director Hawthorne. But aren't you celebrating prematurely?"

Julian burst into laughter.

"Quite right, Ms. Carter. We still have months before our one-year deadline. But achieving 30% growth isn't simple - setbacks are inevitable. I'm merely here to offer my... concern for both you and the company."

His arrogant tone made Evelyn's skin crawl. Julian stood, straightening his suit jacket.

"The young must learn through experience, no? After this lesson, I'm sure you'll grow - to Kingsley Industries' benefit."

Just then, a knock interrupted them.

Maxwell entered, glancing briefly at Julian before addressing Evelyn. "Ms. Carter, Mr. Montgomery from Nexa Group sent over a revised contract. They're offering a 5% profit concession to amend—"

Julian's triumphant expression shattered.

This development blindsided him completely.

His sources had confirmed Nexa Group's refusal to work with Kingsley Industries. How could they now be offering better terms?

Meanwhile, Evelyn couldn't suppress a smile. Theodore Montgomery was proving more astute than she'd anticipated - a true business mastermind.

Raising an eyebrow at Julian, she said lightly, "I'm afraid I must disappoint you, Director Hawthorne. The Nexa Group collaboration is secured."

Julian's jaw clenched, but he forced a tight smile. "You've done... remarkably well, Ms. Carter."

With that, he stormed out.

Watching his furious exit, Evelyn barely contained her laughter. Turning to Maxwell, she asked, "Is this truly Nexa Group's decision?"

###Chapter 147 Unexpected Revelations

Maxwell placed the contract before Evelyn. "See for yourself."

Evelyn hadn't expected such generosity from Nexa Group.

"Very well, we'll tentatively accept these terms. But we'll finalize everything during our next meeting with them."

"Yes, Ms. Carter."

With this matter resolved, Evelyn's mood lifted instantly. Energized, she threw herself back into work with renewed focus.

So absorbed was she that she didn't notice someone entering her office quietly.

Olivia watched Evelyn's intense concentration with disbelief. She'd never seen her friend so immersed in work.

Approaching the desk, Olivia tapped it several times. Without looking up, Evelyn said, "Yes, Maxwell? Could you bring me some coffee?"

Olivia rolled her eyes.

Only when silence followed did Evelyn glance up, her eyes widening in surprise. "Olivia? What are you doing here?"

"Who did you think I was?" Olivia sighed.

Evelyn quickly set aside her documents and stood, taking Olivia's arm. "Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I assumed you were Maxwell."

"I called you repeatedly," Olivia pointed out.

Evelyn checked her phone and winced at the multiple missed calls. "Sorry! My phone was on silent."

Olivia waved it off. "Never mind, you workaholic. You've completely forgotten about our spa appointment, haven't you?"

Guilt flashed across Evelyn's face. "I'm so sorry, Olivia."

Seeing her friend's exhaustion, Olivia softened. "It's fine. But your skin's been looking terrible lately. Let's go get pampered."

Only then did Evelyn realize how neglected her complexion had become. "You're right. I desperately need some self-care."

Without further protest, she accompanied Olivia to an upscale spa nearby.

They booked a VIP suite for full treatments, emerging completely relaxed afterward.

Just as they were settling in to rest, voices carried from the adjacent room.

"We should enjoy this rare outing to the fullest." The speaker was unmistakably Eleanor. Though they hadn't seen her in months, her haughty tone was unforgettable.

"Mrs. Blackwell, you've become quite the elusive figure since discovering your daughter-in-law is heir to the Kingsley fortune!"

News of Evelyn's true lineage as Leonard Kingsley's granddaughter had spread like wildfire through elite circles.

Among society women, no secret remained hidden for long, and gossip about Eleanor's past mistreatment of Evelyn circulated freely.

Eleanor had frequently complained about Evelyn's shortcomings and belittled her before friends. Now that Evelyn's status was revealed, these women relished Eleanor's discomfort.

"Mrs. Blackwell, you really should introduce your daughter-in-law to us. One never knows when such connections might prove useful."
###Chapter 148 A Mother's Love I Never Knew

"That's absolutely correct. I heard your daughter-in-law has launched an avant-garde boutique with exclusive designs. The place is constantly packed with customers."

"Mrs. Blackwell, since we're such close friends, why don't you arrange a private shopping experience at her store for us?"

Eleanor Blackwell listened silently as the socialites gushed about Evelyn Carter's accomplishments. Her expression darkened visibly.

She had always believed Evelyn was just some orphan from the sticks. That misconception had led her to treat the girl terribly, even forcing her to...

Now that Evelyn's true identity as a Kingsley heiress had been revealed, Eleanor was drowning in regret.

If only she'd shown Evelyn basic kindness, she wouldn't be suffering this humiliation now.

"Cat got your tongue, Mrs. Blackwell? Can you make this happen? I'll bring my entire book club - we'd love to support your daughter-in-law's business."

Eleanor cleared her throat awkwardly. "I prefer not to interfere with the younger generation's affairs."

"Oh come now, Mrs. Blackwell. This is your daughter-in-law we're talking about. Surely she'd jump at your request."

"Unless... you have no influence over her at all? How embarrassing would that be?"

The veiled challenge struck Eleanor's pride like a slap.

As someone who valued her social standing, she knew offending these women would make her a pariah in their circles.

With forced cheerfulness, Eleanor responded, "Don't be ridiculous. Of course Evelyn listens to me. Shopping trip? Consider it done."

"Mrs. Blackwell, I've heard your daughter-in-law does exquisite custom designs. Could she create something special for me?"

"Absolutely," Eleanor declared confidently. "I'll have her personally handle your order."

"You're so wonderful, Mrs. Blackwell. You must have the most loving relationship with your daughter-in-law."

The question made Eleanor squirm internally.

She'd spent years badmouthing Evelyn to these very women, calling her unworthy of Nathan and the Blackwell name.

With Evelyn absent, Eleanor lied shamelessly: "Of course! Evelyn and I have always been close. I've treated her like my own flesh and blood."

Overhearing this from the next room, Olivia Sinclair nearly choked. "The audacity! After everything she's done to you."

"Now that she knows who you really are, she's singing a different tune. Doesn't she fear divine retribution?"

Evelyn felt equal disgust. "Treated me like her own? What a joke!" she thought bitterly.

All those years of enduring Eleanor's cruelty, making endless compromises for Nathan's sake - only to be constantly belittled and used.

Those days were over.

"Mrs. Blackwell, you treat me like a daughter? That's news to me."

Evelyn's sudden appearance froze the conversation mid-flow, leaving Eleanor gaping like a fish out of water. Being caught in such an obvious lie was mortifying.

She studied Evelyn - the same face, yet radiating an entirely new aura.

Where Eleanor had once dominated effortlessly, she now found herself instinctively shrinking under Evelyn's commanding presence. The power dynamic had shifted irrevocably.
###Chapter 149 The Sting of Humiliation

"Ms. Carter, what a pleasant surprise to see you here," cooed one of the socialites, her manicured fingers fluttering near her pearl necklace. Lauren Blackwell's smile didn't quite reach her cold, calculating eyes.

"We were just discussing a spa day with your dear mother-in-law." The woman's saccharine tone dripped with false sweetness. "Planning to raid your boutique for some new ensembles!"

Evelyn Carter recognized the viper in designer silk immediately. Lauren Blackwell - one of Eleanor's sycophants who'd once sneered at her during charity galas.

"Mrs. Blackwell," Evelyn's voice carried like chilled champagne, "my boutique welcomes all discerning clients. But as you're well aware, Nathan and I are divorced. Mrs. Blackwell here is no longer family."

She let the words hang, watching with dark satisfaction as Eleanor's carefully botoxed face twitched. "Our relationship was never quite the... fairytale she's been selling you."

The air crackled with tension. Lauren's smile froze mid-sip of her mimosa. The other socialites' eyes darted between them like spectators at a tennis match.

"My apologies, Ms. Carter," Lauren backpedaled with the grace of a cornered fox. "How terribly forgetful of me." Her obsequious tone would've been comical if it weren't so pathetic.

The other women scrambled to distance themselves from Eleanor, their designer heels practically leaving skid marks.

"We barely know Mrs. Blackwell!"
"Just a chance encounter, really."
"Karma's a fitting stylist, isn't it?"

Eleanor's chest heaved beneath her Chanel suit. These were women she'd lunched with for decades, sponsored their charity events, introduced to her inner circle. Now they discarded her like last season's Prada.

"Ms. Carter, we really must be going-" Lauren began her retreat.

"Wait." Evelyn's command froze them mid-turn. From her Birkin, Olivia produced a stack of embossed cards. "Since you admire my designs, consider this an invitation to my private client list. Twenty percent off your first purchase."

Lauren's greedy fingers trembled as she accepted the black card. "You're too generous!" The women practically curtsied in their Louboutins.

Eleanor watched her social capital evaporate before her Gucci sunglasses. The cruelest cut? Watching Evelyn - that nobody secretary - dismantle her life with such effortless grace.

"Eleanor," Evelyn purred, adjusting her diamond tennis bracelet, "do be more careful with your fabrications. We wouldn't want people thinking we're... close."

The knife twisted deeper. Eleanor's manicured nails bit into her palms. She'd had the Sterling empire within her grasp - connections to the Kingsley fortune, prestige beyond measure. All destroyed by her own arrogance.

As the socialites scattered like frightened birds, Evelyn allowed herself a small, vicious smile. Revenge, she reflected, looked exquisite in couture.
###Chapter 150 How Dare You Have the Audacity

"Evelyn," Eleanor Blackwell forced a tight smile. "I'll admit my past mistakes and apologize properly. But Nathan has done nothing wrong. He's always loved you deeply."

"Perhaps you should reconsider giving him another chance. I swear I won't interfere this time."

"How dare you have the audacity?" Olivia Sinclair fired back without mercy.

"Look at what kind of people you Sterlings are. Even if every other man on earth disappeared, I'd never choose Nathan again."

Evelyn mentally cheered for her best friend's savage comeback.

That's my girl.

"Mrs. Blackwell, I'll treat today's conversation as a bad joke. Honesty suits people better than trying to elevate yourself by stepping on others."

Eleanor's face drained of color, her expression turning ugly.

Despite humbling herself, Evelyn showed no respect. This wasn't the same meek girl who used to tolerate everything silently.

Eleanor refused to accept defeat.

Her fingers secretly found her phone in the purse, dialing Nathan's number. Let him hear his ex-wife's true colors.

"Evelyn, are you truly over Nathan?" Eleanor pressed, convinced the words were insincere.

For three years, she'd watched Evelyn debase herself for Nathan's love. No woman could abandon such feelings so easily.

Evelyn frowned, having considered this herself.

Before today, mentioning Nathan might have stirred something. Even if he'd never loved her, her heart would have reacted.

But now? It felt like discussing a complete stranger. Not even a flicker of emotion remained.

"Mrs. Blackwell, people change. I'm no exception. Besides, shouldn't we learn from past mistakes?" Evelyn said calmly.

"To you, Nathan may be the perfect son. To me? Just an ordinary man I no longer know."

Through the phone, Nathan's grip tightened dangerously.

He was in the middle of Sterling Enterprises' quarterly board meeting when the call connected.

Hearing Evelyn's words, his expression darkened, leaving executives exchanging confused glances. The room fell deathly silent.

Simon recognized the warning signs. Risking ejection, he whispered, "Mr. Sterling, is everything alright?"

Nathan stood abruptly. "Continue without me." His voice could freeze hell.

He left without explanation, leaving stunned silence in his wake.

Meanwhile, Eleanor grew uneasy under Evelyn's indifference. "You'll regret this, Evelyn."

"Mrs. Blackwell, I know my own mind. I'm not a recycling center for other people's trash." With that, Evelyn turned away.

Eleanor stood frozen, then pulled out her phone with trembling hands. "Nathan, you heard her. Your ex-wife just humiliated me."
###Chapter 151 Extend an Olive Branch

"You must make her pay, Nathan! Hello? Nathan?" Before Eleanor could finish her outburst, the line went dead.

Her chest heaved with rage as she hurled her phone against the wall. "Evelyn, you scheming little witch!"

The flush of anger spread across her face like wildfire.

Nearby patrons began whispering behind their hands, casting curious glances her way.

Eleanor suddenly wished the marble floor would swallow her whole.

"Mrs. Blackwell."

A pair of designer heels clicked into view. Diana Chamberlain stood before her with a polished smile, extending a perfectly manicured hand.

Eleanor eyed the stranger suspiciously. "Do I know you?"

"That's unimportant. What matters is our mutual... acquaintance with Evelyn Carter."

At the mention of that name, Eleanor's spine straightened. "You're one of her minions?"

Diana's laugh tinkled like crystal. "Quite the opposite, Mrs. Blackwell. I was hoping we might discuss her over tea. Are you available?"

Though every instinct warned her, Eleanor's thirst for vengeance won out. "Lead the way."

The two women disappeared into a private lounge.

Meanwhile, Evelyn emerged from her spa appointment glowing with renewed confidence.

No longer would she play the meek wife, bending to Nathan's every whim. The old Evelyn was back.

Back at Kingsley Industries, she buried herself in work until the stack of files finally disappeared from her desk.

"Maxwell, distribute these to department heads before tomorrow's meeting," she instructed, glancing at her watch.

"Anything else pending?"

Her assistant noted the dark shadows beneath her eyes. "Ms. Carter, you've been burning the midnight oil all week. Perhaps you should—"

"I'll rest when everything's done."

Knowing better than to argue, Maxwell discreetly shelved several non-critical documents.

By the time Evelyn finished, the city lights had already begun their nightly dance across the skyline.

Only then did she power down her laptop and reach for her purse.

Her car waited in the far corner of the B1 parking level.

Just as the engine purred to life, a sleek Lamborghini Aventador screeched to a halt, blocking her exit.

That arrogant move could only mean one person.

Nathan Sterling's intense gaze burned through her windshield.

Cigarette butts littered the ground around his car, the interior thick with smoke. Control slipping through his fingers was an unfamiliar sensation.

Evelyn remained stone-faced, laying on the horn.

The tinted window slid down to reveal Nathan's chiseled profile. "We need to talk."

Her grip tightened on the steering wheel. "About what? We said everything months ago."

"My mother's outburst earlier—don't take it to heart."

So Eleanor had gone running to her precious son. Predictable.
###Chapter 152 You're Out of Your Mind

"What did she say?"

Nathan's jaw tightened as Evelyn's dismissive tone grated on his nerves.

The woman he remembered had always been soft-spoken and compliant. When had she developed this steel spine? Or had this been her true self all along?

"Evelyn, I've heard about your situation. I know you need to boost your numbers."

Sterling Enterprises could be your solution."

He extended the offer like a peace offering between warring nations.

"Pass."

Her rejection came swift and sharp as a guillotine blade.

"Anything else? If not, move your car."

White-hot anger surged through his veins. "You'd rather crash and burn than accept my help?"

Something about him felt off today—desperate almost.

"Crash? Burn?"

Her laughter held no mirth. "Those words don't exist in my vocabulary. And Mr. Sterling, we're divorced. Kingsley Industries and Sterling Enterprises are competitors now. Save your charity for someone who needs it."

"Still as stubborn as ever, I see."

She revved the engine in response.

Nathan barely had time to register the cold determination in her eyes before impact.

The sickening crunch of metal filled the air as his Lamborghini's pristine hood caved inward.

"Have you lost your damn mind?"

His shout went unanswered as she leaned out the window.

"Never approach a woman's car uninvited."

Her crimson lips curved dangerously. "Next time, I might not stop at property damage."

The tires screeched as she peeled away, leaving him gripping a steering wheel that refused to turn over.

"I won't forget this, Evelyn Carter."

In her rearview mirror, the adrenaline faded as quickly as it came.

What had possessed her to nearly commit vehicular manslaughter? The wind whipped through her open window, cooling the irrational fury.

Her car's Bluetooth chimed. "Darling, just landed. Care to play chauffeur?"

Adrian's voice dripped with its usual playful arrogance.

"Finished your French escapade?"

She could practically hear his smirk through the speakers.

"Landed three new accounts. Next quarter's projections just doubled."

Despite herself, pride flickered in her chest. The man might be insufferable, but his business acumen was undeniable.

"I'll arrange a welcome party with your team."

"Wait—"

His tone turned petulant. "I called you before customs. Doesn't that deserve a personal pickup?"

"Touched beyond words by your dedication."

"Then get your gorgeous self to Terminal 3. Unless you want me sleeping on an airport bench."

The exaggerated pout in his voice made her roll her eyes as she executed a sharp U-turn.

"Fine. Don't move."

His triumphant chuckle grated on her nerves. "Wouldn't dream of it, love."
###Chapter 153 Any Preferences?

Adrian Prescott paced anxiously near the arrivals terminal, his eyes scanning every vehicle that approached.

His face lit up when Evelyn Carter's sleek black sedan finally appeared thirty minutes later. He waved enthusiastically as the car glided to a perfect stop before him.

"Finally! I thought you'd forgotten about me," Adrian teased, brushing dust from his jacket.

Evelyn studied his travel-weary appearance with concern. "You look exhausted. Thank you for coming straight from the airport."

He slid into the passenger seat with a boyish grin. "For you? Always. It's an honor just to be in your presence."

The engine purred to life as Evelyn adjusted the mirrors. "Should I take you home to rest?"

Adrian's stomach growled audibly. "Actually...how about dinner first? Unless you're too busy?"

Evelyn arched an elegant eyebrow. "Any preferences?"

"Surprise me," he said, stretching his arms. "I'll eat anything as long as it's edible."

As Evelyn considered their options, Adrian suddenly reached into his carry-on. "Almost forgot!" He produced a velvet-wrapped box tied with golden ribbon. "For you."

Evelyn accepted it with curious fingers. "What's this?"

Adrian's eyes sparkled with mischief. "Open it later. It'll make more sense at home."

"You're being unusually cryptic," Evelyn observed, placing the mysterious gift in the center console.

"That's half the fun," Adrian countered with a proud smirk.

Evelyn eventually selected an upscale Italian bistro. The valet took the car as they stepped onto the cobblestone walkway.

Adrian chattered animatedly about his business trip to France, punctuating stories with dramatic hand gestures.

Evelyn chuckled at his enthusiasm. "I never realized you had such...colorful adventures abroad."

"Wait, no—" Adrian backpedaled, suddenly serious. "It's not like that at all! Just professional networking, I swear."

"I know," Evelyn said mildly, though her lips quirked upward.

Adrian fidgeted with his cufflinks. "Madam Carter, you must understand—"

"Relax," Evelyn interrupted, amusement coloring her tone. "I believe you."

The hostess seated them at a candlelit table near the window. Unbeknownst to them, Vanessa Sterling and her socialite friends were settling their bill at a nearby table.

Vanessa's gaze sharpened when she recognized Evelyn. "Who is that with her?" she muttered, studying Adrian's unfamiliar face.

She discreetly snapped a photo with her phone, but the man's identity escaped her. "Do any of you recognize him?" she asked her companions.

The other heiresses shook their heads. "Never seen him before. But isn't that—"

"The Kingsley heiress!" one gasped.

Another nearly dropped her clutch. "Oh my god, it really is her! The most powerful woman in the city!"

"I can't believe we're breathing the same air right now," a third whispered reverently.

Vanessa's mouth twisted in displeasure at their fawning. "Honestly, have some dignity."

"You don't understand," one friend breathed. "Evelyn Carter is everything we aspire to be."

Vanessa's perfectly manicured nails dug into her palm. "Excuse me?"

The group ignored her, too busy admiring Evelyn's effortless elegance. "A self-made billionaire by thirty," one sighed dreamily. "She's our generation's icon."

Vanessa's champagne flute trembled in her grip as she watched the oblivious pair across the restaurant. The way Adrian leaned forward with attentive interest made her blood boil.

She'd find out exactly who this mysterious man was—and why Evelyn Carter seemed so comfortable in his presence.
###Chapter 154 An Easy Target

These spoiled heiresses never took anything seriously except their lavish lifestyles.

Their families insisted they learn business management from Evelyn, making her their unexpected role model.

"I must get a selfie with my idol! This will break the internet!" one squealed.

"An autograph first! I'm having it framed in gold for my penthouse," another declared.

"Vanessa, are you coming?"

Vanessa stood frozen, baffled by her friends' sudden worship of Evelyn.

"But she's just-" Her protest died as the group stampeded toward their new obsession.

"Ms. Carter! Photo please?" A manicured hand waved an iPhone.

Evelyn nearly spilled her coffee as the socialites descended upon her.

"I'm flattered, but I don't do photos with strangers," she demurred.

Pouty lips formed exaggerated frowns.

"Just one signature? I'll name my next Birkin after you!"

Evelyn blinked. "I'm not famous enough for autographs."

"You're legendary!"

"Our queen!"

Their shrill voices carried across the restaurant.

Evelyn suppressed an eye roll. Since when had she become their mascot?

Vanessa's stilettos clicked angrily across the marble floor. "Showing off again, Evelyn?" she sneered.

Gasps erupted. "You know Ms. Carter?"

Vanessa smirked. "Know her? She was practically family until my brother dumped her penniless onto the streets."

She waited for the shocked gasps, reveling in her petty victory.

Adrian's chair screeched as he stood. "Did your mother breastfeed you with toilet water? That's the only explanation for that sewage coming from your mouth."

The heiresses dissolved into giggles.

Vanessa's face purpled. "You're just her latest boy toy! How many men has she cycled through by now?"

She was playing with fire.

While violence wasn't the answer, Adrian's clenched fists suggested otherwise.

"Clearly no one taught you basic decency," Evelyn said icily.

Vanessa tossed her hair. "I'm just stating facts. How many beds have you warmed this month?"

The slap echoed like a gunshot.

Vanessa staggered back. "You bitch! I'm not your punching bag!"

Evelyn flexed her fingers. "Actually, you're quite convenient. Since your parents failed, consider this a free etiquette lesson."
###Chapter 155 I Want Her Reputation Destroyed

Vanessa lunged forward to grab Evelyn, but Adrian's iron grip clamped down on her wrist. "Lay a finger on her and you'll regret it," he growled through clenched teeth.

She twisted violently but couldn't escape his hold. "Evelyn! Make him release me this instant!" Vanessa shrieked.

The socialites watching the confrontation exchanged disgusted glances. Their disdain for Vanessa intensified by the second.

"Ms. Sterling, your behavior toward our idol is absolutely unacceptable. I want nothing more to do with you."

"How dare you slander someone like Ms. Carter? Look in the mirror before throwing accusations!"

"I'd heard rumors about your vicious nature, but seeing it firsthand is something else entirely."

The women backed away from Vanessa as if she carried some contagious disease.

Vanessa's face turned crimson with rage. "Where was this energy when you were accepting my gifts? Now you turn on me for her?" she spat.

"Please, those cheap trinkets? My maid's been using them as paperweights."

"Honestly, we tolerated you out of pity. Did you actually think we valued your friendship?"

"Name one thing you've given us that wasn't worthless. I'll pay you back double just to never see you again."

Evelyn observed the scene with quiet amusement. Watching Vanessa's so-called friends abandon her was more entertaining than she'd anticipated.

"Darling, shall we go? This place has become rather... unpleasant," Adrian suggested, releasing Vanessa's arm with visible disgust. He wiped his hands on his handkerchief as if touching something filthy.

"Agreed. The atmosphere here is ruining my appetite," Evelyn replied, rising gracefully from her seat.

But the socialites blocked her path with sudden enthusiasm.

"Ms. Carter! Could I trouble you for an autograph?"

"You're my absolute idol! Would you mind a quick photo?"

Vanessa stood frozen, watching helplessly as Evelyn became the center of attention. The bitter taste of humiliation burned in her throat.

After posing for photos and signing autographs, Evelyn prepared to leave, but the women still buzzed with excitement.

"Did you see Ms. Carter's complexion? Flawless porcelain! I'd kill to know her skincare routine."

"Not a single visible pore! How is that even possible?"

"If only we could be friends with someone like Ms. Carter. Though I doubt we're worthy."

Their gushing continued unabated, completely ignoring Vanessa standing right beside them. She might as well have been invisible.

With a cold smirk, Vanessa pulled out her phone and reviewed the photos she'd secretly taken. A wicked plan formed in her mind. Once the women dispersed, she made a call.

"Fashion Daily? I have explosive gossip about a certain socialite. Interested?"

The reporter's voice turned eager. "Which celebrity? Name your price."

Vanessa's lips curled into a venomous smile. "I don't want money. I want her reputation shredded beyond repair."
###Chapter 156 Don't Cross Evelyn Carter

The reporter's eyes lit up at the prospect of scandalous gossip that could ruin someone's reputation. "Which celebrity are we talking about here?"

Vanessa Sterling smirked as she dropped her bombshell. "It's Evelyn Carter from Kingsley Industries. I've got proof of her sleeping around."

The moment Evelyn's name was mentioned, the reporter's enthusiasm evaporated.

In a city like Pamore, everyone knew better than to mess with the Kingsley family. No media outlet dared touch Evelyn's private life now.

"What kind of proof?" The reporter asked half-heartedly, but Vanessa missed the sudden lack of interest.

She was determined to expose Evelyn's true nature to the world.

"I'll email you the photos. Make sure this gets published," Vanessa demanded.

"Sure thing," came the disinterested reply, but Vanessa still eagerly forwarded the compromising pictures.

She expected to see Evelyn's scandal splashed across every tabloid the next morning. Instead, there was complete silence.

Not a single entertainment outlet would even take her calls.

"Damn you, Evelyn," Vanessa muttered through clenched teeth. But she wasn't done yet.

If the press wouldn't cooperate, she'd take matters into her own hands. She'd make sure Nathan Sterling saw what kind of woman his ex-wife really was.

Storming into Sterling Enterprises, Vanessa barged straight into Nathan's office.

"Nathan, look at Evelyn! She's been jumping from one man's bed to another since your divorce. What's wrong with her?" She shoved her phone in his face.

The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees at Evelyn's name.

Undeterred, Vanessa kept talking while scrolling through her phone's gallery. "Here's the proof—"

Nathan barely glanced at the photos before his expression darkened. He hadn't realized Evelyn and Adrian Prescott had grown so close.

Was his former best friend really pursuing his ex-wife?

A cold laugh escaped him as he remembered their last confrontation.

"Don't you have anything better to do?" His voice was dangerously calm.

Vanessa blinked in confusion. "What do you mean?"

Nathan tapped his fingers on the desk. "Have I been giving you too much allowance lately?"

The mention of her allowance made Vanessa pale.

Her funds were already stretched thin. Any more cuts would leave her penniless.

"Nathan, please don't reduce my allowance! I'll leave right now—" She started backing toward the door.

"Not so fast." His command froze her in place.

"Is there... something else?" Vanessa asked nervously.

Nathan pointed at her phone. "Delete those photos. And if I ever catch you interfering with Evelyn again—"

His voice dropped to a whisper. "I'll ship you off to Firalden for a decade. No returns."

Vanessa's eyes welled up with tears.

"Nathan, how can you treat me like this over that bitch Evelyn? I'm your sister!" She wailed.

"Delete. Them. Now." Each word was like an ice pick.

Vanessa trembled from head to toe.

She'd come here expecting Nathan to join her in hating Evelyn. Instead, he'd taken her enemy's side.

"I'll delete them, I swear! Just please don't send me away. I promise I'll never bother Evelyn again," she begged desperately.

Nathan gave a barely perceptible nod as he watched her frantically erase every photo.
###Chapter 157 I Always Knew It Was You

"Don't forget our conversation today. If you keep pushing your luck, you'll have no one to blame but yourself." Nathan's voice was ice cold.

Vanessa left the office only after giving multiple reassurances.

The moment the door closed, Nathan turned to stare out the floor-to-ceiling windows. His expression darkened as he became lost in thought.

So lost that he didn't even notice Simon entering the room.

Nathan finally turned when he heard the clearing of a throat. "What is it?"

"There's been unusual activity with our company shares. Someone's been aggressively buying them up through shell companies." Simon adjusted his glasses. "The pattern suggests this isn't random."

Nathan's jaw tightened. "What do we know?"

"Whoever's behind this is covering their tracks well. But our team is monitoring every transaction. The next move they make should give us something concrete."

"Good. Don't tip them off." Nathan's fingers drummed against the mahogany desk.

"Understood, Mr. Sterling."

Nathan abruptly changed subjects. "When Evelyn worked here, did she have any close colleagues?"

Simon hesitated. "Ms. Carter was professional with everyone. But if you're asking about personal connections... no, not that I recall."

The disappointment flashed across Nathan's face before he schooled his features. "That's all. You may go."

Simon left with a puzzled frown. Lately, Nathan's interest in his former secretary seemed... unusual.

Meanwhile, at Kingsley Industries...

Evelyn had just finished a grueling video conference with international partners when the knock came.

"Enter."

Adrian strolled in, his usual playful grin in place. "Ms. Carter, these need your signature." He placed two folders on her desk.

Evelyn sighed. Despite repeatedly asking him to use her professional title, Adrian insisted on this ridiculous nickname.

"Must you call me that in the office?" She rubbed her temples.

Adrian's grin widened. "Not unless you agree to dinner this weekend."

Evelyn rolled her eyes and opened the documents. After verifying the contents, she signed with quick strokes.

"If not dinner, then maybe—"

"Do you not have enough work?" Evelyn cut him off sharply. "Perhaps I should assign you more."

For the past week since returning from his business trip, Adrian had been relentless—asking her out daily despite her refusals.

"Ms. Carter, have some faith in me." Adrian leaned against her desk. "I've already increased our Q3 projections by 18%. Surely that deserves a date?"

Evelyn's patience snapped. "I just got divorced."

"I know."

"I'm not looking for another relationship."

Adrian merely shrugged. "I can wait."

Evelyn resorted to bluntness. "You're not my type."

To her shock, Adrian moved closer, his smile turning predatory. "Then tell me what your type is, and I'll become it."

Evelyn's eyes widened. "Why me, Adrian? Seriously."

Adrian laughed, but there was something raw in it. "There is no 'why.' I just—"

The office phone rang, cutting him off. Evelyn grabbed it like a lifeline. "Evelyn Carter speaking."

As she listened to the caller, Adrian mouthed 'this isn't over' before sauntering out, leaving Evelyn more unsettled than she cared to admit.
###Chapter 158 Complete Disregard

"Evelyn, I admit I was wrong before. Had I known I'd be engaged to you, I would never have refused."

His words hung heavy in the air between them.

"But it's not too late. You're unattached, and so am I. Whenever you're ready, I'm here waiting," Adrian confessed.

He turned to leave her office.

Evelyn stopped him with a gentle hand on his arm. "Adrian, you deserve better than this. Don't waste your time on me."

A sad smile touched his lips. "You'll always be the best in my eyes. Don't feel pressured, Evelyn."

"My feelings are my own choice. Whether you choose me or not is entirely up to you. I can accept any outcome."

With that final declaration, Adrian walked out.

Yet his words haunted Evelyn all afternoon, making concentration impossible.

They'd only ever been friends - nothing more.

But Adrian had the stubbornness of a bull in spring, unwilling to surrender easily.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, forcing the thoughts away as she buried herself in paperwork. Just before closing, her phone buzzed with Beatrice's caller ID.

"Aunt Beatrice? Is everything alright?" Evelyn answered.

The older woman immediately detected the exhaustion in Evelyn's voice. "Working yourself to the bone again, aren't you?"

Evelyn managed a warm chuckle. "Not too bad, Aunt Beatrice!"

But Beatrice knew better. Evelyn was as much a workaholic as her son Harrison.

"Why don't you join us for dinner tonight? I've made your favorite homemade lasagna," Beatrice tempted.

Evelyn's stomach growled at the thought. "Absolutely! I've been craving your cooking."

"My dear, you mustn't let work consume you entirely. Harrison should be arriving at your office any moment to pick you up."

"Harrison is coming?" Surprise colored Evelyn's voice.

"He should be there any minute now," Beatrice confirmed.

As if summoned, Evelyn spotted Harrison through her office window.

A genuine smile bloomed across her face. "I see him now! See you tonight, Aunt Beatrice!"

She hung up and rushed out.

"Harrison!" She called.

He arched one perfect eyebrow, fingers playfully tousling her hair. "Did someone forget our little arrangement?"

Evelyn stuck out her tongue mischievously. "Just teasing you, Harry!"

Her whisper was for his ears only.

Diana Chamberlain observed them with carefully schooled indifference from the shadows. Inside, she burned.

The information she'd gathered from Eleanor and her private investigator had initially shocked her. Now it only fueled her contempt.

How could some divorced woman possibly deserve someone like Harrison?

"Ms. Carter!" Diana stepped forward with calculated timing.

Evelyn turned, puzzled. "I'm sorry, you are...?"

Diana remained silent, her gaze shifting pointedly to Harrison.

She'd expected him to make introductions. But Harrison's attention never wavered from Evelyn. Diana might as well have been invisible.

After years by his side, this was the first time he'd completely disregarded her existence.

Still, she maintained perfect composure, extending a manicured hand. "Hello Ms. Carter. We've met before. I'm Diana Chamberlain."
###Chapter 159 No Need

Evelyn recognized Diana immediately and extended her hand with effortless grace. "Oh, hello there."

"Mr. Whitmore speaks so highly of you. He said you're not only stunning but also have an incredible personality."

A delicate pause.

"Now that I've met you, Ms. Carter, I must say the rumors don't do you justice," Diana remarked smoothly.

Evelyn's eyebrows lifted slightly in surprise. She turned to Harrison with a playful glint in her eyes. "I had no idea you noticed all these qualities about me, Harry!"

"You've always been extraordinary," Harrison replied, his voice warm with affection.

The corners of Evelyn's mouth curved into a radiant smile. "Shall we head back? I'm absolutely starving!"

"Of course," Harrison agreed, his mood visibly lighter.

The trio descended the staircase together. Diana moved with practiced efficiency, sliding into the driver's seat without hesitation.

"Ms. Chamberlain, take us to Lakeside Manor," Harrison instructed.

Diana's response came with polished professionalism. "Right away, Mr. Whitmore."

The luxury sedan glided through the city streets. Watching the urban landscape blur past the window, Evelyn mused aloud, "I believe we'll secure the Nexa contract this time. Both companies should be signing the agreement within days."

Harrison gave a thoughtful nod. "The project shows real potential. The initial phase may present challenges, but once we establish momentum..."

"Everything will fall into place," Evelyn finished his thought. "Though none of this would be possible without your connections smoothing the way." Her gratitude shone through her words. "Really, Harry, thank you."

Harrison's brow furrowed slightly. "No need for formalities between us."

Evelyn's grin widened. "Noted."

From the front seat, Diana observed their easy rapport with barely concealed curiosity. The extent of Harrison's involvement clearly surprised her.

"Mr. Whitmore, there's that patisserie Madam Whitmore adores coming up at the next intersection. Shall I stop?"

Harrison recognized the establishment Beatrice had mentioned before. "Yes, pull over. I'll get her favorites."

As Diana maneuvered into a parking spot, Evelyn reached for her door handle. "I'll come with—"

"No need," Harrison interrupted gently. "This won't take long."

When he insisted, Evelyn reluctantly settled back into her seat.

The moment Harrison disappeared into the bakery, Diana turned slightly in her seat. "Madam Whitmore has such refined taste in desserts. I've made this stop for her many times."

The implication was clear—Diana enjoyed a close relationship with Beatrice, privy to her personal preferences.

Evelyn found the assistant's behavior peculiar. Casually, she inquired, "Ms. Chamberlain, you've been with the Whitmores for years, haven't you? What prompted your sudden transfer to Kingsley Industries?"

"Six years, actually. The transfer was Mr. Whitmore's decision." Diana's smile didn't quite reach her eyes. "After so long with one family, certain habits become ingrained. Change can be... difficult."

"But not impossible," Evelyn countered with deliberate lightness. "If one truly desires change, the capacity exists. Wouldn't you agree?"

Diana's nod was perfectly measured. "Quite right. Though I've heard interesting things about you as well. Weren't you previously married?"

The air between them grew thick with unspoken implications.

"In my younger, more naive days, I made some poor choices," Evelyn admitted smoothly. "You seem quite interested in my past, Ms. Chamberlain."

Diana's gaze flickered toward Harrison returning with pastry boxes before answering. "Mr. Whitmore is truly one of a kind..."
###Chapter 160 Unworthy of His Heart

"Only those who match his caliber deserve to stand by his side," Diana remarked pointedly.

Evelyn caught the hidden meaning immediately.

She hadn't anticipated such boldness from an assistant. "Ms. Chamberlain, your dedication extends beyond professional boundaries," Evelyn countered coolly. "But perhaps you're overstepping your role concerning personal matters."

Diana blinked, unprepared for Evelyn's directness. There was no point in pretense now.

"Ms. Carter, I have Mr. Whitmore's best interests at heart. Surely you understand how... problematic certain pairings might appear to society."

She let the implication hang between them. "You might not care about gossip, but do you think Harrison would remain unaffected?"

The car door swung open just then, Harrison returning with their desserts.

He immediately sensed the tension. "Everything alright?" His concerned gaze settled on Evelyn.

Diana's words had struck deeper than Evelyn cared to admit.

Her family might encourage this match, but they hadn't considered Harrison's social standing. The fragile hope in her chest shattered instantly.

"Perfectly fine," Evelyn forced a smile. "Just passing the time."

Diana had expected tears or accusations. Instead, she got polished indifference. "Mr. Whitmore, Ms. Carter and I were getting acquainted. Perhaps we'll become good friends."

Harrison studied Evelyn. "Is that so?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her purse. "Shouldn't we head back? Beatrice must be waiting!"

With a final searching look, Harrison instructed Diana to drive to Lakeside Manor.

The tires crunched on the gravel driveway. Beatrice waited on the porch, arms outstretched. "Evelyn darling!"

Evelyn rushed into the embrace. "Aunt Beatrice! I've missed you terribly!"

The older woman's affection was palpable. "I found the most exquisite sapphire set at Cartier yesterday - it'll complement your eyes perfectly!"

"You spoil me!" Evelyn laughed.

"Nonsense," Beatrice chided, stroking her hair. Their bond could easily be mistaken for mother and daughter.

Meanwhile, Harrison stood forgotten. He cleared his throat pointedly.

Diana observed the scene with poorly concealed shock. All her earlier boasts about her rapport with Beatrice now rang hollow.

"Mrs. Whitmore!" Diana composed herself with effort.

Only then did Beatrice notice her. "Ms. Chamberlain? What brings you here?"

While Beatrice respected Diana's professional competence, the woman's striking beauty had always made her uneasy. Before Evelyn, it hadn't mattered.

But now? Beatrice's gaze turned calculating. Certain... arrangements would need to be made.
###Chapter 161 Beatrice Whitmore's Influence

In a split second, Beatrice had reached her decision.

Evelyn Carter remained oblivious to the older woman's thoughts. "Mr. Whitmore requested I drive them here," she explained hastily.

Beatrice merely hummed in acknowledgment before shooting Harrison Whitmore a pointed glare.

Harrison rubbed his nose, utterly perplexed by his mother's expression.

Without hesitation, Beatrice dismissed Diana Chamberlain. "In that case, Diana, your duties are concluded for today."

"Since my goddaughter Evelyn is visiting, I won't trouble you to stay for supper. We'll arrange a proper dinner invitation another time."

Diana's expression flickered momentarily before she regained her composure. "Of course, Mrs. Whitmore. I'll take my leave then."

Turning to Harrison, she added, "Mr. Whitmore, I'll be going now."

Harrison gave a curt nod.

Diana's fists clenched involuntarily. Though reluctant to depart, she couldn't justify remaining.

Once she'd gone, Beatrice turned to Evelyn. "Darling Evelyn, don't fret! There won't be any more female assistants hovering around him from now on. No workplace romances."

She fixed Harrison with a stern look. "Have her reassigned immediately, or you'll answer to me."

Harrison offered no protest. When Beatrice Whitmore spoke, her word was law.

Evelyn blinked in surprise at her godmother's bluntness.

Changing the subject, she asked, "Aunt Beatrice, didn't you mention making my favorite lasagna? I'm absolutely famished."

"You little gourmand, come inside at once," Beatrice chuckled.

The trio settled around the dining table, the atmosphere warm and convivial.

"Evelyn, have another helping of lasagna," Beatrice urged, spooning more onto Evelyn's already overflowing plate.

"Aunt Beatrice, this is too much! I'll never finish it all," Evelyn protested with a laugh.

"Nonsense," Beatrice waved her hand. "Harrison can eat whatever you leave. He's been finishing leftovers since he was in diapers."

Harrison adopted an expression of wounded innocence, feeling distinctly victimized by their banter.

"Mother, I'm beginning to seriously doubt my biological origins," he sighed dramatically.

Beatrice didn't miss a beat. "I've told you countless times - we found you in a cabbage patch. Where's your self-awareness?"

Defeated, Harrison focused on his meal.

After dinner, Beatrice and Evelyn settled into comfortable conversation, discussing everything from fashion to recent events.

Beatrice produced a jewelry box containing a sapphire necklace she'd recently acquired - a rare piece worth millions.

"Oh, it's exquisite!" Evelyn gasped as Beatrice fastened it around her neck.

Beatrice nodded approvingly before turning to Harrison. "See? Your mother's taste remains impeccable, doesn't it?"

"Absolutely stunning," Harrison agreed, his gaze lingering on Evelyn. "Though the gem pales beside its wearer."

Evelyn flushed, surprised by Harrison's unexpected charm.

Beatrice observed their interaction with quiet satisfaction, pleased her son was finally catching on.

"Next time you see something beautiful, remember to purchase it for Evelyn. No skimping," she instructed.

Harrison appeared duly chastened, though his eyes never left Evelyn. "Understood," he murmured.

Evelyn's smile blossomed, warmth spreading through her at being so cherished. Linking arms with Beatrice, she declared, "Aunt Beatrice, you're simply the best."

"Naturally, darling. You've always been family to me."

She only wished the day would come soon when that would be official.

Beatrice couldn't resist shooting Harrison another warning glance that clearly said: "Let my future daughter-in-law slip away, and you'll regret it."
###Chapter 162 A Lingering Sense of Unease

Harrison could read Beatrice's expression perfectly, yet Evelyn's aloof demeanor toward him left an unsettling weight in his chest.

The road ahead appeared fraught with unexpected challenges.

"Oh, Evelyn darling," Beatrice suddenly brightened, "I recall your passion for fashion design. Professor Edmund Whitaker from Pamore University's Design School happens to be my former classmate."

"He's hosting an exclusive design exhibition in Pamore this weekend. I've secured VIP invitations. You and Harrison should attend as my representatives," she offered with a knowing glance.

A spark of genuine interest lit Evelyn's eyes as the corners of her lips curved upward.

"How wonderful! I'd love the opportunity to learn from industry masters," she responded enthusiastically.

Beatrice's heart swelled with satisfaction as she exchanged a meaningful look with Harrison, who immediately recognized her matchmaking intentions.

"Absolutely, we'll go together," Harrison added smoothly.

Beatrice nodded approvingly. "Excellent. I'll rest easier knowing you're attending together. But young man," she warned playfully, "I expect you to take exceptional care of our Evelyn."

"Please don't worry, Aunt Beatrice," Evelyn interjected with a warm smile. "Harrison has proven himself the perfect gentleman. I couldn't be in better hands."

The older woman's face glowed with delight at their apparent compatibility.

Professor Edmund Whitaker stood as a titan in fashion academia, having shaped countless designers during his illustrious career at Pamore University.

His award-winning creations had graced international runways, earning him legendary status in design circles.

Naturally, his exhibition drew elite designers and passionate enthusiasts from across the industry.

At the venue entrance, Eleanor abruptly pulled Vanessa aside. "Darling, have you submitted your portfolio to Professor Whitaker yet?"

"You're already in your second year. If you want that postgraduate position under him, we must act decisively," Eleanor pressed with urgency.

Vanessa suppressed an eye roll at her mother's persistent nagging.

"Mother, please," she snapped. "The submission is handled. My designs speak for themselves. Professor Whitaker's acceptance is merely a formality at this point."

Eleanor exhaled in relief. "Excellent. When you meet him, ensure you make an unforgettable impression."

"Secure that early admission so you can transition seamlessly after graduation."

"Obviously," Vanessa replied through clenched teeth.

As they entered the exhibition hall, Vanessa scanned the crowd for Professor Whitaker. Her search halted abruptly when she spotted an unexpected figure.

"Evelyn? What's she doing here?" she hissed.

The mere mention of the name twisted Eleanor's features into a scowl.

"That little witch," she muttered darkly, recalling their last humiliating encounter.

"Mother, why would she be here?" Vanessa's voice carried an edge of panic.

"Probably just another social climber at a cultural event. Pay her no mind," Eleanor dismissed.

Vanessa's fingers twisted nervously. "But what if she's here to sabotage me? She knows about my postgraduate plans with Professor Whitaker—"

Eleanor placed a reassuring hand on her daughter's shoulder. "Relax. She's a businesswoman, not a designer. Your talent will eclipse anything she could possibly say."

"But—" Vanessa's anxiety refused to dissipate.
###Chapter 163 The Sterling Family's Downfall

Eleanor's dismissive tone cut through the tension. "Vanessa, darling, don't waste your energy worrying about Evelyn Carter's presence here. Focus on what truly matters - impressing Professor Whitaker."

Across the exhibition hall, Evelyn arrived on Harrison Whitmore's arm.

The striking couple turned heads instantly.

Harrison's commanding presence complemented Evelyn's effortless elegance perfectly.

While few recognized the reclusive tech mogul, whispers about Evelyn's scandalous divorce circulated through the crowd.

"That's the Kingsley heiress - divorced but clearly not suffering. Her new escort outshines Nathan Sterling in every way."

"Escort? That's Harrison Whitworth! CEO of Horizon Technologies!"

Gasps rippled through the gathering.

"No wonder they look so perfect together!"

"Evelyn Carter is living the dream - gorgeous, accomplished, and now with one of the most eligible bachelors in the country."

"Meanwhile, her ex-husband must be drowning in regret at Sterling Enterprises' recent failures."

Vanessa's face flushed crimson with rage.

"How dare you! My brother never regretted divorcing that gold-digging social climber!" she spat.

The crowd exchanged knowing glances.

"Oh look, it's little Vanessa Sterling. Aren't you the one begging Professor Whitaker to take you as his student?"

"Such high standards he has. I wonder if you'll measure up."

Vanessa's nails dug into her palms. "My academic pursuits are none of your concern! Mind your tongues before I have my lawyers silence them permanently."

The spectators remained unimpressed.

"We're simply stating facts, Ms. Sterling."

"Your family treated Evelyn horribly, blind to her true worth. Now the Kingsleys are dismantling your empire piece by piece."

"Hasn't Nathan mentioned how many contracts Sterling Enterprises has lost recently?"

"The mighty have truly fallen."

Vanessa froze. She'd been too preoccupied with her social calendar to notice business troubles. Nathan always handled everything.

What was happening?

"Shut your filthy mouths! You know nothing about my family!" she shrieked.

The crowd dispersed, their laughter trailing behind them as they flocked toward Evelyn's circle.

Evelyn stood at the center of attention, effortlessly charming every socialite and business magnate who approached.

Vanessa's chest tightened watching the scene.

Then she remembered Nathan's warning - no more confrontations with Evelyn.

"Vanessa?" Eleanor's voice snapped her from her thoughts.
###Chapter 164 The Masterpiece That Stunned Everyone

"I've been searching everywhere, but I can't seem to locate your submission. Are you absolutely certain you turned it in to Professor Whitaker?" Eleanor questioned with a frown.

Vanessa blinked rapidly, snapping out of her daze. "I definitely submitted it. Perhaps it's displayed in the west wing. Let me show you."

The two women made their way through the bustling design exhibition toward the opposite gallery.

Meanwhile, Evelyn found herself momentarily overwhelmed by the crowd of admirers. After graciously accepting their compliments, she excused herself to a quiet seating area.

Harrison appeared with two champagne flutes, offering one to her. "How are you holding up? Need a break?"

Evelyn accepted the glass with a grateful smile. "I'm perfectly fine, thank you."

Harrison leaned closer. "I've been surveying the exhibition. Professor Whitaker has surprisingly few of his own works displayed tonight. The majority are student submissions."

"I heard Professor Whitaker is considering retirement and searching for a protégé. This exhibition serves as his evaluation of potential successors," Evelyn remarked.

Harrison nodded. "Shall we examine the submissions together?"

As they strolled through the gallery, Evelyn couldn't help but be impressed. "The craftsmanship and conceptual depth in these pieces is remarkable. Each one demonstrates incredible dedication."

Harrison pointed to a particularly striking work. "This submission comes from a freshman student. Such natural talent in their first year is extraordinary."

"But there's one piece that's generating significant buzz tonight," Harrison added mysteriously.

Evelyn's curiosity was immediately piqued. "Where is it?"

Harrison gestured toward a crowded corner. "Over there, where everyone's gathered. The crowd speaks volumes about its quality."

Without hesitation, Evelyn led the way toward the commotion.

"This is unbelievable! Vanessa Sterling has created something truly revolutionary!"

"The color palette is daring yet harmonious! The structural innovation is breathtaking. Imagine this translated into a physical product!"

"Only someone with exceptional training could produce work of this caliber. Professor Whitaker's students never cease to amaze."

"Ms. Sterling, your future in design is limitless!"

Industry experts surrounded Vanessa's displayed work, their praise flowing endlessly. Vanessa beamed with pride while Eleanor stood nearby, radiating maternal satisfaction.

The shadow that Evelyn's presence had cast over Vanessa seemed to dissipate completely in this moment of triumph.

"Our Vanessa has an innate gift for design," Eleanor proclaimed loudly. "Though only a sophomore, she's devoted countless hours to perfecting her craft."

Eleanor's expression turned particularly smug when she noticed Evelyn approaching.

"Professor Whitaker has already expressed interest in mentoring Vanessa for her graduate studies. His recognition speaks volumes about her exceptional talent!"

"Unlike some individuals who lack proper training yet insist on inserting themselves where they don't belong," Eleanor added pointedly, though careful not to name names.

Evelyn caught the thinly veiled jab but chose to ignore it. Her attention was completely captured by the design everyone was raving about.

When her eyes finally landed on the artwork, Evelyn froze in stunned silence.
###Chapter 165 The Stolen Masterpiece

"Ms. Sterling, this extraordinary design must have an incredible backstory. Would you share it with us?" A fashion journalist leaned forward eagerly.

Vanessa's lips curved into a practiced smile as she adjusted her designer dress. "This collection was born from an avant-garde exhibition I attended in Milan last summer."

She gestured dramatically toward the mannequin. "The bold geometric patterns represent the breaking of traditional gender roles. Notice how the asymmetric hemline challenges conventional beauty standards."

"The hand-stitched embroidery took three artisans over two hundred hours to complete. Every thread tells a story of feminine resilience." Vanessa's voice dripped with false modesty.

The crowd murmured appreciatively. A silver-haired woman in Chanel reached for Vanessa's hand. "Darling, your vision is revolutionary! We must feature you in next month's Couture Quarterly."

A man in a tailored Armani suit pressed his card into her palm. "Vanessa, my design house would kill to have talent like yours. Name your price when you graduate."

Vanessa preened under the attention, her manicured fingers fluttering to her collarbone. Then her gaze collided with Evelyn's across the room.

Those piercing emerald eyes held something dangerous - not admiration, but knowing amusement. Vanessa's champagne flute trembled slightly.

"Everything alright?" Harrison's brow furrowed as he followed Evelyn's gaze.

"Just marveling at the audacity of thieves in broad daylight," Evelyn murmured, swirling her drink.

Harrison opened his mouth to question her when a hush fell over the crowd. Professor Whitaker had arrived with Gregory Hammond in tow.

The renowned design critic looked uncharacteristically polished in his Tom Ford tuxedo, drawing every eye in the gallery.

"Professor Whitaker! Your students have outdone themselves this year!"

"That piece by the window - absolute genius! Your mentorship shines through."

The professor made his way directly to Vanessa's display. Her pulse jumped when he stopped before her work.

"Is this yours?" His voice held quiet intensity.

Vanessa's throat went dry. "Yes, Professor. My senior thesis collection."

Edmund Whitaker studied the garment with clinical precision. "Remarkable craftsmanship for someone your age. The structural integrity of these seams..." He trailed off, fingers hovering over a seam.

Vanessa's mother materialized at her elbow. "Professor, we'd be honored if you'd consider mentoring Vanessa next semester. Your guidance would be priceless."

Gregory cleared his throat. "This is Vanessa Sterling - Nathan Sterling's sister."

A flicker of recognition passed through Edmund's eyes. He nodded approvingly. "You show exceptional promise, Ms. Sterling. With proper training, you could-"

"Except she didn't design this." Evelyn's voice cut through the murmurs like shattered glass.

Every head turned as she stepped forward, the crowd parting instinctively. The temperature in the room seemed to drop ten degrees.

Vanessa's smile froze. Her manicured nails dug into her palms as she watched Evelyn approach the display with the predatory grace of a panther stalking its prey.
###Chapter 166 Where's the Evidence

Evelyn's lips curled into a knowing smirk as she nudged Vanessa Sterling with her elbow.

Vanessa seized the moment. "Professor Whitaker, I'm planning to apply for your master's program next year. I'd be honored to study design under your guidance."

Edmund Whitaker gave an approving nod. "Your work shows promise. Keep developing your skills."

The renowned professor walked away, leaving whispers trailing in his wake.

Eleanor Blackwell practically vibrated with excitement at the professor's response.

She clutched Vanessa's arm. "Darling! This is perfect! You must secure that spot at all costs. The Sterling name depends on it!"

Vanessa's eyes glittered with ambition. "Relax, Mother. That position already has my name on it." She could practically taste the victory.

Then Evelyn Carter appeared like a storm cloud, her expression dark.

Vanessa's stomach dropped inexplicably.

"We need to talk." Evelyn's voice carried an edge that made nearby heads turn.

Vanessa tried to sidestep her, but Evelyn's hand shot out, fingers clamping around her wrist like a vise. "Running away? Guilty conscience?"

Eleanor swooped in like a hawk. "Evelyn Carter! Unhand my daughter this instant!"

Evelyn ignored the older woman, her gaze locked on Vanessa. "I'm offering you one chance. Speak with me privately."

The growing audience exchanged curious glances, their whispers buzzing like angry bees.

Vanessa inhaled sharply. "It's fine, Mother. I'll handle this."

"But—" Eleanor's protest died as she shot Evelyn a venomous look. "What could you possibly have to discuss? Planning more of your schemes?"

Vanessa patted her mother's arm. "Relax. She wouldn't dare make a scene here."

Evelyn's mocking laugh sent chills down Vanessa's spine. Her fingers twisted nervously in the fabric of her designer dress.

Once they reached the empty corridor, Evelyn whirled around. "Vanessa, how exactly—"

Vanessa's pulse jumped.

The moment of reckoning had come.

But the original sketches were safely in her possession now. Without proof, Evelyn's accusations meant nothing.

"I've no idea what you're implying," Vanessa said, lifting her chin.

Evelyn's laugh was ice cold. "Still playing innocent? Look me in the eye and tell me—"

"—that design is truly yours? I've never seen a thief with such audacity."

Vanessa scanned the hallway before hissing, "So what if I copied your sketches? Prove they were ever yours."

"Where's your evidence? Without proof, you're just making empty accusations."

Evelyn's eyes widened at Vanessa's shameless admission.

"You think wealth makes you untouchable? Fine—yes, I recreated every detail from your portfolio."

"But here's the delicious part—who'll believe you now? The great Professor Whitaker certainly won't."

Evelyn shook her head in disbelief. "I've encountered thieves before, but your level of delusion is astounding."

Vanessa crossed her arms triumphantly. "No proof, no case. Keep talking and I'll sue for defamation."

Evelyn actually chuckled then.

She'd come here intending to give this spoiled heiress a chance to come clean quietly. To spare Vanessa's academic future despite everything.

But the girl's arrogance was truly breathtaking.
###Chapter 167 We Can Never Be Friends

Vanessa's expression darkened as Evelyn's gesture failed to impress her.

"Vanessa, I'm offering you one final opportunity." Evelyn's voice carried a quiet warning. "Remove your piece from this exhibition voluntarily, or you'll live to regret it."

The younger woman merely lifted her chin, completely unfazed by the threat.

"Do whatever you want," Vanessa retorted with icy confidence before turning on her heel.

As she pushed through the glass doors, she collided with Gregory. "Gregory? What are you doing here?"

Instead of answering, he tilted his head curiously. "Since when did you and Evelyn become so close?"

Vanessa let out a derisive laugh. "Don't be ridiculous. Friends with her? Now that she's the Lewis heiress, she's completely out of my league." Her words dripped with venomous sarcasm.

"Ah," Gregory nodded, wisely choosing not to pursue the conversation further.

Without another glance, Vanessa strode away, her designer heels clicking sharply against the marble floor.

Once alone, Gregory glanced down at his phone screen where a recording app still ran. His fingers hovered before decisively ending the session and saving the file.

"Ms. Carter," he greeted Evelyn with uncharacteristic politeness when he found her, his usual arrogance noticeably absent.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "What exactly is your relationship with Professor Whitaker?"

A smirk played on Gregory's lips. "We share more than just a last name," he replied with forced lightness. "Though I doubt you'd qualify as his student with your... limited credentials."

The realization struck Evelyn instantly - Gregory was Edmund Whitaker's son. Nathan certainly kept interesting company.

"I see," she said curtly, making to leave.

"Wait, Evelyn!" Gregory called after her, an uncharacteristic hesitation in his voice. "I... owe you an apology."

She turned slowly. "For?"

"My previous behavior," he admitted awkwardly, scratching his nose. "My condescension was... unwarranted."

Evelyn studied him - Nathan's friend actually apologizing?

"Unnecessary," she dismissed. "We simply had differing perspectives." Her tone made it clear she wasn't accepting.

"No, Evelyn," Gregory pressed. "Setting Nathan aside, could we perhaps... start over as friends?"

Her eyes narrowed. She could smell the ulterior motive from miles away.

"Let me guess," Evelyn said coolly. "This apology isn't for me, but for my new social standing. Am I wrong?"

Gregory opened his mouth to protest, but she cut him off. "Save it. I understand perfectly."

She took a deliberate step closer. "But let me make one thing crystal clear - Nathan and I will never share mutual friends." The unspoken message hung between them - they would never be friends.

Gregory's hand brushed against his phone where the recording lay. He'd planned to use it, but now...

"Understood," he conceded. "If not friends, then perhaps civil acquaintances?"

Evelyn offered no reply as she walked away, leaving Gregory staring after her.

The moment she disappeared from view, he pulled out his phone and dialed Nathan's number.

Back in the main exhibition hall, Harrison approached Evelyn. "Let me handle this," he said quietly, already typing on his phone. "I've contacted the curators to have Vanessa's work removed immediately."
###Chapter 168 The Mask Falls Away

Evelyn Carter gave a firm shake of her head, her voice steel-edged. "What belongs to me will be reclaimed by my own hands."

Her gaze locked onto Vanessa Sterling across the crowded gallery.

Vanessa stood bathed in attention, holding court with fashion's elite. Each time their eyes met, Vanessa's lips curled in that infuriating smirk - a silent taunt that screamed 'Try me.'

A server materialized at Vanessa's elbow. "Professor Whitaker requests your presence, Ms. Sterling."

Vanessa inclined her head. "Of course." She excused herself with practiced grace.

Nathan Sterling stood nearby, discussing Vanessa's controversial design with Lawrence Pembroke. "My associate here finds your sister's concept fascinating," Nathan said, gesturing to the industry titan. "He'd appreciate hearing about her creative process."

Vanessa turned her megawatt smile on Pembroke. "The collection explores modern femininity through structural silhouettes," she began smoothly. "Each piece represents the unbreakable spirit of contemporary women."

Pembroke nodded along, but his brow furrowed. "Your vision is undoubtedly compelling, Ms. Sterling. Yet..." He hesitated, choosing his words carefully. "There appears to be a dissonance between your narrative and the actual craftsmanship."

Vanessa's smile faltered. "Are you suggesting my work isn't authentic?" Her voice carried across the suddenly quiet room.

Pembroke raised a conciliatory hand. "Not at all. Only that the execution seems... incongruent with the stated inspiration."

Vanessa's gaze darted to Evelyn, then back to the gathering crowd. "This isn't the first challenge to my integrity tonight." Her voice turned theatrical. "Someone already accused me of theft earlier."

A shocked murmur rippled through the gallery. Nathan's expression darkened.

But Vanessa pressed on, emboldened by the attention. "Ms. Carter? Care to repeat your allegations for everyone?"

All eyes turned to Evelyn, who regarded Vanessa like a scientist observing a particularly fascinating specimen. When she spoke, her voice cut through the tension like a scalpel. "Since you insist - yes, that design isn't yours. Every stitch, every seam belongs to someone else."

The gallery erupted.

"Is she serious?"
"Vanessa Sterling plagiarizing? Impossible!"
"Wait, look at Vanessa's face - she's not even denying it!"

Vanessa stood her ground, chin lifted defiantly as the crowd surged closer, hungry for scandal. The mask of composure never slipped - not even when facing certain ruin.

Evelyn watched, arms crossed, as Vanessa launched into her rehearsed defense. The game had changed, but only one of them had brought the receipts. And Evelyn intended to make this humiliation unforgettable.
###Chapter 169 Show Me Your Proof

"You claim this isn't my original work?" Vanessa Sterling crossed her arms, her voice dripping with arrogance. "Then prove it. Right here, right now. If you can't, I'll have my lawyers sue you for slander."

Her confidence stemmed from certainty - Evelyn Carter couldn't possibly have any real evidence. The stolen designs had been carefully scrubbed of all traces.

Evelyn met her gaze steadily. "You're correct about one thing - I don't possess physical proof."

The crowd erupted in murmurs.

"Accusing someone without evidence? How unprofessional!"

"This is defamation, plain and simple."

"I always thought Ms. Carter was classier than this."

A spectator whispered loudly, "They were stepsisters, you know. This reeks of petty revenge."

Vanessa's lips curled in satisfaction as public opinion swung in her favor. Today would be Evelyn's humiliation.

"Since you can't back up your claims," Vanessa taunted, "perhaps a public apology might save what's left of your reputation."

Evelyn's laugh was sharp as broken crystal. "Apologize? To a thief? Don't flatter yourself."

Vanessa's face darkened. "You're digging your own grave, Evelyn."

"The reason I lack evidence," Evelyn continued calmly, "is because you stole the original sketches from my private collection."

Vanessa's finger shot out accusingly. "Lies!"

"Truth has a way of surfacing," Evelyn countered.

The murmurs shifted tone as Evelyn's unshakable composure made some reconsider.

"Could Ms. Sterling actually have stolen the design?"

"Ms. Carter seems so certain..."

Vanessa's pulse quickened. "Name one shred of evidence!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "You can't even properly explain your own design concept. Doesn't that strike you as odd?"

"I explained it perfectly!" Vanessa snapped.

Lawrence Pembroke, the industry expert observing nearby, shook his head. "Actually, Ms. Sterling's explanation contradicts the design's apparent inspiration."

Evelyn nodded. "This collection isn't just about female independence. It's about the masks women wear - daughter, wife, mother - and the selves we lose beneath those roles."

Her voice carried through the space, reaching even Nathan Sterling who had just arrived. From his position several yards back, he watched Evelyn command the room, an unfamiliar warmth stirring in his chest.

"The true message," Evelyn continued, "is about women reclaiming their identities beyond society's expectations. About loving our authentic selves."

A hush fell over the crowd before erupting into applause.

Lawrence stepped forward. "Exactly! That's the essence I sensed in this work! Are you claiming to be the original designer?"

Evelyn's gaze never wavered. "I created these pieces three years ago."

Back when she'd closed her boutique after marrying Nathan. She'd stored her remaining designs in the Sterling family archives.

Never imagining her stepsister would rifle through her private things and steal them.
###Chapter 170 It Ends Here and Now

Vanessa's face twisted into something ugly, but pride kept her from backing down.

"Evelyn, must you spread lies in front of everyone? Where's your evidence?" Her voice dripped with venom. "Do you think mere words can rewrite reality?"

Though guilt gnawed at her, Vanessa clung to defiance, scanning the crowd for allies.

Then she saw him—Nathan. Her lifeline.

Desperation flashed in her eyes as she rushed to his side.

"Nathan! Your ex-wife is framing me." Her voice cracked. "She's so bitter about us that she's sabotaging my career for revenge—right here, in public!"

She yanked Nathan toward Evelyn, but Evelyn's expression remained ice-cold.

Oddly, despite standing mere feet apart, Nathan felt an ocean between them.

If Vanessa were exposed as a thief tonight, her design career would implode. Years of study, wasted. Her future, obliterated.

As her brother, truth be damned—Nathan couldn’t let that happen.

His first words were a blade: "Evelyn, must you always stir chaos?"

For a heartbeat, Evelyn thought she’d misheard. Then her lips curled into a humorless smile.

"Chaos?" Her laugh was brittle. "In your eyes, is justice just 'chaos'? Or is theft now trivial?"

Nathan’s jaw tightened.

"Vanessa wouldn’t steal. This is a misunderstanding."

His defense was instant. Predictable. Blood always trumped truth.

"You’re overreacting. Do you honestly think—"

Evelyn cut him off. "Nathan, must I tolerate everything she does? Am I supposed to be a saint?"

His voice softened, placating. "Let’s drop this."

The absurdity struck Evelyn like a slap.

"Drop it?" Her laugh was sharp. "Should I ignore theft because she’s your sister? How noble."

Nathan’s face darkened. "I misjudged you."

Evelyn shrugged. "Better late than never. Especially since we’re divorced."

Her indifference infuriated him, but she gave him no quarter.

"How amusing," she continued, voice glacial. "Mr. Sterling, defending plagiarism for family loyalty. But deception has consequences."

The crowd murmured agreement. The event organizer paled, humiliation creeping up his neck.

"Ms. Carter is right," he admitted heavily. "Plagiarism is a stain on our industry. We must condemn it—publicly."

His gaze met Evelyn’s. "If you have proof, present it. Let facts decide."

The air crackled with tension. This ended tonight.
###Chapter 171 The Smoking Gun

Vanessa Sterling crossed her arms with smug satisfaction, her lips curling into a triumphant smirk as she turned to face Evelyn Carter. The murmurs of the crowd pressed in around them like an invisible force.

"You heard them, Ms. Carter. Either show us proof or I'll be dialing the police," Vanessa taunted, waving her phone like a weapon. Nathan Sterling shot her a warning glance, but she ignored him completely.

Nearby, Gregory Hammond's fingers twitched toward his pocket where he kept the damning recording. But then his gaze locked with Evelyn's.

Evelyn stood perfectly composed, the picture of unshakable confidence. "Tell me, Vanessa," she said, her voice smooth as silk, "are you absolutely certain I have no evidence? How amusing - I always come prepared, especially when my professional integrity is at stake."

Vanessa's smirk faltered. "Excuse me?"

Without acknowledging her, Evelyn addressed the gathered crowd. "The proof is right here - hidden in plain sight on this very design."

Confused murmurs rippled through the audience.

"What could possibly be there? It looks like a normal design to me."

"Stop playing games! Show us already."

"Did you embed some sort of digital watermark, Ms. Carter?"

A knowing smile played on Evelyn's lips. "Precisely. Had Vanessa simply been inspired by my work, it might have gone unnoticed. But she copied it pixel for pixel - and that was her fatal mistake."

With deliberate movements, Evelyn retrieved the design. Then, in one fluid motion, she inverted it before the entire assembly.

"Observe the neckline carefully. It's my professional signature to embed a discreet marker there." Her finger traced nearly invisible lines. "These subtle indentations form my initials - 'EC'."

Gasps erupted as the crowd leaned in. There, barely visible but unmistakable upon closer inspection, were the telltale initials.

The revelation hit like a thunderclap.

"Those are definitely Ms. Carter's initials! How dare Vanessa plagiarize so brazenly!"

"Not just stealing - she couldn't even copy it properly!"

"All those crocodile tears earlier! She should be banned from the design industry!"

"Disgraceful behavior for someone calling themselves a professional!"

Vanessa's face drained of color. She staggered back as if physically struck, her manicured nails digging into her palms. This wasn't supposed to happen - Evelyn wasn't supposed to have an ace up her sleeve!

The weight of dozens of scornful stares pressed down on Vanessa. She wished the floor would swallow her whole. Even Nathan's expression had darkened considerably - his earlier defense of her now making him complicit in her humiliation.

Amidst the chaos, only one person seemed genuinely pleased with this turn of events.

Gregory Hammond watched the scene unfold with newfound admiration. Evelyn had outmaneuvered them all with such elegant simplicity. He almost regretted not getting to use his recording - almost.

Nathan's voice cut through the murmurs like steel. "Ms. Sterling, while I don't expect perfection from designers your age, plagiarism violates the most fundamental ethics of our profession." His disapproval hung heavy in the air.
###Chapter 172 Reaping What You Sow

"Professor Whitaker, please let me explain!" Vanessa's voice trembled with desperation. "I acted without thinking, and I regret it deeply."

Tears streamed down her face as she clutched the professor's sleeve. "I'm begging for your mercy! I swear I'll never repeat this mistake."

Edmund Whitaker remained stone-faced. "Ms. Sterling, I cannot in good conscience recommend you for my graduate program." His voice carried finality. "While your grades might meet requirements, your ethical conduct does not."

Vanessa's world crumbled around her.

In their tight-knit fashion community, rejection from the renowned Professor Whitaker would effectively blacklist her from the industry.

Eleanor Blackwell stood frozen in shock.

She rushed forward. "Professor, my daughter made one small error! Give her another chance - she'll prove herself worthy!" Her manicured nails dug into her palms.

Nearby, Evelyn Carter observed quietly. "Academic integrity matters more than perfect grades. Perhaps another career path would be more... suitable."

Eleanor whirled on her. "Saints aren't perfect either! Vanessa's entire future hangs in the balance over one mistake!" Her voice cracked with hysteria.

Whispers spread through the gathered crowd like wildfire.

Professor Whitaker ignored the outburst, turning instead to Evelyn. "Ms. Carter, I've heard remarkable things about your boutique." His tone warmed considerably. "Your designs show true originality - exactly what our industry needs."

Evelyn inclined her head gracefully. "You honor me with such praise, Professor. I'll continue striving for excellence."

The professor nodded approvingly before departing with Lawrence Pembroke.

"Professor!" Eleanor called after him futilely, her designer heels stamping the marble floor.

As the crowd dispersed, gossip about the exhibition disaster already began spreading through Sterling Enterprises' elite circles.

Eleanor's carefully constructed plans for Vanessa's future lay in ruins.

She turned on Evelyn with venom in her eyes. "Why must you constantly interfere? What grudge do you hold against my daughter?"

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "Still blaming others for consequences you brought upon yourself?"

"This is petty vengeance!" Eleanor shrieked, hand raised to strike.

Nathan Sterling caught her wrist mid-swing. "Enough."

Eleanor's defiance evaporated instantly. "Nathan, your sister's career is ruined because of this woman!" Her voice turned saccharine. "You must help Vanessa!"

Nathan's expression remained glacial. "Actions have consequences."

"How can you say that about your own sister?" Eleanor gasped.

His next words fell like a guillotine. "Vanessa, you're withdrawing from Sterling University effective immediately. You'll take an entry-level position at headquarters - no design department access."

Vanessa's wail echoed through the gallery. "Nathan, please!"

"No discussion." His voice brooked no argument. "Refuse, and I'll freeze all your accounts immediately."
###Chapter 173 Pushing Her Away

Vanessa stood frozen in shock, her entire body trembling under Nathan's unyielding glare. The air between them crackled with tension.

"Mother..." she whispered hoarsely.

Eleanor Blackwell gasped at her son's harsh pronouncement. "Nathan, have you lost your mind?"

"Your constant coddling created this monster," Nathan countered icily. "Now she'll face the consequences."

Eleanor's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water. "But she's your—"

Humiliation burned through Vanessa like wildfire. Without another word, she turned and fled through the crowded room.

"Vanessa! Wait!" Eleanor called desperately, rushing after her daughter.

Evelyn Carter observed the family drama with detached amusement. Justice, however belated, had been served.

Harrison Whitmore materialized at her side, his warm hand settling on her shoulder. "It's over. Let's go."

She gave a curt nod. "Indeed."

Harrison's glacial stare locked onto Nathan, making the Sterling heir visibly flinch. The sight of them standing together seemed to physically pain him.

"Happy now that you've destroyed my sister?" Nathan spat, hands clenched in his pockets.

Evelyn's lips curled into a feline smile. "I didn't dig her grave. She brought the shovel herself."

Nathan barely recognized this version of Evelyn. The woman he'd married would never have been so ruthless.

"You could have shown mercy," he argued. "Vanessa's just a girl."

"Mercy?" Evelyn scoffed, tossing her chestnut hair. "Respect is earned, not given."

Harrison stepped forward, his voice dripping with menace. "Your family's reputation is the least of your worries, Sterling. How's that merger with Horizon Technologies going?"

Nathan's face darkened instantly. The recent business losses had been catastrophic—all orchestrated by Kingsley Industries.

"Are you declaring war?" Nathan growled, his pride wounded.

Harrison smirked. "Consider it already declared. May the best man win."

Their gazes clashed like dueling swords. Harrison had been waiting years for this moment of reckoning.

"Evelyn," Harrison murmured, extending his hand.

She hesitated briefly before placing her palm in his. The warmth of his touch sent unexpected sparks up her arm.

As they walked away, Nathan's fists clenched until his knuckles turned white. Gregory Hammond emerged from the shadows, shaking his head.

"Keep this up, and you'll lose her forever," Gregory warned quietly.

The truth of those words settled like lead in Nathan's stomach as he watched Evelyn disappear into the night—hand in hand with his greatest rival.
###Chapter 174 A Private Invitation

Nathan Sterling's brow furrowed in confusion.

Gregory Hammond didn't mince words. He pressed play on his phone, letting the damning recording speak for itself. "This is why I called you here today."

As the audio played, Nathan's face darkened with each passing second.

"Evelyn gave Vanessa every opportunity to walk away," Gregory said firmly. "But your sister kept pushing. Everyone has their limits, Nathan."

Nathan's hands balled into fists at his sides. A crushing wave of remorse hit him. For the first time in his life, the formidable CEO stood frozen, utterly lost.

After a long silence, he whispered hoarsely, "I was wrong about her..."

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter was exiting the venue when a young man hurried after her. "Ms. Carter! A moment, please!"

She turned, studying the unfamiliar face. "Can I help you?"

"I'm Professor Whitaker's assistant," he explained, presenting an embossed business card with elegant gold lettering. "The professor asked me to deliver this personally."

Evelyn's breath caught.

An invitation.

"Professor Whitaker regrets not being able to speak with you properly today due to the crowds," the assistant continued. "He'd be honored if you'd join him for a private meeting at his residence this weekend."

Her pulse quickened.

Edmund Whitaker. The legendary design icon whose approval could launch careers.

"Please convey my deepest gratitude," Evelyn managed, carefully tucking the precious card into her purse. "I'll be there without fail."

"Safe travels, Ms. Carter."

In the car, Evelyn couldn't stop staring at the invitation. A delighted laugh escaped her lips.

Harrison Whitmore raised an eyebrow. "That must be some invitation. You're glowing like you just won the lottery."

"It might as well be!" Evelyn beamed. "This is from Edmund Whitaker himself!"

"Ah," Harrison nodded appreciatively. "Now I understand the sparkle in your eyes."

"It's... more than I dared hope for," she admitted softly. At the very least, it meant her designs had caught the master's attention.

"I have to tell Olivia!"

Her text to Olivia Sinclair was met with three shocked exclamation points followed by: You're meeting THE Edmund Whitaker??? I might actually die of jealousy.

Evelyn grinned. Want to come with?

Seriously?!

Of course.

She could practically see Olivia's ecstatic face through the phone. Screw the boutique! We're going!

Tucking her phone away, Evelyn gazed at the passing cityscape. A shadow of melancholy flickered across her features.

Then her phone buzzed insistently.

She glanced at the screen - and immediately rejected the call.

It rang again. And again. Each time, her finger stabbed the decline button with increasing determination.

"Trouble?" Harrison asked, noting her tense expression.

Evelyn didn't bother hiding it. "Nathan Sterling."

As she spoke, she pulled up her call log and blocked the number with a decisive tap. A weight lifted from her shoulders. Peace at last.

Across town, Nathan's face turned thunderous as the call disconnected yet again. Beside him, Simon wisely kept silent, watching his boss's grip tighten around the phone until the screen cracked.
###Chapter 175 Her Hidden Talent in Fashion

Simon hesitated before delivering the urgent message.

Taking a deep breath, he spoke. "Mr. Sterling, I just received word from Blackwood Penitentiary. Ms. Delaney has attempted suicide."

The office fell into stunned silence.

Isabella's name hadn't been mentioned in months.

Nathan's jaw tightened. "Her condition?"

"Guards intervened in time. She's been transferred to the medical ward." Simon swallowed hard. "She's requesting to see you."

After being convicted for orchestrating that near-fatal car accident, Isabella had been sentenced to ten years. With the Delaney family's downfall and Alistair's disappearance, Nathan had severed all ties.

"Deny the request," Nathan commanded icily.

"Yes, sir." Simon turned to leave.

"Wait." Nathan's voice stopped him. "Where's Vanessa now?"

"At the Sterling estate, I believe."

"Freeze all her accounts immediately. Not a single transaction gets approved."

Simon's eyebrows shot up before he composed himself. "Right away, Mr. Sterling."

Alone in his penthouse office, Nathan stared at the glittering cityscape below. The vibrant lights mocked his hollow emptiness.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had been buried under mountains of paperwork at Kingsley Industries all week.

When Saturday finally arrived, she'd canceled all plans for much-needed rest.

At dawn, Olivia's text buzzed on Evelyn's nightstand. "Up yet? I'm outside!"

Evelyn groaned, squinting at her phone. "It's 6 AM..."

She dragged herself to the window, pulling back the curtains to reveal Olivia's cherry-red convertible.

"Babe, the sun's barely up," Evelyn texted back.

Olivia's reply came instantly. "This is Professor Whitaker we're talking about! Showing up late would be disrespectful!"

Evelyn rolled her eyes but hurried through her morning routine.

The Whitaker estate sat in Royal Vista's exclusive eastern enclave - once barren land now transformed into the city's most coveted address.

As they entered, whispers followed Evelyn.

"Isn't that Evelyn Carter? What's the Kingsley CEO doing here?"

"Rumor has it Professor Whitaker personally invited her."

Nearby, Cassandra Winslow's perfectly sculpted eyebrows knitted together. "Why would Edmund invite some business executive? What does she know about design?"

A guest chuckled. "Haven't you heard? She owns that boutique all the socialites are obsessed with."

Cassandra's scrutinizing gaze intensified. "I had no idea she dabbled in fashion."

"The waitlist for her custom pieces is six months long," another attendee added.

Cassandra knew today's gathering was actually preparation for Pamore's inaugural fashion week - an event Edmund himself would headline.

Olivia nudged Evelyn excitedly. "This sounds incredible! Aren't you thrilled?"

Evelyn smirked. "We'll see."

Large-scale fashion events meant grueling work, but the energy in the room was electric.

Edmund addressed the crowd. "For this show, I want full participation from everyone here."

He paused dramatically. "However, we still need to select our lead designer. Any volunteers?"

Cassandra's eyes lit up. This was her moment.

"I'd love the opportunity, Professor," she declared confidently.

Edmund gave a noncommittal hum, making Cassandra's smile falter. After five years as his protégé with an impressive portfolio, she'd expected immediate endorsement.

Instead, Edmund turned to Evelyn. "Ms. Carter, what are your thoughts?"

Every head swiveled toward Evelyn, expressions ranging from curiosity to outright envy.
###Chapter 176 Pamore Fashion Show

"Professor Whitaker has arrived!" someone announced, causing Cassandra to turn her attention toward the entrance.

"Professor!" Cassandra displayed a respectful demeanor.

Edmund gave a slight nod before walking past her directly to Evelyn. "Ms. Carter!" he called out warmly.

Evelyn looked pleasantly surprised as she greeted him. "Professor Whitaker!"

Edmund smiled. "This is an informal gathering, no need for formalities."

Everyone present noticed the special attention Edmund was showing Evelyn.

Cassandra, standing nearby, quickly approached. "Professor, so this is the Ms. Carter you've spoken so highly of," she remarked.

Extending her hand toward Evelyn, Cassandra introduced herself. "Hello, I'm Cassandra, Professor Whitaker's top student!"

Edmund added, "Cassandra is my most accomplished protégé. She has exceptional design talent. I hope you two can exchange ideas and learn from each other."

Evelyn accepted the handshake. "Hello, I'm Evelyn. It's a pleasure to meet you."

Their brief exchange was polite yet charged with unspoken tension.

"I've gathered everyone here today to discuss an important matter regarding Pamore!" Edmund announced to the assembled designers.

Before he could continue, someone interrupted. "Is this about next month's fashion show in Pamore?"

Edmund nodded. "Each of you represents the finest fashion talent in Pamore. I believe together we can create something extraordinary for this event."

Excited murmurs spread through the crowd as designers began whispering among themselves.

"This will be Pamore's first major fashion showcase, and the world will be watching. If we deliver exceptional designs, we'll put our city on the global fashion map."

"Previous years' shows were always held overseas, but having it here in Pamore is both an honor and an incredible opportunity for us."

Edmund continued, "I'd like us to incorporate local cultural elements into our designs - show the world the unique aesthetic we have to offer."

Olivia, listening to the discussion, nudged Evelyn. "This sounds amazing! Aren't you excited?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "We'll see," she replied noncommittally, though the scale of the project clearly intrigued her.

Observing the group's enthusiasm, Edmund continued, "I want everyone's participation in this event."

"However," he paused dramatically, "we still need to determine who will serve as lead designer. Any suggestions?"

At this, Cassandra's eyes lit up with anticipation. This was the moment she'd been waiting for.

The other designers exchanged hesitant glances, none daring to volunteer for such a demanding role that required both exceptional skill and leadership.

"Professor..." Cassandra was the first to break the silence. "I believe I'm ready for this challenge."

Edmund gave a noncommittal hum, his lack of immediate endorsement causing Cassandra's smile to falter.

She'd studied under Edmund for five years! Her portfolio included numerous acclaimed designs. She was more than qualified for this position.

Yet Edmund seemed reluctant to give her this opportunity.

"Ms. Carter," Edmund suddenly addressed Evelyn, "what are your thoughts?" All eyes immediately turned toward Evelyn.

The crowd's reaction was mixed - confusion, surprise, and not a small amount of envy rippled through the room.
###Chapter 177 The Challenge

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly as all eyes in the room turned toward her. She could feel her pulse quickening beneath her skin.

"I'm not the most knowledgeable about this particular fashion show," Evelyn said, her voice measured. "I'm certain my seniors have far more experience than I do."

Her words carried a quiet humility that didn't go unnoticed.

Edmund Whitaker nodded approvingly at Evelyn's modest demeanor. It was refreshing compared to the usual arrogance he encountered in the industry.

"Ms. Carter," Edmund said suddenly, "how would you feel about taking the lead designer position for this show?"

The room erupted in murmurs.

This was an unexpected turn. Edmund was clearly showing remarkable confidence in Evelyn. But was it wise to appoint someone so unproven?

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond, but others beat her to it.

"Professor Whitaker," someone interjected, "with all due respect, Ms. Carter lacks sufficient experience for such a high-profile project."

"Exactly!" another voice chimed in. "Cassandra would be far more suitable. She's handled numerous successful projects with flawless execution."

"Cassandra's design aesthetic is truly unique. Among our peers, her skills are unparalleled."

The consensus was clear - everyone favored Cassandra Winslow over Evelyn.

This wasn't surprising. Most only knew Evelyn through industry gossip and speculation. How could they trust an unknown designer with such an important event?

If the show failed, it would reflect poorly on everyone involved.

"Professor, please reconsider!" several voices urged.

Cassandra exhaled quietly, some tension leaving her shoulders. Yet she remained composed, carefully studying Edmund's expression before speaking up.

Olivia Sinclair, listening to the debate, nudged Evelyn. "This is getting intense! Aren't you interested?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "We'll see," she murmured.

Large-scale fashion shows meant grueling work. Was she ready for that commitment?

Edmund raised a hand to quiet the room. "For this event, I want everyone's participation. However," he continued, "the lead designer position remains open for discussion. Any suggestions?"

At this, Cassandra's eyes lit up with anticipation. This was the opportunity she'd been waiting for.

The room fell silent as people exchanged hesitant glances. No one dared volunteer - the role demanded exceptional skill and experience.

"Professor..." Cassandra finally broke the silence. "I'd like to put myself forward for consideration."

Edmund made a noncommittal sound, neither agreeing nor refusing.

Cassandra pressed her lips together, disappointment flickering across her face. Five years studying under Edmund. Countless successful designs. Surely she was qualified?

Yet Edmund seemed reluctant to give her the chance.

"Ms. Carter," Edmund suddenly addressed Evelyn again, redirecting all attention to her. "What are your thoughts?"

The room's atmosphere shifted instantly - confusion, surprise, and not a little envy directed at Evelyn.
###Chapter 178 This Damn Competitiveness

Cassandra Winslow saw nothing wrong with her words.

To her, the moment Edmund Whitaker chose Evelyn Carter over her, their teacher-student bond had already fractured.

She pressed her lips together and said bluntly, "Professor, your chosen candidate doesn’t impress me."

Edmund’s expression darkened.

Evelyn, noticing this, made her decision. "Ms. Winslow, I accept your challenge."

Cassandra smirked. "Good. At least you have spine. But let me be clear—I won’t hold back. Prepare to lose."

Her confidence was unshakable.

Evelyn remained composed. "We’ll see. Though, Ms. Winslow, respect for our mentors should never be forgotten."

Cassandra’s face twisted. "Who do you think you are, lecturing me?"

"Not a lecture," Evelyn countered smoothly. "Just a reminder."

Cassandra shot Edmund a look, her pride stung.

"Professor, I—"

He waved her off. "Enough. We’re relics of the past. The stage belongs to you now."

His gaze shifted between them. "Prove yourselves. The audience will decide who deserves the title."

Cassandra’s eyes gleamed with ruthless determination.

She had to win.

"Evelyn, let’s settle this with skill. Three days. Bring your best work—if you even have any."

Evelyn didn’t flinch. "Agreed. May the best design speak for itself."

Their locked gazes crackled with tension.

Without another word, Cassandra spun on her heel and left.

The onlookers, seasoned in drama, exchanged amused glances.

One man couldn’t resist stirring the pot.

"Edmund, don’t be rash. Cassandra’s been your star pupil for years. Why humiliate her for a novice?"

His mocking eyes flicked to Evelyn. "The outcome’s obvious. Though…" He chuckled. "I suppose you’ll regret this."

The crowd tittered. Only Edmund remained unfazed.

"Patience. The results aren’t in yet. Don’t celebrate prematurely—the slowest arrow often strikes truest."

No one dared argue.

"Fine. We’ll see in three days."

As the room emptied, only Evelyn, Olivia Sinclair, and Edmund remained.

Olivia, ever perceptive, excused herself. "I’ll wait in the car."

Alone, Evelyn finally voiced her doubt.

"Professor… why me?"

Edmund cut her off gently. "Don’t overthink it. Just create."

His faith was unwavering.

Evelyn swallowed her questions. She wouldn’t fail him.

"I won’t let you down."
###Chapter 179 His Thoughtfulness

Evelyn walked back into her office with determined steps. She handed off all the less critical projects to Maxwell without hesitation.

Her focus shifted entirely to reviewing the extensive materials for the upcoming fashion exhibition. Time was slipping through her fingers.

As evening descended, the executive floor of Kingsley Industries remained illuminated. The glow from Evelyn's office window cut through the darkness.

Harrison approached with an armful of documents. Through the glass, he saw Evelyn completely immersed in her work. The sight made his expression soften involuntarily.

He rapped his knuckles against the door before pushing it open.

The scene that greeted him was chaotic - design sketches scattered across the floor like fallen leaves. Harrison knelt down, gathering each one carefully.

Evelyn sat chewing her pencil eraser, her forehead creased with frustration.

When she spotted Harrison, her professional facade crumbled instantly.

"What am I going to do? My mind's completely blank - I can't sketch anything worthwhile!" Her voice trembled with stress.

Harrison organized the collected designs before approaching her. "If the ideas aren't coming, you need to step away. Forcing it won't help."

Evelyn bit her lower lip anxiously.

"But I've already wasted an entire day. Only forty-eight hours remain."

Harrison reached out, gently smoothing her hair before taking the pencil from her fingers. He clasped her hand firmly.

"Come with me. Let's get some air."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "What? Where are we going?"

Harrison maintained his mysterious smile as he guided her toward the elevator. Evelyn had to quicken her pace to match his long strides.

They descended to the underground parking garage in silence.

Harrison opened the passenger door of his car. Evelyn hesitated. "Harrison, what's this about?"

"You'll see," he replied, starting the engine with a smooth purr.

As the city lights blurred past the windows, Evelyn felt her tension gradually easing.

The car navigated through downtown before turning onto a charming cobblestone street lined with historic buildings.

Harrison found parking near an impressive neoclassical structure.

Evelyn's eyes widened in recognition. "The Arts District? Why are we here?"

Harrison removed the keys from the ignition. "Inspiration hunt," he said simply.

Though skeptical, Evelyn followed him out into the crisp night air.

The cultural center buzzed with evening activity - couples strolling, street performers entertaining, and families enjoying the vibrant atmosphere.

Their footsteps fell into sync as they walked along the brick pathway, their silhouettes blending perfectly in the golden streetlight.

"Harrison, look!" Evelyn suddenly gripped his arm, pointing toward a gathered crowd.

Harrison followed her gaze. "Ah, a shadow puppet performance. Want to check it out?"

Having grown up abroad, Evelyn found the traditional art form fascinating. The way the puppeteers manipulated intricate silhouettes against the illuminated screen captivated her.

"How does this work exactly?" she whispered.

Harrison pointed to the artists behind the screen. "See how they control the puppets while narrating the story? They combine folk music with contemporary pop to create something entirely new."

"It's a modern interpretation of traditional Kidhnian performing arts," he explained.

Evelyn nodded, fascinated. "Let's get closer."

They maneuvered through the crowd until they reached the front. The performance was a contemporary retelling of the classic "East Side Story."

Evelyn became completely absorbed. Even after the final curtain, she remained spellbound.

"That was incredible!" she exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with newfound energy. The creative block that had plagued her all day seemed to melt away under the streetlights.
###Chapter 180 Fountain of Inspiration

Harrison chuckled softly. "Shall we explore further?"

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with wonder. "Could there possibly be anything more breathtaking than this?"

He gave her a mysterious smile. "Just wait and see."

Taking her hand, Harrison guided Evelyn down a cobblestone alley where a troupe of flamenco dancers performed with fiery passion.

Next, they discovered a hidden atelier filled with intricate lacework. The delicate patterns whispered stories of centuries-old craftsmanship, wrapping them in a cocoon of timeless elegance.

As they turned the corner, a quaint ceramics studio caught Evelyn's attention. Her breath hitched at the sight of hand-painted porcelain figurines glowing under warm studio lights. "Harrison," she gasped, "now I understand why you brought me here tonight."

The delicate ceramics triggered a flood of inspiration. Evelyn's mind raced with connections between the traditional motifs and her fashion collection. The creative spark burned so brightly she could almost see the designs materializing before her.

"Quick! I need a pen!" Evelyn demanded, her voice trembling with excitement.

Harrison produced a fountain pen from his jacket pocket. When she frantically searched for paper, he simply raised an eyebrow at her sudden panic.

"My mind is overflowing with ideas!" She dashed into the ceramics studio, grabbing a stack of tracing paper from a worktable.

The studio owner frowned disapprovingly until Harrison discreetly slipped several hundred-dollar bills into his palm. The man promptly vanished into the back room.

Evelyn's hand flew across the paper with feverish intensity. Harrison watched, mesmerized, as bold strokes transformed into an exquisite gown design blending modern silhouettes with traditional ceramic patterns.

"Look!" She thrust the sketch toward him, her face alight with triumph. "This collection will showcase our cultural heritage to the world!"

Harrison studied the intricate design. The flowing lines captured both contemporary elegance and timeless tradition. "It's perfect," he murmured. "This could redefine global perceptions of our culture."

Evelyn practically vibrated with creative energy. "Imagine the impact when international buyers see how we've reinterpreted these traditional elements! We're not just designing clothes - we're telling our nation's story through fashion."

As she spoke animatedly, Harrison found himself captivated by her passion. Without thinking, he reached out to tuck a stray lock of hair behind her ear. The intimate gesture made them both freeze momentarily.

"We should return to the office," Evelyn said abruptly, gathering her sketches.

Harrison simply nodded, his throat suddenly tight.

By midnight, Evelyn's office resembled a creative warzone - sketches covered every surface, fabric swatches draped over chairs. Harrison remained steadfast at her side, fetching coffee and offering quiet suggestions.

Eventually, exhaustion won. Evelyn's head drooped onto a pile of designs, her breathing slowing to the steady rhythm of sleep.

Harrison gently lifted her into his arms, marveling at how perfectly she fit against his chest. As he laid her on the lounge sofa, he couldn't resist brushing his lips against her forehead in a featherlight kiss.

"Sleep well, my brilliant designer," he whispered before quietly shutting the door behind him.
###Chapter 181 You Followed Me

The night passed in deep slumber for Evelyn, who didn't stir until midday sunlight streamed through the office windows.

A sharp knock shattered the silence.

Evelyn stirred, the silk blanket slipping from her shoulders as she blinked at her unfamiliar surroundings. The realization hit her - she'd fallen asleep in her Kingsley Industries office again.

"Come in!" she called out, hastily straightening her blouse.

The door swung open to reveal Maxwell, balancing a breakfast tray with practiced ease. "Good afternoon, Ms. Carter," he said with a respectful nod.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow in silent question.

"Mr. Whitmore's orders," Maxwell explained, setting down the tray. "He's quite attentive when it comes to your needs."

A flush crept up Evelyn's neck as she spotted the handwritten note beside her coffee.

Morning, Evie. Made sure Max brought your favorite. Don't skip breakfast again.
The signature was accompanied by a ridiculous doodle of a winking face.

Evelyn's lips twitched despite herself. Harrison's boyish charm never failed to amuse her.

The rest of her day disappeared in a blur of fabric swatches and design sketches. By evening, her portfolio case bulged with completed drafts.

As her Porsche purred to life, a familiar silver Bentley accelerated from across the street, matching her turn onto the freeway.

Evelyn's grip tightened on the wheel when she recognized the license plate in her rearview. She slammed the gas pedal, but the Bentley maintained perfect distance behind her.

After twenty minutes of this cat-and-mouse game, Evelyn jerked the wheel, screeching to a halt on a deserted service road.

The Bentley pulled up alongside her.

Evelyn stormed out, heels clicking against asphalt as she rapped sharply on the tinted window. "Nathan Sterling, explain yourself."

The window lowered to reveal Nathan's chiseled profile. "Vanessa left Kingsley University," he said abruptly. "She won't trouble you again."

Surprise flickered across Evelyn's face before she schooled her features. "Your family matters don't concern me, Mr. Sterling."

Nathan exited the car in one fluid motion, his towering frame dwarfing hers. "She's facing consequences for her actions."

Evelyn's laugh held an edge. "And what about your consequences? Shouldn't a grown man know better than to stalk his ex-wife?"

Nathan's jaw clenched, his Adam's apple bobbing. "You and Harrison - how serious is it?"

The question caught Evelyn off guard. "You've been following me?"

"No."

The truth was simpler - he'd been parked outside Kingsley Industries for two days, gathering courage. Two days of watching Harrison come and go at all hours. Two nights of seeing the lights burn late in Evelyn's office, with Harrison's silhouette keeping watch beside hers.
###Chapter 182 Think of Something New

Nathan Sterling's jaw clenched as the green-eyed monster consumed him. The jealousy was eating him alive.

"Do you have feelings for him?" Nathan's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn, demanding an answer to the question tormenting him.

"That's none of your concern." Her voice was ice.

"Is that so?" In one swift motion, Nathan seized her wrist, dragging her toward his waiting car.

Evelyn fought against his grip. "Nathan, release me this instant!"

"Tell me you don't care for Harrison." His voice was raw with emotion.

"You've lost your mind! I can fancy whomever I please!" Her eyes blazed with defiance.

"Say it, Evelyn. I need to hear you say it."

With a sudden twist, she broke free. "I adore him! Completely! Madly! Does that satisfy your curiosity?"

Nathan's crimson-rimmed eyes reflected pure anguish. The pain was physical - as if a blade had been plunged into his chest.

Evelyn seized the moment to put distance between them, her wary gaze never leaving him.

"Listen carefully, Nathan. Whether it's Harrison today or someone else tomorrow - it could never be you. Never." Her voice cracked on the last word.

Nathan's bitter laughter filled the air as his fist connected with the car window. Glass rained onto the pavement.

Crimson droplets began their descent from his wounded arm, painting the concrete below.

Without a backward glance, Evelyn slid into her car and secured the seatbelt. The rearview mirror captured Nathan's motionless form until she accelerated away.

His phone's insistent ringing went ignored until the tenth call forced his attention.

"What?" Nathan barked into the device.

"Mr. Sterling, Ms. Delaney has attempted suicide again." The voice trembled.

Again? Nathan's lips curled in derision. "Can't she be more original?"

"Sir, this is serious! She's been in surgery for two hours. The doctors have issued three critical condition alerts."

Nathan's fists clenched. Every fiber wanted to ignore this melodrama, yet duty prevailed.

"The entire Delaney family is present, including Patriarch Alistair."

This changed everything.

"Which hospital? I'm on my way."

The tires screeched as Nathan sped toward the medical center, unaware that Evelyn was simultaneously arriving at Professor Whitaker's estate with her designs.

The mansion buzzed with industry elites - more seasoned professionals than last time, plus unfamiliar faces.

"Ms. Carter! You've arrived!" Lawrence Pembroke greeted warmly. "Cassandra's already inside."

Evelyn nodded, moving toward Edmund Whitaker.

"Three days for complete designs? Impossible!" A skeptical voice cut through the murmurs. Even veterans needed weeks.

"Ms. Carter," another voice declared, "as agreed, today's submission will be judged by these distinguished peers. The evaluation will be absolutely impartial."
###Chapter 183 Defeat Isn't Shameful

"Today, every vote counts. The designer with fewer votes will be eliminated."

Evelyn offered a faint smile. Having chosen to challenge Cassandra, she accepted these terms without protest.

Edmund admired her composure, his gaze warm with approval.

Cassandra lifted her chin arrogantly as she presented her design. "Now that Ms. Carter has joined us, let's compare our work."

The crowd gathered immediately. Cassandra wore an expression of absolute confidence as she unfurled her blueprint.

The design was revealed.

Gasps of admiration filled the room. No one could deny Cassandra's exceptional talent.

Her technical mastery was evident in every stroke - from the precise linework to the innovative color combinations. This was world-class craftsmanship.

"No wonder she's Professor Whitaker's star pupil. This level of skill takes years to perfect. Cassandra, you've outdone yourself!"

"The silhouette perfectly captures Pamore's latest trends. And this color palette? Fresh, vibrant - ideal for the season."

"If I were scoring, this would easily be a 95 out of 100!"

Cassandra basked in the praise. This collection had consumed months of her life, meticulously crafted to match the fashion show's theme.

She'd completed it weeks ago.

Such acclaim was expected.

Turning to Edmund, she asked, "Professor, your thoughts?"

His expert eyes assessed the design instantly. While not revolutionary, it showcased her full potential.

"Cassandra, this demonstrates remarkable vision and distinctive style. Produced commercially, this line would dominate the market," he declared.

The crowd erupted.

"My vote goes to Cassandra!"

"She has mine too."

"Absolutely deserves it."

Cassandra collected several votes immediately.

Satisfaction warmed her chest. Victory seemed assured.

Out of courtesy to Edmund, she reminded everyone, "Wait - we haven't seen Ms. Carter's work yet."

All eyes turned to Evelyn, brimming with curiosity.

After witnessing Cassandra's brilliance, no one expected Evelyn to surpass it.

Someone called out, "Show us your design, Ms. Carter!"

"Don't feel bad. Cassandra's among our generation's finest designers. Losing to her is no disgrace."

"Cassandra's interpretation of the theme is masterful. Tough act to follow!"

Evelyn remained unshaken. With deliberate movements, she unveiled her design.

Time seemed to freeze. Every eye locked onto the sketch before them.
###Chapter 184 Edmund's Keen Eye

"Is this...could it be...inspired by intricate porcelain designs?"

"I've never witnessed anyone weave such refined motifs reminiscent of delicate china into fabric. It's utterly mesmerizing!"

"This represents a flawless marriage of artistic traditions, capturing the essence of ancient Pamore aesthetics. Absolutely breathtaking!"

"Honestly, I can't tear my eyes away. Observe how those classical elements are seamlessly incorporated there..."

"This transcends mere clothing! It's a celebration of Pamore's cultural legacy. Such brilliance deserves center stage at this event."

Cassandra Winslow studied Evelyn Carter's creation. Beyond astonishment, she found herself speechless. She'd completely neglected the depth of cultural heritage.

Her complexion drained of color instantly.

Her own design had embraced contemporary Pamore trends, aiming to please local tastes. Yet it unintentionally projected desperation to conform.

She'd overlooked Pamore's cultural richness, failing to recognize these elements as the current vogue.

For a local fashion showcase, cultural promotion should take precedence. She'd strayed from this fundamental principle.

Cassandra knew she'd lost - thoroughly and completely.

"Professor Whitaker, your discernment is remarkable to have discovered a talent like Evelyn!"

"Only Evelyn's majestic creations can truly embody Pamore's spirit. She's unquestionably the lead designer."

"My vote goes to Evelyn."

"I'm voting for Evelyn as well."

The consensus became undeniable as opinions shifted overwhelmingly. The decision was nearly unanimous.

Ultimately, Evelyn's votes surpassed Cassandra's by an insurmountable margin.

Though reluctant, Cassandra had to accept the outcome.

"Professor, I concede. Evelyn, the lead designer position rightfully belongs to you."

Evelyn offered a slight nod. "I appreciate your graciousness."

Yet Cassandra couldn't suppress her bitterness. "Since you're leading, Evelyn, ensure this fashion show becomes unforgettable."

"Rest assured, we'll give our utmost," Evelyn responded.

Cassandra's fists clenched. Gripping her dress hem tightly, she exited under the crowd's gaze.

None knew the fury burning within! Months of meticulous preparation undone by a newcomer.

Worse, her status as Edmund's star pupil now hung in the balance.

How could she possibly accept this?

"Congratulations, Evelyn! The show rests in your capable hands now."

"We're confident Pamore's fashion showcase will make global waves."

Edmund's expression radiated approval. "Evelyn, after this event, I have a proposition for your consideration," he teased.

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly. "What might that be?"

"Patience," he chuckled. "We'll discuss it post-show."

Though puzzled, Evelyn smiled and nodded. "Then I'll dedicate myself fully these coming weeks."

Edmund acknowledged her resolve, then added, "I understand Kingsley Industries operates several garment factories?"

Indeed, Kingsley Industries' diverse holdings included textile manufacturing facilities.

Evelyn had anticipated Edmund's interest in this detail.
###Chapter 185 The Best Actress Award

Edmund Whitaker continued, "In my professional opinion, you needn't seek additional investors."

"The entire production for this fashion show can be handled by Kingsley Industries' subsidiary. Even future orders could be—"

Evelyn Carter's eyes sparkled with excitement at his words.

This would significantly enhance Kingsley Industries' market performance!

Overwhelmed with gratitude, she clasped her hands together. "Thank you, Professor Whitaker!"

Edmund waved dismissively. "No need for formalities, my dear."

"I simply recognize exceptional talent when I see it. Someone with your potential shouldn't be wasted."

His praise felt like official validation of Evelyn's abilities.

Blushing slightly, Evelyn tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "Professor Whitaker, you flatter me too much."

Edmund chuckled warmly. "My dear, you've completely won me over!"

The surrounding crowd exchanged knowing glances, detecting deeper implications in Edmund's words.

Everyone in design circles knew Edmund had been searching for a protégé for two years. Countless design students from prestigious institutions had auditioned.

Yet astonishingly, none had met his exacting standards.

Until Evelyn.

Murmurs of envy rippled through the crowd. What incredible fortune this young woman possessed!

Meanwhile at Mercy General Hospital, Nathan Sterling's polished Oxfords clicked rhythmically against the linoleum floor.

Simon intercepted him in the hallway. "Mr. Sterling, Ms. Delaney is stable now. They've moved her to a private room."

Nathan froze mid-step.

A sardonic smirk twisted his lips. "Weren't you just telling me she was at death's door? Miraculous recovery, isn't it?"

Simon shifted uncomfortably. He hadn't anticipated Isabella's elaborate charade, complete with complicit medical staff.

"Sir, perhaps you should visit her anyway?"

Nathan's expression turned glacial. "If she's fine, then she doesn't require my presence."

As he turned to leave, Simon blocked his path. "Mr. Sterling, consider the consequences if you don't. Who knows what stunt she'll pull next?"

The woman had staged multiple suicide attempts already, even getting prison guards reprimanded.

Nathan's jaw tightened. Such theatrics behind bars? What was she truly scheming?

He'd only come today out of lingering obligation to the Delaney family.

Now it seemed Isabella was determined to absolve him of that debt entirely.

"Which room?" Nathan bit out.

Simon pointed down the corridor. "Last door on the right. There are two officers stationed outside."

Nathan strode toward the guarded room.

After verifying his identity and signing the visitor log, the police permitted entry.

The sharp scent of antiseptic intensified as Nathan pushed open the door. Isabella lay motionless on the hospital bed, her vacant stare fixed on the ceiling.

She jolted upright when Nathan's shadow fell across her. "Nathan! You actually came!" Her voice cracked with emotion.

The sudden movement dislodged her IV needle. Though blood welled at the puncture site, she didn't seem to notice.

"I thought I'd never see you again," she whispered, tears spilling down her cheeks. "But here you are..."

Nathan regarded her with detached indifference, his features carved from ice.

His lips curled in a humorless smile. "With performances like these, you deserve an Oscar nomination at minimum."

Isabella shook her head violently.

"That's not true!" she protested, her gaze darting toward the watching officers.
###Chapter 186 The Bargain

Isabella's voice trembled as she spoke. "This isn't an act. If I hadn't resorted to this, I would never have gotten to see you."

Nathan's lips curled into a cold smirk. "Now that you've seen me, what does it change? Still putting on your performance?"

His piercing gaze held undisguised disdain.

If not for Isabella's schemes, he and Evelyn might still have had a chance.

Tears streamed down Isabella's face as she reached for Nathan's arm. He recoiled violently, sending her stumbling back.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "What, am I forbidden from touching you now?" Her voice turned venomous. "Never forget, the Sterlings will always owe the Delaneys. That debt will haunt you forever."

Nathan's hands clenched into white-knuckled fists.

There it was again.

That unshakable truth he couldn't escape.

Isabella had wielded this weapon against him countless times, forcing his compliance.

"Say it often enough and it loses its meaning," Nathan warned, his voice dangerously low.

Isabella's eyes gleamed with desperation. "Then let this be the last time. Nathan, I propose a bargain."

She stepped closer, whispering words meant only for his ears. "I know you're tired of this debt. So let's settle it permanently."

"Get me out of this prison. A few more months here will destroy me. Grant me my freedom, and our families will be square."

The offer hung between them, tantalizing.

"Think carefully, Nathan. For someone with your resources, it's nothing. Just hire a competent attorney to get my sentence overturned."

His laugh was harsh. "So you can resume your scheming? How amusing."

Isabella shook her head violently. "No! I just want to start over. Once I'm out, I'll leave New York forever. You'll never see me again." Her voice cracked. "I'm just begging for a second chance."

At the mention of Evelyn, Nathan's expression darkened. So many misunderstandings between them traced back to this woman.

Perhaps without Isabella's interference...

"Impossible." The word fell like a guillotine's blade.

Yet Isabella laughed, undeterred. "Don't be hasty, Nathan. Consider carefully. That Delaney debt must weigh heavily on your conscience."

The same old manipulation. The same tired threat.

Nathan seized her chin with bruising force. "Listen well. Keep dreaming. If ten years seems too lenient, I'll gladly provide more evidence."

"You can rot here until you're nothing but bones."

He released her with a shove, wiping his hand on his coat as if touching something foul.

Isabella's face twisted in rage.

With a sudden lunge, she grabbed his sleeve. "After everything we shared, Nathan! How can you choose that nobody over me?"

Madness glittered in her eyes.

"Have you forgotten your promises? Or has that witch poisoned your mind completely?"

Her voice rose to a shriek. "Mark my words - when I get out, I'll tear her apart piece by piece!"
###Chapter 187 Her True Colors

The words kept pouring from Isabella's lips like venom. Her jaw clenched so tight I thought she might shatter her own teeth. That murderous glare she fixed on Evelyn could have burned through steel.

Nathan recoiled instantly at her threat. He wasn't shocked - he'd known the darkness lurking beneath Isabella's polished exterior. But this time, he wouldn't let it slide.

Without a backward glance, Nathan strode from the hospital room. Isabella's shrill screams followed him down the corridor, but he might as well have been deaf.

At the corridor's end stood Alistair, looking every bit his seventy years. The once-proud patriarch's temples had gone silver, deep grooves of exhaustion framing his eyes. He hadn't witnessed his granddaughter's unraveling.

Alistair actually smiled when Nathan approached, that familiar calculating gleam returning to his eyes. "An eye for an eye seems fair, don't you think?"

Nathan's hand slid into his pocket, his smirk dripping with disdain. "You're too old for this game, Alistair. Shouldn't you be enjoying retirement instead of meddling in affairs you can't win?"

The barb hit its mark. Alistair's face purpled with rage. "You arrogant little—"

But Nathan was already walking away, leaving the sputtering old man behind.

Alone in his car, Nathan stared blankly at the passing cityscape. Three years. Three damn years he'd pushed Evelyn away, all for Isabella's lies. The weight of his mistakes pressed down like physical pain.

God, he needed to see Evelyn. Now.

The engine roared to life.

Across town, Evelyn was floating on cloud nine. Landing the lead designer role for Sterling Enterprises' fashion show was huge. Even better? Professor Whitaker had agreed to use Kingsley Industries' factory for production.

Her fingers flew across her phone screen: "Harrison! Got the lead designer spot AND the manufacturing contract!"

Harrison's reply came before she could lock her screen: "Congratulations! Looks like you're one step closer to winning that bet with Hawthorne."

Evelyn's cheeks warmed. "Couldn't have done it without you."

"Don't mention it. That's what friends are for."

Friends. The word sent an unexpected flutter through her chest. Before she could overthink it, she typed: "Let me take you to dinner tonight. My treat."

"Deal."

Evelyn practically skipped to her car, completely missing the black sedan idling nearby. Its driver watched her with predatory intensity, hands white-knuckled on the wheel.
###Chapter 188 Can We Still Be Friends

The accelerator met the floor beneath Cassandra's stiletto.

A dark urge pulsed through her veins - to erase Evelyn Carter from existence.

If only that woman vanished, the Pamore fashion show's lead designer position would unquestionably be hers.

No one could steal what rightfully belonged to her then.

Her knuckles whitened around the steering wheel.

Just as she prepared to act, a sleek Bentley cut off Evelyn's vehicle, forcing Cassandra to slam her brakes.

Nathan Sterling had dispatched Simon to track Evelyn's location before racing across town himself.

Before the car fully stopped, he threw open the door.

Evelyn's lips thinned. Nathan clung to her like some persistent shadow.

"Evelyn!"

His voice cracked with emotion when he saw her.

He needed to atone. To make right every wrong he'd committed during their marriage.

"Mr. Sterling," she drawled, examining her manicure, "don't you have companies to run? Board meetings to attend?"

His jaw tightened. "Evelyn... what's past is past. I was thinking... perhaps we could be friends?"

A disbelieving laugh escaped her.

Was this some twisted joke?

Nathan Sterling wanted friendship?

"Have you been drinking? Or did you finally lose what little sense you had left?"

His gaze burned into her. "Hear me out! Isabella manipulated everything between us. She's facing consequences now. I've cut all ties with her. I want to start fresh with you—"

Evelyn's laughter cut him off.

"Mr. Sterling, you mistake me for someone who collects friends like your mother collects designer handbags. My standards are considerably higher."

The rejection stung, but he pressed on. "Isn't Isabella's removal enough? Can't we—"

"You still don't understand." Evelyn's smile turned glacial. "The problem was never just Isabella. It was you."

She leaned forward, each word a scalpel. "For three years, you were less a husband than a negligent stranger. You let Eleanor and Vanessa torment me. Allowed rumors to flourish. Never once defended me."

His breath hitched as she continued.

"You flaunted your affair publicly. Left me bleeding in an alley. Stole three years of my life and made me regret every second."

The words left her chest hollow.

Nathan had destroyed their marriage with his own hands.

Extinguished every spark of love through relentless neglect.

And now?

He thought a half-baked apology could undo it all?

How laughable.

Some wounds never healed.

The window slid up as Evelyn accelerated away, leaving Nathan standing in a cloud of exhaust.
###Chapter 189 No Courage to Love Again

Nathan stood frozen where Evelyn had left him, an icy sensation creeping through his veins.

Did this mean she wouldn't even consider giving him another chance?

Everything felt like it was spiraling out of control. No matter how hard he tried, she always slipped through his fingers.

An unfamiliar panic gripped his chest.

Just then, Cassandra drove past him in her sleek Mercedes.

Nathan's brow furrowed as he watched the car disappear in the same direction Evelyn had gone. His pulse quickened inexplicably.

Without thinking, he jumped into his own vehicle and followed.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was on the phone with Olivia while driving. "Liv! My design got approved! I'm leading this year's fashion show in Pamore!"

Olivia's squeal of delight filled the car. "That's amazing! We have to celebrate tonight!"

"I can't," Evelyn replied quickly. "I promised Harrison I'd meet him tonight."

"Oh?" Olivia's voice turned teasing. "Do tell your best friend everything."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Don't get any ideas. Harrison and I are practically siblings."

"Bullshit," Olivia scoffed. "That man is ten times better than your ex-husband. Open your eyes, Ev! If you let this one slip away, you'll die alone."

"Maybe I will," Evelyn joked weakly.

Olivia wasn't having it. "Seriously, Evelyn. Tell me the truth - do you still have feelings for Nathan?"

"No."

"Then what's the problem?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together, focusing on the road. The only thing she knew for certain was that she'd moved on from Nathan. She'd wasted enough time already.

Her heart simply couldn't take another risk.

"Hello? Earth to Evelyn!"

"Okay, okay!" Evelyn sighed. "Let's just let things happen naturally, alright? Right now, I just want to focus on improving the company's performance and nailing this fashion show. Everything else can wait."

The words had barely left her mouth when a black SUV suddenly swerved into her lane, heading straight for her car.

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

Her hands tightened on the wheel as she instinctively jerked it to the right.

At the last possible second, a familiar Bentley cut in front of her, taking the full impact of the collision instead.

The deafening crash echoed through the street.

Thick black smoke billowed from the crumpled hood of the Bentley. Evelyn's hands trembled violently.

"Evelyn? What's happening?" Olivia's frantic voice came through the speakers.

Evelyn couldn't respond.

She knew that car.

She knew exactly who was inside.

With shaking legs, she stumbled out of her vehicle and ran toward the wreckage.

Through the shattered window, she saw Nathan slumped over the steering wheel, blood dripping down his face.

Her stomach dropped.

"Nathan!" She pounded on the glass, her voice breaking. "Wake up! Please wake up!"

His eyelids fluttered weakly.

"Ev...Evelyn..."

Even half-conscious, he was calling her name.

His hand twitched toward her before going limp, his body collapsing against the seat.
###Chapter 190 Not an Accident

"Nathan!" Evelyn's voice cracked as she screamed his name.

No matter how desperately she called out, Nathan remained motionless on the pavement.

In the driver's seat of the speeding Mercedes, Cassandra Winslow froze in shock at the sudden turn of events.

She never expected someone would leap into danger to save Evelyn without hesitation.

But she couldn't stay here now.

Gritting her teeth, Cassandra jerked the steering wheel sharply, ignoring the crumpled front of her vehicle.

She sped away from the scene, tires screeching.

Evelyn forced herself to focus and dialed emergency services with trembling fingers. "911? There's been a car accident on Sterling Boulevard near—"

Her voice broke as she looked down at Nathan's unconscious form.

The paramedics arrived within minutes, rushing Nathan to the nearest trauma center.

In the sterile hospital corridor, Evelyn finally caught her breath and called Maxwell. "Max, there's been an accident."

Maxwell's voice turned urgent. "Are you hurt? Where are you? I'm coming now."

"No need—" Evelyn's gaze fixed on the operating room doors. The memory of the crash replayed in her mind.

That Mercedes had been aiming straight for her.

If Nathan hadn't appeared like lightning and taken the impact, she'd be the one on that operating table.

Evelyn's grip tightened around her phone. "It was a black Mercedes. Find out who owns it immediately. The driver fled—this wasn't an accident."

"Understood. I'm on it."

As she ended the call, Evelyn leaned against the cold hospital wall, her phone digging into her palm.

Within the hour, the Blackwell family stormed into the hospital. Eleanor Blackwell reached her first, fury radiating from every pore.

"You wretched girl!" Eleanor's shrill voice echoed down the corridor. "Did my son get hurt because of you?"

Even in his semi-conscious state, Nathan had been murmuring Evelyn's name.

His glazed eyes seemed to find her silhouette one last time before his hand went limp at his side, plunging him into unconsciousness.
###Chapter 191 His Unexpected Concern

"The patient sustained a laceration on his forehead from glass shards. We've sutured and dressed the wound. There's also a mild concussion, but otherwise no serious complications."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her tense shoulders relaxing.

Thank God Nathan was okay.

"Thank you, doctor. My son will be alright!" Eleanor clasped her hands together, relief washing over her like a tidal wave.

"The patient is conscious now. We'll be transferring him to a private room shortly."

"Wonderful. Absolutely wonderful."

As the medical team departed, nurses wheeled Nathan out on a gurney. Bandages swathed his forehead, dried blood streaking his pale complexion. The usually impeccable businessman looked startlingly vulnerable.

Eleanor rushed forward, her voice trembling. "Nathan, darling, how are you feeling?"

Vanessa, who had remained silent throughout the ordeal, finally spoke up. "You gave us such a fright! Thank heavens you're alright."

Nathan's gaze drifted past them.

His voice came out hoarse but firm. "I'm fine. Don't worry."

Eleanor dabbed at her eyes. "How can I not worry? This wasn't some minor incident! If anything had happened to you—"

Nathan's attention wasn't on his mother. His eyes locked onto Evelyn standing several feet away.

Their gazes connected across the sterile hospital corridor, an unspoken tension thickening the air between them.

To Nathan, Evelyn might as well have been on another continent despite standing mere yards away.

"Evelyn—" His voice cracked slightly.

Her response was barely above a whisper. "I'm glad you're okay."

Nathan opened his mouth to say more, but the nurse interrupted. "We need to get the patient settled."

As they wheeled him toward the private wing, Nathan craned his neck, his eyes never leaving Evelyn's retreating figure.

Inside the hospital suite, Nathan realized Evelyn hadn't followed. He jerked upright, ignoring the sudden dizziness.

The nurse immediately blocked him. "Mr. Sterling, you need to remain in bed!"

"I'm fine—"

Eleanor entered just as Nathan swung his legs over the bed's edge. "Nathan Blackwell Sterling! Lie down this instant!"

His jaw set stubbornly. "Where's Evelyn? Why isn't she here?"

Eleanor's face darkened. Why this sudden obsession with Evelyn? This wasn't like him at all.

"Why are you worrying about her at a time like this?"

Vanessa's lips pressed into a thin line. Her relationship with Nathan had grown increasingly strained since Evelyn entered their lives.

Yet clearly, Evelyn still occupied his thoughts.

"Where is she?"

As if summoned, Evelyn appeared in the doorway, leaning casually against the frame. Her expression remained unreadable.

"I'm right here."

The moment Nathan saw her, visible tension drained from his body.

His first question surprised everyone. "Are you hurt? Did they check you over?"

Evelyn blinked. Nathan showing concern for her wellbeing? That was about as likely as snow in July.

Still, his actions today had shocked her. She never imagined he'd risk himself for her sake.

Now she owed him—a debt she wasn't sure how to repay.

"I'm perfectly fine, Mr. Sterling. Though your Aston Martin didn't fare as well." She reached into her bag, producing a check. "Twenty million should cover a replacement."

Her tone was all business, carefully devoid of emotion.

Nathan's eyes widened fractionally, the muscle in his jaw twitching.
###Chapter 192 Drawing the Line

Nathan had hoped this incident might ease the tension between them.

Instead, Evelyn reached into her pocket and produced a check.

His expression darkened instantly. "What's this supposed to mean?"

She arched one perfect eyebrow. "A new Bentley costs five million. The rest is my gratitude, Mr. Sterling."

Nathan's jaw tightened.

Twenty million dollars?

Was she seriously trying to pay him off?

He'd acted on pure instinct to protect her. Nothing more.

Why did she have to twist it into something transactional?

Her silence stretched as she watched his stormy expression.

"If twenty isn't enough," Evelyn continued coolly, "name your price."

"Nathan! What kind of man do you take me for?" His voice vibrated with barely contained fury.

He was still her patient, for God's sake.

Did their connection mean nothing to her?

Eleanor and Vanessa gaped from the sidelines. Was twenty million mere pocket change to Evelyn?

Envy flickered in their eyes. The Carter fortune truly knew no bounds.

Since Nathan had frozen their accounts, scraping together two million had become impossible. Their fingers itched to snatch that check.

"Evelyn, darling, what are you doing?" Eleanor purred, slinking forward.

Her covetous gaze locked onto the check like a predator spotting prey.

With deliberate slowness, Evelyn extended it toward her. "Take it, Mrs. Blackwell."

Eleanor's greedy fingers twitched, but Nathan's command froze her mid-reach. "Mother. Step. Back."

The older woman's face fell. Twenty million slipping through her fingers! What madness was this?

Nathan's anger burned white-hot. Who did Evelyn think he was?

Reading Eleanor's thoughts perfectly, Evelyn tucked the check into the woman's pocket. "Since you're Nathan's mother, consider this a gift."

Without another word, she turned on her heel.

Twenty million would settle her debt. They'd be square.

Fate had other plans. Gregory materialized in the doorway, having rushed over upon hearing the news.

"Well, well, Ms. Carter. Fancy meeting you here."

His usual lazy drawl held an edge of mockery.

Who would've thought Nathan Sterling would risk his life for a woman? How positively romantic.

"Is Nathan alright?" Gregory prodded.

Evelyn had zero interest in this conversation. "See for yourself."

Gregory's lips curled. "Judging by your stormy exit, I'll assume he's fine. Though I must say, his heroic rescue was rather touching. He—"

She cut him off with an eye roll.

"Should I swoon over one decent act and forget years of torment?"

Gregory scratched his nose awkwardly. "That's not what I—"

"I mean," he backpedaled, "surely you see his sincerity now? Why not give the man another chance?"

They were equals now. A perfect match.

If Evelyn would just bend,

They'd be Manhattan's ultimate power couple.

Her expression turned arctic. "Are you out of your mind?"

Did he think her some kind of glutton for punishment?
###Chapter 193 Stay in Your Lane

Nathan Sterling's heroic act today couldn't undo the years of pain he'd inflicted on Evelyn Carter.

"If you've got so much free time, pick up a damn book instead of spreading rumors. Stay in your lane!"

Evelyn's voice cut through the air like shattered glass, her hostility unmistakable.

Her position was crystal clear.

Gregory Hammond chuckled awkwardly. "Right, I'll just... go check on Nate then."

He practically sprinted away from the verbal assault.

As Evelyn exited the hospital, her phone buzzed with a call from Maxwell Donovan. "I've traced the vehicle. The Volkswagen belongs to Cassandra Winslow, and she was definitely behind the wheel today."

Evelyn let out a derisive snort. "I was clearly her target."

"Correct, Ms. Carter. Though it doesn't appear premedited. More like a crime of opportunity."

Evelyn pressed her lips into a thin line. "What's her background?"

"Already looked into that. Orphanage kid. Earned her way into Pamore University through sheer academic merit."

"During her studies, she survived on scholarships and donor funding. Worked multiple jobs while maintaining top grades. Quite the rags-to-riches story."

It sounded almost inspirational.

"Current location?"

"We've got her in custody. Your orders?"

Though Maxwell phrased it as a question, the Kingsley family's usual methods left little doubt about Cassandra's fate if left to their devices.

Disappearance. Or worse.

Everything hinged on Evelyn's next words.

"Compile the evidence and hand it over to the authorities. Let the justice system handle it."

Maxwell sounded shocked. "Ms. Carter, you're letting her off that easily?"

Evelyn frowned. "Since when is due process considered lenient?"

If punishment was warranted, this was how civilized people handled it.

Mercy had its limits - she wasn't about to turn the other cheek for attempted murder.

But... Cassandra's design portfolio showed remarkable talent. That level of skill spoke of extraordinary dedication.

To climb from orphanage to university to professional success? Evelyn understood the magnitude of that struggle. One reckless moment shouldn't erase a lifetime of effort.

She'd throw Cassandra a lifeline.

"Ms. Carter, she tried to kill you."

"Then let prison reform her. Maybe after serving time, she'll appreciate her second chance."

Reluctantly, Maxwell acquiesced. "As you wish, Ms. Carter."

The conversation ended abruptly as tires screeched nearby. A cherry-red Ferrari pulled up with theatrical precision.

Before Evelyn could react, Olivia Sinclair exploded from the driver's seat, visibly sagging with relief at the sight of her unharmed friend.

"Jesus Christ, Ev! You nearly gave me a heart attack! Are you hurt? Let me see!"

The worry in Olivia's voice was palpable.

Evelyn ended the call. "I'm fine."

"Thank god! But what the hell happened? Since when do you play bumper cars in midday traffic?"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "What else? Fashion show drama. Cassandra couldn't handle losing the lead designer position."

Olivia's face darkened with rage.

"That psychotic bitch tried to run you over in broad daylight? But wait - if she wanted you dead, how are you standing here without a scratch?"

Evelyn explained Nathan's last-minute intervention.

Olivia's eyebrows shot up, her expression twisting with disbelief. "Hold up - Nathan Sterling saved you?"
###Chapter 194 Never Again

Evelyn let out a quiet sigh in response.

"Damn, did he suddenly grow a conscience? Even if he did, you're not going to just forgive him, right?" Olivia's voice was sharp with disbelief.

Evelyn shook her head slowly. "I've already settled the score between us."

That caught Olivia's attention immediately.

"How? Don't tell me you slept with him again. Listen, if you even think about forgiving that bastard, I swear I'll—"

Evelyn grabbed her friend's arm. "Hey."

She met Olivia's gaze steadily. "I told you, I'm done with him. I won't repeat that mistake."

Olivia studied her face before nodding. "Good. Now let's go have some real fun."

But Evelyn hesitated. "I can't. I have plans with Harrison tonight."

Olivia rolled her eyes dramatically. "Ugh, always with Harrison. Just invite him along then."

"I should ask first—"

"Ask nothing!" Olivia interrupted. "Send him the location. If he doesn't show up, I'll personally teach him a lesson."

Evelyn could only shake her head at her friend's antics.

That evening, Olivia dragged Evelyn to an upscale lounge where they joined a group of friends on the dance floor.

"Tonight, you forget everything and just enjoy yourself," Olivia shouted over the music.

The bass pulsed through them as they danced freely under the strobe lights.

After several songs, Evelyn retreated to their VIP booth and ordered a virgin mojito.

Across the room, Vanessa Sterling sat at the bar, nursing her whiskey. It had been weeks since she'd dared show her face in public after the plagiarism scandal.

With Nathan hospitalized and unable to monitor her every move, she'd finally ventured out under cover of night.

Her fingers tightened around the glass when she spotted Evelyn laughing with friends. How dare she enjoy herself while Nathan lay in a hospital bed?

But Vanessa remembered her brother's warning and forced herself to look away.

"Ms. Sterling? Is that you?"

Vanessa frowned at the unfamiliar woman approaching her. "Do I know you?"

Victoria Sinclair's smile faltered. "We met at Isabella's birthday gala last year."

Recognition dawned. "Ah, Isabella's cousin."

Victoria slid onto the stool beside her. "I was just visiting Isabella yesterday. Have you been to see her?"

Vanessa's grip on her glass tightened. "I've been... preoccupied. How is she holding up?"

Victoria's expression darkened. "Prison isn't exactly a spa retreat. All thanks to that woman over there." She nodded toward Evelyn's table.

Vanessa followed her gaze. Yes, Evelyn Carter had destroyed many lives. And Vanessa wouldn't forget it.
###Chapter 195 A Reckoning in the Making

"She's untouchable. Ordinary methods won't work on her." Vanessa Sterling clenched her fists, resisting the urge to confront Evelyn Carter directly. If Nathan Sterling discovered her involvement, she'd be exiled from Sterling Enterprises permanently.

But Victoria Sinclair had vengeance burning in her eyes.

"That woman ruined my career," Victoria hissed, swirling her martini. "Because of her, I'm unemployed, drowning my sorrows in dive bars. Doesn't that make your blood boil?"

Vanessa nodded absently, keeping her expression neutral. She wouldn't be dragged into Victoria's personal vendetta.

"If you despise her so much," Vanessa countered, "why don't you handle it yourself?"

A slow, venomous smile spread across Victoria's face. "You hate her too, don't you?"

Vanessa's grip tightened around her glass. "Even if I did, there's nothing I can do. Some battles aren't worth fighting."

Victoria scoffed. "What happened to the fearless Vanessa Sterling? Did that secretary break your spirit?"

The barb struck deep. Countless humiliations flashed through Vanessa's mind—every time Evelyn had outmaneuvered her. The resentment simmered beneath her polished exterior.

Why did Evelyn always emerge unscathed? The temptation to retaliate was intoxicating.

But Vanessa wasn't reckless. She recognized Evelyn's newfound influence. Any misstep could backfire spectacularly.

"Mock me all you want," Vanessa retorted. "If you're so confident, prove it."

Victoria's eyes gleamed with predatory intent. "Alone, we might fail. But together?" She leaned closer. "Imagine seeing Evelyn Carter brought to her knees. Begging."

The image sent a thrill down Vanessa's spine.

"What's your plan?"

Victoria smirked and produced a small sachet from her clutch. "A little... persuasion powder."

Vanessa recoiled. "Are you insane? That's—"

"—perfect," Victoria finished. "One sip, and she'll be utterly compliant."

The bar's neon lights reflected in Vanessa's wide eyes. This crossed every line. Evelyn wasn't just some employee anymore—she had Nathan's protection. The Sterlings couldn't afford another scandal.

"Count me out." Vanessa stood abruptly. "I won't risk everything for your petty revenge."

Victoria's smile turned icy. "Petty? She destroyed Isabella Delaney. Your own cousin rots in prison because of her."

The reminder stung. Vanessa had avoided visiting Isabella, too ashamed to face her failure.

Victoria pressed her advantage. "Picture it—Evelyn's reputation in tatters. Nathan would finally see her for the schemer she is."

Vanessa hesitated, the fantasy seductive.

Then reality crashed back. "If this backfires—"

"It won't." Victoria signaled a waiter. "Trust me, by dawn, Evelyn Carter will wish she'd never crossed us."

The waiter approached. Victoria whispered instructions, her gaze locked on Evelyn across the room.

Vanessa's pulse raced. This was madness.

Yet as she watched Evelyn laugh with friends, oblivious to the storm approaching, a dark thought took root:

Maybe some lessons needed to be taught the hard way.
###Chapter 196 A Summons Not to Be Ignored

Victoria Sinclair's lips curled into a vicious smile as she finished giving instructions to the waiter.

Her manicured nails dug into Vanessa Sterling's shoulder as she whispered, "Make sure you get every second on camera. I want that disgraceful exit to go viral."

Vanessa shuddered at the venom in Victoria's voice. This wasn't the polished businesswoman she knew.

"I...I can't do this."

Victoria's grip tightened. "Too late for second thoughts, darling. We're partners in this now, aren't we?"

The unspoken threat hung between them.

Vanessa's gaze drifted toward Evelyn Carter across the room. After a moment's hesitation, she squared her shoulders.

Upstairs in the VIP lounge, a familiar voice cut through the dim lighting. "Harrison Whitmore gracing my humble establishment? To what do I owe the pleasure?"

Harrison's lips quirked as he bumped fists with Sebastian Montgomery. "Been a while."

"Too long. You've been in Pamore for months without so much as a drink invitation." Sebastian stepped into the light, his smirk fading as he studied his old friend. "What brings you here tonight?"

The two had been inseparable during their university days - Sebastian the charismatic junior to Harrison's intense senior.

Lately, rumors had been swirling through their circle about Harrison abandoning his empire in Frenda for a woman.

Sebastian burned with curiosity about the woman who'd melted the infamous Ice Prince of Frenda.

"Following an invitation," Harrison murmured, teeth grazing his lower lip in a gesture Sebastian recognized from their college days - his tell when something interested him.

"I heard you walked away from Frenda to run some startup," Sebastian pressed. "Let me guess - was the invitation from my future sister-in-law?"

Harrison's rare smile answered before his words did.

Sebastian crowed with delight. "I knew it! The legendary Evelyn Carter is here tonight!"

The mention of "sister-in-law" made Harrison's jaw tighten. They hadn't crossed that line yet. Not officially.

He clapped Sebastian on the shoulder. "Bit premature with the titles, Montgomery. But give it time." The certainty in his voice surprised even himself.

Sebastian's eyebrows shot up. "Wait - you haven't closed the deal yet?"

Harrison cleared his throat, shifting uncomfortably. "These things take time."

The raw emotion in that simple statement stunned Sebastian. "Damn, Whitmore. You've got it bad."

Harrison's gaze found Evelyn in the crowd below. "I've waited years. What's a little longer?"

He'd wait until Evelyn was ready to let go of her past. Until she could trust him with her heart.

True happiness was worth the bitter wait.

Sebastian followed his gaze, then stiffened. The playful glint in his eyes vanished.
###Chapter 197 Timely Intervention

Harrison moved first. His reflexes were lightning fast as he spun on his heel and dashed toward the staircase.

Evelyn sat at the bar counter, idly swiping through her phone when a server approached with a silver tray.

"Compliments of the house, ma'am. Our signature cocktail for VIP guests tonight." The waiter didn't wait for her response before setting the drink down.

She lifted the crystal glass, but before it touched her lips, Harrison's urgent voice cut through the noise. "Evie!"

His footsteps were rapid against the marble floor. In three long strides, he reached her and snatched the glass from her fingers.

Evelyn blinked up at him in confusion as their gazes locked.

Harrison pulled her into what appeared to be an intimate embrace. His lips brushed her ear as he whispered, "It's drugged."

Understanding flashed in her eyes instantly.

"Harrison! Where did you disappear to?" She forced a playful pout. "I've been waiting forever."

He chuckled warmly. "Just catching up with an old friend. Sebastian owns this place - want to meet him?"

With a conspiratorial smile, Evelyn let Harrison guide her away from the bar, the suspicious drink still in his grasp.

Upstairs in a private lounge, the trembling waiter knelt before Sebastian Montgomery. "Sir, I swear I didn't know—"

Sebastian's face darkened like a gathering storm. Someone dared to poison guests in his establishment? This was beyond audacious.

"Who paid you?" His voice was deadly calm. "And how much was my reputation worth?"

The waiter immediately produced a wad of cash from his pocket. "The woman told me to find a male escort and deliver the target to Suite 888 at the Grand Marquis after she passed out."

Glass shattered as Sebastian smashed his tumbler against the table. "You absolute fool! Do you comprehend what you've done?"

"Please, Mr. Montgomery! I'll never—"

Sebastian cut him off with a sharp gesture. "Security footage. Now." When the screens lit up, he demanded, "Point her out."

The waiter's finger landed unerringly on Victoria Sinclair's face just as Evelyn entered.

Sebastian's eyebrows shot up when he recognized Nathan Sterling's ex-wife. "Ms. Carter, my deepest apologies. Rest assured, this matter will be handled with extreme prejudice."

At his signal, two broad-shouldered security personnel dragged the weeping waiter away. Given Sebastian's reputation, the man wouldn't be seeing daylight anytime soon.

Evelyn's attention remained fixed on the frozen image of Victoria. "I know her," she said quietly, her voice laced with icy recognition.

###Chapter 198 A Taste of Their Own Medicine

Evelyn's sharp eyes landed on Vanessa standing beside Victoria in the surveillance footage. A cold smirk played on her lips. "So they've teamed up now?"

Nathan noticed Vanessa too, his jaw tightening. "I'll deal with this interference once and for all."

But Evelyn cut in, her voice dripping with determination. "Since they went through all this trouble for me, let me return the favor."

Nathan nodded. "As you wish."

Sebastian Montgomery, the bar owner, immediately caught on. "Ms. Carter, what's your plan? Whatever you decide, you have my full support."

Darkness swirled in Evelyn's emerald eyes as she picked up the drugged glass. "Simple. An eye for an eye."

She traced the rim of the glass with her finger. "Since this contains such... special ingredients, Victoria should experience its effects firsthand."

Sebastian grinned. "Consider it done."

Meanwhile in the VIP lounge, Victoria grew impatient when Evelyn didn't appear. "That bitch must be unconscious by now," she gloated, ordering another whiskey.

"Let's give it thirty minutes before checking the hotel room. The show should be starting soon." Victoria pushed a glass toward Vanessa.

Vanessa shifted uncomfortably. "Isn't this going too far?"

Victoria downed her drink in one gulp. "Too far? After everything she's done? This is justice."

She leaned closer, her eyes gleaming. "I've arranged for influencers to livestream from that hotel room. By dawn, her reputation will be ashes."

Vanessa's hands trembled slightly. Though Victoria's methods shocked her, a dark thrill ran through her veins. After enduring Evelyn's superiority for so long, revenge tasted sweet.

"To success," Vanessa murmured, raising her glass. The last of her hesitation vanished as she imagined Evelyn's downfall.

Victoria laughed cruelly. "That arrogant ice queen will learn her place tonight!"

Unbeknownst to them, Evelyn had heard every poisonous word. Her lips curled into a dangerous smile. If they wanted war, she'd give them annihilation.

Soon, Victoria began fanning herself. "Why's it so hot in here?" She gulped down water desperately. "I need the restroom."

Vanessa watched her stumble away, but Victoria never returned. Then Vanessa noticed her own skin growing flushed, her breathing turning shallow.

The trap had sprung perfectly.
###Chapter 199 The Taste of Their Own Medicine

"Miss Carter, you don't look well." A bartender approached Evelyn with concern, his brow furrowed.

Evelyn pressed trembling fingers to her temples, shaking her head. But when her gaze met the bartender's, the fire in her veins roared hotter.

Her breath came in shallow gasps as she leaned closer without thinking. "It's...unbearably warm in here."

Understanding flashed in the bartender's eyes. "The Montgomery Hotel is just next door. Shall I escort you to a room?"

Nodding weakly, Evelyn followed him in a haze, her cheeks burning crimson. Each step felt like walking through molasses.

Upstairs in the VIP lounge, Sebastian's man approached with a smirk. "It's done, Mr. Montgomery."

Sebastian turned to Nathan with an amused shrug. "Anything else I can assist you with, Ms. Kingsley?"

Evelyn swirled her cocktail absently, the ice cubes clinking like tiny bells.

A slow, dangerous smile curved her lips. "Thank you, Sebastian. Now let's watch how their wicked plan unfolds."

Nathan suppressed a shiver at her tone.

The old adage was true—hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

"Your mixologists are exceptional," Evelyn remarked casually, taking another sip.

Sebastian's grin widened. "You're welcome anytime. Harrison here will cover your tabs." He winked at Harrison Whitmore. "I'll reserve our finest vintages just for you."

"Always the shrewd businessman," Evelyn teased.

Sebastian leaned forward conspiratorially. "For your wedding to Harrison? I'd comp the entire event."

Evelyn choked on her drink.

Harrison shot Sebastian a lethal glare that would've felled a lesser man.

But Sebastian merely chuckled. Truth was truth, after all.

"Speaking of which—"

Evelyn waved a hand frantically. Before she could protest, Harrison captured her wrist. "Let me take you home, Evelyn."

Startled, she set down her glass with a clink. They exited so quickly it resembled a strategic retreat.

Sebastian's laughter followed them out.

The Kingsley heiress was nothing like society's rumors. She was...adorably flustered in person.

In the car's dim interior, Evelyn stared at the passing streetlights, her mind clearing with each breath.

"Sebastian's jokes shouldn't be taken seriously." Harrison kept his eyes on the road, his tone deliberately light.

An inexplicable pang of disappointment twisted in Evelyn's chest, but she masked it perfectly.

"No need to explain next time," Harrison interrupted her thoughts.

Evelyn blinked. "Pardon?"

"Explanations only complicate things."

Then came the question that mattered: "Any regrets about tonight?"

Evelyn's answer was immediate. "None."

Vanessa and Victoria had reaped exactly what they'd sown.

"If I regretted it, I'd be a saint," Evelyn continued, her voice hardening. "They aimed to destroy me, but in the end?" A cold smile. "They merely tasted their own medicine."
###Chapter 200 On the Brink of Madness

"Showing mercy to your enemies is the cruelest thing you can do to yourself." Dominic's words echoed in Evelyn's mind.

"Leave the rest to me. Just focus on your fashion show preparations," Harrison reassured her.

"Alright."

The moment Evelyn stepped through her penthouse doors, a scandalous hashtag exploded across social media: #SterlingHeiressThreesomeScandal

Earlier that evening...

Paparazzi from every major tabloid in Manhattan had converged outside the presidential suite of The Ritz-Carlton. Camera flashes illuminated the hallway as reporters jostled for position.

"Inside sources say a Grammy-winning artist is having a wild party with two male escorts," whispered one journalist, adjusting his lens.

"Wait, my tip said it's an Oscar-nominated actress cheating on her husband," countered another.

Confusion rippled through the crowd as conflicting rumors swirled. The only certainty? Whatever happened behind that door would be front-page news.

A reality TV star suddenly went live on Instagram. "Y'all won't believe what's happening in this suite! Smash that follow button and stay tuned!"

"Enough waiting!" someone shouted. "Let's just bust in!"

The mob cheered in agreement. A terrified bellhop was pushed forward to unlock the door.

When the door swung open, cameras captured every inch of the disheveled suite. Three figures lay tangled in the king-sized bed, sheets barely covering their naked forms.

"Holy shit! Is that what I think it is?"

"Damn! A freaking threesome!"

"Get their faces! This is gold if it's who I think!"

One bold reporter yanked the covers away, revealing Victoria Sinclair's dazed expression. Shutters clicked like machine gun fire.

Victoria blinked against the blinding lights, her body aching in ways she couldn't comprehend. The room spun as she struggled to process the nightmare unfolding around her.

Then she saw them.

The cameras.

The microphones.

The leering faces.

A blood-curdling scream tore from her throat. "GET OUT! ALL OF YOU GET OUT RIGHT NOW!"

The commotion roused Vanessa Sterling beside her. When the heiress realized her naked body was being broadcast live to millions, her world shattered.

"STOP FILMING! I'LL SUE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU!"

At first, the reporters seemed disappointed - Victoria wasn't a big enough name for their headlines. But when Vanessa screamed...

"That's Vanessa Sterling! The Sterling Enterprises heiress!"

The media frenzy reached fever pitch. This wasn't just gossip - this was a billion-dollar scandal.

"Vanessa! Who's the man in bed with you?"

"Victoria, how long have you been sleeping together?"

Flashbulbs popped like fireworks as both women scrambled for cover, their reputations evaporating in real time. The livestream viewer count skyrocketed into the millions.

Vanessa collapsed into hysterical sobs while Victoria clutched her pounding head. In twenty-four hours, this footage would circle the globe. In forty-eight, their families would disown them. By week's end? They'd become the internet's favorite punchline.

And someone had orchestrated every second of their downfall.
###Chapter 201 The Scandalous Socialite

Vanessa's frantic movements caused the silk robe draped over her to slip away completely. Her bare skin was now exposed to the flashing cameras.

"My God, what a sight! So this is how the Sterling heiress behaves in private?"

"Don't just gawk - keep snapping those photos! These shots will make us rich!"

"The Sterling family is finished."

The cruel whispers made Vanessa's head spin.

What the hell had just happened?

Overwhelmed by the chaos, her vision blurred before darkness swallowed her consciousness.

Meanwhile...

Victoria Sinclair desperately searched for an escape route, but her discarded clothes were nowhere to be found. Trapped in her naked state, fleeing wasn't an option.

They could only watch helplessly as the paparazzi continued capturing every humiliating angle.

Victoria knew her reputation was destroyed.

But the nightmare was only beginning.

Thanks to a popular influencer's live stream, the entire scandalous scene had been broadcast to millions of online viewers.

Within minutes, the footage went viral across social media platforms, sparking a wildfire of commentary.

"Wait - is that really the Sterling heiress? Damn, she's stacked!"

"Holy shit, a threesome! Whoever filmed this deserves an award!"

"I wonder how much it costs to spend a night with a Sterling heiress. Bet she's worth every penny."

"Actually, I think the question is how much she pays her male escorts. That guy in the middle looks like a professional."

"So the Sterling princess hires gigolos? Classy."

The online commentary ranged from crude to downright vicious.

Nathan Sterling, recovering in his hospital bed, received an urgent call from Simon. As he listened, his face darkened with each passing second.
###Chapter 202 First Leap of Faith

"Darling, have you checked the headlines?" Natalie's voice crackled through the phone.

Evelyn's fingers scrolled through the viral images of Vanessa and Victoria plastered across every social media platform. "I have. You're absolutely brilliant," she breathed.

The paparazzi had outdone themselves this time. Each photograph captured scandalous angles that would haunt the Sterling sisters for years to come.

Natalie's laughter carried a wicked edge. "I've personally ensured these stories stay trending for seventy-two hours minimum. Since they crave the spotlight, let's give them the full Broadway treatment."

Evelyn shivered at her friend's ruthlessness. Having Natalie as an ally felt like possessing a nuclear weapon in a pillow fight.

"Thank you, love. When does your flight land in Sterling Heights?" Evelyn asked, tracing the plummeting stock graphs on her tablet.

"Still wrapping up negotiations in Darai. Expect me by month's end. We'll have cocktails with Olivia when I return."

"Perfect. I'll have champagne chilling for your homecoming."

Their call ended just as Sterling Enterprises' stocks took another nosedive. Vanessa's disgrace had already wiped billions from the family fortune.

In the penthouse office, Simon delivered his grim report through gritted teeth. "Mr. Sterling, we've pressured every major outlet to take down the articles. But the damage..."

His voice faltered under Nathan's glacial stare. The bandages wrapping Nathan's forehead did nothing to soften his razor-sharp intensity.

"...The stories keep resurfacing. Someone's bankrolling their persistence. And the press corps has surrounded our lobby demanding statements."

Nathan's knuckles whitened around his Montblanc pen. After decades in corporate warfare, he recognized a coordinated attack when he saw one.

"Who's pulling the strings?" The question sliced through the tension like a scalpel.
###Chapter 203 Take Me Home

Simon hesitated, his gaze flickering nervously toward Nathan.

"Out with it. I demand the truth." Nathan's voice cut through the tense silence like a blade.

Taking a shaky breath, Simon finally confessed, "All evidence points to Ms. Carter."

"What? Evelyn?" Nathan's eyebrows shot up in disbelief.

Simon gave a cautious nod, barely daring to breathe. One wrong move could unleash Nathan's legendary temper.

Just as Nathan was about to explode, a sudden realization stopped him cold.

"That makes no sense. Why would Evelyn target Sterling Enterprises?"

If revenge had been her goal, she would have struck long ago - especially when Dominic had threatened the company.

Why wait until now? Unless...

The answer hit him like a lightning bolt. Vanessa.

What had his sister done to provoke Evelyn?

For the first time in their tumultuous relationship, Nathan chose to trust Evelyn. Clenching his fists, he forced his voice to remain steady. "Where's Vanessa?"

"Madam Sterling brought her back to Sterling Manor. She should be there now."

"Take me home." Nathan strode toward the exit without another word.

The grand living room of Sterling Manor was bathed in golden light, yet the atmosphere was anything but warm. Vanessa clung to Eleanor, her dramatic sobs echoing through the marble halls.

Margaret sat rigidly in her high-backed chair, her expression colder than the winter wind. The disgraceful scene unfolding before her was unworthy of the Sterling name.

Vanessa had dragged their family name through the mud. How would they ever show their faces in society again after this scandal?
###Chapter 204 You Reap What You Sow

"I understand, Grandmother. I'll get to the bottom of this."

Evelyn gave a slight nod, granting Nathan permission to proceed.

With her approval secured, Nathan turned his attention to Vanessa.

Even as she wept uncontrollably before him, not an ounce of sympathy stirred in his heart.

"Explain yourself."

Vanessa's sobs halted abruptly, but words failed her.

The truth was impossible to voice. Nathan had explicitly warned her against provoking Evelyn. Yet she'd let jealousy override reason, and now faced the consequences.

How could she meet his gaze? Or face their family after this?

Worse still - would there even be a place for her in the Sterling family if the full truth came out?

"Mother!" Vanessa turned desperately to Eleanor.

But Eleanor, acutely aware of Nathan's dangerous mood, remained silent.

Nathan's patience snapped. "The truth, Vanessa. Now."

Her entire body trembled. "Don't be angry, Nate. I'm the victim here! As my brother, shouldn't you help me?"

"Enough!" Nathan's voice cracked like a whip, veins standing out on his clenched fists.

His glacial stare pinned her. "Did you provoke Evelyn first? Have you forgotten my warning?"

This version of Nathan terrified Vanessa. She shriveled under his intensity.

"It wasn't me! The drugs were Victoria's idea. She set Evelyn up. I barely got involved, but look what happened to me!"

As the excuses spilled out, genuine self-pity overwhelmed her. Minor involvement, maximum suffering.

"Answer clearly - were you part of this scheme or not?"

Vanessa wanted to deny it, but Nathan's presence crushed resistance. Finally, she nodded.

A derisive snort escaped Nathan.

"You heard her. She instigated this. I'd wager she helped plan Evelyn's downfall too."

Each deliberate word struck Nathan's own heart like a hammer.

For the first time in three years of marriage, he'd chosen Evelyn's word over others'.

And she'd proven worthy of that trust.

"Consequences follow actions," Nathan stated coldly.

He turned to Eleanor. "Still planning to confront Evelyn?"

Eleanor's legs gave out, collapsing onto the sofa.

Nathan addressed Margaret next. "Grandmother, leave this matter to me."

Margaret sighed deeply. "What a disgrace to our family name."

With that, she rose and exited without another glance.

Mercy wasn't on Nathan's agenda today. "Winston, pack Vanessa's belongings. Simon, book the next flight to Astana and escort her to the airport."

"Immediately, Mr. Sterling," Simon responded.

Vanessa gaped in horror. "Nate, no! I won't go to Astana!"

Eleanor clutched at his arm. "Nathan, I beg you! She's my only daughter. Sending her away will destroy me!"

Their pleas fell on deaf ears. Nathan's decision was final.
###Chapter 205 A Mesmerizing Vintage Gown

Vanessa's scandal kept trending across social media platforms.

To control the fallout, Nathan moved up Sterling Enterprises' quarterly product launch. The event showcased groundbreaking nanotechnology research results.

His strategic maneuver effectively shifted public focus from Vanessa's controversy to Sterling's innovative new line.

Within seven days, Sterling's stock prices began rebounding.

"Nathan certainly knows how to handle a crisis," Olivia remarked casually.

Natalie added, "Standard corporate damage control. By the way, I heard Vanessa's been shipped off to Europe. Should keep her out of trouble for a while."

"She's absolutely vile. After everything she's done, Nathan's being remarkably lenient."

"Blood ties, you know. He can't completely disown his own sister."

As they spoke, both women glanced toward Evelyn.

Natalie said, "Darling, Vanessa's finished. As for Victoria, I've made sure she'll never work in Sterling City again."

Evelyn took a slow sip of her latte. "Actions have consequences. Karma's a beautiful thing."

Olivia snorted with laughter. "Perfectly put."

"Speaking of which, how's the fashion show coming along?" Natalie inquired.

"Designs are finalized. Production starts next week. We'll be ready by month's end."

This marked Evelyn's first major fashion production, with Maxwell handling numerous logistical details. Everything was progressing seamlessly.

"You're killing it, babe! Come here!" Olivia pulled Evelyn into an enthusiastic hug.

Suddenly, she froze mid-embrace. "Well, well. Look who decided to grace us with his presence."

The others turned toward the newcomer.

Harrison checked his appearance, confused by their reaction. "Ladies, what exactly are you three beauties staring at?"

Natalie's gaze flickered between Evelyn and Harrison. The chemistry between them was undeniable.

"To what do we owe this pleasure, Mr. Whitmore?" Natalie teased.

Olivia joined in, "Isn't it obvious? He's clearly here for someone special."

Evelyn wished the floor would swallow her whole.

Harrison simply smiled and produced a leather-bound portfolio. "Business before pleasure, ladies."

The trio composed themselves as Harrison opened the file.

"What's this?" Evelyn asked.

Harrison explained, "Evie, your upcoming show has a retro theme, correct? I happened to acquire something extraordinary that would be perfect."

He revealed photographs of an exquisite vintage gown with intricate floral embroidery.

The collective gasp was audible.

"This is breathtaking."

"Absolutely museum-worthy."

Harrison looked pleased. "This masterpiece dates back to the 1990s. Every stitch is hand-sewn, a true collector's item."

"Where is it now? Could we feature it as the show's centerpiece? It would be sensational."
###Chapter 206 Bianca Delacroix's Unexpected Arrival

Evelyn's breath caught as she admired the exquisite garment before her.

Harrison had specifically brought her here for this moment.

"This vintage bodycon gown is currently part of the National Museum's collection," he explained smoothly. "But it's being auctioned tonight at the charity gala."

Olivia nearly squealed with excitement. "We have to get it! Price is no object."

Natalie nodded in agreement. "If this dress can make such an impact on your fashion show, it's worth any bid."

Evelyn couldn't tear her gaze away from the delicate embroidery.

After a long pause, she turned to Harrison with determination. "Let's go."

"Of course," he replied with an amused smile.

"We're coming too!" Olivia and Natalie declared simultaneously.

At precisely seven that evening, their group arrived at the prestigious Sterling Grand Ballroom. The venue buzzed with New York's elite society.

Olivia and Natalie made a striking pair in their coordinated designer outfits. Heads turned as they entered, whispers following them through the crowd.

"Isn't that Ms. Sinclair from Vogue's top boutique?"

"And that's Natalie Reeves - chief editor of GEM Magazine!"

"Their friendship is legendary. Absolutely stunning together."

"We should introduce ourselves."

Their reputations preceded them, and soon they were surrounded by eager socialites exchanging business cards with practiced ease.

When Evelyn entered on Harrison's arm, the entire room seemed to hold its breath.

She'd never looked more radiant.

Her flowing gown seemed to shimmer with every step, accentuating her natural elegance. Beside her, Harrison cut a dashing figure in his tailored tuxedo. Together, they looked like something out of a fairy tale.

Even those who remembered her brief marriage to Nathan Sterling couldn't deny the chemistry between Evelyn and Harrison tonight.

"Ms. Carter, what an honor to have you here," the event coordinator gushed as she approached.

Evelyn offered a polite smile. "Charitable causes are always worth supporting."

"We hope you find something special tonight."

The crowd took this as their cue. Well-dressed guests immediately began vying for Evelyn's attention.

"Ms. Carter, I'm Cassandra Lambert from Brisco Group. Such a pleasure."

"Naomi Whitaker here. Perhaps we could collaborate sometime?"

"My company has been following Kingsley Industries' new projects with great interest..."

Evelyn handled the attention with perfect poise - warm enough to be approachable, but reserved enough to maintain her mystique.

"Mr. Whitmore, it's been too long."

The sultry voice came from a woman in a couture gown that probably cost more than most cars. Evelyn recognized her immediately - pop diva Bianca Delacroix.

Bianca was beautiful in that carefully sculpted way that suggested multiple cosmetic enhancements. Right now, her surgically enhanced lips were curved in a smile directed solely at Harrison.

"Have we met?" Harrison asked politely.
###Chapter 207 The Bidding War

Evelyn had witnessed countless social encounters in her life. Even when Harrison dismissed her with indifference, she maintained her composure effortlessly.

"Mr. Whitmore, I completely understand. As a prominent CEO, you must meet countless people. I'm Bianca Delacroix. We were introduced at Horizon Technologies' grand opening last month."

Harrison listened politely but showed no flicker of recognition. "My apologies. That doesn't ring any bells."

His blunt response bordered on rude. Bianca's smile faltered slightly at his words.

Meanwhile, Evelyn found the entire exchange amusing. She marveled at Harrison's ability to remain unaffected by such a stunning woman's advances.

The atmosphere shifted when Nathan Sterling made his entrance, dressed in a tailored Armani suit.

Nathan had chosen to attend this charity gala to rehabilitate Sterling Enterprises' tarnished image. A substantial donation would serve as perfect PR to regain public favor.

"Mr. Sterling, what an honor to have you join us tonight." The event coordinator practically tripped over himself to greet the business magnate. Despite recent scandals, the Sterling name still commanded respect in high society.

Even with their recent troubles, the Sterlings remained among Pamore's elite families. The organizers wouldn't dare slight Nathan, immediately ushering him to a prime front-row seat.

Fate placed him directly beside Evelyn and Harrison.

Nathan's gaze locked onto Evelyn the moment he spotted her. When he noticed Harrison sitting so close, his jaw tightened imperceptibly. He took his seat without uttering a word.

"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our annual charity auction. All proceeds tonight will benefit the Red Cross's programs for orphans and elderly care."

As the opening remarks concluded, the auctioneer took center stage.

"Our first item is a diamond bracelet donated by Summit Corporation, starting at one hundred thousand dollars."

"One-ten!"

"One-thirty!"

"One-fifty!"

The bids came rapidly, finally closing at two hundred thousand.

Evelyn leaned toward Harrison, whispering, "What did you donate tonight?"

"Nothing particularly special," he replied casually.

She nodded, letting the matter drop. As she turned, her eyes accidentally met Nathan's intense stare. She coolly averted her gaze without reaction.

The auction continued smoothly.

"Now we have our fifth item - an Omega timepiece donated by Mr. Harrison Whitmore of Horizon Technologies, starting at fifty thousand dollars."

Before the auctioneer finished speaking, Bianca's paddle shot up from the back. "One million dollars!"

Gasps rippled through the crowd as heads swiveled toward the bold bidder. Bianca simply smiled, radiating confidence.

"What in the world?" Olivia muttered to Natalie. "That watch isn't worth half that. Has she lost her mind?"

Natalie smirked, glancing meaningfully at Evelyn. "I'd say someone's trying to get Harrison's attention."

Olivia's eyes widened. "Seriously? She's making a play for Evelyn's man? That takes some nerve."

In Olivia's opinion, no one measured up to Evelyn. Any woman bold enough to pursue Harrison would need more than beauty - she'd need a death wish.

Natalie chuckled. "Even if she wants him, she'll have to get past Evelyn first. This just got interesting."

Olivia caught her meaning immediately.

"The bid stands at one million dollars. Do I hear any advance?" The auctioneer's voice cut through the murmurs.

"One million going once..."

"One million going twice..."

Just as the gavel hovered, Evelyn calmly raised her paddle from the front row. "Two million."
###Chapter 208 Devious Evelyn

"A watch worth hundreds of thousands of dors gets a two-million-dor bid? This is insane."

"Look who's bidding - Ms. Carter. She's so wealthy she could drown someone in her pocket change."

"For someone like her, two million is like spare change. Barely worth mentioning."

Listening to the murmurs around her, Bianca smirked and raised her paddle again. "Three million dors."

The auctioneer's voice trembled with excitement. "The lady has bid three million dors!"

Without missing a beat, Evelyn lifted her paddle. "Five million."

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

"Did I hear that right? Five million for a watch?"

"Even for charity, this is ridiculous."

"You don't understand rich people's games. It's about pride now."

Harrison leaned toward Evelyn, whispering urgently. "This has gone far enough."

Though confused by her sudden obsession with the watch, he knew its value didn't justify such bids.

Evelyn merely patted his arm. "Trust me, Harry."

Before she finished speaking, Bianca's paddle shot up again. "Six million."

Her expression remained unreadable, as if six million meant nothing.

"Eight million," Evelyn countered immediately.

Bianca's eyes darkened. "Ten million."

The record-breaking bid electrified the room.

"Is Bianca crazy? Ten million for that?"

"When you're that rich, money loses meaning."

"Notice how she's specifically targeting Ms. Carter?"

"This is elite-level sparring. Just watch."

This time, Bianca waited tensely. Ten million was her limit - if Evelyn bid higher, she'd have to concede.

"Ten million going once!" The auctioneer's voice shook.

Bianca stared at Evelyn, but the brunette remained impassive.

"Ten million - sold!"

Bianca's face drained of color as stunned silence filled the hall.

"Congratulations to Ms. Delacroix! Please come forward to complete your purchase."

Ten million. For a watch. Bianca's hands trembled with rage.

She'd expected Evelyn to keep bidding. The cunning heiress had trapped her perfectly.

Under hundreds of watching eyes, Bianca had no choice but to approach the payment desk, her smile brittle.

Olivia and Natalie exchanged knowing glances. "Bianca just got played."

"Evelyn orchestrated this perfectly. Turned a hundred-thousand-dor watch into a ten-million-dor lesson."

"I never realized Evelyn could be this ruthless."

Olivia shook her head. "Poor Bianca."

"She deserved it," Natalie murmured. "Ten million is cheap for learning not to covet what isn't hers."

The watch auction became the night's most talked-about moment.

As excitement buzzed through the crowd, everyone turned their attention to the next anticipated item - the legendary b*dycon gown.
###Chapter 209 The Masquerade

"Next on the auction block is a rare 1990s floral bodycon dress with vintage appeal and significant collector's value." The auctioneer's voice cut through the murmuring crowd. "Opening bid is set at five hundred thousand dollars."

"Five hundred fifty thousand!"

"Six hundred thousand!"

"Seven hundred thousand!"

Within moments, the bidding soared past one million dollars.

Evelyn Carter saw her chance. "One point five million!" Her clear voice rang out across the ballroom.

The crowd hesitated when they recognized the Kingsley heiress, their bidding paddles lowering in deference.

But then Nathan Sterling raised his paddle with deliberate slowness. "One point eight million."

His first bid of the evening - and it was against his ex-wife.

Gasps rippled through the audience. "Is Nathan seriously competing with Evelyn?"

"Ex-husband versus ex-wife - this just got interesting!"

"I didn't pay enough for this popcorn..."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her paddle. She hadn't anticipated Nathan's interference. Without hesitation, she countered, "Two point two million."

Nathan didn't even blink. "Three million." His jaw was set, eyes fixed on the vintage dress with unsettling intensity.

Truth be told, he'd come specifically for this piece. It had once belonged to the Sterling family - part of Margaret Winslow's bridal trousseau before being pawned during Sterling Enterprises' early financial struggles.

After weathering the crisis, Nathan had spent years trying to reclaim it, only to discover it had been donated to a museum. Tonight was his first real chance to bring it home.

"Four million." Evelyn wasn't backing down either.

This dress would be the showstopper for her upcoming fashion exhibition.

"Six million."

The bids escalated rapidly, neither party showing any hesitation as if millions were mere pocket change.

"Eight million."

"Ten million."

"Fourteen million."

When the price hit twenty million, Nathan finally turned to study Evelyn's expression. Her entire focus was on the dress, eyes alight with something deeper than professional interest - a visceral longing that gave him pause.

"Mr. Sterling? Your bid?" The auctioneer prompted.

Nathan's fingers flexed around the paddle. After a weighted silence, he set it down.

"Twenty million going once... twice... Sold to Ms. Evelyn Carter for twenty million dollars!"

Evelyn exhaled sharply. She'd paid quadruple the dress's appraised value, but it was finally hers.

The audience buzzed with speculation. Had Nathan conceded so easily? Or were lingering feelings behind his withdrawal?

Nathan gave nothing away, his expression shuttered as Evelyn rose to complete her purchase.

Harrison Whitmore fell into step beside her, unaware that Nathan had also stood to follow.

At the payment counter, they found Bianca Delacroix looking distressed as she pleaded into her phone. "Jayda, please - just three million as a loan. I'll repay you next month, I swear."

Her desperate tone suggested the answer wasn't favorable. The struggling actress's facade was crumbling spectacularly.

What a pitiful performance. The woman was clearly out of her depth pretending to be something she wasn't.
###Chapter 210 I Hope You'll Move On Soon

Ignoring Bianca, Evelyn retrieved her credit card from her clutch.

Just as she extended it toward the boutique attendant, Harrison smoothly intercepted. "Use mine."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her card. "No, Harrison. This is my purchase."

His lips curved into that charming smile that made women swoon. "Consider it an investment in your future success. May this dress bring you luck at your upcoming fashion showcase."

Her breath caught. "What?"

Before she could protest further, Harrison handed his black Amex to the wide-eyed sales associate.

Twenty million dollars. Gone in a single swipe for that breathtaking floral bodycon masterpiece.

Evelyn bit her lip, overwhelmed by his generosity.

When the attendant presented the packaged dress, Evelyn's pulse quickened. The intricate embroidery shimmered under the boutique lights—each stitch a testament to the designer's genius.

"Thank you, Harrison."

He ruffled her hair affectionately. "Worth every penny to see that spark in your eyes."

The tender moment shattered when Nathan Sterling materialized beside them, his stormy gaze locked on the garment bag.

"Evelyn." His voice dripped with disapproval.

She stiffened. "Mr. Sterling."

Nathan's jaw clenched as he noted her immediate shift in demeanor—warmth for Harrison, ice for him.

"Accepting such an extravagant gift seems...reckless." His eyes darkened. "Men don't spend twenty million without expectations."

Harrison stepped between them, his posture protective. "Careful, Sterling. That sounded dangerously close to an accusation."

"Take it however you like." Nathan's stare was a challenge.

Evelyn's laugh cut through the tension. "How amusing that my ex-husband suddenly cares about my financial decisions."

Nathan flinched. "Three years together, and you can move on this easily?"

The words hung between them, heavy with unspoken history.

Evelyn's smile turned bittersweet. "Some of us prefer to face forward rather than dwell on dead-end roads."

"But I can't forget." His whisper was raw.

Her chest ached at the irony. When she'd loved him desperately, he'd looked right through her. Now that she'd walked away, he suddenly remembered what they'd had.

"Then I hope you find peace, Mr. Sterling." She adjusted the garment bag on her arm. "Because this chapter is closed."

Nathan's hand twitched as if to reach for her, then fell limp at his side. The finality in her voice struck deeper than any blade.

As Evelyn turned away, Harrison's fingers brushed the small of her back—a silent promise of support.

Nathan watched them go, the hollow ache in his chest spreading like poison. Some losses, he was learning too late, were permanent.
###Chapter 211 Thank You for Letting Go

Nathan fought to keep his emotions in check.

His face remained expressionless as he changed the subject. "This bodycon dress is exquisite."

Evelyn noticed his lingering gaze on the garment. "Do you like this design too, Mr. Sterling?"

Nathan gave nothing away. "Beautiful things catch everyone's eye, don't they?"

Evelyn caught the subtle undertone in his words but chose not to pursue it. "Well, thank you for letting me have it, Mr. Sterling." With that, she turned on her heel.

Nathan said nothing more, his eyes following her retreating figure.

The moment Evelyn left, Bianca materialized beside him like an unwelcome shadow. "Mr. Sterling, could you lend me three million dollars?"

When Nathan turned to face her eager expression, mockery glinted in his eyes. "I don't make a habit of financing strangers."

Bianca flushed at the blatant rejection. With no way to secure the funds, security soon escorted her out.

After leaving the auction, Nathan's mood remained stormy. He sat in his car, chain-smoking until the interior became hazy with smoke.

Staring at the growing pile of cigarette butts, he finally called Simon. "Compile all projects Evelyn has handled at Kingsley Industries recently."

Simon asked no questions. "Right away, Mr. Sterling."

"I want the report within the hour," Nathan added before hanging up.

He started the engine and drove off into the night.

Simon worked efficiently. In under an hour, a comprehensive dossier on Evelyn's recent projects landed in Nathan's inbox.

Nathan scrolled through the files methodically.

Most were routine corporate collaborations, including several with French partners.

His finger paused over the name "Adrian Prescott." Surprisingly, Adrian had risen quickly at Kingsley Industries, overseeing multiple major accounts.

"Mr. Sterling, it appears Ms. Carter hasn't been handling corporate projects recently," Simon reported.

Nathan's eyebrow arched. "Then what has occupied her time?"

"She's taken over Professor Whitaker's role as lead designer for this year's Pamore Fashion Week."

Nathan froze.

"Pamore Fashion Week?" The pieces clicked into place. That explained her interest in the bodycon dress.

"I recall their organizers approached us about venue rental."

"Correct, sir. You initially intended to decline."

Without hesitation, Nathan countered, "Change of plans. Grant them the venue. Consider it a corporate sponsorship."

Simon's jaw dropped.

The Sterling Plaza rental fees exceeded millions daily. Yet Nathan was offering it freely—for Evelyn.

"Understood, sir. I'll arrange it immediately."

As lead designer, Evelyn immersed herself completely in the collection. She personally oversaw every detail, from fabric selection to final stitches.

Unaware that Sterling Enterprises had just gifted her the most prestigious venue in the city.
###Chapter 212 A Lesson in Humility

The news about the sponsorship reached Evelyn Carter just one day before the fashion show rehearsal.

"Darling, guess what?" Olivia Sinclair's eyes sparkled with excitement. "Sterling Enterprises is funding this entire venue. And get this—Nathan Sterling himself will be delivering the opening speech tomorrow."

Evelyn nearly dropped the fabric swatches in her hands. "Since when does Sterling Enterprises dabble in charity work?"

Olivia smirked, crossing her arms. "Oh, please. It's obviously damage control after Vanessa's little scandal. Their reputation took a hit, so now they're playing the benevolent benefactors."

A mischievous glint appeared in Olivia's eyes as she leaned closer. "But what if... just what if Nathan only agreed to this because he knows you're the lead designer?"

Evelyn's fingers stilled. Olivia had unwittingly struck a nerve.

"Don't be ridiculous," Evelyn scoffed, though her voice lacked conviction.

She knew Nathan better than anyone.

The man had never gone out of his way for anything—least of all for her. Why would he start now?

Besides...

"Whatever Nathan does these days is none of my concern. We're like parallel lines—destined never to intersect."

Olivia arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "I just hope certain people see it that way too."

Evelyn shrugged. "How others perceive things is their problem, not mine."

Meanwhile, at Kingsley Industries, Julian Hawthorne was far from idle.

His high-stakes wager with Evelyn still loomed over him, keeping him on constant alert.

"Mr. Hawthorne," his assistant reported, "Adrian Prescott has taken charge of all major projects, while Maxwell Donovan handles the smaller ones. Ms. Carter has been completely absorbed with the fashion show preparations."

A pause. Then—

"Initial reports indicate the show has already generated millions in revenue. After tomorrow's event, projections suggest at least a fivefold increase in the apparel division's earnings."

Julian's knuckles turned white around his pen.

Compared to previous fiscal years, this performance was unprecedented. If this momentum continued...

Evelyn might actually win their bet.

And if she did?

He'd be the one packing his office.

A slow, calculating smile spread across Julian's face as he drummed his fingers against the mahogany desk. "The show's tomorrow, correct?"

"Yes, sir."

Julian's smile turned predatory. "A fivefold increase isn't so easily achieved. Tell me... what would happen if there were... complications during the event?"

His assistant paled. "The financial losses would be substantial. We're talking tens of millions, easily."

Julian chuckled darkly. "Tens of millions ought to teach her some humility. That girl still has much to learn about playing in the big leagues."

With a sharp gesture, he beckoned his assistant closer.

The whispered orders that followed made the younger man's hands tremble. "It will be handled discreetly, Mr. Hawthorne. No traces leading back to you."

Julian's eyes turned to ice. "See that it stays that way. One slip, and you'll find yourself unemployed—or worse."

As his assistant scurried away, Julian leaned back, satisfaction curling through him.

"Evelyn Carter," he murmured to the empty office. "Time for your first real lesson."

###Chapter 213 The Stranger I Married

The Pamore Fashion Show was nothing short of spectacular.

The venue buzzed with elite designers, rising industry stars, and journalists from every major fashion publication worldwide.

Backstage, Evelyn moved with practiced efficiency, overseeing last-minute adjustments while Olivia coordinated the makeup artists and wardrobe team.

Every detail mattered. There was zero margin for error.

Evelyn's shoulders remained tense beneath her tailored blazer until Olivia pressed a chilled water bottle into her hands.

"Drink. You look like you're about to combust."

Evelyn accepted it with a grateful nod.

Just as they finished final checks, her phone vibrated.

Julian Hartwell's name flashed across the screen.

Her brother hadn't contacted her in weeks. Why now?

Stepping outside, Evelyn found a quiet corner.

"Jules! To what do I owe this rare honor?"

Julian's grinning face filled the screen. "Can't a brother congratulate his baby sister on her big day?"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "You've had weeks to call."

"Didn't want to distract you!" His tone turned sincere. "But seriously, Evie—I'm proud of you. Sent a little something your way too. Should arrive any minute."

Evelyn's curiosity piqued. "What is it?"

Julian winked. "Patience, darling."

Just as she opened her mouth to protest, a familiar silhouette caught her eye.

Nathan Sterling.

"Gotta go, Jules." She ended the call abruptly.

Nathan approached, his gaze sweeping over the organized chaos backstage before settling on her.

"I had no idea you possessed such remarkable design talent." His voice held genuine astonishment. "How much about you remains unknown to me, Evelyn?"

The question hung between them, weighted with unspoken history.

Evelyn forced a tight smile. "There are entire chapters of my life you've never bothered to read, Mr. Sterling. A bit late to start now, don't you think?"

Nathan's expression darkened with something resembling regret. "It seems I never truly took the time to know the woman I married."

The raw honesty in his words stole her breath.

Evelyn steeled herself. "That ship has sailed. Since you're here as a guest, the audience area is that way." She pointed firmly toward the exit.

Nathan hesitated, as if wanting to say more, but Evelyn had already turned away.

Some doors, once closed, were better left unopened.
###Chapter 214 The Show Is Ruined

Evelyn remained impassive. "Mr. Sterling, you're looking for the wrong person. Isabella is still behind bars. Perhaps you should pay her a visit instead."

At the mention of that name, Nathan's face darkened. "Don't speak of her."

A cold smile touched Evelyn's lips. "What's the matter, Mr. Sterling? Did your precious first love turn into your worst nightmare?"

Nathan clenched his jaw, struggling to contain his frustration. "Evelyn, you don't understand the full story between us. If you'd just listen—"

"That's enough," Evelyn cut him off sharply. "Today is important to me. Dwelling on the past will only bring misfortune."

She couldn't care less about whatever history existed between Nathan and Isabella. Their messy relationship held no interest for her.

"I must go now. Feel free to enjoy the event." Without another glance, Evelyn turned and walked away.

But when she returned backstage, chaos greeted her.

"Evie! Thank God you're here!" Olivia rushed forward, gripping her arm tightly.

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "What's happened?"

"The collection—it's destroyed."

Her heart dropped. Evelyn pushed through the crowd to see her carefully crafted designs lying in tatters on the worktable.

She picked up a shredded sleeve with trembling fingers. "How?" The word came out strangled.

"Ms. Carter, we only stepped away for five minutes..."

"When we returned, it was like this."

"No one saw who did it."

"The show starts in thirty minutes!"

"These were all the key pieces. It's over."

The models murmured among themselves, their expressions ranging from shock to resignation.

Olivia's face flushed with rage. "Which coward did this? When I find them, I'll—"

A staff member burst in. "Ms. Carter! They're ready for final checks on stage."

Evelyn forced herself to breathe. "How much time do we actually have?"

Olivia checked her watch. "Twenty-six minutes until curtain, but our segment isn't until forty minutes into the program."

Evelyn examined the damage with new determination. "Get me scissors. And every needle and thread you can find."

The team scrambled to obey.

Olivia frowned. "Evie, what are you thinking?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Let's see if we can turn this disaster into something salvageable."

She set to work immediately, draping the ruined fabric over a dress form. The scissors flashed as she began reshaping the material.

Meanwhile, in the auditorium, every seat was filled. Camera crews from major fashion networks adjusted their equipment. This show had drawn international attention.

Though uninvited, Julian Hawthorne sat in an obscure corner. His assistant Donovan Pierce leaned in discreetly.

"Everything went according to plan, Director Hawthorne. Clean and untraceable."

Julian's lips curved. "Excellent. I can't wait to see how the brilliant Evelyn Carter handles this little... setback."

His eyes gleamed with anticipation. Soon, he'd watch her empire crumble—and she'd have no choice but to come crawling to him.
###Chapter 215 Buying Time

The backstage area buzzed with frantic energy as the clock ticked down.

"What's the plan, Evelyn? The show starts in five minutes." Olivia paced nervously, her heels clicking against the floor.

Evelyn's fingers flew across the fabric, but the dress remained unfinished.

"Maybe we should request a delay from the organizers," Olivia suggested, wringing her hands.

Evelyn shook her head sharply. "Absolutely not. This show is make-or-break for our brand. Any delay would be disastrous."

"Then what? We can't just stand here!"

The needle flashed in Evelyn's hands as she worked faster. A sudden idea made her pause. "Unless... we create a diversion."

"With the show starting now? What kind of diversion would work?"

Backstage staff exchanged worried glances, but no one had solutions.

Evelyn's voice turned decisive. "Have the first-round models walk an extra lap. That'll buy us ten minutes."

Protests erupted immediately.

"The press will notice! They'll smell trouble backstage."

"This audience has industry heavyweights. One misstep and we're finished."

Beads of sweat dotted Evelyn's forehead, but her hands never stopped moving.

The opening music began.

On stage, the host's voice boomed through the speakers.

"It's starting. Nathan Sterling will give his welcome speech shortly. First-round models to positions!"

With no other choice, the models prepared to walk.

Olivia grabbed Evelyn's arm. "How much longer?"

Evelyn bit her lip. "Fifteen minutes."

Taking a deep breath, Olivia turned to the models. "Ladies, slow your pace out there. Stretch every second."

The models nodded and moved toward the stage.

Olivia watched as Nathan stepped into the spotlight, impeccably dressed. As the show's primary sponsor, his presence commanded attention.

Five minutes passed. Then ten.

Olivia checked her watch in disbelief. Nathan's speech continued well beyond the scheduled time.

"Evelyn... is Nathan stalling for us?"

Evelyn barely glanced up, her fingers finishing the final stitches. With a decisive snip of her scissors, she exhaled. "Done. It's finished."

Olivia gasped at the transformed gown. Though using less fabric, the design now flowed with breathtaking elegance.

"Model! Quick change!"

As the model rushed into the altered dress, Olivia checked the clock again. "We made it. Just in time."

Back on stage, Nathan concluded his speech precisely as the first model stepped onto the runway.
###Chapter 216 The Runway Rescue

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her shoulders relaxing. "Thank goodness."

Her gaze lifted to the stage where Nathan stood silhouetted against the spotlight. The glare obscured his features, but his steady voice resonated clearly through her earpiece.

Suddenly, everything clicked into place.

Nathan's address stretched to an unprecedented fifteen minutes - triple the allocated time slot.

Yet not a single journalist showed restlessness. His words painted an electrifying vision for Sterling Enterprises' future that held the entire audience captive, especially Pamore's representatives.

"Director Hawthorne, what's happening?" Donovan whispered urgently. "Why is Mr. Sterling's speech running so long?"

Julian suspected deliberate delay, though he dismissed the notion that mere minutes could alter their carefully laid plans. "Do we have contingency measures?"

Donovan smirked. "Everything's under control. This fashion show will implode spectacularly."

The moment Nathan concluded, the first wave of models prepared for their entrance.

Then chaos erupted.

"Ms. Carter!" A panicked assistant rushed over. "Emergency! The lead model for the floral bodycon ensemble just injured her foot!"

Evelyn shot up. "What? Where is she?"

In the dressing room, the designated model lay curled on the floor, clutching her bleeding foot with tear-streaked cheeks.

"First aid kit! Now!" Evelyn commanded. The assistant scrambled to comply.

"How did this happen?" Evelyn demanded as she applied pressure.

"I don't know!" The model sobbed. "There was a razor blade hidden in my heels! My segment's next - I can't walk like this!"

Ice flooded Evelyn's veins. This was sabotage.

"Can you stand at all?"

A miserable head shake answered her.

Olivia groaned. "This is catastrophic! Where do we find a replacement now? That dress requires specific proportions!"

Evelyn's eyes locked onto the scandalously fitted garment. A wild idea took root. "Prep my makeup. Now."

Olivia's face lit with understanding. "Brilliant! You're perfect for this!"

Evelyn nodded grimly. Desperate times.

Onstage, the opening collection already sparked murmurs of awe. Gasps rippled through the crowd as traditional pottery motifs merged with puppet theater influences in breathtaking silhouettes.

"My God! They've transformed cultural heritage into wearable art!"

"That dance-inspired embroidery is revolutionary!"

"These pieces will dominate next season's trends!"

Camera flashes erupted like fireworks as journalists documented each revolutionary design.

Meanwhile, backstage...

Evelyn stood before the mirror, the bodycon dress clinging to her curves like liquid art. The makeup artist worked frantically to transform her into the collection's showstopper.

"Thirty seconds!" a stage manager called.

Olivia squeezed her hand. "You've got this."

Evelyn inhaled deeply. The show must go on.
###Chapter 217 A Showstopping Moment

"This could go viral worldwide."

Julian Hawthorne's expression darkened as he overheard the murmurs of approval surrounding him. Most attendees were raving about the fashion show unfolding before them.

Beside him, Donovan Pierce wiped his damp forehead nervously. "Mr. Hawthorne, they lost their signature pieces," he whispered. "This will be a complete disaster when-"

His words died abruptly as a model wearing the redesigned centerpiece made her grand entrance.

The entire venue fell into stunned silence. Every eye locked onto the runway.

Evelyn Carter's on-the-spot redesign featured daring color combinations and revolutionary silhouettes.

What made it truly extraordinary was its uniqueness - a masterpiece demanding undivided attention.

"Quick, get shots of this! The tailoring is impeccable. Undoubtedly tonight's showstopper."

"This designer is phenomenal! She's created an entirely new aesthetic."

"I must interview her immediately after this."

"To design such groundbreaking pieces while honoring our cultural heritage - she must be deeply patriotic."

"She deserves every headline we'll write about her."

Julian's face twisted in barely concealed rage. He shifted uncomfortably, unable to find a comfortable position.

As he stared at the transformed garments, conflicting emotions warred within him.

He'd severely underestimated Evelyn Carter.

Who could have imagined she'd reconstruct shredded fabric into breathtaking new designs?

And accomplished this impossible feat in mere minutes?

A violent coughing fit seized Julian. Donovan rushed to support him. "Mr. Hawthorne, are you-"

"Get off me!" Julian shoved him away. "Is this your idea of handling things?"

"I...I don't understand how this happened. But I swear, I have a backup plan."

Julian's jaw clenched painfully.

Their shock intensified when Evelyn herself appeared on the runway moments later.

Her graceful figure moved with timeless elegance, as if she'd stepped straight out of a vintage photograph.

The audience gasped collectively.

"Exquisite! Absolutely breathtaking! This bodycon dress is a work of art! Every stitch whispers retro glamour."

"The model and dress complement each other perfectly, like they were made for one another. I can't look away."

"This must be the grand finale. It's spectacular. Truly spectacular."

Excitement electrified the air.

Camera flashes exploded like fireworks as Evelyn commanded the stage. The live stream servers nearly crashed from the sudden influx of viewers.

Comments flooded the screen:

"Good heavens, this model is divine. She radiates old Hollywood charm."

"She looks familiar though... Have we seen her somewhere?"

"Wait, I recognize her! She's the Kingsley heiress - from the world's wealthiest family!"

"The heiress is modeling? And she's absolutely slaying it!"

"I'm officially declaring myself an Evelyn Carter fan starting today. No takebacks."

"But that dress... I've seen it before. Wasn't this the same piece that sold for $20 million at auction last month?"
###Chapter 218 We Won't Tolerate It

"What? Twenty million dollars for a single dress?"

"That's insane—but honestly? Worth every penny!"

Evelyn Carter remained blissfully unaware of the murmurs swirling around her. She glided onto the runway with effortless grace, every step radiating confidence.

The audience was spellbound.

Especially Nathan Sterling, who stood mere feet away, his gaze locked onto her.

At that moment, nothing else existed for him.

Only her.

When Evelyn finished her walk, her legs nearly gave out the second she stepped offstage. She stumbled—straight into someone’s waiting arms.

Julian Hartwell caught her effortlessly, pulling her close.

Evelyn blinked up at him in surprise. "Julian? What are you doing here?"

He smirked, releasing her just enough to meet her eyes. "I promised you a gift, but you never came to claim it. So I brought it to you instead."

Then it clicked—he was the gift.

"Oh!" She laughed, breathless. "Well, thank you. Let me change, and I’ll treat you to dinner after this."

Julian hummed in agreement, his expression softening with unmistakable affection.

As Evelyn hurried toward the dressing room, Julian turned—only to lock eyes with Nathan.

The air between them crackled with tension.

Julian scoffed, deliberately looking away.

The fashion show was a triumph.

By the time it ended, it had already taken over every trending list. International media clamored for coverage, and discussions about it reached a fever pitch.

When Evelyn emerged in her street clothes, reporters swarmed her instantly.

"Ms. Carter, did you design every piece showcased tonight?"

"Where did your inspiration come from?"

She moved with the same effortless elegance she’d displayed on the runway—timeless, magnetic.

The crowd erupted.

"Stunning! Absolutely breathtaking! That bodycon dress is a masterpiece—every stitch screams vintage luxury!"

"The model and the dress are a perfect match. Like they were made for each other."

"This is the highlight of the night, no contest."

Cameras flashed nonstop, and the livestream chat exploded.

"Who is that model? She’s got that old Hollywood glamour."

"Wait, she looks familiar… Oh my God, that’s Evelyn Carter—the Kingsley heiress!"

"The billionaire heiress just walked a runway? And she owned it."

"New life goal: Be Evelyn Carter."

"That dress though—wasn’t it auctioned for twenty million last month?"
###Chapter 219 A Fateful Encounter with Victoria

"I've completed the investigation."

Harrison stepped out from the shadows and faced Evelyn. "We've reviewed all surveillance footage from the venue and found some leads. However, we only have a clear view of the perpetrator's back."

"What? Someone actually sabotaged it deliberately!" Olivia's voice trembled with anger.

"Can the police identify the person with just their back?" Evelyn asked anxiously.

Harrison placed a reassuring hand on her shoulder. "Don't worry. He won't escape justice."

Evelyn finally allowed herself to relax at his words.

"Everyone has worked exceptionally hard these past weeks. I've reserved the VIP lounge at the Sapphire Club. Let's go unwind!"

The staff erupted in cheers at Harrison's announcement.

"Thank you, Ms. Carter!"

"We appreciate it, Mr. Whitmore!"

Meanwhile, Evelyn turned to Julian with a mischievous grin. "You're coming with us."

Julian shrugged nonchalantly. "Fine."

But Evelyn wasn't finished. She immediately dialed Sophia's number.

As predicted, when Sophia heard Julian would be attending, she demanded the address immediately.

An hour later, the group gathered in the most luxurious private suite at Sapphire Club.

Sophia spotted Julian first and approached him confidently. "Long time no see."

Julian offered a polite but distant smile. "Indeed."

A flicker of disappointment crossed Sophia's eyes at his reserved response.

Evelyn intervened smoothly. "Don't just stand there. Come join us." She guided Sophia to sit beside Julian.

"Waiter, bring the champagne!" Olivia called out.

Meanwhile, Natalie browsed the karaoke selections. "Evelyn, what would you like to sing? I'll queue it up."

"Anything is fine," Evelyn replied absently.

Just then, the head waitress entered with a bottle of Dom Pérignon. "Ladies and gentlemen, your champagne has arrived."

That voice—Evelyn froze. It sounded hauntingly familiar.

Her gaze snapped upward, locking eyes with the waitress. The air between them crackled with tension.

Victoria Sinclair never imagined she'd encounter Evelyn Carter like this.

She quickly averted her eyes, pretending not to recognize her. "Please enjoy. Should you require anything, simply ring the service bell."

With that, she practically fled the room, her face ashen.

Outside, a concerned colleague asked, "Victoria, are you alright?"

Victoria waved her off. "I'm fine. Just tired."

The colleague hesitated but eventually walked away.

Victoria's expression darkened as memories flooded back—the scandal that destroyed her reputation, the impossibility of finding decent work in all of Pemberly City.

This menial job at the club had been her last resort.

All thanks to Evelyn Carter.

Victoria knew Evelyn had orchestrated her downfall.

Seeing Evelyn surrounded by admirers while she served drinks was salt in the wound.

Why?

Why did Evelyn thrive while she struggled to survive?

A cold smirk twisted Victoria's lips as a dangerous glint entered her eyes. She stalked away with renewed determination.

"Evelyn, what's caught your attention?" Harrison followed her gaze but only saw a woman's retreating figure.
###Chapter 220 Truth or Dare

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly as she averted her gaze. "It's nothing."

"What's everyone up to? Drinks are getting warm." Olivia approached with a champagne flute in hand.

The energy in the private room was electric.

"Just drinking is dull. Let's spice things up," Natalie suggested, though her eyes kept darting between Sophia and Julian.

Those two hadn't exchanged a single word since sitting together.

As best friends, the girls were naturally Sophia's strongest allies.

Natalie and Olivia exchanged knowing glances before pulling Evelyn and Harrison into their game.

"What are we playing?" Evelyn asked.

Natalie's lips curved mischievously. "What else? Truth or dare, obviously."

"Sounds perfect." Olivia agreed immediately, and the group formed a circle.

"Rules are simple," Natalie explained. "Whoever the bottle lands on chooses truth or dare. No cheating. And losers drink."

She added with a smirk, "If there are no objections, let's begin."

With dramatic flair, Natalie spun the bottle first. "Five... four... three... two... one!"

The neck pointed directly at Olivia.

"Seriously? Me first?" Olivia blinked in surprise.

"Enough stalling," Natalie teased. "Truth or dare?"

"Truth, obviously."

Natalie and Evelyn exchanged conspiratorial looks. Finally Evelyn asked, "Name your current crush in three seconds."

"What?" Olivia's eyes widened.

Then she broke into a triumphant grin. "Single and proud, ladies. No crushes here. Bottoms up!"

Without hesitation, Olivia raised her glass and drained it in one go.

Natalie tsked. "So quick to drink. Remember - lies mean double penalties."

Olivia winked. "Cross my heart, it's the truth."

Second round began with Olivia spinning the bottle, which landed squarely on Harrison.

The girls erupted in cheers. "Harrison! Truth or dare?"

Harrison's smile deepened as his gaze found Evelyn's. After a dramatic pause, he declared, "Dare."

Reading the room perfectly, Natalie and Olivia chorused, "Then you'll do a love shot with Evelyn."

Suddenly Julian interjected, "Wait! Harrison's the one playing. Why involve Evelyn?"

Sophia promptly kicked him under the table. Julian shot her a confused look, but she pretended not to notice, joining the chant. "I think it's brilliant."

"Hold on, Evelyn—" Julian wasn't stupid. His eyes darted between Harrison and Evelyn as realization dawned. Something was definitely brewing between them.

Evelyn didn't protest. She picked up her glass and met Harrison's eyes. "Harrison."

Their arms intertwined as the group cheered. They downed their drinks in perfect sync.

"Wow! Now that's chemistry!" Olivia exclaimed, sending the energy in the room skyrocketing.

Evelyn felt heat creeping up her cheeks. Even after setting her glass down, her heart continued its wild rhythm.

The game continued.

"Your turn, Harrison. Spin the bottle."

Just as Harrison reached for the bottle, the private room door swung open.
###Chapter 221 Inferno

"Ladies and gentlemen, your dessert platter has arrived."

A server moved swiftly between them, placing the elaborate fruit arrangement on the table. No one noticed when she discreetly turned the lock on the private dining room's door as she exited.

Outside, Victoria Sinclair clutched the stolen key, her expression darkening with resolve.

"Evelyn," she whispered to herself, "if I can't have happiness, neither will you."

Somehow she'd obtained a canister of gasoline. With violent motions, she doused the entire doorway and surrounding hallway before pulling out a silver lighter. The flame caught instantly when she tossed it onto the slick surface.

Fire exploded outward in hungry tendrils.

Victoria's laughter echoed through the smoke-filled corridor. "Burn, Evelyn! Burn with all your precious friends!"

"Fire! The building's on fire!" A passing waiter screamed, triggering the emergency alarms.

Panic erupted as staff and patrons stampeded toward exits. "Help! Someone call the fire department!"

Inside the locked room, Harrison Whitmore reacted first. "Smoke!" He immediately reached for Evelyn, pulling her toward the sealed exit.

The others scrambled up in confusion, chairs scraping violently against the floor.

"Why won't this door open?" Harrison demanded, rattling the handle.

Julian rushed forward to help, throwing his weight against the unyielding barrier. "It's jammed!"

Thick smoke began curling under the doorframe. "Use napkins to cover your faces!" Olivia coughed out.

Chaos overtook the group. With only one exit blocked by flames, they were effectively trapped.

"Call for help!" Natalie gasped, already dialing emergency services.

Evelyn simultaneously contacted Maxwell. "We're trapped in a fire at the restaurant. Send rescue immediately."

On the other end, Maxwell nearly dropped his phone before mobilizing every available resource.

Meanwhile, the truth game continued despite the danger. Olivia spun the bottle again, and it landed pointed directly at Harrison.

Natalie whooped with nervous excitement. "Harrison! Truth or dare?"

His gaze never left Evelyn's smoke-stung eyes. "Dare."

The women exchanged knowing looks before declaring in unison, "Then share a romantic cocktail with Evelyn!"

Julian immediately protested. "Wait, that's not fair! Harrison lost, why should Evelyn—"

Sophia stomped on his foot sharply. When he turned in confusion, she deliberately avoided his gaze and joined the cheering. "Perfect choice! Let's see that love shot!"

Understanding dawned on Julian as he studied Harrison and Evelyn's charged expressions. Something deeper clearly existed between them.

Evelyn didn't hesitate. She lifted her glass and met Harrison's eyes. "Ready?"

Their arms intertwined as the group cheered. The alcohol burned going down, but not as much as the heat between them.

"Now that's chemistry!" Olivia exclaimed, momentarily forgetting their dire circumstances.

Evelyn's cheeks flamed hotter than the encroaching fire. Even after breaking contact, her pulse continued racing.

"Your turn to spin, Harrison," Natalie reminded.

Just then, the door shuddered violently under Julian and Harrison's combined kicks.

Smoke poured thicker into the room, triggering violent coughing fits.

"What now? We're trapped!" Olivia gasped between spasms, tears streaming from irritated eyes.

"We'll make it," Evelyn assured, though her voice wavered.

The men redoubled their efforts against the door. With a final thunderous crash, it gave way—only to reveal a wall of raging flames blocking escape.

"Fall back!" Harrison ordered as heat blasted inward.

Sophia trembled against Julian. "Are we...are we going to die here?"

"No!" Evelyn scanned the room desperately before grabbing decorative pillows. "Soak these in water! We can use them as shields!"

Everyone followed her lead, but conditions deteriorated rapidly. The smoke grew suffocating, flames licking closer.

Sophia suddenly clung to Julian. "If this is really the end, I need to tell you—"

He pressed a hand over her mouth. "Don't. We're getting out. All of us."

Through the roaring flames and thickening black smoke, the group huddled together, their fate hanging in the balance as the fire closed in from all sides.
###Chapter 222 Critical Moment

Sophia Whitmore shook violently as she coughed, tears streaming down her flushed cheeks. Her voice came out in ragged gasps between coughs.

"Nathan...there's something I need to tell you..."

Julian Hartwell tightened his arms around her trembling form. "Don't speak," he murmured, pressing her closer. "The smoke's too thick. Save your strength."

But Sophia wouldn't be silenced. Her vision blurred from the acrid smoke, yet she clung to Nathan with desperate strength. If these were her final moments, she wanted them to be in his arms.

The once-celebratory atmosphere had turned deadly. Through stinging eyes, Harrison Whitmore spotted a fire extinguisher mounted on the far wall.

Without hesitation, he stripped off his jacket and wrapped it around his head. "Cover your faces!" he shouted before plunging into the flames.

"Harrison!" Evelyn Carter screamed as fire licked at his exposed skin.

With remarkable speed, Harrison wrestled the extinguisher from its mount. White foam sprayed toward the inferno as he yelled, "Everyone out! Now!"

The group scrambled toward the exit as an alarm finally blared through the chaos.

"Sophia?" Nathan called, but she'd already gone limp in his arms.

On the other side of the room, Evelyn collapsed, her lungs burning. Just before darkness claimed her, she felt strong arms catch her fall.

Three days later...

In Frenda's most prestigious hospital, the Kingsley family kept vigil around a still figure.

Leonard Kingsley gripped his cane until his knuckles turned white. "When will she wake?" he demanded for the tenth time.

Dominic Kingsley placed a steadying hand on his grandfather's shoulder. "The doctors say Evelyn's vitals are strong. She just needs time."

"Time?" Leonard's cane struck the floor sharply. "It's been seventy-two hours!"

As Dominic turned to summon another physician, a soft groan came from the bed.

Evelyn's eyelids fluttered open, revealing confused hazel eyes. The sterile white room and sharp antiseptic scent overwhelmed her senses.

"Grandfather...Dominic...Julian..." Her voice emerged as a painful rasp. "What happened?"

Julian moved to her side instantly. "You were caught in the club fire, remember? You passed out from smoke inhalation."

Fragmented memories surfaced - heat, screams, Harrison's heroic dash through flames. Evelyn's eyes widened. "Olivia! The others - are they-?"

"Everyone's safe," Julian assured, smoothing her hair. "Focus on recovering now."

But Evelyn's mind raced with unanswered questions as she weakly grasped his hand. The fire hadn't been an accident - and someone would pay for nearly taking everything from her.
###Chapter 223 Harrison's Heroic Rescue

Dominic's expression darkened as he spoke in a low voice. "Evelyn, you gave us all such a fright. Grandfather hasn't slept in seventy-two hours."

Evelyn turned her gaze toward Leonard with remorse. "Grandfather, please forgive me."

Leonard squeezed her hand gently. "Don't apologize, child. You've endured a terrible ordeal. Your body suffered severe trauma." His voice softened. "If not for that brave Whitmore boy charging into the flames..."

At the mention of Harrison, Evelyn's eyes darted around the room. Her pulse quickened when she didn't see him. "Where is he? Where's Harrison?"

Behind her, Dominic exchanged a loaded glance with Julian.

After a weighted pause, Dominic answered carefully. "He's recovering. Second-degree burns on his left arm and back. Beatrice is with him in the adjacent suite."

The words hit Evelyn like a physical blow. She threw off the blankets. "He's injured because of me?"

Julian's throat tightened with guilt. He'd prioritized protecting Sophia while flames engulfed the building. That single decision had earned him Leonard and his brothers' scathing disapproval.

This time, Harrison had been Evelyn's savior. The Kingsleys owed him everything.

"Relax," Dominic soothed. "He's being treated by the best burn specialists in Europe. The question is - how are you feeling?"

"Fine," Evelyn said automatically, already swinging her legs over the bed's edge.

Leonard blocked her path. "And where do you imagine you're going, young lady?"

"I need to see Harrison. I won't rest until I know he's alright."

Leonard sighed. "Stubborn as always. At least let the nurse bring a wheelchair."

"That's unnecessary. I can walk."

But Leonard's resolve proved stronger. Minutes later, Evelyn found herself being wheeled down the corridor by Dominic.

Inside the neighboring suite, Beatrice stood vigil beside the bed where Harrison lay prone, his bandaged back facing upward.

"Harrison."

He stirred at the sound of Evelyn's voice, muscles tensing to rise. Beatrice pressed a firm hand to his shoulder. "Don't you dare move those dressings."

Evelyn rushed to add, "Please stay still."

Harrison reluctantly settled back down.

Beatrice turned concerned eyes toward Evelyn. "How are you feeling, dear? Any dizziness? Nausea?"

"I'm perfectly fine," Evelyn assured her. "How serious are his injuries?"

"Count your blessings you're both alive," Beatrice said briskly, though her eyes betrayed deeper emotion. "Harrison's tough as nails. These wounds will heal."

Despite Beatrice's matter-of-fact tone, guilt twisted Evelyn's stomach. "Does it hurt terribly?" she asked softly.

Harrison shook his head against the pillow. "Worth it."

Recognizing the couple needed privacy, Dominic and Beatrice discreetly exited.

Once the door clicked shut, Beatrice's composed facade cracked. "Have they identified the fire's origin?"

Dominic's jaw hardened. "It wasn't an accident. The arsonist is already in custody."

Beatrice's lips thinned. "The audacity. They nearly killed Evelyn in broad daylight."

"She'll face consequences," Dominic promised darkly. "My family doesn't forgive attempts on our blood."

"See that they don't," Beatrice said icily. "Because if your justice proves inadequate, the Whitmores have our own methods."
###Chapter 224 Teaching Victoria a Lesson

"Excellent. Making her suffer would be too kind. I leave this matter in your capable hands."

The Kingsley and Whitmore families had come to an agreement. Victoria Sinclair's fate was sealed.

In a damp, windowless cellar, Victoria's wrists and ankles were bound with coarse rope. A filthy rag covered her eyes, while a sweat-stained sock gagged her mouth. She could neither speak nor see.

The creak of rusted hinges announced someone's arrival. Heavy footsteps echoed against the concrete floor.

When Victoria sensed the presence, she thrashed violently against her restraints, muffled sobs escaping through the gag.

Evelyn Carter stood motionless, her icy gaze fixed on the trembling woman. "It's me," she said at last, her voice devoid of warmth.

At the sound of Evelyn's voice, Victoria froze. She turned blindly toward the source, though the rag prevented her from seeing.

Evelyn reached forward, yanking the cloth from Victoria's eyes. Terror flooded those bloodshot orbs as recognition set in.

A humorless laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. "What's this? Fear? Where was this fear when you set fire to my home?"

Victoria shook her head violently, tears streaming down her bruised face.

With deliberate slowness, Evelyn removed the gag.

"E-Evelyn, please," Victoria rasped, her voice raw. "I beg you—"

Another cold laugh cut her off. "Beg? You set fire to a building with people inside! You wanted me dead!"

The flames had raged uncontrollably.

Had the fire department arrived minutes later, they'd all be ashes.

And now this woman dared beg for mercy?

Unthinkable.

"I didn't mean—I just wanted to scare you! I never intended—"

For days, Victoria had been trapped in this hellhole. Cockroaches scuttled over her legs at night. The stench of mildew and decay clung to her nostrils.

It was psychological torture worse than death.

"Scare me?" Evelyn's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Sophia is hospitalized with smoke inhalation. Harrison has second-degree burns across his back and arms—permanent scars, thanks to you."

Her fingers curled into fists. "You harmed everyone I love, and now you plead for leniency? Do you truly think yourself worthy of mercy?"

Victoria began slamming her head against the wall. "Kill me then! Just end it quickly!"

She couldn't endure another hour in this nightmare.

Blood trickled from her forehead, painting her face crimson.

Evelyn watched dispassionately, as one might observe a struggling insect.

"I won't grant you death," she finally said. "But I will ensure you suffer."

"No! Evelyn, PLEASE—"

The door slammed shut, cutting off Victoria's screams.

Moments later, a new sound slithered through the darkness.

The telltale hiss of a snake.

Victoria's worst fear.

Her bloodcurdling shrieks echoed through the chamber as the serpent approached. "NO! NO! NOOO—"

Evelyn didn't look back.
###Chapter 225 How Dare She Cross Our Princess

Victoria collapsed instantly after the terrifying encounter.

Outside the observation room, Julian let out a derisive chuckle as he watched the live feed. His lips curled in undisguised contempt. "That's just a harmless garden snake, yet she fainted from sheer terror."

Elliot adjusted his glasses with a cold smirk. "Most women fear snakes, even non-venomous ones. But this is merely day one of her punishment."

His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "We'll introduce a new serpent daily until she breaks. How dare she lay hands on our precious Evelyn? She'll wish for madness before we're through."

The chilling declaration made Julian shudder involuntarily.

"Let's proceed as planned," Julian agreed, rubbing his arms to dispel the sudden chill.

Meanwhile, Evelyn remained blissfully unaware of Victoria's torment. After entrusting the traitor to her brothers' care, she'd returned immediately to Harrison's hospital bedside.

Truth be told, Harrison's injuries weren't severe. His extended hospitalization resulted from strategic decisions by both families.

While Evelyn focused on nursing Harrison in Frenda, momentous events unfolded back in Pamore.

Julian burst into the hospital room one afternoon, waving his tablet excitedly. "Your fashion show's gone viral internationally!"

"Really?" Evelyn's eyes sparkled as she accepted the device.

"See for yourself! Major publications across three continents are raving about it. The public response is overwhelmingly positive - nearly ninety percent approval ratings."

As Julian rattled off statistics, Evelyn scrolled through glowing reviews from industry critics and fashion enthusiasts alike.

Her retro-inspired collection had indeed made an extraordinary impact.

"This is incredible! We've successfully introduced vintage aesthetics to global audiences." Her fingers trembled slightly against the screen.

Julian beamed with brotherly pride. "You've outdone yourself, Evie."

Before Evelyn could respond, her phone vibrated with an incoming call. Her expression shifted instantly upon seeing the caller ID.

"Who is it?" Julian asked curiously.

Instead of answering, Evelyn composed herself and answered. "Professor Whitaker? This is Evelyn."

The elderly professor's relieved sigh traveled clearly through the line. "Thank heavens you're alright! I heard about the fire accident."

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "I'm perfectly fine, Professor. No need for concern."

"When are you returning to Kidhna?" The professor's voice carried unusual urgency.

Evelyn frowned slightly. "Is something the matter?"

"Have you forgotten our last conversation? Your fashion show was nothing short of revolutionary - both in execution and vision." His tone grew animated. "We must discuss your future immediately."

Though Evelyn sensed hidden meaning in his words, she simply replied, "Harrison's recovering well. I'll return within days."

"Splendid! I'll await your visit." The professor's delight was palpable before the call disconnected.

As Evelyn pocketed her phone, Dominic entered with stormy countenance. Julian immediately straightened at their eldest brother's grim expression.

"What's happened?" Julian asked warily.
###Chapter 226 Dead End

Dominic's gaze locked onto Evelyn. "Evelyn, Maxwell just called."

At the mention of Maxwell's name, Evelyn instantly understood. "Is this about the fashion show incident?"

Dominic gave a grim nod. "We've identified the saboteur. He confessed to sneaking backstage with scissors and deliberately cutting the garments."

Evelyn's hands clenched into fists. "What else did he say?"

Dominic's jaw tightened. "The man's a ghost—no family, no connections. Received a million-dollar wire transfer the day before the show, but the source is untraceable."

"He's refusing to talk. Won't name whoever hired him."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, piecing together the implications. "So we've hit a wall?"

Dominic's confirming hum was answer enough.

"Whoever's targeting you is operating from the shadows. Think carefully—any new enemies lately?"

Evelyn's laugh held no humor. "The list of people who'd love to see me fail could fill a stadium."

Dominic's expression darkened. "Could this be about Nathan?"

Isabella's scheming face flashed through both their minds.

"Or the Delaneys?"

Evelyn shook her head. "With their empire crumbling, I doubt they could scrape together that kind of money now."

The logic was sound, yet Dominic's frown deepened. "Then who—"

"Dominic," Evelyn interrupted, "since he's confessed, handle this according to Kingsley protocol."

Understanding flashed in Dominic's eyes. "Provoking our family carries consequences. Consider it done."

Evelyn gave a satisfied nod.

But Dominic wasn't finished. "Evelyn, Pamore's a viper's nest. Grandfather and I can't stand you being there alone."

"Leave Kingsley Industries behind. Come home where you're protected."

Evelyn's refusal was immediate. "I made a wager with Director Hawthorne. One year to turn the company around—I won't walk away before seeing it through."

"Evelyn—" Dominic began, but she cut him off.

"I know you're worried. But a Kingsley doesn't quit. What would that say about our family's reputation?"

The argument left Dominic speechless. "Little Star," he murmured, using her childhood nickname.

"Trust me, Dominic. Just one year. If I fail, I'll return without argument."

Dominic recognized her stubborn set jaw. Compromise was his only option.

"Fine. But you're accepting the security detail I've arranged. No negotiations."

Evelyn hesitated, weighing his stormy expression. With a sigh, she relented. "Alright. If it eases your mind, I'll take the bodyguard."

She forced a teasing smile. "Though I doubt anyone at Kingsley Industries will dare cross me now."
###Chapter 227 Mockery

Dominic finally allowed Evelyn to leave Frenda after she accepted his terms. The moment she arrived in Pamore, her first stop was to see Edmund.

In a professor's office at Pamore University, Edmund was surrounded by students, analyzing Evelyn's designs from the recent fashion showcase.

"Professor Whitaker, the success of this show hinges entirely on the central piece's innovative structure," Preston Whitmore, one of Edmund's top students, pointed out.

Edmund nodded in agreement.

"Absolutely. This collection made an unprecedented impact. We've already received invitations from three major international fashion weeks."

Gasps filled the room. "Does that mean we'll get to attend Paris Fashion Week?" a wide-eyed student asked.

Edmund smiled. "It wasn't easy breaking into the global scene. Before this, international critics dismissed our work as derivative. They claimed we lacked the vision to create commercially viable designs. Now we've proven them wrong."

The group of twenty-somethings buzzed with excitement—except for one.

Garrett Winslow leaned against the window, his expression dripping with disdain.

"These designs are painfully mediocre. The so-called 'visionary' behind them clearly has no grasp of real artistry."

The room fell silent.

"Garrett," Preston said sharply, "are you insulting our entire program?"

Garrett scoffed. "Cassandra's work was ten times more sophisticated. I still don't understand why Professor Whitaker let an amateur like Evelyn Carter represent our university."

At the mention of Cassandra Winslow, Edmund's face darkened.

The other students exchanged uneasy glances. Cassandra's plagiarism scandal was still a sore subject.

"Watch your tone, Garrett. Either contribute constructively or leave."

"You're all blind if you can't see Cassandra was railroaded," Garrett shot back. "She was objectively more talented than Evelyn. This reeked of favoritism from the start."

An awkward silence descended. Edmund's jaw tightened.

Just then, the door opened.

"Professor Whitaker?"

Evelyn's arrival softened Edmund's stern expression. "Evelyn, perfect timing. We were just discussing your collection."

The students immediately brightened, flocking to her like starstruck fans.

"Ms. Carter, your structural draping technique was revolutionary!"

"Could I shadow at Kingsley Industries this summer?"

"Would you sign my sketchbook?"

Evelyn laughed, charmed by their enthusiasm. "Of course, I'd love to have you all."

Garrett watched from the sidelines, his hands balling into fists. While Cassandra rotted in jail, this fraud was being worshipped.

In his eyes, Evelyn had stolen Cassandra's spotlight through nepotism alone.

"How touching," he sneered. "Must be nice skating by on family connections. No talent required when you've got a Kingsley last name, huh?"

The room froze.

Evelyn turned slowly. "Excuse me?"

Garrett stepped forward, eyes blazing. "You heard me. People like you make a mockery of this industry. Real designers spend years honing their craft while you waltz in and steal opportunities from actual artists. Have you no shame?"

The air crackled with tension as Evelyn met his glare without flinching.
###Chapter 228 Edmund's Protégé

"Garrett, what nonsense are you spouting?" Preston's voice cut through the tension like a knife. "Ms. Carter earned the lead designer position through sheer talent. The fashion show's success proves her capabilities beyond doubt."

Garrett scoffed, his expression dripping with contempt. "Please. Any mediocre designer could've pulled that off. She's nothing special."

"Enough!" Preston stepped between them, but Garrett remained unmoved. "Evelyn, admit it - you used connections to get this position, didn't you?"

Evelyn's face remained impassive. She studied Garrett carefully, searching her memory for any prior encounter that might explain his hostility.

One thing needed clarification.

"I won this position fairly through merit alone. No backdoor deals. No favors." Her voice carried quiet conviction.

Garrett burst into mocking laughter. "Who'd believe that? Anyone here buying this act?" His gaze swept the room challengingly.

Preston moved forward. "The selection process was completely transparent. Cassandra and Ms. Carter competed under equal conditions before a panel of impartial judges. Stop making baseless accusations!"

Confusion flickered across Garrett's face. This contradicted everything Cassandra had told him.

Just then, Edmund's commanding voice silenced the room. "Garrett! Regardless of today's events, one fact remains undeniable - Evelyn's designs speak for themselves."

All eyes turned to the renowned professor as he continued.

"Since everyone's gathered, I'll share what I've been contemplating." His gaze settled on Evelyn. "Even before the show, I hinted at this possibility. Today, I want to make it official."

He took a measured breath. "I'm nearing retirement and have been searching for someone worthy to inherit my knowledge and techniques. Evelyn, would you do me the honor of becoming my protégé?"

The office plunged into stunned silence.

Being Edmund Whitaker's chosen successor was the dream of every designer in the industry. Many had spent years vying for this very opportunity.

Yet he'd offered it to Evelyn after mere months.

The significance wasn't lost on anyone present.

Evelyn stood frozen for several heartbeats before finding her voice. "Professor Whitaker... are you serious?"

Edmund chuckled. "The question is - are you?"

Before Evelyn could respond, Preston interjected. "Say yes, Ms. Carter! Professor Whitaker hasn't taken a student in over a decade."

"Exactly!" another colleague added. "This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity most of us would kill for."

"Your talent is undeniable. We'd all be proud to call you Professor Whitaker's successor!"

Garrett's face twisted in disgust at the chorus of praise. With a derisive snort, he stormed out.

Under the expectant gazes of her peers, Evelyn finally nodded. "Yes. It would be my greatest privilege to learn from you, Professor Whitaker."

The room erupted in cheers. Even Edmund's usually stern expression softened with satisfaction.

"Wonderful!" Preston clapped his hands together. "Shall we make the official announcement today?"

Edmund turned to Evelyn. "What do you think, my dear?"
###Chapter 229 You're Safe Now

Evelyn's lips curved into a radiant smile. "The honor is mine, Professor Whitaker. Your word is my command."

The room buzzed with activity as everyone assisted with the arrangements. Moments later, a staff member handed Evelyn a microphone.

She accepted it gracefully and approached the podium. After a respectful bow, she declared, "Effective immediately, I formally resign as Professor Whitaker's student. Henceforth, I shall address him simply as Mr. Whitaker."

Edmund's eyes twinkled as he produced a small velvet box from his jacket pocket. "For you, Evelyn."

"Thank you, Mr. Whitaker," she replied, accepting the gift with both hands.

The announcement sent Edmund into such delight that he immediately began texting every industry contact in his phone. It was as if he wanted the entire fashion world to know about his protégé's achievement.

As Evelyn exited Kingsley University, she noticed a familiar tall silhouette leaning against a lamppost.

Before she could approach, Adrian spotted her and closed the distance in long strides. "Evelyn! You're safe."

Her eyebrows lifted in surprise. "Adrian? What brings you here?"

His gaze swept over her with visible concern. "I heard about the fire. Are you hurt? Is everything alright?"

"Perfectly fine," she assured him with a dismissive wave.

The tension visibly drained from Adrian's shoulders.

He'd been conducting business in Dunhill for weeks, completely cut off from Kingsley news. The fire reports had reached him only yesterday, prompting his immediate return.

Seeing Evelyn unharmed finally eased the knot in his stomach.

"Just arrived?" She gestured to the luggage at his feet.

Instead of answering, Adrian proudly produced a thick folder from his briefcase. "Look at these contracts. All sealed this month."

Evelyn's eyes widened at the impressive stack. "This many?"

His chest puffed with pride. "One month's work in Dunhill. What do you think, Evelyn? Am I outperforming Nathan Sterling yet?"

She gave him an approving thumbs-up. "Adrian, you're proving to be my most valuable player."

His grin turned wolfish. "If that's the case, perhaps you'll reconsider my other proposal? I excel at more than just business deals."

Evelyn playfully swatted his arm. "Enough boasting. Let's head to the office."

Chuckling, Adrian slid into Evelyn's sports car and they drove off together.

At Kingsley Industries, employees stood straighter as Evelyn passed through the lobby.

"Good afternoon, Ms. Carter."

"Welcome back, Ms. Carter."

She acknowledged each greeting with a nod before entering the elevator with Adrian.

The moment the doors closed, receptionists huddled together.

"Is that Adrian Prescott with Ms. Carter? There's definitely something between them."

"Don't you know? He's been pursuing her relentlessly."

"But wasn't Ms. Carter married before?"

"Not just married. Her ex-husband is Nathan Sterling - CEO of Sterling Enterprises!"

"Mr. Sterling? Wasn't he just in the lobby?"

Their whispers died as they glanced toward the seating area. There sat Nathan, immaculate in a three-piece suit, watching the elevator doors close.

Gasps rippled through the group.

"Why is Mr. Sterling here?"

"He's been coming daily. Rumor says he's waiting for Ms. Carter."

"A love triangle? Now that's corporate drama worth watching!"
###Chapter 230 Veiled Pleasantries

The whispers carried through the marble lobby like a spreading wildfire.

"Two powerful men fighting over one woman? Remember Harrison Whitmore who used to be so close with Evelyn Carter? Rumor has it Mr. Whitmore has become Mrs. Carter's new golden boy now."

"Oh darling, this is better than daytime television!"

Before the gossip could escalate further, Nathan Sterling rose from the plush leather couch, his shadow Simon following closely behind.

"Mr. Sterling, just idle chatter. Pay it no mind."

Nathan remained silent.

His stormy gaze could freeze hell itself, the temperature around him dropping several degrees.

They moved toward the elevators - one leading, the other following like a loyal hound.

"Adrian, the Dunhill market shows tremendous promise. I'm considering making it our primary focus for the next three years."

"Solid strategy. If we dominate Dunhill, our profit margins could triple."

"Adrian, you have my word on this. I won't let you down... Crude oil is the future..."

Their conversation flowed smoothly as they exited the elevator.

Until it didn't.

"Well look who's back in the lion's den. Mrs. Carter!"

Adrian's words died mid-sentence as an unexpected voice interrupted.

Evelyn turned to see a familiar figure. Her lips curled into a knowing smile as she approached.

"Director Hawthorne, what a surprise! Fancy seeing you here."

"I heard about your... unfortunate incident. Came to check if you're still in one piece. Everything intact?"

Classic.

A greeting laced with poison.

Evelyn's smile didn't waver. "How thoughtful of you, Director. Just a scratch really."

Julian Hawthorne nodded with practiced paternal concern.

"Excellent. Mrs. Carter, your fashion show was quite the success, brought significant..."

He continued smoothly, "But the quarterly reports are in, and we're nowhere near the promised thirty percent growth. You'll need to work harder, Mrs. Carter."

Evelyn lifted her chin, meeting his gaze without flinching. "One quarter doesn't make a year, Director. Our deadline hasn't passed. Anything could happen before..."

"Of course, Mrs. Carter! Merely a friendly reminder."

Julian's laugh rang hollow as he made to leave.

Evelyn stopped him cold. "Director Hawthorne, when did you develop such passion for fashion design?"

His smile froze mid-step. A flicker of unease crossed his features before he schooled them back into neutrality. "I take interest in all company ventures. Fashion is simply one aspect."

Evelyn's eyes narrowed to slits. His answer satisfied her about as much as a glass of warm champagne.

She'd reviewed the security footage from the show. Imagine her surprise spotting Julian among the audience.

She didn't believe in coincidences.

"How... diligent of you, Director."

The barb in her words was unmistakable, but Julian pretended not to notice.

His retreat looked suspiciously like a rout. As the elevator doors opened, Julian hurried inside - only to collide headfirst with Nathan Sterling emerging from it.

"Mr. Sterling?"
###Chapter 231 No One Can Hold Me Back

Nathan's piercing gaze flickered with surprise as Adrian came into view. "Mr. Prescott, what brings you to Kingsley Industries?"

Adrian met Nathan's stare head-on, his aristocratic bearing radiating authority. A single glance was all it took to establish dominance.

"Is there a problem? Am I unwelcome at Kingsley?"

Julian forced a tight-lipped smile. "Mr. Sterling, of course not... It's just that Ms. Carter isn't available to see you right now—"

His words trailed off deliberately, laced with unspoken implications.

The shrewd businessman hadn't missed Nathan's underlying intentions.

Nathan didn't break eye contact. Instead, his gaze shifted to Evelyn and Adrian. "Whether she's available or not isn't your decision to make, is it?"

Julian shifted uncomfortably, offering an apologetic shrug. "You're absolutely right, Mr. Sterling."

But Nathan had already dismissed him.

Leaving Julian standing awkwardly, he strode toward Evelyn.

Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly at Nathan's approach.

Even when he called her name, she pretended not to hear, turning instead to open her office door.

Simon cleared his throat uncomfortably. "Mr. Sterling, I'll wait outside," he murmured before making a discreet exit.

As Nathan reached the threshold, Adrian blocked his path.

The former friends locked eyes in a charged standoff.

"Nathan, why are you here?" Adrian spoke first.

A cold smirk played on Nathan's lips. "Trying to stop me, Adrian?"

Adrian held his ground. "She doesn't want to see you. Leave."

Nathan's eyes narrowed dangerously. His pride made him tilt his chin up defiantly. "Do you really think you can stop me?"

Adrian remained immovable. "Even if I can't, I won't let you through—"

The tension between them crackled like live wires.

Nathan let out a humorless laugh. "I never imagined we'd become strangers like this."

Adrian's expression didn't waver. "Nathan, you're divorced. Why keep pursuing her?"

A shadow crossed Nathan's face. "Who said I'm here to pursue her?"

Adrian's eyebrows shot up. "Then why are you here?"

Nathan's voice turned icy. "There's something you should know. Even if she doesn't end up with me, it certainly won't be you."

Adrian's face darkened. "Shut up," he snapped.

Nathan remained unfazed. "Just stating facts."

Adrian's fists clenched, but he restrained himself. "It doesn't matter if it's not me. As long as she's happy—even if that happiness doesn't come from me—"

His words sent an unexpected tremor through Evelyn. She'd never realized the depth of Adrian's feelings.

It left her speechless.

She couldn't respond. Couldn't bear the weight of such devotion.

"Let him in," she finally said.

Adrian turned sharply. "Evelyn—"

But she continued in a businesslike tone, "Mr. Sterling, state your business or leave."

Reluctantly, Adrian stepped aside.

Nathan's intense gaze burned into Evelyn as if trying to see through her defenses.

Evelyn frowned under his scrutiny. "Mr. Sterling, what do you want?"

Nathan's lips pressed into a thin line. "Are you alright?" The concern in his voice was unmistakable—he'd heard about the fire.
###Chapter 232 Unshaken Confidence

He was aware of her injuries. The moment he'd heard, he'd flown straight to Frenda after her.

Yet the Kingsleys had concealed her too effectively.

Ten agonizing days in that city yielded nothing.

Returning to Pamore empty-handed, he'd stationed himself at Kingsley Industries, waiting.

Evelyn masked every emotion. "Mr. Sterling," she said coolly, "is this your version of concern? I don't require it."

"Seeing you unharmed brings me relief," Nathan replied.

A beat passed before he continued, "The nanotech collaboration with Victor Langley has reached its pivotal phase. The product launch is scheduled next month."

Work. Always work with him.

This time, Evelyn didn't refuse. It was her project, after all. "I'll adjust my calendar accordingly."

Truthfully, Nathan had overheard Evelyn's exchange with Julian Hawthorne earlier. The unspoken plea in her tone hadn't escaped him.

"Ms. Carter," he pressed on, "Sterling Enterprises is initiating several ventures. Should you wish to continue our professional association—"

"Unnecessary, Mr. Sterling." Her refusal came swift as a blade.

Nathan's lips curved in self-deprecation, shadows veiling his eyes. "Because you want no connection to me? I thought you championed separating business from personal matters."

His words failed to provoke even a ripple in her composure.

"Your confidence remains... impressive," Evelyn countered. "However, Kingsley Industries has secured Horizon Technologies as our new partner. Excessive entanglement with Sterling Enterprises would be... unwise."

Brutal honesty.

Nathan scoffed. "Horizon? A fledgling company barely finding its footing, yet rushing headlong into projects?"

"Must you always disparage others' choices?" Evelyn shot back.

His expression darkened. "Is that truly how you perceive me, Evelyn?"

Her name on his lips carried an ache she refused to acknowledge.

"Isn't it the truth?" she challenged.

Suddenly, Nathan regretted coming. Yet the need to see her had overridden all reason.

Softening his tone, he tried another approach. "Grandmother's birthday is this Saturday. She's asked after you repeatedly."

Margaret Winslow—the sole Sterling who'd ever shown Evelyn genuine warmth.

Since the divorce, they hadn't met.

The memory of Margaret's kindness thawed Evelyn's resolve. "I'll visit her. But nothing more needs discussing, Mr. Sterling."

Nathan ignored the latter part. This small concession was enough. "I'll expect you at Sterling Manor then."

He turned abruptly, not waiting for confirmation—as if fearing she'd rescind the agreement.

His decision was made.

This time, he'd place his hopes on Margaret.

After Nathan's departure, Evelyn sat motionless, lost in thought.

Adrian Prescott approached, rapping his knuckles against her desk. "Still dwelling on Nathan, Evelyn?"
###Chapter 233 When Love Fades, Friendship Remains

Evelyn blinked, her expression clouded with confusion. "Excuse me?"

Adrian had caught the peculiar tension between Evelyn and Nathan. His voice carried a tinge of resignation as he spoke.

"If you want to return to him, I won't stand in your way."

Evelyn let out a soft laugh. "What's gotten into you? Since when did you become so defeatist?"

Adrian shrugged, his lips quirking into a wry smile. "If I have to lose to Nathan Sterling, that's not exactly shameful."

His expression turned serious. "But Evelyn, you should consider carefully. The past issues still exist. If you two reconcile, those problems need addressing first."

Evelyn's eyes flashed. "Who said anything about reconciliation?"

Adrian's gaze sharpened as he studied her face.

"Evelyn, are you saying—"

She shook her head slowly. "I have no intention of getting back with him. Not now. Maybe never."

Adrian's breath hitched. "Does that mean... I still have a chance?"

Evelyn met his hopeful stare directly.

It was time to set things straight.

"Adrian, are you absolutely certain I'm your destined choice in this life?"

"Without question," he answered instantly. "You're the only woman I want. I was a fool before. Had I known you were my arranged marriage match, I would've never objected. I just want another opportunity."

Evelyn lowered her lashes.

She hadn't anticipated such stubborn devotion. She'd assumed his feelings were fleeting - a passing infatuation.

Now she found herself unable to give him what he sought.

The only solution was complete detachment.

"Adrian, resign from Kingsley Industries. With your capabilities, you're wasted here. You deserve better prospects. Even returning to Prescott Enterprises would be preferable."

Understanding dawned in Adrian's eyes. "Evelyn, are you trying to—"

"It's not personal. Kingsley simply can't provide the platform your talents require."

Adrian remained unfazed. "I don't care about that. Being near you is enough."

"Adrian!" Her voice turned firm. "I'll approve your resignation. This isn't negotiable."

Silence descended upon the office.

Neither spoke for what felt like an eternity.

Finally, Adrian broke the stillness. "If this is truly what you want, I'll comply. But understand this - my feelings won't vanish simply because—"

"If possible, I'd gladly bind myself to you through that arranged marriage. Even if it meant having just a fragment of your life, I'd accept it willingly."

His gaze swept the room, always returning to her.

"Evelyn, if we can't be lovers, let's remain friends. We've known each other since childhood, after all."

After a beat, Evelyn nodded. "Fine."

She didn't realize Adrian was maneuvering the situation.

"All romantic relationships begin as friendships. Evelyn, even if I leave Kingsley and return to Prescott Enterprises, my heart remains with you. Do you understand?"

He continued, "I won't resign immediately. I'll see the Whitmore project through to completion first. But my ultimate goal remains your happiness."

"Adrian—" Evelyn began, but he cut her off with a resigned smile.

"What? Having second thoughts about letting me go already?"
###Chapter 234 Margaret's Birthday Celebration

"Don't sell yourself short. I truly believe happiness will find you," Evelyn spoke with genuine warmth in her voice.

Adrian appeared thoughtful as he gave a firm nod. Though silent, the determination in his piercing gaze spoke volumes about his resolve.

The following week kept Evelyn occupied as she tackled the mountain of work that had piled up during her involvement with the fashion event. When Saturday dawned, she finally had a moment to breathe.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming call just as the morning light painted her bedroom walls gold.

"Evelyn darling, will you be joining us at Sterling Manor today?" Margaret's voice carried unmistakable hope through the receiver.

Evelyn hesitated briefly before responding. "Of course, Grandma. I wouldn't miss your special day for anything."

Margaret's delighted laughter filled the line. "Wonderful! I'll be counting the minutes until you arrive."

As she ended the call, Evelyn turned toward the window where sunlight streamed through in golden ribbons. The perfect weather seemed tailor-made for celebrations.

Retrieving the exquisite emerald set she'd acquired at last month's auction, Evelyn summoned her housekeeper.

"Marjorie, could you prepare an appropriate gift box for these?"

"Right away, madam." Marjorie's skilled hands made quick work of the elegant packaging.

"You have quite the talent for presentation," Evelyn remarked appreciatively.

"If I may ask, where will you be heading today?" Marjorie inquired politely.

"Sterling Manor," Evelyn replied simply, offering no further explanation that wasn't required.

Later, she selected a sleek white Maserati from the garage and began the drive to the Sterling family estate.

The manor buzzed with celebratory energy when she arrived. The Sterlings always spared no expense for Margaret's birthday, evidenced by the parade of luxury vehicles lining the circular driveway.

Guests mingled in the grand hall, presenting their gifts and offering well-wishes to the guest of honor. Yet Margaret's attention kept drifting toward the entrance, as if anticipating someone's arrival.

"Mother, Geraldine has prepared something special for you today," Gwendolyn announced, steering her daughter Rosalind forward.

"Happy birthday, Grandmother." Rosalind presented her gift with practiced grace.

Margaret offered a polite smile. "How thoughtful of you, dear."

But Gwendolyn wasn't finished. Linking arms with Margaret, she pressed on. "Since we're all together, we should discuss Rosalind's future. At twenty-five, she really should be considering marriage prospects—"

"Mother!" Rosalind's cheeks flushed with embarrassment.

Gwendolyn remained undeterred, producing a folder from her designer handbag. "I've taken the liberty of compiling dossiers on several eligible—"

Eleanor chose that moment to intervene. "Must we really turn Mother's birthday into a matchmaking event?" The tension between the sisters-in-law crackled in the air.

Though Eleanor was Nathan's stepmother, her position in the family remained unshakable—she'd given birth to the Sterling heir, after all.
###Chapter 235 Stop Addressing Me Like That

Having a son as accomplished as Nathan Sterling, Eleanor Blackwell couldn't help but feel overshadowed by Rosalind. Meanwhile, Eleanor's entire existence seemed to revolve around Rosalind's whims.

The comment struck a nerve. Rosalind's face darkened instantly, as if someone had plunged a dagger into her heart.

"Well, Vanessa is only staying in Astana temporarily. She'll return eventually," Rosalind muttered defensively before retreating.

Eleanor smirked in triumph before turning her attention to Margaret Winslow.

"Mother, look at this. Harrison Whitmore, CEO of Horizon Technologies. Exceptionally handsome and brilliant. He completely transformed the company's fortunes within months. What an eligible bachelor—"

Margaret frowned and cut her off sharply. "That's enough for now."

Pouting, Eleanor reluctantly conceded. "Very well, Mother."

She then shifted her focus to Rosalind. "Rosalind darling, you must see this! Harrison seems exactly your type."

Rosalind showed zero interest. Her gaze remained fixed on the grand entrance. When Nathan appeared, her dull eyes immediately sparkled with life.

"Mother, excuse me for a moment," she announced before gliding toward Nathan.

"Nathan!"

Spotting Rosalind's approach, Nathan greeted politely, "Ms. Blackwell, what a pleasure."

Though only two months his senior, Rosalind bristled at the formal address.

She playfully scolded, "How many times must I tell you? Drop the 'Ms.' It makes me sound ancient."

Gregory Hammond chuckled nervously. "Ms. Blackwell—I mean Rosalind—you're the picture of youth."

Rosalind shot him a withering glare. "I said don't call me that!"

Gregory recoiled. "Right, right. But we can't simply call you Rosalind, can we?"

Her expression softened slightly as she turned back to Nathan. "Nathan, is it true about your divorce?"

Nathan's eyes darkened, his smile fading. Those who knew him recognized this as dangerous territory.

Gregory hastily intervened. "Rosalind, perhaps this isn't—"

Undeterred, Rosalind continued, "That woman Evelyn was never worthy of you. The divorce was for the best."

Gregory tried again. "Rosalind! Let's not—"

He watched Nathan's expression carefully.

Noticing Nathan's displeasure, Rosalind pouted. "Still pining for her, Nathan?"

Nathan ignored the comment. "Rosalind, today celebrates Grandmother's birthday. Let's focus on her, not my personal affairs."

With that, Nathan turned to leave, Gregory scrambling after him.

Frustration boiled within Rosalind.

She'd only spoken the truth! Evelyn Carter had never been his equal!

At the entrance, Gregory caught up with Nathan, teasing, "What's this? Upset because someone criticized your precious Evelyn?"

Nathan responded with an icy snort, gazing into the distance. He chose silence.
###Chapter 236 Overreacting

Frederick couldn't resist pushing further. "When they were giving Evelyn such a hard time, why didn't it bother you?"

"Now that I've merely made a few comments, why are you reacting so strongly? Nathan, don't you think you're overreacting just a bit?"

Nathan responded with icy calm. "Feeling particularly talkative today, Gregory?"

Gregory only grew more intrigued by his evasive answer. He slung an arm around his shoulder. "Brother, aren't you waiting for someone?"

The "someone" in Gregory's words could only mean Evelyn.

A faint twitch appeared at the corner of Nathan's mouth. "Don't you have anything better to do?"

Gregory quickly denied, "Not at all. Just... curious."

"Let me give you some advice - now that you've realized your feelings and want Evelyn back, you need to make up for past mistakes with genuine sincerity. Own up to them like a man! Take responsibility and make things right! In simpler terms, just treat her better," he continued.

Nathan remained unmoved. "Didn't need your input on that."

As they spoke, a sleek white Maserati came into view. Gregory let out an amused whistle. "Well well, looks like your guest of honor has arrived."

Evelyn parked perfectly in the designated spot, grabbed her gift, and stepped out gracefully.

Most attendees today were close relatives of the Sterling family.

They were all too aware of the gossip surrounding Evelyn and Nathan, especially their very public divorce.

Whispers broke out immediately, unable to hide their shock.

"What's she doing here?"

"I thought they were divorced? Could they have reconciled?"

"She's the Kingsley heiress - her status and background far surpass the Sterlings. Marrying her would be considered a coup for their family."

Evelyn kept her gaze forward, ignoring the murmurs around her.

She moved with effortless elegance in a flowing sapphire gown that hugged her slender frame, her steps confident in designer heels.

Nathan stepped forward to greet her. "You came."

Evelyn gave a slight nod in acknowledgment. "Where's Margaret?"

"Inside. I'll take you to her," Nathan offered.

Gregory barely suppressed his grin as he waved at Evelyn. "Long time no see. Heard you've become old man Whitaker's protégé - practically family now."

Evelyn offered a polite but distant smile, declining Nathan's escort as she entered alone.

"Margaret!"

Upon seeing Evelyn, the elder woman brightened and took her hands. "Evelyn, my dear, you're here."

The Sterling relatives who once looked down on Evelyn with disdain now wore ingratiating smiles.

"Evelyn, you look more radiant than ever," gushed Beatrice Harrington, Nathan's aunt who had once joined Eleanor in tormenting Evelyn. Now her tone dripped with false sweetness.

"I heard your grandfather is Leonard Kingsley. I'd love the opportunity to meet him sometime," Beatrice added shamelessly.
###Chapter 237 How Shameless Can You Be

"I heard you're the new CEO of Kingsley Industries. That's quite remarkable. Your uncle's company had massive layoffs recently, leaving him unemployed. Perhaps you could—"

Evelyn remained silent, her expression unreadable.

But Beatrice saw nothing inappropriate about her request. "Your uncle was only a department manager before. Surely finding him a position at Kingsley Industries wouldn't be difficult for someone in your position."

Margaret overheard the exchange and frowned at her daughter's audacity.

Undeterred by the growing tension, Beatrice pressed on. "We're family after all. Surely you can pull some strings to get him a decent position?"

Evelyn's response was cutting. "What nonsense are you speaking? He's still part of the Sterling family. With Sterling Enterprises' resources, finding employment shouldn't be an issue. Our family business may be modest, but we can certainly accommodate such... talent."

Her words struck like a whip.

Beatrice's face darkened immediately. Evelyn had hit a raw nerve—the implication that she was limited by her husband's failures within Sterling Enterprises.

"Evelyn, must you be so difficult? It was a simple favor. No wonder Nathan left you," Beatrice snapped back.

"That's enough, Beatrice! Hold your tongue before you embarrass yourself further," Margaret reprimanded sharply. Clearly, she'd been too lenient with her daughter.

"But Mother! I was merely asking for family assistance," Beatrice protested bitterly.

"Have you no shame?" Margaret's icy tone silenced Beatrice, who stormed away in frustration.

Realizing the scene her daughter had caused, Margaret turned to Evelyn with an apologetic smile. "Pay no mind to her foolishness."

Evelyn shook her head. "It's nothing, Grandmother." To her, Beatrice's words were like the yapping of an insignificant dog—unworthy of attention.

"Grandmother, I brought you a gift. May it bring you health and happiness."

As Evelyn presented the gift, Nathan intercepted it, revealing an exquisite emerald necklace.

"Your taste has improved," he remarked, examining the jewelry.

"Marginally better than before," Evelyn replied, her words laced with double meaning.

Margaret intervened gracefully. "Your presence is gift enough, Evelyn."

"Please accept it, Grandmother. It's the least I can do after your kindness during my three years here."

Margaret nodded and clasped Evelyn's hand warmly. "You've always been thoughtful."

Meanwhile, Beatrice seethed nearby. As a senior family member, she deserved respect, yet Evelyn had publicly humiliated her. The rejection burned, but given Evelyn's current status, Beatrice could only fume impotently.

Rosalind appeared silently at her side.

"Must you hover? I want to be alone!" Beatrice snapped.

Unfazed, Rosalind turned her gaze toward the lively gathering in the hall's center where Evelyn stood surrounded by admirers.

The contrast to Evelyn's former status in the Sterling household was stark. In the past, no one would have acknowledged her as Nathan's wife.
###Chapter 238 Sowing Discord

Evelyn Carter's newfound status had everyone clamoring to get on her good side. The Sterling Manor buzzed with social climbers vying for her attention.

This didn't sit well with Beatrice Harrington.

"Aunt Beatrice, do you know why Vanessa was sent to Astana?" Rosalind Blackwell asked casually.

Since her marriage, Beatrice had distanced herself from Sterling family affairs. Eleanor had only mentioned Vanessa was studying abroad.

But Astana? Even with the Sterlings' declining fortunes, they wouldn't exile their daughter there without reason.

Beatrice frowned. "What exactly happened?"

Rosalind's gaze drifted toward Evelyn across the crowded room.

"Because of her, obviously."

"You mean Evelyn? She has that much influence now?"

Rosalind gave Beatrice a pitying look.

"Have you forgotten how Vanessa and Aunt Eleanor treated her? This is just karma catching up with them."

"Now that she's powerful, she made sure Vanessa got what she deserved. I heard Nathan confirmed she might never return."

Beatrice's pulse quickened. "She holds grudges that deeply?"

Memories surfaced of her own cruel taunts toward Evelyn. If the younger woman sought revenge...

"Aunt Beatrice, it's not just Vanessa. Even Aunt Eleanor couldn't escape her wrath."

"What? Eleanor was her mother-in-law! How dare she? That's outrageous!"

Seeing Beatrice's agitation, Rosalind pressed further.

"They're divorced now. That makes Eleanor nothing to her. And considering your situation..."

Beatrice felt ice in her veins. Married to a middle-class businessman, she'd be defenseless against Evelyn's retaliation.

Desperate, she turned to Rosalind. "You've always been clever. Should I apologize? Would she forgive me?"

As Beatrice moved to approach Evelyn, Rosalind grabbed her arm.

"Too late for that. She could have helped Uncle's business anytime. She didn't because she scorns your family."

Beatrice's face darkened as she glared at Evelyn. "That ungrateful wretch."

"If you grovel now, she'll only humiliate you further."

"Then what should I do?"

Rosalind's lips curved. "Simple. If she won't show mercy, why should we? Want to teach her a lesson?"

Leaning close, Rosalind whispered her plan.

Beatrice's eyes lit with malicious glee. "Brilliant! As her elder, I won't let her walk over us."

Meanwhile, across the ballroom, guests swarmed around Evelyn, eager to curry favor with the rising Kingsley heiress. Their sycophantic laughter carried through the opulent hall.
###Chapter 239 The Fickle Crowd

In a heartbeat, Evelyn found herself at the center of attention, surrounded by eager faces vying for her favor.

Margaret observed the scene with quiet satisfaction. But from her shadowed corner of the grand hall, Eleanor Blackwell seethed with barely contained frustration.

These social butterflies always followed the wind's direction.

When Eleanor had been the darling of high society, they'd flocked to her like bees to honey. Now that Evelyn shone brightest, they scrambled to realign their loyalties.

The thought made Eleanor's stomach churn. While Vanessa suffered in obscurity, Evelyn basked in the spotlight. The injustice burned like acid in her throat.

"Mother," Eleanor hissed through clenched teeth, "why invite that outsider to our home?"

Margaret's eyes turned glacial. "Evelyn is my honored guest, Eleanor. Mind your place. If you've nothing better to do, the kitchen staff could use supervision."

Defeated, Eleanor stalked toward the servants' quarters.

At that moment, Margaret pressed a hand to her chest, her breath catching. The familiar ache of her chronic condition flared without warning.

She rose gracefully and ascended the grand staircase, seeking solitude on the upper floor.

"Evelyn!" Rosalind Blackwell's voice cut through the crowd as she approached.

Evelyn had always found Rosalind more tolerable than the other Sterling relatives - less venomous, more measured in her dealings.

"Rosalind!" Evelyn greeted warmly.

Rosalind's smile didn't reach her eyes. "My, how you've transformed since we last met. Quite the social butterfly now."

Evelyn laughed lightly. "And you've only grown more radiant, dear cousin."

A shadow crossed Rosalind's face. "I noticed Grandmother looked unwell earlier. Her chest pains seem to be troubling her again."

Evelyn's smile faltered. "Is she alright?"

Rosalind scanned the room with calculated nonchalance. "Strange... she's been gone quite some time now."

Concern tightened Evelyn's chest as her gaze swept the crowded hall. Margaret's absence among the glittering guests sent a prickle of unease down her spine.

If Evelyn chose to retaliate against Beatrice Harrington now, it would be child's play - like stepping on an insignificant insect.

Desperation colored Beatrice's voice as she turned to Rosalind. "I changed your diapers, girl. What do I do now? Should I grovel at her feet and beg forgiveness?"

She made to move toward Evelyn, but Rosalind's hand shot out, restraining her.

"Pointless, Aunt Beatrice. You're beneath her notice now. She could have secured Uncle's position with a word if she cared. Her silence speaks volumes."

Rosalind's barb hit its mark. Beatrice's face flushed crimson as she glared at Evelyn. "That conniving little-"

"Precisely," Rosalind purred. "Apologizing would only give her the satisfaction of rejecting you."

"Then what?" Beatrice demanded, wringing her hands.

Rosalind's lips curved into a viper's smile. "Simple mathematics, dear aunt. If she shows no mercy... why should we?" She leaned closer, her whisper a venomous caress. "Shall we remind her of her place?"

Beatrice's eyes lit with malicious understanding. "First strike advantage. As her elder, I'd be remiss not to... educate her properly."

Meanwhile, the cream of society continued their dance around Evelyn, drawn like moths to the flame of her newfound status and connections to the powerful Kingsley family. Their laughter rang hollow, their compliments transparent in their ambition.

The crowd surged around Evelyn like a tidal wave. All eyes were fixed on her radiant presence.

Margaret watched with quiet satisfaction from her vantage point. But in the shadowed corner of the grand hall, Eleanor Blackwell's fingers tightened around her champagne flute.

These social butterflies always followed the prevailing winds.

When fortune had smiled upon Eleanor, they'd flocked to her side. Now that Evelyn shone brightest, they scrambled to realign their allegiances.

The thought made Eleanor's stomach churn. Vanessa Sterling was suffering in Astana while Evelyn basked in glory. The injustice burned like acid in her throat.

"Mother, she's no longer family. Why invite her at all?" Eleanor hissed through clenched teeth.

Margaret's eyes turned frosty. "Evelyn is my honored guest. You overstep, daughter. If you've nothing better to do, the kitchen staff could use supervision. Make yourself useful."

Defeated, Eleanor stalked toward the servants' quarters.

At that moment, Margaret pressed a hand to her chest as a familiar pain flared beneath her ribs. The old affliction was returning.

She rose gracefully and ascended the grand staircase.

"Evelyn!" Rosalind Blackwell's voice cut through the murmuring crowd.

Evelyn brightened at the sight of Nathan's cousin. Unlike the other Sterling vipers, Rosalind had always shown her kindness.

"Rosalind! You look stunning."

The blonde woman laughed. "Look who's talking! You've transformed since I last saw you."

Evelyn's smile turned playful. "Flattery will get you everywhere."

Rosalind's expression sobered. "I noticed Grandmother seemed unwell earlier. That chest pain of hers..."

Concern flashed across Evelyn's features. "Is she alright?"

Rosalind scanned the room. "Odd. She's been gone quite a while now."

Evelyn's gaze darted across the sea of faces. When she didn't spot Margaret among the guests, she made her decision.

"Excuse me for a moment."

She moved swiftly toward the staircase. Three years in Sterling Manor had made her intimately familiar with its layout. Reaching Margaret's suite, she called softly, "Margaret? Are you there?"

Silence answered her. As she turned to leave, a housekeeper appeared.

"Madam Carter." The woman bowed.

"Just Ms. Carter, please." Evelyn corrected gently.

"Of course, Ms. Carter."

"Have you seen Mrs. Winslow?"

The servant gestured down the hall. "The elder Mrs. Sterling went that way, toward the end room."

Evelyn thanked her and approached the indicated door. But after three steps, she froze. Recognition dawned like icy water down her spine.

This was the forbidden chamber.

On her very first day at Sterling Manor, Margaret had made one rule abundantly clear: every room was open to her except this one.

"Margaret?" Evelyn called hesitantly, refusing to cross the invisible boundary.

When no answer came, she turned to leave.

Then—the faintest creak of hinges.

The door had cracked open of its own accord.

Heart pounding, Evelyn reached out. Her fingers brushed the aged wood. It swung inward with eerie smoothness.

Dust motes danced in slanted sunlight, illuminating antique furnishings frozen in time. The air smelled of lavender and something darker, more metallic.

Evelyn took two cautious steps inside.

Then she saw it.

Her breath caught. Her blood turned to ice.

The revelation struck like lightning, rooting her to the spot.
###Chapter 240 The Paint Incident

"What do you think you're doing?"

Nathan's voice cut through the air like a whip, sharp with barely contained fury.

In three quick strides, he crossed the room and seized Evelyn's wrist with unexpected force.

Before she could protest, he was already dragging her out of the mysterious chamber.

"Explain this to me," Evelyn demanded, her wide eyes searching his face for answers.

Nathan's jaw tightened. "Whatever you saw in there, forget it immediately."

A chill ran down Evelyn's spine. The room had felt... wrong somehow.

"This makes no sense," she whispered, images from the chamber flashing through her mind.

Her gaze locked onto Nathan's. "Why was there a memorial portrait of you in there? Are you...?"

"Don't be ridiculous," Nathan snapped, his grip tightening unconsciously.

"Then explain it to me!" Evelyn twisted her wrist free from his grasp.

Nathan exhaled sharply. "The party's starting. We should return downstairs."

Evelyn hesitated. Maybe she was imagining things. The living, breathing man before her seemed very much alive.

"What about Margaret? Is she alright?"

Nathan frowned. "What?"

"I heard she wasn't feeling well. That's why I came up here."

His eyes narrowed suspiciously. "She's fine. But don't come back here again."

Evelyn nodded silently, her mind racing.

As they descended the grand staircase, disaster struck without warning.

"Look out!" Nathan's reflexes kicked in as he yanked Evelyn sideways.

A heavy paint bucket crashed onto the steps where she'd been standing, splattering Nathan instead in a rainbow of colors.

The entire ballroom froze.

Gasps echoed through the crowd as everyone turned to stare at the dripping CEO.

Evelyn's hands flew to her mouth. "Nathan! Are you hurt?"

The commotion drew immediate attention.

Rosalind pushed through the crowd first. "Nathan! What happened?" Her eyes darted between him and Evelyn accusingly.

Murmurs spread like wildfire:

"How did paint get up there?"
"Who would leave a bucket on the stairs?"
"Does he need medical attention?"

Nathan flexed his shoulders, wincing slightly. "I'm fine. Just need to clean up."

His gaze found Evelyn in the crowd. "Come with me."

Evelyn blinked. "Excuse me?"

Nathan reached for her again, but she sidestepped smoothly.

While grateful for his protection, she couldn't risk fueling gossip by disappearing with him.

Rosalind stepped forward possessively. "I'll help you, Nathan." She shot Evelyn a venomous look.
###Chapter 241 If Only We Weren't Related

Nathan's response came without hesitation. "She's the only one I want."

Evelyn felt her chest tighten. "Mr. Sterling, this isn't appropriate," she declined firmly.

A storm cloud passed over Nathan's handsome features, displeasure evident in every line of his face. But with so many eyes watching, he couldn't force the issue. Rosalind eventually managed to steer him away.

The moment they left, Margaret rushed to Evelyn's side. "Are you alright, dear?"

Blinking, Evelyn shook her head. "I'm fine, Grandma. How are you feeling?"

"Just the usual aches—"

Their conversation was interrupted by Beatrice descending the stairs, dragging a paint-splattered boy by the ear. The child clutched two dripping brushes, his tear-streaked face a picture of misery as Beatrice berated him.

"You little fool! Look what you've done!"

The boy's wails echoed through the grand hall.

Margaret's expression darkened. "Enough," she snapped coldly. "You're making a spectacle."

Beatrice paled. She'd intended to humiliate Evelyn, not make Nathan the target. If he discovered her involvement...

She scrambled to apologize. "Mother, the child didn't know any better. We never expected Nathan would get paint on him. Please forgive—"

Margaret ignored her completely, taking Evelyn's arm. "Come, Evelyn."

A shadow crossed Evelyn's eyes as subtle unease prickled her skin.

Meanwhile, in the now-empty sitting room, only Rosalind remained with Nathan after the staff departed.

Unaware he wasn't alone, Nathan turned away and began unbuttoning his ruined coat. Suddenly, Rosalind rushed forward. "Nathan—"

Something dangerous flickered in her gaze.

"Rosalind, don't trouble yourself. Please leave."

Her hands froze mid-air. When she looked up, Nathan's dark eyes bored into hers. Years of suppressed emotions threatened to overflow.

"Nathan... imagine if—if we weren't cousins. Wouldn't that be perfect?"

Shock flashed across his face. Without hesitation, he shoved her away.

"You're not thinking clearly. This is nonsense."

Rosalind stepped closer, desperation coloring her voice. "I haven't touched a drop of alcohol. Just being near you intoxicates me."

"I don't know what game you're playing. If you insist on staying, I'll leave." Nathan turned on his heel and strode out without looking back.
###Chapter 242 Ashes of the Past

Evelyn Carter watched Nathan Sterling's retreating figure with a bitter smile curling her lips.

The alcohol haze had cleared completely now.

She glanced down at her trembling hands, nails digging crescent moons into her palms.

Humiliation burned through her veins like wildfire. That protective stance Nathan had taken with Evelyn downstairs—it haunted her.

Weren't they supposed to be divorced? Then why did he still move like her personal shield?

A shadow crossed Rosalind Blackwell's face as the thought took root.

When Nathan returned to the grand hall after showering, his freshly pressed suit couldn't mask his restlessness. His gaze swept the room, finding every face except the one he sought.

Margaret Winslow sighed. "She's gone, Nathan."

His head snapped up. "You let her leave?" The accusation slipped out before he could stop it.

"Tell me truthfully—what game are you playing?" Margaret's cane tapped sharply against marble. "I told you to cherish that girl, yet you chose betrayal. Now you're divorced and still acting like a lovesick fool?"

"Grandmother!" Nathan's jaw tightened.

"Did you ever clean up your messy affairs?" Margaret's voice turned glacial. "Or have you forgotten? You were the one who strayed first, got another woman pregnant—"

Nathan's expression darkened at the reminder.

Margaret rarely denied him anything, but on this matter, she showed no mercy.

"Burned bridges leave only ashes, Nathan. Remember that." Her grip tightened on the cane. "If you want Evelyn's forgiveness, prepare to spend the rest of your life making amends."

She paused, watching the pain flicker across his face. "But if she can't move past this... perhaps your story truly has reached its end."

Nathan stormed out, the banquet's laughter grating against his raw nerves.

On the balcony, smoke curled around him like ghosts of his mistakes. Cigarette after cigarette turned to ash beneath his polished shoes.

Finally, he dialed an international number. "The investigation—what did you find?"

The answer had him stubbing out his cigarette with sudden purpose. "Book my flight. I'm coming tonight."

Meanwhile, Evelyn found herself outside her boutique instead of returning to the office.

Olivia Sinclair's delighted squeal greeted her. "Evelyn! What brings you here today?"

"Just passing by." Evelyn forced a smile. "Business still good?"

"Better than ever!" Olivia twirled, showing off their new displays. Then her smile faltered. "Hey... what's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost."

Evelyn hesitated before voicing the thought that had haunted her since leaving Sterling Manor. "What would you think... if someone kept a black-and-white portrait of themselves in their home?"

Olivia blinked. "You mean like... a funeral photo? That's creepy. Who does that while they're still alive?"

Exactly Evelyn's thought.

Yet the image of that locked room at Sterling Manor refused to leave her—the solitary portrait watching over empty space. Could it really be just a coincidence?
###Chapter 243 A Powerful Boost

Olivia's voice snapped Evelyn out of her thoughts. "Speaking of which, I just remembered something important. We've got a VIP client requesting your personal design services."

"What sort of design?" Evelyn inquired.

Olivia shuffled through the client files on the marble counter before handing one over. "Three million dollar commission with an open deadline. They only want to discuss details with you directly."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow as she accepted the file.

The request was surprisingly simple - just a name and contact number printed neatly on crisp stationery.

"How unusual. Any specific design preferences mentioned?"

"None whatsoever." Olivia shrugged. "The client insisted on speaking with you personally whenever you're available. Should we accept?"

A pleased smile curved Evelyn's lips. "Absolutely. This could be our boutique's most significant commission yet."

"I'll handle the arrangements. My schedule's packed at Kingsley Industries this week, but I'll reach out when things calm down."

"Perfect. We'll proceed as you direct."

The following morning found Evelyn arriving unusually early at the corporate offices. By sheer coincidence, she crossed paths with Adrian in the lobby. Dressed in an impeccably tailored suit, he looked nothing like his usual casual self.

Yet the moment their eyes met, his professional facade cracked.

"Good morning, Ms. Carter!" Adrian greeted with unexpected warmth, his cheerful smile transforming his entire demeanor.

He quickened his pace to join her in the elevator.

"Attending the Monday meeting today?" Adrian inquired.

Evelyn gave a slight nod.

Adrian's grin widened impossibly further.

The weekly Monday meetings were Dominic's tradition, one Evelyn rarely attended. Her presence today clearly surprised him.

"Today's agenda focuses on the Dunhill project budget approval. The bid submission's tomorrow," Adrian explained enthusiastically.

Though familiar with Adrian's business acumen, Evelyn couldn't resist teasing him. "Feeling confident?"

Adrian drew himself up with visible determination. "Ms. Carter, you can count on me! The competition's manageable, and I promise - this won't disappoint you."

Evelyn's lips quirked. "So you've decided to leave us then?"

Adrian nodded solemnly. "Physically perhaps, but my heart remains with Kingsley Industries."

"Then when you secure this project, consider a celebration in your honor."

"You have my word, Ms. Carter."

"Excellent. I'll expect good news."

Evelyn's encouragement acted like rocket fuel for Adrian. His buoyant mood carried through the entire meeting.

Standing before the assembled executives, Adrian spoke with polished confidence. Every gesture, every expression commanded attention, earning nods of approval from the room.

There was no denying it - when serious, Adrian Prescott possessed undeniable charisma.

"All budget reports are finalized. After this meeting, they'll be submitted to Ms. Carter for final approval," Adrian concluded, his gaze sweeping the room before landing on Evelyn.

"Any further comments or concerns?" Evelyn addressed the group.

A unanimous murmur of agreement filled the conference room.

"No objections here. Mr. Prescott's covered every contingency within our projected range."

"We're all anticipating tomorrow's successful bid announcement."
###Chapter 244 Defiance

Adrian Prescott's proposal got the green light from every board member.

The moment the meeting adjourned, Evelyn Carter strode out first, her heels clicking decisively against the marble floor. Maxwell Donovan followed half a step behind, still briefing her on the quarterly projections.

They were just steps away from her office when a familiar voice rang out. "Evelyn!"

Rosalind Blackwell emerged from the waiting area, her designer dress swaying elegantly with each step.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her tablet. Since the divorce, she'd severed all ties with the Sterling family completely. Not a single Blackwell had reached out in months. So what brought Rosalind to Kingsley Industries now?

"Ms. Blackwell," Evelyn kept her tone polite but distant. "This is unexpected."

Rosalind lifted a silver thermos with a practiced smile. "Grandmother insisted I bring you her special herbal soup."

Evelyn handed her files to Maxwell without breaking eye contact. "Implement the changes we discussed."

"Yes, Ms. Carter."

Once alone, Evelyn gestured toward her office. "Shall we?"

Rosalind followed, her gaze sweeping over Evelyn's sleek modern workspace with poorly concealed surprise. The timid girl who'd once blended into the Sterling family's shadows now commanded the room like a queen holding court.

"You've changed," Rosalind murmured as she perched on the edge of the sofa.

Evelyn accepted the offered bowl without comment. The fragrant steam carried memories she'd rather forget.

"Grandmother still considers you family, you know." Rosalind's voice took on a conspiratorial tone. "Despite everything with Nathan."

The porcelain clinked as Evelyn set it down untouched. "Some chapters are meant to stay closed, Ms. Blackwell."

"But Nathan still cares!" Rosalind leaned forward. "You saw how he protected you at Grandmother's gala."

Evelyn's lips curved without warmth. "Tell me, are you seeing anyone these days?"

Rosalind's manicured fingers twisted in her lap. "I-I'm waiting for the right person. No need to rush into anything."

"Funny." Evelyn stood, signaling the end of their chat. "Neither am I."

The unspoken words hung between them - she'd rather remain single than settle for being Nathan Sterling's consolation prize again.

A flicker of relief crossed Rosalind's face before she schooled her features. As long as Evelyn stayed away from Nathan, her own plans could proceed undisturbed.

But the soup delivery had merely been her opening move. The real game was just beginning.

"You must think I'm terribly nosy." Rosalind laughed too brightly as she rose to leave. The thermos remained on the desk, its contents cooling untouched.
###Chapter 245 Data Heist

"Even if things don't work out with Nathan, I'll always consider you family," Rosalind said with a practiced smile.

A sharp knock interrupted their conversation.

Evelyn placed her chopsticks down, dabbing her lips with a napkin. "Enter."

The door swung open to reveal Adrian Prescott carrying several folders. His expression immediately shifted to professional neutrality upon seeing Rosalind. "Ms. Carter, the Dunhill project files you requested."

"Set them on the desk," Evelyn instructed with a slight nod.

Adrian complied efficiently before turning to leave.

Rosalind's eyes widened in recognition. "Adrian Prescott? What are you doing working here?"

The heir of Prescott Enterprises paused, his gaze cool as it swept over Rosalind. As Nathan Sterling's childhood friend, he knew all about her... including certain secrets she'd rather keep buried.

"I'm the VP of Mergers at Kingsley Industries," he stated matter-of-factly before exiting.

Rosalind's manicured nails dug into her palms. Why would the Prescott scion choose to work for Dominic Kingsley instead of his own billion-dollar empire?

Before she could probe further, Adrian had already disappeared. Something about his demeanor unsettled her - the warmth she remembered from their university days was conspicuously absent.

"Everything alright?" Evelyn's voice snapped her back to the present.

"Perfect!" Rosalind forced a laugh, gathering the empty containers. "Let me clean these for you."

"No need." Evelyn stood, taking the dishes herself. "Excuse me for a moment."

Alone in the executive office, Rosalind's gaze immediately locked onto the confidential folders Adrian had delivered. A predatory smile curved her lips as she pulled out her smartphone.

The camera shutter clicked silently three times.

When Evelyn returned, Rosalind was already standing by the door with her designer handbag. "I've taken enough of your time, darling. We'll catch up properly soon."

Evelyn summoned her assistant, but Rosalind waved her off. "Don't trouble yourself. I know my way around Kingsley Tower."

The elevator doors hadn't fully closed before Rosalind was dialing a familiar number, her voice trembling with excitement. "You'll never guess what I just acquired."

A deep chuckle echoed through the receiver. "Let me guess - corporate espionage? That is your specialty."

Rosalind's grip tightened around her phone. "Remember that Dunhill acquisition you were ready to abandon because of Adrian Prescott's interference?"

The line went momentarily silent. "That's impossible to-"

"Imagine having Kingsley's entire bid package," Rosalind purred, stepping into the afternoon sunlight. "How quickly do you think Sterling Enterprises could adjust their offer now?"
###Chapter 246 She's Not Worth My Concern

The call ended with a soft click.

Rosalind Blackwell twirled her phone between her fingers, a wicked gleam dancing in her eyes. Who would’ve thought a simple visit to Evelyn Carter’s company would yield such valuable leverage?

A smirk curled her lips. Oh, Evelyn. You’re in for quite the surprise at tomorrow’s bidding.

The moment Rosalind left, Adrian Prescott slipped back into Evelyn’s office.

His usual playful demeanor was gone, replaced by sharp focus. "Evelyn, what was Rosalind doing here?"

Evelyn glanced up, arching a brow. "You seem awfully interested in her movements."

Adrian scoffed. "Interested? Hardly. She’s not worth a second thought."

He stepped closer, his gaze intense.

"Evelyn, Rosalind is dangerous. We need to be cautious."

His eyes flicked toward the documents on the desk.

"The Dunhill project is a goldmine. Half the city is after it. I wouldn’t put it past her to pull something."

Evelyn’s playful expression faded.

Rosalind’s sudden appearance had been suspicious.

After a beat of silence, Evelyn met Adrian’s eyes. A silent understanding passed between them.

Their gazes shifted toward the hidden camera in the corner.

"Whatever she did, we’ll find out soon enough."

The next morning, a sleek red Ferrari idled outside Evelyn’s home.

Adrian checked his watch, leaning against the car with practiced ease.

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn appeared, dressed in a crisp white suit that made his pulse stutter.

He straightened, flashing her a grin as he opened the passenger door. "Morning, boss."

Evelyn blinked. "What are you doing here?"

Adrian’s smirk deepened. "What else? Playing chauffeur."

He gestured grandly to the seat.

With an exasperated sigh, Evelyn slid inside. Adrian shut the door and took the driver’s seat, easing the car onto the road.

Through the rearview mirror, he caught her sharp gaze. "You know, I could handle the bidding alone today."

Evelyn didn’t look up from her tablet. "You were up all night. Your eyes are bloodshot."

Adrian chuckled. "Serving Kingsley Industries is my pleasure."

"Don’t joke. If we lose this bid, it’s on you."

His grin turned wolfish. "Relax. I won’t disappoint you."

With that, he hit the gas.

Times Building loomed ahead, packed with corporate elites vying for the Dunhill project.

Adrian parked smoothly, then escorted Evelyn to the elevator.

The moment the doors opened, a man in a tailored suit approached. "Ms. Carter! A pleasure to see you."

Adrian leaned in, voice low. "Lionel Montgomery. CEO of Montgomery Realty. He profited the most when Delaney Group collapsed."

Evelyn gave a polite nod, her expression unreadable.

The game was on.
###Chapter 247 Inevitable Victory

Evelyn's lips curved into a confident smile as she extended her hand. "Mr. Montgomery, what a pleasant surprise."

"Ms. Carter, your reputation precedes you." Lionel Montgomery's gaze held reluctant admiration. "Kingsley Industries has flourished remarkably under your leadership."

"You're too kind." Her fingers barely brushed his before withdrawing.

"I see we're both here for the Dunhill Project." His smile turned sharp. "It appears we'll be direct competitors today."

Evelyn tilted her head slightly. "Healthy competition brings out the best in us, don't you think?"

Adrian Prescott's chuckle carried an edge as he joined them. "Then let the best company win, Mr. Montgomery."

The air between them crackled with tension. Evelyn noticed the barely concealed hostility in Adrian's stance toward Lionel.

"Indeed." Lionel's gaze lingered on Evelyn a moment too long before he strode away, his tailored suit jacket swaying with each confident step.

"Our biggest obstacle today," Evelyn observed quietly.

Adrian's eyes gleamed with appreciation. "Your perception never fails to impress me, Evelyn."

"Flattery won't win us the bid, Adrian."

"I speak only truth." His gaze followed Lionel's retreating figure. "That man's arrogance will be his downfall."

Evelyn's lips quirked. "The higher they climb..."

"The harder they fall," Adrian finished, matching her smirk.

They moved toward the bidding hall, guided by attendants to their assigned seats. Neither noticed Rosalind Blackwell observing them from a shadowed corner, her manicured fingers tightening around her champagne flute.

Lionel approached Rosalind, his hand landing familiarly on her shoulder. "Everything proceeding as planned?"

Rosalind's crimson lips curved. "The bid documents were submitted an hour ago."

"Excellent." Lionel took the seat beside her, leaning close. "I've secured all necessary materials - transferred 100 million to suppliers last night for immediate production upon our victory."

"So efficient." Rosalind's eyebrows arched in genuine surprise.

"Opportunity favors the prepared." His smile didn't reach his eyes. "Today's outcome will justify every expense."

Rosalind's confidence mirrored his own. "This project already bears our name. Let them posture all they want."

Their shared laughter held the easy complicity of co-conspirators.

"I'll freshen up before the announcement." Rosalind rose gracefully, her designer heels clicking across the marble floor.

But as she exited the restroom, Evelyn blocked her path.

"Rosalind Blackwell." Evelyn's greeting carried the weight of three years' unspoken tension. "I hadn't expected to see you here."

During her marriage to Nathan, Evelyn had maintained careful distance from the Blackwell family. Their interactions had been limited to obligatory family functions where Rosalind had been... tolerable.

That tolerance had evaporated the moment the divorce papers were signed.

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. "Tell me, are you here as a spectator... or as Lionel Montgomery's puppet?"
###Chapter 248 Data Miscalculation

Rosalind froze in shock, her fingers tightening around the leather portfolio. The sight of Evelyn Carter in the Sterling Enterprises restroom sent chills down her spine. "Evelyn! What a...surprise. Are you attending the bid too?"

Evelyn's laughter tinkled like broken glass as she reapplied her signature crimson lipstick. "For our new Arctic Drilling initiative. Care to see the specs?" The mirror reflected her icy smirk. "By the way, Rosalind darling, when did Montgomery Properties acquire you?"

Rosalind's breath hitched. How did Evelyn know about her defection? Had the data breach been discovered?

She forced a laugh, adjusting her blazer collar. "Months ago, actually. You've been...distracted."

Evelyn's manicured nail tapped the marble counter. "The Arctic project's profit margins could sustain Sterling for a decade." She turned abruptly, perfume swirling. "Funny thing - our geologists miscalculated the shale density. Nearly cost us billions."

The air conditioning hummed too loudly.

"Miscalculations?" Rosalind's throat constricted.

"Corrected yesterday." Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Imagine bidding with flawed data. Catastrophic, no?"

Rosalind's foundation couldn't hide her pallor. She bolted past the stalls, stilettos slipping on polished tiles.

Lionel Montgomery was reviewing contracts when Rosalind clawed at his arm. "We need to withdraw! The core samples—"

"Speak clearly." Lionel's cufflinks gleamed under fluorescent lights.

"That scheming witch altered the geological reports! Our bid's based on falsified—"

Lionel's chair screeched across the floor. He sprinted toward Submission Hall, narrowly avoiding collision with Evelyn's entourage.

The electronic clock above the bid desk flashed 11:01 AM.

"Too late, Mr. Montgomery." The clerk's apologetic smile made Lionel's temples throb. "Bids are sealed."

Rosalind's whisper was venomous. "That bitch set us up—"

Lionel backhanded her against a potted fern. "You assured me those numbers were pristine." His Rolex glinted as he straightened his tie. "Pray we lose, Rosalind. Or you'll wish we had."

Evelyn watched from the mezzanine, sipping champagne. The bubbles tasted like victory.
###Chapter 249 Doomed

Rosalind shrank back as Lionel's towering figure loomed over her. She held her breath until she returned to the bidding hall.

"The next project up for bid is 0781." The auctioneer's voice cut through the tension. "Competing companies include Sterling Enterprises, Kingsley Industries, Prescott Realty, and Draco Corporation..."

Flipping through his notes, he announced, "The winning bid goes to Kingsley Industries. Congratulations!"

Evelyn and Adrian rose to their feet as thunderous applause filled the grand hall.

After the auction concluded, Lionel immediately dialed his supplier. "Mr. Monroe, we need to terminate our current agreement. There's been a change of plans."

"What? Five million dollar penalty?" His grip tightened on the phone. "Surely we can negotiate—"

The line went dead before he could finish. The dial tone mocked him.

Lionel slammed his fist against the wall. "Goddamn vultures!"

Rosalind stood frozen nearby, not daring to make a sound. When Lionel whirled around, his eyes locked onto hers with terrifying intensity.

He seized her wrist with bruising force. "Look what you've done, Rosalind!"

His roar echoed down the empty corridor. Rosalind's entire body trembled.

"Half this disaster is your fault! If you can't produce five million, I'll skin you alive!"

With a violent shove, he sent her sprawling across the marble floor. The impact knocked the wind from her lungs.

Five million dollars?

She couldn't scrape together that sum even if she auctioned off every organ in her body!

"Mr. Montgomery, please! I swear it won't happen again—"

Her pleas fell on deaf ears as Lionel stormed away without a backward glance.

Rosalind pounded her fists against the cold floor until her knuckles bled. Only one thought consumed her:

She was ruined.

But she refused to go down without a fight.

As she struggled to her feet, her gaze landed on Evelyn standing nearby. The sight made her legs give out again.

For the first time in her privileged life, Rosalind Blackwell tasted true despair.

She scrambled up just as Evelyn approached. Gone was the gentle secretary she'd once bullied—now Evelyn's expression could freeze hell itself.

Before Rosalind could speak, a stinging slap cracked across her face.

Her head snapped sideways. Five angry fingerprints bloomed across her cheek.

"How dare you strike me?" Rosalind hissed through clenched teeth.

Evelyn's voice dripped ice. "Consider yourself lucky it's just a slap after what you've done."

"On what grounds—"

Evelyn thrust her phone forward, displaying damning surveillance footage. "Recognize this?"

Rosalind's face drained of color. She lunged for the device. "Give me that! Delete it now!"
###Chapter 250 Don't Define Me by My Mistakes

Rosalind lunged for Evelyn's phone.

Her fingers grasped empty air as Evelyn sidestepped with dancer-like grace.

"Corporate espionage carries a five-year sentence." Evelyn's lips curved into a feline smile. "Should I forward this footage to Chief Pembroke? I wonder which prison they'll assign you to?"

Rosalind's face drained of color. The reality of her situation crashed over her like icy waves. "Evelyn, please—"

"Please what?" Evelyn tilted her head. "Please ignore the fact you were stealing Kingsley Industries' trade secrets?"

Adrian leaned against the marble pillar, watching with amused detachment. "Tell me, Ms. Blackwell, is this your first corporate heist? Or just the first time you've been caught?"

Rosalind's manicured nails dug into her palms. She dropped to her knees, clutching Evelyn's blazer sleeve. "I'll disappear from your life! Change my name! Move to another continent! Just delete that video!"

Evelyn's frosty gaze didn't waver. "You must think I'm incredibly naive."

"Not naive—merciful!" Rosalind's voice cracked. "Think of the Sterling family's reputation! Nathan's standing in—"

Evelyn's laugh cut through the lobby like shattering crystal. "The Sterlings? Nathan? Since when did they ever show me basic human decency?"

Rosalind's mouth fell open. "But...you still love Nathan, don't you?"

"That," Evelyn said, adjusting her watch with deliberate slowness, "is the most hilarious thing I've heard all year." She leaned down until their faces were inches apart. "Here's your choice—turn yourself in within seventy-two hours, or I deliver this evidence personally. Clock's ticking."

As Evelyn strode toward the revolving doors, Rosalind collapsed onto the travertine floor like a marionette with severed strings.

Outside the Times Building, autumn leaves swirled around Evelyn's heels as she turned to Adrian. "That contract acquisition was masterfully done. Drinks at The Velvet Room tonight?"

Adrian's smirk deepened. "Just drinks? No...bonus rewards for your star negotiator?"

Evelyn pretended to consider, tapping one stiletto against the pavement. "For Kingsley Industries' new MVP? I suppose I'll need to prepare something special."

"Promises, promises," Adrian murmured, jingling his car keys. "Wait here—I'll bring the Aston around."

As Adrian disappeared into the parking structure, a midnight-blue Rolls-Royce glided to the curb. The tinted window descended to reveal Dominic's sharp profile.

"Evelyn."

"Brother dearest." She arched an eyebrow. "To what do I owe this royal summons?"

"Get in." He tapped the seat beside him. "We have matters to discuss."

After texting Adrian, Evelyn slid into the butter-soft leather interior. The car accelerated onto the expressway, Manhattan's skyline blurring past the windows in a kaleidoscope of steel and glass.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone case as unfamiliar skyscrapers loomed ahead. "Dominic...where exactly are we going?"
###Chapter 251 Unexpected

Dominic rarely visited Pamore. Yet today, he appeared without warning at Evelyn's doorstep.

She didn't beat around the bush. "Dominic, what brings you to Pamore?"

Silently, he handed her a thick manila folder.

"Look at this. It's Nathan's bail application for Isabella at the detention center, along with supplemental materials for early parole."

"Everything's about Isabella. Clearly, he's pulling strings to get her released."

This blindsided Evelyn. There had been zero indications of such moves before.

Her fingers turned icy as she flipped through the documents. "How sentimental of Nathan. Moving mountains for his precious mistress."

"Isabella's crimes are unforgivable. Getting her out won't be simple."

Evelyn's gaze darkened like storm clouds. "I've already intervened, but Nathan's fighting tooth and nail. He's throwing everything at this."

After a weighted pause, Dominic asked, "Evie, what do you really want to do about this?"

"His affairs stopped being my concern long ago."

One crisp sentence drew the clearest boundary between her and Nathan.

Dominic nodded in understanding. "Then consider it handled. If they want her out, they'll pay dearly. The only question is how much."

Evelyn hummed in agreement. She trusted Dominic implicitly.

He pulled out his phone, issuing sharp commands to someone on the other end.

After hanging up, his expression shifted. "Evie, you've been spending considerable time with Adrian Prescott lately. Are you two—"

"Dominic!" She cut him off mid-sentence.

"Marriage alliances have always been family decisions. Our opinions never mattered."

"Now that the arrangement's dissolved, let it rest. Adrian and I are just friends. Nothing more."

Dominic's laughter boomed through the room.

"Just friends? The man secured the Dunhill project for Kingsley Industries. You can't pretend that's coincidence."

"Work and personal matters don't mix. End of story."

Dominic pressed further. "Then what about Harrison? Where do you stand with him?"

Harrison had risked everything to save Evelyn. His feelings were obvious to everyone. With their families' history, the match seemed inevitable.

Evelyn exhaled heavily. "Dominic, Harrison deserves better than me."

"Since when did my sister lose her confidence? You're the Kingsley heiress. Status-wise, you're perfectly matched."

She shook her head, strands of hair catching the light.

"Love isn't about worthiness. It's... I'm scared, okay?"

The admission hung between them. Past wounds made her recoil from Harrison's advances. Trust didn't come easily anymore.
###Chapter 252 The Kingsleys' Stance

"Evelyn, listen to me." Dominic's voice was firm yet gentle. "One failed marriage doesn't define your worth. As a Kingsley, you deserve nothing but the best."

Evelyn felt warmth spread through her chest at her brother's words. "I know, Dominic. Having family like you means everything."

Dominic reached out, tousling her hair affectionately. "Since when did my little sister become so serious? Matters of the heart should follow your instincts, but..."

His sentence trailed off meaningfully.

Evelyn nodded, though she noticed Dominic was unusually chatty today. "Since when did my big brother become such a gossip?" she teased.

"Gossip?" Dominic arched an eyebrow. "I'm simply looking out for you. When it comes to your happiness, we can't afford any more mistakes."

His expression turned serious. "Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice... well, let's just say as long as it's not Nathan Sterling, whoever you choose will have the full support of our family."

The unspoken message was clear - the Kingsleys would never accept Nathan again.

Evelyn murmured softly, "Understood, Dominic. Don't worry about me."

As she spoke, a weight seemed to lift from her shoulders. Gazing out the window, she lost herself in thought.

Meanwhile, in Julian Hawthorne's office at Kingsley Industries, the director was absentmindedly fidgeting with a newly acquired crystal paperweight when a sharp knock interrupted him.

"Enter."

The door swung open to reveal Donovan Pierce, his assistant. "Director Hawthorne," Donovan announced, "we've secured the Dunhill contract."

The crystal paperweight slipped from Julian's fingers, shattering on the hardwood floor with an expensive crash.

Millions of dollars evaporated in that single moment. Julian's face darkened, his jaw tightening visibly.

"Repeat that," he demanded through clenched teeth.

"The bid results are confirmed. Kingsley Industries won the tender."

Julian's expression turned thunderous. He'd never anticipated Evelyn Carter could outmaneuver him so completely.

"Just friendship?" he muttered under his breath. "That Adrian Prescott is pouring his soul into Kingsley Industries. Rumor has it he personally secured Dunhill. Don't you have anything to say about that?"

Dominic had pressed her earlier. "Business and personal matters shouldn't mix," Evelyn had deflected.

But Dominic persisted. "And Harrison Whitmore? What are your thoughts about him?"

Everyone knew Harrison's feelings - he'd literally risked his life for Evelyn. With their families' longstanding connection, he seemed the perfect match.

Evelyn had sighed. "Dominic, Harrison is... too good for someone like me."

"Since when did my sister develop such low self-esteem?" Dominic had countered. "You're the Kingsley heiress. In terms of status, you're perfectly matched."

Evelyn shook her head slightly. "Love isn't about being worthy. It's just... I'm afraid."

The scars from her past made her hesitant to accept Harrison's affection, always keeping him at arm's length.

The Dunhill project was massive - long-term, high-profit. Its earnings alone could account for 10% of Kingsley Industries' annual revenue.

Evelyn had truly blindsided him.

"Director Hawthorne," Donovan ventured carefully, "I don't believe Ms. Carter acted alone. This was Adrian Prescott's doing."

Julian's eyes narrowed. "The background check you ran on him showed nothing remarkable. Removing him would cut off Evelyn's strongest ally."

"Precisely why his lack of connections works in our favor," Julian mused darkly. "But can we simply make him disappear?"

Donovan lowered his voice. "Rumor has it Adrian is considering leaving Kingsley Industries."

Julian's gaze sharpened. "Is that so?"

"Just hearsay for now. At most, he'll stay to oversee Dunhill, but once completed..."

A cold smirk twisted Julian's lips. "Adrian's competence is undeniable, but Dunhill won't be smooth sailing. Winning the bid is just the beginning - many obstacles could still arise."

Donovan hesitated before delivering the final blow. "With only six months remaining in your wager with Ms. Carter... current projections show company profits already..."

This was precisely Julian's greatest concern.
###Chapter 253 The Point of No Return

The odds were increasingly in Evelyn's favor.

Nathan Sterling wasn't about to concede defeat yet. Not when there were still six months left in their wager.

"Patience," he murmured, swirling his whiskey. "Building takes years. Destroying? That only takes moments."

His eyes darkened with determination. After decades in the corporate world, he wouldn't be outmaneuvered by some upstart.

"That Adrian Prescott needs to disappear."

Julian Hawthorne's assistant leaned in. "Sir, I might have a solution."

Nathan's eyebrow arched. "Do enlighten me."

Donovan Pierce whispered his plan. A slow smile spread across Nathan's face. "Impressive. You've learned well."

"Thank you, Director Hawthorne."

Meanwhile, Evelyn had organized a celebration at The Velvet Lounge for Adrian's success with the Dunhill project. The entire Kingsley Industries team was there, glasses raised.

"To Adrian Prescott - the mastermind behind our Dunhill victory!"

"Congratulations, Mr. Prescott!"

"To Kingsley Industries' continued success!"

As the night progressed, Evelyn noticed Adrian's growing concern for her. "I should head home," she announced. "Don't let me ruin the party."

Adrian immediately stood. "Let me drive you."

She shook her head. "Stay. Enjoy your moment. My driver's already on the way."

"At least let me walk you out."

At the entrance, Evelyn insisted, "Go back inside. The car will be here any second."

The Dunhill project was massive - long-term, high-profit. Its success alone could account for 10% of Kingsley Industries' annual revenue.

Evelyn had exceeded all expectations.

"Director Hawthorne," Donovan murmured, "this wasn't just Ms. Carter's doing. Adrian Prescott is the real threat."

Nathan's expression darkened. "Our previous investigation showed he has no powerful connections. Remove him, and Evelyn loses her strongest ally."

"Precisely. And I've heard rumors... he's considering leaving Kingsley Industries."

Nathan's eyes gleamed. "Is that so?"

"Nothing confirmed yet. But after Dunhill concludes..."

A cold smirk twisted Nathan's lips. "Adrian's skills are undeniable. But Dunhill won't be smooth sailing. Just because we won the bid doesn't mean we'll keep it."

"But with only six months left in your wager..."

That was Nathan's real concern. Current projections already showed Kingsley Industries' profits surpassing last year's.

Outside the lounge, Adrian hesitated. "I'll wait until your car arrives."

Evelyn sighed but didn't argue further.

"You know," Adrian said casually, "it's been six months since I joined Kingsley Industries."

"Time flies."

"When I first arrived, I had no idea you were the woman my family wanted me to marry." Regret colored his voice. Had he known, he never would have rejected the arrangement.

Now it was too late.

"Evelyn, if I could go back... I'd marry you without hesitation."

She stiffened. "You've had too much to drink. Go rest."

Adrian chuckled bitterly. "Perhaps. But in my heart, you'll always be my lady."

The headlights of her car approached. "My ride's here." She quickly got in, waving through the window.

Adrian watched until the taillights disappeared before returning to the party.

Inside the car, Evelyn scrolled absently through her phone.

Suddenly - SCREECH!

The car jerked violently. Evelyn slammed against the front seat, her phone flying.

Rubbing her forehead, she gasped, "What happened?"

The driver's face was pale as he pointed. "Look!"

Outside, a gang of bikers surrounded the vehicle, their predatory gazes locked on Evelyn through the windows.

The text is ? N?velDrama/.Org.
###Chapter 254 Obstacle

"Get that phone from the woman named Evelyn—now!"

The command barely left Tobias Grant's lips when his gang surged forward, smashing car windows with crowbars.

Glass exploded inward, showering Evelyn Carter with razor-sharp fragments. The car alarm screamed into the night.

"You're Evelyn! Hand over your phone!"

Thugs reached through broken windows, grasping for the device in Evelyn's hand.

She twisted away with feline grace, her boot connecting with the lead thug's face. Blood gushed from his nose instantly.

"Brave move for daylight robbery," she remarked coolly.

The injured man clutched his face. "You bitch! I'll make you pay for that!"

He lunged forward—only to freeze as black SUVs screeched to a halt around them. Six-foot-tall bodyguards materialized like shadows, surrounding the gang within seconds.

"Run, you idiots!" someone shouted.

But escape routes had vanished. The thug who'd threatened Evelyn now trembled violently, backing away.

"Ms. Carter, are you unharmed?" The head bodyguard bowed slightly, his voice thick with concern.

Evelyn brushed glass from her designer coat with deliberate slowness. Each movement radiated lethal elegance, silencing the onlookers.

Though she spoke no words, the air thickened with unspoken threat.

"Allow us to handle these vermin, Ms. Carter. They'll regret touching your property."

The bodyguard's assurance hung in the air as Evelyn stepped from the wrecked vehicle. Her glacial gaze swept over the gang, reducing them to shivering wrecks.

"You showed such interest in my phone." She turned the device in her hand. "Curious, since it's quite ordinary."

The thugs exchanged panicked looks. Where was the fragile socialite they'd been hired to intimidate? This woman moved like a panther and commanded like a queen.

Before they could process their mistake, Evelyn's voice cut through the night again. "Names. Now. Who sent you and why?"

Tobias, barely nineteen, cracked instantly. "Two hundred grand! Someone paid us to erase videos from your phone!"

A cold smile touched Evelyn's lips. The puppet master behind this was obvious. "And now? Still eager to delete my files?"

"No! God no!" Tobias fell to his knees. "Mercy, please! We didn't know who you were!"

His entire body shook so violently his teeth chattered.

Evelyn examined her manicure. "Two hundred thousand seems paltry for such risks." She locked eyes with the gang leader. "I'll double it. For a different service."

Four hundred thousand dollars?

Tobias's eyes gleamed with naked greed. "Name it. We're yours."

###Chapter 255 Silence the Shrew

At Sterling Manor, Rosalind Blackwell paced like a caged animal, phone clutched in sweating hands. Midnight approached with no word from the hired thugs.

She'd nearly decided to investigate personally when motorcycle engines roared outside.

"Tobias!" She flung the door open. "Did you get it?"

The gang leader removed his helmet, face unreadable. "My apologies, Ms. Blackwell."

Rosalind blinked. "For what? Don't tell me you failed against one woman!"

Tobias hesitated. "Are you certain about your target's description?"

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"Returning your money," Tobias said flatly. "But you'll need to come with us now."

Rosalind's laugh turned shrill. "Have you lost your mind?"

"Payment for services rendered," Tobias recited mechanically. At his signal, gang members seized Rosalind's arms.

"You traitor! How much did that Carter bitch pay you? I'll triple it!"

"This isn't about money," Tobias said as they bound her wrists.

"Release me! The Blackwells will destroy you!" Rosalind's screams escalated until Tobias sighed.

"Someone gag her. My ears are bleeding."

The transparent tape silenced her mid-shriek.

They delivered Rosalind to police headquarters, where Tobias presented damning surveillance footage to detectives. Evelyn's attorney stood nearby, observing.

By dawn, Rosalind faced corporate espionage charges and immediate incarceration.

The Blackwell family learned the news next morning.

Nathan Sterling had just returned from Tokyo, battling jetlag, when his uncle Archibald Blackwell ambushed him in the parlor.

"Nathan, I beg you!" Archibald clutched his arm. "Rosalind would never steal from Kingsley Industries! This is clearly Evelyn's vendetta!"

Olivia Sinclair sobbed into a handkerchief. "You were married to that woman. Make her drop these absurd charges!"

Nathan sipped black coffee, his expression unreadable. The caffeine revived him, but his demeanor remained glacial.

When appeals failed, Archibald stormed upstairs to Margaret Winslow's meditation chamber. The family matriarch's tranquility shattered upon hearing the news.
###Chapter 256 She Will Face Justice

"Rosalind is no child. How could she be so reckless? This will teach her a valuable lesson." Margaret's voice was firm.

"Mother, she's my only daughter!" Archibald's hands trembled. "If she goes to prison, what will become of me?"

Margaret remained unmoved. "She's a grown woman who must answer for her crimes."

Archibald hadn't anticipated his mother's resolve. His voice cracked. "If anything happens to Rosalind, I won't survive it. Is that what you want? To bury your own son in your old age?"

He slammed the door behind him, leaving Margaret sighing in resignation.

With no other options, she approached Nathan. "Could you speak to Evelyn? She's compassionate. Perhaps there's another solution?"

Nathan adjusted his cufflinks, his expression unreadable. "Grandmother, this is a legal matter now. Let the proper authorities handle it."

He couldn't bring himself to ask Evelyn for leniency. Corporate espionage wasn't a minor offense. A single data breach could destroy their company.

Gwendolyn, overhearing, misunderstood Nathan's stance. She wiped her tears, relief washing over her. "Nathan, I knew you'd help! Rosalind's been detained overnight already. You must get her out—"

Nathan's lips curled in a humorless smile. "Aunt Gwendolyn, don't celebrate yet. Industrial espionage carries a minimum three-year sentence."

"Three years? That's unacceptable!" Gwendolyn clutched at Nathan's sleeve desperately. "You know your uncle and I have only Rosalind. Speak to Evelyn—name your price!"

Nathan scoffed. "You overestimate my influence. Evelyn and I are divorced. This stays with legal."

Without another word, he strode out.

In the car, Simon studied Nathan's exhausted profile. "Mr. Sterling, you just returned from abroad. You should rest before returning to the office."

Nathan massaged his temples. Margaret's words at the birthday gala had haunted him, driving his overseas investigation. But after so many years, evidence was scarce.

Only confronting the source would bring resolution.

"How's Isabella's situation?" Nathan asked abruptly.

Simon adjusted his glasses awkwardly. "It's... complicated, sir."

Nathan's eyebrow arched. "Explain."

"The Delaneys learned of your involvement. They've mobilized their connections. The courts have made their position clear—unless we post exorbitant bail..."

Simon's meaningful silence spoke volumes.

"How much?"

"One billion dollars."

Nathan's expression darkened. While Sterling Enterprises could afford it, the sum was outrageous. Daylight robbery indeed.
###Chapter 257 True Identity

But Isabella wasn't worth that kind of money!

"Three months. Just get her out for three months. Negotiate to reduce the bail by half. If they agree, transfer the funds immediately!"

"Yes, Mr. Sterling."

At Kingsley Industries, Evelyn was in the middle of a global conference call.

When the meeting concluded, Maxwell knocked on her office door. "Ms. Carter, legal representatives from Sterling Enterprises are here. They wish to—"

Evelyn cut him off. "Let our attorneys deal with it. Just brief me on the outcome."

"Understood, Ms. Carter."

As Maxwell exited, he nearly collided with Julian at the doorway. His expression remained neutral as he greeted, "Director Hawthorne."

Julian flashed a practiced smile. "Mr. Donovan, you've been by Mr. Kingsley's side for years. No need for such formality with me."

Maxwell gave a slight nod. "How may I assist you, Director Hawthorne?"

Julian's gaze flickered toward the closed office door. "I'm here to see Ms. Carter."

Without waiting for permission, he strode past Maxwell and entered Evelyn's office. "Ms. Carter, am I interrupting?"

Recognizing the voice, Evelyn swiftly covered her documents and looked up with a cool smile. "Director Hawthorne, to what do I owe this visit?"

Julian made himself comfortable on the sofa uninvited, then adopted a carefully crafted expression of hesitation. "Ms. Carter, I've come today because... there's something you should know."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "What could possibly warrant a personal visit from you, Director Hawthorne?"

Dropping all pretense, Julian went straight for the jugular. "It's about Mr. Prescott."

He deliberately paused, watching for Evelyn's reaction. Her face remained an unreadable mask.

"What about Mr. Prescott?"

Julian feigned regret. "Ms. Carter, it seems you're still unaware! Our accountant, Mr. Pierce, has filed a formal complaint against Mr. Prescott."

Evelyn's brows furrowed. "Explain."

Julian pretended to be shocked. "Your team hasn't informed you? I heard Mr. Prescott has been abusing his position for personal gain—embezzling substantial company funds. Mr. Pierce discovered this and has already reported him to the authorities."

"What?" Evelyn shot to her feet, her expression turning stormy. "Adrian embezzling? That's absurd!"

As the Prescott heir, why would he need to steal petty cash?

Julian couldn't suppress his smirk at her dramatic reaction. "Ms. Carter, human nature is unpredictable. Especially when faced with such... tempting sums."

Evelyn stood her ground. "He would never do something so beneath him."

Julian shook his head with mock sympathy. "Your faith in him is touching. But facts don't lie. Perhaps a few million means nothing to you—"

"But to an ordinary employee like Mr. Prescott," Julian continued smoothly, "who only earns a modest salary each month, that's life-changing money. Not to mention—"

Evelyn actually laughed.

Her icy gaze locked onto Julian. Someone was clearly setting Adrian up, but they'd done a sloppy job of it.

They didn't even know his true identity as the Prescott heir, yet dared accuse him of embezzlement? As if the Prescott fortune wasn't enough?

Composing herself instantly, Evelyn spoke with measured calm. "Director Hawthorne, have you verified these allegations thoroughly? We mustn't wrongfully accuse anyone."
###Chapter 258 Innocence

Though Evelyn's reaction caught Julian off guard, he dismissed it as mere nervousness from the unexpected situation.

"The compliance team will determine if there's been any misconduct," Julian stated calmly. "They're currently at the company headquarters. Would you care to join them, Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn gave him a penetrating look before rising from her seat and striding out.

In Adrian's office, uniformed investigators swarmed like bees, collecting evidence while the heir lounged insolently on his leather couch.

"Finished yet?" Adrian drawled, examining his manicure. "Some of us have actual work to do."

The officers ignored his taunt, methodically searching through files and electronics.

Adrian's smirk faded as his eyes turned glacial.

When Evelyn entered, her displeasure was palpable. "Explain this."

The lead investigator stepped forward. "Standard procedure, Ms. Carter. We received credible allegations of—"

Evelyn's lips curled in derision. "After all this time, have you found anything substantial?"

The team exchanged glances. "The investigation is ongoing. While we haven't uncovered definitive proof yet—"

The supervisor cut in, "Our next step involves examining Mr. Prescott's financial records for suspicious transactions."

Julian appeared at Evelyn's shoulder. "They're merely doing their due diligence. Let's allow them to complete their work. The truth will emerge."

"I'm confident these professionals won't wrongfully accuse an innocent man," he added pointedly, "nor allow guilt to go unpunished."

Adrian's head snapped up. "Watch your mouth, Hawthorne! Who exactly are you calling guilty?"

"Merely stating facts, Mr. Prescott. The investigation will reveal all."

"Investigation my ass! This is your doing, isn't it?" Adrian surged to his feet. "I've got nothing to hide, but when this farce ends, you'll owe me a public apology!"

Julian's smile didn't reach his eyes. "Don't be too certain. The day's still young."

"Why you—"

"Adrian!" Evelyn's sharp tone cut through the tension.

Seeing her, Adrian's anger visibly dissipated.

Evelyn approached him, placing a calming hand on his arm. "I know you'd never betray the company. What's a few million to someone like you?"

Adrian exhaled sharply. "Damn right it's nothing to me," he muttered, glaring at Julian.

Evelyn's expression turned stern. "But protocol must be followed. Let them complete their search."

With a derisive snort, Adrian spread his arms. "Be my guests. Enjoy the show."
###Chapter 259 Does Your Face Hurt

Nathan's jaw tightened as he watched Evelyn and Adrian moving in perfect sync. The sight sent a sharp pang of irritation through him.

With a subtle nod, he signaled Montgomery Pierce who stood nearby. The accountant immediately approached Adrian with purposeful strides.

"Mr. Prescott, we need to verify your financial accounts. Your cooperation would be appreciated."

Adrian responded with a derisive snort before reaching into his tailored suit jacket. He produced a sleek leather wallet with deliberate slowness.

One by one, he slapped the cards onto the polished mahogany table. Each movement dripped with contempt, yet the collection of cards that emerged left the entire room speechless.

Platinum cards from the world's top five financial institutions gleamed under the chandeliers. Among them, a rare UBS palladium card caught the light with its distinctive sheen.

Montgomery's hands trembled visibly. "These... these are all yours?"

Adrian's lips curled in a cold smile. "Isn't that what you wanted to verify? Go ahead. Though I should warn you - any single one of these holds more than your annual salary."

Beads of sweat formed on Montgomery's forehead as he selected a card at random. His fingers shook as he inserted it into the POS terminal. "The... the PIN?"

"Doesn't require one," Adrian drawled.

The moment the machine processed the card, Montgomery's face went pale. The device slipped from his grasp, clattering loudly against the marble floor.

Nathan's voice cut through the tension. "What's wrong with you? It's just a balance check!"

Montgomery could barely form words. If his eyes weren't deceiving him, the displayed balance exceeded nine figures.

And this was merely one account. A dozen more cards lay untouched before them.

The implications were staggering. Why would someone with liquid assets surpassing a billion need to embezzle petty cash?

"Perhaps you'd like to see for yourself, Director Hawthorne?" Montgomery managed weakly.

Nathan snatched the device, his expression shifting from annoyance to disbelief. "This... this can't be correct."

Adrian leaned back, arms crossed. "Unless the banking system's been hacked, those are indeed my funds. That particular card holds approximately 130 million. The one beside it? 200 million. As for the UBS account... let's just say it would cover your company's quarterly earnings."

The numbers rolled off his tongue with casual indifference, as if discussing the weather rather than fortunes that could buy small countries.

Nathan's mind raced. Who was this man? Why had their background checks revealed nothing about such staggering wealth?

"Still think I'd risk my reputation for chump change?" Adrian's voice dripped with sarcasm.

Nathan's grip tightened on the POS machine. "Having money doesn't prove innocence. We need transaction records—"

"By all means," Adrian spread his hands wide. "Dig through every transfer. Just remember this, Director Hawthorne—when your investigation turns up nothing, I'll expect a public apology."

The unspoken challenge hung heavy in the air between them. Nathan's reputation versus Adrian's bottomless bank accounts. A battle he suddenly wasn't certain he could win.
###Chapter 260 What Went Wrong?

"Or was this some elaborate scheme of yours?" Adrian's voice cut through the tension like a blade. "What's your real objective? To have me expelled from Kingsley Industries?"

Silence thickened the air.

Adrian's carefully chosen words left Julian Hawthorne stumbling over his own tongue. The director's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water, unable to form a coherent response.

Adrian dismissed him with a glance, turning his attention to Evelyn Carter instead. "What's your take on this situation, Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn's frosty gaze settled on Julian. Her voice remained steady as she stated, "Mr. Prescott is the heir to Prescott Enterprises in Frenda. Our families had once considered arranging a marriage between us."

"Now we've all witnessed Mr. Prescott's capabilities firsthand - how he single-handedly secured the Dunhill project." Her eyes swept across the room before landing pointedly on Montgomery Pierce. "I believe Mr. Prescott deserves a full explanation for today's events."

The contempt in Evelyn's eyes was unmistakable as she addressed the trembling accountant. "Since you've made these accusations, you must have evidence, correct?"

"Present your proof. Fail to do so, and you'll face charges for false accusation. That's a jailable offense."

Montgomery had merely been following Julian's orders. How had everything spiraled out of control? They'd assured him all the evidence was prepared - all he needed to do was file the report.

What went wrong?

The accountant collapsed to his knees, grasping at Julian's trousers. "Director Hawthorne, help me! I don't want to go to prison!"

Julian's face darkened as he jerked away. "Your actions have nothing to do with me!"

"Director, we're partners! You can't just abandon me now!" Montgomery's voice cracked with desperation.

Panic flashed across Julian's features.

"Ms. Carter, don't listen to him. While we may share distant relations, we're hardly close. We barely interact. He's clearly trying to frame me by-"

"Director Hawthorne, you gave me direct orders!" Montgomery interrupted hysterically. "You said I just needed to report Mr. Prescott and you'd handle everything else!"

"What's happening now? Are you throwing me to the wolves?"

Julian's face twisted in fury. "Silence!"

He pointed an accusing finger at Montgomery. "He's spouting nonsense! I never instructed him to-"

Evelyn paid no heed to Julian's protests. She knelt beside the trembling accountant, her voice low but carrying. "Mr. Pierce, you've been with this company for years. You understand how things work."

"I'm offering you one chance. From this moment forward, every word must be the absolute truth. Otherwise, no one can save you."

Montgomery nodded frantically. "I swear, Ms. Carter! Only the truth! Every word!"

Evelyn's voice turned icy. "Who ordered this? What did they promise you?"

"It was Director Hawthorne!" Montgomery blurted out. "No - it was his assistant, Donovan Pierce who approached me! They said Mr. Prescott was obstructing the-"

Montgomery swallowed hard before continuing. "They promised me a million dollars upon completion, enough to disappear. Donovan provided all the instructions."

Julian's face paled as he scrambled to shift blame. "It was Donovan! That traitor! I can't believe he'd use my name for such schemes. I won't let him-"
###Chapter 261 What's Happening Now?

"Or was this your elaborate scheme all along?" Evelyn's voice cut through the tension like ice. "What's your real aim? To have me expelled from Kingsley Industries?"

Silence descended like a thick fog.

Adrian's carefully chosen words left Julian Hawthorne stumbling over his own tongue. The director's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water, unable to form a coherent response.

Adrian dismissed him with a glance, turning instead to Evelyn. His gaze softened slightly. "What's your take on this, Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn's frosty stare could have frozen molten lava as she regarded Julian. "Mr. Prescott is the heir to Prescott Enterprises in Frenda. Our families once arranged a marriage between us."

"Now we've all witnessed Mr. Prescott's capabilities firsthand - how he single-handedly secured the Dunhill project." Her voice carried across the room like a winter breeze. "I believe Mr. Prescott deserves a full explanation for today's events."

Her piercing gaze swept the assembled executives before landing on Montgomery Pierce. The disdain in her eyes was unmistakable. "Since you made the accusation, you must have evidence, correct?"

"Produce it now. If you can't, you'll face charges for false accusation. That carries jail time."

Montgomery had merely been following Julian's orders. How had everything gone so wrong? They'd assured him all evidence was prepared - his role had been simply to file the report.

What fresh hell was this?

Montgomery collapsed to his knees, clutching at Julian's trousers. "Director Hawthorne, save me! I don't want to go to prison!"

Julian's face darkened as he hastily stepped back. "Your actions have nothing to do with me!"

"Director, we're relatives! You can't just abandon me now!" Montgomery's voice cracked with desperation.

Panic flashed across Julian's features.

"Ms. Carter, don't listen to him. We may share distant blood ties, but we're hardly close. This is clearly an attempt to frame me by-"

"Director Hawthorne, weren't you the one who gave the orders?" Montgomery interrupted desperately. "You said I only needed to accuse Mr. Prescott and you'd handle the rest!"

"What's happening now? Are you making me the fall guy?"

Julian's face purpled with rage. "Silence!"

He jabbed an accusing finger at Montgomery. "He's spouting nonsense! I never instructed him to-"

Evelyn cut through Julian's protests. Kneeling to Montgomery's level, she fixed him with an unblinking stare. "Mr. Pierce, you've been with this company long enough to understand consequences."

"I'm offering you one chance. From this moment forward, every word must be truth. Otherwise, no one can save you."

Montgomery nodded so vigorously his jowls quivered. "I swear, Ms. Carter! Only the truth! Every word!"

Evelyn's voice could have frozen hell over. "Who ordered this? What did they promise you?"

"It was Director Hawthorne!" Montgomery blurted. "No - his assistant, Donovan Pierce approached me! They said Mr. Prescott was obstructing-"

"They promised me a million dollars upon completion, enough to disappear. Donovan provided all instructions!"

Julian scrambled to distance himself. "Donovan! That traitor! Using my name for this - I'll make him pay!"

###Chapter 262 The Ideal Partner

For the first time in his life, Adrian found himself grateful for his Prescott lineage.

"Taking on the Dunhill project solo presents considerable risk," he explained, all business now. "I recommend partnering with a firm of comparable capability."

"This would significantly reduce our risk exposure."

When discussing business, not a trace of Adrian's usual playfulness remained.

He continued, "Among Pamore's corporate leaders, aside from Sterling Enterprises, Horizon Technologies boasts the strongest financials."

"A partnership would maximize results."

Evelyn's eyebrows arched. "Horizon Technologies? You're suggesting we collaborate with them?"

Adrian nodded. "They're the optimal choice. Though-" He paused, meeting Evelyn's gaze. "There is an alternative - Sterling Enterprises."

"Nathan?" The name escaped Evelyn's lips before she could stop it. She shook her head firmly.

"Absolutely not. Horizon Technologies it is."

Work entanglements with Nathan Sterling were the last thing she wanted.

"Agreed. Horizon's financial strength makes them ideal partners." Adrian studied her reaction carefully. "I'll contact their president, though he's notoriously reclusive."

Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "No need for formal outreach. You likely know Horizon's president already."

Adrian's confusion showed. "I do?"

"It's Harrison Whitmore - the Fulton Group heir."

"Harrison?" Adrian's jaw nearly hit the floor.

Harrison Whitmore was practically a myth in their circles - child prodigy, Harvard valedictorian, business savant. The man was a living legend.

Though both Frenda natives, their paths had never crossed. When had Harrison come to Pamore? And he was the mysterious force behind Horizon Technologies?

Adrian's gaze sharpened on Evelyn. "You know Harrison personally?"

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "We're quite close, actually."

Since Harrison's injury saving her from the fire, he hadn't returned. But they maintained regular contact.

"If that's the case, he's undoubtedly our best option. Though-" Adrian pressed his lips together, an unfamiliar jealousy twisting in his gut. "Ms. Carter, this is strictly business. Don't let Harrison charm you."

"I'll admit he's impressive - marginally more so than myself. But you two would be disastrous together!"

Evelyn didn't know whether to laugh or sigh. "And how would you know that?"

Adrian's concern was palpable. If Nathan had been the competition, he wouldn't have worried. That history was settled.

But Harrison? The man was elite in looks, intellect, and pedigree. Adrian's odds plummeted below thirty percent.

His expression darkened. "If it's Harrison, I'll concede defeat. But Ms. Carter, matters of the heart require careful consideration."

Evelyn shook her head with an exasperated laugh. "It's business, Adrian. Why are you making it personal?"

"Just ensuring we stay professional, Ms. Carter!"

"Then let's focus on work."

With that, Evelyn turned on her heel and left his office.
###Chapter 263 Freedom at Last

"Mr. Donovan, what's on the agenda today?"

Maxwell followed half a step behind Evelyn as he recited her schedule.

"There's a global video conference at 10:00 am. At 2:00 pm, you have a meeting with Mr. Langley regarding the new venture, and tonight at 7:00 is the Sterling Enterprises chairman's anniversary celebration-"

"Understood."

Evelyn's phone vibrated in her pocket. "Hello darling. Are you busy?"

Olivia's voice came through the line. "That VIP client I mentioned? The one who dropped three million last time? She's at the boutique right now."

Evelyn pushed open her office door. "When did she arrive?"

"I've already checked with her. Any time before noon works."

"Got it."

Olivia hung up and approached the waiting client with a coffee. "Ms. Fairfax, our head designer will be here shortly."

The elegant woman gave a slight nod without speaking.

Just then, a familiar silhouette appeared in the boutique's doorway.

Isabella had been released from prison that morning. Her first act of freedom? A lavish shopping spree with Nathan's black card.

She'd already acquired an armful of designer bags, a wardrobe's worth of clothes, and a complete makeover at the most exclusive salon in town.

Those months behind bars had been pure torture. The constant fear, the humiliation - no one could imagine what she'd endured.

But finally, she was free.

Her eyes darkened as they fell upon the boutique. A cold smirk twisted her lips.

She strode inside with purpose.

The moment she entered, Isabella pointed at two mannequins wearing the latest collection. "These. I'll take both."

Olivia approached, then froze mid-step. Her polite smile vanished instantly.

"Isabella Delaney. Out already?" The venom in Olivia's voice was unmistakable.

Isabella's temper flared, but she reined it in. "What are you gawking at? Get me those dresses!"

Olivia crossed her arms. "This establishment serves members only. And you, homewrecker, are not on our list."

Isabella's face tightened. "Then enroll me." She slapped Nathan's black card on the counter.

Olivia didn't even glance at it. "Not happening."

"You-" Isabella bit back her rage, remembering Nathan's warning.

Fresh out of prison, she had no intention of returning.

"These rags aren't worth my time anyway. Only fools would buy this trash."

She snatched back the card and turned to leave.

Then paused dramatically. "Tell Evelyn I'm free now. Our unfinished business? It's only a matter of time."

"Whatever business you think we have, let's settle it now." Evelyn's voice cut through the air like ice.

She appeared beside Isabella in three strides.

Isabella took in Evelyn's flawless appearance - the tailored suit, the effortless elegance. Jealousy burned through her veins.

While she'd been suffering in that hellhole, Evelyn had been living the high life.

Her fists clenched. "Never thought you'd see me again, did you Evelyn?"
###Chapter 264 No Entry for Isabella and Dogs

"Did you crawl out of your hole to make trouble again?" Evelyn's voice dripped with disdain.

Isabella's face twisted momentarily before she forced a sickly sweet smile. "Do you even know how I got released?"

"Nathan paid an obscene amount for my bail!" Her eyes gleamed with malicious triumph. "Understand this, Evelyn - I'm the only woman who's ever mattered to him. You're just the discarded ex-wife he couldn't wait to get rid of."

Evelyn's expression remained unreadable as she crossed her arms. "Then by all means, stay glued to each other forever. Just don't let your toxicity leak onto innocent people."

"You bitch!" Isabella's nails dug into her palms as she glared.

"Mark my words, Evelyn. I'll make you suffer tenfold for everything I endured."

"Feel free to try," Evelyn's voice turned glacial. "Though I suspect you'd rather not revisit prison accommodations."

A visible shudder ran through Isabella's body at the mention of prison. The memories still haunted her.

"Just wait," she spat venomously.

At that moment, the elegant woman sipping coffee on the nearby couch finally spoke. Her voice carried the chill of winter winds. "Since when do homewreckers have the audacity to threaten the wronged party?"

Isabella whirled toward the unfamiliar voice. The woman appeared to be in her late thirties, exuding quiet sophistication.

Unable to vent on Evelyn, Isabella redirected her rage. "Mind your own business, hag!"

The woman's eyes darkened dangerously.

"Trash like you should crawl back into whatever gutter you came from. How dare you show your face here after what you've done?"

"I'll rip that smug look off your face!" Isabella lunged forward.

Evelyn intercepted her wrist with lightning speed. "Enough! This is my establishment, and she's my honored guest. Touch her, and I'll have you arrested before you can blink."

With a sharp twist, Evelyn sent Isabella stumbling backward onto the floor.

Olivia appeared instantly, broom in hand. "What's this vermin doing here? Out! Now!"

Humiliation burned Isabella's cheeks as she was physically escorted out. The door slammed behind her with finality.

"Let me make this clear, Isabella," Evelyn called through the glass. "Step foot here again, and I'll have security remove you every single time."

Moments later, a new sign appeared on the door: "No entry for Isabella and dogs."

Isabella's scream of frustration echoed through the street. With no other options, she retreated, her designer heels clicking furiously against pavement.

Turning back to her guest, Evelyn's demeanor softened. "My sincerest apologies for that unpleasant scene, madam."

The elegant woman studied Evelyn with newfound appreciation. A small smile played on her lips. "You must be Evelyn?"

Evelyn tilted her head slightly. "I am. Have we met?"

"Evelyn, this is Madame Gold," Olivia interjected excitedly. "She specifically requested you to design her gala gown."
###Chapter 265 A Face I Knew

"You designed the lead gown for the Sterling Couture showcase, didn't you?" The woman's voice carried genuine admiration. "It was breathtaking. I've heard whispers about your talent across Palisia."

She extended a perfectly manicured hand. "Henrietta Fairfax. A pleasure."

Evelyn accepted the handshake with a warm smile. "The pleasure's mine, Ms. Fairfax. Thank you for your support earlier. Should you ever visit my atelier, I'll ensure you receive a twenty percent discount on all purchases."

Henrietta's laugh sparkled like champagne. "I merely spoke my truth, yet here I am gaining privileges."

"Are you looking to commission a custom evening gown?" Evelyn inquired, already reaching for her measuring tape.

A mysterious glint appeared in Henrietta's eyes. "I require a floral-inspired haute couture piece for a gala. The moment I decided, your name was the only one that came to mind."

"Consider it done." Evelyn's fingers danced with precision as she took measurements. Their conversation flowed effortlessly between fabric choices and Parisian fashion trends.

As Henrietta prepared to leave, she produced an embossed card. "Contact me when the masterpiece is ready. I'll be waiting with bated breath."

Evelyn accepted the card with both hands. "The honor is mine. Safe travels."

The moment the door closed, Olivia practically vibrated with excitement, thrusting her phone at Evelyn. "Darling, look! I knew I recognized her! She's—"

Evelyn's breath caught at the Google results. "Henrietta Fairfax... The 'Fashion Oracle' with eighteen million followers?"

"Exactly! No wonder she critiqued our collection with such surgical precision!"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the business card. "This commission just became our top priority."

Their strategizing was interrupted when the boutique doors chimed again. Evelyn's spine straightened as she recognized the couple entering—Nathan Sterling with Isabella Delaney draped over his arm like expensive fur.

A scene she'd witnessed countless times.

Yet now, it stirred nothing but icy detachment in her veins.

Nathan's eyes locked onto Evelyn with electric intensity. He shrugged off Isabella's grip—

Only for Isabella to lunge at Henrietta's retreating figure.

Evelyn moved like lightning, intercepting the attack. "Touch my client again, Isabella, and I'll have security drag you out by your extensions." With a calculated twist, she sent the socialite stumbling into a display rack.

Olivia brandished a clothing steamer like a sword. "Trash belongs in dumpsters, not designer boutiques!"

Scarlet with humiliation, Isabella scrambled to her feet just as Olivia shoved her through the doors. A new sign appeared moments later: "No Admittance to Isabella Delaney or Unhousebroken Pets."

The satisfying thud of designer heels stomping away echoed through the boutique.

Evelyn turned back to her guest with an apologetic smile. "My deepest apologies for that unpleasantness, Ms. Fairfax."

The fashion icon studied Evelyn with newfound interest. "You're Evelyn Carter?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "I am. Have we met?"

Olivia practically bounced. "This is Henrietta Fairfax! She specifically requested you for her Met Gala gown!"

The revelation sent a thrill down Evelyn's spine. This commission could change everything.
###Chapter 266 Homecoming

Nathan Sterling's gaze remained fixed on the path where Evelyn Carter had disappeared. His jaw tightened as he turned to Isabella Delaney. "You planned this, didn't you? You knew Evelyn would—"

"Nathan, you're misunderstanding me completely!"

"Cut the act." His voice turned glacial. "We both know exactly who you are. I didn't get you out of prison so you could strut around like some entitled princess."

His next words came out like shards of ice. "Stay away from Evelyn. If I catch you near her again, I'll personally escort you back to your jail cell."

Silence crackled between them.

Isabella's face twisted in fury as she reached for Nathan's arm, but he jerked away.

"Enough with the theatrics." He tossed a black credit card onto the nearby bench. "Take this, buy whatever you want, and never call me again."

Without waiting for her reaction, Nathan strode away, leaving Isabella trembling with rage.

Inside his car, he grabbed his phone with unnecessary force. "I told you to monitor Isabella's movements. Report."

"Mr. Sterling, no suspicious activity detected so far."

"Keep watching. The moment she makes a wrong move, I want to know immediately."

"Yes, sir."

Nathan ended the call and threw his phone onto the passenger seat. His fingers gripped the steering wheel until his knuckles turned white. The memory of Evelyn's indifferent expression haunted him.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's phone buzzed with a new message. Her breath caught when she saw the sender.

"Evelyn, I'm back in Kingsley."

She immediately dialed the number, her conference call forgotten. "Harrison! You're in Pamore?"

Harrison Whitmore stood before the gleaming Kingsley Industries headquarters, a smile playing on his lips. "Right outside your office, actually."

Evelyn rushed to the window. Below, a sleek black Rolls Royce Phantom waited like a silent promise.

"Don't move. I'm coming down."

She grabbed her files and practically ran to the elevator, only to find Harrison already in the lobby. His eyes lit up when he saw her.

"Slow down," he chided gently, catching her by the shoulders. "I'm not going anywhere."

Evelyn's hands fluttered over his torso, her eyes searching. "Are you healed completely? No lingering pain?"

Harrison chuckled, ruffling her hair. "Doc cleared me weeks ago."

"But the scars—"

"Faded to nothing." He captured her restless hands. "See? Good as new."

Only then did Evelyn exhale, the tension leaving her shoulders.

"Now," Harrison said, intertwining their fingers, "I'm starving. Let's eat."

Evelyn nodded, but her attention snagged on their joined hands. The warmth radiating from his touch felt like coming home.

They chose an intimate vegan bistro Evelyn frequented. As they perused the menu, their voices blended seamlessly.

"No onions, no mushrooms, light dressing."

The waiter grinned. "Sir knows his lady's preferences perfectly."

Evelyn's cheeks flamed at the word "lady." She grabbed her water glass, drinking deeply to hide her reaction.

Harrison simply smiled, his thumb tracing circles on the back of her hand under the table. The unspoken promise in his gaze made Evelyn's pulse stutter.
###Chapter 267 The Mad Bitch Unleashed

Harrison's expression remained unreadable as he passed the menu to the waiter. "That will be all for now. We'll order more if necessary."

Once they were alone, Evelyn finally set down her fork and fixed him with a curious gaze. "Harrison, how did you know I never eat onions or mushrooms?"

Not even Nathan, who had been married to her for three years, had noticed this particular preference.

Harrison's intense gaze held hers for a long moment before he answered simply, "Your brother mentioned it."

"Dominic?"

He nodded, carefully omitting the countless hours he'd spent observing her habits himself.

Evelyn accepted his explanation without question.

"Well, well, if it isn't Evelyn Carter!" A shrill voice cut through their conversation. Before Evelyn could react, Beatrice Harrington was already looming over their table.

The woman's beady eyes darted between them with undisguised curiosity. As Nathan's aunt, she'd always despised Evelyn. Seeing her now with such an influential man made Beatrice's blood boil.

"What exactly is going on between you two?" she demanded.

Evelyn felt her patience evaporate. Of all the Sterling relatives, Beatrice was the worst - a vicious gossip with no filter.

"Ms. Harrington, that's none of your concern."

Beatrice's face twisted in anger, still smarting from previous rejections. "Oh really? So you've upgraded from our family to some boy toy? Though I must say, this one's a definite downgrade from Nathan."

Evelyn saw red. She could tolerate insults against herself, but not Harrison.

"Where did this rabid bitch escape from?" Evelyn's voice turned icy. "Someone should put her back on her leash."

"How dare you!"

"Am I wrong?"

Beatrice's face flushed crimson, but Evelyn wasn't finished. "Still unemployed, isn't your husband? How long do you think that would last if I made a few calls?"

She knew exactly where to strike.

The threat hit its mark. Beatrice visibly deflated. This wasn't the same powerless girl she'd bullied before.

Across the table, Harrison calmly dabbed at Evelyn's lips with a napkin, his affectionate gesture only fueling Beatrice's rage. With a final huff, she stormed away.

Their meal continued undisturbed.

After lunch, they headed to Horizon Technologies. The staff didn't recognize Evelyn personally, but Harrison had introduced her as honorary director during a company-wide meeting.

"Good afternoon, Ms. Carter!" employees greeted respectfully as they passed.

Evelyn looked puzzled. Once in the elevator, she turned to Harrison. "Why are they addressing me like that?"

She knew Horizon was jointly funded by the Whitmore and Kingsley families, but she'd never been involved.

Harrison's lips curved in that secretive smile she'd come to recognize. "You do realize you own 49% of Horizon's shares, don't you?"

Evelyn's breath caught.

"Forty-nine percent?"

That gave her significant influence at Horizon. The collaboration with Kingsley Industries would proceed smoothly now - family business always took priority.

"Harrison, why didn't you tell me sooner?"

"Consider it a well-timed surprise."

As the elevator doors opened, they nearly collided with Diana Chamberlain.
###Chapter 268 First Encounter

The disciplinary action had left Diana Chamberlain stripped of her prestigious title. Once the executive assistant to the CEO, she now headed the marketing division.

This demotion burned like acid in Diana's veins. She'd approached Harrison Whitmore multiple times, pleading her case, only to be met with stone-cold rejection each time.

After countless sleepless nights, Diana arrived at an undeniable conclusion - only one person held sway over Harrison's decisions.

Evelyn Carter.

"Mr. Whitmore." Diana dipped her head in practiced deference.

Then her gaze shifted to Evelyn, adopting the perfect blend of respect and warmth. "Ms. Carter."

Evelyn responded with a gracious smile before gliding into Harrison's office.

Diana trailed behind, arms laden with files. "The quarterly marketing reports require your approval, sir."

Harrison took his seat, fountain pen flashing as he signed with decisive strokes.

During his absence, paperwork had multiplied like rabbits across his mahogany desk. Evelyn settled onto the leather sofa to wait.

Boredom led her to flip absently through a fashion magazine.

By the time Harrison finished, exhaustion had claimed Evelyn. She lay curled against the cushions, breathing softly in sleep.

Harrison set aside his pen and crept forward. He draped a cashmere throw over her shoulders, the moment stretching into eternity.

Gazing at her peaceful expression, memories flooded his mind.

The year Harrison turned seven.

Since toddlerhood, one persistent wish had consumed him. When the pigtailed girl moved in next door, his longing intensified.

He'd pestered Beatrice relentlessly.

"Mother, can't you give me a baby sister?"

"Please, I promise to be the best big brother!"

"I'll protect her and share all my toys-"

Beatrice's fragile health after Harrison's birth made another pregnancy impossible.

"Darling, what about this beautiful doll? She can be your pretend sister."

Harrison had shoved it away, tears burning. "I want a real sister!"

Beatrice could only sigh helplessly.

Years passed, but Harrison's wish never faded.

He couldn't recall the exact date.

Only that winter morning when sunlight first pierced the seasonal gloom.

Golden beams painted the azure sky, warmth returning to the world.

"Harrison! Come meet your new sister!"

His Dr. Martens pounded down the staircase. There she stood - a cherubic vision in crimson riding gear.

Evelyn had been five then.

Her enormous eyes studied him solemnly until Beatrice made introductions. "Sweetheart, this is Harrison!"

Suddenly, sunshine burst across Evelyn's face. "Harrison!" she chirped.

Beatrice fussed over her new charge. "Come here! She's your sister now!"

Harrison's heart soared. Finally - a real sister!

"Evelyn adores horseback riding," Beatrice said. "There's a pony waiting outside. Will you take her?"

Young Harrison squared his shoulders. "I'll protect her always."

That first caretaking moment remained etched in his mind. How carefully he'd positioned the mounting block. "Steady now, Evelyn! Never touch a horse's hindquarters!"

The little girl nodded earnestly. "Okay, Harrison!"

###Chapter 269 Be My Husband

Harrison Whitmore's heart had melted when little Evelyn Carter called his name. Taking his role as her guide seriously, he had taken her for a pony ride through the estate gardens.

Evelyn's curious eyes darted around as she bombarded him with endless questions.

"Harrison, why can't ponies talk like us?"

"Why is the sky that shade of blue?"

"How come birds can fly but we can't?"

"Why are there boys and girls?"

The questions kept coming, but young Harrison answered each one with remarkable patience, never once losing his composure.

"You're amazing, Harrison! You know everything!"

Evelyn gazed at him with such admiration that Harrison could practically see sparkles in her eyes. His chest swelled with pride.

This little girl was absolutely precious!

"Evie, will you be my little sister?" he asked hopefully.

Evelyn shook her head vigorously. "No!"

She began counting on her tiny fingers with great seriousness. "I already have three brothers at home... If I add you, that would make four older brothers!"

Harrison's face fell instantly.

A pang of jealousy shot through him.

"You have three brothers, but I don't have any little sisters!"

Evelyn blinked thoughtfully. Then she reached for Harrison's hand with sudden inspiration. "Then don't be my brother. Be my husband instead."

Harrison nearly fell off the pony in shock. At seven years old, he knew things other children didn't.

Like how when boys grew up, they married girls!

Married people got to be together forever and even have babies! Though his mother Beatrice had warned him marriage wasn't something to take lightly.

"Why do you want me to be your husband?" he asked carefully.

Evelyn answered with childlike innocence. "Because my brother Dominic said every girl only gets one husband when she grows up. So Harrison, will you be mine?"

Harrison thought this was brilliant. This way, his adorable Evie would stay with him forever!

"Okay."

"Let's pinky promise!"

"Pinky promise."

Their small fingers intertwined, sealing their childhood vow.

But the next morning, Harrison was jolted awake by loud sobbing. Rubbing his eyes, he found Evelyn standing by his bed, tears streaming down her face.

Panic set in immediately.

"What's wrong?"

He scrambled to comfort her, but nothing worked. If anything, her crying intensified.

"Don't cry—"

"I'll give you my favorite toy car!"

"I'll buy you that doll you wanted!"

"Want to go riding again?"

Harrison was sweating with worry, completely at a loss.

Just then, Beatrice Whitmore entered the room and gathered Evelyn into her arms. "Sweetheart, what's the matter?"

Evelyn buried her face in Beatrice's shoulder, hiccuping between sobs. "Dominic said... if I sleep in the same bed as a boy... I'll get pregnant! I don't want to be pregnant yet... I don't want a baby now..."

Her cries grew even louder.

Beatrice couldn't help but laugh. "Darling, that's not how it works!"

Evelyn's tears stopped abruptly. She peered up with hopeful, watery eyes. "Really?"

Beatrice nodded firmly. "You and Harrison aren't married, and you're both children. Children don't have babies."

Evelyn nodded slowly, only half understanding. But it was enough—her radiant smile returned, all worries forgotten.
###Chapter 270 Unrequited Love

A sharp knock shattered Harrison's contemplation.

He blinked, realizing he'd been lost in thought for too long.

...

Seeing Evelyn still peacefully asleep on the couch, Harrison moved silently toward the door. He intercepted the team that had come for their scheduled meeting.

"Let's take this to the conference room," he murmured.

The executives exchanged puzzled glances but followed without question as Harrison led them away.

When Evelyn finally stirred awake, the expansive office stood empty. As she sat up, the cashmere throw draped over her slipped to the floor.

She reached for it just as the door swung open. Harrison entered, their eyes locking instantly.

"Awake at last," he said, his voice rich like melted chocolate.

Evelyn smoothed her hair self-consciously. "How long was I out?"

"Not terribly long."

Harrison approached with that faint, mysterious smile of his. "Care for a tour?"

Evelyn's eyebrows lifted. "Really? I'd love that."

"Then come."

As they walked through Horizon Technologies' headquarters, Evelyn marveled at the scale. It seemed impossible this empire had been established in mere months.

Every employee moved with precision, a well-oiled machine under Harrison's command.

He introduced department heads and key teams until they reached marketing.

"Ms. Carter, who's that with Mr. Whitmore?" a junior associate whispered to Diana.

Diana's gaze darkened when she spotted Evelyn. "That's Ms. Kingsley. One of our directors."

"The same one he mentioned at the all-hands meeting?"

"They look awfully close. Do you think...?"

"Must be his girlfriend. When has Mr. Whitmore ever personally escorted anyone?"

"Exactly! He doesn't even keep female assistants. We all wondered if he was..."

"Shh! But look at them now. He's clearly saving himself for someone special."

Diana's nails dug into her palms. She'd been Harrison's only female executive assistant before being transferred. All because of...

"Enough gossip!" she snapped. The team scattered instantly.

Once she left, the whispers resumed. "Notice how obsessed she is with Mr. Whitmore's business?"

"Way beyond professional interest..."

"Unrequited love, maybe? Shame - he's clearly taken."
###Chapter 271 Elegance at the Racecourse

"Exactly. I share the same opinion. But why would Mr. Whitmore show interest in a mere assistant? Even if he's seeking a companion, it ought to be someone of Ms. Carter's caliber, with matching social standing."

Diana lingered by the doorway, overhearing her coworkers' conversation. A bitter cocktail of emotions churned within her, fingers tightening into silent fists.

Her eyes darkened instantly with unspoken resentment.

Meanwhile, after Evelyn and Harrison completed their tour of Horizon Technologies, she'd gained substantial insight into the company's operations.

Harrison tilted his head. "So, Evelyn? Have you reached a decision about partnering with Horizon?"

Evelyn arched one perfectly shaped brow. "Is there even a question? I won't let outsiders reap benefits from our hard work. Consider it settled."

Harrison responded with an approving hum. "Excellent. Our teams can coordinate tomorrow to finalize the paperwork immediately."

"Perfect! Harrison, we do make quite the efficient team, don't we?"

As they strolled down the corridor, Harrison suddenly suggested, "Since we've wrapped up business early, how about some recreational diversion?"

Surprise flickered in Evelyn's emerald eyes. "What did you have in mind?"

Harrison's lips curved as he closed the distance between them. "I recall your childhood passion for equestrian sports. The Whitmore Equestrian Club awaits."

Evelyn's breath caught slightly.

"You remembered? Though it's been ages since I last rode. Now that you mention it..." A spark of excitement lit her features. "Shall we?"

"Absolutely," Harrison agreed without hesitation.

Soon, his luxury car carried them toward the prestigious club.

The weekday afternoon meant sparse crowds at the elite establishment. Upon arrival, uniformed staff approached immediately with deferential bows. "Mr. Whitmore. Ms. Carter."

Evelyn blinked in confusion—this marked her first visit, yet recognition shone in their eyes.

"Bring out Snowfall," Harrison commanded.

A groom nodded sharply before leading forth a magnificent white Arabian stallion.

Evelyn's breath hitched at the sight. "She's breathtaking!"

Harrison took the reins, guiding the horse toward her. "Your mount awaits."

Remarkably, the intelligent creature knelt gracefully before Evelyn.

"She understands commands!" Evelyn marveled, settling into the saddle with practiced ease.

The stallion rose smoothly, moving with aristocratic poise.

Behind them, another groom presented Harrison's usual mount—a sleek black Thoroughbred. Once mounted, he guided his steed beside Evelyn's, and soon both horses thundered across the manicured grounds.

Unbeknownst to them, Rosalind and Nathan had just arrived at the club's gated entrance.

After Evelyn's legal actions against Rosalind for corporate espionage against Kingsley Industries, Sterling Enterprises had paid thirty million in settlement damages.

Only then had Rosalind secured her release from incarceration.

With the Sterlings handling the fallout, she'd been installed as Nathan's personal assistant at Sterling Enterprises.

Today's agenda involved accompanying Nathan for client meetings at the equestrian club.

"Nathan, when is Mr. Blackwood arriving? This heat is unbearable. Might we wait indoors?" Rosalind complained, fanning herself with a contract folder.

Nathan's brow furrowed imperceptibly. He harbored no affection for his spoiled cousin, but family obligations compelled his tolerance. Especially considering...
###Chapter 272 The Puppet Master

Nathan's response was curt. "You can go ahead without me."

Rosalind's teeth sank into her plump lower lip.

Seeing his indifference, she remained stubbornly by his side. Moments later, their business associate Cornelius Blackwood finally made his appearance.

"My apologies for the delay, Mr. Sterling."

When it came to business matters, Nathan transformed into a different person entirely. He extended his hand cordially.

"Not at all, Mr. Blackwood. I heard about your passion for equestrian sports and specifically chose this venue. I was hoping to witness your renowned riding skills firsthand."

"You flatter me, Mr. Sterling. Rumor has it you're quite the accomplished rider yourself. Perhaps we could exchange pointers today."

As they conversed, the trio moved toward the racetrack.

Having no interest in horses, Rosalind lingered in the lounge area.

"Waiter, fetch me some orange juice," she commanded before settling onto an overstuffed couch.

Her gaze drifted toward the track, where a familiar silhouette suddenly caught her attention.

She nearly leapt from her seat.

Bitter recognition flooded her veins. "Evelyn? What's she doing here?"

Rosalind's eyes darted to Nathan's distant figure, relieved to see him facing the opposite direction. The tension in her shoulders eased slightly.

But her brow furrowed as she studied the man beside Evelyn. Who was he?

"Your juice, madam." The waiter placed the glass on the side table.

Rosalind snapped back to reality. "Wait."

She produced several crisp bills and pointed discreetly at Harrison. "Who is that gentleman?"

Following her gesture, the waiter explained, "That would be Mr. Whitmore, the owner of our establishment."

"The owner?" Rosalind's eyebrows shot up.

Evelyn was consorting with the racetrack's proprietor?

This was explosive information.

"What's his full name?"

The waiter shook his head apologetically. "I'm afraid I can't disclose that, miss."

Frustrated, Rosalind dismissed him.

Yet her eyes remained locked on Evelyn like a predator tracking prey. The humiliation from their last encounter still burned fresh in her memory.

Her fingers unconsciously traced the faint scar on her cheek.

Evelyn had struck her once. Now, she would make sure Evelyn paid tenfold.

A venomous smile curled her lips as schemes began taking shape in her mind.

Meanwhile, Evelyn moved with effortless grace across the track, her confidence radiating with every stride.

"Ready for a break, Evie?" Harrison suggested after several laps.

"Absolutely." Evelyn handed the reins to a stable hand before joining Harrison in the lounge.

Neither noticed the shadow slipping into the stables as they departed.

They had just settled into plush chairs when Nathan and Cornelius approached.

Nathan had spotted Evelyn earlier but maintained his composure.

Cornelius, however, immediately recognized Harrison and approached with deference. "Mr. Whitmore! What an unexpected pleasure. Here for some riding as well?"

His tone carried unmistakable respect, bordering on reverence.

Harrison responded with a barely perceptible nod. "Mr. Blackwood. Here on business, I presume?"
###Chapter 273 The Failed Taunt

Cornelius nodded eagerly. "I came to discuss business with Mr. Sterling and thought I'd enjoy some horseback riding. Care to join me, Mr. Whitmore?"

Harrison declined without hesitation. "Not today."

Noticing Evelyn standing beside him, Cornelius smirked. "Ah, I understand. Another time then, Mr. Whitmore."

After exchanging pleasantries, Cornelius turned to leave. "Shall we continue our discussion, Mr. Sterling?"

Nathan's voice turned icy. "Our business is concluded, Mr. Blackwood."

Cornelius blinked in confusion. "But we were making progress just moments ago."

Nathan's gaze hardened. "That was then."

Though furious, Cornelius knew better than to challenge the Sterling heir. He stormed off without another word.

Nathan stood motionless, his burning stare fixed on Evelyn.

Feeling the intensity of his gaze, she looked up and met his eyes.

Memories flooded Nathan's mind - their first encounter at this very racetrack, competing for a project on horseback. Evelyn's confident posture, the wind in her hair as she rode...

"Evelyn," he said suddenly. "Join me for a ride."

Her refusal was immediate. "No thank you, Mr. Sterling."

Nathan's expression darkened.

Just then, Rosalind approached with false cheerfulness. "What a coincidence seeing you here, Evelyn!" Her sugary tone belied the malice in her eyes.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Here to ride, Ms. Blackwell?"

Rosalind's smile widened. "It's dull alone. How about a friendly race?"

"Pass," Evelyn said flatly.

Rosalind's eyes gleamed with challenge. "Not interested? Or are you afraid? Still shaken from our last encounter?"

Evelyn remained unfazed. "Correct. I have no desire to ride with you. Problem?"

Rosalind's mask slipped momentarily before she turned to Nathan. "Nathan, perhaps you'll join me instead?"

"Not interested," he replied coldly.

Humiliation colored Rosalind's cheeks. As a Blackwell, she wasn't accustomed to public rejection.

Evelyn turned to Harrison. "Let's feed Snowy and go."

Harrison's eyes softened. "Of course."

They walked away, leaving Nathan and Rosalind fuming behind them.

Rosalind's nails dug into her palms. "Who does that commoner think she is? Such arrogance!"

Nathan's voice cut like ice. "Enough."
###Chapter 274 Snowy's Fury

Material ? of NovelDrama.Org.

Rosalind's face twisted with rage as she spat out the venomous words. "Just you wait. That bitch will regret crossing me today."

Nathan's brows furrowed as he roughly grabbed her wrist. "What the hell did you do?"

Before she could respond, Evelyn's terrified scream pierced through the stable. "Ah!"

Evelyn had been attempting to feed Snowy when the normally docile stallion suddenly became agitated and charged straight at her.

The unexpected attack froze Evelyn in place.

As the massive horse barreled toward her, Harrison moved with lightning reflexes, throwing himself between them.

He tackled Evelyn to the ground, shielding her body with his own. "Get down!"

But Snowy wasn't finished. The enraged animal fought against his restraints, muscles straining to break free.

Evelyn's instincts kicked in.

With years of equestrian experience, she immediately sensed something was terribly wrong. "Harrison, this isn't normal behavior."

Harrison tightened his grip around her. "Snowy's never acted like this before. He's the gentlest horse in the stable."

Nathan burst into the stable just then, his eyes scanning for Evelyn. "Are you hurt?"

At the sight of Rosalind behind Nathan, Snowy went berserk, rearing up dangerously. Harrison pulled Evelyn back. "Move!"

With a final powerful jerk, Snowy broke free and charged straight at Rosalind.

Rosalind shrieked and turned to flee. "Get away from me!"

But the furious stallion pursued her relentlessly. In her panic, Rosalind tripped and fell face-first into the dirt. Snowy reared up and brought his hooves down hard on her back.

A blood-curdling scream echoed through the stable.

Rosalind writhed in agony as Snowy trampled her twice more before the stable hands could intervene.

Harrison's commanding voice cut through the chaos. "Snowy! Stand down!"

But the horse had gone completely wild, nostrils flaring as he continued his rampage.

Fortunately, the staff managed to drag the unconscious Rosalind to safety just in time.

Evelyn exchanged a knowing glance with Harrison, who immediately barked orders. "Call an ambulance. Now!"

Seizing the moment, Evelyn cautiously approached the still-agitated stallion.

Miraculously, Snowy calmed at her approach, his violent energy dissipating as she drew near.

Yet Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling this was no accident.

Nathan's expression darkened as he ignored his injured cousin, focusing solely on Evelyn. "Are you alright?"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Shouldn't you be more concerned about your cousin, Mr. Sterling?"

His response came cold and clipped. "She earned every hoofprint."

The implication wasn't lost on Evelyn. "So you knew about this?"

Nathan's silence spoke volumes.

When the ambulance arrived, Evelyn pulled Harrison aside. "This was deliberate."

Harrison squeezed her hand reassuringly. "I'll handle it."

At the hospital, Rosalind regained consciousness screaming accusations. "That witch Evelyn did this! She set that demon horse on me!"

Though Olivia didn't know the full story, Rosalind's hysterical claims ignited her fury.
###Chapter 275 My Apologies

"That Evelyn keeps causing trouble for our family. What did we ever do to deserve this? She treats you with such disrespect."

"Rosalind, don't upset yourself. I'll get to the bottom of this. With injuries like yours, even that racecourse won't escape liability."

Rosalind's eyes darkened with realization. "Mother, Evelyn's current boyfriend owns that racecourse. They're clearly working together."

"This is unacceptable! Does she think our family is weak?"

Gwendolyn Blackwood trembled with rage. Her only daughter being treated this way was beyond bearing.

As Gwendolyn turned to leave, Nathan Sterling blocked the doorway.

Gwendolyn's lips curled in disdain. "Nathan, you heard everything. That witch is behind this. Don't you dare protect her again."

Nathan's mouth twisted into a mocking smile. "Aunt Gwendolyn, perhaps you don't know your daughter as well as you think."

"What are you implying?"

"I witnessed everything."

Gwendolyn's face paled. "Nathan, don't tell me you're still taking her side! Look what she did to Rosalind! She's bullied your mother and your—"

Her words struck Nathan like physical blows.

The consequences of his actions three years ago were coming back to haunt him.

He'd believed marrying Evelyn would be enough—that he could keep her like some decorative piece.

For three years, she'd played the perfect wife without complaint.

Even when his mother and sister tormented her.

Even when his entire family treated her with contempt.

She'd endured it all silently.

Never complaining. Never letting him see her pain.

Nathan couldn't fathom how she'd survived it.

Now, divorced, the weight of his mistakes crushed him.

"Aunt Gwendolyn, let me be clear. Evelyn had nothing to do with today. If you go after her, you go through me. And if that happens, Sterling Enterprises cuts all funding to your family."

Gwendolyn nearly choked on her fury.

Her finger shook as she pointed at Nathan, words failing her. "Nathan, that woman has bewitched you!"

"My decision is final. Choose wisely."

Though seething, Gwendolyn knew better than to challenge Nathan. Her family's survival depended on Sterling money.

Without his support, they'd be ruined.

At that moment, Gwendolyn spotted Evelyn standing nearby and shrieked, "You little bitch! How dare you show your face here!"

She lunged, but Nathan intercepted her. "Aunt Gwendolyn, need I remind you?"

Defeated, Gwendolyn slumped against the wall.

Evelyn ignored her, walking straight to Nathan.

Without hesitation, she offered her phone. "The evidence is here."

Nathan didn't take it. He already knew the truth.

"Evelyn... I'm sorry."
###Chapter 276 First Come, First Served

Nathan's voice carried an undeniable weight of resignation.

Some wounds ran too deep for mere words to heal.

Evelyn arched a delicate brow, her lips curving into a knowing smile. "You've done nothing requiring apology, Mr. Sterling."

Nathan shook his head slowly. "This apology comes from the man I used to be."

"Enough, Mr. Sterling."

Evelyn's gaze shifted to Gwendolyn standing nearby. "I intend to see this matter through to its rightful conclusion."

"Understood. You have my full support." Nathan's stance couldn't be clearer.

Gwendolyn's composure shattered. "Nathan! How can you side with this insolent woman? Your own cousin lies injured in that bed!"

Nathan remained unmoved. "We're all accountable for our choices, cousin."

"What exactly has Rosalind done to deserve this? She's the one hospitalized!" Gwendolyn's voice trembled with outrage. "I won't stand by while you persecute an injured girl!"

Evelyn's expression remained glacial. "We won't lay a finger on her. But the authorities might."

On cue, two uniformed officers entered the room.

"We're investigating an incident at the racetrack. Could someone identify Rosalind Blackwell?"

Gwendolyn paled visibly. "What is the meaning of this?"

The lead officer displayed his badge. "Police business, ma'am. We need to question Ms. Blackwell regarding potential criminal charges."

Gwendolyn clutched her forehead dramatically. "I... I feel faint. This is too much..."

Evelyn barely suppressed an eye roll at the transparent theatrics.

With law enforcement present and irrefutable evidence, Rosalind's fate was sealed regardless of her aunt's antics.

Evelyn stretched languidly before approaching Harrison, who'd been waiting patiently. "Shall we depart, Harrison?"

He immediately shrugged off his tailored jacket, draping it over her shoulders. "The evening chill has set in. Wouldn't want you catching cold."

As they turned to leave, Nathan suddenly closed the distance, grasping Evelyn's wrist. "Allow me to drive you home."

Evelyn wrenched free with icy precision. "That won't be necessary, Mr. Sterling. Your family requires your attention here."

Nathan dismissed her refusal with a casual wave. "They can wait."

Undeterred, he matched her stride for stride.

Evelyn quickened her pace, but Nathan clung like persistent shadow.

At the hospital entrance, she finally whirled on him. "Nathan, this ends now."

"Not even close."

Harrison immediately positioned himself as a living barrier between them. The two towering figures crackled with barely restrained tension.

"You're overstepping, Sterling," Harrison warned through gritted teeth.

Nathan didn't flinch.

Retreat now meant permanent defeat in their silent battle for Evelyn's attention.

He'd won her once effortlessly - he'd be damned if he couldn't do it again.

"Tell me, Whitmore," Nathan's smirk held dangerous edge, "are you familiar with the concept of dibs?"
###Chapter 277 The Truth She Owes Him

Harrison let out a cold chuckle. "That depends on who arrived first and who came later."

A flicker of doubt crossed Nathan's piercing gaze.

"What exactly are you implying?"

Harrison didn't mince words. "It's been three years, Nathan. This time, I won't let Evelyn walk back to you."

His declaration hung in the air. Evelyn looked up, sensing she'd missed some unspoken history between them.

Nathan's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Do you really think you stand a chance? Who do you imagine holds the power here, Whitmore?"

Harrison remained unshaken. "Perhaps it was the Sterling family in the past. But times have changed. Test me if you dare, Mr. Sterling."

The tension between them crackled like live wires, each man sizing up the other.

Nathan gave a slow nod, exhilaration flashing in his eyes. It had been years since he'd faced a worthy adversary.

"You want to challenge me? I've never lost anything I set my mind to. I'll take Evelyn back and teach you your place."

Harrison smirked. "That remains to be seen."

Both men turned their attention to Evelyn, waiting for her decision.

Nathan made the first move. "Evelyn, come with me."

Harrison stayed silent, giving her space to choose.

"Mr. Sterling," Evelyn said firmly, "I'm not some trophy to be won. I'm a person—with my own will. Maybe I once cared for you, but those feelings are gone now."

Her gaze shifted to Harrison. A single look conveyed everything.

He would never force her hand.

The childhood promise they'd made—he'd taken it seriously when she'd thought it mere play. Harrison lowered his lashes, hiding the disappointment in his eyes.

Then, unexpectedly, Evelyn stepped toward him.

Gathering her courage, she spoke softly. "Harrison, let's go home."

His head snapped up. The shadows in his eyes cleared as he searched her face.

The girl who'd once followed him everywhere had grown into a strong, independent woman.

And somewhere along the way, his affection for her had taken root and flourished.

"Alright," he said, voice thick. "Let's go home."

He took her hand, holding it like a lifeline, and walked past Nathan without a backward glance.

"Evelyn!" Nathan called after her. "Are you certain about this?"

She didn't respond, her steps growing more resolute with each passing second.

Nathan's fists clenched at his sides. His chest felt hollow.

In the car, Evelyn fidgeted, studying Harrison's profile. Finally, she broke the silence.

"Harrison, about what happened back there—"

"Evie," he interrupted gently, "do you remember what I told you on your eighteenth birthday?"

The question caught her off guard.

Memories surfaced, and a soft smile touched her lips. "You said I never needed to pretend with you. That I could always be myself."

She took a deep breath. "But Harrison, I need you to know—right now, I'm not ready for a relationship."

She couldn't lie to him.

Of all people in the world, he was the last she'd ever deceive.

"I know," Harrison replied, his tone even.

"Don't feel pressured, Evie."
###Chapter 278 Unexpected Turn of Events

Harrison's knuckles turned white as he gripped the steering wheel. His jaw was clenched tight, but his voice remained steady.

"Listen to your heart, Evelyn. Even if you only see me as a brother, that's perfectly fine. Never force yourself into something you're not comfortable with."

Evelyn felt her throat tighten. No one understood her like Harrison did.

She couldn't bear to hurt him.

Maybe it was time to take that leap of faith.

"I understand, Harrison."

A relieved smile tugged at his lips. "I'll have Horizon Technologies send their Dunhill project representative to Kingsley Industries tomorrow. We can sign the contract then."

Evelyn blinked at the sudden shift in conversation.

"Absolutely! I look forward to our partnership, Mr. Whitmore."

The next morning, Horizon's representative arrived at Kingsley Industries before the morning coffee run.

By 10 AM, the contract was signed with elegant fountain pens.

"Mr. Whitmore," Evelyn said with a professional smile, "consider our companies family now. We'll need to support each other through this venture."

Harrison's intense gaze never wavered. "Naturally, Ms. Carter. The Dunhill project requires significant capital and long-term commitment. When shall we schedule our first site visit?"

Evelyn had anticipated this.

"Next week works perfectly. My assistant has already blocked my calendar. Does that suit your schedule?"

Harrison pretended to consider. "I believe I can make that work."

Their shared smile held unspoken promises.

As they stepped out of the conference room, Evelyn couldn't resist. "Harrison, has anyone ever told you how dangerously attractive you look when you're being all businesslike?"

"Flattery won't get you out of doing your job properly, Evelyn."

She nodded enthusiastically. "You can count on me, Mr. Whitmore."

Evelyn personally escorted Harrison through the lobby. At the building's entrance, he stopped abruptly. "Go back inside. No need to walk me out."

"Until next week then," Evelyn agreed, giving a small wave.

Her attention was completely focused on Harrison's retreating figure when the screech of tires shattered the moment.

Evelyn spun around to see a black sedan careening toward her. Her body froze in shock.

"Evelyn! Move!"

Harrison lunged, tackling her to the pavement. They tumbled across the concrete just as metal crunched against stone.

The car plowed into a light pole with a deafening crash. Shattered glass rained down like deadly confetti.

"Screams erupted around them."

"Someone call an ambulance!"

"The driver's trapped inside!"

"Move! Get help!"

Chaos erupted around them. Evelyn lay dazed, the world spinning violently.

"Evelyn! Are you hurt? Talk to me!" Harrison's frantic hands checked her for injuries.

She shook her head weakly. "I'm okay, Harrison."

He helped her up carefully as a crowd gathered.

The scene was catastrophic - twisted metal, broken glass, and smoke curling from the wreckage. The car's front end was completely demolished.

Evelyn frowned at the vehicle. "Harrison... I think I recognize that car."
###Chapter 279 Possible Murder

Harrison's piercing gaze sharpened. With a quick gesture, he motioned for Evelyn to remain frozen in place.

He moved cautiously toward the driver's side.

The figure slumped over the wheel wore a hospital gown - a frail woman with matted hair stained crimson. Her body lay unnaturally still against the leather seat.

When Harrison rolled her over, recognition flashed across his features.

"It's her."

Evelyn's breath hitched as she glimpsed the driver's face.

Rosalind Blackwell.

"How did she escape? Did she just—"

A terrifying possibility took root in Evelyn's mind.

"Was this meant to be my execution?" The words slipped out in a horrified whisper.

The truth crashed over her like icy water. No accident. A calculated murder attempt.

Had Rosalind truly intended to kill her?

Fear coiled tight around Evelyn's throat. The near-miss left her trembling.

Without Harrison's lightning reflexes to shove her to safety, she would've—

Evelyn shut down the thought, but terror lingered in her widened eyes.

Harrison read her expression effortlessly. He closed the distance between them, his voice steadying. "You're safe. I've got you."

His presence alone calmed the storm inside her.

Emergency responders swarmed the scene within minutes - police establishing perimeter tape, firefighters assessing vehicle damage, paramedics rushing to the unconscious woman.

As Kingsley Industries' representative, Evelyn gave her official statement at the precinct.

Harrison remained her silent shadow through every question.

Only afterward did Evelyn notice the dark stain spreading on Harrison's sleeve. She gasped, grabbing his arm.

"Harrison! You're bleeding!"

He attempted to shrug it off. "Just a scratch."

But Evelyn wouldn't be dismissed. "That's no scratch! You've lost a patch of skin!" Her fingers trembled near the wound. "Hospital. Now."

Harrison opened his mouth to protest, but the genuine distress in Evelyn's eyes disarmed him completely.

He surrendered with a nod.

"Doctor, please treat this immediately." Evelyn's voice held barely contained urgency.

Dr. Matthias Whitmore adjusted his glasses, blinking at the coin-sized abrasion. His professional mask slipped when he recognized his patient.

Harrison Whitmore?

The doctor's jaw nearly dropped.

Before Matthias could blurt anything, Harrison gave a subtle shake of his head.

Understanding dawned. Matthias' gaze flicked to Evelyn's worried expression, then back to Harrison. He played along.

"Miss, your boyfriend's injury appears quite severe." His tone turned grave.

Too preoccupied to notice the odd phrasing, Evelyn pressed, "Please doctor, treat him quickly."

Matthias offered reassurances. "No need for alarm. He's in excellent hands."

Then his eyes twinkled at Harrison.

"Miss, you've landed quite the catch. Handsome. Wealthy. The complete package."

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "How would you know he's wealthy?"

Matthias froze mid-sentence.

A cough covered his stumble as he finally took in Evelyn's features. "Wait...you look familiar."

Evelyn tilted her head. "Have we met?"

Recognition flashed across Matthias' face. "Evelyn Carter! Of the Kingsley family!"

Evelyn searched her memory frantically but came up blank. "Do I know you?"

Behind her, Harrison cleared his throat. "Matthias Whitmore. My college roommate. You met him at my graduation party."
###Chapter 280 The Evelyn You've Been Dreaming Of

After the quick introductions, Evelyn flashed a polite smile. "Pleasure meeting you, Dr. Whitmore."

Matthias let out an amused chuckle. "Well, well, Harrison. Coming to the ER for such a minor scrape? People might start thinking you're—"

The confirmation that Harrison wasn't seriously injured made Evelyn exhale in relief.

"Thank goodness it's nothing serious. I appreciate your help, Dr. Whitmore."

Matthias approached with antiseptic and bandages, his movements practiced. "Just a surface wound. Though next time, try not to take impromptu meetings with the pavement."

As he finished dressing the wound, he turned to Evelyn. "All set, Ms. Carter. You can complete the paperwork at reception."

"Of course."

Evelyn turned to leave, her heels clicking against the linoleum floor.

Watching her retreat, Matthias couldn't resist teasing. "If I'm not mistaken, that's the Evelyn you've been mooning over for years, isn't it?"

His tone held the satisfaction of someone who'd just solved a complex puzzle.

He continued, "No wonder you've been single all this time. Your flirting technique needs serious work, my friend."

Harrison cleared his throat, an uncharacteristic hint of vulnerability in his voice. "Got any pointers?"

Matthias's eyebrows shot up. "Is this really the legendary Harrison Whitmore asking for dating advice?"

With a conspiratorial grin, he leaned in. "First rule - be genuine. Though a little strategic vulnerability never hurt anyone."

"That said, she's clearly interested. Put in the effort and seal the deal. We're all waiting for wedding invitations."

When they exited the hospital, Harrison's forearm was wrapped in pristine white gauze.

The injury had been minor, but Matthias had insisted on the dramatic bandaging for effect.

Harrison found it excessive.

He reached to remove it, but Evelyn stopped him. "Harrison, the wound needs to stay covered."

"Try not to get it wet tonight, and have your assistant handle anything strenuous."

Harrison paused, suddenly finding the bandage rather charming.

"Alright, I'll follow doctor's orders."

The wail of an approaching ambulance cut through their conversation.

As the vehicle screeched to a halt, nurses rushed out with a gurney. Evelyn caught a glimpse of the patient's face.

Rosalind.

Their eyes met in silent understanding.

Harrison's expression darkened. "This isn't over."

Rosalind's condition was critical.

Already weakened from the equestrian accident, the car impact had left her in a vegetative state.

Maxwell delivered the news as Evelyn exited her board meeting.

"The police investigation suggests this wasn't an accident," he reported. "They're treating it as attempted homicide. She's under police guard now."

Evelyn's face remained impassive. The development didn't surprise her.

"And the Blackwell family?"

"No movement yet. Nathan's containing the story to protect Sterling Enterprises."

"Have legal handle the fallout."

"Understood, Ms. Carter."

Back in her office, Evelyn turned to business. "The Dunhill project encompasses both crude oil and mining sectors."
###Chapter 281 Rendezvous at the Familiar Spot

"We've finalized our partnership with Horizon Technologies. I'll personally oversee the initial phase of the project." Evelyn's voice carried quiet determination.

"Ms. Carter, shall I accompany you?" Simon inquired.

Evelyn gave a brief nod. "Prepare the core team. When the time comes, you'll all be joining Horizon Technologies on-site."

After confirming the arrangements, Evelyn reached for her phone to message Harrison. The device vibrated unexpectedly in her palm.

Her expression remained impassive as she answered the call from the flashing number.

Nathan's voice crackled through the line. "Evelyn, I hear you've secured a deal with Horizon Technologies."

Her gaze drifted to the cityscape beyond her office window. "Your intelligence network remains impressive, Mr. Sterling."

"Are you certain about choosing them over Sterling Enterprises? Our resources could guarantee your success."

"The decision's made," Evelyn replied coolly. "Further discussion seems unnecessary."

But Nathan wouldn't concede defeat. When had he ever accepted loss?

"The Dunhill venture isn't as straightforward as it appears. If you're traveling there, exercise caution. Should you require assistance—"

"Your concern is misplaced," Evelyn interrupted. "Kingsley Industries has no interest in Sterling's help."

"If you've time to spare, perhaps address your domestic affairs first. Wouldn't want personal complications affecting your business, would we?"

Nathan understood her implication perfectly.

"Rest assured," he vowed, voice thick with conviction. "Those who wronged you won't escape consequences."

A humorless smile touched Evelyn's lips. "Your family drama holds no interest for me. And I've no patience for idle chatter."

The line went dead with a decisive click.

Nathan's grip tightened around his phone, knuckles whitening. Shadows gathered in his stormy gaze.

The office door creaked open.

Isabella entered cautiously. "Nathan? Is everything alright?"

"Out!" The single word cracked like a whip.

His violent tone made her flinch.

Affecting concern, she approached. "Whatever troubles you, we can face it together."

Nathan's fingers closed around her chin with bruising force. "You overestimate your worth."

He shoved her away without ceremony.

"Is there truly no place for me in your heart?" Isabella's voice trembled with desperation. "What of our child? Doesn't that bond mean anything?"

At the mention, Nathan's expression darkened further.

Had it not been for Isabella and that fabricated pregnancy, he and Evelyn wouldn't be in this wretched situation.

"Have I been too lenient?" Nathan's voice dropped dangerously. "Recall my warning. Keep your distance, unless you wish to revisit prison walls."

Isabella's eyes narrowed to slits.

"You're still obsessed with Evelyn? Can't you see she doesn't love you? If she did, would she have left so easily? Wake up, Nathan!"

"Enough!" The roar shook the office walls.

Nathan stormed past her, slamming the door behind him.

Rage burned through Isabella's veins. With shaking hands, she retrieved her phone. After prolonged hesitation, she dialed a memorized number.

"Meet me. The usual place."
###Chapter 282 Wasn't This Supposed to Be Business?

The luxurious penthouse suite was filled with the sounds of passion, the heavy breathing and soft moans echoing off the marble walls.

Isabella Delaney leaned back against the silk headboard, taking a long drag from her cigarette as the smoke curled around her flushed face. Her bare skin still glistened with sweat from their recent activities.

The equally naked man beside her pulled her closer, his fingers tracing idle patterns on her thigh. "It's been too long," he murmured, his voice rough with satisfaction. "Prison didn't do your technique any favors."

She exhaled a perfect smoke ring toward the ceiling. "Enough small talk. I didn't call you here for pleasure."

His low chuckle vibrated against her skin. "Really? Because I distinctly remember us being very serious just now."

Isabella stubbed out her cigarette with more force than necessary. "Nathan is getting suspicious. He doesn't have proof yet, but it's only a matter of time."

The man's wandering hands continued their exploration as he spoke. "No proof means no problem. We just need to be more careful."

With an irritated huff, Isabella slapped his hand away. "I don't care what it takes - I will become Mrs. Sterling. And if I can't, then Evelyn Carter needs to experience exactly what prison life is like."

His fingers gripped her chin, forcing her to meet his amused gaze. "Not very romantic to fantasize about another man in my bed." His thumb traced her lower lip. "You pulled out all the stops to trap Nathan before and failed spectacularly. What makes you think you can succeed now?"

The reminder stung. She had sacrificed everything - her reputation, her family's fortune - and gained nothing but humiliation. Rumor had it her grandfather was still working to repay their debts.

She hadn't dared face her family since her release.

"Marrying Nathan is my only way back to the top," she said through clenched teeth.

The man laughed, the sound devoid of warmth. "Good luck with that."

When he made no move to help, Isabella grabbed his arm with bruising force. "You're refusing to assist me?"

"I can't work miracles, darling. Matters of the heart are beyond even my skills."

"Can't or won't?" Isabella knew him too well for his evasions. She leaned in, cupping his face, and planted a deep, lingering kiss. "Don't worry," she whispered against his lips. "I only want the Sterling name. My body will always belong to you."

His pleased smirk told her she'd chosen the right approach. "At least I didn't waste my time training you." His expression turned serious. "But remember - Nathan didn't build Kingsley Industries by being stupid. Don't get greedy and ruin everything."

"What choice do I have?" Isabella's nails dug into his shoulders. "Without the Sterling name, I'll never be able to compete with that bitch Evelyn."

Seeing her obsession, the man decided to throw her a bone. "Becoming Mrs. Sterling might be impossible, but dealing with a woman? That's simple." He traced her collarbone. "I hear Dominic Kingsley is negotiating a project in Dunhill, and Ms. Carter will be joining him soon."

"Dunhill is lawless territory." Isabella's eyes gleamed with sudden interest. "People disappear there every day."

"Exactly." His smile turned predatory. "Though I suspect you don't want her dead just yet?"

Isabella's lips curved into a cruel smile. "Death would be too kind. I want her behind bars, suffering exactly as I did. I want to break her slowly, piece by piece."

"Is that all?" He seemed almost disappointed by her restraint.

"Getting her arrested should be simple enough," he continued. "Just arrange for her to be caught with something... incriminating. Make sure it's serious enough that even the Kingsley influence can't sweep it under the rug."

His fingers tangled in her hair. "Once she's in the system, she'll be at your mercy. Prison has ways of making even the strongest women beg for death."

Isabella's delighted laugh filled the room as she rolled atop him. "Now that's what I call serious business."
###Chapter 283 The Invisible Woman

Isabella's eyes sparkled with sudden inspiration. "Tell me, darling. Do you have any brilliant plans?"

The man loomed over her, pressing her into the mattress as his voice dropped to a seductive whisper. "If you want my secrets, you'll have to earn them first."

What followed was another hour of passionate moans and tangled sheets.

At dawn, Evelyn had already packed her luggage. Just as she was about to leave, her phone buzzed with Dominic's call.

"Evie, I heard you're heading to Dunhill."

Evelyn sighed, knowing her brother's intelligence network was impeccable. "Yes, Harrison's coming with me."

"I've got a contact there. Call him if you need anything."

She hummed in response. "Thanks Dom, but I'm not your little girl anymore. I can handle myself."

Dominic's protective instincts kicked in. "Is Maxwell joining you?"

"He's taking the later flight with the team. We'll regroup tomorrow."

This seemed to reassure him somewhat. With Harrison and Maxwell watching over her, the risks were manageable.

"Listen," his voice turned serious. "I know you've always been independent. But Dunhill's security is questionable. I'm increasing your protection detail."

"I know, Dom."

As she spoke, Evelyn spotted Harrison approaching in the distance.

She waved at him before continuing. "Relax, Harrison's got this. Talk later." Hanging up, she hurried toward the waiting billionaire.

"Harrison."

With practiced ease, he took her suitcase, passing it to his assistant before interlacing their fingers. They boarded the private jet together.

Five hours later, the plane touched down at Dunhill Airport. The local partners from Sterling Enterprises had arranged for their reception.

Emerging through VIP security, they were greeted by a group holding a massive sign in Kidhnian: "Welcome to Dunhill, Ms. Carter & Mr. Whitmore!"

Evelyn approached, conversing fluently in Eliganese. "Sterling Enterprises?"

A young man in his twenties brightened. "Ms. Carter?"

At her nod, he guided them through a private corridor. "I'm Colton, assistant to Director Chambers. She's been waiting in the car. We'll take you to the hotel first to recover from jet lag. Business meetings can wait until tomorrow."

Evelyn approved of the arrangements.

Exiting the airport, they spotted a striking blonde in a tailored pantsuit. The woman's blue eyes skimmed over Evelyn before locking onto Harrison with predatory interest.

"Mr. Whitmore, what an honor."

Evelyn might as well have been invisible.

Harrison's eyebrow arched. He deliberately stepped closer to Evelyn. "This is Ms. Carter, President of Kingsley Industries and lead on our joint venture."

Only then did the woman acknowledge Evelyn's existence. "Vivienne Chambers. A pleasure."

"The pleasure's mine," Evelyn replied coolly, already disliking the woman's calculated smile.
###Chapter 284 Unequal Hospitality

Evelyn Carter exchanged polite smiles with Vivienne Chambers, though her gaze kept drifting toward Harrison Whitmore.

"I must say, Mr. Whitmore, we're honored by your personal attendance this visit. Sterling Enterprises extends its warmest welcome. The journey must have been exhausting - shall I escort you to your accommodations first?"

Harrison's expression turned stormy. "Appreciated, Ms. Chambers," he replied curtly.

Two sleek black limousines pulled up abruptly. Vivienne gestured toward Evelyn.

"After you, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn gave a slight nod. As she slid into the plush leather seat, Harrison immediately claimed the space beside her.

Turning to Vivienne, he stated firmly, "Ms. Carter and I will share this vehicle."

Vivienne's jaw tightened.

Her smile faltered momentarily before she regained composure. "Of course, Mr. Whitmore. I'll follow in the second car."

The door clicked shut as the limousine glided away.

Evelyn bit her lip playfully. "Harrison, Ms. Chambers clearly wanted to ride with you. Aren't you worried about bruising her ego?"

Harrison turned, his fingers brushing through her silken hair.

"What nonsense fills that pretty head of yours?" His voice held amused exasperation.

Evelyn suppressed a giggle. Seeing Harrison so serious was a rare sight.

Teasingly, she pressed further. "But Vivienne's stunning. Doesn't she... affect you at all?"

"Not even slightly," came his immediate, icy response.

Evelyn's heart soared. Suddenly even the breeze through the window felt sweeter.

Her good mood evaporated upon reaching the hotel. The building's faded grandeur suggested better days long past, its decor frozen in time a decade ago.

Vivienne emerged from the trailing vehicle. "Mr. Whitmore, Ms. Carter, shall we?"

Evelyn prided herself on adaptability, but Vivienne's next words stunned her.

"This is our region's finest establishment. We hope you'll find it comfortable."

Finest? This?

Evelyn questioned every life choice that led her here.

Harrison noticed her hesitation. "Unacceptable?"

She shook her head. Business trips required flexibility, even when standards fell short.

Her optimism shattered upon entering the assigned room.

A sagging wooden bed dominated the space, its yellowed linens faintly musty.

Evelyn felt her composure cracking.

"Ms. Carter, here's your key card," Vivienne said sweetly, then turned to Harrison. "Mr. Whitmore, your suite is on the penthouse level. Allow me to show you."

Harrison gave Evelyn a reassuring glance before following Vivienne out.

Alone, Evelyn conducted a thorough inspection.

The yellowing wasn't limited to the bedding - curtains bore water stains, windows showed weather damage.

"Just a few nights," she muttered, taking deep calming breaths.

"Right this way, Mr. Whitmore." Vivienne led Harrison to a sprawling penthouse rivaling Kingsley Industries' corporate suites.

Facing the opulent space, Harrison's eyes darkened dangerously. "Is this your idea of equitable hospitality, Ms. Chambers?"

His tone carried unmistakable accusation.

Vivienne's smile never wavered. "We only maintain two premium suites, Mr. Whitmore. I'm occupying the other."
###Chapter 285 Terrified of a Rodent

"Mr. Whitmore, this is the only available suite left for you."

Vivienne Chambers flashed a coquettish smile as she produced a keycard from her designer handbag. Her heavily-lashed eyes lingered on Harrison's chiseled profile before sliding the card across the counter toward him.

With a deliberate wink, she purred, "I'll be right next door if you'd like to... discuss business proposals more thoroughly."

Before Harrison could respond, she sauntered away, her hips swaying with each calculated step.

Harrison glanced at the keycard with distaste. Without hesitation, he tossed it into the nearest trash bin. His fingers were already dialing Evelyn's number when-

"Harrison!"

Evelyn came barreling down the hallway, her suitcase abandoned mid-stride as she launched herself into his arms. Her entire body trembled against his chest.

"There's a-a..." Her voice quivered uncontrollably.

Harrison took in her wide, frightened eyes and pale complexion - she looked like a startled fawn. An amused smirk tugged at his lips. "Looks like you'll be sharing my suite tonight."

Evelyn nodded so vigorously her ponytail bounced.

"Just a little mouse, sweetheart. Nothing to-"

"Little?" Evelyn squeaked, breaking away to gesture wildly. "That thing was the size of a small dog!"

Her indignant pout faded as she took in the luxurious surroundings of Harrison's suite. The stark contrast to her own accommodations made her want to weep.

"Harrison Whitmore, this is blatant favoritism!"

"Fine," he conceded with mock exasperation. "Take the master bedroom. I'll sleep on the sofa."

Evelyn nodded eagerly, practically skipping as she closed the bedroom door behind her. Harrison handed her plush slippers and wheeled her suitcase inside.

The moment Evelyn collapsed onto the king-sized bed, she melted into the Egyptian cotton sheets with a contented sigh. "This is heaven," she murmured, hugging a pillow to her chest.

After luxuriating for several minutes, she grabbed her silk pajamas and headed for the marble ensuite bathroom.

By the time she emerged, steam curling around her from the shower, exhaustion weighed heavily on her limbs. She yawned, towel-drying her hair as she entered the living area where Harrison still worked on his laptop.

He snapped it shut the moment he saw her. Taking in her drowsy expression, he rose and gently took the towel from her hands. "Lie down. I'll take care of this."

Evelyn obediently settled onto the sofa, her head naturally finding its place in his lap as if they'd done this a thousand times before. Harrison's fingers moved methodically through her damp locks with the hair dryer.

By the time her hair was fully dried, soft snores escaped Evelyn's slightly parted lips. Harrison carefully unplugged the dryer, setting it aside before gazing down at her peaceful expression.

He leaned down, brushing his lips against her forehead in a feather-light kiss. "Sweet dreams, Evie," he whispered.

Morning sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows when Evelyn finally stirred. She stretched luxuriously before padding to the window to admire the cityscape glittering below.

Harrison had already arranged breakfast on the terrace. Spotting her sleepy form, he guided her toward the bathroom. "Freshen up first, then we'll eat."

Evelyn blinked at her reflection, fragments of last night returning - the shower, Harrison drying her hair... But how had she ended up in that magnificent bed?
###Chapter 286 Could She Really Be a Kingsley?

The moment Evelyn realized she was alone with Harrison in the suite, heat rushed to her cheeks.

She didn't need to ask how she'd gotten there - the answer was obvious in the way Harrison's arms still seemed to linger around her memory.

"Oh God," she groaned into her palms, suddenly too aware of his presence beside her. Without a word of explanation, she practically shoved him out the door.

Harrison looked utterly bewildered but complied with an amused shake of his head.

By the time Evelyn finished her morning routine, Harrison had disappeared. She exhaled deeply before settling at the breakfast table, determined to focus on her meal.

The doorbell's chime interrupted her halfway through.

"Harrison, did you forget your-" Evelyn's question died on her lips as she swung the door open.

Vivienne Chambers stood frozen in the hallway, her manicured fingers trembling as they pointed accusingly. "You... you spent the night here?"

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning innocence. "Is that a problem?"

"Where is Mr. Whitmore?" Vivienne demanded through gritted teeth.

"He's not here," Evelyn shrugged. "Was there something you needed, Ms. Chambers?"

Vivienne's voice turned icy. "We're departing shortly, Ms. Carter. Don't keep everyone waiting."

The door slammed shut with enough force to make Evelyn blink in surprise.

Downstairs, the entire delegation had already assembled.

Maxwell Donovan approached respectfully. "Ms. Carter."

Evelyn gave a slight nod. "Good morning."

Her gaze then found Harrison, and she waved casually, the awkwardness of last night momentarily forgotten.

Vivienne's lips pressed into a thin line as she watched their exchange.

But with Harrison present, she forced her features into professional calm.

"Mr. Whitmore, our schedule today includes meetings at Sterling Enterprises this morning," Vivienne said sweetly, the perfect picture of corporate efficiency.

Harrison merely nodded before moving to Evelyn's side. "Shall we, Evie?"

Evelyn fell into step beside him, Harrison automatically adjusting his stride to match hers. Their effortless synchronization spoke volumes.

Vivienne's nails dug into her palms.

"Ms. Chambers, who exactly is this Ms. Carter? Mr. Whitmore seems... different around her," whispered Giselle Thornton, Vivienne's assistant.

Vivienne scoffed. "Just some nobody. Speaking of which, did you find anything in your background check?"

"Nothing substantial," Giselle admitted. "But she appears connected to the Kingsley family."

"The Kingsleys?" Vivienne's eyes widened. "The Kingsley Industries Kingsleys?"

"It's impossible," Giselle dismissed. "The Kingsleys only have one daughter, raised in absolute luxury. Why would she be working as some random assistant?"

Vivienne nodded in agreement. What wealthy heiress would choose a career over a life of pampered privilege?
###Chapter 287 No Deal Without Me

"Perhaps it's merely a coincidence she shares the Kingsley surname."

"Exactly. Look at her. Does she appear to be some privileged heiress?"

Vivienne Chambers glanced in that direction and nodded in agreement with Giselle.

"Never mind. She's not my focus today."

Giselle smiled knowingly. "Of course, Ms. Chambers. I'm aware Mr. Whitmore is your primary objective."

Vivienne hummed in acknowledgment, not bothering to deny it.

Giselle leaned in conspiratorially. "Mr. Whitmore is such an exceptional catch. You must secure him, Ms. Chambers. Men of his caliber are rare. Landing him would be a monumental social triumph."

Vivienne tossed her hair arrogantly. "Naturally. Men might dabble with innocent types occasionally, but what they truly desire is sophistication and allure. I have no doubt I'll captivate him."

With that declaration, she confidently followed the group.

The team boarded a luxury van to Sterling Enterprises. As Dunhill's premier corporation, its headquarters radiated opulence.

A banner at the entrance proclaimed: "Welcome Ms. Kingsley and Mr. Whitmore to Sterling Enterprises."

When they disembarked, cheers erupted from the assembled crowd. They escorted Evelyn Carter and Harrison Whitmore into the gleaming lobby.

"Mr. Whitmore, our conference room is on the penthouse level. Please follow me." Vivienne positioned herself beside Harrison, her demeanor dripping with calculated charm.

Evelyn moved to join them but found her path blocked by Giselle. "Ms. Kingsley, let's take the next elevator."

Evelyn's brow furrowed in displeasure.

The doors slid shut before Harrison noticed Evelyn's absence. "Where's Evelyn?" he asked Maxwell.

Maxwell responded quickly, "She must have missed this one. Shall I check?"

Vivienne interjected smoothly, "The elevator was at capacity. Not to worry—my assistant remained behind too. She'll escort Ms. Kingsley up shortly."

Harrison said nothing as they proceeded to the top floor where Donovan Prescott, Sterling's CEO, awaited them in the conference room.

Meanwhile, when Evelyn arrived upstairs, the meeting was already underway.

Giselle intercepted her at the doors. "Ms. Kingsley, the discussions have begun. Interrupting now would be inappropriate. Perhaps you'd prefer to wait in the lounge?"

Evelyn's patience finally snapped.

Her voice turned icy. "Is this your decision, or Sterling Enterprises' official policy?"

Giselle maintained her professional mask. "Merely a courtesy, Ms. Kingsley. The executives are deep in negotiations. An interruption could derail—"

"So you took it upon yourself to exclude me?"

Giselle gave a practiced nod. "I'm considering what's best for this partnership."

Evelyn's eyes flashed with determination. "Then understand this—if I'm not in that room within sixty seconds, there will be no partnership to consider."

Giselle's lips curled in derision. "Ms. Kingsley, are you truly that delusional? Do you honestly believe a multi-billion dollar deal hinges on your presence?"
###Chapter 288 Evelyn's Disappearance

Evelyn's lips curled into a mocking smile, her eyes glinting with dangerous intensity.

"Even an executive assistant dares to act this arrogantly. It makes me question Sterling Enterprises' sincerity."

She leaned closer, her voice dropping to a lethal whisper. "But let me give you some friendly advice - if you dare to make a move, be prepared to face the consequences."

Without waiting for a response, Evelyn spun on her heel and strode away.

Giselle barely suppressed an eye roll. She'd dealt with countless entitled women trying to intimidate her during her corporate career. Evelyn's threats meant nothing.

Exiting Sterling Enterprises' headquarters, Evelyn slid into the backseat of her waiting car. She pulled out her phone, absently scrolling through a mobile game.

Meanwhile, an oppressive silence had fallen over the boardroom.

Harrison sat motionless at the head of the table, his thunderous expression making the temperature seem to drop several degrees. Donovan Prescott discreetly wiped his damp palms on his trousers.

"Mr. Whitmore," Donovan ventured cautiously, "are there any concerns regarding our proposed collaboration?"

Harrison didn't answer.

His gaze dropped to his platinum wristwatch.

Twenty-three minutes. Evelyn should have arrived by now.

The heavy doors burst open as Maxwell rushed in, his face tight with concern. "Sir, Ms. Carter isn't in the building. Security confirms she left nearly twenty minutes ago."

Harrison was on his feet before Maxwell finished speaking. He was already dialing as he strode toward the exit, leaving bewildered executives in his wake.

Vivienne scrambled after him. "Mr. Whitmore! We haven't concluded our meeting—"

He ignored her completely. The persistent ringing on the other end of the line made his jaw clench.

Evelyn never ignored his calls. Never disappeared without notice. Something was wrong.

"Have you seen Evelyn?" Harrison demanded abruptly.

Vivienne's breath hitched. She'd only instructed Giselle to delay Evelyn's entry to the meeting. She hadn't anticipated Harrison's intense reaction.

"I—I came straight here with you," Vivienne stammered. "How would I know where Ms. Carter went?"

Harrison jabbed the elevator button, his expression turning glacial.

"Mr. Whitmore, if something's happened to Ms. Carter, perhaps I can—"

"Unnecessary." The single word carried finality.

As the elevator doors closed, Vivienne whirled around to find Giselle. "What the hell did you do?"

Giselle whispered frantically, and Vivienne's face drained of color.

"I told you to stall her, not chase her out of the building!"

"You said to handle it, Ms. Chambers!" Giselle protested.

Vivienne's manicured nails dug into her palms. "Harrison just abandoned a multimillion-dollar negotiation to look for her. This isn't some random assistant we're dealing with."

Realization dawned on Giselle's face, followed by sheer panic.

If this got out, her career at Sterling Enterprises was over.

"What do I do? I may have...insulted her."

"You incompetent fool!" Vivienne hissed. "If this gets traced back to us—"

Giselle clutched at Vivienne's sleeve desperately. "Please, you have to help me!"

"Stop making a scene!" Vivienne snapped, shaking her off.

Giselle's voice turned pleading. "Ms. Chambers, if you help me now, I'll owe you everything."
###Chapter 289 Harrison's Protection

Vivienne stayed quiet, but her mind raced with questions about Harrison and Evelyn's relationship.

A sharp rap sounded against the car window.

Evelyn glanced up to find Harrison standing outside the vehicle. He'd materialized like a phantom from thin air.

Her fingers flew across the phone screen, locked in an intense mobile game battle.

Deliberately ignoring him, she focused on the game. Her thumbs moved with practiced precision, delivering the final blow to her opponent.

When "VICTORY" flashed across her screen, she finally set the phone down and opened the car door.

"Harrison."

Her pressed lips betrayed her irritation.

His expression softened instantly. "What's wrong? Why are you gaming in the car?"

Evelyn shrugged. "What do you think? Someone decided I wasn't worthy of attending the meeting."

Harrison's face darkened like a thundercloud.

"If that's how they treat our people, we're done here." He slid into the car and ordered the driver to leave.

As the car pulled away, Evelyn watched the cityscape blur past the window. A warm feeling spread through her chest - it felt good to have someone in her corner.

"Harrison, that deal was worth millions. You're really walking away just like that?"

He reached over and tousled her hair. "No contract is worth your dignity."

Evelyn's heart fluttered at his words.

"You're making me blush. Though I feel bad for Adrian - he worked so hard to set this up."

A flicker of jealousy crossed Harrison's features before he schooled his expression.

"I can negotiate deals too. A few million is nothing. I'll pay whatever they ask. But don't mention other men around me again."

Evelyn blinked, surprised by his possessiveness.

"Since when did you become so territorial?"

Harrison didn't hesitate. "Every man becomes territorial when it comes to the woman he loves."

Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed. Heat flooded her cheeks.

The woman he loved?

His words cast some kind of spell over her.

"What nonsense are you spouting?" she protested, turning away to hide the smile tugging at her lips.

The moment shattered when Harrison's phone rang.

"Mr. Whitmore, where did you go?" Maxwell's voice came through the speaker.

"Cancel the Sterling Enterprises partnership," Harrison stated flatly.

Maxwell hesitated. "Sir, may I ask why-"

Harrison ended the call without explanation.

Donovan approached cautiously. "Mr. Donovan, what's happening? Where did Mr. Whitmore and Ms. Carter go? Is the meeting still on?"

Maxwell offered a knowing smile. "Mr. Whitmore said someone offended Ms. Carter. When she's unhappy, he's unhappy. And when he's unhappy, deals get canceled."

Leaving Donovan gaping, Maxwell led his team out.

Donovan staggered back, nearly collapsing before his secretary caught him.
###Chapter 290 Partnership Terminated

The moment Maxwell Donovan's team exited the boardroom, Donovan Prescott's carefully maintained composure shattered like glass. "What in God's name just happened?" His voice boomed across the silent office, making several employees flinch. "Which incompetent fool offended Ms. Carter? Speak now!"

The entire floor froze under his wrath. Vivienne Chambers had never witnessed her boss in such a state - veins bulging at his temples, his usually impeccable tie now askew. She clutched her tablet like a shield.

"Mr. Prescott," his assistant rushed forward, tablet in hand. "Security footage shows someone intercepted Ms. Carter outside Conference Room B."

Donovan's face turned an alarming shade of crimson. "Who dares block the path of Pamore's CFO?"

The assistant's finger trembled as it pointed toward Giselle Thornton.

All eyes swiveled to the ashen-faced assistant. Someone in the crowd gave her a shove, sending her sprawling across the marble floor.

Ignoring the pain shooting through her knees, Giselle scrambled forward. "Mr. Prescott, it was a terrible misunderstanding! I thought she was—"

A polished Oxford connected sharply with her shoulder. "You thought?" Donovan's voice dripped venom. "What exactly did you think? That the CFO of Pamore Group would come dressed as a damn intern? Get your worthless ass to the HR department!"

"Please, Mr. Prescott!" Tears streaked Giselle's carefully applied makeup. "I'll make this right. I'll find Ms. Carter and—"

"Save your breath," Donovan snarled, already dialing his phone. "You've got until sunset to fix this, or start cleaning out your desk."

The moment Giselle fled, Donovan's glare swept across his cowering staff. "Why are you all still here? Get back to work before I fire the whole damn department!"

Chairs screeched as employees dove for their workstations like rats abandoning ship.

Meanwhile, Evelyn Carter had just entered her penthouse suite when her phone lit up with Donovan's caller ID.

"Ms. Carter," his oily voice oozed through the speaker, "today's incident was an unfortunate oversight by an inexperienced employee. Surely we can—"

"An oversight?" Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "Your employee physically barred me from my own meeting, Mr. Prescott. Is this how Sterling Enterprises treats potential partners?"

"I've already disciplined that idiot assistant. Name your terms—her immediate termination if you wish. Our collaboration is too valuable to—"

"Our collaboration," Evelyn cut in icily, "ended the moment your security demanded my ID like some corporate bouncer. Goodbye, Mr. Prescott."

The call disconnected with finality.

Harrison Whitmore appeared at her elbow, offering a crystal glass of freshly pressed pomegranate juice. "Background checks are complete. There's another firm in Dunhill with comparable assets to Sterling Enterprises."

His lips curved. "Interestingly, they've been Sterling's primary competitor for the past decade. Imagine Donovan's face when he learns we've chosen them."

Evelyn accepted the glass, the ice cubes clinking softly. "Then it's settled. Have contracts drawn up by morning." She took a slow sip, watching the city lights twinkle through the floor-to-ceiling windows. "Let's see how Donovan enjoys being the one left waiting outside the boardroom."
###Chapter 291 Nobody Insults Evelyn

Harrison moved swiftly. Both Kingsley Industries and Horizon Technologies simultaneously announced the termination of their partnerships with Sterling Enterprises.

For a moment, Sterling Enterprises was completely thrown into chaos.

Vivienne stared at the pandemonium in the company, struggling to comprehend that all this destruction had been caused by one woman - Evelyn Carter.

Her hands trembled as she pulled out her phone to call Adrian, their frequent business contact.

"Mr. Prescott?"

Adrian, unaware of the storm brewing in Dunhill, answered politely, "Ms. Chambers, how's our collaboration progressing?"

Vivienne ignored his question. "Mr. Prescott, I need to ask you something. Is Ms. Carter some kind of special VIP?"

Adrian's tone immediately shifted. "What happened, Ms. Chambers? Explain yourself."

Vivienne bit her lip before confessing, "Kingsley Industries and Horizon Technologies have both severed ties with us."

The silence on the other end was deafening.

When Adrian finally spoke, his voice was laced with barely contained fury. "What the hell did you do? You'd better have a damn good explanation for this."

Vivienne immediately threw Evelyn under the bus. "It's all Evelyn's fault! My assistant accidentally offended her, and she canceled our multi-million dollar partnerships over it!"

Adrian's explosion was instantaneous. "Wait - you're telling me you pissed off Evelyn Carter? Do you have any idea who she is? You absolute fool! You deserve to lose those contracts!"

"But Mr. Prescott-"

Adrian cut her off mercilessly. "Let me make this crystal clear. You could insult anyone else, even me, and it wouldn't matter. But Evelyn? Cross her and you sign your own death warrant."

"Losing those contracts is the least of your problems. If anything happens to Evelyn because of this, I'll personally ensure Sterling Enterprises ceases to exist."

The line went dead.

Vivienne stood frozen, the dial tone echoing in her ears. A cold dread seeped into her bones.

Just how powerful was this Evelyn woman?

Even Adrian Prescott feared crossing her, yet Vivienne had stupidly provoked her.

She wanted to slap herself.

But it was too late for regrets.

The deals were gone. Giselle had been fired. Vivienne herself had been demoted from director to junior employee.

Her entire world had collapsed in a single day.

Meanwhile, Evelyn lounged in her hotel suite, engrossed in a mobile tower defense game she'd recently become obsessed with.

As she completed a level, Harrison approached. "I've assigned Maxwell to handle the Sterling Enterprises fallout."

"The CEO of Summit Corporation - Sterling's main competitor - has already reached out. They're eager to finalize partnership details."

Evelyn nodded without looking up. "Efficient as always, Harrison. Let's move forward with Summit."

"They've arranged a mine tour this afternoon. Will you be joining?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Sure, why not?" Her fingers never stopped moving across the screen as she started another game.
###Chapter 292 The Mine Inspection Tour

Geoffrey Lockhart, CEO of Summit Corporation, had been standing at the hotel entrance since noon, eagerly awaiting their arrival.

The moment Evelyn Carter stepped out, he bowed respectfully. "Ms. Carter, I'm Geoffrey Lockhart, president of Summit Corporation. This is my card."

"Welcome to Dunhill, and thank you for choosing our company."

Evelyn gave a slight nod as she accepted the embossed golden business card.

The name "Geoffrey" shimmered under the afternoon sun.

Her lips curved into a polite smile. "Mr. Lockhart, your reputation precedes you."

"You flatter me, Ms. Carter." Geoffrey gestured toward the waiting limousine. "Shall we?"

"After you, Ms. Carter and Mr. Whitmore!"

Evelyn slid into the plush leather seat beside Harrison Whitmore.

During the scenic drive, Geoffrey played the perfect host, pointing out landmarks and local specialties until the mining complex came into view.

"Ms. Carter," Geoffrey began hesitantly, "though Dunhill may seem unremarkable, our mining, agriculture, and farming industries are quite advanced. Today we'll tour the mines first, then visit our flagship farm tomorrow."

"Thank you for the thoughtful arrangement, Mr. Lockhart." Evelyn exited the vehicle with Harrison.

The landscape stretched before them - barren except for towering mineral deposits dotting the horizon.

Miners moved with practiced efficiency, some descending into the earth's depths for their shifts.

Geoffrey handed Evelyn a safety helmet. "Caution is paramount underground, Ms. Carter."

He passed another helmet to Harrison.

"Shall we begin with the primary shaft?"

Geoffrey led them through winding tunnels, enthusiastically explaining each mine's operations.

Evelyn witnessed firsthand the miners' grueling labor - especially the coal workers emerging from below.

Their faces were blackened with soot, only their eyes visible as they hauled heavy baskets up steep mine stairs.

"What's their typical shift length?" Evelyn inquired.

Geoffrey answered promptly, "Our frontline workers endure twelve-hour shifts minimum. The pay reflects their hardship though."

His expression turned solemn. "Underground work carries substantial risks. Most miners are single men willing to gamble their safety for higher wages."

The harsh realities of their lives weighed heavily in the air.

Evelyn's heart ached with newfound understanding.

"There's a lounge ahead where we can rest and enjoy some local tea."

Evelyn remained quiet, lost in thought.

Harrison's arm slipped around her shoulders. "What troubles you, love?"

She blinked, returning to the present. "It's nothing. I just... never realized how brutally difficult their lives are."

Harrison squeezed her gently. "Society functions through different roles, darling. Don't burden yourself."

"I know, Harrison." She managed a small smile.

"Come, let's take that break." Harrison guided her toward the miners' lounge.

Geoffrey personally prepared their tea using leaves famous throughout the region.

The fragrant brew left a pleasantly sweet aftertaste.

Setting down her cup, Evelyn whispered to Harrison, "Excuse me, I need the ladies' room."
Here's the rewritten version with all the requested changes:

###Chapter 293 An Extensive Search

Evelyn stood up gracefully, excusing herself to visit the restroom.

Unbeknownst to her, several pairs of watchful eyes tracked her solitary movement across the lounge.

The moment she disappeared around the corner, shadowy figures moved swiftly in her direction.

"Mr. Whitmore," the executive leaned forward, "aside from Sterling Enterprises, only Summit Corporation has the resources to handle this million-dollar venture with you and Ms. Carter. What are your thoughts?"

Harrison maintained his composed demeanor, though Summit was indeed their strongest potential partner.

"This collaboration impacts all three corporations significantly," he responded carefully. "We must proceed with utmost caution."

"After thorough due diligence, we'll develop comprehensive risk assessments before further negotiations."

His measured words revealed nothing, leaving the other party guessing.

Geoffrey Lockhart, seasoned in business dealings, recognized Harrison's strategic maneuvering.

"Naturally! Slow and steady wins the race," Geoffrey agreed. "But rest assured, Summit Corporation won't disappoint."

Their conversation continued, but Harrison's attention wandered.

His wristwatch caught his eye - Evelyn had been gone too long. Without apology, he abruptly stood and strode toward the restrooms.

Geoffrey scrambled after him. "Mr. Whitmore? Is everything alright?"

Harrison's long strides didn't slow. "Evelyn's been absent nearly twenty minutes."

Observing Harrison's tense posture, realization dawned on Geoffrey. This level of concern suggested more than professional interest.

"Don't worry," Geoffrey assured, "Our mining complex is completely secure. Perhaps Ms. Carter simply got turned around?"

Harrison didn't entertain the suggestion. His gut screamed danger.

He burst into the women's restroom without hesitation. "Evelyn? Are you here?"

Empty stalls confirmed his worst fears.

Harrison's grip on Geoffrey turned vice-like. "Are there other facilities nearby?"

"None closer than this," Geoffrey admitted, forehead beading with sweat. "She couldn't have just vanished..."

Harrison's phone was already at his ear. "Lock down every exit. No one enters or leaves until we find her. Tear this place apart if necessary."

Geoffrey mobilized his own security team. "Find Ms. Carter immediately! Search every inch of the property!"

As men scattered in all directions, Geoffrey wiped his damp palms. This security breach could cost him everything.

"Mr. Whitmore, I'm certain-"

Harrison cut him off with a glare, already moving to personally join the search.

One agonizing hour later, the sprawling mining complex had yielded no trace of Evelyn.

Geoffrey's confidence wavered. "We've checked everywhere... perhaps she left voluntarily?"

Harrison ignored the suggestion, forcing himself to think clearly despite the panic clawing at his chest.

###Chapter 294 In the Face of Danger

Harrison pulled up Evelyn's last known location on his encrypted tracking app.

The signal had died precisely fifty-three minutes ago - deep within the mine's perimeter.

"Expand the search," he commanded. "She's still here. Don't return without her."

His next call summoned Dominic Kingsley.

Within thirty minutes, the sky roared with approaching helicopters. Dominic and Julian arrived with a specialized extraction team, their fleet of private aircraft painting an impressive display against the dusk sky.

Even Geoffrey, accustomed to corporate extravagance, gaped at the military-grade response. Who exactly was Evelyn Carter?

Dominic's operatives moved with lethal precision, deploying search dogs and advanced scanning equipment.

After a rapid briefing, the three men exchanged grim nods, dividing sectors without needing words.

"Julian," Dominic ordered, "take Team Two and sweep a five-mile radius from the mine's center."

Julian moved instantly to execute the command.

But Dunhill's sparse surveillance infrastructure made their task infinitely harder than in Pamore.

After combing the designated area, they reconvened empty-handed.

Harrison's composure cracked. "Where the hell is she?"

Geoffrey hesitantly approached. "We've searched everywhere except... the active mining shafts."

Harrison's eyes blazed with renewed determination. "Then that's where we're going."

Geoffrey physically blocked his path. "Those tunnels are unstable! Without proper training-"

Dominic shouldered past him. "We're going."

Julian's expression turned deadly. "I'll burn Dunhill to the ground if that's what it takes."

Stunned into silence, Geoffrey could only watch as the three prepared to descend.

After analyzing the search patterns, Dominic concluded, "No trace within five miles means she didn't leave. She's down there."

Harrison changed into protective gear and rappelled into the shaft first, followed closely by Dominic and Julian.

The labyrinthine tunnels twisted dangerously, oxygen growing thinner with each descent. One wrong step could send them plunging into darkness.

Yet they pressed forward without hesitation, calling Evelyn's name until their voices grew hoarse.

Eight shafts searched. Eight dead ends.

Ten hours since her disappearance, the exhausted trio emerged under cover of night, their usually impeccable appearances reduced to dust-covered exhaustion.

"Mr. Whitmore, Mr. Kingsley," a security officer reported, "we've found nothing in eight shafts. Could she have-"

Julian cut him off. "Our network has every exit covered for ten miles in every direction. She didn't leave."
###Chapter 295 Divine Intervention Favors the Bold

"Keep looking. Two more mines remain. If she's not there, we'll mobilize military forces," Dominic commanded with steel in his voice.

Julian sprang to his feet, exhaustion forgotten, and marched toward the ninth mine shaft with renewed determination.

Fortune favors the brave.

At precisely 3:17 am, Harrison's flashlight beam finally illuminated Evelyn's unconscious form in the deepest chamber.

Dehydration and oxygen deprivation had taken their toll after twelve grueling hours. Her vital signs were dangerously unstable.

Harrison cradled her against his chest. Step by agonizing step, he ascended the treacherous mine shaft, carrying Evelyn toward salvation.

A medical team stood ready at the entrance. The moment they emerged, doctors whisked Evelyn away for emergency treatment.

The waiting room clock ticked mercilessly as Dominic and Julian paced like caged predators.

Though physically spent from the all-night search, adrenaline kept them razor-focused on Evelyn's condition.

"Whoever did this to Evie won't live to see sunrise!" Julian slammed his fist against the wall, eyes blazing with fury.

Dominic remained silent, studying Harrison's hollow expression across the room. "Harrison," he asked quietly, "think carefully. Any enemies? Recent conflicts?"

Their gazes locked like crossed blades.

"Summit Corporation," Harrison spat through clenched teeth.

The terminated partnership had clearly provoked retaliation.

Without hesitation, Harrison issued the order that would become Summit's death sentence.

"I want their stock worthless by market close."

Dominic and Julian exchanged glances - this punishment seemed inadequate.

"Bankruptcy can't erase what Evelyn endured today."

Harrison's smile held no warmth. "Consider this the opening move."

Recognizing the dangerous glint in his eyes, the brothers deferred to Harrison's judgment.

Within the hour, Donovan Prescott was dragged before them, collapsing to his knees.

"Mr. Whitmore, I swear on my life - Summit had no involvement in Ms. Carter's disappearance! Name your price, just spare my company!"

Harrison remained unmoved. "If not you, then who?"

Donovan shook his head violently. "Investigate thoroughly! I'll stake my reputation - Summit is completely innocent!"

As if on cue, Harrison's security team arrived with new information.

"Sir, we've identified them!"

All three men straightened like drawn swords.

"Report."

"Six individuals with extensive criminal records, sir. They attempted to flee after...disposing of Ms. Carter in the mine. Our teams intercepted them at the airport."

Harrison examined the dossiers with cold precision. No familiar faces.

"Secure them. I want interrogation results before dawn. Every connection, every motive - leave no stone unturned."

"Yes, Mr. Whitmore."
###Chapter 296 The Miracle Worker

As the last person exited the room, Donovan Prescott collapsed onto the floor, his body finally giving in to exhaustion.

Harrison Whitmore gestured sharply, and two security guards immediately dragged Donovan away.

The harsh fluorescent lights of the emergency room continued to blaze relentlessly.

Harrison, Dominic Kingsley, and Julian Hartwell paced anxiously outside, their footsteps echoing in the sterile hallway.

Dawn's first light was creeping through the windows when the operating room lights finally dimmed. The three men sprang to their feet.

They rushed toward the swinging doors just as they opened.

The surgeon emerged, peeling off his surgical mask with trembling hands.

Harrison's voice cut through the tense silence. "How is Evelyn? Tell me her condition."

The doctor exhaled heavily. "Her oxygen levels were critically low. We've stabilized her, but..." He hesitated. "She may not regain consciousness."

Harrison's face drained of color. His hands clenched into fists. "What... What are you telling me?"

"Mr. Whitmore, our hospital lacks the specialized equipment needed. Ms. Carter is likely to remain in a vegetative state."

"That can't be true!"

Julian's eyes burned with unshed tears. His voice cracked. "Evelyn will wake up. She has to."

He refused to accept this cruel reality.

Dominic ran a shaky hand through his hair. "There must be another option," he demanded.

The doctor shook his head grimly, looking like a judge delivering a death sentence.

Then, after a weighted pause, he added, "Though... there is one person who might be able to help."

Three pairs of eyes locked onto him with desperate intensity. Harrison grabbed the doctor's arm.

"Name them. We'll move heaven and earth to get them here."

The doctor sighed. "The problem is... he may refuse to treat Ms. Carter."

Dominic's voice turned urgent. "Who is this person? Where do we find him?"

The physician frowned. "He's exceptionally skilled but notoriously difficult to locate. And time is critical - if we delay too long..."

Julian interrupted, "How long do we have? We'll do whatever it takes."

"Six hours."

"Only six?"

"Yes. Frankly, it's nearly impossible. But if you can find him in time, there might be hope..."

Harrison's eyes suddenly flashed with recognition.

"You're speaking of Dr. Benedict Harrison, aren't you?"

The doctor nodded vigorously. "Exactly! But tracking down Dr. Harrison is-"

Before he could finish, Harrison was already dialing a number from his contacts.

At that exact moment, Benedict was lounging on a private beach in Bora Bora, a stunning brunette nestled against him, when his phone shattered the peaceful moment.

"Who the hell- Can't you see I'm busy?" he snapped.

Then he saw the caller ID.

He bolted upright so fast he nearly knocked over his cocktail.

"Harrison! To what do I owe this rare honor?" Benedict's voice dripped with theatrical delight. "I've missed you terribly, you know. When I heard you'd left France for Pamore, I almost booked the next flight!"

Harrison ignored the effusive greeting.

His voice was steel. "Your location. Now."

Benedict chuckled. "Bora Bora. Why? Planning to join me?"

"You have three hours to reach Dunhill General. Fail to arrive on time, and you'll regret it."
###Chapter 297 Dr. Benedict Saves the Day

Harrison's voice was sharper than Benedict had ever heard before.

All traces of amusement vanished from Benedict's face. "What's wrong?"

"A life is on the line!"

Benedict didn't need another word.

He hung up and was on his feet in an instant. The stunning woman behind him called out, "Benedict, you're leaving now?"

He didn’t even glance back.

"Everyone, clear out." His tone left no room for argument as he ignored the protests and arranged for a private jet.

—

Two and a half hours later, Benedict landed at Dunhill Hospital.

"Is that Dr. Harrison?"

"Oh my God—am I hallucinating?"

"It's really him!"

Benedict paid no attention to the awestruck whispers of the medical staff.

He had already reviewed Evelyn’s scans mid-flight and mapped out the surgery in his mind.

Without wasting a second, he changed into scrubs and strode into the OR.

The light above the operating room door flickered back to life.

"Can we trust him?" Julian muttered, skepticism lacing his voice.

Dominic’s jaw tightened. "Dr. Harrison doesn’t fail. If he can’t save Evelyn, then..."

He didn’t finish.

None of them had expected things to escalate this badly.

Dominic exhaled sharply. "She’ll make it."

Harrison, who rarely offered comfort, gave a firm nod.

Julian clenched his fists. "Once she’s stable, we handle this ourselves. No one touches Evelyn and walks away."

The words had barely left his mouth when the doors burst open.

"Mr. Sterling, you can’t go in there!"

Nathan’s expression was thunderous. "Move."

The bodyguard stood firm.

"Don’t make this difficult, sir."

"Where is she?" Nathan demanded, but the guard remained silent.

Dominic stepped forward, his voice icy. "You have no business here."

Nathan’s composure cracked. "How is Evelyn?"

"You lost the right to ask that when you signed the divorce papers. Leave."

Nathan’s jaw twitched, but he forced himself to stay calm. "I brought a medical team—"

"Not needed." Dominic cut him off without hesitation.

Nathan’s fists clenched.

He stared at the OR doors, his chest tight. He’d dropped everything the moment he heard—rushed here with the best specialists Pamore had to offer.

And now he couldn’t even see her.

"I’m not leaving until I know she’s safe."

Dominic scoffed. "Suit yourself."

Then he turned his back, dismissing Nathan entirely.

Left standing alone in the sterile hallway, Nathan waited in silence.

The surgery dragged on for eight grueling hours. When the light finally dimmed, the tension was suffocating.

Dominic lunged forward the second Benedict stepped out. "How is she?"

Benedict peeled off his mask, exhaustion lining his face—but his gaze locked onto Harrison’s with quiet certainty.
###Chapter 298 Out of Critical Condition

"The surgery was a complete success. Evelyn Carter is stable now. She should regain consciousness soon."

A collective sigh of relief filled the room.

Harrison Whitmore placed a firm hand on Benedict Harrison's shoulder. "You did well."

But the mood shifted when Benedict leaned into Harrison's touch with a tired grin. "After all that work, this is all I get? Where's my proper thank you?"

Harrison shoved his head away playfully. "Name your price. If you want the stars, I'll charter a rocket."

Benedict's eyes lit up.

"Remember those words. No take-backs."

Yawning dramatically, he stretched. "That surgery drained me. I need a nap before claiming my reward."

Harrison signaled his security team to escort Benedict to a private suite.

Meanwhile, in the operating theater, medical staff buzzed with disbelief.

"Her oxygen deprivation lasted nearly twenty minutes! How is there zero neurological damage?"

"This defies all medical literature."

"Dr. Harrison just rewrote the textbooks."

"I'm submitting this case study to The Lancet. This is groundbreaking!"

They pored over surgical notes like sacred texts, marveling at Benedict's precision.

Once stabilized, Evelyn was transferred to the penthouse recovery suite. Harrison remained rooted beside her bed, his gaze never leaving her pale features.

Outside, Julian Hartwell reached for the door handle, only for Dominic Kingsley to intercept him. "Give them space."

Julian's jaw tightened. "If that bastard hurts her again, I'll—"

Dominic cut him off. "After everything? Even a fool could see Harrison's devotion. This isn't our battle. But we have others to fight."

The unspoken meaning hung between them.

Evelyn's abduction had triggered seismic repercussions.

As a Kingsley heiress, her disappearance during Dunhill's high-profile gala had mobilized special forces. The mayor had personally delivered three public apologies.

Dominic checked his Rolex. "We need to contain the fallout."

"Let's go."

As they turned, a shadow detached from the corridor's gloom.

Nathan Sterling stood there, his Armani suit wrinkled from hours of waiting.

Julian's lip curled. "Divorced means divorced. Stop haunting her like some lovesick ghost. You had your chance."

Nathan didn't flinch. "My relationship with Evelyn isn't your concern."

"Like hell it isn't!" Julian advanced, fists clenched. "You paraded Isabella Delaney while Evelyn played the dutiful wife. You're lucky I don't—"

"I never cheated."

The quiet declaration stopped Julian mid-rant. He barked a laugh. "You expect anyone to believe that?"

Nathan's gaze never wavered. "The truth doesn't require belief."

Dominic stepped between them. "However brave your delusions, we're done here. Evelyn needs peace, not your theatrics."

As they walked away, Julian muttered, "That man's audacity should be studied."

Dominic's phone buzzed with a security alert. "Focus. We have a corporate war to win."

Behind them, Nathan watched the ICU doors slide shut, his expression unreadable. The game had only just begun.
###Chapter 299 A Fateful Encounter in Youth

"Mr. Sterling, my whereabouts are none of your business." Nathan's voice was ice-cold as he made his position clear.

Dominic knew arguing with Nathan would be pointless.

"Mr. Kingsley, even a child knows when to move on after missing a train." Dominic adjusted his cufflinks with deliberate calm. "The train won't reverse course just because you stand there wishing. Surely a man of your intellect understands this basic principle."

With that final remark, Dominic strode away with Julian following reluctantly.

"Dom, are we really leaving him here?" Julian cast a worried glance backward.

Dominic didn't break stride. "What alternative do we have? Chain him to the car?"

"But Evelyn specifically said—"

"Trust your sister." Dominic cut him off firmly. "She'll choose what's right for her future. She knows who deserves her heart."

Julian exhaled sharply but nodded. "I hope you're right about this."

Meanwhile, Evelyn floated in the hazy space between dreams and reality.

Her subconscious transported her back five years, to the first time she'd met Nathan.

She'd been pursuing her master's at Coronia University's prestigious design school - her first time living away from home. The Kingsley men had been beside themselves with worry.

"Evie, I've purchased the townhouse across from campus and arranged full security and staff." Dominic's voice had been tense even through the phone. "Stop being stubborn about this."

Evelyn had rolled her eyes at her overprotective older brother. "I'm here to study, not be pampered. The dorms are perfectly adequate. I'm twenty years old, Dom. I can manage basic adulting."

"But you've never—"

"I was always going to leave the nest eventually." She'd softened her tone. "Let me spread my wings, big brother."

After twenty more minutes of negotiation, she'd finally won the argument.

The moment she hung up, someone barreled into her with enough force to send her sprawling onto the pavement. Pain shot up her spine as her designer bag went flying.

Her assailant turned out to be a scrawny teenager who immediately began babbling apologies in rapid-fire Eliganese. Evelyn waved him off - he couldn't have been more than fourteen.

As she struggled to right herself using her suitcase for leverage, the boy vanished into the crowd.

Evelyn blinked. "What just—"

Her fingers flew to her crossbody bag. The zipper gaped open, her wallet conspicuously absent.

"You've got to be kidding me." She stomped her foot in frustration. "Pickpocketed within five minutes of arrival? That little thief! If I ever see him again, I'll—"

A rich, amused chuckle cut through her tirade.

Evelyn whirled to find an impossibly handsome man watching her from atop a vintage bicycle. His jet-black hair gleamed under the afternoon sun, his aristocratic features marking him clearly as Kidhna nobility.

"What's so funny?" she snapped.

Nathan - though she didn't know his name yet - studied her with undisguised amusement, clearly entertained by her flushed cheeks and indignant expression.

With effortless grace, he tossed something toward her. Evelyn caught it reflexively - her missing wallet.

"You should be more careful, princess." He smirked, one foot already on the pedal. "Next time you might not get rescued by a gallant stranger."

Before she could respond, he'd pushed off, disappearing around the corner as suddenly as he'd appeared.

Evelyn stared at the wallet in her hands, then burst out laughing despite herself.

She'd remember that moment forever - the way the sunlight had caught in his dark eyes, the effortless confidence in his posture. That single encounter had seared itself into her memory with startling clarity.

Some meetings change everything. This one had rewritten her destiny.
###Chapter 300 His Protective Instincts

Over a month had passed since their last encounter.

Evelyn closed her textbook and stepped out of the lecture hall. A noisy crowd had gathered nearby, their raucous laughter cutting through the campus air.

Suddenly, the insults began flying in heavily accented English.

"All you Kingsley people are pathetic, crawling like insects."

"Your country was weak then, and you're still spineless now."

"After all these years, you still belong beneath our feet."

Evelyn's hands clenched into fists at her sides. Her chest burned with indignation. Who did these foreign students think they were?

How dare they spew such baseless hatred?

She took a determined step forward when the unmistakable sound of flesh hitting flesh stopped her mid-stride. A pained yelp followed.

"What the hell? You're attacking me now?"

Another solid punch landed before the sentence was finished.

"That's for disrespecting my country!" A familiar voice growled. "Let me show you what a real Kingsley man can do!"

Nathan's fist connected with the foreigner's jaw with brutal precision.

More cries of pain erupted from the group.

Evelyn pushed through the gathering crowd to see Nathan systematically dismantling the bullies. His movements were fluid yet devastatingly efficient.

Within moments, three foreign students lay groaning on the pavement.

Nathan straightened his jacket sleeves with a sharp tug, looking down at them with undisguised contempt. "Consider this your only warning. Next time I see your faces, the consequences will be worse."

He turned abruptly.

Their eyes met, and Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

"It's you!"

Recognition flashed across Nathan's face.

Without a word, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her away from the scene.

"You were incredible back there!" Evelyn's words tumbled out in an excited rush. "The way they were talking about our country - as if we're still living in the past! They have no idea how far we've come."

Nathan remained silent, his grip firm as he guided her across campus.

"I wish I could've punched them myself," she continued, practically vibrating with adrenaline. "That would've shown them-"

He suddenly stopped in a secluded courtyard, finally releasing her arm.

"Did you see everything?" Nathan's voice was tight.

Evelyn nodded enthusiastically. "Every second! You were amazing!"

Nathan ran a hand through his hair, his expression darkening. "Those aren't just random students. They're connected to some dangerous people on campus." His jaw tightened. "You walked right into their territory without thinking. What if they come after you later?"

The genuine concern in his voice sent warmth spreading through Evelyn's chest. She offered him a reassuring smile. "I can handle myself. They won't dare touch me."

But Nathan's frown deepened. "At least don't walk alone for a while. Wait until this blows over."

Unable to refuse his protectiveness, Evelyn nodded. "Alright, I'll be careful."

"Where are you staying? I'll walk you back." His tone brooked no argument.

Evelyn pointed toward the dormitory buildings. "Just over there."

Wordlessly, Nathan escorted her all the way to her building's entrance. He waited until she disappeared safely inside before turning away, his shoulders still tense with lingering worry.
###Chapter 301 Step Forward

Evelyn's dorm mates had spotted someone walking her back and instantly began whispering excitedly.

"Who was that gorgeous man? Your secret boyfriend? He's absolutely dreamy!"

"Those shoulders! That jawline! Where did you find him?"

"Since when did you start dating? Why am I always the last to know?"

Bombarded with questions, Evelyn quickly clarified, "He's not my boyfriend. Don't get the wrong idea."

"What?! Then what's his name? You have to introduce me!"

The question made Evelyn pause. They'd met twice now, yet she'd never thought to ask his name.

"I'll... ask him next time we meet."

Her friends' disappointed sighs were almost comical. Evelyn simply rolled her eyes.

She made a mental note to clarify things properly during their next encounter.

Fate, however, had other plans.

The very next day, Evelyn's friends dragged her aside. "Evelyn! Isn't that your mystery man from yesterday? Why's he being taken to the dean's office?"

Shocked, Evelyn followed their gaze to see the group of foreign students from yesterday's confrontation complaining to faculty members.

"Professor, this is the guy who attacked us unprovoked yesterday."

"Physical violence is unacceptable! He must be punished!"

"We demand his expulsion!"

Nathan merely smirked at their accusations.

Instead of defending himself, he responded in flawless Eliganese, "Seems I went too easy on you yesterday. Next time, I'll make sure you can't speak at all."

"Enough!" the professor snapped.

"I won't tolerate this disrespect! I'm reporting you to the dean for immediate expulsion!"

Nathan shrugged indifferently. "Do what you must."

The professor reached for his phone when Evelyn suddenly stepped forward without hesitation.

"That's not what happened!"

She recounted the entire incident in perfect Eliganese.

The professor didn't react immediately. Instead, he studied Evelyn carefully.

He recognized her instantly. In fact, every staff member at the university knew exactly who Evelyn Carter was.

Had anyone else spoken up, he might have dismissed it. But this was Evelyn Kingsley's sister!

After a tense pause, the professor turned to the foreign students. "Is her account accurate?"

The students shifted uncomfortably, avoiding direct eye contact.

The professor's expression darkened. "Instead of focusing on your studies, you're causing disturbances on campus? Very well. I'll ensure the administration handles this appropriately."

The foreign students received public disciplinary action, effectively ending the matter.

As they left the office, Nathan regarded Evelyn with an amused smirk. "Didn't expect you to have such courage. Aren't you worried they'll retaliate?"

Evelyn shook her head firmly. "They wouldn't dare."

Not with Dominic's security detail watching her every move.

"Impressive," Nathan remarked, his gaze lingering. "I owe you one. I'll repay this favor when the opportunity arises."
###Chapter 302 Strangers When They Met Again

Evelyn flashed a bright smile. "Don't worry about it. You were just standing up for what's right. Those jerks had it coming yesterday. I would've punched them myself if you hadn't."

Nathan shook his head firmly. "A lady like you shouldn't resort to violence. That's what men are for."

He paused suddenly, a playful glint in his eyes. "Come to think of it, I never got your name. What should I call you?"

"Evelyn Carter," she replied, tilting her head slightly.

Nathan gave a slow nod. "Evelyn Carter. I won't forget that."

Now it was her turn to be curious. "And you? What's your name? I can't keep shouting 'hey you' across campus whenever we meet."

He chuckled, studying her face with amusement. "If you really want to know, meet me at the university's east gate tomorrow at four. I'll tell you then."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Why all the mystery?"

But Nathan was already walking backward, flashing that infuriating grin. "Don't be late, Evelyn Carter. Four o'clock sharp!"

She huffed in frustration, yet couldn't deny the flutter of anticipation in her chest.

The next day crawled by at a snail's pace. Evelyn found herself checking the clock every five minutes.

She spent an absurd amount of time picking out her outfit, finally settling on a sky-blue dress that brought out her eyes. By three-thirty, she was already pacing near the east gate.

But Nathan never showed.

Days turned into weeks, and Evelyn's hopeful excitement curdled into bitter disappointment.

She graduated with her master's degree without ever seeing him again. Eventually, she convinced herself that their paths would never cross again.

Until two years later.

Returning home after completing her studies abroad, Evelyn had a layover in Veridia. That's where she spotted him in the bustling airport terminal.

Nathan Sterling looked completely transformed - dressed in an impeccably tailored suit, his posture radiating authority. The carefree boy she remembered had been replaced by this serious, imposing man.

Yet those piercing eyes were unmistakable.

"Hey, wait up!" Evelyn called out, rushing forward with years of pent-up frustration.

Her voice trembled slightly. "You never showed up that day. Do you have any idea how long I waited for you?"

She expected at least some explanation, some half-hearted apology she could pretend to accept.

Instead, Nathan regarded her with cold detachment, his brow furrowing slightly. "Do I know you?"

Three simple words that shattered her completely.

The man who'd occupied her thoughts for years didn't even recognize her.

Evelyn swallowed hard, forcing herself to continue. "It's me, Evelyn. Evelyn Carter? From university?"

Nathan's lips curled into a mocking smirk. "That's the oldest pickup line in the book."

Without another glance, he strode away with his entourage.

Not one to give up easily, Evelyn hurried after him. "You still owe me your name!"

Nathan turned with an exasperated sigh. "In Veridia, everyone knows who I am. If you're going to try your luck, at least do your research first."

His cutting remark left Evelyn rooted to the spot, her cheeks burning.

By the time she recovered, Nathan had disappeared into the crowd.

That moment sealed her decision - Evelyn Carter wasn't leaving Veridia until she got answers.
###Chapter 303 Just A Dream

The name came to her unexpectedly - Nathan Sterling. Someone had mentioned it in passing, but it struck her like lightning.

From that moment, his name became a permanent scar etched into her soul. A wound that never fully healed.

Fate had a cruel sense of humor.

She happened to save Margaret Winslow, Nathan's grandmother, during one of her charity events.

When Margaret mentioned searching for a suitable wife for her grandson, Evelyn Carter volunteered without hesitation. She became Mrs. Sterling overnight.

Three years of marriage flashed before her eyes like a poorly edited film reel. Every painful memory served as punishment for her foolish decision.

Yet after all this time, she still couldn't comprehend why Nathan had completely forgotten their shared past.

Evelyn's eyelids fluttered weakly before opening to the sterile white ceiling.

The sharp scent of antiseptic assaulted her senses. It had all been a terrible dream.

"Evelyn, thank God you're awake."

Harrison Whitmore's relieved voice reached her ears. She managed a weak smile in his direction.

"Harrison... what happened?"

"You've been out for three days." His grip on her hand tightened. "You gave us quite the scare. The doctors weren't sure when you'd wake up."

Fragmented memories surfaced - a sharp pain in her neck, then darkness. "Someone... they drugged me." The realization made her shiver.

Dominic Kingsley entered just then. "Don't worry. We've apprehended your attacker. But this goes deeper than we initially thought."

Evelyn frowned. "Sterling Enterprises?"

Dominic shook his head. "They wouldn't dare."

Then who?

The silent exchange between Dominic and Harrison didn't escape her notice.

"We'll handle this," Dominic said firmly. "Your only job is to recover. Leave everything else to us."

"But-"

Harrison squeezed her hand. "Your health comes first. Everything else can wait."

Reluctantly, Evelyn nodded. "Alright."

Harrison changed the subject. "The Summit Corporation deal is nearly finalized. Once you're discharged, we can proceed with signing."

"That's good news," Evelyn acknowledged. "We should monitor the project closely though."

Harrison hesitated before adding, "There's something else... Nathan's been waiting outside since you were admitted. Do you want to see him?"

Evelyn's expression remained impassive at the mention of his name.

"No. Send him away."

"Understood." Harrison respected her decision without question.

Turning toward the window, Evelyn watched sunlight filter through the blinds. She had willingly walked into this heartbreak. Now she would walk out of it with her dignity intact.

...

One week later

Evelyn's hospital room had become a revolving door of important visitors - the mayor, government officials, various business magnates.

Dominic intercepted them all.

After seven days of uninterrupted rest, Evelyn was finally discharged. The crisp autumn air greeted her as she stepped outside, ready to face whatever came next.
###Chapter 304 Rejected

The day Evelyn was discharged from the hospital, Harrison surprised her with an enormous bouquet of white roses.

"Evelyn, may every day from now on bring you health and happiness."

Her fingers brushed against the delicate petals as she accepted the flowers with a genuine smile. "Thank you, Harrison!"

Julian approached them both, his cheerful expression belying the worry lines still etched around his eyes.

"You really gave us a scare this time, little sis. That night... I've never been so terrified in my life." He turned to Harrison with undisguised gratitude. "If it weren't for Harrison tracking down Dr. Benedict, we might have lost you. We owe him everything."

At the mention of the renowned physician, Julian glanced around the hospital corridor. "Come to think of it, where is Dr. Benedict? I haven't seen him since the surgery."

Harrison adjusted his cufflinks casually. "He's taken an extended vacation. The man's practically a ghost when he's not saving lives. Don't waste your energy looking for him."

"Still," Evelyn said firmly, "he saved my life. I want to properly thank him when he returns."

"I'll arrange it," Harrison promised with a nod.

As they walked toward the elevator, their footsteps faltered simultaneously.

There, leaning against the opposite wall, stood Nathan Sterling. His usually immaculate appearance showed signs of exhaustion, but his piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn with startling intensity.

Julian opened his mouth to speak, but Harrison placed a restraining hand on his arm. "Evelyn, we'll wait for you downstairs."

The silence stretched between them after the others left.

Finally, Nathan spoke, his voice rougher than usual. "How are you feeling?"

Evelyn maintained her polite smile, though it never reached her eyes. "Perfectly fine, Mr. Sterling. Thank you for asking."

"Evelyn, I was out of my mind with worry."

Her response came like ice water. "Why are you still here?"

"I needed to see you with my own eyes. To know you were really okay."

Her nod was perfunctory. "Well, now you've seen me. You can go."

"Nathan!" His hand shot out to stop her.

The raw emotion in his voice would have melted her heart months ago. "When I heard about your condition, I realized something. I've never cared about anyone the way I care about you. You've become... essential to me."

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "Are you hearing yourself, Mr. Sterling? Where was this devotion when I nearly died in that plane crash?"

Her voice dropped to a whisper. "That was the loneliest moment of my life. And you? Let me guess - holding Isabella's hand during her prenatal appointment?"

She'd witnessed that particular betrayal with her own eyes.

"No, Evelyn, you've got it all wrong-" Nathan's explanation died on his lips when he saw her expression.

"Mr. Sterling, what part of 'it's over' don't you understand? There's nothing left between us. Accept it and move on!"

"Evelyn, please-"

She shook her head sharply, cutting off whatever plea he'd been about to make.

"Fate brought us together, and fate tore us apart. Let's not speak of the past again."

Without waiting for a response, she turned on her heel and walked away, her posture rigid. She didn't look back, not even when she felt the weight of his gaze burning into her retreating form.

For the first time in his privileged life, Nathan Sterling tasted the bitter dregs of defeat.

What could he possibly do to win her back?

Outside the hospital doors, Evelyn found Harrison and Julian waiting beneath the afternoon sun.
###Chapter 305 Letting Go

Julian and Harrison exchanged silent glances as they moved toward her.

"Get in the car," Julian commanded simply.

Evelyn slid into the backseat without protest. As the vehicle pulled away, she pressed her forehead against the cool glass window.

An overwhelming melancholy settled in her chest.

Five years. Five long years she'd wasted pining for Nathan Sterling. The prime years of her life, gone like smoke.

Yet Evelyn had made peace with it. She'd given everything - her passion, her recklessness, her very soul. The bitter ending couldn't erase that.

"Where are they?" she suddenly asked, breaking the heavy silence.

Julian cleared his throat. "Why bother? Dominic's handling it. Stay out of this."

"I need to see them." Her voice left no room for argument.

Harrison sighed. "Dominic has them secured. You'll need his approval."

Evelyn reached for her phone, but Julian intercepted her hand. "Damn it, Evie. Always so stubborn." He turned to the driver. "Take us there."

The car swerved onto a bumpy backroad leading out of Dunhill. The terrain grew rougher, the asphalt giving way to dirt paths winding through hills.

After thirty bone-jarring minutes, they arrived at a secluded village compound.

Two squads of armed guards snapped to attention. "Ms. Carter."

"Take me to them," Evelyn ordered.

The guards led them down a dim corridor. The air grew thick with the metallic tang of blood and the sickening crack of leather against flesh.

"Inside, ma'am."

The door creaked open, revealing a nightmare scene. Four broken men hung from chains, their faces swollen beyond recognition. Their eyes widened in terror at Evelyn's approach.

She signaled for the torturer to cease. "Who sent you?" she demanded.

Only muffled groans answered.

Harrison explained, "They took a muting agent when we captured them. Can't speak a word."

Evelyn's jaw tightened. These snakes were more cunning than she'd anticipated.

"Then write it." She motioned for their release and shoved paper and pens at them. "Name your employer, and you walk out alive. Refuse..." She let the threat hang.

The men trembled violently. After an eternity, one scrawled something and handed it over.

Evelyn's blood ran cold as she read the message.
###Chapter 306 Worthless Scum

The crumpled note in Evelyn's hand read: "You'll get nothing from me! My life means nothing. Killing me changes nothing."

With a cold laugh, Evelyn shredded the paper between her fingers. "Playing the tough guy? You really think I won't find out?"

The men before her remained stone-faced.

Evelyn's voice cut through the tension. "Pamore. Maximilian Blackwood."

That single name shattered their composure. Nervous glances darted between them.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed to slits. "Just as I suspected."

"This has nothing to do with Maximilian!" one blurted. "We acted alone—just wanted to shut your pretty mouth."

Her lips curled in disdain.

"Pathetic," Evelyn spat, already turning away, her spine rigid with contempt. "If you insist on being worthless..."

Her voice dropped to an icy whisper. "...then I'll treat you like the trash you are."

"Yes, Ms. Carter."

As Evelyn strode toward the exit, desperate wails erupted behind her—

"Ms. Carter, have mercy!"

"We made a mistake!"

"We'll never cross you again!"

"Please, give us another chance!"

She didn't so much as glance back.

Dominic fell into step beside her, jaw tight. "Vermin. We gave them every opportunity. Now they'll learn what happens to those who betray the Kingsleys."

Evelyn halted abruptly. "That's what I don't understand." Her brow furrowed. "I've never even met Maximilian Blackwood. Why would Pamore's kingpin want me dead?"

Dominic's expression darkened.

"It's... complicated. My team's investigating. We'll have answers soon."

Evelyn gave a curt nod. "This ends when we return to Pamore."

Together, they disappeared into the night.

——

At the Grand Meridian Hotel, Geoffrey Lockhart stood waiting at the VIP elevator.

After the mining incident, he'd secured the penthouse suite and tripled security—nothing but the best for Summit Corporation's newest partner.

"Ms. Carter, anything you require, day or night, my team stands ready."

Evelyn offered a polite nod. "Your hospitality is noted, Mr. Lockhart."

"The honor is mine!"

Harrison Whitmore stepped forward. "The partnership terms with Summit are finalized. We can execute the contracts at your convenience."

Geoffrey beamed. "Mr. Whitmore, Ms. Carter—your trust humbles us. Summit will ensure this venture exceeds all expectations."

"Then it's settled." Evelyn's tone brooked no argument. "Name the date."

——

Next morning, Summit Corporation's signing ceremony made front-page news across Dunhill.

Cameras flashed as Evelyn and Geoffrey signed the historic agreement. The ballroom erupted in thunderous applause.

Across town, Donovan Prescott shattered his whiskey glass against the wall.

The television showed everything—the handshake, the champagne toast, the billion-dollar opportunity Sterling Enterprises had lost because of one miscalculation.

A knock interrupted his rage.

"Enter."

Vivienne Chambers glided in with a leather portfolio.

"Mr. Prescott? The projections for the Brisbane acquisition require your approval."
###Chapter 307 A Second Shot at Love

The moment Vivienne Chambers opened her mouth, her gaze locked onto the live broadcast playing in Donovan Prescott's office.

Her eyes widened to impossible proportions, her entire body freezing in shock.

This couldn't be happening.

"Impossible..." Vivienne whispered, her voice barely audible as her face drained of all color.

Evelyn Carter was the hidden heiress of Kingsley Industries.

She'd just made an enemy of the most powerful woman in Dunhill. The realization hit her like a freight train, making her wish for a handful of sedatives to calm her racing heart.

Donovan's furious voice snapped her back to reality. "Do you realize what you've done? Our deal with Kingsley Industries is ruined. The financial losses will be catastrophic."

Vivienne trembled, but not from concern over company losses. She'd crossed Evelyn Carter. If the heiress decided to retaliate, crushing her would be as effortless as stepping on an ant.

"Mr. Prescott, this was all Giselle's fault! She's already been terminated. Please, you must understand—"

Donovan cut her off with an exasperated sigh.

What's done is done.

"Just get out."

Relief flooded Vivienne as she slunk from the office, already pulling out her phone. "Prepare the most extravagant gift basket you have. Nothing but the absolute best. I'll be there in twenty minutes."

She abandoned all pretense of work and fled the building.

Meanwhile, Summit Corporation hosted an exclusive after-party following the successful signing ceremony.

As guests of honor, Evelyn and Harrison Whitmore received VIP treatment that bordered on royal.

Dunhill's elite circled them like moths to a flame, champagne flutes raised in endless toasts.

"Ms. Carter, your business acumen is matched only by your beauty! Truly inspiring."

"Kingsley Industries' presence elevates Dunhill's entire business landscape. We're honored."

"After today's display, every company here is vying to collaborate with you."

Evelyn accepted their praise with practiced grace, downing glass after glass until her cheeks flushed pink.

Harrison discreetly intercepted several drinks meant for her.

Someone in the crowd teased, "Ms. Carter, your partner is quite the catch! Mr. Whitmore complements you perfectly."

Evelyn's blush deepened.

She shot Harrison a glance, disappointed to find his expression unreadable.

Then his deep voice resonated through the chatter. "Being by her side is privilege enough."

Evelyn's smile could've powered the city as she tugged his sleeve. "I need air. Let's step outside."

With polite nods to lingering guests, they escaped to the terrace.

Cool night air cleared Evelyn's head instantly.

She turned to Harrison. "Did their comments bother you?"

His brow furrowed in confusion.

When their eyes met, he shook his head slowly. "They merely voiced what I've long thought."

Evelyn's pulse hammered so loudly she feared he might hear it.

Harrison's gaze held oceans of unspoken words.

Finally, he breathed, "Evelyn... when will you let me prove myself to you?"
###Chapter 308 Filled With Regret

Evelyn quickly averted her gaze, her cheeks flushing with warmth.

Even after Harrison's heartfelt confession, she couldn't bring herself to respond properly.

The world seemed to pause around them.

After what felt like eternity, Harrison reached out, gently tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear.

"There's no rush for an answer. Take all the time you need." His voice was soft yet firm.

Only then did Evelyn dare to meet his eyes.

Flashes of their shared moments played through her mind like a cherished film reel.

Would she ever find someone who understood her so completely?

"Harrison, I just need a little more time," she whispered.

He simply nodded. "Whatever you need."

Evelyn drew a deep breath, her gaze drifting to the horizon.

Despite her efforts to move forward, fragments of the past clung stubbornly to her heart.

The memory of Nathan Sterling, the passionate young man who'd fought for justice on campus, surfaced unexpectedly.

But that man no longer existed.

"Let me see Ms. Carter immediately!"

"I'm sorry, miss. Ms. Carter is attending a private function."

At the estate gates, security struggled to contain Vivienne Chambers' determined advance.

The confrontation escalated as Vivienne shoved against the guards.

"Look at these gifts! They're for Ms. Carter personally. Can't you make an exception?"

"Without Ms. Carter's authorization, I can't permit entry." The guard remained unmoved.

Vivienne stamped her designer heel in frustration, her plans thwarted.

Just then, Evelyn and Harrison emerged. Spotting Evelyn, Vivienne's face lit up with exaggerated enthusiasm.

"Ms. Carter! Vivienne Chambers from Sterling Enterprises. We've met before, remember?"

Evelyn's brow furrowed in suspicion.

The head guard approached. "Ms. Carter, this woman has been causing a disturbance."

With a dismissive wave, Evelyn said, "Let her through."

Vivienne practically sprinted forward.

"Ms. Carter!" She beamed. "I've come to apologize properly."

She presented an ostentatious array of gifts - luxury skincare, rare cosmetics, imported supplements.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "This isn't necessary, Ms. Chambers."

But Vivienne pressed on. "I know you must still be upset. Giselle was the one who barred your entry."

"That incompetent girl has been terminated. Consider this her comeuppance."

Evelyn studied Vivienne carefully.

With measured calm, she remarked, "Interesting. Wasn't Giselle your personal assistant?"
###Chapter 309 The Mysterious Delivery

Vivienne's face drained of color as she stammered, "That... that's all behind us now. She means nothing to me anymore."

Evelyn wasn't foolish. The way Vivienne was acting today—so different from before—could only mean one thing.

It was obvious. Vivienne must have discovered her true identity.

Evelyn laughed, but her eyes remained cold.

"Ms. Chambers, an assistant wouldn’t dare pull such a stunt on her own unless... she had orders from higher up."

Vivienne paled further, her lips parting to explain.

But Evelyn had no interest in hearing excuses.

"Ms. Chambers, focus on your work instead of meddling in pointless affairs. In business, results speak louder than words."

With that, Evelyn turned on her heel and strode away with Harrison in tow. The conversation was over.

Vivienne stood frozen, regret twisting in her gut like a knife.

After Kingsley Industries secured the partnership with Summit Corporation, Summit's stock skyrocketed.

By market close, their valuation had surged by 10%.

Companies that had been hesitating between Sterling Enterprises and Summit now rushed to align with the latter.

The two corporations had been neck-and-neck before. But in mere days, Summit pulled ahead, leaving Sterling Enterprises in the dust.

The day after signing the contract, Evelyn returned to Pamore.

As she stepped into the office, Julian Hawthorne was already waiting. His smile widened when he saw her.

"Ms. Carter, welcome back."

Evelyn offered a polite smile. "The deal is done, so I returned. Did you need something, Mr. Hawthorne?"

Julian chuckled. "Just heard some rumors. They said you had a little... incident in Dunhill. Came to check on you. Glad to see you're unharmed."

Evelyn arched a brow. "Appreciate the concern. I'm fine. With a project this big, I can't afford to be anything but."

Julian's smile tightened. "Of course! The company thrives with you leading the charge."

Evelyn gave a slight nod and moved past him into her office. The moment the door shut, her smile vanished.

She turned to Maxwell immediately. "Any leads on Maximilian?"

Maxwell shook his head. "He operates like a ghost. Tracing him is... complicated."

Evelyn drummed her fingers on the desk. "If conventional methods fail, send our contacts on the dark web after him. I refuse to believe he's untraceable."

"Yes, Ms. Carter."

Just then, another assistant knocked and entered. "Ms. Carter, there's a package for you!"

Evelyn frowned. She hadn’t ordered anything recently.

"Who sent it?"

The assistant checked the parcel. "No sender information."

Evelyn hesitated. "Bring it here."

But Maxwell intercepted. "Let me."

He took the package, testing its weight. Light—likely documents.

"Ms. Carter, allow me to open it first."
###Chapter 310 Isabella's Challenge

Evelyn gave a firm nod. Maxwell produced a sleek pocket knife and sliced open the mysterious package. Photos spilled across the floor like fallen leaves.

He scrambled to collect them, handing the stack to Evelyn. "Ms. Carter, you need to see this!"

The corner of Evelyn's lips curled upward as she examined the images.

"Now the puzzle pieces fit."

She never imagined the puppet master pulling strings would be someone from her past. "Since Isabella's involved, this game just got more entertaining."

A chilling smile played on Evelyn's lips. "Last time, she got off easy with just a few months behind bars. This time, I'll teach her some people are better left untouched."

"Shall I handle this discreetly for you?" Maxwell offered.

Evelyn waved him off. "No need. I'll personally deal with this viper."

Meanwhile, Isabella remained blissfully unaware her scheme had unraveled. She pranced through Dunhill's luxury district, convinced Evelyn was already six feet under.

Nathan's black card burned a hole in her designer purse as she indulged in a shopping spree. Bodyguards struggled under the weight of her purchases before she finally called it quits.

Her manicured finger pointed at Evelyn's boutique. "I want this place secured immediately!" she announced to her entourage. "We're transforming it into a high-end beauty emporium - imported cosmetics, luxury skincare, the works."

"Add some aestheticians for treatments too," she continued, eyes gleaming. "These vapid socialites will empty their trust funds here."

Unbeknownst to her, Olivia observed from the shadows.

Without hesitation, Olivia grabbed a nearby water basin and hurled its contents at Isabella.

A piercing shriek echoed through the boutique.

Isabella stood frozen, designer outfit ruined, mascara running down her cheeks.

Olivia smirked. "Having delusions of grandeur, are we? Need help coming back to reality?"

Isabella wiped her face with trembling hands, her perfect facade crumbling. "You bitch!" she screeched. "Do you know who I am? I'll ruin you!"

She lunged like a feral cat.

Olivia didn't flinch, her gaze icy.

At the last second, she caught Isabella's wrist, swept her legs, and sent her crashing to the floor.

The impact shook the display cases.

Isabella writhed like an overturned beetle, screeching obscenities.

Olivia dusted her hands. "All that arrogance for such pathetic skills. Didn't do your research on me, did you?"

Every bone in Isabella's body ached. She hadn't anticipated Evelyn's mousy friend packing such force.

She couldn't even stand without her bodyguards' help.

"Are you statues?" she screamed at them. "Get me up!"

They scrambled to obey, hauling her to her feet.

Leaning heavily on them, she still managed to sneer. "Your precious Evelyn's rotting in a ditch somewhere. Let's see who protects you now!"
###Chapter 311 She Spoke to You

Olivia's face paled instantly. "What did you just say?"

Isabella's lips curled into a vicious smirk at her reaction.

The moment she'd been anticipating had finally arrived.

"Don't believe me? It's the truth. Evelyn might as well be dead in Dunhill by now. The news will reach here soon enough."

Olivia's entire body trembled with rage. She snatched up a nearby broom and swung it wildly at Isabella.

"You venomous snake! Homewrecking trash! How dare you spread such lies? I'll beat the life out of you!"

Isabella dodged easily, her laughter ringing through the boutique. "Go ahead! Scream all you want!"

"Your curses won't bring Evelyn back. They might not even find her body intact."

"Better start planning her funeral. Maybe if you pray hard enough, she'll haunt you from the afterlife."

Olivia's eyes burned crimson. Without warning, she lunged forward and delivered a stinging slap across Isabella's cheek.

But Isabella barely flinched, her laughter growing louder. Her bodyguards immediately restrained Olivia.

They pinned her arms behind her back as she struggled uselessly, finally shoving her toward the store entrance.

Isabella's mocking laughter followed. She adjusted her designer dress with one hand, the other resting on her hip.

"Pathetic. Evelyn was never a match for me. What a shame I couldn't watch the life drain from her eyes myself!"

With that final barb, she turned on her heel and strutted away, leaving Olivia shell-shocked.

Olivia stood frozen, the world spinning around her.

When reality crashed back, she fumbled for her phone with shaking hands and dialed Evelyn's number.

No answer. She tried again. And again. Each unanswered call felt like another knife to her heart.

Tears streamed down her face as she collapsed against the wall.

"Evelyn, please pick up!"

After the tenth attempt, Olivia hurled her phone across the room and sank to the floor, sobbing uncontrollably.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was concluding an important board meeting at Kingsley Industries. Her phone remained with her assistant.

"Ms. Carter," the assistant said urgently, handing over the device. "You've missed fifteen calls from Ms. Sinclair."

Evelyn's brow furrowed at the notification screen. She immediately returned the call.

Olivia remained curled in a ball, deaf to the world around her.

The persistent ringing finally pierced her grief. Seeing Evelyn's name flash across the screen, she gasped.

"Evelyn! You're alive!" Her voice cracked with relief.

Evelyn's tone sharpened instantly. "Olivia? What's wrong?"

Olivia burst into fresh tears - this time of joy. "You're okay! Thank God you're okay!"

Wiping her face, Olivia's relief turned to fury. "That wretched Isabella told me you were dead! If I see her again, I'll claw her eyes out!"

Understanding dawned on Evelyn. "Isabella spoke to you?"
###Chapter 312 Meeting Maximilian

Olivia let out a frustrated sigh. "That wretched Isabella is becoming insufferable with her arrogance."

Evelyn placed a calming hand on her friend's shoulder. "Let her enjoy her moment of triumph. Her downfall will come soon enough."

A dangerous glimmer flashed in Evelyn's emerald eyes.

As she ended the call, Maxwell entered the office. "Ms. Carter, we've arranged the meeting with Maximilian. He's expecting us at Blackwood Manor tomorrow at 8 pm."

Evelyn's lips curved into a predatory smile. "Inform him we wouldn't miss it for the world."

Maxwell hesitated. "Should we notify Kingsley Industries headquarters in Frenda? Perhaps arrange additional security?"

"Unnecessary. Our local team will suffice." Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "This is a civilized society. They wouldn't dare attempt anything foolish in public."

"Understood, Ms. Carter."

After Maxwell departed, Evelyn moved to the floor-to-ceiling windows, surveying the glittering cityscape below.

Her manicured nails tapped an ominous rhythm against the glass as calculations played behind her piercing gaze.

The following evening at precisely 7 pm, a discreet security detail waited at Kingsley Industries' private entrance.

Evelyn had kept her plans to herself. Slipping into the waiting armored vehicle alone, she gave the driver a single nod.

The sleek black car, specially modified with bulletproof glass and reinforced panels, glided through the city streets toward Blackwood Manor.

"We've arrived, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn stepped out in a tailored black pantsuit that accentuated her lethal elegance. The crisp lines of her jacket emphasized her slender frame as she approached the manor's imposing doors.

A deep chuckle greeted her arrival.

"How bold of you to come alone, Ms. Carter. I do admire courage."

Her gaze lifted to find a heavyset man in his forties occupying the head chair. Time had softened Maximilian Blackwood's physique but not his calculating eyes.

"Maximilian, your reputation precedes you."

Evelyn strode forward with effortless confidence. Only then did she notice the silent observer seated beside Maximilian - a man whose intense stare had followed her since she entered.

She recognized him instantly.

Sebastian Blackwood. The man from the photographs with Isabella.

Sebastian's expression darkened as he studied Evelyn with newfound interest.

"Please, join us, Ms. Carter!" Maximilian gestured expansively before snapping at a servant. "Don't just stand there! Pour our guest some of the '89 Bordeaux."

Evelyn didn't flinch.

Her attention caught on the intricate chessboard between them. The game appeared evenly matched, neither side claiming clear advantage.

"Tell me, Ms. Carter," Maximilian leaned forward, eyes gleaming, "what do you make of our little game?"

Chess happened to be Maximilian's sole indulgence, yet worthy opponents had eluded him for years.

But Evelyn hadn't come to play games.

A faint smile touched her lips. "I've dabbled in chess, though I wouldn't presume to challenge an expert."

Sebastian's mouth quirked. "You underestimate yourself, Ms. Carter." Turning to Maximilian, he suggested, "Why not test her skills?"

Maximilian's interest visibly piqued. "An excellent notion! What say you, Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn arched one perfectly shaped brow. She hadn't forgotten her purpose. "Before we discuss games, Maximilian, perhaps you'd care to explain your organization's recent activities at Dunhill?"
###Chapter 313 The Serpent's Mask

Maximilian Blackwood remained oblivious to the situation. His brow furrowed as he questioned, "Excuse me, what was that about?"

Evelyn Carter's lips curled into a chilling smile. "We're well past the point of pretending, don't you think?"

The temperature in the room seemed to drop as Maximilian's expression darkened. He turned sharply to Sebastian Blackwood. "Explain yourself. What exactly did you do to provoke Ms. Carter?"

Sebastian's face twisted into something ugly as he leaned in to whisper urgently to his boss.

The moment the words registered, Maximilian slammed his fist on the table with a resounding crack. "You brainless imbecile!"

Sebastian recoiled, hands raised in placation. "Max, calm down. It was just... a momentary lapse in judgment."

Maximilian visibly struggled to compose himself before Evelyn's piercing gaze.

Sebastian had been his most trusted lieutenant for nearly a decade. Sacrificing him over some woman, no matter how influential, wasn't an option.

With practiced charm, Maximilian offered a conciliatory smile. "Ms. Carter, surely there's been some misunderstanding?"

Evelyn's fingers tapped rhythmically against her thigh. "I nearly died, Maximilian. What part of that sounds like a misunderstanding to you?"

Maximilian knew exactly who Evelyn was. While he commanded considerable power in the city's underworld, even he couldn't openly challenge the Kingsley heiress.

Playing the gracious host, he poured a crystal glass of bourbon and extended it toward Evelyn. "My associate acted foolishly. Consider this drink my personal apology. Let's put this unfortunate incident behind us."

The glass shattered against the marble floor before it could reach her hands, amber liquid spreading like blood across the tiles.

Sebastian lunged forward, face contorted with rage. "You ungrateful bitch! Max is being more than generous here!"

Evelyn's gaze never wavered. "What do I want? Simple. Your head on a silver platter."

Her words hung in the air like a guillotine's blade. Even the hardened men in the room suppressed shivers at the steel in her voice.

Sebastian barked out a laugh, though his eyes remained deadly serious. "Take my life? You'll need more than pretty words to manage that."

Evelyn examined her manicure with feigned disinterest. "I wouldn't be standing here if I didn't have exactly what it takes."

Maximilian stepped between them, hands raised. "Ms. Carter, please. This hostility isn't good for anyone's health."

But Evelyn's mind was made up. This man had tried to kill her. There would be no mercy.

"Your choice, Maximilian. Hand him over or face the consequences."

Sebastian bristled at her tone. "Since when do we let some spoiled socialite make demands? Say the word, Max, and I'll handle this nuisance."

A single sharp gesture from Maximilian silenced him instantly.

Returning to his seat, Maximilian studied the chessboard before him with sudden intensity. "A game, Ms. Carter? Winner takes all."

"Max, this is ridiculous!" Sebastian protested. "Just let me deal with her!"

"Silence!" The roar was so uncharacteristic that even Evelyn blinked. The carefully constructed mask of civility had slipped, revealing the predator beneath.

Sebastian fell back, properly cowed for the first time that evening.
###Chapter 314 Chess Is a Gamble

"Ms. Carter, what's your decision?"

Evelyn could see right through Maximilian's scheme, but she stood her ground. "Maximilian, before we play, you owe me an explanation."

Maximilian reset the chessboard with practiced ease. As each piece clicked into place, his voice remained steady. "Simple. This game decides everything."

"If you win, Sebastian walks free with no interference from me. Lose, and we pretend this never happened."

The unspoken message was clear - this chess match carried higher stakes than any casino.

Sebastian's tense shoulders relaxed slightly. He knew this was Maximilian's way of protecting him.

After all, in all of Sterling City, no one could match Maximilian's strategic brilliance at chess.

Evelyn didn't stand a chance.

"Well, Ms. Carter? Do we have a deal?"

Sebastian smirked, already anticipating Evelyn's inevitable defeat.

Evelyn shook her head.

Maximilian's face darkened, assuming she was refusing - until she countered, "These stakes seem... inadequate for a gamble of this magnitude."

Interest flickered in Maximilian's eyes.

"What do you propose?"

Evelyn met his gaze unflinchingly. "Let's raise the stakes properly, shall we?"

"I've noticed you've held power for quite some time. Perhaps it's time for a regime change."

Sebastian exploded. "Evelyn! You dare challenge Maximilian's leadership? You'd have to go through every one of us first!"

Evelyn ignored his outburst, keeping her focus on Maximilian.

"Lose, and I take control of your little empire. How's that for stakes?"

Maximilian's expression turned thunderous as he weighed her words.

Seeing her deadly seriousness, he suddenly grinned. "Very well, Ms. Carter. Should you win, I'll surrender my position. I'll acknowledge you as our new leader and follow your every command."

Gasps rippled through the room.

No one had expected their leader to wager their entire organization on a chess game.

The fate of their syndicate now rested on sixty-four squares.

As murmurs spread, Maximilian added, "But if I win, not only do we forget this unpleasantness... you'll become my wife."

The room erupted.

Chants of "Maximilian! Maximilian!" filled the air.

Evelyn's knuckles turned white with suppressed fury.

She silently vowed to make every single one of them regret this moment.

"Well?" Maximilian prompted.

After a tense pause, Evelyn gritted out, "Begin."

The crowd roared as attention shifted to the chessboard.

Evelyn chose white, Maximilian black. Her first move launched their high-stakes duel.

Every spectator held their breath as the game unfolded.

At first, Maximilian played with casual confidence. But as the match progressed, his smirk faded, replaced by deepening concentration.
###Chapter 315 Victory and Defeat

Sebastian Blackwood leaned against the wall, his voice barely above a whisper. "Maximilian, perhaps we should pause for a moment?"

Maximilian Blackwood shot him a sharp glare. "Silence during chess. Have you forgotten the most fundamental rule?"

Sebastian pressed his lips together and turned his attention to Evelyn Carter.

She sat perfectly composed, her expression unreadable. Even with her entire future at stake in this game, not a single tremor shook her steady hands.

Sebastian smirked inwardly. She was putting on quite the performance.

"Wait! You can't take my bishop!"

Maximilian suddenly reached out, stopping Evelyn's move mid-air. "That was a mistake."

He snatched his piece back with a scoff. "Sebastian distracted me. Ms. Carter, surely you'll allow me to retract that move?"

Evelyn didn't speak, but her raised eyebrow spoke volumes.

Maximilian shifted uncomfortably in his seat. After decades of playing, he knew better than to ask for such concessions.

He clenched his jaw. "Fine. Take it then."

As he removed his piece from the board, the tide of the game turned decisively in Evelyn's favor.

Beads of sweat formed on Maximilian's brow. In all his years, he'd never faced an opponent like this.

Evelyn's skill was nothing short of remarkable.

The game intensified, each move calculated with precision. An hour passed without either player gaining clear advantage. The tension in the room was palpable.

"Ms. Carter, you're the first to ever challenge me like this. I'm impressed you've lasted this long."

Maximilian had played chess for over twenty years.

Most opponents didn't survive thirty moves against him, yet Evelyn was clearly his equal.

"You flatter me, Maximilian. My grandfather taught me as a child. I rarely play these days."

Maximilian's eyes widened at her words.

A casual player was matching him move for move?

"Your modesty does you credit, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn's hand hovered over the board before making the decisive move. "Checkmate."

Maximilian's fingers trembled. His king stood trapped, surrounded on all sides. His mouth fell open in disbelief.

He had lost.

Sebastian rushed forward, scanning the board frantically. "This can't be right! How could you lose?"

But the evidence lay before them, undeniable in its finality.

Evelyn leaned back, perfectly at ease. "Well, Maximilian? Your verdict?"

Maximilian closed his eyes, swallowing his pride.

Then he straightened his shoulders and exhaled sharply. "I concede defeat."

The room fell into stunned silence. Even Sebastian stood frozen, his face draining of color.

Maximilian had lost.

Which meant Evelyn would now take control of the organization.

And she would certainly settle accounts for his past actions. Sebastian could already feel cold sweat trickling down his spine.

"Maximilian! It's just a game! This doesn't count!"

Maximilian rubbed his temples before fixing Sebastian with an icy stare. "A man's word is his bond. Ms. Carter won fairly."

Rising to his feet, Maximilian extended his hand toward Evelyn.

"Ms. Carter, I yield to you. You have my respect."
###Chapter 316 She's The Boss

The crowd erupted in unison, their voices thundering through the warehouse. "Boss!"

Sebastian Blackwood's face twisted in disbelief as he watched the scene unfold. His hands clenched into fists, nails digging into his palms. This couldn't be happening.

Everyone was bowing to Evelyn Carter. His future in the organization was over.

"Sebastian!" Maximilian Blackwood's voice cut through the tension like a whip. "On your knees! Beg Ms. Carter for mercy!"

Sebastian's jaw tightened. But he had no choice. With visible reluctance, he dropped to his knees.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. She hadn't expected Maximilian to hold such sway over his men. Impressive.

"Thank you," she said simply.

Maximilian barked orders, and his men formed perfect lines like soldiers.

He approached Evelyn with newfound respect. "Ms. Carter, we're at your service now. Sebastian's fate is yours to decide."

Evelyn tapped her chin thoughtfully. "I don't want his life. Just one small favor."

Sebastian exhaled in relief. Temporary reprieve.

"Ev—Ms. Carter," he corrected hastily. "Name it."

"An eye for an eye," Evelyn said coolly. "Simple, isn't it?"

Sebastian hesitated. Isabella Delaney had been his lover for years. Could he really...?

Evelyn noticed his pause. Her icy gaze pinned him in place. "Problem?"

She leaned closer, her presence overwhelming. "Or would you prefer to take her punishment yourself?"

Sebastian shuddered.

No choice at all.

Self-preservation won.

"Three days," he choked out. "You'll have what you want."

Evelyn nodded, satisfied.

As she turned to leave, Maximilian stopped her. "Ms. Carter, your orders?"

"I'll call when needed. You're in charge until then."

Maximilian bowed. "Safe travels, Ms. Carter!"

The chorus followed her out. "Safe travels, Ms. Carter!"

The deference was night and day from her arrival. Outside, Harrison Whitmore leaned against his car, arms crossed.

He pushed off the vehicle, storming toward her.

Evelyn's stomach dropped. "Harrison? What are you—"

His hand came up, ruffling her hair roughly. "Evelyn Carter," he growled. "Do you have a death wish?"

She blinked up at him.

"Maximilian Blackwood isn't some street thug. He's Pamore's most dangerous crime lord. Ruthless. Unpredictable."

Evelyn fought a smile. She'd found the man rather... puppy-like, actually.

"Harrison, look at me. I'm fine."

He exhaled sharply. His men had reported everything, but the what-ifs haunted him. What if something had gone wrong?

"Promise me," he demanded, cupping her face. "No more solo missions. You tell me first."
###Chapter 317 The Truth Revealed

Evelyn gave a compliant nod, her voice steady. "I've got this, Harrison. No need to worry."

"With Maximilian pledging loyalty to you now," Harrison continued, "navigating Sterling Enterprises will be significantly smoother for you."

This turn of events caught Evelyn off guard. In her mind, she'd merely acquired another reluctant subordinate.

She couldn't have known this seemingly minor decision would send shockwaves through Sterling Enterprises' underground network.

—

Isabella remained blissfully unaware of the unfolding drama.

At this very moment, she sat before the vanity in her hotel suite, meticulously applying her makeup. A self-satisfied smile curved her lips as she admired her reflection.

A sharp knock interrupted her preening. Her face lit up as she hurried to answer.

"Darling, I've been waiting—"

The door swung open to reveal Sebastian, but unlike their usual private encounters, he stood flanked by several imposing bodyguards.

Isabella's smile faltered. "Sebastian? What's with the entourage today?"

His expression remained grim. Without answering, he dismissed his men with a curt gesture before stepping inside and shutting the door behind him.

She approached him with practiced ease. "Sebastian, what's bothering you today? Let me fix that for you."

Her manicured fingers trailed down his chest, inching dangerously lower—

Until his hand clamped around her wrist, stopping her mid-motion.

"Enough. Not today."

Isabella froze. In all their years together, Sebastian had never spoken to her with such icy detachment. Forcing a smile, she tried again.

"So... about Evelyn Carter. Is she... taken care of?"

At the mention of Evelyn, Sebastian turned slowly, his gaze piercing. "What do you think?"

Missing the warning in his tone, Isabella laughed brightly. "That wretched girl finally got what she deserved! No one humiliates Isabella Delaney and—"

"Wake up," Sebastian cut in coldly. "Your fantasy ends here."

Her smile slipped. "What... what do you mean? Did something go wrong?"

Sebastian's laugh held no humor. "Of all people, Isabella, why did you have to cross Evelyn Carter? Even I underestimated her."

Regret gnawed at him now.

Why had he ever agreed to help Isabella? He'd assumed Evelyn was just another spoiled heiress. Who could have predicted Maximilian Blackwood himself would swear fealty to her? As Maximilian's subordinate, Sebastian stood no chance against Evelyn's newfound power.

Isabella's face drained of color. "She's... still alive?"

Sebastian's nod confirmed her worst fears.

She knew Evelyn. If she survived, she'd dig until she uncovered the truth. And when she did...

"Sebastian... she won't trace this back to me, will she?"

He tilted her chin up with one finger, his smile chilling. "Scared now, little dove?"

For the first time, Isabella found Sebastian's gaze unrecognizable—and terrifying.

"You'll protect me, won't you?" Her voice trembled as tears welled up. "Please, Sebastian! Don't let her get to me! I'm begging you!"
###Chapter 318 Nathan Intervenes

No matter how desperately Isabella begged, Sebastian stood his ground. Eventually, he shoved her away with brutal force.

"Guards!" Sebastian barked. "Restrain her immediately."

Silence.

His brow furrowed as he stormed toward the doorway. "I gave you an order! Are you all deaf—"

The words died in his throat.

Nathan Sterling's piercing gaze locked onto him, radiating such intensity that Sebastian instinctively stepped back.

"Mr. Sterling? To what do we owe this... unexpected visit?"

Nathan ignored him, striding past into the room. When Isabella saw him, hope flashed across her tear-streaked face.

She scrambled forward. "Nathan! Thank God you're here! Please, you have to help me!"

He halted abruptly.

Looking down at her, his expression held no sympathy—only cold disdain.

"Mr. Sterling," Sebastian ventured cautiously, "surely you're not here for her?" Isabella's eyes lit up.

"Take me away from here!" she pleaded, clutching Nathan's sleeve. "I'll do anything! I swear I'll never bother Evelyn again!"

Nathan's lips curled in a humorless smile. His voice cut like ice. "Sebastian. I'm taking her. You'll have her back in two hours."

Confusion flickered across Sebastian's face, but he knew better than to challenge Nathan directly.

He shot Isabella a venomous look. "Mr. Sterling, is this treacherous woman really worth your time? Let me dispose of her in Dunhill's slums—"

Nathan didn't even glance his way. "This isn't a negotiation. It's a courtesy notification."

With that, he signaled his men. They seized Isabella roughly, ignoring Sebastian's darkening expression.

Fury erupted as Sebastian slammed his fist into the wall. "This isn't over, Sterling."

...

Nathan brought Isabella to an elegant Victorian townhouse.

His guards threw her to the marble floor without ceremony.

Struggling up, Isabella approached Nathan with desperate hope. "You still care about me, don't you? Get me out of Pamore—"

"Enough." Nathan's voice froze her in place. "I want the truth, Isabella. Nothing more."

"The... truth?" Her confusion seemed genuine.

Nathan turned slowly. His gaze bored into her. "That child. Whose was it really?"

Three seconds of silence. Then understanding dawned.

Seeing his grim expression, Isabella suddenly laughed—a wild, triumphant sound echoing through the grand hall.

When her laughter subsided, a calculating gleam entered her eyes. "So that's why you came? For Evelyn's sake, isn't it?"

Nathan remained impassive. "Answer the question."

She shook her head, smirking. "Why not believe it was yours, Nathan? The evidence is gone now. Who can prove otherwise?"

Her voice dripped with smug satisfaction, as if she'd finally found leverage against the mighty Nathan Sterling.
###Chapter 319 The Ultimatum

Isabella's lips curled into a sly smile. "I'll reveal everything, but on one condition. You must guarantee my safe departure from Sterling Enterprises and provide enough funds to last me a lifetime."

"Agreed."

Nathan's immediate response caught her off guard. Never had she imagined he would concede so easily for Evelyn's sake.

"Such regrets now, Nathan? How poetic."

"Don't waste my time. My tolerance has limits."

Isabella shook her head slowly. "Do you take me for a fool? I know you won't let me leave if I confess now. Unless..." Her eyes gleamed with cunning. "You personally ensure my departure. Only then will I tell you everything."

Nathan's expression darkened with disgust.

"No one threatens me and lives to tell the tale."

With a snap of his fingers, his security team materialized from the shadows.

"Deliver her to Sebastian. We're past the agreed timeframe."

Panic flashed across Isabella's face as realization dawned. This wasn't a bluff.

"No! Nathan, please—"

Her pleas fell on deaf ears as the guards seized her arms, dragging her toward the exit.

A cold dread gripped Isabella's heart. Being handed to Sebastian Blackwood meant certain death. Survival instincts kicked in.

"That night you were drunk! Nothing happened between us! The child wasn't yours—it was all a setup!"

Her confession spilled out between sobs. The guards paused at Nathan's subtle gesture.

"I've made terrible mistakes. Spare me, Nathan! I don't want to die!" Tears streaked her contorted face.

The heavy doors swung open at that moment.

Evelyn stood framed in the doorway, her expression unreadable. Once, her eyes had burned with passion for Nathan. Now they reflected only glacial calm.

"Mr. Sterling, was this your grand revelation?"

The pieces clicked into place.

"The package came from you, didn't it?"

Nathan offered no denial.

Evelyn understood his elaborate charade now. This theatrical confrontation with Isabella served one purpose—to prove his innocence regarding the supposed child.

With a dismissive wave, Nathan signaled the guards to remove Isabella.

Silence descended upon the grand hall, leaving only former spouses who now stood as strangers.

"Evelyn," Nathan's voice held uncharacteristic vulnerability, "if Isabella caused our separation, does this truth change anything? There was never anything between us. Can we... start anew?"

Evelyn remained silent.

The proud Nathan Sterling, who had never bowed to anyone, had humbled himself today—all for her to know the truth.
###Chapter 320 Empty Gestures

Evelyn averted her eyes, her silence speaking volumes.

Nathan pressed on, his voice strained. "I'm aware of the pain Isabella has caused you. She'll answer for every single thing she's done. You must be wondering why I intervened to get her released, but it was all leading to this moment."

At his words, Evelyn finally met his gaze.

"Mr. Sterling, I appreciate your efforts, but this changes nothing."

Panic flashed across Nathan's face. "That's not true, Evelyn! How can you say that?"

She didn't respond, but the truth burned in her chest. Even if nothing physical had occurred between Nathan and Isabella, the emotional betrayal had left scars too deep to heal.

The car accident had been her wake-up call, revealing Nathan's true colors. She refused to repeat past mistakes.

"Happiness can't be manufactured, Mr. Sterling," she said quietly. "Words can't mend a shattered heart. I've moved on from us. Please don't waste your time chasing ghosts."

Without waiting for a response, Evelyn turned on her heel and walked away.

Nathan reached out desperately, his fingers grasping at empty air as her sleeve slipped through them.

He stood frozen, watching helplessly as she disappeared from view.

Only then did the crushing realization hit him - he'd lost the most important person in his life.

Time blurred. Nathan remained motionless until his bodyguard finally approached.

"Mr. Sterling, what should we do with the woman waiting outside?"

Nathan's expression turned glacial. "Deliver her to Sebastian. Whether she lives or dies is no longer my concern."

"Understood, sir."

—

The car ride passed in a haze. Evelyn stared blankly out the window, her mind miles away.

The ringing phone startled her.

"Dominic?"

Her brother's voice carried concern. "I heard you took down Maximilian Blackwood's entire operation in Pamore?"

Evelyn forced a laugh. "News travels fast to you."

"Naturally. I keep tabs on my little sister. Though you don't sound like someone who just pulled off a major victory."

"It's nothing," she deflected. "Just tired. My mind's elsewhere."

"Evie," Dominic's tone softened, "you've been full of surprises lately. Kingsley Industries is thriving under your leadership. Profits are up thirty percent this quarter."

He continued, "There's a business summit in Frenda coming up. Why don't you come home for a while? Take a breather."

The idea appealed to her. "When is it?"

"Three days. Come if you can."

Frenda called to her like a siren's song. After so long away, home sounded perfect.

"I'll wrap things up here and fly back tomorrow."

True to her word, Evelyn and Maxwell boarded the Kingsley private jet the next morning.

The plane touched down smoothly on the family airstrip.

Elliot stood waiting, his face lighting up when he spotted her descending the stairs.

"Evie!"

She sprinted across the tarmac and launched herself into her brother's arms.

"Elliot, I've missed you so much!"

He ruffled her hair affectionately. "Still such a drama queen."

Evelyn grinned and stuck out her tongue. "Only for you."
###Chapter 321 Her Brothers Spoil Her

"Grandfather was thrilled to hear of your return and personally ordered the kitchen to prepare all your favorite delicacies."

Evelyn's eyes sparkled with delight. "I'm being utterly spoiled!"

"You little foodie," Elliot teased as the siblings exchanged playful banter before settling into the family limousine.

The Kingsley Estate spanned across thousands of acres, requiring a fifteen-minute drive from the private airstrip to the main mansion.

Upon arrival, the entire household staff stood at attention by the grand entrance. "Welcome home, Ms. Kingsley!" they chorused respectfully.

Evelyn acknowledged them with a warm smile before stepping inside.

Her rare homecoming had brought all three brothers together. Leonard was equally delighted, pulling Evelyn aside for an extended conversation in the library.

He finally released her when she couldn't suppress her yawns past 10 pm.

"Enough chatter! You must be exhausted from your travels. Get some rest now. Don't forget our chess rematch tomorrow morning."

Evelyn nodded sleepily. "Goodnight, Grandfather!"

As she ascended the marble staircase, she found her three brothers leaning casually against the corridor walls, clearly waiting for her.

Dominic spoke first. "Since you're rarely home, I'm taking you shopping tomorrow. Pick out whatever designer pieces catch your eye."

Elliot rolled his eyes. "How predictable, Dom! Evelyn, I've just opened a state-of-the-art gaming lounge. The VIP experience is unmatched - you'll love it."

Julian cleared his throat dramatically. "Actually, I've discovered several Michelin-starred restaurants in Pearl District. The tasting menus are exquisite. Care to join me?"

The competitive energy between her brothers amused Evelyn to no end.

"I'm completely drained. Can we discuss this tomorrow?"

The brothers exchanged determined glances. "Absolutely not. Choose one," they demanded in unison.

Evelyn sighed dramatically before offering a compromise. "What if I spend half a day with each of you?"

This solution visibly pleased them. Julian immediately claimed, "I'll take morning then!"

"Afternoon's mine!" Elliot declared.

Left with no choice, Dominic conceded, "Fine. I'll escort you to the tech summit the following day."

Perfect! Evelyn beamed at the arrangement.

"Sounds wonderful to me."

After bidding her brothers goodnight, she finally retreated to her suite. The moment her head touched the silk pillows, she was fast asleep.

The next morning, Evelyn awoke to find a face hovering inches from hers.

"Ahh!"

Her instinctive shove was halted mid-motion when she recognized Julian. She exhaled sharply.

"Julian! It's dawn! What are you doing?"

He grinned unrepentantly. "Our breakfast reservation, remember? Or did you forget our Pearl District plans already?"

Evelyn rubbed her temples. "I remember, but your enthusiasm is... overwhelming."

Julian presented an outfit from his latest designer collaboration.

"When my baby sister finally visits? Of course I'm excited! This is limited edition - designed just for you."

Shaking her head fondly, Evelyn accepted the garments and disappeared into the walk-in closet.

She had to admit - Julian's fashion sense was impeccable.
###Chapter 322 An Unexpected Encounter

The outfit hugged Evelyn's curves flawlessly, as if tailored specifically for her. Every stitch screamed elegance, perfectly matching her refined taste.

"Julian, your fashion sense never disappoints," Evelyn complimented with a pleased smile.

Julian smirked, basking in the praise. "Well, darling, it depends on who I'm dressing."

Evelyn teased, "Your future wife is one lucky woman!"

Julian rolled his eyes. "What wife? I'm not even dating anyone. Stop with the nonsense."

Evelyn laughed. "Oh, don't be shy. Come on, let's get going."

To avoid being mobbed by fans, Julian disguised himself before slipping into his sleek sports car with Evelyn.

They arrived at the city's most luxurious shopping district—a paradise for high-end brands and elite shoppers.

Evelyn stepped out first, waiting by the curb while Julian parked.

But before she could enjoy the moment, a shrill voice called out, "Evelyn? Is that you?"

Evelyn stiffened, recognizing the voice instantly. She turned to see her old school rival, Sylvia Montgomery, flanked by her two ever-present minions.

Suppressing a sigh, Evelyn forced a polite smile. "What a surprise."

Sylvia came from a family that owned an electronics empire, spoiled rotten since birth. She barely qualified as an heiress, but that didn’t stop her from flaunting it.

Back in school, Evelyn had kept her true identity hidden, blending in as a scholarship student. She’d even taken part-time jobs to care for stray animals, leading everyone to believe she was poor.

Yet, she had consistently topped the class, earning scholarships while Sylvia struggled to keep up. The resentment had festered over the years.

"Evelyn, we haven’t seen you since graduation! Where have you been hiding? Finally found some lowly job?" Sylvia sneered.

Evelyn shrugged. "Actually, I'm unemployed. Got any leads for me?"

"Sylvia runs her family’s company now—Montgomery Electronics! She’s the general manager, making six figures a year," one of the minions bragged.

"If you beg nicely, maybe she’ll throw you a bone," the other added with a smirk.

Sylvia nodded smugly. "We do need a janitor. Interested? The pay’s decent—$300 a month. Perfect for someone like you."

The two minions burst into laughter.

Evelyn had no patience for this. She turned to leave.

But Sylvia wasn’t done. She grabbed Evelyn’s wrist, her grip tight. "Oh, don’t walk away. We’re just catching up."
###Chapter 323 The Truth Revealed

"Don't run away so soon. It's been ages since we last met. There's no need to feel embarrassed, even if life hasn't been kind to you. We won't judge."

Sylvia Montgomery gave Evelyn Carter a pitying look.

"What a coincidence. I was just having lunch with some old classmates. Why don't you join us? This might be your only chance to step into a high-end restaurant. Come, see how the other half lives."

Evelyn sighed in irritation. "Sylvia, will you ever grow up?"

"You were always trailing behind me in school. And now? You think flashing your wealth makes you superior?"

"Don't you know pride comes before a fall? Be careful—you might regret this."

Sylvia hadn't expected Evelyn's sharp tongue to still sting just as much. She had never managed to outshine her before, and now, she found herself speechless again.

But that only fueled her determination to humiliate Evelyn today.

This was her chance to put Evelyn in her place—to remind her of the vast gap between them.

People like Evelyn, born with nothing, should know their role was to serve those like her.

"It's just a friendly gathering with old classmates, Evelyn. No need to be rude." Sylvia shot her friends a meaningful glance.

They immediately understood, closing in on Evelyn and tugging at her sleeves.

"Sylvia's being generous by inviting you. Not everyone gets this opportunity. Don't be ungrateful."

Before Evelyn could refuse, they practically dragged her into the car.

Evelyn had no interest in entertaining them, but their persistence ignited a fire inside her.

If they wanted a show, she’d give them one.

Inside the car, Sylvia deliberately flaunted her brand-new Hermès bag.

Nora Whitaker gasped. "Sylvia, is this the latest collection? I heard it costs over a hundred thousand dollars!"

Kimberly Fairchild chimed in. "It's not just about the price. You need VIP status to even get your hands on one. This is a limited edition. Sylvia, I'm so jealous!"

Sylvia basked in their admiration, shooting a triumphant glance at Evelyn. She doubted Evelyn even recognized the brand and decided to rub it in.

"Oh, it's nothing special. Last month, my father gifted me a penthouse worth five million dollars."

"Five million?! That's a luxury mansion!"

"Sylvia, you have to invite us over!"

Sylvia cleared her throat. "It's still being renovated. I'll host you all once it's done."

"You're so generous, Sylvia!"

"We adore you!"

Evelyn couldn't help but laugh.

Sylvia's face darkened instantly.

"What's so funny?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Nothing. I just find your little performance amusing."

Nora sneered. "You're just jealous. You could never afford a penthouse, even if you worked your whole life."

"Jealousy is an ugly look, Evelyn."

Evelyn smirked and delivered the killing blow. "That bag is from last season's collection. This year's design is completely different."

Sylvia's face paled. "You're lying! You know nothing about fashion!"

"Am I? Why don't we check the official website right now?"
###Chapter 324 The Reunion

Evelyn's words sent a jolt of unease through Sylvia, making her clutch her designer bag tighter.

"Honestly, what would a small-town girl like you know about high society? I won't even dignify this with an argument."

The two socialites flanking Sylvia exchanged knowing glances. While they doubted Sylvia would carry a knockoff, something about Evelyn's confidence unsettled them.

Still, loyalty prevailed. "Ignore her, Sylvia," one whispered. "Soon enough she'll see how out of her league she is."

The reassurance eased Sylvia's tension slightly.

Evelyn suppressed a smirk, curious to see how this little drama would unfold.

Meanwhile, Julian pulled his car into the parking space, scanning the crowded plaza for Evelyn. When he couldn't spot her, he dialed her number.

The call connected briefly before being cut off. A text appeared: "Something came up. Talk later."

Julian sighed, typing a simple "Understood" before pocketing his phone.

Sylvia led the group to Frenda's most exclusive restaurant - The Silver Spoon. Membership required either seven-figure wealth or political influence just to get past the velvet ropes.

As Sylvia stepped from the car, a tuxedoed maître d' materialized with a practiced smile.

"Ms. Montgomery, your usual table awaits."

Sylvia preened. "We'll take the private dining room I reserved."

"Of course, Ms. Montgomery."

The maître d' ushered them inside, where Sylvia's companions immediately began snapping photos of the crystal chandeliers and gold-leaf ceilings, their excitement palpable.

Evelyn remained impassive, her expression unreadable.

Assuming intimidation was working, Sylvia purred, "We're meeting our former classmates, Evelyn. Try not to embarrass yourself."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Are they wild animals? Why would I be nervous?"

Sylvia's mouth opened and closed like a fish before she managed, "I'm trying to teach you proper decorum. Must you always act like some backwater hick?"

A careless shrug was Evelyn's only response.

Sylvia's stiletto tapped an irritated rhythm against the marble floor. That infuriating calmness always got under her skin.

"Your private dining room, Ms. Montgomery."

The maître d' stopped before ornate double doors. Sylvia produced several crisp bills from her Chanel clutch, pressing them into his palm.

"Thank you," she simpered.

The maître d' pocketed the generous tip with a bow. "Enjoy your evening, Ms. Montgomery!"

Once he departed, Nora gushed, "Sylvia, you're too kind! That tip could feed a family for a week!"

"Only the best for my friends," Sylvia replied, shooting Evelyn a pointed look before gesturing toward the doors.

Her friends rushed to open them, allowing Sylvia to make her grand entrance first. They deliberately blocked Evelyn's path before finally permitting her entry.

"Everyone," Sylvia announced, "look who I found!"

The buzz of conversation died as two dozen heads swiveled toward Evelyn.

Recognition dawned first on a woman in a Versace dress.

"Evelyn Carter? Is that really you?"

"Where have you been hiding all these years?"

"We should catch up properly!"

Evelyn offered them a serene smile. "It's lovely to see you all again."
###Chapter 325 Fighting Back

The crowd surrounding Sylvia Montgomery consisted of equally privileged socialites. They sneered at someone like Evelyn Carter, who came from humble beginnings yet dared to mingle in their elite circle during school days.

Their questions grew increasingly pointed as the conversation continued.

"Evelyn, where are you scraping by these days? What's your monthly paycheck?"

"Found anyone to marry you yet? Or are you still single?"

"Need me to set you up with someone decent?"

Evelyn remained silent, her expression unreadable.

Sylvia pretended to intervene. "What kind of questions are these? Evelyn isn't like us. We were all born with silver spoons."

"We never needed jobs - our family businesses were waiting. Evelyn's probably doing menial work! Stop teasing her. We're from different worlds."

Peals of laughter erupted, but Evelyn simply lowered her gaze, unaffected.

Then one sharp-eyed classmate noticed Evelyn's outfit - a rare Chanel limited edition piece, unavailable to the general public and exorbitantly priced.

How could someone like Evelyn afford this?

The words tumbled out before she could stop herself. "Evelyn, where'd you get that knockoff Chanel? The stitching's actually decent."

All eyes turned to Evelyn, finally noticing her impeccable attire.

Yet no one believed it could be genuine.

"That must have cost a fortune, Evelyn!"

"Counterfeits are getting scarily accurate these days."

"Probably found it on some shady online marketplace?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a faint smile. She'd felt their mocking gazes since arrival, treating her like some amusing spectacle.

"You're welcome to search online for this design," Evelyn countered coolly.

The group stiffened. This wasn't the passive Evelyn they remembered from school.

Sylvia adopted an innocent expression. "Evelyn, we're just joking! No harm meant."

The others quickly agreed. "Exactly! Can't you take a joke?"

"Sylvia, don't bother with her."

"She's just some country mouse who wouldn't know fashion if it bit her. Unlike Sylvia, who's representing Sterling Enterprises at tomorrow's business summit."

"Only top industry elites get invited. Sylvia, you're incredible."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "I had no idea the summit's standards had dropped so low."

The group erupted in shocked laughter.

"Evelyn, do you even know what the summit is? Mocking Sylvia? You'd never qualify to attend!"

Evelyn studied the speaker with sudden recognition.

"You're Iris Montgomery. Your family's in traditional retail, right? With e-commerce crushing your business, how many stores have you closed this year?"

Iris paled visibly.

She never expected Evelyn to know her family's financial troubles.

"That's nonsense! We've pivoted to livestream sales. Our products sell out daily!" Iris snapped defensively.
###Chapter 326 The Secret Behind Her Success

Evelyn gave a subtle nod before continuing, "Isn't Calista one of the most popular influencers right now? Rumor has it she got caught for tax fraud and had to pay millions in fines!"

"Just an online personality, yet involved in such a massive scandal. Her backers must be involved too. This whole situation has caused quite the uproar. I'm certain everyone's heard about it by now."

Iris felt her palms grow clammy. That particular incident had nearly destroyed her family's business, pushing them to the brink of bankruptcy.

But how did Evelyn know these details?

Without missing a beat, Evelyn turned her attention to Nora, one of Sylvia's closest allies.

"Your family specializes in marine aquaculture, correct? The recent typhoon must have devastated your operations. I heard you even resorted to borrowing from loan sharks. Have you managed to settle those debts yet?"

Nora's face drained of color instantly.

Evelyn's piercing gaze then shifted to Kimberly.

"Wasn't your family hit hard by last year's economic downturn? Still struggling with those massive bank loans, I presume?"

Kimberly gasped, stammering, "How... how could you possibly know that?"

Evelyn merely shrugged with practiced nonchalance.

"The how isn't important. What matters is how utterly repulsive your behavior is, hiding behind your so-called power. It's absolutely disgusting."

With that, Evelyn locked eyes with Sylvia.

"Wonderful Electronics has been performing well recently, but Crug Electronics has been gaining significant ground these past two years."

"One careless misstep could topple your entire empire. You'd better make the most of this business summit opportunity. Otherwise, you might lose everything."

Sylvia's face turned ashen with rage, yet she couldn't refute Evelyn's words because every accusation held undeniable truth.

Evelyn felt immense satisfaction seeing them squirm. Mission accomplished, she saw no reason to linger. Rising gracefully, she prepared to leave.

"I'll take my leave now. Goodbye."

With those final words, Evelyn exited the private room, leaving behind a stunned silence.

This content is taken from N?v/elDr(a)m/a.Org.

Someone finally broke the silence. "Who exactly is Evelyn Carter? How does she have such insider knowledge about all our businesses?"

"Could she be some hidden powerhouse? And we were just insulting her!"

"That's impossible! Back in school, she was practically penniless. There's no way she's wealthy now!"

Sylvia remained silent, seething internally. Pulling out her phone with trembling fingers, she made a call. "I need you to investigate someone for me - Evelyn Carter."

¡­

Outside the private room, Evelyn chuckled softly to herself.

As she stepped out of the restaurant, she spotted Julian's sleek sports car waiting at the curb.

"Julian, what are you doing here?"

Julian flashed her a concerned smile. "I got worried about you, so I came to check. They didn't give you any trouble, did they?"

"You seriously underestimate me."

Julian discreetly noted the names of everyone inside. "Don't worry, I'll find an opportunity to teach them proper manners later."

Evelyn quickly stopped him. "Let's just go. You promised to take me somewhere delicious, remember? I'm starving."

Julian reached out and playfully ruffled her hair. "Some things never change with you, little foodie."

As Evelyn slid into Julian's car, neither noticed Nora watching from the shadows, her suspicions now confirmed.

"Sylvia, you won't believe what I just saw! Evelyn got into a luxury sports car! She's definitely being kept by that man!"

"After all these years, to think she'd become some rich man's mistress. How utterly shameless!"
###Chapter 327 She's Also a Kingsley

Gasps echoed through the room as judgmental whispers swirled around Evelyn. The venom in their voices was palpable.

"That impostor doesn't deserve to breathe the same air as us."

"Someone needs to put her in her place."

"Let's make sure that gold-digger never shows her face here again."

The next morning, Sylvia's phone rang with disappointing news. "Ms. Montgomery, our team found zero records on Evelyn Carter," the investigator admitted.

Sylvia's grip tightened on her phone. "Incompetent fools! How hard is it to track one nobody in all of Kingsford?"

"With all due respect," the investigator hesitated, "it's almost like someone deliberately erased her digital footprint."

Sylvia scoffed. The idea of that plain Jane having such connections was laughable.

"Save your excuses. Consider our contract terminated!"

She slammed the phone down just as her father entered.

Conrad Montgomery studied his daughter's stormy expression. "What's troubling you this early, darling?"

"Nothing important, Father." Sylvia forced a smile. "Today's the Global Business Summit. We should focus on securing new partnerships."

Conrad's face lit with approval. "That's my girl. And you'll want to impress - I've heard the Kingsleys are attending this year."

At the mention of the powerful family, Sylvia's pulse quickened.

"Will Dominic be there?"

Conrad chuckled. "Always thinking about Kingsley Industries' CEO, aren't you?"

A flush crept up Sylvia's neck. Dominic Kingsley was the crown prince of Kingsford's business world - brilliant, devastatingly handsome, and heir to one of the largest fortunes globally.

Every socialite dreamed of catching his eye. Sylvia was no exception.

"Father, a Kingsley alliance would elevate our status overnight. We'd have companies begging to work with us."

Conrad nodded thoughtfully. "True. Though I hear the Kingsley heiress recently returned from abroad. The family dotes on her immensely. Perhaps befriending her would be your best strategy."

Sylvia's stomach twisted.

The Kingsley daughter?

For a bizarre moment, Evelyn's face flashed in her mind. Both shared the same surname.

She immediately dismissed the ridiculous thought. Evelyn dressed like a thrift store mannequin. The Kingsley heiress probably had diamonds sewn into her shoelaces.

"Do we have a photo of Ms. Kingsley?"

Conrad shook his head. "The family guards her privacy fiercely. But she'll be attending with Dominic today. Watch for the woman at his side and make your move."

"Don't worry, Father." Sylvia squared her shoulders. "I'll have the Kingsleys eating out of my hand by sunset."

After final preparations, Sylvia summoned her chauffeur.

Meanwhile at Kingsley Manor, Dominic had arranged for Paris's top stylist to attend to his sister at dawn.

This summit marked Evelyn's formal debut as a Kingsley. Every detail had to be perfect.

The walk-in closet overflowed with couture gowns - enough to outfit a small nation.
###Chapter 328 The Corporate Gala

"Evelyn, what do you think of this one?" Julian held up a sophisticated navy blue dress with delicate lace sleeves.

Elliot, never one to be outshone, presented a daring crimson gown with a plunging neckline. "This would make you shine like the star you are, little sister."

"Elliot, that's too bold for a business event," Julian argued.

"And yours is too dull for our Evelyn," Elliot countered.

The brothers turned to their sister when neither would concede.

"Which do you prefer?"

Evelyn studied both dresses before reaching for a soft lavender designer piece hanging nearby. "You both have excellent taste, but I think subtle elegance suits tonight's occasion better."

Julian and Elliot exchanged glances. "Tie game," Julian declared. "This round doesn't count, Elliot."

Evelyn laughed at their competitive nature, linking arms with both brothers. "Dominic, Julian, I appreciate you both."

"Don't be silly," Elliot said affectionately, squeezing her shoulder. "You'll always be our princess. Now go change - Nathan's waiting."

As Evelyn descended the grand staircase in her lavender gown, all conversation in the foyer ceased. The dress hugged her curves perfectly while maintaining an air of refined sophistication.

"Stunning," Julian breathed.

Elliot nodded approvingly. "The simplicity highlights your natural beauty. That designer deserves a raise."

Evelyn's cheeks warmed under their praise. "Did you two raid a honey factory this morning?" She moved toward Nathan, who stood waiting by the door. "Shall we?"

Nathan's approving gaze swept over her. "Perfect choice." He offered his arm as they stepped outside where a limited edition Rolls-Royce Phantom idled at the curb.

The moment they arrived at the gala venue, Evelyn spotted Adrian Prescott near the entrance. Her eyebrows lifted in surprise.

Nathan explained, "Adrian's taken over Prescott Enterprises. They're co-hosting tonight's summit."

"I should say hello."

Nathan nodded. In his assessment, Adrian remained a worthy contender for Evelyn's affection. "I'll see you inside."

Adrian's face lit up when he noticed Evelyn approaching. "Evelyn! You're back in town?"

"Congratulations on your new position," Evelyn said warmly.

"Thank you." Adrian's smile widened.

Their easy familiarity didn't go unnoticed. While few recognized Evelyn yet, Adrian's prominence in business circles made their interaction fuel for speculation.

"Would you like me to escort you inside?" Adrian offered.

Evelyn shook her head, noticing the clipboard in his hand. "You're clearly busy. I can manage."

Adrian nodded reluctantly. "Until later then."
###Chapter 329 Insulting Her

Sylvia Montgomery had arrived at the venue ahead of time. After circling the space, she found a quiet corner to compose herself.

Her breath caught when she spotted Evelyn Carter at the entrance.

"Evelyn?" Sylvia whispered in disbelief. Her companions followed her gaze.

Nora Whitaker and Kimberly Fairchild exchanged shocked glances. They remembered seeing Evelyn getting into that sleek sports car yesterday.

Nora sneered, "Did she crash this party for free champagne?"

Sylvia's lips tightened. Evelyn's presence felt like a personal insult. "They'll let anyone in these days," she muttered darkly.

Kimberly saw her chance. "Want me to put that gold-digger in her place?"

Sylvia's silence was permission enough.

The two women stalked toward Evelyn with predatory grace. "Well, look who's here," Nora drawled. "Did you lose your sugar daddy's invitation, or are you just here to mooch?"

Evelyn turned slowly, her green eyes sharpening. She took in their smirks before spotting Sylvia watching with cold amusement across the room.

"You're hardly in any position to question my presence here," Evelyn said calmly.

The barb hit its mark. Their smiles faltered. They'd come as Sylvia's plus-ones—how had Evelyn known?

Nora recovered first. "What the hell is that supposed to mean?"

Evelyn's lips curved. "I could ask you the same thing. Save your pathetic attempts at insults for someone who cares."

Nora's face flushed crimson. She hadn't expected such a cutting response.

Kimberly stepped forward, lowering her voice to a venomous whisper. "We all know what you are, Evelyn. Being some rich man's plaything isn't exactly something to brag about. Should I announce it to the whole room?"

Her words carried just enough to make nearby heads turn.

Seeing Evelyn's stillness, Kimberly smirked at Sylvia before continuing, "Though I suppose in this economy, even being a—"

The slap echoed through the hall.

Kimberly staggered back, clutching her cheek. "You bitch!" she shrieked. "My own mother never hit me! Who do you think you—"

Evelyn sidestepped the lunging woman and swept her leg out. Kimberly crashed to the marble floor, her dress riding up dangerously.

Gasps rippled through the growing crowd as Kimberly scrambled to cover herself. "Stop looking!" she wailed.

Evelyn loomed over her, ice in her gaze. "Next time you open your mouth, I'll make sure you can't close it again."

She turned to leave, only to find Sylvia blocking her path.

"You'll apologize," Sylvia commanded, her voice like frozen steel.
###Chapter 330 The Forced Apology

Sylvia Montgomery played the virtuous heroine before the crowd.

Evelyn Carter had no patience for her theatrics. "Move," she snapped.

Sylvia hadn't anticipated such defiance. Her lips curled in mockery. "Evelyn, you must answer for your actions."

"Striking someone without cause is unacceptable. Apologize now, or I'll have security escort you out."

The spectators murmured in agreement, most siding with Sylvia.

"This isn't a playground for tantrums! Hitting people? The audacity!"

"She owes an apology. Don't make this uglier than it already is."

"Ms. Montgomery is being generous. Show some respect."

Evelyn remained silent, her gaze steady.

Sylvia reveled in the crowd's support, sneering at Evelyn.

"Well? Say you're sorry."

Evelyn's patience snapped. "I won't apologize. She earned every bit of that slap."

Kimberly Fairchild wiped fake tears, playing the victim. "It's fine, Sylvia. I'm sure she didn't mean it."

Her performance only fueled Sylvia's outrage.

"Last chance. Apologize, or I'll have you thrown out immediately."

Evelyn's laugh was icy. "Try it."

Sylvia's fingers flew across her phone. "Security to the east terrace. We have a disturbance."

Hanging up, she smirked. "You brought this on yourself, Evelyn."

A few guests recognized Evelyn's connection to Nathan Sterling and tried mediating. "Ms. Montgomery, perhaps let this go?"

Sylvia scoffed. "Let it go? After she assaulted someone?"

Seeing her resolve, they backed off—no point angering either powerful woman.

Evelyn calmly retrieved her phone. "I didn't hit her unprovoked. The proof is right here."

The crowd buzzed with anticipation.

"She recorded it? Play it!"

"Let's hear the truth!"

Kimberly paled, lunging for the device. Evelyn sidestepped effortlessly.

Then Kimberly's voice rang out, crystal clear:

"Everyone knows you're just a gold-digging mistress. Does Nathan Sterling even remember your name?"

The crowd's expressions shifted instantly.

"Holy hell. She called her a mistress to her face!"

"That slap was overdue."

"What trash talks like that at a gala?"

"Check the guest list—I bet she crashed."

Sylvia's face darkened. She hadn't counted on Evelyn's recording.

Kimberly shrank under the glares, her earlier bravado crumbling.

Evelyn pocketed her phone. "Still want that apology, Sylvia?"

The security team arrived, hesitating at the tense scene.

Sylvia's jaw tightened. This wasn't the humiliation she'd planned—but it was the one she'd gotten.
###Chapter 331 The Tables Turn

"Don't believe a word she's saying. It's all lies." Kimberly scrambled to defend herself.

Just then, Adrian came rushing over. His long strides carried him directly to Evelyn, concern etched across his handsome features.

"Are you alright, Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn gave a casual shrug. "Perfectly fine."

But Adrian had already heard the damning recording. His voice turned icy. "Ms. Carter is a distinguished guest I personally invited. Do you honestly think you can disrespect her like this?"

The crowd fell silent under Adrian's authoritative tone, people dispersing with awkward murmurs.

Sylvia stood frozen in shock.

She couldn't comprehend why Adrian Prescott would show such deference to Evelyn. Blinking rapidly, she pasted on a bright smile and approached.

"Mr. Prescott, I'm Sylvia Montgomery from Radiant Electronics. What an honor to meet you."

Her attempt at flattery fell flat as Adrian completely ignored her. Instead, he turned to Kimberly beside her.

"Did you just insult Evelyn?"

Kimberly looked utterly bewildered, still processing the sudden turn of events.

Without hesitation, Adrian signaled security. "Escort her out immediately."

The guards moved swiftly, efficiently removing a protesting Kimberly from the premises.

With that handled, Adrian guided Evelyn inside, leaving Sylvia gaping after them.

Now more than ever, Sylvia burned with curiosity about Evelyn's true identity.

The moment Evelyn entered the main hall, she became the center of attention. Important guests approached her with respectful greetings, which she acknowledged with polite grace.

Sylvia's stomach twisted with conflicting emotions as she witnessed the scene.

Then Dominic Kingsley made his entrance.

Sylvia's gaze instantly locked onto the powerful CEO. She quickly smoothed her dress and checked her reflection before approaching.

"Mr. Kingsley, I'm Sylvia Montgomery from Radiant Electronics. What a pleasant surprise to meet you here today. The honor is entirely mine."

She extended her hand with practiced charm.

Dominic remained stone-faced, leaving her hand hanging awkwardly in mid-air. Undeterred, Sylvia pressed on. "Mr. Kingsley, did you come alone tonight? Perhaps I could show you around?"

Dominic's response was curt. "That won't be necessary, Ms. Montgomery."

His gaze had already found Evelyn across the room. "If you'll excuse me."

With that, he strode purposefully toward Evelyn.

The gathered elite exchanged knowing glances. When someone of Dominic Kingsley's stature showed such clear preference, everyone took notice.

"Mr. Kingsley, might we know who this is?"

Someone dared to voice the question burning in everyone's minds.

Sylvia followed the exchange, her eyes darkening with jealousy. She'd never imagined Dominic would be so familiar with Evelyn.

What exactly was their relationship?

The answer seemed obvious, yet Sylvia refused to accept it. Her nails dug into her palms as she fought to maintain composure.

As the anticipation built, Dominic made the announcement with evident pride. "This is Evelyn Carter, the jewel of the Kingsley family. Our most treasured princess."

The revelation sent shockwaves through the crowd.

No one had guessed that Evelyn was the legendary Kingsley heiress.

Sylvia's legs nearly gave way beneath her.

She'd just offended the Kingsley family's beloved daughter.

"Ms. Carter, your business acumen is legendary. You've proven yourself every bit your brothers' equal in managing Kingsley Industries. What an honor to finally meet the brilliant mind behind such success."
###Chapter 332 The Price of Arrogance

"Ms. Carter, I specialize in international commerce and would be honored to establish a partnership with Kingsley Industries."

"Our firm handles global supply chain solutions. We'd appreciate your expert guidance moving forward."

Evelyn maintained her poised smile as the crowd showered her with admiration, her dignified demeanor earning numerous favorable impressions.

Several business leaders immediately proposed collaborations. Seizing the moment, Evelyn secured multiple lucrative contracts for Kingsley Industries.

Sylvia watched the scene unfold with growing horror.

Her carefully constructed world had shattered the instant Dominic revealed Evelyn's true identity.

She stood frozen, remembering all the times she'd mocked and belittled Evelyn during their school days. The bitter taste of regret filled her mouth.

She'd ruined everything.

"Sylvia! Why are you just standing there? I told you to network with Ms. Carter and secure contracts!" Conrad Montgomery hissed as he pulled his daughter aside.

Sylvia barely registered her father's words. Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms, but she felt no pain.

She couldn't possibly tell her father she'd already burned that bridge. Instead, she forced a smile.

"Of course, Father. I'll handle it." With false confidence, Sylvia approached Evelyn.

She inhaled deeply, steeling herself to swallow her pride. By the time she reached Evelyn, her smile looked painfully bright.

"Evelyn, let me propose a toast! To our unexpected reunion!"

Sylvia extended a champagne flute toward Evelyn with exaggerated cheer.

Evelyn glanced at the offered glass but made no move to accept it, letting the silence stretch uncomfortably.

Sylvia cleared her throat, masking her discomfort.

"Not drinking? No problem - I'll drink for both of us!" She downed the champagne in one gulp.

Evelyn's gaze remained icy. "A reunion? We weren't exactly friends, Sylvia."

The barb hit its mark. Sylvia rushed to apologize. "Evelyn, I was wrong before. I'm truly sorry."

Evelyn's laugh held no warmth. "If apologies fixed everything, we wouldn't need courts."

Sylvia's smile faltered. She'd humbled herself, yet Evelyn showed no mercy. Anger simmered beneath her carefully constructed calm.

"Evelyn, I've apologized. How much longer will you hold this grudge?"

The words tasted like ash in her mouth. Every second of this charade chipped away at her composure.

Evelyn's lips curved into a humorless smile.

"Amusing, Sylvia. Weren't you the one who orchestrated that little scene earlier with the waiter?"

Sylvia's face drained of color.

Evelyn continued, "And shall we revisit our history? I have quite the catalog of memories to choose from."

"Evelyn, I was foolish back then. Please, forgive me."

Another hollow laugh. "Forgiveness isn't automatic, Sylvia. Not after everything."

"Then what will it take?" Sylvia demanded, her mask of contrition slipping.

The air between them crackled with unspoken threats and long-buried grievances. Around them, the party continued unaware of the silent war raging between the two women.
###Chapter 333 Strike at the Heart

Evelyn's piercing gaze locked onto Sylvia, who instinctively recoiled under the intensity.

A direct strike to the core.

Evelyn understood exactly what mattered most to Sylvia.

With deliberate calmness, she delivered the blow. "It's time for a complete overhaul at Radiant Electronics. You should withdraw from the upcoming industry summit."

Sylvia's reaction was immediate. "Absolutely not—"

The words escaped before she could stop them. Radiant Electronics represented her family's last hope. Withdrawing from the summit would be catastrophic.

"Evelyn, I'll agree to anything but this."

Evelyn remained unmoved. "Voluntary withdrawal leaves room for recovery. Forced withdrawal after refusal... well, Radiant might not survive the consequences."

Sylvia's legs nearly gave way.

A wave of terror washed over her. She'd never imagined Evelyn could be this ruthless.

Regret flooded her, yet desperation made her try again. "Evelyn, Radiant is everything to my family. Don't do this."

"I'll apologize properly."

Evelyn walked away without acknowledgment, leaving Sylvia's pleas hanging in the air.

All strength drained from Sylvia's body. She collapsed to the floor as a cold breeze chilled her sweat-drenched back.

Evelyn showed no mercy!

"Ms. Carter is truly blessed - impeccable family background and extraordinary talent."

"In just six months leading Kingsley Industries, she's increased profits by 10%."

"For a multinational that size? The numbers are staggering."

"I envy Ms. Carter's business acumen."

The praise surrounding Evelyn made Sylvia's skin crawl. Watching Evelyn bask in admiration ignited unbearable jealousy.

She scoffed loudly. "She's riding on family connections! No real talent - just a pretty face."

"Ms. Montgomery, we're stating facts. What's your problem?"

"Clearly jealous. Ms. Carter has both beauty and brains."

"Weren't you two close earlier? Strange to hear such backstabbing now."

Mockery fueled Sylvia's rage. "Nonsense! Stop brown-nosing and show some dignity!"

To her, they were just sycophants.

"Evelyn and I were classmates. I know her limitations. Watch me prove it."

Curious glances followed her declaration.

"Inside information, Ms. Montgomery?"

Sylvia smirked. "Evelyn was the class dunce - terrible grades, zero social skills."

Disbelieving looks were exchanged.

"Don't believe me?" Sylvia ground her teeth. "I'll show you her true colors shortly."

Burning with humiliation, Sylvia resolved to make Evelyn share her misery.
###Chapter 334 Center Stage Spotlight

Evelyn adjusted her posture and strode confidently toward the wings of the stage.

The business summit's opening ceremony commenced moments later, with the charismatic host taking center stage, his voice brimming with infectious enthusiasm.

Within minutes, he had electrified the atmosphere, bringing the energy in the grand ballroom to a fever pitch.

"Among our distinguished guests tonight, we have the crème de la crème of the corporate world," the host announced. "As tradition dictates, we'll randomly select one visionary to share their leadership insights with us."

As the words left his mouth, Sylvia emerged from backstage, her venomous gaze locking onto Evelyn's position in the audience.

A sinister scheme was already taking shape in her mind.

She sauntered over to her clique of socialites, triumph flashing in her eyes. "Prepare yourselves, ladies. The real entertainment is about to begin."

The puzzled socialites exchanged glances. "Ms. Montgomery, don't overplay your hand," one cautioned.

Sylvia merely lifted her chin in defiance, refusing to dignify their concern with a response.

Her entire being thrummed with anticipation for Evelyn's impending humiliation.

Then the unexpected happened.

The host's gaze suddenly found Evelyn in the crowd. "Tonight we're honored to have among us the brilliant president of Kingsley Industries - Ms. Carter! Let's welcome Ms. Carter to share her corporate wisdom with us."

Evelyn's breath hitched at the unexpected summons.

Dominic hadn't mentioned this protocol during their briefing. Why was she being singled out?

Standing nearby, Dominic's expression darkened as he turned to his assistant. "What's the meaning of this?"

The equally baffled assistant responded, "I'll investigate immediately, Mr. Kingsley."

Dominic's gaze shifted to Evelyn, who maintained perfect composure, a serene smile playing on her lips.

"Never mind—"

Before Dominic could finish, the host continued, "Let's give Ms. Carter a warm welcome!"

Thunderous applause erupted as every eye in the room turned toward Evelyn.

Evelyn remained the picture of poise. Her sweeping gaze eventually landed on Sylvia.

The challenge in Sylvia's stare was unmistakable.

Their eyes locked in a silent battle of wills that lasted several heartbeats.

The socialites beside Sylvia shifted uncomfortably. "Aren't you being rather obvious with your hostility, Ms. Montgomery?" one whispered. "Aren't you afraid of the Kingsleys' retaliation?"

At that moment, fear was the furthest thing from Sylvia's mind.

"Even if they seek revenge," she said coldly, "it'll be after Evelyn's made a fool of herself. If I'm going down, I'm taking her with me."

The socialites exchanged worried glances. "You're playing with fire."

Sylvia ignored them, her focus entirely on Evelyn.

The tension between them was so palpable it seemed to vibrate through the air.

Yet Evelyn merely smiled and ascended the stage with effortless grace.

The room fell silent as she took the microphone. "Good evening everyone, I'm Evelyn Carter."

Her simple, unpretentious introduction radiated quiet confidence, instantly winning over the audience.

"Truth be told," she continued, "I consider myself still learning in the realm of executive leadership. My experience pales in comparison to many of you here tonight."
###Chapter 335 Dazzling Brilliance

The spotlight shifted to Evelyn Carter as she took the stage to share her management expertise.

Her delivery sparkled with wit and charm, striking the perfect balance between confidence and humility. Every word was measured, every pause deliberate.

What began as a simple ten-minute presentation held the entire audience captive. When she concluded, a stunned silence hung in the air before erupting into roaring applause.

"Ms. Carter is nothing short of a business prodigy!"

"Her strategic thinking is impeccable. No wonder Kingsley Industries has flourished under her leadership."

"At such a young age, she possesses remarkable business acumen. Truly inspirational!"

"I'd consider it a privilege to collaborate with Ms. Carter someday."

Sylvia Montgomery stood frozen amidst the praise, her plan backfiring spectacularly. Instead of catching Evelyn off guard, she'd only amplified her rival's spotlight.

How had this happened?

"Wait!" Sylvia's voice cut through the applause as Evelyn prepared to exit the stage.

Abandoning caution, she challenged, "Ms. Carter, I'd like to pose some questions if you don't mind."

Evelyn detected the hostility but remained composed. "Please," she gestured gracefully, "I welcome any questions."

Raised in business circles, Sylvia considered herself Evelyn's equal. She'd prepared particularly thorny questions designed to trip her up.

"In this economic downturn," Sylvia began, "with stock markets crashing and money markets destabilized, how would you prevent capital chain ruptures during such financial crises?"

Murmurs spread through the crowd. This was the million-dollar question plaguing every corporation.

Sylvia smirked, anticipating Evelyn's stumble.

Evelyn lifted the microphone, her voice clear and assured. "Financial leverage becomes our most valuable tool in these conditions..."

For five minutes, Evelyn outlined innovative leverage strategies, drawing admiring murmurs and nods from industry veterans.

Undeterred, Sylvia fired off increasingly complex questions. Each time, Evelyn parried with brilliant, well-reasoned responses.

By the end, several business titans openly praised Evelyn's expertise. As she stepped down, a crowd immediately surrounded her, seeking counsel.

Evelyn had become the undisputed star of the event.

"This...this can't be happening!" Sylvia seethed.

Never had she imagined Evelyn's skills would prove so formidable. Her attempt to humiliate Evelyn had only elevated her further.

"Ms. Montgomery, we should actually thank you," a socialite remarked with a smile. "Without your prompting, we might never have witnessed Ms. Carter's remarkable talents firsthand."

"I must tell my husband about this. A partnership with Kingsley Industries could be tremendously beneficial."
###Chapter 336 An Embarrassment

Sylvia Montgomery's nails dug into her palms until they left crescent-shaped marks. Yet she felt nothing.

Out of nowhere, Conrad Montgomery stormed toward his daughter.

The sharp sound of a slap echoed through the room. Sylvia's hand flew to her stinging cheek in shock. "Father, how could you hit me?"

Conrad's face was purple with rage.

Dominic Kingsley had already sent warnings about Sylvia deliberately causing trouble for Evelyn Carter.

"Do you think you're untouchable now?" Conrad hissed through clenched teeth. "What were my exact instructions before this event? And yet you provoked Ms. Carter?"

Sylvia cradled her burning face.

Never in her life had her doting father struck her - especially not in public over some nobody like Evelyn.

She kept her eyes downcast but seethed inwardly, blaming everything on Evelyn.

"You've jeopardized Montgomery Electronics!" Conrad spat, veins bulging at his temples. "Do you comprehend the damage you've caused?"

Sylvia bit her lip until she tasted blood.

Seeing her stubborn silence, Conrad snapped, "Get out of here before you humiliate us further."

Tears welled in Sylvia's eyes. "Father-"

"Not another word! Your accounts are frozen until we resolve this disaster."

Sylvia visibly deflated, but Conrad had already turned away, scanning the crowd for Evelyn to offer his groveling apology.

Evelyn stood encircled by eager business associates, leaving no breathing room.

When the last sycophant finally retreated, Evelyn collapsed onto a sofa with an exhausted sigh. Then she felt it - that prickling sensation of being watched.

Her sharp gaze swept across the room.

Nothing.

Had she imagined it?

The moment she looked away, a shadow detached itself from behind a pillar. Dark eyes burned into Evelyn's back, filled with turbulent emotions.

"Ms. Carter, you were magnificent!" Adrian Prescott materialized beside her, eyes shining with admiration.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Mr. Prescott, Prescott Enterprises seems to be thriving under your leadership."

"I'd rather be at Kingsley Industries," Adrian confessed. "At least there I saw you daily."

Evelyn remained silent.

Adrian leaned closer. "The moment I returned, my father started badgering me about our families' old marriage arrangement."

He took her hand. "You're single now. Why not fulfill our parents' wishes?"

Evelyn extracted her hand with an awkward laugh. "Mr. Prescott, you'll regret this when you meet your true love."

Adrian's expression turned earnest. "Ms. Carter, my feelings for you are genuine. There's no one else I want."

Evelyn shook her head. What Adrian mistook for love was merely infatuation.

"Let's make a wager, Mr. Prescott."

Adrian's face lit up. "If I win, you'll marry me?"

"Is marriage all you think about?"
###Chapter 337 The Hidden Chamber

Adrian Prescott nodded eagerly. "Absolutely! Nothing else matters right now."

Evelyn Carter tilted her head with a knowing smile. "Though I suspect you'll be meeting your soulmate sooner than you think."

Adrian's eyes widened in shock. "You can't be serious, Evelyn."

"Don't you trust my intuition?" She arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow.

"It's not about trust." Adrian ran a hand through his hair, voice dropping to a murmur. "After knowing you, I doubt anyone else could make my pulse race like this."

He exhaled sharply, shoulders slumping. "But your happiness will always come first, Evelyn."

That single truth had driven him to walk away from Kingsley Industries without hesitation. Her joy meant more than his own shattered dreams.

Some sacrifices were worth making. Even when they left your heart in pieces.

###Chapter 338 Shadow Operations

The man emerged from the dimly lit room, his predatory gaze locking onto Evelyn the moment he saw her. "Well, well," he purred, circling her like a shark. "What rare beauty have we caught in our nets today?"

One of his associates recognized Evelyn and quickly whispered, "Damian, that's Mr. Prescott's guest."

Damian Castillo's smirk vanished at the mention of Adrian Prescott's name. His expression darkened as he advanced toward Evelyn. "What exactly did you see in there?" he demanded, his voice dropping to a dangerous whisper.

Evelyn met his gaze without flinching. "I saw enough to know your 'legitimate business' has a very dark underbelly. Those women didn't come here willingly, did they?"

Damian threw back his head and laughed, the sound devoid of any real humor. "Sharp little thing, aren't you?" His eyes turned glacial. "Pity you won't be leaving to tell anyone about it. A prize like you will fetch an excellent price."

With a snap of his fingers, his men moved to surround her.

Evelyn's lips curled in a cold smile. "You'll have to catch me first."

The moment the words left her mouth, three hulking figures lunged forward. Evelyn's eyes narrowed as she shifted into a defensive stance. Her leg shot out in a blur, connecting with precise brutality against their kneecaps.

The men stumbled back, howling in pain.

Damian's eyes gleamed with perverse excitement. "Oh, this one's got fight in her!" He cracked his knuckles and stepped forward himself.

His attacks came fast and vicious, forcing Evelyn on the defensive within seconds. But she spotted his tell - a slight favoring of his left side. Seizing her chance, she twisted and delivered a devastating kick between his legs.

The effect was immediate.

Damian doubled over, his face turning purple. "Get her!" he wheezed. "Don't let her escape!"

More men poured into the hallway. Evelyn knew she couldn't take them all. Spotting a gap, she bolted for the exit - only to find the steel door locked tight.

"Run all you want, sweetheart," Damian gasped, still clutching himself as his men closed in. "There's nowhere to go."

Evelyn's fingers brushed against the emergency transmitter hidden in her watch. "Human trafficking carries a life sentence," she said coldly. "You'll rot in prison for this."

Her words were met with raucous laughter. "In Frenda?" one thug sneered. "The law doesn't touch people like us. You're just another pretty face to be sold."

"Tie her up with the others," Damian ordered, finally straightening. "We move the shipment by boat at dawn."

Evelyn didn't resist as rough hands bound her wrists. She'd already decided - she wasn't just escaping. She was taking every one of those women with her.

They shoved her into a windowless room where frightened women huddled together. Most barely glanced up at her arrival, their spirits broken. But Evelyn's sharp eyes were already mapping the space.

The route she'd taken wound through hidden passages - cleverly concealed and soundproofed. No wonder no one outside heard the screams.

"Where are you all from?" Evelyn asked softly. Two women immediately burst into tears.

"Shhh," Evelyn soothed. "I'm getting you out of here."

Their hollow laughter cut deeper than any blade. "No one escapes," one whispered. "No one."
###Chapter 339 A Desperate Gamble

"We're being shipped out at dawn tomorrow. I may never see my family again."

"I can't die like this! Please, someone help us!"

The room fell into heavy silence, broken only by muffled sobs.

Evelyn Carter's hands clenched into fists, her nails biting into her palms. Even in this modern age, such barbaric practices still existed.

Her gaze swept across the dimly lit room.

Then she saw her - a girl who couldn't be older than eighteen, yet her eyes held the calm intensity of a seasoned warrior.

The girl stared back unflinchingly, her expression unreadable.

Neither spoke.

The silent standoff lasted thirty tense minutes.

Finally, the girl's voice cut through the darkness, laced with cautious hope. "Can you actually get us out?"

Evelyn didn't hesitate. "I will."

For a brief moment, hope flickered in the girl's eyes - then died when she noticed Evelyn's bound wrists.

Evelyn glanced down at the amateurish knots with contempt.

These amateurs couldn't tie their own shoelaces properly.

With practiced ease, she twisted her wrists and the ropes fell away.

Gasps filled the room.

"You...you're free!"

"How did you-"

Evelyn raised a finger to her lips. "Quiet!"

Understanding dawned on their faces. Even the weeping woman wiped her tears.

Without wasting words, Evelyn moved swiftly, freeing each captive with efficient movements.

The previously composed girl now looked at Evelyn with something akin to awe. "I'm Noelle Winslow. If we make it out, I'll find a way to repay you."

Evelyn gave a small smile and ruffled Noelle's hair. "We're getting out of here, Noelle. That's a promise."

Noelle nodded fiercely.

Evelyn gathered everyone close, whispering instructions like a seasoned general. No one questioned her authority.

Moments later, desperate screams erupted from the attic.

"Help! Someone's dying in here!"

"Please! We need a doctor!"

The coordinated cries soon drew their captors.

The door slammed open. "Shut your mouths unless you want to die tonight!"

One woman pointed frantically. "She's not breathing!"

As the guards rushed forward, Evelyn struck like a viper - her makeshift club connecting with a sickening crack.

One guard collapsed.

"Now! Run!"

The women didn't need telling twice. They surged toward freedom like a tidal wave.

But their hope was short-lived.

A wall of black-clad enforcers blocked their path.

"Foolish little mice," the leader sneered, cracking his whip. "Did you really think you could escape?"
###Chapter 340 A Thorned Lily

The women trembled at his words, their bodies instinctively recoiling. The memory of that whip's cruel bite was still fresh in their minds.

Damian Castillo stepped forward, his polished shoes clicking against the concrete floor.

His icy gaze swept over Evelyn Carter with clinical detachment. "Impressive. Ten minutes flat. You're faster than most."

Evelyn met his stare with equal frost, her voice cutting through the damp basement air. "Release us now, or I'll burn this entire operation to the ground."

Damian's laughter echoed off the walls as he slowly clapped. He couldn't deny her exotic beauty - those sharp cheekbones and piercing eyes would fetch a premium price. A rare flower indeed, but one with dangerous thorns.

"Dream on, sweetheart."

With a snap of his fingers, his enforcers moved in.

Then chaos erupted as a panicked underling burst through the door. "Boss! We're surrounded!"

Damian's face darkened. "Explain."

"It's the Kingsleys! Their private security has us locked down!"

The blood drained from Damian's face. "The Kingsley dynasty? We've never crossed paths. Why now?"

The subordinate shook violently. "They brought tactical teams, boss. Professional operators."

Damian's fist connected with the wall. "Goddamn it! There's only one reason they'd come after us."

His calculating gaze landed on Evelyn, realization dawning.

Her lips curled into a cold smile. "Oh, and the FBI's here too. Human trafficking carries a twenty-year minimum. Enjoy your new home."

Whispers of hope spread through the captive women.

Damian's knuckles turned white. "You think some suits with badges scare me? No one takes what's mine."

He barked orders. "Move them to the secondary location. Now!"

Another runner arrived, breathless. "Too late! The Kingsleys breached the perimeter. They're demanding their heiress."

Murmurs spread through Damian's crew. "Piss off the Kingsleys and we're finished in this city."

Damian paced like a caged animal. "Kingsley heiress? Point her out!"

He turned to the women. "Which one of you is Evelyn Kingsley? Speak up and walk free."

Silence.

Then Evelyn's voice cut through. "Everyone leaves. Now."

All eyes turned to her. Damian's expression shifted to sickening sweetness. "Ms. Kingsley, my deepest apologies for this... misunderstanding."
###Chapter 341 Rescuing the Captives

Evelyn's voice cut through the tension like ice. "Damian, release them."

Damian hesitated, his fingers twitching near his weapon. "As you wish, Ms. Carter." His bow was mocking.

Her glare intensified. "Are you deliberately misunderstanding me?"

Damian's smirk vanished. "Ms. Carter, I apologize for contradicting you." His voice turned wheedling. "But these women represent a significant investment. The financial loss would be-"

"Loss?" Evelyn's laugh held no humor. "You're still trying to negotiate when I'm giving you a chance to walk away alive."

A subordinate rushed in, panic in his eyes. "Boss! The Kingsley forces have the building surrounded. SWAT teams are moving in. We need to evacuate now!"

Damian's face paled. He turned back to Evelyn, defeat warring with fury in his expression. "Fine. Take them. But this isn't over, Ms. Carter."

With a sharp gesture, he signaled his men to abandon their posts. Within moments, only the frightened captives remained.

Dominic and Maxwell arrived within minutes, weapons drawn as they cleared each room. "Eve!" Dominic's voice cracked with barely restrained panic. "Are you hurt?"

She shook her head. "He got away, Dom."

Maxwell already had his comm unit out. "All units, suspect fleeing east in black SUV. License plate-"

"Dominic," Evelyn interrupted, "people like him create cracks in society's foundation. How many more will suffer if we don't stop this now?"

The police took statements while social workers helped the traumatized women contact their families. As Evelyn exited the precinct, a slight figure darted toward her.

"Ms. Carter," an officer explained, "Ms. Winslow refused to call anyone. Insisted on waiting for you."

Evelyn studied the trembling young woman. "Noelle, you're safe now. Why won't you go home?"

Noelle clutched Evelyn's sleeve like a lifeline. "Please...can I stay with you?" Her whisper was barely audible. "I...I ran away."

Evelyn's expression softened. "Whatever made you leave, facing it is safer than being out there alone."

Noelle's silence spoke volumes.

The precinct doors burst open as Adrian rushed in, his usually impeccable appearance disheveled. "Evelyn! When you left the VIP lounge, I thought you just needed air. Then the club got raided and-" His hands hovered over her shoulders, afraid to touch. "Are you alright?"

She offered a tired smile. "Still in one piece. See?"

Adrian's relieved exhale fogged his designer glasses. Behind them, Noelle's grip on Evelyn's arm tightened like she'd found her only anchor in a stormy sea.
###Chapter 342 Daughter of Elysium Banks Chairman

Seeing Evelyn safe, Adrian finally let out the breath he'd been holding. Just as he relaxed, his gaze landed on the girl standing beside her.

"Who's this?" he asked, curiosity flickering in his eyes.

Noelle glared at him sharply, her lips pressed into a thin line.

Adrian took a closer look at her then.

She was delicate, almost fragile. He reached out instinctively, ruffling her hair. "Don't worry. We'll find your family soon."

To his surprise, Noelle jerked away from his touch.

"Don't touch me!"

Adrian blinked, taken aback by her ferocity. "You're just a kid, aren't you?"

That seemed to ignite something in her. "I'm nineteen!"

Nineteen?

Adrian studied her again—petite frame, youthful features. But he didn't argue. "You shouldn't wander alone. The world's dangerous. Lucky for you, we found you first."

His voice dropped lower. "Traffickers would've sold you off or worse—harvested your organs."

Noelle's face paled, her hands clenched into fists.

Adrian frowned. "Hey, you okay? You look sick—"

Before he could finish, Noelle's knees buckled. He caught her just in time.

"Noelle? Wake up!"

No response. Panic rising, he rushed her to the hospital.

The examination revealed lash marks crisscrossing her back, the wounds raw and bleeding through her clothes.

Yet she hadn't made a single sound.

Adrian's hands shook with rage. "What kind of monsters would do this to a girl?"

Evelyn's voice was ice. "Traffickers deserve worse than prison. They deserve hell."

Her mind flashed to Damian Castillo, still at large. She'd make sure he paid.

Outside, a convoy of Bentleys pulled up.

A butler hurried to open the middle car's door.

"Mr. Winslow, she's inside."

Anthony Winslow stepped out, his expression unreadable. Bodyguards flanked him as he strode into the hospital.

When the director led him to the ward, Evelyn and Adrian exchanged glances.

The armed entourage told Evelyn everything—this man wasn't just wealthy. He was power personified.

Anthony spoke first. "Ms. Carter, I presume?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. "Do I know you?"

A business card appeared in the butler's hand, offered to her.

"Anthony Winslow."

The name sent a jolt through her. Then she read the card—and froze.
###Chapter 343 A Favor

"Are you Mr. Anthony Winslow, the chairman of Elysium Bank?"

Anthony's lips curved into a polite smile. "That would be me."

Adrian, standing nearby, suddenly connected the dots. His eyes widened slightly. "Mr. Winslow, are you and Noelle... related?"

Anthony's expression softened. "I'm Noelle's father."

The revelation hit Evelyn like a tidal wave. She hadn't expected the injured girl to be the daughter of Elysium Bank's powerful chairman.

"Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Winslow." Evelyn extended her hand, her posture radiating quiet confidence.

Anthony shook it firmly, admiration flickering in his gaze. "No need for formalities, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn continued smoothly, "Mr. Winslow, Noelle sustained external injuries with minor infections. The medical team has stabilized her condition, though she hasn't regained consciousness yet."

Anthony gave a measured nod. "I received a full briefing before arriving. You have my deepest gratitude for saving her, Ms. Carter."

"It was nothing, really." Evelyn waved a dismissive hand. "Now that you're here, Noelle is in excellent hands. We should be going."

"One moment." Anthony signaled to his butler, who produced a crisp check.

The butler bowed slightly. "Ms. Carter, this is a token of Mr. Winslow's appreciation."

Evelyn didn't even glance at the amount. "That's unnecessary, Mr. Winslow. Please, keep it."

Anthony's eyebrows lifted in realization. Of course—the Kingsley heiress wouldn't be swayed by money.

"My apologies," he said smoothly. "Old habits die hard."

"Perfectly understandable."

With another gesture, Anthony had the check withdrawn. "If not money, then consider this a personal favor owed. Should you ever require assistance, my resources are at your disposal."

A favor from Elysium Bank's chairman carried more weight than any check—especially for someone in Evelyn's position.

"I'll remember that," Evelyn replied with a knowing smile that pleased Anthony.

It had been years since he'd encountered someone so refreshingly direct.

"Now if you'll excuse us, Mr. Winslow."

Anthony turned to his butler. "See Ms. Carter out."

"Right this way, Ms. Carter."

Outside the hospital, Adrian's car idled at the curb. The drive back to Kingsley Manor passed in comfortable silence, the estate glowing like a beacon against the night sky.

Inside, Leonard Kingsley sat stiffly on the parlor sofa, his expression stormy despite Dominic's repeated assurances about Evelyn's safety.

"Call again," Leonard demanded. "Find out why she's not—"

The crunch of tires on gravel interrupted him. "Mr. Kingsley, Ms. Evelyn has returned."

Leonard was at the floor-to-ceiling window in an instant, watching as Adrian personally escorted his granddaughter up the walkway. The tension in his shoulders eased.

There had once been talks of uniting their families through marriage—before Evelyn's ill-fated wedding to Nathan.

Now, with the divorce finalized and no lingering bad blood between their houses... perhaps these two young people might yet—

"Finally coming to her senses," Leonard murmured.

As Evelyn stepped inside, the housekeeper informed her, "Ms. Evelyn, Mr. Kingsley is waiting in the parlor."

She shrugged off her coat with practiced ease. "Thank you."
###Chapter 344 A Miracle

Evelyn couldn't contain her excitement as she dashed toward Leonard. "Grandfather, I'm home."

Leonard studied Evelyn clutching his arm, his expression stern. "Tonight was extremely perilous, yet you chose to involve yourself?"

His voice carried undisguised concern. "Those traffickers are ruthless criminals who value money over lives. What if something terrible had happened to you?"

Evelyn squeezed his hand reassuringly. "I'm perfectly fine, Grandfather. I apologize for causing you distress."

Leonard huffed. "This must never happen again. I'm increasing your security detail immediately. We can't risk another incident like this."

Evelyn nodded vigorously. "Understood completely."

As they spoke, Leonard's gaze shifted to Dominic standing nearby. "Report. What's the status on those traffickers?"

Dominic responded crisply, "Police apprehended several accomplices, but the ringleader Damian Castillo escaped. No current leads."

Leonard's face darkened with anger. "Unacceptable negligence! Letting the mastermind slip away after such a major operation? This makes retaliation highly probable."

He paused meaningfully, exchanging a knowing look with Dominic who immediately added, "Rest assured, Grandfather. Our intelligence network is actively tracking him. The moment we locate him, we'll deliver him to authorities."

Leonard's expression softened slightly. He patted Evelyn's hand. "You must exercise extreme caution during this period, my dear. Don't give anyone opportunity to harm you."

Evelyn nodded solemnly. "I will, Grandfather."

Changing subjects abruptly, Leonard inquired, "Was that young Prescott heir who brought you home?"

Evelyn anticipated his next words and preempted him. "Grandfather, Adrian and I are simply friends. Just friends."

Leonard's skeptical look spoke volumes.

With decades of life experience, he knew platonic friendships between men and women rarely existed.

Yet he refrained from pressing the matter. Matters of the heart couldn't be forced, and external interference often backfired.

"Very well, handle your own affairs then."

Evelyn adopted an earnest expression. "I will, Grandfather. Please don't worry about me. It's late - let me help you upstairs."

"You're always so considerate. If only you could remain by my side permanently."

Evelyn's lips curved into a bright smile. "Once I fulfill my one-year commitment, I'll return to Frenda and stay with you daily."

"See that you keep your word."

Evelyn chuckled. "When have I ever broken a promise?"

Watching their heartwarming interaction, Dominic smiled faintly until his phone buzzed with an alert.

Glancing at the screen, he informed the butler, "I have urgent business. No need to keep lights on for me tonight."

"Yes, Mr. Kingsley."

Upstairs, Evelyn had just settled Leonard in his bedroom when engine sounds echoed from outside.

Leonard grumbled irritably, "That rascal Dominic is always occupied with romantic pursuits these days, never staying home. Hiding everything from me. Why won't he bring my future granddaughter-in-law for inspection?"

Evelyn's eyes widened dramatically. "Grandfather! Dominic's in love? Since when? Is this actually happening?"
###Chapter 345 An Invitation From the Winslow Family

"This miracle must come to fruition. Holding my great-grandchild soon would make my life complete."

Evelyn chuckled. "Grandpa Leonard, does that mean I'll be replaced in your affections?"

"You'll always be our precious jewel. Nothing could ever change that."

Leaning against Leonard's arm, Evelyn cooed, "I knew you loved me best, Grandpa."

...

The next morning found Evelyn conducting her usual virtual meeting for Kingsley Industries, which lasted until nearly noon.

She stretched lazily before exiting the study.

As fate would have it, she crossed paths with Dominic returning home. His suit jacket bore telltale wrinkles from being worn all night.

Recalling Leonard's words from the previous evening, Evelyn's curiosity flared anew.

"Dominic, where were you all night?"

Her brother froze momentarily.

But he recovered swiftly, deflecting with practiced ease. "Why? Did you just wake up?"

"Hardly." Evelyn denied quickly. "I just finished my meeting. Where did you—"

Before she could complete her question, Dominic interrupted. "What a coincidence. I've got a meeting at corporate headquarters too."

With that, he disappeared into his bedroom, shutting the door firmly behind him.

Evelyn blinked in astonishment. Dominic had changed!

Never before had he behaved this way. Love truly worked wonders on a person.

Shaking her head slightly, Evelyn descended the stairs where the housekeeper, Marjorie, presented her with a gilded invitation. "Ms. Carter, this arrived this morning."

The embossed "Winslow" on the cover told Evelyn everything she needed to know.

As expected, it was an invitation to a family banquet at Winslow Manor in three days' time.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow before tucking the invitation away. Proper guest etiquette demanded thoughtful gifts.

"Marjorie, please have the driver ready. I need to go out."

"Right away, Ms. Carter."

After changing upstairs, Evelyn grabbed her purse just as Dominic emerged, clearly heading out.

"Going shopping?" he asked first.

Evelyn nodded. "Just some essentials at the mall."

Dominic opened his wallet, extracting a black card. "Get whatever you want. It's on me."

"Dominic, need I remind you? I have my own black card. Save this for my future sister-in-law."

Her brother didn't argue, simply advising, "Be careful out there."

"Always am."

Dominic pocketed his card and departed first.

...

Upon arriving at the luxury mall, the manager personally greeted Evelyn.

"Ms. Carter, we've cleared all floors except the ground level. Please select anything you desire."

With a gracious nod, Evelyn took the elevator upstairs.

The manager continued his introduction. "To your left are handbags and apparel, to your right footwear. The third floor houses our jewelry collection..."

After browsing, Evelyn ultimately selected several exquisite accessories from the jewelry boutique.

Meanwhile, Sylvia and her clique shopped on the bustling ground floor. Former classmates of Evelyn's, they now knew her true identity and couldn't help whispering.

"Who would've guessed Evelyn was actually the Carter heiress? I used to call her a country mouse."

"Don't even start! I said she lacked sophistication. The thought makes me cringe now."
###Chapter 346 Envy Towards Evelyn

"She concealed it flawlessly! Not once did she reveal even a hint of the truth in our presence. Had I known she was the Kingsley family's heiress, I would've never dared speak ill of her."

"We even mistook her for a mistress. How absurd - the Kingsley heiress being someone's kept woman? What a ridiculous notion."

"That's the Kingsleys for you. When they sneeze, all of Frenda catches cold. We're simply not in the same league."

Sylvia Montgomery's fingers tightened around her purse straps as she listened to her so-called friends. Her father had frozen all her accounts after her confrontation with Evelyn and the Kingsleys. Now even scraping together a few hundred dors felt impossible.

"Enough," she snapped, her voice sharp. "Stop talking about her."

The group exchanged uneasy glances before falling silent.

"Sylvia, weren't you going to show us that limited edition Birkin?"

"Yeah, and Chanel's new perfume collection just arrived. I'm dying to try it."

Biting her lip, Sylvia couldn't admit her financial ruin. "Let's... take a look then," she forced out.

Their shopping expedition ended abruptly at the elevator. "Apologies, ladies," a security guard blocked their path. "The mall is closed for a private event today. Second floor access is restricted."

Instant outrage erupted among the group.

"Since when? We came specifically to shop!"

"This is outrageous!"

Sylvia secretly exhaled in relief. "No matter," she said smoothly. "Since we can't shop, I'll treat everyone to high tea instead."

Grumbling, they agreed. "Fine. That new café on Fifth has an exclusive tea blend. Supposed to be divine."

As they turned to leave, the elevator doors slid open.

Iris Montgomery gasped. "Isn't that Evelyn?"

All heads swiveled. There stood Evelyn Carter, descending like royalty with the mall manager practically bowing at her side.

"No wonder they shut the place down. Evelyn Kingsley gets the VIP treatment."

"Ugh, so jealous. None of us rate that kind of service."

Like moths to flame, they abandoned Sylvia, flocking toward Evelyn with saccharine smiles.

"Evelyn! What a delightful coincidence!"

"Fancy seeing you here! Must be fate."

"Evelyn, we were so wrong before. Please forgive us? We're classmates after all. Maybe you could put in a good word for us with your family?"

Sylvia's nails dug crescent moons into her palms as she watched the shameless display. Her chest burned with humiliation at their blatant opportunism.

These vultures!

Evelyn paused, taking in the sudden sycophancy. Money and power really did make hypocrites of everyone.

"Enjoy your day," she said coolly, already walking away.

They waved eagerly, lingering even after she'd disappeared from view.

"So gracious, the Kingsley heiress."

"Right? After how we treated her... I feel awful now."

Sylvia's restraint shattered. "If Evelyn's so perfect, why don't you lick her shoes while you're at it?" she spat, storming off before they could see the tears of rage pricking her eyes.
###Chapter 347 The Enigmatic Stranger

"Even if you grovel at her feet now, she wouldn't spare you a second glance."

Sylvia's words hung in the air as she stormed off, leaving her former clique exchanging uneasy glances.

Iris hesitated, one foot already stepping forward to follow. "Sylvia, wait—"

A manicured hand clamped down on her wrist. "Why bother? Haven't you heard? The Montgomerys are cutting ties with her family."

Iris blinked. "What do you mean?"

Laughter tittered through the group. "Her father's company is being acquired by the Kingsleys. Rumor has it Evelyn Carter personally ordered all her credit cards frozen."

The revelation made Iris pause mid-step.

"Imagine crossing Evelyn," someone whispered. "That girl's practically royalty now."

—

Sylvia didn't need to turn around to know no one had followed.

The parking garage echoed with her stiletto clicks as she reached her convertible—alone. Her knuckles whitened around the keys.

Then she saw her.

Evelyn stood bathed in golden light beside a Rolls-Royce Cullinan, phone pressed to her ear. The diamond bracelet on her wrist caught the light with every gesture.

Rage boiled in Sylvia's veins.

"This is all your fault," she hissed, slamming into the driver's seat. The engine roared to life.

Tires screeched.

"Look out!"

A deep voice cut through the garage. Evelyn's phone clattered to concrete as strong arms yanked her sideways.

Sandalwood.

The scent enveloped her before she registered the masked face—only piercing amber eyes visible beneath a black baseball cap.

"Who—?"

CRASH.

Sylvia's convertible plowed into a concrete pillar. The airbag deployed with a sickening whump.

Through the cracked windshield, she saw Evelyn—untouched—pressed against a broad chest.

Cursing, Sylvia reversed and peeled out of the garage.

Evelyn's pulse hammered against her ribs. "Thank you," she breathed, but the stranger was already walking away.

"Wait! Your name—"

He didn't turn. Within seconds, shadows swallowed his silhouette.

Bodyguards swarmed her. "Ms. Kingsley! Are you hurt?"

Evelyn shook her head, staring at the spot where he'd vanished. That scent... familiar yet foreign.

"Pull the security footage," she ordered, retrieving her shattered phone. "I want that driver identified."

As her guards scrambled, Evelyn touched her wrist where his fingers had been. Warmth still lingered.

Who was he?

Why did he disappear like smoke?

The limousine door closed with a muted thud. Through tinted windows, Evelyn watched raindrops streak the glass—each one carrying more questions than answers.
###Chapter 348 You're Not Worthy

The crimson sports car had been swiftly immobilized by the security team.

As the tinted window rolled down, a broad-shouldered guard approached. "Ms. Carter, we've apprehended the suspect. Your instructions?"

Evelyn stepped out onto the asphalt, her designer heels clicking sharply. Her emerald eyes immediately locked onto Sylvia's trembling form in the driver's seat.

"E-Evelyn." Sylvia's voice cracked as she avoided eye contact.

A stinging slap echoed through the parking garage. Evelyn's palm left an angry red mark on Sylvia's cheek. "Pathetic. This is your grand plan?"

Sylvia recoiled but remained silent. Her impulsive attempt to ram Evelyn's car had failed spectacularly. The Kingsley security detail had intercepted her within minutes.

"I only regret not hitting the accelerator harder."

Evelyn's laugh was ice cold. "You couldn't touch me if you tried. Attempted vehicular manslaughter? Enjoy prison, Sylvia."

She turned sharply, tossing over her shoulder, "Three days until Montgomery Electronics collapses. Five until Kingsley Industries owns it."

"Wait!" Sylvia clawed at the car door. "Punish me, not my father's company!"

Evelyn didn't glance back as she slid into her waiting limousine.

The downfall came swiftly. First, explosive reports of defective Montgomery smartphones causing burns. Then the stock market crash when their main investor pulled out. By day three, bankruptcy filings were public record.

At Kingsley Manor, sunlight dappled through the oak trees as Evelyn lounged on the veranda. The financial reports in her lap fluttered in the breeze.

Maxwell approached with military precision. "Ms. Carter, Montgomery Electronics has completed liquidation."

Evelyn didn't look up from her documents. "The acquisition package?"

"Prepared and ready."

"Excellent. Kingsley needs an electronics division." She snapped the folder shut. "Make it happen."

As Maxwell departed, Evelyn checked her diamond-encrusted watch. The Winslow gala began in two hours - just enough time to transform.

"Marjorie," she handed off her reading materials, "return these to the library."

"Of course, Ms. Carter."

—

At precisely 7:15 PM, the Winslow estate glittered like a jewel box.

Noelle came sprinting down the marble staircase as Evelyn's car arrived. "You're here!" The younger girl's face lit up like Christmas morning.

Evelyn presented an elegantly wrapped box. "For your recovery, darling."

Noelle hugged the gift like a teddy bear. "You're the best! Come meet Daddy's new chef!"

They linked arms like sisters - one dark, one fair - when an unwelcome voice interrupted.

"Princess!"

Noelle's smile vanished. "Adrian Prescott. Why must you ruin everything?"

He flourished a gold-embossed invitation. "By special request of Mr. Winslow himself."

"Ugh. Pest."

Adrian smirked. "Says the girl who still sleeps with stuffed animals."

Noelle's cheeks flamed. "I'm nineteen, you cretin! A full adult!"
###Chapter 349 Playful Banter

Adrian Prescott gave Noelle Winslow a once-over before smirking. "You? Seriously? Could've fooled me."

Noelle huffed and stomped her designer heel in frustration, but Adrian merely shrugged and blew a raspberry at her.

That did it. "You fossilized thirty-something!" she snapped.

Adrian's eyebrows shot up. "Excuse me? Thirty-something? Take that back right now."

Victorious, Noelle stuck out her tongue and grabbed Evelyn Carter's arm, dragging her inside the venue.

Grumbling, Adrian hurried after them. "Sweetheart, open those pretty eyes wide. Do I look a day over twenty-nine to you?"

Their bickering continued like an endless tennis match, neither willing to concede defeat.

Watching them, Evelyn bit back a laugh. There was something oddly endearing about their dynamic - like two kittens batting at each other.

Her musings were interrupted by Beatrice Whitmore's melodic voice. "Evelyn darling!"

Evelyn spun around, surprised. "Aunt Beatrice? What are you doing here?"

Arthur Whitmore, appearing beside his wife, explained smoothly. "Beatrice and Anthony have been close friends for decades."

"Exactly," Beatrice nodded. "Anthony told us how you helped bring Noelle home safely. Who knows what trouble this wild child might've gotten into without you?"

Arthur added warmly, "Our daughter's stubborn as a mule, but she clearly trusts you. We'd be grateful if you'd keep an eye on her."

"Of course, Mr. Winslow," Evelyn promised.

After exchanging pleasantries, Beatrice discreetly pulled Evelyn aside. "Now darling, how are things with Harrison? Why aren't you two together tonight?"

Evelyn's cheeks warmed. "I had to return to Frenda unexpectedly. Didn't get a chance to tell him."

Beatrice's perfectly manicured fingers tapped impatiently against her champagne flute. These two had been circling each other for months without any progress!

While she already considered Evelyn family, romance required mutual feelings. What if someone snatched this perfect daughter-in-law away?

Absolutely unacceptable. Time for intervention.

"Evelyn dear," Beatrice changed tactics smoothly, "I need a rather big favor."

"What is it, Aunt Beatrice?"

"Well..." Beatrice feigned hesitation. "Arthur and I are planning an extended trip abroad, but Harrison's birthday is coming up."

"We simply can't be there to celebrate. Would you be an angel and keep him company?"

"Harrison's birthday?" Evelyn mentally calculated the dates - June 18th. Today was the 15th.

Beatrice clasped her hands pleadingly. "Please say yes, darling."

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn nodded. "Alright, Aunt Beatrice."

Beatrice's smile could've powered a small city. This birthday would be her masterpiece - the perfect setup for romance.

Meanwhile, Evelyn's mind raced with gift ideas. What do you get the billionaire who has everything?

The moment the gala ended, Evelyn rushed home. Her staff packed efficiently, and by midnight, she was aboard a private jet back to Pamore.

At 2:17 AM, her friends' group chat exploded with messages.

Evelyn Carter: "Emergency brainstorming session! Need birthday gift ideas STAT! Something unforgettable for a man who owns half the city."
###Chapter 350 A Special Gift

Evelyn tapped her fingers against her phone screen thoughtfully. "Maybe something unexpected and meaningful."

She typed another message. "I want it to be unique. Any suggestions?"

After sending several texts, Evelyn noticed the time - 2:17 AM. The glowing screen illuminated her disappointed face when no replies came.

With a sigh, she turned off her phone.

The morning sunlight woke Evelyn to her phone buzzing nonstop.

Natalie: "Who could possibly make our Ms. Carter ask for gift advice?"

Natalie: "Don't tell me it's that Sterling guy again?"

Sophia, who rarely responded in group chats, immediately sent three shocked face emojis. "Evelyn! Did you reconcile with Nathan?"

Olivia: "No way! His birthday isn't until next month. It must be for Harrison."

Sophia: "Oooh, is there something new between you two?"

Evelyn quickly interrupted their speculation. "Focus, ladies. I need actual ideas."

Olivia responded first. "Honestly, Harrison would love anything from you. But a handmade gift would be extra special."

Natalie agreed. "Perfect idea. But Evelyn, what can you make? A cake perhaps?"

Evelyn's eyes lit up. Baking a cake? That could work.

Within hours, her kitchen transformed into a bakery. Flour dusted the countertops, eggs waited in neat rows, and vanilla extract perfumed the air.

She propped her phone against a mixing bowl, following a tutorial with intense concentration. After a full day of trial and error, Evelyn finally perfected her creation.

The finished cake stood proudly on her counter - moist chocolate layers with smooth buttercream frosting. "Success," she whispered, carefully boxing her masterpiece.

At Horizon Technologies, Monday mornings meant chaos. The receptionist recognized Evelyn immediately. "Good morning, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn smiled and headed straight for the executive elevator.

Something felt off when the doors opened to the top floor.

The normally bustling secretary area stood empty. Evelyn's steps slowed as suspicion prickled her neck.

She knocked on the CEO's office door. Silence.

"Harrison?" She pushed the door open.

Only an empty chair greeted her. Setting the cake box on the desk, she noticed the adjacent lounge door slightly ajar.

Her fingers trembled as she approached.

The sight that greeted her made her blood run cold.

Diana lay sprawled across the lounge's sofa, her skirt riding up to reveal too much thigh.

At Evelyn's gasp, Diana scrambled to sit up, smoothing her wrinkled blouse. "M-Ms. Carter! What are you doing here?"

Evelyn's voice turned icy. "I could ask you the same."

Diana bit her lip, avoiding eye contact.

Under Evelyn's piercing stare, Diana finally stammered, "If you're looking for Mr. Whitmore...he's in a meeting."
###Chapter 351 Clearing up the Facts

Evelyn's face remained impassive, but the fire in her eyes betrayed her fury. Without a word, she spun on her heel and strode away.

Diana watched her retreat with a self-satisfied smirk. She took her time dressing before sauntering out of the CEO's office.

The receptionist approached with a sycophantic smile. "Ms. Chamberlain, was my assistance satisfactory today?"

Diana arched a perfectly sculpted brow. "The intel was precise and the execution flawless. You've outdone yourself."

"Thank you, Ms. Chamberlain."

Without hesitation, Diana retrieved a limited-edition Chanel makeup set from her office and presented it to the receptionist.

"For you."

The receptionist's eyes gleamed with greed, though she feigned reluctance. "Ms. Chamberlain, I couldn't possibly—"

"Nonsense. A trifle between friends. Refusing would be an insult."

"Oh no, I wouldn't dream—"

The receptionist snatched the gift eagerly, then leaned in conspiratorially. "Ms. Carter left in quite a state. She's definitely off the premises by now."

Diana's lips curled in triumph.

She knew Evelyn's weakness—that deep-seated trauma from her first marriage. Infidelity was the one betrayal Evelyn could never forgive.

This morning's little performance would haunt Evelyn for weeks.

The thought made Diana's smile turn predatory.

The receptionist shivered under that gaze. "If there's nothing else, Ms. Chamberlain..."

Diana nodded but delivered her warning. "About today's events—"

"My lips are sealed. No one will hear a word from me."

Satisfied, Diana dismissed her.

—

Evelyn remained oblivious to Diana's machinations. Emerging from Horizon Technologies' gleaming tower, she paused on the sidewalk instead of leaving.

Her lips pressed into a thin line as she processed what she'd witnessed.

Yes, the scene had shaken her. But upon reflection—Diana had been alone in that bedroom.

Evelyn needed answers.

She wouldn't leave with this uncertainty poisoning her mind. Pulling out her phone, she dialed Harrison.

—

In Horizon Technologies' executive boardroom, Harrison presided over the quarterly strategy meeting.

The ringing phone shattered the presentation's flow.

Executives exchanged startled glances but remained silent.

Harrison glanced at the caller ID. Without hesitation, he raised a hand to halt the meeting.

"Evelyn?"

His voice softened noticeably the moment he answered. The executives' eyebrows shot up—this gentle tone was utterly foreign coming from their notoriously stern CEO.

Frowning at the prolonged silence, Harrison checked the still-active call. "Evelyn, what's wrong?"

The tenderness in his voice sent another ripple of shock through the room. Without explanation, Harrison stood and strode out, oblivious to the whispers erupting behind him.

Most were speculating wildly about this mysterious "Evelyn."

"Where are you? I'll come to you immediately." Harrison jabbed the elevator button as he spoke.

Evelyn stared up at Horizon Technologies' imposing headquarters, the company name gleaming in polished steel.

She took a steadying breath. "I'm at your building's entrance."

"Stay right there. I'm coming down."
###Chapter 352 Why Was There a Woman in Your Bed

Evelyn let out a quiet hum, an unexpected calm washing over her in that instant.

Within moments, she spotted Harrison approaching with long, purposeful strides.

As he drew nearer, she could see the faint sheen of perspiration on his brow. "Harrison, did I interrupt something important?"

When he noticed the space she'd put between them, he reached for her hand and guided her toward the corporate building.

"Evie, since when do you stand on ceremony with me? You can come find me anytime. It's never an inconvenience."

A smile tugged at Evelyn's lips. The warmth of his palm felt authentic, reassuring in its sincerity.

They crossed the bustling first-floor lobby together, drawing curious glances from employees. Though aware of the attention, Evelyn felt no embarrassment—only an odd sense of security.

Inside the elevator, she explained, "Beatrice mentioned it's your birthday today, so I thought I'd—"

Harrison turned sharply. "Why didn't you tell me you were coming?"

Tell him in advance? So she wouldn't have witnessed whatever was happening in his office?

Evelyn's mood instantly darkened. Harrison immediately picked up on the shift. "What's wrong?"

She shook her head. "Nothing."

Turning away, she couldn't stop herself from asking, "Harrison, what exactly is your relationship with your former assistant?"

"Former assistant?" His brow furrowed. "You mean Diana?"

Evelyn gave a tight nod.

"Professionally, I'm her employer, she's my employee," Harrison stated matter-of-factly.

Evelyn murmured an acknowledgment, her expression clearly skeptical.

Harrison grew more intrigued. "Why the sudden interest?"

As the elevator doors parted, Evelyn took in the busy office scene without comment, stepping out first.

Confused, Harrison quickly followed.

"Ms. Carter, Mr. Whitmore."

Under the watchful eyes of staff, they entered the CEO's office in succession, the door clicking shut behind them.

"Evie, what's going on?"

His question hung in the air as his gaze landed on the cake atop his desk. Remembering her words in the elevator, a spark of delight lit his eyes. He moved toward it instinctively.

Evelyn blocked his path. "Wait."

She stood before him, lower lip jutting in a pout that made her look endearingly petulant.

Harrison's lips curved as he studied her. "Evie, did you bring this?"

She neither confirmed nor denied.

But the answer was written across her face. A realization struck him. "You came by earlier, didn't you?"

Evelyn huffed. "Yes. And I saw something I shouldn't have."

Catching the implication, Harrison's eyes narrowed.

He closed the distance until mere inches separated them, their breaths mingling. "What exactly did you see?"

"I—"

The words stuck in her throat. Finally, she pointed to the adjacent lounge. "Why was there a woman in your private quarters?"

"A woman?" Harrison's voice dropped. "You saw a woman in my bed?"

Evelyn's jaw set stubbornly. Understanding dawned on Harrison's face. "Was it Diana?"
###Chapter 353 Teaching Diana a Lesson

Evelyn's expression told Harrison everything he needed to know without words.

With decisive movements, Harrison pressed the intercom button. "Send Ms. Chamberlain from sales to my office immediately."

"Right away, Mr. Whitmore."

"And have security standing by."

"Understood, sir."

Evelyn remained silent on the sofa, her fingers tightening around her purse strap.

Within minutes, Diana burst through the door, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor. "You requested to see me, Mr. Whitmore?"

Her cheerful greeting died when she spotted Evelyn. A flicker of panic crossed her features before she schooled them into perfect neutrality.

Harrison didn't miss the microexpression.

His mother Beatrice had warned him about Diana's deceptive nature beneath that angelic facade.

That's precisely why she'd been transferred from the executive suite to sales management.

Harrison had dismissed it as maternal bias before. Now he saw the truth.

"Ms. Chamberlain, care to explain yourself?"

Diana blinked innocently. "I'm afraid I don't follow, sir."

Harrison's eyes darkened to stormy gray. Everyone who knew him recognized that dangerous shift.

Diana had worked alongside him for years. She knew exactly what that look meant. Yet she maintained her act, her face a mask of perfect confusion.

To an outsider, she might have appeared genuinely clueless.

"Collect your severance from HR. You're terminated effective immediately."

Diana's composure cracked. "On what grounds? This is outrageous!"

Harrison didn't entertain her protests. "Security will escort you out."

"Did she poison you against me?" Diana shrieked, pointing at Evelyn. "You're taking her word over mine?"

Evelyn felt tension leave her shoulders. There truly was nothing between Diana and Harrison. She'd misjudged him completely.

Harrison's voice turned arctic. "Mind your professionalism, Ms. Chamberlain. Horizon Technologies has no place for rule-breakers."

His brutal dismissal shattered Diana's composure. Tears spilled down her cheeks. The sudden reversal left her reeling.

A security team knocked and entered. "Sir?"

Harrison gestured to the private lounge. "Remove everything in there. Dispose of it."

Diana gaped at Harrison's merciless order. Humiliation burned through her. She lowered her gaze, knowing she'd lost.

The truth was, Harrison had never given her a chance to begin with. For years, he'd remained devoted to one woman alone.

No matter who tried to enter his orbit, he'd rebuffed them without hesitation.

Diana turned on her heel and fled. She resigned that same hour, vanishing from Horizon Technologies forever.

As security cleared the lounge, Evelyn's posture relaxed visibly.

Harrison crossed to her, bending until their faces were level. "Did you bake this cake for me, Evelyn?" His voice softened, a stark contrast to his earlier tone.
###Chapter 354 Happy Birthday

Evelyn lifted her gaze and met Harrison's piercing blue eyes. In their depths, she could see her own reflection shimmering like moonlight on water.

"Happy birthday, Harrison."

His lips curved into that devastating smile she knew so well as he reached out to tuck a loose strand of hair behind her ear. "Thank you, darling."

Evelyn sprang up from the couch, the earlier melancholy vanishing as she practically skipped to the dessert table. With ceremonial flourish, she presented the homemade cake like it was the crown jewels.

"I baked this myself. You'd better eat every last crumb."

Harrison's chuckle sent pleasant shivers down her spine. "Wouldn't dream of doing otherwise."

She carefully placed candles on the frosted surface, the lighter's flame casting dancing shadows across their faces as she began singing in her soft contralto. "Happy birthday to you..."

The scent of vanilla and burning wax filled the air between them.

"Make a wish, Harrison."

His intense gaze never left hers as he closed his eyes briefly. When they fluttered open, Evelyn found herself holding her breath without realizing it.

Together, they leaned forward and extinguished the tiny flames in one synchronized breath.

Evelyn handed him the silver cake knife, her fingers brushing against his. "The birthday boy gets first cut."

Harrison had celebrated countless lavish parties before, surrounded by society's elite. But this simple moment with Evelyn - just the two of them in his penthouse - outshone them all.

"Let's indulge then," he murmured.

As they finished their slices, Harrison's private line buzzed. "Happy birthday, my darling boy!" Beatrice Whitmore's melodic voice carried through the speaker.

"Thank you, Mother."

"I know you have Evelyn with you this year, so your father and I won't intrude." Beatrice's conspiratorial tone made Evelyn blush. "Though I did reserve you a table at La Perle Noire tonight. The reservation details are coming through now. Don't keep the poor girl waiting!"

Before Harrison could respond, the line went dead. His phone chimed with the restaurant details seconds later.

Shaking his head at his mother's antics, Harrison extended his hand to Evelyn. "It appears we have dinner plans. Shall we?"

"Lead the way," she answered with a smile.

Beatrice had chosen Pamore's most exclusive couples' restaurant - an intimate establishment known for its romantic ambiance and impeccable service. Crystal chandeliers cast a soft glow over linen-draped tables as they entered, drawing admiring glances from other patrons.

They settled at a window table overlooking the city lights, the view almost as breathtaking as the way Harrison looked at her across the candlelit table.

Outside, a sleek black sedan pulled into the valet parking. Nathan Sterling frowned at the restaurant's ornate facade, his phone vibrating insistently.

"Nathan, are you at the restaurant?" Eleanor Blackwell's voice held that particular note of maternal expectation he knew too well.

"I'm here. Where are you?"

"Go straight to table 26! I've arranged a lovely girl for you - the Winslow heiress. Don't you dare—"

Nathan ended the call mid-sentence, his jaw tightening. As he turned the ignition, a flash of chestnut hair through the restaurant's floor-to-ceiling windows caught his attention.

It had been weeks since that fateful encounter with Evelyn Carter, yet the sight of her now made his pulse stutter. She was even more radiant than he remembered, laughing at something her companion said.

Against his will, Nathan found himself staring, that familiar ache returning to his chest with startling intensity.
###Chapter 355 She Did Love You

Nathan sat frozen in his car, his fingers gripping the steering wheel as he watched Evelyn through the tinted windows. His breath caught when she laughed at something Harrison said.

He couldn't bring himself to step out.

The dinner lasted two excruciating hours. Nathan watched every smile, every casual touch between them. When they finally left arm in arm, his vision blurred.

His phone buzzed violently. Eleanor's shrill voice pierced through: "Nathan! Where are you? Ms. Delaney has been waiting—"

He crushed the phone against the dashboard and hurled it into the night. The engine roared to life as he sped away.

——

Gregory was halfway through a whiskey when the VIP door slammed open.

"Who the hell—" He choked on his drink seeing Nathan's stormy expression. "Jesus, man. You look like death."

Nathan hadn't stepped foot in their usual haunt since the divorce. The man who collapsed onto the leather couch wasn't the Sterling heir everyone feared—just a hollow shell.

Gregory signaled for everyone to clear out.

"Let me guess," he poured Nathan three fingers of bourbon, "Evelyn Carter strikes again?"

The glass shattered against the wall. "Is it written on my forehead?"

Gregory sighed. "You're obsessed. But she's moved on. Why torture yourself?"

The image of Evelyn tucking her hair behind her ear for Harrison flashed behind Nathan's eyelids. That smile—he used to see it directed at him.

"Is there..." Nathan's voice cracked. "Any chance left for us?"

"None." Gregory regretted his bluntness when Nathan flinched. "But! Women are unpredictable. Remember how she chased you?"

Nathan remembered. He'd been convinced her marriage proposal was a power play.

Three years. Three years of icy distance, of pretending she didn't exist in their own home. Not once had he touched her.

"Listen," Gregory leaned in, "Evelyn loved you. You were just too blind to see it."

The words hit like a sledgehammer.

"Loved? Past tense?"

Gregory shrugged. "Why else would a woman like her marry you? For your sparkling personality?"

Nathan's world tilted.

Evelyn... loved him?

The possibility had never crossed his mind.

"Women don't operate like us," Gregory continued. "It's all or nothing with them. If there was love once..." He let the implication hang.

Nathan's hands trembled. Somewhere in the wreckage of their marriage, had he missed his one chance at real happiness?
###Chapter 356 Relieved

Nathan's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Appreciate it, man."

Without another word, he rose and strode out, leaving Gregory blinking in confusion.

Dawn had barely broken when Evelyn arrived at Kingsley Industries headquarters. The biannual board meeting loomed ahead, and the top-floor conference room already buzzed with all directors and C-suite executives.

Maxwell intercepted her at the entrance, pressing a folder into her hands. "Ms. Carter, the six-month financials and corresponding accounting reports."

His voice vibrated with barely contained excitement. "First-half profits already exceed last year's annual total by ten percent."

Not just matching - surpassing their yearly target in half the time. Any CEO would consider this monumental, yet Evelyn had achieved it before summer's end.

"Present these figures to the board," Maxwell continued, "and even Julian Hawthorne will have to acknowledge your leadership. That wager of yours is as good as won."

Evelyn's expression remained unreadable as she scanned the documents. The calculations included both the Whitmore contract and several ongoing ventures.

"Strip out the Whitmore project. What's the adjusted margin?"

Maxwell's enthusiasm dimmed. "Without it... we're still thirty percent shy of last year's performance."

A curt nod. "Understood. Let's proceed."

Inside the conference room, Julian occupied the seat second only to the chairman's. He'd reviewed the preliminary reports earlier.

Evelyn's strategic brilliance showed in the thriving numbers, yet they still fell short of their bet's terms.

"Director Hawthorne," murmured a silver-haired board member, "seems your little challenge has reached its inevitable conclusion."

"Ms. Carter's youth shows. Competent management, yes, but the core profitability remains... inadequate."

"Without the Whitmore windfall, second-half projections look grim. Where will she find another golden goose like that?"

Julian's smug satisfaction barely concealed itself as he demurred, "Now, now. Ms. Carter seemed quite confident during our wager. I'm merely humoring her."

"Her efforts to boost performance are... admirable. Premature to draw conclusions."

Chuckles rippled through the group. "Your humility does you credit, Julian."

"Kingsley Industries needs steady hands like yours at the helm."

"When you assume leadership, don't forget us old warhorses, eh?"

Julian's chuckle oozed false modesty. "Naturally. Loyalty never goes unrewarded in my organization."

Evelyn's hand froze Maxwell as they reached the door, having caught every word.

"Ms. Carter, their insolence—"

A razor-thin smile. "Words are wind, Maxwell. Let them chatter. Our purpose remains unchanged - to remind every soul in this building that Kingsley blood built this empire, not Hawthorne ambition."
###Chapter 375 The Boardroom Showdown

The heavy oak doors swung open as Evelyn Carter strode into the conference room. The moment her designer heels clicked against the marble floor, all conversation ceased.

Every head turned toward her, tracking her movement until she took her place at the head of the long mahogany table.

Julian Hawthorne leaned toward her with a practiced smile. "Ms. Carter, your dedication these past months has been... remarkable."

Evelyn met his gaze with equal politeness. "Flattery won't change our quarterly reports, Director Hawthorne. We're all here for Kingsley Industries' success."

An awkward chuckle escaped Julian before he straightened his tie. "Shall we begin then?"

His words triggered a ripple of nods around the table, as if he held the gavel instead of Evelyn.

Though she noted the power play, her expression remained unreadable.

After a calculated pause, she continued, "Our first half performance shows promising growth across all divisions. Let's hear from each department head—"

A silver-haired director cut her off mid-sentence.

"Ms. Carter, these financials tell quite a story. Shouldn't we address the elephant in the room first?"

Another executive chimed in from the second row. "The numbers speak for themselves. Your leadership has certainly... made an impression."

Evelyn crossed her arms, one perfectly manicured brow arching.

"If the financials are what interests you gentlemen, by all means."

The first director smirked. "Your little wager with Director Hawthorne makes these figures particularly... entertaining. Do recall your exact words from last quarter?"

The room buzzed with barely concealed anticipation. Most were clearly waiting for blood in the water.

Julian's smug expression said everything. He rose with theatrical grace. "Now gentlemen, let's not rush to conclusions. The year isn't over yet, is it?"

Snickers erupted around the table, the scent of impending victory thick in the air.

"Well, Ms. Carter? Your thoughts?"

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her piercing green eyes. "Director Hawthorne is correct. The game isn't over." She tilted her head. "Unless you're that eager to redecorate the CEO office already, Julian?"

Julian's facade slipped for a fraction of a second before he recovered. "You misunderstand me completely. Just some friendly boardroom banter."

Maxwell Donovan snorted loudly. "Your ambition is about as subtle as a bull in a china shop, Hawthorne."

Julian spread his hands with mock innocence. "A simple business wager between colleagues, nothing more. We all witnessed the terms."

He turned to address the room. "In any competition, there must be a winner and a loser. Wouldn't you all agree?"

Murmurs of assent circled the table. Maxwell wasn't having it. "So you're declaring victory already? Interesting timing, considering we still have two quarters left."

His challenge echoed through the suddenly silent room. The executives exchanged uneasy glances, no one daring to speak first.
###Chapter 358 Please Be Patient

Seeing that Maxwell's intervention had achieved its intended effect, Evelyn smoothly signaled for him to stop.

She spoke with measured calm. "We still have six months ahead of us. Patience is key. When the time comes, everything will become clear. The final outcome will reveal itself."

Julian Hawthorne nodded in agreement. "Ms. Carter makes a valid point. It's premature to draw conclusions. The situation remains fluid. Let's await the promising developments Ms. Carter will undoubtedly deliver."

Though the other board members remained skeptical about Evelyn's prospects, they followed Julian's lead.

"We'll anticipate your success, Ms. Carter."

"Don't let us down."

"But should you fail to meet expectations, we expect you to honor your commitment and resign promptly."

Evelyn's gaze swept across the conference room. She recognized the corruption permeating the current board, with most members firmly under Julian's influence. His position as their central figure was undeniable.

To reform the board, she understood the necessity of addressing Julian first.

As the meeting concluded and Evelyn exited, a cluster of directors immediately surrounded Julian. "Mr. Hawthorne, Ms. Carter seems so confident. Could we actually lose this?"

"Exactly, Mr. Hawthorne. We've all aligned ourselves with you. If you're forced to leave the board, our positions would become precarious."

"Regardless, you can't let that young woman humiliate you."

Voices of concern filled the air.

Since Evelyn's arrival at Kingsley Industries, they'd chosen Julian's side without hesitation, primarily due to her youth and perceived lack of executive experience.

Now, after six months, Evelyn's performance spoke for itself, presenting a genuine possibility of victory.

If she succeeded, where would that leave Julian's supporters?

"Mr. Hawthorne, you must devise a strategy. If necessary, employ extraordinary measures. Once we remove the Kingsley family from the board, Kingsley Industries will be entirely yours—"

Julian raised a hand, silencing them.

His expression hardened with determination. "Rest assured, Evelyn won't prevail. I'll ensure her defeat is absolute."

The group visibly relaxed at his assurance. "With your guarantee, we're reassured. We'll await the unfolding events then."

"The Kingsley family couldn't have anticipated their downfall would come at Evelyn's hands."

"She's just an inexperienced girl who doesn't understand how the world works. We're merely educating her."

Shared laughter echoed before they dispersed from the conference room.

...

"Ms. Carter, those old men remained in the conference room for quite some time after you left. I can only imagine what they were discussing." Maxwell stormed into the office, his frustration evident.

In stark contrast, Evelyn maintained her composure.

She responded evenly, "It's irrelevant. Did you document their names?"

Maxwell presented his notebook. "Every single one recorded. None were missed."

Evelyn scanned the list, committing it to memory. These were Julian's staunchest allies within the board.

"Understood."

Closing the notebook, Maxwell couldn't contain his curiosity. "Ms. Carter, what's our next move? Will you address these directors individually?"

Evelyn shook her head. "They're not our priority now. Our focus remains on delivering results that speak for themselves."
###Chapter 359 New Venture

Evelyn finished speaking with a decisive nod, motioning to Maxwell. "Bring me all the documentation for the potential acquisitions we've been reviewing."

Seeing Evelyn take charge, Maxwell visibly relaxed. "Right away, Ms. Carter."

Within minutes, he returned with an armful of folders.

He sorted through the most viable investment opportunities before presenting them. "Ms. Carter, these all show excellent growth potential."

"Set them here."

Evelyn selected a file at random, her sharp eyes scanning the contents. Her finger tapped a particular project. "This merger prospect has negotiable terms."

Maxwell nodded in agreement. "The assessment team gave this one favorable marks. However, all their production facilities are located on Azure Isle. An on-site evaluation would require traveling there."

Evelyn considered this. "Where exactly is Azure Isle?"

"Approximately 186 nautical miles west along the coastline. We'd need to charter a vessel - the round trip would take two to three days."

"Have the team prepare. We'll conduct the inspection personally."

"Understood, Ms. Carter."

Meanwhile, an unusual gathering at Kingsley Industries' main entrance drew curious glances from pedestrians.

"Shane, are we really going in?"

Maximilian shot his subordinate an incredulous look. "Why else would we be standing here?" His gaze traveled up the gleaming skyscraper, envy flashing across his features.

"Imagine owning a building like this."

"Yeah boss! Maybe Ms. Carter could get us office space here?"

Maximilian cuffed the speaker's head. "Don't be ridiculous. That's completely inappropriate!"

The young man rubbed his head. "Just joking..."

Another team member came running from the building. "Boss, the receptionist says we need an appointment to see Ms. Carter."

Maximilian cursed under his breath. "Idiots! She's our employer! Since when do we need appointments?"

"They said she's extremely busy."

Maximilian smacked his subordinate's shoulder. "Did you give them my name?"

"I did! They insisted appointments are mandatory for everyone."

Scratching his head in frustration, Maximilian muttered, "Now what?"

"Couldn't we just call her?"

"If I had her direct line, would I be standing here? None of you useless lot could even find a contact number!"

"Actually boss..." A younger team member produced a slip of paper with a handwritten number. "We got it."

Maximilian immediately dialed. Ten minutes later, Maxwell appeared to escort them upstairs via private elevator.

"Damn boss, corporate headquarters are next level!"

"Obviously. This is Kingsley Industries. The Carters could probably smother someone with their cash reserves."

The elevator doors opened directly into Evelyn's office suite. "She's expecting you," Maxwell announced.

Maximilian entered with a broad grin. "Ms. Carter!"
###Chapter 360 Shadows Over Azure Bay

The sudden loud greeting made Evelyn jump. She blinked at the unexpected visitors crowding her office. "Maximilian? What's all this about?"

Maximilian Blackwood lounged comfortably on her sofa, patting his stomach. "Just paying our respects, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn crossed her arms, unimpressed. "You never visit without an agenda. Out with it."

Maximilian scooted closer with an eager grin that didn't suit his usual intimidating demeanor. "Sharp as ever, Ms. Carter."

He leaned forward conspiratorially. "I've been studying chess strategies lately - developed some new techniques. Thought you might indulge me in a match."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "That's really why you're here?"

Maximilian nodded vigorously.

Ever since his humiliating defeat against Evelyn, the chess obsession had consumed him. Nights spent analyzing moves, days practicing against anyone who'd humor him - all for this moment of redemption.

"Please, Ms. Carter? Just one game?"

His pleading eyes held none of their usual menace, replaced instead by the desperate enthusiasm of a chess addict.

"Not today," Evelyn said, stacking files on her desk. "I'm inspecting a development project on Azure Bay. Chess will have to wait until I return."

Maximilian deflated like a punctured balloon, his dramatic sigh filling the office.

Seeing his crestfallen expression, Evelyn softened slightly. "The trip only takes two or three days. Use the time to refine those techniques you mentioned."

Maximilian clutched his chest dramatically. "That's cruel, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn smirked. "I expect to see improvement when I get back."

Speechless, Maximilian could only watch as Evelyn returned to her paperwork. Recognizing her busy schedule, he reluctantly gathered his men to leave.

As they exited the building, realization struck Maximilian like lightning. "Wait - did she say Azure Bay?"

One of his associates frowned. "Isn't that the island we sold to that foreign investor last month? Why would Ms. Carter be going there?"

Maximilian's brow furrowed. "Business partnership, most likely. She's connected everywhere."

The group murmured agreement. "Makes sense. Ms. Carter's network spans continents."

"Enough speculation," Maximilian cut in. "Her business is her own. Let's head back - I need to practice if I'm going to stand a chance against her."

—

That evening found Maximilian hunched over a chessboard in his penthouse, locked in an intense match with one of his associates.

The game reached its climax when a subordinate burst in. "Boss! Urgent news!"

Maximilian didn't look up from the board. "Unless the building's on fire, it can wait."

"But—"

A single glare silenced the man mid-sentence.

An hour later, Maximilian checkmated his opponent with a triumphant grin. "Excellent game."

"Your skills have improved remarkably, boss."

Maximilian preened. "All thanks to Ms. Carter's ruthless teaching methods. Every loss was a lesson."
###Chapter 361 The Trap is Set

The voice on the other end perked up with interest. "Maximilian, since when do you answer to someone?"

Maximilian's lips curled into an enigmatic smile. "That's classified information."

His subordinate interrupted urgently, "Sir, we have a situation. Ms. Carter might be in danger."

Maximilian's demeanor shifted instantly. "Explain. Now."

"Our surveillance team just reported that all communication signals at Horizon Technologies have been jammed. And the buyer... it's Damian Castillo."

"Damian Castillo? The trafficker?"

Maximilian shot to his feet. "Get me my phone immediately."

His fingers flew across the screen as he dialed Evelyn.

——

Meanwhile, Evelyn had just wrapped up her meetings at Kingsley Industries. As the elevator doors opened to the parking garage, she spotted a shadowy figure darting between vehicles.

Her instincts screamed warning.

She took two cautious steps forward when suddenly, the hazard lights of a familiar Rolls-Royce Phantom flashed.

The door swung open to reveal Harrison.

"Evelyn."

She exhaled in relief, waving casually. "What brings you here?"

Harrison closed the distance between them, his fingers intertwining with hers. Just then, her phone vibrated.

"One second," she murmured, pulling away to answer.

Harrison watched as Evelyn's expression darkened with each passing second. When she ended the call, his grip tightened.

"Talk to me. What's wrong?"

Evelyn forced a casual shrug. "Nothing important."

Harrison wasn't buying it. His piercing gaze locked onto hers. "We don't keep secrets, remember?"

After a beat of hesitation, Evelyn met his eyes. "Let's discuss this in the car."

They slid into the plush leather seats, the door closing with a muted thud. Evelyn recounted everything—the suspicious activities at Horizon Technologies, the intercepted communications. Harrison listened intently, his jaw tightening.

"It's a trap. They're targeting you."

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her ice-cold eyes. "Damian's made his last mistake. This time, he won't escape."

Harrison's grip on her hand turned almost painful. "Let me handle this."

For a moment, Evelyn considered refusing. Then a slow, dangerous smile curved her lips. "Actually... why don't we turn their game against them?"

"You're planning to go to the facility." It wasn't a question.

Determination flashed in Evelyn's gaze as her mind raced through contingencies. "Sometimes you have to walk into the lion's den to cut off its head."

Harrison didn't argue. He would never stand in her way—only ensure nothing could touch her. Whatever it took.

——

The next morning, Evelyn cleared her schedule. Only Maxwell accompanied her as they prepared to inspect Horizon Technologies.

"Just the two of us, Ms. Carter?" Maxwell frowned.

Evelyn nodded. "More than sufficient."

Though skeptical, Maxwell didn't question further. "Everything's arranged. The company representative will meet us at the pier."

"Good."

Their driver navigated through the city's winding streets until the industrial pier came into view. Maxwell disappeared briefly to collect their passes.

When he returned, the passes gleamed in his palm. "All set."

The morning sun reflected off the water as they approached the waiting boat, neither noticing the shadowy figures watching from the warehouse windows above.
###Chapter 362 The Day You Meet Your End

Maxwell Donovan glanced at his watch, the polished surface reflecting the afternoon sun.

"Ms. Carter, the ferry departs in fifteen minutes," he said, frowning at the tickets in his hand. "Only three seats remain. The security team may need to wait for the next vessel."

Evelyn Carter tilted her head. "When's the next departure?"

"One hour."

She plucked the tickets from Maxwell's grasp. "We'll proceed ahead. It's merely an inspection. What could possibly go wrong?"

"But Mr. Kingsley insisted your protection detail accompanies you everywhere." Maxwell's fingers twitched nervously, his gaze darting toward the industrial docks. The unspoken dangers of their destination weighed heavily on him.

As he hesitated, Harrison Whitmore emerged from the crowd, his tailored suit cutting an imposing figure against the bustling pier.

Evelyn's face lit up. "Harrison! Over here."

Maxwell exhaled in relief. The presence of Fulton Group's CEO changed everything. Where Harrison went, safety followed.

The trio boarded with minutes to spare. Evelyn rarely traveled by sea, and the rocking motion made her grip the railing tighter than necessary.

After seventy turbulent minutes, Azure Bay Industrial Zone came into view. Strangely, though the ferry had been packed, only their group disembarked.

Maxwell frowned at his phone. "That's odd. No signal whatsoever."

Evelyn exchanged a knowing glance with Harrison, who gave an almost imperceptible nod. Together, they stepped onto the creaking dock.

Two men in ill-fitting suits waved a sign reading "Kingsley Industries."

Maxwell approached with practiced professionalism. "We're from Kingsley Industries. Here for the factory inspection."

The men's eyes slid past him to Evelyn. Their sudden grins revealed yellowed teeth. "This way, this way. Boss has been expecting you."

Something prickled at Maxwell's neck. "Ms. Carter, perhaps we should—"

Evelyn cut him off with a raised hand. Recognition flashed in her eyes. "You're Damian Castillo's men from the bar." Her lips curled in cold amusement. "Where is your cowardly boss hiding?"

The men's faces darkened instantly. "You've got nerve coming to our turf, little miss. Today's the day you meet your end!"

Maxwell's blood ran cold. "Ms. Carter, these are the traffickers?" He fumbled with his dead phone. "We're outnumbered three to—"

Laughter erupted around them as figures materialized from shipping containers. Maxwell moved to defend, but Evelyn's grip on his arm stopped him.

Her calm voice cut through the tension. "Enough theatrics. Take me to Damian."

"Bold words." The lead thug gestured, and four men advanced with ropes.

They never reached her.

Harrison moved like lightning. One moment he stood composed; the next, the would-be captors lay groaning on the asphalt, clutching broken limbs.

Not a single hair on Harrison's head had been disturbed.
###Chapter 363 The Maze's Secret

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smirk as she gazed down at the groaning men at her feet. "I can manage on my own," she stated flatly, her voice devoid of any warmth. "Your assistance isn't required."

The group exchanged stunned glances.

Damian had ordered them to restrain Evelyn. But after witnessing what just happened, none dared lay a finger on her now.

Having seen Harrison's capabilities firsthand, they scrambled to their feet with shared understanding.

Retreat was their only option.

"Ms. Carter, this way please." Their tone had lost all its previous arrogance.

Taking the lead, they began guiding Evelyn forward.

Suddenly, a strong hand enveloped hers, sending unexpected warmth through her fingers. She turned to meet Harrison's steady gaze.

Strangely, her racing heart calmed instantly.

Hand in hand, they walked side by side.

The island's weather mirrored the tension - heavy clouds smothering the sunlight, creating an oppressive atmosphere.

As they progressed, Evelyn noticed their path winding unusually. Harrison leaned in, his whisper barely audible. "They've laid a maze formation here."

Evelyn's eyes widened.

Who still practiced ancient maze formations in this modern age?

"It's not complex," Harrison continued, "but enough to trap the unaware for days."

Evelyn's expression darkened. Damian's knowledge of such techniques revealed depths she hadn't anticipated. He was far more dangerous than she'd imagined.

"Keep moving! No dawdling!" their escort snapped impatiently.

Exchanging a knowing look, Evelyn and Harrison quickened their pace, carefully navigating the hidden pattern.

Finally, they reached a dilapidated structure. Their guide triggered a hidden mechanism on the doorframe, revealing a dim, narrow passage behind the rising iron gate.

"Stay close. Don't get lost."

The flickering lights illuminated their hundred-foot descent into the underground complex.

Then came that chillingly familiar voice. "Ms. Carter, what a pleasure to see you again."

Evelyn's gaze snapped toward the sound.

The face before her bore no resemblance to Damian's remembered features - more flamboyant, with delicate, almost feminine bone structure.

The man lounged on an ornate throne, his malicious grin exposing undisguised contempt.

Yet the voice left no doubt - this was Damian. Her family's failed searches made sense now; he'd reinvented himself completely.

"I never took you for a man who'd change his face," Evelyn remarked coolly. "You're full of surprises, Damian. I'm... impressed."

Damian traced his new features absently, offering no explanation. "I do hope you've been well, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "You didn't go through all this trouble for small talk. What do you want?"

Rising gracefully, Damian descended the steps with deceptive elegance. To an unknowing observer, he might appear merely a charming aristocrat.

He stopped inches from Evelyn, his mocking tone sending chills down her spine. "I crossed oceans to reach Pamore just for you, Ms. Carter. Doesn't that move you?"

Evelyn lifted her chin, meeting his gaze without flinching.
###Chapter 364 Arrogant Scum

"Damian, surrender now. Confess your crimes and release those kidnapped women and children. Otherwise, no amount of deaths could atone for your sins."

Damian Castillo erupted in harsh laughter.

"Turn myself in? Ms. Carter, that's the most ridiculous joke I've ever heard."

His expression darkened instantly.

With lightning speed, he seized Evelyn's chin.

"Your family drove me into a corner, made Frenda uninhabitable for me. They nearly took my life. Since you've cut off all my escape routes, let's all perish together—"

Before he could finish, Harrison's hand shot out, striking Damian's arm with precision.

A sharp numbness spread through Damian's limb. The sudden pain made his grip falter.

He flexed his fingers, but the tingling sensation persisted. His cold gaze locked onto Harrison. "What did you just do?"

Harrison's eyes darkened, a dangerous smirk playing on his lips. "Merely struck a pressure point. Nothing permanent. You'll regain feeling in... five minutes."

Damian's face twisted with rage at the casual explanation.

Copyright N?v/el/Dra/ma.Org.

One effortless strike from Harrison had rendered his entire arm useless.

"Who the hell are you?" Damian ground out, mentally scanning his extensive database of enemies but finding no match.

Harrison's icy stare never wavered. "You're unworthy of that knowledge."

Damian's fury erupted. "You arrogant bastard! I'll skin both of you alive tonight!"

His eyes gleamed with manic intensity as he delivered the chilling threat.

"Midorien's organ market needs fresh stock. Perfect timing to deliver two high-quality specimens. Might even fetch premium prices."

Evelyn's face paled. "So it's true—not just human trafficking but organ harvesting too—"

Her fists clenched at the thought of innocent lives lost. "Damian, you're worse than an animal. You don't deserve to breathe."

Damian's laughter echoed through the chamber, sharp and mocking.

"Ms. Carter, you're still so naive about how the world works. No matter. I've prepared special entertainment for you both."

At his signal, henchmen wheeled in a cart laden with medieval-looking torture devices.

Damian selected a gleaming scalpel, testing its edge against his palm. "Imagine this carving delicate patterns into your pretty face."

He tilted Evelyn's chin, feigning sympathy. "Such a shame to ruin perfection. But monstrous scars would suit you soon."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. Just as she prepared to retaliate, Harrison's fingers interlaced with hers, a silent command to wait.

Unaware, Damian continued his macabre showcase, producing a set of dental pliers next. "These extract teeth one by one. The screams are... musical."

Evelyn spat through clenched teeth. "I'd like to see you try!"

Damian arched an eyebrow. "Shall we test that theory?"

###Chapter 365 The Outcome Is Uncertain

Damian Castillo smirked as he set down the pliers. His fingers curled around a gleaming surgical blade instead. "Do you know what this is for?"

Evelyn Carter's stomach twisted at the sight. She knew exactly what that instrument meant.

But Damian answered his own question with chilling glee. "This will gut you like a fish."

A violent gag reflex seized Evelyn's throat.

The monster before her threw back his head in laughter. "Already losing your nerve, Ms. Carter? And we've barely started."

His grin turned feral. "When you meet the devil tonight, give him my regards."

A sharp gesture sent his goons advancing.

Harrison Whitmore moved like lightning, placing himself between Evelyn and danger. His dark eyes promised death to anyone who came closer.

The thugs froze under that murderous gaze.

"Worthless idiots!" Damian screamed. "Move!"

Trembling but obedient, the men lunged forward.

Harrison's boot connected with a chest. Ribs shattered. Blood sprayed across the concrete.

Damian's smirk faltered. He'd never seen such raw power. "Who the hell are you?"

"That's irrelevant." Harrison's voice could have frozen hell.

Evelyn stepped forward, her voice glacial. "Did you really think we'd come unprepared?"

Damian forced a laugh. "Ah yes, your little security detail. Trained professionals, no doubt." His smile turned vicious. "Pity they won't be joining us tonight."

He spread his arms wide. "Face it, Ms. Carter. No one's coming to save you. Not even your pet killer here."

Evelyn's lips curved. "Care to wager your life on that?"

Damian's eyes lit up. "My life? How dramatic." He gestured to the warehouse. "But you seem confused about who controls this territory."

Evelyn's smile turned predatory. "Are you certain you know whose territory this really is?"

Darkness swallowed the room.

Screams erupted in the blackness.

When the lights flared back to life, the scene had shifted completely. Harrison now held Damian in a brutal chokehold, the surgical blade kissing his throat.

Evelyn pressed her own dagger against Damian's abdomen. "You wanted to test this blade's sharpness." Her voice dripped venom. "Shall we conduct that experiment now?"
###Chapter 366 The Hostage Standoff

Evelyn's voice cut through the air like ice, sending involuntary shivers down Damian's spine. "M-Ms. Carter, let's discuss this rationally. Bringing knives into the conversation seems... unnecessary."

But mercy wasn't in Evelyn's vocabulary tonight. The blade flashed, slicing through fabric until cold steel pressed against bare flesh.

"Discuss what?" Her laugh held no humor. "Did your victims get negotiations when you held them at knifepoint?"

"Release Damian now, and we'll let you walk away alive!" a voice shouted from the shadows.

Evelyn's grip tightened. "Tell your dogs to back off," she hissed against Damian's ear, "unless you want to see how deep this goes."

The color drained from Damian's face. "Back the hell up!" he barked at his men. "All of you!"

Reluctant footsteps retreated across creaking floorboards. In the flickering lantern light, Evelyn studied Damian's features—really studied them—and realization struck.

"That disguise at our first meeting... This is your real face." Her blade traced his jawline. "Isn't it?"

Damian's breath hitched. He hadn't expected her to piece it together.

"Does it matter?" He forced a laugh. "Even if you drag me to prison tonight, Ms. Carter, do you really think this ends here? Our business has layers you can't begin to comprehend."

His smile turned predatory. "Consider this a friendly warning—some shadows are better left undisturbed. When the time comes—"

The unspoken threat hung between them, thick as the island's salty air.

Evelyn knew the risks. But someone had to stand in the fire.

Even if she couldn't burn the whole operation down, she'd scorch every hand that reached for another victim.

"Pamore's laws can't touch me," Damian taunted. "I'll be extradited to Frenda within weeks. What then? You really think I won't slip through their fingers?"

Evelyn's smile mirrored his own cruelty. "Oh, you'll stand trial in Frenda. And I'll personally ensure the cell door locks behind you."

Footsteps pounded up the dock. One of Damian's men burst in, then froze at the scene.

"Boss! The—the entire island's surrounded! Frenda's SWAT teams, local police... There's no way out!"

Evelyn's gaze flicked to Harrison. So he'd called in the cavalry after all.

"Time to go," she announced, withdrawing the knife just enough for Harrison to seize Damian's arms.

Outside, floodlights illuminated the chaotic scene—Frenda's tactical units swarming the docks, radios crackling. Within minutes, steel cuffs snapped around Damian's wrists.

As they dragged him toward the police boat, he turned with a grin that made Evelyn's blood run cold.

"This isn't over, Ms. Carter."

Her fingers curled into fists.

"We'll meet again," he promised, voice carrying over the waves. "Count on it."

The bad feeling settled in her gut like a stone. Some doors, once opened, couldn't be closed.
###Chapter 367 The Wheels of Justice

An explosion rocked the air just as Harrison predicted. His arms instinctively wrapped around Evelyn as they both hit the ground hard.

"Secure the prisoner!" someone shouted.

Officers swarmed around Damian Castillo, but the criminal only smirked. With practiced ease, he slipped free from his restraints. More explosions erupted in the distance as he vanished into the chaos.

The blasts came in rapid succession, each strategically placed to create maximum confusion. When the smoke finally cleared, Evelyn gasped. "Where's Damian? He's gone!"

Panic spread through the crowd. The handcuffed fugitive had disappeared right before their eyes.

"Alert all units," Harrison barked into his radio. "Seal every exit. I want this bastard found."

"Yes, Mr. Whitmore."

He turned to Evelyn, his voice steady. "Every possible escape route is blocked. Between the police and my security team, there's no way out."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms. "He's too clever. We had him and he still slipped away."

"Justice always catches up eventually," Harrison murmured.

The radio crackled to life moments later. "Target apprehended. Just as you suspected - he tried swimming to freedom. Our divers intercepted him."

Evelyn exhaled sharply, though anger still burned in her chest. "That snake thought he could escape? He just traded one prison for another."

They rushed to the shoreline where Damian stood dripping wet between two officers. His earlier bravado had vanished. "I surrender," he muttered.

"This isn't surrender," Evelyn spat. "This is consequences."

Damian chuckled darkly. "Ms. Carter, your family may be powerful, but enemies surround you. I'll enjoy watching your downfall from hell."

Evelyn's face hardened. "Pity you won't live to see another sunset."

"Death doesn't scare men like me," he sneered.

"Enough!" The lead officer jerked Damian's chains. Turning to Evelyn, he said respectfully, "Thanks to your efforts, we've dismantled a major trafficking ring. We'll transport him to Frenda for trial."

Evelyn nodded stiffly. "See that justice is served."

As officers marched Damian onto the waiting vessel, Evelyn and Harrison remained on the dock. She stared at the horizon long after the ship disappeared.

Harrison's hand found hers. "The law will handle him now."

She gave a tight nod. Men like Damian deserved no sympathy, no matter their fate.

"This wouldn't have been possible without you," she admitted quietly. Alone, she never could have outmaneuvered such a dangerous opponent.
###Chapter 368 I Was Waiting for You

Nathan gazed at Evelyn, his lips curling into a faint smile. "It's done. Let's head back."

When they returned to Pamore, Evelyn's phone buzzed with a call from Dominic.

"Evelyn, have you lost your mind? Going alone to meet someone as dangerous as Damian Castillo? Do you realize what could have happened?"

"Dominic, I'm perfectly fine. And Harrison was with me the whole time. Now that Damian's been arrested, you can stop worrying."

Dominic already knew the outcome.

Yet it stung how little she seemed to need him these days. Such a major event, and she hadn't even bothered to inform him beforehand.

The realization left a bitter taste in his mouth.

"Don't ever pull a stunt like that again, Evelyn."

She sighed into the phone. "I won't, I promise."

After exchanging a few more words, Dominic finally ended the call. Leonard stood nearby, his brow furrowed with concern. "Is Evelyn alright? Was she hurt?"

Dominic pocketed his phone. "She's fine, Grandpa. That Whitmore boy was with her. She wouldn't do anything too reckless."

At the mention of Harrison, Leonard's expression brightened slightly. "Her taste in men has certainly improved since last time. Though it's a shame about the Prescott alliance. All those years of friendship between our families..."

His voice trailed off with unmistakable regret. The Kingsley and Prescott families had shared decades of camaraderie. A marriage alliance would have been the perfect culmination.

But matters of the heart couldn't be forced.

"Grandpa, we have to trust Evelyn's judgment. She won't disappoint us this time."

"Dominic, don't just focus on your sister. You're not getting any younger either. When are you going to introduce your girlfriend to this old man?"

The moment the conversation turned to him, Dominic became evasive. "I've got urgent matters at the office. I should go."

He made a hasty exit before Leonard could respond. The elderly man shook his head as he watched his grandson retreat.

"Why does he act like a lovesick teenager when it comes to relationships? Ah well, young people these days..."

Several days passed in a whirlwind of activity for Evelyn. She'd taken charge of multiple new projects, her schedule packed to the brim.

Today found her in the business district, preparing for yet another client meeting over dinner.

Weeks of negotiations and meticulous preparation had led to this moment. Yet the other party remained frustratingly noncommittal, dragging their feet at every turn.

Before entering the private dining room, Maxwell couldn't contain his frustration. "Ms. Carter, we've bent over backwards for them. They're clearly not interested in working with us. Why are we still wasting our time?"

Evelyn smoothed her expression. "Let's meet their CEO today. If they're still unwilling, we'll walk away."

Taking a deep breath, she fixed a professional smile in place before pushing open the door. "My apologies for keeping you waiting."

The words died on her lips as she froze mid-step.

Sitting at the table was none other than Nathan Sterling.

"Mr. Sterling, what an unexpected surprise!" She recovered her composure so swiftly that no one could have noticed her momentary shock.

Nathan's intense gaze never left her face. It had been weeks since he'd last seen her. She looked thinner now, her features more sharply defined.

"This isn't a coincidence," he said quietly. "I was waiting for you."
###Chapter 369 No Free Lunch

"Ms. Carter, perhaps we should—" Maxwell hesitated, clearly uncomfortable with Evelyn having extensive contact with Nathan.

But Evelyn knew some encounters were inevitable.

She entered the room with measured steps, radiating quiet confidence with every movement.

"So you're the silent partner behind this venture. Quite the revelation."

Nathan gave an easy smile as he leaned back. "Sterling Enterprises wasn't originally in this sector. But we're making an exception to work with Kingsley Industries."

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Are you suggesting Sterling wants to collaborate with us?"

Nathan accepted a folder from Simon. "Precisely. We just need to finalize the details."

One elegant brow arched, though her tone remained composed. "Do you have reservations, Mr. Sterling?"

"There's one point. The profit allocation seems... unbalanced."

Maxwell adjusted his glasses sharply at this. The proposal already favored Sterling Enterprises—this felt like bad faith negotiating.

"Mr. Sterling," Maxwell interjected, "as the newcomer to this venture, standard profit ratios should apply. Unless you're not serious about this partnership?"

Nathan's gaze never left Evelyn. "Your associate makes a valid point. By conventional calculations, Sterling stands to gain significantly."

He tapped the documents. "A fifty-fifty split seems excessive. Let's adjust to seventy-thirty—with Kingsley taking the larger share."

Maxwell's eyes widened. This wasn't negotiation—it was practically philanthropy. That twenty percent shift represented hundreds of millions.

"Ms. Carter, your thoughts?"

Evelyn studied Nathan's unreadable expression. "Mr. Sterling, is this business or benevolence?"

His response came calmly. "Consider it ensuring you have sufficient leverage against your boardroom detractors."

Her fingers tightened imperceptibly. How did he know about Kingsley's internal power struggles?

"I appreciate the gesture, but no." Her refusal was immediate. "Business should remain business. Unearned generosity raises questions. If this isn't a genuine collaboration, we should end discussions here."

She rose to leave.

Nathan remained seated, unfazed. "I'm aware of your wager with the board. Lose that bet, and you forfeit control of Kingsley Industries entirely."

Evelyn turned sharply. "That's hardly your concern."

Their gazes locked as he stood. "This project's profits could boost your performance metrics by five percent. Evelyn, I'm trying to help you."

A humorless smile touched her lips. "The world offers no free lunches, Mr. Sterling. Consider this collaboration terminated."

She exited without backward glance.

Nathan's jaw tightened at her dismissal—not just of his offer, but of the carefully maintained boundaries between them.

Without hesitation, he followed her out.
###Chapter 370 Encounter with Eleanor

"Evelyn, wait."

Evelyn froze mid-step, her irritation palpable. "Mr. Sterling, is there something else?"

"Nathan, I—"

Before he could continue, a familiar voice cut through the tension. "Nathan, what are you doing here?"

Eleanor's face brightened momentarily before darkening when she spotted Evelyn standing beside him. "You're still seeing this woman? Are you deliberately trying to provoke me?"

Nathan's expression turned stormy. "Mother, this is my personal matter. Stay out of it."

He reached for Evelyn's arm. "Let's leave."

Evelyn instinctively recoiled from his touch. "Mr. Sterling, please maintain some boundaries."

Turning to Eleanor, she spoke with icy politeness. "Rest assured, Mrs. Blackwell. There's absolutely nothing between your son and me."

Eleanor bristled at Evelyn's haughty demeanor. Though she secretly regretted not cultivating better relations with the Kingsley family through Evelyn, pride forced her to double down on her mistakes.

Thankfully, Nathan remained an exceptional catch with no shortage of admirers. Evelyn held no significance in her eyes.

With this thought, Eleanor abruptly pushed forward the woman accompanying her. "Nathan, this is Juliette Blackwood, the renowned designer I mentioned. Her family owns Blackwood Estates. She's perfect for you."

Eleanor's chin lifted triumphantly, as if silently declaring any woman Nathan chose would be infinitely superior to Evelyn.

Afraid of misunderstandings, Nathan interjected sharply. "Mother, enough of this nonsense."

Evelyn remained composed, her expression unreadable.

She turned to leave.

Unexpectedly, Juliette stepped forward. "Ms. Carter, your reputation precedes you. Seeing you in person, I understand why."

Juliette approached with a practiced smile. "Juliette Blackwood. It's an honor to meet the legendary Evelyn Carter."

When Evelyn didn't respond, she continued smoothly, "I heard you graduated from Coronia's School of Design. What a coincidence—we're alumni."

This finally drew Evelyn's attention. She paused, studying Juliette properly for the first time.

Juliette carried herself with polished elegance, her smile carefully calibrated to appear genuine. "Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Blackwood."

Juliette produced an embossed business card with gilded lettering. "Class of 2018. Which year did you graduate?"

Evelyn accepted the card. "2019. So you're my senior."

Juliette's smile widened. "The world truly is small."

Eleanor, who had been silently fuming, finally snapped. She yanked Juliette back. "You know this woman?"

Juliette explained calmly, "Not personally. We attended the same university."

Eleanor scoffed loudly. "Her? At Coronia? Don't make me laugh. Her family must have bribed their way in."
###Chapter 371 The Art of Deception

"Mother, what absurdity are you speaking?" Nathan swiftly intercepted Eleanor. Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined she could harbor such venom toward Evelyn.

The realization struck him like lightning.

He'd been utterly blind.

Yet Evelyn remained unshaken. "Mr. Sterling, I'll take my leave now."

Nathan moved to follow, but Eleanor clutched his arm desperately. "Nathan, I can't... I can't breathe properly. My chest—"

"Madam Blackwell, are you unwell?" Juliette's voice dripped with false concern.

Nathan hesitated, torn between chasing Evelyn and attending to his mother's sudden distress. "Mother? What's wrong?"

Eleanor seized the opportunity, gripping his forearm tighter. "Nathan darling, listen to me. That Evelyn girl is trouble. Look at Juliette here—such refinement, such grace. You two would make a perfect match."

A cold realization dawned in Nathan's eyes.

With deliberate slowness, he peeled Eleanor's fingers away. His voice turned glacial. "Mother, your performance deserves an Oscar. I never realized what a talented actress you were until now."

"How could you say such things, Nathan? Nathan—!"

Her cries fell on deaf ears as Nathan sprinted after Evelyn.

But fate conspired against him. By the time he burst through the restaurant doors, Evelyn's car had already disappeared into the stream of traffic.

—

Inside the moving vehicle, Evelyn absently twirled a business card between her fingers. The embossed name "Juliette Blackwood" seemed to glare up at her.

Something about the woman's perfectly curated kindness had set off alarm bells in Evelyn's mind.

She reached for her phone and dialed a familiar number.

Natalie answered on the second ring. "To what do I owe this pleasure? Miss me already?"

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Are you swamped?"

"Buried alive," Natalie groaned dramatically. "What's up? Need a favor?"

"No pleasantries then—I need intel on someone."

"Ooh, someone important enough for the great Evelyn Carter to investigate personally?"

"Ever heard of Juliette Blackwood? International design scene, supposedly quite famous."

"Wait—Juliette Blackwood? That name rings a bell... Give me a sec."

The line went silent except for the sound of frantic typing. Two minutes later, Natalie's voice returned, tinged with excitement.

"Knew I recognized that name! It's her! You know Jion? The fashion designer who took Paris by storm last season?"

Evelyn's eyebrow arched. "You're telling me Juliette is Jion?"

"Bingo! Jion's her professional alias!"

Natalie launched into an animated explanation.

"She's huge overseas. Like you, she studied at Coronia—actually graduated top of her class. Won every major design award by twenty-five, including that Vogue prize you snagged junior year."

Evelyn nodded slowly. "So she's my senior."

"Exactly! Jion's Instagram alone has three million followers. Teen girls worship her aesthetic—that whole edgy-but-wearable vibe."

After the information dump, Natalie finally asked, "So how'd you cross paths with the illustrious Juliette Blackwood?"
###Chapter 372 The Plagiarism Scandal

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile as she spoke into the phone. "You won't believe who I just saw having lunch together—Juliette and Eleanor Blackwell."

"No way!" Olivia's gasp was audible through the receiver. "Your ex-mother-in-law? Is she trying to push Nathan into marrying Juliette now?"

With an enigmatic smile, Evelyn arched one perfectly shaped brow and deftly changed the subject. "Thanks for the heads-up, darling. Dinner's on me next week."

This is property of NovelDrama.Org.

"Absolutely. I should get back to work now."

As the call ended, Evelyn slid Juliette's embossed business card into her designer wallet. Though their paths had rarely crossed, an inexplicable intuition told her this wouldn't be their last encounter.

Her instincts proved right sooner than expected.

Three days later, Olivia's frantic call shattered her morning. "Eve, we've got a serious situation."

"What happened? Breathe, then explain."

"Check your phone immediately. Someone's accusing our boutique of plagiarizing multiple signature designs. It's trending number one on Twitter."

The accusation was preposterous. Evelyn's fingers flew across her screen, pulling up the trending list.

There it was—her boutique's name emblazoned across the top, the scarlet letter "PLAGIARISM" burning beneath it.

With their loyal customer base and social media following, the allegations had exploded like wildfire.

"I can't believe this! That ivory lace gown was my favorite piece in their collection!"

"Not just one design—multiple pieces stolen from the same original designer. Doesn't the creator have any shame?"

"Shame? People like her wouldn't recognize shame if it slapped them in the face."

"Originality is sacred! Plagiarists belong on the industry blacklist. That store needs to shut down immediately!"

Each vitriolic comment hit like a physical blow. But the nightmare was just beginning.

"Evelyn, protestors are outside the boutique demanding we close shop and leave the mall!"

"Lock the doors immediately," Evelyn commanded, her voice steady despite the adrenaline coursing through her veins. "I'll handle this personally."

She ended the call and stood abruptly.

Maxwell looked up from his paperwork. "Ms. Carter? Is everything—"

"Cancel all my appointments," Evelyn interrupted, already striding toward the elevator.

The scene at the mall was worse than she'd imagined. A mob surrounded her shuttered boutique, some wielding spray paint to scrawl "THIEVES" across the pristine glass. Mall security stood helpless against the swelling crowd.

Then strong hands gripped her shoulders. Harrison Whitmore's concerned face appeared beside her. "Evelyn, are you alright?"

Exhaustion and frustration warred in her eyes as she focused on him. "Harrison... I didn't steal those designs."

The raw pain in her voice made his chest tighten. He pulled her into a protective embrace. "I know. I believe you. But this is bigger than it seems—we need to tread carefully."

His words anchored her. Drawing a steadying breath, she nodded. "We'll uncover the truth. I won't let them destroy everything I've built."

After a quick call to Olivia, they left the chaotic scene together.

——

Later that evening, Olivia burst into Horizon Technologies' executive office, thrusting a thick dossier into Evelyn's waiting hands. "I found something you need to see."
###Chapter 373 We Meet Again

"Evelyn, look at this. It's the user's Instagram account."

Olivia handed her phone to Evelyn, who immediately saw the damning post.

The account had used their real identity to accuse the boutique of plagiarism. Side-by-side comparisons of original sketches and the boutique's designs were displayed like evidence in a courtroom.

Multiple signature pieces were flagged as stolen, all pointing directly to Evelyn as the culprit.

Her fingers trembled as she scrolled through the images. These were her designs—every stitch, every silhouette conceived in late-night bursts of inspiration. Two of them had even been her senior thesis pieces.

"This is absurd. Completely absurd." She set the phone down, her mind racing.

Harrison slid a tablet toward her, his expression grim. "We dug deeper. You're being accused of copying Juliette Blackwood. She's a heavyweight in the design world with a massive following. She just reposted the allegations on her official page, vowing legal action."

"Juliette?"

Evelyn let out a disbelieving laugh. "She's claiming I stole from her? Is she delusional?"

Harrison pulled up Juliette's profile. The accusation post was pinned at the top, already racking up thousands of likes and shares.

"Don't panic. Something's off here," Harrison said, his voice steady. "My team found out someone paid to push this to the top of trending lists—and keep it there for days."

"I suppressed it temporarily, but we need the truth. Otherwise—"

He didn’t need to finish. For a designer, plagiarism was career suicide.

If she couldn’t clear her name, the boutique would collapse. Worse, her reputation would be ashes.

"We have to get to the bottom of this."

Harrison tapped the screen. "If your designs are original, how did she fabricate this? The answer lies with her."

Their eyes met, the same realization dawning. "We need to talk to Juliette."

Evelyn remembered the business card Juliette had slipped her at their first meeting. She dialed the number without hesitation. "Ms. Blackwood, it's Evelyn. We need to talk."

Juliette’s voice was eerily calm. "I've been expecting your call. Meet me at Suite 2202, the Sterling Tower."

The line went dead.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Her instincts had been right—Juliette had a vendetta.

But why? They’d never even crossed paths before this.

"Harrison, we’re going to the Sterling Tower."

He nodded. "I'm coming with you."

Olivia grabbed her bag. "Me too."

The Sterling Tower loomed over downtown’s financial district. After parking, they rode the elevator in tense silence to the 22nd floor.

Before the doors fully opened, a familiar silhouette came into view.

Juliette’s voice cut through the quiet.

"Ms. Carter. We meet again."
###Chapter 374 A Billion Dollars in Compensation

Juliette finished speaking with a slow turn of her head. That practiced smile still lingered on her lips, radiating warmth and approachability.

But Evelyn wasn’t fooled this time. She cut straight to the chase. "Ms. Blackwood, don’t you think you owe me an explanation?"

Juliette laughed, the sound light and airy.

She spread her hands in mock innocence. "Explanation? For what? Aren’t we here to discuss compensation?"

"You’ve stolen years of my work. You must have made a fortune by now. I hear your boutique is thriving, so paying me back shouldn’t be an issue, right?"

"Unless… you’d rather settle this in court? I’d be happy to oblige."

Evelyn’s gaze turned icy. She didn’t understand where Juliette’s confidence came from. "I didn’t plagiarize."

A simple statement, firm and unyielding.

Juliette’s smile widened. "Who would believe that? The evidence speaks for itself. Why keep denying it, Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn remained composed. "We both know the truth. I’m just curious—where did you get those drafts?"

Juliette exhaled dramatically. "Ms. Carter, the plagiarism is undeniable. Why waste time questioning it?"

"As for the drafts, I drew them myself, of course. And I did it years before you."

"That’s impossible."

Evelyn pressed her lips together, fighting to keep her composure.

Juliette shrugged. "Still refusing to admit it? Fine. I’ll show you proof."

With a snap of her fingers, an assistant approached, carrying a stack of aged design drafts. The sketches were nearly identical to Evelyn’s—except the dates on them were seven years old, the paper yellowed with time.

"See for yourself, Ms. Carter."

Evelyn’s breath caught. Disbelief flashed in her eyes as she stared at the impossible evidence.

How?

Juliette continued smoothly, "Let’s not waste time. Name your price, and maybe we can still negotiate."

"Or skip the pleasantries. But be prepared for the entire design community to turn against you."

Evelyn scoffed. "You think twisting the truth will work? You’re that confident I won’t expose you?"

Juliette met her gaze, unshaken. "Who would believe you? With my reputation, crushing you would be effortless. What do you have to challenge me?"

Before Evelyn could respond, Harrison stepped forward.

His voice was cold, detached. "State your terms. Or should I ask—how much do you want?"

Juliette’s eyes flickered with interest as she took in Harrison’s commanding presence. He was every inch the elite, and for a moment, her attention wavered.

But business came first.

"One billion dollars. Cash." She smiled sweetly. "Surely that’s manageable for you, Ms. Carter. Pay up, and I’ll consider dropping the matter."
###Chapter 375 The Game Is Afoot

One billion dors?

The sheer audacity took my breath away.

"Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound?" Olivia snapped, her voice dripping with disdain. "Making outrageous demands like that—have you no shame?"

I stood frozen, my fingers curling into fists. Evelyn Carter didn't steal designs. That much I knew with absolute certainty.

"The truth always comes to light," Juliette countered smoothly, ignoring Olivia's outburst. "No amount of fame can rewrite facts. Aren't you worried your precious fans will see the real you?"

She moved closer until mere inches separated us, her cold smile never wavering.

"I'll be direct, Ms. Carter." Her manicured fingers tapped against her elbow. "You have two options—pay the settlement or we all go down together. Your choice."

My nails bit into my palms. The venom in her gaze confused me. We'd never even met before this accusation.

Yet she looked at me like I'd personally ruined her life.

"Ms. Blackwood," I said through gritted teeth, "I've never encountered someone with such breathtaking lack of integrity."

She merely laughed. "Coming from you, that's rich. After everything you've done?"

Everything I'd done?

The cryptic remark sent warning bells clanging in my mind. What game was she playing?

"Three days." She held up three fingers like a countdown. "That's all the time you get to produce the money. Fail, and I'll destroy what's left of your reputation."

The silence stretched unbearably until Harrison's voice cut through it.

"Seven days," he countered. "A sum that large requires coordination with multiple financial institutions."

Juliette's smirk widened as she turned back to me. "Does he speak for you, Ms. Carter?"

I met Harrison's steady gaze, drawing strength from his unshakable calm.

"Seven days," I confirmed.

"Perfect." Juliette's heels clicked against the marble as she turned to leave. "I'll expect your compliance."

The moment she disappeared from view, her polished facade shattered.

"Juliette, are we really just taking the money?" her companion asked nervously.

Her face twisted into something ugly. "The money?" she hissed. "The money is nothing."

"But a billion dors—"

"Is pocket change to the Kingsleys," she finished bitterly. "This was never about money. I want her ruined. I want her to suffer like—" She cut herself off, taking a shuddering breath. "Just make sure there's no trail leading back to us. No mistakes."

Her companion nodded hastily.

Juliette stared at the space where I'd stood moments before, her expression glacial. "Evelyn Carter... you have no idea what's coming."

Back in the conference room, Olivia was nearly vibrating with outrage.

"Evelyn! Why would you agree to this? She's the one who plagiarized your work! Now she's extorting us while dragging your name through the mud!"

Harrison placed a calming hand on her shoulder. "We needed time."

"For what?" Olivia demanded.

I exhaled slowly, the pieces clicking together. "To prove she's lying." My phone buzzed with an incoming message from Elliot. "And I think my brother just found our smoking gun."
###Chapter 376 Strange Hostility

Evelyn stayed quiet, her mind clearly working through some complex thoughts.

After a long pause, she turned to Harrison with sudden understanding flashing in her eyes. "Harrison, let me take a wild guess. That seven-day deadline you suggested... there's more to it, isn't there?"

Harrison leaned back, arms crossed in that infuriatingly confident way of his. Yet his voice softened when he spoke. "I should know better than to try hiding things from you."

The silent understanding between them spoke volumes.

Olivia looked back and forth between them, completely lost. "Evelyn, what kind of secret language are you two speaking?"

"Don't worry about it, Olivia." Evelyn gave her friend a reassuring smile. "In this world, every action leaves traces behind."

"So?"

"The truth will surface eventually. Those designs Juliette claims I stole? They're from my university portfolio. The original sketches are still archived at the design school. We just need time to prove it."

Time to gather the evidence that would clear her name.

Olivia's eyes widened with realization. "So you need to go back to campus?"

Evelyn nodded. "It's been too long. Maybe I'll find something useful there. Harrison—"

Before she could finish, Harrison anticipated her request. "I'm coming with you."

Gratitude warmed Evelyn's voice. "Thank you."

...

That afternoon, she cleared her schedule at Kingsley Industries and boarded Harrison's private jet bound for Coronia. The exhaustion of the past days finally caught up with her, and she leaned back against the plush seat, eyes drifting shut. Within minutes, her breathing evened out into sleep.

Harrison studied her peaceful expression with quiet affection. In this moment, everything felt right. He carefully draped a cashmere blanket over her.

Just then, a phone vibrated against the polished mahogany table.

Despite being mid-flight, the satellite connection kept them reachable. Harrison moved to the other side of the cabin and activated the large screen display.

Callum Blackwood's grinning face appeared immediately. "Harrison! Finally getting to see your handsome face—"

Harrison cut through his friend's playful greeting. "Get to the point."

The abruptness wiped the smirk off Callum's face. "Right. About that background check on Juliette Blackwood you requested."

"Find anything noteworthy?"

Callum shook his head. "Clean as a whistle. Spotless academic record, simple family background. I dug through all her social connections too—nothing suspicious."

"Spotless background?" Harrison's fingers began an absent rhythm against the armrest.

The familiar gesture made Callum stiffen. When Harrison did that, trouble usually followed.

Though unsure why Harrison wanted Juliette investigated, Callum recognized his friend's dissatisfaction. "Harrison, Juliette's been the perfect student since kindergarten. Top of her class, teacher's pet—the whole package."

"Only notable event was a car crash five years back. Parents died on impact, but she walked away without a scratch. Became an orphan overnight."

Harrison's fingers stilled. "She was in an accident?"

Callum nodded. "Checked the police reports myself. Family sedan lost control on the freeway, collided head-on with a semi-truck."

"Parents died instantly. Medical reports called her survival a miracle."
###Chapter 377 Mrs. Whitmore

"Email me all the information related to that accident immediately."

"On it."

Within minutes, Callum had forwarded everything to Harrison.

Harrison opened his inbox and scanned through the documents with practiced efficiency.

"What's all this about, Harrison?"

Evelyn had woken from her nap.

Still reviewing the files, Harrison answered without hesitation, "I ran a background check on Juliette. Everything checks out except for a car crash five years ago. Her parents died, but she survived."

Evelyn's brow furrowed as she made the obvious connection to Juliette's hostility. "You think that accident involves me?"

Harrison handed her his phone. After reading, she shook her head. "I'd never met Juliette before this, nor her parents."

So why did Juliette harbor such intense hatred toward her? It felt like some ancient blood feud between them.

"Don't stress about it. Rx. I'll handle this." Harrison gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze.

Evelyn nodded, but questions swirled in her mind. Something about this situation didn't add up.

Noticing her troubled expression, Harrison smoothly changed subjects. "We'll be landing in Coronia within the hour."

Evelyn took a deep breath and murmured in acknowledgement.

This city - both familiar and foreign - was a place she hadn't visited since graduating university. Memories of Nathan Sterling surfaced unbidden. They'd first met at Coronia University.

—

Exactly sixty minutes later, the jet touched down on a private airstrip.

Callum had been waiting. Spotting Harrison, he rushed forward with arms outstretched. "Harrison! Man, it's been too long!"

Harrison sidestepped the embrace, his expression one of mild disgust.

Undeterred, Callum tried again - only to freeze mid-motion when he noticed Evelyn standing beside Harrison.

He blinked rapidly, all movement ceasing. His inner gossipmonger roared to life.

There was actually a woman standing next to Harrison Whitmore!

This was unprecedented.

"Harrison, pinch me - I must be dreaming!"

Watching Callum's theatrical reaction, Harrison facepalmed before making introductions. "Evelyn, this is Callum. My resident pain in the ass."

With a polite smile, Evelyn waved. "Nice to meet you, Callum. I'm Evelyn Carter."

Evelyn? THE Evelyn?

In Callum and Harrison's circle, the name "Evelyn" carried weight.

Though they'd never met her, everyone knew she was the woman Harrison had pined for all these years.

Callum's excitement bubbled over. Unable to contain himself, he blurted, "Pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Whitmore!"

The air turned electric.

Evelyn's cheeks flamed. Before she could form a coherent denial - "I-I'm not—"

Callum, misinterpreting her reaction as shyness, barreled on. "No need for formalities, Mrs. Whitmore! We're all family here. Just call me Cal."

Evelyn stammered helplessly.

Harrison pulled her closer, shooting Callum a look. "You're overwhelming her. Just call her Evelyn."

The protective gesture was textbook alpha male.

Callum couldn't help thinking Harrison had never looked more badass.
###Chapter 378 Is This Your Husband

"Is the limousine prepared?"

Callum Blackwood rushed forward with an eager grin. "All set, Harrison. Your driver will take you directly to Coronia University's main gate."

Harrison Whitmore turned to Evelyn Carter with a questioning glance. "Shall we depart now?"

Evelyn gave a small nod before falling into step beside Harrison. As they moved toward the vehicle, Callum kept pace with animated chatter, pointing out various campus landmarks through the windows.

During the ride, Evelyn found herself mesmerized by the passing scenery outside her window. The familiar sights transported her back to her college days - a time of youthful innocence and carefree joy.

The crunch of gravel beneath tires snapped her from her reverie as they entered the university grounds. Sunlight filtered through towering oak trees, casting dappled shadows across the manicured lawns.

Once the car settled in its parking space, Callum announced with unnecessary flourish, "We've arrived at our destination!"

Harrison and Evelyn exited the vehicle while Callum wisely remained behind. With a theatrical wave, he called out, "I'll be right here if you need anything. Just text me!"

Harrison surprised Evelyn by interlacing their fingers as they began walking. The cobblestone path beneath their feet sparked memories.

"Can you believe it's been nearly four years?" Evelyn murmured, her voice tinged with nostalgia. Three of those years had been wasted on Nathan Sterling - trapped in a loveless marriage she should have escaped sooner.

"Time does fly," Harrison agreed, his gaze lingering on her face. "In my mind, you're still that pigtailed girl who used to cry over scraped knees. Now look at you - a formidable CEO."

Evelyn's cheeks flushed. "I was not a crybaby!" She protested, though her childhood memories had grown fuzzy with time.

Harrison's laughter rang out, rich and warm. "Oh, but you were. Those big tears could fill an ocean."

Their playful banter continued as they strolled through the campus, their joined hands swinging lightly between them.

Evelyn pointed excitedly. "That was my dorm! And over there's the dining hall. The archives we need are past the gymnasium, near the library."

So engrossed was she in her tour guide role that she failed to notice the curious gaze tracking their progress. The observing woman finally approached with tentative steps.

"Evelyn Carter? Is that truly you?"

Evelyn spun around to face Professor Katherine Whitaker, her former mentor. "Professor Whitaker!" She rushed forward to embrace the older woman. "It's been ages!"

"I thought my eyes were deceiving me," Katherine said, holding Evelyn at arm's length to study her. "You've blossomed into such a striking woman. And married now, I hear?" Her gaze shifted meaningfully to Harrison. "Is this your husband? What a handsome couple you make!"

Before Evelyn could correct the assumption, Harrison smoothly extended his hand. "Harrison Whitmore, at your service, Professor. Please, call me Harrison."
###Chapter 379 Your Eye for Men is Impeccable

The man standing before her was extraordinary in every aspect - his striking features, refined demeanor, and impeccable manners. Katherine couldn't suppress her admiration. "Evelyn, your eye for men is truly impeccable. I can see married life suits you wonderfully."

"Professor Whitaker, actually-"

"We're here to retrieve some of Evelyn's student design projects. The university archives should have records?" Harrison smoothly intercepted Evelyn's response, getting straight to the point.

Katherine brightened immediately. "All student works from their academic years are digitally archived. The records room would have what you need. I'd be happy to escort you there."

"Much appreciated, Professor Whitaker," Harrison replied with polished courtesy.

A wistful expression crossed Katherine's face as she regarded Evelyn. "She was always my brightest pupil - the most naturally gifted designer I've encountered in two decades of teaching."

"I personally recommended her for our accelerated graduate program." She sighed dramatically. "What a shame she chose marriage over that opportunity."

Then her expression softened as she glanced between them. "Though seeing how radiant you look together after all these years, perhaps life's greatest masterpieces aren't always created on drafting tables. Choosing your own happiness is its own form of artistry."

Evelyn's gaze dropped. She'd believed that once too.

She'd thought selecting the life - and man - she wanted was the ultimate act of self-determination. How tragically blind she'd been in those choices.

"Here we are - the archives."

Evelyn lifted her eyes to the heavy oak door before them.

"Fortunately I have clearance," Katherine said, producing a keycard from her designer handbag. The electronic lock beeped green. "After you."

The spacious records room smelled of aged paper and wood polish, its walls lined with filing cabinets and shelves of leather-bound volumes.

Katherine gestured toward the rear section. "Design school archives are stored back there. Paper records are typically purged after three years though - no guarantees what remains."

Evelyn and Harrison began their search in coordinated silence - one working alphabetically from the front, the other from the end. Within minutes, they'd combed through every drawer without finding Evelyn's records.

"If physical copies are gone, we can try the digital database."

Katherine led them to the computer terminals. But when powered on, both screens remained stubbornly black.

"Good heavens! System crash?" Katherine rebooted repeatedly with no success. "Let me call IT support."

Before she could dial, Harrison stepped forward, fingers flying across the keyboard. Within moments, both monitors flickered to life.

"Harrison, you're a wizard!" Katherine gasped.

"Just malware," he dismissed with a modest shrug. "Fairly common in institutional systems."

They accessed the university database, typed "Evelyn Carter," and instantly her entire academic record populated the screen.

"Found it," Evelyn breathed, scrolling through coursework submissions, grades, and even candid campus photos from her undergraduate days.
###Chapter 380 This Isn't My Design

"The photograph came out beautifully," Harrison remarked, his eyes softening as they lingered on the computer screen.

Evelyn smiled wistfully. "I took this on my first day at the institute. My hair was barely tied up—just a messy bun—and I snapped it without thinking."

As she spoke, she scrolled further down, revealing archived records of her academic years—semester grades, critiques, and most importantly, her design portfolio.

But when she clicked into her collection of works, her fingers stilled. The smile faded from her lips.

Harrison noticed the shift immediately. His gaze followed hers to the screen, where several garment designs were displayed.

"What's wrong?"

Evelyn turned to him, disbelief sharp in her voice. "These aren't mine. How did they get here?"

Even Katherine, who had been observing quietly, now focused on them with concern.

She stepped closer, frowning. "The institute's records are meticulously maintained. Errors are rare. Are you certain you didn't submit these?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Absolutely not, Professor Whitaker."

She pointed at the screen. "Look—I never signed my name on my student designs. But these? They all have my signature."

Harrison studied the images. Sure enough, Evelyn Carter was scrawled at the bottom of each sketch.

A silent understanding passed between them. Evelyn wouldn’t misremember her own work. Yet here were designs, falsely attributed to her.

She clicked through the rest, her pulse quickening with each file.

"This can't be right. My graduation collection is missing. None of these are mine."

She clenched her fists. There had to be a mistake.

Katherine’s expression darkened. She pulled up the archive herself, scanning the files with narrowed eyes.

"These lines are amateurish," she muttered, tapping one design. "If you’d turned this in, I would’ve failed you on the spot."

She knew Evelyn’s talent too well. The student she had mentored would never produce something so sloppy.

Evelyn met her gaze, gratitude flickering beneath her distress. "Thank you for believing me, Professor. These aren’t my work."

Katherine gave a firm nod. "I’ll contact the records department immediately."

She strode out, phone already in hand.

Harrison’s jaw tightened. This wasn’t an accident. Someone had tampered with her files.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, steadying herself. "We’ll figure this out."

Then, abruptly, she typed a name into the search bar: Juliette Blackwood.
###Chapter 381 The Revelation

The next moment, Juliette Blackwood's profile materialized on the computer display.

Evelyn Carter's gaze immediately locked onto Juliette's youthful enrollment photo. The differences from her current appearance were subtle yet noticeable - the softness of youth had given way to more defined, mature features.

According to the records, Juliette was actually a year older than Evelyn.

"So it's true," Evelyn whispered under her breath.

Harrison Whitmore leaned closer, his intense stare fixed on the screen, but Evelyn continued scrolling without hesitation.

Her fingers moved swiftly until she reached Juliette's student design portfolio. Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

"How... how can this be?"

The first image displayed was clearly an early version of the boutique's flagship design, though less polished. The similarities were undeniable - it looked like someone had taken this original concept and refined it.

This couldn't possibly be the authentic design!

"There must be some mistake here."

Evelyn's voice held firm conviction as she clicked through several more designs in the same distinctive style. The technical skill evident in these works showed a designer coming into their own.

"Did you create these designs?" Harrison asked.

Evelyn shook her head vehemently. "My initial concepts were completely different. These aren't mine. But the resemblance to my work is uncanny. What's happening here?"

Confusion clouded her features as she spoke.

Just then, Katherine Whitaker returned and immediately noticed Evelyn's distressed expression.

Her eyes flicked to the screen. "Juliette? Evelyn, do you know her?"

Evelyn's eyes narrowed as she pulled Katherine closer. "Professor, are you familiar with her?"

Katherine nodded. "Yes, she graduated a year before you, but wasn't my student. Professor Edmund Whitaker mentored her. Why do you ask? Is there an issue?"

With trembling fingers, Evelyn pointed to the designs on display. "Professor, are these truly her work?"

Katherine looked puzzled but explained, "If they're in her academic file, they should be authentic. Though I'm not particularly familiar with her design aesthetic. You might want to consult Professor Whitaker for more details."

Even Katherine found the situation perplexing.

The archive administrators had assured her that student records were meticulously maintained with minimal room for error.

Yet now, she couldn't explain why Evelyn's file contained designs that clearly weren't hers.

"Is Professor Whitaker available today?"

Katherine considered for a moment. "He should be in his office."

"Could you take us to see him?"

Katherine agreed without hesitation. "Of course, follow me."

Evelyn took a steadying breath, nodded, and closed the file on the computer.

As they prepared to leave, Harrison lingered behind, his gaze lingering on the now-darkened screen, his expression unreadable.

"Evelyn, go ahead. I'll catch up shortly."

Too preoccupied to question his delay, Evelyn followed Katherine out the door.

"Professor Whitaker is nearing retirement. These days he's more passionate about his experimental research than teaching design. He spends most of his time in the lab working on his various projects."

As they walked, Katherine provided detailed insights about Edmund Whitaker - his daily routines, personality quirks, and professional habits.
###Chapter 382 Questioning Reality

The pair arrived at the research facility's entrance. Katherine gestured toward a door on the far right side of the second floor.

"He should be there. Let's move!"

Evelyn followed closely behind. The laboratory door stood slightly ajar. Katherine knocked firmly. "Professor Whitaker? Are you available?"

Silence greeted them.

Pushing the door open, they walked down the dimly lit corridor until reaching its end.

Evelyn's breath caught. A silver-haired man in a white lab coat stood hunched over experiments. His gloved hands precisely pipetted glowing liquid into a glass flask, creating an ethereal blue luminescence.

Edmund paused, recording data with a satisfied smile. Removing his safety goggles, he stepped out of the containment area.

"Katherine! You're interrupting critical work."

But his eyes sparkled with excitement.

"We've made a breakthrough. The new research paper can finally proceed."

His gaze shifted to Evelyn. "And who might this be?"

Evelyn stepped forward confidently. "Professor Whitaker, I'm Evelyn Carter. Former design student from your 2019 cohort."

Recognition flickered across Edmund's face.

"Which year specifically?"

"Class of 2019."

Edmund's expression cleared. "Ah yes, both 2018 and 2019 were exceptional groups. Especially Juliette - graduated a year ahead of you. She's achieved international acclaim now."

Evelyn hadn't expected Juliette's name to surface so quickly. This coincidence emboldened her.

"Professor, may I ask about Juliette?"

Edmund peeled off his gloves, studying her with sudden wariness.

After sipping his water, he spoke slowly. "That girl... came from tragic circumstances. Lost both parents in a horrific accident."

"Dropped out during treatment. But against all odds, she rebuilt her life. Her success brings me immense pride."

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "Are you saying she never actually graduated?"

"Correct. Yet her talent was undeniable. Won the gold at Belron Design Awards during sophomore year - our prestigious inter-school competition."

Evelyn's world tilted.

"The Belron Awards from my freshman year? Juliette won gold?"

Edmund nodded firmly. "Precisely! Shortly after, the accident occurred and she withdrew."

Evelyn's voice dropped to a whisper. "That's impossible... Professor..."

Her hands trembled as she continued. "I won that competition. The trophy and certificate still sit in my parents' home!"

Edmund's bushy eyebrows knitted together.

Adjusting his glasses, his demeanor turned stern.

"Young lady, you must be mistaken."

Evelyn nearly laughed at the absurdity. How could anyone misremember their greatest achievement?

"Professor, with all respect - are you certain Juliette was the winner?"

Edmund's face darkened with offense.

"Child, we documented everything. Videos. Photographs. Shall I retrieve the archives to prove it?"
###Chapter 383 The Truth Will Surface

Edmund Whitaker pulled out his phone with deliberate slowness, accessing his cloud storage with practiced ease.

His fingers danced across the screen until they landed on the timestamp for 2019. With a satisfied nod, he handed the device to Evelyn Carter.

"I served as head judge for that year's design competition. Every moment was documented - videos, photographs, the works."

"Watch the awards ceremony footage. Tell me, who do you see receiving the trophy?"

Evelyn accepted the phone with trembling hands. The video played clearly, showing Juliette Blackwood standing triumphantly on the highest podium as Edmund presented her with the championship award.

Her own image was conspicuously absent.

A cold dread settled in Evelyn's stomach.

This couldn't be right. It made no sense.

Frantically, she scrolled through the participant list. Her name wasn't there. Not even as a contestant.

Yet she remembered every detail - the three grueling elimination rounds, defeating six competitors, that final breathtaking presentation that secured her victory.

"Professor Whitaker, this has to be some mistake..."

Evelyn turned pleading eyes toward Katherine Whitaker, desperate for confirmation of her memories.

But faced with such irrefutable evidence, Katherine could only purse her lips. "Evelyn darling, perhaps you're confusing this with another competition? Maybe you participated in a different year?"

Evelyn shook her head vehemently.

"No. I remember this perfectly." Her voice held steel.

How could she forget? That award had been her first major recognition in the design world.

Edmund and Katherine exchanged worried glances.

Katherine moved closer, placing a comforting hand on Evelyn's arm. "Is everything alright at home, dear?"

Evelyn remained silent, her mind racing.

Edmund continued, "Juliette was one of the most brilliant students I've ever taught. Had tragedy not struck, she could have achieved remarkable things."

The regret in his voice was palpable.

Evelyn felt the walls closing in. Instead of finding validation, she now stood accused of being a fraud.

Then her phone vibrated in her pocket.

The caller ID made her blood run cold. She answered.

"I hear you've returned to Coronia University. How... nostalgic." Juliette's mocking voice dripped through the receiver.

Evelyn's grip tightened on the phone. "You orchestrated this, didn't you?"

Juliette's laughter was like shattered glass. Evelyn's free hand clenched into a fist.

"By now you've seen the evidence for yourself. It only confirms what everyone knows - you stole my work."

"A billion dollars is a small price to pay, really. Pocket change for someone like you. The money isn't what interests me."

"I want to see you humiliated. To watch you squirm."

"Be smart about this. Problems solved with money aren't problems at all. Don't be stubborn."

Evelyn's knuckles turned white. She had to admire Juliette's cunning - the woman had nearly made her doubt her own memories.

But this phone call revealed the truth.

"You can't bury the truth forever, Juliette. Do you really think your lies are that convincing?"
###Chapter 384 My Legend, ShadowStrike

Juliette's mocking laughter echoed through the phone. "Evelyn, you're truly overestimating yourself."

The line went dead with a sharp click.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her phone as the dial tone buzzed in her ear. Her darkening eyes reflected the storm brewing within her.

After a steadying breath, she dialed another number.

"Elliot, do you have a moment?"

For a heartbeat, Elliot thought he'd misheard. He double-checked the caller ID before responding with playful sarcasm. "Evie! To what do I owe this rare honor?"

She huffed in annoyance. "Don't be ridiculous, Elliot!"

His tone shifted to concern. "Alright, what's going on?"

A sly smile curved her lips. "I need a small favor."

"Let's hear it."

"Can you access the database system at Coronia University?"

The line erupted with choking sounds as Elliot nearly inhaled his coffee.

When he recovered, his voice held disbelief. "Evie, are you seriously asking me to hack into a university system?"

"I just need to verify if someone tampered with records."

Evelyn suspected Juliette's hand in manipulating academic records and wanted Elliot's expertise to confirm.

"Let me be clear. The academic records system is a federal-level database with military-grade security. Even elite hackers get caught trying. I couldn't guarantee my own safety attempting it."

Evelyn's brow furrowed at this dead end.

"However..." Elliot's voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "There is one person who could."

Her pulse quickened. "Who? Tell me!"

Elliot's tone became reverent. "My personal legend - ShadowStrike. His skills are beyond human comprehension."

"He's held the top spot on the global hacker rankings for seven years straight. The man's a living myth!"

With wistful admiration, he added, "If I could just witness ShadowStrike's work firsthand, I could die a happy man."

"Elliot, please contact him for me. Money is no object."

A defeated sigh. "It's not about money! Someone like ShadowStrike probably swims in cryptocurrency."

Evelyn bit back her frustration.

"The problem is he's been off-grid for months. Finding him would be like tracking a ghost."

Hope drained from Evelyn's voice. "So it's impossible?"

Elliot hesitated, unaccustomed to hearing such defeat in his sister's voice. "Evie, why do you need this?"

She hesitated before explaining the situation.

"Elliot, if I can't prove this soon, I—"

Before she could finish, Elliot exploded. "This is unacceptable! Do they think the Kingsleys are pushovers? How dare she mess with our family!"

"Evie, don't worry. I'll handle this myself!"

"No, Elliot, you can't—"

He cut her off mid-protest. Despite the cybersecurity risks, determination steeled his voice. "Give me thirty minutes. I'll get you answers."

The line went dead before she could argue further.
###Chapter 385 Contrasting Signatures

Evelyn arched an eyebrow in surprise. "That was lightning fast!"

Little did the siblings know, someone had already outmaneuvered Nathan.

The dim glow of a computer screen illuminated the archive room as fingers flew across the keyboard. Strings of code and numerical sequences scrolled rapidly across the monitor.

Elliot's hands moved with practiced precision. Within ninety seconds, he'd breached the university's firewall. As an afterthought, he patched three security vulnerabilities in their system.

Five minutes later, a satisfied smirk crossed his face as he transferred the harvested data to his encrypted device before logging out.

Not a single digital footprint remained as he exited the room.

...

Meanwhile, Evelyn studied the competition footage on Edmund's phone. After her conversation with Juliette, she'd become convinced of its manipulation.

But she kept her suspicions to herself. "Professor Edmund, could you share this video with me?"

Edmund barely glanced up. "Just download it from the cloud drive."

With murmured thanks, Evelyn saved the file to her device.

Harrison chose that moment to approach.

"Harrison! Can you analyze this for edits?"

Without responding, Harrison plucked the phone from Evelyn's grasp and returned it to Edmund.

"We need to talk."

"About what?"

Instead of answering, Harrison caught Evelyn's wrist. "Come with me."

Baffled but compliant, Evelyn followed.

As they exited the lab, Callum intercepted them, thrusting a thick folder at Harrison with eager anticipation.

"Printed everything you sent. Impressive turnaround, right?"

Harrison gave a curt nod and passed the documents to Evelyn. "Review these."

Evelyn's brow furrowed as she accepted the file. The top sheets held two photographs - one showing a youthful Juliette, the other a recent headshot. Though confused, she remained silent.

Flipping further, she encountered design sketches.

Her confusion deepened. "What am I looking at?"

"Compare the two drawings. Note the discrepancies."

The next page revealed a familiar design from Juliette's portfolio.

Recognition flashed. "This is Juliette's work!"

"Spot anything unusual?"

Evelyn's gaze darted between the pages. The stylistic differences were jarring - every line, every flourish screamed different creators.

"Well?" Harrison prompted.

"These weren't drawn by the same person," Evelyn declared. "The techniques are completely divergent. An artist's signature style doesn't shift this dramatically."

"I accessed Juliette's academic records and the internal servers. Found some... inconsistencies."

"You're saying someone hacked the system?"

"Precisely." Harrison's jaw tightened.

Evelyn's grip crumpled the papers. "I knew it! The records were altered. No wonder Juliette was so confident - she rigged the game from the start!"
###Chapter 386 The Deception Unveiled

Evelyn's breath hitched as she watched Harrison's fingers fly across the keyboard with impossible speed. Even Elliot, her brilliant hacker brother who went by the codename AK, had warned her this system was nearly impenetrable.

Yet Harrison had bypassed all security protocols in minutes. Not only that - he'd retrieved classified files!

"Harrison, how did you—"

Callum cleared his throat sharply from the corner. His jaw clenched as he fought the urge to intervene, knowing any explanation might reveal Harrison's carefully guarded secrets.

Harrison straightened his tie instead of answering. "I've restored your original personnel records. The falsified data has been erased."

A weight lifted from Evelyn's shoulders. Juliette's carefully constructed lies were crumbling.

"But..." Harrison's voice turned grave. "There's no trace of your original design in the archives. The one Juliette claims you plagiarized."

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

"That's impossible," she whispered.

Harrison's expression darkened. "Only one explanation - it was never officially logged into the system."

Her knees nearly buckled. Without that evidence, her reputation remained tarnished. Juliette had exploited this very loophole to destroy her.

Evelyn's nails bit into the documents as her gaze snapped to the two photographs Harrison had uncovered.

"These images," she demanded. "What am I missing?"

Harrison's lips curved. Finally, she'd noticed his real discovery.

"The first is Juliette's original submission five years ago - deleted but recovered. The second is her current portfolio."

Evelyn's mind raced as she compared them. The stylistic differences were staggering.

"These weren't created by the same designer," she realized aloud.

Harrison's approving nod sent chills down her spine.

They'd reached the same terrifying conclusion simultaneously.

"Look closer," Harrison murmured. "Beyond the superficial similarities, there's one immutable difference. Even plastic surgery can't alter this."

Evelyn's pulse pounded as she studied the eyes.

"The eyes are different!"

The first subject's gaze held warmth and clarity. The second's burned with calculated sharpness.

A wild theory took shape in Evelyn's mind.

Harrison voiced it first. "What if the woman we know as Juliette Blackwood...isn't Juliette at all?"

Evelyn's stomach twisted. "Then who the hell is she?"

Harrison's smile didn't reach his eyes. "That's what I intend to find out."

Callum, silent until now, stepped forward. "Harrison, I've traced an address registered to Juliette nearby. We could—"

"Pay her a visit?" Harrison finished, his gaze locking with Evelyn's. "Shall we?"

Their shared glance spoke volumes. This web of lies needed unraveling.

Who was this imposter? And why target Evelyn?

Evelyn squared her shoulders. "Let's go."
###Chapter 387 Fabricated Friendship

The drive from Coronia University to Juliette Blackwood's estate took roughly two hours.

The uneven country roads made for a bumpy ride. Harrison Whitmore spent the journey briefing Evelyn Carter and Callum Blackwood about Juliette's background.

She was the sole heiress of the prestigious Blackwood fortune. The grandeur of the family's mansion became immediately apparent as they pulled up the winding driveway.

The sprawling estate boasted classic Georgian architecture, with manicured hedges framing a rose garden in full bloom. A marble fountain glistened in the afternoon sun.

"We're here," Callum announced, stepping out of the car first.

Harrison gave Evelyn's hand a reassuring squeeze. "Let's take a look."

Evelyn nodded and followed him onto the cobblestone path.

The trio stood before the imposing double doors, examining the well-preserved property.

Callum tilted his head. "Strange. The Blackwoods haven't lived here in years, yet the place looks freshly maintained."

He pressed the antique doorbell.

Moments later, an elderly woman in a starched uniform appeared. Her sharp eyes assessed them through the wrought iron gate. "May I help you?"

Evelyn offered her most charming smile. "Good afternoon. Is this the Blackwood residence?"

The housekeeper's gaze turned wary. "And you are?"

Before Evelyn could respond, Harrison smoothly interjected, "We're Juliette's friends. She asked us to retrieve something for her."

Evelyn shot him a questioning look. Harrison responded with a barely perceptible wink.

The housekeeper's frown deepened. "Miss Juliette's friends?"

"Indeed."

As the woman hesitated, Callum produced his phone with a flourish. "See? She texted us this morning about collecting one of her design portfolios."

The housekeeper's expression softened when she saw the fabricated message thread. She unlatched the gate with sudden enthusiasm.

"Oh my! The young mistress hasn't had visitors in ages! Please, come in!"

Evelyn arched an eyebrow at Callum, who merely smirked in response. Without further explanation, they followed the chatty housekeeper inside.

"I've served the Blackwoods for thirty years," the woman prattled as she led them through a marble foyer. "After the master and mistress passed, I planned to retire. But dear Juliette insisted I stay on as caretaker."

She ushered them into a sunlit parlor filled with antique furniture. "Make yourselves comfortable. I'll prepare some tea."

The moment the housekeeper disappeared, Evelyn whirled on Callum. "What was that text about?"

Callum exchanged an amused glance with Harrison. "Photoshop magic. Nothing to worry about."

"That actually worked?" Evelyn marveled at their audacity.

Harrison leaned closer, his voice dropping. "Focus, Evelyn. We're here to uncover the truth about Juliette."

The clatter of teacups announced the housekeeper's return. Evelyn sprang up to assist.

"Allow me."

"Nonsense, dear," the housekeeper tutted, arranging the porcelain set with practiced ease. "This old bird still knows how to serve proper tea."

As the fragrant steam curled between them, Evelyn studied their hostess with new interest. The game was afoot.
###Chapter 388 Unraveling the Mystery

Evelyn's sharp ears caught the housekeeper's subtle phrasing. She leaned forward slightly. "You must have served the Blackwood family for decades now. That practically makes you part of the family."

The elderly woman nodded, her hands folded neatly in her lap. "I came into Miss Juliette's service when she was just a child. Nearly twenty years now."

A knowing glance passed between Evelyn and Harrison. She pressed gently, "Then you've witnessed Juliette's entire journey!"

The housekeeper's eyes softened with nostalgia.

"Miss Juliette was always such a dutiful child. Never gave Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood a moment's worry."

"Top of her class since primary school. Their pride and joy. She would have been happiest if they were still with us, but..." Her voice caught. "The accident five years ago took them both."

"Miss Juliette survived, but spent nearly two years recovering at St. Mary's Hospital. After that... she was never quite the same."

Harrison's brow furrowed. "Two years hospitalized? And you cared for her throughout?"

The housekeeper's hands trembled slightly. "The trauma changed her. We had no choice but to..." She trailed off abruptly. "Did Miss Juliette send you for her design portfolio?"

Evelyn nodded smoothly. "Yes. We'd be grateful for your assistance."

"Of course," the housekeeper replied, rising. "Though she has countless sketches - which particular collection do you require?"

Evelyn stood quickly. "Let me help you search-"

"No!" The sharpness startled them all. The housekeeper composed herself. "Miss Juliette's studio is strictly off-limits. I'll retrieve them."

Evelyn settled back with a polite smile. "We appreciate it."

The trio waited in tense silence until the housekeeper returned, arms laden with portfolios.

"Her talent was evident even as a girl. Mr. Blackwood always said she'd revolutionize fashion design."

"She's made them proud, even now. See if what you need is here. If not, I'll look further."

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured, spreading the drawings across the coffee table.

Juliette's skill was undeniable - every stroke spoke of mastery. But as Evelyn examined the dates, a pattern emerged: nearly all were pre-accident, bearing that distinctive subtle aesthetic.

The exact style of the original, unaltered designs.

Evelyn's pulse quickened. The car crash five years ago wasn't just tragedy - it was the missing piece.

She fixed the housekeeper with a piercing gaze. "These are all pre-accident works. Where are her recent designs?"
###Chapter 389 The Hidden Truth

The elderly housekeeper sighed deeply. "Ever since Ms. Juliette's accident, she's avoided this place like the plague. Too many painful memories linger here. These are all her earlier creations. Did you locate the specific sketch she mentioned?"

Evelyn's fingers trembled slightly against the drawings. "That's not exactly it," she murmured under her breath.

Pulling out her phone with deliberate slowness, she continued, "I'm uncertain which one she meant. I'll photograph them all for verification."

The housekeeper nodded without suspicion. "Of course, dear. While you're at it, could you inquire if Ms. Juliette plans to visit soon? The manor feels so empty without her."

There was unmistakable longing in the elderly woman's voice.

Evelyn studied the caretaker's weathered face. The woman had clearly devoted her life to this family. Unlike Evelyn's own childhood - though parentless, she'd never wanted for comfort or care under Dominic's protection.

"You watched Juliette grow up. You must share a special bond?"

The housekeeper straightened her apron. "I know my place, miss. Just the hired help."

Her tone brooked no further discussion.

Evelyn focused on photographing the sketches, the camera shutter clicking like a metronome.

"Even as Juliette's closest friends, we barely know her preferences. With her birthday approaching, we're at a loss for gift ideas. You must have suggestions?"

At this, the housekeeper's stern expression softened. She began speaking with unexpected warmth.

"Ms. Juliette was always the sweetest child. The entire Blackwood family adored her. Mr. and Mrs. Blackwood spoiled her rotten, truth be told."

Her fingers traced the edge of a dusty frame. "She showed artistic talent practically from the cradle. By five, her mother enrolled her in prestigious art academies."

The floodgates opened. The housekeeper shared intimate details - Juliette's favorite paints, how she'd sing while working, the way sunlight caught her hair in the conservatory. Each memory was polished with obvious affection.

Then her voice broke. "If only... if only her parents had lived. She'd have remained that radiant girl."

The air grew heavy with unshed tears.

Evelyn bit her lip before pressing forward. "About the accident five years ago... what exactly happened?"

The housekeeper's spine stiffened. "The authorities concluded their investigation years ago. A tragic accident, nothing more. We don't speak of it."

She abruptly changed subjects. "Did you find the sketch?"

Evelyn produced two drawings from the pile. "These match Juliette's description."

Relief washed over the caretaker's face. "Thank heavens! Ms. Juliette will be so relieved. I'll store the others properly now."

"You've been tremendously helpful."

Outside Blackwood Manor, Evelyn's grip on the designs turned white-knuckled. Her silence spoke volumes.

Harrison matched her stride. "This confirms it - Juliette's transformation began with that accident. Everything traces back to that moment."

Callum practically vibrated with excitement as he brandished his phone like Excalibur.

"Harrison! I've dug up the original accident reports. Even better - I know the lead investigator personally. Should we pay him a visit?"

True to form, Callum's phone rang before the words fully left his mouth. He flashed them an apologetic grin. "Duty calls."
###Chapter 390 Uncovering the Secrets

"Callum, we've made headway with that investigation you requested."

A wicked grin spread across Callum's face. "Did you locate the officer in charge?"

"Affirmative. He's currently at the precinct. Shall I arrange a meeting?"

Callum glanced at Evelyn and Harrison, nodding decisively. "We're on our way."

Hanging up, he turned to them. "This visit will bring us closer to the truth."

Evelyn's fingers trembled unexpectedly. A sudden wave of unease washed over her, making her skin prickle with nervous energy.

The sensation lingered until their car pulled up at the police station, where she finally managed to steady her breathing.

Harrison noticed her tension and leaned closer. "Whatever we discover, we'll handle it together."

"Thank you," Evelyn murmured.

From the front seat, Callum smirked at Harrison's uncharacteristic gentleness. Who knew Evelyn could soften the formidable Harrison Whitmore?

"Do you think..." Evelyn hesitated, "this might lead to more questions than answers?"

Harrison squeezed her hand. "The truth often hides in plain sight. What we perceive as obstacles might be illusions."

Just then, the precinct doors swung open.

Chief Tobias Pembroke rushed forward upon recognizing Callum. "Mr. Blackwood! To what do we owe this honor?"

As the son of a prominent political figure, Callum commanded respect even from the highest city officials.

After exchanging pleasantries, Callum made introductions. "Harrison, Evelyn, meet Chief Pembroke."

The chief's demeanor shifted subtly when he noticed Callum's deference to Harrison. This was clearly someone of importance.

"Mr. Whitmore, what a pleasure. How may I assist you today?"

"We're here regarding a vehicular incident," Callum interjected. "I assume you're aware? We'd like to review the case files."

Chief Pembroke's expression turned apologetic. "I'm afraid case files aren't publicly accessible without proper authorization. However, the responding officer is available to speak with you."

Callum's eyes narrowed dangerously. "Chief Pembroke, surely there's flexibility in this matter?"

"Protocols must be followed, Mr. Blackwood. Unless..." The chief trailed off meaningfully.

"You're saying we need official clearance," Callum deduced.

The chief nodded. "My hands are tied otherwise."

Callum's jaw tightened. Normally, securing clearance would be trivial, but his recent falling-out with his father complicated matters.

The thought of swallowing his pride irritated him, yet he couldn't let Harrison and Evelyn down. The dilemma gnawed at him as they stood in the sterile police station lobby.
###Chapter 391 The Reconstructed Face

"Chief Pembroke, you must recognize me. Surely we can bend the rules this once?"

Tobias Pembroke's face twisted in discomfort, his fingers tapping nervously against his desk. "Mr. Blackwood, regulations are regulations."

Callum Blackwood hadn't anticipated such resistance from the police chief. His mouth opened to argue when Harrison Whitmore raised a single gloved hand.

Harrison remained perfectly composed, his voice smooth as aged whiskey. "Perhaps we should speak directly with the investigating officer."

Callum's irritation evaporated instantly. "Very well."

The transformation was so abrupt that Tobias nearly dropped his coffee. His curiosity about Harrison's identity burned brighter than ever.

His demeanor shifted noticeably. "Mr. Whitmore, right this way."

The police station's fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as they entered the designated office. A uniformed officer stood waiting, his posture military-straight.

"Mr. Whitmore, Mr. Blackwood, meet Officer James Whitaker," Tobias introduced.

"Officer Whitaker will brief you on the case details." With a crisp salute, Tobias excused himself, closing the door with deliberate quietness.

James leaned forward, elbows on the scratched metal desk. "The chief mentioned you're inquiring about that five-year-old vehicular incident?"

Harrison's gloves creaked as he folded his hands. "Every detail matters to us, Officer. Hold nothing back."

James nodded, pulling a worn file from his drawer. "This case made headlines back then. Two luxury vehicles collided at high speed, fuel lines ruptured... The resulting fireball claimed three lives instantly."

Evelyn Carter's breath hitched. She'd seen Juliette Blackwood twice now - flawless skin, not a single visible scar.

"How is that possible?" Evelyn blurted. "Severe burns leave marks."

James's smile held no humor. "You're referring to Ms. Juliette. Modern reconstructive surgery works miracles these days."

"Reconstructive surgery?" Callum echoed.

"Full facial grafts," James confirmed. "Third-degree burn victims often undergo complete dermal reconstruction. The technology's advanced tremendously."

So Juliette wasn't just wearing someone else's identity - she was wearing someone else's skin.

But surgical alterations couldn't change fundamental truths - mannerisms, subconscious habits, the way someone held a pen.

Harrison's theory gained terrifying credibility. The woman parading as Juliette Blackwood might be an imposter.

Then where was the real Juliette?

"There were two survivors," James continued, flipping a page. "One being Ms. Juliette Blackwood, heiress to Blackwood Industries - the subject of your inquiry."
###Chapter 392 The DNA Test

Evelyn Carter lifted her gaze to meet Harrison Whitmore's. "You mentioned there were two survivors. Was there someone else besides Juliette Blackwood?"

Harrison gave a slow nod. "Indeed. A young man in his twenties from Pamore."

"Pamore?"

Evelyn's pulse quickened, an inexplicable connection tugging at her. "Could you tell me his name?"

With an apologetic smile, Harrison shook his head. "I'm afraid that information is confidential."

The refusal left Evelyn with a sinking disappointment.

A male survivor from Pamore. Even if he shared her hometown, what connection could he possibly have to Juliette?

Just then, realization dawned on Harrison. "You said there were three fatalities. Besides Juliette's parents, can you share details about the third victim?"

Harrison saw no reason to withhold this information.

"The third victim was also from Pamore - a young woman, likely the man's girlfriend. She sustained severe facial burns, nearly two-thirds of her face destroyed."

"The young man was inconsolable after her death. He even refused medical treatment, but the doctors managed to save him."

A startling possibility took shape in Evelyn's mind.

A car accident. Burns. A young woman. Could these all be mere coincidences?

Evelyn and Harrison exchanged knowing glances, their thoughts clearly aligned.

The pieces were falling into place, the truth emerging from the shadows.

"Do you have any records about the deceased woman?" Evelyn pressed.

Harrison sighed. "She was a foreign national. You'd need to contact her country's embassy. But after all these years, records may be lost."

Disappointment flickered in Evelyn's eyes.

"Mr. Whitmore, any further questions?"

Harrison stepped closer, his gaze steady. "Don't lose heart. We're making progress."

Evelyn met his eyes, her determination hardening. "Harrison, we need to investigate that woman's background. Contact her family. There might be answers there."

She had a theory forming, but it felt too fragile to voice aloud. She needed proof.

"Officer Whitaker," Evelyn asked suddenly, "how can you be certain the survivor is Juliette Blackwood?"

Harrison frowned at the odd question. "Ms. Carter, one doesn't mistake their own identity. We conducted DNA tests on the deceased - the matches were conclusive."

If that were true, none of this made sense.

Harrison extended his hand politely. "Thank you, Officer Whitaker. You've been most helpful."

With a curt nod, Harrison shook his hand. "If that's all, I'll take my leave."

"Callum, please see Officer Whitaker out."

Callum Blackwood quickly gestured toward the door. "Right this way, Officer."

Once they'd left, Evelyn turned to Harrison. "Something's not adding up here."

"What are you thinking?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together before speaking. "My initial thought was that the real Juliette died, and the current Juliette might be that other woman from the accident."

"An identity swap. But Harrison said they did DNA testing."

Which confirmed the survivor was indeed Juliette.

But then... what about those design sketches?
###Chapter 393 The Mysterious Stranger

Evelyn stepped out of the police station, her shoulders slumped in defeat.

Harrison followed silently, offering her a chilled bottle of water. "Here, drink this. You should rest."

She shook her head, golden strands catching the afternoon light. "I need to be alone right now, Harrison."

As she walked away down the tree-lined path, Harrison remained rooted to the spot, his piercing gaze tracking her retreating form.

Callum approached with quick strides. "Aren't you going after her? This neighborhood isn't exactly safe."

"Give her space. We'll follow at a distance."

With that, Harrison began moving, keeping Evelyn in sight while maintaining careful distance. Callum sighed dramatically before falling into step beside him.

"Seriously, Harrison? Years of pining and you're still playing the long game?"

Callum gestured toward Evelyn's disappearing figure. "If you keep hesitating, someone else will sweep her off her feet—"

A single icy glare from Harrison silenced him mid-sentence.

Callum raised his hands in surrender before continuing more thoughtfully. "Just saying, man. Some truths shouldn't stay hidden forever. She deserves to know."

He'd seen the way Evelyn looked at Harrison when she thought no one was watching. This dance of avoidance between them needed to end.

"What's a few more years in the grand scheme?" Harrison's voice softened as he watched Evelyn turn a corner. "As long as she's the one waiting at the finish line."

Callum rolled his eyes. Only Evelyn could melt Harrison's usual cold demeanor into something resembling human warmth. Love truly did strange things to people.

"Did you bring the laptop?"

"In the car," Callum confirmed.

"Get it."

With a signal from Callum, their driver pulled up alongside them. Both men slid into the leather seats.

"Keep watch over her."

Callum nodded. "She won't leave my sight."

Harrison gave a satisfied hum, flipping open the laptop. His fingers flew across the keyboard with practiced precision.

...

Evelyn wandered aimlessly down the sidewalk. Autumn leaves swirled around her in golden eddies, catching in her hair like nature's confetti.

The season had turned while she wasn't looking.

Pedestrians rushed past in their own worlds, oblivious to the woman moving like a ghost through their midst.

Suddenly, a figure barreled toward her. Evelyn's heel caught on uneven pavement, sending her stumbling backward.

Strong arms caught her from behind, spinning her effortlessly into a stranger's embrace. When she looked up, her breath caught.

The man wore a black mask and cap, revealing only intense dark eyes that seemed to peer into her soul.

His voice was low, hypnotic. "Stop digging. Go home."

Evelyn's brow furrowed in confusion. "What—?"

Before she could finish, he released her and melted into the crowd.

"Wait!" Evelyn sprinted after him. "Who are you? What did you mean by that?"

But the mysterious stranger moved with unnatural speed, disappearing at the intersection before she could reach him. When the light changed, he was gone without a trace.
###Chapter 394 Served on a Silver Tray

Evelyn's mind whirled with confusion. Who was this mysterious man?

That faint trace of sandalwood clinging to him felt hauntingly familiar.

Had she encountered that distinctive scent somewhere before?

And what had he meant by those cryptic words?

Could Juliette have sent him? Yet Evelyn sensed no malice in his demeanor.

She scanned the bustling crowd around her, only finding more questions swirling in her mind.

"Evelyn, what happened?"

Callum rushed to her side, slightly out of breath. He'd been alarmed when Evelyn suddenly dashed into the throng, forcing him to abandon his vehicle mid-traffic.

She gripped his forearm tightly. "Did you see that man just now?"

Callum's brows furrowed in confusion.

"What man? Did someone harass you? Point him out - I'll handle it." His posture shifted into protective mode.

But Evelyn shook her head slowly.

"No. Just... a stranger. He looked..."

She struggled to articulate the man's features, realizing she couldn't recall his face clearly despite their proximity.

Callum's sharp gaze swept the area but detected nothing unusual. "Maybe you imagined it?"

"Are you exhausted? Should we return to the car?"

Evelyn bit her lower lip, tension evident in her stiff posture. After a moment's hesitation, she nodded. As she turned, realization struck like lightning.

That scent - identical to her mysterious savior from the underground parking garage in Frenda!

The broad shoulders, the height, that unique sandalwood aroma - it had to be the same person!

Certainty flooded her, but questions remained. Who was he really? And why approach her now with such an ominous warning?

"Evelyn, I've got something." Harrison's voice shattered her reverie.

She blinked up at him. "What is it?"

Harrison handed over his laptop. "Take a look at this."

The screen displayed several photographs that made Evelyn's pulse quicken.

"I've dug into Juliette's background. There's no record of her cosmetic procedures in any Coronian hospital database. She must have purged those records."

"But I discovered something better - your original design featured in Coronia University's public archives months before Juliette's alleged creation."

Relief washed over Evelyn as she pointed at the timestamped image. "This proves it! This is my original sketch from last year!"

Harrison nodded. "They clearly didn't anticipate the university's public server keeping backups of student submissions."

"Harrison, this clears my name completely."

Evelyn snapped a photo with her phone. "I'll send this to Natalie immediately. We'll feature it prominently for a full week."

Joy bubbled up inside her. After weeks of darkness, she'd finally found daylight.

With this evidence, she could demolish the plagiarism accusations against her boutique.

Juliette's billion-dollar extortion scheme would crumble. Her mission to Coronia would succeed.

It felt surreal. She'd arrived drowning in doubts, endured countless obstacles, and now... victory came almost too easily.

A nagging suspicion crept in. "Harrison... is this really everything?"
###Chapter 395 Smoke and Mirrors

Harrison didn't speak. His lips curved into a faint smile, but the subtle tightening of his fingers against his thigh gave away his tension.

His gaze remained fixed on the laptop screen, his darkening eyes reflecting the dim glow of the monitor. These files hadn't been discovered through his own investigation. Someone had deliberately planted them in his system.

The sender's skills matched his own, leaving no digital fingerprints behind. Even after tracing the IP, he'd only hit a dead end - a cleverly disguised virtual address.

"Evelyn," Harrison said abruptly, "we're leaving tonight."

The timing was too convenient. Whoever sent this evidence wanted them out of Coronia immediately. That alone told him this conspiracy ran deeper than they'd imagined.

Evelyn mirrored his suspicion. After hitting wall after wall in their investigation, these files had fallen into their laps like manna from heaven.

"Harrison, this feels staged," Evelyn murmured, her sharp intuition kicking in.

A proud smile tugged at Harrison's lips. She never missed a beat.

Their eyes met in silent understanding before Evelyn nodded. "Alright. Let's get packed."

Callum had arranged their private jet for that evening. But at the last moment, Harrison changed the plan.

"Book us commercial tickets instead."

Callum frowned. "The jet's safer and more discreet. Why risk airport security?"

"Just do it," Harrison insisted. "Next available flight out."

Though confused, Callum complied. But Evelyn and Harrison had no intention of boarding that plane.

"Harrison, Evelyn, what's the game here?" Callum demanded, running a hand through his hair in frustration.

Harrison remained silent, letting Evelyn answer with a cryptic smile. "Ever read Sun Tzu's 'The Art of War'?"

Callum blinked. "What's that got to do with anything?"

Evelyn sighed dramatically. "Read it sometime. Might help you connect the dots."

"Harrison?" Callum turned to his friend helplessly.

Harrison merely checked his watch. "It's late, Evelyn. We should rest."

"Agreed."

They left Callum sputtering in the hallway. His angry shout followed them down the corridor. "Someone get in here!"

His assistant came running. "Mr. Blackwood?"

"'The Art of War' - find me a copy now! I'll be damned if I can't figure this out."

The assistant hesitated. "Sir... we don't have that in our library."

"What? How is that possible?"

"I could order it, sir. But international shipping would take two weeks minimum."

Callum kicked a nearby chair in frustration. "Useless! Can't even get a damn book when I need one!"

Evelyn's laughter mingled with Harrison's as they walked away. She turned to study Harrison's profile.

"Whoever's pulling these strings," she mused, "why are they so desperate to keep us from the truth? What are they hiding?"
###Chapter 396 Who Are You

Harrison's lips curved into a gentle smile as his fingers intertwined tighter with Evelyn's.

"I'm intrigued by that as well. But remember, even the cleverest fox can't hide its tail forever."

Meanwhile...

Juliette reclined on a plush beach chair in Pamore, basking in the golden sunlight. A crystal ss of champagne dangled carelessly between her manicured fingers.

"Mr. Sterling, why so serious?" She purred, tilting her head. "Come, join me for a drink."

Nathan's piercing gaze swept over her unfamiliar face, yet something about her sent an odd ripple of recognition through him.

"Name your price." His voice was ice.

Juliette's lips twisted into a smirk as she arched one perfectly sculpted brow.

"How delightfully direct. But tell me, Nathan - why seek me out now? What possible business could you have with me?" She took a slow sip. "As I recall, you and Evelyn divorced ages ago."

Nathan had no patience for games. His sole purpose was to make this woman retract her baseless usations against Evelyn.

"This matter concerns only Evelyn and myself. It's none of your affair."

He produced a nk check, sliding it across the table. "Write any figure you desire."

Juliette's laughter tinkled like broken glass. She pushed the check away without glancing at it.

"My, my. Are you always this generous with your women, Mr. Sterling?" Her eyes gleamed. "Tell me - is your ex-wife truly worth such extravagance? Keep your money. I've no interest in it."

Nathan's jaw tightened. "No interest? Yet you demand a billion from Evelyn. It seems you don't despise money - just mine."

Rising gracefully, Juliette closed the distance between them until Nathan's distinctive cologne enveloped her senses.

After all these years, the man still radiated that irresistible magnetism. No wonder women fell like dominoes before him.

"Money is such a vulgar topic," she murmured, tracing a finger down his lapel. "Let's discuss something more... stimulating."

Nathan jerked back, snatching the check away. "What do you want then?"

Juliette stepped closer, stopping mere inches away. Tilting her head up, she flashed a predatory smile. "I've always been... fascinated by you."

As she leaned in to brush her lips against his cheek, Nathan shoved her away violently, his expression darkening.

"Control yourself, Ms. Blackwood."

Juliette's laughter rang out across the beach. "Who are you saving your virtue for? Evelyn?" Her smile turned venomous. "You made promises once. Promises you broke."

Confusion flickered in Nathan's eyes. Her words made no sense.

But Juliette offered no exination.

"Nothing will stop me from making Evelyn pay - not even you." Her voice dripped with venomous certainty, eyes blazing with decades-old hatred.

For a fleeting moment, Nathan felt an eerie sense of déjà vu. The woman before him moved and spoke like someone from his past.

"Who are you?" He demanded.

Juliette smoothed her dress, her mask of composure sliding back into place.

She smiled enigmatically. "What do you think, Mr. Sterling?"
###Chapter 397 A Change in Attitude

Nathan shook his head violently. His temples throbbed with the beginnings of a migraine.

"Ms. Blackwood," he said through gritted teeth, "your motives mean nothing to me. Just one thing matters."

His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Harm one hair on Evelyn's head, and you'll regret it."

Juliette threw back her head and laughed, the sound echoing unnaturally in the spacious office. "Too late for warnings, darling. Unless—"

Her manicured finger traced the edge of Nathan's desk as she circled him like a predator. "Unless you make me Mrs. Sterling. Then perhaps I'll reconsider my plans for your precious Evelyn."

Nathan's fist slammed onto the mahogany surface. "You think you can blackmail me?"

The temperature in the room seemed to drop as Simon stepped forward silently, placing a thick dossier before Juliette.

"I wanted to handle this civilly," Nathan said, his voice glacial. "But clearly you've left me no choice. These documents make for... interesting reading."

Juliette's perfectly sculpted eyebrows knitted together as she flipped through the pages. Her confident smirk dissolved into horrified recognition.

"How?" Her voice cracked. "These records were sealed!"

Nathan leaned forward, his shadow engulfing her. "The pot calling the kettle black, Juliette. This evidence proves you framed Evelyn and could destroy your fashion empire overnight."

He tapped the damning documents. "Walk away now, or I release everything to the press."

Juliette should have been trembling. Instead, she smiled and tucked a strand of platinum hair behind her ear with deliberate calm.

"Mr. Sterling," she purred, "let's discuss this privately."

"Save your breath for your lawyer," Nathan snapped.

Undeterred, Juliette glided closer. "Hear me out first. If you still want to ruin me afterward, I'll surrender without a fight."

Before Nathan could protest, she stood on tiptoe and whispered something in his ear.

The color drained from Nathan's face. His hands, usually so steady, trembled slightly as he stared at Juliette with undisguised shock.

Juliette's crimson lips curved in triumph. "Now, if you'll hand over those documents?" She held out her hand expectantly.

Simon moved to intervene, but Nathan's sharp command stopped him. "Give them to her."

"Sir?" Simon's confusion was palpable. "What about Ms. Carter?"

Nathan's jaw clenched. "I said give her everything."

With obvious reluctance, Simon produced a flash drive and surrendered both it and the dossier to Juliette.

"Pleasure doing business with you." Juliette's smile was all sharp edges as she tucked her prize into her designer handbag. "You may go now."

Nathan's gaze burned into her for a long moment before he turned sharply on his heel. Simon scrambled to follow his retreating form, questions visibly bubbling behind his lips.

The elevator doors closed on Juliette's victorious smirk.
###Chapter 398 A Crushing Revelation

"Mr. Sterling, what's happening?" Simon's voice cut through the tense silence. "I thought we were helping Ms. Carter. Why are we leaving now?"

Nathan remained silent, his jaw clenched tight.

"Sir?" Simon pressed again, confusion evident in his tone.

Nathan finally spoke, his voice hollow. "Let's return to the city, Simon."

Simon hesitated but nodded obediently.

The change in Nathan was startling. Just hours ago, he'd been determined to fight for Evelyn's justice. Now he looked like a man who'd received a devastating blow.

As they walked toward the car, Nathan suddenly stopped. "Has Evelyn returned from Coronia yet?"

Simon checked his phone. "No, sir. Ms. Carter is still there."

Nathan's expression darkened. "Book us the next flight to Coronia."

Though bewildered, Simon immediately pulled out his phone. "Right away, Mr. Sterling."

———

Two days had passed with no new leads for Evelyn and Harrison. Their investigation had hit a wall - their target had gone deeper underground, leaving no digital footprints.

Evelyn couldn't shake the eerie feeling that someone was feeding their adversary information. It was as if this person knew exactly when they weren't in Pamore.

Just then, Callum burst into the room with news. "Harrison! I tracked down the clinic where Juliette had her reconstructive surgeries."

Evelyn's eyes lit up. "Where?"

Callum handed over a thick medical file. "Juliette was clever. She never used her real name, which explains why we hit dead ends before."

He flipped through the pages. "Records show over twenty procedures - four major skin grafts and multiple facial reconstructions of varying complexity."

Harrison scanned the documents before passing them to Evelyn. "Look closely, Evelyn. See anything unusual?"

Evelyn's fingers froze on a particular page. The name listed wasn't Juliette Blackwood.

"Anna?" She frowned. "She used an alias?"

Callum shrugged. "Appears so. Every record shows this 'Anna' identity. And..." He hesitated. "There are before-and-after photos included."

He exhaled sharply. "The burns were catastrophic. Nearly half her face was destroyed. The fact she looks human now is nothing short of miraculous."

Evelyn turned to the photo section. The images showed a woman's face horrifically disfigured by fire damage. As Callum said, the burns covered nearly half her facial tissue, rendering her features unrecognizable. Her arms bore similar scarring.

"No wonder she went to such lengths," Evelyn murmured. Neither skin grafts nor reconstructive surgery were pleasant experiences.

"But here's what puzzles me," Callum added. "Is it even possible to restore one's original appearance completely without any scarring?"
###Chapter 399 The Blood Type Discrepancy

Harrison and Callum exchanged knowing glances. "Even with the most advanced plastic surgery techniques, severe burn scars can never be completely erased," Harrison stated matter-of-factly.

Evelyn nodded in agreement, her fingers tracing the edge of the medical report. She'd seen enough trauma cases to know the limitations of modern medicine.

"There's something else," she murmured, tapping a specific line in the document.

Callum leaned forward. "What is it?"

A knowing smile played on Evelyn's lips. "The blood types don't match. Juliette's university medical records show type B, but this report lists O."

Callum's eyebrows shot up. "Could be a hospital error?"

Evelyn shook her head firmly. "Too coincidental to be a mistake."

Her suspicions deepened like shadows at dusk.

"Harrison," she said slowly, "I'm beginning to think the woman we're dealing with isn't the real Juliette at all."

The stylistic differences in design had been the first red flag. Now this blood type discrepancy confirmed her theory - they were dealing with two distinct individuals.

Where was the real Juliette? And who was this imposter?

"We should investigate Juliette's past," Evelyn suggested suddenly. "Find out who her close associates were five years ago."

She suspected the car accident had been the pivotal moment when the switch occurred.

Someone was actively obstructing their investigation. An accomplice, perhaps?

What was their endgame?

Harrison gave a curt nod. "Callum, make it happen."

"On it," Callum replied before striding out of the room.

Left alone with her thoughts, Evelyn felt like she was navigating a labyrinth with no exit in sight.

Harrison moved beside her, offering a sandwich. "Eve, eat something."

She waved it away. "Not hungry."

Without another word, Harrison took her hand in his. His touch grounded her. "I've got you."

Evelyn met his steady gaze, feeling some of the tension leave her shoulders. She managed a small smile.

"I know, Harrison."

Her phone's sudden ringing made her jump. The caller ID showed Nathan Sterling's name.

"Mr. Sterling?" she answered cautiously.

Nathan had just landed in Coronia, the city's gloomy skyline matching his mood. "Evelyn, are you alright?"

The question caught her off guard. Since when did Nathan Sterling care about her wellbeing?

"Your concern is misplaced, Mr. Sterling. I'm perfectly fine."

"I'm in Coronia," he said simply.

Those three words sent her heart racing. Her fingers clenched around the phone as memories came flooding back.

How could she forget? This city held her first memories of Nathan.

"Evelyn, I need to see you," Nathan pressed.

Her response was ice. "I don't have time for this."

She was about to hang up when his next words stopped her cold. "You're investigating Juliette Blackwood."

It wasn't a question. He already knew.

Evelyn didn't bother denying it. "Always well-informed, Mr. Sterling. But this doesn't concern you."

Nathan's voice turned urgent. "That's exactly why I'm here. We need to talk about this."
###Chapter 400 Cease the Inquiry

Evelyn hesitated. Nathan's unexpected proposition was too intriguing to dismiss outright. He must have uncovered something significant to seek her out like this.

She didn't respond immediately, instead glancing at Harrison for silent counsel.

After a beat, she finally said, "I'll text you the address."

"Understood."

As she ended the call, Evelyn opened her mouth to explain, but Harrison anticipated her thoughts.

"Do what feels right, Evie."

His unexpected support made her blink before nodding gratefully.

—

Within the hour, Nathan arrived. His eyes sparked with something unreadable when they landed on Evelyn.

Simon, trailing behind, greeted her first. "Ms. Carter!"

"Simon, long time." Her unchanged warmth surprised the assistant. Despite her elevated status now, she treated him with the same respect as before.

That simple decency touched him more than he'd admit.

Evelyn gestured politely. "Mr. Sterling, please sit." The formality created an invisible chasm between them.

Nathan's brows knitted at the sudden distance.

Cutting through the tension, Evelyn asked directly, "You didn't come all this way for pleasantries. State your business."

Nathan exhaled sharply before asking, "What have you discovered about Juliette in your investigation?"

Evelyn averted her gaze, letting silence stretch between them.

"Evelyn," Nathan continued, voice uncharacteristically soft, "I need you to stop digging into this."

Her head snapped up in disbelief.

"Are you hearing yourself?"

"I know you're innocent of copying her designs. But continuing this investigation will only hurt you. Let me help clear your name another way."

A humorless laugh escaped her lips. "Is that why you're here? To plead Juliette's case?"

"No, I just—"

She cut him off sharply. "Since when are you and Juliette so close that you'd intervene for her?"

The realization struck her suddenly—there were secrets between them. Perhaps Nathan knew more than he let on.

"Nathan," she pressed, "what aren't you telling me?"

With a sharp gesture, Nathan dismissed Simon, who retreated discreetly.

"Some truths are complicated, Evelyn. Just trust me on this—drop the investigation."

Her lips curled into a cold smile as she retreated into memories. After a weighted pause, she finally spoke. "Do you know why I clung to you all those years?"

Nathan leaned forward, eyes alight with desperate curiosity.

Evelyn studied her hands with bitter amusement. "The irony isn't lost on me. After everything, I'm back in this city. But you... you're not the man I remember."

Nathan's fists clenched silently at his sides.

After a beat, he managed a strained smile. "What was I like then?"
###Chapter 401 Nothing Between Us

Nathan could sense the immediate shift in the air when he posed that question.

Evelyn's gaze grew distant, lost in thought before finally snapping back to reality. "It's been too long," she murmured. "I can't recall."

A flicker of disappointment crossed Nathan's piercing blue eyes. "Is it truly forgotten? Or are you deliberately choosing not to remember?"

The corner of Evelyn's lips curved into a sardonic smile as she met his gaze. "Mr. Sterling, while we're being honest - what exactly is your relationship with Juliette?"

"Would it matter if I told you there's nothing between us?" Nathan's voice held a rare note of self-deprecation. The mighty CEO had never stooped so low before.

"Evelyn," he continued, his tone turning grave, "if you insist on digging deeper into this investigation, you must understand the risks. I'm warning you for your own protection."

"Nathan, that's rich," Evelyn scoffed. "You're justifying your irrational behavior as protection? Or do you genuinely believe you're acting in my best interest?"

"That's not—"

Nathan began, but the words died in his throat. No excuse came to mind.

He reached out, his voice uncharacteristically pleading. "Evelyn, just this once, listen to me."

Before Evelyn could respond, Harrison's voice cut through the tension.

"Evelyn," he called, stepping to her side with confident strides.

Callum followed closely behind, flashing Nathan a polite yet guarded smile. "Mr. Sterling of Sterling Enterprises, isn't it? Your reputation precedes you."

Nathan's gaze flickered between them, his lips twisting into a cold smirk. "Mr. Blackwood. It's been a while."

Callum had heard enough about Nathan's history with Evelyn to form unfavorable opinions, though he couldn't deny the man's formidable reputation in business circles.

"Mr. Sterling, the pleasure is mine," Callum said smoothly. "Might I ask what brings you to this conversation with Evelyn?"

Nathan ignored the question, his icy stare fixed on Evelyn. "Are you two involved?" The temperature seemed to drop several degrees with his blunt inquiry.

"Nathan, my personal life is none of your concern," Evelyn said coolly. "If that's all, I suggest you leave."

Callum stepped in diplomatically. "Mr. Sterling, sometimes it's best to leave the past where it belongs. People move on - it's the natural order of things."

The implication hung heavy in the air - whatever existed between Nathan and Evelyn was history, while Harrison represented her future.

"Is that how you see it too, Evelyn?" Nathan pressed.

Evelyn's silence spoke volumes.

Seizing the moment, Harrison took Evelyn's hand. "We have urgent matters to attend to," he told Nathan with polite finality. "If you'll excuse us."

Nathan's jaw tightened as he watched them walk away, his unanswered question lingering like the aftershock of an earthquake.
###Chapter 402 Revelation

Harrison Whitmore departed with Evelyn Carter without waiting for Nathan Sterling's response. In an instant, Nathan found himself standing alone in the cavernous lobby.

He resembled a solitary vessel adrift on endless waters, still searching for his true course.

After what felt like an eternity, Simon approached cautiously. "Mr. Sterling, are you quite alright?"

Nathan's distant gaze sharpened as he spoke slowly. "Simon... tell me honestly. What was I like before?"

The secretary pressed his lips together. "Sir, are you thinking about Ms. Carter again?"

Having served as Nathan's personal assistant for years, Simon had witnessed every interaction between Evelyn and his employer over the past three years.

Though he hadn't known Evelyn's true identity initially, their daily exchanges revealed Nathan treated her differently from all others.

The irony was Nathan himself remained oblivious to this fact.

"Mr. Sterling, you've always shown Ms. Carter special consideration. Yet even now, you don't fully understand why."

Simon's words plunged Nathan into deeper contemplation.

The assistant sighed quietly. Outsiders always saw the truth more clearly!

——

Evelyn rode away with Harrison.

The moment their car doors closed, Evelyn turned eagerly to Callum Blackwood. "What did you discover?"

Callum deferred to Harrison. "All the information has been transferred to Mr. Whitmore. He can explain better."

Evelyn's brow furrowed as she faced Harrison. "What's this about?"

Harrison produced a dossier. "You asked Callum to investigate Juliette Blackwood's connections. He found someone significant."

"Who?"

"Juliette's childhood friend, Adelaide Montgomery. They were inseparable - practically sisters."

Evelyn flipped through the documents, her eyes catching on a photograph of a young woman.

"The strange part? They severed all contact after that car accident five years ago." Harrison pointed to a crucial detail. "She's a single mother now, running a bookstore near Coronia University."

Evelyn nodded decisively. "Let's meet her."

She needed to understand Juliette's past. What could have driven such close friends apart?

There had to be more to their sudden estrangement.

Their vehicle glided smoothly toward the university district. Callum drove with precision, bringing them to a perfect stop before a quaint storefront.

"We're here," he announced.

Exchanging glances, Evelyn and Harrison stepped into the charming bookstore. The interior boasted vintage decor with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and an adjacent coffee bar.

"Welcome," called a voice. "What can I get you?"

Evelyn immediately recognized Adelaide from the photograph - Juliette's closest confidante.

Noticing new customers, Adelaide launched into her standard introduction. "We carry an extensive collection. If you can't find something, just ask - I'll check our database."
###Chapter 403 Best Friend

Evelyn tilted her chin slightly and stepped forward. "Pardon me, you're Adelaide Montgomery, correct?"

Adelaide's eyes widened in surprise.

Her posture immediately became defensive as she glanced between Evelyn and Harrison standing beside her. After a tense moment, she demanded, "How do you know me?"

"Ms. Montgomery, we only know of you through Juliette's mentions. We happened to be in the neighborhood and wanted to meet you."

At Juliette's name, Adelaide visibly flinched.

A shadow of discomfort flickered across her face before she asked hesitantly, "Juliette? You know Juliette?"

Evelyn nodded.

Adelaide let out a bitter laugh, her tone turning sharp. "That's impossible. Juliette and I were childhood friends - she never once spoke of you people."

"Tell me the truth! Did that bastard Enrico Delvecchio send you? Well, you can tell him my son belongs to me alone!"

"If you think you can take my child from me, you're delusional! And using Juliette's name? That's the worst cover story I've ever heard. Get out!"

As she spoke, Adelaide grabbed a nearby broom, brandishing it like a weapon.

Evelyn's mouth fell open in shock. "Ms. Montgomery, you've got this all wrong! We don't even know who this Enrico person is-"

Adelaide wasn't listening.

"Save your lies! Tell Enrico if he wants custody, he'll have to go through proper legal channels. I'll see him in court!"

Evelyn looked completely bewildered. What kind of mess had they walked into?

Harrison moved first, positioning himself between Evelyn and Adelaide's swinging broom.

"Ms. Montgomery, please listen. There's been a misunderstanding. We came to discuss Ms. Juliette. As for your custody battle with Mr. Delvecchio... I may be able to assist you."

Adelaide froze mid-swing. She studied Harrison with wary hope. "You... you can help me?"

Harrison nodded. "I can connect you with the top family law attorney in the city."

Adelaide's eyes lit up. "You're serious?"

Harrison gave a firm nod. "But first, you'll need to put down the broom."

The broom clattered to the floor immediately. "My apologies for earlier," Adelaide muttered.

Harrison exhaled and exchanged a glance with Evelyn.

Understanding his cue, Evelyn spoke gently. "Ms. Montgomery, we can help with your legal situation, but we need some information in return."

Adelaide considered this for a long moment before gesturing toward the interior. "Come inside then."

She turned on her heel and disappeared into the house. Evelyn and Harrison shared a look before following.

Adelaide poured tea with shaking hands and cut straight to the point. "What do you want to know?"

Evelyn didn't mince words either. "Ms. Montgomery, you and Juliette were inseparable, weren't you? We need to understand why that friendship ended so abruptly."

Adelaide's entire body went rigid. Her eyes narrowed as she studied Evelyn with new suspicion.

She never discussed personal matters with strangers. The fact that Evelyn knew these intimate details set off every alarm in her mind.
###Chapter 404 The Cold Shoulder

Adelaide's gaze drifted away for a heartbeat before snapping back. "Why does this matter to you? Friends drift apart all the time."

Evelyn leaned forward. "But childhood friends share bonds deeper than most. Something significant must have severed that connection."

A humorless smile touched Adelaide's lips. "You're imagining drama where none exists. Our lives simply took different paths."

She gestured around the modest bookstore. "Look at me - a single mother betrayed by a worthless man, barely keeping this place afloat. And her? An internationally celebrated designer living in a different universe."

"What's the point of digging up ancient history?" Adelaide's voice carried finality.

Evelyn studied her carefully. "Is that truly all there is to it?"

"Why would I lie?" Adelaide's expression remained unreadable. Then her eyes narrowed. "Your questions aren't casual. What's your real purpose here?"

Evelyn exhaled. "Ms. Montgomery, I'll be frank. We suspect the Juliette Blackwood we know isn't the real Juliette. Someone has taken her place."

Adelaide's teacup clattered against its saucer. "That's absurd! People don't get replaced like characters in some spy thriller!"

"The evidence suggests otherwise," Evelyn countered. "Blood types don't change. Design aesthetics don't transform overnight."

Adelaide's fingers tightened around her cup. "What exactly are you implying?"

"Five years ago," Evelyn pressed, "Juliette suffered horrific facial injuries in that accident. Afterward, her entire personality changed, and she cut ties with you. Doesn't that strike you as...convenient?"

Adelaide turned toward the window. "Trauma changes people. There's nothing suspicious about that."

"Then prove me wrong," Evelyn challenged. "Call her right now. Ask about a secret only the two of you shared. See if she remembers."

Adelaide stood abruptly. "This is ridiculous! I won't participate in your paranoid fantasy!" Her voice shook with unexpected vehemence. "If you have no further business here, I'll ask you to leave."

Harrison stepped forward. "One phone call could settle this, Ms. Montgomery. Surely that's not too much to ask?"

Adelaide's laugh held no humor. "There's nothing to settle! I haven't spoken to her in years - barging into her life with insane accusations?" She shook her head. "I appreciate your legal help with my custody battle, but this conversation is over."

Her hands trembled as she gathered their teacups, the unspoken message clear: they'd crossed a line she wouldn't permit. The past, whatever it held, would remain buried.
###Chapter 405 Autistic

Evelyn's brow furrowed. Were they seriously going to back down now? Not on her watch!

Then something small moved in her peripheral vision.

A little boy crouched in the corner, fingers flying over a Rubik's cube with startling precision. The colored squares blurred under his touch. In under thirty seconds, the puzzle clicked into perfect alignment.

Evelyn approached cautiously. "Ms. Montgomery, is this your son?"

Adelaide's protective instincts flared. She rushed forward, blocking Evelyn's path. "Stay away from him! I swear I'll tear apart anyone who tries to hurt my baby!"

Evelyn recoiled from the sudden ferocity.

"It's not like that," she explained quickly. "I noticed his incredible skill with the cube. Most children his age couldn't possibly manipulate it that fast. The way he solved it... that's not normal development."

"You're saying... he's gifted?" Adelaide's grip on Evelyn's arm trembled. For the first time in years, hope flickered in her eyes.

Evelyn nodded firmly. "Absolutely! A standard 3x3 cube would challenge most three-year-olds. But he handled a 12x12 like it was nothing. That's extraordinary cognitive ability."

Tears welled up in Adelaide's eyes. "All the specialists... they keep telling me he's autistic. That he's... broken. You're the first person who's ever called him smart."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn. "They diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder?"

Adelaide nodded miserably. "Since birth. He's three now but still nonverbal. Doesn't respond to his name. Just... lives in his own world."

The mother's voice cracked as she gazed at her son. "No matter what it takes, I'll find a way to reach him."

Evelyn studied the quiet child. She grabbed nearby building blocks and arranged them into a distinct pattern. "You're Reginald, aren't you?"

The boy's bright eyes flickered toward her, but he remained silent.

"Reginald," Evelyn said carefully, "I think you're very clever. Can you show me how to move just two blocks without changing this shape?"

For a long moment, the child stared at the pattern. Then with startling certainty, he adjusted exactly two blocks. The original shape remained perfectly intact.

Adelaide gasped. "How... Reginald, do you understand us?" She crushed him in a tearful embrace.

Evelyn's theory confirmed itself. "There's nothing wrong with his intelligence. If anything, he's operating at a level beyond most children his age."

She met the boy's gaze. "With proper support, he'll learn to communicate. I'm certain of it."

As if to prove her point, Reginald's lips curved in the faintest smile. His small hand reached out and grasped Evelyn's fingers, eyes shining with unspoken understanding.
###Chapter 406 The Revelation

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat as she witnessed the impossible scene before her. Was this truly Reginald, the boy who had always retreated into his own silent world?

The child who shunned all human contact now stood before her, engaged and responsive.

Adelaide Montgomery's hands trembled as she pressed them to her mouth. Never in all these years had her son shown such progress with anyone.

Then her tear-filled gaze found Evelyn.

The younger woman squeezed Reginald's small hand gently. "You're doing wonderfully, sweetheart. So brave today."

Reginald nodded, his dark eyes shining with uncharacteristic clarity.

Adelaide felt her knees weaken. Twenty specialists over five years had failed where this stranger succeeded in mere minutes.

"Bless you," she whispered hoarsely. "I don't know how to thank you enough."

Evelyn gave a small shake of her head. "He's perfect just as he is. The world needs to learn his language, not the other way around."

Though their questions about Juliette remained unanswered, Harrison Whitmore exchanged a meaningful look with Evelyn. This breakthrough alone made their visit worthwhile.

"We should be going," Harrison said, offering Adelaide a respectful nod. "Thank you for your time today."

They had just reached the bookstore's antique door when frantic footsteps echoed behind them.

"Wait! Please!"

Adelaide's fingers clutched Evelyn's sleeve desperately. "You were right," she gasped. "The woman calling herself Juliette Blackwood is an imposter."

Evelyn's pulse spiked. Though she'd suspected as much, hearing the confirmation still sent shockwaves through her.

Adelaide glanced nervously around the empty shop. "Not here. Come with me - I'll show you the truth."

Harrison's protective hand found the small of Evelyn's back as they followed Adelaide outside. The older woman locked up quickly, leaving instructions with her staff before leading them to a waiting car.

During the drive through the city's outskirts, Evelyn's curiosity burned. "Where exactly are we going, Adelaide?"

"Somewhere the truth has been waiting five years," came the cryptic reply.

When the car finally stopped, Evelyn's stomach dropped. The wrought iron gates ahead bore a single word in elegant script: Elysium.

"A cemetery?" Evelyn's voice wavered.

Adelaide stepped out without answering, her black coat fluttering like raven's wings in the autumn wind. They followed her down winding paths between marble monuments until she stopped abruptly before a modest headstone.

With trembling hands, Adelaide brushed away fallen leaves to reveal the inscription:

Danielle Delaney
Beloved Daughter & Friend
1990-2018

"The real Juliette died in that car crash five years ago," Adelaide whispered. "The woman you know is someone else entirely."

Evelyn's mind reeled. All the pieces clicked into horrifying place - the inexplicable hostility, the stolen designs, the carefully constructed lies.

"Then who," Evelyn demanded, her voice steel, "is pretending to be Juliette Blackwood?"
###Chapter 407 Death Certificate

Evelyn gasped in shock, but quickly composed herself with a shake of her head.

Her gaze fell upon the photograph embedded in the tombstone. "I don't recognize her."

Adelaide's face fell at the response.

"There's something else," Evelyn continued, her voice steady. "I can prove she's an imposter."

Hope flickered in Adelaide's eyes. Without hesitation, Evelyn knelt before the grave, her fingers tracing the weathered bricks.

She pressed against the rightmost stone until it shifted, revealing a hidden compartment.

From within, she withdrew a bundle of yellowed documents.

"Here's the accident report, Juliette's death certificate, and..." Evelyn's voice caught slightly, "her most prized design sketches."

Harrison and Dominic exchanged meaningful glances before accepting the papers.

Adelaide took a steadying breath before unfolding them.

"The fire left Juliette with third-degree burns over eighty percent of her body. Losing both parents in that crash... it broke her spirit."

"Despite the medical team's efforts, she never regained consciousness."

A heavy silence descended.

Dominic examined the hospital records with growing unease. "Then when did this impostor take her place?" His mind raced with possibilities.

Evelyn unlocked her phone with swift movements, pulling up a video. "This is her first public appearance. The timestamp shows it was exactly five years ago."

Five years?

Dominic's eyebrows shot up.

His memories of that period were hazy - back when he'd been studying at Coronia University. What possible connection could there be?

Beside them, Harrison's voice cut through the silence. "This was no spur-of-the-moment scheme. Someone invested serious time and resources into this deception."

Evelyn frowned. "Harrison, what could they possibly want?"

"Think carefully, Evelyn. Any enemies? Business rivals your family might have crossed?"

The realization struck like lightning.

As one of Frenda's most powerful families controlling global financial currents, the Kingsleys had made countless adversaries.

But to plot for five years? This went beyond corporate rivalry.

"I'll have Elliot investigate this thoroughly. We've already uncovered two crucial pieces of evidence here."

"First proof that clears you of plagiarism allegations. Second, definitive evidence that Juliette Blackwood is an impostor."

"As for her true identity..." Harrison's eyes gleamed with determination. "Let's make her reveal herself."

The plan crystallized in Evelyn's mind. "We'll start surveillance immediately. Track her every move."

Just then, her phone vibrated. A cold smile curved her lips as she checked the caller ID. "Speak of the devil."

Harrison's grip tightened around her free hand. "Answer it. Let's hear what she has to say."

Evelyn tapped the screen, and Juliette's honeyed voice filled the air between them.
###Chapter 408 The Gauntlet Thrown

"Evelyn, the deadline approaches. Do you have the billion dors ready?" Juliette's voice dripped with mock concern through the phone.

Evelyn exhaled sharply through her nose. "Why the urgency, Ms. Blackwood? A mere billion dors shouldn't trouble someone of your... caliber."

Amused laughter crackled through the receiver. "The Kingsley heiress never disappoints. But remember - if the funds don't clear by midnight, don't blame me for what follows."

Evelyn's gaze flicked to her diamond-encrusted watch. "Fifteen hours remain. Patience is a virtue you might consider cultivating."

"Then I'll await your... generous contribution." The line went dead with finality.

Evelyn's grip tightened around the phone. "Harrison, we're returning to Pamore."

This charade with the imposter would end tonight.

"Ms. Carter, I've disclosed everything. If there's nothing further..." Adelaide made to leave.

Harrison intercepted smoothly. "Rest assured, Ms. Montgomery. Our promise stands." He produced a platinum business card. "Contact Callum when the time comes. He'll resolve everything."

Adelaide accepted it with trembling fingers. "Thank you... thank you both."

As Evelyn and Harrison's car disappeared around the corner, Adelaide emerged from the shadows. A masked figure materialized beside her, extending a check. "Your compensation. More than enough for several lifetimes."

Adelaide stared at the numbers without blinking.

"Take it and vanish," the man snapped. "Never return."

Her lips pressed into a bloodless line as she accepted. "Understood."

The masked figure nodded approvingly before melting into the night.

—

At the private helipad, rotor blades sliced through the evening air. Callum clutched Harrison's arm dramatically. "Abandoning me so soon? How shall I endure this cruel separation?"

Harrison rolled his eyes. "Focus on the task, Cal. As for reunions—" His gaze softened toward Evelyn. "Pamore's gates remain open."

"Though," Harrison added with feigned solemnity, "it would please us greatly if you arrived with a significant other next time."

Callum staggered back as if struck. "Et tu, Harrison? This betrayal cuts deepest!"

Evelyn barely suppressed her laughter. "Love finds everyone eventually. Perhaps yours will literally fall from the sky."

Seizing the opportunity, Callum pulled Evelyn aside. "When I visit, you simply must introduce me to your society friends." His grin turned wolfish. "No objections permitted."

Evelyn opened her mouth—

"Excellent! Consider it settled." Callum winked before either could protest.
###Chapter 409 A Clash of Wills

As Callum Blackwood finished speaking, he gave them a casual wave. Evelyn Carter sighed dramatically, spreading her hands. "Harrison, is he actually interested in my friends?"

Harrison Whitmore arched one perfect eyebrow. "Take a wild guess. Who do you think it would be?"

Evelyn shook her head, sending her chestnut waves dancing. "I'm terrible at these games. But love works in mysterious ways, doesn't it? Let him figure it out himself."

A fond smile played on Harrison's lips. "As you wish, darling."

Their private jet soared through Coronia's skies, cutting through clouds until landing smoothly at the private helipad in Pamore hours later. Night had fallen, painting the city in twinkling lights.

Olivia Sinclair and Natalie Reeves had been pacing impatiently. The moment Evelyn appeared, Olivia launched herself forward. "Evie! Finally!" Her arms wrapped tightly around her best friend.

Evelyn laughed, patting Olivia's back. "Breathe, Liv! I told you I'd return victorious." She winked. "And with treasures."

Olivia pulled back instantly. "The designs? You found them?"

With a dramatic flourish, Evelyn produced a thick folder, handing it to Natalie. "Your turn to work magic, Nat."

Natalie's eyes sparkled with mischief as she accepted the documents. "Child's play. Just say when you want this bomb to detonate."

"Jessica - I mean, Juliette expects me at 10 AM. Let's make it 10:30 for maximum impact."

Natalie gave a sharp salute. "Consider it done. The internet won't know what hit it."

Evelyn locked eyes with Harrison, an unspoken understanding passing between them. Tomorrow would be war.

Dawn broke over Pamore's skyline as Evelyn and Harrison arrived at the imposing Pamore Pentagon precisely at 10 AM.

"Where's Ms. Blackwood?" Evelyn asked the stone-faced guard.

The man merely nodded before swinging open the heavy oak doors to reveal an office dripping in ostentatious wealth - all gold accents and modern art that screamed expensive.

Juliette Blackwood swiveled slowly in her leather throne, crimson lips curling. "Punctual as always, Ms. Carter." She rose, circling Evelyn like a shark. "But where's my money? One billion dollars doesn't exactly fit in a purse."

Evelyn remained unshaken, meeting Juliette's gaze head-on. "Patience, Ms. Blackwood. A billion dollars doesn't disappear that easily."

Juliette's laugh was sharp as broken glass. "Cash would've been more impressive. I do love a good money pile."

"You seem awfully fixated on cash," Evelyn countered smoothly. "Strange for someone who clearly doesn't need it."

"Enough games!" Juliette snapped. "Show me the money or this meeting is over."

Evelyn's hand slipped into her blazer pocket. "Before we discuss money, there's something you should see."

A flicker of unease crossed Juliette's face. "What trick are you pulling now?"

Slowly, Evelyn withdrew a worn sketchbook. "Just some light reading material."

Juliette's perfectly sculpted brows furrowed. "What is this supposed to be?" Her fingers twitched, betraying nerves she'd never admit to.

The game was on.
###Chapter 410 Unbelievable

Evelyn chuckled. "What? You don't even recognize your own portfolio, Ms. Blackwood?"

Juliette's eyes widened in shock. "This...this is mine?"

Evelyn gave a casual shrug. "Indeed! I took a little trip back to our alma mater, Coronia University." She tapped the leather-bound book with her manicured nails. "Care to revisit your past creations?"

"You went to Coronia?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Mmm-hmm. Went digging for evidence to clear my name. Instead..." Her gaze sharpened. "I struck gold."

Juliette's fingers twitched. "What exactly did you find?"

With deliberate slowness, Evelyn flipped open the portfolio. "Everything's right here. Shall we take a trip down memory lane?"

Juliette's breath hitched, her poker face slipping for just a second before she schooled her features.

In one swift motion, she snatched the book from Evelyn's hands.

Page after page of exquisite designs unfolded before her. The real Juliette had possessed undeniable talent - each stroke of the pencil, every signature "Juliette Blackwood" scrawled in the corner screamed authenticity.

Juliette knew with cold certainty these weren't her creations. Yet she slammed the book shut without hesitation.

"Impressive detective work, Evelyn. My college sketches? Really?" She forced a laugh. "But plagiarism is plagiarism. What exactly do you hope to prove with these?"

Evelyn tilted her head, studying Juliette like a specimen under glass.

"Fascinating response. Tell me, Ms. Blackwood..." She leaned in. "How does one designer develop two completely distinct artistic styles overnight? Care to enlighten me?"

Juliette's grip turned white-knuckled. "I have no idea what you're implying."

Evelyn had anticipated this denial.

"Really?" Her voice dripped with sarcasm. "You didn't examine your own work closely enough. Though I must admit..." She circled Juliette like a shark. "You've done an excellent job mimicking the real Juliette."

She continued, voice dropping to a dangerous whisper. "The plastic surgery was masterful - you're practically her twin. But you forgot one crucial detail." A razor-sharp smile. "Artistic style is like a fingerprint. And blood types don't change, do they? You might want to revisit your old university records."

Juliette's mask cracked, panic flashing in her eyes.

Evelyn pressed her advantage, voice silky smooth.

"But wait..." In a lightning move, she grabbed Juliette's wrist, yanking up the sleeve to reveal flawless skin. "There's this."

Her laugh was ice-cold. "The real Juliette suffered third-degree burns in that accident five years ago. Scars don't just...disappear."

Juliette jerked back, but Evelyn's grip was iron. "You're insane!"

"Oh, I'll spell it out for you." Evelyn's voice turned deadly serious. "You're not Juliette Blackwood. The real Juliette died in that crash. You're nothing but a cheap imitation."
###Chapter 411 Flawless Acting

Juliette's piercing laughter echoed through the room like shattering glass. The harsh sound made everyone wince involuntarily.

She finally composed herself after what felt like an eternity, wrenching her arm free from Evelyn's grasp. "What absolute nonsense!" Juliette spat, her voice dripping with venom. "If I'm not Juliette Blackwood, then who exactly am I supposed to be?"

"That's precisely what I'd like to know."

Evelyn's gaze remained steely as she studied Juliette's every microexpression, searching for any crack in the facade.

But Juliette merely tossed her hair back with another mocking laugh. "Is this your so-called evidence, Evelyn? Pathetic. This proves nothing."

"Does this exonerate you? Hardly! The truth remains that you plagiarized my work. I suggest you stop harassing me with these absurd accusations."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "So you're refusing to admit it?"

Juliette drew herself up with theatrical indignation. "Admit what? That I need to prove my own identity? The burn scars aren't visible because I had reconstructive surgery - modern medicine works wonders."

"As for the blood type discrepancy, clearly there was an administrative error during university registration. And your most ridiculous claim? That my design style changed? That's the most laughable thing I've ever heard!"

"Every artist evolves over time. My early work was immature - now I've refined my technique. Is growth suddenly a crime?"

The room fell silent.

Juliette had counterarguments ready for every accusation, delivered with flawless conviction. Evelyn couldn't help but admire the woman's quick thinking and composure under pressure.

She actually found herself applauding.

Juliette blinked in confusion. "What are you clapping for?"

"Bravo, Ms. Blackwood," Evelyn said calmly. "Your performance is Oscar-worthy. Such wasted talent - you should consider Hollywood."

"Look who's talking, Evelyn! We're two of a kind."

Evelyn shook her head with a pitying sigh. "The tragedy is... no amount of silver-tongued lies can change facts. You may deny impersonating the real Juliette, but truth has a way of surfacing."

With deliberate slowness, Evelyn produced the death certificate from Adelaide.

"This should settle matters once and for all, don't you think?"

Juliette's mask slipped for a split second. "How did you get that?" she blurted, lunging forward to snatch the document.

Evelyn pivoted smoothly out of reach. "No need for dramatics. It's just a copy - I'd be happy to give you one."

Juliette's fists slammed onto the table with enough force to rattle the teacups. Then came that unnerving laugh again. "Evelyn, you never came here to negotiate in good faith. All this digging proves you wanted a confrontation."

"Fine. If I can't get my billion dollars..." Her voice turned venomous. "I. Will. Destroy. You."

Snatching her phone, Juliette barked a single command: "Execute it!"

While Juliette raged, Evelyn remained preternaturally calm. She pulled out a chair and seated herself with regal poise.

Harrison materialized with a steaming teapot, pouring Evelyn a cup with practiced elegance. She took a deliberate sip, savoring the aroma. "Excellent tea, Ms. Blackwood. Pity about the company."
###Chapter 412 Unmasking Her True Colors

Juliette Blackwood let out a derisive laugh that echoed through the lavish penthouse.

She couldn't decide whether Evelyn Carter was blissfully ignorant of the gravity of the situation or simply didn't care.

Her voice oozed with contempt as she sneered, "Evelyn, darling. How can you possibly think about sipping tea at a time like this? In thirty minutes, your entire reputation will be in ruins. Let's see if you'll still be smiling then."

Evelyn merely shrugged, swirling the amber liquid in her crystal glass. "Is that so? We'll see about that."

As the minute hand on her diamond-encrusted watch hit 10:30, her lips curved into a knowing smile. "The curtain's rising."

Before Juliette could process the meaning, her phone buzzed urgently. "Ms. Blackwood, we have a situation."

The color drained from Juliette's face as the voice on the line delivered devastating news. "That's impossible! Absolutely impossible!"

Slamming her phone down, she whirled on Evelyn with venom in her eyes. "You! This was all your doing! You vicious little -"

"Now, now," Evelyn interrupted smoothly, crossing her legs with effortless grace. "I believe the term is 'poetic justice,' wouldn't you agree?"

Juliette's legs gave way beneath her, saved only by her bodyguard's quick reflexes.

"Juliette," Evelyn continued, her voice turning icy, "you tried to frame me for plagiarism. Now the truth is out - the celebrated designer Jion is nothing but a fraud."

Clenching her fists until her manicured nails drew blood, Juliette gasped, "How did you uncover this?"

She had been certain all evidence had been erased - even the files Nathan Sterling possessed had been destroyed.

Evelyn's eyes gleamed with triumph. "The how doesn't matter, Ms. Blackwood. What matters is - who exactly are you?"

Juliette threw back her head with hysterical laughter. Even with all Evelyn's digging, she'd only uncovered the surface.

Her true identity remained safely hidden.

This realization sparked a flicker of hope.

"Patience, Evelyn!" Juliette taunted, regaining her composure. "All in good time."

She straightened her designer dress with deliberate slowness. "I may have lost this round, and that billion dollars. But I will make you regret humiliating me over it."

Evelyn's gaze sharpened. The mention of the specific amount confirmed her suspicions.

"A billion dollars? Why that exact sum, Ms. Blackwood? Why not more?"

Juliette's smile turned predatory. "That's the million-dollar question, isn't it? Or should I say... billion?"

She took a step closer, her perfume cloying in the tense air. "This is merely the opening act, Evelyn. The best games are played slowly."

With a dramatic clap of her hands, Juliette spun on her heels. "Today you've destroyed everything I've built in the design world. But mark my words - I will ruin you completely. Your reputation, your relationships, everything you hold dear."

Each syllable dripped with malice as she strode toward the exit, her bodyguard in tow.

Evelyn watched the dramatic departure, pieces suddenly clicking into place. Turning to Harrison Whitmore, her eyes widened with realization. "Harrison... I think I know who she really is."
###Chapter 413 It Can't Be Isabella

Their gazes locked as they spoke in unison. "The Delaney family?"

"The Delaney family!"

Surprise flickered in Evelyn's eyes. "Harrison, great minds think alike."

"That impostor Juliette kept harping on about a billion dollars. She's emphasized that exact amount multiple times. Only the Delaneys have ever had a billion-dollar conflict with us."

Harrison's voice dropped to a low, thoughtful tone. The infamous incident between Evelyn and Alistair over the billion-dollar diamond ring had burned through high society like wildfire. The Delaney name had never recovered from the scandal.

Then came the Isabella debacle. Now the once-powerful Delaney dynasty stood in complete ruin.

Every single event traced back to Evelyn in some way.

Which made the Delaneys prime suspects in this plagiarism scheme.

"I've already checked with Dominic. None of the Kingsley family's rivals appear involved."

"So we can conclude this fake Juliette must be connected to the Delaneys."

Harrison had reached the same conclusion as Evelyn.

"One thing's certain - she's not Isabella." The impostor had assumed Juliette's identity five years prior.

"Does Isabella have a sister?"

Evelyn's question cut straight to the heart of the matter.

If this fake Juliette was linked to the Delaneys and harbored such hatred toward her, she had to be one of them!

Apparently, Isabella wasn't the only Delaney heiress.

"I'll launch an investigation immediately. We'll examine all Delaney women from the past three generations who'd be around twenty-five now."

But Evelyn shook her head. "Harrison, if she's a Delaney, we don't need an investigation. I know exactly who can identify her."

Harrison's lips curved. "Alistair?"

Amusement danced in Evelyn's eyes. "Harrison Whitmore, are you reading my mind? I can't keep anything from you."

His gaze softened as he looked at her. "I'll have someone track down Alistair immediately."

Evelyn nodded in agreement.

His team worked with terrifying efficiency. Within the hour, they'd compiled a full report on Alistair's current situation.

Harrison handed her the file. "Since the Delaney bankruptcy, Alistair's been working at a car wash to survive."

Evelyn's eyebrows shot up as she studied the photograph. The man had aged decades. "The mighty villain reduced to this?"

"Don't waste your sympathy. He earned every bit of this." Harrison never softened toward those who deserved their fate. Alistair had made his bed.

"Let's pay him a visit."

They exchanged a glance before Evelyn signaled their driver.

The sleek Rolls-Royce Phantom glided to a stop outside the car wash. The tinted window lowered to reveal Harrison's razor-sharp profile.

"Evelyn, we're here."

Her gaze immediately found Alistair in his stained uniform, scrubbing a car hood with mechanical movements. The contrast to his former arrogance was staggering.

"This... is Alistair?" Disbelief colored her voice.

"Let's see what he knows." She pushed open the door and strode toward the hunched figure.
###Chapter 414 The Delaney Bloodline

Alistair's wrinkled hands trembled as he scrubbed the car's windshield. His once proud posture was now hunched, his aristocratic features weathered by time and hardship.

The sunlight reflected off the soapy water as Evelyn approached silently. He didn't notice her presence until her shadow fell across his work.

"Would you like a wash, ma'am?" His voice was raspy but polite.

When no answer came, Alistair lifted his weary eyes. The moment he recognized Evelyn, his entire body stiffened. The sponge slipped from his fingers with a wet slap.

"You!"

Evelyn's lips curved into a smile that never touched her cold gaze. "Mr. Delaney, it's been too long."

Alistair's jaw clenched so tightly she could hear his teeth grinding. His gnarled fingers curled into fists at his sides.

"What do you want?" he spat, venom dripping from every word.

"Just a conversation, Mr. Delaney."

A bitter laugh escaped his cracked lips. "We have nothing to discuss. Come to gloat at my misery? Look your fill then, but don't interfere with honest work."

The proud patriarch was gone, replaced by this broken shell of a man. But Evelyn saw the fire still burning behind his aged eyes - the unyielding defiance.

"Five minutes. Or shall I speak with your manager instead?"

Alistair's face twisted in rage. "What more could you possibly want, Evelyn? You've already destroyed everything! My company, my reputation - is my life not enough?"

His voice cracked. "Where is Isabella? She's the last of the Delaney blood! Are you determined to wipe my lineage from this earth?"

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Your only granddaughter?"

Alistair suddenly clutched his chest, his face contorting in pain. His mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water, but no words came.

Within seconds, his complexion turned an alarming shade of crimson.

"Mr. Delaney?" Evelyn reached out instinctively.

He swayed dangerously, his eyes rolling back. Harrison moved like lightning, catching the collapsing man before he hit the pavement.

"Evelyn! Hospital - now!"

Her heart pounded as reality crashed over her. By the time she processed what was happening, Alistair's face had gone deathly pale.

The bodyguards sprang into action, loading the unconscious man into the waiting car with practiced efficiency.

The sterile hospital corridor smelled of antiseptic and fear. Evelyn leaned against the cold wall, staring at the glowing red "SURGERY IN PROGRESS" sign.

Harrison stood beside her, his presence steady but silent.

Minutes stretched into eternity as Evelyn's mind raced. Finally, she turned to him, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Harrison... what just happened? He'll be... he has to be okay."

"He will." Harrison's hand found hers, warm and reassuring. "Don't borrow trouble."

But the timing was too perfect. She'd come for answers about Juliette, and Alistair had collapsed the moment she mentioned bloodlines.

"Does this confirm our suspicions?" Evelyn's fingers tightened around Harrison's. "But why would he claim Isabella is the last Delaney heir?"
###Chapter 415 I Hope You'll Stop Here

Evelyn couldn't comprehend any of this. But before she could dwell on it further, a composed figure emerged from the shadows of the corridor, walking toward her with measured steps.

Nathan's gaze locked onto Evelyn, who stood beside Harrison. His jaw tightened, fingers curling into fists at his sides.

Beside him, Simon sensed the dangerous aura radiating from Nathan. He cleared his throat and called out, "Ms. Carter!"

Evelyn's brows lifted in surprise as she turned.

There, several paces behind her, stood Nathan. She had no idea how long he'd been there. His piercing eyes were fixed on the closed doors of the operating theater.

"Evelyn, haven't you done enough damage to the Delaney family?"

Nathan's tone was sharp, laced with an edge of warning. His stance suggested he was ready to defend the Delaneys.

Evelyn's eyes narrowed. "Mr. Sterling, are you here to stand up for them?"

"No!" The word burst from Nathan as his gaze met hers. "I just want you to stop this now."

A cold smile curved Evelyn's lips. "I found it odd when you blocked my investigation into Juliette at Coronia University. And now you're here again. Does this mean you've always known who the impostor is?"

Nathan didn't flinch. "Yes."

He continued, his voice low but firm. "But Evelyn, I'm asking you to trust me just this once. Drop the investigation. Digging deeper won't benefit you. No matter who this Juliette is, I won't let her harm you."

It was a promise—one that Evelyn found laughable. "Nathan, do you even hear how ridiculous that sounds?"

Nathan turned slightly, avoiding her piercing stare. Then, with deliberate slowness, he said, "Evelyn, I once made a vow to protect the Delaney family. I've already broken that promise. So whatever you're planning next, I'm asking you—don't hurt Alistair."

"Mr. Sterling!" Simon interjected sharply, trying to cut him off.

He knew Nathan cared deeply for Evelyn, but these words would only push her further away.

"Mr. Sterling, 'hurt' is hardly the appropriate term here." Harrison stepped forward, shielding Evelyn with his presence as he countered Nathan with icy precision.

"We never intended any harm to Mr. Delaney. Today's incident was entirely unforeseen."

He paused, then added with quiet confidence, "But your insistence on stopping us only makes you seem guilty. Is there something you're hiding about this fake Juliette?"

Each word was enunciated with deliberate clarity.

Nathan scoffed, his expression darkening. "Don't make baseless accusations."

Harrison smirked, meeting Nathan's glare head-on. The tension between them crackled in the air—two forces of equal strength, neither willing to yield.

Just then, the operating theater doors swung open. A harried doctor rushed out, scanning the group. "Who here is family of the patient?"

Nathan reacted first, brushing past Harrison without hesitation. "I am. How is he?"
###Chapter 416 The Delaney Heiress

"The patient's condition is critical." The doctor's voice was grave. "He's suffering from severe coronary artery disease and requires immediate bypass surgery. If you're family, please sign the consent form now."

He extended the clipboard toward Nathan. After a brief hesitation, Nathan took the pen and scrawled his signature. "Do whatever it takes to save him."

"We'll do our best."

Silence swallowed the hospital corridor once more.

As the doctor disappeared behind the operating room doors, Nathan turned to Simon. "Contact the top cardiac specialists worldwide. Get them here immediately."

"Yes, Mr. Sterling."

Simon stepped away to make the calls. Then Nathan's sharp gaze landed on Evelyn. His voice was ice. "There's nothing more for you here. Leave."

Evelyn didn't respond, but her chest tightened with worry for Alistair. She hadn't anticipated things escalating this far.

At that moment, Harrison's phone buzzed. He pulled it out, answering tersely. "What did you find?"

The voice on the other end spoke rapidly. Harrison's expression darkened.

"Understood." He ended the call.

Evelyn sensed the shift. "What is it?"

Harrison's lips curved slightly. "Just as we suspected. The imposter Juliette has undeniable ties to the Delaney family."

Evelyn's pulse spiked. "She's one of them?"

"The Delaney heiress, Diana, supposedly died in a car crash five years ago. The location? Coronia."

Nathan scoffed. "The dead don't come back to life."

Evelyn frowned.

"Unless they never died at all." Harrison's gaze locked onto Nathan. "Juliette Blackwood is Diana Delaney. Isn't she?"

Nathan's cold laugh was answer enough.

The pieces clicked into place for Evelyn. No wonder Juliette had despised her from their first meeting.

This explained everything—Juliette's relentless vendetta against her.

Harrison pressed further. "What I don't understand, Mr. Sterling, is why you're helping her conceal the truth."

Nathan pocketed one hand, his tone dripping with disdain. "You can't prove she's Diana. The official records say Diana Delaney is dead. How do you plan to overturn that?"

Harrison merely smiled. "You'll see."

For the first time, Nathan studied Harrison properly. The man's confidence was unnerving, as if every move had been meticulously planned.

A worthy opponent.

——

Meanwhile, Juliette's design studio was under siege.

The moment the evidence went viral, reporters swarmed the building. Juliette had become public enemy number one—blacklisted by the entire fashion industry.
###Chapter 417 No Way Back

The assistant stood nervously in the office, clutching a stack of documents. "Juliette, our major partners have severed ties with us. They're demanding compensation for contract breaches."

He swallowed hard before continuing. "Suppliers are requesting full refunds for delivered goods. Our flagship store is drowning in returns. All manufacturing has ceased."

"The damage control isn't working." His voice trembled. "No one cares about our discounts or explanations anymore."

Silence filled the room like toxic gas.

Juliette's face twisted with rage. With one violent sweep of her arm, she sent everything on her desk crashing to the floor. Papers scattered like frightened birds.

"Get out! All of you worthless idiots!" she screamed.

The assistant flinched but held his ground. "Juliette, if this continues... our design house won't survive the month—"

"Then let it burn!" Juliette's shrill voice cut through the air. "You're all incompetent fools anyway! What do I pay you for? To stand there looking pathetic?"

She paced like a caged animal. "Either fix this disaster immediately or pack your things! Useless trash, every single one of you!"

To everyone's shock, the assistant slammed his files onto the nearest surface. "I quit! You can take this job and shove it! Who do you think you are?"

His face flushed with anger. "I'm not your punching bag, Juliette. I'm a human being with actual skills. Keep your damn job!"

He stormed out without looking back.

One by one, other staff members set down their work and followed.

Juliette's scream echoed through the emptying office. "Leave then! See if I care! The world won't miss your pathetic existence!"

Soon, only a handful remained.

Juliette collapsed into her chair with hysterical laughter. This was all Evelyn's fault. That scheming, backstabbing witch.

Her manicured nails dug into the armrests. "Evelyn Carter, you'll pay for this," she whispered with venom.

The ringing of her private phone startled her. Few had this number - it had to be important.

The caller's words turned Juliette's face ashen. "What? How? Which hospital? I'm coming now!"

She grabbed her purse in panic, rushing toward the elevators.

But downstairs, a swarm of reporters ambushed her in the lobby.

"Juliette! Care to comment on the plagiarism scandal?"

"After championing original designs, how do you face your betrayed followers?"

"Was stealing another designer's work worth destroying your career?"

Juliette staggered back, shielding her face. "Security! Where are—"

No guards came to her rescue. Camera flashes blinded her as microphones jabbed toward her like weapons. Trapped against the wall, Juliette realized with sickening clarity - there was no way back.
###Chapter 418 Will She Come

The live stream on someone's phone was gaining traction at an alarming rate. Viewership skyrocketed to nearly a million in minutes.

"Juliette, care to comment on these allegations?"

"You were the one who plagiarized Ms. Carter's designs from the start, yet you had the audacity to accuse her and file reports. What gave you such confidence? Did you truly believe the truth would never surface? Or were you simply gambling on luck?"

"Juliette, what's your next move? Will you apologize to the fans who once stood by you?"

Juliette Blackwood pressed her hands against her ears, blocking out the reporters' relentless questions.

Her head shook violently as she muttered under her breath, "I didn't steal anything. This is all a setup. A complete fabrication! All of you, back off! Get away from me!"

But the media swarm showed no mercy, shoving microphones and cameras into her personal space until she could barely breathe.

"Juliette, we demand answers."

Her mind went blank. The sensory overload made her skull feel like it might split open. Reality distorted into a nightmarish cacophony.

A primal scream tore from her throat. She clutched her head, wailing in distress. "Leave me alone! Everyone, just disappear!"

Wild, desperate gestures attempted to ward off the journalists, but they stood their ground like stone statues.

Never had Juliette experienced such public humiliation. Waves of shock and fury crashed over her, igniting a destructive impulse to burn the entire world to ashes.

"Evelyn, you won't get away with this," she snarled at the cameras through clenched teeth. Then darkness swallowed her vision as she collapsed.

Olivia Sinclair watched the live feed with immense satisfaction. "Karma's finally catching up to Juliette. She reaped what she sowed."

Beside her, Natalie Reeves scoffed. "That woman has no shame whatsoever. She created this mess with her own hands."

"Thankfully, our boutique's reputation is restored. Clients are returning steadily - we've already secured several custom orders." Olivia's face brightened. "The storm has finally passed."

But Natalie immediately handed over her tablet. "Don't celebrate yet. Juliette isn't as easily defeated as we hoped."

Olivia gasped at the screen's contents. "You've got to be kidding me! That faint was fake? That woman's cunning knows no bounds!"

The footage showed reporters dispersing after Juliette's collapse. No one bothered to check on her. Moments later, when the coast was clear, Juliette sprang up and vanished into the shadows.

"Where's she going? We can't let her escape!" Panic edged Olivia's voice, but Natalie remained composed.

"Relax, I've arranged surveillance. They'll expose every one of her dirty secrets to the public."

Natalie then updated Evelyn. "Evie, are you pleased with how things unfolded?"

Evelyn studied the video Natalie sent. The disheveled wreck on screen bore no resemblance to the usually poised Juliette.

It appeared their adversary had truly been backed into a corner.

Then Evelyn glanced at the hospital wall clock. "Harrison," she asked quietly, "do you think she'll come?"
###Chapter 419 True Colors Revealed

Evelyn found herself at a loss for words when Natalie delivered the shocking news. "Isabella's gone," Natalie's text read, the words glaring from her phone screen.

Her fingers trembled as she typed back. "What do you mean disappeared?"

The reply came swiftly. "My operative saw her exit a vehicle at the hospital entrance. Then a black sedan pulled up and she was taken."

Evelyn's nails dug into her palms.

"Kidnapped?"

"Professionals," Natalie confirmed. "They moved like shadows. By the time my man reacted, she'd vanished."

"Understood."

The call ended, leaving Evelyn staring at the operating theater doors where Nathan remained in surgery. Isabella's appearance proved her connection to the Delaneys ran deeper than anyone suspected.

But who would dare abduct her?

Midnight draped the hospital in silence, broken only by the rhythmic beeping of monitors. Then footsteps echoed from the emergency stairwell.

A hooded figure emerged, face obscured by a medical mask. Only piercing eyes were visible as she slipped into the VIP suite.

Juliette moved with practiced stealth toward the bed where Alistair lay fighting for his life. Seeing her grandfather's weakened state, tears welled in her eyes.

"Grandfather...I've come home."

She clasped his frail hand, remembering the titan who'd once ruled their empire. "I'll restore our family's glory," she whispered. "Every sacrifice you made - I'll honor it."

Her voice hardened. "Those who hurt you will pay. Just hold on. Wait for me."

As she turned to leave, blinding lights flooded the room. Juliette spun toward the doorway where Nathan leaned casually against the frame, his dark gaze unreadable.

"You're still here?" she snapped, masking her shock with irritation.

Nathan pushed off the door, his lips quirking. "Remarkable recovery for a man who survived ten-hour bypass surgery. With proper care, he'll walk out soon."

"Should I thank you?" Juliette's laugh held no warmth. "But gratitude isn't what I feel, Nathan."

His eyebrow arched. "Five years vanished with a new identity. Why resurface now?"

"Don't play dumb!" Her fists clenched. "Look what you let happen to my family! You promised to protect Isabella - where is she? What has that witch Evelyn done with her?"

Juliette hadn't planned this return. She'd meant to bury Jessica Landon forever. But some debts demanded payment in blood.
###Chapter 420 Declare War

If the Delaney family hadn't collapsed and Isabella hadn't vanished without a trace, Juliette would never have resurfaced.

And Diana would have remained dead in everyone's memories.

"Diana, I'm sorry about Isabella." Nathan didn't elaborate. Those simple words carried the weight of his regret.

"How amusing to hear an apology from the great Mr. Sterling. But I don't need your pity. What I need is your help to restore my family's legacy."

"Let's join forces against Evelyn. I want to break her completely. To make her experience the agony of losing everything," Diana declared, her voice laced with steel.

Nathan's eyes darkened as he immediately rejected her. "As long as I'm breathing, you won't lay a finger on Evelyn."

That single sentence spoke volumes about where his loyalties lay.

Diana arched an eyebrow in surprise. The ruthless business titan, feared for his merciless tactics, actually had a weakness.

"Nathan, you only have two choices. Help me, or watch Evelyn and I perish together. My life means nothing, but hers? The precious Kingsley heiress? Surely you don't want her to meet an untimely end?"

The effect was instantaneous. Nathan's face twisted in fury.

He seized Diana's wrist, his grip like iron. "Don't test me, Diana."

His violent reaction only pleased her more. The stronger his response, the clearer it proved Evelyn's importance to him.

She smirked. "Relax, Nathan. I'll spare her life... for now. But I will strip away everything she holds dear. Let her taste what it's like to fall from grace."

With that, Diana wrenched free from his grasp and strode away.

Nathan watched her retreating figure, his knuckles whitening as he suddenly slammed his fist into the concrete wall.

—

The shrill ringtone jolted Evelyn awake. She fumbled for her phone, her voice thick with sleep. "Hello?"

"Evie! Turn on the news! Juliette's holding a press conference right now!"

That snapped Evelyn to full alertness. She bolted upright. "What press conference?"

Natalie's words tumbled out in a rush. "Juliette just announced she's quitting the fashion industry. She's launching a new venture into real estate development."

Evelyn swiped open her phone, her fingers flying across the screen. The hashtag #JulietteExitsFashion was trending at number one.

She tapped into the live feed just as Juliette appeared on camera.

True to form, Juliette made no mention of past scandals or controversies. No explanations, no justifications.

With cool professionalism, she announced her departure from fashion design and the establishment of Blackwood Realty, marking her official foray into property development.

"Blackwood Realty?"

"The Delaneys built their empire on real estate. They dominated Pamore's property market for decades. Now Juliette's stepping into that arena. What does that tell you?"

At minimum, it confirmed Juliette's deep ties to the Delaney dynasty. This move signaled her intent to reclaim what was lost.

A slow smile curved Evelyn's lips. "Seems she's throwing down the gauntlet."

"A challenge? Evie, what's your next move?"
###Chapter 421 The Antagonist's Triumph

"I'll play along for now."

Evelyn had already formulated a strategy in her mind. Whatever Juliette was planning, she would proceed with caution.

At precisely 9:00 am, Evelyn strode into Kingsley Industries in her designer heels. The tailored suit accentuated her commanding presence.

Maxwell Donovan, who'd been anxiously awaiting her arrival, rushed forward. "Ms. Carter, welcome back."

Evelyn gave a curt nod before stepping into the elevator. Maxwell followed closely, reciting her schedule in rapid-fire succession.

"Video conference at 10:00 am. Meeting with Mr. Langley from Summit Corporation at 11:00 in the executive boardroom."

As the elevator ascended, Evelyn absorbed the information with practiced ease. "Understood."

The doors slid open to reveal Julian Hawthorne's smirking face.

"Ms. Carter! What a pleasant surprise. We were beginning to think you'd abandoned us." His tone dripped with false concern. "A whole week without your presence - most unusual."

Evelyn halted mid-step. "Personal matters required my attention, Director Hawthorne. Your concern is... touching."

Julian nodded sympathetically. "Everything resolved, I hope? The company isn't the same without your... unique leadership style."

His performance as the caring elder would've been convincing to anyone who didn't know better.

"Oh, and Ms. Carter - has Mr. Donovan briefed you about the Lockhart project complications?"

Julian's expression turned mournful. "A minor collapse in one of the shafts. No lives lost, but the financial impact..." He shook his head. "The quarterly projections will take a significant hit."

Evelyn's sharp gaze swung to Maxwell. "Is this accurate?"

Maxwell hesitated, glancing at Julian. "I'll provide a full report shortly, Ms. Carter."

Julian chuckled. "Mr. Donovan has been rather preoccupied lately. An understandable oversight." His smile turned predatory. "Though better late than never, as they say."

He leaned closer, lowering his voice. "Six months into our little wager, and the numbers remain... disappointing. Now this Lockhart debacle. Quite the predicament, wouldn't you agree?"

The smugness radiating from him was nearly palpable.

"You're still wet behind the ears, Ms. Carter. The corporate world eats idealists like you for breakfast."

His chuckle turned condescending. "Why not bow out gracefully? Return to being the pampered heiress before you embarrass yourself further."

Evelyn remained impassive. "The game isn't over yet, Director Hawthorne. Your impatience is showing."

Julian feigned offense. "Merely looking out for you, my dear. When you inevitably fail, the humiliation will be... unpleasant for all involved."

He spread his hands in a mock gesture of concern. "Let's not make this any more painful than necessary, hmm?"
###Chapter 422 The Defeat

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile as she nodded. "You make a valid point, Director Hawthorne. There's no need for this to escalate into an ugly confrontation."

Then, with deliberate slowness, she reached into her designer handbag and retrieved a sleek black USB drive.

"Given the circumstances," she continued, her voice smooth as silk, "there are certain matters I've chosen to overlook—until now. But I believe it's only fair to give you advance notice. Don't you agree?"

Julian Hawthorne frowned, his sharp gaze locking onto the device in her hand. "What exactly are you implying, Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn's smile deepened as she extended the USB toward him.

Leaning in just enough for her whisper to carry, she murmured, "Director Hawthorne, while you and your wife may hold senior positions in this company, rules still apply. I'm sure you're aware of the... irregularities in the finance department under your wife's supervision."

His face drained of color. "Explain yourself."

"Everything you need is right here," she said, tapping the USB lightly. "Review it at your leisure."

Julian's fingers clenched around the drive. "What's on this?"

Evelyn remained composed, the ghost of a smirk playing on her lips. This evidence had been handed to her by Dominic weeks ago—a contingency, he'd called it.

And now, the timing was perfect.

"Director Hawthorne, secrets have a way of surfacing. I've turned a blind eye for the sake of Kingsley Industries. But with what I currently possess, your wife could face serious legal consequences."

The man's confident demeanor shattered instantly.

He hadn't anticipated this level of ruthlessness from the seemingly inexperienced woman before him. That she had uncovered his wife's dealings—and gathered concrete proof—was unthinkable.

"Where did you get this?" Julian demanded through gritted teeth, searching her face for any tells.

Evelyn knew when to press her advantage. She arched a brow. "The source isn't important. What matters is this—your wife resigns from Kingsley Industries by day's end. Otherwise, this evidence goes straight to the authorities."

"You—" His jaw worked, resentment burning in his eyes before he finally exhaled in defeat.

"Understood, Ms. Carter."

"Excellent."

After a beat, she added, "One more thing. I believe in fair competition. Our bet stands—but if there's any foul play, even a victory would be meaningless."

With that, she turned on her heel, leaving Julian standing rigid, the USB drive digging into his palm like a brand.

For the first time, he had been outmaneuvered by Evelyn Carter.

And the taste of defeat was bitter.

——

Meanwhile, Evelyn pushed open her office door, Maxwell close behind.

"That was masterful," he said, barely containing his glee. "You should've seen Hawthorne's face. Priceless."

But Evelyn's expression was pensive. "Now," she said, turning to face him, "care to explain what really happened with the Dunhill mine contracts?"
###Chapter 423 Where's Isabella

Maxwell Donovan's expression darkened at the question. "Ms. Carter, the incident at the Dunhill mine is highly suspicious. While there were no injuries, it's significantly delayed our project timeline."

Evelyn's fingers tapped rhythmically against her desk. "Accident or sabotage?"

Maxwell met her gaze steadily. "The evidence points toward deliberate action."

A cold smile touched Evelyn's lips as she processed this revelation. "Someone's getting impatient."

Her eyes flickered with calculation. "Any connection to them?"

"The investigation is ongoing," Maxwell replied. "You'll be the first to know when we have concrete answers."

With a dismissive wave, Evelyn signaled the end of their meeting.

Alone in her office, she moved to the floor-to-ceiling windows. The sprawling cityscape below seemed to mirror the complexity of her thoughts.

The sudden ringing of her phone shattered the silence.

"Evelyn, we need to talk." Juliette Blackwood's voice carried an unmistakable edge.

Evelyn's grip tightened imperceptibly on her phone. "What could we possibly have to discuss, Ms. Blackwood?"

"Meet me and find out. Unless you're afraid?"

Ice crept into Evelyn's tone. "Petty taunts won't work on me, Juliette."

A humorless laugh crackled through the line. "Enough games. If you don't come, you'll regret it."

The line went dead before Evelyn could respond. Moments later, her phone pinged with a location - a café across from Kingsley Industries.

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn entered the designated café where Juliette waited with predatory patience.

"You came after all, Ms. Carter," Juliette said, rising with false courtesy.

Evelyn's smile held no warmth. "Ms. Blackwood - no, perhaps I should address you differently now."

Juliette merely arched a brow, neither confirming nor denying.

"Let's be frank," Juliette said abruptly. "You've clearly deduced my true identity. There's no point in pretense."

She leaned forward, eyes burning with intensity. "I'm Isabella's older sister. The long-lost Delaney heiress - Diana Delaney."

Evelyn showed no surprise at the confession.

"Then tell me, Ms. Delaney, what's the purpose of this meeting?"

"No pleasantries then. I want to know where my sister is. What have you done with Isabella?"

Evelyn's expression remained impassive. "You're asking the wrong person. I have no knowledge of Isabella's whereabouts."

Diana's spoon clattered against her saucer. "Don't lie to me! After everything Isabella did to you, you'd never let her walk away unscathed."

Her voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Release her, and I might show mercy. Continue this charade, and I'll make you suffer."

Evelyn remained unmoved by the threats. "Your vendetta means nothing to me."

She tilted her head slightly. "Though I should mention - Isabella currently faces multiple felony charges. Even if she returned to Pamore, prison would be her only destination."

Diana's hands clenched into white-knuckled fists. "You expect me to believe that?"
###Chapter 424 It Has Nothing to Do With Her

"Believe me or don't. That's entirely up to you."

Evelyn's voice was calm, but her gaze held a glacial edge.

Diana let out a sharp laugh. "You're awfully confident, Evelyn. Aren't you afraid I'll destroy everything you've built?"

A cold smile played on Evelyn's lips. "That depends entirely on whether you're capable."

Diana's expression hardened with determination. "If that's how you want to play this, consider this your warning."

"Sterling Enterprises won't let Kingsley Industries win a single contract. I'll personally ensure your downfall."

Evelyn lifted her chin, meeting Diana's challenge head-on. "Are you declaring war, Ms. Delaney?"

Diana shrugged with feigned indifference. "What if I am? And let me remind you—I won't just take your business. I might just take your man too."

"Do you know why Nathan always protected Isabella and divorced you for her?" Diana's smirk grew smug. "Because I asked him to look after my family. He chose my family over you. That must sting, Evelyn, considering how deeply you loved him."

Evelyn's expression remained impassive. The years with Nathan had been her darkest, most painful period.

But now, Diana's words couldn't touch her. They felt like someone else's story.

Evelyn actually laughed. At first, Diana's challenge had sparked her competitive spirit. But now...

"If you want Nathan so badly, you're welcome to him."

"What did you say?"

Diana gaped when she saw no trace of emotion in Evelyn's eyes regarding Nathan. This wasn't the reaction of a woman still in love.

"Need me to repeat myself?"

Diana scoffed. "You fought so hard to marry him. Can you really let go that easily?"

Evelyn's smile was serene. She had let go—completely. From the moment she'd faced death in that car crash and witnessed Nathan's betrayal, her heart had turned to stone.

Love couldn't be forced.

And perhaps... she'd found someone who truly mattered now.

"Ms. Delaney, the future is what matters. I owe you no explanations."

With that, Evelyn rose to leave.

Diana grabbed her arm. "How do you think Nathan would feel hearing you say these things?"

Evelyn didn't look back. "That's his concern, not mine."

She walked away without a backward glance.

The moment Evelyn disappeared, Diana turned toward a shadowed corner. "You can come out now."

Nathan emerged, his face stormy. Diana waited eagerly for his reaction.

"Nathan, you saw for yourself. Evelyn doesn't care about you at all. Why waste your time on her?"

Nathan ignored her question. "Stop this, Diana."

Diana's grin turned predatory. "Why would I? Evelyn destroyed my family. Did you think I'd let that slide?"

"The Delaney family's troubles have nothing to do with her. If Isabella hadn't—"

"You've changed, Nathan," Diana interrupted, shaking her head. "Even now, you're still defending her."
###Chapter 425 Under His Protection

Nathan's expression darkened but he remained silent.

Danielle continued with an icy smirk, "But as a woman, I can clearly see that Evelyn has no feelings for you, Nathan. You should let go."

Her words struck a nerve. He snapped, "That's enough, Diana."

"Why? Can't handle the truth?"

Nathan's lips tightened. "Those who live by deception will fall. If you want a fresh start, I can provide support. Consider it Alistair's final compensation."

"Don't say his name!" Diana shrieked.

Her composure shattered instantly. "Nathan, never mention him to me again."

Clutching her temples, she teetered on the edge of hysteria.

When she turned back, her gaze burned with fury. "Invest five hundred million in Landon Group, or Evelyn dies with me."

Money meant nothing to him.

He pulled out his checkbook without hesitation, signed with a flourish, and thrust it at her. "Last time. Remember - Evelyn is off limits."

The moment the paper touched her palm, he turned on his heel.

Diana stood frozen, hatred twisting her features as she watched him leave.

Her fingers convulsed, crumpling the pristine check beyond recognition.

———

After leaving the café, Evelyn wandered aimlessly for the first time in years. Exhaustion weighed on her shoulders like a leaden cloak.

Then a familiar silhouette materialized. She blinked, certain her eyes deceived her - until Harrison stepped into focus.

His warm smile melted her defenses. "Evie, what are you doing out here?"

She laughed breathlessly. "Harry? Am I hallucinating?"

He captured her chilled hands in his. "Maxwell said you rushed out looking distressed. I had to make sure you're alright."

His touch sent warmth radiating through her veins.

Suddenly, her restless heart found its anchor.

"I'm fine. Actually... I feel lighter now."

"Lighter?" His brow furrowed.

She simply squeezed his hand in response, a secret smile playing on her lips.

For the first time, she'd truly emptied her heart of the man who once consumed it.

"By the way, Juliette came clean. She's Diana Delaney. The battle lines are drawn now."

Danger flashed in Harrison's eyes - a silent promise of protection.

"What's your move?"

Evelyn squared her shoulders, determination igniting her gaze. "We'll settle this in the boardroom. May the best strategist win."

"Go. I've got your back."

He knew her strength. Trusted her capability. But should she falter, his arms would catch her without fail.
###Chapter 426 Not Your Territory

"There's an exclusive industry gala tonight. Kingsley Industries is scouting for fresh ventures. Care to join me?"

Evelyn's face brightened instantly as she nodded in agreement.

"Absolutely. I've been stressing over our Q3 targets. This might be the perfect opportunity to secure new partnerships."

At precisely 7:00 PM, the grand chandeliers of The Regal Palace - Pamore's most prestigious venue - cast golden light over arriving guests.

The guest list read like a who's who of Pamore's elite. An invitation alone signaled one's standing among the city's power players. Naturally, Sterling Enterprises had received theirs.

After adjusting Nathan's tie, Simon spoke quietly. "Sir, Horizon Technologies is co-hosting tonight. Ms. Carter will likely attend."

Nathan's fingers froze mid-motion. His reflection stared back - immaculate in his Tom Ford tuxedo.

"Have the car brought around," he said finally, voice betraying nothing.

Simon masked his surprise. Not even a flicker of reaction at Evelyn's mention.

"Right away, Mr. Sterling."

In the hallway, Eleanor Blackwell appeared, draped in Chanel. Nathan's expression darkened.

"Mother. Where are you going?"

Eleanor beamed. "Juliette invited me to a soirée. One must maintain social connections, darling."

"Juliette?" Nathan's voice turned glacial. "Which Juliette?"

"Really, Nathan! Juliette Blackwood - the designer I wanted you to meet. Her spring collection just debuted in Milan."

A cruel smirk twisted Nathan's lips.

"Have you been living under a rock, Mother? That 'esteemed designer' was just exposed as a fraud."

Eleanor's smile shattered. "What nonsense is this?"

"Check your phone if you don't believe me." Nathan straightened his cuffs. "Stick to shopping. And stay away from that con artist."

Before Eleanor could respond, Juliette herself materialized - all calculated elegance in a blush pink Carolina Herrera gown.

"Mr. Sterling," she cooed, pretending not to overhear. "What a pleasure."

Nathan's glare could have frozen lava.

"Ms. Blackwood. This isn't your territory."

The warning hung between them like drawn steel.

Undeterred, Juliette linked arms with Eleanor.

"Now now, Mr. Sterling. Your mother and I have become quite close since Vanessa left. Someone should keep her company."

Her saccharine smile didn't reach her cold, calculating eyes.
###Chapter 427 The Gala Affair

At the mention of Vanessa, Nathan's expression darkened, his jaw tightening visibly.

Eleanor scoffed, turning her sharp gaze toward him. "Nathan, you exiled Vanessa to that godforsaken place. She's suffered enough. When will you recall her? Must I never see my daughter again?"

Nathan turned slowly, his voice deceptively calm. "Mother, if you wish to join Vanessa, arrangements can be made immediately."

Eleanor's lips snapped shut.

Astana—where Vanessa was banished—was a barren wasteland with abysmal living conditions. At her age, Eleanor wouldn't last a week in such squalor.

"Nathan, that's not what I meant. I merely miss her... Fine. She erred, and punishment is due. At least I still have Juliette by my side."

"Then Ms. Blackwood, I trust you'll attend to her properly."

Juliette dipped her head demurely. "Mr. Sterling, you have my word. Mrs. Blackwell will want for nothing."

Without another word, Nathan strode toward the exit. "Simon, to the Grand Santio."

"Yes, sir."

The moment he left, Eleanor grasped Juliette's arm. "Where are we going today, dear?"

Juliette's lips curved mysteriously. "You'll see."

——

Thirty minutes later, their car pulled up at the Grand Santio's glittering entrance.

Eleanor hesitated upon recognizing the elite crowd—Pamore's crème de la crème who'd once flocked to her soirées. After Vanessa's scandal, they'd dropped her like yesterday's news.

Her fingers dug into Juliette's sleeve. "Why bring me here?"

Juliette patted her hand reassuringly. "Tonight's attendees hold Pamore's reins. Cultivating these connections could benefit Sterling Enterprises."

The strategic phrasing stroked Eleanor's ego. She was, after all, the Blackwell matriarch. Surely the scandal had blown over by now?

"But without invitations—"

"Your name is invitation enough." Juliette's flattery worked like champagne, making Eleanor lift her chin.

"Very well. Let's mingle."

Juliette's smile vanished the instant Eleanor turned away.

With the Delaneys' downfall, Pamore's elite had distanced themselves. Worse, her true identity as Diana must remain buried.

Now she was just another startup founder—wealthy but powerless without connections.

Eleanor was her only ladder back into high society.

As predicted, no one dared stop the Blackwell matriarch at the door.

Inside, several socialites already gravitated toward Eleanor, drawn by the Sterling name's lingering prestige.
###Chapter 428 Utterly Embarrassed

"Madam Blackwell, how lovely to see you again. You're positively glowing these days."

"Whatever have you been occupied with lately? We've missed your company at our weekly bridge games."

"We simply must arrange a luncheon soon."

Eleanor Blackwell basked in the attention, her chest swelling with pride. This was the familiar adoration she'd been missing since her social standing had declined.

Beside her, Juliette Blackwood smiled demurely as the society ladies turned their gazes toward her. "Madam Blackwell, who is this—"

Before Eleanor could respond, Juliette extended her hand. "Juliette Blackwood, pleased to meet you all."

The women exchanged subtle glances as they assessed the unfamiliar face. When none recognized her from their elite circles, their polite smiles cooled noticeably.

Eleanor quickly drew Juliette closer. "Juliette is an internationally acclaimed fashion designer, quite renowned in her field."

She patted Juliette's arm. "Should any of you require couture designs, she'd be delighted to offer her services at a generous discount."

A few women nodded politely, but their disinterest remained palpable.

Then Arabella Whitmore's eyes narrowed in recognition. "Now that you mention fashion design, I believe I've heard your name before."

Juliette's face lit up with hope. Perhaps her hard work was finally being acknowledged in these circles.

But Arabella's next words turned her blood to ice. "I knew you looked familiar. You're that designer who made headlines recently—the one accused of rampant plagiarism across multiple collections."

She tilted her head mockingly. "Aren't you just a common thief in designer clothing?"

Juliette's face drained of color under the sudden barrage of disdainful stares. Her nails dug into her palms as she stammered, "That's not—"

The women turned away in unison, their retreating figures speaking volumes. Eleanor stood frozen, her expression shifting from confusion to dawning horror.

"Juliette," she demanded, "what is the meaning of this?" The pieces clicked together—Nathan's warning before he left, these women's reactions. "Tell me you didn't actually steal others' work!"

Juliette seized Eleanor's arm desperately. "Madam Blackwell, you must believe me—I was framed! This is all Evelyn Carter's doing!"

At the mention of Evelyn, Eleanor's eyes darkened with familiar hatred. The girl who had caused her so much humiliation.

"How is that wretched girl involved?" Eleanor hissed.

Juliette saw her opening and struck with precision. "Evelyn orchestrated this entire scandal to destroy my reputation. She's jealous of my talent and connections to your family."

She leaned closer, her voice dripping with venom. "This is just another one of her schemes to hurt the Blackwell name through me. She's punishing you by association, Madam Blackwell."
###Chapter 429 United Against a Common Enemy

Juliette Blackwood spun her tale with dramatic flair, embellishing every detail to paint herself as the victim. Each carefully chosen word dripped with self-preservation.

Eleanor Blackwell's face twisted in fury as she listened. "That Evelyn Carter is truly vile. She's always been malicious. Vanessa and I suffered under her schemes before."

Juliette lowered her lashes, feigning sorrow with a practiced sigh. "But what can I do? She's a Kingsley heiress while I'm nobody. I have no choice but to endure this humiliation."

The words struck a chord with Eleanor. She remembered all too well how Evelyn had humiliated her. Even now, Vanessa remained exiled in Astana, separated from her by continents.

Patting Juliette's hand with false sympathy, Eleanor murmured, "This isn't your fault, darling. Evelyn is simply too cunning."

"Justice may be slow," Eleanor continued, her voice dripping venom, "but we'll witness her downfall soon enough."

Juliette nodded eagerly, linking arms with Eleanor in a show of false affection. To onlookers, they might have appeared as a loving mother-daughter pair.

A sudden hush fell over the crowd as murmurs rippled through the ballroom. "Look who just arrived."

All heads turned toward the entrance where Evelyn Carter made her grand entrance in a breathtaking tangerine gown, Harrison Whitmore's arm securely tucked under hers.

The dazzling pair commanded attention effortlessly. Recognizing them, guests couldn't help but whisper praises.

"Ms. Kingsley is absolutely radiant tonight. Her poise is unmatched."

"Modern women should live for themselves like her. Imagine how suffocating her life must have been married into the Blackwell family. Now that she's free, she's flourishing."

"Did you hear? Kingsley Industries has been thriving under her leadership while Sterling Enterprises keeps reporting losses."

"We should cultivate connections with Ms. Kingsley. Our company might need her favor someday."

Watching Evelyn bask in the spotlight, Eleanor and Juliette exchanged bitter glances. Juliette's eyes burned with jealousy, her gaze sharpening into daggers aimed at Evelyn.

She couldn't stand it.

Why did Evelyn command respect and admiration effortlessly while Juliette became society's laughingstock?

Juliette clenched her fists, determined to reverse their fortunes—to crush Evelyn beneath her heel and make her experience this humiliation tenfold.

"Mrs. Blackwell, see how she's reveling in the attention?" Juliette spat through gritted teeth.

Eleanor scoffed. "Let her enjoy it while she can. Her downfall will be spectacular. We have all the time in the world to watch."

Neither noticed the wealthy socialite eavesdropping nearby until she burst into laughter. "Mrs. Blackwell, could that be jealousy I detect toward your former daughter-in-law?"

Eleanor's face flushed crimson. "Jealous? I'm merely stating facts."

The socialite's smirk widened. Coming from a family far wealthier than the Blackwells, she had no qualms about putting Eleanor in her place.
###Chapter 430 Cutting Remarks

Evelyn Chambers arched a perfectly sculpted eyebrow, her crimson lips curling into a smirk. "Mrs. Blackwell, darling, jealousy doesn't suit you. What you're feeling is something far more pathetic."

She let the pause linger, savoring the moment. "Regret."

"Bitter, consuming regret," Evelyn continued, tapping her manicured nails against her champagne flute. "After all, you had the chance to welcome the heiress of Kingsley Industries into your family."

Her gaze flickered dismissively toward Juliette. "And instead you've settled for... this." The unspoken insult hung heavier than any words could convey.

Eleanor Blackwell's face flushed crimson. "How dare you! Explain yourself this instant!"

With an elegant shrug, Evelyn simply turned away, her designer gown swirling dramatically as she approached Evelyn Carter.

"Ms. Carter," she greeted, her tone transforming into warm honey. The contrast from her previous sharpness was almost comical.

Evelyn Carter offered a polite smile. "Mrs. Chambers. Lovely to see you."

The socialite's eyes lit up at being recognized. "My dear, success becomes you. You're practically glowing." Her meaningful glance toward Harrison Whitmore spoke volumes.

"Thank you," Evelyn Carter replied smoothly. "Life has been kind lately."

Evelyn Chambers leaned in conspiratorially. "A word of caution, darling. That woman..." She discreetly gestured toward Eleanor. "She's positively green with envy. Watch your back."

Without missing a beat, Evelyn Carter redirected the conversation. "That's an exquisite gown, Mrs. Chambers. Is that the new collection from La Perle?"

The socialite preened, fingers fluttering to her diamond earrings. "Flown in from Paris just this morning. The waiting list was six months, but darling, some things are worth the wait."

"It's stunning on you," Evelyn Carter complimented. "You should visit my atelier in Pamore sometime. I'd be honored to design something special for you."

Evelyn Chambers nearly squealed with delight. "Would you really? I've heard your custom pieces are impossible to get!"

"Consider it done," Evelyn Carter assured her. "Just name the date."

As the socialite floated away in a cloud of joy and Chanel No. 5, Harrison's arm slipped around Evelyn's waist. His breath was warm against her ear. "I rather liked hearing her say 'happy marriage,'" he murmured.

The effect was instantaneous - Evelyn's ears turned pink, her pulse quickening. "Harrison, I..." Her voice came out embarrassingly breathless.

His low chuckle sent shivers down her spine. "Speechless, darling? That's a first."
###Chapter 431 Are You Serious

Harrison leaned in and captured Evelyn's lips in a tender kiss, effectively silencing whatever words she had been about to speak.

The world seemed to freeze around them. Evelyn's eyes widened in surprise, her breath catching in her throat.

For a moment, she forgot how to react.

Harrison chuckled softly, the sound warm and affectionate as he pulled her closer. "Evelyn, my love, I can't wait to make you my wife."

Evelyn blinked up at him, her mind struggling to process his words. Several heartbeats passed before she finally responded with a shy, breathless whisper of agreement.

The joy that lit up Harrison's eyes was unmistakable. "Darling, do you mean it?"

A slow, radiant smile spread across Evelyn's face as she met his gaze.

Seeing his own reflection in her sparkling eyes, Harrison's smile widened into a brilliant grin. This was the moment he'd been dreaming of for years.

Around them, the crowd had taken notice, their curious gazes making Evelyn's cheeks flush crimson. "Harrison... people are watching."

Reluctantly, he released her from his embrace.

Evelyn turned away slightly, drawing in a shaky breath. Her heart pounded erratically in her chest - this exhilarating feeling was both comfortingly familiar and thrillingly new.

"Sweetheart, Matthias Thornton from Byte Innovations is here tonight." With this simple statement, Harrison successfully redirected Evelyn's attention.

Matthias Thornton represented one of their key business targets for the evening. Byte Innovations currently dominated the short video market, an industry experiencing explosive growth with tremendous potential. Kingsley Industries was eager to enter this space.

Evelyn's professional instincts immediately kicked in. "Where is he?"

"Come, I'll introduce you."

Offering his arm, Harrison smiled as Evelyn gracefully linked hers through it. Together, they moved through the glittering crowd toward their target.

"Mr. Whitmore, Ms. Carter."

Matthias was the first to greet them as they approached. As two of the most prominent rising stars in the business world, their reputation preceded them.

Harrison gave a polite nod. "Mr. Thornton, it's a pleasure."

Matthias extended his hand enthusiastically. "The honor is mine, Mr. Whitmore."

He then gestured to the man beside him. "Wesley, allow me to introduce Mr. Whitmore and Ms. Carter."

Though Evelyn had never met Wesley Fairfax before, there was something oddly familiar about his features.

Evelyn tilted her head slightly. "And this is...?"

Matthias quickly explained, "Ms. Carter, this is our company's top content creator, Wesley Fairfax."

The introduction clicked in Evelyn's mind - Wesley was the viral sensation who had recently taken Byte Innovations by storm.

"A pleasure to meet you, Mr. Fairfax."

Wesley offered a humble smile and extended his hand. "The honor is all mine, Ms. Carter."

Matthias added modestly, "Ms. Carter, Mr. Whitmore, Wesley is still relatively new to the industry. We appreciate your support as he grows."

Harrison smoothly interjected, "Mr. Thornton, you're too modest. Kingsley Industries is exploring opportunities in short-form content. We'd welcome the chance to collaborate."

Wesley's interest visibly piqued. "Really? You're considering entering our industry, Ms. Carter?"

Evelyn nodded gracefully. "It's an area we're evaluating, though we're still in the early stages of exploration."

Matthias jumped at the opportunity. "Ms. Carter, the short video market shows incredible potential. If you're interested, I'd be happy to provide a detailed market analysis."

Evelyn's professional smile widened. "That would be excellent. Let's schedule a meeting to discuss further."
###Chapter 432 A Hidden Truth Revealed

Evelyn smiled warmly. "Of course, let's arrange a time to discuss this further."

Matthias, however, appeared slightly restless.

Collaborating with Horizon Technologies and Kingsley Industries—two of Sterling Enterprises' most prestigious partners—had been his lifelong ambition.

Moreover, while Byte Technologies showed potential, it still struggled with financial instability.

With the powerful backing of Horizon and Kingsley, Byte's future would be secured beyond doubt.

"Ms. Carter, Mr. Whitmore, since we're all here today, why don't we find a quiet place to discuss potential collaboration?"

Evelyn and Harrison exchanged knowing glances before nodding in agreement.

Matthias immediately took charge. "Wesley, reserve the executive suite at the Grand Marquis. We'll continue our discussion there."

Wesley responded promptly. "Right away, Mr. Thornton."

"Ms. Carter, Mr. Whitmore, I'll see you shortly."

With a courteous bow, Matthias departed with visible enthusiasm.

Yet Evelyn couldn't shake her curiosity. "Harrison, why does Mr. Thornton seem unusually eager about this?"

Harrison explained succinctly, "Byte Technologies is still in its startup phase. Mr. Thornton came today specifically seeking investors."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn. "So we all share mutual interests in this potential partnership."

"Precisely. But Evelyn, are you truly considering entering the short-form video market?"

Her eyes sparkled with determination as she raised an eyebrow. "The industry shows remarkable growth potential. There's no harm in exploring opportunities."

At that moment, Harrison's phone vibrated in his pocket.

He glanced at the screen and his expression darkened immediately before declining the call.

"Evelyn, I need to step out briefly. Wait here for me—don't wander off. I'll return shortly."

Evelyn nodded obediently. "Take your time."

After Harrison left, she surveyed her surroundings.

Her gaze eventually settled on a secluded lounge area.

Unbeknownst to her, Eleanor and Juliette had been observing her movements from across the room, both sharing the same malicious intent.

Seeing Evelyn alone presented the perfect opportunity they'd been waiting for.

Evelyn had just settled onto a plush sofa and sampled some hors d'oeuvres when Eleanor and Juliette positioned themselves directly behind her.

The dim lighting in their corner kept them concealed from Evelyn's notice.

The two women exchanged predatory smiles and prepared to strike when an unexpected figure approached.

"Ms. Carter."

Wesley spoke with professional deference. "I've been looking everywhere for you."

As he spoke, Juliette urgently restrained Eleanor, forcing them both back into their seats.

Juliette's sharp eyes immediately recognized Wesley as the viral content creator currently dominating social media platforms.

She became intensely curious about his connection to Evelyn.

At that precise moment, Juliette witnessed Wesley discreetly pass a hotel keycard to Evelyn. "Ms. Carter, the executive suite is ready. Here's your access."

Evelyn accepted it gracefully. "Thank you."

"My pleasure. I'll take my leave now, Ms. Carter. See you at the hotel."

"Certainly."

As Wesley departed, Juliette's eyes gleamed with discovery while Eleanor sat frozen in shock.
###Chapter 433 Catch Them in the Act

The two women swiftly retreated from their vantage point near the couch.

Juliette Blackwood yanked Eleanor Blackwell into a shadowed alcove. "That hussy has no shame," she hissed. "Booking a hotel room with some internet celebrity in broad daylight."

Eleanor's lips curled in disgust. "Evelyn Carter was always flighty. I can't fathom why Nathan remains infatuated with her. This time, I'll make sure he sees her for what she truly is."

Her fingers trembled as she reached for her phone, but Juliette intercepted her.

"Patience, Mrs. Blackwell," Juliette cautioned. "We must proceed strategically."

Eleanor's face flushed with indignation. "She's absolutely revolting. I won't tolerate this another minute. Nathan needs to witness her depravity firsthand."

Her agitation grew with each passing second.

Recognizing the danger of impulsive action, Juliette confiscated the phone. "Without concrete evidence, we're powerless. Evelyn's cunning - she'll simply deny everything and turn this against us."

The logic momentarily cooled Eleanor's fury. "What do you propose then?"

A predatory smile curved Juliette's lips. "We wait until they're... indisposed. Then we strike."

"Ah, catch them in the act," Eleanor murmured, nodding. "But tell me, who delivered that key card earlier?"

Juliette's eyes gleamed. "Some penniless influencer with millions of obsessed female followers. If this scandal breaks, his fanbase will tear Evelyn apart."

"The Sterling name won't be tarnished either," Eleanor mused. "She's no longer connected to our family."

After numerous defeats at Evelyn's hands, Eleanor craved absolute certainty. "Perhaps we shouldn't handle this personally. A third party would be... cleaner."

"Do you have someone in mind?"

Eleanor's smile turned cryptic as she dialed a number. The hushed conversation lasted mere minutes.

"Consider it handled," she announced upon returning. "Evelyn won't slip through our fingers this time."

Juliette's admiration was palpable. "Your resourcefulness never ceases to amaze, Mrs. Blackwell. She doesn't stand a chance."

Eleanor basked in the flattery before offering her reward. "That government land parcel you're pursuing for real estate development - I have connections. Consider it yours."

Juliette's breath hitched. Securing that prime urban development land would catapult the Blackwood Group to new heights. Finally, she'd surpass Evelyn.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had polished off an entire box of hors d'oeuvres while waiting. Thirty minutes had lapsed with no sign of Harrison Whitmore.

She grabbed her clutch and ventured into the hallway.

There stood Harrison, his expression stormy as he barked into his phone. Whatever news he received had clearly displeased him.
###Chapter 434 The Digital Gold Rush

Harrison Whitmore spotted Evelyn Carter standing not far away and quickly spoke into his phone. "We'll discuss this when I return. That's all for now."

He ended the call abruptly.

Approaching Evelyn, Harrison flashed a charming smile. "Evie, where are you headed?"

Evelyn held up a keycard with a playful flick of her wrist. "Mr. Thornton has everything arranged. Are you finished here? Let's head over."

"Of course."

As Harrison responded, his gaze darted suspiciously behind Evelyn. The hallway was deserted.

His expression darkened. "Evie, go ahead. Wait for me by the elevators."

Evelyn tilted her head. "Is something wrong, Harrison?"

"Nothing important. Go on ahead." He gave her a reassuring nod.

She followed his line of sight. "What are you looking at?"

Instead of answering, Harrison strode forward, scanning the area. Finding nothing, he exhaled sharply.

"Must've been my imagination."

Though puzzled, Evelyn didn't press further.

As they crossed to the luxury hotel opposite, a crouching figure clutching a camera finally dared to breathe.

—

Wesley Fairfax waited dutifully at the hotel entrance per Matthias Thornton's instructions. Despite his rising fame as a content creator, he remained an employee at heart.

The boss's orders were law.

Spotting Evelyn and Harrison, Wesley hurried forward. "Ms. Carter, Mr. Whitmore! Mr. Thornton is already upstairs."

"Then let's not keep him waiting."

Wesley ushered them inside, even pressing the elevator button with practiced efficiency. None noticed the camera lens capturing their every move.

—

In the penthouse suite, Matthias Thornton gestured to his assistant, who produced sleek portfolios. "Mr. Whitmore, Ms. Carter - these highlight Byte Technologies' most successful short video initiatives. Please review."

The assistant presented the documents with both hands.

Evelyn opened hers with genuine interest.

Though new to digital content creation, the palpable excitement surrounding this industry convinced her of its potential.

Wesley eagerly explained the basics.

"Ms. Carter, you could create a Byte account to share snippets of your life. I've had one for months, though I've never posted."

"Consistency is key. Regular uploads trigger the algorithm to push your content."

"When viewers engage longer, the system amplifies your reach exponentially. That's how unknown creators suddenly go viral."

Evelyn nodded thoughtfully.

"Once you build substantial followers, you can monetize through live-stream shopping."

Matthias interjected with visible pride.

"Don't underestimate live commerce, Ms. Carter. During our last mega sale, Wesley here generated $200M in gross merchandise volume during a single eight-hour stream."

Two hundred million? From one broadcast?

The staggering figure made Evelyn's eyebrows climb.

"Naturally, only top-tier creators achieve those numbers. But even mid-level influencers regularly clear six figures per session."

Evelyn's lips parted slightly. Traditional businesses might need quarters to achieve what digital creators accomplished in hours.

The realization struck like lightning - this wasn't just an emerging industry.

This was a gold rush.
###Chapter 435 Rough Outline

Two hours slipped by before their discussion with Matthias concluded.

As they stepped out of the hotel, Matthias still wore a hint of reluctance. "Ms. Carter, Mr. Whitmore, if Kingsley Industries ever considers collaborating with Byte, my door is always open."

"Of course, Mr. Thornton. Let's wrap things up for today."

"Certainly, Mr. Whitmore, Ms. Carter. Goodbye."

Once Matthias was out of earshot, Evelyn turned to Harrison, her gaze heavy with unspoken thoughts.

But before she could voice them, Harrison already knew. His voice was soft. "Thinking about diving into the media industry?"

A smile tugged at Evelyn's lips as she nodded. "It's still emerging, but the potential is massive. Kingsley Industries could test the waters—launch an artist division, scout promising streamers, build an operations team, and create an account..."

Her enthusiasm spilled over as she spoke, her mind already sketching a rough blueprint.

Finally, she couldn't resist asking, "Harrison, what do you think?"

"It's solid. Ready for execution."

Evelyn beamed, satisfaction lighting up her face. "Then we'll present it at the board meeting next Monday. If half the executives approve, we move forward immediately."

She had found a new spark. Back at home, she worked tirelessly for days, refining a detailed feasibility plan for the company's expansion.

Monday arrived swiftly. Despite the sleepless nights, Evelyn strode into Kingsley Industries at 9:00 AM, energy crackling around her like static.

"Ms. Carter, the board members are all here. They're waiting for you to begin," Maxwell murmured, keeping pace beside her.

Evelyn gave a quiet hum. "I'll head in now."

The conference room buzzed with rare liveliness.

The company's top brass had clearly caught wind of something big—everyone had arrived punctually.

Even Julian, who seldom attended executive meetings, had shown up. The significance of this gathering was undeniable.

"It's almost 9:00. Where is Ms. Carter?"

"Even Mr. Kingsley never kept us waiting like this."

"Someone should check when she's arriving."

Murmurs of impatience rippled through the room.

Then, the door swung open. Maxwell stepped aside, and Evelyn entered with a composed smile.

Instant silence.

Reaching the head of the table, she spoke with polished courtesy. "My apologies for the delay."

The executives' irritation dissolved under her calm authority. No one dared to protest.

Evelyn swept a glance across the room before taking her seat.

At that moment, Maxwell distributed the freshly printed documents.

"Everyone, what you're holding is the feasibility plan for Kingsley Industries' new venture in the latter half of the year."

"Today's meeting marks the first discussion on this project. Feel free to raise any questions. Afterward, we'll proceed to a vote."

With that, the executives flipped open their files.

One by one, surprise flickered across their faces. Hushed exchanges broke out.

"Ms. Carter, what is this?" someone finally asked. "Is Kingsley Industries venturing into short-form video?"
###Chapter 436 The Unexpected Move

Evelyn Carter gave a firm nod, her voice clear as crystal. "In today's digital age, short-form video platforms are exploding in popularity."

She tapped the presentation screen for emphasis. "While Kingsley Industries hasn't ventured into this space before, this represents a golden opportunity for diversification—"

Before she could finish, Julian Hawthorne slammed his folder onto the mahogany conference table with a loud thud.

"I strongly object, Ms. Carter."

The abrupt interruption sent murmurs rippling through the boardroom.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Do you have concerns, Director Hawthorne?"

Julian's lips curled into a mocking smile. "Kingsley has built its reputation on cutting-edge technology - quantum computing, biomedical innovations, rare earth extraction."

He leaned forward, his gold cufflinks glinting. "These are our specialties. Our proven successes. And now you want us to gamble on some fleeting social media trend?" His gaze sharpened. "Tell me, Ms. Carter, what's your success rate projection?"

His words ignited a chorus of agreement. "Director Hawthorne makes a valid point," chimed in another board member. "Diversifying into unfamiliar territory could damage our brand credibility."

"Perhaps reconsider this impulsive decision," added a silver-haired woman, adjusting her glasses. "The media sector is notoriously volatile."

A heavyset man in an expensive suit interjected, "If we're discussing investments, commercial real estate shows far more stability. The new downtown development zone—"

The debate grew heated, opinions clashing like waves against rocks.

Julian lounged back in his chair, the picture of smug satisfaction, watching the dissent spread.

When the arguments reached their peak, he delivered his final blow. "Ms. Carter, the board has spoken. Stick to what we know. That property development proposal sounds far more promising than chasing internet fads."

All eyes turned to Evelyn, anticipating her retreat.

But the young CEO remained unshaken, her composure steel.

She steepled her fingers. "Since real estate seems to be the popular choice, let me ask this: Are we building homes or speculating on property bubbles?"

Her question struck like a lightning bolt.

Government regulations were tightening around the housing market - everyone knew this, though some chose willful ignorance.

"Ms. Carter, property will always hold value," argued one director.

"Land is the safest long-term investment," insisted another.

"Why take unnecessary risks when we have proven business models?"

The resistance was palpable, the fear of change thick in the air.

Julian's smirk widened. This should be good.

Then Evelyn did something unexpected.

She laughed.

A rich, confident sound that silenced the room.

"Who said we'd be starting from scratch?"

The board members exchanged confused glances.

At that precise moment, the conference room doors swung open.
###Chapter 437 Reassurance

The conference room doors swung open dramatically.

Julian Hartwell strode in, his tailored navy suit accentuating his broad shoulders. His agent followed half a step behind. The collective gasp from the board members was audible.

"Why is Julian Hartwell here?"

Murmurs spread like wildfire. The youngest Kingsley brother was a global superstar with a social media following that could crash servers with a single post. His presence here made no sense.

Samuel Walker's face darkened instantly. His fingers tightened around his pen until his knuckles turned white. This wasn't part of the plan.

Julian moved with effortless grace toward Evelyn Carter. Their shared smile spoke volumes. The warmth in his eyes when he looked at his sister was unmistakable.

"Julian."

He acknowledged her with a subtle nod before turning to address the room. "Good afternoon, everyone." His voice carried the smooth confidence of someone used to commanding attention.

One of the senior executives couldn't contain his curiosity. "Mr. Hartwell, with all due respect, you've never shown interest in Kingsley Industries' affairs before. What brings you here today?"

Julian's lips quirked. "Excellent question. I understand Kingsley is launching an entertainment division today." He paused for effect. "Consider me your first signed artist."

The room erupted.

Julian Hartwell wasn't just any celebrity. He was a triple threat - actor, singer, and producer with box office records to his name. His endorsement alone could make or break brands.

"You can't be serious."

"Deadly serious." Julian shrugged. "I've maintained creative control over my career until now. Signing with Kingsley represents a strategic shift for me." His gaze swept the room. "Assuming, of course, the division gets approved today."

The implication hung heavy in the air.

Julian hadn't come to join Kingsley Industries. He'd come to back Evelyn's bold new venture into digital media.

With his star power behind it, the new division wouldn't just succeed - it would dominate.

The mood in the room shifted palpably.

"This media initiative shows remarkable foresight. Digital content is where the market's heading."

"We'd be fools not to capitalize on this emerging sector."

"Traditional models are becoming obsolete. This is exactly the kind of innovation we need."

"Ms. Carter's proposal has my full support. With Mr. Hartwell onboard, success is practically guaranteed."

Samuel's face flushed crimson with suppressed rage. His carefully laid plans were unraveling before his eyes.

Evelyn had played her trump card - and it was a royal flush. Julian's surprise appearance hadn't just swayed the board; it had cemented her position beyond challenge.
###Chapter 438 The Tides Turn

The atmosphere in the boardroom shifted instantly.

One by one, the executives began nodding in agreement with Evelyn's proposal.

"Mr. Hawthorne, what's your stance on this matter?" Evelyn turned her piercing gaze toward Julian.

Julian forced a tight-lipped smile, his fingers drumming nervously on the table. "Given the overwhelming support for your proposal, Ms. Carter, I can hardly object. The talent division seems like a sound investment."

Evelyn's lips curved in satisfaction. "Excellent. Let's proceed with a formal vote then."

Glances were exchanged across the mahogany table before hands started rising in unanimous approval.

Even Julian couldn't resist adding some levity. "As a minor shareholder of Kingsley Industries, I believe my vote counts as well." With a dramatic flourish, he raised his hand.

The final tally exceeded all expectations.

Evelyn beamed. "With more than two-thirds majority approval, the talent division is officially approved. Kingsley Industries enters a new era today."

Applause erupted through the conference room.

As attendees filed out, Julian caught Evelyn's arm playfully. "So, Evie, how'd I do?" His eyes sparkled with mischief.

Evelyn gave him an appreciative smile. "Brilliantly. You silenced those stuffy old board members. Without you, this never would've passed so smoothly."

"Does that make me your knight in shining armor?"

Laughing, Evelyn linked arms with him. "Absolutely. But Julian, are you truly serious about signing your management contract with us?"

He tapped her forehead affectionately. "Do I ever joke about business matters?"

Evelyn rubbed her head in mock protest. "Ouch! Though I suppose it's worth the pain."

"You ridiculous girl. Just remember - I expect VIP treatment. After all, I'm currently your only A-list artist."

"Of course!" Evelyn nodded vigorously. "You'll be our crown jewel. Every resource at our disposal will be dedicated to you. The entire company will revolve around your career."

Julian chuckled, feigning reluctance. "Well, if I'm going to be this spoiled, I suppose I can't refuse."

"Thank you, Julian."

"Don't be silly. Being needed by you... it's rather flattering actually."

For Julian, this was simply business - but helping Evelyn in the process made it all the sweeter.

Meanwhile, across town, Juliette and Eleanor were poring over freshly developed photographs.

"Are these all we have?" Juliette flipped through the stack with a frown. "The quality is decent, but they're not particularly damning."

Harrison's presence in several shots complicated matters - clearly indicating Evelyn and Wesley hadn't been alone at the hotel.

The situation wasn't nearly as scandalous as they'd hoped.

Eleanor wrung her hands. "Was this entire operation pointless?"

Just then, Juliette's fingers stilled on one particular shot - a perfectly framed image of Evelyn and Wesley that, at first glance, appeared quite intimate.

A slow smile spread across Juliette's face. "Pointless? Hardly, Mrs. Blackwell."
###Chapter 439 Unexpected Twist

Juliette Blackwood waved the photograph triumphantly. "This single image is enough to destroy Evelyn Carter's reputation completely."

Eleanor Blackwell examined the photo with a satisfied smirk. "In that case, let's watch Evelyn burn. I want to see how those mindless fans tear her apart."

"Don't worry, I'll contact the media immediately. By tonight, this picture will be trending across every social platform!"

Eleanor gave a cold laugh. "Perfect."

True to their word, a series of compromising photos began circulating online that afternoon.

The images exploded across the internet like wildfire.

"Streamer's Secret Affair With Billionaire Heiress" - the sensational headline dominated trending lists within hours, igniting a social media firestorm.

"Oh my God! Is this real? Wesley Fairfax is dating Evelyn Carter from the Kingsley family?"

"What's happening here? A Kingsley heiress involved with a gaming streamer?"

"Wesley hit the jackpot! The Kingsley fortune is worth billions!"

"Wait... my future husband is dating Evelyn Carter?"

"They're both single adults. What's the problem?"

"Honestly... if it were anyone else I'd be jealous. But Evelyn Carter? She's such a worthy opponent. I can only give them my blessing."

"Same here! They make a perfect couple!"

"Agreed!"

"My full support!"

Natalie Reeves was speechless.

As a seasoned publicist, Natalie was among the first to spot the trending story. At first, she thought her eyes were deceiving her. She'd even rubbed them and refreshed her feed repeatedly.

But when she confirmed the woman in the photos was indeed Evelyn, panic set in. She immediately dialed Evelyn's number.

"Evelyn, what's going on with these photos circulating online?"

Evelyn sounded genuinely confused. "What photos?"

Natalie kept it brief. "You need to see this yourself. Someone leaked photos of you and Wesley Fairfax meeting privately. It's everywhere."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Private meeting with Wesley? When had that ever happened?

Evelyn quickly opened Twitter. Sure enough, her name and Wesley's topped the trending list.

She clicked through to find photos from that night at the hotel with Harrison Whitmore - except Harrison had been conveniently cropped out, leaving only her and Wesley in frame.

The photographer had chosen angles masterfully. To any casual observer, the images suggested an intimate relationship between them.

"Did you see them? What's going on?" Natalie's concerned voice came through the speaker.

Evelyn sighed in frustration. "It's all a misunderstanding! I wasn't alone with Wesley. Harrison Whitmore and Matthias Thornton from Byte Technologies were both there. We were discussing a business collaboration."

Understanding dawned on Natalie. "So you've been set up. This is sloppy work, but the public reaction is... unexpected."

Evelyn scrolled through the comments, her eyebrows rising in astonishment.

A popular streamer like Wesley should have legions of protective fans. Yet instead of attacking her, they were unanimously supporting the supposed relationship.

"I don't understand this either," Evelyn admitted helplessly.
###Chapter 440 Unfazed by the Spotlight

Evelyn Carter tapped her manicured nails against the marble countertop. "If we let this rumor continue circulating, won't it essentially confirm my supposed relationship with Wesley?"

Her phone buzzed with an incoming message.

The screen illuminated her suddenly stormy expression.

Natalie Reeves leaned forward. "If you don't issue a denial, the public will take this as confirmation of your involvement with Wesley. But honestly..." A sly smile curved her lips. "This could work in your favor."

She gestured excitedly. "You're launching your new lifestyle brand next month! This viral moment could give you incredible exposure—"

"Absolutely not." Evelyn's refusal came sharp as shattered glass.

Her gaze remained locked on Wesley's text—nearly identical to Natalie's suggestion. As a digital creator, Wesley understood the value of capitalizing on trending topics. Their "scandal" had exploded across every platform, and while they barely knew each other, riding this wave seemed like smart business to him.

But Evelyn had other priorities. "Natalie, draft a statement. I want this shut down in ten minutes."

Natalie's eyebrows shot up. "Someone's worried about Harrison getting the wrong idea."

A soft hum of confirmation.

"Damn, Evie." Natalie whistled. "You're really passing up this golden opportunity just to avoid upsetting your man?"

In an era where influencers would stage car crashes for clout, Evelyn's refusal to exploit the situation was practically revolutionary.

Natalie's fingers flew across her tablet. "Honestly? I respect it. No relationship is worth compromising for cheap publicity." She paused, frown deepening. "Wait... these photos weren't leaked. This was orchestrated."

The telltale signs were everywhere—the strategic cropping, the coordinated posting times, the army of suspiciously similar fan accounts. As a PR expert, Natalie recognized a media play when she saw one.

"We need to find out who's pulling the strings."

—

Juliette Blackwood's phone nearly cracked under her grip.

She and Eleanor had expected Evelyn to be torn apart by Wesley's rabid fanbase. Instead, 80% of the comments were shipping the "adorable power couple."

"Are these people blind?" Juliette shrieked. "She must be paying for bots! There's no way—"

Eleanor's hands trembled. "This backfired spectacularly. And if Nathan finds out we—"

A chill ran down her spine. The consequences didn't bear thinking about.
###Chapter 441 The Tables Turned

Juliette moved closer and grasped Eleanor's trembling hand. "Relax. This stays between us. Nathan will never discover your involvement as long as I remain silent."

Eleanor's breath came in shallow gasps. She knew how protective Nathan was of Evelyn - he'd explicitly warned her multiple times against provoking his wife.

But this time, she'd gone too far.

"Juliette, you must swear to keep this secret!"

The designer smiled knowingly. "Madam Blackwell, the photographer's payment came from my personal account. Even if Nathan investigates, the trail leads only to me."

Eleanor clutched her pearls as relief washed over her.

"Excellent. That's perfect."

"However..."

Juliette hesitated dramatically. "You did promise to help with that waterfront property transfer."

"That's nothing, darling." Eleanor waved a dismissive hand. "Consider it done."

Juliette's smile widened as she linked arms with the older woman. "You're too kind, Madam Blackwell!"

Eleanor exhaled sharply. Compared to Nathan discovering she'd orchestrated Evelyn's paparazzi scandal, a simple land transfer seemed trivial.

——

Evelyn issued a personal statement debunking the rumors with Wesley.

She supplemented it with hotel surveillance footage clearly showing four individuals entering and exiting the suite.

The public quickly realized their mistake.

"What a letdown! I was shipping them so hard."
"Wesley deserves a queen, not workplace rumors."
"Honestly though, Ms. Carter and Wesley would make a stunning couple. Someone make this happen!"
"Are you blind? That man beside Ms. Carter is clearly her equal. Look at how he carries himself!"
"Right? That mysterious hottie could be Hollywood royalty. The way they stand together..."
"Do we finally have confirmation about Ms. Carter's mystery man?"
"The people demand answers!"

Public interest skyrocketed, shifting focus entirely to Evelyn and Harrison.

Even Natalie seemed surprised.

"Talk about a plot twist! Evelyn, you and Harrison look positively married in that blurry shot. The internet's obsessed."

Evelyn skimmed the comments with mild amusement. "As long as they're not harassing Wesley, I don't care."

"Wow, playing favorites much?" Natalie teased, genuinely pleased to see her friend moving forward.

The shadows of Evelyn's past finally seemed to be fading. This was the fresh start she deserved.
###Chapter 442 Out of Reach

"I did some digging, and it seems someone paid to spread those vicious rumors about you and Wesley."

"Any idea who's behind it?"

"Not yet, but I'll find out who dared to pull such a low move."

Natalie's voice was firm, then she added playfully, "Though I have to say, the public isn't completely clueless. At least they focused on the right details."

"By the way, Evelyn, why don't we invite Harrison for drinks tonight?"

Evelyn thought it was a great idea. "Sure, I'll text him."

She opened her chat with Harrison. Their conversation had gone silent since last night, and unease flickered in her eyes.

They had been texting daily without fail—until now. The longest gap before had been mere hours. But today was different.

A full night had passed without a reply.

Her fingers flew across the screen as she sent another message.

She waited. One minute. Five. Ten. Half an hour ticked by.

Still nothing.

"Natalie, is it normal for someone who usually replies instantly to just... disappear?"

Natalie raised an eyebrow, glancing at Evelyn's phone. "Wait, Harrison hasn't responded yet?"

Evelyn nodded, her stomach twisting with unease.

"It's fine. I'll just call him."

She dialed his number.

The robotic voice on the other end made her freeze. "The number you have dialed is currently unavailable."

"Unavailable?"

Natalie quickly reassured her. "Don't panic. He's probably tied up with something. Don't overthink it."

Evelyn hummed, trying to convince herself Natalie was right.

"I'll try again tonight."

Natalie sighed. "Love really changes you. Relax! Harrison isn't going anywhere. He'll reply the second he sees your message."

"I hope so."

Hearing Evelyn's dejection, Natalie suggested, "Since Harrison's busy, let's invite Olivia instead. The three of us can still have fun."

"Okay."

—

That evening, the trio gathered.

But Evelyn was distracted. Her phone had been silent all afternoon.

Not a single notification.

She stood abruptly. "You two go ahead. I need to check on something."

Natalie and Olivia exchanged glances, but Evelyn was already out the door.

She drove straight to Horizon Technologies.

The offices were closed. Evelyn approached a security guard. "Excuse me, has Mr. Whitmore been in today?"

The guard eyed her skeptically. Women showing up asking about Harrison wasn't unusual. Today alone, there'd been at least half a dozen.

He'd long since stopped being surprised.
###Chapter 443 An Unexpected Encounter

The security guard gave a polite but firm response. "I'm not privy to Mr. Whitmore's personal affairs. But miss, let me warn you - Mr. Whitmore isn't someone to be taken lightly. I'd advise against getting any ideas about him."

Evelyn stood speechless.

Just as she was about to respond, the sharp honk of a car horn interrupted her thoughts.

Turning around, Evelyn spotted Nathan's sleek black Mercedes parked at the curb. The door swung open and he emerged, his long strides carrying him toward her with purpose.

"Evelyn? What brings you here?" His deep voice held a note of surprise.

"That's my line," she countered smoothly.

Nathan had been driving past when he caught sight of her familiar silhouette. His gaze lifted to the gleaming sign above them - "Horizon Technologies" - and something dark flickered in his eyes.

"Are you here to see Harrison?" The question came out sharper than intended, jealousy coloring his tone as he searched her face for answers.

But Evelyn remained impassive. "Mr. Sterling, that's my personal business and none of your concern."

One sentence. That's all it took to draw an unmistakable line between them.

Undeterred, Nathan pressed on. "It's getting late. Let me drive you home - it's not safe for you to be out alone."

Evelyn instinctively shook her head, jingling her car keys. "No need. I have my own transportation."

She turned toward her vehicle, but Nathan caught up in two quick strides.

"Evelyn, do you despise me that much?"

A careless smile played on her lips. "Mr. Sterling, you're imagining things. I simply don't wish to inconvenience you."

With that final dismissal, she walked away without looking back.

Nathan stood rooted to the spot, watching until her taillights disappeared around the corner.

Moments later, his phone buzzed violently in his pocket. The call lasted less than a minute, but by the time he hung up, his expression had turned thunderous.

"I'll handle this personally."

The twenty-minute drive to Sterling Manor took him eight. Tires screeched as he pulled into the circular driveway.

"Mr. Sterling, you're home!" A flustered housekeeper rushed to greet him.

"Where's my mother?" The ice in his voice made the woman shrink back.

"Madam is... upstairs."

Nathan stormed past without another word.

Upstairs, Eleanor heard the commotion below. She stepped out of her suite just as Nathan reached the landing.

"Nathan! You're back early. Have you eaten? I'll have the kitchen—"

"Save it." The words cut through her greeting like a knife.

Eleanor froze, suddenly aware of the dangerous energy radiating from her son.

"Well... if you're not hungry, you should rest. It's been a long day." She turned to retreat to her room.

"Wait!"

The single word stopped her cold. A shiver ran down Eleanor's spine.

"Y-yes? Was there something else?" Her voice trembled.
###Chapter 444 I Am Your Mother

Nathan's piercing gaze locked onto Eleanor as he demanded in an icy tone, "Mother, is there nothing you wish to confess to me?"

Eleanor staggered backward, her manicured fingers clutching the banister for support.

"I... I don't understand what you mean," she stammered, her voice trembling.

Nathan advanced with predatory grace, cornering her against the wall. "Do you truly not comprehend the gravity of your actions?"

"You know?" Eleanor's entire body shook as she squeezed her eyes shut, consumed by terror.

"It... it wasn't intentional! That insufferable Evelyn kept flaunting herself. I merely wanted to put her in her place."

Nathan's hand shot out like lightning, gripping her wrist. "What did you just say? What have you done to Evelyn?"

Eleanor blinked in confusion. "Isn't this what you were referring to?"

A humorless laugh escaped Nathan as he released her arm. "It appears you've been keeping far more secrets than I imagined."

"No! Nathan, please listen—"

"Enough!" His voice cracked like a whip. "I've warned you repeatedly not to provoke Evelyn."

Terror gripped Eleanor as she desperately clung to his sleeve. "I made a mistake! Give me another chance—I swear I won't—"

Nathan peeled her fingers away one by one, his expression glacial. "Effective immediately, all your credit cards will be frozen. You'll receive nothing beyond basic living expenses."

"You can't do this! How will I survive?"

Eleanor's extravagant lifestyle had left her unprepared for financial restrictions. The thought of budgeting made her physically ill.

"I'm your mother! Blood should come before some outsider like Evelyn!" She clung to him like a drowning woman, until an authoritative voice cut through the tension.

"No true mother would behave as you have!"

Margaret stood framed in the doorway, her regal presence commanding immediate respect.

"Grandmother." Nathan's demeanor softened noticeably. He'd always held deep reverence for the family matriarch.

Margaret nodded before turning her disapproving gaze on Eleanor. "You've acted foolishly, daughter."

"Mother, please! Intercede for me!" Eleanor begged, dropping to her knees. "Make Nathan see reason!"

Margaret sighed heavily. "For three years, Evelyn devoted herself to our family. Tell me, what daughter-in-law could compare?"

"But you and Vanessa constantly made her life difficult at every turn."

"I only thought her unworthy of our name! I wanted to protect Nathan's future—"

"And now?" Margaret arched a silver eyebrow.

Eleanor hung her head in shame. With Evelyn's true identity revealed, she knew the young woman was the ideal match for Nathan.

Yet her wounded pride had driven her to petty vengeance.

"Mother, she's already divorced Nathan."

Margaret's cane struck the marble floor with a sharp crack. "How dare you! Had you shown her basic kindness, their marriage might have survived."
###Chapter 445 Hollow Apologies

Eleanor stood frozen, her lips trembling under Margaret's stern gaze.

"You show no remorse. Instead, you're digging yourself deeper. You've single-handedly destroyed any chance they had."

Margaret's voice carried decades of disappointment as she turned to Nathan. "Do what you must, my boy. I stand with you. Your mother was wrong. But blood remains blood. Remember your manners."

The matriarch's sigh seemed to age her ten years before their eyes.

"Grandmother—"

Margaret silenced him with a raised hand, her retreating figure unusually frail.

Nathan's glacial stare pinned Eleanor in place.

"I know I've made mistakes," Eleanor whispered, twisting her hands. "I see that now."

The silence stretched like barbed wire between them.

"That land purchase for Juliette," Nathan finally spoke, each word sharp as shattered glass. "Did you use the Sterling name?"

Eleanor's breath hitched. Understanding dawned slowly. "Is that why you came today?"

Nathan ignored her question. "Do you even know who Juliette Blackwood truly is?"

When he leaned close to whisper those damning words, Eleanor collapsed like a marionette with cut strings.

Nathan didn't glance back as he strode away, leaving his mother sprawled on the marble floor.

Her anguished wails echoed through the grand foyer. "Impossible! This can't be happening!"

A butler materialized at her side. "Madam Blackwell, Mr. Sterling requests your immediate packing. The jet awaits to take you to Astana."

Eleanor scrambled backward. "No! Not Astana! I won't go back to that cursed place!"

Below, Nathan stood immobile in the courtyard, Eleanor's screams washing over him like rain against stone. His phone was already at his ear.

"Simon. I need you."

"At your service, Mr. Sterling."

"Pull all transaction records between Eleanor Blackwell and Juliette Blackwood. Every hidden account, every shell company."

A sharp inhale. "Sir, you're asking me to investigate Madam Sterling's private—"

"Email the findings directly to me." The call ended with finality.

Nathan took one last look at the gilded cage he'd called home before walking away without hesitation.

Dawn found Nathan slumped in his car, the ashtray overflowing. His bloodshot eyes tracked movement through the tinted windows.

Juliette's surprised gasp carried through the morning air as he emerged from the vehicle.

"Nathan? What are you—"

"Where are you headed so early?" His voice roughened by smoke and sleeplessness.

Juliette's smile turned feline. "Sterling Enterprises finally secured that waterfront parcel. Off to sign the paperwork." She tilted her head. "Since when do you care about my schedule?"
###Chapter 446 Were Even

Nathan gave a slight nod, his voice cool and detached. "Diana, the real estate market is unstable right now. Major policy changes are coming. Your impulsive investment could leave you financially stranded."

Juliette's lips curved into a wider smile, though her eyes remained icy.

She tilted her head mockingly. "Nathan, is this really about the market? Or are you just protecting Evelyn? Afraid I'll build Sterling Enterprises into something that could rival Kingsley Industries?"

His expression didn't flicker. "You could never be her equal."

Juliette's face darkened, but before she could retort, Nathan produced a thick folder from his briefcase.

"At least she doesn't resort to petty schemes like you."

He shoved the documents across the table, the sharp edge catching her wrist. She winced.

"The leaked photos. The online smear campaign. All your doing, wasn't it?"

Juliette hadn't expected him to uncover her involvement so quickly, but she maintained her composure.

She knew he wouldn't act against her - not with Eleanor's influence protecting her.

"Did you come here just to accuse me? Fine, I did it. But Eleanor was involved too. Would the great Nathan Sterling really go against his own family for a woman?"

Nathan's eyes darkened dangerously. The silence stretched between them.

Juliette scoffed and gathered her purse. "Since you won't do anything, don't waste my time. I have government officials waiting to finalize our contract."

As she turned to leave, Nathan's voice stopped her cold.

"Eleanor may have secured that land deal for you." His lips curled into a humorless smile. "But I can make it disappear just as easily. Don't you think?"

Panic flashed across Juliette's face. "Nathan, we've known each other for years. Must you be so cruel?"

He shook his head, almost regretful. "I came to warn you as a courtesy. But you're determined to ignore reason. Consider the Blackwell family's debt to the Delaneys repaid. We're even now."

"Nathan!"

He was already walking away. "Think carefully about your next moves, Ms. Delaney."

Juliette watched his retreating figure, her nails digging into her palms. She refused to believe his warnings - convinced this was just another ploy to protect Evelyn.

"You'll regret this," she hissed under her breath. "I'll make sure Evelyn Carter crawls at my feet!"

Evelyn woke with a start, sneezing violently several times in succession. Rubbing her nose, she checked her temperature.

"No fever," she murmured. "Must be allergies."

Marien appeared in the doorway, concern etching her features. "Ms. Carter, are you unwell?"

Evelyn waved her off. "Just the season changing. Nothing serious."

"Let me prepare some ginger tea for you."

After Marien left, Evelyn reached for her phone. The screen remained stubbornly blank - no new messages. A familiar ache settled in her chest as she stared at the empty notification panel.
###Chapter 447 She Barely Knows Him

Evelyn's fingers hovered over her phone screen, lost in thought.

"Ms. Carter, your ginger tea is ready. It's best when hot."

Britley's voice snapped Evelyn back to reality. She straightened her posture. "Just set it there, thank you."

"Of course."

As Britley turned to leave, Evelyn suddenly spoke. "Britley... if someone suddenly becomes unreachable, could it mean something's wrong?"

The experienced housekeeper took one look at Evelyn's troubled expression and understood immediately. "Ms. Evelyn, this is about Mr. Whitmore, isn't it?"

Heat rushed to Evelyn's cheeks at being so transparent.

"Britley, you—"

The older woman smiled knowingly. "You've mentioned Mr. Whitmore several times this week. Even an old woman like me couldn't miss it."

Evelyn's blush deepened. "That's not what I meant!"

Britley patted her hand reassuringly. "Don't worry, dear. If Mr. Whitmore hasn't contacted you, he's likely occupied with business. He'll reach out when he can."

"You really think so?"

The uncertainty in Evelyn's voice surprised even herself. She hadn't realized how much Harrison's silence affected her.

"Absolutely, Ms. Evelyn. Don't dwell on it. The car will arrive shortly to take you to the office."

Evelyn nodded, some tension leaving her shoulders. "Thank you, Britley."

With a final smile, Britley exited. Evelyn rose from bed and scrolled through her contacts, searching for anyone who might have information about Harrison.

Her fingers stilled. A realization struck her - she knew disturbingly little about the man who'd occupied her thoughts all morning.

Evelyn struggled to focus during her morning meetings.

Maxwell cleared his throat. "Ms. Carter? Your thoughts on this proposal? How should we proceed?"

She blinked. "Pardon?"

Adjusting his glasses, Maxwell handed her the documents. "You seem distracted today."

Evelyn flipped through the pages, schooling her expression. "Nonsense."

Maxwell saw right through her. "Is something troubling you?"

"Nothing at all! Let's proceed with the project as planned." She signed the documents with practiced efficiency.

"Understood, Ms. Carter."

After Maxwell left, Evelyn stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, taking a steadying breath. The office door swung open again.

"Maxwell, was there something else?"

Julian arched an eyebrow. "Not Maxwell. Just me."

Evelyn turned, her face brightening. "Julian! What brings you here?"

He flashed a mysterious grin. "I've got a surprise for you."

Her curiosity piqued. "What kind of surprise?"

Julian clapped his hands dramatically. "Come in!"

A young woman entered, offering a polite smile. "Hello, I'm Katherine Whitaker."

Evelyn shot Julian a questioning look. "What's this about?"

He shrugged casually. "Now that Kingsley Industries has launched its talent division, we need fresh faces."

"Katherine here is my junior. She just wrapped a hit web series and her previous contract expired."
###Chapter 448 The Knowing Smile

Evelyn's eyes widened with sudden understanding. "Julian, are you suggesting we bring Katherine into Kingsley Industries?"

Julian gave a confirming nod. "That's precisely my thought."

Evelyn nodded but remained silent.

It was common knowledge in the industry that established actresses like Katherine, who already had fame and recognition, were difficult acquisitions for any company. After all, an actress only became profitable after gaining substantial popularity.

Yet here was Katherine, willingly offering to join Kingsley Industries.

"Ms. Carter, am I not welcome?" Katherine teased lightly.

"Of course you are! It would be an honor to have someone of your caliber join us, Ms. Whitaker."

"I'm looking forward to our collaboration!"

Katherine's gaze drifted to Julian standing beside her. The adoration in her eyes was unmistakable - any woman would recognize that look.

Evelyn understood immediately. This wasn't purely a career move for Katherine. There were other motives at play here.

Just as Evelyn was about to speak, her phone rang, interrupting the moment.

She glanced at the screen, and a flicker of disappointment crossed her features when she saw the caller ID.

After a brief hesitation, she answered. "Sophia? What's up?"

Evelyn couldn't help but glance at Julian and Katherine as she spoke.

"I heard you've established a talent division. You must have several rising stars needing sponsorships now?"

Evelyn chuckled. "I'm surprised you're so well-informed about our company developments, given how discreet you usually are."

"VERE happens to be looking for sponsorship opportunities this year. Natalie mentioned your new venture. This isn't a conversation for the phone. Shall we meet in person?"

"Absolutely! I'm at the office now. I'll have Maxwell come down to escort you."

"No need. I know my way around. I'll park in the garage and come up directly."

After hanging up, Evelyn turned to Julian. "Sophia will be here shortly."

Julian remained impassive. "You two can talk. I'll show Katherine around the premises."

Katherine? Evelyn's smile widened, though internally she was seething.

Since when had they become so familiar?

"Then I'll go with Julian. We'll catch up later."

Evelyn maintained a professional smile. "Of course! Go ahead."

Katherine offered a polite smile and turned to leave when Evelyn suddenly stopped Julian.

"Julian, wait. There's something I need to discuss with you."

Without hesitation, Julian murmured to Katherine, "Wait for me outside."

Katherine nodded obediently. "Of course!"

Once Katherine had exited, Evelyn grabbed Julian's arm urgently. "Julian, what exactly is your relationship with Katherine? What's really going on here?"

Julian looked genuinely perplexed as he raised his hands. "Didn't I just explain? She's my junior. She's had contract disputes with her previous agency and barely managed to get released. I saw an opportunity and did her a favor by introducing her to you."

"That's all there is to it?"

Evelyn clearly wasn't convinced. She couldn't forget the way Katherine had looked at him - that tender, affectionate gaze spoke volumes.
###Chapter 449 I Don't Have Feelings for Her

"Evelyn, what exactly are you trying to imply?"

Evelyn didn't mince words. "Julian, you don't have special feelings for her, do you?"

Julian finally understood her insinuation. He chuckled lightly. "Since when did you start meddling in my personal affairs?"

Seeing him evade the question made Evelyn anxious. "You're not developing feelings for Katherine, are you?"

Julian tapped her forehead with his finger. "What nonsense are you thinking? Katherine is merely my junior colleague, nothing beyond that."

Evelyn rubbed her forehead with a pout. "Katherine! You call her so affectionately. How can I be sure you're telling the truth?"

"Evelyn," Julian sighed in exasperation, "what must I say to convince you?"

"I believe you. But others might interpret things differently."

The way Katherine looked at Julian clearly suggested their relationship wasn't purely professional.

"Julian... I..."

"Enough, Evelyn! What are you trying to say?"

Her eyes darted as she gathered courage to ask the question weighing on her mind. "Is there someone you're interested in?"

An uncomfortable silence fell. A flicker of something unreadable passed through Julian's eyes before he schooled his expression.

"No."

His answer came swift and decisive.

Evelyn sighed inwardly for Sophia. All these years she'd watched Sophia harbor feelings for him, while Julian remained oblivious.

"Evelyn, if that's all, I should return to work."

Evelyn nodded. "Go ahead."

As Julian stepped out, he nearly collided with Sophia in the hallway. He paused, his gaze lingering on her.

"You're here too?" Sophia spoke first.

"Here to see Evelyn?"

Sophia nodded, fingers tightening around her bag strap. Without another word, she murmured, "I'll go in now."

She brushed past him, leaving a faint trace of her perfume in the air.

At that moment, Katherine returned from the restroom and immediately latched onto Julian's arm. "Julian, won't you give me a tour of the office?"

Sophia froze mid-step at the sound but didn't turn around. Instead, she knocked firmly on Evelyn's office door.

"Come in!"

Only after the door closed behind Sophia did Julian turn back, staring at the polished wood with an unreadable expression.

Katherine tilted her head curiously. "Julian, what are you looking at?"

Julian abruptly withdrew his arm. "At work, you should address me as Mr. Hartwell."

Katherine's face fell, her hand dropping awkwardly to her side. "Did I do something wrong?"

Julian studied her briefly before softening his tone. "No. But we must maintain professionalism in the workplace."

Katherine brightened instantly. "Understood."

"I have meetings shortly," Julian added. "My assistant will show you around instead."
###Chapter 450 Love's Enigmatic Dance

Katherine didn't show any displeasure. With perfect poise, she responded, "Don't worry about me. Focus on your work. I can explore on my own."

Julian felt a pang of guilt at her graciousness. "I'll have my assistant accompany you. Just let him know if you need anything."

"Of course."

The moment Julian disappeared around the corner, Katherine's smile vanished like morning mist. She turned slowly, her gaze lingering on the closed office door with an unsettling intensity.

...

Inside the office, Evelyn brightened upon seeing Sophia. "What brings you here unexpectedly?"

Sophia set down her designer handbag with a casual smile. "Just happened to be in the neighborhood."

Her eyes flickered downward as she asked nonchalantly, "Julian's here too?"

"Oh yes," Evelyn explained, "he came to support our new talent division. Just signed his exclusive contract with Kingsley Industries."

Sophia's eyebrows lifted in genuine surprise. "He signed with your company?"

"Absolutely. He's now our flagship celebrity."

Recognizing Sophia's unspoken feelings, Evelyn added carefully, "If VERE Jewelry sponsors us, Julian would be the primary beneficiary at this stage."

Sophia murmured something indistinct, letting the conversation lapse.

Evelyn reached for her hand. "Sophia, you could always tell him how you feel."

A shadow crossed Sophia's expressive eyes.

Her lips twisted into a bitter smile. "No. Some emotions are better left unspoken. This way... at least we can remain friends."

"But if you never voice them—"

"Sometimes ignorance is kinder."

Sophia met Evelyn's gaze squarely. "I overheard your conversation earlier, from the hallway."

"Don't take his words at face value," Evelyn insisted. Knowing Julian as she did, she couldn't believe he'd remained indifferent to Sophia all these years.

"Let it be. Love follows its own mysterious path," Sophia sighed, the resignation in her voice palpable.

Evelyn felt a surge of concern. She couldn't bear to see Julian miss out on someone as remarkable as Sophia.

"You truly believe that?"

Sophia nodded firmly.

Changing tactics, Evelyn mentioned casually, "Julian brought his protégée along today."

"Protégée?" Sophia's attention sharpened.

"Yes. Said her previous contract just ended, so he introduced her to us. He's been unusually attentive to her career."

Sophia's expression turned carefully neutral. "Is that so?"

But her gaze grew distant, betraying her racing thoughts.

Evelyn understood perfectly. A woman's heart has limited space—room only for the one who holds it.

Sophia's reaction confirmed everything. This might be the perfect opportunity to bring them together.

"So is VERE Jewelry considering sponsoring us?"

Sophia snapped back to the present. "Absolutely! We should always support our own."
###Chapter 451 Childhood Friends

"Perfect, now that we've agreed on terms, I'll have legal draft the paperwork. Assuming no issues arise, we can sign by week's end."

Sophia Whitmore gave a graceful nod. "Excellent. VERE is launching our new Celestial collection, and all pieces will be exclusively worn by Kingsley Industries' talent."

Evelyn Carter tapped her chin thoughtfully. "Let's feature Julian and Katherine. They're currently our most visible stars."

Sophia's gaze drifted toward the floor-to-ceiling windows as she murmured her assent.

"The entire quarter's red carpet jewelry will come from our atelier."

"I'll have their stylists coordinate directly with your team."

"Agreed."

As their meeting concluded, Evelyn personally escorted the jewelry designer downstairs. The elevator doors parted to reveal Katherine Whitaker lounging in the marble lobby.

Katherine's eyes snapped to Sophia with feline interest before addressing Evelyn. "Ms. Carter! What a pleasant surprise."

Seeing the unspoken question in the actress's eyes, Evelyn made introductions. "Katherine, meet Ms. Whitmore of VERE Jewelry - your new exclusive sponsor."

Recognition flashed across Katherine's features. VERE's avant-garde designs dominated international fashion magazines, their pieces coveted by every starlet in Hollywood.

Suddenly all business, Katherine extended a manicured hand. "Ms. Whitmore! Katherine Whitaker, signed to Kingsley's entertainment division. I'm thrilled by this collaboration."

Sophia offered a polite but distant smile. Without further engagement, she turned back to Evelyn. "Evie, I should head back to the studio. My team will handle the logistics."

"Of course."

As Sophia's heels clicked across the polished floors, Katherine couldn't suppress her curiosity. "Ms. Carter, you and Ms. Whitmore seem... unusually close."

Evelyn's lips curved at the memory. "We grew up together. Shared a sandbox before we shared business ventures."

Katherine's perfectly sculpted eyebrows lifted. This changed everything. No wonder Harrison Whitmore treated Sophia differently - it wasn't romantic history, but childhood ties to Evelyn.

"How lovely to maintain such friendships in our world," Katherine remarked smoothly.

Evelyn hummed in agreement when her phone vibrated with an incoming call. Her entire demeanor shifted as she saw the caller ID, her smile turning private and warm.

"Harrison?"

Katherine observed the transformation with clinical interest. Whoever was on the line held remarkable sway over the typically unflappable CEO.

Harrison Whitmore stood across the plaza, his gaze locked on Evelyn's silhouette through the glass walls.

"Harrison?" Evelyn's voice held a note of concern at his silence.

His low chuckle carried through the phone. "Turn around, darling."

Evelyn spun and immediately spotted his familiar frame. Without hesitation, she broke into a run, her designer heels be damned.
###Chapter 452 The Hidden Wound

Evelyn stood frozen in place, her sharp gaze scanning Harrison from head to toe. A wave of irritation washed over her when she saw him standing there perfectly intact.

Her lips pressed into a thin line. "Where the hell have you been these past days? I couldn't reach you at all. I thought you were—"

Harrison didn't let her finish. His strong arms enveloped her in a crushing embrace.

The familiar scent of his cologne instantly soothed Evelyn's frayed nerves. She melted against his chest, swallowing the angry words that had been on the tip of her tongue.

His warm breath tickled her ear as he murmured, "Forgive me for worrying you, Evie."

There had been unexpected complications at Whitmore Enterprises' headquarters. He'd been trapped in emergency meetings in Frenda with no access to outside communication.

The moment he'd seen her barrage of missed calls and texts, he'd boarded the first available flight. Straight from the airport, he'd come to Kingsley Industries—just to lay eyes on her sooner.

Evelyn pulled back with a scowl. "Your phone was completely dead. Not a single reply. Do you have any idea how—"

"I know," he interrupted, brushing a stray lock behind her ear. "It won't happen again."

Her eyes narrowed as she studied his face. The dark circles beneath his eyes made her stomach clench. "Harrison... did you come here directly after landing?"

A tired nod.

"I was afraid you'd worry. More afraid you'd be furious. Needed to apologize in person."

"So you haven't slept?"

His arms tightened around her waist. "Seeing you is all the rest I need."

"Release me. We're at work." Evelyn shoved against his chest.

When her hands connected with his left shoulder, Harrison hissed through clenched teeth, his face contorting in pain.

Evelyn's breath hitched. "You're hurt."

Her fingers trembled as she reached for his collar, but Harrison intercepted her wrist. "It's nothing serious."

The lie was obvious. She'd barely touched him, yet the pain had been unmistakable. "Show me. Now."

Her probing fingers found the edge of a bandage peeking above his shirt collar.

Evelyn's voice turned sharp. "What happened? How bad is it?"

The genuine concern in her eyes warmed something deep in Harrison's chest.

"Just a scratch. Barely worth mentioning."

"Like hell it is!" Evelyn's hands fisted in his jacket. "You came here injured? You should be resting!"

Harrison surrendered with a sigh. "Alright, alright."

"I'm taking you home."

A spark of amusement lit his tired eyes. "If you insist."

The drive to the Whitmore estate passed in tense silence. The moment they crossed the threshold, Evelyn was on him like a hawk.

"Let me see that injury. What really happened?"

In the grand living room, she peeled off his suit jacket with surgeon-like precision. When she lifted his dress shirt, the pristine white bandage came into view—marred by a faint crimson stain.

Harrison caught her trembling hands. "It looks worse than it is. The doctor already stitched it up."

Evelyn's lower lip quivered. "Why didn't you tell me? And another thing—when you disappeared, I realized I don't know a single person who can reach you directly. Never do this to me again."
###Chapter 453 Someone Special

The moment Evelyn finished speaking, Harrison's strong arms encircled her waist, pulling her flush against his chest. His warm breath tickled her ear as he murmured, "Alright."

Pressed so intimately against him, Evelyn could feel her heart pounding wildly, its frantic rhythm echoing through her entire body. She squirmed slightly, trying to create some distance between them.

"Where do you keep the first aid supplies? Let me take care of your injury."

"Don't trouble yourself. The physician already treated it."

"But it looks like the wound reopened," Evelyn insisted, already turning to search the room. Her eyes darted around anxiously, fingers twitching with nervous energy.

Harrison watched her frantic movements with amusement before rising gracefully. He crossed to a mahogany cabinet near the window. "The medical kit is here."

Flushing slightly at her own haste, Evelyn accepted the kit from him. "Sit down. I'll change your bandages."

Obediently, Harrison lowered himself onto the plush sofa, his piercing gaze never leaving her face as she worked. Evelyn's hands trembled slightly as she opened the kit and selected the necessary supplies. Her touch was feather-light as she carefully peeled back the soiled dressing, revealing the angry wound beneath.

The laceration appeared to be from some sharp implement - too clean and precise to be accidental. Evelyn's brow furrowed as suspicion prickled at the back of her mind.

"Harrison," she began cautiously, "how did this really happen?"

He offered her an easy smile that didn't quite reach his eyes. "Just a minor mishap. Nothing to concern yourself over."

Recognizing his evasion, Evelyn decided not to push further. "You need to be more careful," she chided gently, dabbing antiseptic onto the wound with meticulous care. "I don't like seeing you hurt."

As she worked, tiny beads of perspiration formed on her forehead, evidence of her intense concentration. When the fresh bandage was finally secured, Evelyn exhaled in relief.

"You'll need to change this dressing regularly for proper healing."

"Your wish is my command," Harrison replied with a playful smirk.

While Evelyn repacked the medical supplies, Harrison seized the opportunity to make a quick call. "My office. Five minutes," was all he said before ending the connection.

Curiosity got the better of Evelyn. "Who was that?"

Harrison's eyes twinkled with secret amusement. "You'll see."

True to his word, the doorbell chimed moments later. Evelyn moved to answer it, but Harrison caught her wrist gently. "No need. He knows his way around."

Before Evelyn could question further, the door swung open to reveal a stern-faced stranger. The man carried himself with military precision, his expression unreadable as he bowed slightly at the waist.

"Miss Carter," he greeted respectfully.

Evelyn blinked in surprise. "You know me?"

Harrison smoothly interjected, "Evelyn, this is Phillip Blackwood, my personal attaché."

"Your attaché?"

"If you ever can't reach me directly," Harrison explained, "Phillip will always know where to find me."

On cue, Phillip produced an embossed business card from his breast pocket. "My direct line, Miss Carter."

Evelyn accepted the card, still processing this development. "Harrison, what's all this about?"

His expression softened as he reached for her hand. "So you'll never have to wonder where I am again."

Understanding dawned, warming Evelyn from within. She'd mentioned her concerns only in passing, yet Harrison had not only remembered but taken concrete steps to ease her worries.

A tender smile curved her lips as she squeezed his hand. "Thank you. I understand now."
###Chapter 454 His Private World

Harrison turned to Phillip with a commanding tone. "From now on, Evelyn has full access to my schedule. Answer all her questions truthfully."

Phillip's eyes widened in shock. As Harrison's longtime shadow operative, he knew the gravity of this instruction. The Whitmore heir had countless enemies from years of corporate warfare. His movements were always classified information.

For over a decade, Phillip had operated in complete secrecy. Not a single public record tied him to Harrison. Yet now, his existence was being revealed to this woman without hesitation.

The message was clear - Harrison trusted Evelyn completely.

"Understood, Mr. Whitmore," Phillip responded immediately. His loyalty never wavered.

If Harrison placed his faith in Evelyn, then Phillip would too.

"You're dismissed."

"Yes, sir."

As Phillip exited, Harrison took Evelyn's hand gently. "Evie, I need to handle some... delicate matters tonight."

Evelyn had sensed the shift in his demeanor but knew better than to pry.

She simply nodded, meeting his intense gaze. "Just promise me one thing - come back in one piece."

"I promise."

The air between them grew charged as Harrison studied her face. Evelyn's reflection shimmered in his dark eyes, creating an intimacy that made her pulse quicken.

She took an instinctive step backward. "I should head home now."

Harrison caught her wrist effortlessly. "It's past midnight. Not safe."

Evelyn blinked, then flushed crimson as realization dawned. "Oh! No, that's... I couldn't possibly..."

An indulgent smile played on Harrison's lips, though he made no move to cross boundaries. He could feel Evelyn gradually opening up to him.

There was no need to rush.

"Take the master suite. I'll use the guest room. Just for tonight." His voice dropped to a conspiratorial whisper. "Otherwise Beatrice will have my head for letting you go home this late."

Trapped by his mother's hypothetical wrath, Evelyn had no choice but to agree.

"Alright. Goodnight then!"

She practically sprinted up the stairs like a startled deer, slamming the master bedroom door behind her before exhaling sharply.

Pressing cool palms to her burning cheeks, Evelyn scolded herself for acting so skittish.

Once composed, she finally took in her surroundings properly.

This was Harrison's inner sanctum. The room exuded quiet luxury - dark wood furnishings, crisp linens, and an understated elegance that mirrored the man himself.

"Goodness!" Evelyn gasped, spotting the illuminated display case.

Rows upon rows of rare comic book figurines stood in perfect formation, each one a collector's dream.

"Since when did Harrison become such a geek?" she wondered aloud.

The discovery triggered memories of her own childhood obsession with superheroes. Her collection still gathered dust somewhere at Kingsley Manor, untouched for years.

Evelyn shook her head with a wistful smile. "How time flies."

As she turned to leave, something glinted in the dim light, freezing her in place. Her breath caught as she recognized the object resting on Harrison's nightstand.
###Chapter 455 Spend More Time With Her

"What has caught your attention?" Harrison's voice broke through Evelyn's reverie, yet her eyes stayed locked on a decorative piece across the room.

She gestured toward the ornament. "Harrison, why do you have this exact same porcelain rocking horse?"

His gaze followed hers, lips curving slightly. "Do you possess one as well?"

Evelyn nodded, fingers tightening around the pajama set he'd handed her. "Identical to yours. Though mine shattered years ago." She turned away, voice dropping to a whisper. "Beyond repair."

A shadow flickered through Harrison's eyes, quickly masked. "What an unfortunate loss."

He extended a plush towel toward her. "You should retire early tonight."

"I will." She accepted the items, forcing a small smile. "You should rest too. Goodnight."

The moment the door clicked shut behind him, Evelyn exhaled sharply. The pajama fabric felt impossibly soft between her fingers.

Meanwhile, Nathan Sterling's limousine rolled through the wrought iron gates of Sterling Manor well past midnight. The scent of expensive whiskey clung to his tailored suit as he slumped against the leather seats.

"Sir, we've arrived." The driver's voice cut through the alcohol haze.

Nathan blinked at the familiar silhouette of his family home. With sluggish movements, he loosened his tie and stepped into the chilled night air.

"Dismissed," he muttered without turning back.

The estate stood eerily silent. Moonlight washed over the sprawling mansion that now felt hollow. Six months ago, these halls echoed with Evelyn's laughter. Now only Margaret remained after he'd banished Eleanor and Vanessa.

"Mr. Sterling, you're home." Patricia materialized in the foyer, taking his coat with practiced efficiency. "Madam Winslow wished to dine with you tonight."

Nathan paused mid-step. "Is she asleep?"

"Retired an hour ago, sir." The housekeeper hesitated. "Though... there's something you should know."

His brow arched in question.

Patricia lowered her voice. "Madam's health has declined recently. She forbade us from troubling you, but... perhaps you could visit more often?"

The words struck like physical blows. Without responding, Nathan took the grand staircase two steps at a time.

At the master suite's threshold, he paused, listening to the faint coughs within. When he eased the door open, moonlight revealed Margaret's restless form.

"Let me adjust your blankets, Grandmother."

"Nathan?" The bedside lamp flickered on, illuminating Margaret's tired smile. "Don't trouble yourself, dear."

He froze, hand still outstretched. "I didn't mean to wake you."

"These old bones don't sleep much anymore." She patted the silk covers. "Another late business meeting? You're working yourself to exhaustion."

Nathan swallowed hard, the whiskey suddenly bitter on his tongue. The woman who'd once stood taller than oak trees now seemed fragile as the porcelain horse in Harrison's study.
###Chapter 456 Knowing Her Well

"I understand, Grandma Margaret. Please don't worry about me."

Evelyn Carter sighed deeply. "With just the two of us left in this mansion now, how can I not worry?"

Then, she hesitated before asking, "How is Nathan doing these days?"

At the mention of Nathan Sterling, Evelyn simply replied, "He's fine, Grandma. You don't need to concern yourself."

Margaret nodded knowingly. "Nathan has always been a good man. It's just... unfortunate how things turned out between you two. If only..." She trailed off, shaking her head. "No use dwelling on the past. You should get some rest now."

"Yes, Grandma. You should sleep too."

After leaving Margaret's room, Evelyn retreated to her own bedroom.

For the past three years, she had barely spent any time in this house, with Nathan handling everything. Now that their divorce was finalized, she found herself returning more often.

Yet, she couldn't help but miss the days when Nathan still lived here with her.

Evelyn pushed open the door, but there were no traces of Nathan left. Every reminder of him had been slowly erased over time.

She stood by the window, gazing at the city lights below. Without thinking, she reached for a cigarette, lighting it and taking a slow drag.

The smoke curled around her, wrapping her in a melancholic haze.

Unbeknownst to her, Margaret had quietly approached the doorway with the butler's support. Just as the butler was about to announce their presence, Margaret stopped him.

She watched Evelyn by the window, sighing softly before whispering, "Let's go. Help me back to my room."

"Of course, Madam."

Margaret had noticed the change in Evelyn and made a decision. "Bring me my phone tomorrow morning. I need to call Nathan."

"Understood, Madam."

——

The next morning, Evelyn woke up in Harrison Whitmore's guest room, blinking away the remnants of sleep. She checked her phone—nearly 8:00 AM.

"I actually slept in?" she murmured, quickly sitting up.

Her gaze landed on a neatly folded set of clothes beside the bed, clearly prepared for her.

Evelyn took them to the dressing room to change. The style was exactly to her taste, and the fit was impeccable.

It was almost too perfect.

Once dressed, she headed downstairs.

Harrison's voice called out from the dining room, "You're awake? Come have breakfast."

She followed the sound, only to nearly bump into him in the hallway.

He smiled, reaching out to take her hand. "Come on, let's eat."

He led her to the dining table, where an elaborate breakfast spread awaited—including her favorite cinnamon rolls.

"Did you make all this?" Evelyn asked in surprise.

Harrison pulled out a chair for her with a faint smile. "Try it."

Curious, she took a bite of the cinnamon roll. The taste was just as good as the ones from her favorite bakery.

"Harrison, this is amazing."

He handed her a glass of fresh milk.

"Eat as much as you want. After this, I'll take you to the office."
###Chapter 457 The Dating Game Begins

Evelyn's fingers curled around the warm mug of milk as she studied Harrison's profile. "Harrison, I never knew you could cook like this," she admitted, her voice laced with genuine surprise.

It amazed her how after all these years, he still managed to surprise her with hidden talents.

Harrison simply shrugged, his lips curving into that familiar half-smile. "Picked it up during my college years. Guess it finally came in useful."

What truly mattered was seeing the delight on her face as she tasted his cooking. Harrison lowered his gaze to hide his satisfaction.

"If you enjoy it, I could make this a regular thing."

Evelyn didn't even pause to consider. "Absolutely! I'd love that," she beamed.

—

After breakfast, Harrison drove Evelyn to Kingsley Industries.

She waved him off from the sidewalk, watching his car disappear around the corner before turning toward the building.

Julian materialized beside her the moment she stepped through the glass doors. "Evie!"

His sharp eyes scanned her from head to toe, making Evelyn shift uncomfortably.

"What's with the inspection?" she asked, adjusting her bag strap.

"Cut the act. Why weren't you home last night?"

A flush crept up Evelyn's neck. "I have no idea what you're talking about."

Julian crossed his arms, looking far too knowing. "That was Harrison Whitmore dropping you off, wasn't it? Spill. What's really going on between you two?"

"You're imagining things. We're just— I'm late for a meeting!" She sidestepped him, making a break for the elevators.

Julian's laughter followed her. "My baby sister's all grown up!"

"Julian!" Evelyn's cheeks burned crimson.

He held up his hands in surrender. "Alright, I'll stop teasing. He seems decent enough, but if he wants to date my sister, he'll have to pass inspection."

Like hell he'd let his baby sister go that easily!

And Dominic and Elliot would be even tougher judges. Those two would eat potential suitors for breakfast.

Julian's smirk widened as he mentally catalogued ways to test Harrison's mettle.

Unexpectedly, Evelyn turned the tables. "Julian, maybe you should focus on your own love life. Quality women don't grow on trees, you know."

Julian blinked. "What's that supposed to mean?"

Evelyn batted her lashes innocently and patted his shoulder. "Are you really that oblivious? Haven't you noticed anyone special lately?"

Julian opened his mouth, then closed it.

"Seriously! You're not getting any younger. When are you going to find me a sister-in-law?"

With that parting shot, Evelyn sauntered off, leaving Julian gaping after her.

"How did this conversation become about me?" he muttered.

Yet the idea of dating didn't sound entirely unappealing. A certain face flashed through his mind, and Julian shook his head violently.

"Damn it, why did I think of her? No, no, no! That's just wrong!" He hurried after Evelyn, muttering to himself.

—

Evelyn was still smiling when she reached her office.

Her phone buzzed the moment she sat down. The caller ID made her eyebrows shoot up.

"Grandmother! What a lovely surprise!"
###Chapter 458 Her Only Comfort

"Evelyn, you must be exhausted from work lately," Margaret said softly.

Evelyn gave a gentle smile. "It's manageable. Kingsley Industries is finally stabilizing."

"Good. That's wonderful news," Margaret replied before breaking into a series of coughs that made Evelyn's brow furrow with concern.

"Grandma, are you feeling alright?"

"Just my usual ailments, dear. Nothing to fuss over."

Evelyn's heart clenched. During her three years with the Sterling family, Margaret had been her sole source of warmth and comfort in that cold mansion.

"Have you seen Dr. Whitmore about this?"

"Yes, yes. Don't trouble yourself over an old woman. I simply called because I've missed our chats."

"I'll come visit after work today."

Margaret's voice brightened instantly. "Truly? Oh, that would make my week! This empty house feels so lifeless these days. Your visits are the highlight of my days."

"Grandma, you know you're family to me."

Tears welled in Margaret's eyes at the words. "You've always had such a kind heart, Evelyn! Now, I won't keep you from your work. I'll see you this evening."

As Evelyn set down her phone, a crisp knock sounded at her office door. Maxwell entered with professional efficiency.

"Ms. Carter, Mr. Thornton from Horizon Technologies has arrived."

Evelyn nodded. "Please escort him to Conference Room B. I'll be there shortly."

"Of course."

Gathering the necessary documents, Evelyn smoothed her blazer and headed out.

The negotiation with Matthias proceeded remarkably well, culminating in both companies signing a partnership agreement by afternoon.

Matthias examined the contract with satisfaction.

"Ms. Carter," he said, extending his hand, "I look forward to our collaboration."

"The feeling is mutual, Mr. Thornton. I'm eager to learn from your expertise."

"Now you're being modest," Matthias chuckled. "With your reputation in the tech industry, this will be a partnership of equals."

"You flatter me, Mr. Thornton. Your experience is what we value most," Evelyn replied with genuine humility that earned Matthias's respect.

"Shall we?"

"After you."

Their pleasant exchange continued as the group exited, creating an atmosphere of professional harmony.

From his vantage point, Julian Hawthorne watched with a deepening scowl.

His assistant murmured, "Mr. Hawthorne, Ms. Carter's deal with Horizon appears finalized. They've signed contracts already."

Julian's lips curled in disdain. "Hmph. Youthful recklessness. What substantial results can she possibly achieve?"

His gaze hardened with contempt. "Let the girl play at business. Every fledgling needs to fall before they learn to fly properly."

"What's our next move, sir?"

Julian's expression turned calculating. "She thinks the digital economy is her golden ticket, but she's forgotten that virtual platforms can't compete with tangible assets. This time, not even divine intervention can save her ambitions."

Suddenly remembering something crucial, Julian turned sharply. "Did you discover who purchased the Eastwood property?"
###Chapter 459 Mutual Interest

The assistant swiftly passed the documents to Julian. "I've located it, Mr. Hawthorne. The Eastwood property was acquired by the newly formed Blackwood Group."

"Interesting. A startup company daring enough to snatch such prime real estate?" Julian's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "What else did you uncover?"

"Mr. Hawthorne, Blackwood Group isn't your average new company. Our research indicates connections to the former Delaney Corporation and the Sterling family."

"The Sterlings? Nathan Sterling?"

"Precisely!"

"I knew it. Even Nathan recognizes this land's value. Evelyn truly lacks vision for rejecting this opportunity."

"Absolutely, Mr. Hawthorne! Ms. Carter seems to have miscalculated this time. Though Blackwood Group secured the property, it's beyond their capacity to develop alone."

Julian chuckled darkly. "This presents the perfect opening. Contact Blackwood Group's owner immediately."

"No need, Mr. Hawthorne. I've already reached out to Ms. Blackwood. They're eager to collaborate with us."

Julian gave his assistant an approving pat on the shoulder. "Excellent work! Your initiative continues to impress me."

The assistant smirked knowingly. "I learned from the best. Working under you has been... enlightening."

"Good. Let's not waste this opportunity. Arrange the meeting with Ms. Blackwood immediately. I want to understand her true intentions."

"Right away, sir."

Within the hour, everything was set.

———

Later that afternoon, Julian's chauffeur drove him to the designated upscale café.

Juliette Blackwood arrived early, sipping her latte while reviewing notes. This meeting with Kingsley Industries' executive thrilled her.

She'd done her homework on Julian Hawthorne. His influential position at Kingsley Industries and his ongoing feud with Evelyn Carter were well-documented.

After all, the enemy of my enemy...

A victorious smile played on her lips as she envisioned their alliance.

Julian arrived precisely on time. "Ms. Blackwood, I presume?"

Juliette looked up slowly, setting down her cup with deliberate grace before extending her hand. "Mr. Hawthorne. Your reputation precedes you."

Their handshake lingered a moment too long, both recognizing a kindred spirit.

"Please, sit."

"Such youth yet such boldness, Ms. Blackwood. Acquiring Eastwood demonstrates remarkable... ambition."

"You flatter me, Mr. Hawthorne. When one learns from industry pioneers like yourself, success becomes inevitable."

Julian's eyes narrowed appreciatively. "Let's dispense with formalities. Shall we discuss Eastwood?"

Juliette maintained an innocent expression. "Oh? You're interested in that property too?"

A seasoned player, Julian recognized her feigned ignorance immediately. This only intrigued him further.

The game had begun.
###Chapter 460 The Devil's Bargain

"Barista, I'll have a black coffee, no cream or sugar," Julian Hawthorne ordered with a crisp snap of his fingers.

The steaming cup arrived moments later. He lifted it to his lips, savoring the bitter aroma before taking his first deliberate sip.

"Your taste in cafés is impeccable, Ms. Blackwood. The beans have a robust flavor profile with just the right acidity."

Juliette Blackwood's lips curved into a practiced smile. "Then perhaps I should make our coffee meetings a regular occurrence."

"I wouldn't object to that."

Their verbal fencing continued, neither willing to show weakness first.

Juliette had underestimated Julian initially, assuming he'd be easier to manipulate. His resilience surprised her.

But she wasn't some naive debutante either.

As their cups emptied, Juliette rose gracefully. "Mr. Hawthorne, unless there's something else, I believe we're done here?"

Julian set his cup down with deliberate slowness. "Ms. Blackwood, let's not rush our goodbyes. Wouldn't you agree?"

"Oh? Do you have something to add?"

"Partnerships require trust as their foundation." His gaze sharpened. "Your earlier hesitation suggests you don't fully trust me yet."

Seeing his direct approach, Juliette abandoned pretense. Their mutual goals made deception unnecessary.

She resumed her seat with newfound respect. "You see right through me, Mr. Hawthorne."

"Trust takes time to build between business partners."

Juliette decided to lay her cards on the table. "Since we're both professionals, I'll be blunt."

"By all means."

"Kingsley Industries has indeed secured the Eastwood property for residential development. The location speaks for itself - prime real estate with guaranteed returns."

She leaned forward. "But our current capital reserves can't fully fund the project. What's your proposed investment amount?"

Julian's silence stretched, but satisfaction gleamed in his eyes.

"Your candor is refreshing. Very well - I'll personally invest fifteen million for the final construction phase."

Juliette's delicate scoff was barely audible. "Mr. Hawthorne, for a project of this scale? Fifteen million won't even cover the foundation work."

His eyebrow arched. "Then name your price."

Five manicured fingers appeared between them. "Fifty million minimum. I've already committed that amount myself."

She held his gaze. "Match my investment, and we'll split the profits equally. Do we have a deal?"

Fifty million presented a challenge for Julian.

Though a Kingsley Industries director with substantial stock holdings, liquid assets were another matter. Truthfully, even the fifteen million he'd mentioned would require creative accounting.

"Your silence speaks volumes, Mr. Hawthorne."

Julian's jaw tightened with resolve. "Done. Fifty million. But this comes from my private funds."

Juliette's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Naturally."

"Then to our successful partnership!"

Triumph flickered behind Juliette's composed expression. She hadn't expected his capitulation so easily.

"Consider it settled. I'll have my lawyers draft the paperwork."

"The pleasure is all mine." Julian raised his empty cup in mock toast, already calculating which assets he'd need to liquidate.
###Chapter 461 All or Nothing

The moment Juliette Blackwood disappeared from view, Julian Hawthorne signaled to his assistant lingering nearby.

"Anything requiring my attention, Mr. Hawthorne?"

Julian's fingers drummed against the mahogany desk. "What's my current liquidity position?"

"Approximately one hundred million dors in liquid assets, sir. Combined with your Kingsley Industries shares and real estate holdings, total net worth stands around fifty million dors."

Julian's jaw tightened as he weighed the gamble.

This chess match demanded everything. Every last chip.

But passing meant forfeiting the opportunity of a lifetime.

"Your assessment of the real estate market's trajectory?"

The assistant blinked. "With all due respect, Mr. Hawthorne, property investments have never failed investors. The market remains the safest harbor for capital preservation."

Julian gave a slow nod.

Decades in business confirmed the assistant's analysis. Real estate promised guaranteed returns.

Why remain shackled to Kingsley Industries and Evelyn Carter's shadow when he could carve his own empire?

This project was the perfect launchpad.

"Leverage all my properties as collateral."

"Sir, that's—"

"Execute the order." Julian's voice brooked no argument.

"Yes, Mr. Hawthorne."

"Leave my Kingsley shares untouched," Julian murmured, more to himself. "They're my safety net."

After a beat, he added, "Scout the black market for private lenders. We'll bridge the gap until project returns materialize."

"Shadow lenders carry substantial risk—"

"The project's liquidity cycle is ninety days max." Julian waved dismissively. "More than sufficient."

"But—"

Every investment carried risk.

The unspoken truth hung between them. Seeing Julian's resolve, the assistant swallowed further objections.

"Understood, sir. Consider it done."

—

Evelyn Carter stretched her arms overhead as her computer screen dimmed. Finally, freedom.

She nearly collided with Maxwell Donovan in the hallway.

"Leaving already, Ms. Carter?"

"Retail therapy," she quipped, sidestepping him.

"Allow me to—"

"Thanks, but I prefer shopping alone." Evelyn was already halfway to the elevators.

The luxury mall's marble floors gleamed as she selected premium ingredients and carefully curated gifts. Her trunk soon overflowed with packages.

The drive to Sterling Manor passed in a blur of golden hour light.

—

Margaret Winslow had mobilized the entire household since noon.

"Every surface must shine!" she'd ordered, personally approving the menu of Evelyn's favorite dishes.

Now she paced the grand portico, eyes scanning the driveway.

When Evelyn's car finally appeared, Margaret's face lit up like sunrise.

"She's here!"

"Madam, please mind your—"

Margaret was already hurrying down the steps, silk shawl fluttering behind her.

Evelyn had just opened her car door when another vehicle rolled through the gates.

Her smile froze.
###Chapter 462 Grandmother's Surprise

"Evelyn, darling! You made it!"

Evelyn's gaze landed on Margaret's beaming face waiting by the entrance, deliberately avoiding the familiar masculine figure standing slightly behind her.

With practiced ease, she swung the car door open, her smile radiant. "Grandmother!"

Margaret practically vibrated with excitement, rushing forward to clasp Evelyn's hands. "It's been far too long since your last visit!"

She whisked Evelyn inside in a flurry of chatter, completely disregarding Nathan who was just finishing parking his luxury sedan in the circular driveway.

Nathan had spotted the unfamiliar vehicle from down the lane. At first he thought his eyes deceived him - until he saw Evelyn emerge and witnessed Margaret's enthusiastic greeting.

The corners of his mouth lifted involuntarily.

As Nathan exited his car, the head housekeeper approached. "Mr. Sterling, welcome home."

Nathan acknowledged with a nod, directing the staff to unload his purchases before making his way inside.

The living room echoed with animated conversation. Margaret was fussing over Evelyn, their laughter floating through the grand foyer.

Pausing in the doorway, Nathan absorbed the joyful sounds, his smile deepening.

The housekeeper observing him nearly dropped the silver tray she carried - it had been years since anyone had seen such genuine warmth on the Sterling heir's face.

Noticing her reaction, Nathan cleared his throat and schooled his features back into their usual impassive mask before proceeding toward the voices.

"Grandmother."

Margaret turned automatically at the sound, her expression immediately darkening upon seeing him. "You pick today of all days to finally grace us with your presence? When I have special company?"

Nathan offered no excuses. "Light workload at the office. Thought I'd visit."

Margaret waved him off impatiently. "Come along, Evelyn dear. I've something wonderful to show you upstairs."

Left standing alone, Nathan shook his head with quiet amusement before heading toward the kitchen.

Margaret guided Evelyn up the grand staircase, whispering conspiratorially. "Forgive the unexpected encounter, darling. That grandson of mine rarely visits, yet today he decides to appear."

"Please don't trouble yourself, Grandmother." Evelyn's voice held genuine warmth. "I came to see you. Nothing else matters."

Margaret searched Evelyn's eyes and found only sincerity.

"That boy never deserved you. Too blind to recognize the treasure he had." Margaret's voice thickened with emotion. "Someone as remarkable as you will find true happiness, my dear."

Evelyn's eyes glistened as she embraced the older woman. "Thank you for that."

Margaret's comforting pats conveyed decades of wisdom. "My sweet girl. Your happiness is all that concerns me now. What happened between you and Nathan is ancient history."

She cupped Evelyn's face tenderly. "That you still visit this old woman means more than you know."

"Don't say such things! You'll always be family to me." Evelyn's declaration rang with conviction.
###Chapter 463 Somewhat Excessive

Evelyn Carter nodded with delight. She tugged Margaret Winslow's arm gently, guiding her to settle on the plush sofa. "Stay right here. I'll be back in a moment."

Margaret's brows furrowed slightly. "What do you need? Let me help you."

"No need." Evelyn flashed a warm smile. "This is something I should do myself."

She disappeared into the adjoining sitting room, emerging moments later with an exquisite velvet case in her hands.

"I don't have much to offer you, dear," Evelyn said softly, "but these pieces hold memories from when I married my husband."

With careful fingers, she opened the case to reveal a dazzling diamond necklace. The gems caught the light, scattering prismatic patterns across the walls. "Come closer," Evelyn murmured, motioning for Margaret to lean forward.

Margaret gasped when the cool metal touched her skin. "This is too precious. I can't possibly accept it."

Evelyn's fingers worked deftly at the clasp. "Nonsense. Consider it a symbol of my affection. Blood means nothing compared to the bond we share."

"Grandmother!"

"It suits you perfectly." Evelyn stepped back to admire her handiwork, eyes glistening. "Some fortunate man will claim your heart one day. And when he does, he'd better realize what a treasure he's found."

Guilt twisted in Margaret's chest. "About that—"

Evelyn silenced her with a gentle pat. "Happiness is all that matters, child. Whatever path you choose."

Margaret swallowed hard against the lump in her throat. "I understand."

Their conversation flowed effortlessly through the afternoon, continuing over an intimate dinner in the grand dining room. Nathan Sterling observed quietly from his seat, content to remain in the background as the two women laughed together.

When evening shadows lengthened and Evelyn retired for the night, Margaret prepared to leave. She nearly jumped when she found Nathan waiting by the garden path, his silhouette stark against the moonlight.

Before she could speak, he said, "I haven't seen her this joyful in years. Thank you for that."

Margaret crossed her arms against the evening chill. "No thanks needed. I enjoy her company."

Nathan's jaw tightened. "She's been unwell lately, and with work—"

"Your grandmother isn't getting any younger, Mr. Sterling. Make time for her."

A muscle twitched in his cheek. "Point taken."

For the first time since their divorce, the air between them held no tension. Nathan found himself wishing things had always been this easy.

"If that's all, I should be going."

Nathan opened his mouth, then closed it. "Drive carefully," he finally said.

Margaret nodded once before sliding into her car. The engine purred to life, tires crunching gravel as she disappeared down the drive.

It wasn't until her taillights vanished that Nathan remembered. Cursing under his breath, he sprinted to his own vehicle and gave chase.

###Chapter 464 Chase Him Away

Nathan Sterling followed Evelyn Carter's car at a careful distance, his knuckles white on the steering wheel. He maintained the gap between them until her vehicle disappeared safely through the wrought iron gates of Kingsley Manor.

Only then did he pull over, cutting the engine with a sharp twist of his wrist. Through the gathering dusk, he could make out a masculine figure waiting for Evelyn in the courtyard. Though the distance obscured the man's features, Nathan's stomach twisted with sickening certainty.

Was Evelyn seeing someone new? Living together already? Could that be Harrison Whitmore?

An ache spread through his chest, hollow and relentless. His vision blurred momentarily, and he blinked hard against the unexpected sting in his eyes.

The steering wheel creaked under his grip. He couldn't explain why he'd trailed her home like some lovesick teenager, nor why the sight before him made his throat constrict.

Inside the manor, Julian Hartwell smirked as he glanced toward the idling car. "Evelyn," he teased, draping an arm over his sister's shoulders, "aren't you going to invite your gentleman caller inside?"

Evelyn swatted at him playfully. "Since when did you become such a busybody, Julian?"

"Call it brotherly concern." His grin widened. "Lover's quarrel?"

"Hardly!"

"Then why the separate cars and icy silence?" Julian pressed.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "Did you even look properly at who's out there?"

Julian's expression shifted to genuine curiosity. "Wait, that's not Harrison? Who then? Don't tell me you're already dating someone new." He wagged a finger. "Let me make this clear - Harrison's the only brother-in-law I'll accept. Anyone else tries to join this family, I'm chasing them off with a baseball bat!"

Evelyn couldn't suppress her laughter. "Is that so? Well, your would-be victim is Nathan Sterling."

Julian's face darkened instantly. "What? I'll get my bat right now! The audacity of that man showing up here after everything!" He spun toward the house, calling over his shoulder, "I've been waiting for this chance!"

Before Evelyn could react, Julian had summoned a staff member and was brandishing an actual baseball bat, his expression thunderous.

Evelyn caught his arm. "Julian, stop!"

"I'm running him off our property!" Julian stormed toward the gates, only to find the street empty. The car had vanished.

"He left?" Julian frowned, lowering the bat.

Evelyn joined him, sighing. "It's not what you think between us."

"Tell me truthfully - is he harassing you? Because I'll break both his legs if he's bothering you again."

Evelyn tugged him back toward the house with an exasperated smile. "Let it go. The past is past."

"Good! But remember - don't you dare break Harrison's heart, or you'll answer to me."

Evelyn blinked in surprise at her brother's unexpected loyalty. "Why are you so protective of Harrison? What aren't you telling me?"

Julian tapped her forehead. "Figure it out yourself this time. Just don't lose your head like before."

Evelyn's confusion only deepened as Julian strode inside, refusing to elaborate despite her persistent questions.

The next morning at Kingsley Industries, Evelyn had barely settled at her desk when Maxwell Donovan entered with urgent news. "Ms. Kingsley," he said grimly, "Director Hawthorne is making moves again."

Evelyn's expression hardened as Maxwell continued, "He's been taking out massive loans from the black market. The man's clearly desperate for cash."

"Desperate?" Evelyn's brows drew together. "What could Julian Hawthorne possibly need that much money for?"
###Chapter 465 The Jewelry Mishap

"His intentions remain unclear at this point. Not only has he secured loans from the black market, but he's also leveraged all his property holdings with the bank."

"This suggests he's planning something significant."

"Ms. Carter, could his actions be directed toward us?"

"Monitor his every move closely and update me immediately if anything develops."

"Understood, Ms. Carter."

Maxwell had barely taken two steps toward the exit when Evelyn called him back. "Before you go - does Julian have any events scheduled today?"

"Byte Technologies is hosting a major promotional event at Times Square Mall today. All our signed artists will be in attendance."

"I see," Evelyn murmured. That explained Julian's absence since morning. "Very well. You may go."

"Yes, Ms. Carter."

As Maxwell departed, Evelyn returned to her paperwork. Moments later, her private line rang.

"Evelyn, do you know the exact location of Julian's event today?" Sophia's voice carried urgent tension through the receiver.

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "What's happened?"

"Our assistant made a critical error during the morning rush," Sophia explained hurriedly. "She accidentally packed the unreleased jewelry collection for today's event. These pieces are under strict embargo until their official launch date."

"To make matters worse, the assistant isn't answering her phone, and Julian's manager seems to have vanished too."

Desperation laced Sophia's words as she continued, "That's why I'm calling you directly."

Evelyn's response came swiftly. "Don't panic. Julian and the team are at Times Square Mall. If you leave now, you should intercept them. I'll attempt contact as well."

"I'm heading there immediately."

The moment the call ended, Evelyn dialed Julian's private number. Despite multiple attempts, the line remained unanswered.

This was highly unusual. Julian never went anywhere without his personal phone. Even during events, his manager always kept it within reach. What could possibly be happening today?

Meanwhile, in a secluded backstage dressing room, Julian stood ready for his appearance, awaiting final approval.

His manager scrutinized him before suddenly exclaiming, "Julian! Where's your necklace?"

Julian's hand flew to his bare neck. "Hasn't the sponsor delivered the jewelry yet?"

The manager slapped his forehead. "My oversight! Wait here while I contact them."

Julian nodded as his manager hurried out. The sudden crash of falling objects from the adjacent room startled him to his feet.

He'd barely stepped into the hallway when Katherine's shrill voice pierced the air. "This is unacceptable incompetence! There's nothing wrong with these pieces - why can't I wear them?"

"My deepest apologies, Ms. Whitaker," a trembling voice replied. "These are prototype designs from our upcoming collection. They cannot be publicly displayed before the official launch. Please exchange them for the approved set."

Katherine's disdainful gaze swept over the replacement necklace being offered. The design paled in comparison to the exquisite piece currently adorning her neck.

"Do you take me for a fool?" She snatched the inferior necklace and flung it to the ground. "You expect me to wear this trash?"
###Chapter 466 Just a Mere 30 Million

"Please reconsider, Ms. Whitaker."

The assistant's voice trembled as she attempted to dissuade Katherine. But the actress merely scoffed, tossing the diamond necklace onto the marble floor with deliberate disdain.

"Exclusive content from NovelDrama.Org."

"Get this trash out of my sight."

A stunned silence fell over the dressing room. The entire team exchanged bewildered glances, their mouths agape at the blatant disrespect.

The assistant immediately dropped to her knees, carefully retrieving the delicate jewelry.

Her hands shook as she whispered, "Ms. Whitaker, we can request another piece from VERE immediately. But you cannot be seen wearing your current necklace at tonight's gala."

Katherine's eyes flashed with dangerous amusement. She tilted her chin defiantly, crossing her arms over her designer gown.

"And if I refuse?"

The assistant swallowed hard. "With all due respect, that simply isn't an option, Ms. Whitaker."

"Do you know who you're speaking to?" Katherine's voice turned glacial. "One word from me, and you'll be cleaning dressing rooms instead of assisting A-list talent."

Before the terrified assistant could respond, a new voice cut through the tension.

"Really? I'd love to see you try."

Sophia Whitmore strode through the gathered staff like a queen through her court. The assistant's eyes welled with relieved tears at the sight of her boss.

"Ms. Whitmore!" she choked out.

Sophia gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze before turning her piercing gaze on Katherine.

"We apologize for the mix-up, Ms. Whitaker. But there's no need for such theatrics over a simple misunderstanding."

Katherine examined her manicure with exaggerated boredom. She'd done her homework on Sophia after learning of her connection to Evelyn Carter.

The background check had revealed... interesting details.

"Your incompetent staff brought me inferior merchandise," Katherine sneered. "Shouldn't they be held accountable?"

Sophia remained unruffled. "Even so, you have no authority to discipline my employees."

A flush crept up Katherine's neck. "I was merely correcting unprofessional behavior."

"Let me make this clear, Ms. Whitaker. VERE sponsors this event, which means we decide who represents our brand." Sophia's voice turned razor-sharp. "Your conduct falls far below our standards. Consider our sponsorship withdrawn. Please remove our necklace immediately."

Katherine barked out a laugh. "This cheap bauble? Take it!"

With dramatic flourish, she ripped the necklace off and hurled it at Sophia.

"Your jewelry is as tasteless as your client selection."

The assistant gasped, scrambling to retrieve the fallen piece. Her hands trembled as she examined it.

"Ms. Whitmore... the clasp is broken."

Sophia's expression darkened as she inspected the damage. "Is this how you treat valuable property, Ms. Whitaker?"

Katherine rolled her eyes. "What, you want compensation? Name your price - it's probably less than I spend on weekly spa treatments."

Sophia's lips curled into a dangerous smile. "I doubt you can afford it."

"Please," Katherine scoffed. "To someone like you, everything seems expensive. Just tell me how much this costume jewelry costs so I can be rid of you."

Sophia arched one perfectly sculpted brow. "Oh, it's nothing too extravagant. Just thirty million dollars. Will that be cash or wire transfer?"
###Chapter 467 Bleeding Wound

Katherine stood frozen, her mouth slightly agape as the words registered. She blinked rapidly at Sophia Whitmore before stammering, "Excuse me? This... this necklace costs thirty million dollars?"

Sophia's expression remained unyielding. "Indeed. This is a VERE Jewelry exclusive, custom-designed piece. The diamond was specially sourced from South Lefreqa - a completely unique specimen."

She adjusted her designer glasses with deliberate slowness. "Commissioned personally by the chairman of Summit Corporation as a fiftieth anniversary gift for his wife."

"The valuation is accurate. Should you dispute this, we're fully prepared to pursue legal resolution."

Katherine's confidence visibly deflated. Though she'd enjoyed success in Hollywood, the reality was stark - most earnings went to her agency. Her personal net worth barely touched thirty million.

The weight of her impulsive promise pressed down on her. Backing out now would be public humiliation. Her manicured nails dug into her palms as she forced a smile. "It's just a necklace. I'll pay."

"Excellent." Sophia didn't hesitate. With a snap of her fingers, her assistant materialized with banking details.

"Whenever you're ready, Ms. Whitaker."

The transfer completed with painful efficiency. Within minutes, Sophia's phone chimed with confirmation. She extended the velvet case toward Katherine with exaggerated care.

"Your purchase, madam."

Katherine's fingers trembled slightly as she accepted it. The sting of financial loss burned, but pride demanded bravado. "Thirty million is pocket change. Though I imagine it took you decades of struggle to reach your position, Ms. Whitmore? Must have been... difficult."

A hush fell over the room. Even Julian Hartwell, observing from the periphery, tensed visibly.

Sophia's spine straightened imperceptibly. "Clarify your meaning."

Katherine's smile turned venomous. "Rumor has it you're an orphan, no? That Kingsley Industries charity case who barely scraped through design school." She twirled a lock of hair. "Or was even that education a fabrication?"

The blow landed exactly as intended. Sophia's breath hitched - her past was the unhealed wound she kept meticulously bandaged. Now ripped open before this glittering crowd.

"Cat got your tongue?" Katherine pressed. "Or just ashamed of your... origins?"

Sophia's gaze turned arctic. "State your point clearly."

"Why bother with pretense?" Katherine's laugh tinkled like breaking glass. "A nobody like you clawing your way up? A woman, no less." She leaned in, whispering loud enough for all to hear. "Tell us, how many beds did you crawl through to get here?"

Gasps erupted. Dozens of phones discreetly angled toward them.

Sophia's lips curved without warmth. "My secret to success? Not tolerating pathetic bullies like you."

The slap echoed like a gunshot. Katherine staggered back, her cheek blooming crimson.
###Chapter 468 The Setup

Evelyn gasped in shock. Her eyes widened as she stared at Sophia in utter disbelief. "You actually had the audacity to strike me?"

The crowd around them froze in stunned silence. The confrontation had escalated too rapidly for anyone to intervene.

Sophia tilted her chin up defiantly. "What of it? You were asking for it, weren't you?"

"You—"

Before Evelyn could retaliate, a hushed whisper spread through the gathering. "Mr. Hartwell!"

Evelyn's face paled instantly. She turned to see Julian standing near the entrance, his broad frame leaning casually against the doorframe.

His expression remained unreadable, those piercing dark eyes giving nothing away.

Evelyn's pulse quickened. "Julian... how long have you been standing there?"

Sophia felt ice flood her veins at the mention of Julian's name. Realization dawned - this was the legendary third son of the Kingsley family.

Had he witnessed the entire altercation? He must be furious at her for striking his actress.

Lowering her gaze, Sophia turned on her heel without another word, desperate to escape the humiliating situation.

Seeing her retreat, Evelyn seized the opportunity. She rushed to Julian's side with practiced tears already streaming down her cheeks. "Did you see what that woman did to me? She attacked me completely unprovoked!"

The spectators remained silent, none daring to contradict the powerful actress.

Julian's voice was dangerously calm. "She struck you?"

Evelyn nodded vigorously. "Julian, that woman is insane! Her employee brought the wrong necklace, and when I accidentally broke it, she demanded thirty million dollars! When I protested, she slapped me right here in public!"

She painted herself as the innocent victim, unsure how much Julian had actually witnessed.

Evelyn had spent years cultivating her image around Julian - the untouchable music mogul and heir to the Kingsley fortune. A man of his status was exactly what she needed to elevate her career.

She couldn't risk losing his favor now.

Julian's expression remained neutral, though disappointment churned beneath the surface. He'd never imagined she could lie so effortlessly.

"Is that truly what occurred?" He gave her one final chance to reconsider.

But Evelyn doubled down. "Julian, I would never lie to you! That woman is dangerous. I'm getting my lawyers involved - I'll sue her for every penny she's worth!"

Seeing her determination to maintain the charade, Julian simply turned away. "Do as you see fit."

Evelyn stood frozen, a creeping sense of unease settling in her stomach.

Meanwhile, Sophia had reached the lobby where Natalie was waiting.

Natalie took one look at Sophia's stormy expression and frowned. "What happened? Did you manage to exchange the necklace?"

Not wanting to worry her friend, Sophia forced a nod. "The necklace is beyond repair now. I need to handle this situation. If you'll excuse me, I should head back."

She left before Natalie could question her further, leaving the confused woman standing alone.

Moments later, Julian appeared. His eyes scanned the lobby urgently. "Have you seen Sophia? Where did she go?"
###Chapter 469 Does Your Hand Hurt

Evelyn Carter arched an eyebrow at Julian Hartwell's unusual agitation but chose not to pry.

She gestured toward the corridor. "Sophia just left that way. She couldn't have gone far."

Julian didn't waste another second. His long legs carried him swiftly in the indicated direction. Within moments, he spotted the familiar figure.

His breath hitched. Despite his efforts to remain composed, his steps quickened involuntarily.

"Sophia!" His voice echoed through the hallway.

Sophia Whitmore froze mid-step. Before she could react, Julian had closed the distance between them.

"Why the hurry?" His voice was softer than expected.

Sophia lifted her chin, her expression unreadable. "Here to demand retribution?"

Julian studied her silently, his gaze traveling downward until it settled on her right hand.

Sophia's fingers curled instinctively at his scrutiny.

"If you're here for justice, save your breath. I slapped her. I demanded the thirty million. Any further questions can go through my attorney."

The words tumbled out in a defensive rush, but Julian barely registered them.

"Does it hurt?" His question caught her off guard.

Sophia blinked, momentarily disoriented. "Excuse me?"

Julian stepped closer, his voice dropping to a murmur. "You hit her pretty hard earlier. Is your hand okay?"

She jerked her hand back instinctively, but Julian was faster, capturing her wrist.

"Let go!" Her protest lacked its usual bite.

"You don't have to handle everything alone, Sophia. Not like Evelyn does."

Confusion flickered across her features. She wrenched her hand free and averted her gaze.

"Shouldn't you be more concerned about your precious protégé? My hand is fine. But her face must be swelling nicely by now. Go comfort your little junior."

The venom in her voice when she said "junior" was unmistakable, yet Julian seemed oblivious.

"It's you I'm worried about," he admitted bluntly.

"I don't need your concern, Mr. Hartwell. Now if you'll excuse me, I have actual business to attend to."

With that, Sophia strode away, her heels clicking a rapid retreat. She moved as if demons chased her.

Julian remained rooted, watching her disappear around the corner with uncharacteristic bewilderment.

Later, Julian returned to the event hall.

Evelyn approached with a concerned frown. "Julian, the ceremony starts in five. What's wrong?"

He forced a smile that didn't reach his eyes. "Nothing to worry about."

His manager appeared just then, breathless. "Mr. Hartwell, we need you backstage now."

Julian gave Evelyn an apologetic nod. "Duty calls."

Evelyn watched him go, then turned to leave. A sudden commotion made her pause as Katherine Whitaker emerged from backstage in tears.

Spotting Evelyn, Katherine rushed over and clutched her arm. "Ms. Carter, please help me!"

Evelyn frowned. "What's happened?" Her voice remained calm despite her growing unease.

As Katherine lifted her tear-streaked face, Evelyn noticed the angry red mark blooming across her cheek. Her stomach dropped.

She looked to Katherine's assistant for explanation, but the younger woman remained silent, eyes downcast.

Evelyn pressed on. "Katherine, tell me what's going on."
###Chapter 470 Get Justice for Me

Tears cascaded down Katherine's delicate cheeks. Her porcelain features twisted in distress, making her appear heartbreakingly vulnerable.

"Take a deep breath. Tell me what's wrong." Evelyn's voice was steady as she handed over a tissue.

Katherine's sobs intensified, drawing curious glances from passersby. Evelyn's brow furrowed slightly at the unwanted attention.

After several shuddering breaths, Katherine finally composed herself. "Ms. Carter... VERE Jewelry canceled my endorsement deal. And Ms. Whitmore... she struck me." Her trembling finger pointed to a faint mark on her cheekbone.

Evelyn's expression darkened. She knew Sophia Whitmore intimately - the woman had clawed her way to success through sheer talent and relentless work ethic.

Sophia wasn't the type to initiate conflict. Evelyn would stake her reputation on that.

"Walk me through exactly what happened," Evelyn said evenly.

Katherine misinterpreted Evelyn's calm as belief. She launched into a dramatic retelling, carefully omitting key details and exaggerating others.

Evelyn listened with growing disbelief. The story was riddled with inconsistencies. "Let me clarify - you're saying Ms. Whitmore personally terminated your contract?"

"Yes!" Katherine nodded eagerly, missing Evelyn's skeptical tone. "She's targeting me! Her employee made a mistake with the necklace, but she demanded I pay for it."

Katherine clutched Evelyn's arm desperately. "She took thirty million dollars from me like it was nothing. My entire savings! You have to make this right."

A cold smile touched Evelyn's lips. The pieces weren't fitting together. There had to be more to this story.

"If you've truly been wronged, I'll ensure justice is served."

Katherine's eyes lit up with triumph. Perhaps Evelyn and Sophia's friendship wasn't as strong as rumored.

"Thank you! Just get my money back and-"

Evelyn held up a hand. "Before I intervene, I need the full truth. Your version has... gaps."

Katherine paled. "What do you mean?"

"You said this happened in a backstage lounge at Longacre?" Evelyn's gaze sharpened. "Every private room there has 24/7 surveillance. Shall we review the footage together?"

Katherine swayed on her feet. "Surveillance?" Her voice cracked with panic.

"Standard practice for high-profile venues." Evelyn tilted her head. "Surely you knew that, Ms. Whitaker?"

Katherine's mouth opened and closed like a fish. Her carefully constructed story was crumbling.

"That won't be necessary!" she blurted. "Our company still hopes to work with VERE Jewelry in the future. This... misunderstanding isn't worth damaging that relationship."

She forced a shaky smile. "My personal loss means nothing compared to Kingsley Industries' interests."
###Chapter 471 Contract Termination

Evelyn's lips curled into a smirk. "Thirty million dors must be pocket change for someone like you."

Katherine felt an icy shiver crawl down her spine.

"Ms. Carter, I—"

Evelyn cut her off, her expression unyielding.

"Save it. You're one of my artists. Protecting you is my responsibility. Let's review the surveillance footage. If Sophia Whitmore is truly at fault, justice will be served."

"Ms. Carter, this isn't necessary—"

Evelyn's tone sharpened, her gaze piercing. "Why? Guilty conscience?"

"Of course not."

"Then we proceed."

Katherine's pulse raced as Evelyn's determination left no room for argument. Panic clawed at her throat.

What now?

"After you." Evelyn gestured toward the door.

With no other choice, Katherine followed, her steps heavy.

Fate had a cruel sense of humor—Julian stood in the control room when they entered.

"Julian? Shouldn't you be at the event?"

He didn't answer. His eyes locked onto Katherine instead.

She avoided his gaze, but desperation surged. She lunged forward, clutching his arm.

"Julian, thank God you're here! You saw everything. Tell Ms. Carter the truth!"

Julian pulled away, his face unreadable.

Katherine froze. "Julian...?"

Evelyn glanced at the monitors, understanding dawning. She crossed her arms.

"Care to explain, Ms. Whitaker?"

Katherine shook her head frantically. "Julian, it's not what you think—let me explain!"

Julian didn't spare her another glance. He met Evelyn's eyes. "I've seen the footage. Sophia handled the situation flawlessly."

A silent understanding passed between them.

"Go to the event," Evelyn said. "Don't keep them waiting. I'll handle the rest."

Julian nodded and walked away without hesitation.

"Julian—wait!"

Her pleas fell on deaf ears. He vanished down the hall, severing their connection with finality.

The moment he disappeared, Katherine's mask shattered.

"Evelyn Carter!" She spat the name like venom.

"Terminate my contract. Kingsley Industries' talent department is a joke. You can't even secure decent resources."

Her laugh was bitter. "I only joined for Julian. Clearly, that was a mistake. Consider this my resignation."

Evelyn studied her with cold amusement. The transformation was impressive—from victim to viper in seconds.

No wonder Sophia had seen through her.

"Our contract was for five years," Evelyn reminded her. "Breaking it now comes with a penalty. Are you prepared to pay?"
###Chapter 472 A Crushing Fine

"Fine?" Katherine whispered, her voice trembling.

She swallowed hard before asking, "What fine? I don't recall that clause in our contract."

Evelyn Carter arched one perfectly shaped eyebrow. "Ms. Whitaker, did you sign without reading the terms?"

Katherine's stomach dropped. That was precisely what she'd done. In her eagerness to impress Julian Hartwell during the signing, she'd barely glanced at the paperwork.

Her signature had been scrawled carelessly across every page without review.

Panic clawed at Katherine's throat as she twisted the fabric of her blouse between nervous fingers. The nest egg she'd carefully saved had already been depleted on designer outfits. There was nothing left for exorbitant penalties.

But what choice did she have now?

"How... how much is it?" Her voice cracked like thin ice. Her pulse roared in her ears.

Evelyn's lips curved into a humorless smile. "Terminating now requires a breach penalty of fifty million dors."

"The exact amount... well, that depends entirely on my discretion."

Katherine's legs buckled. Only one thought screamed through her mind:

She was ruined!

"Ms. Carter, please," she begged, hands clasped in supplication. "Have mercy."

Though she'd initiated the termination, Katherine spoke as if Evelyn were the villain here.

"Ms. Whitaker, you requested contract dissolution. Kingsley Industries respects employee autonomy."

"Should you reconsider, that's acceptable. Though your career trajectory within the company may require... reevaluation."

Katherine nodded frantically, strands of hair coming loose from her updo. "I take it back! My mistake, Ms. Carter. I want to stay."

Evelyn folded her arms, gaze glacial. "Very well. However, you'll receive no further resources or support."

The color drained from Katherine's face.

"You can't do this!"

She'd gained modest recognition in the industry. With proper backing, she could have built a respectable career.

"Please, Ms. Carter! I'll behave. No more trouble. Just don't blacklist me!"

Without company resources, she'd vanish from public view. Forgotten before her next Instagram post could upload.

Katherine's breath came in shallow gasps. No resources meant no roles. No roles meant no income.

No income meant she couldn't afford the penalty. She'd be trapped for the contract's full duration.

Five endless years.

An eternity in entertainment. Even if she returned afterward, she'd be yesterday's news.

Tears carved hot paths down her contorted face. Ugly, heaving sobs wracked her frame.

Evelyn remained unmoved. "You're an adult, Ms. Whitaker. Choices have consequences."

With that, she turned on her designer heels.

Katherine lunged forward, blocking the exit. "Wait! I'm Julian's protégée! I'll generate profits! Take any role! Just don't bench me!"
###Chapter 473 I Quit

Katherine was utterly terrified. There was no escape for her now.

"Are you certain?" Evelyn asked, her voice cool and measured.

Katherine's face brightened at the slight softening in Evelyn's tone. She answered quickly, "Absolutely! I'll do anything—just give me one more chance."

Evelyn considered it for a moment. "You won't regret this?"

"No, I won't."

"Let me think about it."

Relief flooded Katherine like a tidal wave. "Thank you, Ms. Carter! Thank you!"

The moment Evelyn left, Katherine collapsed onto the floor, her back slick with sweat. She smacked her forehead in frustration.

Why had she ever signed with Kingsley Industries? At least she still had a shot. If Evelyn kept feeding her resources, she could scrape together enough to buy out her contract and escape this nightmare.

Once she was free, she'd make Evelyn pay.

But while Katherine was busy dreaming of revenge, Evelyn had already anticipated her next move. The next day, Katherine was assigned her new role.

She exploded the second she saw it.

"What? You're making me a receptionist?"

Maxwell Donovan held out the uniform with a polite smile. "Direct orders from Ms. Carter."

"I'm a star! I bring in millions for this company! What kind of joke is this? Who would even take this job? No way. I'm talking to Evelyn about this."

Maxwell adjusted his glasses. "Ms. Carter has a packed schedule. I doubt she'll have time for you, Ms. Whitaker."

He continued smoothly, "The receptionist position pays six thousand a month. It's not celebrity money, but it covers basic expenses."

"Six thousand? Are you serious?" Katherine scoffed. "I used to make millions a month! That wouldn't even cover my lunch!"

Maxwell's smile didn't waver. "If this isn't to your liking, we can transfer you to another position. The cleaning department has an opening, but the pay is even lower. Would you prefer that?"

Katherine nearly lost it.

"Get Evelyn here right now! I want to talk to her face-to-face. She's trying to humiliate me! I won't stand for this!"

Her voice echoed through the office, drawing curious stares and hushed whispers.

The attention only fueled her rage.

"What are you all looking at? Get lost! I quit! I'm done with this!"

Just then, Evelyn happened to walk by. The crowd scattered instantly.

Katherine spotted her and called out, "Ms. Carter! I refuse to be a receptionist—or a cleaner!"

Evelyn didn't even glance her way as she stepped into the elevator.

Maxwell adjusted his tie. "Ms. Whitaker, just do your job. Maybe if you behave, Ms. Carter will reconsider."

His tone turned sharper. "But if you keep causing scenes, she might just cut you off for good."
###Chapter 474 Step Down

Maxwell Donovan turned on his heel and strode out without another word.

Katherine Whitaker stood rooted to the spot, her complexion draining of all color.

...

In the executive suite of Kingsley Industries, Evelyn Carter had just settled into her chair when Maxwell entered. She didn't bother glancing up as her pen continued dancing across the documents.

Maxwell approached her desk respectfully. "Ms. Carter, it's done."

Evelyn's wrist flicked gracefully as she signed the final page with a flourish. "Good. Now we wait to see how she reacts."

"Understood, Ms. Carter. There's something else..." Maxwell hesitated.

Evelyn finally looked up, her sharp gaze meeting his. "Yes?"

"Have you seen today's news coverage?" Maxwell asked instead of answering. "About the groundbreaking ceremony for that prime property Sterling Enterprises secured from the city?"

Evelyn's eyebrow arched. Juliette Blackwood worked fast. Securing that coveted southside parcel in just two weeks? And breaking ground already?

On the screen behind them, Nexa News was broadcasting live footage of the event. Juliette beamed for the cameras as golden shovels turned ceremonial dirt. A high-ranking city official stood beside her, lending gravitas to the occasion.

For a relatively new player like Sterling Enterprises, this project had become an unexpected crown jewel - the kind of government-backed development that guaranteed profits and prestige.

In the Kingsley Industries boardroom, directors exchanged frustrated glances as they watched the coverage.

"We warned Ms. Carter months ago to bid on that project," one muttered. "Instead she poured resources into those speculative tech ventures."

"And what do we have to show for it?" another snapped. "While our competitors celebrate, we're left empty-handed."

"Real estate remains the safest investment," a third director chimed in. "Government partnerships are foolproof. Yet we let this slip through our fingers."

Julian Hawthorne concealed his satisfaction behind a carefully neutral expression. His alliance with Juliette had paid off beautifully.

Now he'd watch how Evelyn planned to recover from this strategic blunder.

"Director Hawthorne," a board member leaned forward, "we should have listened to you. A woman's leadership has cost us dearly."

"Indeed," another agreed. "Perhaps it's time we reconsider the company's leadership structure."

Julian held up a placating hand. "Let's not be hasty. Remember Ms. Carter's... family connections."

The mention of the Kingsley name silenced the room momentarily before all eyes turned to Julian.

"What do you suggest?" someone finally asked.

Julian's smile was all calculated modesty. "Patience, gentlemen. Have you forgotten my wager with Ms. Carter? The deadline approaches, and our performance metrics remain... disappointing."

"Ah yes!" A director brightened. "That clever clause of yours. When she fails to meet targets, even the Kingsleys can't protect her position."
###Chapter 475 The One That Got Away

"What a shame we let such a golden opportunity slip through our fingers. I should've put my own money into it. The returns would've been spectacular," one of the board members lamented, shaking his head.

Julian Hawthorne smirked. The regret in their voices only made his satisfaction grow. Thank heavens he'd had the foresight to invest privately.

Construction on the project was already underway. The first residential units would hit the market next month. His initial investment would be repaid in no time.

"Look who just walked in," someone murmured.

All heads turned toward the entrance.

"If it isn't Ms. Carter. Shall we go greet her?" suggested Director Langley. The others nodded, falling into step behind him.

"Ms. Carter!"

Evelyn Carter froze mid-step at the sound of her name. She turned to find the board members advancing toward her, their expressions unreadable.

"How can I help you, gentlemen?"

Director Langley, leading the pack, scoffed. "Seen the headlines lately, Ms. Carter? That southside development project you vetoed? It's breaking ground as we speak."

Evelyn's face remained impassive, but her fingers tightened around her tablet. She knew exactly where this was going.

"You seem awfully invested in that project, Director Langley. Pity Kingsley Industries didn't secure a stake."

Langley's face flushed crimson. "We missed that stake because you blocked it at every turn. Tell me, Ms. Carter—does this failure reflect your capability as our CEO?"

"Absolutely," another chimed in. "Had we invested, we'd be reaping profits alongside Sterling Enterprises right now."

"And what of that 'emerging industry' you championed? Still no signs of life. Julian Hartwell remains our only noteworthy talent."

"We warned you—our company isn't built for risky ventures. Real estate was the safe bet. We'd be counting our profits by now."

The criticisms came rapid-fire, each voice sharper than the last.

Julian's eyes gleamed with triumph. "Now, now, gentlemen. Let's not gang up on Ms. Carter. Everyone makes mistakes."

The room quieted at his intervention. Smug, he stepped through the crowd toward Evelyn.

"We must show our CEO due respect. After all..." He held up four fingers, wagging them in her face.

"...you still have four months left. Try not to embarrass yourself further."

Evelyn's expression didn't flicker. Their words rolled off her like water.

Before she could respond, a smooth voice cut through the tension. "Gentlemen, forgive the interruption—but may I pose a question?"

Harrison Whitmore materialized beside her like a guardian shadow. The moment he appeared, Evelyn's shoulders relaxed imperceptibly.

"Mr. Whitmore? Of Horizon Technologies?"

"Your reputation precedes you, sir."

"Ask away, Mr. Whitmore! We're at your disposal."

Harrison moved with effortless grace, positioning himself beside Evelyn. His gaze, sharp as a blade, swept over the assembled men. "I was just wondering..."

###Chapter 476 Failure Is Not an Option

The boardroom fell silent as all eyes turned to Harrison Whitmore. He leaned casually against the polished mahogany table, his piercing gaze sweeping across the assembled directors.

"I have a question that's been bothering me," Harrison began, his voice smooth yet commanding. "You're all executives of Kingsley Industries, correct?"

"Obviously," one director snapped, adjusting his tie nervously.

Harrison's lips curled into a knowing smile. "And your annual bonuses are directly tied to the company's performance, aren't they? So why, pray tell, are you making life difficult for Ms. Carter?"

A ripple of discomfort spread through the room. Several directors shifted in their seats, avoiding eye contact.

Julian Hawthorne's face darkened. "What exactly are you implying, Mr. Whitmore?"

Harrison straightened, his posture radiating authority. "Evelyn has been working tirelessly for this company's success, yet you treat her with nothing but contempt. It makes one wonder where your true loyalties lie."

The temperature in the room seemed to drop several degrees. Julian's face flushed crimson as he slammed his fist on the table. "That's outrageous! Every decision we've made has been for Kingsley Industries' benefit!"

"If Evelyn had followed our advice and invested in the southern district development," Julian continued, his voice rising, "the returns would have been astronomical! That project could have elevated our company to new heights!"

Harrison shook his head slowly, like a teacher disappointed with a failing student. "You're wrong."

The directors erupted in protest. "How dare you!" "What do you know about our business?"

A calm smile played on Harrison's lips. "I know enough to say with certainty that project isn't what you think. Give it a month. The truth will reveal itself."

Without another word, Harrison turned to Evelyn, his expression softening. He took her hand gently, giving it a reassuring squeeze. "Let's go, Evelyn."

Evelyn nodded, allowing Harrison to guide her from the tense boardroom. The heavy doors hadn't even closed behind them when the shouting began.

"Director Hawthorne, what was he talking about?"
"A month? What happens in a month?"
"Harrison Whitmore runs Horizon Technologies! If he's warning us about this project..."

Julian's face twisted in fury. "Enough! Since when do we take business advice from outsiders? Did you not see the reports? Sterling Enterprises is thriving because of this exact project!"

He glared at each director in turn. "I'll stake my reputation on this. If that project fails, I'll change my damn name! Only fools would listen to baseless rumors."

The directors exchanged uneasy glances but remained silent. None dared voice what they all knew - Julian had invested his entire fortune in that development, even taking out massive loans.

For Julian Hawthorne, failure wasn't just an option - it was an impossibility.

The car ride was quiet except for the hum of the engine. Evelyn stared out the window, her reflection ghostly against the passing cityscape. The tension from the meeting still clung to her like a second skin.

Harrison glanced at her profile, noting the tightness around her eyes. "You're thinking too hard," he murmured.

Evelyn exhaled sharply, her breath fogging the glass. "I just... I can't shake this feeling." Her fingers twisted in her lap, restless and uneasy.

The city lights blurred past as Harrison navigated the evening traffic, giving Evelyn space to process. Sometimes silence spoke louder than words. And right now, the quiet between them said everything.
###Chapter 477 Dinner

"Harrison, do you ever wonder if I made the right choice not investing in that waterfront property?" Evelyn's fingers tapped nervously against the car window.

Harrison kept his eyes on the road but his grip tightened on the steering wheel. "Second thoughts already, Evelyn?"

She sighed, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "It's just...their arguments were compelling. If we—"

"Trust your instincts," Harrison interrupted. "That deal smelled fishy from the start."

Evelyn's gaze snapped to him, curiosity sparking in her hazel eyes. She leaned closer, the scent of his cologne wrapping around her. "You know something I don't?"

The corner of Harrison's mouth lifted as he glanced at her. In the reflection of her wide eyes, he could see the streetlights dancing like fireflies. "No inside information. Just common sense. That project moved suspiciously fast."

His fingers drummed against the leather steering wheel. "Since when does coastal development get approved overnight? Red flags everywhere."

Evelyn chewed her bottom lip, considering his words. "You're right. But what's the catch?"

The car fell silent except for the hum of the engine.

Harrison shook his head with a soft chuckle. "Stop overanalyzing. The truth will surface soon enough."

As they exited the highway, Evelyn blinked at the familiar gated community. "Harrison, why are we at your penthouse?"

"Dinner plans," he said simply, parking in his private garage.

Evelyn's heels clicked against the marble floor as Harrison guided her inside. The staff bowed respectfully.

"Welcome home, Mr. Whitmore and Ms. Carter," the head housekeeper greeted.

"Everything prepared, Beatrice?" Harrison asked, shrugging off his suit jacket.

The older woman's eyes twinkled. "The kitchen is fully stocked, sir. I'll take my leave now."

Evelyn caught the knowing look Beatrice gave them before disappearing down the hall. "What exactly—"

Harrison silenced her with a finger to her lips. "Relax. Watch some terrible reality TV." He tossed her the remote. "I'll call you when it's ready."

Before she could protest, Harrison had tied an apron around his waist and vanished behind the kitchen's frosted glass doors.

Curiosity got the better of her. Evelyn tiptoed closer, peering through the gap in the doors. The sight of Harrison chopping vegetables with practiced ease made her breath catch. The rhythmic sound of knife against cutting board mingled with the sizzle of something in a pan.

A warmth spread through her chest that had nothing to do with the penthouse's climate control. This domestic version of the powerful CEO was somehow more intoxicating than any boardroom victory. She pressed a hand to her suddenly racing heart, unaware of the smile blooming on her lips.

The simple intimacy of the moment felt more precious than any five-star restaurant.
###Chapter 478 Culinary Magic

Harrison Whitmore possessed an extraordinary talent in the kitchen. Within just sixty minutes, he had transformed fresh ingredients into a mouthwatering feast.

"Lobster thermidor, seared scallops with truffle butter, creamy clam chowder, honey-glazed ribs, roasted vegetables, and bouillabaisse..." Evelyn Carter's eyes sparkled as she listed each dish with growing excitement.

"You're incredible, Harrison! These are literally all my comfort foods."

A warm smile curved his lips as his gaze softened upon her. He stepped closer, gently taking her hand. "Wash up first, darling."

Evelyn practically bounced to the powder room. Returning with freshly cleaned hands, she rummaged through Harrison's marble-top kitchen for silverware, arranging the utensils with playful precision.

He pulled out a velvet-cushioned chair for her. Their knees nearly touched beneath the linen-draped table.

"Be brutally honest with your critiques," he teased, pouring her a glass of sparkling water.

She took deliberate bites of each dish, savoring the complex flavors. "Harrison Whitmore, this is Michelin-star level."

He loaded her plate with second helpings. "Then eat like you mean it."

"Wait!" She threw up her hands. "This masterpiece deserves documentation first."

Dashing to retrieve her phone from the living room, she circled the table like a food stylist, capturing golden-hour shots of the spread.

"Mr. Thornton suggested I chronicle life's beautiful moments," she murmured, opening the Byte app. "This deserves a proper post."

Harrison pulled out his own device. "What's your handle? I'll be your first follower."

"Just search my contact."

His fingers flew across the screen. Within seconds, a notification popped up on Evelyn's phone - @HarrisonWhitmoreOfficial had followed her.

She selected a dreamy filter, paired it with a jazz instrumental, and tapped 'Share.'

"Done! Now, let's destroy this artwork."

Tossing her phone aside, she attacked the lobster with renewed vigor. Laughter bubbled between bites - this was the first home-cooked meal she'd enjoyed in months. Between business trips and late nights at Kingsley Industries, most dinners were sad desk salads.

"Harrison," she sighed between spoonfuls of chowder, "I'd commit crimes for weekly access to this kitchen."

"My door's always open for you, Evelyn."

"You're dangerously generous."

"Less talking, more eating." He slid the ribs closer to her.

Post-dinner, Evelyn's attention snagged on Harrison's climate-controlled wine cellar visible through glass panels. Rows of dust-covered bottles glimmered under recessed lighting.

"Harrison, what's in these mysterious bottles?"

Wiping his hands on a dish towel, he joined her. "Private reserve from my Napa vineyard. Care for a tasting?"

Her fingers traced a 1982 Bordeaux. "This label alone belongs in a museum."

The cork released with a satisfying pop. The first sip danced between tart cherries and velvety chocolate. "Oh. My. God."

Harrison produced two crystal glasses with a magician's flourish.

"Perfect evening for rooftop stargazing," he suggested, nodding toward the spiral staircase.

"Yes!"

The penthouse's private terrace took Evelyn's breath away. Harrison had transformed it into an urban oasis - potted olive trees framed a copper firepit, while a hanging daybed swayed gently in the breeze.

But as Manhattan's skyline twinkled before them, an inexplicable nostalgia tightened Evelyn's chest.

"This view... it feels like déjà vu." Her fingers absentmindedly rubbed her collarbone. "Have we been here before?"
###Chapter 479 DÃ©jÃ  Vu

Evelyn Carter experienced an unsettling wave of familiarity. She furrowed her brows, struggling to place where she'd encountered this exact view before.

Harrison Whitmore's lips curved into a knowing smile at her confusion.

He'd purchased this penthouse three years prior - right after learning of Evelyn's impending marriage to Nathan Sterling and their relocation to Pamore.

The extensive renovations had consumed two full years. After completion, the space had remained untouched for months.

Harrison only began occupying the residence after transferring his corporate headquarters to Pamore and establishing Horizon Technologies.

"Perhaps luxury penthouses share similar architectural designs," Harrison offered vaguely.

Evelyn nodded, dismissing the nagging sensation. "That must be it."

They settled onto the terrace seating. Harrison presented her with a crystal flute filled with ruby-hued wine. "Try this vintage."

Evelyn sipped thoughtfully, her gaze drifting skyward. "The night sky looks breathtaking tonight. I can actually distinguish constellations - when was the last time I stargazed?"

A wistful expression crossed her features. "I remember during university days, you, Victor Langley, Julian Hartwell, and I would spread blankets on the quad and identify stars. Decades later, those memories feel like yesterday."

Harrison followed her upward gaze. After a contemplative pause, he remarked, "Over a decade has passed, hasn't it?"

"Fourteen years," Evelyn confirmed. "I was a junior then, while you three were graduating seniors."

She chuckled suddenly. "And I distinctly recall how hordes of female students pursued you. They flooded your locker with love letters and gifts, yet you discarded them unread."

Harrison shrugged. "Why entertain false hopes? Direct rejection proved kinder in the long run."

Evelyn's laughter sparkled like the stars above. "Always brutally honest, Harrison. But we were so young then - what did any of us truly understand about love?"

She drained her glass in one smooth motion, savoring the rich berry notes lingering on her palate. "Another pour, please."

"Moderation, Evelyn. This vintage carries unexpected potency."

She waved off his concern. "It's merely wine. What harm could come from indulging tonight?"

The deceptive sweetness masked its strength. By her second bottle, the world developed a pleasant tilt.

"Harrison... why are there two of you?" Evelyn giggled, rising unsteadily.

He caught her swaying form. "You're intoxicated. Let's get you to bed."

Evelyn clung to his forearm. "Nonsense! I want another bottle!"

"You're thoroughly drunk."

"Am not!"

His voice dropped to a velvet murmur. "Behave, darling." The command worked like magic - Evelyn stilled instantly, blinking up at him with glassy admiration.

"Come, we'll rest in the guest suite."

This time, she complied without protest.

In the moonlit bedroom, Harrison watched Evelyn's sleeping form. As he adjusted the duvet, she murmured incoherently before burrowing deeper into the covers.

Harrison remained seated bedside, lost in bittersweet recollections as moonlight traced Evelyn's peaceful features.
###Chapter 480 Youth

"Rise and shine, Evelyn. First day of school. Don't make us late."

Outside the bedroom door, Elliot stood with his backpack slung over one shoulder, rapping his knuckles impatiently against the wood.

Evelyn groaned into her pillow. Though awake, she remained cocooned in her blankets like a stubborn caterpillar resisting metamorphosis.

Her muffled voice drifted through the door. "I heard you, Elliot."

Elliot checked his watch with a sigh. After exchanging quick words with the house staff, he dashed off to campus.

True to form, Evelyn required multiple reminders from the staff before finally dragging herself from bed. Predictably, she arrived late on her very first day.

"Evelyn Carter, is it? Late on your inaugural day. Your punishment is to sweep every stair in this building."

Accepting the broom with visible reluctance, Evelyn began her tedious task. Halfway through, a familiar shadow fell across her work.

Elliot leaned casually against the upper railing, his smirk dripping with smug satisfaction. "How many times did I tell you to get up? Now look at you - the school's newest janitor."

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line as she swatted at his ankles with the broom. "Move. I'm working."

His laughter echoed through the stairwell. "Better hurry, little sis. The teacher's coming to inspect soon."

With a huff, Evelyn grabbed his wrist. "Get lost."

"Your wish is my command," Elliot teased, pulling free. "Though I was going to offer help."

Evelyn crossed her arms. "I don't need it. Just disappear."

As if summoned by her frustration, Harrison materialized behind Elliot. He placed a steadying hand on Elliot's shoulder.

"Let's assist her. This is too much for one person."

Evelyn's face lit up. She stuck her tongue out at Elliot. "See? Harrison's actually decent. Unlike some brothers I know."

Elliot's jaw dropped. "Decent? He's the one who suggested this punishment! Your selective memory astounds me."

Turning to Harrison with gratitude, Evelyn said, "Thanks for helping."

Harrison took the broom without expression. "The faster we finish, the sooner you can return to class."

"Right."

Evelyn redoubled her efforts, though her pace paled in comparison to Harrison's efficient movements.

"Wait for me, Harrison!"

Pausing mid-sweep, Harrison said, "You should go to class. We'll handle this."

Elliot protested, "But—"

A single look from Harrison silenced him. Recognizing defeat, Elliot turned to his sister.

"Harrison's right. Go on, Ev."

When Evelyn hesitated, Elliot gently pushed her toward the classrooms. "Shoo."

Once she was out of earshot, Elliot opened his mouth to speak but noticed Harrison had nearly completed the task.

"Harrison, you shouldn't coddle her. This spoiled princess needs to learn responsibility."

"Princesses shouldn't have to clean stairs," Harrison replied without looking up. "That's what knights are for."

Elliot could only stare, utterly speechless.
###Chapter 481 Guardian Angel

"That's not the point. Finals are just around the corner, and we should be focusing every second on studying!"

Harrison didn't even flinch. "A few minutes won't make or break my grades."

His gaze swept across the courtyard before nodding in approval. "Looks clean enough now. Let's go back."

Elliot was speechless.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had learned her lesson after that first tardy incident. She never showed up late again.

In fact, she started waking up thirty minutes earlier than Elliot every morning, determined to maintain her perfect attendance record.

That morning, Evelyn stepped out of her family car at the school gates when she spotted her classmate, Maxwell Thornton.

Maxwell was the quintessential honor student - brilliant, driven, and always eager to discuss academics with fellow high-achievers like Evelyn.

"Evelyn!" Maxwell called out, adjusting his glasses. "Did you complete those calculus problems from yesterday's lecture? I'd love to compare answers."

"Wait, we had homework on that?"

"Page 98, problems 15 through 25. Don't tell me you forgot?"

Evelyn's stomach dropped. She'd completely blanked on the assignment. "O-of course I did them."

"Great. Professor Whitaker's collecting them during first period."

Evelyn's palms grew clammy. Their calculus professor was notoriously strict, known for publicly shaming students who came unprepared. The entire class lived in fear of his wrath.

As a top student, Evelyn had always avoided such humiliation. But if he discovered she'd neglected her homework...

Her perfect academic record would be ruined.

How could she ever face her classmates again?

"Actually, I just remembered something urgent," Evelyn said quickly. "You go ahead without me."

Her heart pounded as Maxwell walked away.

Spotting a secluded bench near the library, Evelyn sprinted over and frantically pulled out her textbook.

But the problems were complex - far more challenging than she'd anticipated. Her pencil hovered uncertainly over the page.

"Need some help, Evie?" Harrison's voice startled her as he rolled up on his bike.

Seeing her hunched over the textbook, he smirked. "Forgot your homework?"

Evelyn nearly burst into tears. At that moment, Harrison might as well have descended from heaven. "These problems are impossible! I don't even know where to start!"

Parking his bike, Harrison plucked the textbook from her hands. His eyes scanned the page briefly before nodding. "Give me your pen."

Evelyn handed it over without hesitation. Harrison scribbled solutions with surprising speed, his handwriting miraculously matching hers. Within minutes, the assignment was complete.

Evelyn gasped at the flawless work. "You're incredible, Harrison!"

He arched an eyebrow. "Get to class."

Relief flooded through her as she packed up. "You're my guardian angel today. Ice cream after school - my treat! Meet me at the main gate!"

With a grateful wave, she dashed toward the building.

Harrison watched her go, an uncharacteristic smile tugging at his lips.
###Chapter 482 Sisters Before Misters

Evelyn Carter always kept her promises. Her class finished earlier than Harrison's that day. The moment the bell rang, she dashed to the school gates to wait for him.

She spotted Elliot, Julian, and Harrison cycling out moments later. Elliot waved first. "Finally showing some sense by waiting for your brothers, huh?"

Julian chimed in, "But we already planned to hit the arcade before heading home. Why don't you take the car back first?"

Evelyn's gaze locked onto Harrison standing behind them. "Who said I was waiting for you two? Let's go, Harrison!"

The brothers exchanged shocked glances. "Wait. You were waiting for Harrison, Evie?"

Evelyn nodded with a hum. "I owe him proper thanks for helping me this morning. You two can leave if there's nothing else."

Elliot turned to Harrison with a warning look. "You promised to game with us at the arcade, man."

"Yeah! We haven't finished our match!" Julian added.

Gaming was their top priority, so they naturally assumed Harrison felt the same.

Elliot immediately refused on Harrison's behalf. "He can't go with you today, Evelyn. Reschedule."

"It's fine, Evie. Let's go," Harrison said, stunning both brothers.

"What about our game?" Julian protested.

Harrison replied seriously, "We're fifteen now. Should cut back on gaming and focus on exams."

Elliot and Julian shared another look.

Who was the one who'd suggested arcade time in the first place? Since when did he care about exams?

Evelyn beamed. "You're the best, Harrison! Come on, I'm treating you to ice cream."

As they walked away, Julian muttered, "Doesn't it feel like Harrison's place in Evie's heart has surpassed ours, Elliot?"

Elliot narrowed his eyes. "Harrison and his damn 'chicks before bros' mentality!"

"What chicks?" Julian frowned. Evelyn was their only sister, the family's darling. What did this have to do with chicks?

"It's sisters before misters, Elliot!"

Elliot looked at his brother like he was an idiot. "Only you and Evie are blind to Harrison's intentions. Whatever. Let's go home."

Julian looked confused. "What intentions? Explain!"

He chased after Elliot, demanding answers. But his brother remained silent, leaving Julian with endless questions.

Meanwhile, Evelyn led Harrison to a premium ice cream parlor. "Order anything you want. My treat," she offered graciously.

As Harrison scanned the menu, Evelyn started recommending flavors. "This place has the creamiest ice cream in town. Melts perfectly on your tongue. Only place I never get tired of."

"Then I'll try it," Harrison agreed.
###Chapter 483 The Ice Cream Obsession

Evelyn nodded eagerly and signaled the waiter to order two premium ice cream platters.

"Harrison, you have to try this one! It's strawberry swirl, and this is Madagascar vanilla. Oh, and this one's Belgian chocolate—"

Harrison picked up his silver spoon and took a tentative bite under Evelyn's watchful gaze. "Well? What do you think?"

He gave a slight nod. "It's... acceptable."

Evelyn clapped her hands together. "I knew you'd appreciate it!"

Harrison took another spoonful, this time more confidently. "The texture is remarkably smooth. I can see why you're so fond of this brand."

"Exactly! And their marketing is brilliant too," Evelyn said, turning one of the elegant containers to show him. "See? 'Among automobiles, there's Rolls Royce. Among ice creams, there's Häagen-Dazs.'"

She flipped to another container. "And this one says, 'Every second with you is filled with love. I'll cherish you when you least expect it.'"

Harrison's fingers stilled on his spoon when she showed him the third container: "If you love her, bring her Häagen-Dazs."

Evelyn continued enthusiastically pointing out different slogans on each container, completely missing how Harrison's gaze kept returning to that particular phrase.

Later that evening, Harrison arrived home with an appliance store delivery team. "Take this directly to the master suite," he instructed, pointing upstairs.

Beatrice emerged from the kitchen, wiping her hands on a towel. "Harrison, darling, why on earth did you buy another refrigerator?"

"For storage," he answered vaguely.

"But we have three refrigerators already," Beatrice protested, then noticed the stack of insulated delivery boxes. "What in the world—?"

Harrison gestured to the dozens of Häagen-Dazs cartons being unloaded. "Ice cream storage."

Beatrice's perfectly sculpted eyebrows shot up. "Since when do you eat ice cream? And this much of it?"

Harrison's expression remained impassive as he adjusted his cufflinks. "I discovered it today. Would you like to try some, Mother?"

Beatrice waved a dismissive hand. "Oh, I never touch—" Her protest died when Harrison opened a gold-rimmed container of salted caramel truffle.

One taste later, Beatrice's eyes widened. "Good heavens, that's divine. Give me another—"

Harrison swiftly moved the entire stash out of reach. "If you want more, have Father buy it for you."

Beatrice gaped at her usually reserved son. "It's just ice cream!"

But Harrison was already carefully arranging each container in the new fridge, his normally stoic face showing rare contentment as he surveyed his frozen treasure trove.

That weekend, Harrison invited the Kingsley brothers over for poker.

Julian groaned as soon as he arrived. "Harrison, I'm drowning in midterms. I shouldn't even be taking time off to—"

Harrison wasn't listening. His gaze kept darting toward the doorway behind them.

Elliot followed his line of sight and smirked. "Looking for someone, Harrison?"

Harrison's jaw tightened. "Where's Evelyn tonight?"

Elliot exchanged an amused glance with Julian. "So we're only welcome if Evelyn comes too?"
###Chapter 484 Mathematical Olympiad Class

Harrison glanced up, locking eyes with Elliot without hesitation.

"Didn't Evelyn mention she was supposed to compete with both of you?"

Elliot adjusted his glasses. "Her grades slipped recently, so Grandfather arranged private tutoring. That's why she can't participate now."

"What kind of tutoring exactly?"

"Advanced mathematics competition prep."

Harrison remained silent.

...

The following morning, Evelyn dragged herself to her math olympiad session. "This is impossible. Can I just take notes instead?"

She blinked when she saw Harrison already seated at her usual desk. Rubbing her eyes, she approached in disbelief. "Harrison? What are you doing here?"

Without looking up from his notebook, he replied, "Mother enrolled me after hearing about the extra credits for competition winners."

Evelyn couldn't suppress a giggle. "I thought I was the only victim here! Aunt Beatrice got you too?"

"Seems we're suffering together."

"But these problems are ridiculously difficult!"

Evelyn wanted to cry. When would this torture end?

Harrison gave a resigned smile and took her textbook. "These problems are actually quite simple. Want me to show you?"

He pointed at her half-finished solution. "Your approach here is incorrect. If you look at the question structure..."

Where her teacher's explanations had left her confused, Harrison's clear breakdown made everything click. "Harrison, I understood immediately when you explained! Why does it make no sense when the teacher says it?"

"You're much better at teaching than our instructor! Will you help me with the problems I can't solve?"

Evelyn gazed at him with hopeful kitten eyes.

"Fine."

That single word made Evelyn's heart leap. Suddenly, math olympiad didn't seem so terrible anymore.

In fact, she began feeling the slightest spark of interest.

...

For half a semester, Harrison attended every session with Evelyn. When competition results were announced, Evelyn held a gold medal for her grade level.

Staring at the gleaming award in her hands, everything felt surreal.

"Harrison, this is all because of you! I could kiss you right now! Can you imagine Grandfather's face when he sees this..."

Harrison watched Evelyn's lips move, but only one phrase registered. Even if said casually, those words made his pulse quicken.

...

By second semester of junior high, Evelyn had grown accustomed to their study sessions.

One afternoon after PE, sharp pains began radiating through her abdomen. At first, she dismissed it as cramps.

But the pain intensified until her face drained of color. Her legs gave out as classmates finally noticed her distress.

"Evelyn? Are you okay?"

"Evelyn, what's wrong?"

"Someone help!"

"Quick, take her to the nurse!"

Harrison was leaving class when a panicked girl grabbed his arm. "You're Evelyn's brother, right? Something's wrong - you need to come now!"

His heart lurched before she finished speaking. "Where is she?"

"The infirmary."

Harrison took off at a sprint, his dress shoes pounding against the linoleum.

"Evelyn? What happened? Talk to me!"
###Chapter 485 Great to Have Harrison

Evelyn's eyes fluttered open, still groggy from sleep. The moment she saw Harrison standing by her bedside, hot tears spilled down her cheeks.

"Harrison! Am I dying?"

Harrison immediately rushed to her side, wrapping a protective arm around her trembling shoulders. His voice was firm yet gentle as he reassured her.

"Don't be ridiculous. You're perfectly healthy."

"But I bled so much... My clothes, the sheets... everything's stained..."

Harrison froze as if struck by lightning. A deep flush crept up his neck to the tips of his ears.

"What... what did you say?" he stammered in an unusually quiet voice.

Evelyn's sobs intensified. "Harrison, what's happening to me? I don't want to die!"

He gently placed a finger over her lips. "You're not dying, silly. Just stay here and wait for me."

The tears stopped instantly as Evelyn blinked up at him with watery eyes. "Where are you going?"

Without explanation, Harrison simply repeated, "Be a good girl and wait right here."

Confusion clouded Evelyn's features just as the school nurse hurried in. "I heard about your fainting spell. What happened?"

"Nurse, am I dying?"

The nurse's eyebrows shot up. "What makes you say that?"

Evelyn recounted everything between hiccuping sobs.

After listening carefully, the nurse exhaled in relief and offered a warm smile. "This is completely normal, dear. It's just your body's way of telling you you're becoming a young woman..."

Understanding dawned on Evelyn, and her face burned with sudden embarrassment.

At that moment, Harrison returned, slightly out of breath with perspiration dotting his forehead. He thrust a discreet paper bag into her hands.

"Go change in the restroom. Now."

Evelyn's ears turned scarlet. "Where... where did you even get these?"

"Less talking, more moving," he said, gently pushing her toward the door.

Face still flaming, Evelyn hurried to the restroom. When she returned, she shuffled awkwardly, unable to meet his gaze.

Harrison, however, acted completely normal, handing her a steaming cup. "Drink this. Hot chocolate helps with... discomfort."

Evelyn peeked at him through her lashes. "How do you know all this?"

Instead of answering, Harrison rattled off instructions. "Rest more, drink warm fluids, no strenuous activities."

Despite his bossy tone, warmth blossomed in Evelyn's chest. "Harrison... I'm so lucky to have you."

The moment was interrupted as Elliot and Julian burst in, having rushed over upon hearing about Evelyn's collapse. "Evie! What happened? Are you hurt?"

"Tell us everything! Are you feeling sick now?"

"Didn't you just have a physical? What's wrong?"

Evelyn bit her lip, mortified.

Seeing their frantic expressions, she mumbled incoherently. "I... um..."

Harrison smoothly intercepted them. "She's fine. Just needed some rest."

Elliot narrowed his eyes. "People don't faint for no reason. I'm calling our private physician for a full examination."
###Chapter 486 That Time of the Month

Elliot was reaching for his phone to call their private physician when Harrison swiftly intercepted it.

"Every woman goes through this monthly cycle," Harrison explained with an amused smirk. "Let's not make a big deal out of it."

Elliot blinked. They had studied human biology extensively in school.

It took him a second before realization dawned—Harrison was referring to that time of the month.

He exhaled sharply. "You nearly gave me a heart attack! I thought something was seriously wrong!" He turned to Evelyn with a stern look. "You need to take better care of yourself, got it? No more scaring us like this!"

Julian cleared his throat, breaking the awkward tension. "As long as Evelyn's fine, that's all that matters."

Then, with a teasing glint in his eyes, he added, "But—" He gave her a pointed once-over. "You're still out of shape. You need more training."

"I know."

Julian smirked. "And who gave you the confidence to sign up for the 800-meter race on Sports Day? You barely exercise as it is. You're not going to collapse halfway, are you?"

Evelyn's competitive spirit flared instantly.

"Julian, what's that supposed to mean? Who says I can't finish? Not only will I complete it, I'll win a medal just to prove you wrong!"

"Oh really?" Julian folded his arms. "I'll believe it when I see it. But fine—if you actually finish, I'll buy all your snacks for the rest of the semester."

Evelyn's eyes gleamed. "Deal. And you better not back out."

Julian's grin widened. "Oh, I won't. But—" His tone turned sly. "If you don't finish, you owe me a top-tier gaming setup. Highest specs available."

Evelyn clenched her fists. "Fine! It's a bet!"

Elliot immediately pulled Julian aside, hissing under his breath, "Cut it out! You know Evelyn hates exercising. She's only doing this for fun!"

Julian shrugged. "Exactly why I'm pushing her. She needs to get in shape. Don't worry—I won't let her lose too badly."

Elliot sighed. "You'd better not."

Julian turned back to Evelyn with a smirk. "Relax, Elliot. Even if she loses, the gaming set won't bankrupt her. Just one month's allowance, tops."

Evelyn stomped her foot. "I won't lose!"

Julian chuckled. "We'll see."

Once her cycle ended, Evelyn immediately hired a personal trainer.

With only a week left until Sports Day, time was tight—but the intense sessions noticeably improved her stamina.

On Sports Day, Elliot, Julian, and Harrison sat in the bleachers. Elliot shook his head in disbelief.

"I've never seen Evelyn train this hard in her life."

Julian smirked. "A week won't make her an athlete, though. If she loses, go easy on her, alright?"

"Don't worry. I'll pick a moderately priced gaming set. Promise."

"You'd better."

Julian didn't respond.

Just then, Harrison stood abruptly. Elliot frowned. "Where are you going?"

Harrison didn't look back as he walked away. "Something I need to handle."
###Chapter 487 Running 800 Meters With Her

The starting gun echoed across the field.

Evelyn found herself among the top three runners immediately as the 800-meter race began.

By the second lap, her stamina started waning. Her pace slowed considerably.

Just then, Harrison appeared unexpectedly, jogging alongside her outside the track lane.

"Evie, match your breathing to your steps," he coached. "Three steps inhale, three steps exhale."

His steady voice anchored her. She adjusted her rhythm accordingly, gradually picking up speed.

In the final stretch, Evelyn crossed the finish line in third place.

"I did it!" she gasped, doubling over. "Need... to... sit..."

Her knees buckled as she moved to collapse on the track.

Harrison's firm grip caught her arm. "No sitting yet. Walk it off first."

"Can't... breathe..."

"Slow steps. Follow my pace."

Supporting her elbow, Harrison matched his stride to her labored breathing. Julian and Elliot rushed over, concern written on their faces.

"Evie! You okay?"

Seeing Julian revived her instantly. "Third place! Remember our bet?"

Julian grinned. "Impressive! Name your snacks - this year's on me."

"Deal! And I'm craving everything!" Her exhaustion momentarily forgotten.

"Whatever you want."

Evelyn turned to Harrison. "You're included too. I wouldn't have finished without you."

"Feeling better now?" His gaze searched her face.

"Much!"

"Good."

Later that year, Harrison, Julian and Elliot aced their exams and entered high school.

Evelyn progressed to eighth grade, where physics became her personal nemesis.

"Elliot, this is torture," she groaned, slamming her textbook shut. "Why does physics exist?"

"You could choose humanities later," he offered. "No physics required."

Her face brightened momentarily before falling again. "Two more years of this though!"

Elliot shrugged helplessly, then spotted Harrison approaching. "Ask him. Physics genius."

Evelyn clasped her hands dramatically. "Harrison! Save me from this nightmare!"

"From what?"

"Physics," Elliot explained. "If you tutor her till high school, she can ditch it for good."

Evelyn sighed dramatically. "Who invented this torture device called physics?"

Harrison simply stared, speechless.
###Chapter 488 The Science Lab Experiment

The weekend sun cast golden rays through the trees as Harrison pedaled his bicycle toward the Kingsley estate. Spotting Leonard in the garden, he called out cheerfully. "Mr. Kingsley!"

Leonard's face lit up at the sight of the young man. "Harrison! Looking for Julian and Elliot? They left for a recording session this morning."

"That's alright, Mr. Kingsley." Harrison grinned. "I actually came to see Evelyn."

A knowing smile spread across Leonard's face. "Ah, I should have guessed! Let me have the housekeeper fetch her."

Before Leonard could summon help, rapid footsteps echoed from the staircase.

Evelyn burst into the foyer, her eyes sparkling. "Harrison! You're here!"

Harrison nodded toward Leonard. "We'll be heading out now, sir."

"Have fun, you two!" Leonard waved them off.

The moment they stepped outside, Evelyn's curiosity overflowed. "Where are we going? Why all the secrecy?"

Harrison simply winked. "Patience. You'll see soon enough."

Mounting his bicycle, he gestured to the back. "Hop on!"

Without hesitation, Evelyn settled behind him, her hands lightly gripping his shoulders as they set off through the tree-lined streets.

When they arrived at their destination, Evelyn blinked in confusion. "A science lab? Harrison, what—"

"Come see!" He grabbed her hand, pulling her toward the entrance.

Inside, the room buzzed with scientific equipment - beakers, microscopes, and devices Evelyn couldn't name. Her eyes widened at the strange apparatus.

"What's this?" She pointed to a peculiar glass object.

"Concave lens setup," Harrison explained.

"And this?" She touched a box with dials.

"Variable resistor, with a voltmeter and ammeter beside it."

Evelyn moved through the lab like a child in a candy store, touching everything with wonder. Harrison patiently answered each question until they reached a workstation.

"Want to try an experiment?" he offered.

"Me?" Evelyn hesitated.

"Trust me, you'll love it."

With gentle encouragement, Harrison guided her through constructing a pinhole camera. When the image projected upside down, Evelyn gasped.

"That's incredible! Why does it flip like that?"

Harrison launched into an animated explanation about light refraction and rectilinear propagation. Evelyn listened, fascinated.

"This is amazing!" She tugged his sleeve. "Let's try another one!"

Delighted by her enthusiasm, Harrison walked her through every experiment in the curriculum. Hours slipped by unnoticed until Harrison checked his watch.

"Evelyn, it's getting late. We should head back."

"Not yet!" She gestured to their current experiment. "We have to see the results!"
###Chapter 489 Pursuing Your Passion

Evelyn had always been headstrong when she set her sights on something. Once physics experiments captured her imagination, she threw herself into every lesson with newfound enthusiasm.

Her physics grades remained impeccable throughout junior high at the prestigious private academy. The institution offered an impressive curriculum that went beyond traditional academics, including specialized vocational courses.

When high school began, Evelyn started taking advanced classes in her chosen field. By freshman year, she was already enrolled in business management courses.

While most teenagers rebelled during adolescence, Evelyn's defiance came earlier than most.

"Grandfather, I have no interest in business management. Corporate affairs will never appeal to me." Evelyn gazed pleadingly at Leonard. "We already have Dominic handling everything!"

Though Leonard typically indulged his granddaughter, he remained firm on this matter. "That's not negotiable."

"But why?" Evelyn pressed.

"Attend your business management classes diligently. Consult Dominic if you encounter difficulties."

"No, Grandfather! My heart isn't in it."

"Then enlighten me - what does capture your interest?"

Evelyn fell silent, unable to articulate her desires. Yet the conviction remained. "Regardless, business management isn't for me. When I discover my true calling, I'll pursue it wholeheartedly."

Her determination softened Leonard slightly. "Very well. Until you find your passion, continue with the EMBA program."

Though reluctant, Evelyn complied with her grandfather's wishes and began the business management curriculum.

Later that year, Elliot and Julian became seniors. Family obligations meant they bypassed standard college entrance exams, with direct university admission already arranged.

While classmates stressed over SAT preparations, the brothers relaxed at home with video games.

One afternoon, Evelyn burst in with sudden inspiration. "Elliot! Julian! What if I studied fashion design?"

The brothers exchanged puzzled glances. "Design? You're serious?"

Evelyn eagerly produced her tablet, displaying images from the latest Milan Fashion Week. "Look at these groundbreaking designs - so innovative and daring!"

"This particular designer has shown at Milan for consecutive years. Industry insiders call her the design queen - imagine that level of recognition!"

"If my creations could grace Milan's runways someday, wouldn't that be incredible?"

Elliot interrupted gently. "Evie, this isn't a casual decision. Have you discussed this with Grandfather?"

"Design requires extensive artistic training. Starting now would put you at a disadvantage against seasoned professionals."

"The gap between amateur and professional is significant. If you're serious, consult Grandfather and Dominic first."

###Chapter 490 No Passion for the Business

Evelyn completely disregarded Elliot's and Julian's concerns.

She stood her ground. "Absolutely not. Once I've made up my mind to pursue this, I'll give it my all. I won't disappoint you."

"This isn't about disappointing us! Kingsley Industries will eventually be yours to inherit. If you go chasing after fashion design dreams, what happens to our family legacy?"

Evelyn shook her head. "Elliot, we still have Dominic, remember? As long as he's around, the Kingsley legacy is secure."

"Besides, I have zero interest in corporate life. Why don't you two consider taking over?"

Elliot and Julian exchanged glances before shaking their heads in unison.

"Not happening. The business world isn't for me."

Julian added, "Same here. Music is my calling. I'd much rather become a singer and make it big in the entertainment industry."

Evelyn threw up her hands in exasperation.

"See? Everyone should follow their passions!"

The brothers had no rebuttal. How could they force Evelyn into something they themselves refused to do?

"I'll pretend I never heard about this."

"Same here. You've always been independent, Evie. This is your decision to make."

Their responses satisfied Evelyn. "Good. Then let's keep this between us for now - no telling Grandpa or Dominic."

The brothers fell silent, exchanging meaningful looks before sighing deeply.

Though they kept their sister's secret from the family, they couldn't resist confiding in their closest friend.

"Harrison, we can't figure out what's gotten into Evelyn. She's suddenly obsessed with fashion design - even signed up for art classes to 'build her foundation.'"

Harrison's eyebrows lifted slightly. "She's serious about this?"

Elliot clapped him on the shoulder with a heavy nod. "When that girl sets her mind to something, nothing stops her."

"Right now her enthusiasm is at its peak. She's more passionate about this than those physics experiments you used to drag her to."

Harrison murmured, "That's good. Pursuing one's passion is never wrong."

"But Harrison! She's taking these classes secretly without telling the rest of the family!"

"And how does your family feel about this?"

"What do you think? Grandpa's always seen Evelyn as his second heir, expecting her to help Dominic run the company someday!"

"Couldn't you two handle it instead?"

The brothers shook their heads simultaneously. "Not interested."

Elliot clearly only cared about his coding projects, nothing else.

As for Julian, though he bore the Kingsley name, he knew he wasn't a blood relative. Everything the family had given him was generosity he couldn't repay.

How could he possibly ask for more?

Harrison simply said, "Then practice what you preach."

The brothers fell silent. Elliot clicked his tongue. "Harrison, whose side are you on? That's blatant favoritism!"

Julian looked confused. "What do you mean, Elliot?"

Elliot shrugged, indicating some things were better left unsaid.

Then he teased, "Julian, you're almost an adult. Time to learn about these things from Harrison here. Otherwise you'll die alone without ever finding a wife."

"I'm hosting a gathering tonight. Want to come?"

Evelyn nearly refused, but Adrian's puppy-dog eyes changed her mind. "Please, my lady! If you don't show, my father will never let me live it down."

Evelyn burst out laughing. Even bold Adrian had someone who intimidated him. Intrigued, she agreed. "Fine."

Adrian beamed. "Perfect! See you tonight."

That evening, Evelyn dressed simply and headed out. Adrian's gathering was at an upscale lounge.

When she arrived, Adrian was already waiting outside. Spotting her, he waved eagerly. "Over here, my lady!"

They entered together.

The private room was filled with Adrian's childhood friends - both men and women. They greeted Evelyn enthusiastically.

"Ms. Kingsley! What's your game of choice? Cards? Bridge? Dice?"

Evelyn wasn't picky. "Anything's fine."

They settled on cards. Though inexperienced, Evelyn had beginner's luck and doubled her chips in the first round.

Feeling uncomfortable with the attention, she excused herself to the restroom, asking Adrian to play for her.

Leaving the private room, she wandered down the hallway toward the rooftop for fresh air. But as she reached the top, a scream pierced through the music.

"Stop! Please!"

"I was wrong!"

"Don't hit me again!"

Though muffled by the music, the terrified cries were unmistakable. Evelyn followed the sound.

A man's voice growled, "Trying to run away, were you?"

The sickening crack of a whip followed, then another. Through a door crack, Evelyn saw seven or eight bound women, their eyes wide with terror.

The screaming woman's body was a mass of bloody welts.

"Listen well! You'll earn me money or die trying! Anyone else thinking of escaping will end up just like her!"

The other women trembled in silent horror.

As the man turned toward the door, Evelyn instinctively backed up, bumping into the doorframe.

"Who's there?" the man barked.

Evelyn spun to flee, but three hulking men materialized behind her, blocking her escape.

###Chapter 491 The Fire Within

"What nonsense are you spouting? How does this relate to my future marriage prospects? Julian, make yourself clear!" Harrison demanded, his brows furrowing in confusion.

"Figure it out yourself, brother!"

"No, you're explaining this to me right now."

Ignoring Elliot's teasing smirk, Harrison strode purposefully toward the art studio alone.

Through the window, he spotted Evelyn. She sat completely absorbed in her still-life drawing, pencil moving across the paper with deliberate strokes. Though her technique lacked polish, her concentration was absolute.

Harrison had never witnessed this side of her before.

He remained motionless, observing silently as Evelyn continued working long after class had ended, determined to finish her assignment.

Finally, Evelyn stretched her aching arm, a satisfied smile lighting up her face. "Finally finished," she murmured to herself.

The moment the words left her lips, Harrison pushed open the door. "All done?"

Evelyn turned, revealing smudges of charcoal across her cheek that she remained blissfully unaware of.

Her face brightened when she saw him. "Harrison! What brings you here?"

He approached with amusement dancing in his eyes. "Evelyn, perhaps you'd like to check your reflection before we continue?"

"What? Why?"

She rushed to the mirror and gasped. "When did this happen? Harrison, wait here - I'll be right back!"

Evelyn dashed to the restroom. When she returned, Harrison offered his handkerchief.

"Your hands."

"Thanks!"

After drying her hands, she asked, "Weren't you supposed to be in meetings all afternoon? What changed?"

"Nothing important. I just wanted to see you. Elliot mentioned you're considering fashion design."

Evelyn nodded without hesitation.

"I think it's perfect. I could open my own boutique someday, launch a clothing line, maybe even show at Fashion Week..."

As she spoke, her eyes sparkled with such intensity they seemed to catch fire. The afternoon sunlight streaming through the windows illuminated her like a spotlight.

"I've even imagined where I'll live - a beautiful house with an enormous koi pond in the backyard."

She continued dreamily, "A sprawling garden full of my favorite flowers would be ideal. And a porch swing where I could spend afternoons reading, watching dramas... in spring, summer, autumn, winter..."

"Sharing every season, every meal with someone special."

Harrison listened intently, committing each word to memory as she painted her future with words.

His gaze softened as he asked, "Is this truly what you want?"

Evelyn turned to him with conviction. "Absolutely! It sounds simple, but getting there won't be easy."

"Don't worry." Harrison's voice held quiet certainty. "It will happen."
###Chapter 492 Heartbreaking Revelation

Harrison wasn't certain if he spoke those words for Evelyn's benefit or his own reassurance. But one thing was clear - he would move mountains to fulfill her every desire.

"You really believe that? Let's pray your words hold truth."

"They will. Come, let's grab dinner at the bistro together."

"Perfect. I'm craving meatball subs, smoked ribs, and that creamy mushroom bisque..."

Later that evening, Evelyn returned to the Kingsley estate. As she ascended the grand staircase, a muffled sob from the study froze her in her tracks.

Curiosity prickling her skin, she tiptoed toward the oak-paneled door and gently eased it open just enough to peer inside.

Leonard Kingsley sat slumped in his leather armchair, the picture of devastation.

The family butler hovered nearby, murmuring, "Sir, you must preserve your health."

Leonard buried his face in trembling hands, shoulders shaking with silent tears.

"Master Dominic is young and strong," the butler continued. "He'll pull through this, I'm certain of it."

Leonard's voice cracked. "Of all my grandchildren, he's always been the brightest star. My firstborn heir, the pride of our family."

"I've spent years preparing him to take my place. Who could imagine such illness would strike him down in his prime?"

"Sir, divine providence will see him through. We've mobilized our global networks to find a compatible heart donor. Once secured, Master Dominic can undergo transplant surgery immediately. The prognosis is favorable."

Evelyn's knees nearly buckled at these words.

Before she could stop herself, she burst through the door, voice trembling. "Grandfather! What's this about Dominic needing a heart transplant?"

Leonard startled at her sudden appearance, hastily composing himself. "Evelyn, darling, when did you return?"

Her hands clenched into fists. "Don't evade me. Tell me truthfully - what's wrong with my brother?"

"And this talk of donor matches? How long has Dominic been ill? Why was I kept in the dark?"

The study fell deathly quiet save for the butler's heavy sigh.

"Grandfather, must you still hide the truth from me?"

Leonard turned toward the moonlit window before speaking. "Evelyn... Dominic was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy a year ago. His condition has deteriorated rapidly. He's in end-stage heart failure and requires immediate transplantation."

The words struck Evelyn like a physical blow, her vision swimming with shock.

"That... that can't be possible!"

"Miss Evelyn," the butler interjected gently, "Only yourself and Master Leonard know. Your other brothers remain unaware. The family intended to inform everyone after Dominic's successful recovery."

"Where is he now?"

"At Massachusetts General."

Evelyn arrived at the hospital to find Dominic lying unnaturally still in the ICU bed.

A kaleidoscope of emotions churned within her. Suddenly, Leonard's insistence on her taking over Kingsley Industries made terrible sense.

She was now the family's last remaining hope.

Pressing her palm against the cold glass partition, she whispered, "Dominic, you have to fight this."

Clasping her hands as if in prayer, she made a silent vow.

Later, Leonard found her staring blankly at the hospital courtyard. "Evelyn... are you absolutely certain about this path?"
###Chapter 493 Graduation Gift

Harrison's eyebrows lifted slightly in surprise.

Evelyn, however, remained composed as she gazed into the distance. "Yes, I've made my decision."

"But fashion design is your passion. Are you really walking away from it?"

"Harrison, I'm not abandoning my dreams. I'm simply rearranging my priorities. Besides," she turned to face him with a determined smile, "I've already planned everything out."

"Once I start university, I'll major in business administration while taking fashion design electives."

Harrison nodded slowly. "If this is what you want, you have my full support."

"You're amazing, Harrison." Evelyn's eyes shone with gratitude.

"Have you chosen which university to attend?"

"For my bachelor's, probably Frenda. But for my master's..." Her voice grew wistful. "Coronia University has the best design program. I'd give anything to study there."

"I have no doubt you'll make it happen."

Dominic's condition had been critical, but the Kingsley family's extensive connections secured him a matching donor heart in record time.

The surgery went smoothly, followed by years of intensive rehabilitation.

Now, after what felt like an eternity, Dominic had finally regained his health.

On the day of Evelyn's undergraduate graduation ceremony, Dominic personally handed her an acceptance letter from Coronia University.

"Evelyn, I know you never stopped dreaming these past few years." His voice was thick with emotion. "Now that I'm well again, it's time for you to chase those dreams."

Tears welled in Evelyn's eyes as she clutched the precious envelope. She threw her arms around her brother. "Thank you, Dominic."

Just then, Elliot, Julian, and Harrison approached.

Over the years, Julian had signed with a major record label and successfully debuted as a singer.

Elliot, with his extraordinary hacking skills, had been recruited by the National Cybersecurity Agency.

As for Harrison, he'd taken the reins at Whitmore Enterprises, becoming its youngest CEO.

"Congratulations, Evelyn!" Elliot was the first to speak, presenting an elegantly wrapped box. "Your graduation gift. Open it."

Evelyn took the package curiously. "What is it, Elliot?"

"You'll see." He grinned mysteriously.

Inside lay the keys to a sleek Porsche. "Do you like it?"

Evelyn's face fell instantly. "Elliot! You know I failed my driving test twice! What am I supposed to do with this?"

Clearing his throat awkwardly, Elliot tried to recover. "Consider it motivation. You'll pass next time."

Julian couldn't suppress his laughter. "Since Dominic and Elliot brought gifts, I can't be left out." He handed her another set of keys.

"It's a penthouse across from Coronia University. Fully furnished and ready for you to move in."

Evelyn beamed. "Julian, you're the best!"

Elliot immediately protested. "My car cost over four hundred thousand! That's twice what Julian's tiny apartment is worth. Clearly, I'm the better brother here."

"Your gift lacks thoughtfulness," Julian countered smoothly. "Mine shows I actually considered what Evelyn needs."

The brothers continued bickering as Evelyn clutched her gifts, overwhelmed by their love and support.
###Chapter 494 Heart of the Ocean

Evelyn sighed deeply as she watched Elliot and Julian arguing like children. She stepped between them and wrapped an arm around each brother's shoulders.

"Alright, you two. I know you're both amazing. In my heart, you're equally important to me."

"Damn right," Elliot muttered.

"Wait," Julian suddenly turned to Harrison. "What about your gift for Evelyn?"

Evelyn's eyes lit up with curiosity as she looked at Harrison. "You got me something too?"

Harrison remained silent, but Elliot jumped in excitedly. "Oh, you have no idea! Harrison's been working on this for six months!"

Julian caught on immediately. After years of friendship, he'd long recognized Harrison's feelings for Evelyn.

"Actually," Julian cleared his throat, "I just remembered we have that... thing. We should go."

"Yeah, that thing," Elliot agreed quickly. The brothers practically dragged Dominic away, leaving Evelyn alone with Harrison.

Evelyn blinked in confusion. "What's gotten into them today?"

"Don't worry about them."

Harrison reached into his jacket pocket, hesitating for just a moment before producing a small velvet box.

"Happy graduation, Evelyn."

Her face broke into a radiant smile. "Harrison! You really did get me something!"

With eager fingers, she opened the box. Inside lay a breathtaking blue gemstone necklace that shimmered like captured moonlight.

"Oh my God!" Evelyn gasped. "This is stunning!"

A small smile played on Harrison's lips. "Do you like it?"

"I love it! It's perfect!"

"It's called the Heart of the Ocean. I acquired it at auction specifically for you. May it bring you good fortune."

"Thank you," she whispered.

"Would you like me to help you put it on?"

"Please."

His fingers brushed against her neck as he fastened the clasp. The cool metal settled against her skin.

"It suits you."

"Harrison..." Evelyn hesitated. "Is there something you want to tell me?"

He looked into her eyes - those familiar eyes that had haunted his dreams for years. The words burned on his tongue, but fear held them back.

Instead, he said, "Study hard at Coronia. Graduate quickly and chase your dreams."

Evelyn beamed. "I will."

Three months later, Evelyn boarded a plane to Coronia. Meanwhile, Harrison successfully closed Fulton Group's first billion-dollar deal, propelling the company to unprecedented heights.

Their reunion came at year's end when Harrison traveled to Eligo for business and made a detour to Coronia University.

The taxi dropped him at the campus gates. Standing before the ivy-covered buildings, Harrison felt his restless heart finally calm.

With trembling fingers, he dialed Evelyn's number. "Guess where I am?" he teased, trying to mask his nerves.

At the sound of his voice, Evelyn nearly dropped her books. "Harrison...?" Her voice cracked with emotion.
###Chapter 495 The One Who Stood Up

Harrison's stomach dropped at the tremor in Evelyn's voice. His grip tightened around his phone. "Evelyn? What's going on? Are you hurt?"

He abandoned his suitcase right there on the sidewalk, breaking into a jog toward campus.

The sprawling university grounds stretched before him, endless pathways branching in every direction. He forced himself to stop, breathing hard. "Evelyn, tell me where you are."

"My dorm room."

"Stay put. I'm coming to you."

Evelyn sounded confused. "Harrison, what do you mean?"

His dress shoes pounded against the pavement as he ran, the initial excitement of his surprise visit now replaced with gnawing concern.

"Look out your window."

The curtains in Evelyn's dorm had been drawn for days. When she yanked them open, sunlight flooded the space so brightly it made her wince.

Her reflection in the window showed dark circles under her eyes, her usually vibrant complexion dulled.

Then she saw him - Harrison standing by the flower beds, waving up at her with that familiar lopsided grin.

"Harrison!" The name burst from her lips. "Wait right there!"

She threw on the first jacket she could find, not bothering with proper shoes before racing downstairs. When she crashed into his arms, the scent of his cologne wrapped around her like a security blanket.

"You're really here," she breathed, pulling back to study his face. "Why didn't you tell me you were coming?"

Harrison didn't answer immediately. His sharp gaze traced every detail of her face - the hollows under her cheekbones, the way her smile didn't quite reach her eyes.

Worse still were the faint red rims around her eyelids, the telltale signs of recent tears.

He pulled her close again, murmuring against her hair, "Who made you cry?"

The question unleashed everything. Evelyn thought of those endless hours waiting at the café, watching the door until her coffee went cold.

Her bottom lip quivered. "Someone stood me up, Harrison."

"What?"

Evelyn stared at her slippers, suddenly embarrassed. But Harrison had always been her safe space, the brother she never had. The words tumbled out before she could stop them - every detail about the mysterious man who'd captivated her then vanished.

As she spoke, Harrison's jaw tightened. The way her voice softened when describing him, the unconscious way she played with her necklace when recalling their conversations - it all stung more than he cared to admit.

Some stranger had swooped in and claimed her attention so completely that Harrison now felt like an outsider in her life.

When she finished, Evelyn looked up with hopeful eyes. "From a man's perspective - why would someone do that? Set a time and place, then just... disappear?"

Harrison opened his mouth, then closed it. His throat felt lined with sand.

"Maybe something came up?" he offered weakly.

Evelyn shook her head. "Even emergencies warrant a text. But it's like he evaporated into thin air." She wrapped her arms around herself. "The worst part? I don't even know his full name to go looking for him."
###Chapter 496 Hidden in Memories

Harrison's fingers tightened around Evelyn's wrist as she rambled on. The sudden contact made her blink in surprise.

"What's wrong?" she asked, tilting her head.

He studied her face, emotions warring behind his composed expression. Finally, he murmured, "Perhaps the color was contaminated."

Evelyn's eyes lit up instantly. "You think so too? I knew it! He wouldn't have stood me up intentionally. But where could he have gone? He'll definitely come find me once he finishes whatever kept him away."

Harrison gave a noncommittal hum and turned his gaze toward the horizon. The sunset painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, mirroring the turmoil in his chest.

"You know," he said lightly, "I flew all this way to see you, and all you talk about is another man. That's rather cruel, don't you think?"

Evelyn flushed. She looped her arm through his with practiced ease. "I'm sorry, Harrison. I didn't expect you to visit. I'm truly happy you're here."

She gestured toward the campus gates. "There's this amazing taco stand near the library, and the botanical gardens are stunning this time of year. You should stay a few days. I'll show you all my favorite spots."

The way her eyes sparkled when she spoke made Harrison's chest tighten. As her familiar vanilla scent enveloped him, the restless feeling that had plagued him for months finally settled.

—

On New Year's Eve, they watched fireworks explode over the city skyline.

Throughout Evelyn's graduate studies, Harrison became a regular on flights between Frenda and Coronia. His passport accumulated over a hundred stamps during those years.

The exhausting commute was worth it. For the first time, Harrison felt purpose guiding his steps.

And the mysterious man Evelyn kept mentioning never reappeared—a fact that filled Harrison with quiet hope.

Time passed in a blur of research papers and weekend visits. Before they knew it, graduation day arrived. Harrison had waited years for this moment.

"Don't overthink it," Elliot advised, adjusting Harrison's tie for the third time. "Just be yourself."

Julian smirked from his perch on the armchair. "Relax. When Evelyn sees what you've planned, she'll be sobbing before you even get down on one knee."

As Harrison's closest friends, they'd witnessed every step of this slow-burning romance. In their eyes, no one deserved Evelyn more.

"Welcome to the family," Elliot said, clapping Harrison's shoulder. "But fair warning—if you ever hurt her, you'll have three very angry Kingsleys to answer to."

Harrison met their gazes steadily. "I'd rather die than see her unhappy. Every breath I take is for her."

Julian pretended to gag. "Save the dramatic declarations for Evelyn. Grandpa and the others will be here soon—we need to finish setting up."

Elliot checked his watch. "Her ceremony ends at four. If you want to surprise her, you should leave now."

"Go," Julian urged, shoving Harrison toward the door. "We've got this covered."

Harrison nodded. "See you tonight."

The brothers watched him leave, exchanging knowing smiles. After all these years, their little sister was finally coming home.
###Chapter 497 Echoes of Yesterday

Harrison slid into the driver's seat, turning the ignition with trembling fingers. The engine roared to life as he sped toward the airport terminal.

But Evelyn never showed.

...

The memory dissolved as Harrison blinked back to the present. His gaze fell upon Evelyn's sleeping form beside him. A quiet joy filled his chest. After all the storms they'd weathered, she was finally home.

He bent down, pressing his lips gently to her forehead. "Sweet dreams, Evie."

The door clicked shut behind him. In the darkness, Evelyn's eyes fluttered open.

The ghost of his kiss still lingered on her skin.

Staring at the ceiling, fragments of forgotten memories surfaced like bubbles in champagne. Pieces of their shared past rearranged themselves in her mind.

...

Morning light streamed through the curtains, painting golden stripes across the bed.

Evelyn remained tangled in the sheets, having tossed through the night before finally succumbing to exhaustion near dawn.

A soft knock interrupted the silence. "Evie? You awake?"

Harrison's voice jolted her from drowsiness. She bolted upright, momentarily disoriented before recognizing his penthouse.

"Oh! Yes, Harrison, I'm up."

Scrambling from bed, she rushed to the ensuite bathroom. Emerging refreshed, she faced an unexpected problem.

No change of clothes.

Evelyn groaned, pressing palms to her temples. That impulsive decision to stay after last night's cocktails now seemed terribly shortsighted.

Just as panic set in, Harrison's voice carried through the door. "My assistant dropped off some outfits. They're outside. I'll be downstairs when you're ready."

Relief washed over her. "Thanks," she called back, marveling at his thoughtfulness.

Peeking out, she found several luxury shopping bags lined up like soldiers. Inside, every garment fit perfectly.

Selecting a tailored navy dress, she changed quickly. Descending the staircase, she found Harrison plating breakfast.

His eyes lit up when he saw her. "That color brings out your eyes."

Evelyn's cheeks warmed inexplicably. "Oh...thanks. You've got good taste."

Harrison simply smiled, changing subjects. "Busy day ahead?"

"The usual chaos. After losing the Eastwood deal, the board's been insufferable. You saw how they treated me yesterday." She sighed. "At least the Byte collaboration shows promise."

Harrison set a steaming omelet before her. "Eastwood's about to implode. Those directors will thank you for steering clear."

Evelyn froze, fork midway to her lips. "You know something."

A knowing smile played on his lips as he tapped her nose. "Trust me."

The phrase struck a chord.

He'd said those exact words years ago.

Younger Evelyn had mistaken their connection for familial affection. Until last night - the intensity in Harrison's gaze, that earth-shattering kiss - had awakened something primal.

Like flipping through an old photo album, memories came rushing back.

Particularly their parting at Coronia International, when she'd boarded the plane home after graduation.
###Chapter 498 How Did This Go Viral

"Evelyn, when you return to Frenda, there's something important I need to tell you."

Harrison's words made Evelyn freeze mid-motion, her pulse instantly accelerating.

She lifted her gaze, meeting his eyes directly.

After gathering her courage, she finally voiced the question burning inside her. "Harrison, is there something you've been meaning to say to me but haven't had the chance?"

Confusion flickered across Harrison's face.

Time seemed to stand still as their eyes locked.

Evelyn could feel her heart hammering against her ribs, threatening to escape.

Just as Harrison parted his lips to speak, an abrupt ringtone shattered the moment.

Snapping back to reality, Evelyn quickly looked away. She stared at her flashing phone screen and stammered, "I—I should take this."

She stood, clutching her phone, and hurried out of the dining room. Once she reached the hallway, she leaned against the wall, pressing a hand to her racing heart. "Evelyn, get a grip! Why are you so nervous?"

Annoyed with herself, she lightly smacked her forehead and let out a frustrated sigh.

When her phone rang again, she finally answered.

"Evelyn! What took you so long?" Sophia's voice crackled through the line.

Evelyn cleared her throat, forcing her voice to sound steady. "What's up? Is everything okay?"

"Wait—you sound way too calm. Do you seriously not know what's happening?"

Evelyn frowned. "Know what?"

"Check Byte right now. You're trending!"

Evelyn's breath hitched. "What? I'm trending?"

On the other end, Sophia glanced at the top trending hashtag and smirked. "Oh yeah."

"How is that possible?"

As she spoke, Evelyn opened her Byte account. Despite having only a handful of followers last night, she now had hundreds of thousands.

She was stunned.

The video she'd posted last night—a simple clip of her and Harrison having dinner—had somehow amassed tens of thousands of likes overnight.

Not only that, but after quietly circulating, it had climbed to the top of the trending list.

The video's popularity was skyrocketing, drawing even more viewers and creating a self-sustaining cycle of engagement.

"How did this even happen?" Evelyn muttered.

"Look at your location tag," Sophia pointed out.

Only then did Evelyn realize she'd accidentally tagged the address of Harrison's estate.

But what was so special about that?

"What's the big deal about this location?"

Sophia's laughter drifted through the phone. "Oh, sweetie, that location says everything. Just read the top comments."

Baffled, Evelyn scrolled through the comments section. The top one read: "Wow, Ms. Carter slumming it with us peasants?"

"I thought billionaires only ate gold-plated caviar. Who knew she'd be so relatable? That food looks amazing—did you cook it yourself, Ms. Carter?"

"Uh, hello? Focus on the location! That's Crestwood Manor! Even billionaires can't just buy property there."

"Ms. Carter is literally living in a different universe."

Sophia's voice cut through her thoughts. "Evelyn, your heiress persona is killing it right now."
###Chapter 499 Hiding a Man

Sophia Whitmore couldn't resist teasing, her voice laced with playful curiosity. "I'm dying to know. When exactly did you purchase that penthouse at Skycrest Heights? And since when did you become such a culinary expert?"

She leaned closer to the phone screen, eyeing the gourmet breakfast spread. "That eggs Benedict looks straight out of a Michelin-starred restaurant. You're holding out on us, aren't you?"

Evelyn Carter felt heat creeping up her neck. Her fingers tightened around her phone. "Don't be ridiculous. I just... happened to share some personal moments. Who knew people would make such a fuss?"

A skeptical laugh came through the line. "Seriously, Evie? Are we really supposed to believe there isn't some gorgeous billionaire hiding in that penthouse with you?"

The accusation was so absurd it made Evelyn's breath catch.

"Of course not!" The denial burst from her lips before she could stop it.

Her gaze flickered toward Harrison Whitmore sitting at the dining table, and suddenly her pulse was racing like a startled rabbit. She pressed a hand against her chest, as if that could calm the erratic beating.

"I've got to go," she blurted. "We'll talk later."

The call ended with a sharp tap, but Evelyn found herself frozen in the hallway, phone clutched to her chest. She pressed her forehead against the cool wall and let out a frustrated groan.

Why had she asked him that ridiculous question last night?

What if she'd completely misread the situation? The thought of facing him now made her want to disappear.

"Evie."

Harrison's deep voice startled her so badly she nearly dropped her phone. He stood mere inches away, having approached without a sound.

"Y-yes?"

One dark eyebrow arched. "Your breakfast is getting cold. Unless you plan to be late for your meeting with Victor Langley?"

His completely normal tone made the knot in her stomach unravel instantly.

"Right. Of course."

She forced calm into her voice, even as something suspiciously like disappointment curled in her chest.

———

Kingsley Industries buzzed with its usual energy, but Evelyn moved through the day like she was underwater. Three separate times, Maxwell Donovan had to repeat himself before she registered his words.

"Ms. Carter?" His concerned gaze studied her face. "The car is ready. We should leave for Barnes Group now."

Evelyn blinked, then grabbed her blazer from the back of her chair. "Yes. Let's go."

They'd just reached the gleaming lobby of Barnes Group when fate decided to throw gasoline on her already chaotic day. Juliette Blackwood stood surrounded by her entourage, holding court like the queen of Pamore.

Their eyes locked, and the air between them crackled with unspoken challenges.

Juliette's red lips curved into a predatory smile as she sauntered over. "Evelyn Carter. How quaint—arriving with just one assistant." She flicked a dismissive glance at Maxwell. "Has Kingsley Industries fallen on such hard times?"

Evelyn didn't bat an eyelash. "Different philosophies, Juliette. Some of us prefer substance over spectacle."

Juliette's laugh was like shattering crystal. "With Landon Group's recent success, I've proven my designs surpass yours in every way. What exactly do you have left to compete with me?"

A slow, knowing smile spread across Evelyn's face. "Talent doesn't need neon signs to be seen. But do be careful—the higher you climb, the more painful the fall."
###Chapter 500 Distinct Treatment

"I'm well aware many are waiting to watch me fail."

Juliette Blackwood tilted her chin up with practiced arrogance.

"But this face alone didn't get me where I am today."

Her manicured nails tapped against her champagne flute.

"Talent speaks louder than beauty in our world. And even if I stumble..."

A calculated pause.

"One must reach great heights before they can fall spectacularly, don't you think?"

Her gaze sharpened as it landed on Evelyn Carter.

"Shouldn't you be more concerned about your own predicament, Ms. Carter? That little wager with your board...quite the talk of the town."

Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow. "Your network of informants impresses me, Ms. Blackwood."

Juliette's lips curled in triumph.

"Rumors suggested it was mere gossip, but here we are." She took a deliberate sip. "The deadline looms, yet victory seems...elusive for you."

A theatrical gasp.

"Could the Kingsley heiress truly be ousted from her own company?"

Her laughter tinkled like broken glass, echoed by the sycophants surrounding them.

Evelyn remained unshaken, her posture regal. "Your concern touches me, but is quite unnecessary."

"Of course." Juliette's smile turned razor-sharp. "Still, I'll wish you luck. Public humiliation can be so...crushing."

Something dangerous flickered in Evelyn's eyes.

This petty socialite would never witness her downfall.

"Mr. Langley approaches," Juliette's assistant murmured urgently.

Juliette's demeanor shifted instantly. "Where?"

She'd orchestrated this encounter precisely - the nanotech collaboration between Evelyn and Victor Langley was nearing completion.

Sabotaging it would guarantee Evelyn's loss.

The thought of Kingsley Industries ejecting their own princess sent thrills down Juliette's spine.

"There."

Juliette moved with predatory grace. "Mr. Langley! Juliette Blackwood of Blackwood Designs. Such an honor."

Her outstretched hand hung suspended in air as Victor strode past without acknowledgment.

The snub left her frozen mid-curtsy.

"Ms. Carter." Victor's voice warmed noticeably as he reached Evelyn. "My apologies for keeping you waiting."

Evelyn recognized the deliberate slight and played along. "We've only just arrived, Mr. Langley."

Juliette's cheeks burned as she retracted her unshaken hand.

"Mr. Langley," she interjected with forced brightness, "Blackwood Designs shares your passion for nanotechnology. Perhaps we could—"

Victor turned his back completely. "Shall we continue our discussion inside, Ms. Carter? The gallery's acoustics are far more...selective."

The unspoken dismissal hung in the air like a guillotine blade.
