###Chapter 1

Evelyn Sinclair stepped out of the hospital, clutching the test results with trembling fingers. Tears welled in her eyes, though whether from joy or sorrow remained unclear.

"Miss Sinclair, you're expecting." The doctor's words echoed relentlessly in her mind.

Three months had passed since she married Alexander Blackwood - the most eligible bachelor from Willowbrook's most prestigious family.

On their wedding day, every woman in the city had envied her. She'd believed herself the luckiest woman alive.

That childhood seed planted when she first saw Alexander at ten years old had finally bloomed. For twelve years, she'd worked tirelessly to become worthy of him.

They came from different worlds - she, a girl raised in hardship; he, the golden heir of Blackwood Estate. What right had she to dream?

Yet fate played its cruel game. Three months ago at a friend's birthday party, she'd woken to find Alexander beside her.

The crimson stain on white sheets told its undeniable story.

Before she could process what happened, reporters swarmed the room, eager to expose Alexander's night with a mystery woman.

The Blackwoods were Willowbrook's first family - old money with impeccable reputation. Old Master Blackwood, a traditionalist, immediately announced their marriage.

For Evelyn, it felt like a dream turned nightmare.

Alexander didn't love her. He despised her. Blamed her for coming between him and his true love - Victoria Lancaster, who happened to be Evelyn's own half-sister.

Gathering courage, Evelyn tried calling Alexander.

As expected, he declined. She sent a timid text instead, hoping he'd come home tonight.

Three months of marriage, yet he'd never spent a single night in their bed. She knew exactly where he spent his nights.

No call back. No reply. Her heart sank - another lonely night ahead.

After showering, she'd just settled in when the bedroom door crashed open violently.

Her breath caught at the sight of his icy, handsome face. Her pulse raced uncontrollably.

"Alexander...you're home." She spoke his name softly, a tentative smile touching her lips.

He grabbed her arm brutally, throwing her onto the bed. His strong fingers gripped her chin, eyes burning with alcohol and fury.

"Evelyn, do you love me so desperately?" His voice dripped venomous mockery. "That you'd scheme your way into my bed?"

Her face paled as she stared at the man she'd loved for half her life, heart shattering.

"Alexander, you've got it wrong—"

"Wrong?" He laughed darkly, gaze full of contempt. "Stop pretending, Evelyn."

His grip tightened...
###Chapter 2

The morning light filtered through the curtains as Evelyn Sinclair stirred awake.

Before she could fully gather her senses, a small box landed on the bed beside her.

"Take it."

She lifted her gaze to find Alexander Blackwood already dressed, his sharp features as cold and unreadable as ever.

The man standing before her now bore no resemblance to the ruthless predator who had claimed her the night before.

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she picked up the box of birth control pills.

Her stomach twisted. She was already carrying his child—she couldn't take these. It would harm the baby.

"Why the hesitation? Need me to force them down your throat?"

Alexander's voice was laced with impatience when she didn’t move.

"Evelyn, let me make this clear. You will never bear my child. You're nothing but a treacherous viper who bites the hand that feeds her. You don’t deserve that privilege."

His words struck like a blade, piercing deep.

Though it was summer, an icy chill settled in her chest.

She had foolishly hoped this child might bridge the chasm between them. But now, she couldn’t even bring herself to tell him.

Under his merciless stare, she had no choice. She popped a pill into her mouth, pretending to swallow while hiding it beneath her tongue.

Guilt gnawed at her. What if he noticed?

Then, his phone rang.

Alexander glanced at the screen and answered immediately, his expression darkening.

"What? Victoria tried to kill herself? I'm on my way!"

Evelyn's breath caught. Victoria had attempted suicide?

Ignoring the lingering soreness in her body, she scrambled out of bed, hastily dressed, and rushed downstairs.

Alexander was already in his car, engine roaring. She yanked open the passenger door.

"Get your filthy hands off my car. Who gave you permission?"

His voice was a whip of disdain, making her recoil. In his eyes, she was nothing but dirt.

"Alexander, please. I need to see her—I'm worried."

"Worried?" His laugh was cruel. "Shouldn’t you be celebrating if she dies?"

With that, he sped off.

Evelyn stood frozen for a moment before hailing a cab, following him to Willowbrook General Hospital.

Inside Victoria’s room, Evelyn lingered near the doorway, watching as Alexander strode to the bed.

Victoria sat there, pale and fragile, tears glistening on her cheeks.

At least she was alive. Evelyn exhaled in relief.

The moment Victoria spotted Alexander, she crumpled into his arms with a broken sob.

"Alexander…"

Her voice was honey-sweet as she whispered her sorrows against his chest.

To Evelyn, they looked like the perfect couple—while she remained the unwanted outsider.

Swallowing her pain, she stepped forward.

"Victoria—"

"You ungrateful wretch! How dare you show your face here?"

A familiar voice lashed out before Evelyn could approach.

Margaret Dawson, Victoria’s mother, stormed in, her face twisted with rage.

Evelyn barely had time to turn before a stinging slap sent her reeling. Her vision blurred from the impact.

"You vile little snake! We took you in out of pity, clothed you, fed you—and this is how you repay us? Stealing Victoria’s fiancé?"

Margaret launched into a tirade about the night Evelyn had spent with Alexander months ago.

But it hadn’t been her choice.

Evelyn opened her mouth to explain—only for another slap to crack across her other cheek.

Blood welled on her lip. Her head spun, legs buckling.

Then Richard Montgomery, her adoptive father, delivered the final blow.

"Evelyn Sinclair, from this moment on, you are no longer a Montgomery. We disown you."

Before she could react, his foot connected with her ribs, sending her crashing to the floor.
###Chapter 3

Evelyn collapsed onto the floor, the sudden kick sending shockwaves through her body. Instinctively, her hands flew to her stomach, shielding the life growing inside her.

Before she could even catch her breath, Richard Montgomery struck her again, this time across the head.

"You wretched girl!" he snarled, his voice dripping with venom. "Why would Victoria throw her life away for someone like you? You're the one who should be dead!"

Every word was laced with hatred, his disgust for Evelyn palpable.

"Father, it's alright," Victoria's trembling voice cut through the tension. She stood at the other end of the room, tears streaming down her face. "I was never meant to be with Alexander. I don't blame Evelyn."

Evelyn's lip was split, blood trickling down her chin. Her head throbbed, but she forced herself to look up.

There, she saw Victoria pressed against Alexander Blackwood's chest, his arms wrapped protectively around her. His expression was tender, his gaze soft—a stark contrast to the cold indifference he always showed Evelyn.

The sight was like a knife to her heart.

If not for that fateful night, Alexander's wife would have been Victoria, not some unwanted outsider living on borrowed time.

Even though she hadn't orchestrated what happened, guilt gnawed at her.

"Victoria, how can you still defend her?" Richard seethed. "If she hadn't set that trap, you'd be Mrs. Blackwood now! You wouldn't have been driven to such despair!"

"Father, please," Victoria sighed, casting a wounded glance at Evelyn. "Evelyn, if you loved Alexander, you could have just told me. I would have stepped aside. But to go to such lengths... I'm so disappointed in you."

"Victoria, I didn't—"

"Still lying?" Richard roared. "You shameless wretch! I'll end you myself!"

He grabbed a nearby chair, raising it high. Evelyn flinched, curling in on herself, hands instinctively shielding her stomach.

"Get out," Alexander's icy voice cut through the room. "Unless you want to die here."

Richard froze, chair still in hand.

Trembling, Evelyn scrambled to her feet.

For her unborn child's sake, she had to escape.

Head bowed, she fled past the judgmental stares and whispered accusations. Her face burned, her steps unsteady as she limped toward the exit.

At the door, she realized she'd left her phone behind. Swallowing her fear, she turned back.

As she reached the elevator, the doors slid open—and Alexander stepped out.

He stood tall, unshaken, his striking features making him impossible to miss in the crowd.

Why was he leaving so soon? Shouldn't he be comforting Victoria?

Evelyn didn’t dare dwell on it. She ducked her head and slipped into the elevator.

Like a thief in the night, she crept back to Victoria's door, spotting her phone discarded near the wall.

Just as she bent to retrieve it, Victoria's laughter—bright and mocking—echoed from inside.

"That country mouse looked so pathetic, beaten down like that. It was almost satisfying."

Country mouse?

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Was she talking about her?

"If only I hadn’t walked into the wrong room that night," Victoria continued, her voice dripping with disdain. "Alexander would have been mine. That nobody doesn’t deserve him. It makes me sick, knowing he was tainted by her."

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

The truth was unraveling before her—but she wasn’t sure she could face it.
###Chapter 4

Evelyn couldn't reconcile the venomous woman hurling insults with the Victoria she knew.

From the moment she had been brought into the Montgomery household, Victoria had always appeared gracious, poised, and kind. But now...

"I'm furious! I spent weeks planning this—getting Alexander to drink that spiked wine, arranging for reporters to catch us together at dawn so Henry Blackwood would force him to marry me. And then I mixed up the damn room number and ended up with some filthy nobody while Evelyn got everything!"

So this was the truth. The sweet sister who had pleaded for mercy earlier was nothing but a viper.

Evelyn's pulse roared in her ears. A sickening hysteria clawed at her chest.

This was the woman Alexander adored—the gentle, refined Victoria everyone admired.

The sister Evelyn had respected all these years.

"You absolute fool! How could you mess up something so simple?" Margaret Dawson, Victoria's mother, snapped.

"I took the drugs too—I thought it would make it more fun! How was I supposed to know they'd hit me that hard?" Victoria's voice turned shrill. "What now? I can't stand her being Mrs. Blackwood for another second! Alexander is mine!"

"Relax," Richard Montgomery cut in smoothly. "Did you see how worried Alexander was just now? One word from you, and he'll divorce that gutter rat without hesitation."

Margaret chuckled. "Your father's right. Alexander only married her because Henry forced him. He loves you. The moment you ask, that title will be yours."

Victoria smirked. "Who does that trash think she is, daring to take what's mine? If her bone marrow hadn't matched mine, she'd still be rotting in that orphanage. Do you know how sick it makes me to call her my sister?"

Evelyn's vision darkened. Ice slithered up her spine.

The Montgomerys hadn't taken her in out of kindness. She was just a spare part for Victoria.

Five years of false sisterhood. Five years of being nothing when no one was watching.

Pathetic.

A bitter laugh lodged in Evelyn's throat. The truth was so ugly it made her stomach churn.

"Ugh! I staged this whole suicide scene to push Alexander into divorcing her, and then he just left for some emergency meeting!" Victoria whined.

Another act. Another manipulation.

And Alexander—sharp, ruthless Alexander—fell for it every time.

"Don't worry, darling," Margaret purred. "I'll call Alexander and tell him Evelyn came here to torment you, driving you to attempt suicide. He'll sign those papers before sunset."

Victoria brightened. "Perfect! Do it now!"

Evelyn's last shred of hope shattered.

With a cold smile, she pushed the door open. "Funny. Because as long as I'm breathing, Victoria, you'll never be Mrs. Blackwood."
###Chapter 5

The last person they expected to walk in was Evelyn. Her sudden appearance and sharp words froze the three occupants of the room.

A tense silence stretched for several seconds before Victoria’s expression twisted. The sweet, composed mask she always wore shattered, revealing something far uglier beneath. "Evelyn," she hissed. "What are you doing here?"

Evelyn’s eyes burned with unshed tears, but her laugh was bitter. "Perfect timing, don’t you think? Just in time to hear your little proposal."

Realization dawned on Victoria, and her face darkened. "You were eavesdropping?"

"Lucky for me," Evelyn shot back, voice trembling with fury. "Otherwise, I’d never have known what a two-faced snake my dear sister really is."

"How dare you speak to Victoria like that!" Margaret snarled, raising her hand to strike.

"Mother, don’t waste your energy on this orphaned peasant," Victoria sneered, her composure slipping back into place as she leveled Evelyn with a chilling smile. "Listen carefully, sister. For the sake of whatever remains between us, you will agree to divorce Alexander. Unless you want to regret it."

Evelyn had spent years pretending, playing the dutiful sister, the obedient wife. No more.

She met Victoria’s gaze, her own eerily calm. "Beg me," she said softly. "And I might consider it."

Victoria’s face contorted in disbelief. "Excuse me?"

"You insolent brat!" Margaret shrieked.

Evelyn laughed—wild, unrestrained. "Oh, I’ve lost my mind, haven’t I? So let me make this clear: I’m keeping Alexander and the title of Mrs. Blackwood. Forever."

Victoria’s composure shattered. "You disgusting little—"

"Too late," Evelyn cut in coldly. "The whole of Willowbrook already knows I’m Alexander’s wife. Not you."

With that, she turned on her heel, ignoring Victoria’s enraged screams behind her.

After leaving the hospital, Evelyn went to a women’s clinic.

She needed to know if the baby was alright—after Alexander’s cruelty the night before and her fall earlier, she couldn’t risk it.

The waiting room was packed, filled with pregnant women accompanied by doting husbands and families. Their happiness was a knife to Evelyn’s chest.

She carried the child of the man she loved.

A man who loved someone else.

Once, he had held her hand under the stars and promised to marry her.

Now, he despised the very sight of her.

The doctor confirmed the baby was fine. Relief flooded her, but it was short-lived.

When she returned home, the front door slammed open with a force that rattled the walls.

Alexander stood there, his striking features twisted with fury.

"Did you go after Victoria again?" His voice was ice.

Evelyn didn’t bother lying. "I did. But—"

"You’re vile."

The words cut deeper than any blade.

She stared at him, numb, as he advanced. His dark eyes were glacial.

"You told her you’d haunt me even in death? That you’d never let her take your place?"

Evelyn paled. She had never said that.

Before she could defend herself, Alexander grabbed her wrist and flung her onto the sofa.
###Chapter 6

Evelyn's face drained of all color. Terror gripped her heart as she witnessed Alexander's uncharacteristic brutality.

Never had she imagined the man she once loved could be so vicious. Her hands instinctively flew to her stomach, shielding the fragile life within from his rage.

But Alexander gave her no chance to escape. His iron grip imprisoned her against his body.

The realization struck her like a physical blow - he despised her with an intensity that bordered on madness.

Hours later, Evelyn collapsed into exhausted slumber, her body screaming in protest. In her dreams, she returned to that golden summer twelve years past.

Sunlight danced on the ocean waves that day at Pinecrest Heights. Beneath the ancient oak tree, a lonely boy sat watching the tide.

Young Evelyn collected seashells along the shore, stealing glances at the melancholy figure. Even at twelve, Alexander possessed striking features - tall for his age with an aristocratic bearing that contrasted sharply with his somber expression.

Barefoot, she approached cautiously, offering her most prized shell. "This is for you," she whispered. "May it bring you happiness."

Alexander's guarded eyes flickered toward her. His designer clothes marked him as someone from a different world than her faded sundress.

Yet to her astonishment, he accepted her gift.

They met again the following day. This time, Alexander presented her with a frothy strawberry milkshake - her first taste of such luxury. The sweetness paled in comparison to her radiant smile.

That summer became their secret paradise. They met daily at their special spot, building sandcastles and chasing waves.

When Evelyn cut her foot on broken glass, Alexander carried her to safety. Pressed against his back, her cheeks burned not from the sunset but from the wild pounding of her heart.

"Alexander," she murmured shyly, arms tightening around his neck. "I want to stay with you always. To play together every day."

"Then marry me when we grow up," he answered without hesitation. "We'll never have to be apart."

But childhood promises proved fragile. After their final goodbye, Evelyn didn't see Alexander again until fate reunited them - with Victoria Lancaster already claiming his heart.

Evelyn awoke to sterile white walls and the sharp tang of antiseptic. Every movement sent fresh waves of pain through her battered body.

"Well, look who decided to join the living." Victoria's venomous voice dripped with sarcasm. The beautiful socialite's fox-like eyes burned with barely contained fury.

Jealousy? Evelyn almost laughed at the absurdity.

"Only you, Evelyn, would resort to such dramatic measures for attention," Victoria sneered, gesturing to the hospital room.

Memories flooded back - Alexander's violent possession, her desperate pleas. Understanding dawned, and despite everything, a triumphant smile curved Evelyn's lips.

"You conniving little slut!" Victoria's perfectly manicured hands clenched into fists, veins protruding. "How dare you look pleased about this!"
###Chapter 7

Victoria's face contorted with rage as she screamed at Evelyn, jealousy twisting her features into something monstrous.

Evelyn merely smirked, unfazed. "As Alexander's wife, it's my pleasure to handle his troubles for him."

"Evelyn! You—you're despicable!" Victoria spat.

"I could never compare to you, Vic." Evelyn's voice dripped with sarcasm. "Drugging Alexander just to trap him into marriage? Tell me, did he refuse to touch you when he was sober?"

Victoria's expression faltered for a split second before she schooled her features into haughty indifference.

"Alexander adores me," she sneered. "He can't keep his hands off me. Every night, he's in my bed—unlike you. Pathetic little wife, waiting alone at home while your husband avoids you."

Her words were venomous. Then, with a flourish, she slammed a stack of papers onto the table.

"Divorce papers. Alexander wants you to sign them. Hurry up. He never wants to see a worthless, low-class woman like you again."

Evelyn had built walls around her heart, but they cracked at the sight of those papers.

Divorce.

Alexander wanted to end their marriage.

Ice flooded her veins, sharp and suffocating. She'd known this day would come—but not so soon.

Alexander loved Victoria. In this twisted game, Evelyn had already lost.

Watching Evelyn pale, Victoria let out a cruel laugh. "Look at you. Alexander would never love someone like you. He told me you're the most repulsive woman he's ever met. Marrying you was the biggest mistake of his life!"

Victoria stepped closer, sneering down at Evelyn, who still stared at the papers.

Then, without warning, Evelyn snatched them up—and tore them to shreds.

She flung the pieces into Victoria's face, a cold smile on her lips. "Tell Alexander I'll haunt him even from the grave. You want me to divorce him? Dream on."

Victoria's shock turned to fury. "How dare you, you little bitch! Do you have a death wish?"

Her mask slipped completely as she raised her hand to strike—but Evelyn moved faster.

The slap echoed through the room.

"Listen well, Victoria," Evelyn hissed. "I'll never sign those papers. And I'll make sure Alexander sees you for the vicious snake you are."

Her body trembled, but her voice didn't waver.

Any illusion of sisterhood between them was gone. Only hatred remained.

"You'll regret this!" Victoria shrieked, clutching her cheek. She stormed out, leaving Evelyn alone.

Evelyn sank onto the bed, pain flaring through her weakened body.

Minutes later, Victoria returned—but this time, she collapsed dramatically to the floor, tears streaming.

"Evie, please," she sobbed. "I'm sorry! Don't be angry with me. Blame me all you want—but not the baby. This is Alexander's child."

Evelyn froze.

Then she saw him—Alexander, standing in the doorway, his expression unreadable.

And she understood.

This was Victoria's final move.
###Chapter 8

The performance had been flawless. Evelyn couldn't find a single misstep in the act she had orchestrated.

Yet, she hadn’t anticipated Victoria being pregnant too.

But was the child really Alexander’s?

Evelyn remembered that night three months ago—when Victoria had stumbled into the wrong room, intending to ruin her, only to end up with some nameless stranger. If she was truly pregnant, the father remained questionable.

Still, Evelyn couldn’t ignore the fact that Alexander had spent countless nights with her.

The thought sent a sharp pang through her chest.

But nothing compared to the agony of watching Alexander cradle Victoria with such tenderness, his expression softening in a way Evelyn had never seen directed at her.

Victoria buried her face in her hands, her sobs pitiful and dramatic.

"Alexander, don’t blame Evelyn," she whimpered. "It’s my fault. I shouldn’t have fallen for you. But please… talk to her. I don’t want her to hurt our baby..."

At the mention of the child, Evelyn saw the shift in Alexander’s eyes—cold, calculating, then blazing with fury.

His gaze locked onto her like an arctic blade.

"Evelyn."

His voice was a whip crack, laced with venom.

She had never heard her name spoken gently from his lips. Only hatred. Only rage.

"She provoked me," Evelyn said, fighting to keep her voice steady. "Alexander, don’t be fooled. She’s not what she seems—"

"Enough." His tone was lethal. "Did you strike her?"

Evelyn pressed her lips together. "Yes."

She admitted it without hesitation, watching as Victoria smirked behind Alexander’s back, triumphant.

Alexander’s eyes burned with something dangerous.

The slap came without warning.

Evelyn’s head snapped to the side, the sting radiating across her cheek. The metallic tang of blood bloomed on her tongue.

Tears welled, spilling over before she could stop them.

He had never hit her before.

He had ignored her. Despised her. But never laid a hand on her.

"Apologize to Victoria. Now."

His voice was ice, his expression unreadable.

Victoria stepped forward, feigning distress.

"Alexander, it’s fine. Evelyn and I are sisters. She doesn’t need to apologize. This is my fault. You’re married to her. I shouldn’t have gotten involved, but I just… couldn’t stay away from you..."

"Stop lying, Victoria!" Evelyn snapped, her voice raw. "This was your plan all along!"

Victoria’s face crumpled. "Evelyn, how could you say that? What’s happened to you?"

"You happened!" Evelyn shot back. "You manipulative snake!"

"Evelyn!"

Alexander’s grip was iron as he yanked her from the bed, forcing her toward Victoria.

"Apologize."

His command left no room for defiance.
###Chapter 9

Evelyn felt as though a thousand knives had pierced her heart, each cut deeper than the last.

"Alexander, I'm telling the truth!"

"To me, nothing matters more than Victoria's feelings. What nonsense are you spouting?"

His cold dismissal was like a blade, slicing through her with brutal precision.

So, the truth didn’t matter. The only thing that mattered was his love for Victoria—a love that overshadowed everything else.

Her heart sank like a stone, dragging her hopes down with it.

Evelyn forced a bitter smile. "Fine. I’ll apologize."

She swallowed the agony burning through her body and bowed her head to Victoria.

The triumphant smirk on Victoria’s lips was blinding.

Evelyn had never imagined Alexander would discard the truth so easily. But love made people blind. And he loved Victoria—so much that nothing else existed.

Days passed without a single glimpse of him.

She needed a distraction, something to pull her out of this suffocating despair.

Evelyn had always excelled in jewelry design. She sent out applications, and soon, two companies responded. She chose the one closer to home, hoping work would numb the pain.

But no matter how hard she tried, thoughts of Alexander still haunted her.

Even though he despised her.

The autumn nights grew colder. Most employees had already left, but Evelyn stayed behind, drowning herself in unfinished designs.

Going home meant facing the emptiness.

At nearly ten, hunger gnawed at her.

Her hand drifted to her stomach, where a tiny life grew. The warmth of that thought was the only comfort she had left.

Then her phone rang.

Her pulse spiked.

Alexander.

After a moment’s hesitation, she answered, hope fluttering in her chest.

"Alexander—"

"Ah—yes! Alexander, you're incredible... I love you..."

A woman’s moans filled the line, followed by his low, satisfied groan.

Her heart plummeted.

She hung up, but the sounds were already seared into her mind. Tears spilled over, unstoppable.

She dragged herself home and pulled a bottle of red wine from Alexander’s cabinet.

One sip. Two.

Then she stopped.

She couldn’t hurt the baby.

But the pain was too much.

She drank until the world blurred.

In her drunken haze, she saw him—the man she had loved for twelve years.

Tall. Devastatingly handsome. The man who haunted her dreams.

Evelyn stumbled forward, wrapping her arms around his neck.

"Alexander," she whispered, her voice thick with intoxication. "You don’t need anyone else. I’m your wife. If you want something, take it from me."

She was throwing away every shred of pride.

She loved him. Loved him enough to beg.

He shoved her away in disgust.

But she clung to him like a desperate fool, fingers fumbling with his clothes. She rose on her toes, pressing her lips to his.

The scent of Victoria’s perfume clung to him.

She ignored it.

This might be her last chance to feel his touch.

She would be shameless.

She would be reckless.

She would take whatever scraps he gave her.
###Chapter 10

If the alarm hadn't blared that morning, Evelyn would have slept through the day.

Her cheeks burned remembering her drunken behavior with Alexander last night.

Back at her design studio, Evelyn's fingers moved mechanically across her sketchpad. His shadow haunted her every thought.

Twelve years of love doesn't vanish overnight.

Her hand drifted to her flat stomach. This child deserved a loving family.

Ding!

The phone notification snapped her back to reality.

Alexander's name flashed on the screen. Her pulse quickened.

The attached photo showed two girls - one radiant in designer silk, the other drowning in drab cotton.

Victoria Lancaster shone like royalty. Evelyn Sinclair faded into the background.

The accompanying message turned her fingers to ice:

Look at Victoria, then yourself. How could gutter trash like you ever be my wife?

Each word stabbed deeper than the last.

She remembered that golden summer twelve years ago. The boy who'd called her his angel now saw only dirt.

Alexander, you promised I'd be your bride. What happened to that boy?

Her fingers flew across the screen:

I know you hate me, but I'm carrying your child. Give us this chance.

The seconds stretched endlessly.

His reply came swift as a guillotine:

Get rid of it.

Before she could breathe, another message:

Only Victoria bears my heirs. Sign the papers or I'll end that bastard myself.

Her blood crystallized in her veins.

Across town, Victoria deleted the entire conversation, palms slick with sweat.

Two years ago, she'd found Evelyn's diary and a signed bookmark from Alexander dated a decade past.

The automatic doors hissed open. Victoria slid Alexander's phone back into place just as his shadow fell across the desk.
###Chapter 11

The Blackwood Estate felt hollow as Evelyn returned alone. The weight of divorce papers and Alexander's cruel response pressed heavily on her chest. Each heartbeat sent sharp pains through her, as if invisible blades were carving her from within.

She had never imagined Alexander could despise her this much. His demand for her to terminate the pregnancy had been delivered with such chilling indifference. The thought terrified her. What if he actually forced her to go through with it?

The sound of the front door opening startled her. Alexander strode in, his tailored suit accentuating his commanding presence. His sharp features were as flawless as ever, but his eyes held their usual glacial disdain.

Evelyn's pulse quickened with nervous dread. She braced herself for another confrontation about the baby. Instead, he merely informed her they would be attending his mother's 50th birthday celebration at Blackwood Estate the following day - as husband and wife.

For a fleeting moment, hope flickered in her chest. Was this his way of reconsidering their marriage?

That fragile hope shattered instantly when he spoke again. His voice was arctic. "Don't mistake this for anything but obligation, Evelyn. I could never love someone as shameless as you."

His words cut deeper than any physical wound.

Evelyn laughed bitterly, a mischievous glint appearing in her clear blue eyes. "You're right, I am shameless. But tell me, Alexander, how does my shame compare to your precious Victoria's?"

Alexander froze mid-motion, his suit jacket half-removed. When he turned, his handsome face was a mask of fury. "Careful, Evelyn. You're playing with fire."

"I'm simply stating facts. Do you know why you slept with me three months ago?" Evelyn stepped closer, confidence radiating from her. "It was Victoria's scheme. She planned to seduce you that night."

Evelyn watched with satisfaction as his expression darkened. "But fate intervened. She ended up in another man's bed. So tell me, Alexander - is the child she's carrying even yours?"

Alexander moved with terrifying speed. His hand closed around her slender throat, cutting off her air supply. Evelyn clawed at his wrist as black spots danced in her vision.

"You expect me to believe your lies? How dare you compare yourself to Victoria!" He released her with a violent shove.

Evelyn gasped for breath, stumbling backward. Her stomach connected painfully with the sharp corner of their bed. White-hot agony exploded through her abdomen. Cold sweat broke out across her skin as she clutched her belly.

"Alexander... please... it hurts..." Her voice was barely a whisper.

He paused at the doorway, casting her a dispassionate glance. "Your acting improves daily. I wouldn't care if you were dying, let alone when you're clearly fine."

His indifference hurt more than the physical pain. Darkness swallowed her consciousness.

When Evelyn awoke, sunlight streamed through hospital windows. Memory returned in a rush. Her hands flew to her abdomen in panic.

The attending physician entered with a disapproving frown. "The pregnancy is stable - for now."

Evelyn's blood ran cold. "What do you mean 'for now'?"

The doctor's expression was clinical. "You have a malignant uterine tumor. The pregnancy must be terminated, or it will endanger your life as well."
###Chapter 12

Evelyn's mind went completely blank. The world around her seemed to freeze.

"Evie. Evie."

After what felt like an eternity, Evelyn heard her name being called.

She blinked back to reality and saw a familiar face - her only true friend, Olivia Bennett.

Olivia took one look at Evelyn's ghostly pale complexion and felt fury bubble up inside her.

"Evelyn Sinclair, you absolute idiot! How could you keep something this huge from me?"

Evelyn frowned in confusion. "Olivia? What are you doing here?"

"Me? You're the one who called me last night slurring your words before passing out mid-sentence." Olivia pressed a palm to Evelyn's forehead. "Did you get amnesia or something?"

Of course Evelyn remembered. She remembered Alexander's hands around her throat. She remembered him leaving her crumpled on the floor after she hit her abdomen against the bed frame. The way he'd walked away without a backward glance, his cruel words still ringing in her ears.

The memory cut through her like shards of glass.

Olivia sat heavily on the hospital bed, her expression grave. "Where's Alexander? Your husband should be here, not gallivanting God knows where."

Evelyn avoided her gaze. "He's... busy with work."

"Busy with that mistress of his, Victoria Lancaster, you mean?" Olivia spat out the name like poison.

"Evelyn, you're so obsessed with that man you've lost all sense. Look at you! And you're still making excuses for him."

Evelyn let out a hollow laugh. "Love makes you stupid, I guess."

"Well you won't be loving him much longer." Olivia never minced words. "Did you hear what Dr. Hayes said earlier?"

Evelyn froze. The way Olivia was looking at her made her stomach drop.

"You can always have another baby. Your life comes first."

Evelyn's laugh was bitter. "There won't be another chance."

Olivia frowned in confusion. Just as she opened her mouth to respond, Evelyn suddenly grabbed her wrist.

"Olivia, promise me you won't tell anyone. Especially Alexander."

"Are you out of your damn mind? You'd risk your life for this pregnancy?"

Olivia shot to her feet, ready to unleash her fury, when Evelyn's phone rang with Alexander's custom tone.

Evelyn's hands trembled as she checked the caller ID. After three rings, she answered.

"Evelyn, is this some kind of joke?" Alexander's cold voice cut through the line.

She had no idea what he meant.

"If you're not home in thirty minutes, don't bother coming back at all."

Then she remembered - today was his mother's fiftieth birthday party. As his wife, her attendance was mandatory.

Before she could respond, Olivia snatched the phone. "Alexander Blackwood, is this how a husband behaves? Do you even know your wife is—"

Panicked, Evelyn grabbed the phone back. "I'll be right there!" She hung up before Olivia could finish.

Olivia glared at her with undisguised disappointment, but had no choice. As she helped Evelyn into a cab, she gripped her shoulders tightly. "Take care of yourself, you hear me?"

Evelyn nodded weakly.

When Evelyn arrived at Blackwood Estate, the party was in full swing. Society's elite mingled in the gardens, their designer outfits glittering under the string lights. In her hospital-issued gray sweats, Evelyn looked like she'd wandered in from another universe.

Head down, she searched for Alexander. Then a woman turned abruptly, spilling red wine down the front of Evelyn's shirt.

"My Valentino!" The woman shrieked, glaring at Evelyn. "Watch where you're going, you clumsy oaf! What kind of help does the Blackwoods hire these days?"
###Chapter 13

The woman’s shrill accusations drew the attention of the surrounding guests. Despite the humiliation, Evelyn Sinclair maintained her composure.

“Madam, you were the one who bumped into me,” she said calmly. “And I’m not the Blackwoods’ maid.”

The woman blinked, then raked her gaze over Evelyn’s simple attire. A smirk curled her lips. “You don’t look like a maid. More like a street rat.”

Snickers erupted from the crowd. Evelyn clenched her fists but refused to engage further. Just as she turned to leave, Victoria Lancaster appeared, impeccably dressed and radiating false concern.

“Oh, Evelyn! What’s going on here?”

The woman’s eyes lit up with recognition. “Mrs. Blackwood, you know this thief?”

Evelyn stiffened. The woman had mistaken Victoria for Alexander’s wife—and Victoria made no effort to correct her. Instead, she smiled sweetly.

“Mrs. Harrington, please, let’s not make a scene.”

“Since you’re asking, I’ll let it go.” Mrs. Harrington shot Evelyn a venomous glare. “Watch yourself next time.”

Evelyn opened her mouth to reveal her true identity, but Victoria grabbed her arm, feigning worry. “Evelyn, are you hurt?”

Disgust twisted Evelyn’s stomach at the act. She tried to pull away, but Mrs. Harrington suddenly seized her wrist.

“Wait! You’re not going anywhere!” The woman’s face darkened. “No wonder you crashed into me—you were trying to steal my bracelet!”

Evelyn’s breath hitched. The accusation was absurd.

Victoria rushed to her side, her voice dripping with false sympathy. “Mrs. Harrington, there must be a misunderstanding. Evelyn used to have… sticky fingers, but she’s changed.”

The words weren’t a defense—they were an indictment.

Murmurs spread through the crowd. Evelyn’s pulse raced. If this scandal tarnished the Blackwoods’ reputation, it would be disastrous.

“I didn’t steal anything!” she insisted.

Mrs. Harrington scoffed. “Then prove it. Let me search you.”

Evelyn had nothing to hide—until Victoria’s hand slipped into her pocket.

“See? It’s just a mistake—” Victoria’s voice cut off as her fingers closed around something.

Her expression shifted to theatrical disappointment as she pulled out a glittering diamond bracelet.

“Evelyn… how could you?”

Evelyn’s blood ran cold. She hadn’t taken anything.

“That’s my bracelet!” Mrs. Harrington shrieked, already dialing the police.

Panic clawed at Evelyn’s throat. Today was Margaret Blackwood’s fiftieth birthday. If her daughter-in-law was arrested for theft, the scandal would be catastrophic.

The crowd thickened, their whispers sharp as knives. Victoria sighed, shaking her head. “Evelyn, I know you grew up with nothing, but stealing at an event like this?”

“I didn’t do this!”

No one listened.

Then it hit her—Victoria had brushed against her moments ago.

She’d planted the bracelet.

Before Evelyn could react, the police arrived.

Hands clamped around her arms.

They were taking her away.
###Chapter 14

Evelyn was moments away from being escorted out by security when a poised woman in an emerald gown approached Mrs. Harrington. The woman whispered something urgently into the socialite's ear.

Mrs. Harrington's expression shifted instantly. Her eyes widened as she stared at Evelyn with newfound apprehension. "This appears to be a misunderstanding," she announced stiffly.

Evelyn blinked in confusion. When her gaze met the stranger's, she recoiled at the undisguised revulsion in those cold eyes. The woman's stare made Evelyn's skin crawl.

Victoria chose that moment to appear, placing a comforting hand on Evelyn's arm. "Evie, darling, that's Alexander's mother. Everything's been sorted, but really—" Her voice dropped to a chastising whisper, "You mustn't embarrass yourself like this again."

Before Evelyn could protest, Mrs. Blackwood turned sharply on her heel and strode away, leaving behind a cloud of expensive perfume. Victoria immediately fell into step beside her, the picture of a devoted future daughter-in-law.

Snickers rippled through the crowd. The idea that a Blackwood would stoop to theft was laughable.

Evelyn's cheeks burned under the weight of suspicious glances. She fled inside the grand estate, only to collide with Alexander himself.

His gaze swept over her disheveled appearance—the dust on her skirt, the messy hair—and his mouth twisted in displeasure. "Today is my mother's fiftieth birthday," he said through clenched teeth. "And you show up late, looking like you've been dragged through a hedge, and now this theft business? Are you trying to humiliate me?"

Evelyn's bitter smile didn't reach her eyes. She'd spent the previous night in the emergency room after Alexander's rough handling nearly cost them their baby. The doctors had mentioned something about a tumor, but she'd rushed here before getting answers.

She hadn't even had time to change.

"Alexander," she began, "I didn't steal anything. It was Victoria—"

"You're seriously blaming Victoria for the bracelet in your pocket?" His laugh was cruel. "Have you no shame, Evelyn?"

The words struck like physical blows. As Alexander walked away, Evelyn retreated upstairs to his childhood bedroom—a space she'd never been invited to enter before.

The walk-in closet held several couture gowns, each more exquisite than the last. She was reaching for one when Victoria appeared in the doorway.

"Look at you," Victoria sneered, examining Evelyn's rumpled dress. "No amount of expensive fabric could make you look like anything but trash."

Evelyn tilted her chin up. "Funny, since I'm the one with the wedding ring. What does that make you?"

Victoria's face contorted with rage. "Enjoy your victory while it lasts. Alexander will divorce you soon enough. And that bastard in your belly?" Her smile turned vicious. "He'll make sure neither of you survive."

"You'd know all about bastards, wouldn't you?" Evelyn shot back. "You planted that bracelet on me."

Victoria shrugged, no longer bothering with pretense. "Prove it. No one will believe you over me. Soon, everyone will be calling me Mrs. Blackwood."

After Victoria left, Evelyn showered quickly and changed into a Chanel ensemble from Alexander's closet. A touch of makeup brought color back to her pale face.

The mirror reflected an elegant stranger—one with haunted eyes. No matter how beautiful she looked, Alexander would never see her.

Her hand drifted to her stomach. Perhaps Olivia was right—her love for Alexander would die with her.

The door burst open. Alexander stood there, impatience rolling off him in waves.

Evelyn forced a bright smile, masking her pain. Something flickered in Alexander's gaze as he approached. Without warning, his arm snaked around her waist, pulling her close.

The sudden contact made her breath catch. His touch burned through the silk of her dress as his fingers pressed possessively against her hip.
###Chapter 15

Alexander's unexpected touch sent Evelyn's pulse racing. Heat flooded her cheeks as she struggled to maintain composure.

She glanced up at his striking profile, finding his expression unreadably neutral.

"Grandfather is watching."

Those three icy words shattered her momentary illusion. This was all for show - another performance for Henry Blackwood's benefit.

The realization turned her blood to ice. How ironic that the only time he touched her willingly was for deception.

At the dinner table, only one person didn't belong - Victoria. Yet the old patriarch's kind gaze kept drifting to Evelyn with unsettling familiarity, as if recalling some long-forgotten memory.

What shocked Evelyn most was how thoroughly Alexander played his role. He served her portions, even peeled shrimp with meticulous care - all while flashing rare smiles that never reached his eyes.

Across the table, Victoria's forced grin couldn't mask her seething jealousy.

For one surreal hour, Evelyn allowed herself to pretend. When Alexander took her hand leaving the estate, his warmth seeped into her bones. She wanted to freeze this moment, preserve this fleeting tenderness...

Reality struck like a slap.

At the car, Alexander wrenched his hand away as if burned. "Get lost."

The venom in his voice left her reeling. She watched numbly as he ushered Victoria into the passenger seat with exaggerated care.

The engine roared to life. Tires screeched. Then silence.

Abandoned on the deserted street, autumn winds whipped at Evelyn's dress. The chill penetrated deeper than flesh, freezing the last traces of their charade.

Alexander never came home that night.

While imagining him tangled with Victoria, Evelyn scoured medical sites about her condition. Each click drove the knife deeper.

The tumor's position made surgery perilous. Even terminating the pregnancy might not save her. If these were her final months, she'd risk everything to bring their child into the world.

At dawn, hospital tests confirmed her fate. The results blurred through unshed tears.

"Oh Alexander... I thought I'd have a lifetime to wear you down. How cruel that my time runs short."

Wandering dazed through the city, her phone chimed with an anonymous message. The attached video showed the bracelet incident - clear footage of Victoria planting it in Evelyn's coat.

She didn't question this miracle. A cab brought her straight to Blackwood Enterprises.

However little time remained, she wouldn't let that viper keep deceiving Alexander.

The receptionist's curious stare followed her to the elevators. Whispers trailed behind her like poison. Twitter notifications exploded with yesterday's scandal - #GoldDiggerEvelyn trending with vicious comments about "tacky social climbers."

She burst into Alexander's office as his meeting concluded. His glacial glare cut deeper than any online insult. "Have you no shame showing your face here?"

Wordlessly, Evelyn thrust her phone forward. "Watch carefully. See who the real thief is."
###Chapter 16

Alexander finished watching the video, his expression turning icy. "Where did you obtain this?" His voice cut through the air like winter wind.

Evelyn couldn't believe his priorities. "Does the source matter more than the truth you're seeing?"

"The truth?" Alexander scoffed, swiping to delete the video. With another tap, he erased the backup from Evelyn's cloud storage.

Her breath caught. She lunged for her phone, but it was too late. The trash folder had been emptied.

"Alexander, why?" Her voice cracked. "Don't you see how they're crucifying me online? That was my only proof!"

He regarded her with detached amusement. "Your innocence means nothing to me. Only Victoria's happiness matters."

His words struck like physical blows.

Her reputation. Her life. None of it concerned him.

Victoria could commit murder, and he'd hand her the knife. That's how deeply love had blinded him.

Suddenly, Evelyn's tears stopped. She studied his perfect features through watery eyes. "Alexander... If online bullying drove me to suicide someday, would you care?"

He didn't look up from his phone. "Would you actually die?"

The casual cruelty shattered her. Pain radiated from her chest in waves.

Evelyn clenched her fists until her nails bit flesh. His face blurred behind her tears. "I hope... you'll remember this indifference when that day comes."

She turned before he could see her breakdown. Hot tears traced paths down her cheeks as she fled.

Twelve years of devotion—wasted on a man who'd watch her drown without lifting a finger.

Rain began falling as Evelyn stumbled outside. Distracted by grief, she didn't see the speeding car until its brakes screeched.

Through the downpour and her tears, she glimpsed a man rushing toward her. Then—darkness.

When Evelyn awoke, moonlight streamed through unfamiliar windows. The elegant penthouse smelled of sandalwood and citrus.

A tall figure entered carrying a steaming mug. Recognition dawned. "Nathaniel?"

His smile warmed the room. "Long time no see, Evie."

Years had passed since Nathaniel graduated and left Willowbrook. His private physician had already examined her. "Just exhaustion and mild dehydration," he said, offering the mug.

Evelyn accepted it with trembling hands. "I'm so sorry for the trouble."

"No trouble at all." His gaze held hers. "Your wellbeing is all that matters."

The kindness undid her. Alexander's cruel words echoed anew. This was the price of unrequited love—her heart, broken beyond repair.

She made to leave, but Nathaniel had ordered an extravagant spread from The Diamond Hotel. Not wanting to offend, she stayed.

After dinner, he insisted on driving her home. As they pulled up to Blackwood Estate, Nathaniel hesitated. "My doctor mentioned... your pregnancy. Does Alexander know?"

Moonlight illuminated his concerned expression.

"Of course my husband knows," Evelyn lied smoothly. She forced a smile. "Dinner's on me next time."

"I'll hold you to that, Evie." His warm chuckle followed her inside.

The door hadn't fully closed when an iron grip yanked her sideways. Evelyn's nose smashed into a rock-hard chest. Alexander's voice dripped venom above her. "Evelyn Sinclair. You're even more of a whore than I imagined."
###Chapter 17

Alexander's icy accusations poured over Evelyn like a winter storm. The irony of his words twisted like a knife in her chest.

"Didn't you already know about it, Mr. Blackwood?"

Her response only fueled his fury. His fingers dug into her chin, forcing her to meet his darkened gaze—eyes like a tempest, swirling with barely restrained rage.

"So, you went looking for your old flame, hmm?"

Old flame? He must mean Nathaniel.

Nathaniel had once been Alexander's classmate, two years their senior. When he confessed to Evelyn at graduation, the entire school assumed they were dating.

She never realized Alexander had believed those rumors too.

"Evelyn, listen carefully," he growled. "Even if I discard you one day, don’t think you can run to another man. Let’s see who dares pick up the trash I’ve thrown away!"

Trash.

The word carved into her heart.

With a strength she didn’t know she possessed, Evelyn shoved him away. "Alexander, just because you’re unfaithful doesn’t mean I am! You’re the only man I’ve ever been with. So when you insult me, you insult yourself!"

Before he could react, she fled to her room.

Alexander stood frozen, the sudden emptiness in his arms leaving him disoriented. His gaze followed her retreating figure, his expression unreadable under the pale moonlight.

The next morning, Evelyn arrived at work only to be summoned by HR.

Her manager slid a resignation letter across the desk without meeting her eyes. "Our company doesn’t tolerate thieves."

The video of her "stealing" had gone viral.

She’d had proof of her innocence—until Alexander destroyed it.

Now, the world saw her as nothing but a shameless criminal.

Anger and helplessness coiled inside her, but there was nothing she could do. In Willowbrook, Alexander’s word was law.

And he would never defend her. He wanted her erased.

Job applications led to swift rejections. Worse, a persistent ache in her abdomen sent fear coursing through her.

She rushed to the hospital, praying for her baby’s safety.

The waiting room was crowded with expectant mothers, their husbands doting on them. The sight twisted Evelyn’s heart.

She couldn’t even imagine Alexander accompanying her to a checkup.

That dream was long dead.

"Well, if it isn’t Evelyn."

Victoria’s saccharine voice cut through her thoughts. Dressed in a flowing blouse, she smiled sweetly.

"Here for your checkup too? Where’s Alexander?"

Evelyn’s nails bit into her palms, but she refused to show weakness. "He’s not with you either. He’ll find out about that bastard in your stomach soon enough."

Victoria’s smile faltered, then returned, triumphant. "Oh, Alexander? He’s fetching my test results right now."
###Chapter 18

Evelyn had believed her comeback was flawless. Yet Victoria's words struck like a poisoned arrow, leaving her defenses shattered.

Alexander was here with Victoria for her prenatal appointment.

This sacred ritual belonged to husbands and wives. Yet Alexander had prioritized another woman.

Victoria strutted forward with feline grace. "Evelyn darling, why so pale? Heart aching?" Her voice dripped with false concern.

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms, but she maintained her regal posture. "Only disgusted by your shamelessness."

Her icy gaze traced Victoria's contorted features.

"Truly remarkable how you flaunt your mistress status like a badge of honor. Even vermin have more dignity."

Victoria's painted lips twisted. Then, with calculated timing, her expression melted into theatrical distress.

"Evelyn please!" She grabbed Evelyn's wrist with surprising strength. "I love Alexander! Don't take him from me!"

The performance escalated rapidly.

"Hit me if you must! But spare my baby!" Victoria's scream echoed through the corridor as she dramatically released Evelyn's hand and tumbled down the marble staircase.

Gasps erupted. Dozens of accusing eyes burned into Evelyn.

"That woman pushed a pregnant lady!" someone shrieked.

Evelyn's protests drowned in the growing outrage. As she moved to check on Victoria, a brutal shove sent her crashing against the wrought-iron railing.

Agony exploded through her abdomen. Through tear-blurred vision, she watched Alexander sprint past without glancing her way, gathering his unconscious mistress with tender care.

The betrayal carved deeper than any physical wound.

'Alexander, how could you?'

'If loving you was my crime, then I deserve this punishment.'

Evelyn expected harsh words, perhaps another public humiliation. Not the cold click of handcuffs around her wrists.

"Evelyn Sinclair," the officer intoned. "You're under arrest for assault based on eyewitness testimony and video evidence."

The interrogation room smelled of stale coffee and despair. Security footage showed their confrontation - Victoria's pleading demeanor contrasting with Evelyn's stony expression. Then the damning moment when Victoria fell.

Two pregnant witnesses corroborated the story with rehearsed precision.

The trap had sprung perfectly.

As the cell door clanged shut, panic clawed at Evelyn's throat. The flickering fluorescent light revealed peeling paint and rusted bars.

A conviction meant prison. Meant her unborn child suffering for crimes they didn't commit.

She lunged for the bars, voice raw. "I was framed! Let me see my husband! Please, I need to speak with Alexander!"

The echoes of her pleas faded into institutional indifference. Somewhere beyond these walls, Victoria was being cradled in Alexander's arms while Evelyn's world crumbled.
###Chapter 19

Alexander arrived eventually, though not because Evelyn had requested his presence.

His purpose was far more sinister - to unleash his fury upon her.

The interrogation room's dim lighting barely illuminated the space, yet it revealed every trace of malice twisting Alexander's handsome features.

"I didn't push Victoria," Evelyn insisted, her voice steady despite her trembling hands. "She staged that fall. Alexander, you must believe me!"

His response came swift as a viper's strike. Ice-cold fingers closed around her nape, yanking her forward until their faces nearly touched.

Those fathomless dark eyes burned with contempt. "Eyewitnesses. Video evidence. And still you dare lie to my face?"

"It's the truth! Victoria set me up! I never touched her!" Evelyn's composure shattered, desperation leaking into every word.

Alexander's grip tightened painfully. "You expect me to believe Victoria would risk her unborn child to frame you? Pathetic."

"The baby isn't even—"

"Enough!"

The roar cut through Evelyn's explanation like a blade. Alexander shoved her away violently.

Handcuffed wrists prevented Evelyn from breaking her fall. She crashed onto the concrete, white-hot pain exploding through her abdomen. Gritting her teeth, she lifted her sweat-drenched face.

"Alexander, I'm telling the truth!"

He loomed over her, a dark silhouette against the flickering fluorescent lights. "Save your lies for the courtroom. If anything happens to Victoria or that child, I'll make sure you rot in prison forever."

His polished leather shoes turned away without hesitation.

"Alexander!" Evelyn crawled after him, her plea raw with pain. "My stomach... I need help!"

The slamming iron door answered her.

That night, the cramps worsened. When Evelyn told the guards about her pregnancy, they exchanged knowing smirks. Later, cellmates descended upon her like vultures.

Evelyn curled into a protective ball as blows rained down.

The ringleader fisted Evelyn's matted hair, yanking her head back. "Mr. Blackwood sends his regards," she sneered. "Nobody messes with his woman."

Evelyn's blood turned to ice. This was Alexander's idea of "special treatment."

Morning brought no reprieve. The officer rolled his eyes at Evelyn's bruises. "Delusional much? Nothing happened here."

In that moment, Evelyn understood - in Willowbrook, Alexander's word was law.

Tears blurred her vision as memories surfaced. 'You promised to always protect me, Alexander.'

Miraculously, release came two days later. The plaintiff had mysteriously dropped charges, though reserved the right to reopen the case.

Outside, drizzle painted the world gray.

Evelyn limped forward, only to freeze at the familiar silver Bentley.

Nathaniel emerged, umbrella in hand. "I came for you."

Evelyn shrank back. Two days in filth had left her unfit for his pristine leather seats.

"Get in," Nathaniel insisted, holding the door. "Let me take you home."

The rain intensified during the drive to Maplewood Avenue. As Evelyn moved to exit, Nathaniel's quiet question stopped her: "Does he hurt you?"

Evelyn turned her face away. "Alexander treats me wonderfully. Thank you, Nate."

She fled into the downpour, rain mingling with tears on her cheeks. The mansion door swung open before she reached it.

Alexander stood framed in the doorway, his expression unreadable.
###Chapter 20

When Evelyn recalled her battered appearance, her stomach twisted with dread.

Every woman longed to show her most radiant self to the man she loved. Yet whenever she stood before Alexander, she was always at her most broken. Now, fresh scars from his cruelty marred her skin.

"Who permitted you to step foot here?" Alexander's voice cut through the air as he halted by the doorway.

Evelyn met his gaze. "This is my home."

"Your home?" A dark chuckle rumbled from his chest. "You dare claim this as yours?"

The light in Evelyn's eyes dimmed. Each word from Alexander pierced her heart like shards of glass.

"If Victoria hadn't shown mercy, you'd still be rotting behind bars." His voice softened when speaking of Victoria.

Evelyn's lips curled bitterly. "Yes, if not for her kindness, I wouldn't be in this living hell."

Alexander's expression darkened dangerously. "You still have the audacity to speak back?"

"Alexander, I'm not! I'm telling the truth!" Evelyn balled her fists, lifting her chin defiantly.

Yet the man's handsome features remained frozen. His icy gaze raked over her. "No? Fine. Kneel there until the rain stops. Then I might believe you."

Evelyn froze, her hand instinctively flying to her abdomen.

"Don't you want my trust? Why hesitate?" Alexander's voice was arctic.

Raindrops pelted Evelyn's skin as she stared at the man who once cherished her. "Alexander, I'm—"

"Alexander, I'm starving."

Victoria's saccharine voice interrupted from inside the house.

So she was here.

Agony spread through Evelyn's veins like poison. Her heart plummeted into an endless void.

Alexander regarded Evelyn with impatience. "Victoria's staying tonight. If you wish to enter, kneel until I'm satisfied."

The door slammed shut with finality.

Cold rain seeped into Evelyn's bones, her heart's temperature dropping with her body's.

As night fell, lights flickered on in the master bedroom. Two silhouettes danced across the curtains—a sight that tore at Evelyn's soul.

'Alexander, will you ever believe me?'

'In the end, my presence could never compare to Victoria's warmth in your bed...'

Dawn found Evelyn still kneeling, her consciousness wavering when Victoria's mocking voice pierced the morning air.

"Evelyn, who knew you'd grovel all night for Alexander's attention?"

Victoria's vibrant tone betrayed no sign of injury from her alleged fall. The child within her remained unharmed.

"If you enjoy kneeling, by all means continue!"

Her cruel laughter echoed as she departed.

Evelyn's throat burned. Weakness consumed her, leaving no strength for arguments.

After hours unmoving, her limbs screamed in protest as she staggered upright. She barely crossed the threshold when Alexander materialized before her.

Her knees buckled. Trembling fingers grasped his sleeve. "Alexander, please... I never pushed Victoria—"

"Why should I believe a venomous creature like you?" He shoved her away violently.

Pain exploded through Evelyn's skull as she collapsed. Clutching her abdomen, cold sweat beaded on her brow.

Thinking of her unborn child, she clawed at Alexander's trousers. "Alexander... the baby... hospital..."

"Enough with the theatrics," he sneered.

"No... Alexander... the pain..." Her whisper faded as darkness threatened.

Even as consciousness slipped, she clung to him. "Hate me... but the child... yours..."

"A child?" Alexander's laugh was cruel. "More lies? Disappear!"

His kick sent her sprawling. Evelyn's broken laughter mingled with tears as she gazed up at her tormentor. "Twelve years ago... a boy promised, 'Lillian, I'll protect you forever...' Was it all lies? These twelve years... just pathetic delusions? You're not my Alex anymore..."

Alexander's heart stuttered. A long-buried memory surfaced—a sunlit beach, a girl called Lillian with laughing eyes.

That innocent girl had captured his young heart. He'd vowed to marry her, to cherish her always.

When he'd learned Victoria was that girl, he'd sworn to protect her at all costs.

So why did Evelyn speak of promises meant for another?

Something primal stirred within him. Gripping Evelyn's shoulders, he demanded, "What did you say?"
###Chapter 21

Alexander's hands trembled uncontrollably. A sharp pain pierced through his chest as if invisible thorns were tearing his heart apart. Without thinking, he scooped Evelyn into his arms.

"Alexander! Where are you taking Evelyn?" Victoria's shrill voice cut through the air as she rushed forward to block his path.

Ignoring her completely, Alexander dashed toward the hospital with Evelyn cradled against his pounding chest. The memory of their first childhood meeting flashed before his eyes - that quiet, golden afternoon that had haunted his dreams for years.

His pulse raced erratically. The man who had sworn to despise Evelyn forever now found himself sprinting through the hospital doors, shouting for help. The crimson stains on his shirt mocked him - she had told him about the pregnancy, about their child.

An invisible vise tightened around his throat. For the first time in years, Alexander prayed desperately for Evelyn's survival.

Pacing outside the operating room, he nearly collided with a nurse emerging through the swinging doors. "How is she? My wife - is she—"

The nurse's glare could have frozen hell. "Some husband you are. Letting a pregnant woman run through the storm covered in injuries? She's hemorrhaging with a high fever. Only divine intervention can save that baby now."

Alexander's vision blurred. The suffocating guilt threatened to drown him. Only one thought remained clear - Evelyn must survive.

When the operating lights finally dimmed, Alexander rushed to the gurney. Evelyn's ghostly pallor sent another stab through his chest. He grasped her icy fingers, his usual cold demeanor shattered.

'Evelyn... why did you call me Lex? How do you know about my childhood promise to Lillian?'

In the VIP suite, Evelyn floated in and out of consciousness. Warmth seeped into her bones from someone's steady grip on her hand.

Morning light stung her eyes when she finally awoke. Her fingers twitched - still encased in a familiar, comforting warmth. Blinking in disbelief, she found Alexander slumped beside her bed, their hands still entwined.

This had to be a dream.

Alexander stirred the moment she moved. His palm pressed against her forehead - checking the fever that had broken overnight. Evelyn's breath hitched at his unexpected tenderness.

"Alexander—" Her throat burned with the effort.

"Don't speak." His voice held an unfamiliar softness. "Let me get you water."

Tears pricked her eyes as he carefully helped her sip. The man who had ignored her existence for years now cradled her against his chest with heartbreaking gentleness.

"Alexander, why—"

"When did you learn about the baby?" His thumb brushed her cheekbone. "Why keep this from me?"

Evelyn froze, the glass trembling in her hands. She'd told him explicitly that stormy night. Watching her confusion, Alexander simply tucked the blankets around her.

"Rest now. We'll talk when you're stronger." His lips grazed her temple as he settled her back onto the pillows.

Tears spilled freely now. Had he remembered their childhood promise when she'd called him "Lex"? Or was this guilt over nearly losing their child?

The reason didn't matter. For this fleeting moment, Alexander finally saw her.

Reluctantly, Alexander left when his phone buzzed with urgent calls from Blackwood Enterprises. Approaching the elevators, Victoria's hushed voice stopped him cold.

"Doctor, are you certain?" Her shocked whisper carried down the corridor. "You mustn't tell Evelyn's husband about this!"
###Chapter 22

Alexander's expression darkened instantly.

He moved closer, spotting Evelyn with her back turned, deep in conversation with Victoria's physician.

"How could this happen? I never thought Sophia would go this far..." Evelyn's sigh carried through the hallway.

Though Alexander hadn't caught the full exchange, he stepped forward to demand answers. The doctor shifted uncomfortably before confessing, "Frankly, it violates my oath to deceive patients, but your sister's actions are unconscionable. She fabricated an entire pregnancy - even used theatrical blood to simulate complications. When confronted, she threatened suicide unless we corroborated her lies. Absolutely disgraceful behavior!"

Ice flooded Alexander's veins.

A complete fabrication?

Sophia's pregnancy was staged? Even the blood had been fake?

"I understand her motivations, but coercing medical professionals? That's beyond reckless!" Evelyn's voice trembled with apparent concern.

"You need to intervene," the doctor advised sternly. "Her husband will discover the truth eventually." He turned to leave.

Evelyn rushed after him. "Please, Doctor Hayes, keep this between us. If Alexander learns the truth, I fear what he might do to her."

The physician sighed. "Handle this family matter yourselves. Medically, she's perfectly healthy - dischargeable immediately."

"Thank you! Thank you so much!" Evelyn's gratitude echoed down the corridor.

As the doctor departed, Evelyn's face transformed - her earlier concern melting into calculated satisfaction.

"Sophia, you've crossed every line," she murmured. "Stealing my identity as Alexander's childhood sweetheart was one thing, but this pregnancy charade? Pathetic."

She spun around dramatically, gasping when she found Alexander mere feet away. "A-Alexander! How long have you been standing there?"

Alexander studied Evelyn's nervous fidgeting, his anger simmering beneath the surface. "You knew about this deception, yet chose to perpetuate it?"

Evelyn blinked rapidly, feigning confusion. "I don't understand what you mean. You must have misheard-"

"I heard every damning word," Alexander growled. "Stop lying to me."

Tears welled in Evelyn's eyes. "I would never deceive you, Alexander! You're misunderstanding-"

"The truth. Now." His voice could have frozen hell.

Evelyn crumpled, sobbing theatrically. "Fine! I lied to protect Sophia! If you knew the truth, you'd never forgive her!" She clutched his arm desperately. "Please don't confront her! She's learned her lesson!"

Her tears flowed freely now. "This is all my fault! I shouldn't have stayed at Blackwood Estate after your wedding. My presence drove her to this madness! And when I told her about our first meeting at Pinecrest Heights, she got this twisted idea to impersonate me as your childhood sweetheart. Punish me instead, Alexander! I'm the one to blame!"

Alexander's eyes turned obsidian.

Every moment had been a calculated lie.

Her entire persona - engineered to manipulate his emotions.

That gentle girl from his memories? She stood before him now - not the scheming viper in the hospital bed.

White-hot fury ignited in his chest as he recalled his tender treatment of Sophia moments earlier. He stormed back toward her room, ignoring Evelyn's frantic pleas. Behind him, her lips curled in triumph.

Sophia's eyes flew open when Alexander burst in, his expression murderous. "Alexander? What's-"

He advanced like death incarnate.

Before she could react, his hand closed around her throat.

"Alexander!" Sophia choked, her pale skin flushing crimson.

"Evelyn Sinclair," he hissed, "you've earned your death sentence." His glacial stare bored into her soul. "The pregnancy farce I might have forgiven. But stealing Victoria's identity? Did you truly believe you'd get away with this?"

Sophia's eyes widened in confusion, but the crushing pressure silenced her protests.

"You'll suffer for every lie," Alexander vowed.

With brutal force, he flung her across the room.

Sophia crashed against the bed frame, IV ripped from her arm. Gasping through the pain, she instinctively cradled her abdomen as she crawled toward him.

"Alexander, I swear I'm telling the truth!" She clutched his trousers desperately. "The pregnancy is real - take me for an ultrasound right now! Just this once, please believe me!"
###Chapter 23

A cold chuckle escaped Alexander's lips.

His dark eyes bore into Evelyn with icy contempt. "Evelyn, I underestimated your cunning." His voice dripped with venom. "Bribing doctors to lie about your pregnancy? Did you truly think I'd fall for such an obvious scheme?"

Tears streamed down Evelyn's face as she shook her head violently. "No! I would never lie about this, Alexander! Feel for yourself - our child is growing inside me!"

With desperate strength, she grabbed his hand, pressing it against her abdomen. "Please, just believe me this once!"

Alexander recoiled as if burned. "Don't soil me with your deceitful touch!" He glared at her with murderous intensity. "Even if that bastard were mine, I'd have it ripped from you. You're unworthy to carry a Blackwood heir."

"Alexander, wait!" Evelyn stumbled after him, clutching his arm. "You promised to protect me forever! I'm still your Lillian - doesn't that mean anything?"

At the mention of that name, Alexander's expression darkened dangerously. Before Evelyn could react, he shoved her violently to the floor. Pain radiated through her body as she curled protectively around her stomach.

Through her tears, she saw only cold hatred in his eyes. "You should have died years ago," he spat before turning away without a backward glance.

The hospital room door slammed shut with finality.

Evelyn lay trembling on the cold tiles, bitter laughter bubbling through her tears. 'The boy I loved is gone,' she realized. 'This cruel stranger wears his face.'

Days passed without word from Alexander. Evelyn's condition worsened despite bed rest. When Olivia finally insisted on specialist tests, the results were devastating.

"Miss Sinclair," Dr. Hayes said bluntly, "without terminating the pregnancy immediately, you won't survive the tumor's progression."

The world tilted violently. Only Olivia's steadying grip kept Evelyn upright. She'd known her illness was serious, but this...

"You can try again when you're healthy," Olivia urged, already arranging the procedure. But when she returned with the consent forms, Evelyn tore them to shreds.

"Evelyn!" Olivia gasped.

"I'd rather die than lose this child," Evelyn declared, her tear-filled eyes blazing with determination. The tumor would kill her regardless - this way, she'd leave part of herself behind.

A piece of Alexander that he could never erase.

Olivia pleaded with her to at least inform Alexander of her condition. But Evelyn merely turned toward the window, watching autumn leaves fall like her fading hopes.

Some promises, once broken, could never be remade.
###Chapter 24

Evelyn shook her head, a bitter smile twisting her lips.

What difference would it make if she told him?

Alexander wouldn’t care. To him, her death would be a relief.

But for the sake of the child growing inside her, she had to keep fighting.

The doctor’s words haunted her—the baby was fighting against her.

The more the little one grew, the worse Evelyn’s condition became. The tiny life nestled right above the tumor, pressing against it, accelerating its spread.

She had sent out countless job applications, all met with silence. Until finally, a small company responded.

They wanted her to design a pair of rings. The pay was decent.

She accepted without hesitation. Locked in her room for hours, she only emerged to grab a quick meal.

Three months pregnant, but the thick winter sweater hid the subtle curve of her belly.

Alexander hadn’t asked about her. Not once. She had grown used to the silence.

Then, the sound of footsteps at the front door shattered the quiet.

He was back.

Dressed in a sleek black leather jacket, he exuded an air of cold elegance, breathtaking as always.

In his hands were two shopping bags, adorned with cartoon prints. Children’s clothes.

Her heart leapt—until his icy voice cut through her hope.

"These are for Victoria."

The tenderness in his tone was reserved for her.

Evelyn’s fragile hope shattered instantly.

"You didn’t actually think these were for you, did you?" His mocking laugh was sharp as a blade. "As if I’d ever want a child with you."

The words crushed what was left of her heart.

She stared at his merciless face, pain twisting inside her. "Alexander, you’re cruel."

"Should I be kind to a woman like you?" His dark eyes raked over her pale face. "Do you even deserve kindness?"

With a cold chuckle, he turned and walked upstairs.

Evelyn watched his retreating figure, her lips trembling. Softly, she whispered to the empty room.

"If I’m truly so undeserving… then why did you make me that promise?"

Evelyn kept her hospital appointment. Her condition had worsened since the last check-up.

Olivia was frantic, begging her again to terminate the pregnancy. But Evelyn only smiled faintly. "Olivia… come somewhere with me."

The winter wind at the beach was brutal, slicing against their skin like knives.

Olivia didn’t understand why they were here—until Evelyn spoke, her voice barely above a whisper.

"If I don’t make it… promise me you’ll scatter my ashes in this sea."
###Chapter 25

Olivia gasped when she heard Evelyn's words. "Evelyn, Nathaniel, what in heaven's name are you talking about?"

"I mean every word." Evelyn's lips curved into a bittersweet smile. Her gaze drifted toward the endless ocean stretching before them, where waves of nostalgia crashed over her.

"This is where Alexander and I made our childhood promise," she murmured before correcting herself with a hollow laugh, "Or rather, where my foolish one-sided love story began."

Olivia's breath hitched. The realization dawned on her. "So this is Pinecrest Heights... where you first met."

Evelyn gave a slow nod, closing her eyes against the golden sunlight that painted her delicate features. "He told me that day, 'Lillian, when we grow up, I'll make you my bride.'"

Her voice cracked as she reopened her eyes. Silent tears traced paths down her pale cheeks like morning dew on rose petals.

Olivia's hands balled into fists. "Men are all the same! Alexander learned to deceive women before he could properly tie his shoes! And you—you fell for it!"

"I believed him completely," Evelyn whispered. "Not just believed—I staked my entire heart on it."

"Evie, you have to let him go. That man doesn't deserve an ounce of your love," Olivia pleaded, her chest tightening at her friend's devotion.

Yet Evelyn's smile remained, fragile as sea foam. "Twelve years, Liv. Twelve years I've loved him. How do I simply stop breathing?"

Her love had seeped into her bones, become the rhythm of her pulse.

How could she excise what had become her very essence?

"So you'd truly give your life for that man?" Olivia's voice turned sharp.

A sudden icy wind whipped between them, its chill piercing Evelyn's heart.

"If it means his happiness."

She'd been lost from the moment their childhood eyes first met across this very shore.

"Evie, I... I don't think I'll get to hold my baby." Evelyn bent to retrieve a seashell, her fingers trembling. The ocean's melody brought back Alexander's laughter, his promises. She smiled through fresh tears.

"No more chasing after him. Let him find happiness elsewhere. I'll be content too—with my baby. We'll sleep forever in these waves, cradled by the memory of when he loved me..."

Olivia studied Evelyn's face—the serenity there, the acceptance. It terrified her. What kind of love made death seem peaceful? What kind of man inspired such devotion while giving nothing in return?

After parting with Olivia, Evelyn returned to Blackwood Estate.

Nathaniel was waiting at the gates, his handsome face lined with worry. "Evie! Where have you been? I've called a dozen times!"

Evelyn's heart ached at his concern, but Alexander's cruel words echoed in her mind. Before she could respond, a familiar dark car pulled up.

Alexander emerged like a storm given human form, his all-black attire mirroring the darkness in his eyes. "Nathaniel Sterling. After all these years, still sniffing around my wife?"

His mocking tone dripped with venom.

Humiliation burned through Evelyn. She stepped between them. "Nathaniel and I are innocent. Mr. Blackwood, have some respect—for your wife and your former classmate."

The temperature seemed to drop ten degrees.

"Wife?" Alexander's laugh was jagged. "You remember that title now? Then why do I find you cozying up to your old flame at my doorstep?"

Exhaustion weighed Evelyn down. She wouldn't justify herself anymore—but she wouldn't let Nathaniel suffer. "Alexander!" Her voice shattered the twilight. "For the last time—there has only ever been you!"

The raw pain in her scream hung in the air as she fled inside.

Minutes later, Alexander followed.

His presence filled the foyer, dark and glacial.

Evelyn braced for another verbal assault. Instead, his voice came low and measured—more terrifying than any shout. "Evelyn. We need to talk."
###Chapter 26

Evelyn was taken aback by Alexander's cold demeanor. Yet she resisted the urge to fawn over him like before.

"What would you like to discuss, Mr. Blackwood?" she asked calmly.

Alexander's jaw tightened at her formal address. "Is that how you address your husband now?"

"Does it matter? You've never paid me any attention anyway, Mr. Blackwood."

His dark eyes narrowed. After a tense silence, he finally spoke. "Victoria's pregnancy is progressing. I intend to legitimize her position."

Though Evelyn had known this day would come, the words still struck like lightning.

She studied the icy man before her, letting out a bitter laugh. "And what about me?" The question hung heavy between them, making her unborn child feel like some cruel cosmic joke.

Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto her face. "If you behave, we can maintain our current arrangement."

Evelyn's laughter turned hysterical. "Are you suggesting your lawful wife become your mistress? While that scheming woman takes my place as Mrs. Blackwood?"

Alexander's expression darkened dangerously.

Pain lanced through Evelyn's chest. She bit her lip until she tasted blood. "Alexander, I swear on my life - Victoria will never have what's rightfully mine!"

With that, she fled upstairs, slamming the bedroom door behind her.

Her heart pounded violently. If she'd stayed a second longer, she might have begged him to stay.

Despite everything, part of her still longed to remain by his side. Even after all his betrayals.

Even after he'd shattered every promise he'd ever made.

Evelyn moved out immediately. She couldn't face Alexander again - not when he might shove divorce papers in her face. Not when he might demand she terminate her pregnancy for Victoria's sake.

Days passed without word from him. Clearly, he hadn't even noticed her absence.

He was probably with Victoria, building their perfect life together.

The thought made Evelyn's vision blur as she stared at the ring designs before her.

These were meant to be their wedding bands - a commission she'd secretly adapted for herself when she first fell for Alexander.

She'd imagined him slipping this very ring onto her finger. Now those dreams lay in ashes.

Wiping her tears, she tried to focus when the phone rang. The psychiatric hospital - her grandfather's home.

She arrived to devastating news: stage two lung cancer.

Treatable, but at a staggering cost.

"Henry, have some fruit," Evelyn offered gently, handing him sliced apples.

Though mentally ill, Henry remained kindhearted. "My sweet Eveline," he murmured, using her birth name - the only family heirloom she possessed.

Evelyn forced a smile. She'd always assumed she'd outlive her grandfather. Now fate seemed determined to take them both.

The treatment estimate made her blood run cold: $300,000.

The number squeezed her heart like a vice, each zero tightening the grip until she could barely breathe.

Where could she possibly get that kind of money?

The thought of losing Henry over something as trivial as money brought fresh tears. Yet the astronomical sum left her drowning in despair.

Until she remembered.

Alexander was her last hope.
###Chapter 27

Evelyn rushed to find Alexander without delay. The man looked as impeccably polished as ever, seated at his desk, engrossed in a stack of documents. He didn’t even glance up when she entered.

When she asked to borrow three hundred thousand dollars, he laughed—a cold, mocking sound that sent shivers down her spine.

"Evelyn, money means nothing to me," Alexander said, his voice dripping with disdain. "But I won’t give you a single cent."

Her fingers curled into fists, nails biting into her palms. "My grandfather has lung cancer. He needs treatment. Please, Alexander. I’ll pay you back—every penny."

"With what?" His smirk was cruel. Then, as if amused by her desperation, he added, "I’ll lend you the money—if you agree to my terms."

Her stomach twisted.

He wanted Victoria to take her place—to reduce her to nothing but his mistress.

Evelyn swallowed the lump in her throat. "Anything but that."

Alexander snapped his folder shut and stood, his gaze glacial. "Then you get nothing."

As he turned to leave, panic seized her. She grabbed his arm. "Please, Alexander. My grandfather will die without treatment!"

He chuckled darkly. "And why should I care?"

The words struck like a blade. The man before her was no longer the one she once loved—just a stranger with ice in his veins.

Her thoughts scattered as his fingers dug into her chin, forcing her to meet his merciless gaze. His aristocratic features were sharp, his eyes filled with nothing but scorn.

"Since you’re so desperate," he murmured, "sell yourself. With that face, three hundred thousand should be easy."

He shoved her away and strode off, leaving her trembling.

His words echoed in her skull, a relentless drumbeat of humiliation. The pain in her abdomen flared—her illness rearing its ugly head. She fumbled for her painkillers, swallowing one dry.

Tears burned, but she refused to let them fall.

He was right.

There was only one way left.

But she wouldn’t debase herself the way he expected.

Instead, she walked into the most exclusive nightclub in Willowbrook, a bottle of the finest champagne in hand. The manager had promised her a hundred-thousand-dollar commission if she sold it to the right client.

The VIP room was her target.

Her heart pounded as she pushed open the door—only to freeze.

Alexander lounged on the sofa like a king, his presence dominating the room. Beside him, Victoria smirked, her eyes gleaming with triumph.

Evelyn’s stomach lurched.

She turned to leave.

"Evelyn," Alexander drawled, his voice laced with amusement. "I didn’t think you’d actually stoop this low."

Her blood turned to ice.

Victoria gasped theatrically. "Evelyn! What are you doing here?"

Evelyn forced a brittle smile. "Unlike you, I’m here to work."

Victoria’s face twisted in fake concern. "You’re selling yourself? How disgraceful! If you needed money, you should’ve come to me!"

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the bottle.

She wouldn’t break.

Not here.

Not in front of them.
###Chapter 28

Selling Herself?

Evelyn had never mentioned selling her body, yet Victoria jumped to that conclusion instantly.

Alexander's piercing gaze darkened, his expression turning thunderous. He looked like a demon emerging from the abyss, ready to tear Evelyn apart with his bare hands.

She had really stooped this low.

She would sell herself to any man for money.

And yet, she had shamelessly claimed she had only ever been with him.

How pathetic.

"Evelyn, listen to me. Go home. If you don’t, Alexander will lose his temper. I won’t be able to stop him when that happens."

Victoria’s sickeningly sweet voice made Evelyn’s skin crawl.

She scoffed, amused. "Home? Do I even have one left? Or has it already been taken over by a shameless mistress like you?"

Victoria’s smile faltered, her lips twitching. She turned to Alexander with wounded eyes.

"Alexander, don’t be angry with Evelyn. It’s all my fault. I shouldn’t have fallen so hopelessly in love with you. This is all on me."

The act was nauseating, yet Alexander, as if blinded, pulled her into his arms.

"Don’t be ridiculous. How is any of this your fault? The one I’ve loved all along is you. The only person at fault here is this delusional woman who forced her way into my bed."

"The one I’ve loved all along is you."

Those words crushed Evelyn’s heart beneath an iron heel.

Since when had Victoria been the love of his life?

She distinctly remembered the boy who had once stood against the sunset, whispering to her, "Evelyn, meeting you was the luckiest thing to ever happen to me. You’re the one I love most."

The pain was unbearable—not just in her heart, but in the tumor that threatened to take her life at any moment.

She couldn’t stand to look at them any longer. But as she turned to leave, she collided with someone.

Dazed, she fumbled with the bottle in her hand. The expensive wine—worth millions—shattered on the floor with a deafening crash.

Evelyn paled.

Before she could react, a rough hand seized her wrist and yanked her away.

"Evelyn, it’s been a while."

The familiar, slimy voice sent a chill down her spine.

She looked up and met the revolting face of Dominic Fletcher—her former tormentor, the man who had once assaulted her while Victoria watched with a smirk.

Now, Victoria feigned shock. "Oh my, isn’t this Evelyn’s ex-boyfriend? I remember you used to stay over at her place all the time."

The air turned frigid.

Evelyn wanted to laugh. Since when had Dominic been her ex?

"Evelyn, it’s been too long. Since we’ve run into each other, why don’t we… rekindle things?" Dominic played along, his grin predatory as he yanked her against him.

Weak from pain, Evelyn couldn’t break free.

"Let go of me!" She struggled desperately.

"What’s wrong, Evelyn? You weren’t like this back then. Did I not pay you enough? A hundred wasn’t sufficient? How about two hundred this time?"

"Shut up! Dominic, shut your mouth! I don’t even—"

"Don’t pretend you don’t know me. We were very close. I still remember that mole on your left breast."
###Chapter 29

Before Evelyn could complete her sentence, Dominic cut her off sharply.

His fingers traced a distinctive birthmark on her collarbone, as if confirming some intimate knowledge from their past.

Victoria gasped dramatically, her hand flying to her mouth. "Oh my stars! Evie, isn't this your ex-lover? He paid you after every encounter? That's practically prostitution! How could you degrade yourself like this? Sleeping with any man who offers a few hundred dollars?"

Evelyn's stomach churned with disgust. She opened her mouth to defend herself when a searing pain from her tumor site stole her voice.

Her silence seemed like confession to Alexander.

First Nathaniel. Now Dominic.

Just how many men had this woman been with?

Alexander's jaw clenched, veins bulging at his temples as revulsion twisted his features.

"Alex, I can't believe Evie would do this." Victoria's voice trembled with faux concern. "I need some air. Let's go."

Alexander's glacial stare pinned Evelyn before allowing Victoria to lead him away.

"Alex... It's not..." The words died in Evelyn's throat as agony rendered her mute. She watched helplessly as Alexander's retreating figure disappeared, his final glance dripping with contempt.

He believed them. Believed she was some common whore selling herself for pocket change.

Dominic dragged Evelyn into a private lounge, his hungry gaze raking over her body. This was the opportunity he'd been waiting for.

When Evelyn tried to flee, he yanked her back violently. She crashed onto shattered glass, crimson blooming across her palms. The dual assault of physical pain and tumor agony left her trembling on the floor.

Memories surfaced of Alexander carrying her to safety when she'd cut her foot years ago. His whispered promise: "Lina, I'll always protect you."

Now she bled alone, abandoned.

The irony was almost funny.

Gritting her teeth, Evelyn crawled toward the door. Dominic easily hauled her back, tearing at her dress with greedy hands.

Just as hope faded, the door exploded inward.

Alexander took in the scene with one glance before snatching a wine bottle and smashing it over Dominic's skull.

The would-be rapist howled, clutching his bleeding head.

Alexander hauled Evelyn away, her bloodied hands leaving smears on his pristine suit.

Between the speeding car and Alexander's rough handling, Evelyn felt her body might rupture. He dragged her into their penthouse bathroom, shoving her into the tub before turning the water on full blast.

Evelyn thrashed as water filled her nose and mouth. "Alexander—"

"Impatient slut!" He gripped her neck, forcing her under again. "Couldn't wait one day before spreading your legs? And you dared claim I was your only man!"

The drowning was nothing compared to his words carving into her soul.

"You'll fuck strangers for chump change but play coy with me?" Alexander's laugh was cruel. "You make me sick."
###Chapter 30

"Evelyn, you sicken me."

His words struck like poisoned daggers, each one finding its mark in her already shattered heart.

He trusted Victoria's lies so completely that he wouldn't even let her speak in her own defense.

Icy water flooded her mouth and nose, dragging her under. For a moment, she stopped fighting.

Wouldn't death be easier than this torment?

But just as she surrendered to the darkness, Alexander hauled her up and flung her onto the floor.

Drenched and broken, she curled into herself like a discarded doll.

The tumor inside her burned with every breath, but she forced her head up.

"I don't know that man, Alexander. Why won't you believe me?"

"Why should I believe a viper like you?"

He seized her collar, his grip brutal. The mole on her left breast peeked through torn fabric.

The memory of Dominic's words twisted his expression into something cruel.

With a snarl, he ripped her clothes apart.

He was a storm of violence, punishing her without mercy.

Pain was all she knew.

His gaze terrified her—cold, merciless, devoid of anything human.

She gasped as his weight crushed her. "Alexander, stop—"

"Still playing innocent, Evelyn? Isn't this what you wanted?" His voice dripped with mockery.

When it was over, he threw a wad of cash at her face, treating her like a common whore.

Her blood turned to ice. But she stood, trembling. "I'm your wife."

He buttoned his shirt, disdain curling his lips. "A wife who spreads her legs for any man?"

Each word was a blade.

"If not for Victoria, you'd be rotting in a hospital bed."

Evelyn laughed, bitter and broken. "Right. That saint is the reason I'm like this."

Alexander whirled back. His fingers dug into her neck, yanking her close.

"Insult her again, and I'll make sure your grandfather never sees another doctor—no matter how much you beg."

Her heart plummeted.

He smirked at her fear. "Scared? Good. This is just the beginning, Evelyn. Cross me or Victoria again, and I'll destroy you."

With a final shove, he sent her crashing to the floor.

She didn't move. Pain held her captive.

But she couldn't give up. Not when Henry and Amelia needed her.

The next morning, Evelyn woke on the cold tiles. Her phone buzzed—the nightclub manager demanding payment for the ruined wine.

Broke and desperate, she signed a debt agreement.

Half a million dollars.

Add that to Henry's surgery fees, and the weight nearly crushed her.

But she had no choice. She finalized her ring designs, praying for quick payment, and took on cheaper commissions.

Then, a lifeline—a jewelry executive admired her work. They wanted a meeting.

She swallowed a painkiller, bracing herself.

The moment she stepped into the conference room, her breath caught.
###Chapter 31

The woman standing before me was the epitome of elegance—Eleanor Kingsley, a refined socialite from Willowbrook’s elite circles.

After a few interactions, Evelyn Sinclair had learned that Eleanor was also known as Mrs. Montgomery, one of the four most influential matriarchs in the city.

Strangely, Evelyn always felt an inexplicable warmth whenever she spoke with Eleanor.

The Montgomerys controlled vast assets, and Eleanor personally oversaw their jewelry empire.

She had been impressed with Evelyn’s initial design drafts.

Due to unforeseen circumstances, Eleanor had invited Evelyn to her home on the day the final designs were due.

Upon arrival, Evelyn realized it was no ordinary visit—today was Sophia Montgomery’s 24th birthday.

The realization struck her like a bolt. Today was her birthday too.

Watching Sophia, who had been coddled like royalty since birth, Evelyn couldn’t help the pang of envy that twisted inside her.

She had never known a parent’s love. And when fate finally granted her the chance to be a mother, it had been cruelly snatched away.

Her chest tightened, but she inhaled deeply and forced a smile.

None of that mattered now. She needed to earn $30,000 for her grandfather’s surgery.

Just as she moved to wish Sophia a happy birthday, a familiar figure stepped into view—Victoria Lancaster.

Dressed in a dazzling gown, her makeup flawless, Victoria clung to Sophia’s arm, snapping selfies with practiced ease.

Evelyn hadn’t expected them to be friends.

She turned to leave, but Victoria’s voice stopped her cold.

"Evelyn! I thought I was imagining things." Victoria’s tone dripped with false sweetness. "What are you doing here?"

Evelyn met her gaze icily. "None of your business."

Victoria’s lips curved into a smirk. "Oh, but it is my business. You’re my sister, and this is my best friend’s party. Everyone here is someone. What if you pull another stunt like last time? How would that reflect on me?"

Evelyn scoffed. "Sister? Please. I don’t recall having a sister who’d betray her own flesh and blood for a man."

Victoria’s smile faltered, her composure cracking.

Sophia sauntered over, head to toe in designer labels. Beside Evelyn’s modest attire, she shone like a diamond.

Her eyes flicked over Evelyn with disdain.

"Vicky, is this her? The shameless one?"

Evelyn stiffened. So, Victoria had been spreading poison about her.

Sophia smirked. "Vicky’s too kind. But honestly, how did trash like you get an invite?"

Evelyn held up her portfolio. "Your mother invited me, Miss Montgomery."

Sophia and Victoria exchanged startled glances.

Just then, Eleanor emerged. Sophia whispered something in her ear, and Evelyn saw the shift—the warmth in Eleanor’s eyes vanished, replaced by cold dismissal.

Still, Evelyn forced a polite smile. "Mrs. Montgomery, I’ve brought the final designs."

Eleanor’s voice was glacial. "Leave, Miss Sinclair. I won’t be needing your services. Keep the deposit—consider it compensation for your wasted time. But do not contact me again. I won’t have Montgomery Jewelry tainted by someone like you."
###Chapter 32

The moment those words reached Evelyn's ears, she knew it was over.

Humiliation and misunderstandings had never bothered her before. But this—this mattered too much.

"Designs? Evie, since when were you a designer?" Victoria's eyes widened in mock surprise. "Don't tell me you're copying from the internet again, just like you did for your graduation project. How far you've fallen." She sighed, shaking her head in exaggerated disappointment.

Eleanor Kingsley's expression darkened instantly. Without a word, she shot Evelyn a look of pure disgust before storming off with her daughter.

The pain in Evelyn's chest was sharp, like a blade twisting. She wanted to run after them, to explain—but a hand yanked her back.

Once they were alone, Victoria's lips curled into a vicious smirk. "See, you pathetic nobody? Did you really think you could compete with me for Alexander's heart?" She leaned in, voice dripping with malice. "You'll regret crossing me, Evelyn. Deeply."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the rejected sketches. The sight of Victoria's smug face made her snap. Before she could stop herself, her palm connected with Victoria's cheek—hard.

"Who knows what'll happen to me?" Evelyn hissed. "But right now? You've got my handprint on your face."

"Evelyn!" Victoria shrieked, clutching her cheek. "You bitch!"

Evelyn smirked coldly. "I'll slap you whenever I please. It's not like it's the first time. Go cry to Alexander—he loves your little performances."

Victoria's fingers trembled against her reddened cheek. She lunged, but Evelyn sidestepped effortlessly before turning on her heel and walking away.

She knew Victoria would run straight to Alexander. But she didn’t expect his call to come so soon.

"Blackwood Estate. Now."

His voice was deceptively calm. But Evelyn recognized the storm beneath it.

She hadn’t stepped foot in Blackwood Estate in months. The moment she entered, Richard and Margaret Montgomery glared at her like she was vermin.

Alexander sat on the sofa, an aura of icy rage around him. Victoria clung to his side, sobbing dramatically.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "Here I am, Mr. Blackwood," she said dryly. "Are you going to scold your wife for your mistress?"

Victoria's sobs halted abruptly. Alexander's gaze lifted, piercing through her.

"Evelyn," he said, voice dangerously low. "Did you forget my warning?"

"Alexander, it's fine," Victoria sniffled, placing a hand on his arm. "I don’t blame Evie. It's my fault for loving you when you're hers."

"Victoria, you foolish girl," Richard snapped, storming forward. "After everything she's done, you're still defending her? Look what she did to you!"

Evelyn finally noticed the exaggerated marks on Victoria's face. She'd only struck one cheek—yet both sides were swollen, with faint traces of blood at the corners of her lips.

Someone had enhanced the damage.

Evelyn scoffed. "If you know it's wrong, why keep clinging to my husband? Aren't you disgusted with yourself, Victoria?"

Victoria's face twitched, fury flashing in her eyes.

Evelyn almost smirked—until a brutal slap sent her stumbling.

Crack!

Richard's hand struck again before she could recover. The metallic tang of blood filled her mouth. A kick to her legs forced her to her knees.

She barely caught herself before Richard's shoe crushed her right hand under his heel.

"Was this the hand you used to hit my daughter?" he snarled.
###Chapter 33

A sharp gasp escaped Evelyn's lips as pain shot through her body. Richard was putting all his strength into torturing her, as if determined to shatter her bones. Then, she heard his arrogant justification.

"Alexander, don't think I'm being too harsh. As her father, I can't stand seeing my own daughter humiliated like this! Once Victoria gives birth, you'll understand how it feels to be a parent."

With that, he ground his shoe into the back of Evelyn's already injured hand. Fresh blood welled up from the cuts left by the shattered glass.

She didn't scream. She didn't beg.

Alexander remained silent, his handsome face carved from ice. To Evelyn, his silence was approval.

"Alexander, my face hurts," Victoria whimpered, pressing a delicate hand to her cheek. "What if the scars never fade?"

His expression darkened as he shot Evelyn a look of pure disgust. "She deserves worse."

Then, he pulled Victoria close, murmuring, "Don't worry, darling. I'll make sure you're as beautiful as ever. Let me take you upstairs to rest." His tender words coaxed a laugh from Victoria—and shattered what was left of Evelyn's heart.

"No, you should stay with Evelyn," Victoria said with false concern, pushing him away. "I don't want her to feel left out."

Alexander scoffed. "I couldn't care less if this witch dies of jealousy." He strode past Evelyn without a second glance.

Behind her, Richard lifted his foot and stomped down on her wrist—once, twice, three times. Evelyn clenched her teeth, her tear-filled eyes burning as she watched Alexander and Victoria ascend the stairs, arms wrapped around each other. The pain in her chest eclipsed the agony in her hand.

Once Alexander disappeared into the bedroom, Richard delivered a brutal kick to her shoulder.

"Consider this a warning! If you ever lay a finger on Victoria again, I'll have your hands chopped off. Now get out!"

Evelyn forced herself up, swaying but defiant. "If Victoria provokes me again, I'll do worse."

Richard froze, stunned by her audacity. Before he could react, Evelyn was already walking out the door.

As she stepped into the cold night, Margaret's shrill voice carried from inside. "Look at her! Why didn't you break her hand completely? Victoria said that bitch earns a living designing jewelry. Let's see how arrogant she is when she can't even hold a pencil!"

A light rain began to fall, icy against Evelyn's skin. Exhausted, she found herself outside the psychiatric hospital—the only place where she might find solace.

But tonight, she couldn't face Henry. She had failed him. She didn't have the money for his surgery.

As she entered, a nurse rushed toward her. "I was just about to call you! Your grandfather—he's gone!"

Evelyn's blood ran cold. "What do you mean?"

"He's missing!"

A mentally ill patient, vanished into the night. The possibilities terrified her.

She was about to call the police when her phone rang—an unknown number.

Her fingers trembled as she answered.

"Evelyn Sinclair," a rough voice growled. "Your grandfather is with me. Bring ten million dollars, or prepare his funeral."

"Don't hurt him! I-I don't have that kind of money!"

"You don't, but your husband does." The line went dead before she could respond.
###Chapter 34

Evelyn stood shivering in the icy downpour, the darkness swallowing everything around her.

Ten million dollars. An impossible sum for someone like her.

Despite being the wife of Willowbrook's wealthiest heir, she'd never benefited from that privilege. Instead, it had brought her nothing but pain and exhaustion.

Her fingers trembled as she clutched her phone. She couldn't risk calling the police - Henry's life hung in the balance.

There was only one person who could help now.

But Alexander's number rang endlessly. Had he blocked her after all?

The image of her grandfather suffering propelled her toward Blackwood Estate.

Her right hand throbbed where Richard had crushed it earlier, rendering it useless.

She knocked with her left fist. The door swung open, followed immediately by a torrent of freezing water.

"Get lost, you filthy wretch! If I'd known you'd hurt Victoria this badly, I'd never have let you marry into our family!" Margaret Dawson's venomous words cut through the storm as she slammed the door.

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh. The irony burned worse than the cold.

She'd donated her bone marrow to save Victoria years ago. This was her repayment.

Biting her lip until she tasted blood, she moved beneath Alexander's window.

Rain pelted her face like needles as she shouted upward. "Alexander! Please, for the sake of what we once had! My grandfather's been kidnapped - you're the only one who can help!"

Silence answered her desperate pleas.

Just as she turned to leave, the door creaked open.

Her heart leapt. "Alexander-"

"Alex is busy... showering in my room." Victoria's smug face appeared, her smirk twisting the fading bruises from earlier.

Evelyn's hope shattered. "This is life or death, Victoria. Let me speak to him."

"He said looking at trash like you makes him sick." Victoria leaned closer, rainwater dripping from her chin. "Didn't I warn you what happens to peasants who cross me?"

The realization struck like lightning. "You orchestrated this! You had my grandfather taken!"

Victoria's lips curled. "Just inviting the old man for tea."

"You vile creature! Face me directly instead of targeting an old man!" Rage ignited in Evelyn's chest.

She seized Victoria's collar, slapping her repeatedly across the face.

Victoria's screams pierced the night. "Alexander! Help me!"

But Evelyn didn't stop. Every injustice, every humiliation - she poured it all into those strikes.

The dam had finally broken.
###Chapter 35

"Why did I waste my bone marrow saving a monster like you?" Evelyn's voice trembled with rage. "Alexander must be blind to love someone as vile as you!"

Her palm connected with Victoria's cheek again and again. The commotion drew everyone in the mansion outside.

Margaret saw her daughter being struck and lunged at Evelyn, yanking her hair and kicking viciously. But Evelyn's grip on Victoria only tightened.

"Alexander! It hurts! Save me!" Victoria wailed dramatically. "She's going to kill me!"

The screams finally brought Alexander running.

"Evelyn, have you lost your mind?" He tore the hysterical woman away, immediately gathering Victoria into his protective embrace.

"Alexander, my face...it burns!" Victoria sniffled pitifully against his chest. "She's gone completely mad!"

Evelyn charged forward again. "Stop your pathetic act, Victoria! I should be the one crying! How did I ever cross paths with a snake like you?"

"Alexander, listen to her!" Margaret shrieked. "This witch dares attack Victoria right in front of you and still claims to be the victim! You should've divorced her years ago!"

Alexander's brows furrowed dangerously. His glacial gaze could have frozen hell itself.

"Evelyn." His voice was lethally quiet. "You keep pushing me. Do you have a death wish?"

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. Death was already coming for her. "Open your eyes, Alexander! Is that really a human you're holding, or a venomous creature?"

Slap! Margaret's palm cracked across Evelyn's face. "How dare you speak about Victoria that way!"

"She's worse than an animal!" Evelyn met Alexander's glare unflinchingly. "Do you know what your precious darling did? She kidnapped Henry and is demanding ten million from me!"

"Evelyn, what nonsense are you spouting?" Victoria's voice dripped with innocence. "Why would I do something so horrible? Even though he's not my blood relative, we're still sisters. I care about Henry too. Besides, what motive would I have?"

"Revenge! You want to destroy me completely!"

"That's absurd!" Victoria's eyes welled with crocodile tears. "Alexander, you must believe me. I'd never do such a thing. If I'm lying, may our baby be stillborn!"

"Victoria! Don't make such oaths because of this lunatic!" Margaret clutched her chest dramatically.

Victoria remained calm. "I'm not afraid because I speak the truth."

Evelyn's laugh was hollow. The true irony? Alexander believed every word.

He pulled Victoria closer, his icy stare piercing through Evelyn. "You claim Henry was kidnapped?"

"Yes!" Evelyn stood her ground. "She admitted it to me just moments ago!"

Without a word, Alexander pulled out his phone and called the hospital. He put it on speaker as he asked about Henry's status.

The nurse's cheerful voice rang out clearly. "Mr. Whitmore? He's sleeping peacefully in his room."

Each word struck Evelyn like a physical blow, freezing the blood in her veins.

She saw the frost deepen in Alexander's eyes. Instead of hanging up, he asked coldly, "What about his condition? The lung cancer diagnosis?"
###Chapter 36

When Alexander posed that question, Evelyn already knew what was coming.

The nurse on the other end of the line confirmed her suspicions. "Lung cancer? Aside from his mental health, his physical condition is perfectly fine. There's no way he has lung cancer. You must be mistaken."

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

Before Alexander could hang up, the nurse added, "You mentioned he's missing? He did disappear for a while before, but he said his niece told him to hide—that they were playing hide and seek."

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Everything clicked into place.

Her grandfather wasn’t sick. He wasn’t kidnapped. This was all Victoria’s doing.

"Evelyn, I see now." Victoria struck first, her voice trembling with fake tears. "You made your grandfather hide just to frame me for kidnapping him. How could you? I’ve always treated you like a sister!"

Margaret jumped in, her voice shrill. "You ungrateful wretch! After everything the Lancasters have done for you—raising you, paying for your education—this is how you repay us? First, you steal Victoria’s fiancé, and now you pull this despicable stunt?"

The two women hurled accusations at Evelyn, their words sharp as knives.

Evelyn felt hollow.

There was no point explaining. Victoria had set this trap perfectly.

Even if she screamed the truth until her voice gave out, the man standing before her would never believe her.

Still, she looked at Alexander, desperation in her eyes. "I don’t care if you believe me, but I didn’t do any of this."

Crack!

A sharp slap sent her head snapping to the side. The metallic tang of blood filled her mouth.

The pain burned, but it was nothing compared to the way Alexander was looking at her—like she was something vile.

"Evelyn, you’re not just cruel. You’re heartless. You’d curse your own grandfather and set up Victoria just to manipulate me. You must have a death wish."

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh.

Fool.

The man she loved was a blind fool.

"Alexander! My stomach—it hurts!" Victoria suddenly cried out, clutching her abdomen dramatically. "Our baby—something’s wrong!"

Margaret gasped. "That slap must have hurt the baby! Alexander, get her to the hospital now!"

His face darkened as he scooped Victoria into his arms. "Don’t worry. Our son will be fine."

Son.

He had already checked the baby’s gender with her.

Evelyn’s heart shattered. "She’s faking, Alexander! Are you really this blind?"

Thud!

Before she could react, Richard’s foot connected with her chest, sending her crashing into the nearby bushes. Jagged branches sliced into her palms, reopening old wounds.

She staggered to her feet, defiance in her eyes.

Then the metallic taste flooded her throat.

Blood spilled from her lips.
###Chapter 37

Alexander and Margaret gasped when they saw Evelyn coughing up blood, but their shock quickly twisted into satisfaction.

They slammed the door without hesitation, leaving Evelyn to her fate. Whether she lived or died meant nothing to them. In fact, they secretly wished for the latter.

Evelyn lay curled between the thorny bushes, her designer dress ruined by mud and rain. Clutching her cramping stomach, she watched through blurred vision as Alexander carried Victoria to his luxury car.

The rearview mirror reflected her broken form, yet he deliberately looked away.

Victoria, however, met Evelyn's gaze through the rain-streaked window. A triumphant smirk played on her lips as she took in Evelyn's ghostly pallor and bloodstained mouth.

Evelyn's outstretched hand dropped limply to the ground as the car sped away.

Tears mixed with rainwater on her cheeks, creating bitter rivers down her face.

He'd been so concerned about Victoria's pregnancy, yet showed no mercy toward the life growing inside Evelyn. He'd even tried to kill their unborn child.

A hollow laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. How tragically ironic her existence had become.

When had her life spiraled into this nightmare? Probably the moment she'd foolishly fallen for a man who was never meant to be hers.

Three days passed in the sterile hospital room. Though battered inside and out, Evelyn's baby had miraculously survived.

Not a single visitor came. Only Nathaniel called, his voice laced with concern she couldn't fully conceal. Evelyn brushed off his questions, determined not to drag him deeper into Alexander's wrath.

At her discharge, the doctor delivered devastating news: "Given your condition, terminating the pregnancy for tumor removal isn't an option."

Evelyn accepted this with eerie calm, her lips curving into a serene smile.

Stepping outside, the winter sun cast golden rays across her gaunt face. Yet no warmth reached her frozen heart—not when memories of Alexander's cruelty had left it shattered, letting icy winds howl through the cracks.

As she headed toward the bus stop, movement near the hospital's side entrance caught her eye. Eleanor Kingsley stood there with her husband William, their expressions grave.

Despite Eleanor's coldness toward her—poisoned by Victoria's lies—Evelyn still found comfort in the woman's familiar features.

Eleanor clutched her chest in visible distress, murmuring about hospitals, birthmarks, and daughters.

Assuming they discussed Sophia, Evelyn turned to leave quietly.

At that moment, Victoria stormed out of the hospital, cursing under her breath. She'd come specifically to torment Evelyn during Alexander's absence, only to learn her rival had already left.

Spotting Eleanor and William, Victoria instantly transformed into her sweet facade. Then she froze, overhearing Eleanor's tearful confession: "Where could our real daughter be? William, we must never tell Sophia she's not our biological child."

William embraced his wife firmly. "Don't worry. We'll find her. No other twenty-four-year-old in Willowbrook has that distinctive butterfly birthmark on her lower back."

Victoria's blood ran cold.

Sophia wasn't their real daughter? That pleased her immensely. But the birthmark detail...

She remembered with chilling clarity—Evelyn bore an identical butterfly mark on her left hip. And both women shared the same birthday. They were the same age.

The implications hit Victoria like a thunderbolt.
###Chapter 38

Evelyn returned to Blackwood Estate with heavy steps. She intended to gather her belongings and leave immediately. But when her gaze fell upon the tiny baby outfits draped over the armchair, her hands moved of their own accord.

The soft fabric crumpled between her fingers as an unbearable ache spread through her chest. These were the clothes Alexander had personally selected for Victoria's unborn child.

Her palm pressed against her own three-month bump. Hot tears threatened to spill, but she blinked them away fiercely.

How pathetic she was. After all the cruelty he'd shown her, her treacherous heart still yearned for that impossible love.

Evelyn grabbed one set of baby clothes and descended the grand staircase. The universe seemed to mock her when she collided with Alexander and Victoria at the foyer.

The sight of Victoria clinging to Alexander's arm sent a thousand needles piercing through Evelyn's heart.

"Evelyn, where are you off to?" Victoria fluttered her lashes with fake concern. Her eyes zeroed in on the tiny garment. "Oh! Did you go shopping for my baby? How thoughtful of you!"

Evelyn had never encountered a mistress with such audacity.

Her lips curled in disgust. "You flaunt your pregnancy with a married man like it's some achievement. Your shamelessness knows no bounds."

Victoria's face crumpled. She turned watery eyes toward Alexander. "Maybe I should go home. Evelyn's jealousy is getting dangerous. I don't care if she hurts me, but our baby—"

The innocent act was transparent, designed solely to provoke Alexander's wrath.

"You're not the one leaving." Alexander's glacial stare pinned Evelyn in place. "Get out. And stay out of Victoria's sight." His gaze dropped to the baby clothes in her hands. "Those are for my child with Victoria. How dare you touch them? Don't you know how contaminated you are? My son won't wear anything tainted by your filth."

Filth. His son.

The words carved fresh wounds in Evelyn's shattered heart. She searched the face she'd loved for twelve years and found only hatred.

"Alexander, why do you despise me so? Just because I begged for your touch? Is that why I repulse you now? But that night—"

"Evelyn," Victoria interrupted sweetly, stepping forward with fake concern. "Can you blame Alexander? He has standards. After all those men you slept with for money—"

A bitter laugh caught in Evelyn's throat. Every saccharine word from Victoria dripped with venom, yet Alexander swallowed them whole.

His expression darkened as he pulled Victoria back. "Don't soil yourself touching her. Let's go upstairs."

As they turned away, Victoria shot Evelyn a triumphant smirk over her shoulder. The knife twisted deeper.

Evelyn knew then—no matter what she did, Alexander's contempt would follow her like a shadow.

She forced herself to focus on survival. On protecting the life growing inside her. There was still hope if she could just hold on until delivery.

The next day, Evelyn transferred Henry to a different hospital. The previous nurse had clearly been in Victoria's pocket.

After ensuring her grandfather's comfort, she found herself pausing outside an upscale baby boutique.

Two tiny outfits—one powder blue, one blush pink—ended up in her shopping bag. Just in case.
###Chapter 39

The gender-neutral baby clothes in Evelyn's hands would suit her unborn child perfectly, regardless of whether it was a boy or girl.

She was just about to make the purchase when she turned and locked eyes with Victoria across the boutique.

Standing alone by the cashier, Victoria wore that familiar venomous smirk. Evelyn attempted to walk past her, but Victoria blocked her path.

"Evie darling, shopping while the police hunt for you?" Victoria's sickly sweet voice dripped with mock concern. "That plagiarism lawsuit from Minora must be weighing heavily. Intellectual property theft carries such serious penalties these days."

Evelyn's brow furrowed in confusion. Minora was the company that had commissioned her original ring designs. There was no possible way this could be plagiarism.

"Stop spreading lies, Victoria. You're destroying my professional reputation with these baseless accusations."

"Oh Evie," Victoria sighed dramatically, "we both know this isn't your first time stealing what isn't yours."

Evelyn refused to engage further. She'd learned the hard way that every interaction with Victoria was a potential trap. But as she turned to leave, Victoria grabbed her wrist with surprising strength.

"Please don't hurt my baby!" Victoria suddenly wailed, her voice carrying through the entire store. "Take your anger out on me, but spare my innocent child!"

The scene unfolded with sickening familiarity. Before Evelyn could react, Victoria violently yanked her hand forward while throwing herself backward onto the floor.

A piercing scream echoed through the boutique. The sickening thud of Victoria's body hitting the ground was followed by gasps from horrified shoppers.

Right on cue, Alexander appeared in the doorway. His gaze immediately locked onto Victoria writhing in pain, the growing pool of blood beneath her.

"You monster!" Victoria shrieked, tears streaming down her face. "First you steal Alexander, now you try to murder my baby! I'm your own sister!"

Alexander's face twisted with fury as he gathered Victoria into his arms. "Evelyn, if my child dies, I'll make sure you never see the light of day again."

A bone-chilling dread crept up Evelyn's spine as Alexander rushed out with Victoria. She barely had time to process what happened before two officers blocked her exit.

The nightmare was repeating itself. Memories of her last arrest - the beatings that nearly cost her unborn child's life - flooded back. She couldn't go through that again. Not when she was so close to meeting her baby.

"I didn't push her! It was a setup!" Evelyn's voice cracked with desperation.

But the condemning stares from every direction told her no one believed her. The click of handcuffs sealed her fate as officers led her to the waiting squad car.
###Chapter 40

Evelyn remained confined in the detention cell. After two agonizing days, she finally faced Alexander again.

The interrogation room looked identical to before. But Evelyn appeared more broken than ever. In stark contrast, the man before her radiated even darker fury than their last encounter.

He moved like a wrathful deity descending upon earth. The moment the door clicked shut, Alexander seized Evelyn's collar, his glacial stare piercing through her like shards of ice.

"Evelyn Sinclair," he hissed, his breath hot against her bruised face. "How difficult is it to simply disappear? Must you insist on courting death at every turn?"

"Alexander, I swear I didn't push her!" Evelyn's voice cracked with desperation. "Victoria deliberately grabbed my arm and then let go! Check the security footage from that boutique! You'll see the truth!"

Alexander's lips twisted into a cruel smile. He tapped his phone screen and shoved it in her face. "The truth is right here. The footage clearly shows you shoving Victoria."

Evelyn's blood ran cold. The angle did make it appear as though she'd pushed Victoria. Her stomach churned as she realized how perfectly the trap had been set.

"Victoria lost the baby," Alexander spat, his voice trembling with barely contained rage. "Are you satisfied now?"

The words hit Evelyn like a physical blow. She instinctively clutched her own stomach, a wave of nausea washing over her.

"Alexander, please," she begged, tears streaming down her face. "I didn't push her - not this time, not last time. These are all her schemes! She's framing me!"

A dark chuckle escaped Alexander's lips. "Even now, with my child dead because of you, you dare accuse Victoria?" His fingers tightened around her throat. "You're truly the most vile, despicable creature I've ever encountered."

Every word dripped with venom. Evelyn could practically taste his hatred.

"Not content with harming Victoria, you even stooped to plagiarism to swindle money." Alexander released her with a shove. "Enjoy your last sunset, Evelyn. By tomorrow, you'll be begging for death."

As he turned to leave, Evelyn lunged forward, grabbing his ankle. "Alexander, I'm carrying your child too!" she sobbed.

"Then may that bastard in your womb keep my dead child company in hell," he snarled, kicking her hand away.

Evelyn collapsed onto the concrete floor, her body wracked with sobs. The December chill seeped through her thin clothes, but nothing compared to the ice spreading through her veins from Alexander's words.

Tears blurred her vision as she curled into a fetal position. People spoke of happiness being like autumn leaves - some gathered more, some less. But Evelyn had never even been allowed to touch a single leaf.

The verdict came swiftly.

Plagiarism. Assault resulting in miscarriage. Multiple charges stacked against her with no legal representation.

Three years in prison. The judge's gavel fell with finality, sealing Evelyn's fate.
###Chapter 41

The appeal had failed.

Evelyn Sinclair had no choice but to accept this cruel, unjust fate.

Three years.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

Would she even live long enough to hold her child?

She hadn’t told the prison guards about her pregnancy. Not after what happened the last time.

The memory of their fists slamming into her still haunted her.

But the nightmare wasn’t over.

That night, a group of inmates—bald, brutal, and merciless—cornered her.

Too weak to fight back, Evelyn could only curl into herself, shielding her stomach as the blows rained down.

The tumor gnawed at her insides, sending waves of agony through her body.

She trembled, teeth clenched, praying they wouldn’t strike where it mattered most.

This wasn’t the first time.

She had reported it.

No one cared.

Every night, pain was her only companion.

Only the thought of the life growing inside her kept her from breaking.

Alexander, you heartless monster.

I spent twelve years dreaming of the day we’d reunite. But I was the only one who cared.

Nathaniel Sterling had sent medicine to ease her suffering.

But her body was failing.

Some days, she wasn’t sure she could hold on.

But she had to.

For her child.

The only light in her dark, crumbling world.

Ten months.

So close.

She had to survive.

Then came the storm.

Thunder cracked across the sky, shaking the prison walls.

Evelyn’s heart pounded.

She knew what was coming.

The inmates had been watching her.

Waiting.

They didn’t just beat her this time.

They pinned her down.

Hands trapped.

Legs forced apart.

Panic surged through her.

She knew what they intended to do.

No. Not my baby.

She thrashed, screaming.

They ignored her.

Pain exploded in her abdomen.

A wet warmth spread beneath her.

Her water had broken.

No, no, no—

"Please! Don’t hurt my child!"

Tears and sweat soaked her clothes.

The agony was unbearable.

Like her body was being torn in half.

She blacked out.

Came back.

Blacked out again.

Then—

A cry.

Sharp. Piercing.

Alive.

"My baby—" she gasped.

"Give me my baby!"

"Mr. Blackwood’s orders," one of them sneered. "Your bastard child pays for the one his precious Victoria lost."

Victoria.

His orders.

Evelyn’s eyes fluttered shut.

Tears slipped free.

Their child—buried beside the one Victoria had with another man.

Was this revenge?

Or just another cruel joke?

Morning came.

Evelyn dragged herself up, every movement fire.

She found a guard.

"Last night," she rasped, "they forced me into labor. They took my baby."

The guard blinked.

"You were pregnant?"
###Chapter 42

The officer's question sent chills down Evelyn's spine. A horrifying realization dawned upon her.

This had been meticulously planned from the beginning. Everyone was involved.

All this suffering stemmed from loving a man she should have never met.

Evelyn clutched the cold prison bars desperately, sinking to her knees.

'Alexander Blackwood, if given another chance, I wish our paths had never crossed...'

Evelyn never expected to survive until her release day.

Perhaps the experimental medication Nathaniel arranged had miraculous effects on tumors.

Or maybe it was her burning desire to find the child stolen during her forced delivery. Somehow, she defied death.

Sunlight bathed the prison gates on her release day. Yet no warmth could melt the icy pain encasing her heart for three years.

The physical and emotional scars from those thousand nights remained etched across her body, permanent reminders of her torment.

Olivia rushed forward, gasping at Evelyn's emaciated frame. She pulled the hollow-eyed woman into a fierce embrace. "Eve, I've got you now. You'll never face anything alone again."

A fragile hope flickered in Evelyn's chest. Someone still cared.

Nathaniel's expression darkened seeing Evelyn's gaunt face. Guilt twisted his features.

He kept apologizing profusely. If only he hadn't been overseas during her trial, he could have protected her.

At least provided proper legal defense.

Evelyn shook her head at his remorse. "Nate, stop. You owe me nothing. Thank you for everything."

'The real debtors are that venomous snake Victoria Lancaster, and the heartless man I wasted twelve years loving.'

After settling in, Nathaniel took Evelyn to see Dr. Hayes for comprehensive tests.

Reviewing the results, Benjamin's eyebrows shot up. "I never expected my experimental treatment could halt tumor progression so effectively."

"Can she undergo surgery now?" Nathaniel pressed urgently, concern lacing every word.

Benjamin frowned. "Too risky currently. Continue medication while we monitor. We'll reassess."

Though disappointed, Evelyn felt grateful. "Thank you, Doctor. Thank you, Nate. Without you both, I wouldn't be here. Every extra day feels like a gift."

"Don't talk like that." Nathaniel gripped her shoulders firmly, intensity burning in his gaze. "Eve, I won't lose you."

His unspoken affection shimmered clearly in that moment.

Nathaniel was extraordinary - wealthy, handsome, kind-hearted.

Such a man deserved better than a divorced ex-convict with a death sentence.

She couldn't burden him.

Olivia insisted on taking Evelyn to a luxury salon afterward, declaring she needed "a fresh start transformation."

Too drained to protest, Evelyn complied.

Staring blankly at the mirror, she watched strands of her damaged hair fall away like her shattered illusions.

Each snip severed another memory of Alexander - their beachside promises, whispered dreams.

Everything ended when he authorized their child's kidnapping. No going back.

Hours later, Olivia gasped at Evelyn's transformation. "My God, Eve! You should be modeling, not wasting that face!"

Evelyn barely registered her reflection. The short-haired stranger staring back felt alien yet fitting - a visual representation of her rebirth.
###Chapter 43

The morning sun cast golden rays through Evelyn Sinclair's window as she prepared for the day. She carefully selected fresh fruits and Henry Whitmore's favorite almond cookies before heading to Willowbrook General Hospital.

Her footsteps echoed through the sterile hallway as she approached her grandfather's room. The empty bed greeted her, sheets neatly tucked with no sign of recent occupation.

At the nurse's station, a woman with sharp features looked up. "You're Mr. Whitmore's granddaughter?" Her lips curled in a sneer. "He passed three years ago. The funeral home has his ashes."

The paper bag slipped from Evelyn's trembling fingers. Oranges rolled across the linoleum floor.

Her breath caught. The world tilted. Three years. Gone. Without a final goodbye.

The crushing weight pressed against her chest until breathing became painful. She stumbled outside, the winter drizzle mixing with hot tears on her cheeks.

At the funeral home, she cradled the simple urn. Olivia Bennett found her kneeling in the rain, clutching the vessel like a lifeline. "Evelyn, darling," Olivia whispered, wrapping her in a warm embrace.

Together, they arranged a proper burial in Maplewood Cemetery. The freshly turned earth smelled of damp soil and regret.

Back at the hospital, Evelyn demanded answers. "Natural causes," the nurse shrugged, avoiding eye contact.

Natural? Henry Whitmore had been the picture of health when she last saw him. Something wasn't right.

Among his belongings, she discovered a delicate gold pendant shaped like a butterfly. The name 'Evelyn' glimmered in delicate script. She fastened it around her neck, its weight both comforting and heartbreaking.

Three years lost. Three years stolen.

Job hunting proved difficult with a prison record. At Blackwood Enterprises' gleaming headquarters, fate intervened.

Victoria Lancaster emerged from a chauffeured Bentley, designer heels clicking on marble. Recognition burned through Evelyn like wildfire.

"Can you believe it?" A receptionist gushed nearby. "Victoria Lancaster - from nobody to Montgomery heiress overnight. And now engaged to Alexander Blackwood! She even gave him a son!"

The words struck like physical blows. Victoria wasn't a Crawford at all, but Eleanor Kingsley's long-lost daughter.

The interview passed in a blur. Evelyn got the position, but her mind reeled with questions. That evening, she scoured social media.

Victoria's profile displayed a cherubic toddler with Alexander's piercing eyes and stubborn chin. The caption read: "My little prince, Ethan, two years old today."

The timeline didn't add up. If they'd waited three years to marry, why did their child look exactly two? The math gnawed at Evelyn's thoughts like persistent rats.

Something was terribly wrong. And she would uncover the truth, no matter the cost.
###Chapter 44

Evelyn's heart shattered into a million pieces.

No physical wound could ever compare to this soul-crushing agony.

She would forever remember that horrific night. The night she was violently dragged into labor, her newborn ripped from her arms.

To this day, she didn't know if her baby was a boy or girl. Would the child have her emerald eyes or Alexander's piercing gaze?

Scrolling through Victoria's Instagram, Evelyn's fingers trembled. The feed overflowed with designer handbags, luxury cars, and smug posts about her influential biological parents. Most gut-wrenching were the photos of Victoria cradling Ethan - the son she shared with Alexander.

This monster had stolen everything.

While Evelyn had nothing left.

The irony burned like acid.

Several times, Evelyn considered confronting Alexander. But prison's lingering trauma froze her each time.

Yet thoughts of her missing child propelled her forward.

Standing before Blackwood Estate - the mansion she once ruled - bitterness flooded her mouth. As she reached for the bell, the doors swung open.

Victoria strutted out in a couture dress, radiating arrogance. Spotting Evelyn, she paused mid-step, shock flashing before morphing into a venomous smile.

"Well, well. If it isn't my dear stepsister." Victoria's stilettos clicked closer. "Finished your prison rehabilitation already?"

Evelyn's stomach churned at her smirk. "Where's my child?" No pleasantries. Just raw demand.

Victoria's expression darkened before twisting into something predatory. "Your child?"

"Yes! My baby! Give them back!"

"That bastard?" Victoria shrugged. "Alexander buried it with my miscarried fetus."

The world went black. Evelyn's heart split open, bleeding agony.

She lunged, fingers digging into Victoria's designer collar. "Lies! My child's alive! I want Alexander! Now!"

"Get your filthy hands off me!" Victoria shrieked. "Security!"

Evelyn barely registered the blow before darkness swallowed her.

Cold water slapped her awake. Victoria loomed over her, smirking. "Three years in prison taught you nothing, did you?" Her manicured nail jabbed Evelyn's abdomen. "That tumor growing inside you? It'll kill you soon." Her laugh curdled blood. "Boys? Aim for her stomach."

Fists rained down. Evelyn curled into herself, but the blows kept coming. The physical pain paled against Victoria's words echoing in her skull.

My baby...
###Chapter 45

Tears blurred Evelyn's vision.

She couldn't believe Alexander could be so heartless.

That child had been full of life. Could he truly have done something so monstrous?

Victoria yanked Evelyn's short hair with vicious force, her nails digging into her scalp. Staring down at Evelyn's bare, still-beautiful face, jealousy twisted Victoria's features. "Look at you, Evelyn. Pathetic. I'm the one who's Miss Montgomery now. Soon, I'll be Mrs. Blackwood. What can you possibly do against me?"

With a cruel smirk, she kicked Evelyn, who was too weak to fight back. "You wanted your child back, didn't you?"

Evelyn's breath hitched. Through her tear-filled gaze, she saw Victoria holding a small glass jar—no bigger than her fist—filled with a fine white powder.

"Here's your child."

What?

The words struck Evelyn like a blade. Her blood turned to ice. Her flesh seemed to wither away, leaving only hollow bones behind.

Darkness threatened to swallow her vision, but Victoria's mocking voice cut through the haze. "Such a shame. A newborn, plump and perfect—flesh and blood one moment, nothing but ashes the next."

She tilted the jar, letting the powder shift inside. "Alexander said the bastard deserved it. After all, you kept upsetting me."

A cruel laugh escaped her lips. "Oh, did you know? It was a girl. But Alexander didn’t even glance at her before ordering her disposal."

Her fingers loosened. "Since you want her so badly… here."

The jar shattered against the floor.

Ashes scattered across the tiles, some landing on Evelyn's face, her trembling hands.

Her scream tore through the room—raw, guttural, filled with agony. Blood stained her teeth from the beating, her body battered, her soul shattered.

Alexander reached the door just as that harrowing cry pierced the air.

His chest tightened inexplicably.

Inside, a woman knelt on the ground, desperately clawing at the powdery remains, her movements frantic, unhinged.

When she lifted her head, his breath caught.

Evelyn.

Bruised. Bloodied. But her eyes—those clear, defiant eyes—locked onto his with unbearable accusation.

Before he could react, she lunged at him, her ash-covered hands gripping his collar. "Alexander! How could you? She was ours! How could you be so cruel?"

He stared at her, stunned. His voice came out cold, detached. "What child? Evelyn, have you lost your mind?"

Victoria stepped forward, feigning distress. "Alexander, I didn’t mean to hurt her like this. But when I think of our lost child… I just—I couldn’t control myself."

Alexander's gaze flickered between them.

Evelyn's grip tightened, her voice breaking. "Liar! She was alive! You killed her!"

Victoria's lips curled in triumph.

And Alexander—for the first time—hesitated.
###Chapter 46

Each syllable from Alexander's lips felt like shards of glass tearing through Evelyn's raw wounds. The agony was so profound it rendered her entire body numb.

"Ha..." Evelyn's bitter laugh echoed hollowly.

She finally understood the depths of his cruelty - he'd erased every trace of their child's existence.

He'd willingly crushed their baby's bones to dust for that venomous serpent, Victoria.

Evelyn believed her heart had turned to stone. She thought she'd become incapable of feeling pain.

Yet one encounter with that man made every scar ignite with fresh torment.

"Alexander, I never imagined Evelyn would come after me the moment she left prison," Victoria whimpered, pressing against his chest. "I'm terrified she'll harm our baby again. She already murdered our first child. I can't endure that nightmare twice."

Her words dripped with false innocence, expertly stoking the flames of Alexander's rage.

Just as intended, his dark eyes burned with malice as they locked onto Evelyn. "Three years wasn't enough for you? If you're craving another prison sentence, just say so. But if I catch you near Victoria again..."

His violent shove sent Evelyn crashing to the floor, her body wracked with pain. His protective stance over Victoria spoke volumes - his devotion had only intensified.

Memories of those thousand torturous nights in prison made Evelyn's pulse race. She couldn't return to that hell.

Clenching her fists until her nails drew blood, Evelyn felt something shift inside her. The love in her eyes transformed into something darker.

She despised this.

She loathed every wicked scheme Victoria concocted. She abhorred Alexander's heartless brutality. Most of all, she hated how he enabled Victoria's atrocities again and again.

Why should her precious Amelia pay for Victoria's sins?

Victoria was the one who deserved death!

"Darling, we should go," Victoria cooed, entwining her fingers with Alexander's. "Today's our sweet Ethan's second birthday. We mustn't keep your parents waiting."

The knife twisted deeper in Evelyn's heart.

How cruelly ironic.

Today would have been Amelia's second birthday too - the daughter they'd mercilessly slaughtered.

Watching their retreating figures, Evelyn felt needles piercing her eyes.

What kind of monster had she loved all these years?

Those youthful promises had become poisonous illusions. It was time to wake from this nightmare.

Later, Evelyn erected a small memorial beside her grandfather Henry's grave for her lost child.

When Olivia learned what happened, she grabbed a kitchen knife, ready to confront Alexander and Victoria. Evelyn stopped her with a trembling hand.

Who was Alexander Blackwood? In all of Willowbrook, who dared challenge the most powerful man in the city?
###Chapter 47

Evelyn Sinclair had once been among the elite socialites of Willowbrook's four prominent families. Crossing her path now could mean losing their foothold in this city.

She couldn't let Olivia Bennett suffer consequences because of her.

After reliving her painful memories, Evelyn resolved to rebuild her life from scratch.

Only by rising from the ashes could she seek justice for herself and her lost child.

Two mornings later, Evelyn arrived at her new workplace.

The fading bruises on her face required careful concealing before she stepped into the office.

Before she could settle at her desk, Isabella Martinez—her direct supervisor—summoned her immediately.

Isabella embodied corporate power in her designer ensemble, her striking beauty overshadowed only by her permanent scowl. The intimidating presence made Evelyn's palms sweat, fearing she'd fail her probation period.

Yet Isabella spoke with unexpected courtesy, assuring Evelyn she could take things slowly without pressure.

Evelyn almost believed in her supervisor's kindness—until lunchtime.

In the cafeteria, she spotted Isabella surrounded by female colleagues, her lips curled in disdain.

"That Evelyn is utterly incompetent. If the higher-ups hadn't forced me to hire her, I wouldn't tolerate her presence." Evelyn's pulse quickened.

Which executive had ordered her hiring? She remembered seeing Victoria Lancaster outside the building earlier. Was this company part of the Montgomery empire?

"A convicted felon, former escort, and plagiarist in our department? Disgusting! How dare they let her touch our designs?" Isabella's venomous tone contrasted sharply with her earlier professionalism.

The confirmation struck Evelyn like a physical blow. Only Victoria would orchestrate such humiliation.

Alexander Blackwood might be cruel, but he'd never stoop to such petty games.

Having endured worse betrayals, Evelyn remained composed as she approached the gossiping group.

Two women noticed her first, exchanging panicked glances, but Isabella continued unabated.

"I heard that gold-digger drugged Mr. Blackwood to trap him. Only a professional whore would—"

The sudden silence made Isabella turn. Her smirk faltered upon seeing Evelyn.

"Finished your tasks?" Isabella snapped. "Why are you lurking like some ghost?"

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. "Just admiring how effortlessly you switch masks. Do you badmouth these ladies too when they're not around?"

The cafeteria fell silent as colleagues turned to watch.

Isabella shot up, face mottled with rage. "Do you want to keep this job or not?"

With deliberate calm, Evelyn removed her access badge and flung it at Isabella's face. "Not anymore."

"You—" Isabella sputtered, finger trembling as she pointed.

Evelyn turned away—and froze.

Victoria stood at the entrance with Eleanor Kingsley.

While Victoria only fueled her anger, Eleanor's presence inexplicably tugged at Evelyn's heartstrings.

Yet Eleanor's gaze held only contempt.

The unexpected pain made Evelyn quicken her steps, but Victoria blocked her exit.

"Evelyn, don't be difficult," Victoria purred. "I convinced Mother to give you this chance. Don't throw it away like a spoiled child."
###Chapter 48

The truth was crystal clear now. Evelyn Sinclair had landed this position so effortlessly because Victoria Lancaster had pulled strings behind the scenes.

But Evelyn wasn't naive. Since when had Victoria ever shown her kindness?

"Drop the act. You might not feel disgusted, but I certainly do." Evelyn slapped away Victoria's outstretched hand with visible contempt.

Victoria swayed dramatically, playing the fragile victim as she collapsed against Eleanor Kingsley's shoulder.

Eleanor's maternal instincts flared at seeing her precious daughter slighted. She stormed toward Evelyn, shielding Victoria protectively behind her.

"Evelyn Sinclair, recognize the favor being done for you! If not for Victoria's pleading, someone like you would never set foot in Blackwood Enterprises!" Eleanor's voice trembled with outrage.

"Despite not being blood sisters, Victoria never retaliated against your constant bullying. She even secured this opportunity for you. And this is how you repay her kindness?"

That tired phrase again.

Evelyn felt she might need to rewrite the dictionary definition of "kindness."

What benevolence had Victoria ever shown her? Only endless suffering and pain.

Watching Eleanor defend Victoria while chastising her sent fresh stabs of agony through Evelyn's heart.

"It's alright, Mother. I understand Evelyn's situation." Victoria grasped Eleanor's hand with practiced sympathy. "Growing up without parents has warped her perspective. Please don't be angry with her."

Evelyn had exhausted herself with explanations. She rolled her eyes. "How utterly nauseating."

Eleanor's expression darkened, but Victoria intervened again.

"Evelyn, if shouting at me makes you feel better, go ahead. I know those three years in prison were difficult for you." Victoria addressed the cafeteria staff with calculated grace, "Yes, Evelyn made mistakes, but haven't we all? She's served her sentence and atoned. I hope you'll all give her a fair chance."

The performance was masterfully two-faced. Employees immediately praised Victoria's supposed magnanimity while Eleanor beamed with maternal pride.

Someone even complimented Victoria's noble bearing, as befitting high society.

Evelyn nearly gagged.

How many employees actually knew her? Now Victoria had branded her publicly as a convicted criminal.

The whispers began immediately.

"A prison record? Not someone we should associate with."

Disgusted, Evelyn turned on her heel. The entire room seemed blind to Victoria's theatrics.

She gathered her belongings, ready to leave Blackwood Enterprises for good. But at the exit, a voice stopped her.

"Evelyn."

She turned to find Victoria smirking triumphantly.

"Tsk." Victoria clicked her tongue. "Since when did you become so weak? Running away so easily? Do you really think any company will hire you after this?"

The pieces fell into place.

No wonder every job application had been rejected. Victoria's doing.

"It was you."

"Obviously." Victoria twirled a strand of hair. "I made sure every HR department in Willowbrook knows about Evelyn Sinclair - the convicted plagiarist who brings legal trouble to any foolish enough to employ her."

Evelyn's blood boiled, but she remained composed.

"Victoria, karma has a way of balancing scales. Your misdeeds will surface eventually."

Victoria laughed. "Still clinging to fairy tales? If good always prevailed, you wouldn't have been convicted three years ago. All it took was my word against yours."

She admired the diamond on her finger, the stone catching the light with cruel brilliance.
###Chapter 49

Evelyn's gaze dimmed with despair. The ring glinting on Victoria's finger was unmistakable - her own original design!

"Evelyn, you're quite talented," Victoria taunted, admiring the jewelry. "This piece is exquisite. But what truly matters is that Alexander placed it on my finger himself."

She twirled the ring ostentatiously, smug satisfaction radiating from her every pore.

Evelyn's fingers curled into tight fists, her phone recording every damning word. Through gritted teeth, she forced a smile.

"Victoria, are you actually admitting to framing me for plagiarism when this was clearly my creation?"

Victoria scoffed. "What if I did? Who would believe you over me? You're nothing compared to me."

"Enough." Evelyn's lips twisted in a bitter smile as she turned away abruptly.

A flicker of unease crossed Victoria's face as she registered Evelyn's strange behavior. By the time realization struck, Evelyn had already slipped into her car.

Within hours, the explosive video went viral across social media platforms.

Victoria's face appeared crystal clear in the footage, every arrogant word preserved in digital perpetuity. Evelyn watched as netizens reacted with shock, then outrage at the injustice she'd suffered.

She'd been falsely accused all along.

But soon, the tide of public opinion shifted dangerously.

Comments flooded in defending Victoria - claiming she'd been provoked by Evelyn causing her miscarriage. That her actions were understandable, even forgivable.

What was plagiarism compared to losing a child?

Evelyn closed her eyes against the painful irony. She'd not only lost her reputation, but her precious daughter too. Yet who cared about her suffering?

Returning home, Evelyn spotted the sleek luxury car parked conspicuously outside her building.

The door swung open as she approached.

Alexander emerged like a storm cloud, his towering frame radiating icy elegance. His mere presence made Evelyn's breath catch.

She instinctively stepped back, but he blocked her path. His mesmerizing eyes glinted with dangerous intensity.

"So what if Victoria bribed officials to accuse you? You only lost your reputation," he spat. "But Victoria lost our child! What were you trying to achieve with that video? Haven't you hurt her enough?"

"You only lost your reputation."

The words landed like blows, each syllable dripping with contempt for her and unwavering defense of Victoria.

Evelyn's vision blurred with unshed tears. She met his gaze defiantly. "You're right. It's not enough."

Her fists clenched until her nails bit into her palms.

"That bitch will suffer a living hell even if it sends me back to prison for life!"

Evelyn lifted her chin, her red-rimmed eyes blazing with unbroken resolve.

She moved to leave, but Alexander's iron grip seized her wrist. His expression darkened ominously.

"Evelyn," he warned in a voice like frozen steel, "don't test my patience. Or I'll ensure you rot in prison forever."

Her heart pounded with fear she refused to show. Summoning every ounce of strength, she flashed a reckless grin despite the agony coursing through her.

"Do whatever makes you happy, Mr. Blackwood. I don't have long anyway. But I promise you this - I'll drag that viper down with me before I go."
###Chapter 50

Alexander clearly didn’t anticipate Evelyn speaking to him with such defiance.

His initial intention had been to put her in her place, but something shifted in his gaze. His voice remained as icy as ever. "What do you mean you won’t live long?"

Evelyn hadn’t expected him to latch onto that. Shouldn’t he be shouting at her, warning her to stay away from Victoria?

She couldn’t decipher his thoughts, nor did she want to reveal the tumor growing inside her.

"It’s nothing. You shouldn’t waste your concern on a woman like me, Mr. Blackwood." She pushed him away, her body aching where the tumor pressed against her nerves.

But Alexander didn’t relent. "Evelyn, you’re as stubborn as ever. Is this another one of your pathetic ploys to manipulate my sympathy?"

She blinked before letting out a hollow laugh. "Yes, another act. How could someone as shameless and cold-blooded as me ever compare to the love of your life? Victoria must be an absolute saint in your eyes."

Her gaze locked onto his, searching for any flicker of emotion.

He paused for a brief moment before answering. "You’re right. No one could ever replace Vic in my heart. From the moment I met her, I knew she was the woman I’d protect for the rest of my life."

His eyes darkened, sharpening like daggers. "So if you dare lay a finger on her, I’ll make sure you suffer a thousand times worse."

Each word sliced through her like a blade, drawing invisible blood.

Her vision blurred—whether from anger or tears, she didn’t know.

So he had killed their daughter without hesitation, all to appease Victoria.

So he had chosen her from the very beginning.

Then what was she?

He had once promised to protect her forever on that beach. He had vowed to make her his wife.

Had it all been a joke? No—in his eyes, she wasn’t even worth that much.

The man before her was a stranger. No—not a man. A monster.

When Alexander finally left, Evelyn collapsed onto her bed, curling into herself as pain wracked her body.

She refused painkillers. She wanted the agony—to remind herself to stay sharp, to stay alive long enough to avenge her daughter.

Evelyn resumed her job hunt, but the result was the same—no one would hire her.

Standing at the intersection, she stared blankly at the traffic light.

How was she supposed to fight Victoria like this?

Her gaze drifted toward a glittering entertainment district nearby, and a memory surfaced.

Before her imprisonment, she had been drowning in debt.

Yet since her release, no creditors had come knocking.

At first, she assumed they pitied her—until she learned someone had already settled her debts.

Her first thought was Olivia. Had her best friend taken out another loan for her?

But the answer stunned her.

"A man paid it off."

Her pulse spiked.

Alexander’s face flashed in her mind.

Was it him?
###Chapter 51

My heart skipped a beat. If it was him, what role was he playing to settle my debts? My spouse?

But Evelyn's hopes shattered instantly when the creditor uttered a name—Nathaniel Sterling.

She dialed Nathaniel's number immediately. Within twenty minutes, he appeared before her.

When Evelyn explained the situation, Nathaniel exhaled deeply. "God, Evelyn, I thought something terrible happened to you. It's just this? Don't worry about it."

"This isn't nothing, Nate." Evelyn met his gaze solemnly. "I don't know when I can repay you. Thank you, truly."

"No hurry. The money isn't going anywhere."

"But—"

"If you really want to thank me," Nathaniel interrupted, his warm eyes locking onto hers, "then buy me dinner. I came straight here without eating." His voice softened. "Sharing your burdens makes me happy."

Evelyn recognized that particular glimmer in his eyes—the unspoken affection between a man and woman.

She quickly looked away and nodded. "Alright."

Fresh out of prison, Evelyn's funds were limited. She worried she couldn't even afford one proper meal.

But Nathaniel, ever considerate, suggested grabbing tacos from a street vendor.

Here was the heir to the Sterling fortune, casually eating street tacos by the roadside. Guilt gnawed at Evelyn as Nathaniel happily found them a spot to sit.

"You wouldn't believe how much I love these," he said between bites. "Lived on them throughout college."

Evelyn knew the truth—he'd chosen this precisely to spare her wallet.

Warmth flooded her chest at his thoughtfulness.

Owing Nathaniel was infinitely better than owing the nightclub. Yet this debt weighed differently on her heart.

She watched him finish his meal, unable to join due to her delicate health condition that prohibited spicy foods.

Walking beneath the neon glow of downtown Willowbrook, Nathaniel sighed. "You know, Evelyn? In college, I dreamed of strolling these streets with you. Never imagined it'd take until our thirties to happen."

Melancholy tinged his voice, yet happiness shone through.

Evelyn offered a soft smile. "Nate, I'm grateful we reconnected, but—"

"Would you consider being with me?" He stopped abruptly, cutting her off mid-sentence.

Evelyn froze. Her pulse hammered against her ribs.

"You're divorced from Alexander now, right? Rumor says he's marrying Victoria soon."

She'd believed all love for that man had died. Yet the mention of his impending marriage to Victoria sent sharp pain through her chest—proof some ember still smoldered.

But it was just an ember. Their story had ended.

"Evelyn, I'll wait for you." Nathaniel didn't press further, smiling gently instead. As he reached for her hand, blinding headlights cut through the night.

A luxury sedan screeched to a halt before them. The door swung open, revealing an achingly familiar silhouette.

Alexander Blackwood.

Impeccably dressed and radiating icy disdain, his lips curled at the sight of Evelyn with Nathaniel.

"Evelyn Sinclair," he sneered. "How cheap can you be? Fresh out of prison and already whoring yourself to another man behind your husband's back? If you wanted him, why crawl into my bed? Or do you get off on the cheating?"
###Chapter 52

Evelyn's face drained of color. So this was how Alexander truly saw her—filthy and worthless.

"Alexander, watch your mouth!" Nathaniel stepped forward, shielding Evelyn. The air between them crackled with hostility.

Alexander's lips curled into a cold smirk. "Respect? You're parading around with another man's wife, and you dare lecture me about respect?"

His words were daggers, each one slicing deeper into Evelyn's heart.

"When have you ever treated Evelyn as your wife? Besides, she's not yours anymore!" Nathaniel stood his ground, unflinching.

A dark storm gathered in Alexander's eyes as they locked onto Evelyn. "Is this how you lure men now?"

A shiver ran down her spine. She couldn't fathom the fury burning in his gaze.

He seized her wrist, yanking her to his side. His glare never left Nathaniel. "She's still legally bound to me. Even if I discard her one day, I won't let scavengers like you pick through what's left."

The cruelty of his words left her breathless. Without another word, he shoved her into his car.

Nathaniel lunged forward, but Evelyn stopped him with a single look. He froze, the weight of Alexander's declaration settling over him.

They were still married.

Evelyn had no idea where Alexander was taking her. The car sped recklessly, the world outside blurring into nausea-inducing streaks.

She remembered his warning and let out a bitter laugh. "You're contradicting yourself, Mr. Blackwood. Didn't you say women like me weren't fit to sit in your car? Or have you forgotten how dirty I am?"

Alexander's grip on the steering wheel tightened. The car lurched forward, accelerating even faster.

Her stomach churned violently. "Alexander, stop! Where are you taking me?"

"Eager to run back to Nathaniel?" His voice was ice.

She clenched her fists. "What if I am? We're done!"

A dark chuckle escaped him. "Evelyn, do you really think you can walk in and out of my life whenever you please?"

His piercing gaze sent a jolt through her. She didn't understand his meaning.

But one thing was clear—Alexander was set to marry Victoria soon. Whatever twisted game he was playing, it needed to end.

The car screeched to a halt outside an upscale salon.

Alexander shoved her toward the staff. "Make her presentable."

Evelyn resisted. "I'm not doing this."

His voice dropped to a lethal whisper. "Unless you want everyone you care about to suffer, you'll cooperate."

Everyone she cared about...

Only Olivia came to mind.

Her grandfather was gone. Alexander couldn't use him anymore.

Olivia was all she had left.

An hour later, Evelyn emerged transformed.

A champagne-colored gown hugged her curves, the delicate fabric shimmering under the lights. Her cropped hair framed her face, accentuating her sharp cheekbones. She looked stunning—radiant, even.

Alexander's gaze flickered with something unreadable before it vanished.

To her shock, they arrived at Blackwood Estate.

As they stepped out, his hand settled possessively on her waist, his touch searing through the thin fabric.

The autumn wind was cold, but his palm burned against her skin.

"Grandfather wants to see you."
###Chapter 53

His deep baritone voice echoed in Evelyn's ears, making her pulse quicken. But she refused to let herself fall into those naive fantasies again. The love she once felt for Alexander had long been consumed by bitter hatred.

Evelyn never expected Henry Blackwood to welcome her so warmly despite her prison sentence. The elderly patriarch encouraged her to start anew and rebuild her life with Alexander.

This surprised Evelyn deeply. Given his traditional values, she'd anticipated disgust or rejection. Instead, she found unexpected kindness that reminded her of her late grandfather.

Dinner at Blackwood Estate was tense. While Henry treated her with respect, everyone else - especially Margaret Blackwood - made their disdain obvious.

Once Henry retired, Margaret's mask slipped. "If you had any decency," she sneered, "you'd file for divorce and stop interfering with Alexander and Victoria's wedding plans."

Her contempt was palpable. "After what you did to Victoria's child, you should be begging to leave this family."

Evelyn finally understood their game. She glanced at Alexander, who remained silent. Clearly, they wanted her to initiate the divorce to avoid Henry's disapproval.

The timing couldn't have been more perfect when Victoria arrived, leading a rosy-cheeked little boy by the hand. The sight stabbed at Evelyn's heart, reminding her of the daughter she'd lost.

If only fate had been fair, her child would be about the same age now.

Victoria's triumphant smirk made Evelyn's blood boil. "Why should I be the one to file for divorce?" she challenged.

The question wiped the smug expression off Victoria's face. Alexander merely watched with quiet amusement, his gaze making Evelyn's skin prickle.

"Alexander," she said pointedly, "I won't divorce you. After all the effort I put into getting into your bed, that would be such a waste."

Her crude words had the intended effect - Victoria flinched while Margaret gasped in outrage.

"Evelyn! Have you no shame?" Margaret snapped.

Unfazed, Evelyn watched Victoria's eyes darken with barely contained fury.

"I'm so sorry," Victoria simpered, playing the victim. "This is all my fault. You and Alexander are legally married, after all. I'm the intruder here."

"If you know you're the other woman," Evelyn shot back, "why don't you leave? Are you proud of being a homewrecker?"

Victoria's facade cracked. After a dramatic pause, she fled in fake tears, the child toddling after her.

Evelyn was sick of the theatrics, though they clearly worked on the Blackwoods.

Alexander gave her an unreadable look before following Victoria. Margaret stormed off muttering curses.

As Evelyn left, she encountered Victoria's son again. The boy's cherubic face was a cruel reminder of what she'd lost. Why did this child get to live while hers had perished?

The injustice burned through her veins. Clenching her fists, Evelyn approached the unsuspecting child, her heart pounding with a dangerous mix of grief and rage.
###Chapter 54

The small child turned at the sound of approaching footsteps. His cherubic face now fully visible to Evelyn, those sparkling eyes like polished sapphires blinking up at her.

The burning hatred in Evelyn's chest dissolved instantly, replaced by an unexpected surge of tenderness.

Tears pricked at her eyelids as an overwhelming urge to weep seized her.

'If my baby had lived, she would have been just as adorable.'

After all, Alexander's genes were impeccable. Any child of his would undoubtedly inherit those striking features.

Evelyn crouched down, gently brushing her fingers against his soft cheek. "What's your name, sweetheart?"

The boy blinked adorably. "Mommy and Daddy call me Ethan."

'Mommy and Daddy.'

The words stabbed through Evelyn's heart.

Her child should have known that same love, but now...

"Evelyn! What are you plotting now? Take your revenge on me if you must, but leave my son with Alexander alone!" Victoria's shrill voice cut through the moment, her exaggerated tone emphasizing the boy's parentage.

Evelyn had never considered harming an innocent child. Hearing Victoria's accusation, a dark thought flickered through her mind.

Perhaps she should take lessons in cruelty from this woman.

"Mommy!" The boy immediately ran to Victoria.

Victoria scooped him up with exaggerated concern, examining him dramatically. "Let me check if you're hurt."

Evelyn let out a soft, humorless laugh. "Victoria, your performance improves with each act."

"How can you be so heartless?" Victoria's face twisted in feigned anguish. "Three years ago you stole my fiancé and killed my first child with Alexander. Now you'd harm my son? Though we're not blood sisters, I've always treated you kindly."

Watching Victoria's theatrical display, Evelyn responded with an icy smile. "Oh, you've been exceedingly kind to me, dear sister. And I intend to repay every bit of that kindness."

Victoria froze, momentarily speechless at Evelyn's words.

Evelyn took satisfaction in her stepsister's stunned expression.

Preparing to leave, Evelyn spotted Alexander approaching. Moonlight accentuated his aristocratic features, making him even more devastatingly handsome than three years ago.

Her traitorous heart skipped a beat, though she'd long abandoned any hopes regarding this man.

She gave him a dismissive glance and moved to walk past.

Alexander's hand shot out, grasping her wrist.

"Where do you think you're going, Mrs. Blackwood?" His deep voice held a note of confusion.

Evelyn paused, noticing Victoria's darkening expression from the corner of her eye. She curved her lips into a saccharine smile.

"What do you imagine, darling? It's late. I'm going home, of course."

Her artificial smile faltered slightly when she caught the unreadable glint in Alexander's eyes. He released her wrist before she could decipher it.

"Wait in the car. I'll join you shortly."
###Chapter 55

Should she return with him?

Evelyn curved her lips into a sweet smile. "Alright."

Turning her head, she caught sight of Victoria. The woman's face had darkened like storm clouds, her lips pressed into a thin line. Evelyn could practically hear the grinding of teeth from where she stood.

That look of suppressed fury brought Evelyn immense satisfaction. Victoria teetered on the edge of explosion, yet clung desperately to her carefully crafted image of gentleness.

Alexander was walking toward Victoria now. Of course he would comfort that two-faced witch.

From across the distance, Evelyn watched Victoria clutch her child closer, leaning into Alexander with practiced vulnerability. "Alexander, I'm terrified Evelyn might hurt us again. Three years in prison have only made her more unstable," Victoria whispered.

"Alexander, you remember our childhood promise, don't you? You swore to make me your bride and protect me forever."

Evelyn told herself she no longer cared about Alexander's proximity to other women. Yet seeing them so close sent sharp pains through her chest, each breath becoming a struggle.

This wasn't love. It couldn't be. Only pure, unadulterated hatred.

They'd murdered her daughter in cold blood. And here they stood, living without consequence.

Evelyn didn't wait for Alexander's return. Hailing a cab, she left without looking back.

Her phone buzzed soon after. Though she'd changed her number, those memorized digits burned into her vision like branding irons. Alexander called three times. Three times she watched the screen light up and fade to black.

In the taxi's backseat, the flashing screen mirrored her life - brief moments of hope swallowed by endless darkness.

How many times had she foolishly hoped for even a shred of his affection? Each disappointment piled higher until they formed an insurmountable mountain of despair.

Evelyn pressed a hand to her aching chest. 'This isn't love, Alexander. This is vengeance.'

Job hunting proved fruitless. Rejection after rejection. At this rate, she'd never rebuild her life.

Evelyn confided in Olivia. "I need to leave Willowbrook. Start fresh somewhere else." Only then could she gather the strength to avenge her daughter.

Olivia offered her life savings without hesitation. Evelyn refused. Nothing in life came free.

Packing light, she booked a train ticket. As she wheeled her suitcase outside, a familiar black sedan pulled up.

Alexander emerged, his cool demeanor cracking as he took in her luggage. "Going somewhere, Mrs. Blackwood?"

Evelyn's pulse quickened. Gripping the suitcase handle, she forced calm into her voice. "Perhaps ask your mistress why your lawful wife can't even afford dinner."

Something flickered in Alexander's eyes. Without warning, he seized her arm, pulling her toward the car.

Fear spiked through her - especially when his skin met hers. That familiar warmth sent unwanted shivers down her spine.

Evelyn struggled violently. "Alexander! Let me go!"
###Chapter 56

Alexander's fingers dug into Evelyn's arm like steel claws. No matter how violently she thrashed against him, he effortlessly forced her into the sleek black sedan.

She couldn't remember when he'd stopped caring about her "soiling" his precious car. Now he even allowed her to sit in the front passenger seat without hesitation.

Dark clouds rolled across the sky without warning. Within minutes, a violent storm unleashed its fury upon Willowbrook.

Evelyn's breath hitched. Heavy rain always transported her back to that horrific delivery room.

The cramped space. The blinding pain. The overwhelming terror as they ripped her newborn daughter away.

She squeezed her eyes shut, trying to block out the memories of blood-soaked sheets and heart-wrenching screams.

"Alexander, where are you taking me?" Evelyn's voice cracked. "Planning to finish what you started? I won't let you murder me like you did our child!"

Her fingers scrambled for the door handle, nails scraping against polished leather.

She couldn't die yet. Not before making Victoria pay for what they'd done.

Alexander slammed the locks with one hand while yanking the steering wheel with the other. The car fishtailed before screeching to a halt.

"Have you lost your damn mind?" His stormy gaze burned into her as he dragged her across the console.

Evelyn met his glare with bloodshot eyes. "I lost my mind the moment I fell for a monster like you. A man who could slaughter his own flesh and blood without blinking!"

Each word tore through her chest like shrapnel.

How could someone be so cruel? So heartless?

Yet the proof sat before her in a tailored Armani suit.

Alexander studied Evelyn's tear-streaked face, his expression unreadable. After a long pause, he finally spoke. "Were you really pregnant three years ago?"

Evelyn's bitter laughter filled the car.

Tears spilled down her cheeks as she flashed a sardonic smile. "How convenient that you've forgotten, Mr. Blackwood. Shall I refresh your memory?"

She leaned closer, her breath fogging the glass between them.

"That night in the boardroom when I begged on my knees? When you kicked me away and said—"

Her voice dropped to a deadly whisper. "'Then let that bastard in your womb rot alongside Victoria's miscarriage.'"

Alexander's pupils contracted.

Evelyn watched the realization dawn across his perfect features. "You did it, Alexander. You buried our daughter with Victoria's illegitimate child."

Her fists pounded against his chest. "She was innocent! Your own flesh and blood!"

Sobs wracked Evelyn's body as years of pent-up agony erupted.

"Do you want to see more proof?" Her fingers flew to her coat buttons. "Here! See what your precious Victoria did to me!"

Layer by layer, she revealed the roadmap of scars covering her once flawless skin.

Alexander's jaw tightened as he took in the angry marks crisscrossing her torso. His knuckles turned white against the steering wheel.

A muscle twitched in his temple as his grip on her shoulders loosened ever so slightly.
###Chapter 57

"Can you see them now, Mr. Blackwood? Thank you for your... concern." Evelyn's voice cracked with bitter irony. "You made sure every one of those thousand days in prison was truly unforgettable."

Her bitter smile sent scalding tears dripping onto Alexander's hand. His long fingers twitched involuntarily - he'd never realized tears could burn like acid.

The rain intensified, drumming against the car roof. Evelyn heard the rhythmic swish of windshield wipers struggling against the downpour.

Suddenly, the air between them stilled. Evelyn wiped her cheeks, her gaze turning eerily calm.

"Alexander," she whispered, "if I had a choice, I'd erase every memory of you from my life."

His obsidian eyes darkened further at her words. "You don't get that choice, Evelyn. You'll always be my wife. That's a fact neither of us can change."

A hollow laugh escaped her lips. "Really? You'd chain yourself to me forever? What about your precious Victoria? Won't she slit her wrists when she hears this?"

Alexander's jaw clenched at her mocking tone. The muscle in his cheek jumped, but no words came. Instead, he slammed the accelerator.

Exhaustion finally claimed Evelyn. She awoke hours later in the familiar four-poster bed of her former bedroom.

He'd brought her back to Blackwood Estate. Strangely, nothing had changed - same silk drapes, same antique vanity. Then the realization hit: this was probably where he and Victoria...

Bile rose in her throat. She barely made it to the marble bathroom before dry heaving.

Night had fallen. She'd slept through the entire day without eating.

The mirror reflected a ghost - sunken cheeks, bloodshot eyes. A walking corpse of the woman she'd once been.

Her phone buzzed. Nathaniel's name flashed on screen.

After three rings, she answered. His concern washed over her like warm honey. She murmured thanks, but what could she possibly offer in return?

Knock. Knock.

The sudden rapping made her jump. She hurriedly ended the call.

The door creaked open, revealing Mrs. Harrington with a tray. "Dinner is served, Mrs. Blackwood. Shall I—"

"Victoria! Where the hell is everyone?" A shrill voice echoed up the grand staircase.

Mrs. Harrington paled, nearly dropping the tray. The poor woman had clearly suffered Victoria's tantrums before.

Evelyn almost smiled. After all these years, the staff still called her "Miss Lancaster." Not Mrs. Blackwood. That title belonged to Evelyn alone.

The satisfaction vanished when Victoria stormed in, designer heels clicking like gunshots.

"Miss Lancaster!" Mrs. Harrington gasped. "You shouldn't—"

Victoria's manicured finger jabbed toward Evelyn. "You! How dare you come back here, you scheming whore?"
###Chapter 58

Victoria pointed at Evelyn with a trembling finger, her carefully cultivated facade of gentleness shattering like glass. "How dare you show your face here?" she shrieked, voice dripping with venom.

Mrs. Harrington didn't even flinch at Victoria's outburst. The longtime housekeeper had seen the true nature of the Lancaster heiress years ago.

Evelyn had intended to leave, but the sight of Victoria's unraveling composure made her settle gracefully onto the sofa instead. "As the lady of Blackwood Estate, my presence here is hardly surprising," she countered, crossing her legs with deliberate slowness. "The real question is why an uninvited guest like yourself is trespassing in my home?"

"Your home?" Victoria's laugh was shrill enough to crack crystal. "Did prison rot your brain, Evelyn? I'm the rightful mistress here! You're nothing but Alexander's discarded pet!"

The vicious words hung in the air between them. Victoria's snarling expression bore no resemblance to the polished socialite she pretended to be.

Evelyn merely smiled. "If I'm a dog, then you're the flea on its back. Or have you forgotten whose bone marrow saved your pathetic life? My blood literally flows through your veins."

Victoria's face contorted as if struck. She whirled toward Mrs. Harrington. "Have you lost your mind letting this trash inside? Get her out before Alexander returns unless you want to be unemployed!"

Amused by the tantrum, Evelyn tilted her head. "Why don't you tell her who brought me home, Mrs. Harrington?"

Though exhausted from earlier tears, Evelyn wasn't foolish. Only one man would dare bring her back to Blackwood Estate.

Mrs. Harrington swallowed nervously. "Mr. Blackwood carried Mrs. Sinclair home himself. He instructed that she would be staying with us indefinitely."

Despite anticipating the answer, the confirmation still sent a jolt through Evelyn.

"Lies!" Victoria's scream could have shattered windows. "Alexander would never touch this whore!"

Evelyn watched with detached interest as Victoria's face purpled with rage. The sight was oddly satisfying.

"Darling Victoria," Evelyn purred, "does basic logic escape you? I'm Alexander's legal wife. Why wouldn't he carry his spouse? Your hysterics only prove what everyone knows - you'll always be the mistress, never the bride."

The barb struck true. Victoria trembled with barely contained fury. Being called "the other woman" was her greatest insecurity.

"Out! Now!" Victoria screeched at the housekeeper.

Evelyn rose gracefully. "Mrs. Harrington, I'd like dinner served in the dining room. Please set a place for one."

The relieved housekeeper practically fled the battlefield.

Alone with Evelyn, Victoria finally snapped. Her manicured hand flew toward Evelyn's face. "You bitch!"

Evelyn sidestepped effortlessly, leaving Victoria stumbling from her own momentum. The would-be attacker nearly toppled onto the coffee table.

"Careful, Victoria," Evelyn tutted. "Wouldn't want to explain those bruises to Alexander."

Gritting her teeth, Victoria hissed, "Don't get comfortable! Alexander only keeps you around for his grandfather's sake. My ring will be on his finger soon enough!"

Evelyn's laughter was light as champagne bubbles. "You said that exact same thing three years ago, darling."

Victoria's confidence visibly deflated.

"Karma comes for everyone, Victoria," Evelyn said, moving toward the door. "And when it comes for you? I'll be there to watch you burn for what you did to my daughter."

With that, Evelyn exited, leaving Victoria trembling in impotent rage.
###Chapter 59

The truth was, Evelyn still felt deeply unsettled. In her current state, she stood no chance against Victoria.

Alexander's behavior today had been particularly puzzling.

As she pondered this, movement caught her attention from the hallway.

Evelyn looked up just as Alexander's imposing figure came into view. The rain still fell steadily outside, making his usual icy demeanor seem even colder.

Their eyes met unexpectedly. His gaze was so intense it felt like drowning in dark waters.

Evelyn's pulse quickened inexplicably. Just as she prepared to look away, a blur rushed past her.

Victoria clutched her cheek dramatically, sobbing as she threw herself against Alexander's chest.

"Alex..." Her voice trembled with manufactured distress.

Here we go again.

Evelyn smirked in weary amusement. This performance was getting tiresome.

Alexander's eyes remained locked on Evelyn for several heartbeats before he turned his attention to Victoria. "What happened?" His voice was smooth velvet - a tone he'd never used with Evelyn.

Victoria buried her face deeper into his chest. "It's all my fault. Evelyn did nothing wrong. Alex, if you must blame someone, blame fate for bringing us together at the wrong time. Don't force Evelyn to divorce you. I'm just afraid... if this continues, she might really hurt me and Ethan. I can't let anything happen to our child again."

Her words dripped with false martyrdom, each syllable carefully crafted to implicate Evelyn.

When Alexander's questioning gaze turned to her, Evelyn didn't bother explaining. Instead, she nodded cheerfully. "Absolutely right. So you'd better watch your back, mistress. Next time I snap, I might not stop at just you - that little brat could be fair game too."

Victoria's sobs hitched dramatically. She dabbed at dry eyes with theatrical precision.

"Alex, I'm terrified. Maybe we're just not meant to be. I'll raise Ethan alone."

With this dramatic declaration, she pulled away - only to stumble theatrically near the hallway entrance, collapsing in a carefully staged fall.

Evelyn rolled her eyes. Honestly, this was getting ridiculous.

"Victoria!" Alexander rushed to her side, concern etching his features.

The sight sent a sharp pang through Evelyn's chest. How many times had he watched her crumple in real pain without lifting a finger? How often had he been the one to push her down, then walked away without a backward glance?

Her fists clenched as she turned toward the dining room.

Moments later, Alexander entered with a limping Victoria in tow. He guided her to a chair with exaggerated care, then instructed Mrs. Harrington to bring her special pasta.

Victoria shot Evelyn a triumphant glance when Alexander wasn't looking. "Alex, my ankle really hurts. I should stay tonight. I keep spare clothes and toiletries here anyway."
###Chapter 60

Victoria blinked, her eyes wide with practiced innocence, her voice soft and fragile.

Men, however, seemed blind to the most obvious performances. And this particular act worked on them like a charm.

Eleanor knew Alexander would agree without hesitation. Sure enough, within seconds, she saw him nod. "Stay, then."

Predictable.

Eleanor found it laughable. From the corner of her eye, she could feel Victoria's smug gaze, taunting her.

But Victoria's triumph was short-lived.

Alexander turned to Mrs. Harrington. "Prepare a guest room for Miss Lancaster," he ordered.

Eleanor, mid-sip of her soup, nearly choked.

The smugness on Victoria's face vanished instantly.

What the hell?

Victoria couldn't believe it. Is he referring to me?

Eleanor frowned. This didn’t make sense.

How could Alexander dismiss the woman he supposedly loved?

Yet, he had.

Watching Victoria struggle to maintain her composed façade while her forehead vein threatened to burst, Eleanor felt a dark satisfaction.

But she didn’t fool herself into thinking Alexander was deliberately slighting Victoria. No, he was probably just unwilling to flaunt their affair in front of the housekeeper.

Later that night, Eleanor had barely settled into her room when Alexander walked in.

Exhausted, she watched as he slowly undressed. "Alexander," she said flatly. "What do you want?"

Silence.

Only the sound of rain tapping against the window filled the room.

Then, his cold voice cut through. "Don’t you want to keep being Mrs. Blackwood?" He turned, his dark eyes glinting with something unreadable. "If you’re so desperate to hold onto the title, then you should fully embrace it."

His tone was calm, but a chill ran down Eleanor’s spine, seeping into her bones, making her shiver.

The next morning, the house was eerily empty.

Eleanor knew better. Victoria had been humiliated last night—she wouldn’t let this slide.

Not wanting to walk into another trap, Eleanor left immediately, returning to Olivia’s place.

Olivia was still asleep but bolted upright when Eleanor recounted everything. "Alexander didn’t divorce you?" she gasped. "Evie, did he finally grow a conscience? Is he trying to make amends?"

Eleanor shook her head, a bitter smile on her lips. "He doesn’t care about me. He’s only doing this because of his grandfather. The woman he loves is Victoria."

Yes.

He had told her—from the moment he met Victoria, he had wanted her as his wife.

He loved her. He would never let her suffer, not even out of guilt for what he had done to Eleanor.

And if he could ignore his own child, why would he care if Eleanor lived or died?

A sharp pain lanced through her chest, the tumor throbbing violently. Eleanor quickly swallowed the pill Benjamin had given her.

Sweat beaded on her forehead. She bit her lip hard, the pain keeping her painfully alert.

Her thoughts drifted to the daughter she had lost before ever holding her. Tears blurred her vision.

She had to hold on.
###Chapter 61

She had to survive long enough to witness Victoria's downfall!

Evelyn didn't make it out of Willowbrook. Alexander would drag her back to Blackwood Estate eventually.

Strangely enough, Old Master Blackwood took an instant liking to Evelyn. He patted her shoulder with unexpected warmth. "You remind me of someone, child. Perhaps we were family in another life?"

Oddly enough, Evelyn felt the same inexplicable connection the moment their eyes met.

Every visit to Blackwood Estate was torture. While she played the perfect companion for Alexander, everyone else treated her like unwanted trash - especially Victoria.

She'd clawed her way this far, only to be blocked by the old man's affection. Becoming Mrs. Blackwood now seemed impossible.

On Monday afternoon while job hunting, Evelyn's phone buzzed with Alexander's call. He demanded her presence at the estate that evening.

Before she could refuse, he cut in. "I'm swamped today. Get yourself there. And don't forget Grandpa's favorite pastries from Maplewood Avenue."

Through her visits, Evelyn had learned about the old man's weakness for those particular muffins. Alexander never passed the shop without buying some.

Grabbing her purse, Evelyn took the subway to Maplewood Avenue.

As she exited the bakery, a small figure caught her eye. Ethan Blackwood - Victoria and Alexander's son.

Evelyn scanned the area but saw no sign of Victoria. The toddler kept turning in circles, clearly searching for someone.

'Lost?' she wondered. Passersby were starting to notice the lone child. Some approached him curiously.

At barely two years old, how could Ethan explain his situation?

When a shady-looking man moved toward the boy, Evelyn sprinted forward. "Ethan!" she called.

The child turned. Having met Evelyn several times, he recognized her instantly. "Evie!" he chirped.

The stranger scowled and walked away.

"Where's your mommy, sweetheart?" Evelyn crouched to his level.

"Mommy..." Ethan's big eyes welled with tears.

The word pierced Evelyn's heart.

She'd been a mother once. That chance was stolen from her forever.

After fifteen minutes with no sign of Victoria, Evelyn tried calling Alexander. No answer. Remembering his earlier claim about being busy, she gave up.

Since she was heading to Blackwood Estate anyway, she might as well bring Ethan along. A taxi pulled up just then.

As the cab drove off, Evelyn studied the child beside her, lost in thought.

This was Victoria's flesh and blood. Why couldn't she abandon him like Victoria had abandoned her daughter? Why couldn't she let some stranger take him?

But she couldn't. Not only that - she found the boy endearing.

Exhaustion overtook her. Evelyn closed her eyes briefly...

She awoke to violent shaking. Victoria's manic face filled her vision, streaked with tears. "Evelyn! Where's my baby? Give me back my son! Please!"
###Chapter 62

Evelyn's head throbbed violently. When Victoria shook her, the dizziness intensified.

"Eve, how could you be so heartless? I don't care how much you despise me, but my child is innocent! What have you done to Ethan?"

The words struck a chord—too familiar.

Evelyn remembered saying something similar to Victoria once.

But now?

What was Victoria accusing her of?

"Eve, tell me! Where is Ethan? Answer me!"

Still disoriented, Evelyn flinched as Victoria shrieked in her face.

"Ethan?" Evelyn struggled to recall. She had been bringing Ethan back to Blackwood Estate.

So why was she in her own apartment now?

A cold dread slithered up her spine. She didn’t want to imagine what had happened.

"Evelyn, I never thought you'd actually follow through with your threats."

Alexander's voice, icy and sharp, cut through the air above her.

She looked up. His handsome face was twisted with contempt.

His words carried a hidden meaning, but Evelyn couldn’t grasp it. Not when Victoria was sobbing hysterically beside her.

"Eve, I'm begging you! I'll give up everything—just return Ethan to me! I'll make sure Alexander treats you well, just give him back!" Victoria clutched at Evelyn’s arms, desperation in her eyes.

Evelyn turned to Alexander, panic rising. "I found Ethan lost on Maplewood Avenue. I was taking him home—"

"Stop lying!" Victoria screamed. "We saw the security footage. He wasn’t lost. You took him!"

Evelyn’s pulse raced. She forced herself to stay calm. "If you checked the footage, then you know I was heading to Blackwood Estate. But then—"

Then she had blacked out.

Her breath hitched. A realization struck her. "The driver! He was suspicious—he must have taken Ethan!"

Alexander scoffed, his gaze freezing her blood.

"Alexander, I didn’t take your son. I would never hurt him!" Evelyn met his piercing stare, refusing to back down.

"Still acting, Evelyn? Or did you forget what you told Victoria in front of me? You warned her—when you snap, you won’t just come for her, but for the boy too. And now you dare deny it?"

A chill spread through her veins.

Yes, she had said that—but only to provoke Victoria.

She would never act on it.

"Eve, please! For old times’ sake!" Victoria suddenly dropped to her knees.

Alexander pulled her up, his glare like daggers. "You have one minute to confess. If you don’t, I’m sending you back to prison."

Evelyn’s entire body went numb.

Prison.

The word alone sent terror coursing through her.

She remembered the endless days of torment—the beatings, the isolation, the suffocating despair.

It had nearly broken her.

She couldn’t die.

But she couldn’t go back there either.
###Chapter 63

The minute passed in a heartbeat.

Victoria's sobs jolted Evelyn awake. Alexander's icy gaze bore into her as his fingers hovered over his phone, dialing those three damning digits. He was calling the police!

"Stop!"

Evelyn's frayed nerves finally snapped.

She stumbled forward, her face ghostly pale. "Alexander, I swear I didn't take your son! No matter how much I despise Victoria, I would never—"

"So you'd only be satisfied if Victoria suffers the same agony, is that it?" Alexander cut her off. His eyes were twin blades, carving into Evelyn's heart without mercy.

"Evelyn, a snake never sheds its venom. Women like you could die a thousand deaths and still not atone for what you've done!"

His words struck like bullets, each one finding its mark in her trembling chest.

"Don't even think about escaping this time," Alexander spat, pressing the call button.

The police came anyway.

Summer's last gasp gave way to autumn's approach when lightning split the sky, thunder shaking the earth.

Evelyn flinched violently, her face draining of color.

Memories flooded back—the brutal beatings, the night they induced labor. Her heart shattered as she collapsed at Alexander's feet.

"Please believe me, Alexander! I didn't do this!" Her voice cracked with desperation.

Strong as she was, Evelyn was still just a woman.

She clutched at his trousers, tears streaming. "I swear on my life!" The raw plea tore from her throat. She remembered begging like this before, only to be kicked aside.

This time, hesitation flickered in his eyes.

Just as hope sparked, Victoria's timely wail shattered it. "Alexander, is Ethan gone forever?"

Any hesitation vanished. Evelyn found herself in handcuffs again.

In the interrogation room, her denials fell on deaf ears. History repeated itself cruelly.

Evelyn's spirit broke.

Fate loved torturing her. Loving the wrong man had cost her everything.

When all seemed lost, they released her.

Alexander's car waited outside the station. Rain poured in sheets as Evelyn ran toward it.

Before she could speak, the window rolled down. Her phone struck her face. Alexander yanked her close by the collar. "Did you conspire with this man to kidnap my son? The evidence doesn't lie, Evelyn!"
###Chapter 64

The downpour blurred Evelyn's vision, but Alexander's fury cut through the rain like a blade.

His fingers dug into her throat with bruising force, stealing her breath away.

Watching her face turn crimson from oxygen deprivation, he finally released his grip as if discarding trash. Then came the violent shove.

Evelyn gasped, rainwater filling her mouth as she collapsed onto the slick pavement.

Her trembling fingers retrieved the waterlogged phone. The screen illuminated with messages.

At the top - an unknown number. 'The brat won't stop crying. Had to teach him a lesson. He's quiet now. When are you paying up to get him back?'

The words detonated in Evelyn's mind like a grenade. Her thoughts scattered like shrapnel.

A kidnapping message. But why was it addressed to her?

"Evelyn Sinclair," Alexander's voice dripped venom. "You'd stoop this low? Conspiring with criminals to kidnap my son? If Ethan has so much as a scratch, I'll carve the price from your flesh."

Ice flooded Evelyn's veins. As she tried rising, white-hot pain lanced through her abdomen.

She crumpled back onto her knees beside Alexander's car, rain streaming down her face. "Alexander! I don't know this person! I didn't take Ethan! This is a setup!"

The storm intensified, needles of rain making it impossible to open her eyes.

"A setup?" Alexander's laugh held no humor. "Victoria framed you again? Using her own child as bait this time?"

His eyes burned with murderous intent.

"Listen carefully, Evelyn. If my son isn't in my arms within the hour, I'll reunite you with that bastard child of yours in hell."

The tires screeched as he peeled away, spraying filthy water across her already soaked form. His parting words struck deeper than any blade.

Hiss.

Evelyn doubled over, clutching her stomach as agony radiated through her core. The icy rain numbed her skin but couldn't dull the internal torment.

Three years in prison hadn't hardened her enough.

She remained fragile. Breakable.

Teeth gritted, she forced herself upright.

Alexander's phone rang endlessly before cutting to voicemail. Again. Again.

Her shaking fingers returned to the ominous text. She dialed the number.

Instant answer. A familiar yet unplaceable male voice: "Evelyn, you got my money?"

The casual demand short-circuited her thoughts. Where had she heard that voice before?

"Who are you?" Her pulse hammered in her throat. "What are you talking about?"

"Playing dumb now?" The man chuckled darkly. "You hired me for this job. Hurry up with payment before I lose patience with the kid. Might just snap his neck to shut him up."

Ethan's imagined whimpers sent fresh pain through Evelyn's chest.

"Don't hurt him!" The plea tore from her raw throat.

"Then move your ass. I'm not waiting forever." The line started to disconnect.

"Wait! Where are you?" Evelyn screamed into the phone. "Tell me where to find you!"
###Chapter 65

The caller revealed his location before abruptly ending the call.

Evelyn immediately dialed Alexander's number, only to realize with a sinking heart that he'd likely blocked her.

Her contact list was barren - only one number remained: Henry Blackwood's.

After a moment's hesitation, Evelyn dismissed the idea.

Time was slipping away. With no alternatives, she hailed a cab and gave the driver the address.

The middle-aged cabbie noticed her pallor and obvious discomfort. "Miss, you look unwell. Should I take you to the hospital first?"

Evelyn shook her head with a weak smile. "No, thank you. Please just take me to the address."

Thirty minutes later, the taxi arrived at a remote countryside location surrounded by dense forests and lakes. Autumn leaves carpeted the ground.

An icy wind cut through Evelyn's thin clothing, making her shiver violently. The tumor in her abdomen throbbed mercilessly.

But thoughts of little Ethan's safety propelled her forward despite the pain.

She stumbled along the gravel path for what felt like miles before spotting a dilapidated cabin.

Her foot caught on a loose stone, sending her sprawling. Sharp gravel tore into her palms.

Evelyn clenched her jaw, brushing off the debris. These superficial wounds were nothing compared to Alexander's cruel accusations or the constant agony in her gut.

With tremendous effort, she dragged herself to the cabin door.

The locked door resisted her push. As she raised her hand to knock, it swung open violently.

Dominic Fletcher's smirking face appeared.

Before she could react, he yanked her inside with brutal force.

"Maddie, darling! I've missed you," Dominic crooned, reaching for her.

Evelyn shoved him away weakly. "Where's Ethan?" Her eyes darted around the dim interior.

Dominic chuckled, advancing. "Why rush to see that brat? We've got unfinished business." He lunged.

Exhausted from the journey, Evelyn couldn't resist as he pinned her against a rough wooden table.

"Stop! Dominic, you monster!" she screamed.

CRACK! His palm connected with her cheek. "Quit playing innocent! We both know what you are."

Blood trickled from Evelyn's split lip as she struggled. "You're lying! We never slept together!"

"Lying?" Dominic sneered. "That's rich coming from you, framing your own sister Victoria!"

Evelyn froze.

"Still playing the victim after three years in prison?" Dominic taunted. "You contacted me the day you got out, plotting to kidnap Victoria's son for ransom. Now you dare accuse her? Today, I'll expose your true nature!"
###Chapter 66

Dominic's words still hung in the air when Evelyn's blouse tore apart with a sickening rip.

Pain radiated through her battered body, sapping what little strength remained. Just as she thought Dominic would succeed in his vile intentions, the door exploded inward with a thunderous crash.

The hinges gave way completely as the heavy wooden door collapsed onto the concrete floor.

Evelyn turned her head weakly, her vision swimming until it focused on Alexander's face - breathtakingly handsome yet terrifying as the devil himself.

When their eyes met, the sheer malice in his gaze sent ice through her veins.

Alexander crossed the room in three strides, yanking Dominic off Evelyn with enough force to send him sprawling.

"You dare lay hands on my son? Have you lost your will to live?"

His fist connected with Dominic's jaw with a sickening crack. A tooth went flying as blood sprayed from the man's mouth. A brutal kick sent Dominic crashing into the wall, where he crumpled, unable to rise.

Evelyn lay trembling on the cold floor, desperately trying to cover herself with the tattered remains of her clothing.

Alexander looked down at her with undisguised revulsion. "Evelyn, you've sunk lower than I ever imagined possible."

His disgusted sneer burned into her memory as he turned toward the back room.

Moments later, he emerged carrying a sleeping Ethan.

Seeing the boy unharmed, Evelyn exhaled in relief - until Alexander's murderous glare returned to her. Her stomach twisted with fresh dread.

"Alexander, please," she begged, voice raw with desperation. "I had nothing to do with this-"

A cold, mocking laugh cut her off. "Do you take me for a fool, Evelyn? You deserve worse than death."

With that, he turned away, cradling Ethan protectively.

Evelyn forced herself upright despite her body's protests. She stumbled after them into the pouring rain.

The icy droplets stung her wounds as she reached the car window.

"Alexander, this was Victoria and Dominic's scheme! They've known each other for years! They were lovers - Victoria had two abortions because of him! I'm telling the truth! They're framing me!"

Her bloody fingers left streaks on the glass as she pleaded. The pallor of her face made her swollen eyes appear even more crimson.

She needed just one sign - the smallest flicker of belief in his eyes.

But Alexander didn't even grant her that. His sidelong glance held only contempt.

"What did Victoria ever do to deserve a sister like you?"

His words dripped with unwavering loyalty to Victoria and utter disdain for Evelyn.

"If not for her mercy, you'd have been dead long ago. A wretch like you shouldn't even draw breath."

Each syllable pierced her heart like shards of glass.

Her grip on the window frame slackened.

"Alexander," she sobbed, voice breaking, "am I truly so worthless in your eyes? Then why did you make me those promises all those years ago?"

Alexander's brow furrowed in genuine confusion before his lips curled in derision. "Seek psychiatric help, Evelyn. There is no 'back then' between us. I've only ever made promises to one woman - Victoria Lancaster."

The window rolled up, cutting off her final plea.

His chiseled profile blurred behind the rain-streaked glass as the car pulled away.

Evelyn collapsed into the mud like discarded trash, letting the storm rage over her broken form.

No physical wound could compare to the agony of his final words.

Every cherished memory - his whispered promises, their hands entwined on moonlit beaches - turned to ash in that moment, leaving only bitter emptiness.
###Chapter 67

"Really?"

"So you only made a vow to Victoria in this lifetime?"

"Then everything you said before was just empty words? And I was nothing more than a fleeting shadow in your life, unworthy of remembrance?"

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh.

She closed her eyes, unable to tell whether the wetness on her cheeks was from tears or the relentless rain.

Before she could gather the strength to stand, Alexander and the officers hauled her and Dominic into the police car.

During those forty-eight hours in detention, Evelyn endured another round of brutal beatings.

But she felt nothing. Absolutely nothing. Not even when she started coughing up blood.

Only her tears betrayed her, flowing uncontrollably. They burned her skin, blurred her vision, and drowned her shattered heart.

Crawling across the cold floor, Evelyn reached for the iron bars. Kicks and punches rained down on her back.

Through the small window, she caught a glimpse of sunlight outside. A broken smile curved her lips.

All these years, she had been living in a fantasy world of her own making. Meanwhile, that man had erased her from his memory completely.

So many years wasted on one-sided devotion.

Nathaniel Sterling fought tirelessly, gathering evidence and pulling strings until he finally secured Evelyn's release.

He rushed her to Benjamin Hayes for an examination. When the doctor saw the results, his face darkened.

The medication had been controlling the tumor's growth, but now her condition had deteriorated rapidly.

Benjamin couldn't fathom what Evelyn had endured to cause such a drastic decline. After prescribing stronger painkillers, he immediately consulted other specialists about emergency surgery.

When Alexander arrived at the station looking for Evelyn, the officers informed him she'd already been bailed out.

Fury ignited in his veins. He stormed to her apartment and seized the exhausted woman who had just returned from the hospital.

"How can you sleep so soundly after all the evil you've done?"

Evelyn's head throbbed violently. Meeting his enraged gaze, she managed a weak smile.

"What do you want now, Mr. Blackwood? More hired thugs to beat me? Or will you finally make it quick and kill me this time?"

Alexander's expression darkened at her defiance. He yanked her upright. "Death would be too merciful for you."

His words cut through Evelyn's haze of pain.

In Alexander's eyes, she saw a chilling darkness she'd never witnessed before.

That terrifying coldness seeped into her bones.

Terror gripped her as she struggled. "Alexander, what more do you want from me? Will my death finally satisfy you?"

"Death would be a kindness. No, Evelyn, I want you to suffer a fate worse than death."

Evelyn had no idea what fresh torment Alexander had devised. She fought against his iron grip, but he effortlessly dragged her from the apartment.

With brutal efficiency, he shoved her into his car and barked orders at the driver.

All the composure Evelyn had painstakingly rebuilt crumbled once more.

"Alexander, I never hurt anyone! Victoria is the one framing me! You're supposed to be so brilliant—how can you not see through her lies?"

Perhaps it was her tears that gave him pause. For just a moment, Alexander seemed to hesitate.
###Chapter 68

The tension in the car thickened instantly. Evelyn let out a bitter, exhausted laugh.

"Alexander, even if you refuse to believe me, what about your grandfather? He’s a man of wisdom, with decades of experience. If I were truly the monster you think I am, why would he have approved our marriage? Why would he show me kindness while treating Victoria with indifference?"

She had hoped Alexander might reconsider, but the moment the words left her lips, he scoffed.

"You know exactly why you married into this family and why Victoria is treated the way she is."

His implication was clear—he believed Evelyn had manipulated Henry Blackwood’s feelings, turning him against Victoria.

Yet he never stopped to question whether a woman like Victoria, who had willingly become the other woman, was truly blameless.

"Evelyn, enough with the act. We’re going to see Grandfather now. Let him see the real you."

Evelyn’s smile turned hollow. She was tired of defending herself.

Her entire existence had been reduced to a lie—one so twisted, it was beyond redemption.

Alexander dragged her back to Blackwood Estate, forcing her into the grand living room.

Henry Blackwood sat rigidly in his chair, his expression unreadable.

Victoria wept softly in the corner, while Margaret Blackwood comforted her with gentle murmurs.

The moment Margaret spotted Evelyn, she shot to her feet, finger jabbing accusingly.

"Evelyn! How could you be so heartless? Attacking an innocent child—what has Victoria ever done to deserve this?"

Her voice rose, sharp with fury.

"Three years ago, you stole Alexander from her with your scheming ways. And now this? You’re nothing but a vicious, calculating witch!"

She raised her hand, ready to strike.

Evelyn braced herself—but then, Henry’s voice cut through the room like steel.

"Enough."

Margaret froze, disbelief flashing across her face. She hadn’t expected Henry to intervene.

Neither had Evelyn.

"Father, how can you still defend her? Anyone with eyes can see what she’s done!" Margaret’s voice trembled with outrage. "If it weren’t for her, Victoria would be your rightful granddaughter-in-law. She gave us a grandson, yet she suffers while this woman walks free. You must stand up for her!"

Victoria’s sobs grew louder, her delicate fingers wiping at her tears.

"Mr. Blackwood, I don’t expect to be welcomed into this family. I had Ethan out of love for Alexander. I don’t want to argue with Evelyn—I just beg you to make her stop hurting your great-grandson."

Her words were a masterstroke of manipulation. Margaret looked near tears, her heart breaking for Victoria.

Evelyn wanted to laugh. She glanced at Alexander—only to find his cold gaze already fixed on her.

She quickly looked away.

Then, Henry let out a derisive snort.

"Great-grandson?" His tone dripped with sarcasm. "The only great-grandson I recognize will be the one Evelyn gives me. She is the lawful wife of this family."

Silence.

The air in the room turned to ice.

No one had seen this coming.
###Chapter 69

Victoria stopped her pitiful act and turned to face Henry Blackwood with an uncomfortable expression.

The elderly patriarch's face was stern, his presence commanding. "You inserted yourself into another woman's marriage and had the audacity to bear an illegitimate child. Instead of feeling shame, you wear your disgrace like a badge of honor. The Blackwoods don't welcome daughters-in-law who lack self-respect."

Victoria's carefully constructed mask nearly shattered at his words. Her lips twitched violently.

Clearly, she hadn't anticipated how lowly the old master regarded her character.

No wonder he'd always disapproved of her.

Evelyn observed Victoria's clenched fists. The woman was struggling to maintain her sweet facade, yet stubbornly refused to drop the act.

"Father, you can't say that!" Margaret Blackwood interjected sharply. "Evelyn was the real homewrecker here! If she hadn't schemed against Alexander all those years ago, he and Victoria would be happily married by now! And let's not forget she kidnapped Ethan! How can you overlook that?"

"I never took Ethan. And I wasn't behind what happened three years ago either. I was the victim in all of this," Evelyn countered calmly.

Margaret's face flushed with anger. "That Dominic Fletcher already confessed everything about Ethan's kidnapping! How dare you still deny it? You've been obsessed with Alexander for years and couldn't have him, so you set him up!"

"If I didn't orchestrate anything, then why did he sleep with me? The reporters even caught us together. You planned everything, Evelyn! You're the most despicable, low-class woman I've ever met!"

"Dominic was paid to say those things. I don't even know him." Evelyn's gaze flickered briefly to Victoria before settling on Alexander. "Yes, I've loved Alexander for a long time. But I would never resort to such underhanded tactics to get a man."

Her eyes met Alexander's with quiet dignity before she offered a bitter smile.

"But I see everything clearly now."

Evelyn's words carried profound weight. Alexander's brow furrowed as he studied her carefully constructed smile, his expression inscrutable.

"Grandfather, thank you for your trust and support. But I'm clearly not meant to be a Blackwood. I've made my decision - I want a divorce."

Her declaration sent shockwaves through the room.

Victoria nearly vibrated with excitement. Finally, she would become Alexander's lawful wife!

Evelyn noted Victoria's barely concealed delight. But when she glanced at Alexander, she found him staring at her with such intensity it made her pulse race. His dark eyes burned with something dangerous and unreadable.

She quickly averted her gaze.

"Father, since she's brought up divorce, you should agree to it," Margaret urged eagerly. Victoria watched the exchange with barely restrained hope.

Henry Blackwood ignored them both, extending his hand toward Evelyn. "Come here, child."

Victoria and Margaret's faces fell.

After a brief hesitation, Evelyn approached the kind-faced patriarch.

Henry studied Evelyn with gentle eyes. "I'll ask you two questions," he said softly. "Do you truly wish to divorce Alexander and cease being part of our family?"

Evelyn's gaze flickered to Alexander's stormy expression before she nodded. "I'm not worthy of the distinguished Mr. Blackwood."

As she spoke, an icy chill seemed to emanate from Alexander's direction.

Henry nodded thoughtfully, his eyes twinkling as he glanced at his grandson. "Then tell me - did this 'distinguished Mr. Blackwood' continue sharing your bed after being forced into marriage?"
###Chapter 70

The room fell into stunned silence. No one had anticipated Old Master Blackwood's question—least of all Evelyn.

Her pulse, which had just steadied, spiked again. She had no idea how to respond.

Henry Blackwood observed the flush creeping up Evelyn's cheeks and understood.

A knowing smile curved his lips before he turned his sharp gaze toward Alexander. Then, with deliberate gravity, he fixed his attention on Victoria and Margaret Blackwood, both wearing expressions of pure discomfort.

"Not a single soul will break this marriage while I still draw breath," the old man declared, his voice ringing with authority.

Evelyn caught sight of Victoria's face—dark as storm clouds, twisted with barely contained fury. She could practically hear the venomous curses swirling in the other woman's mind.

"Miss Lancaster."

The old master addressed Victoria formally, acknowledging her status as the Montgomery heiress.

Victoria forced a brittle smile. "Yes, Mr. Blackwood?"

"I refuse to believe my granddaughter-in-law kidnapped your son. If you insist on pressing charges, you may direct your complaints to my legal team."

Victoria's smile froze.

She hadn’t expected the old man to defend Evelyn so fiercely!

This was outrageous!

He kept calling Evelyn his granddaughter-in-law, each word driving a dagger of jealousy deeper into Victoria’s chest. Her face contorted with barely suppressed rage.

Margaret Blackwood gaped. "Father, have you lost your senses? Evelyn has committed unforgivable acts—how could you—"

"I may be old, but I am not a fool!" Henry Blackwood snapped, his voice cutting like steel. Margaret immediately fell silent. Victoria, though seething, didn’t dare utter another word.

"Enough. Alexander, take your wife home."

The command was clear. To Evelyn’s surprise, Alexander moved beside her without protest, his fingers closing around hers in a deceptively tender grip. "Let’s go."

The moment their hands touched, Evelyn’s heart stuttered.

His skin was cool, but the contact burned like a brand against her palm, sending an uncomfortable heat through her.

Noticing Victoria’s glare, Evelyn tilted her head up and flashed Alexander a sweet, obedient smile. "Of course."

After bidding farewell to the old master, Evelyn followed Alexander in silence.

As they walked toward the car, she could feel the weight of Victoria’s furious stare boring into her back. A glance over her shoulder confirmed it—Victoria looked ready to explode.

Evelyn suppressed a smirk.

Then, without warning, Alexander wrenched his hand away.

He slammed his foot on the accelerator, his voice icy. "Evelyn, I underestimated you. What kind of poison did you feed my grandfather to make him defend you like that?"

Evelyn studied his profile—still breathtakingly handsome, but devoid of any warmth.

Outside, rain began to fall again.

She tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear and smiled sweetly.

"Darling, what a ridiculous thing to say. If I had that kind of poison, I’d have used it on you first."

Alexander slammed on the brakes.
###Chapter 71

The sudden brake sent Evelyn's body lurching forward. A sharp pain shot through her abdomen, forcing her to double over. Before she could recover, Alexander's iron grip yanked her upright.

His chiseled features remained devastatingly handsome even in anger, now mere inches from her face.

"Admitting it now?" Alexander's voice dripped with ice. "That you drugged me and crawled into my bed that night?"

Evelyn gazed at the face she'd loved for years and smiled bitterly.

"If that's what you believe, Mr. Blackwood." She saw no point in explanations anymore.

Alexander froze. The sardonic smile on Evelyn's lips triggered a memory - another smile, eerily similar. His grip slackened momentarily before his eyes darkened with revulsion.

"Pathetic." The word cut like a blade as he shoved her away.

Evelyn clutched her stomach, swallowing a whimper. Then she lifted her chin defiantly.

"Maybe I am. But I'm still cleaner than your precious Victoria by a million times."

"Enough!" Alexander roared. "Still slandering her after everything?"

Evelyn laughed through the pain. "Why would I need to slander someone who got pregnant at sixteen and had an abortion?"

Alexander's hand closed around her throat instantly.

Evelyn's breath hitched as oxygen fled her lungs.

"Say that again," he growled, eyes burning with fury. "I dare you."

Gasping, Evelyn met his gaze unflinchingly. "Victoria Lancaster is a two-faced snake who pretends to be pure! I swear on my life I've only ever been with you, while she's had more partners than you can count!"

Her vision darkened, but she continued hoarsely, "That baby she lost three years ago? It wasn't yours. Yet you sacrificed our child over her lies!"

Tears streamed down her face as the memory tore through her.

Alexander suddenly released her, looking shaken.

Evelyn coughed violently, drawing ragged breaths. "Investigate it yourself," she rasped, seeing his conflicted expression.

Alexander scoffed. "Why would I trust an ex-con's word?"

"Then may I die horribly if I'm lying."

"Drop dead already," he spat coldly.

The words froze Evelyn's heart solid.

"Get out." Alexander flung the car door open.

He abandoned her on the rain-slicked roadside without a backward glance, tires screeching as he sped away.

Evelyn collapsed to her knees, arms wrapped around her aching stomach. The downpour soaked through her clothes, matching the chill in her soul.

As darkness crept at the edges of her vision, a silver sedan pulled up. A black umbrella appeared above her, followed by a familiar voice.
###Chapter 72

Evelyn's vision blurred as she caught sight of polished Italian loafers and tailored trousers. Her heavy eyelids fluttered upward.

Through the haze, a strikingly familiar face swam into view before darkness claimed her consciousness.

The sterile scent of antiseptic greeted Evelyn when she awoke. Olivia sat vigil by her hospital bed.

"You're finally awake!" Olivia's voice trembled with barely restrained emotion. "Evelyn Sinclair, have you completely lost your mind? Going out in that downpour with your condition!"

Evelyn noted Olivia's bloodshot eyes and quivering lips. Her best friend was clearly fighting tears.

"See? Still breathing." Evelyn forced a weak smile, though she could feel her body protesting more than usual.

The memory of swearing on her life to Alexander resurfaced bitterly. How ironic that her reckless vow might soon come true.

"Who brought me here?" Evelyn asked, recalling the shadowy figure before she collapsed.

"Some devastatingly handsome stranger," Olivia said, perking up. "Deep voice, broad shoulders - the nurse couldn't stop gushing. He used your phone to call me." She nudged Evelyn playfully. "Secret admirer?"

Evelyn barked a humorless laugh. "What man would want damaged goods like me?"

"Stop that!" Olivia snapped. "You're gorgeous, brilliant, and any man would be lucky to have you. You're just too hung up on that worthless Alexander to see it."

Was she still hung up on Alexander?

The question left Evelyn strangely hollow.

After three days of forced rest, Evelyn finally regained enough strength to function.

Alexander, surprisingly, hadn't made any moves against her during her recovery.

Time was slipping through her fingers, but Evelyn refused to surrender. Not until she'd avenged Amelia.

She'd sent out dozens of resumes. Today, she had her first interview.

Dressing carefully in professional attire, Evelyn headed to the corporate office in the financial district - just blocks from Blackwood Enterprises.

Fate proved cruel as Victoria Lancaster emerged from the building just as Evelyn arrived. Probably heading to meet Alexander, coffee in hand.

Victoria's face twisted in recognition. "Evelyn Sinclair! You're even more pathetic than I imagined. Couldn't even leave poor old Henry Blackwood alone - must have drugged the senile fool to make him defend you!"

Evelyn refused to engage. "Unlike you, Victoria, not everyone resorts to underhanded tactics. Henry sees you for what you are."

"Bullshit!" Victoria's composure cracked. "You poisonous little witch! If you hadn't poisoned Alexander's mind about my past, why would he suddenly be investigating me?"

This surprised Evelyn. Had Alexander actually listened to her warnings?

"Don't look so smug," Victoria hissed through clenched teeth. Her frantic denial betrayed her fear - Alexander's investigation must be getting close to the truth.

"You bitch!" Victoria suddenly focused on Evelyn's interview attire and the company logo. "Job hunting? Let's see who'd dare hire you after this!"

With a vicious flick of her wrist, Victoria flung scalding coffee directly at Evelyn.
###Chapter 73

Just as Evelyn thought she couldn't avoid the attack, a tall silhouette materialized before her.

The scalding coffee splashed across the man's immaculately tailored suit and crisp white shirt.

The incident happened with such startling speed that both Evelyn and Victoria stood frozen.

"Miss, your reckless action constitutes assault," the man stated, his voice rich and velvety like aged whiskey. His commanding presence set him apart from ordinary men.

Victoria recovered first, sneering as she recognized his face. "Trying to intimidate me? So what if I attacked this slut? Who asked you to interfere?"

"Miss Sinclair is now my employee. As her superior, her safety falls under my protection."

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat.

When she tried to speak, her gaze locked with his fathomless dark eyes. A strange sense of recognition washed over her.

Victoria's mocking laughter cut through the air. "You actually hired this fraud? Don't you know she's the notorious plagiarist all of Willowbrook is hunting? No respectable jewelry house would touch her without facing the wrath of the Blackwoods and Montgomerys!"

The man remained unfazed. "The Blackwoods? The Montgomerys? Expect legal papers soon. We'll settle this assault case properly."

With calm finality, he turned to Evelyn. "Come with me."

Evelyn glanced at Victoria's stunned expression before following him.

Victoria hurled her coffee cup to the ground in frustration and stormed off to find Alexander.

In the elevator, Evelyn studied her rescuer's profile.

His aristocratic features and commanding presence radiated both power and approachability.

After a moment's hesitation, Evelyn spoke. "Thank you... again." She recognized him now - the same man who'd taken her to the hospital that fateful day.

He glanced down, lips quirking. "I thought you wouldn't remember after losing consciousness. Seems I made quite an impression."

His playful tone eased her tension.

Evelyn's despair transformed into cautious hope. Not only had this stranger saved her twice, he was also the CEO of the company where she'd interviewed.

He'd hired her immediately, expressing complete confidence in her abilities.

As she left his office, Evelyn insisted on taking his coffee-stained garments to clean them properly.

To her surprise, he acquiesced without argument.

For the first time in months, Evelyn had stable employment with kind colleagues. She immediately called Olivia to celebrate over dinner.

So engrossed was she in her new work that Evelyn nearly missed her departure time. The job provided a welcome distraction from her painful past.

At the building's entrance, a silver luxury car pulled up beside her. The window lowered to reveal that same striking face.

"Get in. We need to talk."

Evelyn hesitated, but remembering his kindness, she nodded.

Just as she reached for the door handle, a familiar black sedan screeched to a halt inches from her. The near collision left her trembling.

Alexander emerged, his expression icy as he addressed the man in the other car with false pleasantry.

"No need for such courtesy, Uncle. I'll collect my own wife. Save your chivalry for someone else."
###Chapter 74

What?

Evelyn couldn't process what she had just heard.

Alexander calling her his wife was already surreal, but what shocked her more was how he addressed her boss.

Uncle?

She didn’t know the name of the man who had helped her twice. The staff simply referred to him as Mr. Whitman.

But Evelyn hadn’t dwelled on it. After all, common surnames existed everywhere. She never imagined he’d be Alexander’s uncle.

Sebastian Whitman stepped out of his car slowly, studying Evelyn with intrigue. "So, you're Alexander’s wife?"

Evelyn snapped out of her daze. "For now."

Alexander’s expression darkened at her response.

"For now?" Sebastian’s lips curved slightly as he glanced at Alexander. "If that’s the case, I won’t interfere with you taking your wife home."

He slid back into his car, then met Evelyn’s gaze. "Don’t forget work tomorrow. With your talent, you’ll go far in this industry."

"Thank you, Mr. Whitman. I won’t disappoint you."

Before she could finish, Alexander yanked her away and shoved her into his car.

As the engine roared to life, his voice dripped with sarcasm. "Evelyn, you never cease to amaze me. First Nathaniel, now my uncle? Your audacity is impressive."

The memory of Victoria’s smug threats this morning resurfaced. His words ignited a fire in her chest.

"Alexander, if you truly see me as your wife, show me—and your grandfather and uncle—some respect. If this was just about your pride, stop the car. I’ll disappear from your life without a fuss."

The brakes screeched. He actually stopped.

His fingers dug into her cheek, his gaze icy. "Uncle? How cozy. When did this happen?"

His mocking tone made her skin crawl. She glared back. "If I’m so repulsive to you, divorce me. I’ll convince your grandfather myself!"

Didn’t he want this? She was agreeing!

Yet his jaw tightened, veins bulging at his temples. A storm brewed in his eyes.

"Who’s next? Nathaniel? Sebastian?" His grip tightened. "Listen carefully, Evelyn. You don’t get to decide anything about our marriage. You’ll never be free of me—or chase another man. Now get out!"

He shoved her away, leaving her on the roadside as his car vanished into the distance.

She stood there, remembering the decade she’d wasted loving this cruel man.

Laugh or cry? She didn’t know anymore.

Evelyn met Olivia at a pizzeria. Olivia drank freely, but Evelyn resisted. Her fragile life wasn’t worth drowning in alcohol. Not again.
###Chapter 75

The night had settled in when Evelyn helped the intoxicated Olivia into the waiting taxi.

As she turned, her breath caught at the sight of Alexander leaning against his luxury car by the entrance.

His tall frame was silhouetted against the dim streetlights. One hand rested in his tailored pants pocket while the other held a cigarette, its glowing tip pulsing like a dying star in the darkness. The smoke curled around his sharp features, accentuating his solitary presence.

Evelyn's pulse quickened. She couldn't tell if it was nerves or something else. Every instinct told her to retreat, but his piercing gaze had already locked onto her.

"Get in." His command sliced through the night air.

Always so authoritative. Never giving her a choice.

She deliberately looked away. "Not tonight, Mr. Blackwood. We can discuss this tomorrow."

Alexander's jaw tightened. In three strides, he blocked her path. "I won't repeat myself."

"Who's this noisy bastard?" Olivia slurred, her drunken head lolling against Evelyn's shoulder. After squinting at Alexander, she burst into raucous laughter. "Ohhh, it's just you, you cheating scumbag!"

Evelyn felt the temperature drop instantly.

"Olivia, you're drunk. Let's get you inside." Evelyn tried to defuse the situation, her hands tightening around her friend's waist.

"I'm perfectly sober!" Olivia jabbed a finger at Alexander's chest. "And I'd recognize this bastard anywhere! Where were you when Evie was suffering, huh? Too busy coddling your precious mistress?"

Evelyn's stomach dropped. If Alexander decided to retaliate, Olivia wouldn't survive in Willowbrook.

"Enough!" Evelyn tugged at Olivia's arm, but the dead weight of a drunk woman was impossible to move.

"Alexander, I'll come with you," Evelyn said quickly, seeing the storm gathering in his eyes. "But you have to promise not to hold this against her. She doesn't know what she's saying."

Alexander's lips curled into a dangerous smile. "I think she knows exactly what she's saying."

"Then prove you're man enough not to punish a drunk woman for speaking truth!" Evelyn challenged.

He exhaled a slow stream of smoke, his gaze predatory. "Crushing her would be easier than stepping on an ant."

Olivia hiccuped loudly. "Go ahead then! Alexander Blackwood, you're nothing but a blind, cheating bastard!"

"Olivia, stop!" Cold sweat trickled down Evelyn's back. The air crackled with impending violence.

"Why should I? I've kept quiet too long!" Olivia swayed but stood her ground, pointing accusingly. "You don't deserve Evelyn! She's beautiful, brilliant, and waited years for you! Kept every promise! What did you do?"

Olivia's voice rose to a shout that echoed through the quiet street. "She finally rebuilds her life, gets a new job, and you waltz back in like you own her? Newsflash - if you don't want her, hundreds of better men are lining up!"
###Chapter 76

Evelyn knew Olivia's last sentence had thoroughly enraged Alexander.

He crushed his cigarette abruptly, his expression turning demonic. In one swift motion, he yanked Evelyn against his chest.

Olivia, suddenly deprived of Evelyn's support, stumbled and hit the pavement hard.

"Olivia!"

Evelyn cried out in alarm, struggling to reach her friend. But Alexander forcefully shoved her into the luxury car instead.

His voice dripped with venom. "Evelyn, is this your doing? Poisoning your best friend's mind with lies about me breaking promises? Playing the victim so convincingly? How...creative."

Alexander's glare burned through her, as if trying to brand his contempt onto her skin.

"Our promises? What promises could I possibly have made to someone like you? Stop deluding yourself."

Once again, he denied every vow they'd ever exchanged.

Evelyn hadn't expected him to remember those tender words anyway. Those memories had faded like morning mist, ready to vanish with the slightest breeze.

She pushed the thought away. Right now, Olivia needed her.

"Alexander, please let me take Olivia home. It's freezing out here at night. What if something happens to her?"

"Words have consequences."

His icy tone matched the Arctic temperature in the car. Evelyn recognized that dangerous glint in his eyes - he might retaliate against Olivia.

As he turned the ignition, Evelyn desperately grabbed his arm, her eyes brimming with tears.

"Alexander, Olivia was just defending me! Punish me instead! Beat me, send me back to prison - I'll endure anything! Just leave Olivia alone! Please, Mr. Blackwood! I'm begging you!"

She would have dropped to her knees if the confined space allowed it.

Alexander studied Evelyn's tear-streaked face, struck by how much she'd changed. The proud, stubborn woman he'd known now groveled before him - first pleading for his belief, now for mercy.

With an irritated sigh, he unlocked the doors. "Three minutes."

His rare leniency brought fresh tears. "Thank you, Mr. Blackwood! Thank you!"

She scrambled out, hauling the dazed Olivia to her feet and half-carrying her toward the apartment building.

As they left, Olivia kept slurring, "Evie...don't let that monster fool you again...he's not worth it..."

Alexander took Evelyn back to the Blackwood Estate.

Unsure of his intentions, Evelyn moved cautiously, terrified of provoking another outburst.

While Alexander showered, she hand-washed Sebastian's designer shirt.

Now knowing Sebastian was Alexander's uncle made the task feel strangely inappropriate. But the dry cleaning fees for such luxury fabrics were beyond her means.

Just as she finished rinsing, Alexander's glacial voice cut through the steamy bathroom.

"What do you think you're doing?"
###Chapter 77

His icy tone made Evelyn freeze mid-step. "Laundry," she answered flatly.

Alexander strode forward, his gaze locking onto the black shirt in her hands. A tempest brewed in his stormy eyes. "You're washing another man's clothes in my house?"

Rage propelled his foot forward, sending the laundry basin flying.

Water cascaded over Evelyn's slender frame, soaking her instantly.

She scrambled to her feet, the wet white sweater clinging to every curve of her body like a second skin.

Alexander's pupils dilated as fire and ice warred within him. Primal hunger surged through his veins.

His hand shot out, yanking her against his hard chest. Fingers dug into her chin, forcing her to meet his burning gaze.

"Three years in prison didn't teach you manners," he growled. "Just how to provoke me, didn't it?"

His warm breath fanned across her lips.

Evelyn let out a hollow laugh. "Mr. Blackwood, I value my life too much to provoke you. And I'd rather not wash anyone's clothes, but what choice did I have when your precious Victoria threw coffee at me? Sebastian was kind enough to shield me."

"Sebastian?" Alexander's lips curled into a sneer. "You call him more affectionately than you ever did me. How cozy you've become in such short time. Tell me, Evelyn, how did you seduce my uncle? Like this?"

With one brutal motion, he tore the damp sweater from her shoulders.

The fabric gave way instantly under his force.

Goosebumps erupted across her exposed skin despite the warm room.

He flung her onto the bed, his weight pinning her down before she could react.

Evelyn fought with all her strength, but his grip was iron. "Alexander, stop!"

His teeth sank into the tender flesh of her neck.

Pain radiated through her body, the tumor in her chest throbbing in protest.

"Was it this same sweet talk you used with other men?" he spat. "That you'd only ever love me? You disgust me, Evelyn. How did I ever end up married to trash like you?"

As he ripped away the last of her clothing, Evelyn suddenly went limp beneath him.

Her stillness was more unnerving than any struggle. Then came the laughter - bitter and broken.

Alexander stilled, rolling off her abruptly.

Tears streamed down her cheeks even as her lips curved in that terrible smile.

The sight punched through his chest - Evelyn looking more dead than alive.

Scars of varying sizes marred her pale skin like invisible chains suddenly made visible, constricting his breath.

"Why stop now, Mr. Blackwood?" Her voice dripped with acid. "Am I too filthy even for you?"

Her fingers traced the unhealed wounds. "Such an eyesore, aren't they? Sorry to ruin your appetite."

"Evelyn—" His voice cracked.
###Chapter 78

Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn, his brows drawn together in a tight frown. The fiery anger that had burned in his dark eyes moments before vanished without a trace.

He leaned down, his fingers brushing away a stray lock of hair from her forehead. His voice was softer than she'd ever heard it. "You told me you were carrying my child before you went to prison. What happened to our baby?"

The question sliced through her like a freshly sharpened blade. Old wounds tore open, fresh pain bleeding through the carefully constructed scars.

Evelyn let out a hollow laugh, her lips twisting into a bitter smile. "Exactly as you said, Mr. Blackwood. She's gone. Why ask now? Will your questions bring her back?"

"Evelyn, answer me properly." Alexander's voice carried an unfamiliar urgency.

She met his gaze, her smile never reaching her tear-filled eyes. "How very like you, Alexander. Always knowing exactly where to pour the salt." A single tear escaped, tracing a path down her pale cheek. "After all these years, I can survive your cruelty, your hatred, even your indifference. But do you know what destroyed me completely?"

Her breath hitched. "You gave me hope. Made me believe in us. But it was all my foolish fantasy. You called another woman's name when we were together. You paid doctors to terminate our child. You had her ashes scattered before I could even say goodbye."

The air between them grew thick with silence.

Evelyn could hear both their heartbeats - out of sync, just like their lives had always been. More tears soaked into the pillow beneath her as she remembered childhood promises made on sun-drenched beaches. "I won't lie to you, Alexander. Part of me will always be tied to you. But it's not love anymore. It's hate."

She repeated the words like a mantra, feeling chains of old attachments finally breaking. "I hate you, Alexander Blackwood."

If anything remained of her feelings, it was only nostalgia for the naive girl she'd once been - the girl who believed his promise to make her his bride.

Exhausted, Evelyn closed her eyes. She was so tired of loving, of hurting, of remembering.

Alexander watched her retreat into sleep, his chest tightening as if pierced by countless needles. This unfamiliar ache left him restless. He lay beside her, pulling her cold body against his, but no amount of contact could warm the distance between them.

Just before sleep claimed her, Evelyn heard his whisper: "You're lying to yourself, Evelyn. You still love me."

Did she?

The question followed her into dreams of childhood beaches and running after a boy who never looked back. What had once been sweet memories now festered like wounds that would never heal.

Morning light found Evelyn waking to her internal clock. Memories of the previous night brought fresh pain, followed by bitter amusement. The man who'd broken her beyond repair dared to ask about their lost child now?

She rose, washing away the night's tears with careful makeup. The closet surprised her - all her old clothes remained untouched, as if frozen in time. Victoria's things hadn't replaced them after all.

Selecting an outfit at random, Evelyn descended to find Alexander in the living room.

"You're awake." His tone gave nothing away.

Her lips curved without warmth. "Disappointed, Mr. Blackwood? Were you hoping I'd sleep forever?"

The sharp clatter of silverware against porcelain made her flinch. Had she pushed too far again?
###Chapter 79

Evelyn's lips curved into a smile. As she turned to leave, Alexander's gaze locked onto her. "Join me for breakfast."

What?

She froze mid-step, disbelief flashing across her features.

Since when did he speak to her with such gentleness? And when had they ever shared a private meal together, let alone something as intimate as breakfast?

"Madam, your breakfast is served." Mrs. Harrington beamed at Evelyn with grandmotherly warmth.

After a moment's hesitation, Evelyn approached the table.

Her eyes scanned the spread - bowls of granola, stacks of golden toast, and Mrs. Harrington's famous homemade scones. Exactly the kind of simple, comforting breakfast Evelyn adored.

"Sit here." Alexander pulled out the chair beside his own.

Evelyn shot him a wary glance. "Too close for comfort, Mr. Blackwood. Wouldn't want to accidentally spill coffee on your thousand-dollar suit."

She deliberately chose the seat opposite him.

Alexander's expression darkened instantly, thunderclouds gathering in his stormy eyes.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her spoon. She focused on her granola, avoiding eye contact.

Alexander studied her nervous posture and let out a derisive chuckle. "Can't stand being near your own husband now? Rushing off to meet that man?"

That man?

Evelyn's spoon clinked against her bowl. She looked up, confusion written across her face, just as Alexander's piercing gaze met hers.

"Evelyn Sinclair, didn't you vow to love only me in this lifetime? Has your lifetime expired already?"

His mocking tone dripped with barely concealed triumph.

Evelyn took a deliberate bite of toast before answering playfully, "Actually, yes. My lifetime's just about up."

The last traces of sarcasm vanished from Alexander's eyes.

"So you're confessing your feelings for another man?" His voice turned arctic.

Evelyn's pink lips quirked at the corners. "Suppose I am."

"Evelyn Sinclair! You—"

The doorbell's chime cut through the tension like a knife.

Mrs. Harrington answered to reveal Victoria Lancaster swaying into the foyer.

"Alexander darling, why didn't you come to me last—" Victoria's sugary voice faltered mid-sentence.

Even from across the room, Evelyn saw Victoria's face contort with rage before smoothing into a sickly sweet smile. "Evie, what a... surprise to see you here."

Evelyn glanced at the man calmly eating his breakfast before flashing Victoria a radiant smile. "Miss Two-Face, whatever do you mean? This is my home. Shouldn't I breakfast with my own husband?"

Victoria's grip on her designer purse turned white-knuckled, veins standing out against her skin. Yet her acting skills remained impeccable as she fluttered to Alexander's side. "Alexander, should I leave? Poor Evie seems jealous again."

Evelyn set down her utensils and stood. "Darling, you look like someone just punched you in your perfectly sculpted nose. All your features are scrunched together."

Victoria's smile twitched dangerously.

"I'm finished. Enjoy your little tête-à-tête."

"Where do you think you're going?" Alexander's voice stopped her.

"To work, obviously." Evelyn tossed her hair. "Unlike some trust fund princesses who spend their days getting manicures and maxing out credit cards."

Alexander's brow furrowed as he strode toward her. "I'll drive you."
###Chapter 80

Evelyn froze when she heard those words. The dam holding back her emotions threatened to burst.

"Alexander, I came straight here the moment I woke up." Her voice trembled. "I haven't even eaten breakfast. What am I supposed to do if you leave?"

Alexander didn't turn around. His response was cold, detached. "Then use this time to eat."

Evelyn stood rooted to the spot, stunned. Her fingers curled around her purse strap until her knuckles turned white.

She watched, helpless, as Alexander strode toward Vivian without hesitation.

Vivian blinked in surprise. The way he looked at her—intense, deliberate—sent a shiver down her spine.

"Come with me," he commanded, slowing his steps just enough to ensure she followed.

Confused but intrigued, Vivian glanced at Evelyn's furious expression and smirked. Without protest, she slid into the passenger seat of Alexander's sleek black car.

The drive was silent. Neither spoke.

Vivian stole a glance at Alexander's profile—sharp, unreadable, framed by the morning light.

Memories surfaced.

Back in college, she used to steal glances like this. Countless times. Back when her heart still fluttered at the sight of him.

But that girl was long gone.

Now, her pulse remained steady. No more racing heart. Only the dull, rhythmic beat of resignation.

The car stopped abruptly.

Vivian snapped out of her thoughts. They were parked in front of Blackwood Enterprises.

Alexander exited first, circling the car to open her door.

She hesitated. Was this kindness? Or just another calculated move?

"Thank you, Mr. Blackwood," she said coolly, stepping out. She turned to leave.

"Where do you think you're going?" His voice was low, dangerous.

Vivian paused.

"Starting today," he continued, "you work here."

She almost laughed. Was this a joke?

"If you're short-staffed," she countered, "I suggest posting a job listing."

Alexander's expression darkened. "Don't make me repeat myself, Vivian."

His gaze bore into hers. "You love jewelry design. Blackwood Enterprises has the best resources for you to excel."

The offer was tempting. Too good to be true.

"Did you suddenly grow a conscience, Mr. Blackwood?" Her lips curled into a mocking smile. "I do love design. But I value trust more."

Alexander stiffened.

She didn't wait for his reply. "When have you ever trusted me? Three years ago, when I was accused of plagiarism—did you believe me?"

Her voice was steady, but the bitterness seeped through.

"No," she answered for him. "You didn't."

A hollow laugh escaped her.

"So spare me the pity offer. Wouldn’t want your precious company tarnished by a plagiarist."

Alexander's face turned stormy.

Vivian didn't wait to see the explosion. She spun on her heel and walked away.

At the crosswalk, she risked a glance back.

He was still there. Watching her.

For a fleeting second, he looked almost... regretful.

She scoffed.

Too late for remorse now.

The light turned green. She crossed without looking back.

But she could feel his eyes on her. Burning.

Was he finally haunted by the past? By the child they'd lost?

Pathetic.
###Chapter 81

Evelyn Sinclair felt the weight of injustice pressing down on her. Would Alexander ever truly feel remorse?

Even if he did, it was far too late now.

The office buzzed with activity as Evelyn adjusted to her new surroundings. Her coworkers had been welcoming, even planning a small welcome lunch for the newest team member.

Just as lunchtime arrived and discussions turned to meal choices, Catherine Winslow strode into the room.

The department head was stunningly beautiful, her designer outfit accentuating her youthful figure. She clapped sharply for attention. "We've just landed a major client - influencer Scarlett Hartley is getting engaged. She's commissioned Blackwood Enterprises to design matching rings, a necklace, and bracelet."

A collective gasp filled the room when Catherine revealed the ten-million-dollar budget. "Success means a 10% bonus for our department."

Murmurs of excitement rippled through the staff. Evelyn's heart raced - jewelry design had always been her passion, ever since Alexander first introduced her to the craft.

"Cancel your lunch plans," Catherine continued. "We have one month. Project details are in your inboxes."

The promise of bonuses made everyone compliant. Evelyn, not particularly hungry, opened her email immediately.

Before she could read the specifications, Catherine approached. "Evelyn Sinclair?" she asked pointedly.

Evelyn stood quickly. "Yes, Ms. Winslow?"

"So it is you." Catherine's assessing gaze traveled from Evelyn's shoes to her hairline.

Evelyn maintained her professional smile despite growing discomfort. After an uncomfortably long pause, Catherine asked loudly, "Is it true you served three years for plagiarism?"

The office fell deathly silent.

Twenty pairs of eyes turned toward Evelyn simultaneously.

In the design world, plagiarism was the ultimate sin. Evelyn could feel her colleagues' attitudes shifting instantly.

"I never plagiarized," Evelyn stated calmly, though her hands trembled slightly.

"Then why were you convicted?" Catherine arched a perfectly shaped eyebrow. "No matter. You're lucky to have connections, but know this - I have zero tolerance for intellectual theft. Step out of line, and you're gone."

With that final warning, Catherine turned sharply and clicked away in her designer heels.

Evelyn stood frozen, feeling the weight of suspicious stares. The injustice burned in her chest.

Just when she'd found hope, fate seemed determined to snatch it away.

Needing air, Evelyn moved toward the exit. As she reached the door, she froze.

Eleanor Kingsley stood before her.

Despite their complicated history involving Victoria, Evelyn felt an unexpected warmth toward the older woman. "Mrs. Kingsley," she greeted politely.

Eleanor's reaction was immediate and violent. Her hand connected sharply with Evelyn's cheek.

The resounding slap echoed through the suddenly silent office as colleagues rushed to witness the spectacle.
###Chapter 82

Evelyn pressed a hand to her throbbing cheek, confusion swirling in her mind.

"Evelyn, you despicable creature! You wicked witch!" Eleanor shrieked, her finger jabbing toward Evelyn's face.

Evelyn didn't understand why Eleanor's sharp glare made her chest tighten with such suffocating pain.

"Mrs. Kingsley, why did you hit me?" Evelyn forced her voice steady, though her pulse hammered wildly.

"You dare ask me why?" Eleanor's finger trembled with fury. "You kidnapped my grandson with some accomplice, tormented my precious Victoria, and now you've manipulated another man to side with you! He sent a lawyer's letter accusing her of assault with hot coffee!"

With that, she hurled the crumpled letter at Evelyn's face.

"Evelyn, you vile woman! Thank God your parents aren't alive to see what you've become—they'd die of shame! If you were my daughter, I'd disown you on the spot!"

Each word struck Evelyn like shards of glass, slicing deeper into her already wounded heart.

Now she understood. Eleanor had stormed in solely to defend her beloved Victoria.

Heh.

What a devoted mother. She didn’t care about the truth—mothers always believed their children unconditionally, didn’t they?

Tears burned behind Evelyn's eyes. An invisible hand seemed to squeeze her chest, making every breath painful.

"Evelyn, mark my words—don’t think your little allies will protect you. Whatever you did to Victoria and my grandson, I’ll make sure you suffer twice as much!"

Eleanor delivered her threat with venom before spinning on her heel and storming away.

"I thought it was just a coincidence—same name, different person. But it’s really that Evelyn Sinclair."

"The one who stole her sister’s fiancé and caused her miscarriage."

"Ugh, are we seriously supposed to work with someone like her?"

The whispers of her colleagues followed Evelyn as she stood frozen by the office door. Humiliation burned through her, leaving her unsure where to even look.

Why did life have to be so cruel?

She was exhausted.

She wished she had parents to lean on when she felt this broken. But all she had was her illness and her tarnished reputation.

Silent tears traced her cheeks as she bent to pick up the letter. She hadn’t expected Sebastian to actually sue Victoria.

But it was fair. Victoria had assaulted them. Sebastian wasn’t wrong.

—

Bad news traveled fast.

The rest of the afternoon, Evelyn became the office spectacle. Employees from other departments lingered just to gawk at the "scheming, backstabbing homewrecker."

She assumed Catherine would remove her from the project—no one trusted her now. But to her surprise, Catherine declared firmly, "Everyone deserves a second chance. This project is crucial, and we need teamwork."

She even walked over to Evelyn’s desk, offering rare encouragement. "Evelyn, prove yourself. Don’t let me down."

Though Evelyn questioned Catherine’s sudden change, she wouldn’t let it distract her from work.

Her colleagues’ attitudes shifted slightly too—though she knew it was only for Catherine’s sake. Still, life went on, and she refused to let personal turmoil affect her professionalism. Besides, she loved this job.

At the end of the day, her coworkers packed up while Evelyn took a sip of water and kept working.

Catherine emerged from her office, frowning. "Still here?"

Evelyn glanced up. "I want to finish the bracelet design draft."

"You can do that at home. No need to put on a show of dedication here," Catherine said coldly before rolling her eyes and walking away.
###Chapter 83

Evelyn couldn't help but suspect Catherine had some sort of personality disorder. The way she treated her was so unpredictable.

Just then, a tall, elegant figure appeared in the doorway.

Catherine's eyes immediately brightened. "Mr. Whitman, what brings you here?"

Her entire demeanor shifted, becoming sickeningly sweet.

The other employees quickly set down their things, offering respectful smiles to Sebastian. "Mr. Whitman."

Evelyn finally snapped out of her daze. But everyone had already greeted him. Speaking up now would seem like she was trying too hard. So she simply nodded with a polite smile.

Sebastian returned Evelyn's smile before entering. He carried himself with effortless grace, his handsome features radiating quiet confidence.

"Thank you all for your hard work. I wish you success with the new project," he said warmly.

Catherine shot her colleagues a meaningful look that they all understood immediately.

"Thank you for your encouragement, Mr. Whitman! We won't let you down!"

"Excellent." Sebastian nodded.

Catherine flipped her long, curled hair over one shoulder, waiting expectantly. But instead of approaching her, Sebastian walked right past and stopped before Evelyn.

Catherine's smile froze. The other employees exchanged curious glances.

Evelyn suddenly understood - Catherine had feelings for Sebastian. But before she could process this realization fully, he was already standing before her.

"Evelyn." His voice was gentle. "How are you adjusting?"

Evelyn stood quickly. "Mr. Whitman, I'm doing well. Thank you for this incredible opportunity."

"We're family. No need for such formality." Sebastian's smile was warm.

The office erupted in whispers at his words.

All eyes turned to Evelyn with shock and confusion. Everyone was dying to know how she was connected to their boss.

"There's a family dinner tonight. I'll give you a ride since I'm heading home too."

Evelyn hesitated before declining. "That's not necessary. I can get there myself."

"We're going to the same place. Why stand on ceremony?" Sebastian asked with an amused smile.

Evelyn didn't know how to refuse again without seeming rude.

But accepting would make them appear too close.

As the silence stretched awkwardly, Sebastian spoke again.

"While Evelyn and I share a special connection, she earned her position here through her own merits. As she's still new, I hope you'll all make her feel welcome."

"Don't worry, Mr. Whitman! I'll take excellent care of Evelyn!" Catherine interjected, suddenly appearing beside them. She even gave Evelyn's shoulder an overly familiar pat. "Evelyn, darling, come to me with any questions. Mr. Whitman's friend is my friend!"

Evelyn nearly rolled her eyes at Catherine's fake enthusiasm.

Soon after, Evelyn and Sebastian left together under the office's bewildered stares.

When the elevator reached the lobby, Evelyn's phone rang. Alexander.

She stared at the caller ID, hesitating several seconds before declining the call.

It was the first time she'd ever hung up on him.

"Not answering?" Sebastian asked curiously.

Evelyn forced a light smile. "Just a telemarketer."

As the elevator doors opened and Evelyn stepped out, she froze.

There stood Alexander, dressed entirely in black, his expression stormy.
###Chapter 84

The moment Alexander's gaze landed on Evelyn standing beside Sebastian, his eyes turned glacial.

Published by N?v''elD/rama.Org.

He lifted his head, and Evelyn felt her pulse stutter.

Even though he wasn't the man she loved anymore, her body still reacted to him—betraying her lingering attachment.

"Alexander?" Sebastian stepped out of the elevator, surprised. "Are you here to pick Evelyn up?"

"None of your concern." Alexander's voice was icy. His eyes locked onto Evelyn. "Why did you hang up on me?"

"So it was you who called earlier?" Sebastian chuckled. "Evelyn thought it was a scam call and hung up. Did you two have a fight?"

Evelyn watched as Alexander's expression darkened.

His grip tightened around her wrist. "Let's go."

The winter air was biting, but Alexander's touch burned.

She had once dreamed of him holding her hand tenderly, guiding her across streets.

But this heat wasn't warmth—it was possession.

"I'll go with Sebastian," Evelyn said, pulling her hand free.

Alexander stiffened as her fingers slipped away.

"Uncle, let's leave," she urged.

Sebastian hesitated before nodding. "We'll be going, Alexander. Evelyn, come."

"Okay." She turned away quickly, afraid hesitation would make her falter.

Afraid she'd blindly follow him again.

"Evelyn," Alexander's voice cut through the cold. "Are you really not coming with me?"

Her nails dug into her palms.

She stopped, turning back.

Alexander stood alone, his tall frame stark against the empty lobby. For a fleeting moment, he looked almost vulnerable.

But the phantom pain of old wounds flared—like insects gnawing at her skin.

That pain steeled her resolve.

"I'm sure," she said firmly, then hurried after Sebastian.

—

By the time they reached Blackwood Estate, Alexander had already arrived.

His car barely stopped before he strode toward her, wrapping his arms around her slender frame in a grip too tight to escape.

Her heart pounded. "Alexander, what are you doing?"

"What does it look like?" His dark eyes bore into hers. "Grandfather wants to see us happy. Don't you want to make him happy?"

Evelyn bit her lip. She would play along for Henry's sake—but— "You don't have to hold me this tightly."

Sebastian frowned. "Alexander, even if you're upset, you're making Evelyn uncomfortable."

Alexander smirked. "How would you know what makes my wife comfortable? You two seem unusually close."

The insinuation hung heavy.

Evelyn squirmed in his hold, fueling his irritation. "This is between us. Stay out of it."

With that, he dragged her inside.

Evelyn shot Sebastian an apologetic glance, helpless against Alexander's force.

The dinner was supposed to be family-only, yet Victoria sat at the table, uninvited but unchallenged.

Henry, however, remained upstairs—too unwell to join.
###Chapter 85

The moment Evelyn saw Alexander and Victoria walking in together, her hands clenched into fists. A dangerous glint flashed in her eyes, but she could do nothing about it.

Then she spotted Sebastian.

Her breath caught in her throat.

That man was Alexander’s uncle.

Unease twisted inside her. She hadn’t expected the man who had defended her that day to be Alexander’s own family.

Worse—he had sent her a lawyer’s letter threatening to sue.

She swallowed hard, forcing herself to stand still, pretending nothing was wrong.

Sebastian noticed her too. His gaze flickered over her before he calmly looked away.

Alexander pulled Evelyn down beside him, while Victoria took the seat on his other side. The moment she sat, she began pouring his wine and serving him food like the perfect doting wife.

Evelyn’s appetite vanished. The table was laden with dishes, but her stomach couldn’t handle anything heavy.

“Try this,” Alexander suddenly said, scooping a spoonful of spicy curry into her bowl. “My mother’s specialty. You’ve never had it before.”

She knew this was just another act—another way to control her. But her body couldn’t take the spice, and she hated curry.

“Thank you, darling,” she said softly, “but I don’t like this.”

His expression darkened.

“Evelyn,” Victoria chimed in sweetly, “Mrs. Blackwood made this dish specially. You can’t refuse. Besides, I know you love curry. Why lie?”

Evelyn nearly scoffed. Since when did she like curry?

Across the table, Mrs. Blackwood’s face twisted in displeasure. “Eat it or don’t. I don’t care.”

“Evelyn.” Alexander’s voice was sharp. “Are you eating or not?”

He was forcing her.

Victoria smirked behind her wineglass.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around her spoon. She didn’t know how to escape this.

She couldn’t eat it.

“Evelyn’s been working hard and barely ate lunch,” Sebastian interjected smoothly. “Spicy food will upset her stomach. Something mild would be better.”

He reached over and placed a serving of steamed vegetables on her plate. “Try this instead.”

Evelyn blinked in surprise. “Thank you, Uncle.”

Alexander’s jaw clenched.

His uncle had chosen to sit beside Evelyn. Now he was serving her food.

A storm brewed in Alexander’s eyes.

“Uncle,” he said coldly, “do you think it’s appropriate to serve my wife?”

His gaze locked onto Evelyn, dark and threatening. “You know what you should be eating.”

A dull ache pulsed in her temples. Since when did she lose the right to choose her own food?

Not wanting to drag Sebastian into this, she forced herself to take a bite of the curry.

Fire exploded in her mouth, burning down her throat. Her stomach twisted violently.

She swallowed, but the heat only spread, churning inside her.

Victoria, ever the instigator, scooped more onto her plate. “Eat it while it’s hot, Evelyn. The flavor’s best when it’s fresh.”

Cold sweat beaded on Evelyn’s forehead. Her stomach cramped.

“Why aren’t you eating?” Alexander demanded.

“She can’t handle the spice,” Sebastian said, noticing her discomfort.

Alexander laughed, sharp and mocking. “Can’t handle it? You devoured those tacos with Nathaniel last time. You seemed fine then.”

The memory stung.

Evelyn picked up the bowl, her fingers trembling.

She took a sip.

Then her stomach rebelled.

Heat surged up her throat—

And she coughed violently, blood splattering onto the table along with the curry.
###Chapter 86

Evelyn wasn't prepared for this. Her hands trembled as she reached for tissues to wipe away the crimson stains.

Panic clawed at her throat. She didn't understand why she was vomiting blood, but she couldn't let Alexander see this.

"Evelyn! I don't care if you refuse to eat, but how dare you ruin my meal!"

Mrs. Blackwood hadn't noticed the blood mixed with the curry Evelyn had expelled. Her finger jabbed the air accusingly.

"Warn me next time before you come! I can't stand the sight of you!"

"Please calm down, Mrs. Blackwood." Victoria rushed to comfort her, but not before flashing Evelyn a triumphant smirk.

She'd seen the blood clearly.

Victoria knew Evelyn couldn't undergo tumor surgery anymore. Trigger foods like this would only accelerate her demise.

If Evelyn died, the path to becoming Alexander's lawful wife would finally open.

"Are you trying to disgust me on purpose?" Alexander's roar shook the dining room.

Evelyn clutched her burning stomach, keeping her mouth shut. The metallic taste lingered, threatening another wave.

"Alexander, don't be angry. Evelyn didn't mean to." Sebastian's calm voice held genuine concern. "Are you alright?"

Tears pricked Evelyn's eyes. After everything, the only person who cared was someone she'd met mere days ago.

She swallowed hard and shook her head.

"I'm fine—" The words came out strained.

This only enraged Alexander further. "You play dead when I speak to you, but answer him so eagerly? Evelyn, you're unbelievable!"

He yanked her up violently just as the old master's voice echoed from above.

"What's all this commotion?"

Henry Blackwood squinted sleepily, having just woken from his nap.

"Finished eating? Then go home." His knowing smile landed on Alexander holding Evelyn. "Go make me a great-grandson. I'm waiting for my little Evelyn to give me a chubby heir."

A chubby heir.

Tears spilled onto Alexander's hand.

Alexander suppressed his fury, pulling Evelyn close. "Don't worry, Grandfather. We'll start working on that heir immediately."

His tone was firm, but Evelyn felt the rage vibrating through him.

As they passed Sebastian, Alexander shot him a murderous glare.

The car ride home was silent. The moment they arrived, Evelyn bolted to the bathroom, retching violently.

The blood in the sink turned her ghostly pale. She gripped the marble counter for support.

Was the tumor progressing?

Was this the end?

Her reflection stared back - a hollow-eyed specter.

Alexander's approaching footsteps sent her scrambling to wash away the evidence. She gargled frantically.

No sooner had she finished than Alexander dragged her away.

"Why must you be so revolting, Evelyn? Hmm? Disgusting me isn't enough - you had to do it in front of my family too!"

She collapsed against his chest, head spinning. The fire in her stomach raged on.

She wanted to flee, but Alexander hauled her to the bathtub like a ragdoll. The icy blast from the showerhead hit without warning.

Winter air seeped through the unheated mansion as freezing water pounded her skin.
###Chapter 87

The cold was bone-chilling.

It pierced through Evelyn's chest like an icy dagger, freezing her heart instantly.

Yet part of her wished it would grow colder still. Cold enough to numb every inch of her being.

That way, she wouldn't have to feel anything anymore. Not the physical pain. Not the heartache.

Alexander noticed Evelyn wasn't resisting. He abruptly stopped his actions and yanked her upright as she trembled violently.

Her face had turned ghostly pale, drained of all color. She resembled a lifeless doll, hollowed out and empty.

A sudden fear gripped Alexander. "Evelyn! Evelyn!"

He called her name repeatedly, but she remained unresponsive.

"Evelyn, don't you dare die on me! Answer me!" His heart pounded erratically, an unfamiliar terror consuming him.

When she still didn't react, he scooped her up and deposited her on the bed.

He rushed to fetch clean clothes, but when he turned back, Evelyn had sat up.

Alexander felt deceived. He threw the garments aside and stormed over, seizing Evelyn's shoulders.

"Evelyn, you were faking it!" he snarled through clenched teeth.

Evelyn's shaking form was trapped in Alexander's iron grip. Only the sharp pain kept her from slipping into unconsciousness.

"Tell me," he demanded. "Are you conspiring with Sebastian? Why else would someone like him show you such attention?"

His accusation almost made Evelyn laugh.

What he perceived as Sebastian's concern was merely his ignorance of her suffering.

"What's so funny? Answer me! Do you have feelings for him?" Alexander's eyes burned with dangerous intensity, slightly glazed from alcohol.

Evelyn lifted her dazed eyes and smirked. "Yes, I do. He's kinder, more mature than you. Actually cares about me too. Why wouldn't I fall for a man like that? Since you despise me, I should find someone who values me."

"Evelyn!" Alexander exploded.

Though drifting in and out of consciousness, the venom in his voice snapped her fully awake.

His rage had reached its boiling point.

In his fury, Alexander tore at Evelyn's clothes and bit down hard on her collarbone.

Pain shot through her nerves. He shoved her backward when she lacked the strength to resist.

She couldn't fight against Alexander's brutal punishment. It felt like he wanted to destroy her completely, denying her even a moment to breathe.

This man's violent mood swings terrified her.

In good moments, he'd prepare breakfast with his own hands.

In bad ones, he might actually kill her.

Evelyn feared she wouldn't survive this. Feared she'd die before getting her revenge. She couldn't die like this.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said calmly when he moved against her, "are you certain you want to touch a filthy, worthless woman who loves another man?"

Alexander froze at her words, his desire evaporating instantly.

She claimed to love someone else.

Meeting his furious gaze, Evelyn gathered her courage. "Alexander, let's get divorced."
###Chapter 88

The moment the words left her lips, the air between them turned to ice.

Alexander loomed over Evelyn, his dark eyes burning with fury. "What did you just say? Repeat it."

"Divorce." Evelyn didn't hesitate. The word was sharp, final.

Silence stretched between them, thick and suffocating. Then, Alexander let out a cold, mocking laugh. His gaze was blacker than the devil's, promising nothing but torment.

"Divorce?" His voice was a blade, cutting through the tension. "You think I'd ever let that happen?"

Evelyn's heart cracked a little more.

"You were the one who begged to be my wife," he continued, his lips curling into a cruel smirk. "Consider this your wish granted."

She swallowed hard, fighting back the tears. "I don't want it anymore. Alexander Blackwood, I want a divorce."

"Dream on." His fingers dug into her jaw, forcing her to meet his gaze. "Is this because you've found another man? Evelyn, have you no shame?"

Have you no shame?

The words carved into her like a knife. His insults came effortlessly, each one more vicious than the last.

"You claimed you carried my child three years ago," he sneered. "You made me pay for its death. But now I wonder—was it even mine? With all the men you've entertained, how could you possibly know?"

Evelyn's hands trembled violently. The pain in her chest was unbearable, as if her heart had been ripped open.

She clenched her teeth, her red-rimmed eyes burning into his.

Alexander scoffed, releasing her with a look of disgust. "Save your pathetic act. A woman like you belongs behind bars."

He turned and walked away, his footsteps echoing like a death knell.

Evelyn watched him go, her vision blurring. The moment he was out of sight, she doubled over, coughing violently. Blood splattered onto her palm.

Her stomach burned. The tumor gnawed at her insides. She curled into herself, fingers twisting into the sheets.

The pillow still smelled like him—his cologne, his warmth. It was poison, seeping into her veins, destroying her from within.

She had once believed their love would be legendary.

Instead, all he'd given her was agony.

Evelyn spent the entire day in bed, unnoticed.

She searched her symptoms online—acute gastric mucosal lesions. Too afraid to face a doctor, she dragged herself to the pharmacy instead.

If the worst came, she still had a few months left.

The weekend passed in a haze. She changed the bloodstained sheets, packed a small bag, and fled to Olivia’s apartment.

By Monday, she forced herself back to work. Her colleagues treated her kindly—except for Catherine, whose mood swings had grown more erratic.

At lunch, Evelyn returned Sebastian’s freshly laundered jacket.

He was on the phone when she entered, but motioned for her to wait.

When he hung up, she handed him the neatly folded garment. Sebastian smiled. "You actually washed it?"

"I keep my promises," she said softly. "Besides, you only got coffee spilled on you because of me."

"What kind of man would I be if I stood by and did nothing?"

His words warmed her, if only for a moment.

Then she remembered the man who had once promised to protect her forever—and her heart shattered all over again.
###Chapter 89

"You don't look well."

Evelyn flinched when Sebastian spoke, her fingers brushing self-consciously over her pale cheeks.

Of course she didn’t look well. Her health had been deteriorating steadily, and the exhaustion was written all over her face.

"Are you feeling alright?" His concern was genuine, his voice softening.

"Thank you, Mr. Whitman. I’m fine."

She forced a polite smile before standing, guilt gnawing at her. The last thing she wanted was to drag Sebastian into the mess Alexander had created.

"You can drop the formalities when we're alone."

Evelyn hesitated. "I should get back to work... Uncle."

His lips quirked. "I’m only three years older than Alexander. 'Uncle' makes me feel ancient. Just call me Sebastian."

She blinked, then nodded. "Then I’ll return to my desk, Mr. Whitman."

Sebastian chuckled. "Go ahead."

Work was the only escape.

Drowning herself in designs and deadlines kept the pain at bay. Their month-long project was halfway done, and Evelyn was proud of her contributions.

After finalizing her latest draft, she sent it to Catherine Winslow via company email, then grabbed her purse for lunch.

The elevator doors slid open—and there he was again.

Sebastian’s eyes flicked to her bag. "Heading out? Join me."

Other employees crowded the space, their curious stares prickling Evelyn’s skin.

"Don’t leave me hanging, niece-in-law," he teased, diffusing the tension.

Her smile was tight. "Thank you, Mr. Whitman."

She followed him out, the weight of judgmental gazes burning into her back.

Five-star restaurants weren’t her scene.

Evelyn perched awkwardly across from Sebastian, her fingers fidgeting with the napkin. The view from their window seat showcased the bustling city below.

She let him order for her. When the food arrived, the aroma was intoxicating.

"Eat up. You’re too thin," he murmured.

"Thank you." She kept her eyes down, unused to such luxury.

Sebastian studied her. "Alexander never brought you here? He’s a regular."

Her fork stilled. "We never dined alone."

His brows lifted. Before he could respond, two figures materialized beside their table.

Alexander. And Victoria.

Victoria clung to his arm, her laughter like shattered glass in Evelyn’s ears. The juice in her mouth turned bitter.

Alexander’s gaze locked onto hers—sharp, accusing, as if she were the one at fault.

Victoria offered Sebastian a saccharine smile. "Uncle, I owe you an apology. That day... I wasn’t myself. But Evelyn provoked me. After everything—the plagiarism, losing our baby—how could I stay calm?"

She painted herself the victim, draping her sins over Evelyn’s shoulders.

Sebastian’s expression cooled. "I saw the footage. What I witnessed was you assaulting my employee like a common bully."

Victoria’s smile faltered. "Uncle—"

"Don’t call me that."

Her lips trembled as she turned to Alexander. "Darling..."

Alexander’s hand settled on her waist. "Let’s eat first." Then, to Sebastian: "Mind if we join you?"
###Chapter 90

Alexander settled into his seat with practiced ease. Evelyn tugged at his sleeve with feigned hesitation.

"Alexander, I don't think this is wise. Sophia doesn't seem happy about this arrangement."

Evelyn's fingers twitched around her juice glass, resisting the violent urge to hurl its contents across Victoria's perfectly made-up face. Which of the woman's scheming eyes had detected any displeasure?

The silence stretched until Alexander's cool voice cut through. "What right does she have to object?"

A bitter laugh caught in Evelyn's throat.

Right. What right indeed?

She'd always been nothing to him.

Victoria preened at Evelyn's silence, setting her designer purse down with deliberate care. Her smug expression faltered when Alexander chose the seat beside Evelyn instead.

Both women startled at the unexpected move.

Logically, as husband and wife, his seating choice made perfect sense. Victoria's lips pursed, but she dared not protest, settling instead beside Sebastian with poorly concealed irritation.

When the food arrived—all Victoria's favorites—Evelyn's appetite vanished. She'd promised herself indifference, yet her traitorous heart kept bleeding fresh wounds.

Alexander slid a spicy dish toward her with deliberate provocation. "I ordered this specially for you."

Evelyn blinked in confusion.

His smirk held cruel amusement. "You love spicy food, don't you? Especially those street tacos drenched in hot sauce."

The reference to her shared meal with Nathaniel on that sidewalk stall months ago struck like a physical blow. That he'd weaponized such a mundane memory shocked her.

"Maddie, Alexander went through such trouble," Victoria simpered. "You must try some."

Evelyn's answering smile held knives. "How could I possibly eat with a mistress at my table?"

Victoria's face darkened instantly. Alexander's fork clattered against his plate. "Must you always create drama?"

"Dare I?" Evelyn's brittle laugh barely concealed her pain. "When my husband finally dines with me, I'm too overwhelmed with joy to eat."

Alexander's icy gaze pinned her. "If you're happy, then eat."

"Your kindness touches me, darling," she demurred, pushing back her chair. "Mr. Whitman, thank you for lunch. I should return to work."

Sebastian nodded his assent.

The window seat trapped her. To leave meant passing Alexander. Her pulse stuttered as she requested passage once, twice—each plea ignored while Victoria watched with barely concealed glee.

"Alexander Blackwood," Evelyn snapped on the third attempt, cheeks flaming. "Move."

He finally looked up, feigning surprise. "Were you addressing me? I thought you meant that other Mr. Whitman."

The petty cruelty stole her breath. When he finally rose, his next words shocked her. "I'll drive you back."

Victoria's protest came shrill and immediate. "But our shopping plans!"

"Wait here." Alexander dismissed her without a glance, already steering Evelyn away.

"I can manage alone," she protested, wary of his sudden attention.

His grip tightened. "Would you prefer Sebastian escort you? Or perhaps another Mr. Whitman?" The unspoken accusation hung between them.

Too exhausted to fight, Evelyn relented. The sight of Victoria's furious pout sparked vicious satisfaction.

The car ride became another battlefield. "Stay away from Sebastian," Alexander warned, voice devoid of warmth.

"Why?" Evelyn blinked with faux innocence. "When my husband parades his mistress publicly, why can't I dine with your uncle?"

Alexander stilled, thrown by her defiance. Sunlight caught the delicate makeup highlighting her delicate features, the luminous eyes that once adored him. For two heartbeats, he faltered before his expression hardened.

"Is this how you seduced him?" He seized her chin. "Playing the wounded innocent?"

Evelyn smiled through the pain. "Whatever helps you sleep at night, Mr. Blackwood."

"Evelyn!" Fury ignited in his gaze. Instead of the expected punishment, he bent and bit her neck—hard.

She gasped, struggling against his immovable grip. When he finally released her, the winter air did nothing to cool the heat flooding her cheeks.

Alexander yanked away her scarf, leaving the vivid mark exposed. "No more scarves," he decreed, satisfaction dripping from each word.

"What do you want from me?" she whispered.

His reflection smirked in her widened pupils. "Wasn't begging to be mine your life's prayer? As your husband, don't I have rights?"

The technical truth burned. They were still married, despite everything.

"The office awaits," she deflected, wrenching free. "Your beloved is waiting."

Instead of releasing her, Alexander hauled her closer, breath hot against her ear. "Why so eager to push me toward her? Wasn't your love confession sincere? Or is this your twisted version of devotion?"

Her traitorous heart pounded wildly. Just as dizziness threatened, he released her.

She'd barely straightened her clothes when Sebastian's silhouette appeared at the restaurant doors. The sight doused her like ice water.

How foolish to imagine jealousy. This was pure possession—marking territory.

"Uncle Sebastian," Alexander's voice dripped false courtesy. "I entrust my wife to your care."

"Of course," Sebastian answered smoothly.

The bandage covering Alexander's mark itched. Evelyn focused on her work until an onslaught of vicious texts arrived—all condemning her for seducing Alexander. Only Victoria could orchestrate such harassment.

The servants' summons to Blackwood Estate provided escape. She stopped for Henry Blackwood's favorite pastries, steeling herself.

The foyer revealed Victoria lounging on the sofa, Ethan napping beside her. The child's innocent face lanced through Evelyn's defenses, resurrecting memories of her own lost baby.

Victoria's greeting held mock surprise. "The old bastard isn't here," she sneered when Evelyn moved toward the stairs.

Evelyn whirled. "He's Alexander's grandfather!"

"Semantics." Victoria examined her nails. "That meddling fossil delayed my marriage. Pity his heart gave out—hospital beds suit him better."

"Grandfather's hospitalized?" Dread pooled in Evelyn's stomach. "Which hospital?"

Victoria's laugh chilled. "Why should you know? Who do you think you are?"

Suddenly advancing, knife in hand, Victoria hissed, "Look at you—pathetic and reeking of poverty. Alexander only toys with you!"

Evelyn's chuckle held no mirth. "Then why the hysterics? Why waste money on those texts?"

Victoria's smirk turned feral. "Important business, obviously." She seized Evelyn's wrist. "How many times must I warn you? Remember prison? Your aborted bastard? Your grandfather's 'accident'?"

The pieces crashed together. "You killed Grandfather!"

"Pity he uncovered certain truths," Victoria whispered, eyes gleaming with malice.

When Victoria suddenly retreated toward Ethan, Evelyn's blood ran cold. The knife flashed—

"Stop!"

Ethan's scream mingled with Evelyn's shout. Blood bloomed across his cherubic cheek.

Before Evelyn could react, Victoria forced the knife into her hand and began shrieking, "How could you hurt my child!"

The servants and Margaret Blackwood came running. "My grandson!" Margaret wailed. "You monster!"

Alexander's entrance coincided with Victoria's tearful accusation. His gaze locked onto the bloody knife and Ethan's wound. Darkness descended over his features.

"It wasn't me!" Evelyn pleaded.

His response came in the form of a brutal kick that sent her crashing into the coffee table. Margaret's subsequent shove split Evelyn's forehead open.

"My heart hurts!" Victoria wailed theatrically. "Why does Evelyn torment me?"

Alexander's promise to make the "culprit" pay sealed Evelyn's fate. Victoria's triumphant smirk confirmed the horrifying truth—she'd mutilated her own child for revenge.

At the hospital, Evelyn secretly donated blood when Victoria fabricated excuses. Weak from blood loss, she overheard Victoria's phone call: "That brat should've died years ago!"

Emerging, Evelyn struck Victoria hard. "Not even animals harm their young!"

Victoria's retaliation came via staged assault—hair mussed, clothes askew—just as Alexander arrived.

"Help! She attacked me!" Victoria's Oscar-worthy performance had the crowd turning on Evelyn.

Alexander's glacial tone spelled doom. "Evelyn Sinclair."

Each syllable landed like a hammer blow.

Victoria's tearful manipulation—"She said since she lost a child, she'd make me suffer too!"—ignited Evelyn's rage.

"You dare mention them?" Evelyn launched herself at Victoria, raining blows until Alexander intervened.

His shove sent Evelyn sprawling. The look he gave her could've frozen hell over.

The drive to the cemetery passed in a haze of pain. When Alexander ordered the graves destroyed, Evelyn's screams went unheeded.

"Now you understand loss," he murmured as workers smashed the urns.

Her grandfather's ashes scattered before she could react. But when Alexander reached for the smaller urn—

"No! That's your daughter too!"

His sneer preceded the shattering glass. "I have one child—Ethan Blackwood."

Evelyn's world shattered with the urn. Crawling through the ashes, she whispered her vengeance through bloodied lips: "You'll regret this."

"Regret doesn't exist in my vocabulary."

When he moved toward Henry's remains, Evelyn threw herself over the urn. "Kill me too, then!"

Something in her defiance gave him pause. The bodyguard's raised fist met Alexander's interception. "Who told you to touch her?"

Suddenly, he stormed off, leaving Evelyn broken amidst the ruins.

Victoria appeared like a specter, knife glinting. "Tsk tsk. Still breathing?" The blade carved an X into Evelyn's cheek.

Agony blurred her vision, but Evelyn refused to scream. "Just kill me."

"Where's the fun in that?" Victoria's parting kick left Evelyn semiconscious beside the shattered urn.

Snowflakes melted against her wounds as memories of happier times with Alexander played behind her eyelids—illusions as fleeting as the snow.

Three days passed in oblivion. Olivia's tearful face greeted Evelyn's awakening.

"If there's a next life," Evelyn rasped, "let's be sisters."

"I want this life!" Olivia sobbed.

Evelyn's smile held infinite weariness. "This life... is already so long."

Returning to work with her scar exposed invited whispers. The viral video of her "attacking" Victoria painted her the villain. Even Catherine's defense—"Those videos are fake!"—masked morbid curiosity.

Evelyn leaned into the persona. "Oh, I hit her. I'd kill her given the chance."

Their horrified retreat amused her.

Sebastian's office provided respite. His genuine concern at her scars almost undid her. "I'm resigning," she announced.

"Because of the gossip? I don't believe it."

Those three words—long craved from Alexander—nearly broke her.

"The annual gala," Sebastian insisted. "You'll accompany me."

The absurdity stung. What right had a scarred woman beside such a man?

Alexander's car awaited her return home. Frozen with terror, she hid until his phone provided escape.

The man who'd shattered her daughter's ashes no longer deserved her fear. Only vengeance remained.
###Chapter 91

"I'll take you home."

Evelyn froze in surprise.

Victoria's face twisted with shock before melting into a pout. "But Alexander, you promised we'd go shopping together."

"You can wait here." Alexander strode toward Evelyn without glancing back at Victoria. "Let's go."

"That's unnecessary. I can manage." Evelyn quickly refused. She couldn't decipher Alexander's motives, but the tension made her skin prickle.

"Would you prefer someone else escorting you? Perhaps another Mr. Blackwood?" His piercing gaze conveyed the unspoken threat.

Too exhausted to argue, Evelyn relented and let Alexander lead her away.

She couldn't suppress the petty satisfaction when she glimpsed Victoria's furious expression over Alexander's shoulder.

The car ride became another opportunity for Alexander to issue warnings.

"Stay away from Sebastian," he commanded, voice icy. "No more cozy dinners."

"Why?" Evelyn blinked up at him with feigned innocence, voice dripping honey. "You're my husband, yet you embrace other women publicly. Why can't I share a meal with a friend?"

Alexander stilled, visibly startled by her defiance.

Moonlight illuminated her delicate features - the subtle makeup enhancing her porcelain skin, her eyes sparkling with quiet rebellion. She looked both vulnerable and dangerous.

For two heartbeats, he seemed disarmed before his expression hardened again. His fingers gripped her chin roughly. "Is this how you enchant men? Playing the wounded dove?"

Evelyn smiled through the pain. "Believe whatever comforts you, Mr. Blackwood."

"Evelyn!" His fury burned like wildfire.

Instead of the expected punishment, he suddenly bent to sink his teeth into the tender skin of her neck.

She gasped, shoving against his chest only to find herself pinned against the car.

After what felt like eternity, he released her.

Winter air should have chilled her, yet Evelyn's entire body burned.

Alexander yanked away her scarf, proudly displaying the vivid mark he'd left. "No more scarves," he declared, leaving no room for argument.

Evelyn's pulse raced. "What do you want from me, Alexander?"

His smirk reflected darkly in her widened eyes. "You begged to be mine. Shouldn't a husband claim what's his?"

Her cheeks flamed. Technically, he wasn't wrong.

"I need to get to work!" She struggled in his grasp. "Your precious Victoria is waiting."

Instead of releasing her, Alexander pulled her closer, his breath hot against her ear. "Why so eager to push me toward her? I thought you loved me. Is this your idea of devotion?"

Evelyn's heartbeat drowned out all other sound. Just as she thought she might combust, he stepped back.

Fumbling with her clothes, she turned - and froze.

Sebastian stood at the restaurant entrance, watching them with unreadable eyes.
###Chapter 92

Evelyn felt her pounding heart suddenly still, the fiery heat draining from her body as ice replaced the blood in her veins.

How laughable.

To imagine for even a second that Alexander had been jealous. What utter nonsense.

This was simply the behavior of a possessive alpha male marking his territory.

She was nothing more than a pawn in his twisted game.

A bitter smile curved Evelyn's lips as she sensed Alexander approaching from behind. "I'll entrust my wife to your care, Uncle Sebastian. Thank you in advance for looking after her," he said smoothly.

Sebastian gave a polite nod. "Naturally."

Though Evelyn hadn't purchased another scarf, she did acquire bandages to conceal the angry red mark Alexander had left on her skin.

Settling at her desk, she attempted to focus on work. Soon her phone buzzed relentlessly with venomous texts from unknown numbers, all condemning her for seducing Alexander.

Only one person would orchestrate such harassment - Victoria.

This reaction confirmed Victoria must have witnessed Alexander pinning her against the wall earlier.

Evelyn silenced her phone and returned to her tasks.

Later, Blackwood Estate servants summoned her for dinner.

She'd planned to visit Grandfather Blackwood anyway, given his recent declining health.

After clocking out, Evelyn stopped to buy the old man's favorite pastries before boarding the bus to Blackwood Estate.

The grand doors swung open to reveal Victoria lounging on the sofa, lazily eating fruit. Beside her, little Ethan slept soundly against a velvet bolster.

The sight of the child sent an uncontrollable pang through Evelyn's heart.

The pain always came first, followed by memories of that terrible night when her labor was induced, and the baby she never held.

"Hello." Victoria showed no surprise at Evelyn's arrival.

Ignoring her, Evelyn moved further into the mansion. As she approached the staircase to find Grandfather Blackwood, Victoria's venomous voice stopped her. "The old bastard isn't here."

Evelyn whirled around at the disrespectful words.

"That's still Alexander's grandfather, Victoria! How dare you speak of him that way? What if the Blackwoods hear you?"

Victoria snorted derisively. "What's wrong with calling a bastard a bastard? Does it upset you, Evelyn?"

"Victoria—"

"I would've been Mrs. Blackwood years ago if not for that meddling old fool. Though I suppose it's working out now that his weak heart landed him in the hospital."

"Grandfather had a heart attack? He's hospitalized?" Dread pooled in Evelyn's stomach. "Which hospital is he at, Victoria?"

"Pfft." Victoria's cold laugh sent chills down Evelyn's spine. "Who are you to demand that information? What makes you think you deserve to know?"

Tossing aside her fruit knife, Victoria advanced like a predator cornering prey.

"Look at you, Evelyn - pathetic and reeking of poverty. How dare you steal my man? Did you actually think Alexander's little display today meant anything? You're just a temporary distraction to him!"
###Chapter 93

Victoria lifted her chin arrogantly, glaring at Evelyn with barely contained fury. The humiliation from Alexander's actions earlier that afternoon still burned through her veins.

Evelyn let out a soft, mocking laugh. "If you're so certain he only kissed me as a joke, why are you this angry? Why waste money sending me those threatening messages?"

"You—" Victoria's words caught in her throat like shards of glass.

The realization struck Evelyn like lightning. "That's why you had the Blackwood servants summon me? What exactly do you want?"

"Something important, obviously." Victoria's lips twisted into a sinister smile as she suddenly grabbed Evelyn's wrist, her nails digging deep. "Why won't you disappear already, Evelyn? How many times must I remind you that Alexander belongs to me? You know what happens to women who steal from me."

"Have you forgotten why you went to prison? Forgotten how Alexander made sure you lost that bastard child in your womb to comfort me? Forgotten how your deranged grandfather died?" Victoria's smile turned demonic before Evelyn's eyes.

Evelyn's vision swam with torturous memories at Victoria's words, especially the mention of Grandfather Henry's death.

"It was you—" Blood roared in Evelyn's ears. "Victoria, you murdered Grandfather—"

"Not my fault he discovered things he shouldn't have." Victoria's whisper dripped with malice, her dark eyes gleaming with wicked satisfaction.

A violent shiver ran down Evelyn's spine. As she opened her mouth to retaliate, Victoria shoved her backward.

Caught off balance, Evelyn stumbled back just in time to see Victoria snatch the fruit knife from the coffee table.

For a heart-stopping moment, Evelyn thought Victoria would attack her. Instead, the blade flashed toward little Ethan sleeping peacefully on the sofa.

"Victoria, stop!" Evelyn's scream tore through the room as Ethan's piercing cry of pain followed.

Blood bloomed across the child's angelic cheek, the crimson stark against his pale skin. Evelyn's heart shattered at the sight.

Even wild animals protected their young. How could Victoria—

She lunged forward to help Ethan, but Victoria trapped her wrist, forcing the knife into her hand. With theatrical sobs, Victoria clung to Evelyn with surprising strength, making escape impossible.

"Evelyn! How could you? Hurt me if you must, but leave my son alone!" Victoria's wails echoed through the mansion.

Evelyn stared in horrified disbelief.

This was Victoria's game all along.

The commotion brought the household staff and Margaret Blackwood rushing downstairs.

"My precious grandson!" Margaret gasped, clutching her chest. "Evelyn Sinclair, you monster! Attacking an innocent child!"

As if on cue, Alexander strode through the doors just as his mother's accusations reached their peak.

"Alexander!" Victoria wept dramatically. "Evelyn tried to kill Ethan!"

Alexander's stormy gaze took in the bloody knife and his son's bleeding face. His expression darkened like thunderclouds.

Evelyn's pulse hammered against her ribs as the color drained from her face. "It wasn't me, Alexander! I would never—"

His murderous glare froze the words in her throat. "You're dead."

"Alexander, please—"

The brutal kick sent her flying across the room before she could finish.
###Chapter 94

Evelyn's side collided violently with the sharp edge of the coffee table as she tumbled to the floor.

A searing pain shot through her abdomen, radiating outward in pulsing waves that made her whole body tremble.

She struggled to rise, her limbs shaking, only to be shoved back down by Margaret Blackwood before she could steady herself.

"You vile creature! If anything happens to my grandson, I'll ensure you suffer beyond imagination!" Margaret's voice cut like ice as she delivered another forceful push.

Already unsteady, Evelyn crashed to the ground again. This time, her temple struck the table's corner with a sickening thud.

Warm blood trickled down her forehead as dark spots danced across her vision. The world spun around her.

"My heart is breaking, Alexander! Why must Evelyn torment me like this?" Victoria began wailing dramatically, clutching her chest.

Alexander's gaze burned with fury as it swept over Evelyn one final time before he turned to scoop up a pale Ethan.

"Don't worry, our son will be fine," Alexander murmured to Victoria while striding toward the door. "And I'll make certain the perpetrator pays dearly for this."

His promise hung in the air like a death sentence over Evelyn's head.

Dizzy with pain, Evelyn forced herself upright. Her heart clenched when she caught Victoria's triumphant smirk over Alexander's shoulder.

The realization struck like lightning - Victoria had mutilated her own child's face to frame her. What kind of monster could do such a thing?

The image of sweet little Ethan's angelic face, possibly scarred forever, made Evelyn's chest constrict painfully.

After discreetly following them to the hospital, Evelyn had her forehead wound hastily treated before rushing to the emergency ward.

She arrived just as a nurse hurried out, looking frantic.

Victoria grabbed the nurse's arm, tears streaming down her cheeks. "How's my baby? Will there be scarring?"

"Scarring is the least concern right now. He's lost significant blood and needs a transfusion, but we don't have compatible blood in stock. As his mother, you could—"

Victoria's expression flickered before she interrupted dramatically. "Take my blood! Take all of it if it'll save my son!"

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud at the performance.

Such transparent theatrics.

Yet Alexander seemed to find it utterly convincing.

Frowning, he approached Victoria. "Victoria..."

"I won't let anything happen to our boy, Alexander!" Victoria declared tearfully before following the nurse.

She returned moments later, sobbing. "The doctor refused, Alexander! I can't donate while menstruating!"

Clutching Alexander desperately, she wailed, "What will we do? What if Ethan dies? How could Evelyn be so cruel? Why hurt our innocent child?"

Evelyn watched as murderous rage darkened Alexander's features.

Her stomach twisted as she turned away, heading straight for the blood donation center.

Knowing she shared Victoria's rare RhAB blood type, Evelyn could save Ethan.

After brief consultation, the doctor assured her weakened condition wouldn't prevent donation.

Evelyn gave 500cc of her blood - enough to leave her barely able to stand, let alone walk.

The world blurred at the edges as she slumped against the wall, drained in every sense. Yet through the haze, one thought remained clear: she'd saved Ethan, even if no one would ever know.
###Chapter 95

Her footsteps dragged as she turned to leave, only to freeze when Alexander's commanding voice cut through the sterile hospital air.

"Someone donated blood for my son? Who was it?"

"Oh, that woman over there."

Evelyn's breath hitched. She ducked into the emergency stairwell before Alexander could spot her.

The thought of him rejecting Ethan's life-saving transfusion because it came from her made her stomach churn. But saving the boy mattered more than her pride.

Pressed against the cold concrete wall, Evelyn watched Alexander's shadow pass the doorway. She curled into herself, teeth chattering from blood loss and exhaustion.

Every muscle screamed in protest. The gash on her forehead throbbed. Still, she waited until his footsteps faded completely before allowing the darkness to claim her.

Morning light stabbed her eyes when she awoke. Her legs screamed from being folded beneath her all night. Using the wall for support, she staggered upright just as Victoria's shrill voice echoed down the corridor.

"That little bastard should've died! Some meddling bitch had to interfere." Victoria's manicured nails tapped against her phone. "If he'd just bled out, Alexander would've destroyed Evelyn completely."

Evelyn's blood ran colder than the hospital tiles. What kind of mother spoke about her own child that way?

Before she could stop herself, Evelyn stormed from her hiding place. "You're a monster, Victoria Lancaster! Even wild animals protect their young!"

The slap rang out like a gunshot.

Victoria's perfect features twisted into something grotesque. Then her phone pinged. Reading the message, her lips curled into a viper's smile.

"You'll regret that, you pathetic little mouse."

Evelyn barely had time to blink before Victoria yanked her own hair loose, tore her blouse, and threw herself backward with a theatrical wail.

"Alexander! Help me!"

The hallway erupted into chaos. Nurses gasped. Orderlies froze. And right on cue, Alexander came running.

Victoria transformed instantly - trembling lips, tear-streaked makeup, the perfect victim. "Please," she sobbed into Alexander's chest, "I just want our baby to be safe. Make her stop hurting me!"

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. The performance was flawless. And she'd walked right into the trap.
###Chapter 96

Evelyn threw herself into Alexander's arms, trembling violently as she perfectly played the role of the victim once more.

She had used this same tired act countless times before, yet he still fell for it without hesitation.

All eyes turned to Evelyn Sinclair with contempt and suspicion. Though accustomed to such judgmental stares, she could never grow immune to the murderous chill in Alexander's gaze.

That face she had once loved so deeply now held none of its former tenderness. As Alexander cradled Victoria protectively, his icy glare stabbed through Evelyn like a dagger. "Evelyn. Sinclair!"

He spat out her name through clenched teeth, each syllable dripping with venom.

A bone-chilling cold spread from Evelyn's feet to her entire body. The hatred in his eyes was terrifying.

Victoria sobbed dramatically against Alexander's chest. "How could Evelyn be so heartless? She told me she'd been pregnant too, that her baby died in prison. Having known motherhood, how could she be so cruel to another mother?" Her tear-filled eyes accused Evelyn.

"Evelyn, stop this madness! Do you want your child and grandfather to never rest in peace?" Alexander threatened.

At the mention of her lost loved ones, Evelyn's fists clenched. With sudden strength, her frail body lunged at Victoria.

She grabbed Victoria's collar, shaking her violently. "How dare you speak of my grandfather and child! You're the one who should have died, Victoria! You're the real monster here!"

"Alexander! My face! It hurts!" Victoria shrieked dramatically.

The outburst caught everyone off guard. Alexander hadn't expected Evelyn's sudden fury. It took considerable force to pry her away and shield Victoria in his arms.

Evelyn stumbled back, her spine slamming against the wall. The impact left her doubled over in pain.

Alexander cradled the weeping Victoria, turning to leave. His final glare at Evelyn was like a poisoned arrow aimed straight for her heart.

Physically and emotionally shattered, Evelyn had no strength left to defend herself. She turned away as the crowd's curses followed her.

On her way home, Evelyn's tumor flared with agonizing pain. Her trembling hands fumbled for painkillers when suddenly, a black sedan screeched to a halt before her.

A hulking man emerged, grabbing Evelyn roughly. "Let me go!" she screamed, her pain intensifying with each struggle.

Forced into the car, Evelyn looked up to meet Alexander's glacial stare. Dressed in a sleek black coat, he radiated cold hostility.

Spotting the painkillers, Alexander snatched them away. Seeing the label, he sneered. "So you do know pain, Evelyn? When you stabbed my son and tormented Victoria, did you consider their suffering?"

With a flick of his wrist, he tossed the medication out the window.

Evelyn paled as tumor pain stole her breath. "Drive," Alexander commanded, and the car accelerated.

Though unsure of their destination, Evelyn endured the agony while studying Alexander's stony profile. "Alexander, I know you won't believe me, but I didn't hurt your son. It was Victoria who—"

"Silence!" he roared, his glare murderous. "Another word and I'll throw you from this moving car."
###Chapter 97

Evelyn's lips trembled as she bit back her words. Her gaze drifted toward the window where ominous gray clouds loomed overhead, threatening to unleash their fury.

With each passing mile, the scenery grew increasingly familiar. Evelyn's fingers dug into the leather seat as tension coiled tightly around her spine.

The car lurched to a stop. Alexander exited with effortless grace while Evelyn was hauled out roughly by his security team.

Her breath caught when she recognized their location.

"Alexander! Why would you bring me here?" Her voice cracked as she called after his retreating figure, but the man didn't even glance back.

They'd taken her to the sacred ground where she'd buried both her grandfather and her stillborn child. Her legs gave out completely as the guards shoved her forward.

Collapsing onto the damp earth, Evelyn clutched her abdomen where the tumor throbbed. She swallowed hard against the pain before lifting her tear-filled eyes.

Alexander stood before her like an ice sculpture - beautiful, untouchable, radiating cold fury.

"Why...here?" Evelyn rasped, her vision swimming as misty rain began to fall.

Alexander crouched suddenly, his warm fingers gripping her chin with deceptive gentleness. His striking eyes held a terrifying glint.

"So you can finally understand true despair."

"What?"

The first snowflakes began drifting down, obscuring his cruel expression as Evelyn struggled to comprehend.

"Proceed." He released her abruptly with that single command.

The sharp sound of metal striking stone shattered the silence. Evelyn whirled around to see Alexander's men attacking the gravesite with pickaxes.

Her world tilted violently.

"Stop! Please, don't!" She scrambled to her feet, but Alexander caught her wrist in an iron grip.

"Please, I'm begging you!" Sobs wracked her body as tears streamed down her face.

She turned desperate eyes toward Alexander, but his lips curled in a chilling smile. "Now you know fear? Where was this fear when you harmed my child?"

"Alexander, I swear I never hurt Ethan! Make them stop!"

Every old wound in Evelyn's battered soul screamed in fresh agony. The pain burrowed deep into her bones, more excruciating than any physical torment.

The grave crumbled under the assault. Soon, two urns emerged - one large, one heartbreakingly small.

Evelyn's lungs seized. Her vision blurred as violent tremors overtook her body.

"No...please...I'll admit anything! I'll say I hurt Victoria and Ethan! Punish me however you want, just don't desecrate my grandfather and my baby's resting place!"

She collapsed at Alexander's feet, forehead pressed to the cold ground in abject supplication. She'd confess to any crime, bear any false accusation.

Still, Alexander remained unmoved. He reached down and lifted the smaller urn, examining it with detached curiosity.

Evelyn clutched at his trousers, her face ghostly pale. "Please...that's your daughter too, don't—"

"My daughter?" Alexander's laugh was glacial. "I have one child - Ethan Blackwood. As for this..."

He studied the ashes in the glass vessel for one endless moment before opening his fingers.

The shattering glass echoed like a gunshot as precious ashes scattered across the frozen ground.
###Chapter 98

Evelyn collapsed like a marionette with its strings severed, consciousness slipping away in an instant.

Darkness swallowed her world whole. The excruciating pain—like her skin was being flayed—consumed her entirely.

"No!"

She lunged desperately toward the ashes being washed away by the relentless sleet.

Her anguished sobs tore through the air as her trembling hands scraped against the rough ground, frantically trying to gather what remained.

But the ashes darkened, stained crimson by the blood seeping from her torn palms, dissolving into the icy rain.

Just like that, her last flicker of hope was snuffed out.

She laughed bitterly through her tears, her red-rimmed eyes locking onto Alexander.

She didn’t recognize him anymore.

No—she had never truly known him.

Her jaw clenched as she glared at the man standing cold and unmoved, her gaze sharp as shattered glass.

"Alexander, you will regret this."

At her venomous words, his lips curled into a mocking smirk.

"Regret doesn’t exist in my world."

He signaled to the bodyguard, gesturing toward the urn holding her grandfather’s ashes.

"Bring it here."

Evelyn moved like lightning. She snatched the urn and clutched it to her chest, shielding it with her body.

The bodyguard hadn’t expected her sudden defiance. With a snarl, he lashed out, his boot slamming into her abdomen.

Crack.

The urn hit the ground. The metallic tang of blood flooded her mouth.

But she barely noticed. She scrambled forward, curling over the urn like a wounded animal, teeth gritted.

"Nobody touches my grandfather’s ashes! Alexander, if you want to be this cruel, then grind me to dust too!"

Her scream was raw, her lips smeared with blood, her body trembling violently.

The bodyguard raised his fist—but before it could strike, Alexander caught his wrist in a vice-like grip.

"Back off! Who gave you permission to lay a hand on her?"

His sudden fury was terrifying. With a brutal kick, he sent the bodyguard sprawling.

The storm worsened, sleet turning into a downpour. Alexander crouched beside her, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn was a wreck—her short dark hair matted with snow, her body wracked with shivers, her lips bloodied. Yet she clung to the urn like it was her lifeline.

Something twisted in Alexander’s chest. The woman before him was almost unrecognizable—except for her eyes. Still clear. Still defiant.

Evelyn wasn’t crying anymore. She smiled at him, hollow and broken.

"Alexander, just kill me. I never want to see you again."

He stilled. Then, softly, "Do you finally admit your mistakes?"

Her bloody lips curved. "I do."

Tears shimmered in her eyes as she stared at the man she had once loved with every fiber of her being.

"My greatest mistake was believing your lies… and wasting years of my life loving you."
###Chapter 99

Alexander's brows furrowed as every word from Evelyn's lips struck him like a blade. His heartbeat stuttered, erratic and uncontrolled.

"Alexander, if you don't kill me today, I swear I will make you pay for my child's life."

Her gaze, clear and unyielding, held the same resolve as before.

A cold smirk curled his lips. "I'll be waiting."

With that, he rose and walked away without another glance.

As his retreating figure vanished from sight, Evelyn felt the last of her strength drain away. She slumped against her grandfather's urn, her body numb, her heart hollow.

Tears spilled over, but she barely registered them. The pain had long since dulled her senses.

But fate wasn't done with her yet.

Victoria appeared, a glint of malice in her eyes as she crouched beside Evelyn. A fruit knife glinted in her hand.

She yanked Evelyn's short hair, forcing her head back. "Tsk, tsk. I warned you not to cross me. Are you scared now?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a bitter smile. "Victoria, you venomous snake. If you have the guts, just kill me."

Victoria's laughter was sharp, mocking. "Oh, but death would be too kind. Alexander said you ruined his precious son's face. I think it's only fair I return the favor—doubled."

A searing pain sliced across Evelyn's cheek.

Her body trembled violently, but she refused to make a sound. She clenched her teeth, enduring the agony in silence.

Clang!

Victoria tossed the knife onto the floor in front of Evelyn, then delivered a brutal kick to her ribs.

"Disgusting wretch. You should've died long ago."

With that, she turned on her heel and left.

Evelyn dragged herself upright, her fingers trembling as they brushed the fresh wound on her cheek. The pain was distant, as if it belonged to someone else.

Blood dripped between her fingers, staining the snow beneath her crimson.

At her last gasp, she collapsed against her grandfather's ashes. Snowflakes drifted down, each one a fleeting memory of happier times—times with Alexander.

But like the snowflakes melting in her palm, those moments were gone, leaving only unbearable agony behind.

Evelyn lay unconscious for three days.

When she finally stirred, the first face she saw was Olivia's.

Olivia's eyes were red-rimmed, her expression shattered. She didn't know the full extent of what Evelyn had endured, but the bruises and wounds told enough of the story.

Yet Evelyn only smiled weakly. "Olivia, don't cry for me. If there's a next life, let's be sisters again."

Olivia sobbed, pulling Evelyn into a desperate embrace. "I don't want the next life. I want this one—I want you to live!"

Evelyn's lips parted, her voice barely a whisper. "This life... is already too long."

Her tears had long since dried.

There was nothing left.

After a few days of rest, Evelyn returned to work, the wound on her cheek no longer bandaged but still raw and angry.

Her short hair made it impossible to hide the scar.

Whispers followed her wherever she went.

Two colleagues approached under the guise of concern, but their eyes gleamed with morbid curiosity.

A video of Evelyn attacking Victoria in the hospital had gone viral. The narrative had twisted—now, people believed she'd gotten what she deserved for bullying Victoria.

The stares grew heavier, the questions more pointed.

Only Catherine spoke up, her voice sharp with indignation. "Those videos are fake. Evelyn's scar isn't from some petty revenge. Right, Evelyn?"

But even Catherine's words were laced with curiosity.

Evelyn met their gazes, her smile serene. "That's right. I hit Victoria because she deserved it. And if I could, I'd do far worse."
###Chapter 100

When Evelyn made that statement, the expressions of her coworkers—including Catherine—shifted dramatically. They stared at her as if she were some bizarre creature.

"How heartless can one person be?" Several female colleagues sneered.

"Poor Victoria, having to deal with this lunatic constantly harassing her."

"Exactly! First stealing someone's fiancé, now threatening to kill her? That's beyond twisted!"

"We should keep our distance before she snaps and drags us down with her."

Evelyn sat silently at her desk, absorbing every deliberately projected insult.

She didn't respond. Just stood up abruptly.

The gossiping women scattered like frightened birds, terrified of what the unstable woman might do.

The irony almost made Evelyn laugh. She walked straight to Sebastian's office.

Seeing Evelyn enter, Sebastian rose politely and gestured to a chair.

His gaze caught on Evelyn's gaunt features and the two angry red scars marring her right cheek. He visibly startled.

"What happened?" Genuine concern laced his voice.

Evelyn forced a smile. "It's nothing, Mr. Whitman. I came to resign."

"Resign?" Sebastian studied her carefully. "Why?"

"My presence is disrupting the department. You've seen the rumors circulating about me."

Understanding dawned in Sebastian's eyes.

"Thank you for your kindness during my time here. I'll clear my desk immediately."

"Evelyn."

Sebastian stopped her as she turned to leave.

"I believe you. There's no need to resign."

Evelyn froze, warmth flickering in her eyes.

I believe you.

For years, she'd ached to hear those words.

Yet they came from Sebastian, not Alexander.

"You'll accompany me to the company gala this Friday."

Evelyn gaped at him, her scars throbbing painfully.

How could this disfigured face stand beside such an impeccable man?

She refused instantly. Sebastian remained adamant.

After work, Evelyn wound a scarf tightly around her ruined cheek, keeping her head bowed.

Every woman cherished beauty. Though she'd long stopped caring, no female could accept such disfigurement.

Approaching her apartment, Evelyn spotted a familiar black sedan idling at the curb.

Her feet turned to lead. Her pulse stuttered erratically.

The tinted window lowered, revealing Alexander's chiseled profile. Evelyn ducked behind a pillar, blood draining from her face.

Memories assaulted her—Alexander standing like a demon in the snowstorm, smashing their daughter's urn.

Her lips bled where she bit them. Her hands shook violently.

She couldn't endure more of his cruelty.

Evelyn waited endlessly for him to leave. The car remained.

Only when dusk fell did Alexander finally drive away after taking a phone call.
###Chapter 101

The icy wind cut through Evelyn like a knife, freezing the blood in her veins.

She rushed back to her apartment, throwing clothes and essentials into a suitcase with trembling hands. Before dawn broke, she was gone.

Alexander Blackwood terrified her more than any demon ever could. Death didn't scare her - it was his cruel methods, the way he systematically destroyed everyone she loved before her eyes.

Standing before the mirror, Evelyn traced the faint scar tingling on her skin. She closed her eyes against the memory.

Alexander, how could loving you bring me to this?

As the year drew to a close, Blackwood Enterprises prepared for its annual gala.

Sebastian Whitman had insisted Evelyn accompany him, but she'd refused. Instead, she found herself at a karaoke bar with colleagues from her department.

The private room buzzed with laughter and drinking games. No one noticed Evelyn sitting alone in the corner.

The joyful atmosphere only made her isolation more painful. Slipping away to the restroom, she nearly collided with Alexander in the hallway.

Her heart leapt into her throat. Panicked, she turned and fled.

Alexander ended his phone call just in time to catch a glimpse of a familiar figure disappearing around the corner. Frowning, he followed.

Evelyn reached the safety of the karaoke room, her pulse still racing. Her coworkers remained oblivious, some already passed out drunk on the sofas.

As she sank into her seat, the opening notes of a familiar love song filled the room.

"Evil in Innocence."

The lyrics illuminated on screen mirrored her own tragic story. Unbidden tears welled in her eyes.

Outside the door, Alexander paused. Though he'd never paid attention to Evelyn's voice before, something primal recognized it now.

Through the round window, he saw her perched on a barstool, her frame painfully thin. Even under the dim lighting, he could see the tracks of tears on her cheeks.

"You would know, the cruelest things that have been done to me," she sang, her voice clear and heartbreaking.

Alexander's chest tightened as each word struck like a physical blow.

"It was you, who had turned me into an adult overnight."

Memories of Evelyn saying she hated him, that she didn't love him anymore, flooded his mind.

"Desperate innocence, instantly turning into scars along the way."

He watched her tears fall unchecked, an invisible weight pressing down on his lungs.

"I miss, my stupidity."

The song ended with Evelyn's voice breaking. "Although heaven and earth are not benevolent, if not necessary, wake your defense, wait a minute—"

She left unnoticed, just as she'd arrived.

The cab ride home passed in a blur. As Evelyn fumbled with her keys in the dim hallway, the motion-activated light flickered on.

A nightmare voice spoke from the shadows.

"Evelyn, who gave you permission to leave my sight?"
###Chapter 102

Evelyn's fingers trembled uncontrollably, sending the key clattering to the floor with a sharp metallic clink.

Every wound on her body seemed to awaken simultaneously, the searing pain slicing through her like a thousand knives. The agony threatened to consume her sanity, leaving only one haunting image burned into her mind—Alexander callously smashing the urn containing their child's ashes with his own hands just days before.

The motion-activated lights flickered off, plunging Evelyn's world into darkness.

"Evelyn, I'm speaking to you," Alexander's icy voice cut through the shadows.

She flinched violently at his touch. When his fingers closed around her wrist, she recoiled like a defenseless animal, then suddenly collapsed to her knees before him, forehead pressed desperately against the cold floor.

"Mr. Blackwood, I was wrong! Everything was my fault! I never should have loved you, never should have crossed Victoria!"

"Alexander, please—I beg you—don't hurt anyone else because of me."

"Our child... you destroyed them so cruelly, erased their very existence. I'm pleading with you—spare my grandfather's ashes. I swear I'll never think of you again. I'll sign the divorce papers. I don't want to be your wife anymore—not in this life, not in any lifetime to come. Never again will I be your wife!"

Alexander stared down at the broken woman groveling at his feet, momentarily stunned into silence.

The flickering corridor lights cast shifting shadows across Evelyn's hunched form. This couldn't be the same woman—the proud, defiant Evelyn who'd once vowed revenge if he didn't kill her, who'd sworn to haunt him forever as his wife. Where had that woman gone?

His chest constricted strangely as he hauled her upright.

"Evelyn, what the hell are you doing?"

"Forgive me, Mr. Blackwood! I've displeased you again. I'll disappear immediately!"

Head bowed, she scrambled for the fallen key, fingers shaking as she struggled with the lock. She kept her face averted, refusing to meet his gaze.

She knew how repulsive she must look to him now—the once beautiful face now marred beyond recognition.

The apartment was tiny—less than 20 square meters—but immaculately kept. Yet even this small sanctuary offered no escape. The moment Evelyn turned, Alexander seized her arm.

"Evelyn, where do you think you're going? Did I say you could leave?" His voice held its usual steel.

When she continued avoiding his gaze, something twisted in Alexander's chest. He caught her chin, forcing her face upward.

The angry X-shaped scar glared back at him, the flesh still an angry red.

Two brutal gashes now disfigured what had once been perfection.

His breath caught. An inexplicable sensation crawled through him, like insects burrowing beneath his skin.

Seeing his focus on her scars, Evelyn tried to cover them. "I apologize for offending your sight, Mr. Blackwood. Just let me go, and I'll vanish completely—you'll never have to look at me again."

She struggled weakly, but Alexander pulled her against his chest instead.

"What happened to your face?" The question held genuine confusion. "Evelyn, tell me—who did this to you?"

"I deserved it! Don't trouble yourself, Mr. Blackwood. I won't contaminate your world any longer!" With a sudden burst of strength, she wrenched free and fled into the night.
###Chapter 103

Evelyn fled down the rain-slicked pavement without glancing back. The icy shard in her chest had finally shattered, flooding her veins with glacial despair.

She couldn't bear to face Alexander again. His relentless cruelty had shattered what remained of her spirit, leaving her hollowed out like a storm-ravaged tree.

All she wanted was to disappear.

To vanish completely.

The drizzle intensified as she stumbled toward the crosswalk in a daze. Headlights blinded her as a speeding car refused to slow.

Evelyn froze mid-step, paralyzed beneath the neon glow of streetlights. The city's vibrant pulse mocked her anguish.

If only she could rewrite her story from the beginning...

She squeezed her eyes shut as a horn blared. Suddenly, iron-strong arms yanked her backward just as tires screeched past.

"Evelyn Sinclair!" Alexander's voice cracked like thunder above her. "If you're determined to die, that privilege belongs to me alone!"

His fury jolted her back to reality. In her terror of facing him, she'd nearly chosen permanent escape.

Alexander dragged her back to her dingy apartment. Rain dripped from his coat as he shrugged it off. "Draw a bath," he commanded.

Evelyn blinked in disbelief.

"Must I repeat myself?" His jaw tightened. "This wouldn't be necessary if you hadn't tried to throw yourself into traffic."

She flinched at his touch.

Meeting his gaze with eerie calm, Evelyn wordlessly turned toward the bathroom.

Alexander studied her retreating form. The woman before him moved like a stranger. His attention snagged on the twin scars marring her cheek.

The cramped studio reeked of desperation. Smaller than his walk-in closet. This was where she'd chosen to hide from him?

A leather-bound journal on the rumpled bed caught his eye. He flipped it open, scanning pages until Victoria's name leapt out. Evelyn's meticulous handwriting detailed elaborate revenge fantasies.

She emerged to find him holding her private thoughts. Panic propelled her forward.

Alexander intercepted her grasping hands. "You truly are poison," he hissed, eyes glacial. "That car should have finished you. Living only endangers Victoria."

Before she could protest, he slapped the journal against her face. The impact echoed through the tiny apartment.
###Chapter 104

The sharp edge of the diary scraped against Evelyn's unhealed facial wound, sending a jolt of searing pain through her nerves. Fresh blood welled up instantly, tracing a crimson path down her cheek.

Alexander didn't even glance her way. His muscular frame brushed past her shoulder with deliberate force, sending her slight figure crashing onto the hardwood floor beside the bed. The abandoned diary lay open before her, its pages displaying her own handwriting: "Alex, after all these years, I finally see you again—"

Evelyn's fingers trembled as they hovered over the incriminating words. A hollow laugh escaped her lips, morphing into uncontrollable sobs that shook her entire body. Hot tears streamed down her face, mingling with the blood from her wound.

The salty droplets traveled down her jawline, merging with a single drop of blood before splashing onto the diary page, blurring the affectionate nickname.

Alex.

That name belonged to someone who no longer existed in her heart.

The boy who'd promised eternal love under the golden sunlight had vanished completely from her soul.

———

The infection in Evelyn's facial wound demanded immediate medical attention. As she exited the treatment room, two nurses rushed past her in a flurry of panic.

"Mrs. Kingsley's surgery starts in twenty minutes, but we've exhausted our Rh-negative blood supply! If there's hemorrhaging during the appendectomy—"

"Appendectomies rarely cause major bleeding unless there's a complication," the younger nurse argued. "But look at Mrs. Kingsley—she's turning gray from pain! We can't delay any longer!"

Evelyn's steps faltered. She intercepted the nurses with urgency. "Excuse me—is this Mrs. Kingsley Eleanor Kingsley?"

The senior nurse eyed Evelyn suspiciously. "Yes? If you need assistance, the reception desk—"

Before she could finish, Evelyn was already sprinting toward the blood bank, where Victoria Lancaster's shrill voice pierced through the sterile hallway.

"What kind of third-rate hospital is this? First my son, now my mother! Are you deliberately sabotaging my family?"

Victoria's adoptive mother, Margaret Dawson, stood beside her, nodding vigorously. The accused nurse stood frozen, tears welling in her eyes under the verbal assault.

"Pray nothing goes wrong during Mother's surgery," Victoria sneered. "Or my fiancé will sue this place into oblivion!"

"But Ms. Lancaster, as Mrs. Kingsley's biological daughter, your blood—"

"Absolutely not!" Margaret interjected like a rabid dog. "Victoria's menstrual cycle hasn't ended! She can't possibly donate!"

The excuse struck Evelyn as eerily familiar—the same lie Victoria had used when Ethan needed blood transfusions weeks ago.

Some things never changed. Whether it was her own child or biological mother, Victoria's selfishness knew no bounds.

After the toxic duo departed, Evelyn approached the trembling nurse. "I'm Rh-negative. Test my blood compatibility immediately."

The nurse's tear-streaked face brightened with hope. Within minutes, Evelyn had donated another 500cc.

She lingered outside the operating theater, an inexplicable anxiety gnawing at her. Appendectomies were routine, yet her pulse refused to steady. Why did Eleanor Kingsley's wellbeing matter so much to her? This strange, magnetic pull defied all logic.

Just as she turned to inquire about the surgery's progress, Evelyn spotted Victoria and Margaret charging down the corridor—not toward her, but toward a distinguished gentleman striding past.

"Father! Thank heavens you're here!" Victoria cried, her entire demeanor shifting into that of a distressed daughter.
###Chapter 105

The man standing before her was none other than William Montgomery, Eleanor Kingsley's husband.

Evelyn Sinclair stared at his broad, dependable back, a pang of sorrow twisting in her chest.

She had once yearned for a father's love, but fate had denied her that warmth—just as it had denied her a mother's embrace.

"How is Eleanor's condition?" William's voice was laced with urgency.

Victoria Lancaster's tears spilled over. "I don't know what went wrong. There was a complication during the surgery. She's hemorrhaging—they're still operating!"

"What?" William's face darkened instantly, and he sprinted toward the operating room.

Evelyn's heart stuttered. A complication? That wasn’t supposed to happen.

Her fingers curled into fists, nails biting into her palms. Then Victoria's icy voice cut through the air. "Where did all these RH-negative donors come from? First last time, and now again."

There was no gratitude in her tone—only bitter resentment.

Then again, this was the same woman who had sliced open her own son's cheek without hesitation. Did she even possess a conscience?

Right now, Evelyn's only concern was Eleanor's survival. As she waited, a sharp pain flared in her side—the tumor pressing against her nerves, sending waves of discomfort through her body.

Her hand instinctively reached for the painkillers in her bag, but she froze.

Alexander Blackwood had thrown them away.

A bitter smile touched her lips.

Just then, the nurse Victoria had berated earlier rushed over, beaming. "Miss, thank you for donating blood. Without you, Mrs. Montgomery might not have made it."

Evelyn swayed as she stood, her voice trembling. "How is she? Is the surgery over?"

"Appendectomies are usually minor procedures. If not for the complication, she’d have been out hours ago. Don’t worry—she’s stable now."

Relief crashed over Evelyn like a tidal wave.

Thank God. She was safe.

"Evelyn, so it was you!" Victoria's venomous voice hissed from behind.

Evelyn turned to face her, meeting those cold, arrogant eyes.

"Who asked you to interfere?" Victoria spat. "You’re filthy—how dare you taint my mother with your blood?"

Evelyn laughed darkly. "If I’m filthy, then you’re no better. Or have you forgotten? Your pathetic life was saved by my blood too."

"You—!"

Victoria's eyes burned with rage. She raised her hand to strike Evelyn's injured cheek—but Evelyn caught her wrist mid-air.

"Victoria, search your soul. Do you even have one left? Your son. Your mother. You’d sacrifice them both just to protect yourself. You’re not human anymore."

"Of course I’m human!" Victoria snarled. "But you? You’re a stray dog who doesn’t even know her own parents! Tell me—if my mother knew it was your blood in her veins, wouldn’t she vomit?"

"So you’d rather watch her die than accept my help?"

Furious, Evelyn shoved Victoria away.

Victoria staggered—then, spotting William approaching, she dramatically collapsed to the floor with a cry.

"Victoria!"

Evelyn barely steadied herself when William rushed past her, his face etched with concern as he helped his "fallen" daughter up.

"Are you hurt? Let me see," he fretted.

Victoria had already arranged her features into a mask of pitiful tears. "I’m fine, Father. Please… don’t blame Evelyn."

William’s gaze snapped to Evelyn, his expression hardening. "So you’re Evelyn Sinclair."

His piercing glare bore into her, fury darkening his features.

"You vile creature. First, you torment my daughter. Then, you brutalize an innocent child. You’re not fit to be called human!"
###Chapter 106

Alexander swore viciously.

"No wonder your real parents abandoned you. A monster like you doesn't deserve to breathe the same air as decent people!"

Evelyn's breath hitched.

Over the years, she'd endured countless insults from strangers and ignorant bystanders until she'd grown numb to them.

But each venomous word from Alexander now felt like a thousand razor blades slicing through her flesh. The excruciating pain left her gasping for air.

"Father, please stop. This is my fault. I never should have fallen for Jeremy—" Victoria interjected with feigned remorse.

Alexander's protective instincts flared at his precious daughter's words. "How could this possibly be your fault? The blame lies entirely with this wretched woman!" He glared at Evelyn with undisguised loathing. "If she hadn't stolen Jeremy away, you'd be living happily as a family of three by now."

"Father..."

"Let's go see your mother."

Alexander enveloped Victoria in a paternal embrace, shielding her with his affection.

Before leaving, he turned back to deliver a chilling warning. "If I catch you harassing my daughter again, I won't hesitate to teach you a lesson—woman or not!"

His words struck Evelyn like a physical blow.

Over Alexander's shoulder, Victoria flashed a triumphant smirk.

She'd won again.

The master manipulator had once more concealed her true nature beneath that flawless mask of innocence.

Night had fallen when Evelyn finally stumbled back to her apartment in a daze.

She was mechanically preparing dinner when the doorbell rang.

Turning toward the sound, she opened the door to find Sebastian standing unexpectedly in her doorway.

Snowflakes dusted the shoulders of his charcoal overcoat, his aristocratic features softened by the dim hallway light.

"Mr. Whitman? What brings you here?" Evelyn blinked in surprise.

Sebastian's lips curved into a gentle smile. "When I heard you'd returned alone last night, I grew concerned. I wanted to check that everything was alright."

Evelyn's chest warmed at his kindness. "Thank you for your concern, Mr. Whitman. I'm perfectly fine. Please come in—it's freezing out there."

She ushered him inside, immediately adjusting the thermostat before pouring him a steaming cup of tea.

"You live here?" Sebastian glanced around the modest space.

Evelyn nodded. "It suits my needs."

"What I meant was—as Jeremy's wife, shouldn't you be living together?"

Evelyn's hands trembled at the question, scalding tea splashing onto her skin. She barely flinched at the burn.

"Evelyn, are you hurt?"

"It's nothing serious." She dabbed at the spill with a napkin.

Compared to the agony Jeremy had inflicted, physical pain meant nothing.

Noticing her discomfort, Sebastian tactfully changed subjects. His gaze lingered on the fresh bandage covering part of her face. "Did your facial injury reopen?"

The concern in his voice made Evelyn's throat tighten. She turned away to hide the moisture gathering in her eyes.
###Chapter 107

"It's nothing," Evelyn smiled faintly. "By the way, have you eaten yet, Mr. Whitman?"

Sebastian shook his head. "Why do you ask?"

"Would you like to try something I made? I was just finishing up dinner."

Sebastian inhaled lightly, catching the rich aroma of freshly cooked rice. "Then I’ll gladly accept your invitation."

Evelyn’s mood brightened at his response.

She had originally planned to eat a simple meal and go straight to bed, but now, she quickly prepared two more side dishes.

Once, she had dreamed of the day when the man she loved would come home after work, sit across from her, and enjoy the food she had made with her own hands. They would talk, laugh, and share their day.

She had thought Alexander would be the first to taste her cooking. But fate had other plans. All those hopeful dreams had crumbled like sandcastles, swept away by the cruel winds of reality.

For the first time in a long while, Evelyn found herself with an appetite. Since falling ill, she had barely managed half a bowl of rice per meal, but tonight, she finished everything on her plate.

Perhaps she wasn’t entirely useless after all. At least she could still bring someone a little happiness.

"Evelyn, your cooking is exceptional," Sebastian praised.

"I’m glad you like it, Mr. Whitman."

"Please, call me Sebastian. We’re not at work. Think of me as a friend."

Despite his aristocratic demeanor, his tone was warm, his eyes kind.

A pang of sorrow struck Evelyn’s heart. She hadn’t expected to find genuine kindness in someone when she was so close to the end.

"To be friends with you is more than I could have hoped for." Evelyn lifted her soup bowl with a smile. "Since I don’t drink, let me toast you with soup instead. Thank you, Sebastian, for saving my life and shielding me from that coffee. Just those two acts alone have earned my friendship."

"Actually, it’s more than twice."

Evelyn froze, her spoon hovering mid-air.

She met his gaze, his eyes twinkling with amusement. "Remember that video you received three years ago?"

Sebastian continued, "The one that proved your innocence at Victoria’s mother’s 50th birthday party—when you were falsely accused of stealing that bracelet."

Evelyn’s breath hitched. She could never forget that video!

How could she? The evidence that could have cleared her name had been destroyed by Alexander right before her eyes.

His actions that day had shown her the truth—he cared nothing for her innocence. As long as Victoria was happy, he would turn a blind eye to anything, even if it meant her suffering.

Her heart ached anew, but a strange warmth seeped through the cracks of her pain.

"So it was you…" Evelyn stared at Sebastian, overwhelmed with gratitude.

Even though Alexander had ruined the video, Sebastian’s kindness still deserved her thanks.

"If you really want to thank me, treat me to dinner next time." Sebastian easily read her emotions.

Evelyn laughed softly, nodding. "Not just once—as many times as you’d like, Sebastian."

Click.

The sound of a key turning in the lock cut through their conversation.

Evelyn’s smile vanished as the door swung open—and Alexander stepped inside, holding a key to her apartment.

Her body tensed instinctively, fear shooting through her veins. "How do you have a key to my place? What are you doing here?"
###Chapter 108

Alexander strode in with an icy aura clinging to his broad shoulders, his expression unreadable.

"Alexander." Sebastian acknowledged him.

The man didn't respond. His glacial gaze swept across the dining table before settling on Evelyn's ashen face.

"Evelyn," Alexander's voice dripped with mockery, "why the surprise? As your husband, isn't it natural I'd have the key?"

Her lips trembled.

"Do you make a habit of entertaining men when I'm away?" His smirk deepened as he turned to Sebastian. "Tell me, Uncle Sebastian, do you enjoy this type of woman?"

Evelyn's heart stuttered painfully.

'This type of woman.' The words carved into her like shards of glass.

Her pallor worsened, but she lacked the courage to retaliate. Before him, she was nothing but a trembling sparrow, defenseless and exposed.

"Alexander, you misunderstand," Sebastian interjected calmly. "I came because I was concerned about Evelyn's wellbeing."

A derisive snort. "Concerned? For this scheming, heartless creature?"

Each word was a dagger twisting in Evelyn's chest.

Sebastian frowned. "She's your wife. How can you speak to her like this?"

"Am I wrong?" Alexander closed the distance between them, his whiskey-laced breath fanning Evelyn's cheek. She caught the scent of expensive bourbon mingled with his cologne.

"Tell him, Evelyn," Alexander purred, fingers digging into her chin. "Didn't you scheme your way into my bed with calculated precision?"

The humiliation burned. Evelyn's vision blurred with unshed tears.

"Yes." She forced a brittle smile. "I'm exactly the vile, manipulative wretch Mr. Blackwood describes. I've committed every shameful act imaginable to ensnare you." Her gaze lifted to meet his. "Which is why we'll be divorcing soon."

She expected satisfaction in his eyes. Instead, something darker flickered there—a storm barely contained.

"Divorce?" Alexander's laugh was razor-sharp. "You think you have the right to leave me, Evelyn? You're nothing."

"Alexander, if you truly despise her, divorce benefits you both," Sebastian reasoned.

The temperature in the room plummeted. Alexander's grip on Evelyn tightened as he turned to Sebastian. "Is that what you want, Uncle? To see me discard this broken doll?"

His free hand traced the bandage on Evelyn's cheek. "Though half-ruined, she's still pretty enough, isn't she?" The words were honeyed poison.

Evelyn's wound throbbed as if freshly split open. She bit back a whimper.

"You're drunk, Alexander." Sebastian's frown deepened. "Release her. You're hurting her."

Alexander tilted Evelyn's face toward his uncle. "Tell him, darling. Are you in pain?"

Through the agony, Evelyn managed a strained smile. "I'm fine."

"Evelyn—"

"Please don't worry, Mr. Whitman. I'll survive." Her voice barely shook.

Sebastian hesitated before nodding. "She's just a girl, Alexander. Show some mercy."

The moment the door closed behind Sebastian, Alexander's grip became crushing. "Now, Evelyn," he whispered against her ear, "let's discuss your little performance."
###Chapter 109

With those final words, Sebastian grabbed his overcoat and strode out without a backward glance.

Evelyn watched his retreating figure until he disappeared through the doorway. The light in her hazel eyes dimmed gradually, like a candle being snuffed out.

Only hollow despair remained in her gaze now.

She had no idea what cruel punishment Alexander had in store for her this time. But she knew him too well - his methods would be merciless.

That memory still haunted her nightmares - Alexander standing like a demon in the snowstorm, watching indifferently as their daughter's ashes scattered in the wind. The ghost of his smirk still made her blood run cold.

Noticing Evelyn's red-rimmed eyes still fixed on the door where Sebastian had left, Alexander's temper flared. "Does his departure pain you so much? Evelyn Sinclair, am I invisible to you? I'm your husband."

He shoved her away violently.

Evelyn stumbled and crashed against the sofa armrest, her injured cheek scraping against the hard edge. A sharp pain shot through her jaw, making her teeth chatter.

"Clean up this mess. Whatever you were doing for that man, do it for me now!"

Lowering her lashes, Evelyn gave a bitter smile. "Of course, husband. Your wish is my command. I'll do anything to please you."

The way she said "husband" made Alexander's skin crawl as he watched her rise slowly.

Braving the winter storm, Evelyn went to purchase groceries before returning to prepare an elaborate meal. She drew Alexander's bath exactly to his specifications, moving like an automaton.

She dared not resist. Not when he held all the cards - everyone she cared about was just another pawn in his cruel game.

Just as Evelyn fetched a fresh towel, a searing pain exploded in her abdomen. She doubled over instantly, her face draining of color.

"Evelyn." Alexander's voice cut through the haze of pain.

She tried standing, but the agony pinned her to the cold tiles. Curled into a fetal position, her consciousness began slipping away...

"Evelyn Sinclair, are you ignoring me?"

His impatient tone barely registered. Biting her hand hard, the sharp pain brought momentary clarity. She lifted her head weakly just as Alexander's polished shoes came into view.

He looked down at her crumpled form with open disdain. "What pathetic act is this now? Another performance to manipulate me?"

Gasping for breath, Evelyn pleaded, "Mr. Blackwood...please...the painkillers...on the coffee table..."

Alexander studied her for a long moment before turning away.

When he returned, he dangled the pill bottle tauntingly. "This what you want?" he sneered at her trembling form by the bathtub.

Evelyn nodded weakly, reaching out. "Thank—"

Before she could finish, Alexander's lips twisted into a sadistic smile. He emptied the entire bottle into the toilet and flushed.

The swirling water carried away her last hope. Through blurred vision, she saw Alexander looking down at her like she was gutter trash. "Alexander...I'm really...not well..."

"So?" He chuckled darkly. "A little discomfort never killed anyone. Just like you told Sebastian - you won't die."

Her vision darkened at the edges as silent tears tracked down her cheeks.
###Chapter 110

A bone-chilling cold surged through Evelyn's veins, freezing her blood solid.

She stared blankly at the smirking man before her. In the dim light, he resembled Lucifer himself, cloaked entirely in darkness.

So this was his true desire - to witness her demise.

"Alexander, you'll soon get your wish."

"May you remain this composed when that day comes."

Yet as the thought of leaving this world forever took root, an unexpected reluctance blossomed in her chest.

After everything, she still carried feelings for him.

Hot tears spilled down Evelyn's cheeks, their warmth powerless against the ice in her heart.

"Tears now? Another pathetic performance?" Alexander sneered.

His long fingers gripped her chin, forcing her gaze upward. "Do you think I'm as easily fooled as other men? Your face has healed - why still hide behind bandages? Save your theatrics. They only disgust me!"

As the words left his lips, crimson stains began blooming through the gauze where her tears had fallen.

Alexander's expression shifted instantly. He tore the bandages away, revealing the raw, weeping wound beneath.

The sight struck him like a physical blow. His earlier mockery turned to ashes in his mouth.

"Give those back!" Evelyn snatched the bloodied gauze with trembling hands. "Don't look! Stop staring!"

Clutching her injured cheek, she staggered upright using the wall for support.

Alexander stood frozen as Evelyn fled the room.

Her weakened body swayed dangerously on the staircase. Blood mingled with tears, dripping between her fingers, each drop draining more color from her pallid face.

An internal fire raged through her veins, consuming what little life remained.

Outside, snowflakes drifted down, intensifying the cold seeping into Evelyn's bones.

Her vision blurred as cherished memories surfaced - happier times before everything shattered.

'If only we could have stayed in those golden moments... No separations. No reunions. No torment.'

Her legs finally gave out near a snow-dusted bench. Crimson droplets stained the pristine white.

Through the haze, she heard Alexander shouting her name. Saw him sprinting toward her in panic, gathering her into his arms.

The warmth of his embrace transported her back to another lifetime - when he'd carried her injured form with such tenderness. Nestled against his chest, she'd whispered shyly, "Alex, I want to be with you forever..."

When consciousness returned, daylight streamed through the windows. The first sensation was the searing pain in her cheek.

She moved to touch it, only to find her hand trapped. Turning, she discovered Alexander sharing her narrow hospital bed.

The realization jolted her fully awake. Alexander Blackwood, squeezed onto this tiny bed with her?

His handsome features rested mere inches away, his breath warm against her skin. Her pulse quickened dangerously.

She turned away sharply, yet couldn't ignore his steady breathing at her ear, nor the heat radiating from his broad chest pressed against her back.
###Chapter 111

Evelyn could feel the steady rhythm of Alexander's heartbeat against her back.

What had happened last night?

She struggled to piece together her memories. She recalled fleeing, not wanting Alexander to see her disfigured face. Then darkness had swallowed her consciousness.

Just as she was reconstructing events, Alexander stirred awake beside her.

Startled, Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut. Her pulse raced so violently she feared he might hear it.

Alexander stretched his arm from around her waist and sat up.

Evelyn thought he'd left until she felt his warm breath ghost across her skin. His forehead pressed gently against hers, checking for fever.

She couldn't comprehend this tenderness. Even more unbelievable - he carefully tucked the blankets around her before departing.

Only when the door clicked shut did Evelyn dare open her eyes.

Two medicine boxes sat on the nightstand - anti-inflammatory pills and pain relievers. The wound on her face had been professionally dressed with fresh gauze.

Evelyn picked up the medications with trembling fingers. Impossible.

Then she remembered - in her delirium last night, she'd called Alexander's name before collapsing. Had that stirred some remnant of their old promise in his heart?

Her thoughts spiraled, a dangerous hope flaring briefly before reality doused it.

She had so little time left. Yesterday's excruciating pain confirmed that.

And nothing could bridge the chasm his cruelty had carved between them. She might forgive many things, but never the blood of their child on his hands.

After washing up, Evelyn prepared simple oatmeal.

Sebastian called, his voice laced with concern. He promised to be available whenever she needed help.

On this bleak morning, his kindness felt like sunlight piercing storm clouds.

Though her life was ending, she cherished finding genuine friendship in these final days.

As she lifted the first spoonful, the door burst open.

Alexander stood framed in the doorway, his intense gaze locking onto hers. The spoon clattered into the bowl, splashing hot cereal onto her wrist.

Evelyn gasped, jerking her hand back.

Why had he returned?

She scrambled to her feet, but Alexander caught her arm in an iron grip, yanking her close.

"Can't bear to look at me? Too busy dreaming of Sebastian?" His voice carried an unfamiliar edge.

Evelyn almost laughed at the absurdity. Jealousy? No, this was possessiveness - anger that his discarded toy might belong to another.

Meeting his stormy eyes, she answered bitterly, "Yes, there was once a Sebastian in my heart. But that man died when he murdered our baby in cold blood."
###Chapter 112

Evelyn was certain that Alexander knew exactly who she was referring to when she mentioned Mr. Blackwood.

She had hoped for even a flicker of remorse, a hint of guilt—anything. Instead, she was met with the cold, mocking scoff of a man who had long since hardened his heart.

"Evelyn, you're still clinging to that ridiculous notion, aren't you? Let me make this clear—Alexander Blackwood has only one son, and his name is Ethan Blackwood," he said, his voice dripping with disdain.

His grip on her wrist loosened, and he stepped back, his expression unreadable.

"I'm hungry. Make me some soup," he commanded.

Evelyn clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms. She met his icy gaze with a hollow smile. "I didn't prepare enough for you, Mr. Blackwood. The portion is small. You should leave."

Alexander's eyes darkened, his jaw tightening. "Is that how you speak to me now, Evelyn Sinclair?"

Her pulse spiked, but she refused to let him see her tremble. "Would you prefer I grovel at your feet like I used to? Would that satisfy you?"

The air between them turned frigid.

"Perhaps I should have left you to freeze on the streets last night," he hissed, his voice low and dangerous.

Evelyn laughed bitterly. "Then why didn't you? If my existence torments Victoria so much, why save me? Why not let me die and finally rid yourself of me?"

Something in her words struck a nerve. His expression twisted, a storm brewing in his eyes.

Before she could react, his hand shot out, fingers wrapping around her throat.

Her breath hitched, her vision blurring as pressure built in her skull. But she didn't fight. She didn't beg.

She stared straight into his eyes, her own burning with defiance.

"Go ahead, Alexander. Kill me. When I reach heaven, I'll tell our child that her mother loved her—even if her father never did."

A tear slipped down her cheek.

His grip faltered.

"Your life belongs to me, Evelyn," he growled, releasing her abruptly. "You don’t get to die until you’ve paid for what you did to Victoria and my son."

She gasped for air, her chest heaving.

A bitter smile curved her lips. "And if I die before then? Will you grind my bones to dust, just like you did to your own child? All to make Victoria smile?"

Silence.

His lack of answer was answer enough.

Evelyn laughed, the sound hollow. "Of course. As long as Victoria is happy, nothing else matters, does it?"

The quiet between them was a blade, twisting deeper into her heart.

Yes. He had saved her—not out of mercy, but to prolong her suffering.
###Chapter 113

Evelyn returned to the hospital that day. Not for her own injuries, but to visit Eleanor Kingsley.

The festive spirit of the approaching new year had even permeated the sterile hospital corridors. Twinkling lights adorned the nurses' station, casting a warm glow.

Pulling her scarf higher over her face, Evelyn paused at the florist stand by the entrance. Her fingers hovered over various blooms before selecting delicate pink carnations.

From her purse, she produced a small notecard. With careful strokes, she wrote: "To Mrs. Eleanor Kingsley - Wishing you swift healing and good health." She tucked it securely among the petals.

At the reception desk, Evelyn inquired about Eleanor's room number. The VIP wing, of course.

Yet when she stood before the ornate door, her hand froze mid-air.

No one would welcome her here. This visit would only bring more pain.

Still, some invisible force compelled her to see Eleanor with her own eyes.

Laughter spilled from the room as she hesitated.

"Eleanor, look how our darling girl dotes on you," William Montgomery's proud voice carried through the door. "Her blood saved your life."

Evelyn stiffened. Daughter?

Victoria's saccharine voice chimed in. "Mother Margaret always says I have a giving heart. I donate regularly at the blood bank. When my real mother needed me, how could I hesitate?"

The pieces clicked into place. Of course Victoria had claimed credit for the blood donation.

"What a blessing you are, my dear," Eleanor cooed.

Evelyn's grip tightened around the flowers. A sharp ache pierced her chest, her vision blurring with unshed tears.

"Mother, I'd give my last breath for you," Victoria simpered. "Shall we take some air in the garden?"

"Perfect, darling."

Hearing movement inside, Evelyn spun away. Through her peripheral vision, she caught sight of Victoria pushing Eleanor's wheelchair. The sight burned her eyes.

Once the hallway cleared, Evelyn slipped inside. She placed the bouquet on the bedside table and turned to leave.

Fate had other plans.

Victoria wheeled Eleanor back in unexpectedly. "Evelyn?" Victoria's voice dripped false concern. "Why are you sneaking around Mother's room in disguise?"

She positioned herself protectively before Eleanor. "If you have issues with me, take them up directly. Leave my family out of this."

Evelyn nearly laughed at the theatrics. "I meant no harm. Just wanted to check on Mrs. Kingsley's recovery."

"Evelyn Sinclair, spare us your false concern!" Eleanor spat. "Whether I live or die is none of your business!"

The words lanced through Evelyn's heart, though Eleanor's strong voice at least confirmed her improving health.

As Evelyn turned to leave, Eleanor surged forward in sudden fury. She ripped away Evelyn's scarf and struck her bandaged cheek with shocking force.

"You venomous creature!" Eleanor shrieked. "Victoria may not share my blood, but she's my true daughter in every way that matters! Come at me if you dare scheme again!"

The blow sent Evelyn reeling. Her weakened body collided with the wall, dislodging the gold pendant hidden beneath her sweater. The engraved name "Sophia" glinted in the light as it clattered to the floor—
###Chapter 114

The collision left Evelyn Sinclair dazed, her back pressed against the cold wall as the world spun around her.

She didn’t notice the delicate gold pendant—hidden beneath her clothes for years—slip free from its confines.

But Victoria Lancaster did.

Her sharp eyes locked onto the butterfly-shaped pendant dangling from Evelyn’s neck.

She remembered everything.

Three years ago, when whispers spread that Evelyn might be Eleanor Kingsley’s biological daughter, Victoria had gone to extreme lengths.

She had stolen Eleanor’s toothbrush through Sophia Montgomery’s connections.

She had snatched Evelyn’s discarded clothes for DNA samples.

The results confirmed it—Evelyn was the long-lost daughter William and Eleanor Montgomery had searched for over two decades.

The revelation had filled Victoria with bitter envy—and birthed a wicked plan.

With Margaret Dawson and Richard Montgomery’s help, she staged an elaborate deception, convincing Eleanor and William that she was their missing child.

They had mentioned the pendant back then—a custom-made heirloom, engraved with the name Eveline.

Victoria knew Evelyn had once gone by that name before changing it.

She just hadn’t known her true surname.

Now, seeing the pendant in plain sight, Victoria’s blood ran cold.

Margaret and Richard had claimed to have seen the pendant years ago but didn’t know its whereabouts.

Eleanor and William, too eager to embrace their "daughter," had dropped the matter after the adoption papers were signed.

Victoria had been careful—always watching.

When she first met Evelyn’s grandfather, Henry Whitmore, she noticed the way his eyes sharpened when he called Evelyn Eveline.

That was when she knew she had to act.

She made sure Henry Whitmore never spoke again.

For three years, she had basked in the life that should have been Evelyn’s.

And now, this damned pendant threatened to ruin everything.

She wouldn’t allow it.

Victoria rushed to Evelyn’s side, feigning concern. "Evelyn, are you okay?"

Her hands, however, were anything but gentle—clawing at the chain around Evelyn’s neck.

The clasp held firm.

"Victoria, stop!" Evelyn gasped, pain lacing her voice as she tried to push her away.

Margaret, catching Victoria’s frantic glance, spotted the pendant.

Understanding flashed in her eyes.

She swooped in, her voice dripping with false sympathy. "Oh, Victoria, you foolish girl! After everything she’s done to you—stealing Alexander, hurting Ethan—how can you still care?"

Evelyn didn’t understand why they were strangling her with the chain, only that it was cutting into her skin.

"Victoria, don’t waste another second on this wretch," Margaret sneered, glaring at Evelyn. "Come upstairs with me. Just looking at her makes my skin crawl."

"Of course, Mother," Victoria purred, a sinister smile twisting her lips.

With one final, brutal yank—

The chain snapped.

The pendant was hers.
###Chapter 115

The pendant slipped from Evelyn's grasp, tumbling down to land against Eleanor's wheelchair before bouncing onto the marble floor.

Evelyn gasped for air, her throat burning as crimson flushed across her cheeks. The medical gauze covering half her face did little to hide the panic in her wide, crystalline eyes.

"What in the world—" Eleanor's voice trembled as she struggled to rise from her chair. "William! William, come quickly!"

The elderly woman's shaking fingers closed around the golden locket, her breath coming in short bursts. When William rushed to her side, his face drained of color at the sight of the jewelry in his wife's palm.

"This...this is the custom piece we commissioned for our Lillian before she was born!" William's voice cracked. "Where did you find this?"

Evelyn's pulse hammered against her ribs. The world seemed to tilt as fragmented memories surfaced—her grandfather pressing the locket into her small hands, whispering words she couldn't quite recall.

Victoria's shrill accusation shattered the moment. "So you're the thief! I knew that pendant went missing under suspicious circumstances!"

Margaret advanced like a storm cloud, her designer heels clicking sharply against the floor. "After everything we've done for you—taking you in, giving you an education—this is how you repay us? By stealing Victoria's most precious heirloom?"

Tears welled in Victoria's expertly lined eyes. "First you try to take Alexander from me, now this? That pendant held my entire childhood, Evelyn!"

Evelyn opened her mouth to explain, but the words died in her throat as she watched the Montgomery's expressions shift from hopeful astonishment to disgusted contempt.

"You vile creature!" Eleanor spat, clutching the locket to her chest. "To think we almost—" She cut herself off with a shudder.

William's face darkened with fury. "Get out. If I ever see you near our family again, I'll have you arrested for theft and trespassing."

With trembling hands, he fastened the chain around Victoria's slender neck, his voice softening. "This belongs to you, my dear. Our real daughter."

The gold glinted cruelly against Victoria's flawless skin as she shot Evelyn a triumphant smirk. In that moment, the fragile hope that had flickered in Evelyn's chest extinguished completely.
###Chapter 116

Evelyn watched with trembling lips as William carefully fastened the heirloom necklace around Victoria's slender neck. Tears glistened in Victoria's eyes, her expression radiating pure joy.

"What a blessing - our family's treasure has finally returned to our beloved daughter," Eleanor murmured, her voice thick with emotion. Her gaze overflowed with maternal warmth as she admired Victoria.

The scene carved a fresh wound in Evelyn's chest. She stepped forward, her voice breaking. "I didn't steal that necklace. My grandfather Henry left it to—"

"Evelyn Sinclair!" Margaret cut her off sharply, gripping Evelyn's shoulder with bruising force. "Get out immediately! Don't you dare think you can manipulate our Victoria!"

Margaret dragged Evelyn away from the intimate family moment.

Evelyn wanted to resist, but her weakened body betrayed her. The world blurred as she watched William and Eleanor embrace Victoria with such tenderness.

She longed desperately for Eleanor to look at her just once. When Eleanor finally turned, her eyes held nothing but contempt.

Eleanor despised her.

The mere sight of Evelyn filled Eleanor with revulsion.

Evelyn's heart shattered like glass, the shards cutting deeper with every breath. The pain was unbearable - like rubbing salt into an open wound.

She'd never understood why Eleanor's opinion mattered so much, why she craved the woman's affection. Now the truth dawned on her, but she couldn't bear to acknowledge it.

Lost in thought, Evelyn didn't see Margaret's shove coming. She crashed onto the cold marble floor.

"Disappear!" Margaret spat, her face twisted with malice. "Mark my words - if you approach Victoria again, you'll regret it!"

With that final threat, Margaret stormed back inside.

Evelyn tried to stop her tears, but the tumor's relentless pain left her gasping on the floor. As she prayed for help, a wheelchair rolled into view.

Her heart leapt when she recognized Eleanor.

Hope flickered in Evelyn's chest - until Eleanor hurled the pink carnation Evelyn had given her directly at Evelyn's face.

"Stay away from my family, Evelyn. If you harass my precious daughter again, you'll face consequences you can't imagine!" Eleanor warned coldly before turning to Victoria. "Darling, take me inside now."

"Of course, Mother," Victoria replied sweetly, pushing the wheelchair toward the elevator.

Left alone on the freezing floor, Evelyn saw Victoria glance back, her lips curling into a triumphant smirk.

Gritting her teeth against the pain, Evelyn's eyes locked onto the necklace around Victoria's throat. Suddenly, her grandfather's mysterious death made terrible sense.

When the coast was clear, Evelyn slipped into Eleanor's room. She snatched the used toothbrush from the bathroom and fled.

At the DNA testing center, Evelyn's hands shook as she accepted the envelope two days later. The truth weighed heavily in her hands, yet she couldn't bring herself to open it.

She'd barely stepped outside when a rough hand clamped around her wrist like a vise.
###Chapter 117

Evelyn struggled against the brute's iron grip, but her efforts were futile. The towering man shoved her into the backseat of a black sedan before she could scream for help.

"Who are you working for? Where are you taking me?" Evelyn demanded, her voice raw with panic. No answer came. The goon beside her kept her wrists pinned against the leather seats throughout the entire ride.

Fifteen agonizing minutes later, the car screeched to a halt at an abandoned warehouse on Willowbrook's outskirts.

"Move!" The thug yanked her out by the arm, throwing her onto the gravel with enough force to scrape her knees bloody. Evelyn barely registered the sting as she lifted her chin defiantly.

Victoria emerged from the shadows like a venomous serpent, her designer coat fluttering in the winter wind. The smirk twisting her glossed lips made Evelyn's stomach churn.

"Victoria." Evelyn spat the name like a curse. "What's your game this time? Or should I guess—Alexander put you up to this?"

The moment Alexander's name left her lips, Victoria's perfectly manicured hand shot out in a vicious slap. Before Evelyn could react, a steel-toed boot connected with her ribs.

White-hot pain exploded through her body. Evelyn curled into herself on the frozen ground, her breath coming in ragged gasps. The December air cut through her thin sweater like shards of glass.

Victoria crouched down, tilting Evelyn's chin up with a gloved finger. "Poor little Evelyn. Still playing the victim after all these years?" Her saccharine tone dripped with malice. "Alexander wants you to understand your place once and for all."

Evelyn's blood ran colder than the snow beginning to dust her wounds.

"Teach her a lesson," Victoria commanded, stepping back to watch the show.

The blows came like hailstones—fists to her face, kicks to her stomach, until Evelyn could no longer tell where one bruise ended and another began. When the thugs finally left with their payment, Victoria remained, pristine as ever against the industrial wasteland.

Snowflakes settled on Evelyn's split lip, the icy burn nothing compared to the fire in her veins when Victoria waved a familiar document.

"Mother was so upset when her toothbrush went missing." Victoria's laugh tinkled like broken glass. "Imagine my surprise when I found this instead."

Evelyn's heart stopped. The DNA test—the one she'd risked everything to obtain—now dangled from Victoria's fingers like a trophy.

With a guttural cry, Evelyn launched herself forward. Victoria sidestepped effortlessly, driving her stiletto heel into Evelyn's abdomen. The pointed tip pierced through fabric and flesh alike.

"Pathetic." Victoria twisted the shoe deeper as Evelyn writhed. "You really thought a piece of jewelry could make you one of us?" She fisted Evelyn's hair, wrenching her head back. "The Montgomeries only have one daughter, and it will never be gutter trash like you."
###Chapter 118

Victoria's venomous threat still hung in the air as she viciously yanked Evelyn's hair, slamming her head repeatedly against the rough bark of an ancient oak. Each impact reopened the barely healed wound on Evelyn's forehead, fresh blood trickling down her temple.

Evelyn now understood why Victoria had hired those thugs earlier - to weaken her for this moment. Every muscle in her body screamed in protest, but she couldn't muster the strength to fight back.

Collapsed against the withered tree trunk, Evelyn resembled a broken doll. Her porcelain skin was smeared with dirt and crimson, the stark contrast making her appear almost ghostly.

Victoria loomed over her, gripping Evelyn's chin with manicured fingers. "Look at you," she sneered. "Pathetic. Did you really think you could steal Alexander from me? And Sebastian?" Her laugh turned shrill. "A high-society man like him would never glance twice at an ex-convict carrying another man's bastard!"

The words dripped with venom, but Evelyn remained silent, her defiant gaze never wavering. This only fueled Victoria's rage.

With sadistic satisfaction, Victoria watched blood trickle from the fresh wounds marring Evelyn's once flawless face. "I warned you what would happen if you crossed me," she hissed. "This is just the beginning of your living hell."

Victoria's confidence stemmed not just from Alexander's protection, but the entire Montgomery dynasty backing her. As she mentally catalogued her next torture methods, Evelyn suddenly sprang forward.

The DNA report vanished from Victoria's grasp before she could react. Realization dawned - Evelyn's silent endurance had been strategic, all for this moment.

"You bitch!" Victoria shrieked, lunging. But Evelyn had already torn open the envelope, her trembling fingers extracting the documents. Panic flashed across Victoria's face as she delivered a brutal kick to Evelyn's spine.

The impact sent Evelyn sprawling across the frozen ground. Metallic blood filled her mouth before she coughed up a crimson spray. Yet her grip on the papers never faltered.

Scarlet droplets stained the pristine snow as Evelyn's vision focused on the damning red stamp: 'CONFIRMATION OF RELATIONSHIP.'

Her heart shattered like glass beneath a hammer. The winter wind howled through the fractures, numbing the pain into something distant yet unbearable.

"Confirmation... of relationship," Evelyn whispered hoarsely.

A broken laugh escaped her lips, morphing into choking sobs. Tears blurred the damning words as they fell freely.

She had parents.

They'd been right beside her all along.

And they despised her very existence.
###Chapter 119

The mere memory of Eleanor and William's gazes made Evelyn's throat constrict with emotion.

Isabella sensed something amiss and swiftly snatched the document from Evelyn's trembling hands.

Her expression remained eerily calm as she scanned the results, then tore the paper violently into shreds.

With a contemptuous flick of her wrist, the fragments scattered like snowflakes in the wind.

"Evelyn, you wretched creature!"

Isabella's fingers dug into Evelyn's collar with bruising force, her eyes burning with murderous intent.

Yet Evelyn continued laughing, crimson staining her pearly teeth and painting her pale lips scarlet.

"Isabella, you'll always be nothing but a cheap imitation," Evelyn whispered, the words dripping with venom.

A sharp slap landed across Evelyn's injured face as Isabella's eyes flashed dangerously. "Watch your filthy mouth, Evelyn!"

Isabella tightened her grip, hissing her threat. "I will be the Montgomery heir! I am Sophia Montgomery! Do you understand?!"

Evelyn studied Isabella's twisted expression with grim amusement, spitting blood as she declared, "I won't let someone as vile as you deceive my parents!"

Isabella's gaze turned glacial, then suddenly released Evelyn with a sinister smile.

"Go ahead then. Tell them!" Isabella stood, arms crossed in challenge.

"Tell them you're dying in three months. Tell them you'll be dead before spring." The hesitation flashing across Evelyn's face brought Isabella visible satisfaction.

Her lips curled maliciously. "Let me share another secret, dear sister."

Isabella leaned closer, her voice dripping with poison. "Eleanor has a weak heart."

"What?" Evelyn's eyes widened in shock.

Raising an eyebrow, Isabella chuckled darkly. "If you want to give Eleanor a fatal heart attack, by all means reveal your true identity."

"Then tell them you're terminally ill. That you'll be gone in months. Do you think they'll celebrate or mourn? How do you think your precious parents will handle such wonderful news?"

Isabella's voice slithered through the air like a venomous serpent.

Evelyn collapsed weakly to the ground, her vision darkening as icy numbness spread through her limbs.

But Isabella wasn't finished. "Don't even consider telling Alexander. Whether he'd believe you is irrelevant - first think of Henry's ashes, then consider Olivia Bennett."

She knelt, gripping Evelyn's chin with cruel fingers. "There are no lines I won't cross!"

Straightening her dress, Isabella wiped Evelyn's blood from her hands with disgust before turning to leave.

She'd barely taken two steps when a tall figure blocked her path.

Isabella's face paled. "What are you doing here?"
###Chapter 120

Victoria Lancaster stared in shock at the sudden appearance before her. Her mind raced, realizing her earlier words to Evelyn might have been overheard.

"Victoria Lancaster, you were never Mom and Dad's real daughter! It was always Evelyn!" Sophia Montgomery shouted, her voice dripping with fury. "I treated you like a sister, but all you ever wanted was to steal my place!"

Victoria's stomach twisted. She was a master of deception, though, and quickly forced a wounded expression onto her face. "No, Sophia, you've got it all wrong. I am their daughter—"

"Stop lying!" Sophia snapped, waving her phone triumphantly. "I recorded everything you just said. I'm going straight back to show them the truth!" She cast a disdainful glance at Evelyn, still motionless on the ground.

"Even if I have to accept this pathetic excuse of a sister, it's better than letting a fraud like you keep pretending!" With that, Sophia turned on her heel.

Victoria lunged after her, feigning desperation. "Sophia, please—don't!"

"Ha! As if I'd let you take what even I couldn't have!" Sophia smirked, spinning back—only to freeze at the venomous glint in Victoria's eyes.

For the first time in her life, Sophia saw the true monster beneath Victoria's mask.

She barely had time to gasp before the knife plunged into her chest.

Sophia's breath hitched, her eyes widening in horror. "Victoria… you—"

"The Montgomery family's precious daughter? That title is mine now." Victoria's lips curled into a chilling smile as she yanked the blade free—only to drive it in again. And again.

Blood splattered across Victoria's face and clothes, but she didn’t flinch. She simply watched as Sophia's body crumpled, life fading from her eyes.

"Defy me?" Victoria whispered, wiping the blade clean. "I won’t even give you the chance to regret it."

Her gaze flicked to Evelyn’s unconscious form nearby.

Evelyn Sinclair stirred as icy air bit into her skin. Her eyelids fluttered open, pain exploding through her skull—but the agony in her heart was worse.

She was Eleanor and William Kingsley’s real daughter.

Victoria had stolen her life, her family, every scrap of love meant for her.

And the worst part? The hatred in Eleanor and William’s eyes whenever they looked at her.

Gritting her teeth, Evelyn pushed herself up—then froze.

A knife.

Clutched in her hand, its blade crusted with dried blood.

Her pulse spiked as she turned—and saw the body beside her.

Sophia.

The daughter Eleanor and William had cherished for over twenty years.

Pale. Lifeless.

Her pristine white coat now stained crimson.
###Chapter 121

Evelyn's eyes flew open wide. Her hands shook violently as she checked for Sophia's breath and pulse.

Nothing.

Sophia's body had turned cold, already stiffening with rigor mortis.

Evelyn's mind went blank. Panic clawed at her throat as she teetered on the edge of a breakdown. She had no memory of what happened after blacking out.

How did the knife end up in her hand?

As she struggled to stand, police sirens wailed in the distance. The sight of officers approaching sent ice through her veins.

Not again.

The detention center's familiar walls closed around her. The evidence was damning - her fingerprints coated the murder weapon, traces of Sophia's skin beneath her nails.

"I didn't do this!" Evelyn's voice cracked. "I'm being framed!"

The detectives exchanged skeptical glances. "Victoria Lancaster," one sighed, sliding confession papers across the table. "All evidence points to you. Just sign."

Evelyn's fists clenched. "I won't confess to a crime I didn't commit!"

When they returned her to the holding cell, despair threatened to consume her. Maybe she should have died in prison three years ago. At least then this nightmare would be over.

Just as she closed her eyes, footsteps approached. Someone demanded to see her.

Her stomach twisted with unease. This felt different from facing Alexander. More ominous.

The door creaked open to reveal Eleanor and William Kingsley. Understanding dawned - that foreboding had been premonition.

Eleanor's face contorted with rage when she saw Evelyn in handcuffs. "Murderer!" she shrieked, lunging forward.

Evelyn barely dodged the slap. The physical pain paled compared to the agony of seeing her birth parents' hatred.

She bit her lip until copper flooded her mouth, fighting back tears. If she cried now, she wouldn't be able to memorize their faces one last time.

"You monster!" Eleanor sobbed. "How could you kill my Sophia? Give me back my daughter!"

"Eleanor, please," William cautioned, gripping his wife's shoulders. "Your stitches-"

"How can I calm down?" Eleanor wailed. "That was our Sophia! Our daughter for twenty years! And this witch took her from us!"

Evelyn's heart shattered as Eleanor collapsed against William, her anguished cries echoing off the concrete walls. No words could bridge this chasm of grief and accusation. The daughter they'd chosen over her was gone - and they believed Evelyn had stolen her.
###Chapter 122

Her Sophia. Her precious daughter. Her heart's greatest treasure.

In Eleanor's eyes, Evelyn was nothing but a cold-blooded monster.

To Evelyn, those words cut deeper than any blade, carving fresh wounds into her already shattered heart.

No one could see the blood seeping through the cracks, but she felt it pooling inside her chest with every breath.

Her hands shook violently as she fought to keep her voice steady. "Mr. and Mrs. Kingsley, I swear I never harmed Sophia. I would never... Please, you must investigate properly. Don't let the real killer escape justice."

"Enough of your lies!" William slammed his fist against the table, making the china rattle. "The evidence speaks for itself! First you torment our Victoria, now you've taken our Sophia from us? Evelyn Sinclair, mark my words—you'll pay for this with your life!"

The venom in his voice sent Evelyn spiraling into darkness. Hot tears spilled down her cheeks unchecked. How ironic—he demanded to know why she hated them, when the truth was the exact opposite.

These were her parents. Her flesh and blood. The people she'd spent a lifetime yearning for.

Yet all she received was their contempt and condemnation.

The pain was unbearable. She'd known heartbreak from love, but this—this familial betrayal—cut deeper than anything before.

Her nails dug crescent moons into her palms as she struggled to breathe.

No.

She couldn't let Victoria continue deceiving them. Not when—

Eleanor suddenly gasped in pain.

William rushed to her side. "Your stitches! Eleanor, darling, we should listen to Victoria—no more visits. I promise you, this woman will rot in prison for what she's done to our Sophia!"

Evelyn opened her mouth, but the words turned to ash on her tongue. Seeing Eleanor's pained expression and William's protective fury, her courage failed.

She remembered Victoria's warning—Eleanor had a weak heart. Even if it was a lie, the shock of learning Evelyn was their true daughter might...

And with her own time running out...

Would it be kinder to let them believe the lie? To spare them the agony of losing another daughter?

The thought crushed what remained of her spirit.

Through blurred vision, Evelyn watched her parents walk away, their silhouettes growing smaller. Her fingers curled into fists so tight they trembled.

This might be the last time she ever saw them.

She'd never get to call them Mother and Father.

The longing burned like acid in her throat. She wanted so desperately to be their beloved daughter. To finally know what it felt like to have parents who cherished her.

Just as the door clicked shut, it swung open again.

Victoria swept in, her face the perfect mask of grief. "Mother! Father!" she cried, fresh tears glistening on her cheeks.
###Chapter 123

The sight of Eleanor and William Montgomery showering Victoria Lancaster with affection sent a sharp pang through Evelyn Sinclair's chest.

That love should have been hers. Every tender touch, every warm glance—all stolen by Victoria.

Evelyn bit down on her lip until she tasted copper, swallowing the words that threatened to spill out. She forced the longing back into the hollow space where her heart used to be.

A strange, suffocating pressure built in her chest, but before she could process it, the familiar metallic tang of blood flooded her throat.

"Evelyn, you've gone too far this time!" Victoria sobbed, storming toward her. "I warned you—if you have a problem, take it up with me. Don't drag innocent people into this! How could you be so heartless? You actually killed Sophia! Will you not stop until everyone around me is destroyed?"

Evelyn let out a cold laugh as Victoria's face hovered inches from hers. Fresh blood trickled from the corner of her lips, staining her teeth crimson.

"Victoria, you might fool everyone else, but not me. Stop playing the victim—it makes me sick."

The moment the words left her mouth, a sharp slap cracked across her face.

William Montgomery's hand struck with such force that Evelyn crumpled to the ground. Blood splattered against the floor—dark, almost black.

She coughed, relishing the searing pain in her chest. At least in death, she would receive one last "gift" from her so-called parents.

William didn’t spare her a glance. He turned to Victoria, his voice softening. "Vicky, your mother isn’t feeling well. Let’s go home."

"Dad, take Mom back first," Victoria said weakly, her eyes glistening with false tears. "I need to talk to Evelyn alone."

The sight tugged at William’s heart. He nodded, helping Eleanor away.

Before leaving, Eleanor shot Evelyn a venomous glare. "If this wretched creature dares lay a finger on you, scream for me. I’ll tear her apart myself!"

Victoria nodded sweetly.

Evelyn remained sprawled on the floor, her breath ragged. She was used to the sting of betrayal, but this—this cut deeper than ever.

Once they were gone, Victoria knelt beside her. A cruel smile curled her lips as she eyed the dark blood staining Evelyn’s lips.

"Look at you, coughing up blood again. At this rate, you won’t last three months." Her voice dripped with malice.

"So here’s some advice—keep your mouth shut. Or else, you won’t be the only one dying."

Rage ignited in Evelyn’s veins.

With a burst of strength, she lunged, her hands closing around Victoria’s throat.

"You’re right," Evelyn hissed. "I won’t be the only one dying—you’ll be joining me! Victoria, even in death, I won’t let you hurt my family again!"

Victoria’s face turned scarlet as she gasped for air. Guards rushed forward, trying to pry Evelyn’s fingers loose.

But Evelyn held on with inhuman strength. Even when a baton cracked against her ribs, she refused to let go.

The commotion drew Eleanor and William back.

William charged forward, kicking Evelyn away and pulling Victoria into a protective embrace.

"Mom! Dad! She tried to kill me!" Victoria wailed.

Evelyn lay on the ground, blood pooling beneath her. A chilling smile curved her lips.

"Yes. I want her dead. Victoria, I’ll drag you to hell with me."

Eleanor’s hand struck next, her eyes burning with hatred.

"Then let me make this clear," she snarled. "Even if you crawl back as a ghost, I’ll have your soul obliterated. You will never—ever—lay a hand on my daughter again."
###Chapter 124

Evelyn's tear-filled eyes locked onto Eleanor's as the words left the older woman's lips. In that instant, her heart fractured into countless shards, every last shred of hope dissolving into nothingness. The familial love she had yearned for all her life had twisted into a blade poised to ruin her.

If there was a next life, she wanted to be reborn as a goldfish—one with only seven seconds of memory. That way, she could forget every ounce of pain.

Not long after, Evelyn stood trial for murder. Most defendants pleaded for mercy, but her spirit was so shattered that she barely cared whether she lived or died.

In the courtroom, Evelyn wore a drab prison uniform, her face ghostly pale, her hair tangled like a wild creature's.

She spotted Victoria, radiant in an elegant dress, flanked by Eleanor and William. Even Alexander had come—likely to witness her sentencing. He probably wanted to see her locked away forever, stripped of any chance at redemption.

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. She was certain she'd be found guilty, condemned to life behind bars—or worse, the death penalty. But then, unexpectedly, a lawyer stepped forward to defend her.

This attorney was renowned in legal circles, his reputation impeccable. He presented a crucial piece of evidence.

At the crime scene, investigators had discovered a bloodstained napkin bearing Evelyn's DNA—but also the fingerprints of a third party. These prints didn't match any criminal database, and their owner remained unidentified.

Evelyn suddenly remembered—Victoria had struck her, drawing blood, then wiped her hands on a napkin before tossing it aside. That had to be the napkin left behind!

Victoria was involved in Sophia's death.

Evelyn stayed silent in court, but her mind raced with possibilities.

Thanks to this inconsistency, the court couldn't convict her. She walked free.

Yet Eleanor and William refused to let it go. Convinced Evelyn was the killer, they clung to Victoria's poisonous whispers.

Stepping out of the courthouse, Evelyn squinted against the blinding sunlight. The warmth did nothing to thaw the ice in her chest.

She shut her swollen eyes. Even if her time was running out, even if she couldn’t defeat Victoria and Alexander, she couldn’t let Victoria escape justice.

Evelyn submitted her resignation. After two days of restless recovery, she returned to the woods outside Willowbrook. She needed proof—something to expose Victoria as the real murderer.

Miraculously, she found it—a Chanel stud earring half-buried beneath dried grass, its surface flecked with blood.

Maybe the snow had hidden it before, or fate had intervened, but Evelyn finally smiled—a real, hopeful smile.

As she straightened, a shadow fell over her. Alexander stood there, his long strides closing the distance between them. His piercing gaze bore into hers as she held up the earring.

"Recognize these, Alexander? They're Victoria's."

His brow furrowed as he studied her expectant expression. "Do you know why you're standing here free right now?"

Evelyn blinked, confused.

"That lawyer was mine."

Her breath hitched. He had helped her?

"Why?" Her pulse thundered in her ears as she waited for his answer.

Alexander's lips curled into a smirk that sent a chill down her spine.

"You claimed you don’t love me anymore." His voice was low, mocking. "But your eyes tell a different story."
###Chapter 125

Evelyn froze, her breath catching in her throat as Alexander tilted her chin up. His warm breath brushed against her lips, sending her pulse into a frantic rhythm. A dark chuckle rumbled from his chest.

"I told you before—even if you die, it will be by my hand."

His voice, low and dangerous, coiled around her like a nightmare she couldn’t escape.

Evelyn’s heart hammered as she stared into his cold, mocking gaze. He wasn’t saving her. He just wanted to be the one to destroy her.

"Give me the earring," Alexander demanded.

Her fingers clenched tighter around the small piece of evidence. He had already destroyed proof of Victoria’s crimes once—she wouldn’t let him do it again.

She twisted away, but his grip was iron.

"Evelyn," his voice turned icy. "Don’t make me repeat myself."

She shook her head violently, her nails digging into her palm. "No! I’m taking this to the police. I won’t let Victoria get away with this!"

Alexander’s expression darkened. "You never learn, do you?"

With brutal efficiency, he yanked her against him, prying her fingers open one by one.

Panic surged through her, but the thought of Victoria’s smug face fueled her defiance. She fought harder, her voice trembling with fury.

"Alexander, how can you protect someone like her? I was a fool to ever love you!"

The words barely left her lips before his mouth crashed down on hers.

It wasn’t tender. It wasn’t loving.

It was possession.

Her mind blanked. The only thing she could feel was the heat of his lips, the sharp bite of his teeth, the way he stole her breath like he was stealing her will to fight.

For three years, he had never kissed her—not even in their most intimate moments.

Yet now, he did.

Evelyn shoved against his chest, but he only tightened his hold, his dominance overwhelming her resistance. Slowly, her struggles weakened, her body betraying her.

When he finally pulled away, she was breathless, her lips swollen.

Alexander smirked. "You say you don’t love me, but your body tells a different story."

Humiliation burned through her—until she saw the earring glinting in his hand.

Her stomach dropped.

He had tricked her.

Disgust twisted inside her. "You’d go this far for Victoria? Even selling yourself?"

Alexander barely glanced at her before turning toward the nearby lake.

Realization struck like lightning.

"Alexander, no!" She lunged after him, desperation clawing at her throat. "Don’t you dare!"
###Chapter 126

"Stop it, Alexander!" Evelyn screamed, but he didn't even glance her way.

Her breath hitched as he lifted his hand, flinging the crucial earring toward the lake. Her heart turned to ice—she had nothing left to bargain with.

Yet fate seemed to be on her side. A thin layer of frost coated the lake's surface, and instead of sinking, the earring landed right on top of it.

Alexander's expression darkened. His brows furrowed as he considered his next move—just as Evelyn bolted past him like a storm.

He froze, stunned, watching her sprint toward the lake's edge like a woman possessed.

The ice was too far from the shore for her to reach. She grabbed a fallen branch, desperate to hook the earring, but her hands trembled—one wrong move, and it would plunge into the depths.

Alexander strode forward, gripping her arm and yanking her back.

"Evelyn, what the hell are you doing?"

"Can't you see?" She wrenched free, her voice sharp. "I'm retrieving proof—proof that Victoria is the real murderer!"

His jaw tightened. "Don't be absurd. What does Sophia's death have to do with her?"

Same old protectiveness. Same blind loyalty. He reached for her again. "Come with me."

"No!" She shoved him with all her strength, her eyes burning with defiance. "Don't touch me, Alexander. You make me sick."

His face darkened. "What did you just say?"

"I said you disgust me!" Her voice cracked. "You kissed a woman you despise just to shield that vile, scheming Victoria. How pathetic!"

His knuckles whitened, veins standing out on his forehead. But Evelyn didn't flinch.

She met his glare with icy detachment. "I see you clearly now. And I swear—if you want this earring, you'll have to kill me first."

Then, without hesitation, she leaped into the freezing water.

Alexander's breath stopped.

The lake was glacial, the cold sharp enough to steal her breath—yet she'd jumped in without a second thought.

Evelyn grabbed the earring, but the cold seized her muscles. Her right leg cramped violently. She struggled, but her body grew heavy, dragging her under.

Alexander didn't hesitate. He tore off his coat and plunged in after her, hauling her back to the surface.

"Let go!" She fought him, gasping. "I won't let you take it from me again!"

But his grip was iron.

When they reached the shore, Evelyn's leg still wouldn't obey her. She braced for him to snatch the earring—but he didn't.

His face was unreadable as he shoved her into the car, driving straight to her apartment.

At the door, he moved to carry her upstairs, but she shoved him away.

Leaning against the wall, she forced her numb limbs forward, each step agony. She could feel his gaze burning into her back, relentless.

Just before she reached her door, she quickened her pace—then slammed it shut behind her, locking him out.
###Chapter 127

Alexander knocked impatiently at the door. "Evelyn, open up."

"Alexander, just go away. I don't want to see you." Evelyn's voice was ice as she turned from the entrance.

She'd hidden the earring before showering. Now dressed in warm, comfortable clothes, she turned up the heater, finally chasing away the chill.

Checking the clock, she noted over thirty minutes had passed. Surely he'd left by now.

Approaching the door cautiously, she pressed her ear against it. Silence. She turned the knob.

The door swung open to reveal Alexander's tall frame dripping on her doorstep. His hair plastered to his forehead, clothes soaked through. His expression darkened when their eyes met.

Her breath caught. He'd waited outside all this time in the freezing wind?

Instinct made her slam the door, but Alexander wedged his foot in the gap. With effortless strength, he pushed inside, tossing his car keys at her. "There's a change of clothes in my car. Fetch them."

He strode toward the bathroom as if he owned the place. Evelyn blocked his path. "Alexander, what do you think you're doing?"

Even drenched, his aristocratic bearing remained intact. His lips curved in amusement. "Evelyn, would you be breathing right now if I hadn't pulled you from that lake? Is this how you thank your rescuer?"

"Rescuer?" She laughed bitterly. "You only saved me to protect Victoria! So you could torture me yourself!"

Thunderclouds gathered in his gaze. "You truly don't recognize kindness when it's given."

"I learned that from you, Mr. Blackwood."

She spun toward the exit, but his quiet words stopped her. "Even so, you're still here."

Though reluctant, Evelyn retrieved his clothes, hoping he'd leave after changing.

Instead, Alexander made himself at home on her sofa, demanding food.

She knew he wanted the earring. That, she'd never surrender.

A simple meal prepared, she called for him - only to find him asleep on her couch.

In slumber, he looked younger. Vulnerable. The sight tugged at memories she'd tried to bury.

Her fingers brushed his forehead. Burning. His flushed cheeks confirmed it - fever.

From saving her? From waiting half-frozen at her door?

Guilt propelled her toward the pharmacy, but his hand shot out, capturing her wrist.

"Stay, Lillian."
###Chapter 128

Evelyn froze mid-step, her breath catching in her throat. She couldn't believe what she'd just heard, but the tightening grip of Alexander's fingers around hers confirmed it wasn't a dream.

"Lillian..."

That name - so achingly familiar yet painfully distant now.

Tears welled up in Evelyn's eyes as she stared at Alexander's sleeping face, her vision blurring with unshed emotions. Memories of their first encounter at Pinecrest Heights flooded back, making her heart ache with bittersweet longing.

"Victoria, don't worry," Alexander murmured in his feverish state. "I'll keep my promise to you..."

The fragile warmth in Evelyn's chest instantly turned to ice. Biting her lip hard enough to draw blood, she wrenched her hand free.

Of course. The Lillian Alexander called for wasn't her - it was Victoria Lancaster, who now went by Eveline Montgomery.

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips as she walked away. She deserved this pain. After everything, how could she still feel anything for this man?

Returning with fever medication, Evelyn hesitated when Alexander's phone buzzed. Victoria's name flashed on the screen. After a moment's deliberation, she answered.

"Alexander? Where are you?" Victoria's saccharine voice oozed through the receiver. "You promised to accompany me tonight."

"Victoria, you shameless witch," Evelyn spat, deliberately provoking. "If you're that desperate for male company, find someone who isn't my husband."

Silence. Then came the expected explosion.

"Evelyn! Why do you have that phone? Where's Alexander?"

"I'm his wife. Why shouldn't I answer his phone?"

"You—"

Evelyn could practically see Victoria's face contorting with rage through the phone.

"Don't call my husband again," Evelyn continued coldly. "If you've got free time, maybe explain to the police how your belongings ended up at Sophia's murder scene."

The sudden silence was deafening. Victoria's lack of response only confirmed Evelyn's suspicions about her involvement in Sophia's death.

Thinking of how her own parents doted on that monster, Evelyn quickly texted Eleanor Kingsley, hoping to warn her and William to be cautious. No reply came before Alexander stirred awake.

Evelyn wordlessly offered the medication and water. Alexander studied her with suspicious eyes.

"Worried I'm poisoning you?" Evelyn set the pills and glass down with a sharp clink. "Suit yourself."

She turned on her heel without waiting for a response.

Alexander watched Evelyn's retreating figure with unreadable eyes before swallowing the pills and closing his eyes again.

By evening, Evelyn had prepared dinner. Alexander joined her at the table, his fever seemingly better as he ate with surprising appetite. His gaze lingered on Evelyn sitting far from him.

"Aren't you going to eat with me?" Alexander's deep voice held a challenging note, those mesmerizing eyes locking onto hers.
###Chapter 129

Evelyn's expression remained composed. "Mr. Blackwood, please leave after your meal. It would be best if you stopped coming back from now on."

Alexander's lips curved into a smirk. "Evelyn, why pretend you want me gone? You were quite responsive when I kissed you earlier today!"

"Don't mention that again!" Evelyn snapped, her composure cracking for a brief moment. "Alexander Blackwood, you've disappointed me beyond measure."

"What does that matter? It doesn't change the fact that you're still in love with me."

Evelyn's anger burned like wildfire in her chest. Her heart ached, and so did the pit of her stomach.

"I loved you once. But now, even your touch repulses me!"

Alexander's fork clattered against his plate. The food suddenly tasted like ash in his mouth. He rose abruptly, stalking toward Evelyn with dangerous intent.

Sensing the shift in atmosphere, Evelyn turned to flee. But Alexander moved faster, pinning her against the wall with both hands.

Evelyn refused to meet his gaze, but he dipped his head deliberately, forcing his handsome yet menacing face into her line of sight.

As his breath ghosted over her skin, Evelyn's throat constricted with fear. She ducked suddenly, attempting to slip beneath his arms, but Alexander anticipated the move, gripping her chin with bruising force.

"Let me go!"

Evelyn trembled like a cornered animal, ready to bolt at the first opportunity.

Alexander's brows furrowed. "Now you don't want my touch? Has someone else captured your heart? Don't forget, Evelyn, I'm still your husband!"

"When have you ever treated me as your wife? Never!" Evelyn spat, her eyes blazing with unshed tears. She clenched her jaw, determined not to let them fall.

"Alexander, I don't love you anymore. Truly. So stop touching me. Go to Victoria. You love her so much—save yourself for her. Don't soil yourself with someone as vile and despicable as me. You said it yourself—I'm not worthy!"

Evelyn had nothing left to say. The strange, complicated expression on Alexander's face was one she couldn't decipher.

"Evelyn." His voice softened unexpectedly as he reached for her hand.

She jerked away, refusing to meet his gaze.

His eyes lingered on her bandaged face, and his expression gentled further. He bit his lip, about to speak when his phone rang.

Releasing her, he answered the call.

Evelyn pressed herself against the wall, the silence between them deafening. It was so quiet she could hear the panicked voice on the other end: "Alexander, come to the hospital immediately! It's Victoria—she's dying!"

Victoria was dying?

Evelyn refused to believe it. This had to be another one of Victoria's schemes. Yet Alexander's face transformed instantly with concern.

He hung up and turned to leave.

At the doorway, he seemed to remember something and abruptly dragged Evelyn with him.

"Alexander! What are you doing? Let go!" Evelyn struggled against his iron grip.

"From now on, you don't leave my sight." His tone brooked no argument as he shoved her into the car.

Understanding dawned on Evelyn. "Afraid I'll take the evidence to the police? Afraid I'll expose Victoria for the murderer she is? Alexander Blackwood, you're despicable! You'd abandon all principles for that woman—protecting a killer!"

Alexander listened to her tirade before suddenly roaring with rage. His cold hands closed around her throat. "Victoria is innocent and kind—she'd never do something so vile! I won't let you slander her!"
###Chapter 130

Evelyn gasped for air, her face flushed crimson as she forced a bitter smile. "Alexander, do you even understand what true remorse feels like?"

Her voice trembled. "When you were dreaming earlier, did you see our child? Has your conscience ever ached for what you did?" She stared into his conflicted eyes, searching for any trace of regret.

"That child was never mine." His jaw clenched, his icy gaze burning into her, yet a flicker of uncertainty lingered beneath.

Evelyn laughed, tears spilling onto Alexander’s hands.

The heat of her tears seared his skin, forcing him to release her throat abruptly. He turned away, discomfort twisting his features as he started the car.

"If you value your life, stop provoking me."

Evelyn inhaled sharply, swallowing her words.

For now, she needed to stay alive. She had to witness Victoria’s downfall with her own eyes.

Alexander dragged Evelyn to the hospital against her will. Victoria was in the VIP ward, her muffled sobs echoing through the door. The moment Evelyn arrived, Margaret blocked her path.

"You vile creature!" Margaret hissed, jabbing a finger at her. "Why are you here? To finish what you started? Do you think Victoria hasn’t suffered enough?"

Evelyn’s gaze flickered to Alexander. "I didn’t ask to come. My husband insisted."

Alexander’s jaw tightened at her subtle smirk, but he didn’t deny it.

Just then, Eleanor stormed out of the ward. The moment she saw Evelyn, pure hatred flashed in her eyes.

"What are you doing here?" Eleanor spat. "First, you murdered Sophia, and now you’re trying to kill my only remaining daughter? Evelyn, you’re despicable! I can only imagine what kind of monsters raised someone like you!"

Evelyn’s heart twisted. What kind of parents…

She didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. "Mrs. Kingsley, I didn’t kill Sophia. The real murderer is—"

"Are you seriously blaming Victoria now?" Eleanor roared. "She tried to take her own life because of you!"

"Mom, don’t blame Evelyn…" Victoria’s frail voice drifted from inside. "It’s my fault… Just let me die. I’m so tired…"

Alexander shot Evelyn one last unreadable glance before rushing into the ward. Eleanor followed, casting Evelyn a final glare of loathing.

Evelyn moved to enter, but Margaret shoved her back. "You think you have the right to step foot in there? You’re nothing!"

Evelyn met her gaze steadily. "You know exactly who I am."

Margaret faltered, momentarily speechless.

Satisfied, Evelyn turned to leave—until Eleanor’s gentle voice stopped her cold.

"Victoria, my darling, don’t say such things. To me, you’re the purest soul in this world. That shameless, wicked woman stole the man you loved, destroyed your child, and now she’s destroying you. I will make her pay."

Evelyn’s legs locked in place, weighed down by the words.

She stood there, frozen, as Eleanor’s verdict echoed in her ears.

A shameless, wicked woman.
###Chapter 131

Her heart had been shattered beyond repair, yet these people still insisted on twisting the knife deeper.

Evelyn turned sharply, her eyes blazing with fury as they locked onto Victoria. "Victoria Lancaster! Look what you've done to yourself! Alexander was supposed to be your fiancé, but you stole him using the most despicable tricks. And now? You used his phone to call Evelyn and spew those vile words just to wound her! Have you no shame left?"

The realization struck Evelyn like lightning. This entire suicide act had been orchestrated during that phone call when Alexander was burning with fever.

A bitter smile curled Evelyn's lips as she met Victoria's tear-filled gaze. "Keep spinning your lies, Victoria. Isn't this exactly what you want? For Alexander and me to divorce so you can finally take my place as Mrs. Blackwood? Well listen carefully - even if I breathe my last, I'll die as Alexander's lawful wife!"

The words barely left her mouth when Eleanor's palm connected with Evelyn's cheek.

"You heartless wretch!" Eleanor screamed, her voice trembling with rage. "A girl like you deserved to be abandoned by your parents! They probably died from the shame of having you as their daughter!"

Evelyn's vision blurred with unshed tears. Every fiber of her being wanted to scream out the years of pain and betrayal. Instead, she swallowed the bitterness. "You're right. I grew up without parents. Only my mentally ill grandfather raised me."

"He told me I wasn't abandoned. That they just... forgot about me in a moment of carelessness." Evelyn's voice cracked. "But now I know the truth. They didn't forget. They simply never loved me. How could they, when they can't even recognize their own daughter standing right before them—"

"Alexander, just forget about me! Stop caring about me forever!" Victoria's perfectly timed interruption sliced through Evelyn's words.

Evelyn looked up to see Victoria suddenly leap from the hospital bed, a gleaming fruit knife clutched in her hand, the picture of a desperate woman ready to end it all.

"Victoria!" Alexander's voice rang out, thick with concern, his eyes reflecting nothing but worry for the woman holding the blade.

Ice spread through Evelyn's veins. In all their years together, had the man she loved ever looked at her with such devotion? Never. Not once.

Yet here he was, utterly consumed by fear for this scheming woman. What spell had Victoria cast to make him so blind?

"Victoria, don't do this! I couldn't bear to lose you!" Eleanor sobbed, making a show of trying to restrain her daughter.

"Mom, I'm sorry!" Victoria wailed dramatically, her sorrowful gaze fixed on Alexander. "Alexander, remember your promises? You swore to protect me, cherish me, to make me your wife. But that day will never—"

Victoria's words triggered something primal in Evelyn. Those same sweet promises Alexander had whispered to her years ago now echoed hollowly in her memory. What she'd believed were sacred vows between them had been nothing but recycled lines he doled out to any woman who caught his fancy.

She'd been a fool to think herself special. Just another fish in Alexander Blackwood's well-stocked pond.

What a pathetic joke.

Through the haze of her anguish, Evelyn heard Victoria's final performance: "Mom, forgive me. Alexander, I love you. We'll marry in our next life! Evelyn, I surrender Alexander to you. No more fighting. From now on, you won't need to harass me, provoke me, or make those cruel calls. Take him! He's yours!"

"Victoria, no!" Eleanor lunged theatrically for the knife. "Alexander! Will you really let Victoria die before your eyes? Even now, will you still cling to your grandfather's wishes and refuse to divorce this witch?"

Each word was a dagger to Evelyn's heart. She'd truly believed Alexander would keep his promises, but his hesitation as he stared at Victoria told another story.

After an agonizing silence, Victoria shrieked, "Let me go, Mother!" and with a dramatic flourish, slashed her wrist. Blood sprayed across the hospital sheets.

The sight shattered Alexander's resolve. He rushed forward, capturing Victoria's bleeding wrist. "Stop this madness, Victoria! I promise you—I'll divorce Evelyn immediately. I'll make you my wife. Today."
###Chapter 132

Evelyn watched as Alexander made his solemn vow to Victoria. The words were simple, yet they pierced her heart like shards of glass.

It seemed fate had destined them to walk separate paths.

Tears welled in Evelyn's eyes as she saw Victoria gazing at Alexander, her face streaked with tears. "Alexander, are you serious? You'll really marry me?"

Alexander's expression softened. "Of course. I always keep my promises."

"Alexander, we won't have to hide anymore—" Victoria threw herself into his arms, sobbing dramatically against his chest.

Then, she turned her head just enough to flash Evelyn a triumphant, venomous smirk.

Beside them, Eleanor Kingsley smirked in satisfaction before shooting Evelyn a look of pure loathing.

Evelyn's fists clenched, her nails digging into her palms as she fought back the suffocating pain. She turned on her heel and strode away.

Alexander noticed her retreating figure. Gently disentangling himself from Victoria, he moved as if to follow.

Victoria clutched his sleeve. "Alexander, are you hesitating because of her?"

"Don't be ridiculous," he murmured, his voice cool. "I just need to finalize the divorce. You should get your wound treated."

Without another glance, he walked away.

Despite his words, doubt flickered in Victoria's eyes. But with Eleanor watching, she had no choice but to maintain her fragile, innocent act.

Evelyn stormed out of the hospital, her steps unsteady. A metallic taste filled her mouth—she was choking back blood.

Fumbling for a tissue, she pressed it to her lips. The crimson stain glowed ominously under the streetlights. These episodes were becoming more frequent. Time was running out.

Her vision blurred as she stared at the endless row of lights, each one a cruel reminder of the love she'd once believed in.

She had clung to the memories—their reunion, the stolen moments, the whispered promises. She had thought, at least, those had been real.

But now she knew the truth.

He had played the same game with someone else.

Evelyn tilted her head back, blinking rapidly. What had she been holding onto? A dream? A fantasy of a perfect future?

Pathetic.

She wiped her eyes roughly, steeling herself to leave—when his voice stopped her cold.

"Evelyn."

She froze, crumpling the bloodied tissue in her fist before quickening her pace.

Alexander caught her wrist. "What are you hiding?"

She yanked her hand free. "None of your business."

"None?" His voice was dangerously soft. "So the divorce is exactly what you wanted? You've been waiting for this, haven't you?"

Evelyn laughed bitterly. "Mr. Blackwood, isn't this what you and your beloved have been dreaming of?"

A strange shadow crossed his face. "Then you don't want this? You still love me?"

His gaze burned into her, demanding an answer.

Evelyn met his eyes, her voice steady. "Alexander, I don't love you anymore. But I won't sign those papers."
###Chapter 133

Alexander's sculpted features froze. His crimson eyes burned into her with terrifying intensity.

"Evelyn, what did you just say? Explain yourself."

She knew death was near. The foolish dream she had clung to for over a decade resurfaced. Tears welled in her eyes as she smiled bitterly at him.

"What I mean is, I won't let that fraud Victoria win. Even in death, I'll take the title of Mrs. Blackwood with me!" Evelyn's voice cracked, tears spilling despite her efforts to hold them back.

"Alexander, no matter how much you despise me, it won't change the fact that I am your wife!"

The words tore through her like a blade.

A lifetime of love, poured into this man. It began with passion—now it would end in ruin.

Yet why did her heart still ache so violently?

Was death truly her only escape?

Alexander's fury erupted. His hand shot out, gripping her throat. "Evelyn, you dare play games with me?"

She choked out a laugh, tears streaming. "Haven't you been toying with me for years, Mr. Blackwood?"

"Evelyn Sinclair!" His grip tightened.

Even in his rage, he was devastatingly beautiful.

She didn't fight. Didn't beg. Just stared into the eyes of the man who wanted her dead.

Hadn't he vowed to kill her himself?

Today was that day.

Darkness crept at the edges of her vision—then suddenly, he released her.

"Get out!" he snarled, shoving her away.

Evelyn collapsed onto a flowerbed, pain lancing through her abdomen. Gritting her teeth, she forced herself upright, meeting his stormy gaze.

"Alexander, don't regret sparing me today."

A cold smirk twisted his lips. "You think I'm trapped in this marriage because of my grandfather's promise? How naïve."

Her breath hitched.

What?

If not for his grandfather—then why?

Alexander reveled in her shock. He seized her chin, voice a venomous whisper. "From the beginning, this marriage was always mine to control. Did you really believe one night in my bed made you worthy of being my wife?"

He released her with a scoff, turning away.

Evelyn stood frozen, trembling in the cold night. A thousand questions screamed in her mind.

When she returned home, Sebastian was waiting at her door.

"I couldn't reach you. I was worried," he said gently, his handsome face softening with concern.

She hesitated, fingers hovering over the doorknob.

Sebastian sighed. "If I'd known Jeremy would destroy you like this, I would have stopped this marriage three years ago."
###Chapter 134

Evelyn's eyes widened in shock. "What makes you say that?"

Sebastian regarded her with a somber expression. His lips parted slightly before he caught himself, swallowing whatever words had been on the tip of his tongue.

"Nothing. I simply find it... regrettable."

Regrettable?

Something in his tone made Evelyn uneasy, but she resisted pressing further.

Some truths revealed themselves in due time. Pushing now might only drive him away.

She opened the door wider, inviting him inside.

"I heard about Sophia. I know you had nothing to do with it. You're not capable of such cruelty."

His unwavering trust warmed Evelyn's heart. Sebastian sipped his tea, his gaze lingering on her pale complexion.

"I'm keeping your resignation on file. The door remains open whenever you wish to return."

"Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Whitman." Evelyn's smile held quiet sorrow. "But I don't think that opportunity will come."

"My offer stands indefinitely." His voice carried the same gentle warmth as his smile - a striking contrast to his usual elegant reserve.

Evelyn recognized his sincerity. Yet Sebastian would never know her refusal stemmed not from unwillingness, but from the merciless clock ticking within her.

Her dreams of jewelry design, her cherished relationships - all slipping through her fingers like sand.

Sebastian didn't stay long. The visit ended as quietly as it began.

That night, sleep eluded Evelyn. She reached for a fresh journal, pen hovering over blank pages.

Days later, Evelyn finally removed her facial bandages. The mirror reflected a stranger - gaunt features, hollow cheeks, the angry scars now more pronounced against her deteriorating complexion.

The disease was claiming her, piece by piece.

Mask secured, she prepared to deliver the bloodstained earring to authorities. But fate intervened the moment she stepped outside.

Nathaniel.

Having lost contact, he'd tracked her down through Olivia. The sight of Evelyn's ravaged face shattered him.

Without a word, he whisked her to Benjamin's clinic.

Evelyn knew the futility of examinations but couldn't refuse Nathaniel's desperate concern.

Benjamin's expression darkened as he reviewed the results. "Evelyn, have you experienced hematemesis recently?"

"Vomiting blood?" Nathaniel paled. Evelyn's silence confirmed his worst fears. "Eve—"

She offered a weak smile. "It's just another symptom, Nate. Don't worry - I still owe you too much to check out early."

Her casual bravery masked the truth. A meaningful glance sent Benjamin ushering Nathaniel out under pretext of additional tests.

Alone with her doctor, Evelyn faced the question she'd been dreading. "How long, Benjamin?"

His regret was palpable. "With luck? Two months."

"And without?"

"If complications arise or the tumor progresses... no more than thirty days."

Silence settled between them.

Evelyn absorbed this with unsettling calm. The numbers held no surprise - only confirmation of what her body had been screaming all along.
###Chapter 135

Evelyn remained silent, her fingers twisting nervously in her lap as conflicting thoughts swirled in her mind.

She still had time—at least thirty days.

Thirty days to gather the final pieces of evidence and expose Victoria's murder to the authorities.

After leaving the hospital, Nathaniel drove her aimlessly through downtown Willowbrook. As evening fell, he pulled up beside a brightly lit food truck.

Nathaniel turned to her with that familiar gentle smile that always made her chest tighten. "Evie, will you share some spicy tacos with me again tonight?"

Her breath caught. Then she noticed the unshed tears glistening in his hazel eyes.

Did he know? Had he discovered her limited time?

Evelyn pushed the thought away, forcing a bright smile. "Of course. And not just tonight—we'll have plenty more chances."

"Promise?" His voice held desperate hope.

"Cross my heart," she whispered.

They stood by the food truck's warm glow, eating tacos that burned her tongue just like their university days. Nathaniel confessed how he'd fallen for her during freshman orientation, only to learn she'd already given her heart to Alexander.

But Evelyn knew the truth—she hadn't loved Alexander at first sight. That dangerous attraction had reignited later, like a spark finding dry tinder.

When they finished, Nathaniel drove her home. He hesitated at her doorstep, clearly wanting to stay, until a family call forced him to leave.

She'd barely taken three steps when suddenly he was there—his hands framing her face, his lips pressing a featherlight kiss to her forehead.

"Evie Sinclair, I've loved you for years."

Then he was gone, leaving her standing frozen as the evening breeze carried away his words.

"Evelyn Sinclair!"

The icy voice shattered the moment.

She whirled to find Alexander descending the apartment stairs like a storm made flesh. His measured steps belied the fury rolling off him in waves.

Every instinct screamed danger as he closed the distance. His obsidian eyes burned with quiet rage, the air around him turning arctic.

Her pulse hammered against her ribs.

The winter wind was nothing compared to the glacial hatred radiating from him.

"First Sebastian, now Nathaniel Sterling. How many men do you need to validate yourself?" His voice could have frosted glass.

He seized her wrist with bruising force.

"Do I mean nothing to you? Flirting with another man right outside our home?"

Evelyn's nails bit into her palms. "Hypocrite. You parade Victoria Lancaster around without a thought for your wife."

Alexander's expression turned glacial.

"You've grown bold," he hissed. "Too bold."

Before she could react, he dragged her toward the building.

"Alexander! Let me go!"

Her struggles meant nothing. Inside their apartment, he threw her onto the bed, his body pinning hers before she could escape.
###Chapter 136

Evelyn's entire body trembled with terror, her complexion turning ghostly pale. She desperately wanted to flee, but Alexander's iron grip trapped her against the wall.

His fingers dug into her chin, forcing her to meet his stormy gaze. "Look at me," he commanded.

"No! Alexander, stop this!" She thrashed violently, her voice breaking. "Don't touch me! Let me go!"

His lips curled into a cruel smirk. "You melted in Nathaniel's arms, yet you recoil from my touch?" The contrast between her reactions fueled his rage.

Evelyn's panicked eyes darted around the room, searching for escape. Alexander's expression darkened, his icy stare piercing through her.

"Remember who owns you, Evelyn," he growled against her ear before sinking his teeth into her shoulder.

Her protests turned to whimpers. "Please... I can't..."

But Alexander was beyond reason. Fabric tore as he stripped away her defenses, claiming her with brutal possession.

Exhaustion finally claimed her. In her dreams, she relived happier days - before the betrayal, before the pain.

Dawn brought no relief. The cold reality pressed down on her as she found herself still imprisoned, Alexander's sleeping form beside her. Moonlight painted silver streaks across her hollow expression.

'How did loving you become my greatest sin?' The unspoken question hung heavy in the air.

'Why must you destroy what little remains of me?'

'Alexander... what more do you want from my broken soul?'

When she woke again, the bed stood empty. Not even his warmth lingered on the sheets.

Every movement sent fresh aches through her battered body. The shower scalded her skin, yet couldn't wash away his scent, his touch, his violation.

Dressing mechanically, she stumbled into the streets like a ghost. The city's noise faded beneath the screaming memories of last night.

Her feet carried her home on autopilot. The splintered door frame stopped her cold.

Inside, Victoria lounged on the sofa like a queen holding court, flanked by two hulking guards. Evelyn's orderly apartment lay ransacked.

"What are you doing here?" Evelyn's voice cracked.

Victoria's smile turned predatory. "You know why I came." She snapped her fingers. "Hand it over."

The missing earring. Of course. 'Alexander protected his precious Victoria well.'

Evelyn laughed bitterly. "Too late. The police have it now."

Victoria's mask slipped. "You lying bitch!" She backhanded Evelyn hard enough to make her ears ring.

The guards seized Evelyn's arms as Victoria hissed, "You've signed your death warrant. Take her!"

Struggling proved useless. A sharp pain exploded at the base of Evelyn's skull, plunging her into darkness.

Icy water shocked her back to consciousness, dripping from her hair as she gasped for air. The real nightmare was just beginning.
###Chapter 137

Darkness surrounded her.

When Evelyn's eyelids fluttered open, Victoria's silhouette loomed above her, casting a long shadow across the cold concrete floor.

"Awake already? I was hoping you'd stay unconscious longer. It's more fun when you can feel everything."

Victoria's mocking voice dripped with venom as she crouched down, her manicured fingers digging into Evelyn's chin.

Those emerald eyes - still breathtaking despite the scars - made Victoria's blood boil with envy.

"Evelyn Sinclair," she spat the name like poison. "Even half-dead, you still manage to ensnare men." Her nails pressed into Evelyn's barely healed wounds. "How did you do it this time? Those pathetic puppy eyes of yours?"

The pieces clicked together in Evelyn's throbbing head.

Victoria knew. About Alexander spending the night. About everything.

A hoarse laugh tore from Evelyn's raw throat - equal parts bitter and triumphant. "Jealous much? If Alexander truly loved you, why would he crawl into another woman's bed?"

"You little—"

Victoria's grip turned vicious, reopening wounds until fresh blood trickled down Evelyn's neck. The crimson flow seemed to delight Victoria, her laughter echoing off the warehouse walls.

White-hot pain seared through Evelyn's body, yet she refused to scream. She wouldn't give Victoria that satisfaction.

Frustration twisted Victoria's features. A brutal kick to Evelyn's ribs finally elicited a choked gasp.

That was all the encouragement Victoria needed.

The blows came relentlessly - kicks, slaps, punches - each more vicious than the last. "Scream, damn you! You think you can steal Alexander from me? Refuse to sign those divorce papers?"

Through split lips, Evelyn managed a bloody smile. "I'll never... set him free. You'll always be... his dirty little secret."

Victoria's face darkened like a thundercloud. Those mesmerizing eyes - she couldn't stand them another second.

Grabbing fistfuls of Evelyn's hair, she yanked her head back. "Let's see how smug you are without these." A switchblade flashed in the dim light. "Alexander's taking me to Venice next month. Going to propose at sunset. Pity you won't see it."

Evelyn's fingers curled into fists. "Karma... will destroy you."

"My karma is Alexander's ring on my finger. Yours?" Victoria's smile turned feral as she produced a photograph. "Since you're dying anyway... meet the bastard Alexander drowned right after birth."

What?

Evelyn's heart stuttered. The photo fluttered downward, but before her trembling fingers could reach it, rough hands pinned her arms.

A needle pierced her skin.

The world blurred at the edges as Victoria's voice slithered into her fading consciousness: "Look closely, Evelyn. Your daughter's first and last photo."

Darkness swallowed her whole, Victoria's laughter the last thing she heard.
###Chapter 138

The tranquilizer's effects left Evelyn Sinclair unconscious for an unknown length of time.

When awareness finally returned, her arm felt numb. Then came the sharp, stinging pain behind her eyelids.

She blinked slowly, her vision swimming in darkness.

Was it night already?

Memory crashed back—Victoria Lancaster’s cruel words before the world had gone black. Evelyn bolted upright, ignoring the ache in her limbs. Her hands scrambled across the cold floor in desperation.

The photograph.

Her child’s photograph!

Blindly, she searched, fingers brushing nothing but empty space.

Her phone. She fumbled for it, jamming her thumb against the unresponsive screen. Dead battery.

Then—her fingertips grazed something smooth. A card. The photo Victoria had thrown at her before everything faded.

Evelyn clutched it to her chest, relief flooding through her. But when she held it up, she saw nothing.

She forced herself to stand, swaying. Light. She needed light. But the world remained a blur of shadows, her eyes burning like fire.

Using the wall as a guide, she stumbled toward what she thought was the exit. A faint glow teased the edges of her vision.

She tried to open her eyes wider, to see the photo in her hands. Agony lanced through her skull.

Victoria’s mocking voice echoed in her mind. A cold dread settled in Evelyn’s bones. Trembling, she raised a hand to her face—and touched her eyes.

Her fingers hovered before her face. Only a hazy outline remained. The clarity she once had was gone.

She was blind.

Disbelief turned to horror. She staggered forward, colliding with strangers.

They took one look at the dried blood on her face, her dazed expression, and rushed her to the hospital.

The doctor studied her chart with a frown. "Miss Sinclair, you’ve lost your left cornea. The right is severely damaged. Without a full transplant, you’ll be completely blind."

The words struck like lightning. Evelyn stood frozen, her heart stuttering before it remembered to beat again.

"Thank you, Doctor," she whispered.

Alone in her room, she turned on the bedside lamp with shaking hands.

She traced the edges of the photograph with trembling fingers. Then, clutching it to her chest, she curled into herself, shattered.

Tears burned as they fell.

She lifted her head toward the ceiling. Only blurred light remained. Soon, even that would be gone.

To protect Victoria, Alexander Blackwood had allowed this. He wouldn’t even let her die whole.

Rain tapped against the window. After a day of numbness, Evelyn took the bloodied earring to the police station.

She had lied to Victoria. She hadn’t reported her before. But now, she would.

Sophia Montgomery’s murder would not go unpunished.

The officers took her statement, their voices hushed. Evelyn picked up the pen, her remaining vision straining as she signed her name.
###Chapter 139

A satisfied smile curved Evelyn's lips as she stepped out of the police station.

Finally, Victoria would face justice for her crimes.

If Sophia's blood was found on that earring, Victoria would have no defense left.

Evelyn waited anxiously for updates, but two days passed with no news.

Unable to wait any longer, she returned to the station—only to collide with Victoria and Alexander at the entrance.

Standing beneath her umbrella in the pouring rain, Evelyn couldn't make out their faces clearly. But Victoria's voice carried sharply through the downpour.

"Alexander, why won't Evelyn stop tormenting me? Does she want me dead?" Victoria gasped dramatically when she noticed Evelyn. "Eve?"

Blinking against the rain, Evelyn barely discerned Victoria's approaching figure.

"Eve, what will it take for you to leave me alone? How could you accuse me of killing Sophia? She was my best friend! The blood on those earrings means nothing—I gave them to her!" Victoria's voice trembled with theatrical sobs.

Evelyn's smile remained icy. "You murdered Sophia. Do you think these pathetic lies will save you? Victoria, the law always catches up. The truth will come out."

"Eve, you—"

"Save your tears and acting. They don't work on me. Even blind, I can see the ugliness in your heart."

"Enough!"

Alexander's furious roar cut through the rain.

Evelyn's grip tightened on her umbrella as her heart stuttered.

She lifted her chin, her clouded eyes staring blankly ahead.

Through the rain's haze, her remaining vision caught glimpses of Alexander's handsome face twisted in anger.

He stepped between them, shielding Victoria.

"Evelyn, how many warnings must I give you? Must I teach you another lesson?" His voice dripped with barely contained rage.

Though her vision blurred, Evelyn could perfectly imagine Victoria's smug smirk and Alexander's cold glare.

She laughed bitterly. "Mr. Blackwood, we both know who's tormenting whom here."

Victoria's voice turned saccharine. "Eve, I finally understand. You only pretended to be my sister to get close to Alexander. How foolish I was. But please, don't hurt those I love because of your jealousy."

Alexander immediately softened, pulling Victoria close. "Don't worry, darling. As my future wife, I'll always protect you. That's a promise I'll never break."

"Oh, Alexander..."

Evelyn scoffed, bitterness rising like bile in her throat.

Alexander's icy gaze burned into her. When he realized she wasn't looking at him, his jaw clenched. "Evelyn, the divorce papers are ready. You have twenty-four hours to sign them."

Raindrops pelted her umbrella like shards of glass piercing her heart. "I told you, Alexander. I'll never agree to divorce you. That two-faced witch will never take my place while I live!"

"That's not your decision!" he snapped. Something twisted in his chest when her vacant stare missed his glare. Taking Victoria's hand, he deliberately shouldered past Evelyn.

The impact sent Evelyn sprawling onto the wet pavement. Her umbrella skittered away as rain soaked through her clothes.

Pale and shaking, she groped blindly for her umbrella.

As Alexander started the car, an inexplicable urge made him glance at the rearview mirror.
###Chapter 140

The downpour intensified as Evelyn remained kneeling on the slick pavement. Her trembling fingers searched desperately through the puddles.

Vehicle after vehicle sped past, drenching her repeatedly with icy spray. Still, her umbrella remained lost to the storm.

Alexander's hand hovered over the ignition when his gaze kept drifting to the rearview mirror.

Victoria noticed immediately. "Alexander, we should go. Ethan needs medical attention for his face," she urged gently.

He turned toward her. "The cut's superficial. It won't leave a mark."

"I never imagined Evelyn could hate me this much. And Father..." Victoria's voice quivered. "I didn't know he'd order someone to disfigure her face to avenge Ethan and me."

"You're not angry with him, are you?"

Alexander chuckled darkly. "Why would I be?"

His eyes flicked back to the mirror just as Evelyn finally located her umbrella and stood. He watched her retreating figure through the rain-streaked glass, an inexplicable fury tightening his jaw.

"She deserved worse for what she's done."

Victoria hid her satisfaction behind a mask of compassion. "Alexander, I've dreamed of being your bride every day since we parted at the cove. After all this waiting, our wedding day is finally here."

Several heartbeats passed before Alexander responded.

"I always keep my promises."

"I know." Victoria's smile didn't reach her eyes. Beneath her serene expression, jealousy festered.

Only Evelyn's death would bring her true peace.

Evelyn swallowed painkillers with shaking hands upon returning home.

The accumulated trauma of recent weeks made her doubt she'd survive another month.

Alexander's promise to marry Victoria played on loop in her mind. Each recollection sent fresh agony through her battered body like a swarm of stinging insects.

The medication brought no relief.

With trembling fingers, she retrieved the photograph Victoria had thrown at her earlier. Tracing the infant's blurred features, she imagined soft cheeks beneath her fingertips.

'My darling.'

'Mommy's coming home to you soon. Very soon...'

She surrendered to the darkness behind her eyelids.

The divorce papers arrived at dawn.

Alexander's assistant waited impatiently for Evelyn's signature. When she refused, the young man made a terse phone call.

Alexander appeared within the hour, bringing the storm's chill with him.

Evelyn sat motionless on the sofa, her failing vision barely registering his approach.

The documents struck her cheek before fluttering to the floor. "Sign them."

Two icy words. No more discussion needed.

Evelyn remained statue-still, her silence louder than any protest.
###Chapter 141

Alexander's expression turned glacial. "Evelyn, I'm telling you to sign the papers."

"I refuse," Evelyn finally responded, her voice eerily calm.

Alexander watched as she sat motionless before him, her gaze distant, refusing to meet his eyes. The deliberate avoidance stoked the fire of his anger. "Evelyn, don't test my patience. You know what happens when you do."

When faced with his threats, Evelyn didn't flinch. Instead, a faint smile curved her lips.

"Alexander, I'll say this one last time—I won't sign your divorce papers. If you're so desperate to marry Victoria, go ahead. Just know I'll sue you for bigamy the moment you do."

"Evelyn Sinclair!" Alexander's fury erupted. "I'll ask you one final time—are you signing or not?"

"No." Her voice was steel.

His face darkened. Seeing her defiance, her refusal to even look at him, he strode forward, seized her wrist, and forced the pen into her hand. His grip was unrelenting.

"Alexander, let me go!" She struggled against him.

"You refused to sign? Then I'll do it for you." His icy whisper beside her ear felt like a death sentence.

Evelyn fought with all her strength, but every movement sent waves of agony through her—her worsening tumor, her heart, everything screamed in protest.

"Alexander, you monster! I swear, even if I die, I won't let you and Victoria have your happy ending!" With a desperate shove, she broke free and turned to flee.

Blindness made every step treacherous.

She hadn't gone far before she tripped, crashing hard onto the floor. Pain radiated through her body.

Before she could rise, Alexander's imposing figure loomed over her, casting a suffocating shadow.

Evelyn couldn't see him, but she felt his presence—cold, merciless.

Unaware of her blindness, he pressed a knee into her back and thrust the divorce papers before her, tossing the pen down.

"Evelyn, don't make this harder than it needs to be. Sign like a good girl, and I'll make sure you're compensated."

"I don't want your money!"

"Then what do you want?" His voice dripped with scorn. "Do you still foolishly believe I have feelings for you?"

His words froze her.

"Evelyn, listen carefully. I never liked you. Never loved you. Not even a little."

Each syllable was a blade, carving into her heart.

A dull ache spread through her chest, the metallic tang of blood rising in her throat.

"Stop wasting my time. Sign, and I'll leave to prepare for my engagement with Victoria. If you refuse, think about your grandfather's ashes."

A bitter laugh escaped her. Her sightless eyes, already red and wet, burned with unshed tears.

"Fine. I'll sign."

At last, she relented. Blindly, she groped for the pen, swallowing the blood in her mouth.

"Alexander, you'll finally get what you want. From now on, we're nothing to each other."

Her words sent an inexplicable chill through him. His pulse stuttered, an unfamiliar sensation twisting in his chest.

He watched as she struggled, her left hand fumbling over the papers. Minutes passed, yet she still hadn't signed.

"Evelyn, are you playing games again?"

Her lips curled into a broken smile. "Mr. Blackwood, I'm blind. I can't see."

"Blind?" He scoffed, convinced it was another lie. "Fine. If you're blind, I'll guide you."
###Chapter 142

A sudden warmth spread across the back of Evelyn's hand.

Alexander's grip tightened around her fingers, forcing her to sign the name Evelyn Sinclair on the last page.

It was her name, but written in his handwriting.

When he finished, he released her hand abruptly, pulling the papers away. His gaze lingered on the signature, an unexpected heaviness settling in his chest. Instead of relief, an oppressive weight pressed down on him.

He glanced down at Evelyn, still kneeling on the floor. Her face was ghostly pale, tears shimmering in her sightless eyes. A thin trail of blood stained her lips—she must have bitten down too hard. She looked broken.

Alexander frowned. "Evelyn, do you have any last requests?"

"Five hundred thousand dollars," she answered without hesitation.

A derisive scoff escaped him. "You came prepared, I see. I'll have the money transferred immediately."

His phone buzzed before he could say more.

When he answered, Victoria's honeyed voice drifted through the speaker. Evelyn heard his response, soft and indulgent. "I'll be there soon."

Then, he turned away.

The dim remnants of her vision darkened with each step he took, until finally, there was nothing. Just endless black.

Something inside her shattered.

The shards stabbed into her heart like jagged thorns.

Blind eyes lifted toward where he had disappeared. In that moment, she understood—her love for him had always been a solitary performance.

Alexander, thank you for stopping by.

I hope I never see you again—not in this life, or the next.

Evelyn braced herself for the end. Though she couldn’t see her own reflection, she could feel her body failing.

Yet, she had one final wish.

She wanted to see her parents one last time—even if they despised her.

Stumbling to the roadside, she waved for a cab. One finally stopped, but the driver took one look at her scarred, pallid face and sped off.

Again and again, cars halted, then left her behind.

Gritting her teeth, she trudged forward, following the textured pavement beneath her feet.

Then, snow began to fall.

The cold seeped into her skin, burrowing deep into her heart.

Evelyn pulled a photograph from her pocket, pressing a tender kiss to its surface.

My baby.

My precious little one.

Mommy won’t be cold with you here.

"Look, a celebrity!" An excited voice rang out behind her.

A celebrity?

How lively it must be. A shame she couldn’t see it.

A bitter smile touched her lips—just as someone barreled into her shoulder.

She staggered, barely catching herself, but the photo slipped from her grasp.

Panic seized her. Dropping to her knees, she frantically swept her hands across the icy ground, dirt caking beneath her nails.

It was gone.

Tears spilled down her cheeks.

At that moment, Alexander drove past.

From the corner of his eye, he noticed the crowd gathered nearby. He barely spared them a glance—until he saw her.

Evelyn, on her hands and knees, searching desperately for something.

Her face was deathly pale, her expression raw with despair. The vibrant woman he once knew was gone, replaced by this hollow shell.

And when her tears fell, something inside him burned.
###Chapter 143

Alexander's grip on the steering wheel tightened. He blinked hard, wondering if his vision was failing him. But no—it was Evelyn whose eyes had failed.

She was blind.

Truly blind.

Her earlier struggle with signing the divorce papers hadn't been an act. It was real.

Yet, she had been fine before. What had happened?

Alexander watched as Evelyn crawled on the ground, her fingers desperately searching for something while tears streamed down her face. His chest tightened, the air suddenly too thick to breathe.

Snowflakes swirled around them, mixing with a light drizzle. The street emptied as people hurried away, leaving Evelyn alone, still groping through the dirt.

She wept like a child who had lost something irreplaceable.

Alexander stepped out of the car, his legs heavy as lead. He moved toward her, but she didn’t notice him. Her frail body trembled as she kept searching, her hands now smeared with grime.

Dazed, Alexander bent down and picked up a stray photograph near his feet. He placed it in front of her.

The moment her fingers brushed the image, her despair melted into relief.

She clutched it to her chest, blowing away dust before pressing it to her lips. Only then did she rise, her expression easing as she followed the textured path beneath her feet.

Alexander stood frozen, the wind biting at his skin. Evelyn’s figure grew smaller in the distance. His eyes stung, and his breath came in ragged gasps.

News of Alexander and Victoria’s engagement spread like wildfire. It was Victoria who called Evelyn to gloat.

On the other end of the line, Victoria’s voice dripped with smug satisfaction. After flaunting her victory, she extended a mocking invitation.

"You should come to the party."

Evelyn’s grip on the phone tightened. "I’ll be there."

Victoria scoffed. What could a blind woman possibly do?

The engagement was set at Willowbrook’s most lavish hotel, the air crisp with the lingering chill of early spring.

Victoria stood radiant in an elegant gown, her arm looped through Alexander’s as cameras flashed. She glanced at him, her smile faltering when she saw his blank expression.

"Alexander, aren’t you happy?"

He forced a smile. "Of course. I promised to marry you, didn’t I?"

Her lips curved, but bitterness coiled in her chest.

He never said I love you. Only I promised.

And that promise hadn’t been meant for her.

Alexander moved like a puppet as they took the stage. The exchange of rings was a blur.

His mind wandered back to his wedding day—Evelyn in white, her eyes alight with love, her gaze shy yet full of longing.

Now, those same eyes were empty.

"Please exchange the rings."

The emcee’s voice snapped him back. Victoria beamed as she slid the ring onto his finger.

Alexander’s hand twitched, resisting.

Then, a voice cut through the murmurs of the crowd.

"Wait."

Evelyn stood at the edge of the room, her presence sharp as a blade.
###Chapter 144

The moment her voice echoed through the hall, Alexander's hand froze mid-air.

Evelyn's fingers closed around emptiness as her joyful expression shattered like glass.

All eyes turned toward the fragile figure standing at the entrance.

Vivian Prescott.

She wore a simple ivory dress that draped over her slender frame. Light makeup accentuated her delicate features, though it couldn't completely conceal the scars. Yet she carried herself with an ethereal grace that made her seem like a vision from a forgotten painting.

The guests recognized her immediately - Alexander's former wife.

None could tell she was blind. She moved forward with careful steps, each one a battle against her failing body and the darkness surrounding her.

Alexander watched Vivian's unsteady approach. His gaze searched her eyes desperately, but found only emptiness where warmth once lived.

She stumbled slightly, her body betraying her lack of sight.

Victoria's lips curled in disgust as she observed Vivian's approach. Then she noticed Alexander's unwavering stare, and ice flooded her veins.

"Alexander..." She clutched his arm with feigned weakness.

He shook her off without hesitation, descending the platform toward Vivian.

"Vivian, what are you doing here?" Eleanor Kingsley blocked Vivian's path, her voice dripping with contempt.

Vivian stopped. Though blind, she felt Eleanor's hatred like physical blows. The pain cut deeper than any knife.

"Security! Remove this woman immediately!" William Montgomery's booming voice cut through the murmurs.

Vivian smiled through the agony twisting her insides. She lifted her sightless eyes toward the crowd.

Only Alexander and Victoria knew the truth about her blindness.

As security moved in, Alexander raised his hand. "Wait."

Victoria's face darkened. After years of waiting to claim her place beside Alexander, this ruined moment burned like acid.

That worthless blind creature should have died already!

She'd make sure Vivian didn't see another sunrise.

Alexander approached Vivian with an unfamiliar softness in his eyes. "Did you come to say something?"

His voice held a tenderness Vivian had never heard before. It meant nothing now.

She smiled weakly, wincing as pain wracked her body. "I couldn't miss my dear sister's engagement. I brought a gift."
###Chapter 145

Victoria tossed her bouquet aside and rushed forward, blocking Evelyn's path. Tears streamed down her cheeks, her expression the perfect picture of wounded innocence.

"Evelyn, today is Alexander's and my engagement party." Her voice trembled. "I know you despise me, but please—don't take your anger out on the man I love."

William Montgomery stepped forward, his voice sharp with warning. "Evelyn, this is my daughter's special day. If you know what's good for you, leave now."

Eleanor Kingsley sneered, her eyes burning with contempt. "The fact that a heartless snake like you is still breathing is mercy enough. Get out before I make you regret ever showing your face here!"

Evelyn's heart ached, but her expression remained serene. A faint, knowing smile curved her lips. "Tell me, Mrs. Kingsley, have you ever had your fortune read? I suppose surviving this long is a miracle."

Alexander's chest tightened at the sight of her smile—so bright, so devastating, it cut through him like a blade.

Eleanor and William's faces darkened. "You shameless wretch!" Eleanor spat. "Still trying to worm your way between Alexander and Victoria?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Alexander and I were married for three years. We divorced recently, yet the child Victoria bore him is already two. So tell me—who really stole whose husband? Who's the true mistress here?"

Eleanor and William fell silent. Victoria's face twisted with fury.

The guests murmured among themselves, the scandalous truth now laid bare.

Evelyn didn't need to see to imagine Victoria's expression. She turned toward the sound of Alexander's voice, her sightless eyes fixed in his direction.

"My dear ex-husband," she called softly. "I know none of you want me here—least of all you. I'll leave after I give you my gift."

Alexander's pulse pounded in his temples. His dark gaze never left her. "What gift?"

Evelyn exhaled, her voice steady. "My ashes."

A stunned silence fell over the room.

Alexander's breath hitched.

Evelyn was here to make a scene—but not the kind anyone expected.

"Evelyn," Alexander said, his voice strained. "What are you saying?"

She smiled. "I'm speaking clearly. I want to give you my ashes."

"Evelyn—"

"I know you hate me. All of you do." Her voice was eerily calm. "But I don't have much time left. Once I'm gone, you can take my ashes. Crush them. Scatter them. Do whatever you want—just one request." She paused. "When the time comes, take them to Pinecrest Heights. Let them drift into the sea."

Alexander's expression darkened. He stared at her unfocused eyes, words failing him.

Evelyn's smile was bittersweet, fading as the pain in her chest grew unbearable. She couldn't hold on much longer.

"Alexander," she whispered, "thank you for the memories. But I'm giving them all back to you now—everything, even my ashes. After this, we're even. And if there's a next life... I hope I never meet you again."

A single tear slipped down her cheek. Without another word, she turned away.

Then the heat rose—a searing rush from her stomach, clawing up her throat. Blood spilled past her lips, staining her fingers as she tried in vain to stop it.

Crimson droplets splattered against her white dress, blooming like grotesque flowers. The sight burned into Alexander's vision, relentless and horrifying.
###Chapter 146

"Evelyn!"

Alexander sprinted toward her, his heart pounding with a terror he'd never known. The raw panic in his voice echoed through the empty corridor as he called her name.

Her trembling body collapsed against the wall, her legs giving out beneath her. No matter how hard she fought, her strength was gone. Even her vision blurred, her consciousness slipping away like sand through her fingers.

The sight of blood staining Evelyn's lips sent a jolt of pure dread through Alexander. His throat tightened, his pulse roaring in his ears.

"Alexander!" Victoria rushed over, her gaze flickering between him and Evelyn with thinly veiled irritation. She didn't care about Evelyn's condition—only that Alexander was wasting his attention on her.

"Alexander, the guests are waiting!" Eleanor snapped, stepping forward with a sneer. "That blood is obviously fake. Can't you see she's just trying to ruin your engagement with Victoria?"

A weak, bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips.

Her mind was fading, but she still heard every cruel word.

Doesn’t matter.

She was dying anyway. Soon, none of this would hurt her anymore.

"Alexander, step away from her! She's covered in filth!" Eleanor hissed.

"Shut your mouth!" Alexander roared, his sculpted features twisting with fury. The sheer intensity of his rage froze both women in place.

"Evelyn, what's happening to you?"

"I'm dying, Mr. Blackwood. Just like you wanted..."

Her whisper was barely audible, but it struck him like a blade.

Alexander's breath hitched. His chest burned as if a thousand needles were piercing his heart.

Dying? No. Impossible.

His hands shook as he stared at her, her shallow breaths the only sign she was still clinging to life.

Then, with the last of her strength, she reached for his coat. Her unfocused eyes locked onto his, her lips moving weakly.

"The baby... is yours. When I'm gone... give her a name. Let her rest in the Blackwood mausoleum. That's... my last wish."

Her hand fell limply from his coat.

Alexander barely registered the scream tearing from his own throat as he caught her before she hit the ground.

Darkness swallowed him whole.

"Evie! Evie!"

Olivia's anguished cry shattered the silence.

"Alexander, you monster! Give her back to me!" She lunged forward, desperate to wrench Evelyn from his arms.

"If you won't take her to the hospital, I will!"
###Chapter 147

"Get away from her!"

Alexander's roar cut through the air like a blade. He surged forward, scooping Evelyn into his arms before she could collapse further. Blood stained his pristine white shirt, the metallic scent thick in the air as he flagged down a cab.

Olivia stood frozen for a heartbeat before snapping into motion, chasing after them.

Victoria and Eleanor rushed out as well, but they were too late—Alexander had already vanished into the cab with Evelyn.

Olivia clenched her fists, nails biting into her palms. Without hesitation, she hailed another cab and followed.

The emergency room's harsh fluorescent lights cast long shadows over the waiting area. Alexander sat motionless, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn's warmth still lingered against his skin, her scent clinging to him. But the blood—so much of it—had seeped into his clothes, a grotesque reminder of what had just happened.

He closed his eyes, her last words echoing in his mind.

"Alexander Blackwood, you heartless monster!"

Olivia's furious scream shattered the silence. Alexander lifted his gaze slowly, his eyes dark and dangerous, like a predator sizing up its prey.

But Olivia didn’t flinch. Tears streamed down her face as she glared at him.

"Alexander, if you don’t love Evelyn, fine. But why torture her like this?"

Her voice cracked. "Three years ago wasn’t her fault! She was framed! Why punish her for something she didn’t do?"

Olivia stepped closer, her chest heaving. "She gave you everything—her love, her loyalty—and you accused her of being unfaithful. You denied your own child!"

Her next words struck like a knife. "If she didn’t love you, why would she risk her life to protect that baby? But you—you destroyed everything!"

Alexander’s jaw tightened, but he remained silent.

Victoria stormed forward, her face twisted in outrage. "How dare you speak to my fiancé like that? Evelyn got what she deserved!"

Olivia scoffed. "The only one who deserves anything is you, Victoria. You scheming, two-faced witch!"

Victoria’s hand flew up, but Alexander caught her wrist before the slap could land.

"Alexander—" she whined, eyes brimming with crocodile tears. "I won’t let anyone disrespect you like this."

He ignored her, his focus locked on Olivia. "Go on," he said, voice low.

Olivia met his gaze, unflinching. "You’ll regret this, Alexander. Mark my words."

The weight of her words pressed against his chest, making it hard to breathe.

Then—the emergency room doors swung open.

A nurse stepped out, her expression grim. "Family of the patient?"

Alexander was on his feet instantly. "I’m her husband. How is she?"

The nurse hesitated, then sighed. "The tumor has progressed rapidly. She’s unconscious, and the doctors are doing everything they can, but..." She trailed off, handing him a clipboard. "You should prepare yourself. The chances are slim. Sign here, please."

Alexander’s fingers trembled as he took the pen.
###Chapter 148

The nurse handed over the critical condition form with trembling fingers.

The paper felt weightless in Alexander's grasp, yet it carried the crushing burden of a thousand stones.

An invisible pressure settled over him, making his skin crawl with discomfort.

Critical condition.

Was Evelyn really about to slip away from him forever?

He refused to accept it.

"Alexander, you need to sign it. Let her go peacefully," Victoria urged, stepping forward to grasp his arm.

He shoved her away violently, crumpling the form in his fist. His eyes burned with fury. "What critical condition? She was fine! Fix her! If anything happens to her, I'll make sure this hospital shuts down!"

The nurse flinched at his outburst, scrambling back into the operating room in fear.

Moments later, a team of specialists rushed past him, disappearing behind the swinging doors.

Alexander slumped into a chair, dragging his hands through his hair. His jaw clenched so tight it ached.

How could this be happening?

Why did the thought of losing Evelyn terrify him so much?

The suffocating dread was unbearable.

He needed to see her.

After relentless demands, the doctors finally relented, allowing him inside under strict conditions.

He scrubbed in, donned sterile gear, and stepped into the operating theater, half-expecting to find Evelyn awake, smirking at him—proving this was all some twisted joke.

Instead, he froze.

Her face was ghostly pale, devoid of any warmth.

For the first time, he truly looked at her. Even with the scars marring her skin, she was breathtaking.

If only she would open those mesmerizing eyes—the ones that had once sparkled like stars.

But she didn’t move.

Machines beeped erratically, tubes snaked across her fragile body, keeping her tethered to life by a thread.

Alexander stood paralyzed, drowning in helplessness.

Memories flooded him—Evelyn on her first day at university, vibrant and full of life, colliding into him with an embarrassed laugh. "I'm so sorry!" Her voice had been like honey, sweet and warm.

Then their wedding day—her radiant smile, those dimples that made his chest tighten.

Now...

The relentless mechanical whirring became too much.

Fear clawed at his throat.

He couldn’t stay.

He fled the operating room, heart pounding, because for the first time in his life, Alexander Blackwood was terrified—terrified of losing her.
###Chapter 149

How could this be happening?

He didn't care about her. Not at all. Never had.

Alexander kept repeating these words like a mantra, desperately trying to suppress the storm of emotions raging inside him. Yet the sharp, unrelenting pain in his chest forced him to face a truth he could no longer deny.

He had fallen for Evelyn Sinclair.

He didn't know when it started, but Evelyn had somehow carved a permanent place in his heart.

Memories flooded back - he was supposed to love Victoria. Victoria Lancaster, the woman he'd made childhood promises to. So why was Evelyn the one occupying his thoughts now?

Alexander rubbed his temples, frustration evident in every tense muscle. His bloodshot eyes remained fixed on the glowing "SURGERY IN PROGRESS" sign. It felt like something precious had slipped through his fingers in the quicksand of his memories, lost forever.

Twenty-four hours passed. The operating room lights still burned bright.

Victoria was growing restless, but the dark aura surrounding Alexander kept her from acting rashly. She could only wait, praying the doctors would emerge with news of Evelyn's demise.

Eleanor Kingsley arrived, her heels clicking sharply against the hospital floor. Spotting Alexander still stationed outside the OR, she immediately went to defend her daughter's honor.

"Alexander Blackwood! How dare you make Victoria wait here all this time? That scheming woman is obviously faking it! This is just another one of her pathetic attempts to steal your attention and ruin your engagement!"

"Come, Victoria. Let's take Alexander back to the hotel," Eleanor commanded, reaching for Alexander's arm. When Victoria moved to assist, Alexander violently shook off Eleanor's grasp. His crimson eyes burned with dangerous intensity.

"Even if she is acting, she's doing it for me. What concern is that of yours? Get out of my sight!"

Eleanor recoiled, shocked by his venomous response. Recovering quickly, she tried again. "Alexander, you're confused. You divorced Evelyn. Victoria is your fiancée now—"

"So what? That doesn't change the fact she was once mine! That her name remains in the Blackwood family registry! One more word and I'll hold you personally responsible if anything happens to Evelyn!"

Both women fell silent under his threat. Neither dared speak another word.

His expression was terrifying - those piercing eyes seemed capable of flaying anyone who met his gaze.

Victoria clenched her fists behind her back, nails digging into her palms. She couldn't accept Alexander's reaction to Evelyn's condition.

The signs had been there all along.

The most damning evidence? He'd allowed Evelyn to carry his child.

While no matter how many times she'd tried seducing him - slipping drugs into his drinks, wearing the most revealing lingerie - he'd always fallen asleep before anything could happen.

The surgical team rotated shifts multiple times throughout the night.

Alexander had even summoned his personal physician from Geneva to assist.

With each passing hour, time stretched agonizingly slow. Alexander had never experienced such torment, never found a single night so impossible to endure.

As dawn's first light crept through the windows, the operating room lights finally dimmed.

Alexander sprang to his feet, nerves taut with anticipation. Hope flickered in his exhausted eyes - hope that Evelyn had been saved.

Overnight, dark stubble shadowed his jaw. His complexion had turned ashen, eyes sunken from lack of sleep.

The surgical team emerged, their grim expressions speaking volumes before they even opened their mouths. Seeing Alexander, they shook their heads in unison. "Mr. Blackwood... we did everything we could."
###Chapter 150

Alexander's heart constricted with unbearable pain. His eyes widened so dramatically they threatened to pop from their sockets. "What do you mean you did everything you could?" His voice cracked. Those were the most terrifying words any family member could hear.

The attending physician sighed heavily. "Frankly, it's miraculous the patient survived this long. My deepest sympathies."

Alexander refused to accept this outcome.

He needed Evelyn to be breathing.

He needed her alive so he could finally reveal the truth.

"I treated this patient three years ago," a female doctor interjected. "She was pregnant then. I advised terminating the pregnancy for her health, but she refused. That child clearly meant more to her than her own life. Now that she's gone, perhaps the child's survival is some small consolation."

Alexander felt the air leave his lungs.

That child.

He'd personally crushed that innocent life to dust.

Their own flesh and blood, destroyed by its father's hands.

The pain in his chest became unbearable, threatening to drive him mad.

He sprinted to the operating theater where Evelyn still lay on the table.

Each step toward her felt heavier than the last.

When he finally reached her, she might as well have been on another continent.

Her porcelain skin had lost all color. No breath stirred her lips. No heartbeat animated her chest. She resembled a broken doll, forever asleep.

"Evelyn..."

His whisper trembled through the sterile air. No response would ever come.

Those hopeful eyes would never gaze at him again.

Something inside him shattered beyond repair.

Victoria entered with barely concealed triumph. Spotting Evelyn's lifeless form, her lips twitched upward before schooling into perfect grief.

"Alexander," she sniffled, "Evelyn must have been ill for years. She probably didn't want you to see her like this. Let her rest in peace. We should go home."

She reached for his arm, but an arctic chill stopped her.

"Alexander?" she ventured.

His gaze turned murderous.

"Did you arrange for her blindness?"

Victoria's eyelashes fluttered innocently. "Alexander, how could you think that? I'd never be so cruel! Was Evelyn blind? How—"

His pupils contracted as he studied her face for tells.

"You'd better be completely ignorant about this."

Victoria's blood ran cold at his tone.

"Alexander, you know I could never—"

"Get out."

"But—"

"Everyone out! NOW!"
###Chapter 151

Alexander's furious roar sent Victoria scrambling backward in terror before she turned and fled.

No one dared enter the room now. The entire situation baffled everyone in Willowbrook.

The whole city knew Alexander adored Victoria, yet here he was, refusing to release his deceased ex-wife's body. What madness was this?

Nathaniel had learned of Evelyn's death from Benjamin. He'd rushed over immediately, only to be barred from the operating room by security.

After a brief scuffle with Alexander's guards, the door swung open. Nathaniel broke free just as Alexander emerged.

"Alexander, you murderer!" Nathaniel lunged, fist raised. "You killed Evelyn!"

Alexander caught Nathaniel's wrist effortlessly, his bloodshot eyes burning with intensity. "I said no one disturbs my wife. Get out."

"Your wife?" Nathaniel laughed bitterly. "Tell me, Alexander, when did you ever treat Evelyn as your wife? After tormenting her to death, now you play the grieving widower? How pathetic can you be?"

Nathaniel's words struck a nerve. A storm gathered in Alexander's darkening expression.

Shoving Nathaniel away violently, Alexander barely restrained himself. "Leave!" he ground out before slamming the operating room door shut again.

This wasn't real.

Evelyn had to be faking.

He'd play along until she broke character. No one could maintain such an act forever.

Yet his own resolve was crumbling. No human could endure this agony indefinitely.

Trembling fingers brushed Evelyn's cheek. The icy touch traveled straight to his heart.

Alexander's vision blurred. Before he knew it, he'd gathered Evelyn's limp form against his chest. His first tear fell onto her cold skin, the heat of his grief powerless against death's chill.

'Evelyn, you said I'd regret this. You were right. I'm drowning in regret now. Won't you open your eyes and see?'

He prayed this was all an elaborate ruse. But the relentless march of time confirmed the truth - the woman in his arms was gone.

Alexander never imagined he cared for Evelyn. Certainly not this deeply. For years, he'd considered her nothing but a nuisance.

Yet this excruciating pain kept reminding him - he loved her. Desperately.

News of Evelyn's death spread rapidly. Old Master Blackwood collapsed from shock and was hospitalized.

While Willowbrook mourned, Victoria secretly rejoiced. Though her engagement party had been ruined, everyone now recognized her as Alexander's fiancée.

Finally, Evelyn - that persistent obstacle - was gone forever. No one could threaten her position now.

At Alexander's request, Evelyn's body was placed in cryogenic preservation.

When Alexander returned after a brief absence, he found the preservation chamber empty.

He searched frantically, clinging to the hope Evelyn had simply grown tired of her charade and escaped. But security footage revealed the truth - Olivia had arranged for Evelyn's remains to be removed.

Following the trail, Alexander arrived at the funeral home just as Olivia exited, clutching an urn.

Snowflakes settled on Alexander's motionless frame. Each breath suddenly felt like a sin.

Olivia's tear-streaked face twisted in hatred when she spotted him. She tried to walk past.

Alexander's crimson eyes tracked her movement. "Give her to me," he rasped, blocking Olivia's path.
###Chapter 152

The four words slipped from his lips, weightless yet draining every ounce of strength from his body.

"Alexander, I won't let you have Evelyn anymore! Meeting you was the worst thing that ever happened to her. Will you only be satisfied when you've ground her bones to dust?"

Olivia's accusations sent a violent throb through Alexander's temples. His hand shot out, voice steel. "Give her to me!"

"Never! I'd rather die than hand Evelyn over to you!"

When Olivia refused to surrender the urn, something inside Alexander shattered.

He lunged, wresting it from her grasp.

Clutching Evelyn's ashes to his chest, he fled to his car like a thief, Olivia's furious curses chasing after him. The engine roared to life, tires screeching as he sped away.

Alexander Blackwood had always taken what he wanted—no one dared defy him. Yet here he was, dignity in ruins, all for the remains of a woman he'd destroyed.

He drove straight to her old apartment, the one she'd lived in before the end.

The bed still smelled faintly of her perfume. He buried his face in the pillow, chasing ghosts of her warmth.

Her diary lay on the nightstand. He flipped it open, each entry a knife twisting deeper.

'November 6th. Sunny.

Why can't I forget him? What's the point of protecting a man who never loved me? He shattered me. He killed our daughter. And yet, here I am, still aching for him. Evelyn Sinclair, you deserve this torment.

November 11th. Rain.

If there's a next life, I pray I never meet him again. No more pain. No more suffering. If I could freeze time, let it be that moment at Pinecrest Heights—when he smiled at me like I mattered.

November 20th. Snow.

The pain is unbearable. My time's running out. Soon, I'll see Grandpa Henry and my baby again. They're waiting for me. I just want to hold her one more time, tell her how much I love her. Tell her... her father loved her too. He just didn't know it yet.'

Alexander's vision blurred.

What had blinded him all these years?

He turned the page. The final entry, dated the day before his engagement to Victoria, nearly stopped his heart.

'February 20th. Clear skies.

I hope I never meet him again.'

Ten words. Ten nails in the coffin of his soul.

She hadn't just stopped loving him—she'd erased him.

Tears fell, hot and unchecked.

Sleep became impossible without pills. Yet even drugged, she haunted his dreams, her face pale in the moonlight, her voice whispering never again.

By day, he drowned himself in work, desperate to outrun the memories.

Victoria watched, seething.

She brought Ethan, hoping to pull Alexander back. But he barely glanced at their son.

Fury drove her to hire a psychic, to curse Evelyn's name, to burn her birth chart.

She'd thought Evelyn's death would free her.

She was wrong.

Days bled into weeks, and still, Alexander barely acknowledged her. Worse—he'd begun ignoring Ethan too.

Victoria's perfect life was crumbling, and the ghost of Evelyn Sinclair was winning.
###Chapter 153

Every waking moment, she dreamed of becoming Alexander's wife, of finally bearing the prestigious title of Mrs. Blackwood. Yet three years had slipped by without any progress in their relationship.

Three years of waiting had worn her patience thin.

The golden afternoon sun bathed Willowbrook Airport in warm light. A cherubic little girl tugged at the hem of a young woman's sundress.

"Mommy, I'm hungry," Amelia whined, her big eyes pleading.

The woman turned gracefully, her chestnut waves catching the breeze. A radiant smile lit up her striking features as she scooped up the elfin child. "Let's find something delicious, sweetheart."

As she walked, heads turned. Her effortless elegance commanded attention, drawing admiring glances from passersby.

After settling their luggage, she took Amelia out for food.

"Burger first, Mommy!"

"Of course, darling." Vivian Prescott chuckled.

"You're the best mommy ever!" Amelia threw her tiny arms around Vivian's neck, planting a loud kiss on her cheek.

Vivian's laughter revealed charming dimples. She tweaked her daughter's nose. "Such flattery! Who taught you that?"

"Daddy did!" Amelia declared solemnly.

Vivian's smile faltered momentarily before she masked it with another laugh.

The Golden Arches buzzed with weekend crowds.

Hand in hand, they ordered at the counter before finding a booth.

Soon, Amelia's crystal blue eyes sparkled with desire. "Mommy, I want that!" She pointed at a plush toy accompanying the children's meal.

"Wait here, sweet pea. I'll get your ducky."

"Thank you, Mommy!"

Vivian returned to the counter. When she turned back, her blood ran cold - the booth stood empty.

Her carefully constructed calm shattered. For the first time in years, panic clawed at her throat.

Then she spotted them - a tall, broad-shouldered man rising from a corner table with Amelia beside him.

"Thank you, mister!" Amelia's polite voice carried across the room.

Vivian's breath caught when the man turned his profile.

Her fingers trembled as she retrieved her sunglasses. Just as she prepared to intervene, a familiar figure materialized between the tables.

Victoria Lancaster.

The woman who'd murdered her newborn, scarred her face, stolen her sight, and cruelly deceived her with fake photographs of her dead child.

Fate had a twisted sense of humor.

Behind her dark lenses, Vivian's eyes narrowed.

'Victoria Lancaster, since I survived, your days are numbered.'

'This time, I'll make you pay in blood.'

Amelia suddenly looked up, spotting Vivian. Her face lit up with recognition, tiny lips parting to call out—
###Chapter 154

Evelyn pressed a finger to her lips, and little Amelia instantly understood. The child sealed her mouth shut with an adorable pout.

Across from them, Victoria's face darkened as she watched Alexander cradle the little girl. She forced a smile, though her nails dug into her palms.

"Alexander, whose child is that? Ethan's waiting outside—we should go." Her saccharine tone contrasted sharply with the venomous glare she shot at Amelia.

The resemblance between this brat and that peasant Evelyn was uncanny.

"Go ahead with Ethan. I'm waiting for her parents," Alexander replied coldly, his gaze lingering on Amelia's face. An inexplicable pull tugged at his chest.

Victoria's carefully planned outing was crumbling. She stormed off, nearly colliding with Evelyn in her haste.

The impact sent Evelyn's tray clattering to the floor. Soda splashed across Victoria's designer dress, the ice cubes clinging to the soaked fabric like translucent leeches.

"You clumsy oaf!" Victoria shrieked, whirling toward Alexander with crocodile tears. "This woman ruined my Dior ensemble!"

Alexander barely registered her complaint. His attention snagged on Evelyn's silhouette—the way her hair caught the light, the graceful slope of her neck. His pulse stuttered.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow at Victoria's tantrum. "The blind leading the blind, Miss Lancaster. You barreled into me like a spooked thoroughbred."

"How dare—" Victoria's tirade died mid-sentence. Her face paled as she finally registered Evelyn's features beneath the sunglasses. That jawline. Those lips.

Impossible.

Evelyn's smirk deepened. "Cat got your tongue? Or did you see a ghost?"

Victoria's throat worked soundlessly before she scrambled back to Alexander. "I-I feel faint. Take me home."

"Put me down, mister," Amelia demanded, wriggling free.

Alexander complied, but his eyes remained locked on Evelyn as she turned. Sunlight haloed her profile when she shook her hair back, revealing porcelain skin beneath the tinted lenses.

His breath hitched.

"Sir," Evelyn purred, stepping closer, "is this shrieking harpy your wife?"

The cadence of her voice extinguished Alexander's fleeting hope.

Not her.

That voice didn't belong to the woman who haunted his dreams.
###Chapter 155

She was gone from this world. All that remained were ashes in an urn.

"Of course I'm Alexander's wife. The whole of Willowbrook knows this!" Victoria couldn't wait to proclaim her relationship with Alexander.

Evelyn suddenly realized. "So you're that famous Miss Lancaster, Victoria Montgomery?"

Victoria's arrogant smirk returned at these words.

But after a brief pause, Evelyn continued, "The woman who drove her sister Evelyn to despair by stealing her identity before taking her sister's husband? You're that homewrecker, Victoria Montgomery, aren't you?"

Victoria's face darkened, though she quickly plastered on an innocent expression.

"How dare you spread such lies? When did I ever steal my sister's husband? Alexander and I have always belonged together, isn't that right, Alexander? The one you've loved all along has only ever been me," she said, gazing at Alexander with practiced devotion.

Yet Alexander's attention remained fixed on Evelyn. His piercing stare seemed determined to see through her sunglasses.

Her resemblance to Evelyn was uncanny, even without seeing her eyes.

"Let's go," Alexander finally said, turning to leave.

Noticing the judgmental stares from bystanders, Victoria shot Evelyn a venomous glare before scurrying after Alexander.

Evelyn watched Alexander's retreating figure and called out, "Mr. Blackwood, does your silence mean you agree with what I just said?"

Alexander froze just as he reached for the door handle.

She had deliberately humiliated them publicly.

Victoria was the mistress, Alexander the cheating husband. Their wealthy backgrounds couldn't erase their shameful actions.

Evelyn expected Alexander to defend Victoria angrily.

Instead, he turned with a devastating smile.

Three years had only enhanced his striking presence.

His magnetic charm made several women nearby blush.

"You seem quite interested in my personal affairs, Miss." He handed her a business card with a smirk. "Call me anytime if you'd like the full story."

Evelyn accepted the card with an enigmatic smile. "I believe we'll be seeing each other very soon."

Alexander's gaze lingered on Evelyn's wedding ring before her words snapped him back to reality.

Victoria didn't understand Alexander's actions, but recognized his fascination with that face.

That evening, Evelyn stood by her hotel window, working on her laptop.

She picked up Alexander's card, examined it briefly, then tossed it aside with a scoff.

'Alexander, you never expected me to still be alive, did you?'

"Mommy, Mommy, look! It's that mean lady!" A little girl toddled over, handing Evelyn a phone.

The screen showed a viral video of Evelyn's confrontation with Victoria at Golden Arches. Someone had filmed the entire scene.

As Willowbrook's most prominent figure, Alexander's personal life was public knowledge.

Now Victoria's refusal to apologize after bumping into someone and her entitled attitude were exposed for all to see. The internet roasted her for being a spoiled socialite without basic manners.

In contrast, Evelyn received widespread praise for her grace under pressure. Many commented she carried herself like true aristocracy. Speculation ran wild about her appearance beneath those sunglasses.

Closing her laptop, Evelyn gazed at the city lights beyond the window, her lips curling into a cold smile.

'Victoria, this is only the beginning.'
###Chapter 156

The air inside Blackwood Estate was thick with tension.

Alexander sat by the bedside, his fingers scrolling through his phone. A viral video played on the screen—Victoria's vicious behavior laid bare for the world to see.

His brows furrowed.

Was this really the sweet girl he once knew as Lillian?

He dismissed the thought quickly, but his gaze lingered on Evelyn’s face in the video.

His pulse quickened.

The resemblance was uncanny.

Yet, no matter how similar, the truth remained—Evelyn was gone forever.

A sharp ache pierced his chest at the memory of her smile.

Evelyn…

"Alexander, are you awake?" A soft knock interrupted his thoughts. Victoria’s voice floated through the door. "Alexander, you saw the video, didn’t you? I’m being framed. I need you."

Her tone was pleading. "And the boutique on Diamond Boulevard—you promised it for my birthday. Remember?"

Silence stretched in response.

Before she could knock again, Margaret Blackwood pulled her away sharply. "You know he hasn’t slept properly in years. Don’t disturb him now that he finally is."

Victoria’s lips pressed into a thin line. "But didn’t your husband get that special aromatherapy blend from overseas? His insomnia has improved!"

"That’s no excuse to bother him!" Margaret snapped, though she usually indulged Victoria.

Fury simmered in Victoria’s chest. She bit back her anger. "It’s Evelyn’s fault he’s like this!"

Margaret scoffed. "That wretched woman got what she deserved."

Then she narrowed her eyes. "And don’t dismiss that perfumer’s work. If it didn’t work, why is Alexander finally resting?"

Victoria rolled her eyes. "Some rising star perfumer? Please. It’s all hype. His improvement is because of me."

Margaret gave her a skeptical look. "Genevieve’s blends are in high demand for a reason. If they were fake, would Alexander be sleeping now?"

Victoria’s nails dug into her palms.

Genevieve.

She’d heard whispers about this mysterious perfumer.

A plan formed in her mind.

If she could get her hands on one of those blends…

She made a call. "Find Genevieve. I want her strongest formula. Immediately."

The order was placed, the payment extravagant.

Three days.

That was all she needed.

After the auction, she would make sure Alexander never left her side again.
###Chapter 157

Evelyn Sinclair took a slow sip of her coffee, savoring the rich aroma.

Her phone screen lit up with the notification of a massive transfer into her bank account. A satisfied smile curved her lips as she picked up the small handheld mirror.

She studied her reflection, fingers brushing lightly over the smooth skin where scars once marred her face. Even now, the faintest touch sent a phantom sting through her nerves.

Setting the mirror down, she straightened her posture, the elegant lines of her tailored suit accentuating her figure. Without hesitation, she stepped into the high-end boutique next door.

Meanwhile, the elite of Willowbrook gathered at the city’s most luxurious six-star hotel for an exclusive auction. The prize? A prime retail space in the heart of Diamond Boulevard.

Victoria Lancaster had coveted this location for months. She had dropped countless hints to Alexander Blackwood, hoping he would secure it for her.

After all, she had stolen Evelyn’s university design sketches and diary years ago. Even she couldn’t deny the brilliance of Evelyn’s work.

Though Eleanor Kingsley had entrusted her with two boutiques, Victoria remained unsatisfied.

Her ambition burned brighter—she would launch her own brand, dominate the industry, and crush every rising designer in her path.

Tonight, she would take the first step toward becoming an internationally renowned jewelry designer.

Victoria had spent hours perfecting her appearance. She wanted all eyes on her when she claimed victory.

More importantly, she wanted Alexander’s undivided attention.

Before leaving, she checked her phone again, frustration simmering when the perfumer still hadn’t replied about the aromatherapy kit.

Tonight’s success hinged on it.

Suppressing her irritation, she followed Alexander into the grand hall.

This was her moment. Surrounded by Willowbrook’s elite, she would shine.

Alexander looked devastatingly handsome in his custom black suit, his presence commanding the room effortlessly.

Victoria, draped in diamonds and an exquisite gown, walked beside him, her smile sweet and demure.

She basked in the envious glances from other women and the appreciative stares from men.

"Alexander, let’s sit here," she murmured, batting her lashes.

He withdrew his arm from her grip without a word.

If this hotel weren’t under his name, he wouldn’t have bothered attending.

The sudden emptiness in her grasp infuriated her, but she kept her mask in place.

The auction began, and Victoria settled beside him, preening.

Then, the crowd’s attention shifted.

All eyes turned toward the entrance.

Victoria’s smile faltered.

A slender, striking figure glided into the room, sunglasses perched elegantly on her face.

Victoria’s nails dug into her palms.

She recognized her instantly.

That woman from Golden Arches.

Alexander, who had been indifferent to the commotion, suddenly tensed.

His gaze locked onto the woman in the magnolia-white suit, his pulse quickening.

It was her.
###Chapter 158

Evelyn could see Victoria's forced smile peeking from beneath her oversized sunglasses.

She moved with effortless grace, feeling the weight of every gaze in the room fixed upon her.

Back in those days, she hadn't known how to apply makeup or style her hair. Even walking in heels had been a struggle.

She'd been the ugly duckling everyone pitied—someone even street beggars would look down on.

But now? The tables had turned.

A decade had transformed Evelyn Sinclair into someone unrecognizable from her past self.

With practiced ease, Evelyn settled into the empty seat behind Victoria, her posture radiating quiet confidence.

Alexander's piercing gaze never left her. Even now, his eyes remained locked on her figure.

Victoria noticed Alexander's attention drifting toward Evelyn. Her nails dug into her palms as jealousy flared.

Was Alexander really falling for this Evelyn lookalike? Just because she bore some resemblance to that wretched woman?

Evelyn felt Alexander's stare. Once, this was the attention she'd craved most in the world. Now? It meant nothing.

As she sat, whispers swirled around her like autumn leaves.

"Who is she? I've never seen her in our circles before."

"Those sunglasses are from Lady Belle's exclusive collection—only their top-tier clients can access those."

"There's something intriguing about her. I wish we could see her face properly."

"Intriguing? Please! She's probably some gold digger crashing the event. Today belongs to Victoria Lancaster—everyone knows Alexander Blackwood will win this auction for her birthday!"

Evelyn merely smiled behind her shades, letting the gossip wash over her.

The auctioneer arrived, making brief opening remarks before commencing the bidding.

The prize? A prime boutique on Diamond Boulevard with a starting bid of five million dollars.

Though everyone expected Alexander's victory, many still competed—the location promised astronomical returns.

With each bid, Victoria immediately countered, her confidence unshakable.

The price climbed to 8.8 million—an auspicious number. Victoria raised her paddle triumphantly.

Who would dare challenge her with the Blackwood and Montgomery names backing her?

"8.8 million going once," the auctioneer announced.

"8.8 million going twice." The room held its breath.

"8.8 million going—"

"Ten million."

The crisp interruption shattered Victoria's moment of triumph. Her euphoria plummeted into icy fury.

All eyes turned toward Evelyn, who lowered her paddle with elegant nonchalance. "Miss Lancaster, if you truly desire this property, by all means continue."

Victoria's expression darkened. She turned to Alexander with practiced sweetness. "Alexander, I've dreamed of owning this shop—"

"Then bid," Alexander replied coolly, his gaze still fixed on Evelyn.

Victoria's smile returned as she raised her paddle. "Eleven million!" She added the extra million with theatrical flourish.

Evelyn studied Alexander's impassive face. 'After all these years, you still indulge this venomous snake. Blind and heartless—you'll never see her true nature.'

With deliberate slowness, Evelyn parted her rosebud lips. "Fifteen million."
###Chapter 159

The moment the words left her lips, gasps echoed through the crowd. All eyes turned to her in stunned silence.

Victoria's fingers trembled around the bidding card, her manicured nails digging into the thick paper. How dare this woman challenge her publicly? Who did she think she was?

With calculated precision, Victoria raised her card again. The audience leaned forward, expecting a dramatic increase.

"Fifteen million five hundred thousand," she declared through gritted teeth.

Before the auctioneer could acknowledge her bid, Evelyn's cool voice cut through the tension. "Twenty million."

A collective gasp rippled through the room.

Victoria's blood boiled. Forcing her signature sweet smile, she turned to Evelyn. "Excuse me, miss, but are you representing another bidder? Everyone knows this shop is meant to be my birthday gift from my fiancé." Her voice dripped with false concern. "Surely you're not the type to take what belongs to others?"

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Taking what belongs to others? That sounds more like your specialty, Miss Lancaster."

Victoria's smile faltered. "W-what do you mean by that?"

"Nothing at all," Evelyn replied smoothly. "I'm simply following auction protocol. Unless your name is already on the deed, the highest bidder wins. That's how these things work, isn't it?"

Victoria's grip on her clutch tightened until her knuckles turned white. She shot Alexander a pleading look. "Alexander..."

Alexander studied Evelyn with an unreadable expression before turning to Victoria. "She's correct about the rules."

The auctioneer's voice boomed through the speakers, confirming Evelyn's winning bid. As the gavel came down with finality, Victoria's perfect facade cracked.

All eyes followed Evelyn as she ascended the stage with effortless grace. There was something mesmerizing about her presence - an aura that commanded attention without trying.

"And what name shall we put on the contract, my dear?" the auctioneer asked warmly.

"Prescott," Evelyn replied. "Vivian Prescott."

Alexander's brow furrowed slightly at the unfamiliar surname.

Meanwhile, Victoria stood seething, her manicured nails leaving crescent marks on her palms. This was supposed to be her night, her moment in the spotlight. How dare this nobody steal her thunder?

The contract signing proceeded smoothly, with the auctioneer officially declaring Evelyn the new owner of the Diamond Boulevard property. Applause filled the grand ballroom.

From behind her sunglasses, Evelyn watched Victoria's barely contained rage with quiet satisfaction. Just as she was about to descend the stage, Alexander rose from his seat.

"Alexander!" Victoria called after him, but he didn't turn back.

Mounting the stage, Alexander studied Evelyn intently before speaking. "As owner of this venue, I congratulate you on your successful bid." He extended his hand. "Miss Prescott."

Victoria's stomach churned at the sight of Alexander's outstretched hand toward this stranger. The irony wasn't lost on her.

Evelyn hesitated only a moment before removing her sunglasses. The instant her eyes met Alexander's, the air between them crackled with electricity.

Alexander's breath caught. His hand remained suspended mid-air as recognition dawned.

With deliberate slowness, Evelyn reached out and clasped his frozen hand. "Thank you," she said softly, her voice carrying a weight of unspoken history.
###Chapter 160

"Thank you."

The whispered words lingered in his ear like a ghost's touch. Yet they struck Alexander Blackwood's heart like a sledgehammer.

When his gaze fell upon that breathtaking face before him, Alexander turned to stone. In that single heartbeat, all sensation abandoned him.

He wondered if this was some cruel dream.

The vision before him was painfully beautiful.

Agonizingly familiar!

"Evelyn!"

Her name tore through his mind like a scream.

His heart, dormant for three long years, jolted violently awake.

Vivian Prescott watched Alexander's reaction with quiet amusement dancing in her eyes. "Surprised, Alexander?"

"Your despised ex-wife isn't dead after all."

"But I'm no longer that foolish Evelyn Sinclair who loved you to the point of self-destruction."

"Excuse me, Mr. Blackwood. I have pressing matters to attend to." Vivian withdrew her hand gracefully, brushing past him with effortless poise.

The moment her warmth left his grasp, reality crashed back. Her intoxicating perfume enveloped him as he spun to watch her stride toward the side exit.

Without hesitation, Alexander pursued.

The crowd below the stage erupted in murmurs. Though some had seen Evelyn before, three years had erased her from public memory.

They only saw a striking beauty who seemed... hauntingly familiar.

Neon lights painted the night city in kaleidoscopic hues.

Vivian had barely stepped outside when she spotted Alexander's reflection in a parked car's side mirror. His expression was thunderous, unreadable.

"Evelyn!" His voice cracked through the night.

A secret smile played on her lips as she continued walking, watching his pursuit through peripheral glances. His hand shot out, capturing her wrist.

"Evelyn!" The name burst from him, raw with disbelief.

She stopped. Innocent confusion washed over her features. "Mr. Blackwood, why are you following me? Why are you touching me?"

Alexander's dark eyes bored into hers. The night shadows carved his face into something primal. "Evelyn, you're alive!" His grip tightened.

As if she might vanish like morning mist.

He wouldn't lose her again. Not this time.

Vivian tilted her head. "Mr. Blackwood, you're mistaken. My name is Vivian Prescott."

His gaze darkened further. "You are! You're Evelyn!"

He studied her eyes. Even if this was some doppelgänger, no one else possessed those soul-piercing depths.

After a calculated pause, Vivian laughed lightly. "I've heard Evelyn was your monstrous ex-wife. Do I resemble her? Did you chase me because you thought your hated wife returned from the grave?"
###Chapter 161

Alexander Blackwood's expression turned icy at Evelyn Sinclair's words.

His lips pressed into a tight line as he suddenly reached for her chin.

Evelyn hadn't anticipated the move, but she swiftly evaded his grasp. "Mr. Blackwood," she said coolly, "you have a fiancée. Show some restraint."

His gaze remained sharp, piercing through her. "If you're really not her, then prove it. Show me your left chest."

He would never forget the small mole on Evelyn's fair skin—a tiny mark that had once captivated him.

Her face darkened.

"Are you serious?" she scoffed. "You expect me to bare myself to you? Let go."

His grip tightened slightly. "Is it guilt that stops you? Evelyn, why aren’t you dead?"

Why didn’t you come back if you were alive?

Why do I still exist in your thoughts? Do you wish I had stayed buried?

A bitter smile curved her lips. "Mr. Blackwood, you're delusional. My name is Vivian Prescott. I am not your late wife, Evelyn Sinclair. Release me, or I’ll call the authorities."

Just then, a sleek car pulled up beside them. The window rolled down, revealing a woman's curious face.

"Vivian! I heard you won the auction—congrats! Who’s this?" Her gaze flicked to Alexander’s hand still gripping Evelyn’s wrist. "Why is he holding you?"

Alexander found the woman’s tone grating.

Evelyn remained composed. "This is Alexander Blackwood, CEO of Blackwood Enterprises and heir to the most powerful family in Willowbrook."

The woman snorted. "Oh, him? What’s his excuse for manhandling you?"

Evelyn smirked. "He thinks I resemble his deceased ex-wife."

"Please," the woman scoffed. "Doppelgängers exist. Mr. Blackwood, if you're trying to flirt, get in line. Half the city’s men are already waiting for Vivian."

Alexander’s expression darkened further, his obsidian eyes never leaving Evelyn’s face.

Seizing the distraction, she pulled free and slipped into the car.

The moment her wrist left his grasp, an unsettling emptiness settled in his chest.

"Until next time, Mr. Blackwood."

She flashed him a final, enigmatic smile before the window rolled up, sealing her away.

As the car disappeared into the night, Evelyn exhaled, smoothing a strand of hair from her forehead.

Alexander stood motionless, the darkness swallowing his silhouette.

Same face. Same voice.

But she insisted she wasn’t Evelyn.

His frown deepened.

His pulse steadied.

No, she couldn’t be.

Evelyn had never looked at him with such sharp, knowing eyes. She had never smiled like that—like she held every secret in the world.

She had been simple. Devoted.

His chest tightened again.

Victoria Lancaster finally found him, breathless. "Alexander! Who was that woman—?"

He ignored her, striding away without a word.

That night, he called Lucas Grant. "Dig up everything on Vivian Prescott. I want it by morning."

Sleep eluded him. Only the faint scent of lavender from his aromatherapy diffuser lulled him into restless slumber.

At dawn, he stormed into his office. Lucas handed him the file, his expression uneasy.

"Sir… this woman…" He hesitated. "She looks exactly like Evelyn Sinclair. Your late wife."
###Chapter 162

Alexander's hands stilled mid-air as he reached for the documents. "You're dismissed."

Lucas didn't question the abrupt dismissal before exiting the office.

The papers contained sparse details about Vivian Prescott. Born and raised in F Country, she'd never visited Willowbrook before.

Her psychology degree and eclectic hobbies were listed, but her social life remained a mystery. Only one detail stood out - a close male companion.

Her fiancé.

Alexander's chest tightened. He remembered the engagement ring glinting on her finger during their first encounter at Golden Arches.

He lit a cigarette, exhaling a cloud of smoke that obscured his troubled expression. The photograph in his hands blurred as his thoughts wandered.

After a moment, he shifted focus to Olivia Bennett.

Olivia had been the one to deliver Evelyn's body to the funeral home. She'd emerged holding the urn while Alexander stood paralyzed with grief.

Back then, he'd never questioned whether those ashes truly belonged to Evelyn.

But now...

Alexander spent the entire day surveilling Olivia's office. He'd even hired someone to monitor her calls, yet found nothing suspicious.

As Evelyn's closest friend, Olivia would surely know if she were alive. Unless Evelyn was deliberately avoiding contact to maintain her cover.

A DNA test would provide answers, but the ashes were long gone.

Evelyn rose early to braid Amelia's hair before kindergarten drop-off. As she turned to leave, movement at the gate caught her eye.

A small boy approached, his features achingly familiar.

Ethan Blackwood.

At five years old, he'd lost his baby fat, his sharpening features mirroring Alexander's. The sight of Victoria's child always resurrected painful memories of her own lost daughter.

Evelyn clenched her fists, then forced them open as burning resentment threatened to surface.

Suddenly, Ethan spotted her.

His cherubic face registered shock. "Maddie!" he called out.

Evelyn schooled her features into a gentle smile. "Are you talking to me, sweetheart?"

Ethan's intelligent eyes studied her with confusion before he looked away. "Sorry. Wrong person." He hurried toward the entrance.

"Ethan."

Alexander's voice froze Evelyn in place. She turned slowly.

He approached with lethal grace, the morning sunlight doing nothing to warm his icy demeanor. His penetrating gaze held hers for a loaded moment before turning to his son.

Alexander handed Ethan a lunchbox without a word. The exchange was so impersonal they might have been strangers.

Ethan took the food and disappeared inside, leaving Evelyn and Alexander standing meters apart in charged silence.
###Chapter 163

Alexander had grown accustomed to these unexpected encounters. His brows arched slightly as he studied Evelyn's flawless features.

He distinctly remembered the two deep scars that once marred the right side of her face. Those wounds never fully healed, remaining until her last breath.

Yet the woman before him now possessed unblemished skin and a radiant smile. She was breathtaking.

"Miss Prescott, fate seems determined to intertwine our paths," Alexander remarked casually.

Evelyn met his gaze with a dazzling smile. "How refreshing to see you sober today, Mr. Blackwood. No more confusing me with your deceased ex-wife."

A shadow crossed Alexander's features, though he maintained his composure. "Would you honor me with your company for dinner?"

Evelyn tilted her head thoughtfully. "Dinner won't work, but I'm available for lunch today."

Alexander's heart leapt at her acceptance. The joy lasted mere seconds before a sharp pang of regret pierced through him.

Memories of Evelyn flooded his mind - how she'd prepare his meals daily, waiting patiently for his return. And how he'd never appreciated her.

Now he sought to recapture lost happiness through this doppelgänger.

Evelyn returned to her boutique, overseeing final renovations before the grand opening. Before eleven struck, Alexander arrived in a gleaming white limited-edition sports car.

The vehicle drew immediate attention, but all eyes shifted to the striking man who emerged. In his prime, with aristocratic features, Alexander embodied every woman's fantasy.

He opened the passenger door with practiced elegance. As Evelyn settled into the leather seat, bitter amusement twisted her lips.

How ironic - the wife he'd forbidden from touching his car now sat where she'd once longed to be, while he showered attention on a stranger.

Alexander chose an upscale downtown restaurant. Evelyn recognized it instantly - the same window table where he'd once humiliated her.

His order mirrored that fateful meal down to the drinks. 'Does he still suspect I'm his despised ex-wife? Is this entire lunch an interrogation?'

"Miss Prescott, as our city's newest resident, you must try these signature dishes," Alexander offered graciously.

"Thank you, though I prefer grapes with steak. Would you mind ordering wine instead?"

Alexander's eyes gleamed with interest. "But of course."

Meanwhile, Victoria sensed something amiss since yesterday. Alexander's unusual interest in that boutique thief unsettled her.

Her hired tail delivered damning photos - blurred but unmistakably showing Alexander with a woman.

"That scheming harlot!" Victoria seethed, grabbing her purse the moment she learned of their lunch date.
###Chapter 164

Evelyn Sinclair arrived at the café, her eyes immediately drawn to Alexander Blackwood seated by the window. Even from behind, his broad shoulders and confident posture were unmistakable—she would recognize him anywhere.

But there was no sign of the woman who was supposed to be sitting across from him.

Evelyn frowned.

Had she already left? Maybe she was in the restroom.

Without bothering to greet Alexander, Evelyn strode toward the ladies' room, scanning the café for anyone matching the woman’s description from the photo she’d seen.

No one.

Her jaw clenched.

After smoothing her dress and fixing her expression into something pleasant, she turned back—only to find Alexander’s seat empty.

Her heart lurched.

She rushed to the elevator, catching just a glimpse of his sleek silver sports car speeding away.

And in the passenger seat—a woman.

Evelyn’s fingers trembled as she dialed his number.

The line rang.

And rang.

No answer.

That night, Evelyn sat at her desk, sketching new jewelry designs with quiet intensity.

A small figure barreled into her, climbing onto her lap like an eager kitten.

"Mommy! Mommy!" Amelia beamed, waving a bright pink lollipop. "A boy gave this to me today! It’s so yummy!"

Evelyn smiled, pressing a kiss to her daughter’s soft curls. "Did you thank him?"

Amelia nodded vigorously. "I gave him my yellow duckie, but he didn’t want it!"

Evelyn chuckled. "Maybe next time—"

"I know! I’ll give him my sparkly hair clip tomorrow!" Amelia declared, wriggling free and darting toward the coffee table.

Evelyn’s smile faltered.

"Amelia," she called carefully. "What was the boy’s name?"

"Ethan Blackwood!" Amelia chirped. "Just like me!"

Evelyn’s breath caught.

Before she could respond, her phone buzzed.

A familiar, soothing voice answered. "Settling in alright in Willowbrook?"

"Yes," Evelyn murmured. Then, after a pause, "When are you coming back?"

The man on the other end sensed the shift in her tone. "What’s wrong?"

"Amelia met Ethan Blackwood today. She… seems fond of him."

"They’re children, Evelyn. Don’t overthink it." His voice was steady, reassuring. "Get some rest."

She exhaled slowly. "You too. Goodnight."

The call ended, but her thoughts raced.

If not for him, she would have died years ago.

Instead, she had rebuilt herself—stronger, sharper.

Now, she was back in Willowbrook.

And revenge was within reach.

She pulled up photos of Alexander and Victoria Lancaster’s engagement online, her fingers tightening around her phone.

The memory of that day—of the "gift" she’d left for them—flashed through her mind.

Victoria’s birthday as the prized Montgomery heiress was coming soon.

And Evelyn intended to make it unforgettable.

The next few days were a blur of preparation for the grand opening of her boutique on Diamond Boulevard.

No one knew what she had endured these past three years.

No one suspected the storm brewing beneath her polished exterior.

But she knew.

Power was the only currency that mattered.

And she would wield it ruthlessly.

Meanwhile, Victoria had noticed something unsettling.

Alexander had been visiting Diamond Boulevard daily.

He never entered the shops.

Just sat in his car.

Talking to a woman.

A woman whose silhouette was hauntingly familiar.

The same woman from Golden Arches.

The one who looked like Evelyn Sinclair.

After some digging, Victoria finally had a name.

Vivian Prescott.
###Chapter 165

Victoria Lancaster sensed danger looming. With practiced ease, she faked another ankle injury, instructing her mother Margaret Dawson to embellish the story to Alexander Blackwood. Her goal? Lure him back to the Montgomery estate.

The lavish bedroom sprawled before her, every surface adorned with opulence. Even the walk-in closet overflowed with designer labels that rightfully belonged to Evelyn Sinclair. Victoria felt no remorse—not even for Sophia Montgomery's death, which filled her with smug satisfaction over her ruthless efficiency.

Only a woman of her intellect and cunning deserved high society's privileges. Neither Evelyn nor Sophia had been worthy opponents. How could she possibly lose to some upstart like Vivian Prescott?

Hearing Alexander's approaching footsteps, Victoria instantly transformed into a fragile invalid. She arranged herself pitifully against the pillows, eyes glistening with manufactured tears. "Alexander, you came."

His gaze dropped to her heavily bandaged leg. "Are you hurt badly?"

"Now that you're here, the pain is bearable." Victoria extended a trembling hand, desperate for his touch.

Alexander remained just out of reach. "If you're stable, I should return to work. My schedule is packed today."

Victoria's expression shattered. "Alexander, don't go!" In a calculated move, she tumbled dramatically from the bed, sobbing as she clutched at his trousers. "Please don't leave me alone!"

Tears streamed down her cheeks as she launched into her rehearsed speech. "Why this coldness after three years? Why won't you marry me? Have you stopped loving me? Forgotten your promise to make me your wife? Or do you believe Evelyn's dying lie that I blinded her?"

Alexander froze at the word "lie." Why did it suddenly sound so hollow?

"Alexander—"

His ringing phone interrupted her. Vivian's melodic voice carried clearly through the speaker. "Mr. Blackwood, the orchids arrived. They're exquisite."

The silence amplified every word. Victoria recognized that voice instantly—Vivian! Rage boiled in her veins as Alexander responded with uncharacteristic warmth. She nearly combusted on the spot.

"Rest well. I have meetings." His curt dismissal preceded retreating footsteps.

Moments later, an engine roared to life outside. Victoria sprang from bed, humiliation and fury propelling her into a destructive rampage. Designer pillows flew, crystal vases shattered against walls.

After purging her anger, she selected a couture dress and matching Birkin before storming to Diamond Boulevard. The boutique's entrance overflowed with floral arrangements—including Alexander's distinctive white orchids. Seeing them, Victoria's vision tinted red.

She entered with forced poise, maintaining her socialite mask despite the inferno inside. This upscale shopping district meant potential paparazzi everywhere. But remembering how Alexander had prioritized Vivian over her, her smile turned brittle.

"Vivian Prescott! Show yourself!" Her shrill demand turned heads.

A sales associate approached. "Miss, may I help you locate our owner?"

"Owner?" Victoria's laugh dripped venom. "Fetch Vivian immediately. I demand an audience."

She barely finished when a cool voice spoke behind her. "I'm Vivian. Miss Lancaster, what an unexpected... pleasure."
###Chapter 166

The moment Evelyn heard that voice, fury ignited in her chest.

For three long years, she had endured Alexander's cold indifference. Now, this woman had the audacity to waltz in and steal his attention? It made her blood boil.

But after the incident at Golden Arches, Evelyn had been working hard to control her temper. She forced a sweet smile. "So you're Vivian Prescott, the woman who's been getting awfully close to my fiancé lately—"

She turned as she spoke, but the words died in her throat the second she saw that face.

Her breath hitched.

Eyes wide, she stared in disbelief.

"H-how—Evelyn?!" Victoria stumbled back, her voice trembling. "This isn't possible!"

Her mind screamed in denial.

That blind wretch burned to ashes years ago! There's no way she's standing here now!

Impossible!

Vivian watched the panic flicker across Victoria's face with quiet satisfaction.

So you do know fear, Victoria Lancaster.

"Miss Lancaster, are you alright?" Vivian took a step forward, her tone dripping with false concern. "You look pale. Should I call a doctor?"

Victoria flinched away as if burned.

Vivian smirked. "What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost." She tilted her head. "Do I frighten you that much?"

Victoria finally regained her composure, her expression twisting into something ugly. "Evelyn. You're supposed to be dead."

Her gaze raked over Vivian's flawless face. "How are you alive? Your eyes, your scars—" How are they gone?!

Vivian feigned confusion. "Oh dear, you're mistaking me for that poor deceased Evelyn, just like Mr. Blackwood did."

Victoria narrowed her eyes. "You're saying... you're not Evelyn?"

Vivian laughed lightly, adjusting her stance in her designer heels. She towered over Victoria, looking down with amusement. "Take a good look, Miss Lancaster. Do I really resemble your late sister that much?"

Victoria studied her for a long moment before scoffing. "You do look similar, but you're nothing like Evie." Her lips curled in disdain. "My sister was meek and obedient. She would never shamelessly chase after another woman's fiancé!"

She made sure to say it loud enough for the entire boutique to hear.

Heads turned. Whispers started.

Vivian didn't flinch.

"Vivian Prescott," Victoria hissed, stepping closer. "Let me make this clear—if you value your reputation, stay away from Alexander. I won't let anyone ruin my marriage."

Her threat hung in the air, sharp as a blade.

Vivian merely smiled.
###Chapter 167

"Miss Lancaster, perhaps you should remain silent if you can't speak with civility. No one will mistake you for mute if you refrain from speaking. Mr. Blackwood and I have conducted ourselves with complete propriety. Even if you distrust me, surely you trust your own fiancé?"

"You—"

"If I recall correctly, even Miss Lancaster had questionable relationships before this engagement. Don't you find your accusations rather hypocritical?"

Victoria stood speechless, her expression darkening. Noticing the shifting gazes around them, she quickly adopted a wounded expression.

"Miss Prescott, I don't know what vicious rumors you've heard, but Alexander and I have always been together. It was my sister Evelyn who schemed to seduce him, forcing their marriage. Now that Evelyn is gone, I hate to bring this up—but I won't tolerate such slander!"

"You won't tolerate slander, yet you freely insult me to my face? Miss Lancaster, as the Montgomery heiress, do you consider yourself above common courtesy?"

Victoria's eyes welled up with practiced tears. "Miss Prescott, that wasn't my intention. I simply love Alexander so deeply that I—" She broke off with a delicate sob. "Forgive me for troubling you."

With dramatic flair, Victoria turned and fled the scene.

Moments later, two familiar figures entered the boutique. Evelyn would recognize Margaret Dawson and Richard Montgomery anywhere—the architects of her past torment.

She'd once believed their false affection, only to discover their vicious betrayal. Their brutal assault had nearly cost her life.

Now they scanned the shop with predatory intensity, clearly sent by Victoria.

A sales associate approached politely. "May I assist you with jewelry selections today?"

Margaret waved a dismissive hand. "We need a bracelet for our daughter, but require expert advice. Fetch your supervisor."

Their ploy was transparent. Hearing this, Evelyn turned calmly.

The staff member brightened. "Miss Prescott, these clients seek bracelet recommendations. Are you available?"

Evelyn smiled. "Certainly." She approached the couple with measured steps.

When they saw Evelyn's face, shock contorted their features. After their crimes, encountering her alive clearly unnerved them.

"Evelyn!"

"How—you're supposed to be dead!"

Margaret and Richard spoke simultaneously.

Evelyn arched a brow, maintaining her serene smile. "I seem to bear an uncanny resemblance to this Evelyn you mention. Did you visit specifically to scrutinize my appearance?"

"Resemblance? You are Evelyn!" Margaret jabbed an accusing finger. "I'd recognize that face anywhere! Explain yourself—why aren't you dead? What revenge plot brings you back? Trying to sabotage Victoria and Alexander? You vile creature! Surviving changes nothing—I'll finish what I started, you wretched—"

Margaret's tirade ended abruptly as her hand flew toward Evelyn's face.

The sharp crack of the slap echoed through the boutique.
###Chapter 168

Smack!

Margaret's slap didn't even graze Evelyn. Instead, her wrist was caught in a vice-like grip.

Every humiliation, every beating—Evelyn remembered them all.

The moment her vision had returned, she had vowed never to let anyone lay a hand on her again.

"Let go of me!" Margaret shrieked, thrashing in fury.

But Evelyn's grip was unyielding. Hatred had forged her strength—she was no longer the helpless victim they could torment.

"Madam, watch your tone," Evelyn said coldly. "If you're here as a customer, I'll serve you. If you're here to cause trouble, get out." Her voice was sharp, her gaze unflinching.

Margaret froze, momentarily stunned by the authority in Evelyn's stance.

Richard moved to intervene, but Evelyn was faster. She shoved Margaret's hand away with enough force to send the woman stumbling backward—straight into Richard.

He tried to dodge, but Margaret's weight sent them both crashing into a display counter. Jewelry clattered to the floor.

"Ow!" Margaret howled, then snarled, "You little witch!"

Evelyn smirked, her eyes burning with defiance.

A scratch?

After everything they'd done to her, this was nothing.

As Margaret and Richard scrambled up, a staff member picked up the shattered pieces. "You've damaged our merchandise. You'll pay for this."

"Pay? That bitch pushed me!" Margaret jabbed a finger at Evelyn. "You think you can get away with this? I'll make you regret it!"

Evelyn didn't flinch. Instead, she pulled out her phone. "Officer? Diamond Boulevard. Two unstable individuals are threatening me. One just said she wants to kill me. I need assistance immediately."

"You—you're calling the police?!" Margaret sputtered. "You think you can play innocent now? After everything we did to you? The way we broke you—"

"So you admit you tortured Evelyn Sinclair?" Evelyn arched a brow. "Who are you? Did she murder your family? Why hunt her even after her death?"

"Stop lying! You are Evelyn!"

Margaret lunged again, but security arrived just in time, restraining both her and Richard.

Moments later, police sirens wailed outside.

Victoria, waiting in her car, stiffened as officers marched in.

What had gone wrong?

Her parents were being hauled into a squad car.

An hour later, they finally emerged from the station—fuming.
###Chapter 169

Margaret Dawson wasted no time in bringing Richard Montgomery and Victoria Lancaster to the cozy villa they now called home—a gift from the Lancasters for raising their precious daughter.

Margaret ranted furiously, recounting every detail of the morning's events with venomous precision.

Victoria listened, her suspicion growing, but Richard shook his head firmly.

"That can't be Evelyn. Evelyn was never that bold!"

Margaret had been certain at first, but doubt had crept in the moment they left the police station. "Victoria, I think that woman just resembles her. She can't be Evelyn. She's been dead for three years—her body would have decayed by now. Alexander himself brought back her ashes. How could she possibly come back to life?"

Even so, Victoria couldn't shake her unease. "Is it really possible for two people to look that identical?"

"Maybe she saw a picture of Evelyn and decided to get plastic surgery to copy her face. Whatever the case, that Vivian woman is not Evelyn. Your father's right. That spineless fool could never carry herself like that! It's impossible! That worthless trash could never stand up to us!"

Listening to them, Victoria's doubts slowly faded. A smug smile curled her lips.

"You're right. Evelyn was nothing but a weak, pathetic fool. She could never be that commanding. And there's no way she'd have the money to buy a store on Diamond Boulevard, let alone secure a partnership with Lady Belle."

Margaret scoffed. "What kind of scam brand is that? A stupid brooch cost me 300,000, and one of the diamonds fell off!"

Victoria preened, flashing her bracelet and ring. "It's not a scam. It's the most coveted jewelry brand among elite women these past two years. The designs are exclusive and impossible to get. Here, Mom, take this. Eleanor Kingsley insisted on gifting it to me—it's worth 100,000!" She slid the bracelet into Margaret's eager hands.

Margaret's eyes gleamed. "Such a dutiful daughter. Speaking of which, what's going on with Alexander? He's been distant lately. Your fake birthday is coming up—why don't you pressure him into proposing then? With all those high-profile guests watching, he won't dare refuse!"

Victoria's lips curved into a wicked smile, a dark glint in her eyes.

"Alexander is mine. Whether it's Evelyn or Vivian, I'll destroy anyone who tries to take him from me."

A new scheme was already forming in her mind.

This time, she wouldn’t fail.

After the morning’s events, Evelyn felt a rare sense of satisfaction.

The shock and panic on Victoria and her parents' faces had only fueled her determination for revenge.

She checked the time, preparing to leave, when Alexander's sleek car pulled up in front of her boutique.

He stepped out, his tall frame exuding effortless elegance.

"Miss Prescott, care to join me for lunch?" he asked smoothly, approaching her.

Evelyn smirked coldly. "I don’t think so. Your precious fiancée might accuse me of seducing you."

She turned to walk away.

Alexander frowned, quickly piecing together what had happened.

He moved to follow her—just as her heel caught on a loose stone.

His heart lurched as she stumbled forward.

Instinct took over.

He lunged, catching her tightly in his arms.

"Evelyn."
###Chapter 170

Hearing Alexander call her "Evelyn" sent a jolt through her entire being.

She never expected Alexander to come running to her side and embrace her so desperately.

Evelyn tilted her head up, meeting Alexander's stormy gray eyes filled with undisguised concern.

Was that worry she saw in his gaze?

A flicker of confusion passed through Evelyn's mind as she felt Alexander's arms tighten around her. The heat radiating from his broad chest was unmistakable.

It was the same warmth she'd once ached for, but now left her completely indifferent.

"Thank you, Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn said coolly, her voice carefully neutral.

Alexander seemed to snap out of his daze, abruptly releasing her.

Straightening her blouse, Evelyn gave him a knowing look. "If I heard correctly, you just called me Evelyn? According to your fiancée, you despise your ex-wife. The woman who supposedly trapped you into marriage. Shouldn't you hate me too? Then why help me now?"

An uncomfortable silence stretched between them.

After what felt like an eternity, Alexander's lips curved into a practiced smile. "If you're so curious, get in the car."

Evelyn arched an eyebrow before nodding. "Fine. Consider my curiosity piqued."

No sooner had she buckled her seatbelt than her phone rang. The caller ID showed "Victoria Lancaster." Undoubtedly calling about the custom perfume blend.

Glancing at Alexander behind the wheel, Evelyn answered on speakerphone. Victoria's shrill voice immediately filled the car.

"It's been days! Where's my order? What exactly have you been doing with my money?"

The already tense atmosphere grew heavier. With the call on speaker, Alexander heard every word. His grip tightened on the steering wheel as recognition dawned.

Victoria continued her tirade, "Listen here - if I don't receive my package in three days, I'm filing fraud charges!"

Evelyn responded calmly, "The choice is yours - wait patiently or take your business elsewhere. Your money means nothing to me."

"You little—"

Evelyn ended the call mid-sentence and immediately processed the refund.

As silence returned to the car, Alexander feigned ignorance. "Who was that?"

Though he clearly recognized Victoria's voice, the nature of the call puzzled him. What was this about a perfume order?

Evelyn offered a careless smile. "Just another difficult client."

"A client?" Alexander's interest visibly piqued. "I thought you only managed the jewelry boutique."

Meeting his curious gaze, Evelyn's lips curved mysteriously. "You'll find out soon enough, Mr. Blackwood."

Alexander chuckled but didn't press further.

The sound struck Evelyn as ironic. When had he ever laughed so easily in her presence before?

'Alexander Blackwood,' she thought bitterly, 'my death certainly improved your mood.'

The ringing of Alexander's phone interrupted her thoughts.

He glanced at the screen and ignored it, but the persistent ringing forced him to finally answer via Bluetooth.

"What?" he snapped.

Evelyn recognized the hysterical female voice immediately - Margaret Dawson, Victoria's mother.

"Alexander! Victoria left a suicide note! She says she's going to that café where you first met! I don't even know where that is! You need to find her before she does something drastic!"

Evelyn heard every word crystal clear.

She suppressed an eye roll. Victoria's dramatic antics were nothing new.
###Chapter 171

Evelyn had just called Alexander moments ago, her tone sharp and demanding. Nothing in her voice suggested she might do anything reckless.

Yet Alexander's expression darkened. He seemed convinced, his concern for Evelyn's safety evident.

"If Mr. Blackwood is occupied, I can exit here," Vivian offered.

Alexander hesitated, his gaze lingering on her before finally pulling over.

Vivian stepped out gracefully, flashing him a polite smile. "Until next time, Mr. Blackwood."

She turned and walked away without looking back.

Alexander didn't drive off immediately. Through the rearview mirror, he watched her retreating figure, replaying the moment his fingers had instinctively closed around her wrist.

The answer pulsed clearly in his chest.

Only when the engine roared to life did Vivian glance back.

She quickly hailed a cab, instructing the driver to follow Alexander's car. To her surprise, their destination was Pinecrest Heights.

This place held her fondest memory—the first time she had met Alexander as a bright-eyed girl.

Why had he come here now? And why had he called her Eve while clutching her so desperately?

Before she could ponder further, a familiar silhouette caught her eye.

Victoria stood by the water's edge.

Vivian smirked. So this was where they'd first met too.

When Victoria spotted Alexander approaching, tears welled in her eyes.

"Alexander, do you remember our first meeting?" Her voice trembled, but his face remained impassive.

"We were so happy here. You promised to marry me, to cherish me forever. You swore to protect me, and I believed you. All these years, I waited, thinking our time would come. Yet despite everything, we're still not truly together." She wiped her tears dramatically, inching closer.

"Have you stopped loving me? Did Evelyn's poisonous words before she died poison your heart? Is that why you refuse to marry me?"

Her breath hitched. "If that's true... then let it all end here—"

Victoria spun toward the crashing waves.

Alexander watched her for a long moment before finally seizing her wrist.

Victoria melted into his arms, triumphant. "Alexander, I knew I still mattered to you! These years of being called a homewrecker meant nothing—as long as I have you!"

From the distant road, Vivian observed their embrace, her lips curling in disgust.

The sea breeze carried salt to her tongue. Sunlight danced on the waves like scattered diamonds.

A picturesque scene.

Yet it turned her stomach.

She pivoted to leave—just as Alexander looked up.

The glare obscured his vision, but not enough to miss that face.

Evelyn?

He shoved Victoria aside and sprinted toward the retreating figure.
###Chapter 172

Evelyn Sinclair hailed a cab at the curb, her fingers trembling as she gave the driver directions. The moment the car pulled away, her gaze caught on a street sign that read "Pinecrest Heights."

The name burned through her retinas like acid.

She clutched her chest, feeling something pure inside her shatter into irreparable pieces.

Filth. That's all this place represented now.

Alexander Blackwood arrived moments later, his polished shoes scuffing against the pavement as he scanned the area. All he saw was a taxi disappearing around the bend of Pinecrest Heights' winding roads.

His heart plummeted like an anchor into the nearby bay.

'She's gone.'

'Just like three years ago.'

The reminder did nothing to ease the hollow ache in his chest. He'd never truly accepted her disappearance.

"Alexander, what's wrong?" Victoria Lancaster's heels clicked urgently behind him, her perfectly manicured brows knitting in confusion at his abrupt departure from their lunch.

Alexander's glacial eyes swept over her. "Get in the car."

Victoria scrambled into the passenger seat, smoothing her designer skirt. The performance was over—now came the payoff.

"Alexander, my birthday is in two days." She dabbed nonexistent tears. "I don't need extravagant gifts, but Ethan...he's starting to ask why we don't live together like other parents. The other children call him—"

Alexander slammed the brakes mid-sentence, turning a scrutinizing gaze on her trembling lip.

"Answer one question truthfully."

Victoria's pulse spiked, but she maintained her doe-eyed expression. "Anything, darling."

"Did you know about Evelyn's pregnancy before I did?"

The blood drained from Victoria's face. Her nails bit into her palms as she shook her head. "Evelyn never shared that with me."

"Are you certain?" Alexander's voice held dangerous calm before he accelerated again, his profile unreadable.

Victoria seethed silently, cursing Vivian Prescott. That meddling woman had ruined everything! Without her interference, Alexander would've never doubted her or remembered Evelyn at all!

After dropping Victoria at the Montgomery estate, Alexander drove alone to the cemetery.

Golden hour light gilded the marble headstones as summer wind rustled through the oaks.

He knelt before a particular grave, arranging eighty-eight blood-red roses with meticulous care.

Eighty-eight for regret.

Regret was worthless.

What good were belated feelings when the person they belonged to was gone?

Exhaling a plume of cigarette smoke into the gathering twilight, Alexander studied the engraved name until shadows swallowed it whole.

The next morning, Evelyn walked into her boutique after dropping Amelia at school. Her assistant gestured discreetly to the occupied VIP room.

Since her rebirth with restored vision, she'd spent eighteen months building Lady Belle from scratch.

Every jewelry piece bore her signature craftsmanship—unconventional designs that catapulted her brand to international acclaim.

Naturally, elite clientele followed.

She moved to greet today's high-profile patron when a familiar laugh froze her mid-step.

Her limbs turned to lead.

"This set is perfect! But surely you have more? One collection isn't enough for my daughter's birthday!" Eleanor Kingsley's doting voice carried clearly through the door.

Evelyn had thought abandoning Alexander meant burying her longing for maternal love too.

The stabbing pain in her chest proved otherwise.
###Chapter 173

Her mother...

No, she was Victoria's mother.

Evelyn let out a bitter laugh, her mind replaying the painful memories of Eleanor and William striking her across the face to protect Victoria.

The humiliation still burned fresh in her mind.

She could still feel the sharp pain from William's kick that had made her cough up blood.

They never once looked at her with concern.

Evelyn's fingers dug into the doorframe as she watched Eleanor pull out her phone to call Victoria.

"Vicky darling, you can come out now. Let's go for a spa treatment, then we'll pick out your birthday outfit. Tomorrow's your special day when Alexander will propose. I want you to shine brighter than any star. My precious daughter deserves to be the most dazzling princess in the world."

Princess? Precious daughter?

The words twisted like a knife in Evelyn's heart.

She couldn't bear to listen anymore.

Turning abruptly, she didn't see the employee approaching with refreshments.

The tray crashed to the floor, scattering coffee cups and pastries.

"I'm so sorry, Miss Prescott! Terribly sorry!" The staff member frantically apologized.

Evelyn shook her head. "It was my fault. Don't worry about it."

As she spoke, Eleanor emerged from the private room.

"What's all this commotion?" Eleanor's gaze landed on Evelyn's back. "And you are...?"

"This is our boutique manager, Miss Prescott," another employee explained quickly.

Without turning around, Evelyn murmured, "Please excuse me. I have urgent matters to attend to. Everyone, please take good care of our guests."

Stepping outside, Evelyn couldn't shake Eleanor's doting words to Victoria.

Watching the city traffic flow by, a cold smile curved her lips.

Thanks to Victoria's social standing, tomorrow's birthday gala would be spectacular, attended by all the elite of Willowbrook.

Victoria planned to use public pressure to force Alexander's proposal.

The next morning found Victoria preening before her mirror, adjusting the custom couture gown and priceless jewels that would make her the undisputed queen of tonight's event.

From her balcony perch, she surveyed the arriving guests with satisfaction.

Her breath caught when Alexander's car pulled through the gates.

Rushing downstairs, she was disappointed to find him in casual attire instead of formal wear.

Still, his striking presence outshone every other man present.

"Alexander, you're here," she cooed. "Just seeing you makes me happier than anything."

"As long as you're happy," came his cool reply.

Something in his tone unsettled her, but she dared not question it.

She followed him into the garden where a magnificent seven-tiered cake was unveiled, topped with figurines of a bride and groom.

The crowd gathered as Eleanor and William nudged Alexander forward. "My daughter has waited long enough for your proposal. Don't you think it's time?"

"It's Victoria's birthday," William added. "What better occasion?"

"Propose! Propose!" the guests began chanting.

Victoria blushed prettily. "Alexander..."

Before she could continue, a melodious voice cut through the cheers.

"Miss Lancaster's birthday celebration is certainly... eventful. A public proposal? How fortunate I decided to attend tonight."
###Chapter 174

Evelyn Sinclair stood with a demure expression, her heart fluttering as she awaited Alexander Blackwood's response. The air around her seemed to sparkle with anticipation.

Just as the crowd began chanting for Alexander to propose, an unexpected voice sliced through the cheers.

Evelyn's radiant smile faltered, her fingers curling into tight fists. "Why is she here?" she hissed through clenched teeth.

Alexander spun around instantly at the familiar voice, his breath catching at the sight of the face that haunted his dreams.

All eyes turned toward the interruption. A stunning woman in an elegant gown moved gracefully through the crowd, her presence commanding attention. When Eleanor Kingsley and William Montgomery recognized her, their faces drained of color.

"Evelyn?! But—how?" Eleanor gasped, stumbling backward. Only William's steadying arm prevented her from collapsing.

William maintained his composure, though his pulse quickened. He'd never believed in ghosts, yet here stood someone who was supposed to be dead.

Victoria Lancaster had imagined this day would be all about her. But Vivian Prescott's sudden appearance shattered that illusion.

As Victoria reached for Alexander's sleeve, she found only empty air—he was already striding toward Vivian.

"Alexander!" Victoria called desperately, but he didn't pause.

Vivian moved with effortless grace, her emerald gown accentuating her slender figure. The gentle curve of her lips held secrets, and her eyes sparkled with quiet confidence.

Alexander couldn't tear his gaze away. The resemblance was uncanny—this was how Evelyn should have looked, had he ever truly seen her.

"Mr. Blackwood," Vivian greeted warmly. "What perfect timing. I've always wanted to witness a proposal firsthand."

Alexander's voice dropped to an intimate murmur. "Then I'm afraid you've come for nothing."

Vivian arched a perfect eyebrow. "Oh?"

"Miss Prescott," Victoria interjected with forced cheerfulness. "What brings you to our home unannounced?"

Vivian's smile never wavered. "I heard it was Miss Lancaster's special day. I couldn't possibly miss the chance to deliver my gift."

Victoria's polite mask slipped momentarily. "We barely know each other. How did you—"

Her words trailed off as memories surfaced—three years ago, another celebration interrupted, another woman bearing gifts that changed everything.

Vivian's gaze flickered to Alexander. "Let's just say someone cares deeply about making your day perfect."

Victoria's eyes darted to Alexander, a flush creeping up her neck. Even through her irritation, the implication sent a thrill through her.
###Chapter 175

Evelyn's next words shattered Victoria's moment of triumph instantly.

"Yes, I'm clearly talking about your mother."

"What?" Victoria looked like she'd been slapped. "What does my mother have to do with this?"

"Yesterday, your mother visited my boutique to purchase two jewelry sets for you," Evelyn explained calmly.

Understanding dawned on Victoria, but her smile vanished.

Watching the exchange, Eleanor and William exchanged glances. "Did Victoria just call her Miss Prescott?"

William was equally confused, unsure of what was unfolding. The moment they saw Evelyn approach Victoria, they hurried over, fearing Evelyn might do something drastic.

As they drew closer, they heard Alexander say to Evelyn, "Since you're here, come inside and join us."

"No! We can't let that woman into our home!" William shouted immediately.

Evelyn ignored the sting of their words, maintaining her composed smile as she turned toward them.

Before her stood her own parents, yet their gazes held even more venom than they had three years ago.

Evelyn wondered what sins she must have committed in a past life to endure such torment now.

"You must be Mr. and Mrs. Kingsley? Allow me to introduce myself—I'm Vivian Prescott." She extended a business card with practiced grace.

Eleanor and William scrutinized the card before giving Evelyn another suspicious once-over.

"You're not Evelyn? Impossible. How can two people look so identical?" Eleanor muttered under her breath.

William remained skeptical. "Your name is Vivian?"

"Yes," Evelyn confirmed with a nod. "This is my first time visiting Willowbrook."

"That can't be!" Eleanor snapped, her eyes narrowing. "There's no way two people could resemble each other this closely!"

"The world is full of miracles," Evelyn countered smoothly. "After all, didn't you miraculously find your long-lost daughter after twenty years?"

Eleanor faltered, unable to refute that. She scoffed instead. "Evelyn, stop lying! You never died—you faked your death to ruin Alexander and Victoria's engagement! And now you're back to stir up trouble again. You haven't changed at all. How despicable—"

"Enough." Alexander's voice cut through sharply, cold as ice.

Eleanor froze, startled by his tone. His expression was glacial, as if carved from frost.

"I won't tolerate such words again." His gaze flicked to Evelyn, who stood there, unruffled. "They're clearly two different people. Mind your words—respect others, and respect yourself."

"Mother, Father, Alexander is right. Miss Vivian isn't Evelyn. Evelyn left us forever three years ago..." Victoria forced a tear, then added, "Mother, Father, this is Vivian Prescott. I've met her before. She's nothing like Evelyn—they're completely separate people."

Eleanor and William's expressions shifted as they offered Evelyn an awkward apology. "If Victoria and Alexander say so, then it must be true. Please forgive our rudeness, Miss Prescott."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "I'm quite used to it by now."

Eleanor and William hesitated before extending a stiff invitation. "Since Miss Vivian is acquainted with Alexander and Victoria, why not come inside and witness Alexander's proposal?"

"Of course." Evelyn's lips curved as she cast a meaningful glance at Victoria. "I brought a gift for Miss Lancaster. It was a last-minute choice, but I hope you'll like it."
###Chapter 176

Evelyn wanted to refuse, but to maintain her composed facade, she accepted Victoria's gift with a gracious smile. "How thoughtful of you."

She then tugged gently at Alexander's sleeve. "Alexander, shall we? Our guests are waiting."

"Of course, you two go ahead first," Eleanor Kingsley and William Montgomery encouraged, their faces glowing with anticipation. "Today's celebration would be perfect for announcing your wedding date."

Victoria gazed up at Alexander with doe-eyed innocence. "After all these years, I'll finally become your bride."

Observing Victoria's radiant expression, Evelyn offered them both a serene smile before turning away.

As they reentered the garden, dozens of curious eyes followed Evelyn's movements, whispers spreading like wildfire about the mysterious newcomer.

Noticing the attention shifting from her, Victoria's smile tightened. When Alexander showed no signs of proposing as planned, unease twisted in her stomach. The humiliation of a failed engagement announcement would be unbearable.

"Mother, Father," Victoria suddenly announced, pressing a hand to her temple. "I'm feeling rather faint. I need to retire to my chambers."

Eleanor and William rushed to her side. "Darling, what's wrong? Should we call the physician?"

"It's nothing serious," Victoria assured them with practiced grace. "Please continue entertaining our guests. Alexander, would you escort me?"

Alexander hesitated, his gaze lingering on Evelyn. "Miss Prescott, do make yourself comfortable. There's a matter I wish to discuss with you later."

Evelyn inclined her head in acknowledgment.

Watching the exchange, Victoria's smile vanished as she stormed inside, her heels clicking sharply against the marble.

Left alone, Evelyn moved through the lavish gardens unnoticed, not even her own parents sparing her a glance.

The Blackwood Estate sprawled before her in all its gilded splendor - manicured hedges framing bubbling fountains, rose gardens perfuming the evening air. Had fate not intervened decades ago, these very grounds would have been her childhood playground.

Evelyn's fingers brushed against a blooming peony as she contemplated the cruel twist of destiny that had separated her from this life. But tonight, she had a more pressing purpose.

When the last guest turned away, Evelyn slipped unnoticed into the mansion's shadowed corridors.

The sound of muffled sobs reached her first - raw, grieving wails that echoed through the empty hallway. Having stared death in the face herself, Evelyn felt no fear, only sharp curiosity about who would be weeping in such a hidden corner today.

Following the heartbreaking sounds, she discovered a middle-aged woman clutching a photograph to her chest, tears streaming down her weathered face.

"Sophia, my precious Sophia..." the woman whimpered between shuddering breaths.

Sophia?

Evelyn's pulse quickened at the name Sophia Montgomery.

"My angel, today should have been your birthday," the woman continued, her voice thick with anguish. "But that monster Evelyn took you from us! That murderess deserves to burn in hell for what she did to you!"

The pieces clicked into place. This woman believed Evelyn had killed Sophia Montgomery.

But what puzzled Evelyn most was the depth of this stranger's grief. What connection could she possibly have to the late Sophia Montgomery that would warrant such profound sorrow?
###Chapter 177

The woman's attire was unusual—not the uniform of a Montgomery servant, nor the elegant dress of a guest.

Who was she?

Evelyn didn’t have time to dwell on it. The woman wiped her tears and turned to leave, forcing Evelyn to hurry upstairs before she disappeared.

Before she could unravel the mystery, Victoria’s voice echoed from one of the rooms.

Evelyn approached quietly, lingering outside the door. She didn’t know how Victoria managed it, but her voice rang out with triumph.

"Alexander, I’m so happy! Marrying you is my greatest dream!"

So, it was true. Alexander was going to propose. And soon, they would be wed.

"I always keep my promises," Alexander replied, his voice firm and unwavering.

The words scraped against Evelyn’s heart like jagged glass.

Alexander, when did you ever keep a promise to me?

You shattered every hope I ever held for you. You took everything from me—my love, my trust, even my life. And now, here you are, living happily with her.

I won’t let you.

Her fists clenched. Footsteps approached, and she quickly slipped into the shadows.

"I’ll go down first. Fix your makeup before you join me," Alexander said as he stepped out.

Once he descended, Evelyn returned to her spot.

Inside the room, Victoria sat before the vanity, reapplying her lipstick with a victorious smirk.

Then, as if remembering something, she turned and unwrapped the gift Evelyn had given her.

Her face darkened instantly.

"A mirror?"

Victoria’s lips curled in disgust. She hurled it to the floor, the glass shattering with a sharp crack.

"Vivian Prescott! Where did that little witch crawl out from? Does she really think she can steal Alexander just because she’s pretty?"

Her nails dug into her palms.

"She looks exactly like Evelyn. He’ll only be repulsed by her!"

A cruel smile twisted her lips.

"But it doesn’t matter. I have my trump card. No one can take him from me now."

Evelyn’s expression remained icy.

Trump card?

Did she mean Ethan?

Oh, Victoria. Your trump card won’t save you. The moment you saw me again was the beginning of your downfall.

With a graceful pivot, Evelyn descended the stairs—only to nearly collide with Alexander.

His brows furrowed.

"What are you doing in the house?"

She blinked innocently.

"I was looking for the restroom. I must have gotten lost."

Her gaze flickered past him just as Victoria stepped out of her room.

Remembering how tightly Alexander had held her before, Evelyn didn’t hesitate.

She "tripped."

It was a gamble.

But she won.

Alexander moved instantly, catching her just as he had before.

Evelyn feigned surprise, locking eyes with him—only to see something unreadable flicker in his gaze.

Lost. Haunted.

She smirked inwardly.

Are you remembering your dead wife, Alexander?

"Alexander!"

Victoria’s shriek nearly ruptured Evelyn’s eardrums.

A second later, a vicious grip yanked her away.

"Vivian, you slut! Is this how you seduce my fiancé?"
###Chapter 178

Evelyn raised her voice. It was the first time she had ever been so hysterical in front of Alexander.

She clawed at Vivian, who was still in Alexander's arms, her voice sharp. "Vivian Prescott! I knew you weren't here with good intentions. A gift? You're just trying to seduce Alexander!"

Vivian was growing increasingly irritated by Evelyn's shrill tone. If it weren't for the fact that she had a plan, she might have slapped her right then.

Instead, she feigned dizziness, pressing a hand to her temple. "Miss Lancaster, you're mistaken."

"I'm not mistaken! I saw it with my own eyes! You scheming witch!" Evelyn shrieked, her palm flying toward Vivian's face.

Smack!

But the slap never landed. Alexander caught her wrist mid-air, his grip unyielding.

His icy gaze bore into Evelyn. "I was merely helping her up. Was that necessary?"

His voice was so cold it sent a shiver down Evelyn's spine.

"Alexander, you've never spoken to me like this before—" Her voice cracked, tears welling in her eyes.

Alexander released her, his expression unreadable. "I have. Don't overthink it. But your behavior was unacceptable. Apologize to Miss Prescott."

Evelyn's eyes widened in disbelief. "Apologize? To her?"

She clenched her fists, glaring at Vivian. "I won't!"

"It's fine," Vivian interjected softly, feigning humility. "No apology is needed. It was my fault for losing my balance." She turned to Evelyn, her voice gentle. "Miss Lancaster, I'm sorry for upsetting you."

"Stop acting, Vivian! Do you think I don't see what you're doing? Who do you think you are, apologizing to me?"

"That's enough!" Alexander cut in sharply, his voice like steel.

"Today is your birthday, and Miss Prescott is a guest. Is this how you treat your guests? Apologize. Now."

Evelyn's lips trembled, her eyes reddening. "I won't! She wanted this to happen!"

Wanted it?

A smirk flickered across Vivian's lips. Oh, she had wanted it.

'Remember, Evelyn? This is exactly what you taught me.'

'That day, you held those divorce papers and humiliated me in front of Alexander. You provoked me, then pretended I pushed you. You made him force me to apologize—did you forget?'

'Maybe you have. But I never will.'

The fire of vengeance burned bright in Vivian's chest as she watched Evelyn's furious expression with deep satisfaction.

"Fine. If you refuse to apologize, then I'm leaving." Alexander turned to Vivian, his tone softening. "Miss Prescott, would you accompany me?"

Vivian hesitated, feigning discomfort. "I—"

"Don't go, Alexander!" Evelyn grabbed his arm desperately. "Please, don't leave. You're right—today is my birthday, and I shouldn't treat a guest this way. But I only acted like this because I love you too much!"

She clung to him, her voice breaking. "Alexander, I'll do anything to make you happy. I'll apologize!"

With visible reluctance, she turned to Vivian.
###Chapter 179

Though her eyes burned with venom, Evelyn Sinclair effortlessly slipped on her practiced mask of serenity.

A delicate smile curved her lips. "My apologies, Miss Prescott. My devotion to my fiancé sometimes overcomes my better judgment. I hope you'll forgive my momentary lapse."

Vivian Prescott returned the smile with equal grace. "Your passion for Mr. Blackwood is evident. I completely understand - I become equally possessive when other women get too close to my boyfriend."

The subtle shift in both Alexander and Victoria's expressions didn't escape Vivian's notice.

"Miss Prescott, you're in a relationship?" Victoria's smile regained some of its forced brightness.

Vivian laughed musically. "Indeed." She let her gaze drift casually to meet Alexander's, holding it just a heartbeat too long.

Noticing Alexander's lingering attention, Victoria quickly changed the subject. "How wonderful! You must introduce us to your boyfriend sometime."

"He's currently abroad, but I'd be delighted to arrange a meeting when he returns." Vivian's smile sparkled like champagne.

Victoria dabbed at nonexistent tears before plastering on another saccharine smile. "Alexander darling, we shouldn't keep our guests waiting."

Without a word, Alexander withdrew his arm and strode toward the garden.

Victoria's smile faltered but she hurried after him. "Alexander, you wouldn't disappoint me now, would you? You promised me a proposal in front of everyone!"

Vivian caught the desperate edge in Victoria's voice as she followed at a discreet distance.

How curious, she mused. What could have happened in three years to cool Alexander's legendary devotion to Victoria?

Yet clearly some affection remained - no woman stayed by Alexander Blackwood's side this long without it. Still, Vivian sensed his growing interest in her, though his true motives remained opaque.

One thing was certain - her carefully crafted appearance had successfully captured Alexander's attention.

First move in her revenge gambit: check.

As she moved through the garden, an unsettling prickling sensation crept up her neck. Someone was watching her.

She turned sharply but saw nothing amiss.

Only after she'd passed did the hidden observer emerge, venomous gaze boring into Vivian's retreating figure.

'Evelyn Sinclair!'

'You're supposed to be dead!'

When the couple reappeared before their guests, the crowd immediately resumed their clamor for a proposal.

Victoria stood demurely beside Alexander, her smile radiating smug certainty. The sight made Vivian's stomach churn.

"Alexander, darling Victoria is waiting!" Eleanor Kingsley trilled.

"Looks like I'll be gaining a son-in-law tonight!" William Montgomery beamed.

Watching her biological parents champion their fraudulent daughter so enthusiastically, Vivian nearly laughed aloud.

Her attention snapped back as Victoria leaned into Alexander. "Alexander..." she purred, heavy with expectation.

Timing her move perfectly, Vivian withdrew her phone and pressed it to her ear. "Really? I've missed you too. I'll be right there - wait for me."

She felt the weight of Alexander's gaze as she spoke.

With a secret smile, Vivian turned toward the exit. She'd taken barely three steps when Victoria's shrill cry pierced the air:

"Alexander! Alexander! What's wrong? Where are you going—"
###Chapter 180

Evelyn's voice trembled as she reached out. "Alexander, please don't leave. Where are you going? Our engagement—"

"Not in the mood today," Alexander cut her off coldly, shaking free from Evelyn's grasp.

"Alexander!" she called after him desperately, but he was already striding away.

The Lancasters and their guests exchanged confused glances.

Alexander's displeasure was palpable. Something had clearly upset him.

Whispers spread through the crowd. The rumors about Alexander's devotion to Evelyn seemed exaggerated.

Why else would their wedding keep getting postponed? And now, he walked away from her with such indifference.

Evelyn gathered her gown and chased after him. Her blood ran cold when she saw Vivian walking ahead.

Alexander pulled his luxury car alongside Vivian, opening the passenger door with gentlemanly grace before driving off together.

Evelyn's fingers twisted in the fabric of her dress, her eyes burning with murderous rage.

"Vivian Prescott!" she spat through clenched teeth, her entire body shaking with fury.

Vivian hadn't expected Alexander to follow her. Yet not only had he abandoned Evelyn, he'd invited her into his car.

The car wound through the city before stopping at the beach near Pinecrest Heights.

Vivian stiffened. This was where she'd once seen Alexander embracing Evelyn.

The memory turned her stomach.

Alexander opened her door, forcing her to step out.

The summer breeze carried familiar scents that transported her back to younger days.

The click of a lighter startled her. She turned to see Alexander lighting a cigarette.

He leaned casually against the car, exhaling smoke that partially obscured his striking features.

His expression held a deep melancholy.

Since when did he smoke? She didn't remember this habit from before.

"Mr. Blackwood," Vivian kept her tone light, "why abandon your fiancée to bring me here? I have plans."

"With your lover, Miss Prescott?" Alexander's lips curved.

"You guessed correctly." She arched a brow.

"Men have intuition too." His smile deepened, voice dripping with flirtation. "Mine tells me you're interested in me."

Vivian wasn't shocked by the statement, but by his boldness.

She met his gaze evenly. "A man like you naturally draws attention. Pity our timing is wrong."

Alexander suddenly closed the distance between them. His breath, tinged with tobacco, warmed her skin.

His intense gaze traced her features, the usual sharpness softening into something dangerously tender.

"Do you think I'm your ex-wife Evelyn? Is that why you're so interested?" Vivian asked calmly.

"If I recall, you hated her passionately. They say you didn't shed a tear when she died. She must have been truly terrible—"

Alexander's expression shuttered. He turned toward the ocean, forcing a smile.

"She was," he murmured.

'Terrible for leaving without giving me a chance to say goodbye.'

'Terrible for haunting my sleepless nights.'

Vivian's hands clenched at his words, anger simmering beneath her calm facade.
###Chapter 181

A frosty smile curved her lips. "If that's true, then why would you associate with a woman who resembles her so strikingly?"

Her voice dripped with quiet venom. "Doesn't my face sicken you?"

Alexander turned, his gaze lingering on Evelyn with unsettling intensity. "Miss Prescott, your face is exquisite."

Yes, it was.

Just as breathtaking as hers had been.

No—perhaps even more so.

There was an ethereal purity to her features, an untouchable serenity that made his chest ache.

Alexander studied her as if trying to piece together a shattered memory.

Then his phone buzzed, shattering the moment. He glanced at the screen, irritation flashing across his face before he answered. "What is it?"

The wind howled too fiercely for Evelyn to hear the caller, but she caught Alexander's reluctant reply. "I'll be there shortly."

She expected him to drop her off along the way, but the car didn't stop until they reached a familiar gated driveway. The Blackwood Estate loomed before them.

Evelyn's pulse quickened.

He was testing her.

But she had prepared for this.

Margaret Blackwood rushed out at the sound of the car, only to freeze when she saw Evelyn stepping out. Her face drained of color. "A—a ghost!"

Evelyn laughed lightly. "Mr. Blackwood, I did warn you. Now I've frightened your mother."

Margaret clutched at Alexander's arm, her voice shrill. "Alexander! Explain this! That woman is dead! How is she standing here?"

Alexander's expression remained unreadable. "This is Vivian Prescott. She was raised in France. It's her first visit to Willowbrook."

"Pleasure to meet you," Evelyn said smoothly.

Margaret's eyes narrowed. "Is that so? Victoria called me earlier about a woman who looked just like Evelyn. I thought she was imagining things—"

She yanked Alexander aside. "What's going on? You abandoned Victoria at her own birthday gala! She's inconsolable! Don't tell me you left her for... this?"

Her venomous glare flicked to Evelyn—but faltered the instant their eyes met.

"My decisions are my own," Alexander said coldly, then gestured to Evelyn. "Come inside."

"Are you certain?" Evelyn feigned hesitation.

"Now."

She strode past Margaret without hesitation, delighting in how the older woman recoiled.

That fear was delicious.

But it was only the beginning.

The grand foyer echoed with an elderly man's booming voice. "Alexander, you reckless boy! Explain yourself!"

Henry Blackwood's cane struck the marble floor. "You scorned Evelyn while alive, chasing after that scheming mistress! I only tolerated this farce for Ethan's sake! And now—abandoning Victoria on her birthday? For what?"

Evelyn's heart clenched at the sound of her name in his voice.

Then Alexander pulled her forward. "Grandfather, look who I've brought."
###Chapter 182

Alexander leaned close to Evelyn's ear, murmuring words too soft for others to hear before guiding her toward Henry Blackwood.

The elderly patriarch's vision had deteriorated with age. At first, he only saw Alexander leading a slender woman with flowing hair toward him. But when Evelyn stepped into his line of sight, his cane clattered to the floor as he struggled to rise from the sofa.

"You... It can't be... Evelyn?" His wrinkled hand trembled as it reached out, fingers brushing air as if testing whether she was real.

Evelyn's heart clenched at the hope shining in his milky eyes. Beneath the sorrow, warmth blossomed in her chest.

Someone here still cared.

Her lips curved as she caught his shaking hand. "Grandfather."

Henry's breath hitched. "Is it truly you?"

Margaret Blackwood watched with narrowed eyes from the sidelines.

"Of course it's her," Alexander interjected smoothly.

Margaret's expression darkened. "What? That's impossible! Alexander, you said—"

A glacial stare from her son silenced her mid-sentence.

Henry paid no attention to his daughter-in-law, pulling Evelyn down beside him with surprising strength for his age.

His weathered face glowed with affection. Those aged eyes that had witnessed decades of life now shone with unconditional love.

"Evelyn, my dear girl. You're alive... thank heavens." His voice cracked with emotion.

Evelyn maintained her serene smile while turmoil churned beneath the surface.

In this entire world, only three people had ever truly loved her - this old man, Alexander, and Olivia.

Henry had been frail lately, often confined to a wheelchair. Yet seeing Evelyn seemed to infuse him with newfound energy.

She nodded occasionally, careful not to reveal too much. Alexander's suspicious gaze burned into her back.

When Henry suggested strolling through the rose garden, Evelyn readily agreed.

As they moved to leave, Margaret seized Alexander's arm. "Explain this charade! That woman died three years ago!"

Alexander's expression turned arctic. "I wish she had survived."

Margaret's grip tightened. "So this is an imposter? Then why—"

"Grandfather's health has been declining. Don't you want to see him happy?" The perfect excuse.

Only Alexander knew his true motives.

Henry chatted animatedly with Evelyn for hours, pointedly avoiding questions about her disappearance.

When Alexander finally signaled their departure, Henry clasped Evelyn's hands. "Even though you and Alexander divorced, these doors will always be open to you. I'll always be your grandfather."

Gratitude swelled in Evelyn's chest.

She deliberately avoided looking at Alexander as she smiled softly. "Thank you, Grandfather. I should go now."

The unspoken tension between them crackled like static in the air.
###Chapter 183

Old Master Blackwood nodded, his sharp gaze lingering on Evelyn as if he'd uncovered a hidden truth.

Inside the car, Alexander broke the silence first. "Miss Prescott, I appreciate you indulging my unreasonable request."

"If it's unreasonable, let's not make it a habit," Evelyn replied coolly. "Mr. Blackwood, you've already wasted enough of my time. Please take me back immediately. Shouldn't you be comforting your fiancée instead?"

Alexander studied Evelyn's frosty expression, noting her impatience. "My apologies for keeping you from your boyfriend. I'll treat you both to dinner sometime."

"Unnecessary. My boyfriend tends to get possessive." Evelyn shut him down firmly.

Alexander remained silent for the rest of the drive, dropping Evelyn at her destination without further conversation.

Standing by the bustling sidewalk, Evelyn stared at her palms.

The ghost of warmth still lingered in her hands.

Grandfather.

He still remembered her after all these years.

A bittersweet smile touched her lips, as if old wounds were finally beginning to heal.

That evening while browsing online, Evelyn stumbled upon trending news about Victoria's disastrous birthday celebration.

The headlines screamed about how Alexander had not only failed to propose but had abandoned Victoria for a mysterious woman.

The internet buzzed with speculation about the mystery woman's identity, with some commentators suggesting Alexander had never truly cared for Victoria - that she'd been clinging to him desperately all along.

Victoria had leveraged the Blackwood and Montgomery connections to build a massive beauty influencer empire over three years, amassing millions of devoted followers. When the scandal broke, her brainwashed fans swarmed to her defense.

They insisted Victoria and Alexander were soulmates, claiming their engagement had been set in stone three years prior.

Worse, they dragged Evelyn's name through the mud, blaming her past "vile actions" for supposedly preventing their idol's happiness.

The narrative twisted until all discussion threads became vicious attacks on Evelyn, while Victoria was painted as the long-suffering victim.

Her fans flooded Alexander's social media with sympathetic messages.

The speculation soon connected the mystery woman to Evelyn.

Evelyn could practically see Victoria's smug smile while reading those comments. With a smirk, she left a message on Victoria's profile: 'Enjoying my gift, Miss Lancaster?'

Within minutes, Evelyn's inbox exploded with vulgar messages from countless fake accounts - all bearing Victoria's distinctive phrasing.

Sipping her freshly brewed coffee, Evelyn relished imagining Victoria's current rage. She knew this wouldn't be the end of it.

That weekend, Evelyn took Amelia to the boutique. The little girl twirled happily by the entrance in her princess dress.

Amelia was playing with a delicate glass bead when it slipped from her fingers and rolled away. She chased after it, only for the bead to be crushed under a designer heel.

"Well, look who we have here. That little pest who clung to Alexander at Golden Arches!"

Amelia blinked up with wide, innocent eyes at Victoria and her smirking friend. "Are you calling me a pest, ma'am?"

"Who are you calling ma'am?!" Victoria's eyes flashed with rage. Taking in the child's striking resemblance to Evelyn, her fury boiled over. Her hand shot up, aiming for Amelia's face. "Shut your mouth!"
###Chapter 184

Amelia might only be two and a half, but she moved with surprising agility.

When Victoria lunged at her with malicious intent, the toddler dodged effortlessly.

Victoria's hand swiped through empty air, fueling her frustration. She reached again, fingers poised to pinch Amelia's cheeks.

The little girl reacted instantly. She opened her rosebud mouth and sank her tiny teeth into Victoria's hand.

"Ah!" Victoria shrieked in pain.

Amelia released her bite and blinked enormous sapphire eyes. "Bad ladies who hit children get punished. Mommy said so."

"What did you just say?" Victoria couldn't believe she was being schooled by a toddler.

Blind with rage, she chased after Amelia as the child turned toward the boutique. In her fury, Victoria forgot about the marble beneath her designer heels. The smooth stone rolled, sending her crashing to the ground and dragging her friend down with her.

"Damn brat!"

Amelia paused, turning to stick out her tongue. "Naughty aunty! Serves you right!"

The little girl spun on her heel with a triumphant flip of golden curls.

"You little monster!"

As Victoria's stiletto flew toward Amelia's head, a tall figure materialized from nowhere. Alexander caught the child effortlessly, stepping aside just as the shoe shattered the boutique's window.

The force behind the throw could have been fatal.

Victoria's rage turned to shock when she recognized Alexander. She scrambled up, gesturing frantically for her friend to retrieve the shoe.

"Alexander! What a... surprise." Her voice dripped false sweetness.

Alexander examined Amelia in his arms, then fixed Victoria with a glacial stare. "Explain yourself."

"It's not what it looks like! This brat—"

"Ms. Lancaster? Mr. Blackwood?" Evelyn emerged from the store, taking in the broken glass and her daughter in Alexander's embrace. "Would someone care to explain?"

A sales associate quickly whispered the events to Evelyn.

Evelyn's gaze turned arctic as she faced Victoria. "If you have issues with me, address them directly. Leave my daughter out of your petty vendettas."

"Your daughter?" Victoria gaped at the child in Alexander's arms.

This cherub-faced hellion was Evelyn's child?

Alexander studied the girl more closely. Rosy cheeks framed by golden ringlets. Eyes like twin sapphires beneath delicate brows. A button nose and Cupid's bow lips. She was the picture of innocence with an ethereal beauty.

Now he understood why she'd seemed familiar at Golden Arches. She was Evelyn's miniature replica.

Their resemblance was uncanny—especially those expressive eyes.
###Chapter 185

"Thank you, Big Brother. You saved Amelia again." Amelia blinked up at Alexander with her innocent doe eyes. "Mommy's here now, so you can put me down."

Alexander studied the little girl in his arms, an uncharacteristic softness crossing his usually stern features. "Your name is Amelia?"

"Yes..." She nodded obediently before scrunching her nose in thought. "But only Mommy calls me that. Daddy uses my full name."

Daddy.

The word struck Alexander like a physical blow.

Harsh. Foreign.

He thought of Ethan. In three years, his son had rarely called him "Dad."

His heartbeat grew erratic for reasons he couldn't explain.

Gently setting Amelia down, he watched her dash to Evelyn's side. "Mommy! That mean lady tried to hit me but she fell down instead. This nice man saved me!"

Amelia recounted the incident with dramatic seriousness, making Evelyn smile despite the tension.

"Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn said coolly, "while I appreciate your help, I'd prefer if you kept your distance going forward. We wouldn't want your precious fiancée getting the wrong idea. I can handle myself, but if my daughter gets hurt..." Her grip tightened around Amelia. "There will be consequences."

Turning her sharp gaze to Victoria, Evelyn added, "I'll have the broken window appraised and send the bill directly to Blackwood Enterprises' accounting department. Don't forget to pay, Miss Lancaster."

"What?" Victoria's eyes widened, but Evelyn had already turned away.

"Vivian Prescott, you—"

"Haven't you caused enough trouble already?" Alexander's icy voice cut through the air.

Victoria turned to him, confusion and panic flashing across her face. When he strode away without a backward glance, she scrambled after him barefoot.

"Alexander! Wait! You're misunderstanding everything!"

She called after him desperately, but he didn't slow his pace.

Spotting a shard of glass in her path, Victoria steadied herself—then deliberately stepped on it.

"Ahhh!" She collapsed dramatically. "Alexander, it hurts so much!"

He stopped. Turned. Saw her sprawled on the pavement, blood welling from her right foot.

The sight transported him instantly to that rainy night years ago—carrying a wounded girl on his back through the storm. Her whispered promise in his ear: "Lex, I want to stay with you forever."

He'd vowed then to always protect her.

But now...

Now he wasn't sure when that promise had become a chain around his neck.

Perhaps the moment he realized his heart belonged to Evelyn...

"Alexander! There's so much blood!" Victoria's theatrical wailing snapped him back to the present.

With visible reluctance, he approached—still haunted by memories.

Evelyn paused at the doorway, watching the scene unfold: Victoria bleeding on the pavement, clutching Alexander's hand dramatically.

"Alexander, what did I do wrong? Why are you so cold to me now? Have you forgotten your promise? You swore you'd always take care of me!"

Evelyn's stomach turned. She was about to leave when Victoria's next words froze her in place:

"Don't you see? I hurt my foot just like that night years ago. Remember how scared I was? How you carried me for miles? You promised to protect me forever—have you really forgotten?"
###Chapter 186

Evelyn Sinclair froze mid-step. Her gaze locked onto Victoria Lancaster as a creeping suspicion took root in her heart.

Why did Victoria and Alexander Blackwood’s past mirror her own history with Alexander so closely?

And was Pinecrest Heights also the place where they had first met?

"Alexander, I don’t need anything else—just you. Please, don’t leave me."

Victoria’s whisper pulled Evelyn back to the present.

Tears shimmered in Victoria’s eyes as she stared at Alexander with desperate hope.

Though he remained silent, he carefully bandaged her wound with a handkerchief. His tenderness toward her hadn’t faded.

"Alexander—"

"Enough. I’m taking you to the hospital."

Victoria gazed at him adoringly. "With you beside me, the pain doesn’t matter. I know you’ll always protect me."

Evelyn heard every word.

As Alexander helped Victoria into the car, Victoria turned her head just enough to flash Evelyn a triumphant smirk—a silent taunt. "Vivian Prescott, you’ll never steal my man."

Evelyn watched indifferently, a faint smile playing on her lips.

Alexander, for a man so brilliant in business, so sharp in intellect, how can you still be blind to Victoria’s true nature after all these years?

Or maybe… you just prefer scheming vipers.

Evelyn returned to her studio. The moment she picked up her paintbrush, her phone rang.

She glanced at the screen—Alexander Blackwood.

She ignored it.

He called again.

Evelyn stared at his name, her expression cold. It reminded her of herself years ago—desperate, pleading, unanswered.

How many times had she called him, only to be rejected or blocked?

She had loved him so foolishly, so hopelessly.

Now, looking back, she pitied that naive version of herself.

How could she have ever fallen for such a cold, ruthless man?

When the third call came, Evelyn silenced her phone and tossed it aside.

Her heart would never race for him again.

The day passed in a blur of work. As evening fell, Evelyn prepared to take Amelia home—only to find a familiar car parked outside.

Alexander stepped out, the golden sunset casting an ethereal glow over his sculpted frame. Every movement exuded power, his presence magnetic as ever.

Evelyn arched a brow, but he spoke first.

"Have dinner with me. Consider it repayment for saving your daughter today."

He crouched to Amelia’s eye level, an uncharacteristic smile softening his features. "Sweetheart, would you like to have dinner with me?"

Amelia hesitated, then clutched Evelyn’s leg, her bright eyes questioning.

"Mommy, are we eating with him?"

Evelyn scooped her up with a gentle smile. "No, darling. We’re going home."

She wouldn’t give Alexander a chance to get close to Amelia.

If he still suspected her true identity, Amelia would be his easiest target.

And Evelyn would never let him uncover that secret.
###Chapter 187

Never.

As Evelyn turned to leave, Alexander's lips curled into a smirk.

"Miss Prescott, are you trying to distance yourself from me?"

Evelyn glanced over her shoulder with a light laugh. "Mr. Blackwood, we've always been strangers passing in the night. There's no distance to create."

She quickly ushered Amelia into the car and returned to their apartment.

Fresh from her shower, Evelyn was tucking Amelia in when her phone rang again.

Victoria's name flashed on the screen.

Stepping onto the balcony, Evelyn answered. The shrill accusation came through immediately. "Vivian Prescott! Where's Alexander? Are you with him?"

A quiet chuckle escaped Evelyn's lips. "Miss Lancaster, why are you asking me about your missing fiancé? How amusing."

"Don't play innocent!" Victoria spat. "That plastic surgery wasn't just for fun, was it? You wanted to catch Alexander's attention by looking like his dead wife!"

Her voice turned venomous. "Listen carefully - no matter what tricks you use, you'll never measure up to me. I'm a socialite with millions of followers online. What are you? Just some nouveau riche with questionable money sources. Know your place, or you'll regret it!"

Click.

The line went dead before Evelyn could respond. Victoria clearly considered this conversation her victory.

But Evelyn recognized the desperation beneath those words. The frantic call only revealed Victoria's growing insecurity.

Smirking at the mental image of Victoria's furious face, Evelyn turned back inside.

Her phone rang again immediately.

Alexander's name appeared this time.

How ironic.

Remembering Victoria's call, Evelyn answered without hesitation.

An unfamiliar male voice came through, background noise pulsing with music and chatter.

"Miss Prescott? Your friend Mr. Blackwood is here. He's had too much to drink. Could you come get him?" The man rattled off an address that triggered old memories.

After ensuring Amelia slept soundly and arranging for Olivia to watch over her, Evelyn stepped into the summer night.

The warm breeze carried ghosts of the past as she approached the upscale nightclub - Midnight Lounge. The blinding neon lights still made her skin crawl.

This was where Victoria's lies had trapped her years ago. The false story about her grandfather's illness had driven her here to sell drinks, only to leave humiliated and half a million dollars in debt.

On their divorce day, Alexander probably thought she'd demanded that money for freedom. He never knew she'd intended to repay Nathaniel before ending her life. She couldn't bear owing anyone, especially those who'd shown her kindness.

Evelyn shook off the memories as she reached the VIP section.

The very room where she'd been publicly shamed by Alexander and Victoria.

Her pink lips pressed together as vengeful sparks lit her eyes. Just as her hand touched the door, someone grabbed her arm.

"You...you're...E-Evelyn?!"
###Chapter 188

The voice sent chills down her spine. Every nerve in her body screamed in recognition—and revulsion.

Evelyn lifted her gaze slowly. The corridor lights blazed mercilessly, illuminating Dominic Fletcher's grotesque, panic-stricken face as he stumbled into view.

Drunk and disoriented moments ago, Dominic had only found her profile vaguely familiar. Now, confronted with Evelyn's full visage, he recoiled violently. His legs gave way, sending him crashing to the floor in an undignified heap.

Leaning against the doorframe, Evelyn observed his terror with icy amusement. A radiant smile curved her lips as Dominic scrambled backward like a cornered animal.

"Sir?" Her voice dripped with false concern. "You seem unwell. Shall I help you up?"

Dominic's pupils dilated in horror. "E-Evelyn! Stay back!"

'Stay back?'

A humorless laugh bubbled in her throat.

Evelyn advanced, her stilettos clicking ominously. "Why so frightened? I'm flesh and blood—not some vengeful spirit. Unless..." She tilted her head. "...you have reason to fear ghosts?"

"Demon! You're a demon!" Spittle flew from Dominic's lips as he crab-walked backward. "I lied, okay? But I didn't kill you! Go haunt Victoria! This isn't my fault!"

With a final incoherent shout, he fled as though the hounds of hell pursued him.

Evelyn watched his retreating form, lips twisting in grim satisfaction.

She'd lived honorably. Loved fiercely. Yet they'd carved her into a broken, bleeding thing.

Meanwhile, these monsters still reveled in champagne and sin.

Dominic's terror was merely the opening act. The real performance? That required Alexander Blackwood.

The suite door groaned as Evelyn pushed it open.

Unlike the corridor's harsh brilliance or the club's psychedelic chaos, here golden lamplight pooled like liquid honey. It gilded the man sprawled across the leather sofa—his shirt unbuttoned just enough to reveal the tantalizing hollow of his collarbone.

Alexander's eyes were closed, long lashes casting shadows over his sharp cheekbones. The crystal lamp's glow softened his usually imperious features, yet couldn't erase the weariness etched between his brows.

Evelyn's breath hitched. She'd never seen him look so... human.

But why would a billionaire playboy—with his perfect mistress and heir—carry such exhaustion?

"Mr. Blackwood."

Silence.

The scent of Bordeaux clung to him, mingling with his cedarwood cologne. Evelyn counted three empty bottles on the coffee table.

"Alexander."

His name slipped out—a relic from when it lived in her heart like a sacred incantation. Once, she'd believed she'd cherish it until death.

How naive.

The man before her exhaled evenly, oblivious to the storm of contempt in Evelyn's gaze. Her lips curved.

'I loved you then. Now? You're just another stepping stone.'

A phone shattered the quiet.

Evelyn's eyes dropped to the vibrating device. Every instinct screamed it was Victoria.

Her fingers hovered over the screen—

—only to be captured in a vise-like grip.

Evelyn jerked her head up. Alexander's eyes burned through the alcoholic haze, locking onto hers with unsettling intensity. Her pulse stuttered, but her smile never wavered.

"Awake at last, Mr. Blackwood? I was about to take your call. Though now..." She flexed her trapped wrist meaningfully. "...you seem quite capable of answering yourself."
###Chapter 189

Evelyn attempted to withdraw her hand, but Alexander's grip remained unyielding.

"Release me, Mr. Blackwood." Her voice carried an edge of steel.

His response came as a whisper against her skin. "Never again."

The declaration struck her like lightning.

Evelyn's breath caught as she turned to face him, her confusion evident in widened eyes. Without warning, Alexander pulled her against his chest.

The sudden motion sent her stumbling in her heels. For one fleeting moment, she remembered the warmth she'd once craved from this man.

Their history couldn't be erased, no matter how much she wished otherwise.

She braced her palms against his chest to push away, but Alexander's arm snaked around her waist like an iron band.

"Mr. Blackwood!" Her protest died in her throat as his other hand cupped her cheek.

His whiskey-dark eyes held hers captive. The scent of bourbon and his expensive cologne surrounded her as their breaths mingled.

Evelyn's pulse thundered in her ears. This proximity - this intimacy - she hadn't anticipated it. Not after everything.

Alexander's thumb traced her cheekbone with unbearable tenderness. The raw emotion in his gaze made her stomach clench.

"You're intoxicated." She shoved against his shoulders, her voice sharp with warning.

As she turned to leave, his arms encircled her from behind, trapping her against his solid frame. The heat of his body seeped through her dress.

"Evelyn." His voice roughened with emotion.

She froze, her heart pounding a frantic rhythm.

"I've missed you." The words ghosted across her ear, sending shivers down her spine.

A bitter laugh rose in her throat. 'You're testing me, Alexander. Seeing if I'll slip up and reveal myself.'

'Miss me? That's rich.'

'The only woman you ever longed for was your precious Victoria.'

'Did you ever spare a thought for my pain? When they carved up my face? When they stole my sight?'

'No. You wanted me gone. You wanted me dead.'

The door exploded inward with a crash.

Victoria stood framed in the doorway, her face contorted with rage. In one fluid motion, she snatched a wine bottle from the nearby table.

"Vivian Prescott!" she shrieked. "You scheming whore! I'll end you!"
###Chapter 190

Evelyn charged forward like a woman possessed, her carefully cultivated grace and elegance forgotten in Alexander's presence.

She raised the glass bottle high, aiming directly for Vivian's flawless face.

Alexander moved with lightning reflexes, intercepting Meredith's attack.

He shielded Vivian behind his broad frame. Though he'd appeared intoxicated moments before, his piercing gaze now burned with sober clarity as it locked onto Victoria.

"What the hell do't think you're doing?"

Seeing Alexander protect Vivian made Victoria's blood boil. But she knew tears and vulnerability were her only weapons now.

"I wasn't really going to hit her, Alex," she whimpered, lowering the bottle with trembling hands. "I just can't stand seeing this impostor clinging to you."

Her voice cracked dramatically. "Can't you see? She's had surgery to look like Evelyn! She's manipulating you, Alex. Don't fall for her tricks."

Alexander's gaze flickered to Vivian's unblemished complexion at the mention of plastic surgery.

Vivian merely arched a perfect brow. "How fascinating that Miss Lancaster - soon-to-be Mrs. Blackwood - would make such baseless accusations. My face is my birthright. Who are you to accuse me of going under the knife?" Her lips curled. "And even if I had, why would I choose to resemble a ghost?"

The word 'ghost' struck Alexander like a physical blow.

Any lingering haze of alcohol vanished instantly. The agony of losing Evelyn - the only woman who'd ever truly loved him - crashed over him anew.

Vivian stepped around Alexander to face Victoria directly. "Rather than throwing tantrums, Miss Lancaster, perhaps you should ponder why your fiancé called me when he was drunk instead of you, his beloved bride-to-be."

"You—"

"Please don't contact me again, Mr. Blackwood." Vivian's voice turned icy. "We wouldn't want to upset your precious soulmate, now would we?"

With that, she turned on her heel and strode away.

Victoria ground her teeth as she watched Vivian's retreating figure, then turned back to Alexander with practiced tears glistening in her eyes.

"Let's go home, darling. She's not worth fighting over."

She reached for him, but Alexander sidestepped her touch.

His dark eyes narrowed. "How did you know I'd be here?"

Something flickered in Victoria's gaze. She'd never admit to having him followed. "I didn't, Alex. I was just so worried when I couldn't find you. I came here hoping...and then I saw you with that Prescott woman—"

Tears spilled down her cheeks on cue.

"I can't lose you to another woman again, Alex—"

But as Alexander stared at Victoria's tear-streaked face, all he saw was Vivian's haunting resemblance to Evelyn.

He realized with sudden clarity that from the moment Evelyn had claimed his heart, every other woman - including Victoria - had become an intruder.

The ride back to Blackwood Estate passed in tense silence.

Victoria despised the mansion. Yes, it was opulent beyond measure, but every corner whispered memories of Evelyn. Even death hadn't erased Victoria's burning hatred.

How she longed for Alexander to build them a new home - a fresh start. Yet three years later, she hadn't even received so much as a bracelet, let alone a new estate.

Alexander headed straight for his bedroom upon their return.

Victoria tried to follow, but he blocked the doorway. "I need to rest. Go home."

"Let me stay, Alex," she pleaded, trailing a finger down his chest. "It's been years. You know how I feel. You used to say I was perfect."

Her suggestive tone deliberately evoked cherished memories. Hoping the alcohol would lower his defenses, she pressed closer.

Alexander hesitated, and Victoria seized the opportunity to grasp his hand.

"Don't you want us to be happy again? Like we used to be?"

"Daddy."

Just as victory seemed within reach, the one voice Victoria loathed shattered the moment.

Rage simmered beneath her carefully composed mask. Forcing a gentle smile, she turned to Ethan.

"Shouldn't you be asleep, sweetheart? It's very late."
###Chapter 191

Alexander's gaze darted away the moment Evelyn smiled at him.

"I need Dad to sign this," Ethan murmured, clutching his workbook tightly.

Evelyn's warm smile faltered as she noticed the hesitation in his small hands. "How about I sign it for you?"

Ethan's fingers tightened on the edge of the workbook, his hopeful eyes flickering toward Alexander's closed door.

"Let your mother handle it," Alexander's voice came through the door, cold and dismissive. "Don't stay up too late."

The click of the lock echoed in the hallway.

Ethan stood frozen, the light in his eyes dimming into something hollow and afraid.

Without another word, he turned and hurried to his room.

Evelyn's smile vanished the second the door shut.

Fury twisted her features as she stormed after him, slamming his door open before he could close it.

The word Mom trembled on Ethan's lips, but he swallowed it back.

"What's wrong, Ethan?" Evelyn cooed, her voice dripping with false sweetness. "I'm your mother. Why do you look so terrified every time you see me?"

She took a step closer, her expression shifting in an instant—like a mask slipping to reveal the monster beneath.

"You always ruin everything!" she hissed, her voice venomous. "If you weren't useful, do you think I'd keep you around? Every time I look at you, I hate you more!"

Ethan darted past her, locking himself in the bathroom.

Evelyn pounded on the door, her words sharp as knives.

She despised him. Just as she had despised Evelyn Sinclair.

Even if he was the reason she had everything she wanted.

People said Ethan had Alexander's eyes, his sharp features. But Evelyn saw her in him.

He was their son, after all.

Of course he would resemble his real mother.

No one knew what she did to him behind closed doors. At five years old, he should have been bright and carefree.

Instead, he crouched in the corner, hands clamped over his ears, tears slipping silently down his cheeks.

Why isn't my mom like other moms?

Why doesn't she love me?

His small frame trembled as Evelyn's voice continued to slash through the door.

Back in her apartment, Evelyn stepped out of the shower, the cold water doing nothing to numb her thoughts.

She wouldn't let Alexander manipulate her again. Not with a single word. Not with a single glance.

Walking to the bed, she gazed down at Amelia, sleeping peacefully.

She should have had a sister.

If not for Alexander and Victoria.

Evelyn's fists clenched. She would make them pay. For everything.

The next evening, rain poured relentlessly as Evelyn arrived at the kindergarten, half an hour late.

Most of the children had already been picked up. Only Amelia and one other boy remained under the shelter of the guardhouse.

As she got closer, recognition struck her.

Ethan Blackwood.

"Mommy!" Amelia squealed, launching herself at Evelyn.

Evelyn scooped her up, pressing a kiss to her cheek.

From the corner of her eye, she noticed Ethan watching them, his expression unreadable.

Then, hesitantly, he stepped forward.

Evelyn frowned. "What is it?"
###Chapter 192

"Is that really you, Evelyn?"

Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto Vivian as he finally voiced the question weighing on his mind.

Vivian blinked in surprise before offering a warm smile. "Hello there. I'm Amelia's mother. My name is Vivian Prescott - lovely to meet you."

She extended her hand politely, acutely aware of Alexander's intense scrutiny.

The boy before her possessed striking features - high cheekbones and intelligent eyes that clearly mirrored his father's aristocratic genes.

Yet something unsettling lurked in Ethan's dark irises, a depth far beyond his tender years.

Perhaps it was just a trick of the light.

What burdens could a child so young possibly carry?

Memories of Victoria deliberately cutting Ethan's cheek to frame her surfaced unbidden. Vivian could still hear his pained cries, see the crimson staining his porcelain skin.

Her chest tightened at the recollection.

Thank heavens no scar remained.

"Mommy! Mommy! This is Ethan I told you about! We're best friends!" Amelia's melodic voice snapped Vivian back to the present.

The little girl's enthusiasm was infectious, her joy radiating like sunshine.

Vivian nodded politely. "Ah, so you're Ethan?" She maintained her composure despite her reservations about their growing friendship.

It wasn't the boy she disliked - just the complicated web connecting them all.

"Time to head home, sweetheart. Say goodbye to Ethan now."

"Okay!" Amelia waved enthusiastically with her dimpled hands. "Bye-bye Ethan! See you tomorrow!"

Vivian offered the boy a gentle smile. "Take care now."

Turning, she adjusted the umbrella over them as they stepped into the summer downpour.

Yet after only a few paces, Vivian found herself inexplicably rooted to the spot.

The rain intensified, the sudden chill cutting through the humid air.

Glancing back, she saw Ethan still standing by the school gates. His thin jacket offered little protection, the oversized backpack dwarfing his small frame.

Those soulful eyes bored into hers with unsettling intensity.

Though mere meters separated them, an ocean of unspoken words stretched between woman and child.

Her heart constricted remembering the unborn life Victoria and Alexander had stolen.

Before she realized it, Vivian was retracing her steps. "Are your parents coming to get you, sweetie?"

"Daddy's working," Ethan replied quietly.

Vivian softened her voice. "And your mother?"

At the mention of Victoria, Ethan's expression shuttered like drawn blinds.

Just then, his teacher approached, explaining they'd been unable to reach Ethan's family for nearly thirty minutes.

Vivian hesitated before dialing Alexander's number. The call went straight to voicemail.

After a moment's consideration, she made her decision. "Would you like to come home with us first? We can wait there until your father calls back."

"Yay! Ethan's visiting our house! I'm so excited, Mommy!" Amelia wrapped her arms around Vivian's legs, her infectious giggles making resistance impossible.

With the teacher's approval - reassured by Vivian's apparent familiarity with Ethan's family - they departed.

Half an hour later, Vivian ushered the children into her cozy apartment.

Amelia immediately dragged Ethan inside, eagerly sharing her favorite toys and snacks.

Vivian retreated to the kitchen to prepare homemade cookies, keeping watch through the open doorway.

Amelia had miraculously produced her workbook without prompting - a minor miracle for the homework-averse child.

Ethan sat quietly beside her, his solemn demeanor contrasting sharply with Amelia's bubbly energy.
###Chapter 193

"Hey, Ethan? Why does one plus one make two?"

"Why do three strawberries plus two oranges equal five?"

"Ethan, Ethan. Do you like broccoli?"

Like a walking encyclopedia of childhood curiosity, Amelia bombarded Ethan with endless questions, her bright eyes sparkling with innocent wonder.

Though only five years old, Ethan carried himself with unusual maturity. He answered each question with patient seriousness, repeating explanations whenever Amelia showed the slightest confusion.

Evelyn had initially worried about how the children would interact. But watching them now, her fears melted away. Ethan treated Amelia with the gentle protectiveness of an older brother, his quiet demeanor belying a deep affection.

Yet Evelyn's smile faltered. Had her first child survived, Amelia might have known this sibling bond. The thought brought a familiar ache.

"Want to play hide-and-seek, Ethan?" Amelia extended her small hand.

After a brief hesitation, Ethan accepted. "Okay. I'll play with you."

His voice struck Evelyn as oddly formal for a child. More concerning was his complete lack of smiles since their arrival. This wasn't normal childhood behavior.

Puzzled, Evelyn arranged freshly baked cookies and juice on the coffee table. Before she could call the children, her phone buzzed.

Seeing the caller ID, she answered with deliberate coolness. "To what do I owe this call, Mr. Blackwood? I thought we agreed not to contact each other."

Alexander's rich baritone carried playful amusement. "Miss Prescott, you called first. Though I must say, your voice is a pleasant surprise."

Evelyn chuckled dryly. "Did you even check your messages before calling back? Your son's preschool teacher has been trying to reach you. I understand business keeps you busy, but children need their father's attention too."

Silence stretched across the line.

Finally, Alexander responded, "Ethan's with you? Send me your address. I'm coming over."

Evelyn provided the details without hesitation. A man of Alexander's resources could find her easily if he wanted.

As she hung up, Amelia's alarmed voice echoed from the hallway. "Ethan? What's wrong? Ethan!"

Evelyn rushed toward the sound, finding Ethan curled in a storage closet corner, knees drawn to his chest, trembling violently. His arms wrapped tightly around himself as he squeezed his eyes shut.

Amelia blinked up at Evelyn. "We were playing hide-and-seek, Mommy. Then Ethan hid here and stopped talking."

"It's alright, sweetheart." Evelyn comforted Amelia before crouching beside Ethan. "What's wrong, Ethan?" she asked gently, reaching out.

At her touch, Ethan flinched and curled tighter. The reaction twisted Evelyn's heart. "Don't be afraid. Aunt Vivian won't hurt you."

She tried again, resting a hand on his shoulder. This time, Ethan lifted his tear-streaked face. His pallor and lost expression sent a pang through Evelyn's chest - sharp as the pain she'd felt during labor, as visceral as childloss.

Her hand moved instinctively to stroke his hair. "What happened, Ethan? You can tell me. It's okay now. I'm here. No one will hurt you."

Ethan's eyes welled with fresh tears. With a shuddering breath, he suddenly threw himself into Evelyn's arms. His small body trembled as he whispered a word that shattered her composure: "Mom..."
###Chapter 194

The last thing Evelyn Sinclair anticipated was Ethan Blackwood crashing into her embrace, calling her "Mom."

The little boy must have been utterly terrified and vulnerable.

He buried his small frame deep against her, clinging desperately as if she were his only lifeline. His tiny hands gripped her sweater with white-knuckled intensity, eyes squeezed shut against some unseen horror.

Evelyn's heart constricted painfully at the sheer distress radiating from the child. It had been years since she'd felt such a visceral pang of maternal protectiveness surge through her.

Gently, she stroked Ethan's soft hair, murmuring soothing words. "Shh, it's okay now, sweetheart. You're safe."

As her comforting voice wrapped around him, Evelyn watched the tension gradually leave Ethan's small body.

"Is Ethan okay, Mommy?" Amelia approached, her innocent blue eyes wide with concern.

"He'll be fine, darling." Evelyn forced a smile. "Why don't you share those cookies I baked with him?"

"Okay!" Amelia extended a chubby hand toward Ethan. "Come on! Mommy's cookies are the best in the whole world!"

At this invitation, Ethan seemed to snap back to reality.

His long lashes fluttered open, revealing bewildered hazel eyes that slowly focused on Evelyn's face. A flush of embarrassment crept across his porcelain cheeks.

"I'm sorry," he mumbled, the words striking a familiar chord in Evelyn's memory.

She cupped his face tenderly. "Whatever for, sweet boy? You've done nothing wrong."

A fleeting shadow of longing crossed Ethan's expression as he absorbed Evelyn's gentle smile. The way he looked at her spoke volumes about what he lacked at home.

Evelyn exhaled in quiet relief when Ethan's breathing steadied.

Warmth filled her chest as she watched the two children sitting side by side, nibbling on chocolate chip cookies. Her heart swelled particularly when Ethan carefully wiped a crumb from Amelia's cheek.

The tender gesture reopened old wounds, reminding her sharply of the child she'd lost.

When Amelia scampered off to the bathroom, Evelyn seized the moment. "Ethan, darling," she began carefully, "how does your mother usually treat you?"

The boy froze mid-bite, the light in his eyes dimming like a snuffed candle.

His silence was answer enough.

Three years ago, she'd witnessed Victoria Lancaster coldly pressing a knife to Ethan's cheek without flinching at his terrified sobs. That image still haunted Evelyn's nightmares.

What kind of monster used her own child as leverage for wealth and status?

What horrors had this innocent boy endured to make him seek comfort in a stranger's arms? Had Alexander truly been so blind to his son's suffering?

Seeing Ethan's discomfort, Evelyn changed tactics, ruffling his silky hair. "You think I look like someone named Maddie, don't you?"

Ethan's gaze snapped up, intense and searching, before nodding slowly. "At first I thought you were her."

Evelyn's smile turned bittersweet. "What if I told you I am Maddie? I imagine your mother told you terrible things about her. That Maddie hurt you."

Ethan's expression darkened with unexpected ferocity. He shook his head vehemently.

"Maddie would never hurt me," he declared with absolute conviction, his small jaw set stubbornly. "Never."

The vehemence in his voice sent an unexpected wave of emotion crashing through Evelyn's carefully constructed walls.
###Chapter 195

Ethan Blackwood's unexpected trust in her, despite his young age, caught Vivian Prescott completely off guard.

"Can I call you Aunt Vivian from now on?" Ethan gazed up at her with hopeful eyes.

Vivian nodded, a soft smile playing on her lips, though her heart wavered at the memory of him calling her Mom moments ago.

"Of course."

At her answer, a rare smile finally brightened Ethan's face.

It was the first time Vivian had ever seen him smile—whether three years ago or now.

Dimples appeared at the corners of his mouth, making him look warm and endearing, just like Amelia.

A wave of tenderness flooded Vivian's chest at the sight of his angelic expression.

Not long after, Alexander arrived.

He moved to enter, but Vivian blocked his path at the door.

"Please take better care of your son, Mr. Blackwood. After all, he is the precious child of you and your beloved." Her words carried a deeper meaning. Turning back, she gave Ethan a gentle smile. "Come on, Ethan. Your father is here to take you home. You can visit again next time."

"Okay." Ethan nodded and shuffled reluctantly to stand beside Alexander.

Instead of greeting his father, he remained silent, his small frame tense.

The distance between father and son struck Vivian as strange and unsettling.

"Thank you, Miss Prescott." Alexander's gratitude was stiff. He opened his mouth to say more but was interrupted by an untimely call.

The caller ID flashed Victoria Lancaster.

He hesitated briefly before answering.

The moment the call connected, Victoria's frantic voice pierced through. "Alexander! I went to pick Ethan up from school, but they said a woman named Vivian Prescott took him! What does she want? Why would she kidnap our son? Alexander, I'm terrified—what if she hurts him? Alexander—!"

Vivian couldn't help but overhear every word, given Victoria's hysterical volume.

Amused, she watched Alexander's frown deepen as he prepared to respond. But before he could, Vivian snatched the phone from his hand and pressed it to her ear.

Victoria's shrill voice continued. "Alexander, can you hear me? Al—"

"Miss Lancaster? You're right. I have kidnapped your son. In fact, I've got your fiancé here too. Want to save them? Then bring the ransom to my place. Oh, and don't forget to call the police while you're at it."

Silence.

Victoria froze, processing Vivian's mocking tone.

Imagining her furious, flustered expression, Vivian smirked and handed the phone back to Alexander.

"Quite the dramatic one, isn't she? The legendary love of your life must be exhausting to handle."

With a warm smile, she waved at Ethan. "Goodbye, Ethan. See you soon."

Ethan grinned and waved back. "Bye, Aunt Vivian."

Vivian nodded and swiftly closed the door.

From the corner of her eye, she caught Alexander's stormy expression and couldn't help but smirk.

The next day, Alexander surprised her by appearing at her boutique while she worked.

Dressed in a tailored suit, his commanding presence drew envious glances from everyone around.

He strode straight to her, cutting to the chase.

"Grandfather is convinced you're Evelyn Sinclair, my ex-wife. He wants you to attend Blackwood Enterprises' 50th-anniversary gala in two days."

Vivian didn't look up from her sketch. "I'm afraid I'll have to decline. I'd rather not invite unnecessary trouble—or be mistaken for your damned ex-wife again."

She lifted her gaze, meeting his dark, unreadable eyes, and chuckled.

"You suspect it too, don't you, Mr. Blackwood? That I'm her."

Her voice dripped with irony.

"That night at the club—you weren't really drunk, were you? You knew exactly what you were doing when you clung to me, whispering sweet words meant for Evelyn."

She tilted her head. "Or have you forgotten? Everyone knows how much you loathed Evelyn Sinclair. There's no way you'd mourn her like that—let alone say the things you claimed you wanted to say—if she were still alive."
###Chapter 196

A cold shiver ran down Alexander's spine as he caught the mocking glint in Evelyn's piercing gaze.

His lips pressed into a thin line, his dark eyes burning into hers.

"With that being said, I'd appreciate it if you stopped seeking me out, Mr. Blackwood. I have no desire to be mistaken for a ghost again." Evelyn's voice was ice.

"It won't happen again."

Alexander hesitated before speaking, his deep voice barely above a whisper.

Leaning closer, his breath warm against her cheek, he repeated, "I promise you, it won't."

Evelyn let out a humorless laugh. "Are you confessing to testing me that day, Mr. Blackwood?"

His silence spoke volumes.

While the world believed Evelyn had been hopelessly in love with Alexander, only he knew the truth - his own consuming love for her.

That day had been madness. Not a test, but a desperate fantasy that she might still be alive.

Now reality had shattered the illusion.

This woman before him was not the one buried in his heart.

Evelyn interpreted his silence as admission.

"How generous of you," she sneered. "Very well, I'll accept your invitation. Offending the mighty Alexander Blackwood wouldn't bode well for my business in Willowbrook."

Despite her reluctant tone, attending Blackwood Enterprises' anniversary was exactly what she needed.

It was the perfect stage to expose Victoria's true nature to the elite.

After accepting the invitation, Evelyn promptly mailed it anonymously to a certain someone.

Later that afternoon, she visited an exclusive boutique to collect her custom-ordered gown.

Fate had a cruel sense of humor. The moment Evelyn stepped inside, she spotted Victoria being fawned over by three attendants.

"These are our newest arrivals, Miss Lancaster. Particularly these pieces - they complement your elegance perfectly," gushed an attendant.

Victoria examined the price tags with disdain. "These won't do. Far too common for someone of my standing. Don't you have anything more... exclusive?"

"Right this way, Miss Lancaster!" The attendants practically tripped over themselves to lead her to the VIP section.

"What about this limited edition piece? It would make you the belle of Blackwood Enterprises' gala!"

"And you'd look absolutely divine beside Mr. Blackwood!" another added.

Victoria preened under their flattery, until her gaze landed on a mannequin near the entrance.

"That one. I want to try it on," she demanded, pointing to an exquisite gown.

The attendants exchanged nervous glances. "I'm afraid that piece has already been reserved, Miss Lancaster."

"Then order another," Victoria snapped, her covetous stare fixed on the dress.

"It's... a one-of-a-kind piece, handmade in Paris. There are no duplicates."

Victoria's expression darkened. "I want that dress. Tell your client it's delayed. Unless you'd rather lose my patronage?"

The attendants hesitated before one reached for the gown. "Right away, Miss Lancaster."

Just as the attendant lifted the dress, a cool voice cut through the tension.

"How predictable. Just like old times - Victoria Lancaster stealing what isn't hers."

Victoria whirled around, her face twisting in recognition. "Vivian Prescott?" Her saccharine smile returned. "My, my. I didn't realize secondhand jewelry dealers could afford this establishment."

Evelyn smirked. "Unlike some, I actually earn my money rather than leeching off family fortunes."

Victoria's smile vanished. "Hurry up with that dress!" she snapped at the attendants before turning back to Evelyn. "Alexander is waiting for me at Le Cirque."

The attendants hastily packaged the gown, presenting it to Victoria with trembling hands.

Just as Victoria reached for it, Evelyn smoothly intercepted the bag.

"What the hell are you doing?" Victoria shrieked.

The attendants gasped. "Miss! That belongs to Miss Lancaster!"

"Does it?" Evelyn arched a brow. "Funny, because I'm fairly certain this is the dress I commissioned three weeks ago."

Victoria scoffed. "Dream on. Liking something doesn't make it yours, darling."

The attendants tittered. "This is a couture piece worth six figures. Please return it immediately or we'll call security."
###Chapter 197

Evelyn's gaze swept over the haughty sales associates and the smug Victoria Lancaster. With deliberate slowness, she withdrew a sleek black card from her clutch.

She flicked it directly at the salesgirl who'd threatened to call security. "Pick that up and tell me if I'm worthy of this dress now."

The assistant gasped at Evelyn's commanding presence. Her hands trembled as she retrieved the fallen card. The moment she read the embossed name, her face drained of color.

"Miss Prescott! Forgive me! I didn't realize—" The girl bowed so low her nose nearly touched her knees. "Please accept my deepest apologies!"

Curious whispers erupted as other staff members clustered around. Their expressions transformed instantly when they saw the exclusive Black Diamond membership card bearing Vivian Prescott's name.

Victoria's perfectly sculpted eyebrows shot up. "What nonsense is this? Why are you groveling to some jewelry peddler?" She snatched the card from the trembling assistant's hand.

Her mocking smirk froze mid-curve. "This...this can't be real." Victoria's manicured nails dug into the card's edges. "You're a Black Diamond member? Impossible!"

Evelyn tilted her head, enjoying how Victoria's flawless complexion mottled with rage. The Lancaster heiress had been trying for years to earn this boutique's highest membership tier without success.

"Does this jewelry peddler meet your standards now?" Evelyn plucked the card back with elegant fingers. She turned toward the dressing rooms, the silk train of her chosen gown whispering against the marble floor.

"Stop!" Victoria's stiletto heels clicked furiously across the floor. "That dress was reserved weeks ago by someone far more important than you!"

Evelyn paused without turning. "How fascinating. Because I'm the one who reserved it precisely eighteen days ago." She glanced over her shoulder. "Check your records, ladies."

A senior sales associate rushed forward. "It's true, Miss Lancaster. Miss Prescott placed the deposit on this gown the day it arrived from Paris."

Victoria's mouth opened and closed like a beached fish. Her designer clutch creaked under her death grip.

"Enjoy window shopping," Evelyn murmured as the staff formed an honor guard to escort her out. "Do give my regards to Alexander when you see him. Though given his recent...distaste for your company, that might not be soon."

Victoria's porcelain skin turned an unbecoming shade of puce. "How dare you—"

"Oh, I dare." Evelyn's smile was all sharp edges. "We're just getting started, Victoria. Every slight, every betrayal—I'll collect them all with interest."

The boutique doors swung shut behind her, cutting off Victoria's incoherent sputters. Evelyn inhaled the crisp afternoon air, her fingers trailing along the garment bag containing her victory.

This was merely the opening move in their deadly dance. And Evelyn Sinclair never missed a step.
###Chapter 198

Victoria stormed into the Montgomery manor, her chest heaving with barely contained rage. The moment she crossed the threshold, the housekeeper Beatrice hurried forward with a tray.

"Miss Victoria, you look upset. Some tea and macarons might help calm your nerves." Beatrice offered a practiced smile.

"Since when do servants question their betters?" Victoria snapped, tossing her designer bag onto the marble console. "Where's Mother?"

The distant purr of a luxury engine answered her. Beatrice glanced toward the driveway. "Madam Kingsley has just arrived."

Victoria's demeanor shifted instantly. "Tell her I'm in my suite when she asks." She snatched up her bag and swept up the grand staircase without another glance.

Beatrice's smile vanished the moment Victoria's back turned. Her fingers tightened around the tray. "You stole everything from sweet Sophia, you viper. She'd still be the Montgomery heiress if not for your scheming."

The click of designer heels announced Eleanor's arrival. "Beatrice, has Victoria returned?"

The housekeeper schooled her features into perfect deference. "Yes, Madam. Miss Victoria retired to her chambers moments ago."

Eleanor's face lit up as she ascended the stairs, clutching an exquisite velvet box. "Darling, wait until you see what I've brought you! Only my daughter deserves Lady Belle's latest collection. You'll outshine every socialite at Blackwood Enterprises' gala tonight—"

Her words died as she pushed open Victoria's bedroom door. The jewelry box clattered to the floor.

"Victoria Lancaster! Put that down this instant!" Eleanor lunged forward, wresting the letter opener from her daughter's trembling hands.

"Who dared hurt my precious girl?" Eleanor crushed Victoria to her chest, her pulse racing. After losing one daughter twenty years ago, she'd burn Willowbrook to the ground before losing another.

Victoria buried her face in Eleanor's shoulder, forcing ragged sobs. "It's unbearable, Mother. First Evelyn, now Vivian Prescott... Alexander barely glances at me anymore. She's always there—laughing with him, touching him—"

"Vivian Prescott?" Eleanor's blood ran cold. The spitting image of Evelyn Sinclair.

"What has that conniving little—"

"She humiliated me at the charity luncheon." Victoria's voice cracked perfectly. "Mocked how Alexander would never marry a Crawford impostor. She's using Ethan to get closer to him, and I think... I think he returns her feelings."

Tears streaked Victoria's carefully made-up face as she clutched Eleanor's hands. "I've loved Alexander since we were children at Pinecrest Heights. If I can't have him, I'd rather—"

"Don't you dare finish that sentence!" Eleanor's grip turned vice-like. "That gold-digging tart isn't worth your little finger. Let me handle this."

"No, Mother!" Victoria clung to Eleanor's arm. "If you confront her, she'll run to Alexander. I can't bear him thinking ill of me."

A calculated pause. Then, with trembling lips: "But there is another way... Will you help me?"

Eleanor cupped her daughter's face. "Anything, my darling. Name it."

Victoria's tear-filled eyes gleamed with something far darker than grief. "I need you to arrange an invitation for Vivian to the Blackwood gala." Her fingers tightened around Eleanor's. "Let me handle the rest."
###Chapter 199

The day of Blackwood Enterprises' golden jubilee arrived before anyone could blink.

Evelyn Sinclair indulged in a full spa treatment before settling before her vanity to begin her transformation.

She slipped into the couture gown that Victoria Lancaster could only dream of owning, grabbed her designer clutch, and stepped into the waiting car bound for Willowbrook's first six-star luxury hotel.

As twilight descended, street lamps flickered to life along the boulevard. Evelyn caught her reflection in the car window, crimson lips curving as she adjusted the delicate tendrils framing her face.

The driver nearly missed a red light when her radiant smile flashed in the rearview mirror - he'd never encountered such breathtaking beauty.

Meanwhile, the hotel's grand entrance swarmed with activity.

Reporters jostled for prime positions while bystanders gathered for complimentary gifts. Invited guests streamed through the doors toward the celebration hall on the top floor.

The event glittered with A-list celebrities attending Blackwood Enterprises' milestone anniversary.

Though denied her first-choice gown, Victoria had crafted an impeccable look radiating elegance and sophistication.

As the future Mrs. Blackwood, her appearance couldn't afford any missteps tonight.

Alexander Blackwood made his entrance in a custom Tom Ford tuxedo that accentuated his athletic frame.

Chandelier light danced across his chiseled features as he moved with regal grace through the crowd. Women edged closer, only to retreat from the ice in his piercing gaze.

Victoria seized the opportunity to position herself as his partner, greeting guests with practiced charm.

She thrived on the envious stares directed her way - standing beside Alexander cemented her elite status.

Scanning the room, Alexander's lips thinned. "Why so many reporters?"

Victoria's eyes sparkled. "It's Blackwood's fiftieth anniversary, darling. Naturally the press wants to document this historic event."

"That doesn't explain the entertainment reporters," he countered coolly, checking his watch.

Though irritated by his distraction, Victoria maintained her smile. "Waiting for someone, Alexander? Miss Prescott perhaps?"

Ignoring her, he stepped aside to make a call. Victoria's grip tightened on her champagne flute as Eleanor Kingsley approached.

"It's all arranged," Eleanor murmured. "The reporters know, and Margaret Blackwood's been informed. Once they announce your wedding date, Henry Blackwood will pressure Alexander into compliance. There'll be no escape."

Victoria's smile returned. "Thank you, Mother."

"My darling girl," Eleanor squeezed her hand. "Who else would I do this for? I'll always stand by you."

Beneath her grateful expression, Victoria's thoughts turned venomous. 'That's right, Eleanor Kingsley. Never forget - I'm your daughter now.'

Outside, Evelyn's phone rang just as her car arrived. After ending the call, she emerged onto the red carpet.

Her gaze locked onto a familiar figure striding through the hotel doors, invitation held with arrogant nonchalance.

Evelyn's lips curved.

Perfect.

Her key witness had taken the bait.

Satisfaction warmed her as she glided toward the entrance, every step calculated for maximum impact. Tonight's performance would be unforgettable.
###Chapter 200

All gazes snapped toward Evelyn the moment her stiletto touched the marble steps of Blackwood Estate.

Inside the grand ballroom, Alexander's fingers tightened around his champagne flute. A storm brewed in his glacial blue eyes as he recalled the dozen unanswered calls to Evelyn's phone.

Then came the familiar tug at his tailored trousers.

Looking down, Alexander met Ethan's expectant face.

"Where's Vivian? Isn't she coming?" The boy's voice carried the same hopeful lilt that twisted Alexander's gut.

The sight of his son always resurrected that fateful night - the night he'd scattered Amelia's ashes to the wind.

Ethan's small hand in his pulled him back to the present.

"Alexander." Victoria's saccharine voice cut through his thoughts.

Ethan immediately recoiled, but Victoria's manicured nails dug into his wrist. "Where do you think you're going, sweetheart?" Her smile didn't reach her cold eyes.

"Mother wants us," she purred, batting her lashes at Alexander. "She has an important announcement."

Alexander's jaw clenched. "What kind of announcement?"

Victoria feigned innocence. "Something about Blackwood Enterprises, perhaps? We shouldn't keep her waiting."

As Margaret Blackwood ascended the podium, Alexander moved forward with measured steps. Victoria dragged a resisting Ethan behind her.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Margaret's voice rang out, "thank you for honoring us with your presence tonight. As Alexander's mother, I'm delighted to share some wonderful news."

Murmurs rippled through the crowd.

"Is it the wedding announcement?"

"It must be! Look how close Victoria's standing to Alexander!"

Victoria preened while Alexander's expression darkened.

Margaret beamed. "Yes, the announcement concerns this marr—"

"Who is that?"

"My God, isn't that the woman from the Diamond Boulevard incident?"

The ballroom erupted as all heads swiveled toward the entrance.

There, silhouetted against the golden light, stood Evelyn in a liquid silver gown that cascaded like molten moonlight.

Every step sent the delicate fabric swirling around her legs. The diamond choker at her throat caught the light, scattering prismatic sparks across the room.

The crowd collectively held their breath.

Evelyn wasn't just beautiful - she was devastating. From the knowing curve of her lips to the dangerous glint in her emerald eyes, she commanded attention effortlessly.

As whispers crescendoed, Evelyn glided straight toward the stunned trio. She stopped inches from Alexander, her perfume - something dark and floral - wrapping around him.

"I'm here, Alexander," she murmured, tilting her head just so.

Alexander's breath hitched. "What did you call me?" His voice was rougher than he intended.

Evelyn's smile deepened. She reached up, her fingers brushing his lapel in a gesture both intimate and possessive.

The entire ballroom watched, transfixed, as the woman they'd believed dead stood before them, more alive than ever.
###Chapter 201

Evelyn's eyes curved into perfect crescents as she watched Alexander's shocked reaction.

"What's wrong, Alexander? It's me... Evelyn."

Silence.

That name struck Alexander's heart like a dagger, stealing his breath away.

Noticing his stunned expression, Evelyn tilted her head with a knowing smile. She stepped closer, her voice a velvet whisper. "Is something the matter, Mr. Blackwood? I thought you specifically requested my presence tonight as your ex-wife?"

Her words wrapped around Alexander's racing pulse like silk.

Hearing her response, his heartbeat gradually steadied.

'So that's it.'

Gazing at her breathtaking beauty, a wave of loneliness crashed over him.

But Alexander masked it perfectly. Within seconds, his lips curved into that signature charming smirk. "You came."

Evelyn mirrored his smile. "Of course I did."

Victoria couldn't tolerate their proximity any longer. The way they were speaking made her blood boil.

"Miss Prescott. You're here."

She forced a saccharine smile as she approached. Then with calculated innocence, she blinked up at Alexander.

"What were you two discussing? Anything interesting?"

"I'm afraid that's between Alexander and me." Evelyn's smile turned conspiratorial. "Isn't that right, Alexander?"

Victoria's plastered smile faltered, but she quickly recovered. "Well then! As Alexander's fiancée, allow me to officially welcome you to tonight's celebration!"

She abruptly turned to Alexander. "Darling, Mrs. Blackwood hasn't finished her announcement yet. We should let her continue."

Her pointed look made Margaret Blackwood stiffen on stage.

Reading the room, Evelyn's gaze lingered on Alexander's impassive face. "I'll go find some refreshments. Excuse me."

Alexander gave a barely perceptible nod, his eyes tracing her movements. "Hmm."

He couldn't deny her beauty affected him.

His pulse had betrayed him the moment she appeared.

Now his breathing felt uneven, his heartbeat wild and untamed.

She reminded him so painfully of 'her' - the woman he'd wronged, the woman who'd died hating him...

Accepting a champagne flute from a passing server, Evelyn became acutely aware of the curious stares following her.

She sipped elegantly, the crystal glass catching the light.

Then she sensed someone approaching from behind.

Before she could turn, Eleanor's icy warning slithered into her ear. "Listen carefully, Vivian Prescott. Alexander is engaged to my daughter Victoria. Their wedding is imminent. Don't even think about interfering."

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the stem. She turned with a serene smile, though the words pierced her heart.

"If I recall correctly, wasn't your daughter the other woman originally? And wasn't Evelyn Sinclair the wife she stole the husband from?" Her gaze turned razor-sharp. "They say we look identical. Perhaps that explains your hostility, Mrs. Kingsley?"

Eleanor's face darkened instantly. "How dare you! My daughter never stole anyone. Evelyn Sinclair was the shameless harlot who seduced my son-in-law. Victoria and Alexander would've been happily married years ago if not for her!"
###Chapter 202

Evelyn's lips curved into a casual smile. "Did you witness it yourself, Mrs. Kingsley? How can you be so certain that Evelyn Sinclair is the disgraceful woman you claim her to be?"

"Absolutely certain!" Eleanor spat, her voice dripping with venom. "I saw with my own eyes how vile and heartless Evelyn Sinclair was! Over and over, she hurt my precious daughter and grandson. Death would be too kind for a creature like her!"

Eleanor's jaw clenched, each word laced with such hatred it seemed to poison the air around them. The loathing in her eyes suggested even death wouldn't satisfy her thirst for vengeance.

A second later, Evelyn heard Eleanor scoff derisively.

"Though you may share Evelyn Sinclair's face, Miss Prescott, I sincerely hope you won't stoop to her despicable level!"

With a haughty toss of her head, Eleanor turned on her heel and marched back to Victoria's side.

The mother-daughter pair clasped hands, their bond appearing stronger than ever.

Evelyn pressed her lips together as she watched the nauseating display.

Oh, Mother.

My dearest mother.

I wonder what you'll do when you discover the 'shameless wretch' you despise is actually your own flesh and blood.

Will you keep believing Victoria's lies? Will you keep cursing your own daughter as a monster? Or... will you finally embrace me and call me 'darling'?

A sharp pang shot through Evelyn's chest.

Her mouth twisted into a bitter smile. Raising her champagne flute, she felt a gentle tug on her gown's hem.

"Big Sis Vivian." Ethan's clear voice cut through her thoughts.

Looking down at his earnest little face, some of the ache in Evelyn's heart eased.

"Good evening, Ethan." She ruffled his soft hair affectionately.

"Did Amelia come with you, Big Sis Vivian?" Ethan blinked up at her expectantly.

Before she could answer, Alexander's rich baritone voice carried across the ballroom from the stage.

Mrs. Blackwood, who was supposed to announce the wedding, had been discreetly ushered aside. Now Alexander stood center stage under the spotlight, delivering his opening speech.

Dressed in an impeccably tailored suit, he exuded power and aristocracy. Every gesture oozed charisma, every word commanded attention.

A man like him was the fantasy of countless women.

But fantasies were dangerous—like moths drawn to a flame, they'd only get burned by his scorching brilliance.

Evelyn chuckled darkly. She'd learned that lesson too late, nearly paying with her life.

Swirling her drink, she caught movement in her peripheral vision. Smiling warmly at Ethan, she said, "Big Sis Vivian needs to visit the ladies' room. Wait for me here, okay?"

"Okay! I'll be right here!" Ethan nodded solemnly, his earnest promise reminding her painfully of one Alexander had made years ago.

He's your son through and through—even in making promises.

Though you, Alexander, lack his innocence.

Following the shadowy figure down the corridor, Evelyn heard a familiar, carefree hum.

She positioned herself by the restroom door. When footsteps approached from inside, she casually turned on the faucet, pretending to wash her hands.

Moments later, a man staggered out of the men's room. Still humming, his intoxicated gaze raked over Evelyn's curves before finally landing on her face.

The instant their eyes met, his expression morphed into sheer terror.

Stumbling backward, he crashed into the doorframe. "Y-You're...!"
###Chapter 203

Dominic's face turned ghostly pale as he pointed a shaking finger at Evelyn, who was calmly washing her hands at the sink.

His breath hitched.

Staggering to his feet, he pressed a hand against the wall for support—his legs had turned to jelly beneath him.

This was his first time attending such an extravagant gala, and he had indulged in far too much champagne, thinking it would ease his nerves.

But now, under the haze of alcohol, Evelyn's hauntingly beautiful smile flickered in his vision like a ghostly apparition.

Her face multiplied before his eyes, the figures closing in on him.

He couldn't breathe.

Terrified, he stumbled backward, his words slurring.

"E-Evelyn Sinclair! Why won't you just disappear? The one you want is Victoria! Not me!"

Watching him tremble like a leaf, Evelyn stepped forward, the sharp click of her heels echoing in the empty restroom.

A slow, knowing smile curved her lips.

"You're asking why I'm haunting you? I think you already know the answer."

"Ah!" Dominic bolted into the men's restroom, slamming the door behind him. "I don't know anything! Go after Victoria if you want revenge! Leave me alone!"

His heart pounded violently against his ribs.

Silence settled outside.

Cautiously, he peeked out—only to find the hallway completely empty.

The realization sent a fresh wave of terror through him.

He turned on the faucet, splashing cold water onto his face, desperate to sober up.

But no matter how hard he scrubbed, Evelyn's piercing gaze and that chilling smile remained burned into his mind.

Back in the ballroom, the atmosphere had lightened.

Guests mingled, sipping champagne and laughing over delicate hors d'oeuvres.

Evelyn's eyes landed on Henry Blackwood, and for a moment, she had to fight the urge to rush to him.

Impulsiveness wouldn't serve her now.

Across the room, Victoria seethed, her nails digging into her palm.

Her perfect plan had crumbled, and now she had to maintain her sweet facade while watching Evelyn steal the spotlight.

Her eyes narrowed as Alexander approached Evelyn, leaning in close to whisper something in her ear.

Then, to Victoria's horror, he offered his arm—and Evelyn took it.

Her grip tightened around her champagne flute, the delicate stem threatening to snap.

She watched, fuming, as Alexander led Evelyn straight to Henry Blackwood.

The old man's face lit up the moment he saw her.

He even reached out to pat her shoulder affectionately.

"Evelyn, my dear! You've made this old man's night."

Henry treated her as if nothing had ever happened.

He had never judged her, never doubted her.

In fact, he had been the only one who stood by her, protecting her fiercely since the day she married Alexander.

Gratitude swelled in Evelyn's chest.

Three years ago, when Henry had been hospitalized with heart complications, she had been terrified.

Seeing him now, healthy and vibrant, eased the lingering ache in her heart.

But then Henry sighed, shaking his head.

"Such a brilliant woman—beautiful, intelligent. And yet my grandson was too blind to see what he had."

He shot Alexander a disapproving glare.

"What was so wrong with Evelyn that you'd throw her away for that other one? Hmph!"

Evelyn's lips curved faintly.

"It wasn't Alexander's fault, Grandfather. Some things just aren't meant to be. Right, Alexander?"

She lifted her gaze—only to find his dark eyes already fixed on her.

Had he been watching her this entire time?

His expression was unreadable, but there was something in his gaze—something warm, almost regretful.

His lips parted.

"Fate had nothing to do with it. The truth is, I never deserved you."

Evelyn froze.

His words struck her like a physical blow.

"Tell me, Evelyn," he murmured, his voice low. "If we could start over... would you let me love you properly this time?"

Her breath caught.

She felt his arm tighten slightly around hers, as if afraid she might vanish if he loosened his grip.

Henry scoffed, breaking the tension.

"Hmph! If I were Evelyn, I'd say no!"

Evelyn exhaled shakily.

For a moment, she had almost let herself hope.

But this was just another one of Alexander's games—another performance for his grandfather's sake.
###Chapter 204

"Starting over is far easier said than done, Alexander."

"The scars you carved into my soul will never fade."

"Loving you belongs to the past."

"All that remains is hatred."

Just then, Eleanor approached with Victoria trailing behind her. "You seem cheerful, Grandfather. What were you discussing with this woman?"

"Woman?" Henry Blackwood's expression darkened. "This is Evelyn."

"She's not, Grandfather," Victoria interjected sweetly. "Evelyn died three years ago. This is Miss Vivian Prescott—she merely resembles her." She turned to Alexander with confidence. "Isn't that right, Alexander?"

She expected him to lean in, to whisper agreement. Instead, his face twisted in disgust.

Henry Blackwood's fury flared. "Nonsense! This is Evelyn!"

"She truly isn't, Old Master!" Margaret Blackwood joined them, casting a wary glance at Alexander before speaking. "Think about it—would we allow Evelyn Sinclair back into this house?"

"Exactly!" Eleanor chimed in, sneering at Vivian. "If this were really Evelyn, we would've thrown her out already. That shameless woman died three years ago!"

The color drained from Henry's face, his spirit visibly dimming.

Vivian turned to Alexander, concern flickering in her eyes.

Alexander's expression turned glacial. "Are you all finished?"

"Don't be angry, Alexander." Victoria clutched his arm, her voice honeyed. "Mother and Mrs. Blackwood are right. She isn't Evelyn. Grandfather needs to accept the truth eventually."

She gave Vivian a pointed look. "You shouldn't pretend to be Evelyn just to humor him, Miss Prescott. Lies will only hurt him more when they unravel."

"Besides," she added with a smirk, "do you really want to be associated with someone like Evelyn? A woman who threw herself at men and even kidnapped my and Alexander's son?"

Vivian surveyed the room, then smiled faintly. "Oh? Was she truly that terrible?"

"Absolutely!" Victoria declared, her voice rising. "She was desperate, manipulative, and cruel. Do you really want to be her double?"

"Enough!" Henry slammed his cane against the floor. "Evelyn would never do such things!"

Victoria sighed dramatically. "It's the truth, Grandfather. Alexander knows it too." She turned to him. "You saw it yourself, didn't you?"

Alexander's expression darkened, bile rising in his throat at the memories.

He had realized too late that every "sin" Evelyn supposedly committed might have been a lie.

Perhaps everything he'd witnessed was staged.

Victoria tugged at his sleeve, pouting when he ignored her. "Why aren't you saying anything, Alexander? Unless... you actually want Miss Prescott to replace Evelyn?" Her voice dripped with false concern. "But what will people think of her, pretending to be such a vile woman?"

Crash!

A wine glass shattered across the floor.

"Sir, are you alright?"

"A ghost! It's a ghost!"

All eyes snapped toward the commotion—a server helping a man who had stumbled.

Victoria barely glanced over until she recognized the man.

Dominic Fletcher.

And the "ghost" he was pointing at?

Vivian Prescott.
###Chapter 205

Dominic Fletcher!

That despicable man!

How had he managed to get inside?

A cold dread settled in Victoria's stomach.

Dominic was pointing at Vivian, his face contorted in terror as if he'd seen a ghost!

This could only mean one thing - he'd mistaken Vivian for Evelyn and was having a complete breakdown. And in this state, he might blurt out dangerous truths.

Yet Evelyn's lips curved slightly at Dominic's terrified scream. From her peripheral vision, she watched panic flash across Victoria's face. Then, with feigned confusion, Evelyn approached the trembling man.

Their eyes met, and Dominic's fear escalated. "Ah! It's... It's really you!" he shrieked, alcohol amplifying his terror. There was no doubt in his mind - Evelyn's ghost had come to torment him!

For all his past sins, this haunting seemed like divine justice.

Evelyn arched an elegant brow. "Do you know this gentleman, Mr. Blackwood? Why does he look so frightened of me?"

Alexander had no idea Evelyn herself had arranged Dominic's invitation to tonight's gala.

His brows furrowed as he strode toward Dominic, his handsome features turning glacial. The sight of this man reminded him of the attempted assaults on Evelyn and the sordid rumors he'd spread.

"Alexander!" Victoria rushed forward, clutching his arm. "This is Blackwood Enterprises' 50th anniversary! Don't let this drunkard ruin the evening. Just have security remove him."

"Am I correct in assuming you recognize this man, Miss Lancaster?" Evelyn inquired innocently. "Who exactly is he?"

Victoria's lips thinned in displeasure. "He was... associated with Evelyn. Let's just say their relationship wasn't exactly proper—"

"That's enough."

Alexander's icy interruption silenced Victoria mid-sentence. The dangerous glint in his eyes made several guests shiver.

"Oh... I see." Evelyn nodded understandingly before approaching Dominic, who was swaying against a table for support. "Sir, you seem unwell. Perhaps you should leave—"

"Stay back, Evelyn! Don't come near me! I know you have unfinished business, but if you want revenge, haunt Victoria! She's the one who killed you!"

The ballroom plunged into stunned silence.

Evelyn tilted her head, her innocent gaze meeting Alexander's frozen stare. "What is this man saying, Mr. Blackwood? What does he mean about haunting? And why mention Victoria?"

Victoria felt the temperature drop around her as if she'd been thrown into an ice cellar. Not daring to look at Alexander's expression, she rushed toward Dominic. "You're drunk, Dominic! There's no ghost here! Evelyn is gone! And I never harmed her - she was like a sister to me! Don't spread these lies!"

Dominic sobered slightly at Victoria's shouting, but when he saw Evelyn's knowing smile, terror gripped him again.

"Evelyn's right here! Can't you all see her? Am I the only one? She's definitely come for me!"
###Chapter 206

Dominic Fletcher's face turned ashen, his pupils dilating with sheer terror.

"Get away from me, Evelyn! Stop haunting me! I—I was just following orders! I was paid to do it!"

"Dominic Fletcher!" Victoria Lancaster cut in sharply, her voice trembling as she signaled the bodyguards. "Remove this man immediately!"

Dominic ignored her, his shaking finger pointing accusingly at Victoria.

"Evelyn Sinclair! If—If you want revenge, haunt her! It was all Victoria's doing! She orchestrated everything!"

Victoria felt an icy chill crawl down her spine. The air around her thickened with tension, and she didn’t dare look at Alexander Blackwood’s expression.

"What’s going on? Who is this man? What is he talking about?" Margaret Blackwood rushed forward, her voice laced with alarm.

Victoria desperately tried to deflect. "Mrs. Blackwood! This is Dominic Fletcher. He and Evelyn were involved in an illicit affair. They also plotted Ethan’s kidnapping together!"

"So it’s you!" Eleanor Kingsley’s face flushed with rage as she advanced on Dominic. "You helped that wretched woman take my grandchild! You monster! Evelyn Sinclair may be dead, but you’re still breathing? You deserve to die!"

"Indeed."

Alexander’s voice was like a blade of ice, freezing the air in Victoria’s lungs.

Dominic, now sobering up, realized the danger he was in. He tried to back away, but Alexander’s grip tightened around his tie like a noose.

"Say it again," Alexander commanded, his eyes burning with lethal intent.

Dominic shuddered, cold sweat drenching his back.

Victoria’s heart pounded as she watched, terrified the truth would unravel. She stumbled forward, her voice frantic.

"Alexander, please—ignore him! He’s drunk and delusional! He’s just trying to cause trouble. Let him go!"

Alexander’s gaze flicked to her, his lips curling into a chilling smirk. "Delusional? A liar? That’s not what you told me before. You were very certain when you claimed he was Evelyn’s ex-lover."

"I—Alexander, I didn’t lie! If anyone lied, it was Dominic and Evelyn—" she babbled, panic rising.

"Then let’s find out who’s really lying."

His voice was so cold it sent shivers down Victoria’s spine.

With that, Alexander yanked Dominic forward, forcing him to face Evelyn. "Look at her. Tell me why you of all people think she’s haunting you."

Dominic’s mind was still foggy, but as his eyes locked onto Evelyn, his legs nearly gave out.

Guilt was a heavy burden to bear.

Trembling, he fell to his knees, his voice breaking. "It wasn’t me! I swear! Yes, Evelyn, I—I wanted you back then, but I never touched you! It was all Victoria! She made me lie! If you want revenge, take it from her! She’s the one who pulled the strings!"
###Chapter 207

The truth finally spilled out through Dominic's drunken confession.

Alexander's face darkened instantly, his eyes burning with unrestrained fury.

His fist connected hard with Dominic's jaw.

Dominic staggered back, his vision swimming from the impact.

Glass shattered as he crashed into the banquet table behind him.

Alexander didn't stop. He hauled Dominic up and delivered two more brutal punches.

Blood trickled from Dominic's split lip as his face twisted in pain.

No one dared intervene.

Alexander radiated terrifying rage, his anger so palpable it felt dangerous to approach.

For three years, Alexander had believed the worst about Evelyn.

Especially regarding her innocence. The realization of his blindness made his stomach churn.

Now the truth was laid bare, he couldn't face the guilt - or the haunting image of her face.

Watching the scene unfold, Evelyn allowed herself the smallest smirk.

Finally.

Finally, Dominic had revealed the truth about her framed disgrace.

Finally, her name was cleared.

The wounds in her heart ached slightly less.

But the scars remained, the burning embers of hatred still glowing within her.

"Dominic! How could you betray me like this?" Victoria shrieked, her eyes red with manufactured tears.

She had to defend herself now.

Eleanor immediately jumped to her daughter's defense. "Don't listen to this drunkard's nonsense! Everyone knew what kind of woman Evelyn was!"

Dominic spat blood, more afraid of Alexander's wrath than Evelyn's ghostly vengeance.

The beating had sobered him enough to realize his loose tongue had sealed his fate. Survival was his only concern now.

"I swear, Mr. Blackwood! Victoria ordered me to lie about Evelyn. Yes, I admired her, but I never touched her! And the kidnapping - that was all Victoria's-"

"Dominic Fletcher! God sees your lies!" Victoria cut him off. "I'll sue you for slander! Guards! Remove him before Mr. Blackwood has to!"

The security team dragged the semi-conscious Dominic from the ballroom.

Though removed, everyone had heard his damning confession.

"Just... just a misunderstanding," Victoria forced a smile, then turned tearful eyes to Alexander. "Darling, you can't believe-"

"I knew Evelyn was innocent!" Henry Blackwood thundered, cutting Victoria off. "You conspired with that thug to frame her! You'd kidnap your own son to destroy her? Unforgivable!"

Victoria shook her head, tears streaming. "Grandfather Blackwood, you can't believe a criminal's word over mine! Ethan is my child - how could I hurt him?"

"My daughter would never do such things," Eleanor said coldly, far calmer than her hysterical daughter.

"Hmph!" Henry Blackwood turned away in disgust. He believed none of their lies.
###Chapter 208

Evelyn didn't care about Henry Blackwood's opinion. The only person whose belief mattered to her was Alexander's.

Her shimmering eyes searched the icy man's face. "You believe me, don't you, Alexander?"

Her voice was feather-soft as she reached for Alexander's hands, desperate for his trust.

Instead, she received only a skeptical sideways glance that cut through her like winter wind. Without uttering a word, he turned and walked away.

"Alexander! Alexander—"

Tears spilled freely down Victoria's cheeks as she watched his retreating form.

Eleanor Kingsley moved to comfort her. "There, there, Victoria. Alexander is intelligent. He won't be fooled by such obvious lies!"

Victoria nodded, dabbing at her eyes. "I'll go talk to him."

"Victoria." Eleanor sighed mournfully before shooting Evelyn a venomous glare.

Meeting Eleanor's hostile stare, Evelyn merely smiled and approached without hesitation. "If I recall correctly, you were quite certain about Evelyn's shameless nature, weren't you, Mrs. Kingsley? Yet the truth reveals your precious daughter fits that description far better."

"How dare— I'll sue you for slander, Vivian Prescott!"

"Shouldn't Evelyn be the one filing lawsuits? Your daughter hired someone to destroy her reputation and frame her for kidnapping."

"You—"

Evelyn found it pointless to continue watching Eleanor defend Victoria.

The evidence was clear, yet Eleanor still chose to believe and protect her daughter.

People claimed to be rational, but emotions were inherently selfish—so selfish they could distort reality itself.

A bitter smile touched Evelyn's lips as she turned away, champagne flute in hand.

Night had fallen, the warm summer breeze caressing Evelyn's cheeks.

Wandering through the corridors, her gaze landed on a painfully familiar silhouette leaning against the balcony railing.

Alexander stood tall against the glass barrier, a wine glass dangling from his fingers. A half-empty bottle sat on the side table.

He raised the glass silently, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed the crimson liquid.

Another night breeze ruffled his chestnut hair.

In the darkness, Evelyn observed how melancholy seemed etched into his downturned eyes and furrowed brows.

'Drowning your regrets, Alexander?'

'Or perhaps finally seeing the truth?'

A quiet chuckle escaped Evelyn's lips.

Alexander's gaze lifted abruptly, as if he'd heard the sharp click of her heels.

"Drinking away your sorrows, Mr. Blackwood? Did tonight's revelations ruin your evening?" Evelyn asked casually, stepping closer. "You look like you could use company. Shall I join you?"

She swirled her champagne playfully, moving to clink glasses—only for Alexander to seize her wrist before contact.

She met his alcohol-glazed yet piercing stare with curiosity.

"Mr. Blackwood?"

"It's you." His voice was rough. "Evelyn."
###Chapter 209

Alexander's gaze darkened with unreadable emotions. His fingers tightened around Vivian's delicate wrist, refusing to let her slip away again.

He couldn't bear to release her this time. Not again. Not ever.

Vivian remained composed under Alexander's intense scrutiny.

A faint smirk played on her lips, revealing subtle irritation. "If I recall correctly, Mr. Blackwood, you gave me your word that you'd stop mistaking me for your late wife, Evelyn Sinclair."

His hopeful expression shattered instantly at her words. The grip on her wrist gradually loosened.

Vivian withdrew her hand gracefully, sipping her champagne. "Honestly, being constantly mistaken for a dead woman grows tiresome. If I weren't so pain-averse, I might actually consider facial reconstruction."

"Don't." Alexander's sharp command cut through the air.

"Hmm?" Vivian arched an elegant brow.

His features softened slightly. "My apologies. This won't happen again." His voice dropped lower. "You don't need surgery. Your natural beauty is perfection."

The compliment wasn't for her - but for the face identical to Evelyn's.

Turning toward the cityscape, Alexander absorbed the glittering skyline. Neon lights painted the night, yet the coldness in his eyes remained untouched.

"Miss Prescott, would you indulge me with some drinks?" His tone carried an unfamiliar vulnerability.

Vivian studied his silhouette - so imposing yet profoundly lonely.

She joined him at the railing, glass in hand. "While I detest being confused with a deceased woman, your late ex-wife seems unfairly maligned. The rumors painted her as heartless, but reality appears... different."

Her words masked years of buried anguish beneath casual humor.

Even now, vindication tasted bittersweet.

Alexander's brows knitted together as he absorbed her observation. The night breeze softened his sharp features when he finally spoke.

"What's your greatest regret, Miss Prescott?"

Vivian swirled her champagne thoughtfully. "A misguided marriage, perhaps. Youthful naivety made me trust the wrong man. He walks free while I bear the scars."

Alexander's lips twisted wryly. "A man foolish enough to betray someone like you?"

"The world brims with blind men, Mr. Blackwood. I'm hardly unique in my disappointment." Her laugh held no mirth.

He stared into his drink, silent for several heartbeats before chuckling darkly. "Indeed. The world overflows with blind fools."

Alexander's self-deprecating smile faded as he met her gaze. "At least your betrayer still breathes. You can rectify that regret, Miss Prescott."

His voice carried a hollowness she'd never heard before. The usual fire in his striking eyes had dimmed to embers.

His words revealed more than intended - an irreversible regret of his own.

Vivian drained her glass with practiced ease, masking her turmoil behind a light laugh.

'Alexander Blackwood, your regret stems from guilt, nothing more.'

'You never truly cared. More misunderstandings only deepen my wounds.'

'I don't need your remorse.'

'What I crave is justice - forcing you blind, cruel people to see Evelyn Sinclair's truth.'
###Chapter 210

The morning air carried a chill that seeped into Victoria's bones as she stood outside the Blackwood Estate gates. What was meant to be her triumphant day - the 50th anniversary celebration of the Blackwood dynasty - had turned into a nightmare thanks to Dominic Fletcher and Vivian Prescott's unexpected appearance.

Her perfectly manicured nails dug into her palms as she recalled the trending searches she'd begged Eleanor Kingsley to erase. Even with the digital evidence scrubbed clean, anxiety coiled in her stomach like a venomous snake.

Alexander hadn't returned her calls all night. Each attempt had met with the same infuriating busy signal. Had he blocked her? The possibility made her blood run cold.

At dawn, she'd stationed herself outside his mansion, careful not to cross the threshold uninvited. The grand iron gates felt like a barrier between her and everything she'd worked for.

Inside the estate, Alexander hadn't slept a wink.

Not since Evelyn Sinclair had turned to ashes in that terrible fire. Only the rare aromatherapy blends his father procured could grant him temporary respite - but last night, even those had failed.

Memories of Evelyn haunted him - those desperate, pleading eyes begging for his belief just once. Just one moment of faith in her.

He'd denied her every time.

When Dominic had accused Evelyn of being a gold-digging whore, Alexander had believed the lies without question. He'd watched the light die in her eyes piece by piece until nothing remained but cold ashes.

The pain in his chest was unbearable.

After splashing icy water on his swollen eyes, a servant informed him Victoria had been waiting outside for over an hour. He gave no response, instead instructing them to prepare Ethan for breakfast.

Seeing his son's face - so like his own at that age - suddenly filled him with revulsion. How could he have showered this illegitimate child with affection while treating his true heir with such cruelty?

The food turned to ash in his mouth. He pushed back from the table abruptly.

Ethan's wide, innocent eyes followed his father's retreating form. The boy didn't understand why his parents looked at him with such coldness. In his quiet moments, he dreamed of the kind woman who'd shown him warmth - Big Sister Vivian.

When Alexander finally opened the heavy oak doors, the gloomy sky mirrored his mood.

"Alexander!" Victoria's voice rang with false cheer. She'd planned this moment carefully - the perfect stumble after her "long vigil," the delicate twist of her ankle.

"Agh!" Her theatrical cry of pain went unanswered. Where Alexander would once have rushed to her side, now he stood immobile as a marble statue, his expression unreadable.

Pulling herself up with exaggerated effort, Victoria let tears spill down her cheeks. "Alexander... I know what Dominic said must have planted doubts in your mind. But I swear on my life - on Ethan's life - I've never conspired against Evelyn. If I'm lying, may I never see my precious boy again!"

Her performance would have moved mountains. But Alexander's face remained carved from stone as he stepped closer. His voice was dangerously quiet when he finally spoke.

"I have just one question for you."
###Chapter 211

Evelyn nodded earnestly. "Alexander, I swear I'll answer anything you ask with complete honesty."

"Good." Alexander's stormy gaze locked onto her. "Did you actually witness Dominic Fletcher and Vivian Prescott together?"

"Yes! I saw them with my own eyes!" The words tumbled from Evelyn's lips before she could reconsider.

The temperature in the room plummeted as Alexander's eyes darkened into bottomless voids.

Belongs to (N)?vel/Drama.Org.

Evelyn's pulse spiked when she felt the atmosphere shift dangerously. Still, she doubled down. "Alexander, every word is true! You have to believe me—"

"Believe you—"

He repeated the phrase with a mocking edge that made her stomach clench.

"She used those exact same words years ago, begging for my trust."

"What?" Evelyn's breath hitched at his icy expression. "Alexander—"

His lips parted just enough to deliver the verdict. "I gave you your chance." With that, he turned on his heel.

The dismissal couldn't have been clearer.

Abandoning her pretense of a sprained ankle, Evelyn lunged forward and wrapped her arms around his torso from behind.

"Alexander!"

She pressed her cheek desperately against his back.

"We've been together for years. You know me better than anyone! Why would I lie? Vivian was absolutely with Dominic! And Nathaniel Sterling! Even your uncle Sebastian! She's obsessed with seducing every man she—"

"Enough!"

Alexander's roar shook the walls as he whirled around, fury contorting his handsome features.

Evelyn snapped her mouth shut, trembling.

The suffocating silence stretched between them until she couldn't bear it.

She tightened her grip, but Alexander's command sliced through the tension. "Remove your hands."

Her eyes widened in betrayal. "No! I won't let go! I love you, Alexander. These meaningless people shouldn't come between us!"

Sobs wracked her body as she clung harder.

Then—finger by merciless finger—he pried her hands away until her arms hung empty at her sides.

"Alexander—" Tears streaked her cheeks as she searched his impassive face.

His next words turned her blood to ice. "If I discover you orchestrated Ethan's kidnapping, our engagement will be nullified."

The threat left her reeling.

Three years of engagement announcements. Countless society pages proclaiming their union. All of Willowbrook knew she was destined to be Mrs. Blackwood.

And now he dared suggest erasing it all?

Evelyn refused to accept this. She scrambled after him as he strode toward his car, gripping the half-lowered window.

"Alexander! Ethan is my flesh and blood! How could I possibly arrange my own son's kidnapping? That's insane!" Her knuckles whitened around the window frame as the engine roared to life.

Alexander accelerated without sparing her a glance.

She broke into a run, shouting explanations that dissolved into the wind as he rolled up the window and sped away.
###Chapter 212

"Alexander! Alexander, you must believe me! You can't judge me based on that lunatic Dominic's lies!"

Victoria's voice cracked with desperation as she chased after the retreating sports car.

"Have you forgotten our days by the ocean? You called me the purest soul you'd ever known! You promised to always protect me, to make me your wife! Alexander, please!"

For the first time, he hadn't even glanced her way.

The sleek vehicle disappeared around the corner, leaving Victoria seething on the sidewalk. Her manicured nails dug into her palms.

"Evelyn, you wretched creature! Why couldn't you stay dead?"

The slam of the mansion door echoed through the foyer. Little Ethan stood frozen by the staircase, his schoolbag slipping from his shoulder. Those familiar dark eyes - so like his father's - stared at her with unmistakable fear.

Her lip curled.

After dismissing the staff with a grocery errand, Victoria advanced on the child. The house fell eerily silent.

Ethan backed away until his small frame hit the wall.

"You..." Victoria's laughter turned sharp as she seized his wrist. "You're just like your pathetic mother."

The utility room door creaked ominously as she shoved him inside. The lock clicked.

Bang! Bang!

Small fists pounded against the wood.

"Quiet!" Victoria's stiletto kicked the doorframe. "I should've smothered you in that bitch Evelyn's womb!"

Her heels clicked away, leaving only choked sobs in the darkness.

Curled beneath the shelves, Ethan whispered into his knees: "Miss Vivian..." The name glowed like a candle in the blackness.

Victoria's phone glowed as she dialed. Dominic Fletcher had to disappear before Alexander dug deeper.

Dead women told no tales - but loose-lipped men? That was another matter entirely.

Across town, Evelyn set down her paintbrush. The portrait of Alexander Blackwood stared back with cruel perfection.

Each stroke carried years of love... and oceans of hate.

Her phone vibrated. The screen lit up with Olivia's contact photo.

"They're coming home?" Evelyn's laugh rang bright. "Amelia and I will meet them at the airport."

She hummed while cleaning her brushes. The doorbell's chime cut through her melody.

Through the peephole, Alexander's stormy expression filled the fisheye lens. His tie hung loose, shadows bruising his eyes.

Evelyn counted to ten before turning the knob.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Her voice pitched with manufactured surprise. "What brings you here?"

His gaze swept over her like a searchlight. "Miss Prescott. I require your assistance."
###Chapter 213

Evelyn gazed curiously into the stormy gray eyes before her. "What's wrong?"

"I need your help uncovering the truth," Alexander murmured, his deep voice laced with quiet desperation.

After listening to Alexander's unusual request, Evelyn's eyebrows lifted in surprise. She considered for a long moment before nodding slowly.

"Alright, I'll do it."

"Thank you." The gratitude in his voice was palpable.

For just a second, Evelyn thought she saw something flicker in Alexander's eyes - something warm and fleeting. She quickly dismissed the thought. The old Evelyn was gone forever.

Alexander escorted her to an exclusive salon. She watched as he showed a photograph to the stylist, who nodded in understanding.

Though Evelyn couldn't see the image, the transformation that followed left her breathless. An hour later, she barely recognized the woman in the mirror.

The sleek ebony hair framing her delicate features gave her an ethereal quality, as if she'd stepped out of another lifetime.

Next, Alexander took her to the Blackwood Estate.

Standing before the mansion that had once been their marital home, Evelyn felt a bitter smile twist her lips. The flood of emotions threatened to overwhelm her as she followed Alexander upstairs.

Three years.

Three years since she'd last set foot in this house, in the bedroom they'd once shared.

The familiar scent of sandalwood incense greeted her - a fragrance she'd created herself during happier days. Since her rebirth, Evelyn had discovered her heightened sense of smell had become both gift and curse.

She'd channeled this sensitivity into perfume creation, determined never to be that naive girl who'd sacrificed everything for love again.

Alexander led her to the walk-in closet. When he opened the doors, Evelyn's breath caught.

The perfectly preserved dresses from her past life hung undisturbed, as if waiting for her return. The entire room remained frozen in time.

"Miss Prescott, please choose something suitable to wear. I'll wait outside." With those words, Alexander exited, leaving her alone with her ghosts.

Evelyn trailed her fingers along the fabric, each garment awakening memories both sweet and painful. The delicate material felt foreign beneath her fingertips now - just as foreign as the scars that now marked her body.

'Alexander, no amount of atonement can erase what you did to me. I'll make sure you remember your sins for the rest of your life.'

"Mr. Blackwood, you may come in now."

Alexander stood motionless outside the door, lost in thought. At her call, he blinked back to awareness and entered.

Despite the gloomy weather outside, the room seemed to brighten when he saw Evelyn. The white sundress swayed gently as she turned, her dark hair cascading over one shoulder - the very image of his lost love.

The resemblance to their first meeting at university struck him painfully. That same radiant smile, that same innocent glow.

Evelyn...

His throat worked silently, swallowing her name unspoken.

She was dead.

Gone three years now.

This woman before him was merely an echo.

"Mr. Blackwood, do I look exactly like your late wife now?" Evelyn asked sweetly, her movements effortless and natural as she approached.

Alexander studied her carefully. "The resemblance is... uncanny."

His smile didn't reach his eyes. No matter how perfect the imitation, it would never be her.
###Chapter 214

It wasn't her after all.

"That's reassuring." Evelyn smiled with satisfaction. "I heard Mr. Blackwood despises Evelyn intensely. She's been gone for three years. Why would you still keep her old garments in your chambers?"

Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn's face. "How would you know these belonged to my former wife?"

Evelyn maintained her composed smile. "Isn't it rather obvious to deduce?"

At this rhetorical question, Alexander smirked. "Indeed."

Meanwhile, Victoria reached out to Dominic who had just been discharged from medical care.

Dominic had gained nothing from last night's venture - first terrified by a sudden 'ghost' appearance, then brutally beaten by Alexander until he lost a tooth. A complete double loss.

He'd rushed out of hospital upon learning dental implants cost tens of thousands. Where would a conman like him get that kind of money? Victoria's call felt like divine intervention.

Victoria exercised extreme caution, transferring nothing electronically to avoid Alexander tracing any transactions.

Disguised with a wig, sunglasses, and different attire, she arranged to meet Dominic at a secluded café.

Upon arrival, she slid across a thick envelope containing $100,000 in cash.

Dominic's eyes gleamed as he snatched the bills greedily. "Ms. Lancaster, rest assured! This isn't our first collaboration. Your business is my business!"

"About last night's drunken blunder... that woman you mentioned—"

"Vivian Prescott," Victoria snapped impatiently. "Remember this - Evelyn is dead! Three years gone! There's no such thing as ghosts in this world! Even if Evelyn's spirit crawled from hell, I'd send her back screaming!"

Dominic flinched at the word 'ghost'.

A guilty conscience needs no accuser.

"Keep silent about the kidnapping and this money's yours. I'll ensure you never starve again."

"Ms. Lancaster, my lips are sealed," Dominic assured, then added spitefully, "That Vivian Prescott dared frighten me? I'll show her what real terror feels like!"

Victoria smirked in approval.

Having Dominic deal with Vivian suited her perfectly.

She loathed that woman!

But the kidnapping remained priority - Alexander must never connect it to her.

As evening fell prematurely beneath the stormy skies...

Evelyn sat in Alexander's car, staking out Dominic's usual route home.

Nearly 10 PM when Dominic finally appeared.

He exited a cab, humming cheerfully.

Evelyn immediately slipped from the vehicle, positioning herself beneath a tree.

"Dominic," she called softly.

He froze mid-step, turning toward the voice.

Spotting the pale figure in the darkness, his face contorted in terror.

"Evelyn!"

Seeing Dominic's frightened reaction gave Evelyn grim satisfaction.

She knew this wasn't for Alexander - this was personal vengeance.

None who'd wronged her would escape justice.

Yet to her surprise, Dominic's fear morphed into something more sinister.

"Miss me, sweetheart?" he leered. "Come back to haunt me? Want to make amends? Next time give a man warning before popping up like that. Last night at Blackwood Enterprises' gala, you scared me into blabbing nonsense! Even got your dear sister Victoria in trouble."

His tone shifted unnaturally, fear replaced by vulgar confidence. The bruises on his face twisted his grin into something grotesque.

"God, I've missed you too. Let's relive old times, yeah? Especially that beauty mark on your chest - drives me wild!"

His words grew filthier, expression more depraved.

Evelyn trembled with rage at the man who'd once assaulted her, fists clenching.

"Since you're so eager, why not come upstairs? We'll get... reacquainted."

With that, Dominic lunged at her, hands outstretched!
###Chapter 215

Seeing Dominic charge toward her, Evelyn remembered every cruel thing he had done to her in the past.

She barely had time to react when a sudden gust of wind roared behind her.

Alexander's strong hands gripped her shoulders, pulling her aside in one swift motion.

The familiar scent of his cologne enveloped her. Before she could process what happened, she saw Dominic's fist connect with empty air before smashing into a tree trunk.

Alexander twisted Dominic's arm with brutal efficiency.

"Ahhh! Stop!" Dominic screamed, but Alexander showed no mercy. He delivered a vicious kick to Dominic's knee, forcing him to the ground before sending him sprawling with another kick.

Evelyn expected Alexander to continue his assault, but instead, he pulled her into a tight embrace.

"Don't be afraid," he murmured, his voice low and urgent. "I'm here now. No one will ever hurt you again."

His words flowed over her like warm honey, surprisingly gentle yet laced with tension. He held her as if she might disappear at any moment.

Evelyn blinked rapidly, feeling Alexander's arms tighten around her.

Rain began to fall, light at first, then heavier. The summer breeze carried an unexpected chill.

Yet the heat radiating from Alexander's chest burned through their clothes, searing her skin.

Pressed this close, she couldn't tell whose heartbeat was louder - his or hers.

Just as she started losing herself in the moment, phantom pains from old wounds brought her back to reality. "Mr. Blackwood," she said softly but firmly, "if you don't let go, I'll have to make you."

Alexander froze as if waking from a dream.

"Forgive me," he whispered near her ear before releasing her.

He grabbed Dominic, who had been trying to crawl away, and slammed him against the tree. His dark eyes burned with deadly intensity.

"One chance," Alexander growled. "Who really kidnapped my son? And why?"

Dominic's swollen lips twisted into a sneer as he pointed at Evelyn. "Her! It was Evelyn! She paid me to take your boy!" He completely contradicted his statement from last night's dinner.

Clearly, someone had gotten to him first.

Alexander's arm pressed against Dominic's throat. "Choose carefully - do you value money or your life?"

Dominic's eyes widened in terror. "I-I swear it's true! That witch Evelyn planned everything!" He spat blood as he continued, "You think coming back as a ghost scares me? A gold-digging whore like you deserved to die—"

CRACK!

Alexander's fist connected with Dominic's face before he could finish.

Dark fury transformed Alexander's features. He rained blows on Dominic with terrifying precision.

Dominic's screams filled the air as blood poured from his mouth and nose.

By the time Alexander stopped, Dominic barely resembled a human being.

Evelyn enjoyed watching Dominic suffer, but if Alexander killed him now, Victoria would remain free.

She grabbed Alexander's raised fist. "Any more and you'll kill him."

Alexander froze mid-swing. His eyes burned with barely restrained violence, his breathing ragged.

Blood coated his knuckles - whether his own or Dominic's was unclear.

Without Evelyn's intervention, he might have beaten Dominic to death.

The drive back to Evelyn's apartment passed in heavy silence. The air between them crackled with unspoken tension.

They'd gone to confront Dominic for answers about Ethan's kidnapping. But someone had clearly gotten to him first.
###Chapter 216

The one who had sought out Dominic must have been Victoria.

Evelyn knew this with absolute certainty, but she doubted Alexander had the same clarity.

He had always been blindly devoted to Victoria.

His repeated indulgence of her actions had caused Evelyn immeasurable pain in the past.

Yet if he truly intended to protect Victoria, why go through the trouble of asking Evelyn to play her former self to extract the truth from Dominic?

Evelyn expected Alexander to leave immediately, but instead, he followed her all the way to her apartment door.

"May I come in for a while?" Alexander's voice was soft, almost hesitant.

It was late at night. Evelyn wanted to refuse, but her gaze lingered on his bleeding hand. She sighed and opened the door. "Fine. Come in."

She told herself it wasn't pity—just curiosity about what he might reveal.

Evelyn fetched the first aid kit. Alexander sat motionless on the sofa, his expression unreadable.

His hands rested limply in his lap as he sank deeper into the cushions. A shadow of melancholy darkened his features, making him look utterly defeated.

Without a word, Evelyn took out the antiseptic wipes and carefully cleaned the wound on his knuckles before wrapping it in gauze.

"I never believed in her."

The sudden statement caught Evelyn off guard.

Her fingers stilled briefly before she resumed her task, her voice calm. "Mr. Blackwood, who exactly are you referring to?"

Alexander let out a low, bitter chuckle, as if speaking to himself. "I never imagined she'd go this far. All this time, I trusted her completely."

Evelyn understood—his first words had been about her, the woman she used to be. Now, he was talking about Victoria.

Oh, Alexander, you have no idea. What you've uncovered is barely a fraction of Victoria's deceit.

She met his gaze evenly. "Are you saying you already knew the truth about your ex-wife's involvement in your son's kidnapping? You just didn't want to accept it, did you?"

Alexander stiffened at her question.

His striking eyes clouded over, studying her with an intensity that made her pulse quicken. The silence stretched between them, heavy with unspoken emotions.

After a long pause, he lifted his hand, his fingertips brushing lightly against her cheek. His Adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed hard.

"I'm sorry."

The words were rough, barely audible, but they struck Evelyn like a physical blow.

Her carefully maintained composure faltered. For a fleeting moment, she thought she saw something raw and vulnerable in his eyes.

Then, without warning, he pulled her into his arms, holding her so tightly she could barely breathe. His warmth enveloped her, his breath hot against her ear.

"I'm sorry," he repeated, his voice breaking.

Evelyn's hands hung at her sides, frozen. Her heart pounded erratically.

Was this apology for her—the woman she was now? Or for the woman she had once been?

The sharp click of the door unlocking shattered the moment.

Evelyn jerked back to reality, pushing Alexander away as the door swung open.

"You should leave, Mr. Blackwood," she said coolly. "My fiancé is here."
###Chapter 217

As Evelyn's voice faded, Alexander's arms suddenly felt hollow.

An overwhelming loneliness surged through his chest. It was as if he'd just returned from wandering lost in the wilderness.

Staring at the face before him, Alexander realized he'd lost control moments ago.

He'd exposed his darkest, most vulnerable side - a side no one had ever seen. Worse, he'd desperately craved her embrace, longed for her pity and comfort.

This was unprecedented behavior.

Yet he knew exactly why - this face.

This face that mirrored hers so perfectly.

"I thought you were arriving tomorrow?" Evelyn's cheerful voice snapped Alexander back to reality. "What brought you back so suddenly?"

Only then did he recall her earlier words. 'My fiancé is here.'

Fiancé?

"Is there company?" A male voice called from the doorway.

Alexander's brow furrowed. Though not intimately familiar, he recognized that voice instantly.

If this man truly was Vivian's fiancé, the revelation would be shocking.

"Alexander, is that you?"

As Alexander lifted his gaze, the voice spoke again.

Sebastian Whitman strode in, his tailored black suit slightly damp from the evening rain. The droplets on his shoulders did nothing to diminish his aristocratic elegance.

Their dark eyes locked in silent confrontation.

Alexander's gaze, usually calm as still waters, now churned with dangerous undercurrents. An invisible tension crackled between them.

"You?" Alexander rose slowly.

Evelyn smiled faintly and moved to Sebastian's side, linking arms with natural affection.

"Mr. Blackwood, this is my fiancé, Sebastian Whitman."

Her introduction complete, she turned questioning eyes to Sebastian's composed face. "You called him Alexander... Do you know each other? Wait - you share the same surname..."

"Alexander is the nephew I've mentioned," Sebastian answered smoothly, his voice as soothing as the night rain outside.

Evelyn's eyes widened in surprise before breaking into a smile. "So Mr. Blackwood is your nephew." She laughed lightly. "He's been my only friend since coming to Willowbrook."

"What a coincidence," Sebastian murmured, his gentle gaze never leaving Alexander's stony face. "Alexander, thank you for looking after Vivian."

A low chuckle broke the tense silence.

Alexander stepped forward. Both men stood over six feet tall, equally matched in stature and presence.

Yet where Alexander radiated raw intensity, Sebastian exuded refined elegance.

Alexander's piercing gaze flickered between them before settling on Evelyn's delicate features. "Is he really your fiancé?"

Evelyn nodded without hesitation. "Of course. Why would I lie?"

Alexander's lips curled into a sardonic smile. "So a woman who looks exactly like my ex-wife is about to become my aunt?"

"Alexander." Sebastian's calm interruption sliced through the tension. "Vivian and Evelyn may resemble each other, but they're different people. Don't confuse them."

"Hard not to when the resemblance is uncanny," Alexander countered, his amused gaze never leaving Evelyn.

He stepped closer suddenly, his warm breath brushing her ear as he whispered, "I find myself eagerly anticipating our next meeting... Miss Prescott."

Evelyn's grip on Sebastian's arm tightened imperceptibly.

Sebastian covered her hand with his own. "Don't worry," he soothed, his voice steady as always.

Alexander departed soon after, leaving behind only the echo of his presence.

Only when the door clicked shut did Evelyn finally exhale, her shoulders relaxing their rigid posture.

She withdrew her hand from Sebastian's arm. Meeting his gentle gaze, her anxiety melted away.

"I'm so glad you're back," she breathed, eyes shining with gratitude.

Sebastian reached up, tucking a stray lock of hair behind her ear with effortless grace. "I've been following the news. You've performed brilliantly."
###Chapter 218

Evelyn shook her head. "I still didn't handle it well enough. Otherwise, he wouldn't keep suspecting me of being his damned ex-wife over and over."

Bitterness laced her words, but she quickly forced a faint smile for Sebastian.

"Don't worry about me. I'm not that naive and foolish Evelyn Sinclair anymore. I won't waste the second chance you've given me."

Sebastian's lips curled slightly. His bright, enigmatic eyes held a depth that was impossible to decipher.

Evelyn helped him remove his rain-dampened coat and fetched fresh toiletries for him.

After his shower, he emerged in a white bathrobe, towel-drying his damp hair. He walked into Evelyn's room as if it were his own, bending down to press a tender kiss to Amelia's sleeping cheek.

"Sebastian, the guest room is ready," Evelyn murmured as she entered.

He turned toward her. "I'll be returning to Blackwood Estate in two days. You're coming with me."

"Alright," Evelyn agreed with a nod.

"Rest well. Goodnight." Sebastian lowered his head, brushing his cool lips briefly against her forehead before stepping out and closing the door behind him.

Evelyn stood frozen, emotions tangled in her chest.

She wasn't blind. Sebastian's unwavering support stemmed from something deeper than mere kindness.

Especially after Victoria had framed her six years ago—back then, he had secretly provided evidence to clear her name.

He had been watching over her long before she even realized it.

Yet in the three years she had spent with him, she couldn't shake the feeling that he was shrouded in mystery. Unpredictable.

A gentleman, yes—but one with secrets.

Evelyn shook her head, forcing the thoughts away.

Meanwhile, Alexander remained in his car long after the lights in Evelyn's apartment dimmed.

"Sebastian Whitman."

The name left his lips like a curse.

The way Sebastian had always been attuned to Evelyn's every move—it gnawed at him.

"No."

He abruptly dismissed the thought, remembering Evelyn on that operating table, lifeless.

No pulse. No breath. She had been pronounced dead.

Yet if Vivian Prescott was truly just Vivian, why did she stir such suspicion? Her closeness to Sebastian only fueled his doubts.

Her mannerisms, her speech—they all screamed Evelyn.

Alexander's fingers traced the freshly bandaged wound on his arm, as if he could still feel the ghost of her touch.

His gaze softened.

Evelyn, I'd rather it be you.

Even if you despise me, even if you never forgive me—

Just be alive.

As long as you're in this world, I'll follow wherever you go.

The next morning, Evelyn rose early to prepare breakfast for Amelia. Noticing Sebastian still resting, she quietly closed the door and took Amelia to kindergarten.

As she turned to leave, Alexander's car pulled up in front of her.

"Mr. Blackwood?" She kept her tone neutral.

He stepped out and opened the passenger door. "Future Aunt-in-law, care to join me?"

The title made her stiffen, but she masked it smoothly and slid into the car.

They drove through the bustling streets before stopping at a busy intersection.

"There's a breakfast spot here with the best pastries in town," Alexander said, opening her door.

Had he brought her here just to eat?

Evelyn hesitated, stepping out. Amid the crowd of rushing office workers, a familiar figure suddenly caught her eye.

Her breath hitched.

"Ev—Evelyn?!"
###Chapter 219

A voice cut through the morning crowd, startlingly familiar.

Evelyn's pulse spiked instantly, though her expression remained perfectly composed. She continued walking toward Alexander with measured steps, betraying nothing.

"Mr. Blackwood, was breakfast your true motive for bringing me here?" Her lips curved into a practiced smile as morning light danced across her flawless features.

Alexander's gaze flickered toward the source of the disturbance before responding. "Would my future aunt show such restraint in public? Or are you concerned about Uncle Sebastian's jealousy?"

"Why would Sebastian care about something so trivial?" Evelyn's voice stayed even, though her heart hammered against her ribs.

That voice kept calling - "Evie!" - growing louder with each repetition.

Footsteps quickened behind her, but she kept pace with Alexander toward the café entrance.

"Evie!"

Just as Evelyn's foot crossed the threshold, a hand seized her wrist with desperate strength.

"Evie! It's really you!" Olivia trembled, tears ruining her carefully applied makeup as they streamed down her cheeks. Her grip tightened as if fearing Evelyn might vanish.

"Evie?" Evelyn arched one perfect brow. "You must be mistaking me for Evelyn Sinclair. Another case of mistaken identity?"

Olivia's tear-filled eyes widened in shock. "What do you mean 'mistaken'? Evie, what's happened? Why are you here with him of all people?"

Questions tumbled out between sobs, overwhelmed by the sheer impossibility of this reunion.

She threw her arms around Evelyn, feeling the solid warmth of her best friend's body after all these years. "You're alive," Olivia choked out. "Thank God you're alive!"

Then her expression darkened as she glared at Alexander. "Evie, why are you with this monster? He and Victoria nearly killed you! Come away with me now - don't stay another second with him!"

Olivia tugged at Evelyn's hand, but met unexpected resistance.

"You're mistaken," Evelyn said coolly, extracting her hand. "I'm not Evelyn Sinclair."

She produced a business card with practiced ease. "Vivian Prescott. Perhaps this will clarify your confusion."

Olivia stared at the embossed letters as if they might rearrange themselves. "This isn't funny, Evie. Look at me - your face, your smile, even that little dimple. How can you pretend you're someone else?"

Her voice cracked. "Has he done something to you? Taken your memories? It's me, Liv! Your best friend!"

Evelyn's smile remained politely distant. "I'm afraid I don't know you, Miss Bennett. And I'd appreciate if you stopped insulting Mr. Blackwood. Being mistaken for a dead woman grows tiresome."

The hope in Olivia's eyes dimmed with each indifferent word. She searched Evelyn's face frantically for any flicker of recognition, finding none.

"Evie... how can you say that? After everything we've been through?" Her voice dropped to a whisper. "I watched them lower your empty casket."

Evelyn turned away with finality. "Mr. Blackwood, my appetite has vanished. Would you mind taking me home?"

"Of course." Alexander offered his arm.

"Evie! Wait!" Olivia lunged forward, only to be blocked by Alexander's imposing frame. "What have you done to her, you bastard? She wouldn't act like this unless you'd done something!"

Evelyn didn't look back as Alexander guided her to the waiting car, leaving Olivia standing alone on the sidewalk, clutching a business card that felt like a betrayal.
###Chapter 220

Alexander let out a low, mocking chuckle, his piercing gaze following Evelyn's retreating figure. "You honestly believe that's Evelyn?"

"Don't be ridiculous! Of course it's her!" Olivia snapped without hesitation. "Alexander, I'm warning you - if you hurt Evelyn again, I'll make sure you regret it this time!"

Hearing Olivia's fierce declaration, Alexander's lips twisted into a bitter smile.

A friend willing to go to war for her.

But what about her husband?

Alexander remained silent, sliding into the driver's seat and starting the engine.

Evelyn sat stiffly in the passenger seat, watching Olivia's distressed form shrink in the side mirror until her heart ached with each passing second.

'I'm so sorry, Olivia.'

'Now isn't the time.'

'I'll beg for your forgiveness once everything is over.'

As the car approached an intersection, Evelyn suddenly spoke. "Pull over."

Alexander shot her a questioning look but saw only determination in her expression.

The moment the car stopped, Evelyn flung the door open.

Alexander's expression darkened. He lunged after her, fingers closing around her slender wrist. "Where do you think you're going?"

Evelyn turned with an irritated glare. "I saved your precious reputation back there, Mr. Blackwood. But I'm getting tired of your little games. We both know you weren't taking me to breakfast - you just wanted to see if Olivia would recognize me."

She tilted her chin defiantly. "Am I wrong?"

"No." Alexander's grip tightened as he studied her face. "You look exactly like my late wife. That alone would be coincidence enough, but you're also Sebastian's fiancée. You'll forgive me for being suspicious."

Evelyn laughed coldly. "The world works in mysterious ways, Mr. Blackwood. After all, didn't you cheat on your wife and drive her to her death? Compared to that, what's impossible?"

Alexander's eyes darkened dangerously.

The face was identical.

But the woman before him was nothing like the timid, insecure Evelyn he'd known.

This woman's gaze burned with intelligence and defiance, her words sharp as daggers.

"Let me go." Evelyn glanced pointedly at her trapped wrist.

Instead of releasing her, Alexander yanked her against his chest.

The familiar scent of his cologne enveloped her, triggering a flood of memories.

Evelyn stiffened. "What are you doing?"

Alexander smirked. "So I'm the villain in your story, Miss Prescott?"

His lips curved into a dangerous smile. "If that's how you see me, you'd better be careful. I do enjoy breaking rules... especially with my future aunt."

Evelyn shoved him away angrily, storming across the street to escape.

She'd taken only three steps when a blaring horn shattered the air.

Evelyn froze.

A speeding car barreled toward her.

Alexander's heart stopped.

"Evelyn—!"
###Chapter 221

Just as the traffic light was about to change, Alexander suddenly reached out and seized Evelyn's wrist, yanking her forcefully into his protective embrace.

A speeding car tore through the intersection, missing Evelyn by mere inches.

The momentum sent Alexander stumbling backward. His arms tightened around Evelyn as they both crashed onto the pavement.

"Don't be scared. You're safe now."

Alexander's deep voice vibrated against Evelyn's ear.

She tried to rise but found herself trapped in his iron grip. His right hand cradled the back of her head instinctively, shielding her from further harm.

Evelyn lay sprawled across Alexander's chest. His distinctive cologne - that achingly familiar scent from her memories - filled her senses.

Her pulse raced erratically. She couldn't tell if it was from the near-accident or their sudden proximity.

A cool breeze snapped her back to reality. "Mr. Blackwood, you can release me now."

Alexander seemed to awaken from a trance. His grip loosened gradually as he recalled how he'd called her 'Evelyn' moments earlier.

"Thank you, Mr. Blackwood." Evelyn stood, brushing off her clothes.

Alexander rose beside her. Seeing her unharmed sent an unexpected wave of relief through him.

Evelyn was about to make her escape when she noticed fresh blood seeping through Alexander's bandaged palm.

She retrieved antiseptic wipes from her purse. Taking his hand gently, she cleaned the reopened wound before wrapping it carefully with her handkerchief.

Alexander remained motionless, watching Evelyn's focused expression. Her delicate brows furrowed in concentration. Each flutter of her lashes felt like feathers brushing against his heart.

His pulse quickened inexplicably.

"Thank you for earlier. I must go now." Evelyn released his hand and turned away.

"Let me drive you."

"No need." She paused, meeting his gaze. "I'd rather not be mistaken for a ghost again."

Without waiting for a response, Evelyn hailed a passing taxi.

Alexander stood rooted as the car disappeared. He examined the handkerchief now covering his wound.

His phone buzzed with Victoria's call.

Alexander's jaw tightened at her name. After a brief hesitation, he answered.

"Alexander! You're finally taking my calls!" Victoria's voice wavered between excitement and distress.

"I know you still suspect me about Ethan's kidnapping. I don't blame you for doubting me."

"Can we meet? There's something important I need to tell you."

She continued her monologue, growing increasingly anxious at his silence.

"Alexander, I swear I've done nothing wrong. Ethan is our son - how could I possibly-"

"Not today," Alexander interrupted coldly. "Bring your parents to Blackwood Estate tomorrow evening. All of you. I have an announcement."

Victoria's breath hitched. After weeks of being ignored, this sudden invitation sent her heart soaring.

"With my parents? Really?" Her voice trembled with hope.

This had to be about their wedding!

"Yes," Alexander confirmed before ending the call.
###Chapter 222

"Don't worry, Alexander. I'll arrive punctually tomorrow evening with my parents," Victoria agreed with barely concealed impatience.

"Excellent." Alexander ended the call with those two clipped words.

He stared at the darkened screen, his piercing emerald eyes glinting with something unreadable.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had returned directly to the penthouse. As she stepped inside, she found Sebastian already awake.

He sat by the floor-to-ceiling windows, dressed in casual linen attire. His attention was divided between the financial news on his tablet and the croissant he was eating with refined elegance.

Noticing Evelyn's return, he flashed her a warm smile. "Lady Belle's latest collection is breaking sales records. Every piece you've designed has become an instant classic. At this rate, you're practically guaranteed to win the GMA International Jewelry Design Award this year."

He gestured to a package on the counter. "I also procured those rare fragrance ingredients you needed. You can pursue both your passions here without any limitations."

Evelyn felt a surge of gratitude. "Thank you, Sebastian."

His mysterious eyes twinkled. "Gratitude isn't what I seek from you." His voice carried the gentle warmth of a summer breeze.

When Evelyn hesitated, Sebastian chuckled softly. "Relax, I'd never pressure you. Being your steadfast companion is privilege enough."

That familiar smile of his never failed to dispel the shadows in Evelyn's heart.

Had it not been for Sebastian's unwavering support these past three years, she wouldn't be standing here today.

The following evening...

Evelyn accompanied Sebastian to Blackwood Estate. He entered the lavish grounds with a gift in one hand and Evelyn's fingers entwined with his other.

Recognizing Sebastian immediately, the butler hurried to inform Henry Blackwood.

The elderly patriarch, resting in his chambers, felt his muscles tense at the news.

Sebastian had returned to the estate three years prior but had avoided meeting Henry under the pretense of illness. That couldn't happen again.

Evelyn had been eager to meet Henry Blackwood. What she hadn't anticipated was walking into the grand parlor to find Eleanor Kingsley and Victoria engaged in animated conversation with Margaret Blackwood, while William Montgomery spoke quietly with Alexander's father near the fireplace.

'What's happening today? Why is everyone here?'

The moment Evelyn and Sebastian entered hand-in-hand, the room fell into stunned silence.

Alexander descended the staircase just in time to see their interlaced fingers. His gaze darkened.

"Aren't you Alexander's uncle, Sebastian?" Victoria's voice dripped with suspicion. "Uncle Sebastian, why are you with this woman?"

"Mind your tone, Miss Lancaster." Though typically the epitome of gentility, Sebastian's voice now carried an edge Evelyn had rarely heard. "Vivian is my fiancée."

"Your fiancée?" Margaret Blackwood shot to her feet with a derisive laugh. "Sebastian, your taste in women never fails to astonish."

Sebastian's lips curved into a knowing smile. "Vivian is the most extraordinary woman I've ever known. Having her as my wife would be my life's greatest honor."

Margaret opened her mouth but found no retort.

Evelyn felt heat rise to her cheeks at Sebastian's unexpected public declaration.

When she glanced up, she accidentally locked eyes with Alexander, whose intense gaze burned into her.

"Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn greeted calmly.

Victoria immediately turned, spotting Alexander's approach. She rushed to his side, shooting Evelyn a venomous look. "Alexander, who would've guessed the boyfriend Miss Prescott mentioned was your uncle Sebastian? Isn't this fate? They seem perfectly matched, don't you think?"

Alexander barely glanced at Victoria's simpering face before striding purposefully toward Evelyn, one hand sliding into his pocket.

"Alexander?" Victoria's smile vanished.

Ignoring everyone else completely, Alexander stopped directly before Evelyn.

His lips curved into a dangerous smile as his hand moved within his pocket, as if retrieving something.
###Chapter 223

Under the bewildered stares of everyone present, Alexander retrieved a midnight blue velvet box from his trouser pocket.

He turned toward Evelyn and flipped open the lid, revealing a dazzling diamond ring nestled inside.

Victoria's breath hitched at the sight. She rushed forward, forcing a smile. "Alexander, what—what are you doing?" Her voice trembled slightly. "You invited my parents here today. Is this... a proposal? That ring is for me, isn't it?"

Her hopeful gaze clung to Alexander's impassive profile.

But Alexander didn’t spare her so much as a glance. Instead, he plucked the ring from its cushion and reached for Evelyn’s left hand—the one Sebastian was holding.

Evelyn jerked her hand back. "Mr. Blackwood, what is the meaning of this?"

Sebastian stepped protectively in front of her. "Alexander, though Vivian bears a resemblance to Evelyn, I’ve made it clear—they are not the same person."

"Why so defensive?" Alexander chuckled, his smile unreadable. "This is merely a small gift for my future aunt."

Evelyn’s lips curved politely. "Thank you, Mr. Blackwood, but a diamond ring isn’t an appropriate gift. Your fiancée might take offense." She glanced pointedly at Victoria, whose smile had twisted into something ugly.

"Victoria wouldn’t mind!" Margaret Blackwood scoffed, shooting Evelyn a disdainful look. "Miss Prescott, though you resemble that wretched Evelyn Sinclair, don’t flatter yourself into thinking Alexander has any special interest in you!"

Her lips curled in contempt.

"That woman was a thorn in our family’s side! Alexander despised her! After her death, we finally had peace, and he could be with the woman he truly loves. We’re all much happier now, so rest assured—my future daughter-in-law has no reason to be jealous. Alexander and Victoria are deeply in love! Their son is already five!"

Victoria quickly smoothed her expression, chiming in sweetly, "Miss Prescott, did you hear that? Why would I be jealous? It’s just a little gift—no need to make a scene. Mrs. Blackwood is right. It doesn’t matter if you look like Evelyn. Alexander would never be interested in you—he hated her more than anyone!"

"Is that so?" Evelyn’s smile was faint, but inside, bitterness coiled tight.

So my death was exactly what they all wanted.

Not a single one of them mourned me.

They celebrated it.

She had been a terrible wife, a disappointing daughter-in-law—yet she had never harmed a soul. And this was her reward.

If not for the warmth of Sebastian’s hand anchoring hers, she might have shattered.

"Alexander, I appreciate the gesture on Vivian’s behalf," Sebastian interjected smoothly, "but a diamond ring is better suited as a gift from her fiancé." He took Evelyn’s hand and led her toward the grand hall.

Victoria glared at Evelyn’s retreating figure before turning back to Alexander, her voice sugary. "Alexander, that ring is exquisite. I adore it."

Her meaning was clear—With my parents here, isn’t it time to announce our wedding?

Alexander studied the ring, then pocketed it with a faint smile. His gaze flicked to Evelyn. "Before I make any announcements, there’s something I need to confirm."

"What is it?" Victoria pressed eagerly.

"You’ll find out soon enough." He strode toward the living room without another word.

Victoria hurried after him.

At that moment, Henry Blackwood descended the staircase. He had witnessed the entire exchange from the second-floor landing.

Sebastian looked up at the sound of footsteps.

When his eyes met Henry’s aged face, there was no warmth in his gaze—only cool detachment.

Yet Henry’s lips twitched into a faint smile. "Sebastian, it’s been years. You seem to have done well for yourself."

"Thanks to you, Great Uncle, my ventures have flourished these past years." Sebastian’s voice was polite but distant. His fingers tightened around Evelyn’s. "And soon, I’ll be married."

Henry nodded, his sharp eyes assessing Evelyn. "For a moment, I truly thought it was Evelyn. What a pity..."

His gaze swept over the gathered guests. "Why is everyone here?"

"Grandfather," Victoria interjected brightly, "Alexander asked me to bring my parents! He said he has an important announcement!"

"An announcement? Regarding what?" Henry frowned at Alexander.

"It must be about their wedding!" Margaret declared with a knowing smile. "They’ve waited long enough. The date should have been set ages ago!"

Eleanor and William exchanged pleased glances. "They should have married years ago. Their son is practically grown! Alexander, we trust you’ll take good care of our precious daughter."
###Chapter 224

Victoria's cheeks flushed pink as she nestled affectionately against Alexander's arm. "Don't worry, Mother, Father. Alexander will take perfect care of me, won't you, darling?"

She lifted her sparkling gaze to meet his, only to freeze at the glacial coldness in his eyes.

"A-Alexander?"

"What I'm announcing is the termination of our engagement."

Silence.

"What?"

Victoria turned to stone. Eleanor, William, and Alexander's parents all gasped in shock.

Evelyn maintained her composure, though surprise flickered through her.

Was Alexander actually calling off his engagement to Victoria?

This was earth-shattering.

He'd worshipped the two-faced Victoria for years, spoiling her beyond reason.

How could he make such a decision now?

"Alexander! Have you lost your mind?" Eleanor shrieked. "Victoria bore your child! How can you discard her?" Her finger jabbed toward Evelyn. "Is this because of her?"

Alexander's brows furrowed in displeasure. "She has nothing to do with this."

His piercing gaze locked onto Victoria. "Remember what I told you that morning?"

Victoria's face stiffened as she recalled his words: 'If I discover you were involved in Ethan's kidnapping, our engagement ends immediately.'

Her complexion drained to sheet-white. "Alexander, you still doubt me? Ethan is my son! Why would I conspire with outsiders to kidnap him? What possible motive could I have?"

"To frame Evelyn," Alexander stated calmly. "To make me despise her."

Victoria recoiled. "Alexander, I-I never! You can't believe Dominic's lies over me! After all these years together—"

"This has nothing to do with Dominic's testimony."

Victoria blinked in confusion. Then how...?

"I found the driver from that day."

Victoria's mouth went dry. The driver!

She'd completely forgotten about him!

Seeing her reaction, Alexander's expression darkened with disappointment. "He confessed everything. How he drugged Evelyn, returned her to the dormitory, then delivered Ethan to Dominic per your instructions. Everything unfolded exactly as you planned."

"No! The driver's lying! I would never—" Victoria babbled in panic.

Alexander's eyes turned arctic. "Still denying it? Shall I bring him here to repeat his confession to your face?"

"Bring him! I'll never believe Victoria would do such things! This is all Evelyn's fabrication!" Eleanor declared.

Alexander smiled coldly and reached for his phone. "Very well. I'll summon him immediately."

"Alexander!" Victoria suddenly cried, tears streaming. "I only did it because I love you too much! I couldn't bear seeing Evelyn cling to you! I lost my head for a moment—please forgive me!"

To everyone's shock, Victoria had confessed.

Eleanor and William gaped at their weeping daughter.

"Alexander, I was wrong! Please don't end our engagement! I beg you!" Victoria sobbed at his feet.
###Chapter 225

Alexander gazed down at Victoria, the woman he once vowed to protect forever, and a sardonic smirk twisted his lips.

"I never even located the driver."

Silence.

No one expected Alexander to drop this bombshell.

The air in the grand hall turned frigid. Evelyn's eyes widened, her breath catching in her throat.

She stared at Alexander's devastatingly handsome face—now etched with disdain and mockery.

He had played her.

Out of sheer terror, she had confessed to framing Evelyn with Dominic.

Evelyn sat quietly, but her heart was anything but calm.

Just yesterday, Alexander had instructed her to dress like her old self to trap Dominic—but that plan had failed.

She had assumed there was no evidence left to expose Victoria's crimes.

Yet here he was, manipulating Victoria into a confession.

Her pulse thundered.

She couldn’t decipher the storm of emotions inside her.

Sebastian reached over, his fingers gently entwining with hers.

Their eyes met. No words were needed.

"It was you!" Henry Blackwood's cane trembled as he pointed at Victoria, fury darkening his aged features. "You conspired with an outsider to kidnap your own child and pin it on Evelyn? You—you vile creature!"

His hands shook with rage. He raised his cane, ready to strike.

Eleanor rushed forward, blocking him. "Henry, stop! Victoria must have had her reasons!"

Reasons?

Evelyn's heart sank further.

She had once hoped that when the truth came out, she might soften—might yearn for her parents' embrace again.

But Eleanor's blind defense shattered that fragile hope.

Tears streamed down Victoria's face as she clutched Alexander's arm. "Alexander, I never wanted to hurt Ethan! He's my son—my flesh and blood! How could I?"

Her gaze flicked to Evelyn, venom lacing her next words. "It was Evelyn! She forced me!"

Evelyn's lips curled into a humorless smile.

Forced her?

She couldn’t fathom how.

Victoria sobbed dramatically. "Evelyn tormented me relentlessly—even hurt Ethan! I endured it, but she pushed me too far!"

Her voice cracked. "Every time I think of our first child—the one she murdered—my heart shatters all over again! Dominic preyed on my grief. He manipulated me!"

The hall was dead silent except for her wails.

"Victoria, darling, don’t cry." Eleanor embraced her, stroking her hair.

William stepped forward, patting her shoulder. "You all heard her. Evelyn drove her to this. If anyone’s to blame, it’s Evelyn!"

Each word was another dagger in Evelyn’s chest.

Her heart splintered, the shards cutting deeper with every breath.

Margaret Blackwood stood firmly beside Victoria. "Henry, she’s right. Evelyn brought this upon herself. She killed their first child—everything after was karma!"

"You’re all delusional!" Henry roared. "How can you defend her after what she’s done?"

Margaret scoffed. "A saint would snap if pushed too far! Evelyn tortured Victoria for years—this was self-defense!"

She turned to Alexander, her voice icy. "Alexander, Victoria isn’t at fault. Cancel the engagement? Don’t be absurd. All of Willowbrook witnessed your betrothal."

Victoria lifted tearful eyes to him. "Alexander, forgive me. Let’s move forward, please?"

Alexander’s voice was glacial. "I wasn’t joking."
###Chapter 226

Victoria's face drained of color as if all strength had left her body.

Alexander was serious.

"Alexander, how could you?" Eleanor stepped forward, her voice sharp with indignation. "Victoria has been by your side for years. She gave you a son—Ethan is five years old now! For five years, she's endured being called the other woman. And now, because of that wretched Evelyn, you're casting her aside?"

Alexander's jaw tightened, his dark eyes flashing with restrained fury.

He hated hearing Evelyn referred to with such venom.

"Enough!" Henry Blackwood's voice cut through the room like a whip. "Mrs. Kingsley, though Victoria is your long-lost daughter, that doesn't give you the right to speak of Evelyn that way! She was raised by parents too—parents who would be devastated to know the suffering she endured!"

His chest rose with a heavy sigh.

"That poor girl, Evelyn… even in death, she bears the weight of false accusations."

Shaking his head, he turned and slowly made his way upstairs.

Evelyn pressed her lips together, a bitter ache swelling in her chest.

Grandpa…

Thank you for defending me.

But as she glanced at Eleanor and William, their blind devotion to Victoria twisted the knife deeper.

The room fell into silence, broken only by Alexander's icy tone. "I won't fight for Ethan's custody. Given the circumstances, you should reflect on your own mistakes."

Without another word, he turned and walked away. Evelyn watched his retreating figure, struck by the unexpected loneliness in his posture.

"Alexander! Alexander, where are you going?" Victoria chased after him, but moments later, the roar of his car engine echoed through the estate.

Clenching her fists, Victoria stared at the empty driveway, her heart burning with fury.

She had thought tonight would be about setting their wedding date. Instead, it had become their last supper.

No.

She refused to accept this.

She would never surrender her place as the future Mrs. Blackwood.

Not like this.

As soon as Alexander left, Sebastian guided Evelyn out.

Settling into the passenger seat, Evelyn exhaled shakily.

Sebastian reached over, taking her cold hands in his. "You're freezing. Was it what Eleanor and William said?"

Evelyn managed a small smile at his warmth, but the sting in her eyes remained.

"Maybe I was never meant to have parents."

"You don't plan to tell them the truth?"

"It's better this way." She laughed softly, but the bitterness lingered. Even if she never reclaimed her name, she wouldn't let Victoria keep what wasn't hers.

She wouldn't let her pretend to be the Montgomery heiress—not when Evelyn had suffered in her place.

A sigh escaped her as the car stopped at a red light. Glancing out the window, she froze.

Alexander's car was parked nearby.

And there he was—stepping out of a florist's shop, arms laden with a massive bouquet of crimson roses.

"Alexander?"

Sebastian followed her gaze.

Alexander slid back into his car, the roses resting on the passenger seat.

"Why would he buy so many roses?"

Was there another woman? Was that why he'd ended things with Victoria so easily? The thought reignited the embers of hatred in Evelyn's chest.

She had almost believed his guilt over her suffering played a part in his decision.

But now?

"Let's follow him," Sebastian said, pressing the accelerator. "We'll get our answers."
###Chapter 227

Evelyn didn’t think she cared about Alexander giving roses to other women. She just wasn’t ready to accept it.

Alexander’s car drove straight ahead, the road growing quieter as they moved further from the city.

To avoid detection, Sebastian kept a careful distance, trailing far behind.

After nearly twenty minutes, Evelyn saw Alexander’s car come to a stop.

But the place he had chosen left both her and Sebastian stunned.

A cemetery?

Alexander had come to a cemetery.

Why would he bring roses here?

This was the same cemetery where she had buried her grandfather and her first child. The same place where he had coldly destroyed their unborn baby right before her eyes.

A sharp tremor ran through Evelyn’s heart. The memory of that snowy day flooded back, the biting cold seeping into her bones all over again.

She would never forget the desperation in her voice as she begged him. Yet he had ignored her pleas, her tears, shattering her heart piece by piece. And in the end, he had let Victoria disfigure her without a second thought.

"Do you want to follow him inside?" Sebastian asked.

Evelyn snapped out of her thoughts and shook her head. "There are too few people here. If I go in, he’ll notice immediately."

"Then we wait?"

Evelyn fell silent.

Did she want to wait?

But what was she waiting for?

The cemetery was vast, and Alexander’s figure had already disappeared among the tombstones.

What could she possibly gain from sitting here?

"Your hands are freezing." Sebastian took her hands in his again. "Are you thinking about the past?"

His voice was soft, warm, like a gentle balm over her wounded heart.

When Evelyn didn’t respond, Sebastian’s lips curved slightly. His fingers brushed the hair away from her face.

"Don’t worry. You have me."

Inside the cemetery, Alexander walked along the familiar path, a bouquet of eighty-eight red roses in his hands.

He stopped before a tombstone, his fingers tracing the engraved name as if he could still feel her presence in the cold stone.

But the chill beneath his fingertips reminded him—this was nothing but an illusion.

Alexander set the roses down and lit a cigarette, exhaling slowly as he sat on the stone bench nearby. The smoke curled into the air, blurring the tombstone before him.

Memories surfaced—the day he had accused Evelyn of conspiring with Dominic to kidnap Ethan. The way he had shoved her away, heartless and cruel.

The rain had been relentless that day.

Now, looking back, he realized she had already been sick. Her body must have been in agony.

She had begged him, "Alexander, believe me."

She had cried, "Alexander Blackwood, why can’t you just trust me once? Just once!"

And in the end, he had crushed every last shred of hope in her eyes.

He had seen her in the rearview mirror that day—pale, broken, sitting in the rain like a discarded doll.

His heart had ached then, but he had mistaken that pain for concern over Victoria. He had never realized it was Evelyn who had torn him apart.

A sharp sting from the cigarette snapped him back to the present.

He let it burn between his fingers, his gaze fixed on the tombstone. A bitter smile tugged at his lips.

"I regret it. Do you hear me?"

His throat tightened, his eyes burning.

He had never imagined that after Evelyn’s death, he would spend every sleepless night haunted by her. That he would think of her, miss her, ache for her.

Slowly, he stood and crouched before the tombstone. Reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a small velvet box—dark blue, elegant.

When he opened it, the diamond inside caught the sunlight, casting a brilliant shimmer.

"Do you like it?" He smiled faintly. "I designed it for you."

A pause.

"She looks like you. I kept seeing you in her. But not anymore. You are you. She is her."

With that, he carefully tucked the box into the crevice beside the tombstone.

"Linnie… Can I call you that from now on?"

The only answer was the rustling of leaves as the wind swept through the cemetery.
###Chapter 228

Alexander's fingers lingered over the engraved letters on the tombstone before he finally stood.

The cemetery was empty, mirroring the hollowness in his chest.

When raindrops began to fall, he reluctantly turned away.

Meanwhile, Evelyn had just returned to her apartment with Amelia when her phone buzzed.

Alexander's name flashed on the screen.

He was waiting at the community gate, insisting he needed to speak with her urgently.

Evelyn hesitated, glancing at Sebastian, who was playing with Amelia.

"Go," Sebastian said, reading her hesitation. "Do what you must."

He understood. Revenge was her priority now.

And Alexander was part of that plan.

Evelyn changed into a sleek black dress and descended the elevator, spotting Alexander's car parked outside.

The rain had intensified, drumming heavily against the pavement.

Alexander stepped out, shielding her with an umbrella as he opened the passenger door.

Inside the car, Evelyn cut straight to the chase. "Mr. Blackwood, what's so important that it couldn't wait?"

"I want to end this," he said quietly.

"End what?" She frowned, studying his sharp profile in the dim interior light.

His lips curved slightly. "Dinner. Just dinner." He met her gaze. "I won't mistake you for her again."

"Her?"

"My ex-wife."

The car accelerated, tires splashing through puddles, as if trying to outrun the ghosts of his past.

Evelyn expected a restaurant, but instead, they arrived at his private villa—the same one she had once called home.

The house was eerily silent, devoid of even the usual staff.

Was Ethan not here?

Alexander had claimed he wouldn’t fight for custody, but if the boy remained with Victoria…

The thought unsettled her.

"Make yourself comfortable," Alexander said, shrugging off his rain-dampened coat. He handed her a cup of Earl Grey before disappearing into the kitchen.

Evelyn watched, stunned, as he began preparing dinner himself.

Thirty minutes later, an intimate candlelit dinner was set.

Fine wine, flickering candles—it was almost romantic.

"A candlelight dinner?" Evelyn arched a brow. "Isn’t this inappropriate?"

"It’s just dinner," he replied smoothly, pulling out her chair. "Miss Prescott, please."

"Thank you." She sat, amused by the absurdity of it all.

Alexander Blackwood, cooking for her?

How ironic.

You’re too late, Alexander.

My heart for you died long ago.

Now, I want you to suffer—just as I did.

"To new beginnings," Alexander murmured, raising his glass.

Evelyn clinked hers against his, her smile sharp.

Ding-dong.

The doorbell shattered the moment.

Alexander’s jaw tightened.

"Alexander, it's me!" Victoria’s voice carried through the door. "Please, let me explain! I only did those things because Evelyn forced me!"
###Chapter 229

The doorbell chimed through the grand foyer of Blackwood Estate.

Evelyn Sinclair arched a perfectly shaped eyebrow in surprise.

Had three years truly erased Victoria Lancaster's privilege of possessing a key to Alexander's home?

Her crimson lips curved slightly as she observed Alexander's reaction. His chiseled features remained impassive, though his stormy gray eyes darkened with unreadable thoughts.

"Mr. Blackwood, aren't you going to answer? That must be Miss Lancaster - the mother of your child, after all." Evelyn's voice dripped with honeyed sarcasm.

Alexander's gaze snapped to hers. "I'll only be a moment. Wait here."

"Of course." She nodded demurely, watching his retreating form with mocking amusement glittering in her emerald eyes.

'Still can't resist running to her, can you?'

The summer storm raged outside. When the door swung open, rain-laden wind rushed in, carrying the scent of petrichor and something more floral - Victoria's signature perfume.

"Alexander! You're finally willing to see me." Victoria's desperate voice preceded her as she practically threw herself at him.

She stood drenched without an umbrella, her designer dress clinging to her slender frame. The moment her eyes met Alexander's, fat tears began rolling down her cheeks as if on cue.

Her voice trembled dramatically. "Alexander, you must understand why I did what I did. Think of our first child! If Evelyn hadn't been so cruel, I never would have-"

"I never intended to actually harm Ethan! I told Dominic to take perfect care of him. I just needed space to mourn our lost baby, Alexander!"

Victoria's manicured fingers plucked at Alexander's sleeve like a desperate child. She gazed up at him through her tears, searching his icy expression for any crack in his armor.

"Can't we start fresh? Let the past stay buried. Our little family could be happy again. Please, Alexander!"

Evelyn listened from the dining room, her grip tightening around the crystal wine glass. Even now, Victoria dared to twist the narrative, painting herself as the victim.

With deliberate slowness, Evelyn let the glass slip from her fingers. It shattered spectacularly against the marble floor, ruby liquid spreading like blood across polished stone.

The sudden crash interrupted Victoria's performance. Her head snapped up sharply.

"Alexander? Who's here with you?" Her voice took on a suspicious edge.

Alexander barely glanced at her. "You should leave."

Victoria's face froze mid-pout. Before she could protest, she faked a violent shiver. "But I'm freezing! I- Ah-choo!"

The exaggerated sneeze was met with silence - until a woman's soft exclamation came from within.

"Oh dear."

Victoria's eyes widened. Even more shocking was how Alexander immediately turned back toward the sound, his entire posture tense with concern.

"Alexander!" Victoria shrieked, but he was already striding away.

She scrambled after him, heels clicking frantically across the marble. The scene that greeted her in the dining room made her blood run cold.

Alexander knelt beside the broken glass, his hand outstretched toward...

"Vivian Prescott?" Victoria gasped, taking in the stunning woman crouched near the mess, her emerald eyes glittering with something dangerous.
###Chapter 230

Evelyn had been simmering with rage for days, and the sight before her now pushed her to the brink.

She never expected to find Vivian Prescott standing in Alexander Blackwood's mansion!

That was the final straw.

The elegant candlelit dinner set before them. Alexander carefully holding Vivian's hand as he tended to her minor injury. Evelyn couldn't stomach any of it.

"It's just a scratch. No need to fuss, Mr. Blackwood," Vivian said airily, withdrawing her hand.

"Even small wounds can get infected if not treated properly," Alexander murmured, rising to fetch antiseptic. His gaze briefly flickered to Evelyn as she followed him inside before turning to retrieve the first aid kit.

"Thank you." Vivian's polite words floated behind him as she slowly stood.

Her eyes lifted as if noticing Evelyn's stormy expression for the first time. "Miss Lancaster, what an unexpected pleasure."

Evelyn's blood boiled as she forced a saccharine smile. "Miss Prescott, might I ask why you're in my fiancé's home?"

"Fiancé?" Vivian's lips curved. "If memory serves, Mr. Blackwood has publicly declared your engagement null and void."

"You—" Evelyn's mask shattered instantly. "Vivian Prescott, what are you implying? I see your game now—using that face to seduce Alexander!"

"And if I am?" Vivian's careless shrug was infuriating. "Can you blame me? A man like Mr. Blackwood is rather... irresistible."

"You shameless—" Evelyn's hand flew up, aiming for Vivian's face. "You conniving little—"

Vivian caught Evelyn's wrist mid-swing. Simultaneously, her free hand delivered a stinging slap across Evelyn's cheek.

The sharp crack echoed through the room.

Evelyn staggered back, eyes wide with shock. "How dare you strike me? Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? No one crosses me and lives to tell the tale—not Evelyn Sinclair, and certainly not you!"

She was still clutching her reddened cheek when Alexander returned. Instantly, she transformed into a weeping damsel. "Alexander—"

"Mr. Blackwood, perhaps I should leave before I further offend your... guest." Vivian's melodious interruption cut through Evelyn's theatrics.

Alexander's gaze flicked between them before striding to Vivian's side. "Let me tend to that wound first."

"Unnecessary." Vivian's delicate frown was artful. "Though I may resemble that unfortunate Evelyn Sinclair, I've no desire to share her fate. A slap today—who knows what tomorrow might bring?"

Evelyn's jaw dropped. "That's a lie! She struck me! Alexander, she admitted she's trying to seduce you—"

"Perhaps you should leave." Alexander's icy dismissal froze Evelyn mid-tirade.

Her face cycled through shades of purple and white, fists clenching until her manicured nails bit into her palms.

She was always the puppeteer—never the puppet!

With a strangled cry, Evelyn lunged at Vivian, only to be blocked by Alexander's imposing frame.

His glacial stare pinned her in place. "Have you not done enough damage today?"
###Chapter 231

Evelyn stared at Alexander's stern expression, her breath catching in her throat. "Alexander, what did you just say?"

"Why won't you leave?" His voice had softened slightly, carrying an undercurrent of something resembling affection.

Her nails dug into her palms as she watched Victoria smirk behind Alexander's protective stance. The sight made her blood boil.

Just when Victoria expected Evelyn to erupt in fury, something unexpected happened. Evelyn's clenched fists relaxed, her anger dissipating like morning mist. She stepped closer to Alexander, her voice trembling.

"Alexander."

Tears welled up in Evelyn's reddened eyes as she gazed at his impassive face.

"I know I've made mistakes. I've disappointed you. But I've never betrayed my principles. Everything I've done was for Ethan and you. I would never harm an innocent person."

Her voice broke as tears spilled over. The performance was flawless - the picture of wounded devotion.

"I know words mean nothing now. But I'm innocent. I'll wait however long it takes for you to believe me."

Without waiting for his response, Evelyn turned and walked out, her solitary figure disappearing into the storm.

Through the rain-streaked window, Vivian could see Evelyn standing resolutely at the gates, letting the downpour soak her completely.

The scene felt eerily familiar.

Vivian remembered her own past - wrongfully accused by Evelyn, standing outside these very gates in the rain, pregnant and desperate for Alexander's trust. That memory still carried the sharp sting of betrayal.

Her gaze flickered to Alexander, who watched Evelyn through the window with an unreadable expression.

'Does your heart still ache for her, Alexander? After all these years of loving her?'

But within moments, Alexander turned away. He took Vivian's injured hand gently, carefully removing glass shards before disinfecting and bandaging the wound.

"Let's finish dinner." His lips twitched, but the movement didn't quite form a smile. Just a mechanical response.

He was pitying Evelyn. Just as Vivian had expected.

"Perhaps we shouldn't." Vivian smiled politely. "If I stay, I fear my life in Willowbrook will become even more complicated."

"I'm here. No one will dare touch you." The assurance came without hesitation.

Vivian's eyes widened in feigned surprise, while inwardly she scoffed.

'Alexander Blackwood, when I was your wife... did you ever protect me like this? You and Evelyn tore me apart repeatedly. And now you claim to be my shield? Weren't you the one who left me bleeding and broken?'

Outside, Evelyn stood drenched, calculating her next move.

This desperate play was all she had left.

She prayed the storm would worsen - that she'd catch pneumonia, collapse dramatically. That would surely capture Alexander's attention.

After all, she still held her trump card.

Alexander insisted Vivian stay for dinner.

From her seat, Vivian could see Evelyn's pathetic figure through the rain-streaked windows. The woman hadn't moved an inch.

But Vivian knew better. This was just another one of Evelyn's manipulative performances.

'The wheel of fortune has turned, Evelyn. Now you know how it feels to be wronged. How does it taste?'

Vivian hid her smirk behind her wine glass, draining it in one satisfied gulp.

"Miss Prescott, you handle alcohol remarkably well," Alexander remarked.

Vivian smiled. "Even Sebastian can't outdrink me."

"Is that so?" Alexander's lips curved, but his thoughts drifted to Evelyn Sinclair.

The Evelyn he remembered couldn't hold her liquor. That one time she'd gotten drunk, she'd clung to him, whispering sweet nothings in her intoxicated state.

Those memories felt precious now. Untouchable.

"Miss Prescott, could we be friends from today onward?"

"As long as you stop mistaking me for your ex-wife Evelyn Sinclair, friendship is possible."

"Don't worry. That won't happen again."
###Chapter 232

Alexander's intense gaze met Evelyn's mesmerizing eyes as he confidently raised his wine glass.

"This first toast is an apology for whoever offended you earlier," Alexander declared before draining the glass. He immediately poured another. "And this is to celebrate meeting such an extraordinary woman like Miss Prescott."

He continued drinking glass after glass without pause.

The night deepened as the rain softened to a drizzle. By the time Alexander finished the entire bottle, his pale complexion had flushed with intoxication.

His usually sharp, captivating eyes now glazed over with drunken haze.

"Future Mrs. Blackwood, allow me to escort you home," Alexander slurred as he stood unsteadily.

"Mr. Blackwood, you should rest. I'll call Nathaniel to pick me up."

"Him?" Alexander chuckled deeply, his rich baritone vibrating with sensual charm. His alcohol-clouded vision blurred the crystal chandelier's light, making the woman before him resemble the one from his dreams.

"I insist on seeing you home," he persisted, staggering toward Evelyn.

His steps faltered dangerously before he reached her. Though initially reluctant, remembering Victoria watching outside, Evelyn extended her hand to steady him.

His full weight collapsed against her, confirming his drunken state.

"Mr. Blackwood, let's sit for a moment," Evelyn struggled to guide him to the sofa.

She knew the brighter the interior lights, the clearer Victoria could see from outside. That woman must be seething with rage by now.

"You're intoxicated. Let me make you some lemon water," Evelyn said, attempting to withdraw her hand.

Alexander's grip tightened suddenly. "Don't go," he murmured.

Turning, Evelyn saw the half-reclining man - cheeks flushed, gaze unfocused - whispering, "Lillian..." The name slipped from his lips repeatedly.

Evelyn stared coldly at the drunken man.

"Lillian, don't leave me again..."

Lillian.

Evelyn's lips pressed into a thin line. Of course he was calling for Victoria, the woman who'd stolen her identity as Miss Montgomery and taken the name Lillian Montgomery.

She regarded Alexander with a sneer.

"So you still can't forget that viperous Victoria. Your broken engagement must be just for show? How could the great Alexander Blackwood ever let her go?"

As Evelyn tried to pull away, Alexander yanked her forcefully into his arms.

Crashing against his broad chest, Evelyn inhaled his familiar icy fragrance.

She jerked her head up, meeting his dark, misty eyes. His intoxicated gaze held bottomless depth - mysterious, alluring, yet deceptively tender.

Evelyn's expression remained razor-sharp.

"Alexander, look carefully. I'm not your Lillian. I'm the ex-wife you hated enough to kill!"

Her lips trembled with suppressed fury as she glared at his handsome face.

"I'll reclaim everything you owe me with interest. You'll finally understand how it feels to be manipulated and betrayed by someone you love!"

Suddenly, Alexander tightened his embrace.

"Lillian..." His heated whisper brushed her ear.

Evelyn froze until his lips grazed her cheek. She struggled violently.

"Alexander, release me!"

"Never again... I'll never let you go again, Lillian..."

"I'm not her! Let go!"

Their struggle dislodged something from Alexander's pocket. The fallen object caught Evelyn's eye, and one glance petrified her completely.
###Chapter 233

Evelyn Sinclair could forget many things in her life.

She could forget the happiest moments she had ever experienced.

She could even forget the intoxicating feeling of being deeply in love with Alexander Blackwood.

But there was one thing she would never forget—not for the rest of her life.

Her breath hitched as she slowly bent down, her fingers trembling as they brushed against the object lying on the floor.

The moment she picked it up, memories crashed over her like violent waves.

She could almost hear the rhythmic sound of the ocean, smell the salt in the air, taste the sea breeze on her lips.

And then, a boy’s voice, soft and sincere, whispered in her ear.

"Linnie, when I grow up, I'll make you my bride..."

But that promise had been swept away by the wind, sinking into the depths of the sea, never to resurface.

Some things could never return to the way they once were.

"Linnie..."

Alexander’s drunken murmur snapped her out of her thoughts.

He was still calling for her—or at least, the name that had once belonged to her.

But the Linnie he was calling for now was not Evelyn.

It was Victoria Lancaster—the woman he had spoiled, the woman he had loved blindly, the woman who had destroyed everything.

Evelyn’s fingers tightened around the small, colorful shell in her palm.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

After all these years, he still kept it?

"Alexander," she whispered, her voice laced with venom. "Why hold onto this when your heart belongs to Victoria? The girl who waited for you all those years is dead."

Her gaze flickered to his flushed face, his lashes fluttering as he mumbled incoherently.

Disgust coiled in her stomach.

She turned sharply, ready to toss the shell into the nearest trash bin—

But his hand shot out, gripping her wrist with surprising strength.

"Linnie... don’t go. Please... don’t leave me..."

Evelyn froze.

For a moment, something inside her wavered—but then she remembered.

She remembered the betrayal.

The pain.

The lies.

With a sharp jerk, she wrenched her arm free.

"Your precious Linnie is outside putting on a performance," she spat. "If you miss her so much, go find her yourself."

Without another word, she snatched up her bag and strode toward the door.

The moment she stepped outside, she was met with the sight of Victoria Lancaster standing in the rain, her expression shifting from hopeful to murderous in an instant.

Evelyn smirked, unfurling her umbrella with deliberate slowness.

"My, my, Ms. Lancaster," she drawled. "How dedicated you are, standing out here in the rain just to win back Alexander’s favor."

Victoria’s lips curled into a sneer. "Don’t act so smug, Vivian. You think this little stunt will tear us apart?" She took a step closer, her voice dropping to a venomous whisper. "Alexander will always love me. And if you keep pushing me, you’ll regret it."

Evelyn tilted her head, feigning innocence. "Oh? I’m terrified."

Victoria’s eyes flashed. "You—"

"Alexander’s cooking is quite impressive," Evelyn interrupted smoothly. "He’s already invited me back for another tasting."

Victoria’s face darkened.

"And he’s a terrible drinker," Evelyn continued, her lips curving into a mocking smile. "He got so drunk he held my hand and wouldn’t let go."

Victoria’s breath hitched. "What did he say to you?"

Evelyn shrugged. "Why don’t you ask him yourself?"

Victoria lunged for the door—only to find it locked.

Evelyn’s laughter was cold. "I locked it. You’ll have to wait until he sobers up."

Victoria whirled around, fury burning in her eyes. "You bitch—"

She raised her hand to strike—

But Evelyn caught her wrist effortlessly, her grip like steel.

"Try that again," Evelyn murmured, her voice dangerously soft, "and I’ll break every bone in your hand."

She shoved Victoria back with enough force to send her stumbling.

Victoria barely caught herself, her chest heaving with rage.

Evelyn adjusted her umbrella, casting one last dismissive glance at the soaked woman before her.

"If you enjoy standing in the rain so much, by all means—stay."

And with that, she turned and walked away, leaving Victoria seething in the storm.
###Chapter 234

Evelyn had already turned away with careless ease when Victoria regained her balance.

The sight of that retreating figure sent waves of fury crashing through Victoria's veins.

She jabbed a trembling finger toward Evelyn's back, venom dripping from her words. "Vivian Prescott, you vile creature! You'll soon learn exactly what I'm capable of! Just you wait!"

Victoria's scream tore through the air, raw and unrestrained.

The memory of what she'd witnessed through the window moments ago burned like acid in her chest.

No.

She had to regain control.

Victoria reminded herself—this woman was no match for her. How could a mere lookalike ever hope to stand against her?

"Vivian Prescott, your reckoning is coming," she hissed, her narrowed eyes glinting with malice.

—

Evelyn waited for Sebastian at the street corner before he drove her home.

Night had fallen, and now she stood before the French windows, gazing at the city lights.

That shell—the one Alexander had carried—haunted her thoughts.

Why did he keep it with him always?

Hadn't he denied their promise years ago? Hadn't he erased their shared past on that beach?

The questions twisted in her mind.

She turned to look at Amelia, peacefully asleep in bed.

Her fingers brushed the child's soft cheek.

"Daddy..." the little girl murmured in her dreams.

Daddy.

She called for him—the man she believed to be the most wonderful father in the world.

Perhaps this sweet illusion would never shatter.

—

The next morning dawned gray and heavy.

Alexander woke with a dull ache in his skull.

Fragments of the previous night surfaced—his loss of control, the way he'd clutched Vivian, whispered Linnie's name, pressed his lips to her cheek.

Disgust coiled in his gut.

He snatched his phone and dialed Evelyn without hesitation.

Her voice, crisp and composed, greeted him. "Mr. Blackwood, you're awake. You were quite drunk last night. I've prepared breakfast and will be at your office shortly."

The words he'd meant to say died on his tongue.

Instead, something warm and unfamiliar stirred in his chest.

He didn't refuse. A faint smile touched his lips. "I'll freshen up and wait for you."

After hanging up, he showered and dressed.

As he descended the stairs, his foot struck something on the floor.

The shell.

His breath caught.

He snatched it up, turning it over in his palm. A memory flashed—sharp and sudden.

He bolted for the door.

Evelyn stepped inside just as Alexander rushed out.

Their eyes locked in the pale morning light. She noted the shadows beneath his eyes, the tension in his jaw.

"Mr. Blackwood," she began.

A loud thud from the courtyard cut her off.

Both turned.

A sodden figure lay sprawled on the ground.

Victoria.
###Chapter 235

Evelyn watched Alexander hesitate for several heartbeats. In those suspended moments, she couldn't decipher the thoughts flashing behind his stormy gray eyes. Then, with sudden decision, he turned toward Victoria with that familiar conflicted expression before rushing to her side.

He dropped to his knees, gathering Victoria's limp form against his chest. "Vicky, Vicky, wake up," Alexander murmured, his fingers brushing her pale cheek with tender concern.

The breakfast bag in Evelyn's hands suddenly felt like lead. Standing frozen in the doorway, she felt her lips twist into a bitter smile.

'Alexander Blackwood, you never fail to meet my lowest expectations.'

'After everything she's done, she still holds your heart in her delicate hands.'

Victoria's eyelids fluttered open dramatically, tears already glistening on her lashes. "Alex, I was wrong," she whispered hoarsely. "I see that now. Please...don't abandon me." A single tear traced down her porcelain cheek.

"Alex, remember your promise? To always protect me? That you'd cherish me forever?" Victoria's voice trembled with practiced fragility. "All I've ever wanted was to be your bride. To stand by your side for eternity, my darling Lex—"

Lex.

The childhood nickname struck Evelyn like a physical blow. Her fingers clenched around the paper bag until the edges bit into her palms.

Alexander's brow furrowed as he studied Victoria, his expression unreadable.

"Lex, can you forgive your Lily? I'll be good, I promise. No more reckless behavior—" Victoria invoked the pet name from their shared past, her eyes brimming with calculated vulnerability.

Evelyn nearly applauded the performance. The woman deserved an Oscar for this display.

How touching. How utterly nauseating.

"You're burning up," Alexander said tersely. "We need to get you to the hospital." As he helped Victoria rise, she suddenly threw her arms around his neck. "Alex, if you can't forgive me, I'd rather die right here—"

Alexander's jaw tightened. "Enough of that talk."

His gaze lifted and locked with Evelyn's standing in the doorway. The apology in his eyes was almost laughable.

"Don't let me keep you, Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn said smoothly before he could speak. "Miss Lancaster needs medical attention. Fevers can be quite dangerous, after all."

Victoria peeked at Evelyn from beneath her lashes, a smirk playing at her lips when she saw Evelyn turn away. "Alex," she whispered loudly enough to carry, "I've been standing all night. I don't think I can walk. Will you carry me?"

The request sent an unexpected jolt through Evelyn's chest.

Of course he would.

The realization burned hotter than she cared to admit.

Why should she care? It wasn't jealousy—just disgust at seeing Victoria's manipulations succeed yet again.

But Alexander surprised them both. He helped Victoria to the car without lifting her, his hands remaining strictly professional. As the car passed the intersection, Evelyn caught his lingering gaze through the window, the breakfast still clutched uselessly in her hands.

That face. Always that damned face.

The following days passed without Alexander's presence. Though he called repeatedly and visited her boutique, Evelyn made herself scarce. She'd once built her universe around Alexander Blackwood.

But universes could exist without their false suns.

The only reason she'd allowed him back into her orbit was vengeance.

Yet even revenge required patience.

Evelyn understood the delicate balance—Alexander was beginning to see her again, truly see her. And that fragile recognition was worth more than any impulsive strike.
###Chapter 236

The trap had been set, and now it was only a matter of time before the prey took the bait.

Sunday.

Evelyn and Sebastian had promised Amelia they would take her to the amusement park.

Though Amelia wasn’t Sebastian’s biological daughter, he adored her as if she were his own.

He had been by Evelyn’s side throughout her pregnancy, doting on her every need. And after Amelia was born, his devotion only deepened.

Sebastian was the kind of man who came once in a lifetime—thoughtful, protective, and endlessly kind.

Yet Evelyn knew she didn’t deserve him. She never allowed herself to entertain romantic feelings, no matter how perfect he seemed.

"Daddy, I want that bunny!" Amelia’s sweet voice snapped Evelyn out of her thoughts.

The little girl had her arms wrapped around Sebastian’s neck, legs swinging excitedly as she nuzzled against him. Her tiny finger pointed at a rabbit-shaped balloon floating nearby.

"Please, Daddy?"

Sebastian’s eyes softened with affection. "Anything for my precious Amelia." He chuckled, carrying her toward the balloon vendor.

He rarely used nicknames, always calling her by her full name—Amelia.

"Daddy’s the best! I love you!" Amelia squealed before planting a loud kiss on his cheek.

Evelyn smiled, trailing behind them. Watching the joy on her daughter’s face, she was reminded of why she had chosen the name.

Amelia.

Like the flower lily—symbolizing rebirth.

She refused to let this child suffer the same fate she had. Evelyn had been destroyed by love, left with nothing but a shattered heart.

But Amelia? She would have everything.

Sebastian bought the balloon, and they spent the morning riding attractions, laughter filling the air.

By lunchtime, Amelia tugged Sebastian’s hand toward a themed restaurant.

"Daddy, I want that! Look how big the burger is!"

Sebastian smirked. "Careful, little one. Eat too much, and you’ll turn into a chubby bunny."

Amelia blinked, her innocent eyes widening. Then, her lower lip trembled.

"Waaah—Daddy doesn’t want me anymore! I don’t want the burger! I don’t!"

Sebastian hadn’t expected his teasing to backfire so spectacularly.

He scooped her up, instantly remorseful. "Silly girl, of course I want you. You’ll always be Mommy and Daddy’s treasure."

"Don’t cry, sweetheart. Daddy was just joking." Evelyn wiped her tears away.

Amelia sniffled. "So… can I have the burger?"

Sebastian laughed. "Anything you want."

Instantly, her tears vanished. "Daddy, I need to pee now."

Sebastian glanced at Evelyn. "I’ll get in line. You take her."

Evelyn nodded, taking Amelia’s small hand.

The little girl skipped happily, clutching her balloon—until a gust of wind snatched it from her grip.

"Mommy! My bunny’s flying away!"

Evelyn lunged for it, but the balloon soared higher, out of reach.

Distracted, she didn’t notice the figure behind her—until strong arms caught her waist.

A familiar scent enveloped her. Warm breath brushed her ear.

"Careful."
###Chapter 237

The moment that familiar scent enveloped her, Evelyn Sinclair knew exactly who was holding her.

But why was Alexander Blackwood here?

Had he brought Ethan with him?

Was her son nearby?

The thought of Ethan suddenly flooded her mind. Steeling herself, she pulled free from Alexander's embrace.

"It's the nice gentleman!"

Amelia beamed up at Alexander, her rosy cheeks dimpling with delight. The little girl clearly adored him.

A faint smile curved Alexander's lips as he glanced at Amelia before his piercing gaze settled on Evelyn.

"Seems I made the right choice coming out today," he remarked, his tone laced with implication. "Why didn't you answer my calls?"

Evelyn lifted her chin, forcing a polite smile. "Apologies, Mr. Blackwood. I've been occupied spending time with Sebastian and my daughter. Meaningless calls aren't a priority."

"Meaningless?" His brow arched. As she turned to leave with Amelia, his hand shot out, gripping her wrist.

Evelyn froze. "Mr. Blackwood, release me. Unless you'd like Victoria Lancaster to assault me again for daring to breathe the same air as you."

Alexander's intense stare burned into her. Sunlight danced across her flawless skin, illuminating her with an ethereal glow.

Memories flickered in his eyes, softening his gaze. "I made you come all that way for nothing. I regret wasting the breakfast you prepared. But I couldn't just let her die."

Of course not.

Evelyn's lips curled in bitter amusement.

Alexander, did you ever lift a finger when I was drowning in despair?

You didn't just watch—you plunged the knife deeper.

"Vivian, are you jealous?" The question caught her off guard.

Her heart stuttered before she schooled her features into indifference.

"See this, Mr. Blackwood?" She gestured to Amelia. "I have a child with Sebastian. Why would I care about any man who isn't him?"

Alexander's smile vanished.

His jaw tightened, lips pressing into a hard line.

"She's yours and Sebastian's daughter?" Ice dripped from his words.

Evelyn smiled sweetly. "Obviously."

"How long have you known each other?"

"Three years."

Three years.

Those three years had haunted Alexander—the memory of Evelyn's lifeless body in his arms, the crushing certainty she was gone forever.

It had been three years since that day.

Three years since she left him.

"Amelia, let's go."

"Okay!" The little girl chirped, her crystal-blue eyes twinkling. "Bye-bye, nice mister!"

As Evelyn turned away, Alexander snapped back to the present. His fingers closed around her slender wrist again, his grip unyielding.

"Mr. Blackwood?"

Evelyn frowned, irritation flashing in her eyes.

"Something else?"

"How old is your daughter?" he demanded, his expression grave.

"Two," she answered without hesitation.
###Chapter 238

"You've known him for three years but Amelia's already two?" Alexander's brows knitted together. His piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. "That would mean you got together with him right after meeting."

"Sebastian and I had an instant connection," Evelyn answered without hesitation, meeting his stare head-on. "I knew immediately he was the one I wanted to build a family with. Is that so hard to believe?"

Alexander's chest tightened, those buried suspicions resurfacing with renewed intensity.

"Alexander!"

Victoria's shrill voice shattered the moment.

Evelyn turned to see the woman rushing toward them, her perfectly styled hair bouncing with each step. When their eyes met, Victoria's gaze burned with undisguised hatred.

She looked remarkably different from the frail figure Evelyn had seen in the rain that day. Victoria latched onto Alexander's arm, her manicured nails digging into his sleeve as she glared at their proximity.

"Alexander, Ethan is missing!" she cried.

Ethan was gone?

Evelyn's pulse stuttered inexplicably, a strange unease coiling in her stomach despite her composed exterior.

She noticed something peculiar - while Victoria wore her usual mask of concern, Alexander's expression remained disturbingly calm.

As if the child meant nothing to him.

"He can't have gone far," Alexander said coolly, finally releasing Evelyn's wrist. "There's no need for panic."

"You should look for him, Mr. Blackwood," Evelyn found herself saying. "This place is crowded, and there could be dangerous people around. Ethan is your only heir. You wouldn't want anything to happen to him."

"Obviously!" Victoria sneered, tossing her hair. "Ethan is our flesh and blood. Of course Alexander cares—"

"He's not my only child."

The words hung heavy in the air.

Both women froze. Evelyn watched as a faint, unreadable smile touched Alexander's lips.

"Alexander," Victoria tugged at his arm, her voice turning saccharine. "Let's go find our son. These... distractions aren't worth your time."

Though irritation flickered across Alexander's features, he allowed himself to be led away. But not before casting one last intense look at Evelyn that left her skin tingling.

After taking Amelia to the restroom, Evelyn returned to the restaurant where Sebastian had just ordered their meals.

"Daddy!" Amelia squealed, running into Sebastian's waiting arms.

"There's my princess," he cooed, settling her into the high chair before noticing Evelyn's distracted expression. "What's wrong?"

"I ran into Alexander," Evelyn admitted. "He and Victoria brought Ethan here, but apparently they've lost him."

"Lost him?" Sebastian's grip tightened slightly on his menu. "You mean he's missing?"

"I'm not sure. But I get the feeling Victoria isn't as concerned as she pretends to be." Evelyn bit her lip, then met Sebastian's understanding gaze. "Could you watch Amelia? I need to step out for a bit."

"Going to look for Ethan?" Sebastian guessed accurately.

Evelyn nodded. "Regardless of who his mother is, he's just an innocent child." After kissing Amelia's forehead, she hurried out.

The warmth drained from Sebastian's eyes as he watched her leave.

Evelyn searched alone, catching glimpses of Alexander and Victoria combing through the crowds, their efforts appearing increasingly half-hearted.

As dusk painted the sky in hues of orange and purple, the amusement park began emptying. With only minutes until closing, Evelyn's anxiety grew.

Her worry for Ethan felt irrational yet overwhelming, eclipsing all other thoughts.

Sebastian called to say he'd wait at the parking lot. Hanging up, Evelyn continued her frantic search as darkness descended.

Then she remembered Ethan's odd behavior during his visit to her home. A realization struck.

"Could he be...?" Her breath caught as she turned toward the park's western edge.
###Chapter 239

A sudden realization struck Evelyn. She spun on her heels and sprinted toward a secluded corner of the abandoned amusement park.

The evening had swallowed the last remnants of daylight. Street lamps flickered to life, casting long shadows across the deserted pathways. The once-vibrant park now stood silent, save for the whispering leaves dancing in the chilly breeze.

"Alexander, what are we going to do? Ethan must have been kidnapped!" Victoria clung to Alexander's arm, her voice trembling with panic.

Her nails dug into his sleeve. "Alexander, we can't lose him! He's our only child!"

The emphasis on 'only child' made Alexander's expression darken. Before he could respond, movement caught his eye.

"Go home first. I'll handle this," Alexander dismissed Victoria abruptly, striding away without another glance.

"Alexander! Wait!" Victoria's cries fell on deaf ears as he disappeared into the gathering shadows.

Meanwhile, Evelyn followed her instincts through the park's hidden corners. Behind a crumbling faux mountain, she found him.

The dim glow from a nearby lamp barely penetrated the artificial cave. There, curled into a tight ball, sat little Ethan. His slender arms wrapped around his knees, his entire body shaking.

The sight pierced Evelyn's heart like a dagger.

"Ethan?" she called softly. The boy's trembling stilled momentarily.

"It's me, Vivian." Evelyn knelt before him, reaching out to stroke his hair.

Slowly, the child lifted his tear-streaked face. His wide, frightened eyes locked onto Evelyn's before flooding with fresh tears.

"V-Vivian..."

"I'm here." Evelyn's voice broke as she gathered the freezing child into her arms. The autumn wind had stolen all warmth from his tiny frame.

Ethan clung to her like a lifeline, burying his face in her chest.

"Sweetheart, why are you hiding here all alone?" Evelyn murmured against his hair.

"Too many people... I hate it." His voice quivered like a leaf in the wind. "And... and it's so dark..."

Evelyn's breath caught. This child feared crowds and darkness so intensely he'd rather freeze alone than face them.

Her arms tightened around him. This was Victoria's doing, she was certain of it.

The depth of Ethan's loneliness and terror shook Evelyn to her core. She cradled him closer, wishing she could absorb all his pain.

As she turned to leave, a silhouette materialized under the flickering streetlight. Alexander had been watching them the entire time.

The amber glow obscured his expression as he approached. His dark eyes searched Evelyn's face, words hanging unspoken between them.

Evelyn tried to pass Ethan to his father, but the boy refused to let go, his small fingers clutching her jacket desperately.

After texting Sebastian, Evelyn reluctantly followed Alexander back to Blackwood Estate.

Only upon arriving did Alexander realize he'd abandoned Victoria at the park. A brief phone call sufficed as fort before he hung up.

He found himself lingering outside Ethan's bedroom door, watching through the crack as Evelyn tenderly tucked the boy in. The gentle care in her movements stirred something long buried in Alexander's chest.

When Evelyn emerged, she found Alexander waiting.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said coolly, "however this child came to be, he's still yours and the woman you claim to love. How could you be so careless with him?"
###Chapter 240

Evelyn turned on her heel, tossing over her shoulder, "You should take Ethan to see a doctor. I'm leaving now."

"He's not my only child."

?

Alexander's cryptic remark echoed behind her, just as he'd said this afternoon.

Evelyn froze mid-step, sensing Alexander closing the distance between them.

"I have a daughter too."

"..."

Her heart stuttered painfully as a flicker of devastation crossed her eyes.

Had her words this afternoon aroused his suspicion? Had he uncovered something in these few hours?

Just as her thoughts spiraled, Alexander's voice whispered against her ear. "With my ex-wife."

"..."

Her eyes widened fractionally, a dagger of anguish twisting in her chest.

"Really?" She forced a smile as she turned to meet his piercing gaze. "Where is she now?"

Alexander studied Evelyn's face intently, an inscrutable smirk playing on his lips. "Dead."

"..."

"Killed by her own father—me."

"..."

Evelyn's fists clenched involuntarily, yet she maintained her composed smile. "Mr. Blackwood, what a morbid sense of humor. What father would harm his own flesh and blood?" She glanced at her wristwatch. "I really must go. Sebastian will worry."

With that, she turned away.

The moment her back faced him, her carefully constructed smile shattered. Darkness and agony threatened to consume her.

Evelyn bit her lip hard, willing the tears not to fall.

Yet the image of that lost child—destroyed by Alexander's hands—sent hot tears escaping down her cheeks.

From the second-floor balcony, Alexander watched Evelyn's hurried departure. He pulled out his phone, dialing Lucas. "Dig deeper into Vivian Prescott's background. I want every detail. Also investigate Sebastian Whitman's movements over the past three years. Report anything unusual immediately."

On the other end, Lucas sprang into action.

Hanging up, Alexander's pulse raced inexplicably.

He recalled this afternoon's conversation with Evelyn, little Amelia's innocent face flashing in his mind. Then came the memory of that fateful night three years ago—how he'd taken Nathaniel Sterling's affectionate gesture as betrayal and ravaged Evelyn in blind rage.

If Evelyn had survived... if she'd conceived that night... the child would be two now.

His earlier confession had been deliberate. That fleeting anguish in Evelyn's eyes when he spoke of killing his own child—he'd caught it.

Returning to the apartment, Evelyn found Sebastian tucking Amelia into bed.

"Everything alright?" Sebastian noted Evelyn's troubled expression.

She recounted everything, voicing her fears. "Sebastian, I think he suspects me again."

"Don't fret." Sebastian's calm smile never wavered. "I won't let him connect you to Evelyn."

"You have a plan?"

"One that will erase all doubts about you being Maddie." His gentle smile mirrored the tranquil night outside the window. "I'd hoped you'd rest today. Instead, you're distressed." His fingers brushed her cheek tenderly. "Go shower and sleep."

At his touch, Evelyn shivered slightly before nodding. "Goodnight."

"Goodnight." Sebastian watched her retreat, his warm gaze dimming like the gathering storm clouds outside, layers of mystery swirling in those depths...

Alexander tossed restlessly all night. Just as sleep claimed him, Lucas called.

Snapping awake, he scanned the documents Lucas had sent.

"Mr. Blackwood, I've forwarded everything. Most appears unremarkable, but one detail stands out."

Alexander stopped scrolling. "What is it?"
###Chapter 241

Alexander hesitated. Then, he voiced his suspicion, saying, "Sebastian's company and business have been in Willowbrook this whole time, but for some reason, he left to go to F Country."

"Sebastian has been staying in F Country for the past three years and rarely left. According to sources, he met Vivian online and fell in love with her at first sight."

F Country.

Alexander remembered that Vivian was also from F Country. However, from her appearance, she was obviously not a native.

After he hung up the phone, Alexander read through the information slowly.

Nothing about Vivian's background raised any red flags. But one date in Sebastian's file caught his attention—a date he would never forget.

That day three years ago, Evelyn's lifeless body had lain in his arms. No breath. No pulse. Gone forever.

Yet, on that very same day, Sebastian had abruptly left Willowbrook for F Country.

The records confirmed it—Evelyn's death and Sebastian's departure coincided.

Was this mere coincidence?

With this suspicion gnawing at him, Alexander woke Ethan. After getting him ready, he drove him to kindergarten.

From the rearview mirror, Alexander watched Ethan sitting silently in the backseat. Suddenly, Evelyn's words from last night echoed in his mind: "I suggest you take him to see a doctor."

"Ethan, are you feeling okay?" Alexander asked.

Ethan's dark eyes flickered. He clutched his backpack tighter, lowering his head as he shook it.

Alexander frowned.

This wasn't the Ethan he remembered. The boy who used to trail behind him, calling him "Daddy" with endless energy and affection.

But somewhere along the way, that bright child had withdrawn. Stopped speaking. Stopped reaching for him.

Alexander didn't press further. He already knew the answer.

The moment he realized how deeply he cared for Evelyn, everything—and everyone—had shifted.

After walking Ethan inside, Alexander didn't leave. Instead, he parked his car nearby and waited.

Soon, a familiar figure appeared.

There she was—the woman who looked exactly like Evelyn, holding Amelia's hand as they approached the school gates. Her smile was soft, warm.

Alexander's grip tightened on the steering wheel. His pulse quickened as he memorized every detail of her expression.

Once she drove away, he stepped out and entered the kindergarten.

Though Amelia's teacher handled the older children, she recognized Alexander immediately—Ethan's father, one of Willowbrook's most influential men.

"Mr. Blackwood," she greeted with a polite smile. "Are you here for Ethan? He's in the next classroom."

"I'm here for her." Alexander pointed to Amelia, who was laughing with her classmates.

The teacher followed his gaze. "Amelia Prescott?"

Amelia Prescott.

The name settled heavily in his chest.

Alexander nodded, his gaze fixed on her rosy cheeks and bright eyes. "Yes."

The teacher's smile widened in understanding. "Oh! So Amelia is a Blackwood too? No wonder she and Ethan are so close—they must be siblings!"

Siblings.

The word struck Alexander like a physical blow.

His heart clenched. A tangled mess of emotions surged within him.

Amelia was brought over quickly. When she saw Alexander, she grinned, dimples appearing. "Hello, nice mister!"
###Chapter 242

"Over here!" The little girl's cheerful voice rang out, her delicate features bearing an uncanny resemblance to Evelyn's.

Alexander knelt down, gently stroking the child's silky hair.

"Hello, Amelia. I'm Ethan's father."

"I remember you." The child blinked her sparkling hazel eyes. "Are you here to play with me, kind sir?"

A warm smile touched Alexander's lips as he produced a plush rabbit from his coat pocket.

"I brought Ethan to school today, so I thought I'd visit you too. This is for you."

"Oh! She's so fluffy!" Amelia immediately cuddled the stuffed animal, completely enchanted.

Seizing the moment, Alexander discreetly plucked a single strand of hair from the child's head.

Gazing at her innocent face, his chest tightened with unspoken longing.

With conflicted emotions swirling inside him, Alexander headed straight to a private DNA testing facility. Using his connections, he expedited the process.

"The results will take approximately eight hours," the technician informed him.

Leaving the clinic, Alexander drove toward Sebastian Whitman's corporate headquarters.

After circling the block twice, he abruptly changed direction.

If Sebastian was determined to keep Evelyn's secrets, no amount of questioning would yield answers.

The agonizing wait stretched before him like an eternity.

Meanwhile, Evelyn was reviewing shipment manifests for Lady Belle's upcoming anniversary gala when Alexander's luxury sedan pulled up outside her boutique.

Remembering their tense conversation the previous night, she composed herself quickly.

"Mr. Blackwood? To what do I owe this pleasure?" Her voice remained steady as she met his intense gaze. "Is there something on my face?" she added lightly when his stare lingered.

Alexander closed the distance between them, his presence overwhelming. "I simply can't look away from such breathtaking beauty, Miss Prescott."

Evelyn's cheeks warmed at his boldness in public. "We're both engaged to others, Mr. Blackwood. People might talk."

Ignoring the curious glances from passersby, he asked, "Picking up your daughter?"

Evelyn nodded cautiously. "And if I am?"

"I'm collecting Ethan. We'll go together."

Before she could protest, he added, "There's something I need to discuss regarding my son."

That gave her pause. Despite herself, she wanted to know more about the boy.

Sliding into the passenger seat, Evelyn watched the cityscape blur past through tinted windows.

The charged silence broke when Alexander asked mockingly, "So tell me, future aunt, how did you and my uncle meet?"

Knowing he'd been investigating her, Evelyn answered breezily, "Online. Love at first sight."

"Really?" His skeptical smile didn't reach his eyes. "What exactly attracted you to him?"

"Everything. His maturity, reliability, that quiet strength." She counted off on her fingers. "Not to mention he's devastatingly handsome. I'm the luckiest woman alive."

The car jerked to a sudden stop at a red light.

Evelyn looked up to find Alexander's smoldering gaze locked onto her.

Leaning dangerously close, his breath warm against her cheek, he murmured, "And what do you think of me?"

Just as Evelyn opened her mouth to respond, his phone rang.

Scowling at the interruption, Alexander's expression shifted when he saw the caller ID.

"Mr. Blackwood? Your DNA results are ready. I'm emailing the report now. Please call if you have questions."
###Chapter 243

The moment the words reached his ears, Alexander's grip on the phone tightened.

Property of NovelDrama.Org.

After ending the call, he opened the email app on his phone. His breath hitched when he saw the test results staring back at him. His thumb hovered over the screen, trembling slightly, but he couldn’t bring himself to tap it.

Honk! Honk!

The impatient blare of car horns snapped him back to reality. The traffic light had turned green, and the vehicles behind him were growing restless.

"Are you alright, Mr. Blackwood?" Vivian studied him with curious eyes.

Alexander locked his phone and tossed it onto the passenger seat. "I'm fine."

His foot pressed down on the accelerator, but his dark, intense gaze lingered on her for a heartbeat too long before he forced himself to focus on the road.

Vivian had only gotten into his car because she wanted to learn more about Ethan. But after that phone call, the atmosphere inside the vehicle had turned suffocating, thick with unspoken tension.

When they arrived at the kindergarten, Vivian hurried inside to pick up Amelia, but Ethan was nowhere to be seen. The teacher informed her that someone had already taken him home.

Disappointment settled heavily in her chest.

A darker thought crept in—what if Victoria had taken him? Would she hurt him again?

Alexander stood a few feet away, watching mother and daughter as they disappeared into the evening shadows. His lips pressed into a thin line.

A thousand possibilities raced through his mind, each more terrifying than the last. That was why he refused to open the email. He wasn’t ready to face the truth—not if it shattered the fragile hope he’d been clinging to.

No matter how impossible it seemed, he wanted to believe the woman standing before him was her.

Just as the thought crossed his mind, a sleek black car pulled up beside them. Sebastian stepped out, effortlessly scooping Amelia into his arms. After exchanging a few words with Vivian, he turned to Alexander with a polite smile.

"Alexander, thank you for bringing Vivian to pick up Amelia."

Alexander met his gaze head-on, his voice sharp. "No thanks needed. I only did it to get closer to her."

His blunt admission carried an edge of defiance, daring Sebastian to challenge him.

Sebastian merely chuckled. "Still convinced Vivian is Evelyn?"

"Isn’t she?" Alexander countered, searching Sebastian’s expression for any flicker of deception.

But the man’s composure was unshakable.

"Vivian isn’t Evelyn," Sebastian said smoothly. "Evelyn is gone. You know that. Even if she were alive, why would she be with me if she loved you? Vivian even gave me a daughter."

The words struck like a knife, twisting deeper with every syllable.

Sebastian’s tone was calm, almost casual, but to Alexander, it felt like a taunt—a reminder that Sebastian had what he could never reclaim.

And he still had no proof.

"Vivian and I are getting married soon," Sebastian added. "I’ll announce it at the Blackwood Estate in a few days."

With that, he turned and walked back to Vivian, who was waiting by the car.

"Vivian, let’s go home."

"Okay." She nodded, leaning into him with an ease that made Alexander’s chest ache.

She threw a casual glance over her shoulder, offering him a perfunctory wave before slipping into the car.

In an instant, she was gone—her smile, her warmth, everything.

Inside the car, Vivian exhaled shakily. "He suspects me again."

"Of course he does," Sebastian murmured, taking her hand. His thumb brushed over her knuckles soothingly. "You look exactly like her. And Alexander? He notices everything."

His reassuring smile softened the worry in her eyes. "Don’t worry. I’ve arranged everything. In a few days, he’ll have no reason to doubt you."

Vivian relaxed slightly at his words.

Sebastian had been her anchor in the storm, the one who pulled her from the depths of despair.

She owed him everything.

And when he had mentioned marriage earlier, she hadn’t refused.

Because how could she?
###Chapter 244

After the heartbreak of her failed marriage, Evelyn Sinclair vowed never to love again. Yet if fate gave her another chance, she might just take it.

...

Alexander Blackwood strode into Blackwood Estate with his phone gripped tightly in hand. The answers he sought were just one tap away.

But the scene in the kitchen stopped him cold.

Victoria Lancaster stood at the stove, surrounded by maids guiding her through dinner preparations. The domestic tableau sent a sharp pang through Alexander's chest.

Memories of Evelyn flooded his mind - how she used to cook for him every evening, only for him to reject her efforts. He'd rather spend nights anywhere but home, avoiding the woman he'd wrongly believed to be deceitful.

"Alexander!" Victoria's voice snapped him back to the present. She rushed to him, eyes shining. "You're home! I picked up Ethan and made dinner especially for you both. It's my first time cooking, so be kind."

Her gaze turned pleading. "Alexander, Mother received an invitation to Lady Belle's anniversary gala. Will you accompany me?"

His brows drew together. "I'm unavailable."

"Alexander." Her smile faltered. "Are you still punishing me? That incident was months ago! I was manipulated by Evelyn. How can you be so cruel over something so trivial?"

"Trivial?" A humorless smile twisted Alexander's lips, his expression unreadable. His voice dropped to an icy timbre. "I'll make a public announcement soon - our engagement is over."

Victoria's face paled. She grabbed his arm desperately. "Alexander, please! You promised! That day at the beach, you swore to take care of me forever!"

The memory gave Alexander pause. He couldn't act rashly without considering their shared history.

After a heavy silence, he spoke coldly. "I'll provide for you. But I won't marry you."

"Why?" Victoria's voice broke. "Why are you doing this?" Her composure shattered as she clung to him.

"Is it Vivian? Do you feel guilty about Evelyn, so now you're transferring that debt to her lookalike?"

"This has nothing to do with her." Alexander's sharp gaze pinned Victoria's distraught face. "You want reasons? Look in the mirror."

"Alexander!"

"The Victoria I married was kind and pure. You've changed. You're not the woman I fell for."

Victoria stood frozen as his expression hardened further.

Changed? No. The truth was far worse.

She'd never been that woman to begin with.

Alexander peeled her fingers from his arm and turned away.

"Alexander!" Victoria threw her arms around his waist from behind. "Please don't do this! Yes, I've changed - I love you more now! I was terrified Evelyn would steal you through marriage. I was desperate!" Tears streamed down her cheeks. "If I become that Victoria again, will you take me back?"

Alexander offered no response, forcibly removing her hands.

Her pleas followed him up the stairs, but he didn't look back. The bedroom door closed firmly behind him.

The king-sized bed held no trace of Evelyn, yet Alexander automatically sat on her former side. With trembling fingers, he opened the email containing the DNA results.

Amelia's test. His answer.

This time, he didn't hesitate before clicking.
###Chapter 245

Alexander's eyes locked onto the professional DNA analysis report displayed on his screen. His fingers flew across the keyboard, scrolling past pages of technical data straight to the conclusive results.

The air left his lungs in one sharp exhale.

Every lingering doubt, every foolish hope he'd secretly harbored shattered in that instant.

The report confirmed without question - he was not Amelia's biological father.

Yet their chromosomal match was undeniable. There existed only one possible explanation for such identical genetic markers.

Amelia was truly Sebastian's daughter. That's why their DNA showed familial connection.

His phone clattered onto the marble floor unnoticed.

Golden sunset light painted his frozen expression. After what felt like an eternity, Alexander's lips twisted into a bitter smile.

"So there really are people who look this alike in the world."

"The truth remains - you're gone from me forever."

The familiar ache returned, that gaping wound from three years ago that would never fully heal. The regret, the loss - permanent scars on his soul.

Evelyn moved through her preparations with renewed confidence, certain Alexander's suspicions had been laid to rest. Her focus now centered entirely on the upcoming gala dinner in two days.

The most prestigious venue in Willowbrook was undoubtedly the six-star hotel owned by Blackwood Enterprises. Evelyn had already secured the reservation. Just as she stepped out to finalize the contract, she spotted Victoria approaching her boutique.

The usually composed socialite looked uncharacteristically distressed, her delicate features drawn with worry rather than the venomous expression she'd worn after dropping her carefully constructed facade.

"Miss Prescott," Victoria hurried forward, "might I have a moment of your time? There's something important we need to discuss."

Evelyn regarded the woman before her with undisguised contempt. "We have nothing to discuss, Miss Lancaster."

She turned to leave.

"Please, Vivian!" Victoria's voice cracked with desperation. "Just five minutes of your time."

Evelyn paused, glancing back over her shoulder. "Since you're begging so prettily, Miss Lancaster, you have ten minutes."

"Thank you," Victoria murmured, though the gratitude rang hollow to Evelyn's ears.

In a nearby café, Victoria ordered refreshments with practiced charm, maintaining her fragile smile throughout.

"Spit it out, Miss Lancaster," Evelyn said bluntly, setting her phone on the table. "I have business to attend to."

Victoria's hands clenched beneath the table at Evelyn's dismissive tone. "Vivian, you must understand...you look exactly like my late sister Evelyn. But I'm begging you - don't repeat her mistakes."

Evelyn's lips curved into a dangerous smile. "And what mistakes would those be, exactly?"

Victoria sighed dramatically. "I'm asking you to stop pursuing my fiancé."

"You're an accomplished woman, Miss Prescott. With your beauty, your successful boutique under the Lady Belle franchise...surely you have better options than becoming the other woman?"

Ah. So that was Victoria's game - poisoning the well.

"The other woman?" Evelyn nearly choked on the irony.

Before she could respond, Victoria's eyes welled with crocodile tears. "Please don't destroy what Alexander and I have. And don't ruin your own reputation. Once branded a homewrecker, that stain never fades."

Evelyn threw her head back with genuine laughter. "Homewrecker?" Her piercing gaze pinned Victoria in place. "How remarkably bold of you to say that to my face, Miss Lancaster. Tell me - does your reflection still recognize you?"
###Chapter 246

Victoria's face froze when she heard those words. Yet, she maintained her fragile, pitiful expression, her voice trembling as if on the verge of tears. "Miss Prescott, are you implying you'll continue pursuing my fiancé and remain the other woman?"

Vivian parted her lips, speaking deliberately. "Do you know why I gifted you a mirror on your birthday?"

Victoria's expression darkened.

"You still don’t understand your place," Vivian continued, a knowing smile playing on her lips. "No wonder Alexander still hasn’t married you after all these years." With that, she rose gracefully and turned to leave.

Victoria shot to her feet, her façade crumbling. "Vivian Prescott! I offered you kindness, and you spat on it! Fine! Just wait—you'll regret crossing me!"

Vivian glanced back, unfazed. Seeing Victoria’s fury only deepened her smile. "Hurry it up, then. I can’t wait." She tightened her grip on her phone.

Exactly.

She couldn’t wait.

Come at me, Victoria.

I’m ready for whatever you throw my way.

The moment Vivian left the café, Victoria stormed into an adjacent room.

"Well? Did you get it?" she snapped.

The person inside shook their phone. "Every second recorded."

Victoria exhaled, her sinister gaze narrowing.

"Hmph. Vivian Prescott, since you refuse to back down, I’ll destroy your reputation completely. You’ll suffer exactly what Evelyn did!"

Vivian headed straight to the hotel after leaving the café.

She hadn’t expected Alexander to be the one waiting for her.

More surprisingly, his gaze held none of the suspicion from before.

Perhaps Sebastian had succeeded in dissuading him.

Naturally, Vivian didn’t mention her encounter with Victoria. She focused solely on the tasks at hand.

Later, Alexander spoke up. "Miss Prescott, would you honor me with lunch? Consider it a taste test."

Vivian agreed, following him into the VIP room.

The third-floor view wasn’t towering, but the breeze rustled the branches outside the French windows. Golden leaves spiraled like butterflies, drifting past the glass in silent elegance.

Early autumn carried a crispness after summer’s heat.

Alexander poured wine for them both. Soon, a faint flush colored his cheeks, his sharp eyes turning even more mesmerizing.

"You shouldn’t overindulge, Mr. Blackwood," Vivian teased lightly. "Unless you want to ramble nonsense at me again like last time. I’d rather not hear those words repeated."

Alexander met her gaze. "What did I say that night?"

Vivian lifted her glass, pausing before answering cryptically, "You grabbed me and said, ‘Lillian, don’t go.’"

The moment the words left her lips, she caught a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes.

Her pulse stuttered. She took a quick sip of wine to mask her unease.

That night, he’d called her Lillian. Even knowing he meant Victoria, a part of her had ached for it to be her. Years ago, at the beach, he’d been the one to shield her—

Alexander lowered his gaze, veiling his thoughts. "And what else?"

Vivian studied him. "Just that. Over and over—‘Lillian, don’t go.’ Who is she? I thought Victoria was the love of your life, Mr. Blackwood?"

She posed the question deliberately, then added, "Oh, and you were clutching a seashell. Not particularly valuable, yet you held it like a lifeline. Why?"
###Chapter 247

A trace of anguish flickered across Alexander's slightly inebriated face. "It's her."

After a prolonged silence, Evelyn finally received his answer.

It was her.

The woman he loved most was Victoria.

Evelyn's fingers tightened around the wine glass.

The flames of fury roared to life in her chest, yet they couldn't scorch away the bitterness clawing at her heart.

"Linnie, I'll never leave you. I'll protect you forever. I'll make you my bride—"

The little boy's promise was like the autumn wind outside the window—brushing past her ear before vanishing into nothingness.

Evelyn raised the glass and drained it in one swift motion.

A thousand needles pricked at her heart. Light, yet excruciating.

She grieved for her younger self—so naïve, so trusting. She had waited like a fool, believing in his vow. And what had she gotten in return? Nothing but his merciless cruelty.

Her icy gaze settled on the brooding man before her, hatred burning in her eyes.

Alexander, I thought you were just ruthless—never satisfied with what you had. But the truth is, you were never serious about me.

You keep clinging to Linnie, but it's all just an act.

Victoria Lancaster.

You love her, don't you?

Fine.

Then I'll make sure you love her until it destroys you.

—

Alexander didn’t know when he had dozed off on the sofa. When he woke, the room was empty—Evelyn was gone.

He rubbed his temples, fragments of their conversation resurfacing in his mind.

His fingers closed around the multicolored shell in his pocket, its smooth surface cool against his palm.

Memories flooded back—

His grandfather had taken him to the seaside for a holiday, but the weight of expectations had crushed any joy he might have felt.

Until she appeared.

A little girl who called herself Linnie.

Such a simple name—sweet, easy to remember.

He never forgot her.

Her crescent-moon eyes when she smiled, the faint dimples in her cheeks, the crystalline clarity of her gaze—so full of life.

She called him Lex. Her voice was honeyed, warm.

Hand in hand, they ran barefoot along the shore. Without realizing it, he had shed his burdens.

For the first time, he was truly happy.

Then his grandfather whisked him away without warning—no chance to say goodbye.

For years, he thought of her.

Until he met Victoria.

Victoria had dimples too, and that resemblance tricked him. When she claimed to be his Linnie, he believed her—though something always felt... missing.

Still, he indulged her. Protected her. All because she was the girl he had longed for.

Now—

Alexander clenched the shell.

He should throw it away.

The girl who gave it to him no longer held his heart.

The Linnie he loved now was Evelyn—the woman who had hurt him so deeply it felt like flaying.
###Chapter 248

The grand anniversary dinner of Lady Belle proceeded as scheduled in Willowbrook.

With the brand's growing prestige, the elite of high society had gathered - social butterflies and wealthy heiresses mingling beneath crystal chandeliers.

Vivian Prescott stood ready in her suite, yet an unexpected heaviness settled in her chest.

Eleanor Kingsley would be present tonight.

The woman who birthed her, then abandoned her.

Taking a steadying breath, Vivian entered the glittering ballroom on Diamond Boulevard.

The scene unfolded before her - clusters of society women admiring each other's exclusive jewelry pieces, their laughter tinkling like champagne flutes.

All conversation ceased momentarily when Vivian made her entrance.

Her golden satin gown hugged every curve, the plunging back revealing flawless porcelain skin. Raven locks cascaded down her shoulders, framing features so striking they seemed carved from marble. A delicate trail of jasmine perfume followed her every move.

"Is that Vivian Prescott?"

"The new boutique owner on Diamond Boulevard? The one collaborating with Lady Belle?"

"Stunning and successful. Quite the combination."

"Successful? Rumor has it she's some tycoon's kept woman."

"Ah, that explains how a nobody landed such a prime location. Probably why she's making her debut tonight."

The venomous whispers slithered through the crowd. Vivian merely arched a brow and glided forward.

Then she saw them.

The Lady Belle executives were entertaining clients - among them, Victoria Lancaster and Eleanor Kingsley.

As if sensing her presence, the design director turned. "Ladies, may I present-"

"Ugh, it's her." Eleanor's lip curled as she cut in. "Victoria darling, let's find another table. The sight of certain women ruins my appetite."

The words struck like shards of glass, yet Vivian's smile never wavered.

This cruel woman bore no resemblance to the nurturing mother she'd imagined all these years.

"Mother, don't be unkind," Victoria simpered, eyes glinting maliciously. "Miss Prescott must have worked very hard to join Lady Belle. Though I did hear their vetting process is... thorough."

The executives exchanged puzzled glances. "Is there some issue with Miss Prescott we should know about?"

"Absolutely!" Eleanor snapped. "It's disgraceful that Lady Belle would associate with trash like her. Those delicate jewels deserve better hands than hers!"

Victoria barely concealed her glee as murmurs spread through the crowd. Perfect - just the audience she needed for what came next.

The executives' expressions darkened, but Vivian merely tilted her head. "Mrs. Kingsley, if I'm unworthy, would your precious daughter be more suitable-"

"Thief!" A shrill voice cut through the tension.

Vivian turned toward the familiar voice just as bony fingers clamped around her wrist.

"My amethyst bracelet! You stole it again!" The woman - Beatrice Thornton - shook Vivian's arm violently. "First at the Kingsleys' gala, now here! Last time Margaret Blackwood defended you, but tonight you're going straight to the police!"
###Chapter 249

The woman's shrill screams pierced through the air, drawing the attention of everyone nearby.

Evelyn Sinclair lifted her gaze to meet the haughty face before her. Instantly, the memory of being falsely accused of theft resurfaced with painful clarity.

That day, after receiving her diagnosis, she had been forced to attend Margaret Blackwood's birthday party at Blackwood Estate by Alexander's orders.

The moment she stepped inside, this very woman had collided with her—then turned the tables, accusing Evelyn of bumping into her and stealing her bracelet.

Victoria Lancaster had "graciously" intervened, only to secretly slip the bracelet into Evelyn's pocket. Weak and defenseless, Evelyn had been branded a thief, humiliated despite her protests.

The worst part? When Sebastian Whitman provided proof of her innocence, Alexander had destroyed it without hesitation. His love for Victoria knew no bounds—even at Evelyn's expense.

She hadn't forgotten. This woman had called her a beggar, while Victoria had sweetly addressed her as Mrs. Harrington.

"What are you staring at? Give me back my bracelet!" Beatrice Harrington snarled, her grip tightening around Evelyn's wrist.

Evelyn's lips curved into a cold smile. "Remove your hand."

Her voice was calm, but the authority in it made Beatrice hesitate. For a second, her fingers loosened—then clenched again, defiance flashing in her eyes.

"You dare threaten me?" Beatrice scoffed, looking Evelyn up and down with disdain. "Look at you. Dressed like this, yet still stealing at a high-society event?"

She sneered. "Or did some foolish rich man take pity on you? If so, why resort to thievery?"

"Madam, you're mistaken," the manager interjected, stepping forward. "Why would Vivian steal from you? Release her at once."

Cassandra Wright, Lady Belle's head designer, rushed to Evelyn's side. "You're making baseless accusations! Do you even realize that bracelet—"

"How dare you defend her?" Beatrice cut in sharply. "Miss Lancaster witnessed the theft herself!"

Her gaze flicked to the side, where Margaret Blackwood stood. "Mrs. Blackwood, you were there too. You even begged me to spare her—said she was your maid. You must vouch for me now!"

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

So that was what Margaret had whispered to Beatrice that day.

Maid.

How laughable.

To the Blackwoods, she had never been family.

Not even a servant.

Less than nothing.

"Vivian Prescott was the Blackwoods' maid?"

"No wonder she's dressed so well now—she must have stolen from them."

"If Lady Belle hires thieves, maybe I should reconsider my patronage."

Whispers slithered through the crowd, venomous and cruel.

Evelyn's smile didn't waver.

But her eyes turned to ice.
###Chapter 250

The murmurs of disapproval swirled around her like a toxic fog. Victoria leaned in close to Eleanor, whispering malicious words that curled her lips into a smirk.

After a moment, Victoria sauntered over. She sighed dramatically, eyeing Evelyn with thinly veiled contempt. "Miss Prescott, I'm shocked. You may share Evelyn's face, but I never expected you to inherit her sticky fingers too!"

Victoria's mocking tone dripped with disdain. "Mrs. Harrington, you're absolutely right. Someone did steal your bracelet at Blackwood Estate that night. But it wasn't this woman here. They're just doppelgängers."

"What? That's impossible! I'd recognize that face anywhere!" Mrs. Harrington jabbed a manicured finger at Evelyn's features.

"Darling, it's not her," Margaret Blackwood interjected, joining the fray with equal scorn. "Vivian, as the owner of Lady Belle, how could you sink so low? Stealing from clients? Have you lost your mind?"

"She doesn't just steal jewelry - she specializes in stealing fiancés too!" Eleanor added, her voice laced with venom as she glared at Evelyn.

The dinner party's atmosphere shifted palpably. Every gaze now pinned Evelyn with suspicion and revulsion.

Mrs. Harrington tightened her grip on Evelyn's wrist with renewed confidence. "So even if you're not the same person, you're still a thief! Disgusting! I'm calling the police!"

Her shrill voice cut through the room as she attempted to drag Evelyn away bodily.

The manager and head designer moved to intervene, but before they could, Evelyn stood firm. Not only did she refuse to budge, but with one sharp motion, she twisted free from the woman's grasp.

Mrs. Harrington stumbled backward, her heel catching on Victoria's designer shoe. Victoria shrieked in pain and shoved the older woman away furiously.

"You little—" Mrs. Harrington began to snarl.

"If you lay another finger on me," Evelyn's melodic voice sliced through the threat, "I promise the police will be arresting you, not me."

Despite the sea of accusing stares, Evelyn remained poised. Her chin lifted regally, those striking eyes cold as winter frost on her exquisite features. In that moment, she commanded the room like royalty.

"You claim I stole this?" Evelyn raised her left wrist, where the amethyst bracelet glimmered ethereally under the chandelier's glow.

Mrs. Harrington's face contorted with rage. "That's mine! That's a custom Lady Belle limited edition! I had it specially imported from Paris! There's only one in all of Willowbrook, and I wore it tonight specifically to show it off!"

Her boastful tone betrayed her true motives - this was never about theft, but vanity.

The bracelet was indeed extraordinary, its violet stones catching the light hypnotically. Many society women coveted such a piece but could never obtain it.

"No wonder Miss Prescott stole it," Victoria sneered, fanning the flames. "A one-of-a-kind piece like that would tempt anyone."

"Do you really want someone like her representing your brand?" Eleanor taunted, her gaze sweeping over the Lady Belle executives. "Keep her on, and soon all your precious jewels will carry the stench of scandal!"

"Absolutely," Margaret chimed in. "Remove her immediately, or I'll never set foot in your store again!"

Bolstered by her allies, Mrs. Harrington grew bolder. "Well? What do you have to say for yourself? Hand it over and come quietly!"

The manager and head designer exchanged glances before the latter spoke coldly: "Madam, you're partially correct. This is indeed a limited edition piece. But what you don't know is that this particular bracelet was never available for purchase."

She continued, her voice cutting through the tension: "This was designed by Lady Belle's lead designer, Vivian Prescott, as a birthday gift to herself. There exists only one in the world - the very one on her wrist right now. So tell me, why would she steal her own creation?"
###Chapter 251

The moment the manager and head designer made their announcement, the grand hall buzzed with renewed energy.

Beatrice Thornton, who had been targeting Evelyn, stood frozen in shock. Across from her, Victoria Lancaster gaped at Evelyn with undisguised disbelief. The entire room seemed to hold its breath.

"What... what did you just say?" Victoria's manicured finger trembled as she pointed at Evelyn. "You're claiming this... this woman is the chief designer of Lady Belle?"

Her voice dripped with reluctant disbelief.

The confirmation came swift and certain.

"Correct. This is Vivian Prescott, founder of Lady Belle and our chief designer."

Silence.

Then stunned gasps.

Victoria's mouth fell open as she stared at Evelyn's composed demeanor. The revelation left her speechless.

Eleanor Kingsley exchanged shocked glances with Margaret Blackwood. Neither could process what they were witnessing.

This woman had been hiding extraordinary talents!

The most coveted jewelry pieces in high society for years - all designed by her?

Impossible.

Unthinkable.

"Madam," the head designer addressed Beatrice pointedly, "why would our chief designer need to steal your bracelet? The evidence suggests you've been duped into purchasing a counterfeit."

"Counterfeit?" Beatrice shrieked, face flushing crimson. "I paid a hundred thousand for this! She's clearly the thief! You're all conspiring together!"

"So you maintain your accusation?" Evelyn arched one perfect eyebrow, voice calm as still water.

"Yes! It was you!" Beatrice jabbed an accusing finger.

"Very well." Evelyn turned to the designer. "Cassandra, contact Gregory Harrison immediately. Have him draft a defamation lawsuit."

"Right away." Cassandra moved with purpose, relief evident in her stance.

Justice would be served.

Beatrice paled. She hadn't anticipated this counterattack. "How dare you sue me? You're the criminal here! You—"

"Darling? Didn't you want to show your bracelet?" A suited man approached, holding an amethyst bracelet identical to Evelyn's.

Except his lacked the luminous quality. The difference between genuine and fake became painfully obvious.

Beatrice's face cycled through shades of red. "Why do you have—"

"You asked me to hold it, remember? I couldn't find you after the restroom." His confused tone sealed her humiliation.

The crowd's murmurs grew louder. Those who had doubted Evelyn now directed scornful looks at Beatrice. Even Victoria's allies shifted uncomfortably.

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Professionally speaking? Your imitation isn't worth four figures."

Beatrice's eyes bulged. Her face drained of color. The prized possession she'd flaunted - worthless costume jewelry?

As whispers of ridicule spread, Beatrice turned to flee.

"You'll leave after false accusations? Without apology?"

An icy voice cut through the murmurs like winter wind.

Beatrice froze.

Before her stood a devastatingly handsome man, his presence commanding the room's attention.
###Chapter 252

Sebastian Whitman stood impeccably dressed in a custom-tailored suit, his usual composed demeanor replaced by visible fury. The icy rage in his eyes contrasted sharply with his typically unreadable aristocratic features.

"Apologize to my fiancée immediately," he commanded, his voice dangerously low. "Or this won't end with just a lawsuit."

The socialite trembled under his glacial stare, though she didn't recognize the powerful man before her.

Vivian Prescott moved gracefully to Sebastian's side, slipping her arm through his with natural intimacy. "It's alright, Sebastian. I don't need her hollow apology. The truth is clear now."

Sebastian turned to her, his expression softening. "I won't tolerate anyone slandering you, Vivian. Not a single word against you will go unchallenged."

His protective declaration sent whispers through the crowd. Several young debutantes sighed dreamily at his devotion.

Victoria Lancaster's nails dug into her palms as jealousy burned through her. This woman who looked identical to Evelyn Sinclair was stealing the spotlight yet again.

"Are you waiting for a police escort before apologizing?" Sebastian's voice cut through the murmurs like winter wind.

The accused woman stammered out frantic apologies. "I-I was mistaken! Please forgive my error!"

Three years. Vivian hadn't expected to receive this belated justice. If Alexander Blackwood hadn't been so cruel back then...

Her thoughts scattered as she caught Victoria's venomous glare. The other woman quickly averted her eyes.

Just as the socialite tried to flee, Sebastian stopped her again. "Your apology isn't complete."

The woman froze in confusion.

"You claimed someone resembling my fiancée stole your bracelet at the Blackwoods' gala, correct?"

"Y-yes! It's only because they look so alike! I would never mistake your fiancée for that thief otherwise!"

Sebastian's aristocratic features hardened. "That 'maid' was Alexander Blackwood's wife, Evelyn Sinclair. And the real thief..." His piercing gaze landed on Victoria. "...was her."

Gasps erupted through the crowd. All eyes turned to Victoria, who stood frozen like a startled doe.

Victoria's face paled, but she maintained her saintly composure. "Mr. Whitman, even as Alexander's uncle, how dare you accuse me like this? I've never stolen anything!"

"You framed Evelyn for Beatrice Thornton's missing bracelet." Sebastian recounted the events with chilling precision. "Many witnesses from that night are here tonight. Then you amplified the scandal online, forcing Evelyn to endure public humiliation."

"Preposterous!" Eleanor Kingsley stormed forward. "Sebastian, how dare you slander my daughter like this? I won't let this stand!"

"Mother..." Victoria clung to Eleanor's arm, tears welling. "I don't understand why my future uncle would attack me like this!"

Margaret Blackwood joined the defense. "Are you dredging up old scandals just because your fiancée resembles Evelyn?"

Sebastian's eyes darkened dangerously. "You're correct - I am reopening old wounds. But only to clear Evelyn's name once and for all."

Victoria forced a brittle laugh. "Mr. Whitman, you're seriously accusing me without proof?"

"The proof is right here." Sebastian produced a sleek tablet. "Let's see who's truly guilty."
###Chapter 253

The moment Sebastian's words echoed through the grand hall, a wave of murmurs swept through the crowd.

Victoria's breath hitched. The smug confidence that had been plastered on her face moments ago froze into something brittle.

A video?

What video?

What is Sebastian talking about?

Did someone actually record me planting that bracelet on Evelyn that night?

No. Impossible.

If he had proof, he would’ve exposed me long ago.

Her racing thoughts steadied her nerves. She forced a composed smile, tilting her chin up.

"Sebastian, lies won’t hold up under scrutiny. I’ve done nothing wrong, so I have nothing to fear from whatever fabricated footage you’re about to show."

"Victoria, I believe you!" Eleanor clutched her daughter’s hand, her gaze brimming with unwavering faith.

Sebastian’s lips curled into a cold smirk. "Let’s see if you’ll still be so bold after this."

Victoria’s pulse stuttered.

With a sharp gesture, Sebastian signaled his assistant. The lights dimmed, and the massive LED screen flickered to life.

The footage was crisp, damning.

Three years ago, Evelyn had rushed into Blackwood Estate, her face pale, her clothes disheveled. The moment she stepped inside, Beatrice Harrington—then a haughty socialite—collided with her.

Beatrice didn’t just bump into Evelyn. She shoved her, then pointed an accusatory finger, her shrill voice ringing out.

Evelyn, visibly unwell, didn’t retaliate.

Then came the moment that shattered the room into stunned silence.

Beatrice grabbed Evelyn, screeching about a stolen bracelet.

And there—clear as day—Victoria slipped the very bracelet into Evelyn’s coat pocket.

The way she then "discovered" it, feigning shock and betrayal, was nothing short of theatrical.

Evelyn’s desperate protests fell on deaf ears.

The crowd had branded her a thief.

Even now, watching it again, Evelyn felt the sting of humiliation, the weight of injustice.

But more than that—vindication.

The lights returned. Evelyn lifted her chin, her gaze locking onto Victoria’s ashen face.

"So this is the Evelyn Sinclair who supposedly looked just like me," she mused, voice dripping with mock sympathy. "How tragic, to be betrayed by her own sister."

Victoria’s fingers twitched, her composure cracking.

"Miss Lancaster," Evelyn continued, tilting her head, "your performance was truly Oscar-worthy. Everyone else in that video? Mere extras compared to you."

Victoria’s jaw clenched.

Beatrice, ever the opportunist, gasped dramatically. "Victoria! Why would you frame an innocent woman? And using me? I never did anything to you!"

The whispers grew louder.

"That woman was Mr. Blackwood’s ex-wife?"

"I was there that night. I thought she was guilty."

"Victoria Lancaster, the perfect socialite, pulling this?"

"She looks so delicate. Who knew she had such venom in her?"

Victoria couldn’t take it anymore. "That video is fake!" she cried, her voice trembling. "That’s not Evelyn! It’s Vivian! I swear on my life, I would never do something so vile!"

Tears welled in her eyes—crocodile tears.

She turned, burying her face in Eleanor’s shoulder.

But the damage was done.

The truth was out.
###Chapter 254

"Mother, you must believe me! That footage is completely fabricated!" Victoria turned pleading eyes toward Eleanor Kingsley after her desperate declaration. "Mrs. Blackwood, surely you know Vivian's true nature. Why would I ever harm her? She's never been virtuous to begin with!"

"Victoria, darling, don't distress yourself. I believe you." Eleanor didn't hesitate for even a second before siding with her daughter. Her gaze then turned venomous as it landed on Vivian and Sebastian. "Sebastian Whitman, how dare you publicly slander my daughter like this! You won't escape consequences for this defamation!"

"Your daughter?" Sebastian scoffed derisively. "Just because she's your flesh and blood, you'll turn blind to even the most heinous crimes?"

"You—"

"The evidence is clear for all to see. Everyone present can judge its authenticity. Victoria claims this was recent footage, so answer me this—if Vivian was impersonating Evelyn in the video, then who is that woman who looks identical to you? And who impersonated all these guests and Alexander's mother?"

Victoria's lips parted but no words came out under Sebastian's relentless questioning.

She had exhausted all possible excuses to deceive the gathered crowd.

The simple truth was—Sebastian spoke undeniable facts.

"Enough!" Eleanor's face flushed crimson with rage. "Vivian stole Victoria's fiancé and has been tormenting her relentlessly. She got exactly what she deserved! This has nothing to do with my daughter! That wretched girl deserved to be framed—who told her to have such a vile character?"

"So truth means nothing to you, Mrs. Kingsley?" Vivian's melodious voice cut through the tension. "All that matters is your daughter can do no wrong, is that it?"

Eleanor glared at her with undisguised contempt. "What business is this of yours?"

"None whatsoever. I merely pity Evelyn. Even in death, she bears the weight of crimes she didn't commit." Vivian's gaze locked onto Eleanor's with unsettling intensity.

"Mrs. Kingsley, you're so fiercely protective of your daughter, but have you considered Evelyn had parents too? Imagine their heartbreak learning of the injustices she suffered. Or perhaps... if Evelyn had been your daughter—"

"I would never have raised such a shameless creature!"

Eleanor's words struck Vivian like a dagger to the heart.

Her earlier claims of indifference had been lies.

The pain still cut deep.

"Victoria, I'll stand by you no matter what. Pay these people no mind. We're leaving!"

Eleanor gripped Victoria's hand tightly, shooting Vivian one last disgusted look before turning to leave.

Vivian pressed her lips together, fighting back the stinging tears threatening to spill.

Just as the mother-daughter pair reached the edge of the crowd, they froze abruptly.

"A-Alexander?" Victoria's eyes widened in shock at the man who'd materialized from nowhere amidst the spectators. Her voice trembled, "Alexander, what are you doing here? H-how long have you been standing there?"

Alexander didn't immediately respond. Instead, his long strides carried him purposefully toward Vivian.

His movements exuded effortless grace, every inch the commanding aristocrat. An icy aura surrounded his strikingly handsome yet expressionless face.

Vivian maintained her poised stance, though internally she was thrown into turmoil watching his approach.

Alexander's intense gaze never wavered from her. His piercing eyes held swirling depths that threatened to pull her under if she looked too long.

Sensing danger, Victoria released Eleanor's hand and rushed to intercept Alexander, clutching his arm desperately.

"Alexander, let me explain—"

"No explanations necessary." His voice was glacial.

"Alexander—"

"With Willowbrook's elite and press all gathered here, this presents a perfect opportunity." His strange, unreadable eyes remained fixed on Vivian. "Miss Prescott, you don't object to me making an announcement on your turf, do you?"
###Chapter 255

"Go ahead, Mr. Blackwood." Evelyn smiled calmly. "I'm just as curious as everyone else about what you're going to announce."

Alexander curved his lips into a seductive smirk. "Patience," he murmured before glancing at Sebastian, who stood protectively behind Evelyn. Then, he turned to face the crowd and the flashing cameras of the media.

Victoria's heart pounded violently in her chest. She realized with horror that Alexander might be about to publicly dissolve their marriage. Desperation clawed at her as she grabbed his arm, her voice trembling.

"Alexander, please—that video is fake! Don't believe it. Don't do this. I can't lose you. Please..."

Her whisper was barely audible, but he heard every word.

Alexander lowered his dark, piercing gaze to hers. "You don't need to explain anything to me. I saw that video three years ago."

Victoria's face drained of color. "W-What?"

He had known all this time?

And yet, he had never confronted her.

That meant he had chosen to stand by her despite everything.

A flicker of hope ignited in her chest.

"Alexander, if you knew, then you must still trust me. Please, don't make that announcement. I need you..." Her voice cracked, her beautiful face twisting into a pitiful plea.

For a moment, Alexander studied her—her pleading eyes, her trembling lips. Then, unbidden, an image of Lillian flashed through his mind.

Without another word, he pulled his arm free and faced the crowd again.

"Everyone, I hereby declare that my marriage to the daughter of the Lancasters is now cance—"

Thud.

"Victoria! Oh God, Victoria!"

Before Alexander could finish his sentence, Victoria collapsed dramatically at his feet.

Eleanor rushed forward, sobbing hysterically. "Alexander, what are you waiting for?! Get her to the hospital now!"

Margaret Blackwood hurried over, shoving her son urgently. "Alexander, move!"

Evelyn couldn't see Alexander's expression, but she watched as he scooped Victoria into his arms and strode swiftly toward the exit.

The room erupted into murmurs—some shocked, some speculative.

Evelyn's lips curled into a bitter smile.

Then, a warm hand settled on her shoulder. She looked up into Sebastian's comforting gaze.

"Don't let it hurt you," he murmured. "If your parents knew the truth, they'd regret every moment they failed to see you."

Evelyn exhaled softly. "Sebastian, thank you. Even if I never get to reclaim my place in their lives, at least I've cleared my name."

"What will you do now?" he asked gently.

A dangerous glint flickered in Evelyn's eyes as she stared in the direction Alexander had disappeared. "I need to know which hospital they took her to."

Half an hour later.

Evelyn pulled her coat tighter as she stepped into the hospital.

As she approached the inpatient ward, she spotted William Montgomery rushing into the elevator, his face etched with worry.

Of course. Even now, they all still doted on Victoria.

But Evelyn knew better. She had seen Victoria's "fainting" act too many times before.

She reached the corridor outside Victoria's room just as Alexander stepped out.

His striking features were unreadable, but the tension in his jaw and the shadow in his eyes betrayed his concern.

For her.

Again.
###Chapter 256

Evelyn let out a soft chuckle before stepping forward.

Alexander froze when he saw her. His expression shifted to one of surprise. "What are you doing here?"

"Don’t you want to see me, Mr. Blackwood?" Evelyn asked, her smile carefully crafted. Then, she added, "Though, to be honest, I’m not here for Victoria. I’m here for you."

Alexander’s eyes darkened. Under the dim hospital lights, her smile seemed almost dangerous. He stepped closer, his voice low. "Come with me."

Without warning, his fingers closed around her wrist, his touch ice-cold. She didn’t pull away—but this time, there was no lingering reluctance.

He led her to the rooftop, where the night stretched out in eerie silence.

Stars dotted the sky, shimmering like scattered diamonds. The autumn wind whispered between them, cool and restless.

"Why bring me up here?" Evelyn tilted her head, studying his unreadable expression.

Moonlight painted his sharp features in silver, his gaze distant. When he didn’t answer, she turned to leave.

His hand shot out, stopping her. "Stay."

The word was quiet. Almost pleading.

Evelyn’s lips curved slightly. She had learned long ago—sometimes, you had to yield to win.

"Stay with you?"

She turned back, meeting his intense stare.

For a long moment, neither spoke. Then Alexander released her, moving to the edge of the rooftop. He lit a cigarette, the flame flickering before the wind snuffed it out, leaving only the faint scent of tobacco.

Evelyn watched him. His tall frame looked almost fragile under the moonlight—like a man carrying too much weight.

"How is your fiancée?" she finally asked.

Alexander exhaled slowly. "She’s not my fiancée anymore. I won’t marry her."

Evelyn laughed softly. "I don’t believe you. Sebastian told me how much you adore Victoria. Enough to destroy anyone who stood in her way—even your own wife. You must have been relieved when Evelyn died, right, Mr. Blackwood?"

"Relieved?"

His low chuckle sent a shiver down her spine. It was impossible to tell if he was amused or furious.

Then he turned, his gaze trailing from her face down to the delicate curve of her collarbone, barely visible beneath her nightgown.

He crushed the cigarette beneath his shoe and closed the distance between them.

Suddenly, his palm slammed against the wall behind her, caging her in.

They were so close she could feel his breath—warm, tinged with tobacco—against her skin. His eyes burned into hers, dark and possessive.

He wasn’t drunk, but there was something reckless in his stare.

"Why do you care so much about my ex-wife?"

Evelyn kept her voice steady. "Maybe because I look like her."

His fingers brushed her cheek, startling her. She tried to pull away, but his grip tightened—just enough to hold her in place.

Her pulse raced as his warmth seeped into her skin. "Mr. Blackwood, what are you doing?"

His thumb traced her jawline. "Something I never did with her."
###Chapter 257

Alexander's warm breath caressed Evelyn's cheek. She froze, memories of his past cruelty flooding her mind.

He had been merciless. Ruthless. Every possible torment, he'd inflicted upon her.

Evelyn couldn't recall a single kindness he'd shown during their marriage.

As she lost herself in thought, she noticed Alexander leaning closer.

Her pulse quickened erratically. Anticipating a kiss, she prepared to flee when he suddenly pulled her into an embrace.

He buried his face in the crook of her neck, his entire body radiating exhaustion. This hug seemed to release pent-up tension she'd never known he carried.

Evelyn stiffened in his arms.

Her thin blouse did little to block his body heat. The warmth seeped through fabric, spreading across her skin like wildfire.

His breath tickled her ear. That familiar masculine scent invaded her senses, disrupting her breathing pattern.

Moonlight bathed them as Evelyn stared blankly at the sky.

Then the memories returned - all the pain, the betrayals.

Her racing heart stilled. The old passion was gone.

Eyes lowering, she studied the man leaning on her shoulder and pushed against his chest.

Alexander only tightened his grip. "Stay still," he murmured. "I won't hurt you."

"Mr. Blackwood, this is inappropriate. I'm to be your aunt." Evelyn emphasized the boundary between them.

Alexander lifted his piercing gaze, lips curving. "Shouldn't my future aunt comfort her nephew in distress?"

His deep voice slid over her like velvet, sending heat to her cheeks. With sudden force, she shoved him away.

Straightening her clothes, she glared. "Is this what you meant by doing something you never did with your wife?"

A bitter smile touched her lips. "You must have despised Evelyn. She bore your child, yet you never even held her like this." The words tasted like ash, though she couldn't explain the pang in her chest.

Moonlight illuminated the man she'd once loved with every fiber of her being. She'd given him everything - received nothing in return.

How pitiful.

Alexander watched her with quiet amusement. "True. I never held her this way."

"Why hold me now? Guilt over learning the truth? Trying to atone by pretending I'm her?" Evelyn's smile turned sharp. Accusation burned in her gaze.

"Alexander, do you think this absolves you? It doesn't. You helped destroy Evelyn!"

A cold wind swept between them.

Alexander frowned at her outburst. "You're unusually invested in my ex-wife."

Evelyn's breath hitched. She'd nearly revealed too much.

Tucking hair behind her ear to mask her panic, she recovered. "Perhaps because we look alike."

The excuse sounded weak even to her. Alexander's probing stare made her skin prickle.

"If you're recovered, I'll take my leave."

She turned, but Alexander caught her wrist.

His wind-chilled fingers pressed insistently against her skin, sending strange tingles up her arm.

"Vivian, I need to ask—"

A phone vibration interrupted.

Evelyn exhaled silently. Whatever question he'd planned would have been dangerous.

The secret wasn't ready to surface. Not yet.
###Chapter 258

Her carefully crafted revenge plan was finally in motion. Nothing could be allowed to interfere now.

Alexander took the call but kept his grip on Evelyn. Escape was impossible even if she wanted to.

She watched as his expression darkened. His voice turned icy. "What do you mean Ethan is missing?"

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat at the news.

'Ethan disappeared again?'

Anxiety twisted in her chest.

Before she could process it, Alexander was before her, his face stormy. "My son is gone again, but I think you can locate him."

"Me?" Shock rippled through her. Yet arguing was pointless - her pounding heart demanded she find Ethan. "I'll help you search."

"Then let's move." He released her, draping his coat over her thin dress in an unexpected gesture that left her stunned. Before she could react, he was pulling her downstairs.

En route, Evelyn texted Sebastian to explain the situation.

True to form, he supported her decision without hesitation.

The car pulled into Blackwood Estate. Normally returning to this place would flood her with memories, but now only one thought consumed her: finding Ethan.

She followed Alexander inside where a frantic maid rushed over. "Young Master Ethan was in his room! When I checked after cleaning, he'd vanished! I've searched everywhere!"

Alexander listened stone-faced before turning to Evelyn's worried expression. "He couldn't have gone far. We'll check the grounds."

"I believe he's still in the house," Evelyn said calmly, though her heart ached remembering previous times she'd found the boy - trembling violently while hugging himself.

"No, impossible! I called everywhere!" the maid protested.

Evelyn shook her head, moving purposefully upstairs despite her restrictive dress and heels - nothing would stop her from reaching Ethan.

She entered his room swiftly, her gaze landing on the attached bathroom.

Alexander followed, hearing her soft voice at the door: "Ethan, it's Vivian."

Could the boy really be there?

Alexander found the notion absurd until he entered to see Evelyn crouched on the tiles, cradling a tearful Ethan with closed eyes.

The sight shocked him. Suddenly Evelyn's suggestion about psychological help made sense.

Was his son mentally unwell?

The question hung unanswered, but relief washed over him seeing the boy safe.

Evelyn tried to leave after locating Ethan, but the child clung desperately to her. Her own heartbreak made her equally reluctant to let go.

That unfamiliar emotion decided it - she'd stay. Carrying Ethan to bed, she soothed, "Sleep now, Ethan. I'll be right here."

His wide, vulnerable eyes searched hers. "Promise, Vivian?"

"I promise." Her nod finally coaxed his eyelids shut.

Alexander returned with nightclothes. "These belonged to my ex-wife. Use them if you don't mind."

Evelyn stared at the familiar pajamas, unsettled he'd kept them.

What did that mean?

After Alexander left, she watched Ethan sleep while calling Sebastian to explain her absence.

Hanging up, she headed to shower.

Emerging later, she realized she'd forgotten the pajamas. Wrapped only in a towel, she hurried back - just as the door opened.

Instinctively clutching the towel to her chest, she met Alexander's intense gaze. What unsettled her most was how his eyes lingered on the left side of her chest...
###Chapter 259

The small mole on her left chest was the undeniable proof that she was Evelyn Sinclair.

It was a mark she had chosen to keep, believing Alexander Blackwood would never lay eyes on that part of her body again after her "resurrection."

She had returned for vengeance, not to rekindle anything with him. So, she left the mole untouched.

When she caught Alexander’s lingering gaze, she yanked the towel higher, turning her back to him sharply.

"Didn’t you think to knock before barging in?" she snapped, irritation lacing her voice.

She expected him to retreat, but instead, his footsteps grew closer. He stopped right behind her, his presence overwhelming.

"Get out," Evelyn demanded, her tone icy. She clutched the towel tighter, stepping away. The cold tiles beneath her bare feet sent a shiver up her spine.

But before she could move further, Alexander’s hand closed around her wrist.

His touch was cool, yet it ignited a fire under her skin.

"Why so nervous, Future Aunt-in-law?" His voice was low, teasing. "Afraid I’ll devour you?"

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. Her cheeks burned.

Alexander stepped closer, his warmth pressing against her back.

"Relax," he murmured. "I just have a question."

"Then ask it and let go," she hissed.

For a moment, Alexander stilled. His gaze traced the smooth, flawless skin of her shoulders, so unlike the scars that had once marred Evelyn’s body.

A sharp ache twisted in his chest.

Abruptly, he released her.

"Never mind," he said, his voice turning cold. "Thank you for finding Ethan and staying with him. I’ll repay the favor."

The door clicked shut behind him.

Evelyn exhaled, confused. One moment he was questioning her, the next—gone.

What had changed his mood so suddenly?

Shaking it off, she dressed quickly, locked the door, and slipped into bed beside Ethan.

The boy slept soundly, his delicate features peaceful.

The longer she studied him, the more she saw the resemblance to Amelia.

Siblings, sharing the same father but different mothers.

Yet, Evelyn couldn’t shake the inexplicable pull she felt toward him.

She brushed a finger over his cheek.

"Sleep well," she whispered. "I’m here."

Alexander leaned against the balcony railing, his shirt hanging open.

Smoke curled from his lips as he stared at the wedding portrait above his bed.

She had been radiant that day.

Now, all that remained was this photograph.

"Alexander, you’ll regret this."

Her words haunted him.

"I don’t know the meaning of regret," he had sneered.

Now, he scoffed at his own arrogance.

His gaze drifted toward Ethan’s room, distant and unreadable.

The cigarette between his fingers glowed, then dimmed—like the flickering emotions in his eyes.

The next morning, Evelyn helped Ethan get ready, his rare smile easing her worries.

The maid informed her Alexander had left at dawn.

So, Evelyn took Ethan to school, planning to visit Amelia afterward.

Where had Alexander gone so early?

A secluded cemetery, veiled in morning mist.

Alexander knelt before a familiar grave, placing eighty-eight roses atop it.

His fingers traced the engraved name, his voice barely a whisper.

"You must have hated me," he murmured. "When I destroyed the only proof of your innocence."
###Chapter 260

Alexander's heart clenched with unbearable agony.

The memory of Evelyn's tear-streaked face as she desperately tried to explain herself haunted him.

He felt like a monster beyond redemption.

How could he have been so cruel to the woman who loved him so deeply?

How had he only realized his feelings when it was already too late?

Now, he finally understood why Old Master Blackwood had asked that question when Evelyn mentioned divorce.

The old man had inquired if they had shared a bed after marriage.

Of course they had. Many times.

He claimed to despise her, yet he couldn't stop himself from touching her.

The truth was, he had been fighting his own emotions all along—only to recognize them when she was already gone.

Alexander exhaled shakily, his gaze falling upon the tombstone. "She looks just like you, so I keep getting confused. Last night, I held her... but I was wishing she were you."

His voice, usually so cold, now carried a tenderness he hadn't known he possessed. He closed his eyes.

"I need her to be you..."

After a long silence, he turned away, his silhouette casting a lonely shadow in the morning light.

Evelyn left the kindergarten and returned to her boutique.

It was still early, but a crowd had already gathered outside—reporters included.

Assuming this was fallout from last night's events, she slipped in through the back entrance.

The moment she sat down, her phone buzzed with a trending notification.

She tapped it open.

Sebastian's video from last night had gone viral, sparking outrage.

Netizens flooded Victoria's social media with condemnation.

The once-beloved Montgomery heiress now stood exposed for her vile deeds—an unforgivable stain on her reputation.

Many expressed sympathy for Evelyn's past self—wronged, silenced, and cyberbullied into oblivion.

Justice had come late, but at least it had come.

Evelyn scrolled through the comments, satisfaction curling through her.

"Victoria," she murmured, "this is only the beginning."

Her lips curved as she clicked into Victoria's profile, where the woman still flaunted her lavish lifestyle.

"Miss Montgomery? Let's see how long that title lasts."

Then she froze.

A family photo filled the screen—Victoria sandwiched between Eleanor and William, their eyes brimming with adoration.

Their precious princess.

Evelyn's finger hovered over the image, tracing their smiling faces.

Beneath that warmth lay the same people who had glared at her with pure hatred.

The same hands that had struck her so hard her cheek still burned at the memory.

Her chest ached.

A commotion outside snapped her back to reality. Opening time.

Employees unlocked the front doors, and the waiting crowd surged inside.

Evelyn straightened her shoulders and stepped out—chin high, posture flawless.

Gasps erupted.

"Oh my God, she's the spitting image of Mr. Blackwood's late wife!"

"No way—their vibes are totally different!"

"Exactly! Evelyn was so meek, but this woman... she radiates confidence!"

To everyone present, they might as well have been two different people.

Then—

"Evelyn!"

Olivia burst through the crowd, eyes desperate.

Evelyn blinked but quickly schooled her features. "You again. I told you, I'm not—"

"You are!" Olivia gripped her arms. "What happened? Is it amnesia? Or are you pretending not to know me?"

"Miss, I genuinely don't." Evelyn smiled politely. "I simply resemble Evelyn Sinclair."

"Fine." Olivia's expression hardened. "If you're really not her... prove it. Come with me to see someone."

Evelyn chuckled. "I'm afraid I don't have time for—"

"Evelyn."

A voice cut through the air—one that sent ice down her spine.
###Chapter 261

Evelyn's breath caught in her throat as the familiar figure emerged from the bustling crowd. For a moment, she felt her soul detach from her body.

Three years had passed, yet Nathaniel Sterling stood before her with the same piercing gaze that once made her heart flutter. His chiseled features now carried a newfound maturity that only enhanced his striking presence.

He moved toward her with deliberate steps, her reflection shimmering in his obsidian eyes. A mixture of disbelief and joy danced across his face.

"Evelyn, it's really you..." Nathaniel's voice wrapped around her like warm velvet, just as she remembered.

"You're mistaken." Evelyn arched a perfectly shaped brow, her tone dripping with irritation. "I'm not Evelyn Sinclair. If you've come to gawk at some resemblance, kindly leave. I have clients waiting." She turned sharply, allowing only the cool marble floor to witness the pain flashing across her features.

'Forgive me, Olivia. Forgive me, Nate.'

"Evelyn!" Olivia's desperate fingers closed around Evelyn's wrist. "Why are you doing this? I know it's you! Why pretend we're strangers?"

Tears glistened in Olivia's eyes as she gestured toward Nathaniel. "You claim not to know me, but what about Nate? Have you forgotten everything he did for you?"

Evelyn's gaze swept over Nathaniel's familiar face before hardening. "One final warning before I call security."

"Nate." Olivia turned pleading eyes toward Nathaniel. "We should take her to Dr. Hayes immediately. Alexander must be threatening her again."

Nathaniel studied Evelyn's tense posture, recalling every cruelty Alexander had inflicted. Determination hardened his jaw as he reached for her hand.

"Release her."

A glacial command sliced through the tension. All heads turned toward Alexander Blackwood, whose presence seemed to lower the room's temperature by several degrees.

Olivia positioned herself as a human shield between Evelyn and the approaching threat. "You monster!" she spat, trembling with rage. "How much more will you torture her?"

Alexander's icy demeanor never faltered as he closed the distance. His stormy eyes locked onto Nathaniel before effortlessly prying Evelyn from his grasp.

"Alexander." Nathaniel's voice vibrated with barely contained fury. "What have you done to her?"

"You vile creature!" Olivia's voice cracked. "You've brainwashed her completely! She doesn't even recognize us anymore!"

Alexander's lips curled into a humorless smile. "Evelyn Sinclair died three years ago," he reminded coolly. "Or have you forgotten? You watched her body turn to ash. Do ghosts typically walk among the living?"
###Chapter 262

Olivia Bennett wasn't convinced. She opened her mouth to argue, but Alexander Blackwood's words extinguished the flicker of hope in her heart instantly.

Her gaze fell upon Evelyn Sinclair's breathtaking face, and her shoulders slumped in defeat.

'This can't possibly be Evelyn.'

'No, it must be her.'

Olivia glared at Alexander, her teeth clenched. "Alexander, this is clearly a setup. She's definitely Evelyn! You're the one who—"

"Enough." Evelyn's icy voice cut through the air. "Whatever history you share with Evelyn Sinclair has nothing to do with me. Let me make this perfectly clear—I am not Evelyn Sinclair."

With deliberate grace, she lifted her mesmerizing eyes to meet Alexander's. "I'm taking the day off. Would you care to join me, Mr. Blackwood?"

Alexander studied her hypnotic gaze, a slow smile forming. "The pleasure would be mine."

His fingers intertwined with hers as they walked away.

The crowd parted like the Red Sea, all eyes following the striking couple's departure.

Olivia and Nathaniel Sterling rushed after them, only to witness Evelyn slipping into Alexander's luxury car with a triumphant smirk.

"How is this possible?" Olivia fumed, her hands shaking. "Nate, we need to follow them."

Nathaniel's gaze lingered on the disappearing car, a soft smile playing on his lips. "If Evelyn's alive, I'll accept her no matter what she's become—"

Alexander parked near Willowbrook's secluded nature reserve. Evelyn stepped out, exhaling dramatically.

"What a nuisance looking identical to Mr. Blackwood's ex-wife," she complained, tossing her hair. Then feigning confusion, she asked, "Who was that man earlier? You seemed acquainted."

Alexander's gaze darkened as he studied her. "Just some wealthy fool who can't move on from my ex-wife."

Evelyn's pulse stuttered at his words.

'Can't move on.'

What bittersweet poetry.

Someone in this cruel world still remembered her.

Yet for ten torturous years, her heart had belonged only to this ruthless man before her.

'Life's cruel irony.'

'The one I love doesn't love me, while the one who loves me—'

This endless cycle of unrequited love only destroyed those foolish enough to give their hearts unwisely.

'Nathaniel, you still remember Evelyn.'

'She doesn't deserve your devotion.'

Alexander observed her pensive expression. "You seem moved, Miss Prescott."

Evelyn blinked, her mask slipping back into place. "Merely surprised that someone would cherish the woman you so clearly despised."

"Cherish?" Alexander's expression darkened, a storm brewing in his piercing gaze. He closed the distance between them, caging her against the car with his muscular frame.

His intense stare searched her face as he murmured, "There's a question I wanted to ask you last night." His breath warmed her skin. "Vivian Prescott, are you falling for me?"
###Chapter 263

His voice, deep and intoxicating, whispered against her ear before settling heavily in her chest.

Evelyn hadn't anticipated Alexander asking such a question.

Shock flickered across her face, but she remained composed. "Alexander, do you even realize what you're saying?"

"Of course I do." His tone dropped lower, wrapping around her like silk.

"I'm marrying Sebastian soon. Why would I have feelings for you?" Her voice was ice as she pushed him away.

But Alexander caught her wrist before she could retreat.

"Then why were you searching for me in the hospital last night? Why tell me you were worried?" His dark eyes burned into hers, his pulse betraying him. "You don’t love my uncle. I can see it."

Even knowing she wasn’t her, he couldn’t ignore the face identical to the one he’d lost. The face of the woman who still haunted him.

Evelyn was Evelyn. No one could replace her. And yet, here she stood—alive, breathing, and hating him.

After a weighted silence, Evelyn inhaled sharply. She lifted her gaze, meeting his head-on.

"Mr. Blackwood, you’re an extraordinary man. But I could never love someone who treated his wife the way you did."

The fire in her eyes wasn’t just anger—it was vengeance.

"I may look like her, but I won’t make her mistakes."

She wouldn’t.

She wouldn’t let herself fall for his lies again.

She had clawed her way back from death for one purpose: to ruin him. Not to ruin herself a second time.

Alexander chuckled darkly. "Do you even know what choices she made?" He released her, turning away, his voice hollow. "No one else could endure what she did."

No one else could love me like she did. No one else could haunt me every night the way she does.

Evelyn didn’t understand. She didn’t ask. She only saw the devastation in his posture.

Her lips curled coldly.

Good.

Her act was working. He thought she cared.

Perfect.

Just as she parted her lips to speak—

"Eve!"

Olivia’s voice cut through the tension.

Evelyn turned to see Olivia and Nathaniel rushing toward her.

Why were they here?

"Unbelievable," Evelyn muttered under her breath, feigning irritation.

Olivia reached her, breathless. "Eve, I don’t know what’s wrong with you—if you’ve lost your memory or what—but you cannot stay with this monster!" She jabbed a finger at Alexander, her voice trembling with fury.

"If you’ve forgotten, let me remind you exactly what kind of man he is!"

Her words were daggers, each one carving deeper into Evelyn’s heart.

"He humiliated you, destroyed your reputation, all to please Victoria! He hurt you until you were broken! He denied his own child, called the baby a bastard, and killed it with his own hands!"

Olivia’s eyes glistened with tears.

"Eve, please. Don’t make the same mistake again. Come with me. Now."

The pain was unbearable.

But Evelyn didn’t flinch.

She wouldn’t.
###Chapter 264

"Olivia, I never forgot."

"That's why I've returned for vengeance. This is for myself, but mostly for my child."

When Olivia noticed Evelyn's prolonged silence, she rushed forward and seized her hand urgently. "Evelyn, please come with us. Nathaniel genuinely loves and cares for you. Stop letting that monster manipulate you!"

"Enough." Evelyn cut her off sharply. "How many times must I say this? I'm not Evelyn Sinclair. And why shouldn't I stay with Mr. Blackwood? His past has nothing to do with me. All I know is that I'm happy with him. I enjoy his company. So stop harassing me!"

Her words dripped with ice as she shoved Olivia's hand away.

Turning abruptly, she clutched Alexander's arm, feigning intimacy. "Alexander, let's go somewhere quieter. These people are insufferable."

"Fine." Alexander responded flatly, unfazed by her touch.

Before leaving, he cast one last solemn glance at Olivia, her accusations still echoing in his mind.

The pain struck like a thousand scorpion stings to his heart, stealing his breath away.

Olivia had recounted every cruel act he'd committed against Evelyn, exposing his merciless nature.

In the passenger seat, Evelyn watched Alexander's troubled expression from her periphery.

She knew Olivia's words had struck a nerve.

A secret smirk curled her lips. 'How does it feel, Alexander? Finally feeling remorse? Or did you suddenly grow a conscience?'

'But when did you ever show me any conscience?'

'If you'd shown me even a shred of mercy back then, I wouldn't have suffered such a horrific fate!'

Autumn dusk draped the cemetery in a thin veil of mist.

Evelyn stepped carefully over fallen leaves toward the weathered headstone.

White chrysanthemums trembled in her grasp as she laid them before the grave and bowed deeply.

"Grandfather," she whispered, tracing the engraved name with her fingertips.

"Evelyn has come to see you."

Her smile wavered as tears blurred her vision.

"I know you'd disapprove of my actions, but I can't forgive what he did to me... to our child."

"He's taking the bait now. I'll make him fall hopelessly in love, then let him experience the agony of betrayal by someone he loves."

"And those who hurt you will pay dearly too."

Her eyes narrowed into dangerous slits, glinting with cold determination.

Lighting memorial candles, she settled onto the damp earth beside the grave.

The autumn sky darkened around her, but she remained, seeking comfort from the grandfather who'd once cherished her.

Alexander hadn't planned to visit the cemetery today, but Olivia's words haunted him.

Knowing apologies were meaningless, he came seeking impossible absolution.

The bouquet of 88 roses felt heavy in his arms. After placing them reverently, his fingers automatically traced the engraved name, a futile attempt to bridge the chasm between life and death.

Only cold stone met his touch - no warmth, no forgiveness.

Turning away, he sought a place to keep vigil when a flash of white caught his eye - a slender figure moving between graves, her silhouette achingly familiar.

The evening mist obscured her face, but his pulse quickened violently.

"Evelyn—!"

Her name tore from his lips as he spun toward Henry Whitmore's grave, his polished shoes crushing fallen leaves in his desperate pursuit.
###Chapter 265

Alexander raced toward the cemetery plot where he'd glimpsed the fleeting white figure. His pulse hammered violently against his ribs.

'Evelyn!'

'Could that really be you, Evelyn?'

The name echoed through his mind like a desperate prayer. This wasn't some alcohol-induced hallucination - he was certain.

Yet when he reached the gravesite, only cold marble greeted him.

Perhaps his exhausted mind had conjured the vision.

Ice flooded his veins.

Was grief finally driving him mad?

Alexander's shoulders slumped. As he turned to leave, a wisp of smoke caught his attention from a neighboring plot.

His steps quickened.

Henry Whitmore's grave stood adorned with fresh white lilies, a single candle still flickering.

Proof. Someone had been here recently.

Who besides Evelyn would visit her grandfather's resting place?

Alexander's breath hitched. He spun toward the cemetery gates, heart pounding.

Through the golden haze of sunset, a sleek black sedan pulled onto the main road.

Tires screeched as Alexander gave chase, foot heavy on the accelerator.

Hope and dread warred in his chest. Each passing mile stretched his nerves tighter.

When he finally overtook the vehicle, his world shattered.

Only a middle-aged man sat behind the wheel.

The crushing disappointment left him hollow.

'She's gone.'

'Alexander Blackwood, you killed her with your own hands.'

'Stop this madness.'

Yet the question remained - who else would pay respects to Henry Whitmore?

And why had the witness described a woman?

Vivian Prescott stepped into her penthouse just as Sebastian returned with little Amelia.

"Daddy!" The toddler launched herself at Vivian, covering her face with sticky kisses.

For a moment, the pain in Vivian's chest eased as she breathed in her daughter's strawberry-scented hair.

Then Ethan's hollow eyes flashed through her mind. That poor, disturbed child. Would Victoria even bother getting him help? Would Alexander?

"You're miles away." Sebastian's voice broke her reverie.

Vivian met his obsidian gaze. "Alexander asked me today if I liked him."

Sebastian froze mid-motion, his coat half-off. Sunset painted his sharp features in molten gold.

"Sounds like he's developing feelings."

A bitter laugh escaped Vivian's lips. "Same face, same soul. When I loved him desperately, he treated me like garbage. Now..."

She trailed off, the irony too painful to voice.

Yet satisfaction curled in her stomach at Alexander's growing attachment.

The silence stretched until Sebastian murmured, "Human nature, I suppose. We only value what we can't have."

Perhaps.

Things gained too easily become worthless.

No one treasures what comes cheap.

'That's why you let me die, isn't it? Because I made myself worthless to you.'

"Vivian." Sebastian's voice was feather-soft.

He never used her old name. That name belonged to the broken woman in the grave. Vivian Prescott had risen from her ashes.
###Chapter 266

Evelyn raised her gaze, locking eyes with Sebastian's piercing stare. His expression radiated warmth, wrapping around her like a protective cocoon.

"I'll stand by every decision you make. But if I may be honest, I wish you'd choose another path for your vengeance."

His fingers brushed against her cheek, the unexpected chill making her shiver.

Dark secrets swirled in the depths of his unreadable eyes. One glance too long and she feared she might drown in their mystery.

As Evelyn instinctively stepped back, Sebastian closed the distance between them.

His striking features loomed closer, radiating an intensity that was both commanding and possessive. "He never deserved you - not then, not now."

Her pulse quickened at his words.

Caught off guard, she barely registered his lips nearing hers until he abruptly stopped.

Instead of kissing her, he smirked and pressed a tender kiss to her forehead instead.

Still dazed, Evelyn found herself pulled into his embrace. His fingers threaded through her hair gently.

Pressed against his chest, she missed the dangerous glint in his half-lidded eyes as he concealed his true thoughts.

Morning light streamed through the windows when Evelyn's phone jolted her awake.

The screen illuminated with countless notifications - all filled with venomous messages.

She scrolled calmly through the trending hashtags.

Among them was a damning video clip.

The footage showed Victoria pleading with Evelyn in a café, playing the fragile victim to perfection.

The edited clip cut off after Victoria's loaded question: "So Miss Prescott, you're admitting you'll continue pursuing my fiancé as the other woman?"

Evelyn's supposed reply? A single, damning "Yes."

But she distinctly remembered never saying those words. The trap had been carefully set.

Victoria had masterfully painted herself as the wronged party, throwing Evelyn to the wolves.

Strangers flooded her social media with vile insults - homewrecker, gold-digger, every ugly name imaginable.

Evelyn skimmed the hate with detached amusement before heading to her vanity.

Studying her reflection, she let out a bitter laugh.

'When I loved you, I thought I'd never be enough.'

'Now I see I can soar higher without you.'

'Alexander, the wife you discarded has returned - but her heart is no longer yours.'

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn glided toward Victoria's suite. Raucous laughter spilled from within - unmistakably Margaret's voice.

"Oh Vic, you're brilliant!" Margaret crowed. "That perfect little ambush! Serves that Prescott bitch right. First she steals Madeline's face, now she wants your man?"

"Hmph!" Victoria's voice dripped with arrogance. "Who does Vivian Prescott think she is? Some boutique owner challenging my status?"

"Please! You're a Lancaster heiress!" Margaret sneered. "The Montgomeries are still clueless their real daughter died years ago!"

Victoria's laugh turned vicious. "Peabrains, the lot of them. Now we'll watch Vivian's precious Lady Belle crumble under the scandal. I've hired trolls to keep the fire burning!"

Their gleeful cackles were cut short as Evelyn threw open the doors with perfect timing.

"You want to see my next move?" Her voice sliced through their mirth. "Perhaps you should worry about your own fate first."
###Chapter 267

They never anticipated the very person they were scheming against would appear before them so suddenly.

Victoria Lancaster and Margaret Dawson froze mid-conversation. Their equally ugly expressions twisted with shock as they stared at Evelyn Sinclair, who had just walked into the room.

"You!" Margaret shot up from her seat, finger jabbing accusingly at Evelyn. "Who let you in? How long were you standing there? What did you hear?"

Victoria remained silent, but her eyes widened as she scrutinized Evelyn with undisguised hostility.

Evelyn arched a brow, lips curling into a knowing smirk. "Why? Did you say something incriminating and now you're afraid I heard?"

Margaret's face paled. She glanced away briefly before snapping back. "You—"

"If I'm not mistaken, you must be Victoria's adoptive mother." Evelyn tilted her head, feigning contemplation. "Tsk tsk. Your adopted daughter has clearly inherited your worst traits. I was wondering how a refined woman like Mrs. Montgomery could raise someone as vile as Victoria."

"W-What did you just say?" Margaret's face contorted with rage. She lunged at Evelyn, teeth bared, ready to strike.

Evelyn caught her wrist effortlessly, her grip firm. Her gaze turned icy. "The resemblance is uncanny. If I didn’t know better, I’d swear you were her biological mother."

At those words, both women stiffened, their expressions shifting from anger to something far more uneasy.

"Vivian Prescott, shut your mouth!" Victoria shrieked, abandoning all pretense of composure.

With no witnesses around, she didn’t bother hiding her true nature.

She flung off her blanket and stood, eyes narrowed to slits. "Vivian, instead of wasting time here, shouldn’t you be dealing with the mess online?"

Victoria crossed her arms, a smug laugh escaping her. "I warned you. Cross me, and you’ll regret it. Since you’re so desperate to steal my man, I’ll make sure the whole world knows you as the homewrecker they all despise!"

Crack!

Before Victoria could finish, Evelyn’s palm connected sharply with her cheek.

"Ah!" Victoria stumbled back, clutching her stinging face in disbelief.

Margaret gasped, but before she could react, Evelyn spoke coolly.

"That slap is to wake you up from your delusions. Stop dreaming in broad daylight. Take a good look and tell me—who’s the one who should be cleaning up their mess?"

"You—!" Victoria’s eyes bulged. She raised her hand to retaliate, but froze when Evelyn lifted her phone, tapping the screen to play a video.

The footage showed the café encounter—but from Evelyn’s perspective.

She had recorded everything.

Every word. Every sneer. Every venomous threat Victoria had spat at her.

Victoria’s triumphant grin shattered instantly.

Her face drained of color. For a full ten seconds, she stood paralyzed before lunging for the phone.

Evelyn sidestepped easily, her smile cold and victorious.

"Too late. I already uploaded this before I walked in. By now, the entire internet knows the truth."

"What—?"

"Those people cursing me online? They’re probably redirecting their rage at you as we speak."

"..."

"Surprised, Victoria? Your little scheme just backfired spectacularly. How does it feel?"

Victoria’s face cycled through shades of red and green, humiliation burning through her.

Just then, her phone buzzed violently. Notification after notification flooded her screen—trending hashtags, viral tweets, all exposing her.

When she glanced down, her blood ran cold.
###Chapter 268

"Vivian Prescott, how dare you scheme against me, you vile creature?" Victoria Lancaster snapped. The fragile, pitiful facade she'd shown in her video confession had completely vanished.

Her eyes burned with fury as she snatched a fruit knife from the bedside table. The blade glinted dangerously as she lunged toward Evelyn's face. Margaret Dawson made no move to stop her daughter, secretly hoping Victoria would teach this troublesome woman a proper lesson.

The approaching knife triggered Evelyn's memories - the two vicious scars Victoria had carved into her face years ago. The horrifying scene flashed through her mind like a recurring nightmare.

Snapping back to reality, Evelyn barely dodged the deadly blade in time.

"Stop running, you wretch!" Victoria's chest heaved with rage as she raised the knife again. "Let me show you, Vivian Prescott. This is exactly how I ruined Evelyn Sinclair's face. Cross me again, and you'll experience that same agony!"

Evelyn scrambled backward, but Margaret suddenly blocked her escape.

Victoria's lips twisted into a predator's grin, her eyes bloodshot with madness. In that moment, she resembled nothing so much as a demon thirsting for blood as she brought the knife down—

"Look out!"

At the critical moment, Evelyn heard a familiar voice shout in alarm.

Alexander Blackwood materialized like a storm, sweeping Evelyn into his protective embrace. With one arm shielding her, his other hand caught Victoria's wrist in an iron grip.

His piercing gaze locked onto Victoria's monstrous expression. "Have you lost your mind?" His voice held a glacial edge she'd never heard before.

Both women froze in shock. Neither had expected Alexander's sudden appearance.

"A-Alexander?" Victoria stammered. As she tried to explain, he shoved her away violently.

She stumbled backward, crashing into a cabinet. Reaching blindly for support, she forgot about the knife still clutched in her hand. The sharp blade sliced across her own cheek, immediately drawing blood.

Yet she barely noticed the wound, too stunned by the sight of Evelyn safely cradled in Alexander's arms.

It couldn't be.

This had to be an illusion!

Alexander despised that face - the face identical to Evelyn Sinclair's!

No matter its beauty, to him it represented the ugliest betrayal imaginable.

Evelyn herself was equally shocked by Alexander's timely intervention. His strong embrace radiated the warmth she'd once craved so desperately, now enveloping her completely.

"It's alright now. You're safe," Alexander murmured against her ear, sensing her trembling.

Evelyn stiffened at his unexpected gentleness. His warm breath brushed her cheek, his comforting words carrying a tenderness she'd never known from him before.

He seemed genuinely... concerned.

"Alexander!" Victoria's pained shriek shattered the moment.

"Alexander, how can you hold that woman? You promised I'd be the only woman you'd ever protect!" Her shrill voice bordered on hysteria, all pretense of elegance gone.

Alexander lifted his head coldly. As he opened his mouth to respond, his expression changed when he saw Victoria's face.

Thinking he'd noticed her injury, Victoria prepared to play victim—until Margaret pointed and screamed, "Victoria! Your face!"

Victoria touched her cheek in confusion. "What about my—" Her fingers came away wet with blood.
###Chapter 269

Evelyn's fingers trembled as they brushed against her cheek. The warm, sticky liquid coating her fingertips made her breath hitch.

"Blood!" Her voice cracked. "There's so much blood! My face—!"

She stared at her crimson-stained palm, a scream tearing from her throat. The blood loss drained the color from her skin, leaving her ghostly pale.

Vivian Prescott tilted her head, taking in the jagged gash marring Victoria Lancaster's once-flawless cheek. A bitter laugh bubbled up inside her.

How ironic.

The woman who had orchestrated her downfall was now disfigured.

Was this divine retribution?

"Vic, darling, don't panic! Alexander is here—he won't let anything happen to you!" Margaret Dawson rushed forward, her voice dripping with false concern. She shot a pointed look at Alexander Blackwood.

"Alexander, take her to the emergency room now! If that wound scars, it'll ruin everything!" Margaret shoved Victoria toward him.

Tears streamed down Victoria's face as she gazed at Alexander, who still held Vivian in his arms. "Alexander… my face… Am I hideous now?"

"Alexander, for heaven's sake! She's bleeding out! She could die!" Margaret shrieked dramatically.

Victoria lifted her head, watching as Alexander's brow furrowed in contemplation.

Then, just as he seemed about to step toward her—

Vivian let out a soft whimper.

Alexander's attention snapped back to her.

"What's wrong?"

"Don't mind me, Mr. Blackwood." Vivian's lips curled into a mocking smile. "I just twisted my ankle. You should tend to your precious fiancée before she bleeds to death."

Her words dripped with venom. Margaret and Victoria glared but bit back their retorts.

"Alexander, Victoria is getting worse! Hurry—"

"You take her." Alexander cut Margaret off coldly. Then, without hesitation, he tightened his grip on Vivian's hand. "I'm taking you to orthopedics."

Victoria and Margaret gaped in disbelief.

Vivian arched a brow, amused by their stunned expressions. "Isn't this inappropriate?"

"Your injury takes priority," Alexander stated firmly, sliding an arm around her waist and pulling her flush against him.

"Alexander!" Victoria's voice cracked with desperation. "Are you seriously ignoring me?!"

Vivian smirked, relishing the frustration radiating off Victoria.

How many times had she begged for his attention, only to be cast aside?

Now, the roles were reversed.

Margaret stomped her foot, seething. "Victoria, come on! I'll take you myself. That scar will ruin everything if we don't act fast!"

Victoria's face twisted with fury, but she had no choice.

"Vivian Prescott," she hissed, venom lacing every syllable, "you'll pay for this."

With one last hateful glare, she turned away.

"Aren't you worried about your fiancée's face, Mr. Blackwood?" Vivian asked sweetly. "A scar might make her less appealing."

Alexander paused, his dark eyes glinting with something unreadable. "Her scars don't concern me half as much as your pain does."

The answer caught her off guard.

Her ankle wasn't even hurt—she'd only said it to keep him from leaving.

But now, she played along, wincing slightly. "It… stings a little."

Concern flickered in Alexander's gaze. Without warning, he swept her into his arms, cradling her against his chest.

Vivian gasped, unprepared for the sudden movement.

"You shouldn't be in pain anymore," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear.

She stared up at him, struck by the sharp lines of his jaw, the cold beauty of his profile. His body heat seeped through his shirt, scorching against her skin.

But she felt nothing.

No flutter in her chest. No warmth.

Only bitter amusement.

Alexander, do you have any idea how long I waited for this?

Her fingers curled into fists.

And yet, all she felt was emptiness.
###Chapter 270

"You've never shown me even a sliver of kindness before."

"Do you have any idea how much it hurt when you plunged that knife into my heart?"

"You couldn't possibly understand..."

Alexander escorted Evelyn to the doctor. Only after confirming she was unharmed did he finally exhale in relief.

Despite her protests, he stubbornly insisted on taking her back to the penthouse.

His shoulders visibly relaxed when he realized Sebastian wasn't there.

Evelyn needed to get rid of him before he noticed anything suspicious. "Mr. Blackwood," she said coolly, "shouldn't you be at the hospital with your wife?"

"I told you—she's no longer my fiancée," he replied icily. His gaze locked onto hers, something unreadable flickering in his eyes. "And next time, don't call me Mr. Blackwood. Use my name."

Evelyn blinked in surprise, but before she could respond, his phone buzzed.

His expression darkened the moment he saw the caller ID.

He rejected the call, but within seconds, it rang again.

This time, he answered. The room was so quiet Evelyn could hear the frantic female voice on the other end.

She guessed it was probably Victoria.

"I'll be there. Stop calling," Alexander snapped before hanging up without hesitation.

His eyes returned to Evelyn, who leaned against the bedframe. "Rest. I'll be in touch soon."

A knowing smile curved her lips. "Oh, I have a feeling we'll see each other much sooner than that."

The golden light of dusk illuminated her striking features, and for two heartbeats, he simply stared—before turning sharply on his heel.

As he left the bedroom, his gaze drifted toward the guest room.

He hesitated, then tested the doorknob. Unlocked. He didn't enter, merely peered inside from the threshold.

A slow smirk tugged at his lips. Something glinted in his eyes before he shut the door behind him.

The moment Evelyn heard the front door close, she grabbed her phone.

She scrolled through Twitter's trending topics before clicking on Victoria's profile.

The comments were exactly what she'd hoped for—a flood of outrage.

"Two-faced snake."

"Fake victim."

"Who posts staged videos for sympathy?"

Evelyn smirked, scrolling through the vitriol with satisfaction.

Did you really think I'd still be the same Evelyn you could manipulate so easily? How naïve.

Alexander strode into the hospital room to find Victoria slumped on the bed, her right cheek heavily bandaged. Her face was ghostly pale, lips bloodless. The moment she saw him, she burst into theatrical sobs and threw herself against his chest. "Alexander!"

Margaret stood nearby, dabbing at nonexistent tears. "Thank God you're here! Victoria's been hysterical. The doctor said the cut might scar! What are we supposed to do? She can't possibly—"

"Get out," Alexander cut in, voice dripping with irritation.

Margaret froze. "But Alexander, Victoria is the heiress of Willowbrook's most powerful family! If her face is ruined—"

"Leave. Now. Or I will."

Margaret trembled, shooting Victoria a panicked look before scurrying out.

The moment the door clicked shut, Victoria clutched him tighter—only for Alexander to shove her away.

Her cries turned frantic. "Alexander, please! I know I lost control earlier, but Vivian provoked me! She came here just to taunt me, saying she'd steal you away! I never meant to actually hurt her—I was just trying to scare her! You have to believe me!"

Alexander stared down at her, his gaze colder than she'd ever seen. Disappointment. Suspicion.

Victoria's pulse skyrocketed. She grabbed his sleeve. "You believe me, right?"

"I heard everything," he said quietly.

Her breath hitched. "H-Heard what?"

"Before I walked in. Every word you said to Vivian."

Silence.

His next words were lethal.

"You're the one who disfigured Evelyn's face."
###Chapter 271

What?

Alexander's words hit Victoria like a physical blow. Her knees buckled as if the air had been punched from her lungs.

She stumbled backward, grasping at the hospital bed for support.

Every vicious threat she'd hurled at Vivian Prescott moments earlier came rushing back with terrifying clarity. 'Let me tell you something, Vivian Prescott. This is exactly how I ruined Evelyn Sinclair's face all those years ago. Cross me again, and I'll make sure you experience that same agony!'

Victoria's already pale complexion turned ghostly white. Her pulse hammered violently in her throat.

She had indeed said those exact words.

Blinded by rage toward Vivian, she'd let her true nature slip - revealing her darkest secret.

Alexander studied the shifting emotions in Victoria's eyes. His voice dripped with bitter disappointment. "You told me it was your father William who arranged Evelyn's disfigurement. That was a lie. It was you all along."

"N-No! That's not—" Victoria clutched at Alexander's sleeve desperately. Tears welled in her eyes as she shook her head. "I would never hurt Evie! Never!"

"I can't stand the sight of blood! Why would I ever use a knife? It was Evie who harmed Ethan first! My father only hired someone to teach her a lesson in anger! I had nothing to do with it!"

"Alexander, please believe me. Please believe your Lillian..."

The mention of Lillian momentarily stayed Alexander's fury. Memories of their shared past surfaced.

Seeing his anger ebb, Victoria pressed closer, leaning against him with calculated vulnerability. "Alexander, you must believe me. I was provoked! I have no reason to do such horrible things. I only lost control because of Vivian! I was just trying to scare her—I'd never actually hurt her!"

She poured every ounce of false sincerity into her plea, but Alexander coldly pushed her away. His striking eyes had turned glacial.

"You're not the girl I once knew. I don't even recognize you anymore."

His deep voice vibrated with suppressed rage. Without another word, he turned to leave.

A bone-deep chill spread through Victoria. She lunged after him, grabbing his arm. "Alexander! Don't go! You can't leave me like this! Why are you doing this? What have I done wrong? I only act this way because I love you too much! And now you won't even look at me because of that Vivian Prescott!"

"My face is ruined because of you! I'll be scarred forever! Are you going to abandon me now? Don't you understand how important a woman's face is?"

A dark chuckle escaped Alexander at her hysterical words. "So you do understand how important a woman's face is?"

"..."

"Did you ever consider Evelyn's pain? Her terror when you destroyed her face?"

"..."

Victoria froze, gaping at the man interrogating her.

Evie.

He kept calling her Evie, yet hadn't used his pet name "Lillian" for her in years.

That bitch Evelyn still haunted his heart like some unshakable ghost.

That wretched bitch!

As Victoria stood paralyzed, she suddenly realized her hands were empty.

Alexander had pulled away without hesitation. He wouldn't even grant her a backward glance.

Margaret Dawson had been eavesdropping outside. When the door swung open to reveal Alexander's thunderous expression, she immediately lowered her gaze, not daring to speak. She could only watch helplessly as he stormed away before rushing back into the room.

"Lillian," she called anxiously to her daughter.

With a guttural scream, Victoria swept everything off the bedside table in a violent crash.

"Evelyn Sinclair! You're dead but still tormenting me from the grave!"

"First Evelyn, now Vivian Prescott! Bitches! They're all scheming bitches!"

Her eyes burned crimson as she shrieked at the empty air.

Margaret hurriedly closed the door, terrified someone might witness Victoria's unraveling.
###Chapter 272

Victoria had overheard Alexander and Vivian's conversation earlier, but she never expected it to come to light so quickly.

Margaret tightened her grip on Victoria's arm, her voice laced with urgency. "Victoria, you can't back down now. The title of Mrs. Blackwood isn't just about status—it's power, wealth, everything!"

Her eyes gleamed with greed, a feral edge creeping into her expression. "Leave Vivian Prescott to me. I'll make sure she regrets ever crossing you."

After her outburst, Victoria gingerly touched the bandages on her face, her jaw clenched in fury.

"Of course I won't give up," she hissed. "No one takes what's mine. I'll destroy anyone who tries."

Venom dripped from her words, her mind already spinning dark schemes.

"Vivian Prescott thinks she's untouchable? Let's see how she handles Eleanor Kingsley."

Alexander drove away from the hospital in a daze, his mind numb.

The road blurred before him, his thoughts consumed by Victoria's confession.

She was the one who ruined Evelyn's face.

A bitter laugh escaped him.

How ironic.

His luxury car eventually rolled to a stop outside an aging apartment complex.

He climbed the stairs mechanically, stepping into a unit frozen in time.

This had been Evelyn's home before her death. He'd purchased it at an exorbitant price, clinging to the remnants of her existence.

Three years had passed, yet he couldn't bring himself to let go.

The space remained untouched, a shrine to his guilt.

When the weight of regret became unbearable, he came here—or to her grave, whispering apologies to cold stone.

Futile.

Pointless.

His gaze swept over the empty living room, memories flooding back.

This was where he'd first seen Evelyn's scars.

Where she'd collapsed at his feet, begging for mercy while he mocked her.

Where he'd flushed her painkillers down the toilet and ripped the bandages from her wounds.

Evelyn, did it hurt?

Was I always this cruel to you?

A hollow chuckle escaped him as he picked up her diary, fingers tracing the familiar handwriting.

Between these pages, he found proof of her love—his only solace, however fleeting.

He stayed there for hours, ignoring every call.

Night fell before he finally stirred, his phone buzzing again.

Blackwood Estate.

Assuming it was his grandfather, he answered—only to be met with his mother's shrill voice.

"Alexander! Where have you been? Victoria is in crisis, and you're ignoring her?"

His grip tightened on the phone. "Crisis?"

"Her face is ruined! Do you understand how devastating that is for a woman?"

He nearly laughed.

Before he could hang up, her tone shifted.

"Come home. Now. We have a... special guest waiting."

The sarcasm in her voice was unmistakable.

When she revealed the visitor's identity, his brows lifted.

Within minutes, he was speeding back to the estate.
###Chapter 273

The drive back to Blackwood Estate felt endless. Alexander couldn't shake his mother's words from the phone call earlier. They echoed relentlessly in his mind.

Without realizing, his foot pressed harder on the accelerator. The sleek black car roared through the gates in record time.

He stepped out of the vehicle with purposeful strides, heading straight for the grand foyer. Then he saw her.

Evelyn.

That breathtaking face he'd been dreaming about for months stood mere feet away, illuminated by the afternoon light streaming through the windows.

Alexander froze mid-step. His pulse quickened unexpectedly.

Evelyn looked up at his sudden entrance. A shy smile played on her lips, her expressive eyes dancing with unspoken emotions. "I was expecting Sebastian, but it's just you, Mr. Blackwood," she murmured softly.

The rapid beating of Alexander's heart stuttered to a halt. His lips curved into a practiced smile even as his eyes narrowed. "Were you waiting for my uncle?"

"Sebastian and I were supposed to arrive together," Evelyn explained calmly, "but he got called away unexpectedly. Since we need to speak with you anyway, this saves us another trip."

Alexander moved closer, his intense gaze locking onto hers. "What exactly do you need to discuss?"

Her eyes met his without flinching. "Our marriage."

Those two simple words struck Alexander like physical blows. The air seemed to leave his lungs as an inexplicable weight settled over him.

"You'll give us your blessing, won't you, Mr. Blackwood? After all, he is your uncle." Evelyn's smile widened as she watched his expression turn icy.

"Do you truly believe you'll find happiness marrying a man you don't love?"

Evelyn's eyes widened momentarily before her composed mask slipped back into place. "Do you think I'd find happiness marrying someone I love deeply, Mr. Blackwood?" she countered.

Noticing the shadow crossing his features, she continued, "From what I understand, your late wife Evelyn loved you desperately. What did that earn her? She loved the wrong man. Not only did she never receive your affection, she lost her life because of it."

Evelyn enunciated each word with precision, watching the subtle shifts in Alexander's expression. "The cruelest part? Everyone celebrated when she died. They thought the world was better off without her."

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. "So tell me, Mr. Blackwood, does loving someone guarantee happiness?"

Alexander stared at her, momentarily speechless. The question that had seemed so reasonable moments ago now tasted like ash in his mouth.

He remembered Evelyn's final moments - the desperate gasps for air, the way her fragile body had convulsed. The realization hit him like a physical blow.

No.

She hadn't been happy.

Meeting him had been the greatest tragedy of her life.

"If love brings nothing but pain," Evelyn's voice pulled him from his thoughts, "then I'd rather be the one who's loved than the one doing the loving."

The words settled between them like a death sentence. Alexander felt an invisible blade twist in his chest, the pain radiating outward despite the absence of blood.

"Sebastian."

Evelyn's sudden greeting made Alexander turn sharply. His uncle stood in the doorway, watching them with an unreadable expression.
###Chapter 274

Alexander snapped back to reality as Sebastian approached him.

Evelyn walked past, leaving behind a delicate floral fragrance that lingered in the air. Her scent was intoxicating, uniquely hers.

"Alexander." Sebastian greeted him with effortless grace, every movement exuding aristocratic refinement.

Alexander's icy gaze flickered between their intertwined hands before looking away.

Evelyn met Alexander's stare briefly before turning to Sebastian with a radiant smile. "Shall we go inside, Sebastian?"

"Of course." Sebastian's gentle smile never wavered as he led Evelyn into the grand parlor.

Margaret Blackwood was finishing a call when she spotted them. Her lips curled in disdain as she hung up abruptly.

"Well, if it isn't Sebastian," she drawled, her eyes darting to Evelyn. "Tell me you're not seriously considering marrying this... woman."

Sebastian's polite smile tightened. "As my elder, I expect basic courtesy. The lady you're referring to happens to be my fiancée."

Margaret scoffed loudly, turning toward Alexander. "Do you hear this? Your uncle wants to marry your ex-wife's doppelgänger! How pathetic!"

She deliberately raised her voice as Henry Blackwood descended the staircase.

"Sebastian, now I understand why you were always so concerned about Evelyn during your visits. You had feelings for her back then, didn't you? The moment she died, you went searching for a replacement. How desperate."

Alexander's jaw clenched as memories surfaced—Evelyn and Sebastian's closeness that had once made his blood boil with jealousy.

"Grandfather, look at this farce!" Margaret continued. "He wants to marry this Evelyn lookalike in seven days! The resemblance is sickening—"

"Enough!" Henry's voice thundered through the hall.

Margaret pursed her lips, rolling her eyes dramatically.

"I will never approve this marriage!"

"I'm not here for permission," Sebastian countered coolly, his usually composed features darkening. "Merely to inform my family."

Evelyn squeezed his hand gently. "Don't upset yourself, darling. Their opinions mean nothing. Marrying you is the greatest joy of my life."

Sebastian turned, his gaze softening. "No, I'm the fortunate one." His fingers intertwined with hers as he gazed at her with such devotion it made her breath catch.

Henry studied them intently. "Are you both certain about this? No regrets?"

Evelyn turned confidently. "Absolutely."

Henry's brow furrowed as he examined Evelyn's face, concern flickering in his aged eyes. "Very well. You have my blessing."

"I object." Alexander's voice cut through the room like ice.
###Chapter 275

All eyes snapped to Alexander as his commanding voice cut through the tension.

His chiseled features were set in glacial severity, those piercing sapphire eyes like shards of ice.

"Sebastian, I'm marrying Vivian regardless of objections," the older man stated calmly, his resolve unshaken.

"That marriage won't happen." Alexander's measured response carried more steel than his uncle's declaration.

Evelyn arched an eyebrow. "What gives you the right to interfere, Mr. Blackwood? Who are you to oppose our union?"

His lips compressed into a thin line as that arctic gaze pinned her. The intensity in his stare bordered on predatory.

"I refuse to let someone with your face become my aunt."

His tone brooked no argument, his expression carved from marble.

Evelyn let out a derisive laugh. "So I can't marry your uncle because I resemble your late wife? By that logic, should I only consider men who look like you, Mr. Blackwood?"

Alexander's jaw tightened. Their gazes locked, electricity crackling between them.

"Don't flatter yourself thinking you could ever marry our Alexander!" Margaret Blackwood sneered suddenly, her voice dripping with condescension. "In all of Willowbrook, only Miss Sophia Montgomery is worthy of being Mrs. Blackwood! Their wedding is imminent. You? Hah! Any woman bearing resemblance to that wretched Evelyn Sinclair brings nothing but misfortune."

Alexander's expression darkened at his mother's venomous words. "How many times must I repeat myself? The engagement with the Montgomerys is terminated. I won't marry her."

Margaret's triumphant smirk faltered, replaced by shocked indignation. Flushing crimson, she wheedled, "Alexander, I know there were misunderstandings between you and Victoria, but stop being unreasonable. She bore your son Ethan! How can you abandon her now? She adores you completely—where will you find another woman so devoted?"

"Do you imagine she's the only woman capable of loving me?" The question came out glacial. Only one face flashed in Alexander's mind.

No one could ever love him as fiercely, as completely as Evelyn had.

She was irreplaceable.

Margaret gaped, momentarily speechless.

A shrill ringtone shattered the silence.

The moment Margaret answered, frantic screams erupted from the speaker. Evelyn recognized Eleanor Kingsley's hysterical voice shrieking about Victoria.

"Oh god!" Margaret's face drained of color. "Alexander, hurry to the hospital! Victoria's threatening to jump!"

Victoria Lancaster—attempting suicide?

Evelyn's lips curled sardonically. This was clearly another performance. Victoria always had an agenda, and securing the Blackwood name remained her ultimate prize.

"Alexander, Victoria has stood by you for years and given you Ethan! Her face was disfigured because of you! You can't turn your back on her now! If she actually jumps, you'll carry that regret forever!"

Regret.

The word struck Alexander like a dagger.

Evelyn's dying words echoed in his memory.

'Alexander, you'll regret this.'

He couldn't bear that weight again.

Not even a fraction of it.

Evelyn.

Her name was a wound in his chest. Abruptly, he turned on his heel and strode away.

Evelyn tracked the minute shifts in Alexander's expression—the barely concealed panic, the fear of loss.

Her heart plummeted as she watched him rush off.

'Alexander, you still care so deeply for her.'

'Is that terror I saw in your eyes? Fear of losing her?'

'Hmph!'

Her rosebud lips pressed together, storm clouds gathering in her gaze.

From the sidelines, Henry Blackwood observed Evelyn thoughtfully before sighing and shaking his head.

Sebastian would have stayed, but urgent matters demanded his immediate departure.
###Chapter 276

Evelyn arrived alone at the hospital where Victoria was staying. A massive crowd had gathered outside the building, all staring upward with horrified expressions.

Following their gaze, Evelyn looked up. There, perched precariously on the rooftop railing, sat a pale figure in a hospital gown. Even from this distance, the delicate features were unmistakably Victoria's.

The elevator ride to the roof felt endless. Evelyn had expected Alexander to be there already, but the rooftop was empty except for the drama unfolding before her. Where was he? He'd seemed so concerned earlier. Had it all been an act?

The sound of hysterical sobbing snapped her attention forward. "Victoria, please! I'm begging you!" Eleanor Kingsley screamed, her voice raw with desperation. "Come down from there!"

Eleanor's anguish was palpable, her face streaked with tears. Beside her, William Montgomery held his weeping wife back while speaking gently to the woman on the ledge. "Sweetheart, please listen to me," he pleaded, every word dripping with paternal concern.

Their distress would have been touching if it weren't so tragically misplaced.

"Where's Alexander?" Victoria's fragile voice carried across the rooftop. "Isn't he coming?"

"He'll be here soon!" Eleanor cried. "Just wait a little longer, darling!"

Evelyn rolled her eyes. The performance was almost impressive in its melodrama.

Margaret Dawson chose that moment to escalate the theatrics. "Oh Victoria! How could you do this to yourself? First Evelyn ruined your happiness, now this Vivian Prescott is tearing you and Alexander apart! Why must you suffer so?"

The older woman's crocodile tears flowed freely as she seized the opportunity to vilify Evelyn. "Even though you're not my biological daughter, think of your real mother! The Montgomerys' only child!"

Eleanor wailed at these words, while William's face twisted in anguish. The scene would have been comical if it weren't so pathetic.

Evelyn couldn't contain her derisive laugh any longer. "Only child?" she called out, stepping forward. "Are you certain about that?"

The entire group froze at her interruption. Margaret whirled around, recognition flashing across her face followed by panic. That day in the hospital room - this woman had heard everything.

Victoria recoiled dramatically. "Go away! Get out of here!" she shrieked, withdrawing from Eleanor's outstretched hand.

Eleanor rounded on Evelyn with venom in her eyes. "You! What are you doing here? Haven't you done enough damage? Get out!"

Evelyn advanced despite their protests, her lips curling in amusement. "Why so eager to chase me away, Margaret? Afraid I'll reveal your little secret?"

Eleanor didn't wait for an explanation. With a cry of rage, she lunged at Evelyn, hand raised to strike. "You vile creature! Just like Evelyn, you take pleasure in tormenting my daughter! Well she has parents who love her now!"

Evelyn caught Eleanor's wrist effortlessly. "Are you absolutely sure you want to hit me?" she asked softly, locking eyes with the older woman. Something in her gaze made Eleanor hesitate.

Seizing the moment, Evelyn released Eleanor's wrist and addressed the group. "Let me share what I overheard recently. According to Margaret here, the Montgomerys' real daughter died three years ago."

The silence that followed was deafening.
###Chapter 277

The moment Evelyn spoke those words, the atmosphere turned glacial. Only the mournful wail of the autumn wind sweeping across the rooftop broke the silence.

Eleanor's face paled as she stared at Evelyn in shock. "W-What did you just say? Repeat that!"

William Montgomery strode forward, his piercing gaze locking onto Evelyn. "What kind of ridiculous lie is this? My daughter is standing right here, alive and well! How dare you claim she's been dead for three years!"

Evelyn's lips curled into a bitter smile as she released Eleanor's hand. "I'm not cursing your precious daughter," she stated calmly, pointing at Margaret. "I'm merely repeating what I heard her say - that your real daughter died three years ago."

"What?" The Montgomerys turned to Margaret in unison.

"Absolute nonsense!" Margaret denied vehemently, though panic flickered behind her composed facade. "Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery, don't listen to this woman's lies! I would never say such things!"

"Vivian Prescott," Victoria interjected dramatically, her voice trembling. "Why are you poisoning my adoptive parents' minds? What's your game? Are you trying to convince them I'm not their real daughter? Is this your twisted way of destroying me?"

Seeing Victoria's performance, Margaret played along urgently. "Victoria, darling, don't get upset! Come down from there! If anything happens to you, your parents will be devastated!"

Eleanor and William exchanged worried glances as Victoria shook her head despairingly. "Mother, Father...do you believe her over me? Do you think I'm not your real child? Is that why you've stopped caring about me? Fine then..."

She let out a hollow laugh. "Alexander ignores me, and now you doubt me too. What's left to live for?"

Victoria turned toward the rooftop's edge, taking a deliberate step closer.

"Victoria! No! Of course we believe you!" Eleanor screamed, her face ghostly pale.

"Don't be foolish!" William bellowed, his voice thick with paternal fear. "We would never stop caring about you!"

Evelyn's heart turned to ice witnessing their reactions. Even with the truth laid bare, they still chose to believe Victoria.

Her pink lips curved into a self-deprecating smile. 'Perhaps it's my face,' she thought bitterly. 'Untrustworthy then, untrustworthy now.'

"Vivian Prescott, stop this poisonous nonsense!" Eleanor rounded on Evelyn, eyes blazing. "Get out! If anything happens to my daughter because of you, I'll never forgive you! Leave now!"

Evelyn met Eleanor's furious gaze, her smile never wavering. Instead of retreating, she advanced toward Victoria.

"Don't you dare!" William roared. "Take one more step and you'll regret it for the rest of your life!"

Evelyn paused, her striking eyes fixed on Victoria's theatrical performance. "Your acting skills are remarkable, Victoria. Such a waste you never pursued theater."

Victoria widened her tear-filled eyes. "V-Vivian, how could you say such things?"

"Don't play dumb," Evelyn scoffed. "If you're going to jump, do it already. We're all waiting."

"You vile creature!" Margaret lunged forward. "Look at her, Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery! She's practically pushing Victoria to jump!"

"Vivian Prescott!" Eleanor grabbed Evelyn's arm violently. "You wicked witch! You're just as cruel as Evelyn Sinclair ever was!"
###Chapter 278

"If Evelyn is a witch, then what does that make your precious daughter?" Evelyn scoffed, her voice dripping with sarcasm.

"She conspired with an outsider to kidnap her own son and framed me for it. Have you forgotten?" She crossed her arms, her gaze sharp. "Or how about when she stole someone’s bracelet just to paint me as a thief? Tell me, Eleanor, who’s the real monster here?"

"You—!" Eleanor was left speechless, her face flushing with anger.

"I didn’t! I never did those things!" Victoria protested, tears streaming down her cheeks. She bit her trembling lip, looking every bit the victim. "Vivian Prescott, why are you doing this? You’ve already turned Alexander against me. You ruined my face. What more do you want? Do I have to die for you to be satisfied? Fine! I’ll jump!"

"No, Victoria!"

"Victoria, don’t!"

Eleanor and William lunged forward in panic, but Evelyn merely rolled her eyes.

"Go ahead. Stop wasting time." She smirked, watching the flicker of hesitation in Victoria’s expression. "What’s the hold-up? Jump already."

"You—!"

"Did you really think I’d fall for this act? You’d never risk your own life. You’re just waiting for Alexander so you can play the victim again."

"..."

Victoria’s face paled, then twisted in fury. She hadn’t expected Evelyn to see right through her.

Eleanor and William turned on Evelyn, shoving her violently. "Vivian Prescott, how dare you push her like this? You’re heartless!"

William raised his hand to strike her.

But just then, Evelyn caught Victoria glancing at Margaret. Then, with a dramatic sob, Victoria wailed, "Mom, Dad, forgive me! I’ll see you in the next life!"

"Victoria!" Margaret’s scream shattered the air.

William’s hand froze mid-swing. He and Eleanor spun around—just in time to see a flutter of white fabric vanish over the edge.

Victoria had jumped.

"Victoria!" Eleanor and William howled in horror, rushing toward the railing.

Evelyn barely spared them a glance, more concerned they might topple over in their panic.

She had seen Victoria eyeing Margaret earlier. This was all a performance. That woman would never throw her life away.

She was certain.

But before she could confirm, footsteps echoed behind her.

She turned—and met Alexander’s stormy gaze.

Margaret lunged at him, sobbing hysterically. "Alexander, you’re too late! Victoria jumped! It’s all her fault—Vivian Prescott pushed her to do it! My Victoria! My baby!"

Evelyn watched as Alexander’s expression darkened. "What did you say? Victoria jumped?"

"It’s all because of her!" Margaret pointed a shaking finger at Evelyn.

Alexander’s piercing stare locked onto Evelyn, who remained unfazed. Then, without a word, he strode past her toward the railing where Eleanor and William stood.
###Chapter 279

"Victoria! My darling girl!" Eleanor Kingsley's anguished scream pierced the air. Her knees buckled as she collapsed into William Montgomery's waiting arms, unconscious from the shock.

Evelyn Sinclair's chest tightened at the sight.

Despite Eleanor's coldness toward her, the woman was still her birth mother. Evelyn still wished for Eleanor and William's wellbeing, even as they remained blind to Victoria's manipulations.

The entire situation felt like a grotesque performance.

Evelyn's gaze shifted to Alexander Blackwood standing motionless at the balcony's edge where Victoria had jumped moments earlier. His expression remained unreadable as he peered down at the lower terrace.

After several tense seconds, he turned with measured steps. "She landed on the balcony below. The fall wasn't fatal." His voice held steady, but Evelyn didn't miss the subtle exhale of relief.

Of course he still cared. That lingering concern for Victoria's life remained, despite everything.

Evelyn had anticipated this outcome. Victoria wouldn't have jumped without ensuring her survival first. The scheming woman had clearly scouted the building's architecture beforehand.

Still, Victoria was rushed to the emergency room.

When Eleanor regained consciousness and learned her daughter hadn't plummeted twenty stories to her death, she wept with hysterical relief.

Spotting Alexander, Eleanor launched herself at him. "How much longer will you torture my child? She gave you her youth, and you repay her by destroying her life for that wretched Vivian Prescott! Was Evelyn not enough? Must you find her doppelgänger to torment us further? If Victoria dies because of this, will you ever sleep again?"

Alexander absorbed the tirade impassively.

Sleep? When had he known peaceful rest since Evelyn's supposed death?

After a weighted pause, he responded coolly, "To end this 'torment,' I've terminated our engagement."

"You're abandoning her now? This is how you push her toward death?" Eleanor shrieked.

The ER doors swung open, cutting off her outburst. Both parents rushed to the doctor.

"Multiple fractures," the physician reported gravely. "The leg injuries are particularly severe. There's risk of permanent disability."

"Disability?" Eleanor's face drained of color. "You mean she might never walk properly again?"

"With proper care and therapy, full recovery remains possible," the doctor offered. "Avoid emotional triggers during her convalescence."

Eleanor's hands clenched into fists. "That Vivian Prescott! I'll make her pay!"

"Mrs. Montgomery, please," Margaret Dawson interjected, steering the distraught mother away. Then she turned pleading eyes to Alexander. "You're Victoria's only hope for recovery. Your presence could make all the difference. Don't you remember your childhood promise? You swore to always protect her."

Alexander's expression darkened at the reminder of that youthful vow.

Once, he'd longed to fulfill that promise. But after losing Evelyn—after realizing he'd loved her—that innocent pledge had become an inescapable chain, dragging him deeper into obligation.

The next morning, Evelyn found herself confronted by police officers accusing her of attempted murder. They demanded she accompany them for questioning, their tone leaving no room for refusal.

Memories of that nightmarish cell flooded back—the relentless interrogations, the humiliations, the brutal loss of her child. She would never voluntarily return to that hell.

Never again.

As officers moved to seize her, a sleek sports car screeched to a halt, blocking the police vehicle's path.
###Chapter 280

The car door swung open with a sharp click.

Alexander emerged, his presence radiating an arctic chill that made the officers instinctively step back.

His glacial gaze locked onto their hands restraining Evelyn. A muscle twitched in his jaw as he swiftly pulled her free, tucking her protectively against his side.

"Victoria's fall was clearly staged. Evelyn had nothing to do with it." His voice was steel wrapped in velvet. "Do your jobs properly before making arrests."

Without waiting for a response, he guided Evelyn to the passenger seat. "Get in."

Given the choice between a police cruiser and Alexander's sleek black car, Evelyn didn't hesitate.

Within minutes, they'd left the city behind, the car purring along deserted country roads until Alexander pulled over beneath a canopy of ancient oaks.

Evelyn studied his profile as she stepped out. "Why help me?" Her breath fogged in the crisp air. "I just pushed the woman you love off a building."

Alexander's lips curved without humor. "The woman I love?" His fingers brushed a stray lock of hair from her cheek. "Tell me, who exactly do you think that is?"

"Please." Evelyn laughed sharply. "All of Willowbrook knows you're obsessed with Victoria Lancaster. Just like everyone knows how much you despised your ex-wife."

For a long moment, Alexander said nothing. The wind carried the scent of pine between them.

Evelyn turned to leave. "Thanks for the rescue, but shouldn't you be holding Victoria's hand right now? I hear she—"

His grip on her wrist stopped her mid-step. The contact sent electric currents up her arm.

"That day you asked if you should marry a man who resembles me..." Alexander's breath warmed her neck as he stepped closer. "My answer is yes."

Evelyn spun to face him. His eyes held a heat she hadn't seen in years.

"But there is no other man like me." His thumb traced her pulse point. "Which means you'll have to settle for the original."

"Alexander Blackwood, have you lost your mind?"

"Completely." His smile was predatory. "Marry me, Vivian. I'll treat Amelia as my own. Sebastian's situation will be handled. All you need to do is say yes."

This was exactly what Evelyn had wanted—to make him fall into her carefully laid trap.

Just not this fast.

Not before he'd suffered enough.

She forced a laugh. "I'm marrying Sebastian in five days. He adores me. Why would I choose a man who could never love me?"

"Because I already do."

The raw confession stunned her. His fingers tightened around her wrist as if anchoring them both against the tide of emotions.

Alexander closed the distance between them, his scent—bergamot and winter—enveloping her. "A woman once warned me I'd regret losing her. She was right. I've spent every night since drowning in that regret." His lips brushed her temple. "I won't make the same mistake twice."

Evelyn's heart hammered. Who was he talking about?

When had Alexander Blackwood ever listened to anything she'd said during their marriage?

"Who is this woman?" Evelyn searched his face.

Alexander's laugh was bitter. "The only woman I've ever truly loved."

"Victoria."

"Wrong." His hands framed her face. "It was always you, Evelyn."
###Chapter 281

"Pfft." Evelyn couldn't contain her bitter laughter. "The woman you love most is your ex-wife Evelyn? Mr. Blackwood, this joke isn't remotely amusing."

Her laughter rang hollow, masking the sharp ache piercing her heart.

That old wound still bled, refusing to heal no matter how much time passed. The memories surfaced - nothing but blood and tears.

And what had he claimed back then? That he loved her?

If love's opposite was hate, then yes, he'd certainly 'loved' her. Loved her straight into the grave!

Alexander's lips curved into a humorless smile at her mocking expression. "You're right. Just a joke."

He laughed at himself, but the pain cut deeper than any blade.

Pathetic. So pathetic he could barely believe it himself.

Yet the truth remained undeniable.

"Joke's over. I'm leaving," Evelyn stated coldly, wrenching her hand from his grasp without hesitation.

But as she turned, Alexander blocked her path.

"Anything else to say, Mr. Blackwood?" Her voice remained carefully neutral.

"I told you to use my name when we meet." His gaze burned into her. "Think carefully about my proposal when you get home."

Their marriage. Again.

This man confused her more by the minute. "Alexander, why would I marry you? Won't seeing my face remind you of the ex-wife you despised? Won't it disgust you? Or are you just a masochist?"

His eyebrow arched slightly. "Assume I am then," he countered, opening the passenger door.

"It's too isolated here. I'll drive you home."

Evelyn studied his unreadable expression before sliding into the car silently.

Returning to her empty apartment, she searched online for their wedding photo from six years ago.

Staring at their younger selves, her mind drifted. Her calm heartbeat stuttered inexplicably.

The memories felt painfully fresh.

There he stood - arrogant yet elegant in his tailored suit, peerless as always.

She'd held his hand walking into the church, beaming with joy.

That smile never graced her face again after that day.

Six years. Six years of nothing but escalating pain after their marriage.

And now this?

That she was the woman he loved most?

"Hmph." Evelyn scoffed, her chest tightening.

'Alexander, it was bad enough you couldn't love me when I lived. Now you mock my memory with these jokes.

'The woman you've always loved is that two-faced witch Victoria!

'Even knowing every horrible thing she did to me, you merely canceled your engagement. Do you think that makes up for your cruelty?

No.

'The suffering you and Victoria endure now is nowhere near enough!'

The kindergarten stood bathed in dusk's glow when Evelyn arrived.

After collecting Amelia, her eyes instinctively searched the playground for Ethan among the scattering children. But he was nowhere in sight.

Her shoulders slumped slightly as she turned to leave - only to freeze at the sight of Eleanor Kingsley emerging with Ethan.

Their eyes met. Fury twisted Eleanor's elegant features.
###Chapter 282

Ethan's presence forced Eleanor to swallow her rising fury.

"Vivian." Ethan looked up with an uncharacteristic smile gracing his youthful features.

Evelyn returned the smile warmly. "Ethan, how are you?"

Eleanor's expression darkened instantly. "Ethan! What did you just call her? Since when do you know this wicked woman?"

"Vivian isn't wicked." Ethan's smile faded as quickly as it appeared, his brows knitting together in distress.

"She absolutely is!" Eleanor spat, her voice rising. "She's the reason your mother is lying in a hospital bed!" Her glare could have melted steel as she turned back to Evelyn. "Vivian Prescott, stay away from my family. I'll make you pay for what you did to Victoria!"

"Pretty Grandma, why are you shouting at Mommy?" Amelia's cotton-soft voice cut through the tension.

Eleanor's attention snapped to the tiny girl beside Evelyn. She'd been ready to unleash her wrath, but the sight of those enormous eyes and porcelain doll features stopped her cold.

The resemblance was uncanny.

She looked exactly like Victoria had at that age.

"See something interesting, Mrs. Kingsley?" Evelyn's voice held a dangerous calm.

Eleanor pointed a shaking finger. "This...this is your daughter?"

Evelyn nodded. "Is that a problem?"

Eleanor's eyes darted between them, her expression shifting through a dozen emotions before settling on contempt. "So the viper has offspring of her own now. Tell me, Vivian, how would you feel if someone hurt your precious child? Did you think my daughter has no one to fight for her?"

Beneath the venom, Evelyn heard the raw pain of a mother's love.

"I'd destroy anyone who harmed Amelia," Evelyn said evenly. "But Mrs. Kingsley, are you certain you truly love your daughter?"

"What nonsense is this?" Eleanor bristled. "Trying to turn me against my own child now?"

Evelyn met her gaze steadily. "What I said on the rooftop was true. Margaret admitted it herself - your biological daughter with Mr. Kingsley died three years ago."

"Lies!" Eleanor's denial came too quickly, too forcefully.

Evelyn watched the flicker of doubt cross Eleanor's face and pressed her advantage. "Time will prove me right. But tell me - did anyone close to you die three years ago?"

The color drained from Eleanor's face.

Evelyn Sinclair had died three years ago.

"Amelia, say goodbye to Ethan. It's time to go home."

"Okay, Mommy!" Amelia waved cheerfully at Ethan.

Evelyn's heart ached at the longing in Ethan's eyes as he watched them. "We'll see each other soon, Ethan."

"Vivian!" Ethan broke free from Eleanor's grasp and ran to Evelyn. "I made this for you." He pressed a simple crystal bracelet into her palm, the sunlight setting the beads ablaze. "In art class. Please wear it always."

The lump in Evelyn's throat made speech impossible. "Ethan—"

"Ethan Blackwood! Get back here this instant!" Eleanor yanked him away without a backward glance.

Evelyn clutched the bracelet like a lifeline all the way home. That night, she fastened it carefully around her wrist - a child's gift more precious than any jewel.

Her hatred for Alexander and Victoria burned as fiercely as ever, but Ethan's innocent affection left ashes of guilt in its wake.

When vengeance came, would this sweet boy learn to hate her too?

Dawn found Evelyn already dressed, determined to find Ethan the perfect gift in return. But as she stepped outside, a black sedan screeched to a halt.

Two masked figures emerged. The chloroform-soaked cloth was over her mouth before she could scream.
###Chapter 283

Nathaniel had tracked down Evelyn's location. When he arrived to check on her, the sight before him was completely unexpected.

"Evelyn!"

His pulse skyrocketed. Without hesitation, he sprinted toward the elevator, determined to follow the vehicle that had taken her.

The black sedan was speeding recklessly, blowing through red lights. Nathaniel matched its dangerous pace, unwilling to lose sight of it. Then two schoolgirls stepped into the crosswalk.

He slammed the brakes.

The tires screeched as he narrowly avoided catastrophe. But in that split second, the getaway car vanished.

His hands trembled as he dialed 911. Then he pulled every string he could to access traffic camera footage.

Three years ago, he'd failed her. Not this time.

'Evelyn, hold on.'

'I swear I'll bring you home safely.'

Willowbrook General Hospital

Victoria lounged casually on her hospital bed, the heavy leg casts and bandages doing nothing to hinder her movements. She'd just returned from the restroom with perfect ease.

Margaret peeked through the door's window before locking it. "They just called," she whispered, a wicked gleam in her eyes. "Everything went exactly as you planned."

Victoria smirked, examining her manicure. "All that arrogance for nothing. She's completely at my mercy now."

"Of course, darling. That nobody could never compare to you." Margaret's greedy smile widened. "Don't forget our arrangement about the money—"

She suddenly stiffened, spotting movement through the glass. "Alexander's coming!"

Victoria instantly transformed—her posture slumped, eyes welling with tears. Margaret rushed to her side, conjuring fake sobs.

"Please darling, don't say such things! Alexander would never abandon you, no matter what!" Margaret wailed dramatically as the door opened.

Alexander's brow furrowed at the scene.

Margaret threw herself at him, face contorted in fake anguish. "Thank God you're here! She's talking about giving up—her face, her legs... I don't know how to comfort her anymore!"
###Chapter 284

"Leave us." Alexander's voice cut through the air like ice as he dismissed Margaret.

Victoria lay motionless on the hospital bed, her fingers twitching slightly as she watched the exchange through half-lidded eyes. Margaret dabbed at nonexistent tears with a practiced motion. "Then I trust you'll take care of my daughter properly. She's fragile right now—no more distress."

With a final glance at Alexander, she swept out of the room, the door clicking shut behind her.

Alexander approached the bed where Victoria lay, her face turned away in a carefully staged display of heartbreak.

"I've arranged for the top specialist in the country to treat your injuries," he said evenly. "Your recovery will be swift. If my presence upsets you, I'll go."

Victoria's head snapped back toward him instantly, her hand shooting out to clutch his wrist. "Don't leave me, Alexander!"

Her eyes shimmered with manufactured tears, her lower lip trembling with Oscar-worthy precision. "You despise me now, don't you? You can't even stand to look at me anymore." Her voice was a fragile whisper, her complexion artfully pale. "I'd rather die than live without you. Don't you understand? I'd give my last breath just to keep you by my side!"

Tears cascaded down her cheeks in perfect synchronization with her dramatic monologue. Alexander remained unmoved, his expression granite.

When her sobs hitched, she peered up through her lashes. "I know I've failed you, Alexander, but we have years of history together. Can't you find it in your heart to forgive me?"

"Forgiveness?" Alexander's laugh held no warmth. His next words struck like a blade. "Did Evelyn ever get that luxury?"

Victoria froze. The question caught her off guard, her pulse stuttering.

She searched his icy gaze, finding no trace of the man who'd once adored her. "So you're discarding me?" Her voice cracked on cue. "You promised to marry me, Alexander. You—"

"I'll honor that promise," he interrupted flatly.

Her breath caught. "You mean it? Oh, Alexander!"

"Every word. Just as I'll mean the divorce papers the moment the ink dries."

Victoria's hopeful expression shattered. "Why?"

"Meeting you felt like destiny once. Every 'I love you' was sincere in that moment." His voice turned lethally quiet. "But it took losing Evelyn to realize those words were just the infatuation of a boy who didn't know what real love was."

Victoria's face drained of color.

A flicker of remorse crossed Alexander's features as childhood memories surfaced, but they vanished when images of Evelyn's suffering flooded his mind. His gaze pinned Victoria in place. "So yes, we'll marry. But without love, all you'll inherit is misery."

"No!" Her nails dug into his arm. "You've never loved anyone else! I'm the only woman you've ever wanted! This guilt over Evelyn is temporary—you don't truly care for her! You can't!"

Her hysterical wails filled the room until Alexander's phone rang, the screen displaying 'Unknown Caller.' Normally he'd ignore it, but the interruption was a welcome escape.

He answered to Nathaniel's furious voice. "It's you again, isn't it, Alexander Blackwood? How much more must Evelyn suffer? Tell me where you've taken her!"
###Chapter 285

Alexander's sharp brows knitted together. "What did you just say?"

Nathaniel's voice was laced with urgency. "When will you stop, Alexander? Until Evelyn dies? Is loving you such a crime? Tell me—where did you take her?" His rapid-fire questions betrayed his growing panic.

But the truth remained—Evelyn was gone. No amount of denial could change that.

Then it hit him. Vivian Prescott.

She was the only reason Nathaniel would believe Evelyn was still alive.

Had something happened to Vivian?

A cold dread settled in his chest.

Without hesitation, Alexander wrenched himself free from Victoria's grasp and turned on his heel.

Victoria stood frozen for two full seconds before snapping out of it. By then, Alexander was already striding out of the hospital room. "Alexander! Where are you going?"

Her frantic cry went unanswered. He didn’t even glance back.

Margaret, who had been waiting outside, pushed the door open just in time to see Alexander disappear down the hallway.

Inside, Victoria hurled a glass of water from the nightstand to the floor in a fit of rage.

Margaret rushed to her side. "What happened? What did he say?"

Victoria's fists clenched, her eyes burning with fury. "He told me he's loved Evelyn his entire life! That woman—that wretched woman—he still wants her!"

Margaret paled. "You mean... the Evelyn from his past? But he thinks you're her! That shouldn’t matter—"

Her words only stoked Victoria's rage.

She understood exactly what Alexander meant.

His heart had always belonged to Evelyn—then and now.

He was so obsessed that he'd even fixated on a woman who resembled her!

And her? She had never truly held a place in his heart.

Everything he'd given her—every kindness—was just him fulfilling promises meant for Evelyn.

A sinister smile curled her lips as she recalled Alexander's abrupt departure.

"Give me your phone."

Margaret handed it over eagerly, her expression greedy. "Tell them to tighten the ropes. Squeeze every last drop from her. Let’s see how high and mighty she acts after that!"

Victoria smirked. "Oh, I won’t stop at squeezing her dry. I’ll make sure she never sees daylight again."

Alexander left the hospital and immediately reached out to Nathaniel.

They agreed to meet. The moment Nathaniel saw him, he lunged forward, grabbing Alexander by the collar.

"You call yourself a man, Alexander Blackwood? I get that you don’t love Evelyn anymore, but why torture her? Why did she have to fall for a bastard like you?"

Alexander remained impassive, his voice icy. "Let go."

His cold stare bore into Nathaniel’s furious expression.

"You played your part in ruining things between Evelyn and me back then, Nathaniel."

Nathaniel scoffed, releasing him with a shove. "You’ve got the nerve to do it but not own up to it?"

Alexander smoothed his collar with deliberate precision, erasing every wrinkle. Then he smirked—a look far more mocking than Nathaniel’s.

"Got the nerve to do it but not own up to it, huh?"

His lips curved slowly into a chilling smile.
###Chapter 286

"What about you, Nathaniel? Did you forget those tacos you shared so intimately with my wife by the roadside?" Alexander's voice dripped with venom, his earlier smirk replaced by an icy glare that could freeze hell itself. "You even had the audacity to send her home afterward. How... thoughtful of you. And that kiss in broad daylight - did you think I wouldn't find out?"

His knuckles turned white as he gripped the chair. "Let me make this clear, Nathaniel. Evelyn will always belong to me. Even in death, her ashes will remain with me! Who do you think you are? Just a delusional fool trying to steal another man's wife."

Nathaniel let out a bitter laugh.

"A homewrecker? That's rich coming from you. Maybe Evelyn wouldn't have suffered Victoria's schemes repeatedly if you hadn't turned a blind eye every single time! You were her accomplice!"

A shadow crossed Alexander's composed features.

He couldn't deny his role in Evelyn's suffering. Half the scars she bore, half the blood she shed - they were all because of him.

Alexander's jaw tightened. "I didn't come here to discuss this, Nathaniel."

Nathaniel realized they'd strayed from the main issue. He studied Alexander suspiciously. "Are you truly not the one who took Evelyn?"

"She's not Evelyn," Alexander emphasized through gritted teeth.

"Still lying?" Nathaniel stood his ground. "Do you expect me to believe there's another woman who looks exactly like her? You must have brainwashed her!"

Alexander's chuckle held no mirth, only endless sorrow. "I wish you were right. At least then... she'd still be alive."

Evelyn awoke groggily after what felt like an eternity.

Blinking against the dim light, she realized her wrists and ankles were bound. The musty air smelled of damp cardboard and rust. The only illumination came from a small rectangular window, its grimy glass showing the fading light of dusk.

The creak of a door hinge made her snap her eyes shut again. Two men entered, their heavy boots scuffing against the concrete floor.

One grabbed her chin roughly. "Tsk. What a pretty little thing. We're gonna have so much fun with her later!"

"Maybe we should sample the goods first?"

"Hell yeah! I can't wait any longer!"

Just as Evelyn prepared to fight back, another voice interrupted.

"Hey! Knock it off!" A third man appeared in the doorway. "The boss lady called. She'll be here soon - wants to watch the show and film it. Save your energy for the main event."

"Damn! That bitch really knows how to party!" The first man reluctantly released Evelyn's jacket.

The door slammed shut, plunging Evelyn back into semi-darkness.

She immediately sat up, scanning her prison. Cardboard boxes formed precarious towers around the room. Beneath the window, broken glass glittered like deadly confetti.

Working her bound hands toward the largest shard, Evelyn began sawing at the ropes. The glass bit into her palms, drawing blood, but she barely flinched. After everything she'd endured, this pain was nothing.

Finally free, she turned to the ropes at her ankles. As she worked, her eyes darted between the window and the stacked boxes - a plan forming.

Just as she cut the last strand, footsteps echoed in the corridor outside...
###Chapter 287

Evelyn's pulse hammered in her throat.

The heavy footsteps outside grew louder. They were at the door now. She had no time left.

She had to move.

Ignoring the sting of her bleeding palms, she dragged an old chair across the floor.

The lock rattled as someone fumbled with it. Clutching a jagged rock, Evelyn climbed onto the chair.

"Damn it! Didn't you just unlock this? Where's the key? Find it—now!" A furious voice barked from the hallway.

Evelyn's lips curled. This was her chance.

She swung the rock at the grimy window.

Crash!

Glass rained down in glittering shards.

Silence. Then—

"Shit! Did that bitch escape?"

"What? She got out?" A woman's shrill voice cut through the air. "Break the damn door down! You two—search outside! She can't have gone far!"

The door burst open with a splintering crack.

Victoria stormed in, flanked by two thugs. Their eyes locked onto the discarded ropes on the floor.

"Vivian Prescott!" Victoria's face twisted. Her gaze snapped to the broken window, where a scrap of fabric fluttered on a remaining shard. "She actually did it. Find her! If you don't, I'll skin you alive!"

"Move! Now!" The men bolted outside.

Victoria kicked the ropes in frustration before stalking out.

The room fell still.

Slowly, Evelyn emerged from behind a stack of crates. Her dark eyes scanned the space before settling on Victoria's retreating figure.

"I knew it was you, Victoria."

No surprise there.

Evelyn exhaled sharply. Her gamble had paid off.

After dying once, she refused to let anyone—especially Victoria—hurt her again.

But escaping wouldn't be easy. Victoria was still lurking outside.

Her phone was gone. No way to call for help.

Evelyn's fingers brushed the crystal bracelet on her wrist. The touch steadied her.

A faint smile curved her lips as Ethan's face flashed in her mind.

How could such a sweet boy have a monster like Victoria for a mother?

And Ethan—he looked nothing like her. Those sharp brows, that quiet intensity—all Alexander.

A growl from her stomach shattered the thought.

She'd been kidnapped before breakfast. The chloroform still fogged her brain.

She couldn't stay here. They'd find her eventually.

Alexander's knuckles whitened around the steering wheel.

The stolen van had been spotted speeding through red lights before vanishing into an alley.

He'd raced there immediately.

The van sat abandoned. No clues. No Evelyn.

They'd moved her.

The sky darkened, mirroring his mood.

Every minute stretched into agony.

He couldn't stop picturing her face—so like Madeline's. The thought of her hurt, afraid—

No.

He would find her.

Alexander prowled the pavement, searching for any sign. His heart pounded a frantic rhythm.

Time was running out.
###Chapter 288

At that precise moment, an unknown number flashed on Alexander's phone screen. 'Riverside Recycling Plant. She's there. Hurry.'

Alexander's pupils dilated. His fingers trembled as he immediately redialed the mysterious number, only to be met with endless ringing.

Without hesitation, Alexander jerked the steering wheel, tires screeching as he executed a dangerous U-turn toward the specified location.

Night had fully descended when Evelyn found herself still trapped in the cramped storage room.

The sudden flickering of overhead lights revealed Victoria still pacing impatiently in the same spot.

Moments later, the hired thugs returned empty-handed.

Naturally, it never occurred to them that Evelyn had remained hidden the entire time, the discarded cloth merely a clever diversion.

The atmosphere turned volatile.

"Worthless! Absolutely incompetent!" Victoria shrieked, jabbing her manicured finger at the men. As she turned to leave, the scar-faced leader blocked her path.

"Listen princess, we did our part. Now pay up."

Victoria tossed her hair with a derisive snort. "You lost the target and still expect payment? Consider yourselves lucky I don't have you eliminated!"

Her haughty exit was abruptly halted when two men seized her arms.

Enraged, Victoria whirled around - only to receive a brutal slap across her bandaged face. The scarred man gripped her jaw with calloused hands, his breath reeking of tobacco.

"Do you know who I am? My fiancé is Alexander Blackwood of Blackwood Enterpr—"

"Shut your filthy mouth!" Another slap landed. "We don't care who you screw. We want our money!"

Victoria's screams pierced the air. "Not my face! The surgery wounds—"

Evelyn instinctively touched her own bruised cheek, the memory of similar pain still fresh.

"I-I have money! Just let me go first!" Victoria's voice turned shrill with panic.

The scarred man's lips curled into a grotesque smile. "Too late for that now, sweetheart."

Victoria's eyes widened with dawning horror. "What do you want?"

The leader traced a dirty finger down her neck. "We expected easy money and some fun. Instead we get a runaway and your bitchy attitude. Time for alternative payment."

After a stunned silence, Victoria sneered. "You think gutter trash like you could touch me? My fiancé owns half of Willowbrook—"

Rip! Fabric tore before she could finish. "Might as well enjoy yourself, princess. Makes the beating hurt less."

Victoria's shrieks turned to whimpers as they forced her onto the filthy concrete.

Evelyn's fist clenched, poised to intervene—then froze.

Hadn't Victoria orchestrated this very scenario for her? The poetic justice made her hesitate.

Karma had arrived with brutal efficiency.

"Such a tease. Fighting us but your body says otherwise," the leader taunted.

Evelyn recoiled as Victoria's protests morphed into moans. The hypocrisy turned her stomach.

Of course. Victoria had always been promiscuous, even during their university days.

A bitter laugh escaped Evelyn's lips. All these years, Alexander had worshipped this very woman.

'Open your eyes, Alexander Blackwood. This is your precious virgin goddess.'

Disgusted, Evelyn covered her ears against the obscene sounds—just as a rat scurried over her feet.

Startled, she stumbled backward, her numb legs buckling. Cardboard boxes toppled with a crash.

Dead silence.

Then—"The hell? She's been here the whole time!"

"Fuck me sideways! The bitch never left!"

"Get her! Now!"
###Chapter 289

The two thugs rushed into the pitch-black room, their hands flailing blindly in the darkness.

Just as they fumbled for their phones, a shadow darted past them from the far wall.

They spun around. In that split second, Evelyn hurled the chair she'd been clutching straight at them before bolting for the exit.

"Shit! She's here!" one thug cursed, arms raised to block the flying furniture.

"Don't let her escape!"

Knowing concealment was pointless now, Evelyn exploited their momentary distraction. She slipped past them as they entered, her heart pounding.

But her luck ran out at the doorway.

There stood Victoria Lancaster, flushed and half-dressed, flanked by two more disheveled men. The sight turned Evelyn's stomach.

"Vivian Prescott?!" Victoria shrieked, pointing with trembling fingers. "You were hiding here the whole time?"

The scarred leader licked his lips. "Clever girl. Fooled us good."

Evelyn didn't hesitate. She sprinted toward the distant gates, her bare feet slapping against cold concrete.

"Stop her!" Victoria's scream echoed through the warehouse.

Rage burned through Victoria's veins. She'd debased herself with these filthy brutes because of Vivian! And still had to pay them afterward!

Though if she was honest... she'd enjoyed it. Alexander hadn't touched her in months. The deprivation had been unbearable.

Footsteps closed in behind Evelyn. She pushed her exhausted body harder, the gates now just twenty feet away.

A meaty arm suddenly wrapped around her waist, yanking her backward.

"Enough running, princess," the thug growled.

"Let go!" Evelyn twisted violently in his grip.

The man laughed. "Not until we've had our fun."

"Disgusting pigs!" Remembering Sebastian's self-defense lessons, Evelyn drove her elbow into the man's solar plexus.

"Ugh!" The thug doubled over, his grip loosening.

The other men froze momentarily before the scarred leader barked orders.

Though Evelyn fought fiercely, hunger and lingering chloroform effects weakened her limbs. A throbbing headache blurred her vision.

As two attackers charged, she swept one's legs out from under him. The remaining thug pulled out a spray bottle.

"Hold still or I'll dose you again!" he threatened.

Evelyn's breath came in ragged gasps. She couldn't black out now - consciousness was her only weapon.

Victoria watched in shock. Since when did Vivian know combat skills?

She was definitely sharper than that idiot Evelyn Sinclair had been.

Not that it mattered now.

Victoria's lips curled into a vicious smile. "Everything you did to me? Do it twice to her."

She gestured dramatically. "Look at that face. Would be a shame to go easy on such beauty. Don't hold back, boys."

The four men advanced with predatory grins, circling their prey.
###Chapter 290

"Enjoy yourself, Vivian Prescott! These men aren't half bad!"

"Have you no shame, Victoria Lancaster?"

"Hahaha... Maybe if you begged, I might have considered letting you go. But since you're being so stubborn, you can just die!" Victoria's bandaged face twisted into a cruel smirk.

Evelyn refused to let Victoria hurt her again, not before she made her pay for everything she'd done.

As the four thugs advanced, Evelyn clenched her fists.

She'd fight to her last breath before surrendering to these monsters.

Spotting a broken pipe near the wall, she lunged for it before anyone could react.

"Oh? A feisty one. I like that." The scarred leader licked his lips, eyeing the makeshift weapon. "You should save your strength, sweetheart. Fighting back will only make this worse for you."

Evelyn stepped forward, her lips curling in defiance. "The only one who should worry is you!"

The men burst into laughter, their confidence unshaken.

In one swift motion, Evelyn drove her knee upward, striking the leader between his legs.

"Argh!" He collapsed, writhing in agony. "You bitch! Destroy her!"

One thug pulled out a chloroform spray, aiming for Evelyn's face.

She inhaled sharply as the chemical fumes hit her lungs. The world spun violently.

Her legs buckled. Even gripping the pipe, she couldn't stop the creeping darkness.

"Run! Why aren't you running?"

"Let's see how tough you are now!"

"Strip her!"

Through the haze, Evelyn saw Victoria's satisfied smile from the sidelines.

'Victoria Lancaster, you murdered my child and tried to kill me countless times. If I die today, I'm taking you straight to hell.'

The hatred burned through the fog, giving her strength to stagger upright.

Victoria's eyes widened briefly before smirking. "Pathetic."

The men grabbed Evelyn's arms, tearing at her blouse.

Suddenly, blinding headlights flooded the room.

Inside the car, Alexander Blackwood's knuckles turned white on the steering wheel. Seeing Vivian surrounded, her clothing torn, unleashed a primal rage.

The engine roared as he aimed directly for the nearest thug. The impact sent the man flying.

Alexander emerged like a storm, his polished shoes connecting with two more attackers.

Evelyn swayed, consciousness slipping.

He caught her just as her knees gave way, pulling her securely against his chest. The warmth of her body against his brought unexpected relief. "I've got you now, Evelyn. You're safe."
###Chapter 291

The drug made Evelyn's head swim.

She thought she heard a voice whispering in her ear—calling her Evelyn, telling her everything would be okay.

She fought to open her eyes, desperate to see who it was, but her eyelids only grew heavier. Instinctively, she curled into the man holding her.

His presence was the only thing anchoring her.

For the first time in years, she felt safe.

Not hunted. Not broken.

Just… protected.

The past had been nothing but pain—every outstretched hand had only pushed her deeper into hell. She had stopped hoping long ago.

But now, with his arms around her, warmth seeped into her bones.

Alexander felt her shift, her fingers sliding up to loop around his neck. The movement snapped him back to reality.

He looked down at the woman in his arms, and for a heartbeat, he saw her.

The one he had lost.

"Vivian," he murmured, forcing himself to remember this wasn’t Evelyn Sinclair.

But God, she looked like her.

"Dizzy…" she whispered, her voice barely audible.

"I'm taking you to the hospital." He lifted her effortlessly, carrying her toward the car.

"Alexander!"

The sharp cry made him freeze.

He turned to see Victoria Lancaster on her knees, tears streaking her face. Her clothes were torn, her hands shaking as she pointed at the unconscious men scattered around them.

"Alexander, they—they hurt me!" Her voice cracked. "I can't—I can't live like this!"

His jaw tightened.

Memories flashed—Victoria as a child, innocent and sweet.

He had never loved her, but he had believed in that innocence.

Now, faced with the truth, something inside him snapped.

The police arrived swiftly, arresting the men while both women were rushed to the hospital.

Eleanor Kingsley and William Montgomery arrived in a panic, their faces pale when they heard what had happened to their daughter.

"How could this happen?" Eleanor sobbed into William's shoulder. "She was supposed to be safe!"

Margaret Dawson stood nearby, wiping fake tears.

What went wrong? she wondered. Victoria was supposed to film Vivian's humiliation—not become the victim herself.

"Where's Alexander?" Eleanor demanded, scanning the room. "Why isn't he here with Victoria?"

Margaret sighed dramatically. "He went to see her—that woman. While our Victoria suffers, he's with that witch."

Eleanor's face darkened. "Unacceptable." She stormed out, demanding to know Vivian's room number.

In the quiet hospital ward, Alexander stood over Vivian's sleeping form.

His chest ached at the memory of how close she had come to disaster.

He reached out, fingertips brushing her brow.

She was breathtaking—every delicate curve of her face a mirror of the woman he had loved and lost.

But she wasn’t her.

And that truth cut deeper than he wanted to admit.
###Chapter 292

Alexander's finger hovered in midair, about to withdraw when Olivia and Nathaniel's adamant voices echoed through his mind.

'She's Evelyn!'

'There's no way two people could look this identical!'

How could they be so certain? Unless...they'd seen some distinctive mark?

A mark.

Alexander remembered the tiny birthmark above Evelyn's left collarbone.

His mind flashed to Vivian clutching her towel tightly that night she'd stayed over for Ethan. Had it been nervousness...or fear of discovery?

His pulse quickened. Gazing at Evelyn's sleeping form, his fingers moved to the top button of her hospital gown.

One. Two. Three buttons undone in rapid succession.

The door burst open just as his hand brushed the fourth button.

"What do you think you're doing, Alexander?" Sebastian strode in, immediately pulling the blanket over Evelyn's exposed shoulders.

Alexander withdrew his hand, his piercing gaze locking with Sebastian's.

"How exactly did you smuggle my wife out of the country back then?"

Sebastian's lips curved in a calm smile. "What nonsense are you spouting now? Surely you don't still believe Vivian is Evelyn?"

Alexander's jaw tightened, refusing to answer.

A soft chuckle escaped Sebastian as he sighed. "The dead don't return, Alexander. Nor do I possess such miraculous powers. Evelyn's death grieves me too, but perhaps...for her, it was a mercy."

Alexander's eyes darkened. "Mercy?"

"Was I wrong? She gave you her heart, her soul, waited her whole life for you. And what did she receive in return? Not even basic human decency. You never truly saw her."

Ice flooded Alexander's veins at Sebastian's words.

"You only wish Vivian were Evelyn because you can't bear the weight of your guilt. In your eyes, she's just a vessel for your atonement."

"Enough!" Alexander's voice cut through the room like a blade, his chest heaving.

The memories of how he'd hurt Evelyn were unbearable. Each recollection made his very existence feel like a crime.

She'd loved him unconditionally until her last breath.

And he'd repaid her with nothing but torment.

"I'm getting Vivian's medication. Don't do anything foolish." Sebastian warned before turning on his heel.

Outside the door, Sebastian allowed himself a small, satisfied smile as he watched Alexander's hollow stare.

'No pill can erase regret, Alexander. Love lost is love wasted. You don't deserve Evelyn anymore.'

In her unconscious state, Evelyn began to dream. She was back on Pinecrest Heights beach where she'd first met Alexander years ago. The salty sea breeze carried the sweetness of young love.

They ran hand in hand, carefree and laughing. How simple life had been then.

Perhaps that's when the first thorn had pierced her heart. With every subsequent meeting, it dug deeper until the pain became unbearable - until death seemed preferable...

Evelyn's brows furrowed as the dream shifted to that fateful night three years ago. Her fingers twisted in the sheets as she began murmuring in her sleep.

"Why, Alex? Why couldn't you just believe me..."
###Chapter 293

For a brief moment, Alexander thought he heard someone whisper "Lex." The sound jolted him back to reality as his confused gaze landed on Evelyn.

Her delicate brows were furrowed, those rosebud lips parting slightly as if speaking in her sleep.

"Why...?"

Evelyn's expression twisted further at the murmured question.

'Why?'

'Did she just say why?'

Studying the distress on Evelyn's sleeping face, Alexander leaned closer to catch her words.

"Why won't you believe—"

BANG!

Just as Alexander moved to press his ear nearer to Evelyn's lips, the hospital door crashed open.

The interruption came right before he could hear Evelyn's full sentence.

His sharp eyes darkened with irritation as he lifted his gaze, meeting the intruder with icy displeasure.

Eleanor stormed in, fury radiating from every pore. "How dare you sit here mooning over this woman while my daughter remains hospitalized because of you, Alexander Blackwood! And to think you'd kiss her too! What does that make Victoria?"

Kiss her?

Alexander's frosty stare could have frozen lava. Clearly Eleanor had seen him leaning toward Vivian and drawn the wrong conclusion.

With deliberate casualness, the proud Alexander met Eleanor's glare, his sensual lips curling. "Yes, I kissed her. Got a problem with that?"

Eleanor's face purpled. "How can you say such things, Alexander? Victoria—"

"Victoria and I are no longer engaged." Alexander's voice turned arctic, disgust flashing in his mesmerizing eyes. "How many times must I repeat this before it penetrates that thick skull of yours?"

"You—" Eleanor clutched her chest as rage threatened to choke her. "You heartless monster! Victoria devoted years to you. You were her entire world! And now you discard her for this Madeline Crawford lookalike witch? Have you no shame, Alexander?"

"Enough!" Alexander's roar silenced Eleanor mid-tirade.

His handsome features twisted with fury, eyes glinting like shards of ice. "I won't tolerate anyone insulting her again."

"Her?" Eleanor rolled her eyes dramatically at the sleeping Evelyn, assuming Alexander meant Vivian Prescott. "Hmph. The Lancasters will make you pay for hurting Victoria, Alexander. And this scheming witch won't escape justice either!"

With that final threat dripping with aristocratic menace, Eleanor stormed out.

Alexander remained unfazed. The Lancasters might be one of Willowbrook's elite families, but they were gnats compared to the Blackwoods.

Since when had threats ever worked on Alexander Blackwood? He feared no one.

His only terror? The memory of Evelyn's lifeless body in his arms, crimson staining her lips...

He'd wanted to hear more of Evelyn's sleep-talking, but the moment had passed after Eleanor's interruption.

After studying Evelyn's peaceful face a moment longer, Alexander turned and left.

Only when the door clicked shut did Evelyn dare open her eyes.

Eleanor's dramatic entrance had startled her awake.

Pretending to sleep, she'd absorbed every venomous word about both her past and present selves.

A bitter smile touched Evelyn's lips as unshed tears burned behind her eyelids.
###Chapter 294

The foggy memories from before she lost consciousness finally sharpened into focus.

She remembered Alexander appearing like a storm to rescue her at the last possible moment.

His strong arms had wrapped around her trembling body. His deep voice had whispered reassurances against her hair. Without thinking, she'd melted into his embrace, craving the safety only he could provide.

Evelyn's pulse quickened, that treacherous rhythm she knew all too well.

Her teeth sank into her lower lip. Fingernails dug crescent moons into her palms.

'No. This can't be happening again.'

'I despise him!'

'Every ounce of love died when he pushed me into that abyss.'

'Like survivors of shipwrecks who never long for the ocean again.'

'But I swear, Alexander, you'll understand drowning soon enough.'

Eleanor returned to Victoria's hospital room just as Alexander arrived.

A smug smile curled Eleanor's lips, convinced her earlier words had finally penetrated his stubbornness.

"Took you long enough to show concern for Victoria," Eleanor sniffed, her tone glacial.

"Victoria has suffered unimaginably, Alexander." Margaret dabbed at dry eyes with a tissue. "Four men... I can't even say it. You must stay with her now. In this state, who knows what desperate actions she might—"

Alexander's frosty glare silenced Margaret mid-sentence.

The older woman's crocodile tears evaporated under his piercing scrutiny. She quickly looked away, fingers twisting the damp tissue.

"I thought you were watching Victoria this entire time?" Alexander's voice could have frozen hell. "How did she end up at Riverside Recycling Plant?"

"I—I stepped out for water!" Margaret stammered. "When I returned, she was gone!"

"With two fractured legs? Quite the miraculous recovery."

"Someone must have taken her!" Margaret blurted. "It had to be Vivian! She orchestrated this whole—"

"Careful." Alexander's warning cut through the room like a blade. "Accuse Vivian again without proof, and you'll regret it."

Margaret's mouth opened and closed like a stranded fish. Cold sweat beaded along her hairline.

"I'll find the evidence!" Eleanor declared suddenly. "No one else would be this cruel to Victoria!"

Alexander's dark brows drew together. Before he could respond, a nurse emerged. "She's awake but extremely agitated. Don't upset her further."

"Victoria!" Eleanor wailed dramatically, face contorted in exaggerated distress.

She moved to enter but Margaret grabbed her arm. "Let Alexander go first. He's who she needs right now. We can speak with her later."

Eleanor nodded eagerly.

Turning to Alexander with watery eyes, she implored, "Comfort her, please. Don't break her heart again!"

Ignoring them both, Alexander pushed open the door.

The spacious VIP suite appeared empty at first glance.

No sign of Victoria in the pristine hospital bed.

His gaze flicked toward the balcony before a sound from the ensuite bathroom caught his attention.

The door stood ajar.

Steam curled from the shower stall where Victoria stood under the spray, fully clothed.

Revulsion twisted Alexander's features. He turned sharply away, jaw clenched.
###Chapter 295

To be completely honest, Evelyn was the only woman Alexander had ever seen without clothes.

Alexander recalled being utterly intoxicated both times he'd supposedly gotten Victoria "pregnant". Only through Victoria's words the next morning did he learn they'd slept together.

Yet now, the blurred silhouette of Victoria in the shower repulsed him.

"Sob... Why, sob..." Victoria's heart-wrenching cries echoed from the bathroom.

Alexander grabbed the bedsheets and entered with lowered gaze, wrapping them around her.

"Come out."

As he pulled her from the bathroom, he noticed Victoria's legs were perfectly fine.

Displeasure flickered in his icy eyes as anger creased his brow.

"Alexander!" Victoria threw herself against his chest, her arms clinging like tentacles.

"Why, Alexander? Why did this happen to me? They took turns... It hurts. Why me? I feel so filthy, so violated! Sob..."

"You won't want me now, will you? Not after this. You once called me the purest girl you'd ever met. But your Lillian is tainted now..."

Alexander's fingers twitched at hearing the nickname "Lillian".

His Lillian.

He should have let her go when he fell for Evelyn.

So why did that name still twist his heart?

He knew he felt nothing for Victoria.

The internal conflict deepened his scowl.

When Alexander didn't respond, Victoria pushed away dramatically. She grabbed a fruit knife and pressed it to her wrist.

"What are you doing?" Alexander demanded. "Put it down."

Victoria shook her head tearfully. "You think I'm disgusting now. You'll never marry me. My life is ruined, my face changed. The man I love rejects me. What's left to live for?"

"I love you, Alexander. Maybe in another life..."

As she delivered her lines, Victoria's lips curled slightly as she applied pressure.

Alexander lunged forward, wrenching the knife away.

"Let me die! Just let me die!" Victoria fought hysterically for the blade.

The knife's edge sliced Alexander's hand, blood welling instantly.

Victoria paled. "Alexander! God, I'm sorry! I didn't mean to!" she babbled.

Alexander studied his wound calmly before fixing Victoria with an arctic stare. "You arranged Vivian's kidnapping, didn't you?"

Victoria froze mid-reach for the emergency button. "What? Why would I do that?"

"Wouldn't you?"

"Never!" she lied. "Unless... you don't believe me? Don't you trust your Lillian?"

"Trust?" Alexander's lips twisted sardonically. "How can I when you're standing here completely unharmed?"

Victoria's pupils dilated. She grabbed his arm frantically. "I didn't mean to lie! My legs were injured, just not badly. The doctor exaggerated! That wasn't my fault!"
###Chapter 296

Despite her desperate attempts to justify herself, Alexander's gaze remained clouded with unmistakable disappointment and suspicion.

"Alexander..." Victoria's voice trembled.

"You're nothing like the girl I knew growing up." Alexander's laugh held no warmth. "So much so that I'm beginning to question whether you're truly the same person."

Victoria's pupils contracted in panic. "That's absurd! I'm your Lillian, Alexander!"

"Lillian." Alexander rolled the name thoughtfully on his tongue before abruptly withdrawing his arm. "I'll be investigating this matter thoroughly. You'd better pray your name stays clean."

Victoria stood frozen, her mouth opening and closing soundlessly as she watched Alexander stride away. Her fists clenched until her nails bit into her palms.

No matter what it took, Alexander must never discover her involvement in this!

Two days later, Evelyn signed her discharge papers and headed straight for Victoria's hospital room.

As she approached the door, Eleanor's soothing murmurs reached her ears. The maternal affection in those words made Evelyn's chest constrict painfully.

Her own mother was comforting this monster.

Hearing Eleanor's departing footsteps, Evelyn ducked into an alcove. Only when the older woman's silhouette disappeared down the corridor did she slip into Victoria's room.

Victoria's hopeful expression shattered upon seeing Evelyn. "Vivian Prescott!"

"In the flesh." Evelyn's lips curled into a razor-sharp smile as she sauntered in. "How disappointing. I expected Alexander to be here. I wouldn't have bothered visiting otherwise."

Victoria's mouth twisted. "Mind your manners, Vivian. What gives you the right to address Alexander so familiarly? What are you implying?"

"Nothing much. I simply wanted to see Alexander, so here I am."

"You—"

"Tsk. Hard to believe, isn't it, Victoria Lancaster?" Evelyn's eyes glittered dangerously. "That you've become ensnared in your own trap. Would you call this poetic justice or tragic irony?"

Evelyn's aristocratic features remained composed as she watched Victoria's face darken with rage.

"That's how Evelyn Sinclair died last time, wasn't it? By your hand? But remember this well—I'm not Evelyn. I won't lie down and let you torture me at will. If I were you, I'd reconsider those despicable methods. You're outmatched, Victoria."

"Shut your mouth, you bitch!" Victoria hurled her water glass at Evelyn in a blind rage.

Evelyn sidestepped gracefully.

Neither woman anticipated Alexander's sudden appearance in the doorway.

The glass shattered against his broad frame, shards grazing his cheekbone.

"Alexander!" Victoria gasped, her face draining of color.

Evelyn immediately pressed a delicate hand to her chest. "Alexander, you're here. I feared I might not live to see you again."

Her voice caressed his name with intimate familiarity as she lifted her mesmerizing gaze to meet his startled one.

Victoria's eyes bulged. "Vivian Prescott! How dare you address my fiancé like that? What's with that look?"

"Alexander insisted I call him that." Evelyn's smile was all innocence.

"What?" Victoria choked out.

Evelyn draped herself against Alexander's arm, her eyes sparkling with mischief. "Perhaps you should explain this to Miss Lancaster, darling. Everything I said is true. Oh, and how you mentioned you'd make me your wife if I said yes, remember?"
###Chapter 297

A satisfied smile curved Evelyn's lips as she met Alexander's gaze, her words deliberately provoking Victoria until visible veins throbbed at the woman's temples.

"How dare you interfere between Alexander and me, Vivian Prescott! I'm the only woman he's ever loved - why would he marry someone like you?"

Victoria practically flung herself off the hospital bed in distress, rushing toward Alexander with tears welling in her eyes, the perfect picture of fragility.

"She's lying, isn't she? Tell me she's lying, Alexander!"

"She's not." Alexander's immediate response left Victoria gaping like a fish out of water.

Evelyn's smile deepened with satisfaction. "Who knows what might have happened if you hadn't saved me, Alexander. Are you free tonight? I'd like to properly express my gratitude."

"My schedule is clear," he replied smoothly, his gaze sweeping over her. "Have you fully recovered?"

"Completely." Evelyn's eyes sparkled as she turned a meaningful look toward Victoria. "I should thank you too, Miss Lancaster. I never realized how deeply Alexander cared for me until your little... performance."

Victoria's face flushed crimson with humiliation. Noticing Alexander's deepening frown, she abruptly switched tactics, bursting into dramatic sobs. "Why does everyone insist on hurting me? What have I done to deserve this? Must I die before you'll stop tormenting me?"

With a theatrical wail, she shoved past Evelyn and fled the room.

Alexander's arm shot out to steady Evelyn as she stumbled from the impact. For one breathless moment, she found herself pressed against his chest, enveloped in his crisp, masculine scent that made her pulse stutter.

Regaining her balance, Evelyn quickly extracted herself from his hold, glancing toward the doorway. "Aren't you going after her? What if she tries jumping again—"

Alexander cut her off with a derisive chuckle. "If she were truly suicidal, she wouldn't have survived the first attempt."

Evelyn's eyes widened in surprise.

Had he seen through Victoria's manipulations all along?

"You mentioned wanting to thank me? Let's go." Alexander turned on his heel.

Evelyn hesitated only a moment before following.

She treated him to dinner at Willowbrook's most exclusive restaurant, where crystal chandeliers cast golden light over linen-draped tables.

Later, as Alexander's luxury car pulled up to her apartment building, he caught her wrist just as she reached for the seatbelt.

"Mr. Blackwood?" Evelyn turned, eyebrows raised in question.

"It was Alexander earlier," he murmured, his breath warm against her ear. A teasing smile played across his devastatingly handsome features. "When did we revert to formalities?"

Evelyn offered a polite smile. "Very well, Alexander. Was there something else?"

"Do you understand the implications of what you told Victoria Lancaster today?" His gaze held an unreadable intensity.

Evelyn blinked innocently. "I merely stated facts, though I apologize if I've made things awkward between you and your... companion."

"I don't want your apology." With a sudden tug, Alexander pulled her startlingly close.

Their faces were mere inches apart now, breaths mingling in the confined space.

"Marry me, Vivian."

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat despite herself.

She hadn't expected his words to affect her so deeply.

Perhaps hatred and attraction were two sides of the same coin.

A bitter smile touched her lips as she pulled away. "What an amusing suggestion, Mr. Blackwood. You have your precious Victoria, and I'm promised to Sebastian. Besides..." Her voice dropped to a whisper. "We both know it's only this face that interests you. How ironic that the very features you despise are what caught your attention."

The pain in her eyes was unmistakable as she turned to leave, the door closing with finality between them.
###Chapter 298

Evelyn met Alexander's intense gaze before withdrawing her arm and stepping out of the car with finality.

A carefree smile played on her lips as she felt his eyes tracking her every move.

'Have you finally seen Victoria's true colors, Alexander?'

'Yes, but it's far too late now.'

'Too late for these wounds to ever fully heal. You may want to use who I am now to ease your guilt, but I'll be the one pushing you toward your downfall.'

Alexander waited until Evelyn's silhouette disappeared before turning his car around.

He purchased eighty-eight crimson roses and drove to the cemetery.

Countless words swirled in his mind, yet when standing before Evelyn's grave, they all caught in his throat.

After a prolonged silence, he finally murmured, "Perhaps I'll bring her to meet you someday. You'd be astonished to find your mirror image walking this earth."

His fingers traced the engraved name as autumn sunlight bathed him in warmth that couldn't penetrate the perpetual winter in his heart.

Upon returning, Alexander became determined to uncover the truth behind Vivian's kidnapping.

The four captors confessed everything - how Victoria had masterminded the entire scheme.

They even admitted taking turns with Victoria, emphasizing she'd participated willingly.

Disgust churned in Alexander's stomach at their testimony.

She volunteered?

The investigation results felt impossible to reconcile with the girl he'd once loved.

Victoria had been his first love, a cherished secret kept close to his heart.

Now, with each revelation exposing her true nature, Alexander struggled to recognize the Lillian he'd met on Pinecrest Heights beach all those years ago.

She'd become someone unrecognizable.

Margaret Blackwood called again, demanding Alexander visit Victoria.

She hung up before he could respond.

Though he'd investigated the kidnapping, one mystery remained unsolved.

Who had sent him Vivian's exact location that night?

Every lead turned cold.

Returning to Blackwood Estate, Alexander froze at the sight of his and Evelyn's wedding portrait - meant to hang above their bed - now discarded by the entrance.

A storm darkened his striking features as he took the stairs two at a time.

He'd permitted no one in their bedroom since Evelyn's death, personally maintaining its sanctity.

Yet now, laughter and chatter spilled from the open doorway.

His fury mounted with each step. Inside, he found Victoria lounging on the bed he'd preserved for Evelyn's memory.

"You're back, Alexander." Victoria offered a demure smile.

"Who allowed you in here?" Each icy word made her flinch.

Her eyes darted toward the bathroom. "Alexander, I—"

"It was me!" Eleanor Kingsley emerged, chin raised defiantly. "Don't like it? Take it up with me instead!"
###Chapter 299

A voice echoed from the bathroom, passionately defending Victoria.

Alexander's glacial stare swept through the room like an arctic gale. "You let her stay here?"

"What's wrong with Victoria living here?" Margaret Blackwood countered, her tone growing increasingly defiant. "She's your fiancée, and you share Ethan together. A family should live together!"

Her words rang with misplaced confidence, oblivious to the storm brewing in Alexander's eyes.

"After everything Victoria's endured, it's your duty as her fiancé to comfort her," Margaret continued, patting Victoria's shoulder protectively. "Not waste time with that scheming woman!"

Her expression hardened as she glared at her son. "I know you like to make your own decisions, Alexander, but you will listen to me this time. I'm your mother! Stay away from Vivian Prescott—she's nothing but trouble. She's definitely involved in what happened to Victoria!"

"Did you remove the photograph?" Alexander's voice cut through the air like a blade.

Both women flinched. Margaret lifted her chin defiantly. "So what if I did? That woman died years ago. Why keep her picture hanging like some shrine? It disgusts me! If you want wedding photos, hang ones with Victoria!"

She crossed her arms, unaware of the icy aura thickening around her. "I've already had her things cleared out. Every trace of that woman is gone."

Alexander turned sharply and strode to the closet.

Yanking it open, he found Evelyn's few remaining garments replaced by Victoria's designer wardrobe. His grip on the door turned white-knuckled, veins standing out against his pale skin. A blizzard raged in his darkened eyes.

His mother's voice pursued him. "Victoria is staying here permanently. I'll announce your marriage to the press. Make sure that witch knows her place and disappears!"

The closet door slammed with enough force to make both women jump.

"It's not her who needs to disappear." Alexander's voice dripped with lethal calm.

Margaret finally registered the danger in her son's demeanor. "Alexander! How dare you speak to me like this? I'm your—"

"You will return every item you removed by tonight," he interrupted, each word precise as a scalpel. "Or you can forget being Margaret Blackwood."

Her mouth fell open. For the first time, she noticed the murderous glint in his eyes—like he might carve her heart out with his bare hands.

Her bravado crumbled. "A-Alexander, I only want what's best for you! Can't you see how traumatized Victoria is—"

"Everything will be exactly as it was before I return." He turned on his heel, leaving them gaping in his wake.

The moment he hit the driveway, Alexander punched the accelerator. Fury radiated from him in waves.

He dialed Vivian while driving.

The call connected. "I need you," he demanded without preamble. "I'm pulling up now."

He hung up before she could refuse, then powered off his phone—ensuring she couldn't call back.

When the elevator doors opened to reveal Vivian waiting in her lobby, the tempest inside him stilled.

The sight of her—so like Evelyn—soothed the raging storm in his soul. For one suspended moment, he could pretend his wife still lived.

The illusion was bittersweet agony.
###Chapter 300

Evelyn stepped into the sleek black sedan as it accelerated toward Pinecrest Heights.

The golden autumn sun dipped low, casting long shadows across the coastal cliffs. A briny ocean wind carried memories of the past, though the ancient pine trees stood unchanged, the moment felt entirely different.

Pinecrest Heights had become a place Evelyn despised ever since Alexander first brought Victoria there.

She could still hear Victoria's words echoing in her mind - how she'd described meeting Alexander in nearly identical terms to Evelyn's own first encounter with him.

Was this cruel irony or just fate's twisted sense of humor?

Lost in thought, Evelyn turned to see Alexander uncorking an expensive bottle of wine.

"What's troubling you so deeply that you'd drive all this way?" Evelyn asked, feigning innocence. "Is this place special to you?"

She tilted her head. "Or perhaps this is where you and Victoria first became intimate?"

The cork popped with perfect timing as Evelyn finished speaking.

Alexander's dark eyes locked onto hers, his lips curving into that dangerously charming smile that caught the dying sunlight.

"How would you feel if someone discarded everything precious to you?" His voice held an edge.

"Precious things?" Evelyn's brow furrowed. "Like what?"

He simply smiled that enigmatic smile, retrieving two crystal glasses from the car's minibar.

"Drink with me," he commanded, though his gaze softened with something unreadable.

Evelyn accepted the glass and drained it effortlessly.

There were few things about her past self she hadn't mastered now. Alcohol held no challenge.

Alexander's eyes gleamed with unexpected admiration.

The sunset painted Evelyn's porcelain skin in warm hues, enhancing her striking features.

"An '82 Lafite," Evelyn remarked, swirling the ruby liquid. "You're being generous tonight, Mr. Blackwood." She arched an eyebrow. "Care to share what's put you in such a mood?"

She continued before he could answer. "I gave my statement at the police station yesterday. They confirmed Victoria orchestrated the kidnapping." Evelyn studied his reaction. "I assume you already knew? Is that why you're upset?"

Alexander downed his wine in one smooth motion.

Another ocean breeze swept through as twilight descended. Streetlights flickered to life around them.

His intense gaze never left hers. "Will you press charges?" The question came abruptly.

Evelyn blinked. "Excuse me?"

"I'd like to convince you not to."

His words struck her like a physical blow.

'Even now, Alexander? After everything, you still defend her?'

Evelyn forced a careless smile. "Victoria must mean the world to you, Mr. Blackwood." Her fingers tightened around the glass. "But tell me - what possible reason could you have for protecting such a monster?"
###Chapter 301

A sardonic smile played on Evelyn's lips, her eyes glinting with irony.

"How can you still say such things, Alexander Blackwood?"

"Whether as my past self or who I am now, what did I ever do to deserve Victoria's cruelty?"

"In your eyes, is everything she does justified?"

Evelyn's fingers tightened around her wineglass stem while Alexander remained lost in thought.

After a long pause, he lifted his intense gaze to meet hers.

"I owe her," he finally admitted.

Evelyn's brow furrowed. "What could you possibly owe her?"

Alexander's eyes drifted from Evelyn's luminous gaze to the distant horizon over the sea.

"I failed to keep my promise to her. This is my way of making amends."

A bitter chuckle escaped Evelyn's throat.

'So you couldn't fulfill your vow to Victoria, and now you're compensating her?'

'But Alexander, when have you ever kept your promises to me? When did you ever try to make things right?'

'You dismissed my memories of our childhood meeting and trampled every pledge you ever made to me.'

"I'm afraid I can't accommodate your request." Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes as she stared ahead. "Everyone must face the consequences of their actions."

"You wanted to thank me for saving you the other day," Alexander countered swiftly. "Consider this your gratitude—drop the charges."

Evelyn's eyes widened momentarily before a cold, mocking laugh bubbled up. She studied the handsome features before her.

'Oh, Evelyn Sinclair.'

'Is this really the man you pined for all these years? This man who can't even distinguish right from wrong?'

"Very well." Evelyn set down her glass with deliberate slowness, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "You must love Victoria Lancaster desperately to go to such lengths. Why don't you stop pretending and just marry her already? You two are truly... 'meant to be.'"

She emphasized the last words with heavy irony.

Turning on her heel, Evelyn moved to leave, only for Alexander to seize her wrist.

"I won't let your sacrifice be in vain." His warm breath brushed her ear. "Name anything, Vivian, and I'll do it—no questions asked."

"You're really going all out for Victoria." Evelyn's lips curled in derision. "Remember those words, Alexander. You'll regret them soon enough."

Regret.

That word again.

Alexander's heart clenched as he studied her striking features, his gaze unreadable.

He refused to make choices he'd later regret.

The night deepened, and the wine disappeared—mostly consumed by Alexander.

As far as Evelyn was concerned, he'd summoned her just to drown his sorrows over Victoria.

What was so special about that woman that Alexander felt compelled to protect her?

He'd claimed he would end their engagement. Yet every action since had been for Victoria's benefit.

The absurdity wasn't lost on Evelyn.

If this was true love, then love was utterly ridiculous.

Checking her watch, Evelyn noted the late hour. Her phone buzzed from inside the car, but as she reached for the door, Alexander suddenly pushed her inside.

Evelyn scowled, irritation coloring her tone. "Alexander, what—"

Her protest died as she turned to find his face mere inches from hers, his dark eyes clouded with alcohol. He was clearly intoxicated.

Trapped between his body and the car, Evelyn found no escape from his proximity.
###Chapter 302

"You're attracted to me, aren't you?" Alexander's velvety whisper caressed Evelyn's ear with intoxicating warmth. "I can sense it."

His tone left no room for argument, those mesmerizing hazel eyes burning with absolute certainty.

Evelyn's breath hitched at their proximity and his bold declaration.

"You're intoxicated," she countered evenly, though uncertainty flickered in her gaze.

Was this genuine drunkenness or calculated performance?

"Drunkenness has its perks," he murmured with a lazy smile. "At least this way I get to see her..." The last word nearly dissolved into the night air.

The evening breeze danced through his tousled hair as his expression softened with an affection Evelyn had never witnessed before - raw, vulnerable, and utterly disarming.

He studied her face intently before closing the remaining distance between them. Each exhale carried the rich aroma of aged whiskey that made her pulse quicken.

"I've missed you desperately," Alexander confessed abruptly, his intense stare pinning her in place.

Evelyn's heart stuttered. As she raised her hands to push him away, his fingers traced the curve of her cheekbone with devastating tenderness.

Skin against skin, she found herself drowning in those hypnotic eyes that seemed to set her entire face aflame.

"Release me, Alexander."

"Never again," he vowed, fingertips now brushing her eyebrows with reverence, as if memorizing every detail. "I'll never let you slip away again."

Her traitorous heart hammered against her ribs with chaotic rhythm.

Though she couldn't decipher his thoughts, the naked adoration in his gaze threatened to unravel her defenses completely if she didn't look away soon.

When she attempted to break free once more, Alexander captured her lips in a searing kiss that stole her breath. The contrast of his cool mouth against her heated skin sent electric currents down her spine.

Evelyn's eyes flew open in shock. She never anticipated this bold move.

His long lashes cast delicate shadows beneath the amber streetlights as he kissed her with single-minded focus, his expression more solemn than she'd ever seen.

Sensing his intention to deepen the kiss, Evelyn abruptly turned her face aside.

His lips grazed her flushed cheek instead before he buried his face in the curve of her neck, his entire weight leaning into her. "God, how I've missed you," he slurred, every fiber of his drunken being consumed by Evelyn Sinclair - the woman he'd finally acknowledged as his heart's true desire.

Only the car at her back prevented Evelyn from collapsing under their combined weight and the emotional whirlwind. Drunk people always felt twice as heavy, and Alexander chose that precise moment to succumb to sleep.

The crisp autumn breeze cooled her heated skin as dawn's first light crept over the horizon, rousing Alexander from his alcohol-induced slumber. Fragments of the previous night surfaced slowly - Evelyn's presence had felt so tangible, the memory of their kiss branded into his consciousness.

Taking stock of his surroundings, he found himself alone in the car, clothes disheveled, Vivian conspicuously absent.

Stepping out, his breath caught at the silhouette before him - barefoot on the sand, golden hair dancing in the morning wind, cheeks still faintly pink. The living embodiment of his dream.

'Evelyn.'

The name echoed through his mind as he moved toward her.

Noticing his approach, Evelyn turned from the ocean to offer a tentative smile. "Finally awake?"

Alexander nodded, remorse shadowing his features. "Did I... overstep any boundaries last night?"

Evelyn's brow furrowed thoughtfully. "They say alcohol reveals one's true nature, don't they?"

His expression darkened immediately. "Are you saying we...?"

"How do you intend to take responsibility for this, Alexander?"
###Chapter 303

Alexander's pupils dilated. "You mean last night, we—"

Evelyn nodded before he could finish.

Anguish flickered across Alexander's face.

He couldn't deny his attraction to the woman before him, but he knew it stemmed from his unresolved longing for Evelyn.

He had meant every word when he said he wanted to marry her, but he had sworn never to touch another woman after Evelyn.

He had sought out Vivian out of selfishness—just to gaze at a face identical to hers, to ease the guilt festering inside him.

Yet now…

He felt like a complete bastard.

He claimed to love her, yet he had succumbed to temptation in a drunken haze.

"Look at you," Evelyn said coldly. "So distressed. Is it because I remind you of the wife you despised? You must feel disgusted with yourself."

Her words snapped him back to reality.

Under the morning light, her delicate features glowed, mirroring her so perfectly that he couldn't bring himself to call her "dirty."

Though the details of last night were hazy, Alexander remembered a dream—one filled with warmth, with Evelyn in his arms.

Seeing the turmoil in his eyes, Evelyn's lips curled into a bitter smile before hardening.

"I understand. Don't look for me again, Mr. Blackwood. We're done."

She turned to leave.

Alexander caught her wrist. "Vivian."

She yanked her arm free without looking back.

As she stepped forward, a sharp pain shot through her foot, forcing her to stumble.

"Damn it—"

"What's wrong?" Alexander steadied her, noticing how she balanced on her toes. He knelt, brushing aside the sand to reveal a shard of glass embedded in her sole, its tip stained red.

Without hesitation, he scooped her into his arms. "Let me treat that."

"I don't need your help." She shoved at his chest, but he held firm.

Her stubbornness reminded him of Evelyn—how she'd endured every torment with her head held high.

Ignoring her protests, he carried her down the path toward Pinecrest Heights, his expression unreadable.

Evelyn stopped struggling.

The scenery blurred before her eyes.

Over a decade ago, she had stepped on glass just like this, and a twelve-year-old Alexander had carried her to the clinic.

He had comforted her the whole way, whispering promises to protect her forever.

Yet in the end, he had been the one to hurt her the most.

Her vision swam with unshed tears.

Alexander glanced down, startled by the moisture in her eyes. His chest tightened inexplicably.

For a moment, he couldn’t tell if this ache was for the Evelyn he had once loved too late—or for the woman in his arms now.
###Chapter 304

The air between them grew thick with unspoken tension, neither uncomfortable nor hostile.

Alexander carried Evelyn across the remaining distance to the clinic, his strides purposeful yet measured. The familiar white building stood unchanged after two decades, its freshly painted walls the only evidence of time's passage.

To their astonishment, the same physician still practiced there. Dr. Hayes' silver hair caught the afternoon light as she adjusted her glasses, her movements precise despite her age.

Recognition flashed in her eyes the moment Alexander stepped through the door. "I never forget a face," she remarked warmly while cleaning Evelyn's wound. "Especially one as striking as yours, young man."

Evelyn offered a grateful smile. "Thank you, Doctor."

Dr. Hayes peered closer, her experienced fingers working deftly. "I always knew you two would find your way back to each other."

Evelyn's breath hitched. Swallowing the bitter irony, she feigned confusion. "You...remember us?"

"Of course!" The doctor chuckled. "This young man carried you in here years ago, drenched in sweat from running under the summer sun. The panic on his face - I've never seen someone so terrified over a scraped knee." Her eyes twinkled. "You made such a striking pair. Some patients stay with you forever."

Evelyn hadn't anticipated this living relic of her past. Not from Alexander, who'd long since buried those memories.

Her gaze flickered to him. The deep furrow between his brows surprised her. Was he actually remembering? Or merely regretting?

"All set," Dr. Hayes announced. "Take your wife home now. Childhood sweethearts marrying - how lovely."

The term landed like a physical blow. Childhood friends. Former lovers. Once husband and wife. The doctor had guessed the beginning but never imagined the tragic middle or bitter end.

Alexander lifted Evelyn effortlessly, his expression distant as they retraced their steps. The doctor's words echoed in his mind. That summer day...but the girl had been Victoria, hadn't it? Evelyn must resemble her enough to confuse the aging physician.

"Put me down here," Evelyn said quietly. "I'll call a car. Let's pretend last night never happened."

Alexander halted abruptly, his grip tightening. "I meant what I said about marriage. Last night changes nothing - my decision was made before then." His voice brooked no argument. "Your wedding to Sebastian won't happen, because you'll be my wife first."

He delivered her to her apartment door with infuriating determination, carrying her up the stairs without hesitation. Only when he'd gone did Evelyn step into the shower, watching her reflection emerge through the steam. The innocent girl from the clinic was gone, replaced by someone far more dangerous.

Her lips curved. The game was progressing exactly as planned.

Alexander found the Blackwood Estate restored to order upon his return, every discarded item miraculously returned to its place. Only Victoria's presence in the sitting room disturbed his fragile peace.

"Where were you?" Her wounded whisper cut through the silence. "Do you think less of me now? Is that why you stayed away?"

He studied her face with new suspicion, Dr. Hayes' words still ringing in his ears. "That seashell you gave me when we first met," he said abruptly. "I gave you something in return. Do you still have it?"
###Chapter 305

Evelyn froze, her pulse quickening. "Why are you asking me this so suddenly, Alexander?"

"Did you lose it?" His voice was like ice.

"Of course not!" Evelyn's response came too fast. "It's a gift from you. I've treasured it all these years."

Alexander studied her with piercing skepticism. "Show me."

Evelyn hesitated, then forced a tender smile. "Are you wondering if I've missed you all this time? I have. That's why I've kept everything you ever gave me safe. I'll prove it right now!"

She rushed from the room before he could respond.

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn returned clutching a delicate leaf bookmark between trembling fingers. The preserved maple leaf, perfectly laminated between transparent sheets, showed no signs of age despite the years.

"See, Alexander?" She extended it toward him with practiced sweetness, her voice dripping with nostalgia. "I still remember those days when I was the only one who mattered to you."

Alexander accepted the bookmark with measured calm. The familiar veins of the leaf confirmed its authenticity.

This was indeed the one he'd made all those summers ago.

Victoria was that girl.

He set the bookmark aside without comment, watching as relief flickered across Evelyn's face.

She'd been thorough. After sensing Alexander's suspicion during her return, she'd dispatched someone to track his movements. The report of his visit to Pinecrest Heights had chilled her blood.

That diary stolen from Vivian's belongings had been her salvation. Finding the pressed leaf tucked between its pages had been nothing short of divine intervention.

Now, seeing Alexander's expression soften, Evelyn played her final card. Tears welled in her eyes with practiced ease.

"I'm sorry for entering your room without permission. Please forgive me?" Her fingers crept toward his sleeve. "I just... I need to stay here. The thought of being alone terrifies me. But with you and Ethan nearby, I feel safe again."

Alexander withdrew his arm sharply. "Stay if you must." The words held no warmth.

The estate was already tainted. Her presence changed nothing.

Evelyn beamed. "Really? Oh Alexander, our family can finally be together again!" She moved closer, eyes shining. "I knew you wouldn't abandon me. You promised to take care of me forever—"

"Forever." Alexander's mouth twisted into a humorless smile.

Vivian recounted every detail of the previous night to Sebastian as he stood silhouetted against the floor-to-ceiling windows, his silence more telling than any response.

"He believes we slept together. That's why he's so determined to marry me now."

A bitter laugh escaped Vivian's lips as she studied Sebastian's rigid posture.

"Alexander never believed a word I said when it mattered. He always took Victoria's side no matter how many times she framed me." Her nails bit into her palms. "Now they'll know how that feels."

The heavy silence that followed was broken only by the distant chime of a grandfather clock.
###Chapter 306

Sebastian turned slowly, the golden hues of dusk accentuating the sharp contours of his face. Concern softened his aristocratic features as he studied Vivian's determined expression.

"Just one question, Vivian." His voice carried the gentle warmth of a summer breeze, though his piercing gaze held something fiercer. "Are you absolutely certain about this path? You barely escaped that monster's grasp. Do you truly wish to chain yourself to him again?"

Evelyn hesitated momentarily before cold resolve hardened her delicate features. "The pain and humiliation I endured mean nothing compared to what they did to my child's ashes. That is a debt that must be repaid in blood."

Her fists clenched so tightly her nails left crescent marks in her palms. The fire of vengeance burned bright in her eyes - the sole purpose that had sustained her through rebirth.

Sebastian didn't argue further, recognizing the unshakable conviction in her stance. Instead, he lifted her hand, pressing a chaste kiss to her knuckles. "Promise me you'll protect yourself. If anything goes wrong, come to me immediately."

The ice in Evelyn's eyes thawed slightly under his tenderness. A fragile smile touched her lips as she met his shimmering gaze. "Thank you, Sebastian. When this is over, Amelia and I will return with you to France. We'll build a simple, happy life together."

"Very well." His lips curved in a faint smile as he drew her into an embrace. But hidden in the shadows of his affectionate gesture, darker intentions lurked.

Meanwhile, Victoria had settled comfortably into Alexander's mansion. Her treatment of Ethan had undergone a complete transformation as she played the doting mother to secure Alexander's proposal. Each morning she rose early to prepare breakfast and personally drove the boy to school.

Yet Ethan remained unresponsive to her saccharine overtures, his silent rejection only fueling her resentment. During their drives, Victoria prattled incessantly while the child remained mute, engrossed in his tablet.

Victoria's smile twisted into a sneer when she glimpsed the strange app on his screen - numbers and coordinates she couldn't comprehend, culminating in a blinking red dot that miraculously coaxed a rare smile from the usually expressionless boy.

As the car halted at the kindergarten gates, Victoria barely had time to feign maternal concern before Ethan bolted from the vehicle. Her eyes narrowed in irritation until she spotted Evelyn waiting at the entrance.

Shock turned to fury when she saw Ethan's face light up at the sight of that woman. Victoria lunged forward to grab him just as a car came careening toward them.

"Ethan!" Evelyn's scream pierced the air as she saw the out-of-control vehicle barreling toward the child. Victoria's first instinct was to shove the boy aside and dive for cover.

Time seemed to freeze as Evelyn sprinted toward danger, her heart pounding against her ribs. The world narrowed to one thought - she couldn't lose him again.
###Chapter 307

Evelyn dashed toward Ethan without hesitation, throwing all caution to the wind. Her body moved on pure instinct to shield the little boy, consequences be damned.

Wrapping her arms around Ethan's small frame, Evelyn knew escape was impossible. She braced for impact as the screeching tires grew louder.

Just as horrified screams erupted from bystanders expecting tragedy, the car jerked to a sudden halt.

From her vantage point, Victoria cursed under her breath. How perfect it would have been if that reckless driver had eliminated both Vivian and Ethan in one fell swoop!

As the vehicle stopped mere inches away, the world seemed to hold its breath around Evelyn.

Slowly, she loosened her protective embrace to examine the trembling child pressed against her. Unexpected tears pricked at her eyes.

"It's okay now, sweetheart. Auntie Vivian promised to keep you safe, remember?" Her voice was soft as she gently ruffled Ethan's hair.

The boy lifted tear-filled eyes brimming with complex emotions. "Mama..."

That word again.

Evelyn's heart clenched painfully. She pulled Ethan closer, understanding his desperate need for maternal comfort after Victoria's constant neglect.

"Ethan!" Victoria's shrill voice cut through the moment as she stormed over. "Unhand my son, Vivian Prescott! How dare you touch him?"

Before Evelyn could react, Victoria roughly shoved her aside and snatched Ethan away.

"Are you hurt, baby? Mommy was so worried!" Victoria's saccharine tone dripped with false concern.

Ethan squirmed in her grasp before breaking free and rushing back to Evelyn. Spotting the scrape on her knee, he immediately offered his handkerchief.

Evelyn's chest warmed at the silent gesture. "It's just a scratch, darling. Don't fret."

As she reached to pat his head, Victoria slapped her hand away. "Keep your hands off him! I see right through your scheme to worm your way into Alexander's life through my child!"

Gritting against the sting in her knee, Evelyn rose gracefully, her regal bearing making Victoria shrink back. "You sacrificed your own son to save yourself. Remarkable parenting, Miss Lancaster. Truly remarkable."

Victoria's face flushed crimson as she yanked Ethan's arm. "We're going to the hospital right now!"

Ethan resisted, casting pleading looks at Evelyn, but the arrival of police officers halted any intervention.

The culprits—a bickering couple—profusely apologized, the girlfriend having grabbed the wheel at the last second to prevent disaster.

Meanwhile at Blackwood Enterprises, Alexander absently clicked on a breaking news alert about a near-fatal accident outside a prestigious kindergarten.

Normally indifferent to such reports, he found himself inexplicably drawn to the footage showing a familiar woman sprinting toward a small figure in school uniform.

The camera angle shifted just as the car barreled toward them, the screen filling with metal and smoke before cutting to black.
###Chapter 308

The screen went black.

"Vivian."

Alexander replayed the security footage twice, his pulse hammering against his ribs. Snatching his car keys, he immediately called Evelyn.

No answer.

He sped toward the accident location. Just before arriving, his phone rang.

Seeing the caller ID, Alexander exhaled in relief.

He tapped his earpiece. "Vivian?"

"It's me."

That familiar voice instantly eased the tension coiling his muscles.

They met ten minutes later. Alexander's intense gaze swept over Evelyn's unscathed appearance. "You're truly unharmed?"

Evelyn glanced at the minor scrape on her knee. "Just a scratch. Rather than fussing over me, Mr. Blackwood, perhaps you should be more concerned about your son."

Alexander frowned. "Ethan?"

"Yes. I must ask - is Ethan truly Victoria's child?" Evelyn's brow furrowed. "I was shocked to see her abandon him to an oncoming vehicle while fleeing to safety."

Alexander's expression darkened as he recalled the footage - Vivian risking her life to shield a boy while Victoria was conspicuously absent.

"Let me take you home." Alexander moved to support her, his arm naturally encircling her shoulders.

"I'd prefer accompanying you, if possible. Victoria just took Ethan away. I want to ensure he's alright."

Studying her striking profile, Alexander nodded. "Very well. We'll go to my estate."

Throughout the drive, Alexander kept stealing glances at the rearview mirror, suddenly invested in her wellbeing.

She occupied a different space in his world than others.

As they entered the Blackwood Estate, memories flooded Evelyn - Victoria framing her for the staircase incident, Alexander forcing her to kneel all night in the rain after her prison beating.

His cruelty toward their unborn child. His endless tolerance for Victoria's wickedness.

Standing by as she suffered under the merciless downpour.

"Penny for your thoughts?" Alexander's rich baritone snapped her back.

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Just wondering if I should share some interesting news with you."

"Interesting news?" Alexander's eyes narrowed slightly.

The car halted at the gates just as Victoria and Eleanor emerged with a stone-faced Ethan.

Spotting Alexander and Evelyn together, Victoria froze before storming forward.

"What are you doing at my home, Vivian Prescott?" she demanded harshly.

Alexander turned with displeasure. "Mind your tone. Vivian is my guest."

"Vivian?" Victoria's anger flared. "Why bring this woman into our home, Alexander? And why say her name so... intimately?"

"Are you questioning me?" Alexander's voice turned arctic, his gaze piercing. "Perhaps you should answer me first. What exactly were you doing when Ethan nearly got hit by that car? As his mother."

"I-I tried to save him but twisted my ankle!" Victoria stammered.

"Twisted your ankle?" Evelyn chuckled darkly. "At least make your lies believable, Miss Lancaster."

"You!" Victoria pointed accusingly. "You're poisoning Alexander against me! I wouldn't have fallen if you hadn't pushed me! I'd never let Ethan get hurt! Alexander, don't believe this scheming woman's lies!"
###Chapter 309

Evelyn gazed at Alexander with her captivating almond-shaped eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "Alexander, Ethan is our precious child," she said, voice trembling with emotion. "I would protect him with my very life. How could you think I'd ever abandon him?"

At that moment, Eleanor approached with Ethan in tow, her disdainful glare fixed on Evelyn. "Miss Prescott," she sneered, "I heard you're engaged to Alexander's uncle. Why then do you keep hovering around my daughter's fiancé? Were you raised without any sense of decency?"

Evelyn maintained her composure, lips curling into a serene smile. "An excellent question, Mrs. Kingsley. My parents couldn't teach me that lesson - they were too busy bringing home another woman's child while abandoning their own flesh and blood."

Alexander's head snapped up at this unexpected revelation. Seeing the bittersweet smile playing on Evelyn's lovely face sent an inexplicable pang through his chest.

Both Eleanor and Victoria froze in shock.

'Her story... it's eerily similar to Evelyn's,' Victoria thought, unease creeping into her mind.

Eleanor's mocking expression faltered, her confidence momentarily shaken.

Noticing their reactions, Evelyn's smile deepened. "While my birth parents failed me, the woman who raised me didn't. So let me ask you this, Mrs. Kingsley - with all your high society breeding, how did you raise a daughter so devoid of maternal instinct that she'd abandon her own child to save herself? Your parenting skills seem rather... lacking."

"How dare you!" Eleanor sputtered, face flushing with rage. "Apologize to Victoria immediately or I'll make sure you regret this!"

"Mother..." Victoria's eyes welled up with crocodile tears as she turned to Alexander. "Do you hear how she slanders me? This woman has tormented me relentlessly. All my suffering stems from her cruelty. Why must my life be so tragic?"

Eleanor comforted her "distraught" daughter before rounding on Evelyn. "Vivian Prescott, you'll pay for humiliating my child! You shameless harlot, scheming to steal Alexander from—"

"The one pursuing whom here isn't Vivian," Alexander's icy voice cut through Eleanor's tirade. His stormy expression silenced the room. "This discussion ends now."

"What? She orchestrated Victoria's kidnapping and you're just letting it go?" Eleanor's eyes blazed with indignation. "I won't allow my daughter to be victimized! Victoria, darling, I'll see justice served!"

Victoria's gaze flickered nervously. Playing the martyr, she declared, "Truth will prevail. Those who commit evil will face retribution!" Her accusatory stare landed on Evelyn.

Evelyn smiled knowingly. "How right you are, Miss Lancaster. Karma has a way of catching up with people."

Victoria paled, suddenly unable to meet Evelyn's penetrating gaze.

"Now that Ethan is safe, I can rest easy." Evelyn turned her gentle smile toward the silent boy watching her. "Goodbye, Ethan."

The child's large, expressive eyes brimmed with unspoken words, but he remained quiet.

"You're leaving?" Alexander's voice was low, intense.

"Should I stay and endure more abuse?" Evelyn arched a brow, acutely aware of Eleanor's venomous glare. Though she told herself not to care, the sting of rejection from her own flesh and blood still lingered.

"I'll take you home," Alexander offered.

Victoria's face darkened. "Alexander! Ethan and I just survived a trauma! How can you leave us now?"

"Mr. Blackwood, stay with your family. Don't trouble yourself over an outsider like me." With a final glance at Alexander, Evelyn turned gracefully.

"Hmph! At least she knows her place," Eleanor muttered.

Victoria's satisfaction lasted mere seconds before Alexander strode after Evelyn.

"Alexander!" she cried, but he didn't so much as glance back.
###Chapter 310

Evelyn, who had only walked a short distance away, allowed a subtle smile to play on her lips.

Her strategic retreat had worked perfectly. As expected, Alexander's attention was now firmly on her.

Alexander opened the car door for Evelyn with unexpected gentleness.

Sliding into the passenger seat, Evelyn caught sight of Victoria's furious expression in the rearview mirror. The sight filled her with quiet satisfaction.

As the car pulled away, Evelyn feigned distress. "Even though I promised not to pursue the kidnapping case further, it seems they're planning to sue me instead? The thief playing victim - I won't tolerate this injustice."

"That won't happen," Alexander assured firmly.

Evelyn studied him with amusement. "You're certainly going above and beyond for Victoria's sake."

Alexander's expression darkened at her words. He opened his mouth to refute, then closed it again without speaking.

After a weighted silence, he seemed to recall something. "Earlier you mentioned having good news to share. What is it?"

Evelyn arched an elegant brow, her smile turning playful. "About that..." she trailed off, her clear eyes studying his profile.

"I want to revisit your home tonight. Another one of those candlelit dinners you used to make me. Then I'll share my news."

Alexander's grip tightened on the steering wheel at her words. He nearly missed the red light ahead.

When their eyes met, Evelyn saw something flicker in his gaze. His heartbeat seemed to accelerate for reasons neither could explain.

Their next stop was the grocery store, where they moved through the aisles with an easy familiarity that could be mistaken for newlyweds. Evelyn selected ingredients while Alexander carried the basket.

Back at the estate, as they unpacked groceries, Alexander received an urgent call from Blackwood Enterprises. Before leaving, he invited Evelyn to wait in his bedroom.

She accepted.

Stepping into the bedroom triggered a flood of conflicting emotions.

She should despise this place.

Yet seeing the unchanged decor - nearly identical to three years ago - left her momentarily disoriented.

The outdated but well-loved dresses still hung in the closet. The bedsheets, though faded, were the same set she'd chosen with such hope.

That hope had been crushed the night Alexander never came to share their marriage bed.

A noise downstairs snapped Evelyn from her thoughts.

Peering over the railing, she saw Victoria gleefully unpacking their groceries. The younger woman began preparing an elaborate meal, even setting out candlesticks - clearly planning her own romantic dinner.

Evelyn heard Victoria's failed call to Alexander, followed by a saccharine voicemail: "Alexander, it's Victoria. I've prepared a special candlelight dinner. When will you be home? It's been so long since we dined together. You must join me tonight."

Victoria hung up with affected shyness before retreating to her room.

Evelyn descended the stairs with deliberate calm. Surveying the lavish spread in the kitchen, she smiled knowingly.

Victoria reappeared moments later.

Finding Evelyn seated at the kitchen island, Victoria's face twisted in outrage. "What are you doing here? Who gave you permission—"

Evelyn looked up leisurely, taking in Victoria's plunging neckline and overpowering perfume - the cloying scent betraying its expensive origins.

With regal composure, Evelyn arched a brow. "Soon this will be my home. Why shouldn't I be here? The real question is - why do you keep trespassing? Shall I have you removed myself?"
###Chapter 311

Hearing those words, Evelyn didn't react with anger this time. Instead, a knowing smile curved her lips.

"Victoria Lancaster, I believe you've finally lost your mind. How can you say such things to me without an ounce of shame?"

"I'll be perfectly sane long after you've gone mad," Vivian Prescott countered smoothly, unfazed by the confrontation.

"Given how things stand now, do you honestly think Alexander would still want you?"

"Ha! Stop deluding yourself!" Victoria crossed her arms, her sneer dripping with arrogance. "Vivian Prescott, let me make this clear. No matter how you change your appearance, the woman Alexander loves most will always be me. I'm one of a kind!"

Evelyn's lips curled at Victoria's overconfident display. "One of a kind?" she repeated, savoring the irony. With elegant fingers, she picked up the expensive Bordeaux, pouring a generous amount into the crystal glass before her.

"A vile, scheming snake like you certainly is rare in this world. I suppose you could be called a 'unique' specimen," Vivian mused, swirling the crimson liquid before taking a refined sip.

"You bitch! How dare you!" Victoria's face darkened instantly. Seeing Vivian casually enjoying the wine she'd prepared for her romantic dinner with Alexander sent rage coursing through her veins. "That was for my candlelit dinner with Alexander! How dare you touch it!"

Without warning, Victoria lashed out, knocking the glass from Vivian's hand. Ruby droplets splashed across Vivian's pristine white dress.

Spotting the stains, Victoria smirked in satisfaction.

"Hmph, Vivian Prescott. Save your pathetic efforts. With that face identical to that whore Evelyn's, you're destined to be crushed beneath my feet just like she was! You're no different from that trash. You're not even worthy to be my opponent - you don't deserve to lick my shoes— Ah!"

Victoria's triumphant rant was cut short as icy liquid cascaded over her face. She shrieked, blinking wine from her eyes to see Vivian holding the now-empty glass.

"You—" Victoria gasped, chest heaving with fury. The expensive wine dripped from her hair, tracing paths down her still-healing scars before staining her designer dress.

"Excellent vintage. Did you get a proper taste? If not, I'd be happy to pour you another glass." Vivian smiled serenely, lifting the bottle with graceful fingers and tilting it threateningly over Victoria's designer heels.

Victoria scrambled backward, gaping at Vivian's audacity.

"What's wrong? Not a fan of red wine? Perhaps you'd prefer your own cooking?" Vivian arched a perfect brow. With deliberate movements, she began scooping up Victoria's carefully prepared dishes and dumping them at the woman's feet.

"How about these? More to your taste?"

Victoria's jaw clenched. Seeing both her seduction outfit and gourmet meal ruined, her face twisted with barely contained rage.

Vivian met her glare with amused defiance, which proved too much for Victoria's fraying control.

"Vivian Prescott, you miserable bitch!" she shrieked, lunging forward.

Vivian's smile never wavered. She lifted the wine glass and hurled it at Victoria's feet.

The crystal shattered explosively, sending shards skittering across the marble floor.

"Ah!" Victoria jerked back, stumbling into the cabinet behind her. She hadn't expected Vivian to actually throw something at her!

"You! How dare you—" Victoria sputtered, trembling with incoherent fury. "Vivian Prescott, you must have a death wish! Fine! Since you're so eager to die, I'll make sure you suffer exactly like that bitch Evelyn - trapped between life and death!"
###Chapter 312

A murderous glint flashed in Victoria's eyes. Her gaze was so sharp it could have sliced Vivian into a thousand pieces.

She snatched the scissors from the cabinet, gripping them tightly as she lunged at Vivian with deadly intent.

Rage consumed her. She wanted to make Vivian pay—in blood.

But Vivian didn’t flinch. Instead, she sidestepped effortlessly.

Her movements were calm, calculated. In one swift motion, she caught Victoria’s wrist mid-air, stopping the scissors inches from her face.

Victoria’s eyes widened in shock. She tried to strike with her free hand, but Vivian saw it coming.

A sharp crack echoed through the room as Vivian’s palm connected with Victoria’s cheek.

Victoria gasped, clutching her face. The wound from the knife hadn’t even healed, and now the sting of the slap burned through her skin.

"My face!" she shrieked, her voice trembling with fury.

When she looked up, Vivian’s cold, mocking stare sent a chill down her spine.

"Does it hurt?" Vivian smirked. "Like salt in an open wound?"

"Let go of me, Vivian Prescott!" Victoria snarled, struggling against Vivian’s iron grip. "If you don’t, I swear—I’ll make you regret this!"

"Regret?" Vivian’s lips curled into a dangerous smile. She tightened her hold, making Victoria wince.

Her eyes turned icy. "Listen carefully, Victoria. I’m not the same Evelyn Sinclair you used to manipulate."

"I know everything you did to her. Just because I look like her doesn’t mean I’ll let you play the same games."

Vivian tilted her head, her gaze dripping with disdain. "Look at yourself. Your face, your heart—everything about you is rotten. Do you really think Alexander would still want you?"

She scoffed. "Forget being the lady of Blackwood Estate. You’re not even fit to step through its gates."

With that, she shoved Victoria away.

Victoria stumbled back, her rage crumbling under Vivian’s dominance.

She touched her throbbing cheek, glaring at Vivian, but no words came.

Just then, the doorbell rang.

Victoria’s head snapped toward the sound.

Alexander.

Instantly, her expression shifted. The fury vanished, replaced by tears and feigned vulnerability.

She rushed toward him, throwing herself into his arms.

Alexander frowned, instinctively trying to push her away—until she started sobbing.

"Alexander!" she cried, clinging to him. "Why does Miss Prescott keep tormenting me? She already arranged for those men to kidnap me from the hospital, to humiliate me!"

She choked back a sob. "She said I’m filthy, that I don’t deserve you. She threw the food I made for you on the floor—laughed at me! And then she hit me!"

Her voice cracked. "She’s terrifying, Alexander!"

As her accusations spilled out, Alexander’s gaze shifted past her.

His eyes locked onto Vivian standing in the light.

Worry flickered across his face.

He pushed Victoria aside and strode toward Vivian.

"Vivian," he said, his voice low. "What happened?"
###Chapter 313

Evelyn Sinclair never expected Alexander Blackwood to push her away so effortlessly. The shock left her speechless.

She heard Alexander call out "Vivian Prescott" with palpable anxiety. That tone—so full of worry and tenderness—had once belonged to her alone.

Now, it was directed at another woman.

What stunned Evelyn even more was seeing Victoria Lancaster sprawled on the floor, looking fragile and wronged, as if she'd been shoved down.

"Why are you sitting there?" Alexander strode toward Victoria, dropping to one knee. His expression softened with rare concern.

Victoria lifted her eyes, glancing pointedly at Evelyn behind him.

"If I told you this refined Miss Lancaster pushed me, would you believe me?" Her voice was sweetly innocent, her gaze locked onto Alexander’s.

Evelyn’s fists clenched. "Vivian, how dare you lie? I never touched you! You’re the one who ruined the dinner I prepared for Alexander—you even hit me!"

Her voice cracked as she clutched Alexander’s arm. "Alexander, don’t let her fool you. She attacked me! I didn’t lay a finger on her. You believe me, don’t you?"

She searched his face, desperate for reassurance.

But Alexander ignored her. Instead, he reached for Victoria, helping her up with surprising gentleness.

"Ow!" Victoria winced.

Alexander’s gaze dropped to the bruise on her leg—the one from the car accident that morning.

"Does it hurt?"

"A little."

"I’ll take care of it." His arm slid around her waist, guiding her to the sofa with meticulous care.

Evelyn’s chest burned. Envy, jealousy, and hatred twisted inside her.

When Alexander retrieved the first-aid kit, her composure shattered.

"Alexander, you’d really choose to believe this scheming witch over me?" She jabbed a finger at Victoria. "Can’t you see she’s faking?"

Alexander paused, the antiseptic wipe in his hand. "Faking? The car accident was fake? Her saving Ethan was fake? This wound—also fake?" His voice was ice.

Evelyn’s mouth opened, but no words came.

Victoria smirked, dimples flashing. "Miss Lancaster, you’ve always thought I wanted to steal Alexander from you. That’s why you target me. But the truth has a way of revealing itself. Alexander knows what you’ve done. A few lies won’t change that."

"You—!" Evelyn nearly lunged at her.

Rage choked her. She had always been the one manipulating others. When had the tables turned?

How dare you, Vivian Prescott!

Her nails dug into her palms as she glared at Victoria’s smug face.

"Go reflect on your actions," Alexander dismissed coldly.

Evelyn trembled with fury. But all she could do was force out a sob. "After all these years together, you’d betray me like this? I’m heartbroken!"

She covered her face and fled, tears streaming.

Alexander didn’t even glance after her. His focus remained on Victoria’s injury.

But Victoria watched Evelyn go, satisfaction curling her lips.

That felt good.
###Chapter 314

"Evelyn, now you finally understand how it feels when the man you love doesn't trust you."

"Everything I've done today is nothing compared to the humiliation and schemes you put me through in the beginning."

"Of course, what I plan to return to you will be far more than this."

"I always seem to hurt you unintentionally." Alexander's deep, gravelly voice softened. "But I promise this will never happen again."

Vivian turned her head just as he looked up.

Their gazes collided unexpectedly. His ocean-deep eyes swirled with dizzying intensity, instantly capturing her full attention.

Her heartbeat quickened inexplicably. A warm flush crept from her ears to her cheeks.

She stared dazedly at his impossibly handsome face, her pulse accelerating. The clear pools of her eyes gradually clouded, taking on a sultry, intoxicated glow.

Seeing Vivian's flushed cheeks and half-lidded gaze fixed on him, Alexander's own heartbeat stuttered.

The face before him perfectly mirrored the woman in his memories. The resemblance stirred something deep within him.

Yet he knew with absolute certainty they were different people. He shouldn't feel this way. But his erratic pulse betrayed him, creating dangerous illusions.

An unexpected tenderness seemed to be taking root in his heart for this woman.

"Why are you looking at me like that?" he murmured.

Vivian startled. Her breathing and heartbeat had gone haywire, overwhelmed by that once-familiar heat.

Then realization struck.

"I tasted the wine Victoria prepared for you earlier. I think she drugged it to keep you here tonight. I'm feeling... strange now."

Through sheer willpower, she articulated her suspicion clearly.

Alexander's expression darkened instantly. A shadow of sorrow crossed his striking features, displeasure knitting his brows.

Six years ago, he'd believed Vivian used drugs to fabricate their relationship. No matter how she'd pleaded or accused Victoria, he'd refused to listen.

Now history repeated itself, proving him wrong yet again.

Crushing guilt constricted his chest, making breathing difficult.

How many wrongs had he committed against her? Could he even count them all?

And even if he could, how could he possibly atone?

As Alexander wrestled with these thoughts, Vivian swayed unsteadily to her feet.

Her movements were clumsy, like someone intoxicated.

Alexander immediately rose and caught her in his arms.

The moment she fell against that familiar-yet-unfamiliar chest, the heat intensified. His distinctive scent teased her senses, sending feather-light tremors through her body.

"Let me go. I need to return—"

"Do you really think I'd send you back to Sebastian in this state?" His husky voice sent shivers down her spine.

Vivian lifted her liquid gaze. "Then what? Are you suggesting I stay with you like this?"

Alexander's voice dropped lower. "We've been intimate before. Why not again? Besides, it would help your current... condition."

"—"

Without waiting for her response, Alexander swept her into his arms and carried her toward the bedroom—
###Chapter 315

Alexander's expression was deadly serious, but Evelyn had no intention of rekindling anything with him. That night at Pinecrest Heights, she had merely taken advantage of his drunken state to deceive him.

She refused to let this ruthless man manipulate her heart again.

Evelyn tried to pull away, but her consciousness was slipping. Her body felt foreign, reacting against her will.

The drug dulled her senses, making her lean helplessly into Alexander's broad chest.

With each breath, his cold, masculine scent and the warmth of his body threatened to unravel her completely.

Victoria had truly gone all out. A single sip, and the effects were overwhelming.

As Alexander carried her toward the bedroom, Evelyn mustered the last shreds of her willpower and gripped his collar tightly. "Alexander, let me go—"

Her voice came out breathy, seductive. A rejection that sounded like an invitation.

Alexander glanced down at the flushed woman in his arms and kept walking.

"Put me down! You can't—"

Her protest died as cold water shocked her system.

He had placed her in the bathtub. "Don't worry. I won't force you into anything."

His voice, gentle as a mountain spring, soothed the fire raging inside her.

The words stunned her.

"Hold on. You'll be okay."

That tender reassurance, so unlike him, acted like a sedative. Her panic ebbed.

When he reached to remove her dress, Evelyn caught his wrist.

"I can do it myself. Get out."

Feeling the heat of her skin, Alexander nodded. "Call if you need me. I'll be right outside."

"Okay." She released his hand with effort.

The moment the bathroom door closed, Evelyn turned the faucet to cold and drenched herself completely.

Outside, autumn rain began to fall, pattering against the windows.

Alexander stood by the sill, listening to the shower run. His thoughts drifted.

Memories flooded him like the storm outside.

He remembered Evelyn presenting evidence of her innocence—evidence he'd destroyed without hesitation to protect Victoria.

Her tearful question echoed in his mind: Do you even care if I die?

His cruel response haunted him now: Are you dead, then?

Those words must have shattered her. Now, the pain pierced him a thousand times worse.

Only after losing her had he realized her worth.

Evelyn, I regret everything.

But you never gave me a chance to make it right.

I've lost.

A bitter smile touched his lips as he stared into the rainy night. His eyes burned.

Crash!

A loud thud from the bathroom snapped him back. Without thinking, Alexander rushed inside.

Evelyn sat drenched in the tub, her expression dazed.

His gaze darkened as he scooped her up. The soaked dress clung to her curves, and when his hands touched her skin, she shuddered.

"Vivian, are you okay?"

The worry in his voice was unmistakable.

Evelyn shook her head weakly. "I'm fine. Just... let me stay under the water a little longer. It's helping."
###Chapter 316

Evelyn instinctively pushed against his chest, but Alexander's arms remained locked around her. Without hesitation, he kicked off his polished leather shoes and stepped into the overflowing bathtub, fully clothed.

The shock of his actions made Evelyn's breath catch.

Ice-cold water cascaded from the showerhead, soaking through Alexander's tailored suit within seconds. Yet he stood motionless, his embrace unyielding as the freezing water drenched them both.

As minutes ticked by, Alexander's gaze grew unfocused behind Evelyn. His fingers tightened around her waist almost imperceptibly as he drank in the familiar curve of her neck.

"Evelyn..." The name slipped from his lips like a prayer.

Her long lashes fluttered open, droplets clinging to them like morning dew. The cold water had brought her back to full awareness.

She'd heard it clearly. That tender inflection he'd once reserved for someone else.

'How ironic,' she thought bitterly. 'I used to dream of hearing my name spoken with such affection.'

'But those foolish hopes died long ago, shattered beyond repair.'

Morning light filtered through the curtains when Evelyn awoke in Alexander's massive four-poster bed. Her pulse spiked as she realized two things simultaneously: she wore nothing beneath the silk robe, and the distinctive birthmark on her left breast was partially exposed.

She yanked the neckline closed, mind racing.

What happened after she'd passed out? When had her soaked dress been removed? The memories were frustratingly blank.

If Alexander had undressed her... he would have seen the telltale mark.

The door clicked open.

Alexander strode in, impeccably dressed in a three-piece suit that screamed power and privilege. No trace remained of last night's vulnerability.

His sharp eyes immediately noted Evelyn's death grip on her robe. "You're awake," he remarked smoothly. "Feeling better?"

Evelyn schooled her features into calm indifference. "What time did I fall asleep?"

"Nearly dawn," he answered without hesitation.

"Did you change my clothes?"

A faint smirk played on his lips. "Relax. I have standards. The robe went on first, then the wet dress came off."

Evelyn arched a skeptical brow. "I'd like to freshen up now. Alone."

"Of course." He gestured to an adjoining door. "Everything you need is in the dressing room."

"Thank you."

Alexander paused at the threshold. "No need for formalities. Soon this will all be yours anyway." The door clicked shut behind him.

Alone again, Evelyn examined the birthmark in the full-length mirror. His explanation made sense. If he'd recognized her, there would have been explosions, not polite breakfast invitations.

Alexander Blackwood never showed mercy to those who deceived him.

Downstairs, the dining room showed no evidence of last night's chaos. Crystal sparkled, silver gleamed, and fresh flowers perfumed the air.

Alexander held her chair with old-world courtesy before taking his seat opposite.

He sipped his espresso, watching her over the rim. "While I took care not to overstep last night," he began casually, "I couldn't help but notice a rather distinctive mark on your person."

Evelyn's fingers froze around her juice glass.

Was this a trap? Had he recognized the birthmark after all?
###Chapter 317

Though startled internally, Evelyn maintained her poised demeanor, her lips curving into a composed smile.

She arched a delicate brow, feigning confusion. "A special mark? I wasn’t aware of anything like that. What exactly did you see?" Her tone was steady, but her pulse betrayed her.

Alexander’s dark eyes held hers, a faint smirk playing on his lips. "A pale pink butterfly. On the small of your back."

His voice was low, rough with the lazy warmth of early morning.

"Must be a birthmark."

Relief washed over Evelyn at his words. She exhaled softly, her smile turning wry.

"It is."

"A rather unique one."

"And yet, uniqueness didn’t stop my birth parents from abandoning me." She lowered her gaze, focusing on her breakfast.

Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, casting fractured patterns across her refined features. Her lashes fluttered like delicate wings, but beneath their shadow, a quiet sorrow lingered in her eyes.

For reasons he couldn’t explain, Alexander’s chest tightened at the sight of her subdued expression.

His amusement faded, replaced by something heavier. "You once mentioned your parents lost you through negligence and took in an imposter instead. Have you ever tried finding them?"

"I did," Evelyn replied without looking up. "But they prefer the fraud now. As for me—"

A bitter laugh escaped her. "They can’t even stand the sight of me, much less claim me as theirs."

Silence stretched between them.

After breakfast, Alexander escorted her back to her apartment.

Sebastian had waited all night. Seeing her return unharmed, the tension in his shoulders eased.

Evelyn didn’t mention the drugging incident, not wanting to worry him. But Sebastian noticed immediately—her outfit wasn’t the one she’d left in.

"Did you stay with him all night?" he asked cautiously.

She brushed it off. "Just to spite Victoria."

"You slept in his room? Did you two—"

"No." Her voice turned icy. "I’ll never let him touch me again. How could I still hope for anything from the man who sent me to hell?"

Her dimples appeared, but her smile was sharp with mockery.

"Sebastian, don’t worry. I know what I’m doing."

"Good." His worry softened into quiet affection. He took her hand gently. "Even if it’s pretend, seeing you with him unsettles me."

Though his words were vague, she understood.

"From the moment I saw Alexander shove you out of that car, leaving you in the rain, I swore I’d protect you."

His voice was tender. "Women are treasures, Evelyn. Especially one as extraordinary as you."

His warmth enveloped her like a healing balm, soothing the fractures in her soul.

She met his gaze, conflicted. Words tangled in her throat.

Sebastian only smiled, brushing his fingers through her hair.

"Henry Blackwood’s eightieth birthday is on the tenth. If Alexander has any real interest in you, we’ll see it then."

Evelyn’s mind whirred.

This was the perfect opportunity.

Perhaps it was time.

The events of last night still haunted her.

Thankfully, Alexander had only seen the butterfly birthmark. If he’d glimpsed her chest—

Her identity would’ve been exposed.
###Chapter 318

Victoria Lancaster had hired private investigators to monitor Alexander Blackwood's villa all night.

The moment she learned Evelyn Sinclair had spent the entire night in Alexander's bedroom, her blood boiled with fury.

She had gone to such lengths to eliminate Evelyn three years ago—only for a near-perfect doppelgänger to appear out of nowhere.

And worse, this woman was far more cunning than Evelyn had ever been.

Victoria stood before her vanity, glaring at the unhealed scar marring her cheek.

The sight of it only deepened her resentment.

She had exhausted every trick in the book, yet Alexander only grew more distant.

She knew her only hope was to cling to the "Little Lillian" act—the one thing that still tied him to her.

First, she needed to fix this scar.

As she brooded, an irritating itch flared on the small of her back.

She scratched absently, but the sensation worsened.

Frowning, she twisted to examine the spot in the mirror—a patch of inflamed red skin.

To impersonate Evelyn and pass as the Montgomery heiress, she had gotten a fake butterfly birthmark tattooed there.

But in her haste, she had chosen a cheap parlor.

Now, three years later, the ink had faded, and the tattoo had triggered an allergic reaction.

Victoria clawed at it furiously, her frustration mounting—

Until the sound of the door opening startled her.

"Victoria? Are you in there?" Eleanor Kingsley's voice drifted closer.

Victoria yanked her dress down and stepped out, forcing a composed expression.

"Mother," she murmured, though her eyes betrayed her distress.

Eleanor sighed, patting her shoulder. "Darling, don't dwell on unpleasant things. None of this is your fault."

Victoria bit her lip, feigning heartbreak. "Vivian Prescott sent those thugs to humiliate me, and Alexander won’t even punish her! How could he protect her like this? It’s unbearable!"

"I won’t let this go," Eleanor vowed. "Alexander is just confused. The manager at D.W. just called—he personally ordered an evening gown. In your size!"

Victoria's eyes widened. "For me?"

Eleanor beamed. "Old Master Blackwood’s 80th birthday is on the 10th. He must be planning to take you as his date!"

"Really?" Victoria gasped, her earlier rage dissolving into giddy anticipation.

Eleanor nodded. "Of course! You’ve been together for years, given him a son. He’s just throwing a tantrum—but you’ve always been the one he loves most."

Victoria’s confidence surged.

It made perfect sense.

"Focus on healing," Eleanor urged. "Everything else will fall into place."

Victoria nodded eagerly, her mind already spinning with visions of herself in that gown, radiant on Alexander’s arm, the envy of every guest.

She wouldn’t waste this chance—she’d announce their engagement publicly.

Her mood lifted, Victoria rushed to the salon the moment her scar scabbed over.

After laser treatments and layers of foundation, the mark vanished.

The day before the birthday gala, D.W.’s assistant confirmed Alexander had collected the gown himself.

The photo they sent made her breath catch—the design was exquisite, tailored to perfection.

She ached to wear it immediately.

But as night fell, Alexander never called.

She dialed his number repeatedly—no answer.

Frantic, she stormed to his villa, but he wasn’t there.

Her investigators came up empty.

By dawn, dark circles shadowed her heavily made-up eyes as she arrived at Blackwood Estate with Eleanor.

Guests milled about, laughter filling the gardens.

Victoria scanned the crowd—no sign of Alexander.

When Margaret Blackwood appeared, Victoria rushed over.

Margaret looked puzzled. "Alexander called this morning. He said he’s bringing someone special to meet us. I assumed he meant you—but if not you, then who?"

Eleanor frowned.

Victoria’s stomach dropped.

A terrible premonition slithered through her.

Then—commotion at the gates.

Her head snapped up.

And what she saw shattered her.

Rage exploded in her chest, choking her.
###Chapter 319

Alexander stood tall in his impeccably tailored Armani suit, the midnight blue fabric accentuating his broad shoulders and lean frame.

His golden complexion glowed under the garden lights, every movement exuding aristocratic grace.

This was the Alexander that Victoria had desperately wanted to claim when she first laid eyes on him.

For years, she had schemed and manipulated to keep him by her side.

Yet now, this perfect man was holding hands with another woman.

Victoria's blood boiled as she glared at Vivian walking beside Alexander. The worst part? She had mistaken Vivian's stunning emerald gown as her own—only to realize Alexander had commissioned it specifically for Vivian.

All her anticipation had been for nothing.

Reality had slapped her hard across the face.

Alexander naturally commanded attention wherever he went. The garden guests immediately noticed his arrival—and the elegant woman on his arm.

Vivian wasn't conventionally beautiful, yet something about her captivated every gaze.

The dress was exquisite, but it merely served to highlight Vivian's natural elegance.

Her posture was regal, her skin like polished porcelain leaving a faint trace of jasmine in her wake.

Her smile was effortless yet utterly mesmerizing.

Murmurs spread through the crowd. "Isn't that Vivian Prescott?"

"The founder and creative director of Lady Belle."

"She was the star of Lady Belle's anniversary gala last month."

"She looks strikingly similar to Mr. Blackwood's ex-wife. How did they become involved?"

"I heard Alexander's been visiting Diamond Boulevard frequently to see her. Their relationship must be serious."

"Rumor has it Victoria was assaulted last month. Maybe that's why Alexander left her for Vivian—"

A sharp gasp cut through the gossip.

Victoria's nails dug into her palms as the whispers stabbed at her back.

She was seconds from exploding, but the social setting forced her to maintain composure.

Eleanor, however, had no such restraint. She stormed forward. "Vivian Prescott."

Vivian paused, meeting Eleanor's furious gaze with polite curiosity. "Mrs. Kingsley, can I help you?"

"I'm perfectly fine," Eleanor sneered. "But you won't be!"

Her hand flew out—

Crack!

The slap sent Vivian's face snapping to the side. She blinked, momentarily dazed.

The sting on her cheek was nothing compared to the ache in her chest. She hadn't expected her own mother to strike her.

Victoria smirked in satisfaction.

Alexander's eyes darkened dangerously. "Have you lost your mind? How dare you lay hands on my companion?"

"Companion?" Eleanor scoffed. "Alexander, I won't humiliate Victoria publicly, but this homewrecker needs to be dealt with!"

She raised her hand again—

Alexander moved like lightning, pulling Vivian protectively against him while catching Eleanor's wrist mid-swing.

"Try that again," he growled, shoving her back with enough force to make her stumble.

Victoria rushed to steady her mother. "Mom! Are you alright?" Tears welled in her eyes as she whispered, "Please, just let it go. If Alexander wants to be with Vivian, then so be it. I've already suffered enough—I can't bear to see you hurt too."
###Chapter 320

Eleanor had always been willing to sacrifice everything for her daughter, but hearing Victoria's words twisted her heart with fresh anguish.

"Victoria, my darling, don't distress yourself." Eleanor's voice trembled with maternal fury. "I won't let anyone humiliate you like this! Let all of Willowbrook see Alexander Blackwood for what he truly is - the wealthiest man in town with the coldest heart. And this Vivian Prescott? Nothing but a scheming harlot!"

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

The revelation painted Vivian as the homewrecker who'd stolen Alexander from poor Victoria.

"Mother, please stop!" Victoria's tears fell like diamonds on her flushed cheeks. "This is all my fault. Alexander and Miss Vivian are innocent. Let's just leave!" Her fragile demeanor sparked immediate sympathy.

Murmurs of disapproval spread like wildfire. To the uninformed guests, Vivian appeared every bit the villainous other woman.

Alexander felt the shifting atmosphere. His protective instincts flared as he turned to Vivian. "Are you alright?" His fingers brushed her cheek with featherlight concern.

Vivian's lips curved into an unshaken smile. "A few petty insults won't break me." Her composed gaze swept across the hostile crowd before settling on Eleanor and Victoria. "Mrs. Kingsley, words and actions carry consequences. You've struck me and slandered me publicly. Don't I deserve an explanation?"

Her voice dropped to a dangerous purr. "Being falsely accused is my greatest pet peeve."

"Falsely accused?" Eleanor scoffed. "You're exactly what I called you - a conniving, heartless witch!"

"Mother, please!" Victoria clung to Eleanor, her body wracked with theatrical sobs. "We can't challenge them. I can't endure another scandal. Just remembering how they all turned against me..." She trailed off, secretly delighting in the growing outrage.

Eleanor embraced her daughter tighter, shooting daggers at Vivian. The crowd's murmurs grew venomous.

"Those rumors about Victoria being assaulted must be true after all."
"Did Vivian orchestrate the whole thing?"
"Beautiful face, black heart. How revolting."
"To think Alexander would abandon Victoria for such a creature."

Victoria hid her smirk in Eleanor's shoulder. Today would be Vivian's public undoing. Revenge tasted sweeter than she'd imagined.

Then the temperature seemed to drop.

"I warned you never to mention that incident again." Alexander's voice cut through the chatter like an arctic wind.

Victoria's blood ran cold.

"Alexander! How dare you threaten Victoria?" Eleanor shrieked. "After everything she's suffered because of that witch? You should be demanding justice, not protecting her perpetrator!"

Alexander's expression darkened. "Vivian had nothing to do with that night. Drop these baseless accusations." His glacial stare pinned Victoria in place. "This ends now."

"The hell it does!" Eleanor spat. "I'm calling the police! Vivian will pay for what she's done!"

"Actually," Vivian's voice sliced through the tension, "I can't allow this charade to continue." She met Alexander's worried gaze. "I won't let Victoria manipulate everyone - or tarnish your reputation any longer. The truth needs to come out tonight."
###Chapter 321

As Evelyn's voice trailed off, an eerie silence descended upon the gathered crowd.

The truth about this incident?

Wasn't what had just been revealed the actual truth?

Confused murmurs rippled through the guests as they exchanged bewildered glances.

Victoria knew exactly what she had done, and when Evelyn dropped this bombshell, cold sweat trickled down her back.

She was scrambling for a counterattack when Eleanor stepped forward like a protective lioness.

"Vivian Prescott, you vile creature!" Eleanor's voice shook with barely contained fury. "How dare you attempt to destroy my daughter's reputation!"

Her manicured finger jabbed accusingly at Evelyn.

"You paid those thugs to abduct Victoria and subjected her to unspeakable horrors. Then you plastered it all over social media to humiliate her further! I won't let this stand!"

"Mother..." Victoria clung to Eleanor's arm, tears streaming down her porcelain cheeks. "Please, let it go. I don't want Alexander to be upset..."

"Alexander, do you hear this?" Eleanor embraced her trembling daughter while shooting daggers at Evelyn and Alexander. "Even now, Victoria still cares about your feelings, while you! You've let this witch torment her without showing an ounce of concern!"

"Alexander," Margaret Blackwood interjected sternly. "The family is right. Regardless of circumstances, you can't ignore Victoria. This matter must be thoroughly investigated!"

Victoria's sobs grew more theatrical. "Mrs. Blackwood, Mother, your support means everything. Though I'm the victim here, I truly don't wish to pursue this."

She swallowed dramatically before turning tear-filled eyes toward Evelyn.

"Miss Prescott, this is all my fault. I made you unhappy. What happened was just... bad luck. I won't press charges, so please don't anger my mother any further."

Her gaze then shifted to Alexander, brimming with manufactured vulnerability. "Alexander, it's all my mistake. Please don't be angry with me. I promise I'll never mention it again."

The performance was Oscar-worthy. Had Evelyn not known Victoria's true nature, she might have been fooled like everyone else.

"Victoria, why are you apologizing when you're the wronged party?" Eleanor protested vehemently. "They're the ones who should be begging for forgiveness!"

Clap. Clap. Clap.

Evelyn slowly applauded, the sharp sound cutting through the tension.

The crowd glared at her with righteous indignation, but Evelyn merely smiled, unfazed.

"Miss Lancaster's acting remains impeccable. Truly breathtaking."

Her chuckle held no warmth as she locked eyes with her nemesis.

"Victim? You're the mastermind behind everything."

"Vivian Prescott!" Eleanor's voice turned dangerous. "You dare spin lies with so many witnesses present?"

Meeting Eleanor's venomous gaze, Evelyn suppressed her rage and smirked.

"Mrs. Kingsley, the one twisting facts is your precious daughter."

"You—"

"Let me make this crystal clear - if Alexander hadn't begged me to drop the kidnapping investigation, your darling girl would be rotting in prison right now."

Eleanor gaped like a fish out of water. "You... You're the criminal accusing the innocent!"

"Mother, I didn't! She's framing me!" Victoria shook her head frantically, eyes wide with feigned innocence. "Alexander, you know I could never do such terrible things!"

Her pitiful gaze swept across the assembled guests, searching for sympathy.
###Chapter 322

"I'm sure everyone heard about my kidnapping incident recently."

Victoria Lancaster's voice trembled as she pointed an accusing finger at Vivian Prescott. "Yes, I was abducted and violated by several men. And the mastermind behind this horrific act is standing right here - Miss Vivian Prescott!"

Her lips quivered dramatically. "I wanted to let this go initially, but she's now twisting the narrative and slandering me publicly. I can't tolerate this anymore!"

The crowd gasped collectively.

"Vivian Prescott, I'm exposing your crimes today!"

As her declaration echoed through the hall, the guests immediately rallied behind Victoria.

"Miss Lancaster, we stand with you!"

"How despicable, Vivian Prescott!"

"Don't worry Victoria, we'll all support your accusations against this vile woman!"

"With such immoral character, Lady Belle Jewelry deserves to go bankrupt! No one will patronize your store again!"

A thunderous voice cut through the accusations like a blade. "Enough!"

All eyes turned to Alexander Blackwood, whose glacial gaze swept across the room before settling on Victoria's tear-streaked face.

Victoria's breath hitched as her pulse raced erratically.

"Why must you humiliate yourself repeatedly?" Alexander's voice dripped with disdain. "I warned you not to reopen these wounds, yet here you are, parading your fabricated victimhood."

"Alexander, I had no choice!" Victoria protested with theatrical distress. "I can't let my tormentor walk free. But fine, I'll drop it. I won't speak of this again."

Her performance was flawless, though internally she prayed no one would actually investigate - the truth would destroy her.

"We absolutely must investigate this thoroughly!" Eleanor Kingsley declared vehemently.

Alexander's mocking laugh sent chills down Victoria's spine. His piercing stare made her squirm as she desperately tugged her mother's arm. "Mother, please, let it go—"

"Do you really think that's possible now?" Alexander interrupted coldly. His contemptuous once-over left Victoria trembling.

"I never intended to air this publicly," he stated, his protective arm encircling Vivian. "I don't care about outsiders' opinions of me. But no one," his glare shifted to Victoria, "absolutely no one gets to slander the woman I love."

Victoria paled dramatically. "Alexander—"

"The police completed their investigation this morning. All four perpetrators confessed - you hired them to kidnap Vivian. When you refused payment, they turned on you instead."

The color drained from Victoria's face. She hadn't anticipated Alexander uncovering everything.

Eleanor shook her head violently. "Impossible! My daughter is the victim here!"

"She's the perpetrator," Alexander stated unequivocally. "Vivian is the true victim. I persuaded her to drop the matter to spare your family's reputation."

Eleanor stood speechless. "This...this can't be...why would Victoria...?"

"Mother, believe me! I would never!" Victoria flailed desperately. "Alexander, you've been deceived! Vivian must have bribed those men! If I were guilty, the police would have arrested me already—there's no evidence!"

"You want evidence?" Alexander's smile turned predatory. "The evidence is right here."
###Chapter 323

Evelyn spoke with deliberate calm as she retrieved her phone, displaying a series of digits on the glowing screen.

All eyes turned toward the device. Victoria froze when the numbers came into view.

At first, she didn't comprehend. But after several heartbeats, her complexion turned ashen, pupils dilating with panic.

Watching her reaction, Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile.

"Miss Lancaster, cat got your tongue? This number looks familiar, doesn't it? Of course it does - it belongs to your adoptive mother, Margaret Dawson."

Evelyn moved with effortless grace toward Victoria, her regal bearing instantly diminishing the other woman's presence.

"You're clever, I'll give you that. Using your mother's phone to contact those thugs was smart - it created plausible deniability. But phone records don't lie. Even deleted calls can be retrieved from the carrier."

She paused dramatically. "Oh, and those criminals? They record all their transactions. Shall I play the audio for our audience?"

Victoria's eyes widened impossibly further, her pallor turning ghostly.

The guests who'd moments ago pledged support now glared at her with open hostility.

The tables had turned spectacularly.

Their earlier defense of Victoria now tasted like ashes. They'd nearly condemned an innocent woman.

Evelyn surveyed the scene with quiet satisfaction. "Still claiming victimhood, Victoria?"

Silence.

"Alexander was willing to sacrifice me - his friend - to protect you. But you couldn't leave well enough alone. You and your precious mother had to stage this public spectacle. Happy with the results?"

Her gaze swept over Eleanor and Margaret Blackwood's stunned expressions.

"Mrs. Kingsley, Mrs. Blackwood - shall we continue this investigation? Call the police perhaps? Or would you prefer I do it?"

Victoria never anticipated this outcome.

Her lips pressed into a bloodless line as she glared daggers at Evelyn.

Surrounded by accusing stares, panic clawed at her throat with no escape in sight.

"Mr. Blackwood, Miss Prescott, please! Victoria's innocent!"

Margaret emerged from the crowd unexpectedly.

Tears streamed down her face as she threw herself at Evelyn's feet, clutching desperately at the delicate fabric of her gown.

"I did it all! Every bit of it! Victoria knew nothing!"

The older woman's grip tightened, pulling the one-shoulder dress dangerously low.

Evelyn instinctively covered herself with her clutch. "Release me."

But Margaret only wailed louder. "Punish me instead! I hired those men! Victoria tried stopping me - that's why she went to Riverside! Blame me! Only me!"

With a violent tug, the fabric tore.

Alexander moved like lightning, draping his jacket over Evelyn's shoulders before anyone could blink.

His icy glare could have frozen hell. "I believe she asked you to let go. Get. Out."

A sharp kick dislodged Margaret's grasp. Then, before the stunned assembly, he swept Evelyn into a protective embrace.

Victoria watched, disbelief etching lines across her face. This tenderness from Alexander - directed at Vivian? Impossible.
###Chapter 324

Alexander had never lost his composure in public before, but today, he shattered that perfect image—all for Vivian.

His usual regal demeanor cracked like thin ice under pressure.

"Alexander, you heard what Margaret said. Victoria is the victim here. She's innocent!" Eleanor insisted sharply, her voice trembling with conviction. She would rather trust Margaret's explanation than acknowledge Victoria's deceit.

"Aren't you going to release that woman? Where does Victoria fit into this?"

Of course, Alexander wouldn’t let Evelyn go. Instead, he pulled her closer, his grip tightening possessively. His gaze softened as it lingered on her face.

"I will never let this woman go. As for your daughter, our engagement is over. Don’t make me repeat myself."

His tone was calm, almost indifferent, as if discussing the weather. Without another word, he swept Evelyn into his arms and strode into the house, leaving Eleanor standing there, her fists clenched in fury.

The scene was humiliating—for Victoria, for Eleanor, for everyone who witnessed it.

Alexander had publicly renounced his engagement, declaring his devotion to Vivian in front of everyone.

It was unforgivable.

Inside, Alexander carried Evelyn straight to his room. Though he rarely stayed here, the space was immaculate, the air scented with a familiar fragrance—an aromatherapy blend Evelyn had once crafted to soothe sleepless nights.

Old Mr. Blackwood had ordered it for Alexander years ago.

Evelyn slipped into the bathroom to change back into her dress. When she emerged, she found Alexander standing by the window, bathed in golden autumn light.

The crisp white shirt he wore accentuated his broad shoulders, and for a fleeting moment, she was transported back to their college days—when he had been just a boy with a quiet smile.

But that boy was long gone.

"Do you blame me for what happened?" she asked softly, stepping closer.

Alexander turned, his piercing eyes softened by the sunlight. "Perhaps I should never have let you suffer in the first place. Then none of this would have happened."

Evelyn smiled faintly. "Are you saying you feel guilty?"

His gaze darkened. "Didn’t you feel sorry for me too?"

His voice was low, intimate, sending a shiver down her spine.

She met his eyes, her own shimmering with unspoken emotions.

Alexander reached out, his fingers brushing the delicate curve of her brow.

The woman before him was Vivian, but in his heart, she would always be Evelyn.

"I made my stance clear earlier," he murmured. "Do you have anything to say to me now?"

Evelyn tilted her head, her lips curving. "Do you really want to marry me?"

His breath hitched. "Are you willing now?"

She shook her head slowly. "I won’t marry a man who doesn’t love me."

The warmth in his expression vanished. "Then will you still marry Sebastian?"

A playful glint lit her eyes. "Did you forget the good news I wanted to share? My engagement to Sebastian has been called off."

Alexander’s brows furrowed. "If you won’t marry him, and you won’t marry me—what exactly are you planning?"

Evelyn’s smile deepened. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught a shadow lingering in the courtyard.

She reached up, fingers curling around the loose silk of his tie. Her voice was light, teasing. "I was just thinking—maybe it’s fate that I look exactly like Evelyn. Maybe that’s why I fell for the same man she did."

Her words settled over him like a whisper, soft and warm.

Alexander’s pulse quickened. He searched her eyes, so clear and bright, and for the first time in years, hope flickered in his chest.

"Vivian," he murmured, his voice rough. "Are you really in love with me?"
###Chapter 325

Evelyn's lips curved into a knowing smile, her enchanting dimples appearing like delicate crescent moons.

"Don't you want me to fall for you?" She tugged playfully at Alexander's silk tie, her eyes shimmering with feigned hurt. "The truth is, you're still in love with Victoria, aren't you?" Her fingers lingered on the expensive fabric before releasing it with dramatic flair. "If that's the case, I should leave now and spare us both the heartache."

She turned away, letting her shoulders slump in perfect imitation of dejection.

The moment his tie loosened, Alexander felt an inexplicable chill seep into his chest. Watching her retreating figure, something sharp twisted in his gut - an unfamiliar sensation he couldn't name.

"Stay."

His hand shot out, capturing Evelyn's wrist with surprising urgency.

Evelyn froze mid-step. Hidden from Alexander's view, a victorious smirk bloomed across her face. But her triumph lasted mere seconds before strong arms yanked her backward.

She collided with Alexander's broad chest, his signature sandalwood cologne enveloping her senses. Once, this scent had been her comfort, something she'd longed to breathe in every night. But years of waiting had turned that longing to stone, sinking deep into the abyss of her broken heart.

A bitter laugh threatened to escape her lips as she tilted her head upward.

Their eyes met unexpectedly. Alexander's gaze held an intensity that made her pulse stutter - dark, fathomless, and utterly unreadable. This tender look from a man known for his icy demeanor left her momentarily dizzy.

Then movement caught her eye. A shadowy figure lurked near the staircase, watching them intently.

Victoria. It had to be.

Only that snake would skulk about like this.

Evelyn felt cool fingers brush her cheek. Before she could react, Alexander's face descended toward hers. His lips captured hers in a searing kiss that stole her breath.

Her fists clenched at her sides, nails biting into her palms. Every instinct screamed to push him away, but the knowledge of Victoria's prying eyes kept her compliant.

Last time, he'd claimed drunkenness. But now? Stone sober and kissing her with startling passion.

This wasn't the Alexander she knew.

The man who'd once taken her to bed with clinical detachment, using her body as an outlet for frustration rather than affection.

Yet here he was, kissing her - kissing a woman who wore his ex-wife's face.

The irony wasn't lost on her.

But perhaps this proved her plan was working. Alexander was developing genuine feelings. Men like him didn't kiss women they didn't want.

Meanwhile, Henry Blackwood's eightieth birthday celebration lay in ruins.

Guests departed in hushed whispers, though the scandalous events would undoubtedly fuel society gossip for weeks. While Margaret Dawson's last-minute appearance had technically cleared Victoria's name, no one truly bought the convenient explanation.

In the grand parlor, the elderly patriarch leaned heavily on his cane, regarding the still-sniffling Victoria with open disdain.

"Hmph," he grumbled loud enough for all to hear. "About time my grandson saw through this viper's charade."

Victoria flinched as if struck. The insult hung in the air - everyone knew exactly what Henry meant. Her teeth ground together behind her perfect smile, even as she maintained her facade of wounded innocence.
###Chapter 326

"Grandfather Blackwood, I know you have misconceptions about me, but—"

"Spare me your explanations. You know exactly what you've done."

Victoria Lancaster stood frozen, words failing her.

Suddenly, Margaret Dawson dropped to her knees with a thud. "Mr. Blackwood, this was entirely my doing. Victoria knew nothing about it until the last moment when she rushed to stop me."

Tears streamed down Margaret's face as she confessed. "That's why Victoria got injured. It's all my fault. I'm the one who caused this mess."

She slapped her own cheeks twice in dramatic remorse. "If you need someone to blame, blame me. Send me to prison if you must, but Victoria is innocent. She's suffered enough already. Alexander shouldn't break her heart again."

Eleanor Kingsley immediately pointed at Vivian Prescott. "Actually, this is all her fault!"

Just then, two figures appeared at the top of the grand staircase. Vivian's melodic voice floated down. "Mrs. Kingsley, what a devoted mother you are. With all evidence laid bare, you still defend your two-faced daughter."

Eleanor's face twisted in rage when she saw Vivian descending arm-in-arm with Alexander. "Vivian Prescott! If you hadn't stolen Victoria's fiancé, her adoptive mother would never have resorted to such measures! You're the despicable one here!"

"Despicable?" Vivian chuckled, stepping closer. "I find you rather pitiful, actually."

"Pitiful?" Eleanor's eyes bulged, her aristocratic composure crumbling.

"Vivian, whatever grudge you hold, take it out on me. Leave my mother alone." Victoria moved protectively in front of Eleanor, playing the dutiful daughter perfectly.

She turned pleading eyes to Alexander. "Alexander, I know you won't believe me no matter what I say. So let's pretend it was all my doing. Please don't punish my mother—she only acted out of love for me."

As Victoria begged for mercy, Margaret dramatically slapped herself again. "Victoria, I've failed you! Alexander, you must believe her. She's been kind-hearted since childhood—"

"Enough." Alexander's cold voice cut through the room. His icy gaze settled on Victoria. "I warned you not to push this matter. You've brought this upon yourself. Don't beg me—beg Vivian. Whether we pursue this legally depends entirely on her."

Victoria's face froze, her eyes burning with resentment. Margaret paled—beg Vivian? The thought revolted her. But jail terrified her more.

Then, to everyone's shock, Victoria knelt before Vivian.

"Victoria!" both women cried, rushing to pull her up, but she stubbornly remained.

Even Alexander looked surprised.

"Miss Lancaster, what's this?" Vivian feigned confusion. "Are you... begging me?"

Victoria lifted her tear-streaked face. "Yes. Miss Prescott, I beg you—don't press charges against my mother. She only acted for my sake. If you need vengeance, take it out on me alone. I'll accept full responsibility."

"How touching." Vivian sighed dramatically. "Miss Lancaster, such filial devotion. Even after your mother arranged for you to be humiliated by those men, you still kneel to beg for her. I'm genuinely moved."

Hope flickered across Victoria's face. Surely everyone would admire her sacrifice now. Not only might Margaret avoid jail, but her reputation would soar.

"Does this mean you'll drop the charges, Miss Prescott?" Victoria asked eagerly.

Vivian smiled deeply. "Since you're so noble, Miss Lancaster, I'll grant your wish. I won't pursue your mother... but you'll bear the full consequences yourself!"
###Chapter 327

Victoria's smile froze at Evelyn's words. Her face went completely rigid.

What?

Had she heard correctly? What was Vivian saying?

She had only been putting on an act—playing the loving, righteous role in front of Alexander and Old Master Blackwood. She never intended to actually take the blame for Margaret!

This was just a performance!

Margaret and Eleanor were equally stunned. They hadn't expected Vivian to be this ruthless.

Seeing Victoria's shocked expression, Evelyn turned to Alexander with a leisurely smile. "Alexander, in that case, you can accompany me to the police station now."

Alexander glanced at Victoria, still kneeling on the floor, his expression complicated. Then he nodded. "Alright. I'll go with you."

Evelyn's smile widened as she slipped her hand into the crook of his arm. Her arrogant, beautiful gaze swept over Victoria, still kneeling at her feet.

"Kidnapping for ransom, attempted murder… Those charges should land someone in prison for years, don’t you think? Miss Lancaster, you’ve never been to jail before, have you? Well, now’s your chance to experience the darkness inside. I’ve heard newcomers often get… special treatment. How terrifying."

Victoria paled.

Alexander immediately thought of Evelyn.

She had endured endless suffering in that cold, dark place.

The scars on her body still haunted him—vivid, painful reminders of what she had survived.

"Vivian Prescott."

Before Evelyn and Alexander could take more than a few steps, Eleanor’s voice rang out behind them.

Evelyn slowed, her heart clenching involuntarily.

Eleanor approached, her usually graceful face twisted with resentment.

Evelyn met her gaze calmly. "Yes, Mrs. Kingsley?"

"I’m begging you." Eleanor’s voice was soft but laced with bitter reluctance. "Miss Prescott, the Kingsleys will compensate you for everything. Just… drop this matter."

Evelyn laughed. "Are you begging me too, Mrs. Kingsley? Is she worth it?"

"She’s my only daughter. Of course she’s worth it!"

Only.

Precious daughter.

Evelyn stared into those eyes—so familiar, so much like her own.

So this is what I look like when I’m desperate.

Yet the woman before her didn’t seem to notice the resemblance at all.

When Evelyn remained silent, Eleanor seemed to reach a decision. "If an apology isn’t enough… then I’ll kneel too. Just leave my daughter alone."

She started to lower herself.

Evelyn’s expression darkened. "It won’t change anything." Her cold gaze shifted to Margaret. "She should be the one kneeling."

Margaret stiffened, then caught Victoria’s pointed look. Swallowing her pride, she rushed forward and dropped to her knees. "Miss Prescott, it was my fault! All of it! Please, forgive me! I swear I’ll never do it again!"

Her performance was exaggerated, her apology anything but sincere.

"Enough." Evelyn’s voice was icy. "I don’t want to look at any of you right now."

Margaret scrambled up, pulling Victoria with her. "Victoria, Mrs. Kingsley—let’s go."

Victoria resisted. "Alexander, can we talk?"

Alexander’s response was indifferent. "Go ahead."

"Alone?"
###Chapter 328

Evelyn released Alexander's hand with a soft smile. "I'll wait here for you."

"Alright." Alexander gave a brief nod before turning away.

Margaret and Eleanor trailed behind him as he stepped out of the estate gates.

Watching Victoria walk off with Alexander, Evelyn's lips curled into a satisfied smirk.

Victoria, what I have in store for you is far worse than this.

Don’t disappoint me by breaking too soon.

"If Evelyn had even half your boldness, that child would still be here," Henry Blackwood murmured from behind her.

Evelyn's chest tightened at the unexpected warmth in his voice—a rare glimpse of care she hadn’t felt in years.

She turned to face him, her smile gentle. "If you don’t mind, Grandfather, you can think of me as Evelyn."

Henry studied her face—so hauntingly similar—and shook his head with regret.

"No matter how alike you look, it’s just resemblance. At the end of the day, you’re not my granddaughter-in-law."

"Perhaps soon," Evelyn countered lightly. "Alexander said he wants to marry me. I’m considering it."

"What?!" Margaret Blackwood stormed down the stairs, her face twisted in outrage. "Alexander wants to marry you? Weren’t you engaged to Sebastian?"

"That engagement is over."

Margaret’s eyes bulged. "I won’t allow this! Just looking at you irritates me. You resemble that wretched Evelyn too much—you’re nothing but bad luck!"

"Enough!" Henry snapped, his voice sharp. "Evelyn was still your daughter-in-law. Even in death, she remains a Blackwood!"

His glare darkened. "And need I remind you? All the past chaos was Victoria’s doing. If you can’t see that, you’re truly blind."

Margaret clenched her jaw but didn’t dare argue further.

Henry turned back to Evelyn, his tone grave. "Miss Prescott, think carefully about who you marry. It’s not a game. Choose wrong, and you might end up like Evelyn—with no way back."

With that, he ascended the stairs, leaving Margaret seething.

She leaned in, her voice a venomous whisper. "Listen well, Vivian Prescott. I will never allow Alexander to marry you. Unless the dead rise, you’ll never set foot in this house as his wife!"

Evelyn laughed, her gaze piercing. "Then keep your eyes open. You might just witness a resurrection."

Margaret recoiled at the eerie glint in Evelyn’s eyes. Before she could retort, Evelyn had already turned away.

At the gates, Evelyn saw Victoria climb into a car, tears streaking her face as she drove off. Alexander approached, his expression cold—until his eyes landed on Evelyn.

Instantly, the ice in his features thawed.

Just seeing her face soothed him.

"Tired? I’ll take you home."

"Alright."

Evelyn didn’t ask what had transpired between him and Victoria.

She assumed he meant her apartment, but the car rolled to a stop in his villa’s garage instead.

"I won’t have you living with Sebastian anymore. From today, you stay here. With me."

Evelyn leaned against the car, eyeing the villa with feigned distaste.

"This was your home with your late wife. If you’re serious about marrying me, shouldn’t you buy a new place? I refuse to live in a house haunted by death."

At the word death, Alexander’s brows furrowed. His gaze locked onto hers, intense and unreadable.

"She’s not dead."
###Chapter 329

Evelyn's pulse skipped erratically, but she schooled her features into perfect surprise.

She lifted her gaze to meet Alexander's dark, searching eyes.

"What? You're saying your ex-wife isn't dead?"

She arched a delicate brow before letting out a soft, incredulous laugh.

"Don't tell me you're suspecting I'm Evelyn Sinclair again?"

The moment the words left her lips, Alexander chuckled too. A crisp autumn breeze swept between them, stirring the unreadable shadows in his gaze.

He studied her intently before murmuring, "Some people are alive, yet dead to the world. Others are dead, yet still very much alive."

Evelyn's lips curved into a wry smile.

"Are you trying to say your ex-wife lives on in your heart?"

Her laughter carried a sharp edge of mockery.

"Everyone knows Evelyn was the woman you despised most."

"Everyone knows?" Alexander repeated, the irony in his faint smirk darker than hers.

Yes, everyone knew.

They all knew Evelyn had loved him with reckless devotion.

But no one knew—not even himself—that he had loved her too.

By the time he realized it, it was too late.

Too late to say "I love you" back.

At Evelyn's request, Alexander escorted her back to her apartment.

Not long after, news of the scandal at Old Master Blackwood's 80th birthday banquet exploded across social media.

Netizens flooded Victoria Lancaster's accounts with vitriol.

The more relentless ones unearthed every dark secret from Victoria's past—college photos, high school yearbooks, even elementary school portraits.

Though Victoria immediately paid to suppress the leaks, screenshots had already spread like wildfire.

Blackwood Enterprises.

Alexander received the notification right after his morning meeting.

He rarely indulged in tabloid gossip, but seeing Victoria and Vivian's names in the headline, he clicked.

Photos of a younger Victoria filled the screen—some with him, but others with different men.

Two particularly damning ones showed her pressed close to Dominic Fletcher.

In one, she was kissing his cheek.

Alexander froze.

A wave of visceral disgust crashed over him, followed by a memory so sharp it stole his breath.

That stormy night. Her sitting in his car, telling him Victoria had been with Dominic—that the baby had never been his, that the miscarriage was staged.

And what had he done?

He'd wrapped his hands around her throat and snarled, "Don't you dare slander Victoria again."

He remembered how she hadn't even struggled. Just smiled through tears and whispered, "Alexander Blackwood, if I'm lying, may I die for it."

His reply had been merciless. "Then die."

Then he'd thrown her out into the downpour and driven away, leaving her to the storm.

And later—she had died.

Regret clawed up his throat.

Alexander's eyes burned, red-rimmed and raw.

The rain from that night seemed to pour inside his chest now, drowning every heartbeat.

A bitter laugh escaped him.

Evelyn and Olivia had been right.

He'd been blind.

Deaf.

A fool.
###Chapter 330

All because of a childhood vow, he shielded a woman who had long since rotted from within.

Like a lovesick fool, he carved pieces of flesh from the woman who truly held his heart.

Alexander's fingers trembled as he picked up his phone again. The screen displayed newly surfaced childhood photos of Victoria.

When they'd reunited, he'd asked to see pictures of her younger years. She'd claimed they were lost during a move.

Now internet sleuths had unearthed them anyway.

His thumb hovered over the headline.

Knock. Knock.

The office door interrupted his thoughts.

Lucas Grant stood waiting. "Come in," Alexander commanded, schooling his features into neutrality.

The phone clattered onto the desk as all traces of vulnerability vanished.

"Mr. Blackwood," Lucas reported briskly, "I've been monitoring Sebastian Whitman as instructed. While he's shown no unusual behavior, yesterday he secretly met with two senior board members from Blackwood Enterprises."

Alexander steepled his fingers. "Sebastian has always distanced himself from the family fortune and influence. Why suddenly engage with corporate leadership?"

Something nagged at him. Henry Blackwood knew Sebastian's secret—had always avoided speaking of it.

Beneath Sebastian's polished exterior churned dangerous currents.

"Here's the birth certificate for Vivian's daughter Amelia, along with hospital records. The investigation proved... difficult." Lucas extended another folder.

Alexander hesitated before accepting it.

The DNA results already confirmed the truth. This paperwork merely formalized his guilt.

"Dismissed. Continue surveillance on Sebastian."

As the door clicked shut, Alexander stared at the unopened folder.

His hands shook remembering how he'd systematically destroyed Evelyn—accelerating her physical and mental decline.

Later, he found himself in a florist, mechanically selecting ninety-nine blood-red roses.

"Fancy meeting you here."

Evelyn's voice startled him as he reached his car. He masked his anguish with practiced charm.

"Vivian? What brings you here?"

"Just passing through." Her smile dazzled as she gestured to the roses. "But you—such an extravagant bouquet. For me?"

Alexander glanced at the flowers. "I'll buy you roses if you like, but these... they're spoken for."

Her perfectly sculpted brow arched. "Not for Victoria, surely? Red roses symbolize love. You still adore her."

"Jealous?" His gaze turned piercing. "Do you know what ninety-nine red roses signify?"

Evelyn's eyes flickered over the bouquet. Ninety-nine roses—eternal devotion.

How predictable. Still pining for Victoria.

Before she could respond, Alexander opened the passenger door. "Curious about their destination? Get in."

With calculated grace, she slid inside.

Twenty minutes later, the car slowed.

Evelyn's breath caught as familiar iron gates came into view.

The cemetery.
###Chapter 331

The memory of stumbling upon Alexander purchasing an extravagant bouquet of crimson roses still haunted Evelyn. At the time, she had assumed he was seeing other women behind Victoria’s back.

She had followed him discreetly, only to watch as he carried those roses to the cemetery.

Back then, she hadn’t dared to follow further, leaving the reason behind his visit a mystery. No matter how much she had tried to uncover the truth afterward, she had found nothing.

Today wasn’t a coincidence either. She had been watching him—always watching.

When she noticed him entering the florist again, she had orchestrated this "chance" encounter.

Lost in thought, she barely registered Alexander opening the car door for her.

Evelyn blinked, snapping back to reality as she stepped out.

She feigned curiosity, glancing around before her gaze landed on the bouquet of roses now clutched in Alexander’s hands.

So, he really was visiting someone here.

"Does the person you're bringing flowers to work nearby?" she asked, tilting her head slightly.

Alexander lowered his gaze, a faint smile touching his lips. "No. She rests here."

Evelyn’s pulse stuttered.

"If you don’t mind, you can come with me," he said, turning away before she could respond.

He moved forward with practiced ease, as if he had walked this path a thousand times. His expression darkened, weighed down by memories.

He scoffed inwardly at his own foolishness—the irreversible pain he had inflicted on Evelyn.

She had loved him so deeply, so selflessly.

Her love had been like a fragile bloom in the shadows, enduring and unyielding.

And he had left it to wither in the cold.

Evelyn followed in silence, her heart pounding with each step.

Her eyes flickered toward her grandfather’s grave, the memory of that stormy day flashing through her mind—Alexander, chisel in hand, shattering the tombstone, scattering the ashes of her and their child.

His merciless eyes, his icy declaration that he would never regret it.

Her fists clenched, nails biting into her palms as fury burned through her veins.

Watching his broad back ahead of her, her fingers trembled, her vision blurring with unshed tears.

Alexander, all I ever did was love you. Why did you destroy me?

You could have hurt me, humiliated me—but why did you take our child from me?

Are you truly that heartless?

Or is Victoria the only one who matters to you? Did she strip you of your humanity?

Lost in her rage, she didn’t notice when Alexander stopped. She collided with him, stumbling back before catching herself.

When she looked up, his face was rigid, his expression twisted in something akin to horror.

Following his gaze, she saw him stride toward a particular grave—one that had been viciously desecrated.

The tomb was split open, the headstone shattered beyond recognition.

Before she could speak, Alexander flung the roses aside and dropped to his knees, frantically searching through the wreckage like a man possessed.

His panic was palpable, his movements erratic—a side of him she had never seen before.

Her chest ached as she watched him unravel.

Whoever rested here mattered deeply to him.

A woman, no doubt.

The realization twisted inside her, bitter and mocking.

She couldn’t help the hollow laugh that escaped her lips.
###Chapter 332

The truth struck like lightning—Victoria wasn't Alexander's true love.

His heart had belonged to someone else. Someone already gone.

"Are you searching for something? Need my help?" Evelyn's voice was calm, cutting through the heavy silence.

Alexander froze, as if suddenly remembering she was there.

He rose slowly, his striking features twisted with grief—raw and suffocating. But beneath it burned something darker. A feral, dangerous glint in his eyes.

Like a man terrified of losing what little he had left.

Evelyn frowned, stepping closer. "What happened?"

"I'll take you home." His voice was ice. No warmth. No emotion. Just a chilling void.

Back at the penthouse, he didn’t wait for her to enter like usual. The moment her feet touched the pavement, his car screeched away.

Evelyn watched the taillights vanish, her mind racing.

Who was buried in that grave?

Who mattered so much that its desecration nearly broke him?

Meanwhile, Alexander's car tore through Blackwood Estate's gates.

No announcement. No warning.

He stormed into the parlor like a hurricane of fury.

Victoria and Eleanor sat sipping tea, flipping through a jewelry catalog. Both startled at his sudden appearance.

"Alexander!" Victoria's face lit up, rushing to him. "You came for me?"

His gaze was arctic. "You did this."

Victoria blinked, feigning innocence. "Did what? I've been with Mother all week."

Eleanor scoffed. "Is this about Vivian again? That scheming little—"

"Silence." Alexander's lethal glare never left Victoria. "I'll ask once. Did you order the destruction at 97 Serenity Lane?"

The cemetery's address.

Victoria paled. "I don’t know what you're talking about!"

A bitter smirk curled his lips. "No confession? Fine." He turned to leave. "You have until midnight. After that? Face the consequences."

"Alexander, wait!" Victoria chased him, but he was already gone.

The grave was ruined. The urn—gone.

Even the wedding ring he'd hidden behind the tombstone had vanished.

No one hated Evelyn more than Victoria.

And now, even her ashes—his last tether to her—were stolen.

Dusk painted the villa in grays when he returned. Restless. Agonized.

The kitchen taunted him. For a second, he swore he saw Evelyn there—apron on, smiling over her shoulder. "Dinner's ready, Alexander."

Her dimples. The curve of her lips.

He reached out—

She dissolved into nothing.

Just another cruel illusion.

His vision blurred. Memories flooded back—their first meeting, her laugh, the way her eyes crinkled when she teased him.

All gone.

Then—a sound at the door.

He didn’t turn. Didn’t need to.

He’d left it open for a reason.

Victoria appeared, breathless, her resolve crumbling under his glacial stare.

She swallowed hard.

"You're right," she admitted, voice trembling. "I had her grave destroyed. That bitch Evelyn Sinclair deserved worse than death."
###Chapter 333

The moment the words left Victoria's lips, an icy wave of violence crashed over her.

Her body trembled uncontrollably.

Before she could even process what Alexander might do, his fingers closed around her throat like steel.

Air vanished from her lungs.

"Al—Alexander—!"

Her eyes widened in shock, disbelief flooding her as she stared at the man choking her.

How?

How could he do this to her?

For her—for Evelyn Sinclair!

"Do you have any idea what you've done?" His voice was a blade of frost, slicing through the space between them. "Did you think my past indulgence gave you the right to cross this line?"

Victoria clawed at his hand, her vision darkening.

She couldn't breathe.

Couldn't think.

Yet no matter how she struggled, his grip only tightened.

His eyes were black with fury, the devil himself staring back at her.

"Alexander—please—!"

He released her only when her knees buckled.

She collapsed, gasping, greedily gulping air.

It was that name—Evelyn's nickname for him—that had finally made him relent.

Of course.

Even now, it was always about Evelyn.

Tears burned in Victoria's eyes, a toxic mix of fear, jealousy, and hatred.

She hated how Evelyn had stolen Alexander's heart—then and now.

Hated that no matter what she did, Evelyn was the one he truly loved.

"Return her to me," Alexander said, his voice devoid of warmth. "And I might consider letting you walk away."

Victoria coughed, her fingers trembling as she clutched his pant leg.

"Why—why are you doing this?" Her voice cracked, tears spilling. "The woman you love has always been me!"

Alexander's expression darkened. "I won't repeat myself. What I felt for you was never love."

"It was!" she screamed, desperation clawing at her. "Alexander, we can start over! I'll do anything—just forget the past!"

Her nails dug into his arm.

"You hated Evelyn! She was nothing but a scheming, shameless woman who forced her way into your life! How can you possibly love her? It's just pity because she's dead! The one you truly love is me!"

Alexander's jaw clenched.

Every word she spat about Evelyn was gasoline on the fire of his rage.

But he held back.

Barely.

"Give me her ashes. And the ring." His voice was lethally calm. "Or you'll regret it."

Victoria's tears stopped.

Her lips curled into a bitter smile.

"So this is really how it ends?" Her voice shook. "After everything, you feel nothing for me?"

Alexander scoffed. "You're lucky you're still standing here. If not for our past, you'd already be in prison."

Victoria went still.

Numb.

Then, she laughed—a hollow, broken sound.

"Fine. I'll give Evelyn back to you." She lifted her chin. "But I have one condition."

For the briefest moment, as he looked at her, Alexander remembered the girl she used to be.

The one who had once smiled at him with innocent warmth.

Against his will, something in his chest softened.
###Chapter 334

"Go ahead."

"Honor your promise to me. Make me your wife," Victoria demanded without hesitation.

Alexander's face darkened instantly. His stormy eyes bore into hers, swirling with unreadable emotions.

"Alexander, you know how deeply I love you. I'm obsessed with you. My life means nothing without you. From the moment we first met, I knew I wanted to spend eternity with you."

Victoria gazed at him with desperate longing.

"You're my only reason to keep breathing. If I can't have you, I'd rather die. If you break your promise, I'll take Ethan with me when I go. And you'll never find Evelyn's ashes."

Alexander let out a dark chuckle. "Is this a threat?"

Victoria shook her head, her eyes glistening with tears. "I would never threaten you. I just want to be with the man I love. Even if it means becoming the villain in your story."

His expression turned glacial. "You'll get what you want."

Victoria's eyes widened in shock. "Alexander... you're really agreeing to marry me?"

He roughly pulled his hand away. "Return Evelyn's ashes before I change my mind."

Her momentary joy shattered.

She laughed bitterly, lowering her empty hands.

After all these years of waiting, he was only agreeing because of Evelyn - now reduced to mere ashes.

Victoria's laugh turned self-deprecating. "Alexander, hate me all you want. But you won't get Evelyn's ashes until after our wedding."

His piercing glare could have frozen hell itself.

She trembled under his gaze but met his eyes with tragic determination. "I love you, Alexander. Even if you already regret this decision..."

With a murderous glare, Alexander stormed out, the door slamming behind him. His imposing figure disappeared like a phantom in the night.

The tires screeched as he accelerated through the empty streets. His destination: Evelyn's old apartment.

Though her presence had long faded from the space, he still traced every inch like a pilgrim at a shrine. Maybe, just maybe, he could still catch her lingering warmth.

He flipped through Evelyn's diary, his heart clenching at the love pouring from every word. The brief joy turned to anguish as tears blurred his vision.

The city lights twinkled mockingly outside the window, their cheerfulness only making his heart grow colder.

Evelyn stood by the floor-to-ceiling windows, unable to shake the memory of Alexander's bizarre morning visit.

She hadn't investigated who lay in that grave. Nor could she decipher the meaning behind those roses.

Her phone vibrated abruptly.

Alexander's name flashed on the screen.

After a hesitant moment, she answered. Before she could speak, his drunken voice slurred, "Evelyn..."

Her grip tightened on the phone, her pulse quickening.

"Where are you? Where did she hide you..." His words slurred together.

Evelyn steadied her breathing. "Alexander, are you drunk? Where are you?"

Silence answered her.

She stared at the screen, perplexed. Was he truly intoxicated?

No.

Even drunk, he wouldn't call her name.

She didn't exist in his dreams anymore.

Ending the call, she contacted Sebastian, who was still out, to track Alexander's location.

The address that appeared moments later made her blood run cold.

That place.

It couldn't be.

She rushed out, her heart pounding. Standing before the familiar door, her hand shook as she reached for the handle. With a deep breath, she pushed it open.
###Chapter 335

The moment Evelyn pushed open the door, the pungent scent of alcohol assaulted her senses.

Three years.

It had been three long years since she last stepped foot in this place.

What shocked her even more was that everything remained unchanged—the decor, the furniture, even the faint scent of cedarwood lingering in the air.

It was as if time had frozen.

Her pulse quickened as she took slow, deliberate steps forward. The apartment wasn’t large, and within seconds, her gaze landed on him.

Alexander was slumped against the sofa, his long legs stretched out on the floor. His eyes were closed, his dark lashes casting shadows over his flushed cheeks.

His white shirt was unbuttoned at the collar, revealing the sharp line of his collarbone.

His lips, usually so composed, were slightly parted, glistening with traces of wine. Two empty bottles sat on the coffee table in front of him.

Evelyn arched a brow.

What the hell are you doing, Alexander?

Drowning your sorrows in alcohol?

She approached cautiously. "Alexander."

Her voice was soft, barely above a whisper.

His eyelids fluttered open at the sound of her voice.

For a moment, his gaze was unfocused, clouded by intoxication. Then, as if struck by lightning, his eyes cleared—sharp, intense, burning with recognition.

In one swift motion, he surged forward and yanked her into his arms.

Evelyn gasped as she collided against his chest. His body was scorching, the heat of his skin searing through the thin fabric of her dress.

She tried to pull away, but his grip only tightened, his arms like steel bands around her.

"You're back," he murmured against her ear, his voice rough with emotion. His lips brushed her skin as he spoke. "You're finally back."

His breath was warm, laced with the scent of wine.

"Don't leave me again," he pleaded, his voice breaking. "Please."

Evelyn stiffened.

He was mistaking her for someone else—Victoria, perhaps, or that woman he had been so eager to give roses to.

"I'm sorry," he whispered, his fingers tangling in her hair. "It's all my fault. Just... give me another chance. Let me love you properly this time."

His words sent an unexpected pang through her chest.

Then, just as she was about to shove him away, he spoke again.

"I love you."

Three simple words.

Three words that shattered something inside her.

Her breath hitched.

Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, but she refused to let them fall.

She remembered another time, in this very room, when he had pinned her to the floor, his voice dripping with disdain.

"Did you really think I could ever love you?"

"You were nothing more than a pawn, Evelyn. Nothing."

Her fingers curled into fists.

With a sharp push, she broke free from his embrace.

Alexander collapsed back onto the floor, his body limp with exhaustion—or perhaps surrender.

She stared down at him, her chest heaving with suppressed fury.

Then, just as she turned to leave, something caught her eye.

A small, glimmering object lay beside his outstretched hand.
###Chapter 336

Evelyn approached the open diary with hesitant steps. The pages fluttered slightly, revealing lines of youthful devotion penned in her own handwriting.

Her past affections for Alexander stared back at her in ink.

A bitter laugh escaped her lips. How naive she had been.

She snatched the diary and turned to leave, but Alexander's grip tightened around her wrist.

Evelyn lost her balance, tumbling against his broad chest.

His gaze was clouded with intoxication yet burning with intensity.

"Stay," he murmured, voice rough. "Don't walk away this time."

"You're drunk, Alexander. I'm not who you think I am." She twisted in his hold, but his arms became steel bands around her.

He only smiled, pulling her closer until their breaths mingled.

Sweat beaded on Evelyn's forehead from her futile struggles. Eventually, exhaustion claimed them both, and she succumbed to sleep in his unyielding embrace.

Dawn painted gold across the room when Alexander stirred. His fingers traced the delicate contours of Evelyn's sleeping face - the arch of her brows, the slope of her nose, the bow of her lips.

His touch lingered at the undone button of her blouse.

Evelyn awoke to his icy stare.

"My behavior last night was unacceptable," he said stiffly. "I'll assume full responsibility."

"Responsibility?" She sat up slowly. "By forcing me into marriage? I won't be shackled to a man who doesn't love me."

"What if I do?" Alexander's gaze burned into hers. "Give me time. I'll arrange everything."

The decree left no room for refusal.

Though marriage had always been her endgame, Evelyn hadn't anticipated it happening so soon.

She reported her progress to Sebastian later that day.

"Vivian, reconsider this path," he urged.

"It's the only way," Evelyn said coldly. "I'll make him pay in blood - his heart, his empire, everything."

Seeing the inferno in her eyes, Sebastian fell silent.

Her phone buzzed with breaking news alerts moments later. Verified sources confirmed it - Alexander was marrying Victoria.

The announcement struck like a physical blow.

Victoria's triumphant call came as Evelyn stared at the screen. "Three days, Vivian. That's all it takes for me to become Mrs. Blackwood."

Her mocking laughter grated against Evelyn's ears. "Did you really think resembling that dead bitch Evelyn would work? Alexander loathes the sight of you."

"We're finalizing wedding details at Blackwood Estate right now. He's letting me design everything exactly how I want. Know your place and disappear."

The line went dead.

Evelyn's grip turned the phone case white. Victoria's gloating voice echoed in her mind as she plotted her next move.

Blackwood Estate buzzed with wedding preparations when Evelyn arrived.

Alexander called as she stepped from the car. "Vivian, we need to talk. Where are you?"

"Funny," she said coolly. "I was about to say the same. Look outside."

She hung up and strode through the gates.

Inside, Victoria clung to Alexander's arm, cooing over bridal magazines. His head snapped up at Evelyn's entrance.

"Alexander?" Victoria followed his gaze, her sickly-sweet mask slipping.

Margaret and Eleanor broke off their excited chatter, faces darkening at Evelyn's presence.

"This is inappropriate," Margaret hissed.

"Get out!" Eleanor advanced like a territorial hawk.

Victoria transformed into a trembling fawn. "Miss Prescott, please respect our happiness."

Evelyn ignored them all, walking straight to Alexander with fire in her eyes.

"I'm pregnant."
###Chapter 337

"What?"

"What did you just say?"

Eleanor Kingsley and Margaret Blackwood shot to their feet, their faces twisted in shock.

"Vivian Prescott, repeat yourself!" Margaret demanded, her voice sharp.

Evelyn Sinclair studied Victoria Lancaster's reaction—her widened eyes, her slack jaw, the disbelief etched across her delicate features. Then she turned her gaze to Alexander Blackwood, whose dark, unreadable eyes gave nothing away.

"Alexander," Evelyn said softly, a small smile playing on her lips. "I'm carrying your child."

She reached into her bag and handed him a crisp medical report.

"I had the tests done this morning. The doctor confirmed it."

Alexander took the document, his expression unreadable.

Three weeks pregnant.

"Let me see that!" Margaret snatched the paper from his hands, scanning it frantically.

Eleanor leaned in, her face darkening as she read the results.

Victoria's breath hitched. Her fingers dug into the fabric of her dress as she stared at Evelyn, envy and devastation warring in her eyes.

"How…" Her voice trembled. "How is this possible?"

Eleanor crumpled the report in her fist and hurled it to the ground.

"Vivian Prescott, you scheming little—"

"Enough." Alexander's voice cut through the room like ice. His gaze, sharp as daggers, silenced Eleanor instantly. He reached for Evelyn's hand. "We're leaving."

Evelyn smirked at Victoria, whose face twisted in fury, before turning back to Alexander. "Of course."

Margaret rushed forward, blocking their path. "Alexander! Have you lost your mind? You're marrying Victoria in three days! You can't just walk out with her!"

Eleanor's face flushed with rage. "First you call off the wedding, then you agree to it again, and now you're still tangled up with this woman? What kind of game are you playing? Victoria deserves an explanation!"

"I owe you nothing," Alexander said coldly. His grip on Evelyn's hand tightened as he led her toward the door.

Eleanor sputtered, her fury rendering her speechless. "How could my daughter fall for a man like you?"

Margaret, flustered, tried to salvage the situation. "This Vivian Prescott is worse than Evelyn Sinclair ever was! Victoria, don’t worry—I’ll always stand by you."

Victoria's eyes glistened with crocodile tears. She stormed out just in time to see Alexander open the car door for Evelyn before driving away.

Her nails dug into her palms. A slow, venomous smile curled her lips.

"Vivian Prescott, you think this little stunt will stop me? Just wait. My wedding to Alexander will happen in three days."

The car ride was silent.

Alexander glanced at Evelyn through the rearview mirror. Her gaze was distant, her fingers tracing idle patterns on the window.

He pulled over abruptly, the tires crunching against gravel.

"Give me time," he said, his voice low. "I’ll make this right."

"You mean you’ll marry Victoria in three days?" Evelyn asked flatly. "Is this your idea of responsibility?"

She turned away, her agitation clear, and flung the car door open.

Alexander followed, catching her wrist. "Vivian."

She didn’t stop.

He pulled her back, forcing her to face him.

Her striking eyes met his, and for once, the ice in his gaze thawed.

"Vivian," he repeated, his voice rough with sincerity. "I want to marry you. Just give me time to fix this."

Evelyn laughed softly. "Mr. Blackwood, I don’t need your charity. If you love Victoria so much, I won’t stand in your way. The child is mine to raise."

She reached up, smoothing his collar with deliberate slowness. Then she rose onto her toes, her lips brushing his ear as she whispered,

"I hope you’re happy. Forever."

Her voice was honey-sweet, dripping with false sincerity.

Alexander’s pulse stuttered.
###Chapter 338

Alexander lifted his gaze just in time to see Evelyn flag down a taxi. Without hesitation, she slipped inside and disappeared down the street.

For a brief moment, his chest tightened. Then, he sprang into action, chasing after her.

His fingers flew across his phone screen, dialing her number. The call connected, but she didn’t answer.

Evelyn glanced at the darkened screen, a smirk playing on her lips.

This was all part of the game.

That sweet farewell she’d given him? A lie. She had no intention of letting the two people she despised most live happily ever after.

When Alexander couldn’t reach her, panic set in.

He didn’t care about the reasons—he just knew he couldn’t lose the woman who bore Evelyn’s face.

Even as he stubbornly clung to that excuse, he couldn’t ignore the way his pulse quickened around Vivian.

It was the same feeling he’d had when he first met Evelyn in college.

Back at her apartment, the doorbell rang incessantly.

Evelyn peered through the peephole.

Alexander’s striking features filled the distorted glass—still as breathtaking as ever.

The desperation in his eyes sent a thrill through her.

She didn’t open the door. Instead, she settled onto the barstool, sipping her coffee while the chime echoed through the loft.

She knew Alexander cared more about her than Victoria now.

But then why had he agreed to marry her?

There had to be a reason.

Her phone lit up again—an unknown number.

Evelyn strode to the floor-to-ceiling windows and answered.

Victoria’s icy voice slithered through the line.

"Vivian, don’t think I don’t see what you’re doing. Using your pregnancy to sabotage my wedding? Dream on."

"Alexander is taking me to my dress fitting tomorrow. A custom design worth seven figures. Everything I want, he gives me."

"Stay out of my relationship. He’s mine. Cross me, and I’ll ruin you."

Evelyn laughed, light and careless. "Oh, Victoria, I’m stepping right into your relationship. Try and stop me."

"You—!" Victoria hissed. "I won’t give you the chance!"

The line went dead.

The doorbell still rang.

After a moment’s consideration, Evelyn finally opened the door.

Alexander’s eyes brightened.

"Vivian."

"Mr. Blackwood," she said coolly, "we have nothing left to discuss." She moved to shut the door.

He caught it, his gaze burning into hers. "You once asked if you were destined to fall for the same man just because you look like her. Let me answer now—so am I."

"Because you remind me of her, I’ve fallen for you without realizing it."

But Evelyn didn’t grasp the deeper meaning.

"Alexander, I don’t understand."

"You don’t have to," he murmured. "Just know I want to marry you. Truly."

"Really?" she asked, tilting her head.

"Yes," he said firmly. Then, his brow furrowed. "But first, I have to go through with marrying Victoria."

"Why?" Confusion flickered in her wide eyes. "Why her?"

Alexander studied her for a long moment before exhaling. "You really want to know? Fine. I’ll tell you."
###Chapter 339

A sudden melancholy shadowed his gaze as he spoke.

After a brief silence, Alexander murmured, "I owe her this much."

"You owe her?"

'You owe her?'

'Alexander, you owed me too, but you conveniently forgot.'

Evelyn let out a soft laugh but didn’t press further. Instead, she tilted her head slightly, her voice smooth as silk. "Fine. If that’s how it is, I won’t make this harder for you. But if you truly mean to marry me, then prove it."

At her words, the gloom in Alexander’s expression lightened just a fraction. "Name it. Anything within my power, I’ll do."

A playful smile curled her lips. "Simple. Accompany me somewhere tomorrow. I’ll tell you where when you pick me up in the morning."

"Done," he agreed without hesitation.

For reasons he couldn’t explain, seeing that smile on her face lifted his spirits more than he expected.

When Alexander returned to Blackwood Estate, Victoria rushed to him the moment he stepped inside.

"Alexander, you’re finally back." Her face was etched with worry, her hands trembling slightly. "I was terrified you wouldn’t come home."

He sidestepped her coldly, his tone dripping with sarcasm. "Shouldn’t you be busy with wedding preparations? What are you doing here?"

"You’re my groom. Who else would I go to?" Victoria stepped closer, feigning shyness. "Alexander, I’m finally going to be your bride. I can’t believe it."

His lips curved into a hollow smile. "As long as you’re happy. Once you’ve had your fill of joy, don’t forget to return what’s mine."

Victoria’s smile stiffened, the coy act vanishing instantly. She knew exactly what he meant—Evelyn’s ashes.

He still cared so deeply for her.

Thankfully, he had no idea Evelyn was the girl he’d been searching for all these years.

If he ever found out, he’d lose himself completely to her.

Swallowing her unease, Victoria forced a fragile smile.

"Alexander, I know you’re still upset with me. It’s okay. As long as I can marry you and be your wife, I’ll endure any misunderstanding." She paused, then feigned concern. "But please, don’t let that Vivian Prescott fool you. She’s trouble—one moment entangled with your uncle, the next claiming she’s carrying your child. It’s bad enough she looks like Evelyn, but she’s just as deceitful."

"Enough," Alexander snapped, his sharp glare cutting through her. "Just because I don’t voice certain things doesn’t mean I’m blind. Don’t test my patience. It has limits."

Victoria’s breath hitched. The ice in his stare sent a chill down her spine.

'Has he seen those leaked photos of me and Dominic?'

'No. If he had, he would’ve confronted me already.'

Clutching at hope, she donned her wounded mask again.

"Alexander, I’m sorry. I won’t say anything to upset you again." Her eyes shimmered with false tears. "The bridal boutique called. We can go for our fittings tomorrow. I’ve waited so long for this."

"I’m busy," he dismissed coldly, turning toward the stairs.

Her smile cracked. "Then the day after?"

"Still busy. Try the dresses on your own."

Victoria bit her lip, watching his retreating figure. Pushing further would only backfire.

Her fists clenched, nails digging into her palms. Rage simmered beneath her skin, but she swallowed it down.

Fine. If he wouldn’t go with her, she’d make sure the world saw her as the perfect bride—with or without him.
###Chapter 340

In just three days, she would officially become his wife.

The entire city of Willowbrook - no, the entire world - would witness their extravagant wedding ceremony through live broadcast.

The thought made Victoria Lancaster's lips curve into a satisfied smile.

That evening, Victoria indulged in an extensive beauty routine. The next morning, she arrived at the prestigious bridal boutique with her head held high.

This designer brand was internationally renowned. She informed the staff about the custom gown Alexander Blackwood had commissioned. The masterpiece had arrived via private jet yesterday, valued at a staggering seven-figure sum.

Before meeting Alexander, Victoria could never have dreamed of wearing such an exquisite creation.

Now, not only was she the esteemed Miss Montgomery, but soon she would be the undisputed First Lady of the most powerful family in the country.

The anticipation made her giddy.

Having announced her plans beforehand, Victoria found the boutique swarmed with reporters eager for an exclusive.

"Miss Montgomery, how does it feel to be marrying Mr. Blackwood in two days?"

"Is it true you're trying on a million-dollar wedding gown today?"

Victoria beamed at the cameras. "Alexander personally selected this dress. Every single crystal is genuine."

"Why didn't Mr. Blackwood accompany you today?"

"You know how busy Alexander is," she replied sweetly. "Running a global empire like Blackwood Enterprises demands his full attention. I wouldn't trouble him with something as trivial as a dress fitting. A man's place is in the boardroom while a woman's is in the home."

The crowd murmured approvingly at her "understanding" nature. Victoria basked in their admiration before sweeping into the boutique with her assistant.

"Miss Montgomery, when you emerge in that dress, the paparazzi will go wild," her assistant, Claire, remarked.

Victoria's carefully cultivated gentle demeanor slipped as she smirked arrogantly. "Naturally. These commoners have never seen such luxury. They couldn't afford a single crystal on this dress even if they worked themselves to death!"

"Of course," Claire agreed dutifully.

Having worked with Victoria for months, Claire knew her true colors. The public saw a refined socialite, but behind closed doors, Victoria was petty, vindictive, and obsessed with status.

Only the exorbitant salary kept Claire from quitting.

As Victoria strutted into the boutique, the staff exchanged uneasy glances.

"Miss Lancaster... we weren't expecting you today?"

Victoria's smile vanished. "What nonsense is this? I'm here for my fitting, obviously."

"But—"

"No excuses. Where's my dress? I want to try it immediately."

At her command, the velvet curtains parted with a dramatic flourish.

Victoria and Claire gasped simultaneously as a breathtaking vision appeared.

Under the crystal chandeliers, the dazzling gown shimmered like liquid diamonds, hugging the wearer's exquisite figure.

Victoria's face contorted with rage. "Why is someone else wearing my dress? Are you all incompetent? That's my million-dollar gown! How dare you let some commoner touch it? Do you want to be unemployed?"

The staff exchanged panicked looks. "Miss Lancaster, you see—"

"And you!" Victoria shrieked at the woman. "Take that off immediately or—"

"Your dress?" came a cool, familiar voice.

Victoria froze.

Her blood ran cold as the woman turned slowly, revealing a face more beautiful than Victoria remembered.

"Vivian Prescott!"
###Chapter 341

Evelyn's lips curled into a knowing smirk. Her fingertips traced the intricate beadwork along the bodice of the dazzling gown. "Alexander has impeccable taste. He remembered every single one of my measurements."

Victoria's face contorted in disbelief. "W-What did you just say?"

"Having trouble understanding English?" Vivian arched an eyebrow, swaying gracefully toward the vanity. The boutique staff rushed to adjust the train of her dress.

She moved with regal elegance, stopping inches from Victoria's fuming face. "Do you honestly believe this dress was meant for you?"

Victoria's eyes bulged with rage. "Vivian Prescott, take that dress off immediately! Alexander commissioned this for me! I'm supposed to wear this at our wedding! Who do you think you are, wearing my wedding gown?"

Her voice rose to a shrill pitch before suddenly dropping into a mocking tone.

"Vivian, I know you're obsessed with Alexander, but he's my fiancé. Our wedding is in forty-eight hours. What you're doing right now? Textbook mistress behavior. Is this how the founder of Lady Belle conducts herself?"

The boutique staff exchanged uncomfortable glances.

Vivian merely chuckled. "If we're discussing mistresses, I could never hold a candle to you, Miss Lancaster."

Victoria's face drained of color. As she opened her mouth to retaliate, Vivian continued, "All of Willowbrook knows Alexander divorced Evelyn Sinclair three years ago. Yet you have a two-year-old son with him. Doesn't that make you the gold-standard homewrecker?"

The whispered gasps from the staff made Victoria's hands tremble violently.

"You lying bitch! Get out of my dress NOW!" Victoria shrieked, her manicured nails digging into her palms.

She whirled toward the frozen staff. "What are you idiots waiting for? Strip that dress off her! Alexander ordered this for ME!"

The manager cleared her throat awkwardly. "Miss Lancaster, actually this particular gown—"

"Useless imbeciles!" Victoria lunged forward, fingers clawing toward the delicate fabric.

Vivian caught her wrist mid-air with surprising strength. Their eyes locked—one pair blazing with fury, the other gleaming with cold amusement.

"Careful with your language, Victoria. Call me that again and I'll make sure you regret it." With a sharp twist, she sent Victoria stumbling backward.

"You—"

"Let me refresh your memory," Vivian interrupted smoothly. "Yesterday you called specifically to gloat about Alexander accompanying you for fittings. Bragged about your seven-figure wedding dress."

She adjusted a diamond-encrusted sleeve with deliberate slowness. "Yet here we are—no Alexander, no dress for you. Who's really the unworthy one here, Victoria?"

Victoria's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water. Her face turned an alarming shade of puce as she raised her hand to strike.

A glacial voice cut through the tension like an arctic wind. "Enough."

Victoria froze mid-swing, her expression morphing into pitiful vulnerability as she turned.

Alexander stood framed in the doorway, his tailored tuxedo accentuating his powerful frame. The sharp angles of his jawline seemed even more pronounced under the boutique's chandeliers.

"Alexander!" Victoria cooed, rushing to cling to his arm. "I knew you'd come! You wouldn't let me do my final fitting alone, would you?"

She shot Vivian a triumphant look. "See, Miss Prescott? My fiancé is here for me. Now will you finally remove what doesn't belong to you? For Alexander's sake, I might forgive this little stunt."
###Chapter 342

Evelyn's lips curled into a triumphant smile as she observed Victoria's smug expression falter.

"Miss Lancaster, are you hallucinating? Alexander came here for me."

Victoria's face froze, confusion flashing across her features like lightning.

Then she saw it - Vivian extending her hand toward Alexander with that infuriatingly sweet smile. The man Victoria loved walked straight past her to take Vivian's hand.

"Alexander?" Victoria's voice cracked with disbelief. An invisible weight crushed her chest, making each breath a struggle.

Evelyn reached up with feigned shyness to adjust Alexander's collar. "You look devastatingly handsome today, darling. No wonder Miss Lancaster here was willing to be your mistress."

"You lying witch!" Victoria's carefully constructed composure shattered. "You're the one who seduced my fiancé!"

Her palm flew toward Evelyn's face.

Evelyn gasped dramatically, pressing herself against Alexander's chest. Her frightened doe eyes instantly ignited Alexander's protective instincts.

He caught Victoria's wrist mid-swing, his voice glacial. "Daring to attack Vivian in front of me? How many times have you threatened her behind my back?"

Victoria recoiled as if struck. "That's not true! She's been targeting me since she arrived! First stealing you, now this dress that was rightfully mine!"

"I'm not some trophy to be won," Alexander stated coldly, wrapping an arm around Evelyn's waist. "I bought this dress for Vivian. I didn't even know you'd be here today. Stop embarrassing yourself."

Victoria's face drained of color. "You... you gave her this dress?"

The realization burned through her like wildfire. Her furious gaze locked onto Evelyn, who responded with a mocking smirk.

"Alexander, don't be upset," Evelyn purred, clinging to his arm. "We're supposed to be happy today for our engagement photos. Let's not waste time on... distractions."

Alexander's expression softened as he looked down at Evelyn. "You're right. Let's go."

They turned in unison, staff rushing to assist with Evelyn's elaborate gown.

"Miss Lancaster!" Victoria's assistant, Amelia, whispered urgently. "All the press is waiting outside for your fitting. If they see Mr. Blackwood with her instead—"

Victoria's nails dug into her palms. The scandal would ruin her. She couldn't allow it.

"Alexander!" She lunged forward, blocking their path.

Alexander's eyes turned arctic. "Don't make me have you removed."

Evelyn watched with amused anticipation, wondering what desperate move Victoria would attempt next.

Victoria's chest heaved as she glared between them. "Alexander, if you walk out that door with this woman today, you'll never find Evelyn Sinclair's remains!"

The threat hung in the air like a guillotine blade.
###Chapter 343

Evelyn's voice cut through the air like a blade, sharp and unyielding.

Both Alexander and Victoria froze mid-step at her outburst.

What had she just said?

Ashes?

My ashes?

A cold shiver raced down Victoria's spine as memories flooded back.

Three years ago, she had been blind when she attended Alexander and Evelyn's engagement party.

To sever all ties with him—to finally free herself from the chains of her obsession—she had agreed to return everything to him.

Including what was left of her.

Even though she hadn't died, the ashes remained.

But surely Alexander had destroyed them long ago?

Her thoughts shattered when she felt Alexander's grip tighten around her wrist.

His fingers were like steel, betraying the storm of emotions he was suppressing.

Evelyn rushed forward, her eyes glistening with false sorrow.

"Alexander, please don't make this harder than it has to be. Everything I'm doing is for you."

She wore the mask of a martyr, as if her actions were noble.

Victoria lifted her gaze to Alexander's face. His eyes were dark, dangerous—yet he didn't lash out at Evelyn.

A realization struck her.

She softened her expression, letting a gentle smile curve her lips. "Alexander, I'm just happy you came with me today. I don't want to cause you any trouble."

Her fingers reached up, adjusting his tie with practiced ease.

Then she met his gaze, unwavering.

"I'm glad I finally understand how you feel."

With that, she turned away, signaling for the staff to help her out of the dress.

"Vivian," Alexander called after her.

She paused, glancing back over her shoulder.

His jaw was clenched, words trapped behind his lips.

Victoria—no, Vivian—smiled.

"I'll wait for you."

Her voice was light, but as she walked away, she caught the venomous smirk Evelyn failed to hide.

She didn't react.

She simply left.

Back at home, Victoria couldn't shake Evelyn's words from her mind.

Three years ago, she had been declared dead.

Sebastian had meticulously faked the evidence.

She knew Alexander had taken her ashes from Olivia.

But what could he have possibly done with them?

He had despised her in life—hated her body, her presence.

Surely he would have destroyed what remained of her.

Yet Evelyn's words suggested otherwise.

And Alexander's reaction...

That was the most telling part.

He had been silent.

What was he hiding?

Meanwhile, Evelyn seethed.

She had successfully disrupted their wedding fitting, but she knew Alexander would be furious.

It didn't matter.

She would rather burn the world down than let Vivian Prescott have him.

The next morning, Victoria arrived at her boutique as usual.

A courier was waiting with an urgent package.

Inside was a wedding invitation.

From Evelyn.

Victoria laughed softly.

This woman never learned.

Her phone buzzed.

She already knew who it was.

Sure enough, Evelyn's voice dripped with smug satisfaction.

"Vivian, you got the invitation, didn't you? Don't be late. I'm counting on you."

Victoria's response was smooth.

"Miss Lancaster, such a gracious invitation. I do hope you won't regret it when the time comes."
###Chapter 344

"Regret? Ha! The only one who'll be drowning in regret is you, Vivian!" Victoria's mocking laughter echoed through the phone. "I warned you before - you're no match for me. So what if you're carrying Alexander's child? He won't care! I hold all the cards now. How could you possibly compete with me?"

Evelyn ended the call without response. Her slender fingers traced the embossed bride's name on the ivory invitation as her emerald eyes narrowed.

Tomorrow's wedding would have an unexpected guest.

Three torturous days passed for Victoria, though she masked her anxiety well. She'd anonymously leaked the wedding details to every major media outlet, ensuring maximum coverage. This moment had been years in the making.

The morning of the ceremony arrived with an unexpected drizzle rather than the forecasted sunshine. Victoria scowled at the raindrops streaking her penthouse windows.

"Doesn't matter," she muttered, turning to her stylist. "Make me look perfect."

The designer gown she'd coveted remained locked away - Alexander's refusal still stung. But soon, she'd have everything.

Her reflection showed a vision in white as the limousine whisked her toward destiny.

"Evelyn Sinclair, who do you think you are?" Victoria smirked at her reflection. "Alexander belongs to me."

Meanwhile, Evelyn watched raindrops race down her car window with quiet amusement. The vehicle stopped before the grand hotel where her past and future would collide.

She stepped out beneath a black umbrella, her simple navy dress accentuating natural elegance no designer gown could replicate.

The ballroom's opulence triggered memories of her own wedding to Alexander - the cold brush of his fingers sliding the ring onto hers, the traitorous hope that had fluttered in her chest.

"Alexander..." The whisper escaped before she could stop it. "Why did our love story end this way?"

A small hand tugged her sleeve. She looked down into familiar hazel eyes.

"Ethan." Her voice softened.

The boy looked heartbreakingly handsome in his miniature tuxedo, yet his expression held none of a flower boy's joy.

"Vivian, can I stay with you?" His quiet plea shattered her heart.

"Of course, sweetheart. But shouldn't you be preparing for your parents' ceremony?"

His next words struck like lightning. "I want you to be my mommy."

Evelyn's breath caught. She crouched to his level. "Do you truly wish for that, Ethan?"

His earnest nod made her smile mysteriously. "Perhaps your wish will come true sooner than you think."

"Ethan Montgomery! Get away from that woman immediately!" Eleanor Kingsley's shrill voice cut through the moment.

Evelyn straightened to face Alexander's mother, whose glare could curdle milk.

"How shameless, showing your face here," Eleanor sneered, yanking Ethan away. "Don't speak to her, darling. You'll upset your mother."

Evelyn's lips curved. "You seem overjoyed, Mrs. Kingsley. But haven't you heard? Pride comes before the fall."

"Overjoyed? Of course! My son is marrying the perfect woman today." Eleanor's smile turned venomous. "You're the mistake here, Vivian Prescott. Cause any trouble, and security will remove you."

Pain lanced through Evelyn's chest, but her voice remained steady. "Since you're so happy, let me give you a gift. Not an object, but a truth." She locked eyes with the older woman. "Victoria Lancaster isn't your real daughter. She's an imposter."

The color drained from Eleanor's face as Evelyn turned toward the ballroom, where wedding guests were beginning to arrive. The real drama was about to begin.
###Chapter 345

Evelyn didn’t hesitate to reveal the truth.

To her surprise, Eleanor didn’t react with anger. Instead, a knowing smile curved her lips.

"Vivian Prescott, I see what you're trying to do. You want to drive a wedge between me and my daughter."

She lifted her chin, confidence radiating from her. "I’m her mother. Do you really think I wouldn’t recognize my own flesh and blood? Your pathetic attempts won’t work."

With that, Eleanor gripped Ethan’s hand and turned to leave.

Evelyn’s voice carried after them, cool and deliberate. "What you believe isn’t always the truth, Mrs. Kingsley. If you don’t want to live with regret, think carefully about the woman who died three years ago. Think about the resemblance she bore to you."

Eleanor froze mid-step.

Evelyn pressed on, her words sharp. "I was there outside Victoria’s hospital room. I heard Margaret Dawson say it myself—your real daughter is dead."

"Enough!"

Eleanor whirled around, her eyes blazing with fury.

"Vivian Prescott, today is my daughter’s wedding. I won’t waste my breath cursing you. But if you dare slander Victoria again, I swear you’ll pay for it."

The warning hung in the air as Eleanor stormed off, leaving Evelyn standing alone.

A dull ache throbbed in Evelyn’s chest.

"I’m right here," she whispered to herself. "How can you not feel it? The blood we share means nothing to you?"

Her bitter smile faded as she watched Eleanor disappear into the crowd.

After a long moment, Evelyn turned away—only to collide with the very person she least wanted to see.

Victoria Lancaster stood before her, resplendent in her white wedding gown, a bouquet of roses clutched in her hands.

The moment their eyes met, Victoria’s lips curled into a triumphant smirk.

"I didn’t expect you to show up," she purred, malice lacing her voice. "Vivian Prescott, have you no shame?"

Evelyn tilted her head, her own smile slow and deliberate. "Shame requires a conscience, Victoria. Something you clearly lack."

Victoria’s expression darkened.

"Still playing the victim?" She scoffed. "Alexander and I are about to become husband and wife. The whole world will witness it. And you?"

She lifted her chin, eyes gleaming with cruel amusement.

"You’ll be nothing but a forgotten ghost."

"Do you really think marrying him will be the end?" Evelyn countered, watching as Victoria’s smirk faltered. "Remember what happened to the last woman who married Alexander. You know better than anyone how that story ended."

Victoria’s laugh was sharp. "You dare compare me to that pathetic fool? She wasn’t even fit to lick my shoes!"

Her voice dripped with venom. "Alexander despised her. She deserved to die. But me? He’s loved me for over a decade. This marriage was always meant to be."

Before Evelyn could respond, Victoria’s assistant, Amelia, rushed over.

"Miss Lancaster, Mr. Blackwood has arrived."

Victoria’s face lit up. "Perfect. Make sure everything is ready."

Amelia nodded, casting a wary glance at Evelyn before hurrying off.

Victoria turned back to Evelyn, her smile widening. "I’m about to become Alexander’s wife. You should stay and watch, Vivian. Witness the moment you lost him forever."

As she spoke, footsteps echoed behind her.

Victoria’s expression softened instantly. "Alexander," she cooed, lifting her skirts as she moved toward him.

Evelyn’s gaze lifted, meeting the piercing eyes of the man who had once been hers.

"Alexander," she murmured, her voice barely above a whisper.

A faint, bittersweet smile touched her lips as she took in the sight of him—tall, commanding, every inch the man she had loved. And lost.
###Chapter 346

Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn. Under Victoria's hopeful stare, he strode past her without hesitation, moving directly toward Evelyn instead.

Victoria stood frozen on the crimson carpet, her expression crumbling into disbelief.

"What brings you here?" Alexander approached Evelyn, his stormy eyes softening as they reflected her delicate features.

"Miss Lancaster was kind enough to invite me," Evelyn answered with a coy smile. Her fingers reached up to adjust his silk tie. "She mentioned you've been anticipating this day. That soon you'd belong to her, and I should abandon all foolish hopes and disappear. But how could I possibly let you go when my heart beats only for you?"

Victoria's face darkened like gathering storm clouds.

Seeing Alexander's icy glare, she rushed to defend herself. "Alexander, don't listen to her lies! I never said any of those things!"

"How unbecoming of you, Miss Lancaster. If you had the courage to say it, have the decency to own it."

"You—"

"Unlike you, when I say I love Alexander, I mean it with every fiber of my being. I won't surrender so easily."

Victoria's eyes widened in shock, her carefully constructed composure cracking.

Evelyn turned back to Alexander, meeting his searching gaze without flinching. Then, rising onto her toes, she pressed a featherlight kiss against his cheek.

The brief contact sent an electric current through Alexander's veins, his pulse quickening inexplicably.

"Go fulfill your promise with her. I'll be waiting." Evelyn's fingers lingered on his tie before withdrawing.

Victoria looked as though she'd been struck, her carefully manicured nails digging into her palms.

She'd never anticipated Evelyn would dare make such a bold move.

Evelyn sauntered past Victoria with effortless grace. "Why so surprised? Shouldn't you understand this best, Miss Lancaster? Didn't you insert yourself between Alexander and his ex-wife in the name of love? Didn't you hound Madeline to her death? Consider this my education in your methods."

Victoria's mouth filled with the metallic taste of rage, her throat too tight to speak.

She longed to wrap her hands around Evelyn's slender neck, but the gathered crowd and flashing cameras forced her to swallow her fury.

The ceremony must proceed.

The grand hall buzzed with elite guests and eager journalists. Evelyn took her seat in the front row, the picture of composed elegance.

Moments later, Alexander appeared at the altar, his commanding presence drawing every eye. To the world, he was perfection incarnate.

But Evelyn's heart remained untouched.

He'd shattered it beyond repair. The mere memory of loving him brought only pain.

The officiant's voice rang out, announcing the bride's entrance.

Evelyn watched as Victoria glided down the aisle on William Montgomery's arm, her smile radiant. That man—her own father—now doted on this viper in human form.

As Victoria passed, she shot Evelyn a triumphant glance that screamed, 'Vivian, Alexander Blackwood will be mine. What hope do you have against me?'

Evelyn's lips curved. She observed Victoria taking her place before Alexander, her eyes brimming with possessive adoration.

The gathered elite murmured their approval. Before the officiant could finish speaking, Victoria breathlessly uttered her "I do," then gazed expectantly at Alexander.

The officiant turned to him. "Mr. Blackwood, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, for better or worse, in sickness and in health, to love and cherish until death do you part?"
###Chapter 347

The officiant's final words hung in the air as Evelyn Sinclair felt her cheeks burn. Her longing gaze remained fixed on Alexander Blackwood.

'Alexander, say those words now!'

'This moment has been years in the making!'

Evelyn's pulse raced wildly. She could almost taste the triumph of reaching life's greatest milestone.

What made her heart flutter more was the tender smile Alexander directed at her. His usually sharp eyes held a softness she'd never witnessed before.

This victory was absolutely certain!

Then an intrusive ringtone shattered the moment.

Evelyn's irritation flared until she recognized Alexander's phone. She watched as his expression shifted while checking the caller ID, his eyes darting toward Vivian Prescott in the front row.

"Alexander," Vivian's distressed voice carried through the receiver. "Something's wrong. The baby - I need to go to the hospital immediately."

Though others couldn't hear, Evelyn caught every desperate word. Her peripheral vision caught Vivian rising to leave just as Alexander turned abruptly.

"Alexander!" Evelyn clutched his arm desperately. "The ceremony isn't finished—"

He brushed her off without hesitation.

With a deep frown, Alexander strode after Vivian's retreating figure.

"Alexander! Where are you going?" Margaret Blackwood's shocked cry echoed.

"Alexander!" Evelyn's scream tore through the venue, her fury threatening to choke her.

"What's happening?"

"Mr. Blackwood looked like he'd seen a ghost!"

Murmurs spread through the confused guests while journalists scrambled for exclusive footage.

Vivian deliberately slowed her pace, listening for familiar footsteps. The hotel entrance loomed ahead as light rain pattered against the pavement.

A chilling wind cut through her, but then sudden warmth enveloped her shoulders.

"Vivian." Alexander draped his jacket over her. "I'm taking you to the hospital."

Evelyn's delighted eyes met his. "Alexander, your concern touches me deeply." She melted into his embrace with feigned gratitude, secretly smirking.

As Alexander carried her bridal-style toward the parking lot, Vivian spotted both reporters and Evelyn giving chase. She arched a triumphant brow.

'Victoria Lancaster, know your place.'

'The game is ending in my favor.'

Vivian rested her head weakly against Alexander's chest. His familiar cologne surrounded her - the same scent from their past, yet now it stirred nothing in her hollow heart.

The viral images of Alexander abandoning his wedding to carry away a mysterious woman dominated headlines overnight. Speculation ran wild until insider sources identified her as Vivian Prescott.

Vivian's social media exploded with hateful comments orchestrated by Evelyn's paid trolls - until every trace of the scandal mysteriously vanished.

After instructing Lucas Grant to scrub the internet clean, Alexander handed Vivian a steaming mug. "You're certain you don't need medical attention?"

Vivian smiled wanly, shaking her head. "Perhaps my distress came from watching you marry another. I couldn't bear to hear you say 'I do.'"
###Chapter 348

Alexander's gaze lingered on those vibrant eyes before him, his mind drifting to distant memories.

He never truly meant to say "I do" in the first place.

When the officiant had asked, his thoughts had flashed back to his wedding with Evelyn. That was why he had smiled—why his expression had softened.

"Alexander, what's on your mind?" Evelyn's voice pulled him from his reverie.

Just then, his phone buzzed.

"I have something to handle. I'll be back soon," he said after glancing at the screen.

"Go ahead."

He nodded, but as he turned to leave, his gaze lingered on the woman propped against the headboard. There was something unreadable in his eyes.

The moment she heard the car engine roar to life, Evelyn slipped out of bed.

She hadn't expected Alexander to bring her back to his estate.

Yet, here she was. He had abandoned Victoria mid-ceremony, sweeping Evelyn away with such urgency. This outcome was better than she'd dared hope.

A slow, satisfied smile curved her lips.

Victoria must be seething right now. The thought of her twisted, furious expression was almost too delicious.

When Alexander arrived at Blackwood Estate, the air was thick with disapproval. On the other side of the room, Victoria wept uncontrollably, her eyes swollen, her breath ragged.

"Alexander, how could you?" Eleanor Kingsley's voice was sharp with accusation. "You humiliated Victoria in front of everyone! Carrying off that—that Vivian Prescott like some tragic hero. Do you have any idea what this will do to her reputation?"

"Alexander, you've gone too far. Apologize to Victoria immediately," his mother, Margaret Blackwood, urged.

"Please, don't blame him," Victoria choked out between sobs. "It's not his fault. Alexander, I just want you to be happy."

"Did you hear that?" Eleanor snapped. "After everything she's sacrificed for you, this is how you repay her? You don't deserve her!"

"If I don't deserve her, then I'll leave," Alexander replied coolly. The room fell silent, stunned.

"Alexander, what—what are you saying?" Eleanor demanded.

His gaze settled on Victoria, detached. "I gave you the wedding I promised. Consider my debt paid. But if I see a single smear campaign against Vivian, this ends now."

Victoria's eyes widened in disbelief. The man before her was a stranger—cold, indifferent.

"I have nothing more to say to any of you. Leave me alone." With that, he turned on his heel.

For a moment, Victoria stood frozen. Then, with a choked cry, she sprinted after him.

"Alexander! Wait! Please!"

She caught him just outside, her hands clutching his sleeve.

"Don't do this to me," she begged, tears streaming. "I can't lose you. I can't—"

He looked down at her, his expression unreadable. Once, her tears would have shattered him.

But not anymore.

Because now he knew the difference between guilt and true heartbreak.

The moment Evelyn had gasped for breath in his arms—that was agony. A thousand knives carving into his chest.

"Alexander, I don't care about the wedding. I just want you. Please, don't leave me!"

She clung to him, desperate.

"Don't make me do something I'll regret," he said flatly, peeling her hands away.

Victoria staggered back, her face twisting. "So that's it? You're really cutting me off?" Her voice turned eerily calm.

"Are you threatening me?"

"Would I ever?" She laughed bitterly. "I just thought you should know—Evelyn's ashes are still with me. If you walk away now, I'll destroy them."

To her shock, Alexander smirked.

"Keep them, then. But stay away from Vivian. That's my final warning."

Victoria's jaw dropped.

He didn't care?

He was willing to forsake Evelyn's remains—for her?

Impossible.
###Chapter 349

Evelyn couldn't accept this outcome. Her mind rebelled against the very idea.

No, Alexander must be playing some strategic game!

'He's pretending indifference to make me stop using Evelyn's ashes as leverage.'

The more Victoria dwelled on it, the more plausible this theory became.

Yet when she snapped back to reality, Alexander's car had already disappeared down the driveway.

Victoria's nails dug into her palms. She'd been so close to becoming Mrs. Blackwood, only to have victory snatched away. This wasn't over.

"I'll make you pay, Vivian Prescott," she hissed through clenched teeth.

Eleanor emerged from the house, concern etching lines across her forehead. The sight that greeted her froze her in place.

Her daughter stood rigid, face twisted in an expression Eleanor had never seen before - pure, unadulterated malice.

Eleanor's maternal instincts recoiled. This wasn't the gentle, compassionate Victoria she knew. The girl before her radiated venom.

Vivian's words echoed in Eleanor's mind: 'Victoria Lancaster isn't your real daughter.' Her pulse spiked, then steadied.

"Absurd," Eleanor muttered, shaking her head. "Anyone would be upset after such provocation. That Prescott woman is pure poison."

She wrapped the justification around herself like armor.

———

Alexander returned to an empty Blackwood Estate.

The master bedroom held a single clue - a handwritten note on the nightstand.

His fingers trembled slightly as he picked up the slip of paper. Elegant script danced across its surface: 'Alexander, today was perfect. I'm grateful fate brought us together.'

Simple words that struck his heart like an arrow.

Beneath, three more words completed the message: 'Missing you, Vivian.'

A rare smile touched Alexander's lips as warmth flooded his chest.

———

Evelyn was mid-sentence with Sebastian when Alexander's call interrupted.

The buzzing phone drew her gaze. Without hesitation, she silenced it.

The desperate girl who once waited by the phone was gone. In her place stood a woman who understood power dynamics.

What's easily obtained is rarely valued.

A lesson learned too late.

Three consecutive calls went unanswered. Then came the text: 'I miss you too.'

Evelyn's lips curled into a knowing smirk. The irony wasn't lost on her.

Sebastian glimpsed the message and gave a wry chuckle. "Would things have been different if he'd said that years ago?"

Evelyn's smile held centuries of sorrow. "The past doesn't deal in hypotheticals."

"Mommy! Daddy!"

Amelia's cheerful voice preceded her as she bounded into the room, clutching a colorful flyer.

Evelyn's expression softened instantly as she scooped up her daughter. "What's this, sweetheart?"

Amelia thrust the paper forward proudly. "From school! Everyone gets one!"

Evelyn scanned the announcement. "A family fun day this Saturday."

"Teacher says all mommies and daddies come!" Amelia's wide eyes held hopeful expectation.

Sebastian ruffled her hair affectionately. "We wouldn't miss it."

Amelia squealed with delight, planting a wet kiss on Evelyn's cheek before reaching for Sebastian. "Daddy hug! Kiss for daddy too!"

Sebastian's embrace was natural, his kiss-planting ceremony performed with theatrical solemnity. The love in his eyes was unmistakable.

Watching them, Evelyn felt warmth spread through her chest - followed immediately by the familiar pang of guilt. Sebastian treated Amelia as his own, and while gratitude filled her heart, so did the weight of what she could never give him in return.
###Chapter 350

Evelyn couldn't return Sebastian's feelings, no matter how kind and noble he was. After exacting her revenge, all she could offer him was mutual respect—and a promise to stand by his side.

The next morning, Sebastian received a call and left in a hurry.

After Evelyn finished bathing Amelia, the doorbell chimed.

To her shock, Alexander stood at the threshold, his clothes rumpled from travel, his expression weary yet intense.

When he saw the surprise flicker across her face, he stepped forward without hesitation. His gaze darkened as he suddenly pulled her into a crushing embrace.

Evelyn stiffened. "Alexander?"

"I missed you," he murmured, his voice rough.

His arms tightened around her, as if afraid she would vanish the moment he let go.

She wouldn’t.

Not again.

A bitter smile curved Evelyn’s lips.

Alexander, we share the same face. Once, you looked at it with disgust. Now, you cling to it like a lifeline?

How laughable.

Have you forgotten the scars you carved into me without mercy?

She forced herself to soften in his arms, feigning emotion. "I missed you too..."

His grip tightened at her words, his breath hitching.

Before she could stop him, Amelia skipped into the room.

The little girl’s face lit up at the sight of Alexander.

"Hello, nice mister! You're Ethan’s daddy! I remember you!"

Alexander’s stern expression melted as he crouched to her level, gently cupping Amelia’s cheek.

"And I remember you, Miss Amelia."

Evelyn froze, the glass of water she was pouring nearly slipping from her fingers.

He had investigated her.

That was the only explanation for how he knew Amelia’s name.

Thankfully, Sebastian had altered the DNA report, erasing Alexander’s suspicions.

As she watched, Alexander lifted Amelia into his arms.

The man who was usually cold and unapproachable now wore a rare, tender smile.

Stranger still, Amelia—who usually shied away from strangers—clung to him without hesitation.

Is it because they share blood?

If blood ties matter so much, then why couldn’t my own mother sense me?

Lost in thought, Evelyn barely registered the scalding water spilling over her hand.

Meanwhile, across town, Eleanor nicked her finger on a sharp jewelry clasp while selecting accessories for Victoria. A thin line of blood welled up.

The shop manager rushed to apologize, bandaging the wound with care.

Moments later, Eleanor left with two velvet jewelry boxes in hand.

Victoria had been despondent since her groom abandoned her at the altar.

Eleanor had hoped to lift her spirits with a shopping trip, but Victoria had refused, claiming she wasn’t in the mood.

As a mother, Eleanor understood. So she went alone, determined to surprise her daughter.

A small cut was nothing if it brought Victoria joy.

Just as she was about to call her driver, she spotted Victoria and Margaret stepping into an elevator, their arms linked, laughing.

Eleanor hesitated to shout in public, so she dialed Victoria’s number instead.

The call connected.

She watched as Victoria pulled out her phone—only to glance at the screen with disdain before tossing it back into her purse.

The elevator doors closed, sealing them away.

Eleanor stood frozen, her phone still pressed to her ear.

She quickly rationalized it—Victoria was upset. Of course she’d prefer Margaret’s company.

But unease gnawed at her.

Tracking the elevator’s ascent to the third floor, Eleanor followed.

She searched every boutique, her heart pounding.

Then, outside a tattoo parlor, she heard Margaret’s voice.
###Chapter 351

Upon closer inspection, it was unmistakably Margaret Dawson.

Eleanor Kingsley frowned. This was a tattoo parlor - what business could Victoria Lancaster and her mother Margaret have here?

Was Victoria getting inked?

Had she fallen so deeply for Alexander Blackwood that she wanted his name permanently etched on her skin?

After a moment's hesitation, Eleanor moved to enter.

But as she stepped forward, she overheard Margaret's cheerful phone conversation. "Don't worry, I had someone vet this place weeks ago. The tattoo artist here is exceptionally skilled - the Blackwoods will never notice. Besides, Victoria's just getting a touch-up. Nothing can go wrong."

Eleanor froze mid-step.

'The Blackwoods won't notice?'

'What exactly shouldn't they see?'

Her pulse quickened. Something felt off.

Thirty minutes later, Victoria and Margaret emerged.

Eleanor hid nearby, observing Victoria's radiant expression - not a trace of the heartbreak one would expect after her disastrous wedding.

Watching Victoria's retreating figure, Eleanor shook herself from her daze and entered the shop.

Pulling up Victoria's photo on her phone, Eleanor approached the staff. "What services did this woman receive today?"

The attendant's face turned stern. "Client confidentiality prevents us from disclosing such information."

Eleanor produced five crisp hundred-dollar bills. The attendant's eyes gleamed as he pocketed the cash. "Ah, that client? Just a routine touch-up for her faded tattoo."

"A tattoo? Touch-up?"

Eleanor's confusion deepened.

'Victoria has a tattoo?'

In all their years together, she'd never seen any ink on Victoria's body.

Was it in some intimate location? Was that why Victoria kept it secret - fearing judgment?

The explanation seemed plausible enough to ease Eleanor's mind. She sighed in relief, dismissing her earlier suspicions about Victoria ignoring her calls.

Later that evening, Eleanor and Victoria returned to Montgomery Manor together.

Eleanor visited Victoria's room as if nothing had happened, presenting the expensive jewelry she'd purchased earlier.

Despite living as a wealthy heiress, Victoria's greedy nature remained unchanged. Her eyes sparkled with undisguised delight.

"Mother, you're too good to me." She played the dutiful daughter perfectly.

Eleanor patted her shoulder reassuringly. "You're my only daughter. Whatever you do, I'll always stand by you and protect you."

The words carried hidden meaning - Eleanor hoped Victoria would confide about her tattoo rather than relying solely on her adoptive mother Margaret.

Of course, Victoria missed the subtext. She adorned herself with the glittering jewels and began packing several outfits.

"Mother, I've decided something. Even though my wedding to Alexander was interrupted, everyone knows we're married now. Starting today, I'm moving into Blackwood Estate."

Eleanor's expression darkened. "Victoria, do you truly love Alexander that much? He's beneath you."

"Alexander is the love of my life," Victoria declared passionately. "He's magnificent - just temporarily blinded by that Vivian Prescott. Eventually he'll realize I'm the only woman worthy of his love." She added pragmatically, "Besides, I want to give Ethan a complete family."
###Chapter 352

Eleanor didn't stop Evelyn when she made her declaration.

Evelyn wheeled her luggage into Alexander's mansion. Without keys, the housekeeper had to let her in.

The staff had heard about Evelyn and Alexander's wedding. "Madam, you've returned," the housekeeper stammered.

Evelyn's lips curved at the title.

Even with their ceremony interrupted, her status remained unchanged.

Everyone in Willowbrook knew Evelyn Sinclair was Alexander Blackwood's wife.

She sauntered upstairs, only to find Alexander's bedroom locked.

Footsteps echoed from below. "Sir, you're home. Madam just arrived too."

"Madam?" Alexander frowned, glancing at the woman beside him.

The housekeeper flushed when she noticed Vivian Prescott clinging to Alexander's arm.

"Go prepare dinner," Alexander dismissed her.

"Yes, sir." The housekeeper scurried away.

Silence engulfed the grand estate - until Evelyn's saccharine voice shattered it.

"Alexander, you're back—"

Her voice faltered mid-sentence.

Original from N?velDrama.Org.

Seeing Alexander's fingers intertwined with Vivian's, Evelyn's face darkened.

"So you're this 'madam'?" Vivian arched an eyebrow. "What kind of madam exactly?"

Evelyn's smile twitched as she fought for composure. She approached Alexander with wounded eyes. "Our wedding might've been disrupted, but we're still married." She shot Vivian a venomous look. "I'm Mrs. Blackwood. In every sense of the word."

"In every sense?" Vivian chuckled before tilting her head. "Alexander, I'm parched. That bubble tea shop on Diamond Boulevard - would you fetch me their signature drink?"

"Anything for you." Alexander's reply came instantly, his gaze softening as it traced Vivian's features.

Evelyn's chest constricted watching Alexander prioritize Vivian's casual request over her presence.

Vivian smirked as Alexander turned to leave.

"Vivian Prescott!"

Once the door closed, Evelyn's restraint shattered.

"You scheming witch! How dare you seduce my husband so brazenly?"

Vivian turned slowly, unfazed by the outburst. "Better brazen than two-faced. At least I'm honest about my intentions. And Alexander clearly prefers me this way."

"You—" Evelyn trembled with rage. "You homewrecking harlot!"

"If I'm a harlot, what does that make you, Evelyn?" Vivian countered. "I warned you that night. Told you you'd regret forcing my attendance. Yet you arrogantly claimed I couldn't compete. See how that turned out?"

Evelyn's eyes widened with realization. "I knew it! This was your plan all along! You plotted to steal Alexander from me! Why? Why target my man, you vile—"

Her slap never landed. Vivian intercepted her wrist mid-air, delivering a stinging counter-slap instead.

Vivian tightened her grip, eyes flashing dangerously. "Why? You dare ask why? Evelyn, have you forgotten your own sins?"
###Chapter 353

Evelyn's eyes widened as she stared at the woman before her, completely at a loss.

Her breath hitched when she met that piercing, arrogant gaze.

"You—Vivian, what are you implying? What does my past have to do with you?"

"Doesn't it?" Victoria stepped closer, her face inches away. "Look at me. Can you honestly say, without a shred of guilt, that what you've done has nothing to do with me?"

Evelyn's pulse spiked.

The face in front of her was a ghost from the past—the woman she had driven to her death.

Her throat tightened, fear locking her in place.

"Y-You—Evelyn—"

A cold smirk curled Victoria's lips at Evelyn's terror.

"Finally remembering? Do you recall how you shamelessly inserted yourself into Evelyn and Alexander's marriage? How you schemed against her, burdening her until her last breath?"

Victoria's eyes burned with icy fury. The hatred in her chest was a wildfire, scorching Evelyn where she stood.

"Don't act so victimized now. You ruined someone else's life—did you really think karma wouldn't come for you?"

Evelyn's shock twisted into rage.

She yanked her hand back, eyes darkening. "Vivian, you’ve done your homework. Dug up my past, have you?"

Her jaw clenched. "If I hadn’t seen you seducing Alexander myself, I’d think you were that worthless, pathetic Evelyn Sinclair who deserved to die!"

She scoffed, rolling her eyes before fixing Victoria with a venomous glare. "So what now? Trying to scare me with that face? You think I’m afraid? Even if that bitch crawled out of her grave, I’d send her back—just like I did with her bastard child!"

The truth struck like a blade.

Victoria’s heart shattered. The pain was unbearable, the hatred suffocating. She wanted to tear this monster apart.

Then—the door slammed open.

Evelyn froze, a wave of icy dread crashing over her.

She spun around.

Alexander stood there, fury radiating from him like a storm.

The blood drained from Evelyn’s face.

"A-Alexander," she stammered. "W-Why are you back so soon?"

His expression was glacial. Each step forward was heavy with barely restrained rage.

Evelyn’s knees trembled.

"What. Did. You. Say?" His voice was lethally quiet.

She swallowed hard. This was the calm before destruction.

"I—This bitch slapped me!" Evelyn clutched her cheek, eyes welling with crocodile tears. "Alexander, you have to defend me!"

But his gaze never wavered—cold, unyielding.

Her act faltered.

"I-I was just talking nonsense! She provoked me! I only wanted to scare her into leaving you!"

"Such creative threats, Miss Lancaster." Victoria’s voice trembled with feigned fear. "First, you wanted to disfigure me like you did Evelyn. Then, you bragged about strangling her child. Alexander, I’m terrified."

She rushed to his side, pressing against him, her earlier fierceness melting into vulnerability.

Evelyn’s jaw dropped.

This Vivian Prescott was even more skilled at manipulation than she was.
###Chapter 354

Once, she had played this very role to win Alexander’s trust and sympathy. But now—

Evelyn watched as Alexander pulled Vivian into his arms, his voice thick with protective fervor.

"No one will lay a finger on you as long as I’m here!"

"Alexander, she’s faking it! That woman is nothing but an actress!" Victoria snapped, her voice trembling with rage.

"Even if she is acting, I’d gladly watch."

His response froze Victoria in place. At the same time, it stunned Evelyn—though secretly, it made her lips curl in satisfaction.

Victoria, you’re finally tasting your own medicine.

"Alexander, after all these years together, you don’t trust me? You’d rather believe this scheming witch? I’m heartbroken!"

Victoria covered her face, her shoulders shaking with dramatic sobs. Then, without another word, she turned and fled upstairs to the guest room.

In truth, she wasn’t running from heartbreak—she was running from Alexander’s questions.

If he pressed her about the child he had with Evelyn all those years ago, she wouldn’t have an answer.

She had orchestrated the forced labor, stolen the premature infant, and passed it off as her own.

After Evelyn’s release from prison, she had lied, claiming Alexander had killed the child.

When Alexander learned of Evelyn’s delivery in prison, Victoria had fabricated medical reports to convince him the baby had died from birth complications.

Only Margaret, Richard, and she knew the truth. And she would never allow a fourth person to uncover it.

Downstairs, Evelyn feigned distress. "Alexander, I’ve given up everything to be with you. I’m terrified Victoria will hurt me. Is it true she really… smothered your child with Evelyn?"

A sharp pang struck Alexander’s chest. He searched her eyes—wide with feigned concern—before answering quietly, "What if I told you I don’t even know the truth myself?"

On the surface, Evelyn looked bewildered. Inside, she sneered.

Alexander Blackwood, how dare you claim ignorance?

I saw you order that tombstone shattered. I watched as the child I carried for ten months was crushed to dust. You didn’t even spare the ashes—and now you have the audacity to say you don’t know?

"Stay with me from now on. Don’t leave my sight. I’ll keep you safe."

His voice was tender, brushing against her ear like a lover’s whisper.

Evelyn’s mind flashed with memories drenched in hatred. She glanced toward the second floor.

"Will Victoria be staying here too?"

Alexander smiled, his gaze softening. "Trust me. Soon, you’ll be the only mistress of this house. And my only wife."

The only mistress. The only wife.

Evelyn laughed inwardly—bitter, mocking. But outwardly, she played her part flawlessly. "Okay. I believe you."

No, Alexander. The only one I trust is myself.

And soon, you and Victoria will pay for everything.

She met his eyes, her heart a vault of vengeance. Then, he took her hand.

"Come. There’s somewhere I want to take you."
###Chapter 355

The instant Evelyn regained consciousness, Alexander firmly grasped her wrist and pulled her toward the exit.

Evelyn studied his intense expression with growing curiosity.

Where exactly was he taking her?

Victoria lingered in the guest suite for nearly an hour before hearing the distinct rumble of an engine.

Peering through the balcony doors, she watched Alexander drive away with Evelyn clinging to his arm.

Clutching her designer handbag, Victoria muttered obscenities under her breath while summoning a private car to the Montgomery estate.

After receiving Victoria's update, Margaret and Richard erupted in furious curses directed at Vivian.

Their faces soon twisted with concern.

"That scheming whore dared to humiliate you? She even invaded your home to steal Alexander right from under you!" Margaret's face flushed crimson as she clenched her fists. "She's more treacherous than Evelyn ever was! I'll tear that bitch apart with my bare hands!"

"Victoria, is that woman really carrying Alexander's child?" Richard interjected. "If it's true, you must eliminate that bastard immediately!"

"Obviously I know that!" Victoria sneered, already formulating plans. "But Alexander acts completely bewitched! He obeys that slut's every word now!"

"Why?" Richard frowned.

Victoria ground her teeth before confessing, "Because Evelyn is dead, and he's transferred all that misplaced affection and longing onto Vivian instead!"

"Alexander always cherished me most. But now that bitch is gone, he claims he never loved me." Her voice dripped venom. "Just some childhood nostalgia. Hah! That nostalgia belongs to Evelyn, not me!"

Seeing Victoria tremble with rage, Margaret leaned closer with a wicked suggestion. "Darling, don't fret. Don't you still hold the ultimate bargaining chip?" Her eyes gleamed maliciously. "That little brat Ethan remains your greatest weapon."

"That bastard child?" Victoria scoffed. "I should have smothered him years ago! He's nothing but an eyesore now."

"If he's such an eyesore, make him disappear permanently." Margaret's lips curled. "But ensure Vivian takes the blame. Two birds with one stone!"

A sinister light ignited in Victoria's eyes.

"Mother, you're brilliant." A cruel smile spread across her face. "There's a family hike this afternoon. That bitch Vivian will definitely attend. The perfect opportunity presents itself."

She practically vibrated with dark anticipation.

Framing others for murder had always been her specialty.

Evelyn never anticipated Alexander's destination when he mentioned taking her somewhere special.

He purchased another lavish bouquet of crimson roses—this time placing them directly in Evelyn's arms.

She didn't count the stems, but the weight suggested another ninety-nine rose arrangement.

Leaning against the sleek car door, she twirled a rose between her fingers. "Alexander, is this your idea of a romantic date spot?"

His gaze grew distant. "I never found cemeteries frightening. Not until three years ago, when a woman stood before me and vowed to return everything—even her ashes." His voice dropped. "That's when I learned true terror—the finality of death."

Evelyn's pulse quickened.

'Is he speaking of me?'

'Did my death teach him to fear mortality?'

'Hmph.'

'Alexander, you fear death now?'

'Did you ever consider how terrified my child was when you murdered it?'

She lifted her chin with a mocking smile.

The setting sun cast long shadows across his haunted expression.

"Vivian, you truly love me, don't you?"

Evelyn batted her lashes, answering without hesitation. "Of course I 'love' you, darling."

Alexander smiled faintly, studying her breathtaking beauty before murmuring, "That's enough for me."

Twilight mist swirled around them as they returned to the Blackwood estate.

The moment Alexander opened the grand doors, savory aromas wafted from the kitchen.

"Alexander, you're home." Victoria emerged wearing a saccharine smile. "I prepared your favorite dishes."
###Chapter 356

The moment Victoria saw Alexander returning with Evelyn, her smile stiffened. She forced a wounded expression onto her face.

"Alexander..."

"Vivian and I have already eaten. You can dine alone," Alexander replied coldly. His gaze flickered to Evelyn before adding, "Let's go upstairs."

"Alexander!" Victoria hurried after them, blocking their path. "I know you have deep misunderstandings about me. You might even believe I hurt Evelyn in the past. But I swear, my conscience is clear."

"Miss Lancaster, your conscience was devoured by wolves long ago," Evelyn remarked smoothly. "How can you claim it's still intact?"

Victoria's fingers twitched, fury simmering beneath her skin. But she swallowed it down—she had a plan to execute.

"Alexander, Ethan's kindergarten is hosting a parent-child hike this Saturday. Both parents need to attend. No matter what you think of me now, Ethan is still our son. I hope you'll participate with us."

"You can go alone," Alexander dismissed without hesitation.

Victoria's face paled. Just as she opened her mouth to plead, Evelyn spoke up instead.

"Alexander, you should go." She gave him a soft smile. "I'll bring Amelia too. We can meet up there. Think of it as spending time with me, alright?"

The moment Evelyn said those words, Alexander's expression softened instantly. "Anything for you."

"You're too good to me."

Evelyn beamed, looping her arm through his.

Victoria trembled with suppressed rage.

The triumphant glint in Evelyn's eyes only fueled the murderous storm brewing in Victoria's gaze.

Saturday arrived swiftly.

Evelyn dressed in a sleek tracksuit and brought Amelia to the kindergarten.

Originally, Sebastian had planned to join them, but an urgent call had forced him to fly to France the night before.

Though early, the kindergarten entrance buzzed with energy.

Four buses stood ready, packed with nearly three hundred parents and children.

Evelyn boarded with Amelia. Moments later, her phone buzzed—Alexander's text.

She turned and spotted Victoria and Ethan standing beside him, waiting to board another bus.

Ethan looked withdrawn, his small hand trapped in Victoria's grip. His usual spark was missing.

This child hated crowds. He always retreated into dark corners, nursing his loneliness alone.

Evelyn's heart ached. She nearly rushed off the bus to embrace him—but the engine roared to life, pulling away.

Half an hour later, they arrived at Willowbrook's most scenic outskirts—a popular spot for picnics and hiking.

The crisp autumn air was perfect for outdoor activities.

Watching Amelia's delighted grin, Evelyn suddenly felt like a failure of a mother.

She'd been so consumed by vengeance that she'd neglected her daughter.

Even if she despised Amelia's father, she couldn't deny that this child was her reason to keep living.

"Ew, Amelia! So it's true—you don't have a daddy!" A sneering boy pointed at her, smirking. He planted his hands on his hips, mocking her. "Liar! You said your daddy was handsome, but he doesn't even exist!"

He stuck out his tongue. "My daddy is the handsomest!" He jabbed a finger toward a burly man nearby.

Amelia's eyes widened. "I'm not lying! I have a daddy! He's the best!"

"You don't! Where is he, then? Liar!" The boy yanked at her braid. "Last time, you lied that your daddy would beat me up if I bullied you! But he's not real!"

He reached for her hair again.

Evelyn moved to intervene—but a warm presence stepped in before her.

A large hand caught the boy's wrist mid-air.

"Ow! That hurts!" the brat whined. He looked up—and froze.

"Who the hell are you? Don't touch my kid!" The boy's father stormed over, face red.

Alexander lifted his chin, effortlessly scooping Amelia into his arms. His voice was ice.

"I'm Amelia's father. Alexander Blackwood."
###Chapter 357

Evelyn froze when she heard Alexander's words. Her eyes lifted to see him holding little Amelia protectively, his stormy gaze locked onto the approaching man.

"Daddy! That's him! He scared me!" The bratty boy hid behind his father's legs, pointing accusingly at Alexander.

The man cracked his knuckles aggressively, but his bravado evaporated the moment he recognized Alexander. "M-Mr. Blackwood! I didn't realize it was you!"

Alexander remained impassive, showing no recognition of the man. Undeterred, the man continued with nervous laughter. "Sir, I work in the architectural division on floor 16 at Blackwood Enterprises. You wouldn't know me, but I've seen you in meetings. What an incredible coincidence!"

He then turned his attention to Amelia. "This must be your daughter? She's absolutely stunning - clearly takes after you! Look at those cheekbones, exactly like yours—"

Evelyn cut in sharply. "Your flattery is as poor as your parenting. Perhaps focus on teaching your son basic decency instead?" Her tone was icy as she moved to take Amelia from Alexander's arms.

The man's eyes widened when he saw Evelyn standing beside Alexander. "Oh! Mrs. Blackwood! How elegant you look! You're absolutely right to reprimand me!" He immediately smacked his son's head. "You little troublemaker! Apologize right now or I'll tan your hide!"

The boy's bravado vanished. "S-sorry... won't do it again..." he stammered.

"Mr. Blackwood, is this... acceptable?" The man smiled nervously.

Alexander's gaze was glacial. "Discipline begins at home. Consider this your first warning. Two strikes and you're out of my company."

The man paled, realizing his mistake in revealing his employment. "P-please, Mr. Blackwood, let me explain—"

Alexander turned away dismissively, approaching Evelyn where he heard Amelia's sweet voice asking, "Mommy, the pretty man said he's my daddy. Do I have two daddies now?"

Evelyn's expression shifted before she smiled gently. "No sweetheart, you only have one daddy. His name is—"

"His name is Alexander Blackwood."

Evelyn looked up sharply to see Alexander approaching with uncharacteristic softness in his expression.

Dressed in athletic wear, he looked younger than usual with the autumn breeze tousling his hair. He reached out to stroke Amelia's head tenderly.

"Amelia, from today onward, I'm your daddy."

"Really, pretty man?" The little girl blinked her large, innocent eyes.

"Yes." Alexander's confirmation was solemn.

Evelyn set Amelia down gently. "Sweetheart, go play with your friends. Mommy will come get you later."

"Okay!" Amelia skipped away happily.

Alexander's voice was low behind Evelyn. "Since you'll soon be my wife, isn't it natural for Amelia to call me father?"

Evelyn suppressed her irritation, forcing a smile. "She's too young to understand adult arrangements."

Alexander nodded thoughtfully, then grinned. "That man wasn't entirely wrong though - she does resemble me."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "He was just sucking up. Amelia is Sebastian's daughter - why would she look like you? Though I suppose there might be some family resemblance since you're uncle and nephew."

Alexander's smile deepened with hidden meaning as he studied Evelyn. "Are you jealous?" she teased.

The corner of his mouth lifted dangerously as his gaze traced her features. "Why would I be? Your heart already belongs to me."

"Good that you understand," Evelyn said lightly. "Speaking of children, where's Ethan? Despite my feelings about Victoria, he's truly a wonderful boy."

"You like Ethan?"

"Very much," Evelyn admitted sincerely. She'd always felt a special connection with the boy.

Alexander grew thoughtful at her genuine smile. "Since you're so fond of him, I'll make sure you get custody."
###Chapter 358

Alexander's response stunned Evelyn. Yet the intensity in his gaze confirmed this was no jest.

"I'd move heaven and earth to see you smile."

"Alexander! Alexander!"

Victoria's frantic voice shattered the moment as she came running toward them, her face streaked with tears.

Evelyn instinctively glanced behind Victoria, but saw no sign of Ethan.

"Alexander, Ethan's gone missing again!" Victoria clutched at Alexander's sleeve, her eyes swollen from crying.

"It's all my fault! I took my eyes off him for just a second. Yell at me, Alexander! I was so distracted watching you that I—"

Evelyn cut through Victoria's theatrics. "Miss Lancaster, tears won't find him. If you truly cared, this wouldn't keep happening."

"Vivian, you'd never understand! He's my son—mine and Alexander's! You'll never know this agony!"

"Enough." Alexander's voice turned glacial. "Finding him comes first."

Victoria's lips trembled into silence.

"I'll help search." Evelyn met Alexander's gaze before hurrying to Amelia.

After briefing Amelia's teacher, Evelyn joined the desperate hunt for Ethan.

Hours passed with no success.

The crisp autumn morning had darkened into a brooding afternoon, the sky threatening rain.

Soon, only Ethan's teacher remained as other parents evacuated their children.

Then the downpour began.

With each passing minute, Evelyn's dread intensified.

Her stomach churned at the thought of Ethan alone in the wilderness.

The memory of his frightened eyes that night made her blood run cold.

"Ethan? It's Vivian!" Her voice echoed through the empty woods as rain soaked through her clothes.

She pressed deeper into the forest bordering Willow Lane.

"Ethan, can you hear me?"

Victoria's hysterical sobs suddenly cut through the rain.

"Ethan, baby, please answer me!"

Evelyn froze before sprinting toward the cliffside where Victoria crouched.

Victoria clutched a small pendant, wailing at the precipice's edge.

"Victoria! What happened?"

"He fell!" Victoria pointed downward with a trembling hand.

Evelyn's breath hitched as primal terror gripped her.

She whirled to summon help.

Victoria seized her arm. "Vivian, I know you despise me, but I'm begging—save my boy! Take your hatred out on me, not an innocent child!"

"We need professionals! Neither of us can—"

"No!" Victoria's grip turned vice-like.

"Why not?"

"Because—" Victoria's eyes gleamed with sudden malice. "Because that wretched child has been waiting for you down there all along!"

As Victoria shoved her, Evelyn grabbed the woman's wrist.

But the rain-slicked ground betrayed her.

With a sickening lurch, Evelyn felt herself plummeting into the abyss.
###Chapter 359

Alexander heard rustling sounds coming from the dense woods. A fleeting glimpse of Victoria's silhouette flashed between the trees.

His eyes scanned the area but found no trace of Vivian. His heartbeat accelerated dangerously.

He pulled out his phone to call her, but the signal bars remained stubbornly empty.

The mist-shrouded forest loomed before him, intensifying his growing unease.

Victoria had originally planned to eliminate Ethan and frame Vivian. But at the final moment, she changed her mind.

Why not get rid of both obstacles at once?

A cruel smirk twisted Victoria's lips as she recalled her flawless scheme.

She knew Alexander would come searching for Vivian first.

Just as predicted, he'd rushed to find Vivian. Meanwhile, she'd slipped crushed sedatives into Ethan's water bottle. Then paid a fake parent to suffocate the boy and dispose of the body.

No evidence. No witnesses.

The outdoor location had no surveillance. Among hundreds of parents and children, who would notice one man carrying away a sleeping child?

By now, Ethan must be dead.

As for Vivian... that steep ravine should have finished her off.

Even if she survived the fall, the dense woods had no cell reception. With severe injuries and no help coming, death was inevitable.

Victoria exhaled in relief. Finally, she could sleep peacefully without these nuisances in her life.

Her moment of triumph shattered when Alexander's imposing figure materialized before her.

"What are you doing in the woods?" His icy voice sent chills down her spine.

Victoria's mind raced. Had he seen her with Vivian?

Tears sprang to her eyes instantly. "Alexander!" she wailed. "Vivian is monstrous! She framed me to get to you, and now she's targeted our son!"

She moved to embrace him, but he gripped her shoulders instead. "Explain. Now."

His piercing gaze felt like daggers.

Victoria masked her panic with fresh sobs. "It's all Vivian's fault! She planned this whole trip just to kidnap Ethan! She must have hurt him already!"

She continued dramatically, "I grew suspicious and followed her. Saw her paying off some man in the woods! When I confronted her, she admitted everything! Then she tried to kill me by pushing me down the ravine! But then—"

Tears streamed down her face as she feigned terror.

Alexander's temples throbbed. Breathing became difficult.

"What happened then?" he roared, his brows knitted tightly.

Victoria trembled. "She... she slipped and fell down the ravine instead!"

Alexander's hands dropped limply from her shoulders. A storm brewed in his dark eyes.

Without another word, he turned and plunged into the worsening autumn rain.

His chest felt hollow. The same unbearable emptiness from when he'd lost Evelyn three years ago returned, dragging his heart into an endless void.

Victoria clenched her fists as she watched him disappear into the trees.

She hadn't anticipated Alexander caring so deeply about Vivian. He'd abandoned searching for his own son to chase after that woman.

"Good riddance," Victoria muttered through gritted teeth. A vicious smile curled her lips.
###Chapter 360

Victoria admired her own ruthlessness.

The perfect ending would be Vivian's death.

Otherwise, Alexander would never return to her while that woman still breathed.

Alexander searched desperately along the treacherous cliffside. Yet the exact spot where Evelyn had fallen remained elusive.

His mind teetered on the brink of madness. Focus eluded him. Rational thought had abandoned him completely.

The relentless rain seemed to pierce his very soul, drowning all coherent emotions.

Every passing second decreased Evelyn's chances of survival.

Alexander returned to where Victoria stood. Rainwater streamed down his chiseled features, his expression frozen in glacial fury.

Just then, Eleanor arrived unexpectedly, rushing from her car with an umbrella to shield Victoria.

Victoria ran to Alexander, her voice choked with manufactured tears. "Alexander, have you found Ethan's body?"

His eyes darkened dangerously. "Body? Why are you so certain Ethan is dead?"

"V-Vivian confessed everything!" Victoria declared with false conviction. "She admitted wanting to kill us both to have you for herself. I never imagined she could be so vicious. Though perhaps this fall is karma for her wickedness."

"Alexander! Are you satisfied now?" Eleanor shrieked, her eyes red-rimmed. "You sacrificed your own son for that scheming whore! My poor nephew—only five years old—murdered by—"

Alexander's piercing gaze silenced Eleanor mid-sentence. He studied Victoria's carefully constructed grief. "Do you honestly think I'd believe your fabricated story now?"

Victoria's tears halted abruptly.

Eleanor exploded. "Alexander! How dare you accuse Victoria! You think she would harm her own child?"

Victoria's pulse raced as she silently cursed.

The truth was exactly that—she had orchestrated everything.

Alexander's bone-chilling glare pinned her in place. "Tell me. Where exactly did Vivian fall?" His patience had evaporated.

"Alexander! You're still worried about that bitch at a time like this!"

"Silence! I wasn't speaking to you!" Alexander's eyes turned arctic. The violence in his gaze intensified. "If Vivian suffers even a scratch, I'll ensure you experience twice the pain."

"What—"

"Alexander! Have you lost your mind?" Victoria's mask slipped. "You're ignoring our son's safety for some homewrecking slut! That scheming Jezebel murdered our child! Vivian Prescott is vermin who deserves to die!"

"Daddy."

A small, solemn voice cut through Victoria's tirade.

Her eyes widened in shock.

Ethan.

Alive and unharmed.

"Ethan!" Eleanor cried joyfully. "You're safe! Thank heavens!"

Alexander narrowed his eyes at the small figure in the rain.

Ethan's clothes were soaked, his face pale. Though his doll-like features remained composed, worry flickered in his large eyes.

Alexander knelt before him. "Ethan. You're alright."

Meeting his father's intense gaze, Ethan spoke quietly. "Please save Vivian."

Alexander's eyes flashed with hope. "You know where she is?"

Ethan nodded, then turned his gaze to Victoria's panicked expression. "I saw Mommy push Vivian off the cliff with my own eyes."
###Chapter 361

What?

Victoria stood frozen in shock as Ethan's words echoed in her ears.

That little brat surviving was bad enough, but did he just say he witnessed her pushing Vivian down the slope?

The rain hammered against the windows, but its fury paled compared to the storm brewing in Alexander's piercing gaze.

When Alexander rose to his feet, Victoria felt her blood turn to ice. His expression was colder than the winter winds outside.

"Alexander, it's not true! Ethan misunderstood!" Victoria's voice trembled as she clutched at his sleeve. "Vivian tried to push me first - she slipped by accident! I'm innocent!"

"Victoria, calm down. Of course I believe you." Eleanor Kingsley patted her daughter's shoulder soothingly before turning to Ethan.

"Sweetheart, let Grandma check if you're hurt. That wicked woman would harm even a child! Tell Grandma exactly what happened."

Ethan's thick brows furrowed in displeasure. "Vivian's good," he stated firmly, his small hands balling into fists. Then he looked up at his father with pleading eyes. "Daddy, we have to save Vivian now."

Alexander's glacial stare burned into Victoria. The fury in his eyes could have melted steel.

Then he turned sharply, following Ethan into the storm. Father and son moved with identical determination, both consumed by worry for Vivian.

How was this happening?

Why was that brat still alive?

Victoria's mind reeled. Trapped by Eleanor's presence, she couldn't slip away to investigate.

She could only seethe silently, praying that Vivian's body lay broken at the bottom of the ravine.

Hours passed. Alexander and Ethan reached the spot where Evelyn had fallen, but found no trace of her.

"Daddy, your phone."

Alexander looked down to see Ethan's small face set in grim determination. The boy's eyes mirrored his own fear.

Without hesitation, Alexander handed over his phone.

Ethan's chubby fingers flew across the screen with surprising skill. Within moments, a pulsing red dot appeared on the GPS display.

Less than thirty feet away!

Alexander's breath caught when he saw hope light up Ethan's previously somber face. "Is that Vivian's location?"

Ethan nodded vigorously, already moving toward the signal without hesitation.

"Wait here. I'll go." Alexander tried to take back the phone.

Ethan gripped his father's hand with unexpected strength. "I'm coming too."

The resolve in those young eyes startled Alexander. He didn't argue as they carefully descended the slippery slope.

At the bottom, they found a small clearing near a stream.

Ethan spotted something glinting among the wet grass as they followed the signal.

He crouched down and picked up a delicate crystal bracelet.

"Vivian...!"

"Is that hers?" Alexander recognized the jewelry immediately. He'd noticed it on Evelyn's wrist just days before.
###Chapter 362

"I gave this to Vivian," Ethan murmured, his small fingers tracing the bracelet's delicate chain.

Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto the child before him. "Did you embed a tracker in this?" The question hung heavy in the air, met only with silence.

Ethan rose, staring at the lake's rippling surface—once calm, now fractured by the downpour. Raindrops mirrored the unshed tears in his eyes.

Then, without warning, Alexander shrugged off his coat and plunged into the dark waters.

Dusk bled into night.

The storm had passed, but the search raged on.

An early autumn chill gnawed at their soaked clothes, the wind carving icy fingers into their bones. Six hours had slipped by since Vivian's disappearance.

Victoria knew victory was hers.

Dozens of professional divers had scoured the depths. No trace. The lake had swallowed Vivian whole.

She stifled a smirk, itching to leave—until she caught Alexander's silhouette, motionless as a statue. The sight unnerved her.

"Alexander," she ventured, voice honeyed with false concern, "you're drenched. You'll catch pneumonia." Her fingers twitched toward his arm but recoiled at the glacial aura around him.

Those eyes—blacker than the lake at midnight—sliced through her. The same look he'd worn outside the ER when Evelyn Sinclair flatlined. A gaze that promised annihilation.

"Pray she's unharmed." His whisper carried the weight of a guillotine. "Or I'll bury her assailant beside her."

This was no bluff. His chest cavity yawned empty, a void screaming how much that missing woman meant.

Victoria's breath hitched. "It wasn't me! Ethan, how could you—" A sob cracked her voice. "You're five years old! Lying will rot your soul!"

Ethan regarded her with eerie calm. "I saw you push her."

"Lies!" Eleanor Kingsley wailed. "Victoria carried you for nine months! She'd never abandon you!"

"Mommy tried." The child's monotone cut deeper than any scream. "I ran. Then she pushed Vivian."

Alexander's head snapped up. "You abandoned him too?"

"No!" Victoria's denials tumbled out like dice. "He's confused! That witch poisoned his mind!"

"The liar isn't Ethan."

A voice, smooth as midnight silk, uncoiled from the darkness.

Alexander's dead pulse roared back to life. His head whipped toward the sound—and there she stood, poised as a queen reclaiming her throne.

"Vivian." Her name was a lifeline on his lips.

Moonlight sculpted her defiant features, reigniting the fire in his hollowed chest.

Victoria staggered back. The figure in Vivian's grip made her blood freeze.

Game over.
###Chapter 363

Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn as she stood unharmed before him.

Relief flooded his striking features, though he remained silent.

"Vivian Prescott!" Eleanor Kingsley's shrill voice cut through the tension. She jabbed a manicured finger at Evelyn. "After all the wicked things you've done, you dare show your face here? What fresh scheme are you plotting against my daughter now?"

Evelyn's crystalline eyes gleamed with quiet amusement. "Do you truly wish me dead, Mrs. Kingsley?" Her lips curved into a chilling smile. "I fear you'd lose sleep if I were gone."

"Don't flatter yourself," Eleanor sneered. "A woman like you would rot forgotten. Why should I care?" Her glare turned venomous. "Stop this madness, Vivian. Evil always consumes itself."

"Save that wisdom for your precious Victoria," Evelyn countered, shoving her captive forward. The man stumbled and collapsed at Victoria Lancaster's feet with a pained groan.

As he scrambled to escape, Alexander's polished shoe shot out, effortlessly blocking his path.

"Alexander, don't let him run," Evelyn instructed coolly.

The man whimpered, clutching his injured leg. "Please! I won't run! Just let me go!"

Evelyn loomed over him, gesturing toward Ethan. "Tell them what you did to this child earlier."

The scrawny man's eyes darted between Ethan and the surrounding faces. When they met Alexander's glacial stare, he shuddered violently.

"I—I kidnapped the boy," he stammered.

"Why?" Evelyn pressed.

"S-Someone paid me... to kill him."

Eleanor's face contorted in outrage. "Who dared order such a thing? Speak!"

Victoria's nails dug into her palms as she glared daggers at the trembling man.

The kidnapper hesitated, his gaze flickering toward Victoria.

A dangerous glint flashed in Victoria's eyes. "You monster!" She lunged forward, raining blows on him while hissing under her breath.

Evelyn observed the theatrics with detached interest. "Enough, Victoria. We all know you hired him. Ethan never went missing—you orchestrated this."

"Lies!" Victoria whirled around, eyes blazing with false indignation. "The truth will out! Go on—tell them who really hired you!"

The man swallowed hard before suddenly pointing at Evelyn. "It was her! She paid me to frame this woman!" He flung a thick envelope at Evelyn's feet. "Take your blood money back!"

Evelyn arched a brow at the unexpected twist but remained composed.

"Vivian Prescott!" Eleanor's voice trembled with fury. "You vile creature! I'm calling the police—you'll rot in prison for this!"

"Alexander," Victoria purred, sidling closer. "Even her hired thug couldn't stomach her cruelty. Surely you see the truth now?"

Alexander's icy chuckle sent chills down her spine. "Do I?"

Victoria faltered. "You still doubt me?"

"With good reason," Evelyn murmured.

"You're still denying it?" Eleanor shrieked.

Evelyn ignored her, focusing on the quivering man. "You claim I gave you this money?" She nudged the envelope with her toe. "And ordered you to kill Ethan?"

"Yes!" the man declared dramatically. "But the boy was too innocent! I couldn't do it! And now you want me to betray an innocent woman? Never!"

"How noble," Victoria mocked. "Yet you took the money to begin with."

Evelyn's lips curled into a knowing smile as she reached into her coat pocket. "Let's settle this properly."
###Chapter 364

The man stood frozen, utterly speechless.

Evelyn reached into the pocket of her waterproof jacket with deliberate slowness. She retrieved a tissue before bending gracefully to pick up the envelope by its corner.

"Did you contact the authorities, Mrs. Kingsley?" Her lips curved into a crescent moon smile.

Eleanor glared daggers at her. "Vivian, the police will arrive shortly. Don't even consider trying to weasel your way out of this."

"You should save your excuses for your darling daughter." Evelyn gave the envelope a meaningful shake. "Thank you for providing the evidence. I'm certain the drug dealer's fingerprints will be all over this."

The man's face went pale as he instinctively glanced toward Victoria.

Victoria's mouth twitched uncontrollably, her expression one of complete panic.

Evelyn's smile widened at their reactions. "Mrs. Kingsley, you might want to call your family attorney. I'm curious—how will you explain why your daughter's fingerprints are on this envelope?"

"What ridiculous accusations! Victoria's prints couldn't possibly be there!" Eleanor snapped.

"The forensic results will speak for themselves." Evelyn had no interest in further debate. She handed the envelope to Alexander. "Alexander, I trust only you with this."

Her gaze softened as she looked at him. "When I fell down that slope, I was terrified I'd never see you again."

Alexander's eyes held depths of unreadable emotion as he returned her gaze. "I won't allow you to disappear from my life again."

Victoria looked ready to explode as she witnessed their intimate exchange.

The police arrived shortly thereafter.

After briefing the officers, everyone was instructed to accompany them to the station for formal statements.

Evelyn entered the patrol car without hesitation. To maintain her innocent facade, Victoria quickly followed suit.

Stepping into the vehicle that once represented her worst nightmares, Evelyn felt an unexpected calm.

She was no longer the helpless Evelyn Sinclair of the past.

Even if someone pushed her off a cliff today, she'd claw her way back from the abyss.

After giving her statement, Evelyn emerged to find Alexander waiting with a fresh coat from his car, which he draped over her shoulders. Eleanor and Victoria exited another interrogation room at the same moment.

Victoria feigned distress, lowering her head to manipulate Eleanor's sympathy when she saw Alexander preparing to leave with Evelyn.

Eleanor immediately pulled Victoria forward. "Alexander! Victoria is your wife! How dare you flaunt your affair with this woman so shamelessly! What do you take my daughter for?"

Evelyn paused mid-step. "If Alexander shouldn't leave with me, then should he leave with your precious daughter instead?" she inquired sweetly before shifting her gaze. "Victoria, did you really think you'd walk free tonight?"

"Vivian, what are you implying?" Eleanor demanded.

Two officers approached Victoria before she could respond.

"Victoria Lancaster, you're under investigation for attempted murder. Please cooperate with our inquiries."

Victoria's face contorted in shock. "Officers, there must be some mistake! I would never—"

"My daughter is incapable of such things! Have you properly investigated? You can't arrest someone based on baseless accusations!" Eleanor shrieked.

"Ma'am, your comments constitute obstruction of justice and disrespect toward our professional judgment. We only make arrests with substantial evidence," the officer stated firmly.

"Evidence? That envelope?"

"Oh, it's far more than just fingerprints," Evelyn interjected smoothly. She produced her phone and played a recording—Victoria's voice clearly admitting her crimes in the forest.

Victoria's face drained of color as the damning words played. Eleanor's expression shifted through a spectrum of emotions.

Evelyn's gaze turned steely. "Surprised, Victoria? I recorded everything."

"You never expected this, did you? I came prepared because I knew better than to trust your sudden kindness. If I hadn't been worried about Ethan, do you think you'd have succeeded in pushing me? Your cruelty knows no bounds—willing to kill me and sacrifice your own son!"
###Chapter 365

Eleanor Kingsley's hands trembled as she clutched the phone.

"This...this can't be happening!" Her voice cracked with disbelief.

Victoria Lancaster's cruel words echoed in her mind—how she had referred to Ethan as that wretched child.

"No! That's not Victoria's voice!" Eleanor shook her head violently. "Vivian Prescott, how dare you fabricate evidence? You must have hired someone to impersonate her!"

Victoria snapped back to reality. She hadn't expected Vivian to be recording their conversation all along.

But she wasn't about to admit anything.

"Mom, you have to believe me. That wasn't me in that recording! It's a fake!" Victoria protested, her eyes wide with desperation.

"Alexander, someone is trying to ruin me! That video is doctored! Why would I ever hurt Ethan? He's my own flesh and blood!"

Tears welled in her eyes as she turned to Evelyn.

"Vivian Prescott, you'll stop at nothing to get Alexander, won't you? Even after that man pointed the finger at you, you're still twisting the truth! That woman in the video isn't me!"

"I knew you'd say that," Evelyn replied coolly. "But perhaps you're unaware that voiceprints, like fingerprints, are unique. Once we analyze the recording, the truth will be undeniable."

Victoria's tears froze mid-fall. Her mouth hung open, her mind scrambling for a retort.

Voiceprints.

Did such a thing even exist?

"Run the tests, then! I refuse to believe my daughter would do something so vile!" Eleanor stood firm beside Victoria. "Victoria, I believe you!"

Victoria's confidence shattered. The arrogance that had once defined her was gone.

Evelyn smirked. "Can't you see, Mrs. Kingsley? Your precious daughter is so guilty she can't even speak."

Eleanor whirled around. The moment she saw Victoria's ashen face, dread coiled in her chest.

"Victoria...?"

"Save your explanations for tomorrow. Victoria Lancaster, you're coming with us." The officers stepped forward, producing a pair of handcuffs.

Victoria jolted as if struck by lightning. She stared at the cold metal restraints, shaking her head violently.

"I won't go to prison! I didn't do it! I was framed!"

"Alexander, you have to believe me! Vivian set me up! Mom, save me! I'm innocent!"

"Victoria! Victoria!" Eleanor panicked, immediately dialing William.

Evelyn remained still, watching as Victoria was dragged away, still screaming her innocence. Satisfaction gleamed in her sharp, knowing eyes.

Victoria was swiftly taken into custody. The evidence against her was overwhelming.

Even the short man had begun pointing fingers, claiming Victoria was the true mastermind behind Ethan's kidnapping.

Eleanor refused to accept that her daughter could be so heartless.

"There must be a mistake! That witch Vivian must have manipulated everything!" she insisted, clinging to the belief that Victoria was blameless.

"William, Victoria is our daughter. We failed her once by bringing home the wrong child, robbing her of twenty years of love. You have to get her out of there!"

William placed a comforting hand on her shoulder, his aged but distinguished face lined with sorrow.

"I've spoken to my contacts at the station. The evidence is irrefutable. Victoria did plan Vivian's murder. She did orchestrate Ethan's kidnapping."

Eleanor's eyes widened in horror. "No! That's impossible! Our daughter would never—"

"Perhaps this is our fault," William murmured. "If Victoria had grown up with us, she might not have strayed down this path. Her adoptive mother kidnapped Vivian, and now... perhaps she followed in her footsteps."
###Chapter 366

Eleanor burst into tears upon hearing the news. "It's all my fault. My health deteriorated terribly after giving birth to Sophia. You were so preoccupied with taking care of me that we neglected Victoria..."

William gripped Eleanor's shoulders, his voice thick with despair. "Don't cry, Ellie. Victoria is our only daughter. I swear I'll bring her home safely."

Meanwhile, Richard and Margaret rushed to the police station after learning of Victoria's arrest.

When Margaret saw her daughter in a prison jumpsuit, disheveled and exhausted in the visitation room, her blood ran cold.

Her precious cash cow was about to topple.

"Victoria! Sweetheart, what happened?"

Victoria glared at them with undisguised irritation. "Talking is pointless now. Only Eleanor and William can get me out of this mess."

Richard and Margaret exchanged uneasy glances. "Victoria, did that witch Vivian do this to you?"

At the mention of Vivian's name, Victoria slammed her cuffed hands onto the table, her face twisting with rage. "That conniving snake! Just wait till I'm free—I'll make sure she suffers!"

"How dare she touch you?" Margaret snarled, rolling up her sleeves. "Don't worry, darling. I'll make her pay."

"You're no match for her. She's far more cunning than Evelyn ever was." Victoria's eyes darkened with malice. "No matter what it takes, get Alexander to see me!"

Margaret nodded fervently.

After leaving the station, they immediately tried to track down Alexander—but he was nowhere to be found.

Meanwhile, news of Victoria's attempted murder had exploded across social media, instantly going viral.

Her carefully crafted image of grace and kindness shattered overnight.

The public was outraged—how could a mother harm her own child?

Ethan was an innocent, beautiful boy. What kind of monster would do such a thing?

Especially when Victoria had been shamelessly using him for clout on her social media.

Her Twitter was flooded with furious backlash.

With Victoria in custody, she couldn't even hire bots to defend her.

Back at the station, Victoria waited desperately for Alexander to appear. When an officer finally informed her that a visitor had arrived, she hastily smoothed her hair, her eyes brimming with hope.

But the moment the door opened, her expression twisted into venomous fury.

Vivian stood there, poised and elegant, her heels clicking against the floor as she approached with a mocking smile.

"Vivian Prescott! You—!"

Vivian settled gracefully into the chair across from her, crossing her legs. "Surprised? Did you really think Alexander would waste his time on you?"

"You—!"

"Even if he had the time, he wouldn't come." Vivian's smile widened. "He has better things to do."

Victoria, shackled and disheveled, looked like a shadow of her former self. Even her once-imposing aura had crumbled.

"Vivian Prescott, you viper! Why are you so hell-bent on destroying me?"

Vivian arched a brow, her grin sharpening. "That's a question you should ask yourself. Why did you keep targeting me, hurting me, and trying to kill me?"
###Chapter 367

Evelyn let out a derisive laugh. "What absolute nonsense! When did I ever do any of those things to you? You're the one throwing yourself at Alexander with that face of yours. Every single accusation you're making is your own doing. So if I decide to make you suffer later, you've got no one to blame but yourself."

"Myself to blame?"

"You dug your own grave, you vile creature! You're just as worthless as that bitch Evelyn. The world wouldn't miss either of you!"

Before Victoria could finish her venomous tirade, Evelyn's palm connected sharply with her cheek.

Victoria stood frozen for two heartbeats. As she opened her mouth to spew more hatred, Evelyn seized her collar, cutting off her air supply.

Victoria's gaze locked with Evelyn's piercing eyes - those glacial orbs flashing with deadly intent. A shiver ran down Victoria's spine.

"I dug my own grave? My death wouldn't be regretted? After everything, you still dare spout such inhuman words?" Evelyn's voice was arctic, her stare sharper than any blade.

"Six years ago, you drugged Alexander and framed me for crimes I never committed. You made everyone believe I was some desperate woman throwing myself at him."

"With your fabricated stories and carefully constructed traps, you got me wrongfully imprisoned for three years. Over a thousand days of torture from the people you hired. You even forced labor on my unborn child! I never even got to hold my baby before you and your adulterous lover murdered her!"

"And did you really think I wouldn't discover you killed my grandfather?"

Evelyn tightened her grip on Victoria's collar. Her crimson eyes burned with fury, each glare like a dagger stabbing into Victoria's frozen form.

"Every ounce of my suffering came from you and Alexander. And you have the audacity to say I brought it upon myself?"

With a contemptuous sneer, Evelyn released her grip. "Victoria, the only one who's dug their grave here is you. This ending? You crafted it yourself."

Silence engulfed the bridal suite.

Victoria stood speechless, her face cycling through emotions like a broken neon sign before settling into ashen pallor.

"This can't be... Evelyn's dead. I disfigured her myself. That skin couldn't have healed so perfectly. Impossible..." Victoria muttered, refusing to accept the poised, powerful woman before her.

Yet those unmistakable fiery eyes left no room for denial.

"You... E-Evelyn... Is it really you?"

Evelyn's lips curled into a predatory smile as she lifted her chin. "Indeed. I'm your dear sister Evelyn Sinclair. The one whose marriage you ruined, whose husband you stole, whose grandfather and child you murdered."

Victoria's body convulsed, her eyes widening in fresh horror.

The reality that Evelyn had survived was inconceivable. Worse still - not only was Evelyn breathtakingly beautiful, but she'd returned wealthy, successful, with her own empire!

Victoria would never measure up.

Now she understood why "Vivian" had been circling her and Alexander. This was no coincidence - it was vengeance.

"Don't get cocky, Evelyn! Who do you think you are? So you survived - big deal! If I killed you once, I can do it again!" Victoria screeched, her crimson eyes wild with desperation.

Evelyn merely smirked. "Yet here I stand. Which means you lack the power to finish what you started."

"Y-You..." Victoria trembled with rage. "Evelyn, do you really think this little act will destroy me? When Alexander discovers you're the woman he despises most, he'll never forgive you!"
###Chapter 368

"Go ahead and tell him then." Evelyn smirked, her crimson lips curling with amusement. "Do you honestly think he'll believe you over me?"

"..." Victoria's eyes darkened, the fight draining from her expression.

She couldn't - no, she would never dare reveal the truth to Alexander!

If Alexander discovered Vivian was actually Evelyn, not only would he believe her instantly, he'd be overjoyed. He'd move heaven and earth to spoil her, cherish her, worship her.

Alexander had always loved Evelyn, especially after her 'death'. That love had festered in his heart, twisted by regret and longing.

Seeing Victoria's silence, Evelyn's smile widened. "Or perhaps you could tell your dear parents. Let them know I'm Evelyn Sinclair. But do you have the courage for that?"

"..." Victoria's mouth twitched. The hatred in her gaze could have melted steel, yet she remained powerless.

More importantly, she could never reveal Vivian's true identity to Eleanor and William.

Victoria hadn't forgotten - three years ago, Evelyn already knew she was the real Montgomery heiress.

Thud!

While Victoria was lost in thought, Evelyn tossed a smartphone onto the table between them.

"Seen the news? The entire internet is buzzing about your scandalous past. Alexander even made an official statement on his Blackwood Enterprises account - your marriage was never legal. No certificate, no vows. You were never his wife. Doesn't seem like he loved you much after all."

"Evelyn, you vicious bitch!" Victoria lunged forward, but the restraints held her back.

Evelyn retrieved her phone with effortless grace, rising elegantly. "Scream all you want. I'm not Evelyn Sinclair anymore."

She leaned forward, ten perfectly manicured fingers pressing into the table. The sheer intensity of her presence made Victoria shrink back.

"Victoria, your nightmare is just beginning. The first step of your downfall? That guilty verdict coming your way."

"..."

With one last taunting smile, Evelyn turned on her heel.

"Evelyn! What do you want? What the hell are you planning?"

The shrill screams behind her sounded like a dying animal's last cries.

Evelyn glanced over her shoulder, the sunlight catching her flawless profile. "Payback. For everything you did to me. Only this time... it'll hurt twice as much."

She strode away, leaving Victoria trembling in her wake.

"It's really you..." Victoria whispered, her face ghostly pale. "Evelyn..."

Stepping outside the detention center, Evelyn inhaled the crisp post-rain air. For six years, she'd carried this weight of pain and vengeance. Today, she'd finally begun to unburden herself.

Grandfather Henry, your little girl will make them pay.

My sweet Amelia, Mommy will punish everyone who hurt you.

And Alexander... you're next.

Just as she moved to leave, a familiar silver sports car screeched to a halt before her.

The door opened, revealing a tall, imposing figure stepping into the sunlight.

Evelyn's lips curved. Speak of the devil.

Alexander Blackwood, your reckoning has come.
###Chapter 369

Evelyn offered him a faint smile. "Alexander, are you here to see Victoria? Still clinging to her memory?"

Alexander stepped closer, his mesmerizing gaze locking with her exquisite eyes. "The only one I can't let go of now is you."

"Truly?" Evelyn searched his eyes, feigning surprise. "If that's the case, I'm overjoyed."

"Every word is true." Alexander extended his hand. "If you'll have me, I'll devote myself to you from this day forward."

Evelyn studied his outstretched hand—those long, elegant fingers she'd once yearned to hold. The memory of their warmth haunted her.

When she remained silent, a flicker of unease crossed his chiseled features. "Do you refuse?"

Her lips curved into a knowing smile as she placed her hand in his. "Why wouldn't I accept? I've waited an eternity for this moment."

'An eternity indeed.'

Alexander escorted Evelyn back to Blackwood Estate.

Seeing Ethan at the dining table brought an unexpected wave of relief.

She approached the boy. "Ethan."

The child's crystalline eyes brightened instantly. "Vivian."

"Thank you for being so brave during the testimony." Evelyn ruffled his hair, her heart aching at his rosy cheeks.

Victoria had borne this perfect child yet showed him no affection, while Evelyn's maternal instincts surged.

"Vivian, you must stay safe." Ethan's solemn tone surprised her as he produced a crystal bracelet from his pocket.

Evelyn's eyes widened. "I thought this was lost forever."

Perhaps moved by her joy, the boy flashed his first genuine smile in months, revealing tiny canines.

"Let me put it on you," he offered, small fingers grasping her wrist.

"Of course." Evelyn raised her hand obediently.

Her gaze softened as she watched Ethan's concentration. Those thick lashes fluttered against his cheeks, unbearably endearing.

She couldn't resist caressing his face. "Ethan, if I ever upset your father, will you hate me?"

The bracelet clicked into place as she spoke.

The boy looked up, mischief sparkling in his enormous eyes.

Before he could respond, Alexander interrupted. "Ethan, do you care for Vivian? Would you accept her as your mother?"

Evelyn froze—until Ethan nodded. "Yes, Mommy."

That single word—'Mommy'—poured over her heart like warm honey.

She'd always adored this child, but never imagined he'd return her affection so completely.

Perhaps Victoria's neglect had made him crave the love Evelyn so freely gave.

—

Victoria faced immediate charges, with a court date already set.

Though the verdict remained pending, her reputation lay in ruins, dragging Montgomery Enterprises' stock prices down with it.

In her office, Evelyn scanned the financial reports, brow furrowed.

She knew the company would suffer another blow when Victoria's conviction became official.
###Chapter 370

Victoria Lancaster was the darling of the Montgomery family, a name everyone recognized instantly.

When Vivian Prescott saw the viral photos of Eleanor Kingsley and William Montgomery being harassed by paparazzi, a sharp pang shot through her chest.

"Father... Mother..." she whispered. Then her thoughts drifted to Ethan.

"I'm just like you. Neither of us ever knew a mother's love..."

Knock. Knock. Knock.

The urgent rapping came from her office door.

Vivian lifted her gaze to see the sales director standing there, visibly distressed.

"Enter." Vivian gestured. "What's happened? You look frantic."

The woman rushed in, breathless. "Miss Prescott! There's a couple downstairs causing a scene. They're demanding to confront you directly. They're calling you... a homewrecker. They're threatening to vandalize the store if you don't come down immediately!"

Vivian rose smoothly. "Stay calm. I'll handle this."

She slipped on her tailored blazer, her stilettos clicking decisively against the marble stairs.

From the landing, Vivian could already hear the shrill voice echoing through the boutique. "Vivian Prescott! You shameless homewrecker! Show your face!"

"You vile seductress! You stole my daughter's husband and framed her for crimes! Do you think we'll let you destroy Victoria's life without consequences?"

"Vivian Prescott! Come out now!"

"I'm right here."

All heads turned as Vivian descended the final steps with regal composure.

Customers, staff, and curious onlookers gaped at the striking woman in the white power suit. Her beauty was undeniable, but more arresting was the commanding aura radiating from her.

Margaret and Richard Dawson froze momentarily. Though this woman bore Evelyn Sinclair's face, there was something undeniably more formidable about Vivian Prescott.

"Are you the ones calling me a homewrecker while threatening my business?" Vivian's voice cut through the tension like ice.

Their insults confirmed they hadn't yet realized Vivian was Evelyn. Clearly, they hadn't visited Victoria in detention.

"It's us!" Margaret spat, rolling up her sleeves aggressively. "I'm standing up for my daughter, Victoria Lancaster!"

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. These couldn't be the refined Montgomerys. These vulgar people must be Victoria's adoptive parents.

Margaret seized the moment. "Good people, listen! Those internet rumors about my daughter are lies! This scheming seductress framed poor Victoria!"

Richard nodded vehemently. "My wife speaks truth! This woman is the real criminal here!"

"You all know Alexander Blackwood, yes? The Blackwood Enterprises CEO? He loved my daughter until this harlot came along!" Margaret's voice grew shriller, spittle flying.

"To steal Alexander, this witch had my daughter assaulted by thugs! Now Victoria rots in jail because of her! Tell me - doesn't this homewrecker deserve worse than shouting?"

Margaret wiped crocodile tears as the crowd murmured. Emboldened, she pressed on.

"People of Willowbrook! Join us in denouncing this villain today!"

Richard pointed accusingly. "With so many witnesses, Vivian Prescott, how will you explain yourself?"

Vivian let their tirade wash over her. Then she lifted her chin, eyes flashing dangerously.

"Finished? Then it's my turn to speak."
###Chapter 371

Evelyn's piercing gaze made Margaret and Richard recoil in shock.

"Vivian, what nonsense are you spouting now?" Margaret sneered, trying to regain her composure. "Do you honestly believe anyone here is foolish enough to fall for your lies?"

A cold smile curved Evelyn's lips. "If everyone here is so intelligent, then how do you expect them to believe your baseless accusations without proof?"

Margaret froze. Her own words had come back to haunt her.

"Vivian, you—"

"Silence!" Evelyn's command cut through the air like a whip.

Margaret trembled, the ice in Evelyn's stare sending chills down her spine.

"You claim to seek justice for your precious Victoria, but tell me—does that murderous wretch even deserve justice?"

"How dare you—"

"You accuse me of framing Victoria, of orchestrating her assault by those thugs. Where's your evidence? I have mine."

Margaret paled, her guilty conscience making her avert her eyes.

They both knew the truth. Everyone at Henry Blackwood's birthday gala had witnessed it firsthand.

"Shall I play that humiliating footage of you begging on your knees for me not to call the police?"

Margaret's face turned from red to purple with shame.

Evelyn's laugh was sharp. "You and Victoria conspired to have me kidnapped. When she refused to pay them, they turned on her. She reaped what she sowed, and you were her accomplice. How dare you stand here twisting the truth? Should I call the authorities right now to settle this matter properly?"

Margaret's lips twitched. Panic flashed across her features.

"Victoria sits in a detention cell because there's irrefutable evidence of her attempted murder," Evelyn continued calmly. "The law will punish a woman who could harm her own child."

Evelyn's knowing smirk pushed Margaret to the brink of hysteria.

"You're not here for justice. You're here to cement Victoria's crimes. No wonder she turned out this way—with a mother like you."

"Lies!" Margaret sputtered, finger shaking as she pointed at Evelyn. "Don't listen to this scheming harlot! My Victoria was framed!"

"Alexander has publicly stated he and Victoria were never involved. Our relationship is perfectly legitimate—none of your concern," Evelyn countered smoothly.

"Whereas your precious daughter inserted herself between Evelyn Sinclair and Alexander's marriage. Who's the real homewrecker here?"

Margaret gaped like a fish out of water.

Regret flooded her. Victoria had warned her about crossing Vivian, but she'd insisted. Now she'd walked straight into a trap.

"What a vile old crone! Does she think we're blind to the truth?"

"Victoria's always been fake—her social media is pure performance. Thank goodness my idol Alexander never married her!"

"I lost all respect when she broke up Evelyn's marriage. How does someone like her have fans?"

"And to think she's the Montgomerys' daughter! Such upstanding philanthropists, their reputation destroyed by that witch!"

As the crowd's jeers rained down, Margaret realized they were all directed at her, not Vivian.

She'd made a complete fool of herself!

Face burning, Margaret shoved through the crowd and fled.

Richard, ever the spineless coward who only bullied the weak, scurried after his wife.

The air instantly felt cleaner with them gone.
###Chapter 372

A sly smile curled on Vivian's lips. "My apologies for the unpleasant shopping experience. As compensation, I'm offering a 20% discount on all jewelry in the boutique today."

The customers exchanged delighted glances. Naturally, they favored Vivian's generous gesture over the earlier disturbance.

After smoothly handling the customers, Vivian grabbed her designer handbag and headed toward the parking garage.

Her luxury sedan glided through the familiar streets of Willowbrook until she reached her destination.

Ten minutes of patient waiting paid off when Margaret and Richard came into view, muttering curses under their breath.

Vivian's lips twisted into a predatory smile as she pressed the accelerator.

The sudden roar of an engine made Richard and Margaret look up in alarm. A white sports car was barreling toward them at terrifying speed.

Their blood ran cold as the vehicle closed the distance impossibly fast.

Panic seized them. They scrambled backward, but it was too late - the car would hit them in mere seconds.

"Help!" Margaret shrieked, collapsing to the pavement.

With a screech of tires, the car halted just inches from their trembling forms.

As they gasped for breath, the car door swung open. Margaret immediately launched into a tirade. "Are you insane? You could've killed us! Do you know who you're dealing with? My son-in-law is—"

"I know exactly who you are," Vivian's icy voice cut through Margaret's rant.

The color drained from their faces. "V-Vivian?"

Slamming the car door shut, Vivian strode toward them with lethal grace. "You humiliated me in my own store. Did you really think there wouldn't be consequences?"

Margaret's eyes darted nervously. She struggled to her feet, puffing out her chest. "This is our neighborhood, Vivian Prescott! You can't—"

Richard blustered, "Watch your tone with us!"

Vivian's smile turned glacial. "Would you prefer to join your precious Victoria in prison? Or should I arrange for her sentence to be extended?"

Their bravado evaporated instantly.

Margaret's expression transformed into sickening sweetness. "Miss Prescott, you're far too gracious to hold grudges against simple folks like us. We were wrong to trouble you. Please forgive our foolishness."

She even performed an exaggerated bow.

"Miss Prescott, our humble home is just ahead. Perhaps we could discuss this more comfortably inside?"

Vivian nodded approvingly. "Now that's more like it."

Margaret shot Richard a meaningful look as she led the way.

Vivian quickly checked her phone before following.

The house had undergone lavish renovations - clear evidence of Victoria's ill-gotten gains from the Blackwoods.

Seated in the parlor, Vivian watched as the couple disappeared into the kitchen to "prepare tea."

Behind closed doors, Margaret's facade crumbled. With shaking hands, she poured a lethal dose of pesticide into the teacup.

"That arrogant bitch," she hissed. "She'll never speak against us again."

Stirring the poisoned tea with a silver spoon, Margaret pasted on a saccharine smile as she presented it to Vivian. "Our special family blend, Miss Prescott. Quite unique, if I may say so."

Vivian accepted the cup gracefully. She inhaled the aroma with apparent appreciation. "It does smell... distinctive. I must savor this properly."

She raised the cup slowly, bringing it to her lips as Margaret watched with bated breath.
###Chapter 373

Alexander and Margaret froze when Evelyn raised the teacup to her lips. Their eyes burned with anticipation as they waited for her to take that fateful sip.

The porcelain rim touched Evelyn's mouth, but suddenly her gaze snapped up. A dangerous glint flashed in her stormy gray eyes.

The couple recoiled in shock. Before they could react, Evelyn's arm whipped forward, sending scalding tea splashing across their faces.

Though not boiling, the liquid still burned at nearly 160 degrees.

Margaret and Richard howled in agony, their skin turning an angry scarlet.

"You! Vivian, have you lost your mind?" Margaret screeched, dabbing at her blistering face with trembling hands. Her features twisted into something monstrous.

"Do you take me for a fool?" Evelyn's voice dripped with ice. "Did you really think I wouldn't notice your little 'addition' to my tea?" She hurled the cup at their feet.

The delicate china shattered like their fragile scheme. The couple scrambled back from the razor-sharp shards.

In mere seconds, they'd been assaulted by boiling liquid and nearly impaled by porcelain. It took them precious moments to regain their bearings.

When they finally looked up, Evelyn loomed over them like an avenging angel. "Well? How does your special brew taste?"

Margaret's face contorted with rage as realization dawned. "Darling, lock the door!" she shrieked.

Richard lunged for the exit, slamming it shut.

Margaret bared her teeth like a rabid animal. "How dare you attack us in our own home? Vivian, you'll regret this!"

Her hand flew toward Evelyn's face with vicious intent.

Evelyn caught the wrist mid-air, her grip like steel. "The day I opened my eyes again," she hissed, "I swore no one would ever lay hands on me without consequence."

She flung Margaret away with terrifying ease.

Margaret stumbled backward, crashing onto the sofa before rolling onto the broken porcelain. Blood bloomed across her designer dress as she screamed at Richard. "Kill this bitch! I want her dead!"

Richard charged like a bull, his face purple with rage.

Evelyn moved with lethal grace. Using the self-defense techniques Sebastian had taught her, she flipped Richard effortlessly, sending him crashing onto his wife.

"Ahhh!" Margaret's scream pierced the air as glass shards embedded in her flesh.

Humiliated, Richard scrambled for a weapon. As he pushed himself up, a stiletto heel crushed his hand against the floor.

He looked up into Evelyn's arctic gaze. She stood over him like a queen surveying her prey.

"Does it hurt?" she purred. "But this is nothing compared to the pain of you grinding my fingers beneath your shoe."

Richard paled. "W-what are you talking about? I never—"

"No?" Evelyn's laugh sent chills down their spines. "Has your memory failed so soon? Let me refresh it."

Her hand flashed out. The crack of her slap echoed through the room as red fingerprints bloomed on Richard's cheek.

Margaret gasped. "How dare you strike my husband!"

Evelyn's smile turned glacial. "Why not? Did you ask permission before your countless beatings? Before you left me bleeding on the floor?"

The color drained from their faces.

Silence swallowed the room, broken only by their ragged breathing. Then Margaret's finger trembled as she pointed at Evelyn. "W-what did you just say?"

Evelyn tilted her head. "Are your ears as useless as your conscience?"
###Chapter 374

Evelyn Sinclair gazed down at the petrified faces below her. Her emerald eyes narrowed into slits, venom dripping from every word.

"I considered you family. I donated my bone marrow to save Victoria's life without hesitation. And how did you repay me?" Her voice cracked like ice. "I never asked for gratitude, but I certainly didn't expect betrayal!"

The silence was deafening.

"I've never harmed a soul. Yet all of you conspired to destroy me over and over!"

Her fingers curled into fists. "Remember how you kicked me when I was already bleeding? Left me choking on my own blood in that storm?"

Margaret Dawson's jaw dropped as realization dawned. "You—you're not Vivian Prescott! You're Evelyn Sinclair!"

A cruel smile played on Evelyn's lips. "The very same Evelyn you tried to murder."

Thunder might as well have struck the room. Richard Montgomery's hands trembled violently.

"You're supposed to be dead!"

Evelyn's laugh was bitter. "Why would I die when my tormentors still breathe?"

Margaret's face twisted with rage. "You venomous snake! Victoria has Alexander and the Blackwoods protecting her! If you dare—"

"Still delusional, I see." Evelyn cut her off with a mocking tilt of her head. "Do you truly believe Alexander would lift a finger for your precious daughter now? As for the Blackwoods...we both know who the real heiress is."

Margaret sputtered, searching for words that wouldn't come.

She shoved Richard violently. "Don't just stand there! Deal with her!"

Richard scrambled for a kitchen knife, his movements frantic.

"You'll regret coming back, Evelyn! We should've finished the job last time!" Margaret hissed, launching herself forward despite her injuries.

Evelyn sidestepped gracefully. The distant roar of an engine signaled her cue.

She stood perfectly still. Richard took it as fear, pressing the blade to her throat.

"Don't move!"

CRASH!

The door exploded inward. Alexander Blackwood took in the scene with glacial fury.

Evelyn let her mask slip for just a moment—lips trembling, eyes wide with manufactured terror. "Alexander! They're trying to kill me!"

"Goddamn it." The words were a death sentence.

Richard froze under that arctic stare. Before he could blink, Alexander's boot connected with his ribs, sending him flying.

Strong arms enveloped Evelyn. "Are you hurt?" Alexander's voice was rough with concern.

The fallen knife found Margaret's thigh instead.

"AGH!" Her scream pierced the air. Through pain-blurred vision, she saw Alexander cradling Evelyn like something precious. "Alexander, don't be fooled! That's not Vivian—it's Evelyn Sinclair!"
###Chapter 375

"Alexander, I swear it's true! That witch is Evelyn!" Margaret pointed an accusing finger at Vivian, her voice trembling with rage.

Richard joined in, his face contorted with fury. "She's the one you despise most - Evelyn Sinclair hiding behind this Vivian Prescott facade!"

"Enough!" Alexander's voice cut through the air like ice. His piercing gaze could have frozen hell itself. "How dare you attack Vivian to avenge Victoria? You'll pay dearly for this."

The chilling threat made Margaret and Richard recoil as if doused in arctic water. Their blood ran cold.

"Vivian, let me take you home." Alexander's tone transformed instantly, warming like spring sunshine after winter's frost.

Vivian pressed herself against Alexander's chest, her wide doe eyes glistening. "Alexander, I was so terrified. I thought they might kill me right there."

"You lying snake! Stop this charade!" Margaret shrieked, her face flushing crimson. "Alexander, she admitted it herself moments ago!"

"Alexander, I never said such things," Vivian murmured softly, all traces of her earlier defiance vanished. "They want to silence me because I'm the key witness against Victoria."

Margaret nearly choked on her fury. "Evelyn, you-"

Before she could continue, Alexander gently guided Vivian away. Over his shoulder, Vivian flashed them a triumphant smirk that promised retribution.

The car ride to Blackwood Estate passed in silence. Vivian had obtained her driver's license during her years abroad, but Alexander didn't need to know she'd driven herself to the confrontation. Her carefully timed distress message had brought him running right on cue.

Back at the estate, Vivian clung to Alexander like a frightened bird. "I'm still shaking. Do they hate me because I resemble your ex-wife?"

"No one will harm you while I'm here," Alexander murmured, his arms tightening around her.

Feeling his protective embrace, Vivian discreetly checked Sebastian's message. A satisfied smile played on her lips. "Alexander... would you stay with me a while longer? I don't feel safe yet."

"Of course," he agreed without hesitation.

Meanwhile, Margaret and Richard tended to their wounds before visiting Victoria at the detention center. They recounted every detail, expecting shock, but Victoria merely clenched her fists.

"That cunning fox set this entire trap!" she spat, eyes blazing. "She planned every move to destroy me!"

Margaret rubbed her bruised backside. "Who could imagine Evelyn surviving and returning like this? Now Alexander trusts her completely while you're trapped here. What do we do?"

Victoria's nails dug into her palms. "He's blinded by that face!" She fixed her parents with a steely gaze. "Never reveal Vivian's true identity. Our lives depend on it."

The silent exchange between Margaret and Richard spoke volumes. The game had changed, and the stakes had never been higher.
###Chapter 376

"Have you told Alexander that the woman is Evelyn?"

"N-No! Besides, it seems she doesn't want him to know she's Evelyn." Margaret denied it quickly, realizing this was information Alexander must never discover.

Victoria exhaled in relief.

"There's a hearing in two days. Eleanor has already hired the best attorney for me. I should be released soon."

Margaret's eyes brightened. "Really?"

"Of course." Victoria scoffed. "It seems Evelyn doesn't plan to reveal her true identity to the Montgomerys."

Richard and Margaret exchanged confused glances. "Vic, doesn't that woman already know she's Eleanor's daughter? If she's exposed herself to us, why won't she acknowledge William and Eleanor as her parents?"

"If you were in her place, would you still want to return to parents who attacked, berated, and ignored you?" Victoria rolled her eyes.

"I think she resents them."

Richard and Margaret nodded, finding Victoria's reasoning sound.

Just then, the door to the visitation room swung open. Two officers entered.

Richard and Margaret assumed their time was up, but instead, the officers moved toward them with handcuffs.

All three froze. "Officer, w-why are you arresting us?"

"Mr. Blackwood just filed a report. You two are suspects in an attempted murder case."

"..."

"..."

Margaret and Richard stood stunned for several seconds before recalling what had happened earlier.

"Officer, we didn't do it! We were framed!"

"Vic, you have to get Eleanor to help us! Vic!"

Victoria could only watch as Margaret and Richard were led away. A moment later, an officer escorted her out as well.

She couldn't fathom the depth of Alexander's feelings for Evelyn. Even without knowing Vivian was Evelyn, he still protected her—all because of that face.

The jealousy burned through her.

"Evelyn!" She spat the name through clenched teeth, wishing she could crush her into dust.

When Evelyn learned Margaret and Richard had been detained, satisfaction curled in her chest.

She went to the station to give her statement, confirming their intent to harm her. After signing the documents, she turned to leave—only to collide with Eleanor at the entrance.

The last time they'd met here, Eleanor had been hostile. Now, though still elegant and poised, she looked exhausted, dark circles shadowing her eyes.

Evelyn turned away silently, avoiding unnecessary conflict. But before she could take another step, Eleanor called out in a tone so gentle it startled her.

"Miss Prescott."

Evelyn's heart stuttered. She hadn't expected such softness from Eleanor.

She paused, then turned with a carefully neutral smile. "Can I help you, Mrs. Kingsley?"
###Chapter 377

Eleanor Kingsley approached Evelyn Sinclair with measured steps, her lips curling into a practiced smile. "Would you do me the honor of dining at Kingsley Manor this evening?"

Evelyn's brows knitted together. "Am I hearing correctly? You're inviting me to your home, Mrs. Kingsley?"

'Does she suspect something?'

'Is this forced hospitality because of Victoria?'

Yet Evelyn immediately detected the barely concealed reluctance in Eleanor's eyes.

The realization struck her like lightning. This invitation was solely for Victoria's sake.

Pathetic.

'My own flesh and blood would debase herself for that venomous impostor.'

"Miss Prescott, I hope you'll forgive my past transgressions. This invitation comes from the heart." Eleanor maintained her plastic smile while awaiting Evelyn's response.

The irony tasted bitter on Evelyn's tongue. Every fiber of her being screamed to refuse.

But she couldn't.

The woman before her was her biological mother - no matter how much she despised her, no matter how blind she was to her true daughter's existence.

"Very well," Evelyn acquiesced. When Eleanor's face lit up with unrestrained relief, a hollow laugh echoed through Evelyn's soul.

As Evelyn departed, Eleanor hurried into the police station to visit Victoria in her holding cell.

Victoria's pulse spiked when she learned of Eleanor's dinner invitation to Evelyn.

What game was Evelyn playing now? The simpleton she'd once manipulated had become dangerously unpredictable.

Yet Victoria resolved to strike first. "Mother, I know you're doing this for me, but I'd rather die in prison than watch you and Father grovel before Prescott!"

Victoria clutched Eleanor's hand with theatrical desperation, tears glistening like poisoned diamonds.

"That woman is pure evil. She'll turn on you both the moment she gets the chance!"

Eleanor's heart swelled at these 'selfless' warnings.

She stroked Victoria's greasy hair, her chest tightening at the girl's haggard appearance.

"Vicky, darling, don't fret. We know what we're doing. We'll get you out of here, no matter the cost."

"Mother—"

Victoria sobbed with affected gratitude while violently shaking her head.

"I can't bear the thought of you sacrificing everything! Prescott has already framed me and imprisoned my adoptive parents. She keeps hinting I'm not your real daughter—"

"Enough!" Eleanor cut her off firmly. "That birthmark and DNA test proved everything. I won't be fooled by Vivian Prescott's lies."

Victoria exhaled imperceptibly. Exactly the reassurance she'd been fishing for.

—

Despite her misgivings, Eleanor instructed the staff to prepare an elaborate feast.

At twilight, Alexander Blackwood's luxury sedan pulled up to Kingsley Manor's wrought iron gates.

From the shadows, housekeeper Beatrice Caldwell watched Evelyn with venomous eyes.

'Murderous wretch.'

'You took my Sophia from me.'

'Tonight you'll pay with your life.'

"Alexander, I'll go in now." Evelyn flashed him a small wave.

The man's gaze warmed as he nodded. "I'll return for you at ten."
###Chapter 378

"Alright."

Evelyn's lips curved into a soft smile. She watched Alexander's car disappear down the tree-lined driveway before turning toward the imposing Montgomery Manor.

Though she'd visited before, tonight felt different.

Last time, she'd arrived dressed to impress, determined to outshine Victoria. Tonight, she wore simple elegance—no pretense, just herself.

The moment she stepped inside, whispers erupted among the staff.

Even in casual attire, Vivian Prescott carried an undeniable grace that commanded attention.

They recognized her as Lady Belle's renowned designer—the same woman recently entangled with Miss Montgomery's scandals.

Yet here she was, announced as the Kingsleys' honored guest. The maids exchanged puzzled glances.

Eleanor and William rose to greet her in the grand foyer. Their relaxed outfits still screamed luxury, every stitch and gemstone carefully curated.

"Please, have a seat, Miss Prescott," Eleanor gestured gracefully.

"Thank you." Evelyn settled onto the velvet settee, her gaze briefly skimming the lavish spread before them. The aroma of truffles and aged wine did nothing to stir her appetite.

William uncorked a six-figure Bordeaux, pouring the crimson liquid into crystal.

"We're delighted you could join us tonight," he said smoothly. "We hope you'll forgive our... past misunderstandings."

Forgiveness.

Evelyn's fingers traced the stem of her glass. Such an easy word to say, yet heavier than stone to truly grant.

When she remained silent, Eleanor shot William a nervous glance. He squeezed her hand reassuringly before continuing.

"Your reputation in jewelry design precedes you. Eleanor here shares your passion. Our company is launching a major project—we'd value your expertise. Name your price."

Ah. The bait. All for darling Victoria's sake.

Evelyn's laugh was light as champagne bubbles. "Money means little to me now. Soon I'll be Mrs. Blackwood—prestige comes with the title."

The Kingsleys stiffened.

Setting her untouched wine aside, Evelyn wandered toward the sunken living room.

"Would you like a tour?" Eleanor hurried after her.

Evelyn nodded, fingertips brushing the gilded banister. "Such a magnificent home. As a child watching movies, I'd dream of places like this—of parents who'd fill these halls with laughter. What a privilege that must be."

Something in her wistful tone made Eleanor's breath catch.

"You mentioned your parents before," Eleanor ventured cautiously. "I assume they're—"

"Lost me," Evelyn finished, her voice dropping to a whisper. "Just as you once lost your child. Careless parents, distracted at the wrong moment."

The air thickened.

William's grip tightened on his glass. Both Kingsleys found themselves unsettled by the storm in Evelyn's expressive eyes.

"How strange—our daughters share similar histories," Eleanor managed. "Though we were blessed to reunite with our precious girl after all these years." Her smile bloomed at the thought of Victoria.

The knife twisted deeper in Evelyn's chest.

"You've achieved so much," Eleanor pressed. "Surely you've had resources to search. Have you really never found them?"

Evelyn met her gaze squarely.

"Oh, I have."

The silence that followed could have frozen the wine in their glasses.
###Chapter 379

Alexander and Eleanor froze when they heard Vivian's response. Their hearts pounded inexplicably.

"Did you say you've found your parents?" they asked in unison.

Vivian nodded with a faint smile. "Yes. My biological parents."

Eleanor's face lit up with genuine joy upon hearing this confirmation.

"That's wonderful news," she beamed. "You'll finally have your family back."

"Family?" Vivian repeated the word with bitter amusement. "I'll never have that chance."

Eleanor frowned. "Why not?"

"Because they don't recognize me standing right before them. And they refuse to acknowledge me."

Vivian's piercing gaze locked onto Eleanor and William. Their expressions turned to shock.

With a humorless laugh, Vivian broke the tension. "Perhaps I'm just cursed. Lost by my parents as a child, abandoned by my lover as an adult. Though at my lowest point, fate granted me one extraordinary man - a true diamond in the rough."

William and Eleanor exchanged glances. They knew she meant Alexander.

An uncomfortable silence fell until Beatrice emerged with three steaming bowls.

"Madam, Sir, Miss Prescott - please enjoy this special chowder."

Eleanor quickly explained, "Miss Prescott, Beatrice makes the most exquisite seafood chowder in Willowbrook. You must try it."

"Of course." Vivian returned to her seat.

Though she knew this hospitality was meant for Victoria, this rare moment with her parents - however hypocritical - still mattered.

As she lifted the spoon, her keen senses detected something amiss in the broth.

"Miss Prescott? Is something wrong with the chowder?" Eleanor asked when Vivian set down her spoon.

"You should ask Beatrice about that," Vivian said, eyeing the housekeeper.

Beatrice's face paled.

Before Eleanor and William could react, Beatrice brandished a fruit knife from behind her back.

"Eleanor! William!" Vivian shouted as the blade flashed toward her.

To her astonishment, her parents threw themselves between her and the attacker.

"Beatrice! Have you lost your mind?" Eleanor shielded Vivian. "Miss Prescott has done nothing to you!"

"Miss Prescott? This is Evelyn Sinclair!" Beatrice spat. "She murdered Miss Sophia and changed her identity! Today I'll avenge my dear Miss Sophia!"

The housekeeper's eyes burned with hatred, her grip tightening on the knife.

Suddenly Vivian understood - this was the grieving woman she'd seen clutching Sophia's photograph.

"She's not Evelyn! Evelyn died years ago!" Eleanor insisted. "Put the knife down!"

"She is Evelyn!" Beatrice shrieked, lunging again. "Move aside, Madam! Let me punish this murderer!"

Vivian knew she could evade the attack easily. Yet her parents' protective stance stunned her.

For the first time in her life, she felt something she'd never known - parental love.

"Ah!"

"Eleanor!"

William's panicked scream snapped Vivian from her thoughts.

Blood gushed from a deep gash on Eleanor's arm.

"Madam! I never meant to hurt you!" Beatrice cried in horror.

William scooped Eleanor up and raced for the garage.

Vivian followed without hesitation.

As William sped toward the hospital, Vivian tended to Eleanor in the backseat. The sight of her mother's bleeding wound felt like a knife twisting in her own heart.

She stripped off her jacket, pressing it firmly against the wound to stem the crimson flow.
###Chapter 380

"Mrs. Kingsley, stay awake. We're almost at the hospital." Evelyn gripped Eleanor's shoulder tightly, her voice trembling with urgency.

Eleanor's eyelids fluttered weakly, threatening to close. Evelyn kept talking, desperate to keep her conscious.

Her pulse raced, anxiety clawing at her chest. Tears blurred her vision, spilling over her lashes.

"Vic—"

Eleanor's whisper cut through the tension.

Evelyn's heart twisted painfully. This was the worst possible moment.

Then, Eleanor's weak plea came, barely audible.

"You're a mother too, Miss Prescott. Please... understand. The hearing is tomorrow. Let my daughter go. She was wrong, but the fault is ours. We failed to raise her right. Please... have mercy."

Evelyn bit her lip, tears streaming down her face.

"Mrs. Kingsley, she doesn’t deserve your sacrifice."

"She does. She's my only child."

Evelyn swallowed hard. "She isn’t. Not by blood."

Eleanor’s lips curved into a faint, knowing smile. "I knew you’d say that. But she is my daughter. My flesh and blood."

The car screeched to a halt.

William rushed Eleanor into the hospital, his face ashen.

Evelyn’s white blouse was soaked in crimson, her hands sticky with blood. She followed numbly, her mind reeling.

Eleanor was rushed into emergency surgery—too much blood lost, too little time.

In the elevator, Evelyn’s phone buzzed. Alexander.

When he heard where she was, he canceled everything and raced to the hospital.

The sight of her covered in blood sent his heart into a frenzy.

"Vivian!"

He grabbed her shoulders, his grip almost painful.

"I’m fine," she whispered. "It’s Eleanor’s blood."

Alexander exhaled sharply, then noticed William standing nearby.

After a hushed explanation, Alexander’s grip loosened. His pulse steadied, but the fear lingered.

He never wanted to feel that terror again.

The emergency doors burst open. A nurse hurried out, and William intercepted her.

"How is she?"

"The wound is deep. She’s lost too much blood. We don’t have her type in stock—it’s rare. We’ll need to get some from another branch. It’ll take hours."

William paled.

Evelyn stepped forward. "I can donate."

William’s head snapped toward her, stunned.

Alexander’s eyes darkened with realization.

"No time to waste," Evelyn said firmly, already moving.

Alexander and William followed as she was prepped. Within minutes, 500ml of her blood was drawn.

Alexander draped his coat over her shoulders, his touch lingering protectively.

William stared at Evelyn, speechless.

As she turned to leave, a nurse gasped in recognition.

"Oh! It’s you!"

Evelyn frowned. The face was familiar.

"You—?"

"Don’t you remember? Last time Mrs. Kingsley needed blood, her daughter refused. You saved her then, too."

The memory rushed back.

Before Evelyn could respond, the nurse turned to Alexander.

"Mr. Blackwood, three years ago, when your son was injured—the woman who donated blood for him? It was her. I never forgot her face."

Alexander froze.

Evelyn’s breath caught.

The past had just collided with the present.
###Chapter 381

The nurse's revelation hung heavily in the air like thick fog.

Evelyn offered a serene smile. "You must be referring to Evelyn Sinclair."

"It was her—"

William's shocked gasp echoed beside her.

Turning, Evelyn saw remorse painting William's handsome features. His eyes held oceans of regret.

"I never imagined she was the one who saved Eleanor. I even—"

He recalled how he'd accused Evelyn of tormenting Victoria. The memory made him sick.

His cruel words replayed in his mind: "No wonder your parents abandoned you. Someone as vile as you doesn't deserve to live!"

William pressed trembling hands over his eyes.

Evelyn had secretly donated blood for Eleanor and Ethan. She'd endured their accusations without protest.

At this moment, William felt lower than dirt.

Now, even his apologies would go unheard.

Evelyn was gone.

"Are you alright, Mr. Montgomery?" Evelyn's gentle voice pulled him from his thoughts.

William forced a smile, masking his turmoil. "Fine. Thank you for saving my wife, Miss Prescott."

"Saving lives comes naturally to me." Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes. Turning, she noticed Alexander's devastated expression.

His grief ran deeper than William's.

Evelyn's lips twisted bitterly.

She'd never expected gratitude. But she hadn't anticipated such cruelty either.

Their past words still cut like invisible blades, reopening old wounds with each memory.

Eleanor stabilized after receiving Evelyn's blood.

Evelyn exhaled quietly.

Blood ties mattered, despite everything.

William thanked her again. "Miss Prescott, how did you know about my wife's rare blood type?"

Evelyn's fingers toyed with her sleeve. "Willowbrook's gossip columns covered Evelyn Sinclair and Victoria Lancaster extensively. When I heard Victoria had donated to Mrs. Montgomery before, I guessed our blood types matched."

William stiffened.

The nurse's words resurfaced—Victoria had refused to donate. Eleanor survived solely because of Evelyn.

Victoria had lied.

His supposedly kind daughter had fabricated the entire story while slandering Evelyn.

The realization crushed William. He stood frozen as Evelyn excused herself.

Alexander drove Evelyn home. Exhaustion claimed her during the ride.

Dawn light woke her.

She found herself in her old bedroom, wearing familiar pajamas. Her bloodstained clothes were gone.

Evelyn clutched the pajama collar. Thankfully, she'd worn a camisole beneath her blouse. Unless Alexander had deliberately looked, her identifying mole remained hidden.
###Chapter 382

Evelyn rose from the bed and freshened up. Just as she was about to search for Alexander, faint sounds from the balcony caught her attention.

She turned to see the solitary figure standing there. Alexander's tall frame appeared unexpectedly fragile against the morning light. A cigarette dangled between his elegant fingers, its ember pulsing like a dying star.

Hearing her approach, he spun around. His lips curved into a tired smile. "You should be resting."

"I've had enough sleep," Evelyn replied softly. Noticing his unchanged clothes, she frowned. "You didn't sleep at all last night, did you?"

A shadow crossed his face as his dark eyes studied her features. "Sleep has been elusive these past three years."

Evelyn's breath hitched at his confession.

Alexander stubbed out his cigarette and closed the distance between them. The scent of tobacco clung to him like a second skin.

"Vivian," he murmured, "do you think apologies can truly undo past mistakes?"

The question made Evelyn recall last night's events. That nurse had clearly stirred painful memories. Perhaps he was finally seeing the truth about the woman he'd once condemned.

Evelyn reached up to cradle his face. "Alexander, what's troubling you?"

His cold fingers closed around hers. "Promise you won't leave me."

"Why would I?" She gave him a reassuring smile before withdrawing her hand. "You should rest. We have Victoria's hearing today."

The moment their contact broke, Alexander's expression darkened.

The courtroom buzzed with anticipation as the hearing commenced at ten sharp.

Victoria was led in wearing standard prison garb. Despite attempts at grooming, her haggard appearance bore little resemblance to the polished socialite she'd once been.

Spotting William in the gallery, Victoria's eyes immediately welled with tears. Her gaze darted about, searching for Eleanor's absent figure. When she found Alexander watching her, her sobs intensified.

Eleanor's hired attorney was proving formidable. The tide seemed to be turning in Victoria's favor when she seized her moment.

"Your Honor!" Victoria cried dramatically. "I've been framed!"

Her eyes locked onto Alexander. "See? I'm innocent! I would never—"

"Conscience?" A cold voice cut through the courtroom. "You lost that long ago."

All heads turned as Evelyn entered with commanding presence. Dressed in a tailored suit, her elegance overshadowed Victoria's disheveled state.

Victoria's nails dug into her palms as she glared at her rival.

Evelyn approached the stand with measured steps. "Your Honor, I'm Vivian Prescott, the victim in this case. I possess irrefutable evidence proving Victoria Lancaster's crimes against me and Ethan Blackwood."
###Chapter 383

Evelyn's heart skipped a beat when Victoria claimed to possess additional evidence.

"Your Honor, don't believe her lies!" Victoria's shrill voice cut through the courtroom. "She's setting me up! I'm completely innocent!"

Her manicured finger trembled as she pointed accusingly at Evelyn. The desperation in her eyes was palpable.

"Defendant Lancaster, control yourself." The judge's gavel struck with finality. "Another outburst and I'll hold you in contempt."

Victoria's mouth snapped shut like a trapdoor. But her restless fingers betrayed her nerves. What damning proof did Evelyn have now?

The courtroom doors creaked open. Two officers escorted Richard Montgomery and Margaret Dawson inside.

Victoria's blood ran cold. Her parents wouldn't... they couldn't...

"Your Honor," Margaret began, avoiding her daughter's gaze. "Our adopted daughter Victoria did conspire to commit these crimes. We discussed the plans in our home."

Richard's testimony followed like a hammer blow. "We tried to stop her, but she wouldn't listen. She claimed Vivian Prescott stole her man and needed to be taught a lesson. Victoria hired thugs to kidnap the child, then decided to eliminate Vivian in a fit of rage."

Victoria's world tilted. "You're lying!" she screamed, nails digging into the wooden railing. "How could you betray me like this?"

Her parents remained stone-faced. "The truth must come out, Victoria," Richard said quietly. "An innocent woman shouldn't suffer for your crimes."

The gavel fell again. "Twelve years imprisonment."

Victoria collapsed against the defense table. "This is a miscarriage of justice! I'll appeal! I swear I'll—"

The marshals were already leading her away. Twelve years? Her mind reeled. By then, Evelyn would have consolidated everything—Alexander, Blackwood Enterprises, society's respect.

Evelyn watched the scene unfold with cold satisfaction.

Twelve years is just the beginning, Victoria. You'll pay for Grandpa Henry and little Amelia too.

As the courtroom emptied, only Alexander remained seated, his broad shoulders hunched in thought.

Evelyn approached. "Regretting your ex-fiancée's fate? Think I was too harsh?"

"She earned every minute of that sentence," Alexander murmured.

"Then why the long face?"

A bitter smile twisted his lips. "If she's guilty, then I'm equally culpable."

Evelyn studied his profile. "Because you failed to control Victoria properly? Let her spiral to this point?"

Alexander finally met her gaze, his stormy eyes filled with unspoken remorse. "I neglected someone, yes. But it wasn't Victoria." He stood abruptly, grasping her hand. "Let's go."

Evelyn puzzled over his cryptic words as they exited. That mysterious woman in the grave again. Who was she really?

Meanwhile, William Montgomery slipped from the courthouse unnoticed, heading straight for the hospital. His footsteps echoed with purpose down the sterile corridors.
###Chapter 384

William returned just as Eleanor’s wounds were being redressed. She rushed forward immediately, desperation in her voice.

“William, tell me—how is Victoria?”

“The evidence was irrefutable. The judge sentenced her to twelve years in prison.”

“No!” Eleanor’s face drained of color, her vision swimming. She swayed, nearly collapsing.

William caught her before she fell. “We did everything possible, Eleanor.”

“And yet it wasn’t enough!” Eleanor sobbed, her voice breaking. “The lawyer swore he could guarantee her freedom! How did it come to this?”

“Vivian Prescott produced final evidence. And Victoria’s adoptive parents—Margaret and Richard—testified against her.”

“Vivian Prescott again!” Eleanor’s eyes burned with fury. “I invited her to dinner, hoping she’d show mercy. And this is how she repays me? She’s ruthless! I should never have stopped Beatrice last night. If only she had—”

“Have you lost your mind?” William’s voice was sharp with disbelief. “Do you even realize who saved your life? Without Vivian’s blood donation, you wouldn’t be standing here!”

Eleanor froze.

Her jaw clenched as she thought of Victoria’s fate. “I never asked for her help. How much blood did she give? I’ll repay every drop!”

“You can return hers. But how will you repay Evelyn’s?” William’s voice was heavy.

Eleanor stared at him, confused. “Evelyn? Why bring up that wretched woman? She deserved worse than death for what she did. What could we possibly owe her?”

William sighed, his expression pained. “Three years ago, during your appendectomy, you lost too much blood. Remember?”

“Victoria and Margaret told me Victoria was the donor. But that was a lie. She refused.”

“What?” Eleanor’s breath hitched. “That’s impossible! If not Victoria, then who?”

“Evelyn.”

Eleanor’s lips parted in shock. The air around her seemed to vanish. “No… that can’t be. After everything, why would she save me?”

“I had the records checked. Evelyn didn’t just save you. She also saved our grandson, Ethan.”

A heavy silence settled between them.

“We’ve been blind for too long, Eleanor. I can’t fathom the depths of Victoria’s deceit. We failed her. Her adoptive parents twisted her completely.”

Eleanor’s hands trembled. “No… it can’t be true…”

But the truth was undeniable. Guilt gnawed at her. Both Evelyn and Vivian had saved her without hesitation, and in return, she had repaid them with cruelty.

William urged her to rest, but Eleanor insisted on seeing Victoria.

Before stepping out of the car, she turned to him. “Aren’t you coming? She’s still our daughter.”

William’s expression darkened. “I’m not ready to face her. She may be our blood, but her actions…”

Eleanor understood. She entered the prison alone.

She still struggled to believe Victoria’s true nature, but she couldn’t deny the evidence. As a mother, she had to confront her.

Inside, the officer informed her that Victoria already had visitors—Margaret and Richard.

Thanks to William’s connections, Eleanor was permitted inside.

But as she reached the visitation room, she heard Victoria’s enraged shouts.

“Are you happy now? You betrayed me! How could you do this?”

Victoria’s eyes were bloodshot, her face twisted in fury. Eleanor had never seen her like this.

Margaret kept her head low. “We had no choice. It was us or you.”

“Then it should have been you!” Victoria slammed her hands on the table.

“Calm down,” Margaret snapped. “Losing your temper won’t help. Just wait—Eleanor and William will get you out.”

Victoria bared her teeth. “Who are my real parents—you or them? After everything I gave you, this is how you repay me? Or did you forget I’m your daughter the moment you got comfortable?”
###Chapter 385

Eleanor's entire body went rigid at Victoria's venomous words.

Her bandaged hand shook violently as she shoved open the visitation room door.

The sudden intrusion made all three occupants jump.

"Mrs. Kingsley!" Margaret sprang up from her seat, panic flashing across her face. "What are you doing here?"

Victoria's initial shock melted into practiced concern. "Mother? What happened to your hand?" Her voice dripped with false sweetness, the earlier malice completely erased.

Eleanor ignored the charade, her gaze boring into Victoria's delicate features. "Those words you just screamed - did you mean them?"

Victoria's eyes widened slightly. She realized Eleanor must have overheard her earlier outburst.

"You misunderstood, Mother. I was just-"

"Don't lie to me!" Eleanor's voice cracked like ice, tears of betrayal welling in her eyes. "You've been deceiving me this whole time! You're not my daughter! How could I have believed such a monstrous lie?"

Margaret interjected desperately, "We never lied, Mrs. Kingsley! The birthmark, the DNA test - they all prove Victoria is your daughter!"

"Birthmark?" Eleanor let out a bitter laugh. "Now I understand why you visited that tattoo parlor last week."

Victoria and Margaret exchanged a loaded glance.

They hadn't anticipated Eleanor knowing about that.

"That wasn't a birthmark - it was ink! You had someone tattoo it on you!" Eleanor's accusation hung in the air.

Both women fell silent.

"And the DNA test was faked too, wasn't it?" Eleanor's voice trembled with rage as Victoria's eyes hardened. "You're a monster, Victoria Lancaster! I defended you, protected you, even helped you against Vivian after all your atrocities! And this is how you repay me?"

"Mrs. Kingsley, please, you're misunderstanding-"

"Enough." Victoria cut Margaret off coldly, her gaze turning predatory as she met Eleanor's eyes. "You're right. I'm not your daughter."

The admission hit Eleanor like a physical blow.

She said it.

Victoria wasn't hers!

"Then Vivian was telling the truth all along." Regret flooded Eleanor as she remembered every cruel word she'd said to Vivian.

Victoria smirked cruelly. "Better start thinking of ways to get me out of here, Eleanor. Unless you want to never see your real daughter again."

Eleanor's breath caught. "You know where Sophia is?"

"Of course. How else would I have gotten that locket?" Victoria rose gracefully. "We're done here. Officer?"

As Victoria moved to leave, Eleanor lunged forward. "Wait! Tell me where my daughter is!"

Victoria tossed a chilling smile over her shoulder. "Get me released first. And if you breathe a word of this to anyone..." Her threat hung in the air.

"Victoria Lancaster! Stop right there!"

But Victoria was already walking away.

Seeing their chance, Margaret and Richard quickly followed. Eleanor chased after them.

William, waiting in the car, saw the trio burst from the jail doors with Eleanor in pursuit. Sensing trouble, he immediately jumped out and ran toward the commotion.
###Chapter 386

Alexander rushed to support a breathless Eleanor with tender concern. "What's wrong, Eleanor?"

Tears welled in Eleanor's bloodshot eyes as she clutched her aching chest. "I just discovered Victoria... She was never our daughter—"

"W-what do you mean?" William's face turned ashen.

A violent shudder ran through William's body as Eleanor recounted the entire revelation.

Together, they confronted Victoria again, but she remained obstinately silent, refusing to speak a word.

Margaret and Richard had seemingly vanished without a trace, leaving no clues behind.

The couple returned to their empty mansion, its vast halls now suffocating with unbearable silence.

Eleanor searched desperately through Victoria's room, finding only the gold pendant she'd commissioned years ago for their newborn.

The engraved name 'Sophia' remained clearly visible on the delicate jewelry.

The cheerful afternoon sunlight mocked the storm raging in Eleanor and William's hearts.

Eleanor's chest constricted painfully as tears cascaded down her cheeks in an unstoppable torrent.

Not even William's comforting embrace could stem her flood of sorrow.

Though equally devastated, William felt an unexpected glimmer of relief beneath his grief.

Relief that such a wicked woman wasn't truly their child. Relief that their real daughter still lived.

A sharp knock interrupted their anguish. "Sir, Madam," announced a maid. "Mr. Blackwood and Ms. Prescott have arrived."

Eleanor's head snapped up, her eyes burning with desperate hope. "Perhaps Vivian knows something."

She hastily wiped her tears and rushed downstairs, ignoring the sharp pain in her injured hand.

Vivian and Alexander entered the grand foyer to witness Eleanor's uncharacteristically disheveled descent, with William close behind.

What could possibly have happened?

Vivian exchanged a puzzled glance with Alexander before offering a polite smile. "We heard you'd been discharged, Mrs. Kingsley. Alexander and I came to check on you."

Eleanor immediately composed herself, smoothing her dress with practiced grace. "William told me you were my blood donor, Ms. Prescott. Thank you for saving my life."

Her gaze dropped in shame as she continued with startling candor.

"Yet I accused you of harassing Victoria and foolishly claimed I didn't need your blood."

Vivian's eyes widened at this unexpected confession.

Eleanor approached them with a fragile smile. "Please, Ms. Prescott, have a seat. I owe you an apology for yesterday's incident. I promise it won't happen again."

Vivian glanced at Alexander with quiet amusement. "With Alexander here, I doubt any danger could reach me."

As she settled onto the sofa, her sharp eyes immediately noticed the gold pendant in Eleanor's trembling hands.

One glance was all Vivian needed to recognize the heirloom—the same pendant her grandfather Henry had given her, bearing her birth name.

Her gaze traveled upward to Eleanor's exhausted face. The older woman's complexion looked sallow, her eyes swollen from recent tears.

Probably worried about Victoria, Vivian thought cynically.

"You seem upset about Victoria's situation, Mrs. Kingsley," Vivian remarked coolly. "Regardless of your opinion of me, I don't regret my actions. I'd do it all again without hesitation. Victoria earned every bit of her punishment."

To Vivian's shock, Eleanor let out a broken, self-deprecating laugh, fresh tears spilling over.

When Eleanor finally met her gaze, the raw anguish in those eyes stunned Vivian into silence. "I'm so sorry, Ms. Prescott. I was a fool to doubt you when you were only speaking the truth. Victoria... she truly isn't my daughter."
###Chapter 387

Evelyn's gaze sharpened with intrigue as she studied Eleanor, whose tear-stained face reflected pure devastation. "What do you mean, Mrs. Kingsley?"

"Victoria confessed everything to us," William sighed, his forehead creasing with tension. "I can't believe she's been impersonating our daughter all these years."

Evelyn felt a wave of confusion crash over her.

Why would Victoria voluntarily admit she wasn't the true Montgomery heiress?

Such a confession offered her no advantage whatsoever.

"I never would have discovered the truth if I hadn't visited her at the detention center," Eleanor continued with a bitter laugh.

The realization struck Evelyn - Eleanor had accidentally overheard a conversation never meant for her ears.

Lies always unraveled eventually. The only variable was time.

The irony tasted bitter, and Eleanor's hollow chuckle confirmed she felt the same.

"For three years, we poured all our love into her, believing she was our long-lost daughter. Money meant nothing - we spent millions without hesitation if it brought her happiness."

The astronomical figure didn't surprise Evelyn in the slightest.

Victoria had always been insatiable for wealth and status. While most funds lined her own pockets, a portion undoubtedly trickled down to Margaret and Richard.

"The money is irrelevant," Eleanor choked out. "What destroys me is how she manipulated our love. Every smile, every word these past three years was calculated. The only thing genuine about her was her greed for our fortune."

Finally, the scales had fallen from Eleanor's eyes.

Yet the revelation came far too late.

Evelyn observed silently, finding the entire situation tragically absurd.

'Dearest mother and father, when you embraced Victoria as your daughter, you excused every immoral act, every transgression. Your blind devotion mirrored Alexander's at the beginning. You stabbed me without hesitation, never questioning who truly deserved your protection.'

'Wounds may heal, but scars remain forever.'

"Miss Prescott." Eleanor suddenly seized Evelyn's hand, her expression desperate.

Evelyn refocused on Eleanor's haunted eyes.

"That day at the hospital - you mentioned overhearing Margaret Dawson say my daughter died three years ago. Please, think carefully - could you have misheard? My daughter can't be dead. She just can't!"

Eleanor's grip turned vice-like.

Hope flickered in her bloodshot eyes, begging for reassurance.

Evelyn's carefully constructed composure faltered momentarily as she met that pleading gaze.

"Miss Prescott?" Eleanor pressed urgently.

Evelyn lifted her eyes to meet William's equally beseeching stare. Her pulse steadied as a faint, practiced smile curved her lips.

"The door was thick - I couldn't hear clearly. Given Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery's renowned philanthropy, I'm certain your daughter thrives somewhere, blessed by your good deeds."

Eleanor sagged with relief while William shot Evelyn a look of profound gratitude.

"William, did you hear? Our daughter lives! Now we just need to find her." Eleanor turned to her husband with renewed energy.

Evelyn observed their elation with detached calmness, her own heart untouched by their joy.

She suddenly noticed Alexander's unusual silence since Eleanor's revelation.

Turning, she found him statue-still, his expression frozen like marble. Only the storm in his eyes betrayed any emotion. Without that telltale turbulence, one might think him petrified.

But why such a reaction?

Eleanor's emotional outburst had reopened her hand wound. William quickly ushered her toward their car, but not before approaching Evelyn privately.

"Thank you," he murmured sincerely. "Not just for the blood donation, but for giving Eleanor hope today." His eyes shone with unspoken gratitude for her merciful lie.
###Chapter 388

Evelyn watched the sleek black car disappear down the driveway, her fingers tightening around the strap of her purse.

Technically, she hadn't lied.

Their daughter was still alive.

The one who died was the naive and trusting Evelyn Sinclair, not your real daughter, Vivian Prescott.

Alexander had initially planned to take Evelyn back to Blackwood Estate after their visit to Eleanor.

But something shifted in him after the revelation. "I just remembered an urgent matter," he said abruptly, his grip tightening on the steering wheel. "I'll drop you off first and pick you up tonight."

Evelyn offered him a gentle smile. "Go ahead, Alexander. I'll wait for you."

His lips curved, but the warmth never reached his eyes.

It was a hollow smile.

She had sensed the change in him the moment he learned Victoria was a fraud.

After stepping out of the car, Evelyn watched as Alexander drove away without a backward glance.

A stark contrast to how he used to linger, watching until she was safely inside.

Suspicion gnawed at her. She quickly hailed a cab and followed him.

To her surprise, he stopped at the detention center.

Had he come to see her?

Evelyn's lips curled into a cold smirk, her eyes glinting with icy amusement.

"Still clinging to her, aren't you, Alexander?"

Victoria nearly tripped over her own feet in excitement when she was informed of her visitor.

Oh, how she wished she could freshen up—apply some makeup, tame her unruly hair—but the detention center offered no such luxuries.

Still, even without cosmetics, Victoria knew she was striking. And with the secret she held, she felt invincible.

She walked with light steps, even pausing to smooth her hair before entering the visitation room.

The moment the doors opened, her blood ran cold.

Alexander sat across from her, his expression unreadable, his presence like a winter storm.

Her smile faltered. Slowly, she approached, the air growing colder with each step.

Summoning every ounce of courage, she sat across from him.

Tears welled in her eyes. "You finally came," she whispered, voice trembling. "I've missed you so much. This place is horrible. Someone even hit me last night—Vivian's doing, I'm sure of it. She framed me, Alexander! She paid off my foster parents to lie. That woman is dangerous—don't let her fool you!"

"Fool me?"

His voice was like a blade, sharp and unforgiving.

Victoria flinched, her breath hitching as she met his piercing gaze.

He wore a crisp black button-down beneath a tailored coat, his aura radiating icy detachment.

"Everything I've told you is true," she pleaded. "Don't you remember your promise to me at Pinecrest Heights? You swore you'd protect me, love me—"

A cold scoff cut her off.

Victoria recoiled, her confidence crumbling.

She searched his face desperately, but his expression was unreadable. "Alexander, what's wrong? Why—"

He stood abruptly, his towering frame casting a shadow over her. In one swift motion, he grabbed her collar, yanking her forward.

His eyes burned with fury.

"You were never the girl I met at Pinecrest Heights."
###Chapter 389

Evelyn Sinclair gasped as Alexander Blackwood suddenly yanked her forward. Her breath hitched, eyes widening in shock at his accusation. The air seemed to vanish from her lungs.

How... How does he know it wasn't me?

Unless Vivian Prescott told him everything?

No. She wouldn't. She couldn't have!

"Cough—cough—"

Alexander's grip on her throat tightened, cutting off her air supply. Her face flushed crimson, words tangling on her tongue. "W-What are you saying, Alexander? I'm Lillian, the one you've cherished all these years. How else would I have the silver locket? Please—let me go—"

"Do you really think I'd believe your lies now?" Alexander's voice dropped to a lethal whisper, his frosty gaze piercing through her.

"You're not even Eleanor and William's daughter. So how could the locket engraved with 'Evelyn' belong to you? You never had the memories of being called 'Lily'—so how could you possibly be her?"

Victoria Lancaster's pupils shrank to pinpricks.

She hadn't expected Eleanor to reveal this to Alexander. Nor had she imagined he'd piece together the truth from just a name.

"All these years, you've deceived me." His voice darkened, fury simmering beneath his composed exterior. "You should have known, Victoria Lancaster, what happens to those who dare lie to me."

His fingers tightened, veins standing stark against his pale skin.

Victoria's breath stuttered, terror clawing at her chest.

"No, Alexander—don't kill me! I—I really am Lillian—"

A sharp crack cut her off.

Her body went rigid, fear flooding her vision. She couldn't lie anymore.

"I—I was wrong! Please, spare me! If you kill me now, you'll never find out who she really is—!"

Truthfully, Alexander no longer cared.

The moment he realized his heart belonged to Vivian, childhood promises meant nothing.

What disgusted him most was how he'd let this woman manipulate him, share his bed, bear his child.

Worse—she'd used Lillian's name to blind him, making him hurt the woman he truly loved, over and over.

Alexander flung her aside, murderous intent burning in his veins.

Victoria crashed onto the floor, gasping for air.

Her neck burned with pain.

She never thought Alexander could be this ruthless.

For years, he'd trusted her completely, indulged her every whim.

Only now did she understand—when this man loved, he loved fiercely.

But when enraged, his wrath was hell itself.

Would she have to endure damnation before ever knowing his love?

No.

She refused hell.

And she wouldn't let Vivian Prescott claim heaven.

Through tear-blurred vision, she watched Alexander stride toward her, his shadow swallowing her whole.
###Chapter 390

Alexander towered over her like a predator eyeing its prey, his presence radiating an oppressive dominance that made the air feel thick.

"Don't waste my time unless you're eager for an excruciating end," he warned, his voice like ice.

Victoria coughed weakly, forcing herself to meet his gaze. "I—I know I shouldn't have lied to you, Alexander. But my feelings for you are real. I love you—I swear it!"

"Enough," Alexander cut in, his tone devoid of emotion.

She collapsed forward, biting her lip hard enough to draw blood. "Fine. I'll tell you everything."

Her head bowed, but her eyes gleamed with malice. If I can't have him, Evelyn, then neither will you.

Clenching her fists, she forced out the words. "There was an elective Evelyn and I took freshman year. A girl named Lillian was in that class. We stumbled upon her diary and discovered she had a past with you."

She hesitated, then continued, "Lillian transferred later, but I stole her diary before she left. Evelyn wanted to impersonate her too, but I beat her to it."

Desperate, she reached for Alexander's pant leg. "Please, for Ethan's sake, let me go—"

"You dare speak his name?" Alexander snarled. "You were never fit to be his mother."

With a brutal kick, he sent her sprawling. Then, without another word, he turned and walked away, leaving only cold silence in his wake.

"Alexander! Alexander!" Victoria's hoarse cries went unanswered as his figure disappeared beyond the door.

The cemetery gates loomed ahead as Alexander stepped out of his car.

He lit a cigarette, exhaling a slow stream of smoke into the crisp air.

Victoria's confession had unearthed a memory—Evelyn, six years ago, on her knees before him, tears streaming as she accused him of breaking a childhood promise.

For a fleeting moment, he had almost believed her.

Then Victoria had slithered in with her poisonous lies, convincing him Evelyn was the fraud.

But Evelyn wasn't a liar.

She gave without expecting anything in return—a rare soul in a world full of takers.

Would a woman like that steal someone else's identity?

His pulse quickened.

As the cigarette burned down to the filter, realization struck like lightning.

Everything suddenly made sense.

His breath caught.

Then—movement.

A figure in white stood from the grave of Henry Whitmore, Evelyn's grandfather.

The same silhouette he'd glimpsed last time but couldn't identify.

Alexander crushed the cigarette and strode forward.

Evelyn traced her fingers over the engraved name on the tombstone.

"I know you always wanted me to find my parents, Grandfather," she murmured. "But now that I have… I don't know if I should even acknowledge them."

A bitter laugh escaped her.

"It's almost poetic, isn't it? The people I loved most—my parents, the man I thought loved me—they all cherished the woman who destroyed you, my child, and nearly me."

Her lips curled into a dark smile.

"But don't worry. I'm close, Grandfather. So close to making them pay."

The thrill of vengeance burned in her veins as she turned to light a candle—

Only to freeze.

Someone stood just a few feet away, watching her.
###Chapter 391

The man standing before her radiated an icy detachment, his sculpted features giving nothing away as his piercing gaze locked onto hers.

Autumn winds howled through the cemetery, their chilly fingers brushing against visitors' faces with ghostly caresses.

Evelyn offered a composed smile to the unexpected visitor. "What brings you here, Alexander?" Her voice carried just the right mix of casualness and surprise, carefully masking the tension coiling in her stomach.

Alexander moved closer, his attention shifting to the weathered tombstone. "I could ask you the same question. Who rests here? This is your first time in Willowbrook, isn't it? I wasn't aware you had any connections buried in this city."

Feigning shock, Evelyn countered, "Don't tell me you don't recognize this, Alexander? Evelyn Sinclair was technically your ex-wife. Surely you remember her grandfather?"

"My ex-wife's grandfather?" His eyes dropped to the engraved name, where 'Grandfather of Evelyn Sinclair' was clearly visible in the corner.

"Why would you suddenly visit and pay respects to my former wife's relative?"

"Call it compassion," Evelyn responded without hesitation, her gaze lingering on the fresh flowers she'd placed. "Lately, I've found myself thinking about Evelyn Sinclair often. The man she loved with all her heart never returned her affection. She died branded as a disgrace, with even your family believing death was too kind a punishment—"

She punctuated her words with a practiced smile before kneeling to light the memorial candle.

"Perhaps because we look so alike, and now that I've fallen for the same man she adored, I can't help but empathize with her tragic story. I had someone research her background. When I learned about her grandfather's resting place, I thought someone should honor her memory."

Her explanation held no apparent flaws.

Alexander stood frozen beside her. The flickering candlelight seemed to ignite something deep within his dark, fathomless eyes.

"Oh, were you here to leave roses for someone too, Alexander?" Evelyn rose gracefully, brushing imaginary dust from his shirt collar with familiar ease.

"This wind is giving me a headache. Shall we head back?"

Meeting Evelyn's crescent-eyed smile, Alexander gave a silent nod.

As they walked away, Evelyn studied his impassive profile. Not a single emotion had broken through his carefully constructed mask.

Had he bought her story?

Most likely.

If he suspected anything, surely he wouldn't remain so composed—not with how intensely he'd once despised her.

...

Days later, headlines about Victoria's conviction dominated every newspaper.

Following close behind was the shocking revelation about Victoria stealing the Montgomery heiress's identity. Public outrage swelled—sympathy for the Montgomery family mingled with heartbreak for young Ethan.

Such a bright, courageous child deserved better than a monster for a mother.

While scanning the news, Evelyn's attention snagged on the Montgomery family's social media post about their ongoing search for their lost daughter.

The description mentioned a distinctive butterfly-shaped birthmark on the missing woman's waist.

Evelyn immediately worked to suppress the story's visibility.

Alexander couldn't see this—not now.

The post reinforced her determination to accelerate her plans for vengeance.

Right on cue, Alexander arrived with news—he'd set a date to introduce her to his parents.

On the appointed evening, Evelyn dressed meticulously. As the sun dipped below the horizon, she entered Blackwood Estate on Alexander's arm, her fingers lightly resting in the crook of his elbow.

How different from her first unwilling arrival at this very place.
###Chapter 392

The grand doors of Blackwood Estate swung open as Alexander escorted Evelyn inside with visible pride.

Life truly had a way of surprising everyone.

Margaret Blackwood rushed forward the moment she spotted her son. "Alexander, tell me it's not true! Those headlines about Victoria - twelve years in prison? And she was impersonating the Montgomerys all along?"

Alexander's expression darkened. "That name is forbidden in this house."

"But—"

"We're here for you to meet my fiancée," Alexander cut in sharply, his gaze softening as it fell on Evelyn. "Mother prepared these dishes specially. I hope you'll enjoy them."

Margaret's face twisted in displeasure. "You made me cook for this... woman?"

Evelyn arched an elegant brow. "Lovely to see you again, Mrs. Blackwood."

"The feeling isn't mutual," Margaret sneered. "Your face alone ruins my appetite."

"Vivian will soon be part of this family," Alexander said coldly. "I suggest you adjust your tone."

Margaret stormed to her husband's side. "Reginald, are you seeing this madness? He brings home a carbon copy of that wretched ex-wife! Why divorce her if he wants the same face?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched at the insult.

Alexander's patience snapped. "Either accept my future wife, or lose your son."

Margaret paled as Alexander turned to leave with Evelyn. "Wait! Fine! If Victoria's out of the picture and you're over her, then... do as you please." She retreated to the kitchen. "I'll check the soup."

Evelyn removed her coat. "I need to freshen up, Alexander."

"Be careful," he murmured, hand resting on her waist. "Remember your condition."

Reginald studied Evelyn over his newspaper. "This Vivian Prescott bears an uncanny resemblance to Evelyn Sinclair. Why marry someone who looks like the woman you supposedly despise?"

"Who said I despised her?" Alexander's retort left his father speechless.

Reginald had limited interactions with Evelyn during his overseas assignments, but her striking features remained memorable. His opinion had been shaped entirely by Margaret's tales of Evelyn's misdeeds - stories painting her as the villain his son loathed.

Yet now...

Evelyn didn't actually need the bathroom, but Margaret's venomous words stoked the embers of her rage. She needed composure.

She remembered how this woman had dismissed her as mere staff when Victoria framed her for theft. Margaret had never respected the orphaned daughter-in-law she deemed unworthy.

Composing herself, Evelyn exited—only to collide with Henry Blackwood returning from the gardens.

"Grandfather Blackwood," she greeted respectfully. "What a pleasant surprise."

The old man's knowing gaze pierced through her. "I had my doubts before, but now I'm certain."

Evelyn feigned confusion. "Certain of what?"

Henry's eyes gleamed with wisdom. "It's you, isn't it? Evelyn Sinclair. I know it's you."
###Chapter 393

Evelyn froze for a heartbeat before a serene smile curved her lips.

"You must be mistaken about me, Grandfather Blackwood. How could I possibly be Evelyn Sinclair?"

The light in Henry Blackwood's aged eyes dimmed slightly, but his gaze remained sharp. "I won't force you to admit it if you don't wish to, Evelyn."

"I truly am not Evelyn, Grandfather." She denied with practiced ease. "Why would I marry a man who despises me if I were her? I learned long ago that throwing myself into fire only leaves me burned."

The old man stiffened, his white brows knitting tightly. "You're truly marrying Alexander?"

Evelyn nodded without hesitation. "Yes. And I'm carrying his child."

Henry's gaze dropped to her still-flat stomach. His lips pressed into a thin line, but he said nothing more.

"Grandfather. Vivian." Alexander's deep voice cut through the tension as he approached. "Why are you standing by the bathroom?"

Evelyn turned to him with a practiced smile. "I happened to run into Grandfather. We were just talking. He even joked that I might be Evelyn Sinclair."

A shadow flickered across Alexander's face—subtle, fleeting—before he schooled his expression. He took Evelyn's hand in his, his touch warm. "Vivian does resemble Evelyn, Grandfather, but I assure you, they are not the same person."

The weight of his words settled over Evelyn like a balm.

He didn't doubt her.

His fingers laced with hers, firm yet gentle.

"I've decided to marry Vivian," Alexander declared. "The wedding will be in two weeks. That's why I brought her here—to formally introduce her to the family."

Henry hesitated, his gaze shifting between them before he sighed. "This is your sin to bear, Alexander. And your punishment."

Evelyn fell silent, the meaning clear. She prayed Alexander wouldn't dwell on it.

Just then, a maid approached to announce dinner.

Henry excused himself, claiming no appetite, and retreated upstairs. Only four remained at the table—Evelyn, Alexander, Margaret Blackwood, and Winston.

Though Margaret's disdain was palpable, she held her tongue with Alexander present.

"I heard you're the lead designer at Lady Belle, Miss Prescott. Impressive for someone so young," Winston remarked.

Evelyn smiled modestly, glancing at Alexander. "It's nothing compared to what Alexander has achieved."

"True. He was running a multinational corporation while still in university. Few can match him," Margaret interjected, her tone dripping with pride—and something sharper. "You must have worked very hard to get close to him. What else could you be after but his status?"

Alexander's hands stilled mid-motion, a half-peeled shrimp poised between his fingers.

Sensing his displeasure, Margaret quickly changed the subject. "The borscht should be ready. I'll check on it."

She rose abruptly, unable to withstand the icy aura radiating from her son.

Alexander placed the peeled shrimp on Evelyn's plate, his voice softening. "My mother loves to cook. Borscht is her specialty. Have some—it's good for you."

Evelyn nodded, her smile sweet. But as she stared at the shrimp, irony twisted inside her.

You never imagined you'd be peeling shrimp for the woman you hate, did you, Alexander?

I remember waiting for you every night—a table full of food, hoping you'd come home. Instead, you held that wretched woman in your arms while I rotted in the shadows.

Just then, Margaret returned, a maid trailing behind with a steaming pot of soup.
###Chapter 394

A mischievous glint danced in Evelyn's eyes as her lips curved into a sly smile.

Just as Margaret was about to take her seat, Evelyn clutched her chest dramatically, pretending to gag.

All eyes immediately turned to Evelyn while Alexander rushed to her side with concern. "Are you feeling unwell, Vivian?"

"The smell...it's making me nauseous," Evelyn murmured weakly, "Perhaps it's the soup, Alexander. I think I might be sick."

Margaret's face darkened instantly. That soup was her signature dish, packed with nutrients and her personal favorite.

Yet this woman dared to call it foul?

"Remove the soup immediately," Alexander commanded.

The maid hesitated before nodding obediently.

"Wait!" Margaret snapped. "What exactly are you implying, Vivian? If my cooking disgusts you so much, you're welcome to leave! This deliberate performance is utterly ridiculous!"

"Vivian's pregnant," Alexander stated firmly. "Morning sickness is perfectly normal. If the aroma bothers her, we'll eliminate it."

Margaret could only glare at Evelyn, rendered speechless.

Evelyn met Margaret's furious gaze with mocking amusement, raising a challenging eyebrow.

Dinner concluded abruptly as Evelyn pretended to gag at every dish Alexander served her after a few bites.

With each exaggerated reaction, Margaret's expression grew stormier.

Mr. Blackwood excused himself to make a phone call while Alexander went to prepare something special for Evelyn since she'd barely eaten.

Left alone in the parlor, Evelyn and Margaret engaged in silent warfare.

When a maid brought dessert, Evelyn pushed the plate away with visible disgust, opting to check her phone instead.

Seeing Alexander still occupied, Margaret finally exploded. "You're deliberately humiliating me, aren't you Vivian? First refusing my cooking, now this childish display! What's your game?"

Evelyn looked up slowly. "What if I am?"

Margaret blinked, stunned by the blunt admission.

"You—"

"Your food was bland and smelled revolting. I barely kept my composure because Alexander was present. In a restaurant, I would've sent it back immediately."

"How dare you insult my culinary skills!"

"Skills?" Evelyn sniffed the dessert before flinging it onto the coffee table, "accidentally" knocking over a teacup that splashed onto Margaret's designer dress.

Margaret gasped, jumping up to point an accusing finger. "Have you lost your mind, Vivian? I knew you were trouble the moment I saw you, with that face resembling that wretched Evelyn Sinclair! But you're even more despicable than she was!"

When Evelyn remained impassive, Margaret grabbed her wrist viciously. "Listen carefully, Vivian Prescott. If you want to marry into the Blackwood family, you'll show proper respect to your future mother-in-law. Cross me, and I'll ensure you meet the same fate as that Sinclair woman. Understood?"

Evelyn glanced at the hand gripping her wrist, then slowly rose to her full height with a dangerous smile curling her lips...
###Chapter 395

"Mother-in-law?" Evelyn scoffed, her enchanting features twisting with mockery. "How dare you call yourself that?"

Margaret Blackwood's eyes widened in shock.

Evelyn yanked her arm back, her proud gaze sweeping over Margaret's furious expression like winter frost. "You're the one who needs to watch yourself around me. I'm not Evelyn Sinclair anymore, and I won't let you walk all over me—scolding or hitting me whenever you please."

"You—!" Margaret's face flushed with rage as she raised her hand to strike.

"Enough." Alexander's icy voice cut through the air, freezing Margaret mid-swing.

Evelyn arched a brow, her lips curling into a smirk. "See how much Alexander cares for me? Don’t cross me. Understand?"

Margaret was too furious to speak.

A flicker of fear passed through Evelyn's eyes as she turned toward Alexander. "Let's go back. I don’t think your mother wants me here."

Alexander shot Margaret a frigid glare. "This is the last time I’ll say it. Vivian is going to be your daughter-in-law soon. Adjust your attitude accordingly."

"Alexander! Don’t be fooled by this woman! She’s not the fragile, innocent girl you think she is!" Margaret jabbed a finger at Evelyn, her voice trembling with frustration.

"All I’ve seen is you harassing her repeatedly," Alexander said coolly, draping Evelyn’s jacket over her shoulders before taking her hand. "Let’s go."

Evelyn nodded, letting him lace their fingers together as they walked away.

Margaret inhaled sharply before chasing after them to the car.

"Why would your own mother lie to you, Alexander? This woman isn’t who you think she is! You’ll regret marrying her, just like you regretted marrying that wretched Evelyn!"

Alexander’s grip on the steering wheel tightened.

With a sharp motion, he rolled up the window and accelerated, leaving Margaret standing in the cold night air.

Through the rearview mirror, Evelyn allowed herself a small, satisfied smile at the sight of Margaret stomping her foot in frustration.

Back at the estate, Alexander made Evelyn a bowl of noodles.

Maybe it was hunger, but she found them surprisingly delicious.

If only, in the past, he had shown her even a fraction of this warmth—things wouldn’t have ended up this way.

But there were no "what ifs" in this world.

The next morning, Alexander announced his engagement to Vivian Prescott.

The internet flooded with thousands of congratulatory messages, but Evelyn felt nothing reading them.

Years ago, when she had married him, the comments had been vicious—filled with insults and disdain. Not a single person had blessed their union during that grand ceremony. Back then, all she had were her own naive, hopeful prayers.

Now, with the entire city celebrating her engagement, she no longer carried that same youthful hope.

Her phone rang as she scrolled through the comments.

She answered without hesitation when she saw the caller ID. "Sebastian," she greeted, listening intently before nodding. "Understood."

Hanging up, she grabbed her purse and headed out—only to stop short at the unexpected visitor waiting outside.

Evelyn’s expression darkened at the sight of Nathaniel Sterling. "What do you want now?"

"Ms. Prescott," he said warmly, his voice almost pleading. "Do you have a moment? There’s somewhere I’d like to take you."

Evelyn averted her gaze. "How many times must I tell you? I’m not Evelyn Sinclair. We have nothing to discuss."

Without another word, she walked away.
###Chapter 396

"Olivia's been in a car accident. It's bad. She wants to see you one last time before..."

Evelyn Sinclair froze mid-step, her pulse hammering wildly in her throat.

She sucked in a sharp breath, suspicion coiling in her gut.

Was this some twisted test from Nathaniel and Olivia?

No. Olivia couldn’t have been in an accident. She had to be fine.

Evelyn glared at Nathaniel, irritation flaring.

"I don’t know who you’re talking about. Leave me alone."

She turned on her heel, but her chest tightened painfully as she walked away.

Nathaniel’s voice cracked behind her, raw with grief. "Are you really that heartless, Evelyn? Olivia was your best friend. Do you want her to die without making peace?"

Evelyn heard every word. She hadn’t gone far.

But she refused to look back.

Yet, the moment she rounded the corner, her hands shook as she pulled out her phone.

One call confirmed it—Olivia Bennett had been rushed to the emergency room after a collision.

"Olivia—"

Her breath hitched.

She flagged down a cab and sped toward the hospital.

After questioning the staff, Evelyn found herself outside a private room.

The door stood slightly ajar.

Her feet refused to move.

She wasn’t ready to see Olivia broken.

What if she was too late?

Clenching her fists, she forced herself inside.

The sight stole her breath.

A motionless figure lay beneath a white sheet. The ECG monitor displayed a flat, lifeless line.

Evelyn approached slowly, needing to see the face beneath the cover.

But as she reached the bed, she realized—the sheet had already been drawn over the head.

Her fingers trembled as she lifted the fabric.

Olivia’s pale, lifeless face stared back.

Evelyn’s lungs seized.

Hot tears spilled down her cheeks.

"Olivia..." Her voice broke as she traced her friend’s still-warm skin.

"Why? How did this happen?"

She couldn’t believe it.

She had imagined their reunion—happy, whole, alive.

Not this.

Not another loss.

What had she done in a past life to deserve this endless pain?

Evelyn bent forward, clutching Olivia’s limp hand. The unnatural pallor of her skin shattered her.

"I’m sorry, Olivia. Evie’s here..." she whispered, pressing her forehead to Olivia’s.

Then—

A soft chuckle vibrated against her ear.

Evelyn jerked back.

Olivia’s lips curved into a smirk.

"Finally admitting it, are we?"
###Chapter 397

Evelyn's tear-filled eyes widened in disbelief. That voice—she couldn't have imagined it.

Lifting her gaze, she met Olivia's mischievous grin, those bright eyes blinking playfully at her.

Olivia was alive.

Evelyn's heart twisted with conflicting emotions—frustration warring with overwhelming relief.

Olivia sprang up energetically, studying Evelyn's stunned expression.

She arched an eyebrow triumphantly. "So you finally admit I'm your best friend, Miss Vivian Prescott?"

Evelyn stood speechless.

The silence was broken by approaching footsteps.

Turning, Evelyn saw Nathaniel enter the room. His usually composed features were tinged with emotion, eyes shimmering with unshed tears.

The realization hit Evelyn like a wave—this had all been a test.

Despite her suspicions, she'd chosen to trust them in the end.

Because the thought of truly losing them had terrified her.

"You've finally admitted it, Evie." Nathaniel's voice trembled as he stepped closer, his Adam's apple bobbing. "It's so good to see you again."

His hand reached slowly toward her cheek.

Evelyn swatted it away sharply. "Do you think this is funny?" Her icy tone carried unmistakable reproach.

Both Olivia and Nathaniel froze, unprepared for her anger.

"Evelyn—"

"Evie, I—"

"Mocking death is your idea of a joke?" Evelyn spun on her heel to leave.

Realizing their prank had gone too far, Olivia shot Nathaniel a panicked look, urging him to stop her.

"Evelyn!" Nathaniel caught her arm before she could storm out. "We went too far, I know. But you understand why we did this."

His grip tightened slightly, his eyes brimming with raw emotion.

"Do you have any idea how devastated we were when you disappeared three years ago? Olivia and I refused to accept you were gone."

"And when we finally found you again? You insisted you weren't Evelyn. Wouldn't even look at us properly."

Nathaniel's voice thickened as he studied her vulnerable expression. Gently, he brushed his fingers against her cheek.

The warmth of her skin beneath his touch made his eyes water.

"We missed you so much, Evelyn."

Tears began streaming silently down Evelyn's face.

Olivia limped forward, her own cheeks wet. "Don't be mad, Evie. The car accident wasn't a complete lie—I really did hurt my leg."

Sniffling, she tugged at Evelyn's sleeve.

"You lied to us too, remember? Consider us even now, okay?"

Though they'd done nothing wrong, both were apologizing profusely.

Evelyn bit her quivering lip, her vision blurred by tears.

She could no longer contain her emotions seeing Olivia's tear-streaked face. Reaching out, she pulled her friend into a fierce embrace.

"Olivia—"

"Evie—"

Olivia clung to Evelyn, overwhelmed by the joy of their reunion after so many years apart.

'Thank heavens.'
###Chapter 398

"You're still alive, Evelyn."

"Not to mention, your life is thriving now."

"Thank goodness..."

Having revealed her true identity, Evelyn recounted her experiences over the past three years to Olivia and Nathaniel, including what she needed to do next.

Tears welled in Olivia's eyes as she sniffled, then turned to Nathaniel, who stood silently with a somber expression. "No way, Evie. Don't tell me you're actually going to marry Alexander again! He nearly destroyed you! It was the news of your engagement to him that forced Nate and me to resort to this plan just to make you admit who you really are."

She nudged Evelyn's shoulder playfully.

"I knew you still cared about me, Evie. You passed this test with flying colors!"

Evelyn smiled faintly before her expression hardened. "My marriage to Alexander is non-negotiable. I have to go through with it."

"Why?" Olivia demanded, frustration lacing her voice. "Have you forgotten how he and Victoria treated you?"

"Precisely because of how they treated me," Evelyn replied, her gaze sharpening. "I want them to feel every ounce of pain they inflicted on me."

Seeing the unshakable resolve in her eyes, Olivia and Nathaniel exchanged a glance, knowing better than to argue.

With Olivia still recovering from her leg injury in the hospital, Nathaniel escorted Evelyn to the intersection outside.

Beneath the golden autumn sunlight, he studied her—the familiar arch of her brows, the faint curve of her lips—and saw traces of the woman he once knew.

"Once your revenge is over," he murmured, "would you give me the chance to take care of you, Evelyn?"

She remained silent, recognizing the unspoken confession in his eyes.

A regretful smile touched her lips. "Thank you for caring about me, Nate. But I’ve learned that timing matters just as much as the person. Maybe you were the right one at the wrong time."

"Do you still love Alexander?"

"Love?" The word tasted bitter on her tongue.

Oh, how she had loved him—so fiercely that she had sacrificed her dignity, her self-worth, everything. And what had it earned her? The loss of her first child. Looking back now, that love felt almost pathetic.

No, she didn’t love him anymore.

Every shred of that foolish devotion had died the moment he scattered their child’s ashes.

After parting ways with Nathaniel, Evelyn headed straight for the detention center.

A thrill of satisfaction coursed through her as she faced Victoria, who now looked hollow-eyed and gaunt, dark circles marring her once-flawless complexion.

Evelyn turned on her phone, displaying the flood of headlines announcing her and Alexander’s upcoming wedding.

Victoria’s eyes burned with venomous envy. "You bitch! Evelyn, you conniving snake! Don’t think you’ve won! The moment Alexander finds out who you really are, he’ll strangle you with his bare hands!"

Evelyn tucked her phone away, unfazed. "If he truly wanted me dead, I wouldn’t be standing here right now."

"You—!"

"How’s prison life treating you?" Evelyn tilted her head mockingly. "Tsk. It’s only been a short while, and you already look like a ghost."

"This is your doing, Evelyn! I will make you pay!"

"Revenge?" Evelyn laughed coldly. "You don’t get to use that word. You did this to yourself. This is the consequence of everything you’ve done—throwing me in jail, having inmates torture me, stealing my child. Twelve years is a mercy compared to what you deserve."

Victoria’s jaw clenched. "Twelve years for three lives? That’s hardly fair!"

"Three lives," Evelyn repeated, her voice like ice. "My grandfather. Sophia Montgomery. My child. Twelve years is nothing. And believe me—it won’t end there. You will answer for every drop of blood on your hands. It’s only a matter of time."

Fear flickered in Victoria’s eyes as her fingers dug into her pants.

As Evelyn turned to leave, desperation clawed at Victoria. She couldn’t die here. She wouldn’t.

"Evelyn Sinclair!" she shrieked. "What if I told you your bastard child never died? You’d get me out of here, wouldn’t you?"
###Chapter 399

Evelyn had already stepped through the doorway when Victoria's desperate shout reached her. A flicker of hope ignited in her ice-blue eyes.

Her heartbeat accelerated dangerously, pounding against her ribcage.

Though skeptical, she slowly turned, lifting her frosty gaze. "That revelation doesn't suddenly make you innocent."

Victoria's bloodshot eyes locked onto hers. "I'm telling the truth! Your child lives. I lied about its death just to torture you. I've kept it hidden all these years as insurance!"

Evelyn steeled her emotions as she stepped closer. "Proof. Give me one reason to believe you."

"Would you rather cling to hope or despair?" Victoria smirked, knowing Evelyn's deepest wound was the child she'd never held.

She could never imagine the truth - that Evelyn's child had been right beside her all along!

Seizing Evelyn's silence, Victoria pressed on. "Get me released, and I'll tell you where your bastard is. Otherwise—"

"Dream on," Evelyn cut in sharply. "You're not walking free."

Victoria gaped at Evelyn's composed expression. "Don't you want your child back?"

"More than anything," Evelyn admitted, eyes flashing. "But I know you'd lie. And even if you're telling the truth, you'll still pay for murdering my grandfather and Sophia!"

Victoria's face drained of color as Evelyn turned away casually.

Was this really the same Evelyn Sinclair she'd once manipulated so easily?

The realization struck too late - her bargaining chip had become Evelyn's greatest lead. She'd played her hand too soon.

Regret tasted bitter, but the game was already over.

Stepping into the sunlight, Evelyn gazed at the cloudless sky with renewed hope glimmering in her eyes.

Tears traced her cheeks as her lips curved slightly.

"Wherever you are, my darling, Mommy will find you. I swear it..."

She buried the joy deep inside and began investigating the past with fresh determination.

If her child lived, those ashes had been fake.

Had Victoria deceived Alexander too?

If the ashes were fabricated, then Alexander's cruelty had been genuine - his hatred for her and their child absolute.

Days passed with no breakthroughs in her covert search.

Margaret and Richard remained elusive.

On the wedding eve, Evelyn met Sebastian while Alexander was engrossed in a crucial video conference.

Sebastian was stunned to learn the child stolen from Evelyn in prison might still live.

"Could this be another of Victoria's schemes?" he questioned, ever cautious.

"Precisely because it's Victoria, I believe she'd keep such leverage," Evelyn reasoned, hope shining in her eyes. "I need to find my child, Sebastian. I wonder if she looks like Amelia..."

"I'll help you," Sebastian promised, his usual warmth tinged with melancholy. "After all these years... I too long to reunite with lost family."

Evelyn studied his suddenly somber expression.

"Something troubles you. Won't you share it? After all you've done for me, let me shoulder some of your burden."

Sebastian met her gaze solemnly. "A gentleman shouldn't burden the woman he admires, but today... there's something you should know."

Evelyn tensed as his demeanor shifted.

"I'm listening."

"Have you ever wondered why I avoid Blackwood Estate? Or why I despise everyone under its roof?"

His words flowed softly, like a quiet stream carrying hidden depths.
###Chapter 400

Evelyn shook her head, her bewildered gaze locked on Sebastian. His next words would reveal a shocking fragment of history.

The weight of Sebastian's secret settled heavily in her chest before she could fully comprehend it.

Her phone buzzed with Alexander's call before she could process Sebastian's revelation.

A tender light returned to Sebastian's eyes as he watched Evelyn depart.

"What kind of man pushes the woman he loves toward his enemy?" Sebastian murmured to himself.

A dangerous smile curved his lips, his eyes glinting like shards of ice.

Following Alexander's summons, Evelyn arrived at Blackwood Enterprises' grand lobby.

The automatic doors slid open just as she approached, revealing Alexander's imposing figure.

Every movement exuded effortless aristocracy, his presence commanding the space.

His frosty gaze melted instantly when it landed on Evelyn, warmth flooding his features.

"You sounded urgent on the phone. What's this about?" Evelyn asked, forcing a smile.

Alexander took her hand without answering, leading her to the waiting car.

As they drove, Evelyn half-expected them to be heading to the courthouse for their marriage license.

Yet that seemed unlikely - she'd postponed their wedding plans, citing unfavorable dates.

The scenery outside grew increasingly familiar as they traveled.

They were heading toward Pinecrest Heights.

True enough, thirty minutes later, the car stopped at Pinecrest Heights' windswept shoreline.

The autumn sea breeze carried biting saltiness, needling through clothing with winter's approach.

Evelyn's heart twisted as she faced the churning waves.

This place once held their most cherished memories - now nothing but withered petals of the past.

Why had Alexander brought her here?

She turned to find him emerging from the car, clutching an extravagant bouquet.

Blood-red roses glistened in his hands, their golden edges catching the afternoon sun.

Alexander approached, the wind softening his usually sharp features.

"For you," he murmured, offering the blooms.

"Thank you." Evelyn accepted them with a practiced smile, meeting his unusually bright eyes.

"Alexander, why here? Why roses? What's happening?"

"Something long overdue." His voice sounded strangely thick.

Evelyn frowned. "What do you mean?"

"Marrying you." The words came easily, his peach-blossom eyes overflowing with warmth.

Before she could react, Alexander dropped to one knee, his cool fingers encircling her left hand.

A dazzling diamond slid onto her ring finger before she could protest.

Her breath caught at his unexpected action.

His phrasing echoed a forgotten promise from years past.

Did he know? Had he discovered-

Alexander's handsome face drew nearer as Evelyn remained frozen. "I love you. Truly."

That emphasized word hung between them.

Then his lips captured hers in a kiss that stole what little breath remained.
###Chapter 401

Alexander's sudden kiss left Evelyn breathless.

His confession of love echoed in her ears.

He claimed to love a woman who bore the face of the ex-wife he had once despised.

It was absurd.

You never showed me kindness when I worshipped the ground you walked on.

Now that my heart is nothing but ashes, how dare you speak of love?

Too late, Alexander Blackwood.

Even if you've fallen for me now, it won't erase the scars you carved into my soul.

Feigning discomfort, Evelyn turned her face away, breaking the kiss.

Yet, she had "joyfully" accepted his marriage proposal.

Gazing at the endless ocean, she let the waves mirror the storm of hatred in her heart.

This is your debt to me, Alexander. And now, you will repay it.

Alexander's chest tightened as he studied the enchanting curve of Evelyn's lips, the light in his eyes dimming.

Had he realized sooner, perhaps he wouldn't have lost the woman he loved to the cruelty of time.

Now, she was gone—forever.

Evelyn...

If we could start over, would you still choose to love me?

The wedding took place the next day.

In the grandest ballroom of Blackwood Enterprises' most luxurious hotel, Evelyn stood radiant in a seven-figure wedding gown, a diamond tiara glinting atop her head.

Clutching a bouquet, she walked toward the impeccably suited Alexander beneath the admiring gazes of the elite.

The chandelier's light refracted around her, casting an ethereal glow as she ascended the steps.

Alexander couldn't help but recall their first wedding six years ago as he took in the poised elegance of the woman before him.

His pulse quickened. His gaze softened.

Meanwhile, in the prison cafeteria, Victoria Lancaster froze mid-step as the live broadcast of Evelyn and Alexander's wedding played on the television.

Her grip on the tray tightened until her knuckles turned white.

This was the wedding she was supposed to have! The man she had schemed and clawed to possess!

All these years of victory, only for Evelyn to snatch everything back in the end.

No.

She refused to accept this.

She would not let this be her ending!

With a scream, Victoria hurled the tray to the ground. "You bitch! Evelyn Sinclair, you'll pay for this!"

Her eyes burned with venomous rage.

A burly inmate nearby scowled, rolling up her sleeves. "Who the hell do you think you're yelling at?"

Before Victoria could react, a fist collided with her face.

She shrieked as two more blows landed, curling into a ball as kicks rained down.

"Not my face! Don't ruin my face!" she begged, but her pleas only fueled their brutality.

Through swollen eyes, she caught a glimpse of the screen—Alexander sliding a ring onto Evelyn's finger.

Envy and hatred twisted inside her like a knife.

Blood trickled from her split lip as she spat out the name like a curse.

"Evelyn Sinclair!"

The ceremony concluded in perfection, marking another step in Evelyn's carefully crafted revenge.
###Chapter 402

Though the wedding ceremony went against her true desires, Evelyn found solace in having little Ethan as her ring bearer.

Among the distinguished guests, she noticed Eleanor and William Kingsley had come to offer their blessings.

In some small way, it felt like receiving parental approval.

Margaret Blackwood, however, wore her displeasure openly.

One of Margaret's society friends approached with false cheer. "What an exceptional daughter-in-law you've acquired, Mrs. Blackwood. Wealthy, accomplished, and stunning. You must be absolutely thrilled."

"Money means nothing when the Blackwoods have plenty of our own. Beautiful women are a dime a dozen - her looks are merely passable!" Margaret scoffed, shooting daggers at Evelyn who was mingling with guests.

Turning sharply, Margaret descended upon Eleanor and William. "Mr. and Mrs. Kingsley, I was utterly shocked to learn about Victoria's deception. How she played us all for fools!"

Eleanor sighed mournfully. "I truly believed I'd found my long-lost daughter and that our families would be united. What a cruel twist of fate."

"Indeed," Margaret agreed bitterly. "Who could imagine such villainy from Victoria's family? I'd have pressed charges for fraud if not for the child she bore Alexander!"

Her eyes flashed with fury before softening into calculated sympathy.

"The Kingsleys are among Willowbrook's most respected families. How unfortunate you haven't located your daughter yet - it would have been an honor to unite our houses. Had you found her sooner, perhaps she and Alexander might have formed an attachment, sparing us this... arrangement." Margaret's gaze flickered disdainfully toward Evelyn.

Eleanor followed her look, taking in Evelyn's radiant beauty in the exquisite wedding gown. An inexplicable pang struck her heart.

"Vivian Prescott isn't so terrible."

"You've no idea, Mrs. Kingsley. This woman is worse than Alexander's first wife, Evelyn Sinclair! The sight of her makes me physically ill!"

"You're welcome to retire early if you're feeling unwell, Mother."

Evelyn's melodic voice startled Margaret, who turned with a sneer. "Disgusting creature!" she spat before storming off.

With Margaret gone, Evelyn felt the atmosphere lighten considerably.

She turned to Eleanor and William with a gracious smile. "Thank you for attending. A toast to you both." She sipped her champagne elegantly.

"Congratulations, Miss Prescott," Eleanor said, her usual sharpness noticeably absent.

Congratulations?

Evelyn's smile held hidden meaning. The only thing worth celebrating was how close she was to completing her revenge.

Just then, Alexander approached, devastatingly handsome in his tailored tuxedo.

"Miss Prescott suits you perfectly, Mr. Blackwood. I apologize for my harsh words defending Victoria before." Eleanor offered.

Alexander's lips quirked. "I've never concerned myself with others' opinions." He slid an arm around Evelyn's waist. "You must be exhausted, darling. Shall we leave?"

Evelyn nodded affectionately.

"Miss Prescott!" Eleanor suddenly called out as they turned to go.

They paused. "Is something wrong, Mrs. Kingsley?"

"It's just..." Eleanor hesitated. "We've hit dead ends searching for our daughter. I wondered... might you recall if Margaret or Victoria ever mentioned anything about her?"

Ah. They were asking her about herself.

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond, but Alexander smoothly interjected. "Perhaps I can assist. Are there any distinguishing marks we should know about?"

Eleanor and William's eyes lit with hope. "Yes! Our daughter has a very distinctive birthmark!"
###Chapter 403

Evelyn's expression shifted at Eleanor's words.

Birthmark.

Her carefully constructed facade would crumble if Eleanor mentioned the butterfly-shaped mark on her skin.

"What birthmark?" Alexander inquired, his curiosity piqued.

"It's a—"

"I'm feeling lightheaded, Alexander..."

Evelyn's brows knitted together just as Eleanor began to speak. She swayed slightly before leaning weakly against Alexander's chest.

His attention snapped back to her instantly.

Without hesitation, he scooped her into his arms. "I'm taking you to the hospital."

"It's nothing serious," Evelyn murmured, resting her head against his shoulder. "Just exhaustion."

Eleanor and William exchanged a glance, their eyes filled with unspoken concern as they watched Alexander carry Evelyn away.

Night deepened, the evening breeze rustling the leaves outside the window.

Evelyn lay in bed, eyes closed, feigning sleep despite the restless energy coursing through her.

Tonight was supposed to be their first night as husband and wife. While she had no idea what Alexander was thinking, she had no intention of letting their relationship progress physically.

Moments later, she heard the bathroom door click open. Alexander's footsteps were deliberately soft, as if he didn’t want to disturb her.

Then, the mattress dipped beside her.

His warmth enveloped her, his familiar scent wrapping around her like an invisible embrace.

Evelyn's pulse quickened. She curled her fingers beneath the sheets, resisting the urge to pull away.

Surely, he wouldn’t expect anything from her tonight.

Just as the thought crossed her mind, she felt his breath ghost over her cheek.

Afraid he might kiss her, she fluttered her eyes open.

Dark, fathomless eyes met hers.

"Did I wake you?" His voice was a low, velvety murmur.

Evelyn forced a small smile. "No."

"Good," he whispered. His fingers brushed her cheek as he leaned in, his lips grazing the corner of hers.

She pressed a hand against his chest. "I'm pregnant, Alexander. We shouldn’t."

He pulled back slightly, studying her with an unreadable gaze. "I’ll wait until you’re ready. Sleep now."

"Goodnight," she murmured, exhaling silently in relief. Yet, she couldn’t shake the strange intensity in his eyes.

Darkness settled over the room, the only sounds their quiet breaths and the steady rhythm of their hearts.

Evelyn had already been awake, but the unfamiliar weight of Alexander beside her made sleep impossible.

She turned away, trying to put distance between them—only for his arm to slide around her waist, pulling her back against him.

His palm rested lightly over her stomach, warmth seeping through the thin fabric of her nightgown.

She stiffened but didn’t push him away.

She had come too far to retreat now.

Just a few more days.

Alexander’s lips curved faintly as he inhaled the faint minty scent of her hair.

The next morning, Evelyn woke to find herself curled against Alexander’s chest, his arms securely around her.

Her eyes flew open in alarm.

With a sharp inhale, she shoved him away and scrambled out of bed.

Alexander merely rolled over, undisturbed, his breathing steady as he continued to sleep.
###Chapter 404

Evelyn's rose-tinted lips curved into a faint smirk as she observed the peaceful expression on the sleeping man's face.

Three years of insomnia, Alexander?

Yet here you are, sleeping like a baby.

Tell me, did you ever lose a single night's sleep over my supposed death?

No, of course not.

With one last glance at Alexander's serene features, Evelyn turned away and headed to the bathroom. After freshening up and changing, she stepped out into the hallway—only to nearly collide with little Ethan emerging from his room.

"Good morning, sweetheart."

She smiled warmly and crouched to his level.

"Is it time for school already? Would you like Aunt Vivian to make you something special for breakfast?"

Ethan blinked up at her with those impossibly large hazel eyes before nodding shyly. "Yes, please."

The simple response made Evelyn's heart swell.

Though the kitchen staff had already prepared breakfast, Evelyn insisted on making Ethan's meal herself—a nutritious spread with a playful touch.

At the dining table, Ethan stared at the star-shaped pancake on his plate without touching it.

Worried, Evelyn leaned closer. "Don't you like pancakes, darling? I can make you something else—"

Before she could finish, Ethan shook his head vigorously.

When he looked up, his entire face glowed with something pure and joyful. "Thank you... Mommy."

Mommy.

The word struck Evelyn like lightning. Most children resisted stepmothers, yet here was Ethan embracing her without hesitation.

Her vision blurred as she gently stroked his soft hair. "Aunt Vivian will always love you as her own, Ethan. I promise you'll never lack for a mother's love again."

The boy's answering smile—so bright and trusting—nearly shattered what remained of Evelyn's defenses.

After breakfast, she walked Ethan to his preschool, hand in hand. Her own daughter Amelia was safe with a trusted friend—she would never set foot in this particular school again.

Just as they reached the gates, Eleanor Kingsley appeared, clutching a stack of papers.

The older woman froze upon seeing Evelyn with Ethan. "Miss Prescott, I didn't expect to see you bringing Ethan to school."

"What brings you here, Mrs. Kingsley?" Evelyn kept her tone light.

Eleanor's gaze lingered on Ethan's small hand wrapped in Evelyn's. "Just as I cared for Victoria like my own daughter these past years, I've loved this child as my grandson. What happened to Victoria... well, she brought it upon herself. But Ethan..." Her voice cracked. "I can't bear to let him go."

Evelyn understood perfectly—the raw affection in Eleanor's eyes was unmistakable.

"Grandma."

Ethan's clear voice cut through the tension.

"You'll always be my grandma."

Eleanor's face transformed with hope. "Ethan—"

As she reached to embrace him, the papers slipped from her grasp. Evelyn's breath caught when she recognized the image printed on them.

Ethan crouched to help gather the scattered pages. His small fingers paused over one particular sheet. "I've seen this butterfly before."

The innocent observation sent a chill down Evelyn's spine.
###Chapter 405

Eleanor Kingsley and Evelyn Sinclair both gasped when Ethan Blackwood spoke up.

As a designer herself, Eleanor could perfectly replicate Evelyn's distinctive birthmark on the paper.

Evelyn wondered if Alexander had ever glimpsed the mark when she wasn't paying attention.

"Where did you see this butterfly, Ethan?" Eleanor crouched down, her shimmering eyes alight with desperate hope.

"Why are you distributing so many missing person flyers, Mrs. Montgomery? Are you searching for your daughter?" Evelyn deftly redirected the conversation.

Eleanor nodded fervently. "I've posted online ads too, but these flyers are another avenue. I'd try anything to find my child!"

Her voice trembled with raw, aching sincerity.

She truly longed to be reunited with her lost daughter.

Evelyn felt her heart constrict painfully in her chest.

'Maybe my parents weren't cruel after all. Maybe they were just pawns in Victoria's schemes.'

'They were manipulated through their desperation to find me.'

'And yet...'

"Tell Grandma, Ethan," Eleanor pressed urgently. "Where did you see this butterfly before?"

Snapping from her thoughts, Evelyn moved to intervene—but Ethan's clear voice rang out first. "On Evie."

Evelyn's pulse skyrocketed.

Eleanor froze. "Evie? You mean Evelyn Sinclair?"

Ethan nodded, then pointed precisely to the small of Evelyn's back. "Right here. That's where Evie's butterfly is."

Silence.

Absolute stillness.

Evelyn never imagined Ethan would have seen her birthmark.

The boy had only been two when she "died" three years ago. His memory was astonishingly sharp.

"W-What...?" Eleanor swayed dangerously, her vision darkening.

As if her bones had turned to water, Eleanor started collapsing.

Evelyn lunged forward, catching her just before she hit the ground. "Mrs. Montgomery! Are you alright?"

Eleanor's face had gone ghostly pale. Her vacant eyes streamed endless tears as her entire body locked in shock.

"Mrs. Montgomery?"

"Hiss—" Eleanor clutched her chest with a pained gasp. "So that's why... Now I understand..." Her trembling lips formed a name through the tears. "Evelyn..."

Evelyn's bitter smile mirrored her stinging eyes.

What cruel irony that this revelation came too late.

Eleanor fainted the moment the name left her lips.

Evelyn rushed Eleanor to the hospital after entrusting Ethan to his preschool teacher.

William Montgomery arrived shortly after, frantic with worry.

Unaware of what caused his wife's collapse, he paced anxiously outside the treatment room.

After signing the discharge papers, Evelyn approached the distraught man with a composed smile. "Mr. Montgomery, your wife will be fine. There's no need to worry."

William thanked her as she handed over the medical report.

His concern deepened when he read the diagnosis: acute emotional distress.

"Distress? What could have upset Eleanor so suddenly?"
###Chapter 406

William stared at Vivian Prescott with confusion clouding his features.

"Why did you send my wife to the hospital, Miss Prescott?"

"That's because—"

Before Vivian could explain, heart-wrenching sobs erupted from inside the hospital room.

William's face paled, and he immediately turned to rush inside.

Taking a steadying breath, Vivian followed, her expression carefully composed.

Eleanor had woken—and she was weeping uncontrollably.

William hurried to her side, concern etching deep lines into his forehead. "Eleanor, what's wrong? Why are you crying like this?"

Eleanor finally seemed to register his presence. She lifted her tear-streaked face, her red-rimmed eyes filled with unbearable agony.

"Why is fate so cruel to us, William? Why...?"

Her voice broke as fresh tears spilled down her cheeks.

William's heart pounded with dread. "What are you talking about? Please, don't cry. Just tell me what happened."

Eleanor let out a bitter, broken laugh. Then, with trembling hands, she pulled out a gold pendant from her pocket.

"I found our daughter, William."

"What?" Hope flared in his chest. "You—you really found her? Where is she? Eleanor, where's our little girl?"

His excitement was short-lived. Eleanor closed her eyes, her entire body shaking with grief.

"She's gone. She's dead."

William staggered back as if struck. "Dead? No... that can't be."

"We helped kill her." Eleanor's voice was barely a whisper. "Evelyn Sinclair... she was our daughter."

The words hit William like a physical blow.

His breath left him in a rush, his vision swimming. The joy he'd felt moments ago turned to ash in his mouth.

Evelyn Sinclair—their daughter?

Memories assaulted him. The way he'd once struck her across the face. The way he'd kicked her to the ground to protect that imposter, Victoria.

He remembered how Evelyn had lain there, too broken to even stand.

Why did the memory make his chest ache so violently?

His legs nearly gave out beneath him.

"I finally understand why Victoria had this pendant. I saw it fall from Evelyn's clothes myself! So why did I believe Victoria when she claimed Evelyn stole it?"

Eleanor's voice cracked. "Now I know why Margaret said our daughter died three years ago. That was when Evelyn left us, wasn't it?"

Regret crushed her. She covered her face, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs.

"All these years, I prayed to find my child... only to hurt her, insult her, betray her for that vile woman. What kind of mother does that make me?"

She stared at her hands—the same hands that had struck Evelyn so many times.

Suddenly, Eleanor's expression twisted. She threw off the blankets and bolted for the balcony.

William lunged after her in panic. "Eleanor! Eleanor, stop!"

"Death would be easier, William! Every time I remember what I did to our daughter, I—I can't bear it! I should have died in her place!"

She swung one leg over the railing.

Vivian moved like lightning, grabbing Eleanor just as she tipped forward. "No! Mom, don't!"
###Chapter 407

In a heartbeat, Eleanor and William heard Vivian's desperate cry.

Though she'd been moments away from following her daughter into the abyss, Eleanor spun around at the sound. Tears cascaded down her cheeks as she stared at the woman standing just feet away. The world seemed to blur around her.

Through her shimmering tears, she saw a face identical to the one haunting her memories.

"Your Sophia's still alive, Mom. You don't need to die for me," Vivian said gently, her lips curving into a tender smile. "Come back inside. Dad's worried sick, isn't he?"

"Sophia—" Eleanor whispered, stepping away from the ledge as if in a trance.

William blinked rapidly at Vivian before springing into action. He pulled Eleanor safely inside and immediately locked the balcony door.

"Are you— Are you really Evelyn? Tell me you're Evelyn!" Eleanor rushed forward, clutching Vivian's hands with trembling fingers.

She tried to warm Vivian's hands only to realize her own were ice-cold. Under their desperate gazes, Vivian smiled serenely. "I'm glad you're safe, Mrs. Kingsley. Impulse is a dangerous thing—don't surrender to it again. Your life matters."

The realization hit them like a physical blow. Vivian had only said those words to save Eleanor.

Their brief hope shattered, plunging them back into despair.

Both knew Evelyn had succumbed to an incurable illness.

Perhaps she might have lived longer if they hadn't constantly tormented her. The memory of their cruel words at Alexander and Victoria's engagement party haunted them—how Eleanor had accused Evelyn of faking her collapse, even as blood dripped from her lips.

After her final "performance," Evelyn had left them forever, leaving behind only endless regret.

By the time Vivian left the hospital, Eleanor had no tears left to cry.

Vivian understood the depth of Eleanor's grief. She too had wanted to die when her child was taken from her. That pain had felt like the sky collapsing, turning her world monochrome.

But now, color had returned to her life.

—

Alexander awoke feeling more rested than he had in three years.

His hand reached across the bed, finding the sheets already cool. He immediately dialed Evelyn's number.

Her melodic voice through the speaker instantly soothed him.

He'd wanted to take Evelyn on a honeymoon, but she'd declined due to her pregnancy.

Monday noon, Blackwood Enterprises.

Alexander had just concluded a crucial board meeting when he spotted Evelyn waiting gracefully outside the conference room.

Seeing him emerge, she approached with a thermos in hand. "I made lunch, Alexander. Would you join me?"

Witnessing this, Lucas and the other executives discreetly excused themselves.

Evelyn slipped her arm through his as they entered his office—her first time seeing his workspace.

'So this is where he spends his days,' she thought.
###Chapter 408

The panoramic windows of the executive office offered two breathtaking views.

To one side, the riverbank stretched thick and lush, its waters glinting under the afternoon sun.

To the other, the entire city sprawled beneath, a glittering kingdom visible from this privileged vantage point.

This wasn’t just any office—it was a throne room, and Alexander Blackwood was its undisputed king.

Evelyn Sinclair had once been banished from this space.

Her husband had barred her from entering, yet freely allowed another woman to come and go as she pleased.

The irony twisted her lips into a bitter smile as she quietly unpacked the takeout containers.

She would never tie an apron around her waist for him again. That version of her—the one who had loved him enough to cook, to serve—was gone.

Alexander, oblivious, ate with surprising enthusiasm, not questioning whether Evelyn had prepared the meal herself.

Sunlight streamed through the windows, painting golden streaks across his crisp white shirt, softening the intensity of his dark gaze.

After lunch, Evelyn excused herself to the pantry, returning with a bowl of freshly sliced fruit.

She speared a piece with a fork and lifted it to his lips.

"Is it sweet?" she asked, her voice honeyed.

Alexander nodded, his eyes never leaving her face. If only time would slow—just for this moment.

But fate had other plans. A call interrupted them, forcing him to step away.

Evelyn seized the opportunity, her fingers itching to access his computer. But a glint in the corner of the room froze her in place.

A surveillance camera.

She exhaled sharply. Too risky.

Instead, she busied herself with tidying his desk, deliberately knocking the mouse to the floor.

As she bent to retrieve it, she stole a glance at the locked screen.

No luck.

She clenched her jaw but forced herself to relax. She hadn’t come entirely empty-handed.

Footsteps echoed in the hallway—Alexander returning, but not alone.

Eleanor and William Kingsley followed him inside.

Evelyn’s pulse spiked. They knew.

If they revealed her identity now, everything would unravel.

She schooled her expression into polite indifference. "What a pleasant surprise, Mr. and Mrs. Kingsley."

Their faces lit up at the sight of her, their gazes lingering with unmistakable warmth.

To them, she was more than just a face—she was a balm to their grieving hearts.

"Miss Prescott," Eleanor greeted warmly, reaching for Evelyn’s hands.

Alexander’s brow arched.

Since when had they grown so familiar?

"Please, have a seat," he offered, gesturing to the plush chairs.

Reluctantly, Eleanor released Evelyn’s hands and settled beside her husband.

A secretary arrived with tea, then discreetly vanished.

"What brings you here today?" Alexander cut straight to the point.

Eleanor and William exchanged a glance before she spoke, her voice trembling. "Mr. Blackwood, we have… an unusual request."

"Go on."

"We were wondering," Eleanor began, her fingers tightening around her teacup, "if you might have anything left of Evelyn’s. Personal belongings, perhaps?"

Evelyn’s breath hitched. She had to stop this.

Alexander’s gaze flicked to her before returning to Eleanor. "Why?"

A tear slipped down Eleanor’s cheek. "Because we believe… Evelyn might have been our daughter."
###Chapter 409

Evelyn couldn't react fast enough when Eleanor suddenly blurted out those shocking words.

The air in the office grew thick with tension. Evelyn stole a glance at Alexander's reaction from the corner of her eye. His handsome face showed a complicated mix of emotions - surprise, contemplation, yet an eerie calmness beneath it all.

After a heavy pause, Evelyn broke the silence. "Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery, do you truly believe Evelyn was your biological daughter?"

Eleanor's misty eyes locked onto Evelyn's face with undeniable longing. "We haven't done the DNA test yet, but I'm ninety percent certain Evelyn was our child!"

Her voice trembled with conviction, her fingers clutching the tissue in her lap.

"Miss Prescott has a daughter, doesn't she?" Eleanor asked abruptly.

Evelyn nodded. "Yes."

"When I saw your little girl outside the preschool, it took my breath away. She bears such striking resemblance to how my daughter looked as an infant."

"Now I understand why. Because your daughter looks like you, Miss Prescott. And you... you're practically identical to Evelyn."

Evelyn felt her breath catch in her throat.

So that explained Eleanor's strange reaction upon seeing Amelia that day.

'After all these years, Mother still remembers every detail of my baby face.'

A bittersweet warmth spread through Evelyn's chest.

For nearly three decades without parents, she'd finally tasted what it meant to be truly missed - even if that love remained hidden in shadows.

Her thoughts shattered when William addressed Alexander in a pleading tone. "Mr. Blackwood, I know you've always resented Evelyn. You believed she schemed to trap you into marriage. But now you must see the truth - Evelyn was innocent. Victoria orchestrated everything. And now... now Evelyn's been gone three years..."

William's voice cracked, but he pressed on. "We have no right to ask anything of you. We came today only because you were once married to Evelyn."

"Even if we never get to hold our daughter again in this lifetime, we want her to have her rightful name. She shouldn't remain a wandering spirit without roots..."

Eleanor buried her face in her hands, shoulders shaking with silent sobs.

Evelyn handed her fresh tissues before glancing at Alexander's stony silence. She sighed dramatically.

"Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery, I'm afraid Alexander can't help you."

Her words extinguished the hopeful light in their eyes.

"Before our wedding, I had all of Evelyn's belongings completely removed. There's nothing left for DNA testing."

The couple's expressions crumbled simultaneously.

Yet Eleanor's eyes soon blazed with renewed determination. "Even without proof, I know in my soul that Evelyn was our daughter. If I doubt that now, I don't deserve to call myself her mother."

Wiping her tears, Eleanor stood with fragile dignity. "Thank you, Miss Prescott, Mr. Blackwood. We apologize for disturbing you."

With polite bows, they exited, leaving the office in heavy silence.

Evelyn's chest ached with hollowness.

She forced a smile and turned to Alexander, who sat deep in thought, his dark brows knitted together.

"Alexander, what's troubling you? Shocked that Evelyn might have been a Montgomery?"

He finally lifted his midnight-dark eyes to meet her sparkling gaze. A tender smile curved his lips.

"None of that matters to me. The only thing that does... is you."

'Of course I don't matter. When have I ever?' Evelyn thought bitterly while maintaining her sweet facade. "Don't tease me. I'm being serious."

His gaze burned into hers, voice soft as morning mist. "I've never been more serious about anything in my life."
###Chapter 410

Evelyn's lips curved into a smile, but before she could speak, her phone buzzed.

She glanced at the screen—Sebastian.

Answering naturally, she exchanged a few brief words before ending the call.

"Alexander, there's an issue at the boutique. I need to head back now."

"I'll walk you out."

"No need. We'll see each other tonight." She turned to leave, but his hand caught hers.

When she looked back, questioning, he lowered his head and brushed his lips against hers.

"A parting kiss."

"..."

Despite her initial resistance, Evelyn accepted it with a soft laugh.

As she walked away, the warmth in his expression faded, replaced by something heavier—regret, lingering like an unspoken confession.

Earlier, when Eleanor had whispered that Evelyn might be her biological daughter, the revelation had untangled the knots in Alexander’s mind.

"Lillian..."

The name slipped from his lips, tender yet weighted with longing.

When Evelyn met Sebastian, she relayed everything she’d uncovered.

"Alexander's computer is password-protected. The information won’t be easy to retrieve."

"Just getting you inside his office this quickly is already a breakthrough." Sebastian turned, his dark eyes softening as they traced her features.

"Truthfully, compared to all this, I just wanted to see you."

"Once I get what I need and finish this, I’ll come back to you."

"Will you?" Doubt flickered in his gaze. "You loved him so deeply. Are you sure there’s nothing left?"

Evelyn exhaled, a wry smile touching her lips.

"The depth of my love for him is matched only by my hatred now."

Her gaze drifted toward the distant horizon, where the sea met the sky.

"That love sank to the depths of Pinecrest Heights. It will never resurface in this lifetime."

Meanwhile, Eleanor and William had nearly given up their search for Evelyn’s belongings when Alexander’s call came.

At the meeting point, he handed Eleanor a sealed plastic bag containing a toothbrush.

"This is—?" Her pulse quickened as she took it, realization dawning.

"It’s hers. There should be enough DNA for testing." Alexander’s voice was calm, but his eyes held quiet intensity. "But Vivian can’t know."

Eleanor and William nodded, understanding.

Of course he wouldn’t want his wife discovering he’d kept traces of Evelyn’s past.

After hurried thanks, they rushed to the lab.

From that moment, Alexander’s composure wavered.

With their connections, results would come swiftly.

Night had fallen when his phone rang again. An unknown number.

He answered after a pause.

William’s voice, breathless with excitement, spilled through the line—
###Chapter 411

Alexander gripped his phone tightly, listening as William recounted the identification results word for word.

William's voice was layered with emotions—joy, yet tinged with an inexplicable sorrow beneath it.

As the words sank in, a storm of emotions raged within Alexander's chest.

"Alexander, you're back."

The call hadn't even ended when a sweet voice cut through his thoughts.

He looked up to see Evelyn approaching him, her delicate features sharpening in his dark gaze.

"I was waiting for you to have dinner," she said, reaching for his suit jacket to hang it up.

Alexander quietly ended the call, his eyes never leaving her faintly smiling face.

As she turned away, he suddenly seized her wrist.

Evelyn glanced back, puzzled. "What's wrong?"

"Nothing," he murmured. "I just missed you."

In one swift motion, he pulled her into his arms, his embrace tight, his hands burning against her skin. The intensity of his hidden affection was almost scorching.

Yet, to Evelyn, his touch only fueled her resentment.

She would never forget how coldly he had treated her before.

How many times had he abandoned her in the pouring rain, leaving her heart shattered in the bitter cold? Even now, it remained frozen.

But Alexander, it's hilarious how obsessed you are with a woman who's only pretending. When I gave you my heart, you threw it away.

Now that I'm playing a role, you cling to me like a fool.

Pathetic.

A mocking smile curled her lips.

"I missed you too," she replied flatly, devoid of emotion. "Let's eat. Ethan is waiting."

She pulled away without sparing him another glance.

At dinner, Evelyn doted on Ethan, serving him food and wiping the soup from his lips.

She noticed the boy's smile had grown brighter, the shadows around him fading.

After the meal, she helped him with his homework.

Kindergarten assignments were simple for her, but challenging for a child.

Yet, Evelyn was surprised—Ethan completed them flawlessly without guidance.

She suspected he had inherited Alexander's sharp mind—his memory was remarkable, his intelligence undeniable.

At least, she thought bitterly, he took nothing after Victoria.

The thought made her chest ache.

Where are you, my baby?

Where did Victoria hide you?

I need to find you soon...

The next morning, Alexander dropped Evelyn off at Diamond Boulevard before driving away.

But instead of heading to Blackwood Enterprises, he turned toward the cemetery.

Eleanor and William were already there, dressed in solemn black, white chrysanthemums in hand. Their eyes were red-rimmed.

The late autumn wind was biting, slicing through the silence of the nearly empty graveyard.

Only the rustling of fallen leaves filled the air.
###Chapter 412

Eleanor and William followed Alexander with heavy steps. Their destination was the shattered remains of what had once been a grave.

Eleanor's breath hitched. "This... This is where Evelyn was buried?"

Her hands trembled as she took in the devastation.

The grave had been obliterated, the tombstone reduced to fragments beyond repair.

"Victoria did this," Alexander stated coldly.

Rage flickered in Eleanor and William's eyes, but it was quickly drowned by overwhelming grief.

Eleanor set down the bouquet she carried and knelt beside the scattered debris.

Her fingers brushed against a small piece of broken stone, cradling it as if it were something precious.

Tears fell silently, staining the cold fragments beneath her.

"My sweet girl..."

William knelt beside her, wrapping an arm around her shoulders as silent sobs wracked his body.

If only they hadn't despised Evelyn so fiercely—if only they had shown her even a fraction of kindness—perhaps this guilt wouldn't be crushing them now.

Alexander watched them, his dark eyes no longer carrying the hollow emptiness they once had when he stood in this very place.

After a long moment, Eleanor steadied herself and rose.

"Where are Evelyn's ashes? I'll rebuild her resting place properly."

"Victoria stole them. I still don't know where they are."

"What?!"

William's face twisted in disbelief. "Why would she do something so vile?"

Eleanor's hands clenched into fists. "That woman... She destroyed Evelyn in life, and now she won't even let her rest in death? I'll make her tell us where the ashes are!"

She turned sharply, but Alexander's voice stopped her.

"Don't bother. She won't tell you anything."

Eleanor froze, her eyes shimmering with bitter regret.

"Mr. Blackwood, I know you hated Evelyn. You probably don't care where her ashes are. I wouldn't have either, before... but now..."

Her voice cracked.

"She was my daughter. How can I let her remain lost even in death?"

A faint smile touched Alexander's lips.

The world thought Evelyn had loved him blindly, but only he knew the depth of his love for her.

His calm wasn't indifference—it was certainty.

"Before you confront Victoria, there's somewhere else you should see."

He turned, his long strides carrying him forward.

After a brief hesitation, Eleanor and William followed.

Alexander led them to the grave of Henry Whitmore.

Eleanor's brows furrowed as she read the name on the tombstone. When she saw that Evelyn had been the one to erect it, shock rippled through her.

"Grandfather?"

Her own father had lived abroad for years—he had never set foot in Willowbrook.

"He was the only family Evelyn had growing up," Alexander explained.

Eleanor and William exchanged glances, gratitude softening their expressions.

"So this kind man raised her..." Eleanor bowed deeply before the grave.

Then, something clicked in her mind.

"Henry Whitmore... That name... I've seen it before."

She frowned, searching her memories.

Then it struck her.

"I remember! There was something with this name at home!"
###Chapter 413

Eleanor's words made Alexander and William exchange startled glances.

Though Vivian had been calling Henry Whitmore her grandfather, everyone knew he wasn't truly related to her by blood.

So how did Eleanor recognize that name?

"Eleanor, are you certain you've seen this name at home?" William asked, bewildered.

He mentally ran through every servant, relative, and acquaintance—none matched the name Henry Whitmore.

Eleanor nodded firmly. "With Beatrice!"

"Beatrice?" Alexander's brow furrowed slightly.

"She's our housekeeper. She started working for us in her twenties—that was thirty-two years ago." Eleanor's voice grew more urgent as a realization dawned on her. "I saw Henry Whitmore's name among her things."

"Beatrice's full name is Beatrice Caldwell, but..." Eleanor's breath hitched as the implication struck her.

"William, could it be...? We need to question her immediately!"

She grabbed William's arm, pulling him toward the door.

Alexander's gaze lingered on the tombstone before shifting to the retreating couple. The puzzle pieces in his mind were finally clicking into place.

He looked up at the overcast sky, where a single golden ray pierced through the gloom.

Perhaps fate hadn't abandoned him after all.

The drive back was tense for Eleanor and William.

The moment they stepped into the manor, Beatrice emerged from the kitchen with a steaming bowl of soup.

"Madam, perfect timing. I made this specially for you." Beatrice's expression turned remorseful. "I'm so sorry for hurting you before—all because of that wretched woman."

Eleanor bit back her immediate interrogation. Seeing Beatrice's apparent sincerity, she forced a calm smile.

"I know you didn't mean it. But whether it's Vivian or Evelyn, neither is the villain you believe them to be."

Beatrice's eyes darkened. "Evelyn? That scheming viper murdered Sophia! She should've rotted in prison years ago!"

The venom in her voice made William and Eleanor stiffen. They couldn't tolerate anyone slandering their precious daughter.

Especially when Evelyn was completely innocent.

Sophia's death three years ago had been conclusively proven unrelated to Evelyn.

Swallowing her anger, Eleanor kept her tone light. "Beatrice, you truly loved Sophia. Sometimes I think you cared for her more than I did."

At the mention of Sophia, Beatrice's face softened with maternal pride.

"I raised Miss Sophia from infancy. Of course I adored such a beautiful, clever girl." Her expression then twisted violently. "Until that jealous witch Evelyn stabbed her to death!"

Watching Beatrice's face contort with hatred, Eleanor and William shared a knowing look.

"The person responsible for Sophia's death will face justice," Eleanor said soothingly, patting Beatrice's hand. "You've been under strain. Perhaps a visit home would help? Isn't your father there—Henry Whitmore, if I recall?"

The name made Beatrice freeze. Panic flashed across her face.

"Th-that's not necessary, Madam! I'm perfectly fine!" She fumbled with her apron, backing away hastily. "Please enjoy the soup. I have chores to attend to."

Eleanor's eyes blazed with excitement as Beatrice fled. William squeezed her hand reassuringly.

"Her reaction confirms it. She's hiding something."

"I can't wait another second!" Eleanor's voice trembled. "William, what if our daughter suffered because of—"

William's jaw tightened. Suddenly, he pulled out his phone and dialed Alexander.

Alexander had just returned to Blackwood Enterprises when the call came through. He listened with growing interest to William's request.

At that exact moment, Evelyn walked into his office, carrying his lunch.
###Chapter 414

Her lips curved into a radiant smile, her sharp eyes sparkling like constellations in the night sky.

After ending the call, Alexander rose from his seat and approached Evelyn. "Vivian, William and Eleanor Kingsley have invited us to dinner tonight."

Evelyn paused mid-motion as she arranged his lunch. "Why the sudden invitation?"

"They have a request," Alexander explained, his gaze steady. "They're hoping for your help."

He relayed the details of the unusual demand, watching her reaction carefully.

Evelyn turned, her delicate fingers tugging playfully at his tie. A mischievous, alluring grin danced on her lips.

"Since it's you asking, I'll agree."

Alexander's pulse quickened as he admired the brilliance in her eyes.

The evening sun cast golden fragments of light through the trees as they arrived at the Kingsley estate, hand in hand.

Eleanor and William had been waiting. The moment Evelyn's face came into view, their expressions softened with longing and bittersweet joy.

This face—identical to their lost daughter's—was both a comfort and a torment.

"Miss Prescott, Mr. Blackwood, please sit." Eleanor greeted them warmly, her gaze lingering on Evelyn. "You grow more beautiful each time I see you. I apologize for imposing on you tonight."

"Just call me Vivian," Evelyn replied smoothly, though irony twisted in her chest.

Once, she had stood before them with this same face—only to be met with cruelty.

Human hearts were fickle. Human nature, unpredictable.

In the kitchen, Beatrice Caldwell stiffened at the sound of guests arriving. Peering out, she froze.

Her?

Rage ignited in her veins. "This is the 'esteemed guest' Madam spoke of? That wretched woman isn't fit to lick my Sophia's shoes!"

Clenching her jaw, she forced a smile and carried out a steaming bowl of soup.

"Miss Prescott," she said sweetly, "I owe you an apology for mistaking you before. I hope you can forgive me."

Evelyn arched a brow, her demeanor shifting to icy arrogance. "You again? Why are you still employed here, Mrs. Kingsley? After nearly causing your mistress to bleed to death?"

Beatrice's face darkened.

"Beatrice has served our family for decades," Eleanor said gently. "We've moved past that incident."

"Kindness is often exploited," Evelyn countered coolly, eyeing the soup. "Did she prepare this? I won't drink it. Who knows what she might have slipped inside?"

Beatrice's hands trembled. "I'll return to the kitchen," she muttered before storming off.

Evelyn watched her go, then stood.

Alexander frowned. "Vivian—"

But she was already striding toward the kitchen.

Inside, Beatrice slammed a knife into a slab of meat, her voice a venomous hiss.

"Evelyn, you vile creature! Vivian Prescott? Don't make me laugh! You're Evelyn Sinclair! You murdered my Sophia and still walk free? I'll make you pay—"

"Such hatred," Evelyn's voice cut through the air as she stepped inside. "I had no idea you despised me this much."

Beatrice whirled, knife in hand, eyes blazing. "Evelyn! You think I'd believe this act? You're her! You killed Miss Sophia! You deserve to burn in hell!"

Evelyn smirked, crossing her arms. Her stance was cold, regal. Unshaken.

"Sharp eyes. You're right—I'm not Vivian." She leaned in, her whisper lethal. "I'm Evelyn Sinclair."
###Chapter 415

"You've got sharp eyes. That's correct, I'm not Vivian at all. I'm Evelyn!"

Alexander, standing just outside the kitchen, heard every word. A flicker of something shattered in his ocean-deep eyes, condensing into a silent tidal wave that crashed violently in his chest. Yet he remained motionless, his expression unreadable.

Beatrice, however, exploded the moment the words left Evelyn's lips.

"It really is you! You're that wretched Evelyn Sinclair!"

She brandished the kitchen knife in her hand, pointing it straight at Evelyn. Her furious eyes burned with hatred, as if she wanted to tear Evelyn apart with her bare hands.

"I'll make you pay for what you did to my Sophia today!"

"Your Sophia? That was Mrs. Montgomery's daughter. What does she have to do with you?" Evelyn's voice was ice-cold. "I never laid a finger on Sophia. Even if I had killed her, it should be Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery seeking revenge. Who are you—a mere servant—to come after me?"

"Who says I don't have the right?" Beatrice's voice trembled with barely contained rage. "No one in this world has more right to make you pay than I do!"

Her emotions had spiraled out of control, her mental state teetering on the edge. Evelyn's words had struck a nerve, exposing a raw wound she had kept hidden for years.

"Evelyn, you heartless witch. How dare you say I have no right?" Beatrice's voice cracked. "I am the one who deserves justice for Sophia! You murdered my precious daughter! Today, I'll make you pay with your life!"

With a guttural scream, Beatrice lunged forward, knife raised.

In that split second, Eleanor and William both rushed forward to intercept her. Alexander moved faster, pulling Evelyn into his arms and shielding her with his body as he swiftly moved them out of harm's way.

William wrestled the knife from Beatrice's grip and tossed it aside.

Beatrice collapsed to her knees, screaming like a madwoman. "Evelyn, you vile creature! I'll kill you! I swear I'll kill you to avenge my daughter!"

"So you finally admit Sophia was your child!" Eleanor's sharp words cut through Beatrice's hysteria like a blade.

Beatrice froze, her wild eyes widening as reality crashed back down on her.

She looked around at the faces staring back at her—Eleanor's fury, William's disgust, Alexander's cold detachment, and Evelyn's mocking smirk.

She shook her head violently. "M-Madam, you're mistaken. How could Miss Sophia be my daughter?" Her voice was desperate now, her gaze darting to Evelyn, who stood safely wrapped in Alexander's embrace. "It's this devil who provoked me! I—I only wanted justice for Miss Sophia!"

"Stop lying!" Eleanor's voice trembled with barely suppressed rage. Tears welled in her eyes. "I trusted you, and this is how you betrayed me?"

Beatrice feigned innocence. "Madam, what are you accusing me of? You'd believe this witch over me?"

Evelyn let out a soft, mocking laugh.

"You keep screaming about avenging Sophia, about being the one with the most right to punish me," she said, stepping out of Alexander's protective hold. "Yet you won't even acknowledge your own daughter in the end."

Her voice dripped with disdain. "That alone makes you unworthy of being a mother—and even more unworthy of seeking justice for her."

Beatrice's face twisted with renewed fury.

"You—Evelyn—you—!"

"I'm not Evelyn," she corrected smoothly. "I was merely helping Mr. and Mrs. Montgomery expose the truth."

Beatrice's face paled as realization dawned. This had all been a trap.

But this woman looked exactly like Evelyn. How could she not be her?

"Are you still refusing to confess?" Eleanor demanded, her voice breaking. She needed to know how her daughter had been taken from her—or rather, how she had been switched.

Beatrice clenched her jaw, her lips pressed into a thin, stubborn line.

Seeing her refusal to speak, Evelyn's eyes glinted with cunning. She took a deliberate step forward.
###Chapter 416

"How absurd. You gave such a passionate speech about avenging your daughter, yet now you won't even acknowledge her as your own."

"..."

"Sophia may have lived as a wealthy heiress, but she was truly unfortunate to have a mother like you. Not once in her life did she get to call her real mother 'Mom.' Even in death, she finds no peace. And you'll carry this regret to your grave."

"Shut your mouth! Just stop talking!" Beatrice Caldwell's composure shattered. She sprang up, hand raised toward Vivian Prescott.

Alexander Blackwood's arm shot out like a viper, crushing her wrist mid-air before shoving her away.

Beatrice collapsed onto the marble floor.

"Lay another finger on Vivian, and I'll reduce Sophia's grave to rubble."

What?!

Beatrice trembled violently. She scrambled forward on her knees, clutching at Alexander's trousers with ashen lips. "Mr. Blackwood, please! Don't desecrate Sophia's resting place! I was wrong—I'll never dare touch her again!"

"Prove it by confessing everything. Or you'll live to regret your silence."

Beatrice froze mid-plea, hesitation flashing across her face.

But the glacial authority in Alexander's obsidian eyes made her blood run cold.

She'd heard Victoria whisper how Alexander had murdered Vivian's child. If that were true, what wouldn't this man do?

"Still refusing to speak?" Alexander's voice dropped to lethal softness.

Beatrice shuddered. Her terrified gaze darted between Eleanor and William Kingsley's furious expressions before she finally gritted out, "Fine! You're right—Sophia was my biological daughter... Back then, Mrs. Kingsley and I were pregnant simultaneously, delivering just two days apart. I envied the Kingsleys' wealth and status so bitterly that...I switched our babies."

The confession punched the air from Eleanor's lungs. William staggered back as if struck.

Vivian appeared composed, but a hurricane raged beneath her calm surface.

'So my parents didn't lose me through carelessness. I was stolen.'

Tears streamed down Eleanor's face as she forced out the question through trembling lips: "Then where...where did you take my real daughter?"

Beatrice lifted her chin defiantly. "Don't worry, Madam. I didn't sell her or abandon her. I sent her to my sister in the countryside!"

"You vile creature!" William roared.

Beatrice actually had the gall to look offended. "Mister, while my methods were...unorthodox, my sister is kind! Your daughter wanted for nothing—good food, warm clothes—"

CRACK! Eleanor's palm connected with Beatrice's cheek. "You inhuman monster! You condemned my daughter to peasantry so yours could live in luxury, then have the audacity to tell me not to worry?"

Eleanor's voice broke. "My daughter was born to be a Kingsley! She should have attended elite schools, worn designer gowns, been the jewel of high society! Because of your greed, she never knew a single day of the life she deserved!"

Beatrice actually rolled her eyes. "Madam, you're being dramatic. My sister raised her well! If it bothers you so much, I'll have her returned immediately. She can still play heiress. But my Sophia—my poor Sophia—"

"Return her? You speak as if she's some misplaced trinket! My daughter can't come back—she's dead! And you helped kill her!"

Beatrice's jaw dropped. "W-what? The young miss is...dead?"

"Yes. She was Vivian Prescott—the woman you keep threatening to kill. Vivian Prescott was our biological daughter!"
###Chapter 417

Beatrice Caldwell froze in shock, her face draining of color. She shook her head violently, refusing to accept the truth.

"No! That can't be! Impossible! How could that wretched woman be Madam’s daughter? She doesn’t deserve it! She’s unworthy of being a Montgomery! She’s nothing but trash—"

"Enough!" Eleanor Kingsley snapped, her voice trembling with fury. "How dare you speak of my daughter like that? If she’s unworthy, then what does that make you? After all the despicable, shameless things you’ve done, you still have the audacity to judge her? Beatrice, you have no humanity, no conscience. You don’t even deserve to be called human!"

Eleanor’s words were sharp, each one laced with venom. The thought of what Evelyn Sinclair must have endured all these years because of Beatrice’s treachery made her chest ache unbearably.

"Eleanor, what’s wrong?" William Montgomery caught her as she swayed, his grip tight with concern.

Tears spilled down Eleanor’s cheeks as she clutched her chest. "William, it hurts. It hurts so much. Our daughter should have had a life of comfort and happiness. Instead, she was—"

Her voice broke, her tear-filled eyes burning with rage as she glared at Beatrice.

"From the moment you stepped into the Montgomery household, have I ever treated you poorly? I gave you kindness, helped you build a life, even arranged your marriage! And how did you repay me? With betrayal! With cruelty!"

"Sophia was a good girl. Even after we discovered she wasn’t ours, we never mistreated her. But you? What did you do to my child? If not for your scheming, my Evelyn would still be alive!"

Beatrice’s lips twisted in defiance. "Madam, I never intended for things to turn out this way. I gave Evelyn to my sister—she was supposed to take care of her!"

Her voice dripped with bitterness. "But your daughter killed mine. Even in death, she carries the weight of her sins. She got what she deserved! My Sophia was the true victim here!"

"You—!"

Eleanor and William were seething.

The sheer audacity of Beatrice’s words was staggering.

After committing such unforgivable acts, she still had the nerve to play the victim.

"Beatrice, listen to me! My daughter never harmed anyone. She was innocent! Sophia’s death was not her doing! But you—you murdered my child! You destroyed her with your greed and malice!"

Eleanor’s composure shattered. Years of suppressed grief and fury poured out in a torrent.

"You claim you want justice for your daughter? Fine. Then I will have justice for mine. You will answer for every vile thing you’ve done!"

With one last scathing look, Eleanor turned and stormed away.

William wasted no time. He called the police immediately.

Within minutes, officers arrived. William recounted the entire sordid tale, and Beatrice was dragged away, still screaming about her daughter’s innocence, blind to the devastation she had wrought.

The house fell into silence, but the air remained heavy with sorrow.

Evelyn exchanged a quiet word with Alexander Blackwood before heading upstairs to Eleanor’s room.

Outside the door, she heard muffled sobs.

A sharp pang of sympathy twisted in her chest.

Taking a steadying breath, Evelyn knocked lightly. "Mrs. Montgomery? Are you alright?"

The crying stopped abruptly. A moment later, Eleanor’s strained voice answered. "Miss Prescott, please come in."

Evelyn stepped inside to find Eleanor hastily wiping her tears, forcing a weak smile. Her eyes were red-rimmed, her face pale.

The sight tugged at Evelyn’s heart.

"Mrs. Montgomery, please don’t grieve like this. If your daughter could see you now, she wouldn’t want you to suffer for her sake."

Eleanor’s composure crumbled. Fresh tears spilled over as she gazed at Evelyn, her hand trembling as she reached out to gently brush Evelyn’s cheek.

The warmth of the touch sent an inexplicable ache through Evelyn’s chest.
###Chapter 418

"Evelyn..."

Eleanor's lips trembled as she whispered the name.

Evelyn froze, recognizing it as her birth name.

"Your father and I... we're so sorry." Eleanor's voice cracked. "You were right in front of us all along, yet we were blind. We hurt you, over and over, for that monster Victoria—"

"I know nothing can make up for what we've done. If there's another life, I swear I'll spend it making amends—"

Tears streamed down Eleanor's face as she suddenly pulled Evelyn into a crushing embrace.

"My Evelyn... my precious girl..." she sobbed into Evelyn's shoulder.

The moment felt surreal. Grief and regret blurred Eleanor's vision, making Evelyn's familiar features swim before her eyes.

Evelyn allowed the embrace, her normally composed eyes glistening with unshed tears.

This warmth—this was a mother's love. Something she'd spent her whole life unknowingly craving.

When Eleanor finally released her, she wiped her cheeks hastily. "Forgive me, Miss Prescott. I lost control." She straightened with dignity. "Thank you for tonight. Without you, Beatrice would never have confessed."

Evelyn offered a small smile. "It was nothing, really."

She rose gracefully, her expression settling back into its usual calm mask. "You should rest, Mrs. Kingsley. Alexander and I will take our leave now."

"Let me walk you out."

Eleanor's gaze remained tender as she escorted them to the grand entrance.

The car disappeared down the tree-lined drive, yet Eleanor and William remained rooted in place.

Regret gnawed at them. Only by memorizing Evelyn's face could they ease their guilty consciences.

But some wounds never heal.

The car ride home...

Even after her shower, Evelyn's mind still churned.

As a child, she'd envied others with parents. She'd cursed fate, cursed the parents who'd supposedly abandoned her. Yet all along, they'd loved her. Missed her.

The realization sent warmth flooding through her battered heart.

Then her thoughts turned to tonight's revelations.

'Beatrice claimed she gave me to her sister. But my earliest memories are only of Grandpa Henry. No one else.'

'Beatrice Caldwell... Henry Whitmore... What connects them?'

So absorbed was she that she didn't hear the approaching footsteps.

Alexander studied Evelyn's pensive silhouette against the balcony doors. "Evelyn," he murmured, stepping closer.

Startled from her thoughts, she turned. "Hmm?"
###Chapter 419

Evelyn spun around, her breath catching when she saw the man standing mere feet away.

She hadn't realized she'd instinctively responded to him calling her "Evie"—a name only one person had ever used.

Alexander's dark, unreadable gaze locked onto hers. Evelyn composed herself swiftly, a practiced smile curving her lips.

"Evie?" She laughed lightly, tilting her head. "Don't tell me you're still caught up in last night's performance like Mrs. Kingsley? I'm Vivian now, remember?"

Her tone was playful, but her fingers tightened imperceptibly around the magazine in her hands. She stepped closer, the scent of his cologne wrapping around her like a ghost of the past.

"Though I must say, I never expected you to call Evelyn so affectionately. Wasn't she the woman you despised?"

Alexander didn't flinch. He simply watched her, his expression inscrutable as she moved past him to sit on the bed, flipping idly through the pages.

"Quite the twist, wasn't it?" she mused. "Evelyn being the Kingsleys' real daughter all along. Switched at birth by some scheming maid." A bitter chuckle escaped her. "Pity the truth came too late. She's already gone."

Alexander sat beside her, his presence overwhelming even in silence. His eyes traced the delicate curve of her profile.

"The truth still came," he said quietly.

Evelyn's fingers stilled on the page. A cold smile touched her lips. "And what good does that do? Can it undo the lies? The pain?" She lifted her gaze, the warmth draining from her voice. "Look at Evelyn. Slandered. Betrayed. Used by everyone—especially you, the man she loved."

Her next words were daggers. "She's dead, Alexander. Your remorse changes nothing."

The word "dead" struck him like a physical blow. His jaw tightened, but his eyes never left hers—those brilliant, familiar eyes that haunted his dreams.

"If she weren't," he asked hoarsely, "would she ever forgive those who wronged her?"

Evelyn set the magazine aside. "If life could be rewritten?" She met his gaze squarely. "The only thing she'd wish is to have never met you. Some scars never fade. Forgiveness isn't impossible—but trust? That's gone forever."

The raw honesty in her words left Alexander hollow. The ache behind his ribs swelled until it threatened to choke him.

He'd never realized how much casual words could eviscerate a soul.

How many times had he torn into her with cruelty? How many wounds had he carved into her heart, only to expect her to keep loving him?

Forgive?

You don't deserve it, Alexander Blackwood.

The next morning, after dropping Ethan at school, Evelyn slid into her car, ready to resume her search for clues about her lost child.

A news alert buzzed on her phone.

She tapped the screen—and froze.

The video showed Eleanor and William Kingsley at a Montgomery Enterprises press conference, their faces drawn but resolute.

"We confirm today," William announced, voice cracking, "that Evelyn Sinclair was our biological daughter, stolen from us nearly thirty years ago."

Eleanor's hands trembled as she added, "And the woman who pretended to be her—Victoria Lancaster—is nothing but a fraud."

The camera zoomed in as Eleanor's composure shattered. A single tear slipped free before she steeled herself, lifting her chin with regal dignity.

Evelyn watched until the end.

She was smiling.

But her cheeks were wet.
###Chapter 420

The phone vibrated in Evelyn's hand, Sebastian's name flashing on the screen. She took a steadying breath before answering. His voice, smooth as velvet, wrapped around her. "Are you alright? Did you see the footage?"

A bitter smile curved her lips. "Just finished watching. Thank you for checking on me. I'm fine."

"They clearly adore you," Sebastian murmured, defending Eleanor and William's actions. "They were just... misled before."

"Adore?"

The word tasted foreign on her tongue. A hollow laugh escaped her. "Sebastian, I'm coming to you. We need to discuss the plan."

The call ended, and Evelyn wasted no time. Within minutes, she was speeding toward the secluded villa Sebastian now called home.

When she arrived, he greeted her with a steaming cup of Earl Grey, his gaze tender yet shadowed. "I want this over with," he admitted, fingers tightening around his own cup. "The thought of you sharing his bed every night—it unsettles me."

Evelyn sipped the tea, warmth spreading through her chest. "Don't worry. Alexander may have married me, may even feel something for me, but this face?" She touched her cheek lightly. "It's the one he despises most. He won't touch me."

Sebastian's smile didn't reach his eyes. "He probably knows now—how you were framed, how you suffered. Guilt consumes him, but it's too late to atone for the dead. So he clings to you instead." His gaze drifted to the withered roses in the garden, voice dropping. "It's human nature. He apologizes not for you, but for himself."

"His guilt means nothing to me," Evelyn said coolly. "All I want is my child back and access to his files. Once we crack his system, we get what we need."

"Perhaps we're taking too long," Sebastian mused, a cryptic glint in his eyes. "I've nearly secured the board. Alexander holds seventy percent of Blackwood Enterprises. Those shares in our hands? The company falls."

Evelyn's mind raced. "I know what to do."

Sebastian studied her, his expression softening. "Vivian... will you regret this?"

She shook her head, a sad smile playing on her lips. "My only regret is loving him too deeply—and realizing it too late."

Her phone buzzed again. Eleanor's name appeared.

Though Eleanor didn't know her true identity, Evelyn did. And she couldn't bring herself to ignore the call.

She answered. Eleanor's voice trembled with emotion. "Miss Vivian, are you free? William and I... we have a favor to ask."

"I have time," Evelyn agreed, rising.

As she left, Sebastian lifted the cup she'd drunk from, his smile twisting into something pained.

"You'll hate me one day," he whispered to the empty room. "But you'll never know... I was never the gentleman you believed me to be."

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn arrived at the café Eleanor had specified. The older couple rushed forward the moment she stepped out of the car.

"Miss Vivian, thank you for coming," Eleanor gushed, clasping her hands.

William nodded eagerly. "We're so grateful."

Evelyn offered a polite smile. "What is it you need?"
###Chapter 421

"Look over there." Eleanor pointed to a spot not far away, her eyes suddenly clouded with sorrow. "My daughter is gone, and I know I can never make up for that loss. This is the only way I can ease my regret, even if just a little."

William's voice was gentle, yet filled with quiet desperation. "We understand this is selfish of us, Miss Vivian. If you're unwilling, we won't force you."

Evelyn glanced at the photo studio ahead and smiled faintly.

So this was their request—to borrow her face for a family portrait.

Sebastian had been right. Some apologies weren't about sincerity. They were about easing one's own guilt.

Would taking this picture truly bring them peace? And what would it do to her?

A bitter chuckle escaped her lips. Closing her eyes, she could still see the cold indifference in Eleanor and William's eyes from years ago.

She had given them enough.

"I'm sorry," Evelyn said firmly. "I can't agree to this. I won't be a stand-in for Evelyn Sinclair. Her life was tragic enough—I refuse to relive it or be tied to her in any way."

Eleanor and William's expressions crumbled, their hearts hollow with grief.

"Miss Vivian, please don't misunderstand," Eleanor hurried to explain, forcing a shaky smile despite the tears welling in her eyes. "We're not trying to replace her. It's alright if you refuse. We were asking too much."

William nodded, his voice thick with regret. "You've already helped us more than we deserve. We were thoughtless."

"Miss Vivian," Eleanor added softly, "you're brilliant and kind. Mr. Blackwood clearly values you. I know you won't suffer the same fate as my daughter. I truly wish you happiness."

Her voice cracked as she wiped her tears. "Let's not trouble Miss Vivian anymore. William, perhaps you should see her home?"

"No need," Evelyn replied with a polite smile. Turning away, she walked off without hesitation.

'I thought I could be heartless. But seeing their grief still cuts deep.'

She hadn't gone far when Eleanor's voice carried behind her.

"William, let's go to the detention center first. We need to ask Victoria about Evelyn's ashes."

Evelyn's steps faltered.

'My ashes are missing?'

"That vile woman!" William's voice was laced with fury. "She desecrated Evelyn's grave and stole her remains. How could anyone be so twisted?"

Evelyn's mind reeled.

'Victoria destroyed my grave? She took my ashes?'

A memory surfaced—Alexander taking her to the cemetery, his eyes wild with anguish as he searched through the wreckage of a shattered tombstone.

'Was he looking for my ashes?

'Was that my grave?'

The realization struck like a blade, tearing through her chest.

Honk!

A blaring horn shattered her thoughts.

She blinked—somehow, she had wandered into the middle of the road.

Before she could react, strong arms yanked her back to safety.

"Miss Vivian, are you alright?" William's voice was laced with concern as he steadied her.
###Chapter 422

Eleanor rushed over, her eyes wide with concern. "Miss Vivian, why did you suddenly dash into the street? It's so dangerous! Are you hurt?"

The words snapped Evelyn back to reality. She shook her head. "I was lost in thought. Thank you, but I should go now."

Eleanor and William exchanged uneasy glances, sensing something off about Evelyn's demeanor. But before they could say more, she had already flagged down a taxi and slipped inside.

The car pulled up in front of Blackwood Enterprises. During the ride, Evelyn couldn't shake the unsettling thoughts swirling in her mind.

Could it really be?

The grave Alexander showed me that day—it couldn’t possibly be mine.

He despises me. Why would he bother giving me a resting place? And why would he lose his mind searching for my ashes?

Stepping toward the building’s entrance, she was abruptly jolted by a sharp collision. A wave of overpowering perfume assaulted her senses.

"Watch where you're going!" A haughty voice cut through the air.

Evelyn lifted her gaze to meet a striking woman with tumbling waves of lavender hair, her outfit daring and her makeup flawless from a distance. Up close, however, the heavy scent and garish accessories betrayed a lack of refinement.

The woman’s eyes gleamed with arrogance. "Do you have any idea who I am? I’m one of the most important women in Mr. Blackwood’s life. You can’t afford to cross me!"

Evelyn arched a brow. "You ran into me."

"If you hadn’t been standing in my way, this wouldn’t have happened!" The woman scoffed, flipping her hair before strutting off.

One of Alexander’s most important women?

Evelyn smirked at the retreating figure but didn’t bother pursuing the argument. Instead, she headed for the private elevator.

When she reached Alexander’s office, she found him bathed in golden sunlight, his sharp features softened by the glow. The rare sight of him in a crisp white shirt made him look almost approachable—an illusion, she knew.

Remembering his preference, she slipped into the pantry to brew his coffee.

But fate had other plans.

The moment she stepped out, that same cloying perfume filled the air—followed by another collision.

Clatter.

The coffee cup shattered on the floor.

"My designer coat!" the woman shrieked, glaring at Evelyn. "You again!"

She jabbed a manicured finger toward the mess. "Just wait until Mr. Blackwood hears about this! You’re finished, you clumsy secretary!"

Secretary?

Evelyn glanced down at her outfit. Had she dressed too formally today?

The commotion drew Alexander’s attention. He strode over, his commanding presence filling the space.

The woman’s demeanor instantly shifted. "Cousin Alexander!" she cooed, batting her lashes. "I missed you so much! I flew here the moment I finished my thesis!"

Then, with a venomous glance at Evelyn, she pouted. "But this employee ruined everything! She bumped into me twice and spilled coffee on my coat! She didn’t even apologize. You have to fire her!"

Alexander’s gaze flicked between them, unreadable.

Evelyn merely crossed her arms, waiting.

The game was on.
###Chapter 423

Her finger jabbed arrogantly toward Evelyn before she moved to embrace him.

But just as her arms extended, Alexander sidestepped her with icy indifference, striding past to reach Evelyn instead.

"Cousin Alexander?" Yvonne Yalemen gaped at his retreating back, utterly ignored.

Alexander's gaze flickered to the spilled coffee pooling on the marble floor before settling on Evelyn with concern. "Are you hurt? Did it scald you?"

Evelyn's lips curved slightly. "Not hot enough for burns, but..." She paused meaningfully, eyes locking onto the woman whose expression had soured. "This lady deliberately collided with me twice. My shoulder's throbbing."

Yvonne's face flushed crimson. "Cousin Alexander, that's absurd! She's the one who—" Her protest died as Alexander cut her off with a glacial stare.

"I should teach you manners if you can't control that venomous tongue."

Yvonne's mouth snapped shut. Her eyes bulged when Alexander took Evelyn's hand possessively.

"Cousin! Why are you—since when do you hold hands with staff?" she spluttered.

"Must I seek your permission to touch my wife?" Alexander countered coldly.

"Wife?" Yvonne recoiled. "But that wretched Evelyn Sinclair died years ago! When did you remarry? Why wasn't I informed?"

Evelyn's fingers twitched at the venom in Yvonne's tone. So this was how Margaret Blackwood had painted her—a villainess even in death.

The injustice burned. Condemned without trial, slandered by those who knew nothing of the truth.

Alexander's warning glare silenced Yvonne mid-tirade. Steering Evelyn toward his office, he shut the door firmly in his cousin's face.

"Vile seductress!" Yvonne hissed, rubbing her forehead where the glass door had smacked her. "Cousin Alexander! Let me in!" Her pounding went unanswered.

Evelyn arched a brow. "Your cousin seems... invested. Downstairs, she claimed to be the most significant woman in your life."

Alexander cradled her face. "The only woman who matters stands before me now."

"Truly?" Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes.

"My maternal uncle's daughter," he explained tersely.

Evelyn nodded. The possessive glint in Yvonne's eyes spoke volumes—this was no simple cousinly affection.

She wouldn't let this complication derail her plans. "Alexander, I'd like to shadow you these coming weeks. Learn corporate strategy firsthand. Lady Belle thrives, but my management skills need polishing."

"Anything you desire," he agreed instantly.

Evelyn rested her head against his shoulder, the picture of devotion. "You're too good to me." The sweetness in her voice was saccharine, masking the acid beneath.

As his personal secretary that afternoon, Evelyn studied not business ledgers, but the man who held 70% of Blackwood Enterprises' shares—her true objective.
###Chapter 424

Alexander had just ended his afternoon conference when Margaret Blackwood's call came through.

"Alexander, Sophia's returned from Paris. She's hosting a welcome dinner at the estate tonight. You must attend."

Before he could protest, the line went dead.

Normally, Alexander would never waste time on such trivial gatherings. But Evelyn had unexpectedly volunteered to accompany him.

While Alexander parked the car, Evelyn waited by the wrought iron gates. That's when she overheard Margaret's venomous whisper from inside.

"That woman may resemble Evelyn, but she's ten times more cunning. I can't fathom what spell she's cast over Alexander - he obeys her every whim!"

Sophia's saccharine voice chimed in, "Aunt Margaret, she deliberately provoked me today, then told Cousin Alexander I started it! How could he fall for such a schemer? We must separate them."

"Easier said than done. She's carrying his child now."

"Pregnant?" Sophia gasped. Her next words died as her expression shifted abruptly. "Cousin! You're here!"

She rose gracefully, her sickly-sweet tone returning. But when Evelyn appeared beside Alexander, Sophia's smile froze before reforming into something brittle. "Sister-in-law, my deepest apologies about this morning. I'll watch my step more carefully."

Evelyn's lips curved without warmth. "You should watch your tongue as well. Or this 'scheming woman' might take offense."

Sophia's mouth worked soundlessly, humiliation staining her cheeks.

Alexander's stormy gaze swept over his cousin as he protectively guided Evelyn inside.

Damn it! Sophia seethed silently, not daring to speak her mind in Alexander's presence.

The estate felt hollow without Reginald Blackwood's presence. Old Master Blackwood remained upstairs, his health declining.

Concern tightened Evelyn's chest. Henry Blackwood had been her sole ally during those dark years. She'd hoped to check on him tonight.

"I'm visiting Grandfather," Evelyn announced, accepting a tea tray from a maid.

Sophia intercepted her, snatching the tray. "Let me, Vivian. Grandfather Henry adores me - he'll be thrilled I'm visiting. You might not even get past the door."

Her innocent expression couldn't mask the challenge in her eyes.

Evelyn followed silently as Sophia rapped sharply on the oak door. "Grandfather Henry? It's Sophia! You remember your favorite niece, don't you?"

Silence.

"See? He's resting." Sophia smirked, turning triumphantly.

Then the raspy voice came: "Is my granddaughter-in-law there?"

Sophia's face fell as the door creaked open.

"Grandfather Henry! I—"

"Not you." The old man's cane blocked her path as he smiled at Evelyn. "Come in, child. We have matters to discuss."

Evelyn glided past Sophia's crimson face, satisfaction warming her chest.

Inside, before she could inquire about his health, Henry sighed deeply. "Evelyn, I've known it was you all along. My time grows short, but seeing you safe brings me peace. There's something important we must discuss..."
###Chapter 425

Henry Blackwood's voice carried quiet certainty. His piercing gaze left no doubt—he knew exactly who stood before him.

Evelyn Sinclair maintained her composure, though surprise flickered through her. "Grandfather, you'll live many more years. And I truly am not Evelyn."

The old man's lips curved in a knowing smile, though his silver brows drew together. "Evelyn, would you deny an old man his peace before death?"

Her breath caught.

"They told me you died at Alexander and Victoria's engagement." Henry's sigh carried the weight of years. "That knowledge has haunted me."

His weathered hands trembled slightly as he continued. "You were always too good for this family. Alexander never deserved you. I don't blame you for returning like this—but stay away from Sebastian."

Memories surfaced of Sebastian's revelations about the past. Evelyn studied the elderly man before her—his face lined with age, yet his eyes still sharp with wisdom.

A faint smile touched her lips. "As Alexander's current wife, what connection could I possibly have with Sebastian? Grandfather, I'm not Evelyn. Though we share similar features, we're entirely different people. I won't repeat her mistakes."

Henry turned toward his bedside table without responding. From the drawer, he produced a stack of creased papers, pressing them into her hands.

"What's this?" Evelyn examined the first sheet. A single word stood out—Evie.

Page after page bore the same name in familiar handwriting. Her pulse quickened.

"The staff found these when cleaning Alexander's room after your disappearance," Henry explained.

Evelyn's laugh held no humor. "Are you suggesting Alexander mourned his ex-wife these past three years?"

The idea seemed absurd. When she'd died, only Henry had grieved. The rest of the Blackwoods had celebrated.

Strangers might pity her tragedy—but never Alexander.

"Evelyn," Henry continued, ignoring her denials, "do you recall what I asked when you sought divorce?"

She met his gaze steadily. "Since I'm not Evelyn, how would I remember?"

"No matter." His expression softened. "I'll tell you again. I asked if Alexander had ever been intimate with you after the arranged marriage."

Her fingers tightened on the papers.

"You know the answer." Henry's smile held kindness. "I know my grandson. If he didn't care for you, he'd never have touched you."

Evelyn nearly laughed aloud at the ridiculous notion—that Alexander Blackwood had ever loved her.

With deliberate calm, she set the pages aside. "Grandfather, please don't joke. Had Alexander cared even slightly, Evelyn wouldn't have died so terribly."

'Yes,' she thought bitterly, 'if there'd been any love, he wouldn't have left me bleeding in the snow.'

"As Alexander's wife," she continued, forcing a smile, "I'd prefer you didn't suggest he loved Evelyn. It's not only absurd—it's painful."

She drew a steadying breath. "Rest well, Grandfather. See a doctor if you feel unwell. Don't worry those who care for you. I'll take my leave."

Turning, her gaze caught on the discarded papers. The irony burned.

The door opened to reveal Alexander standing motionless, one hand raised as if to knock. His expression gave nothing away.
###Chapter 426

Evelyn quickly composed herself, forcing a serene smile. "Alexander, Grandfather needs his rest. We should go."

Alexander's piercing gaze caught the fleeting mockery in Evelyn's eyes. He gave a slight nod. "Very well."

Returning to the estate, Evelyn stepped under an icy shower, letting the cold water calm her racing thoughts.

'Grandfather Henry definitely suspects my true identity. That warning about staying away from Sebastian wasn't subtle.'

'Has he been investigating me behind the scenes?'

'I need to accelerate my plans.'

'Every day I delay increases the risk of Alexander discovering the truth.'

'He's far from stupid - his intelligence is one of the things I admired about him.'

When midnight's silence enveloped the Blackwood Estate, Evelyn carefully opened her eyes, confirming Alexander's deep sleep.

She slipped from his embrace like a shadow, padding silently to his study under the silver moonlight.

After days of careful observation, Evelyn had confirmed the study lacked any security system.

Flicking on the desk lamp, she sifted through documents - mostly mundane corporate reports of little importance.

The computer screen blinked to life, demanding a password.

What would he use?

Evelyn tried Alexander and Victoria's birthdates without success.

Just as she considered abandoning the attempt, a small voice came from the doorway. "Mommy?"

"Ethan?" Evelyn's breath caught at the sight of the sleepy child.

"Mommy, why are you working so late?" The boy shuffled forward, rubbing his eyes.

Evelyn's heart swelled at hearing him call her 'Mommy'. "Just remembered some unfinished work, sweetheart."

"I'll stay with you." Ethan's sleepy smile revealed his crooked front teeth.

Before Evelyn could protest, he'd already settled beside her.

"Mommy's being forgetful tonight. I can't remember the password, so maybe we should both go back to bed."

"You forgot? Don't worry, I know it!"

Evelyn stared in shock as Ethan dashed out, returning moments later clutching his tablet.

She expected to see a written password, but instead watched as he launched an unfamiliar app, connecting it to the computer. Within moments, eight digits flashed on the tablet screen.

Evelyn's blood ran cold.

'That can't be... Alexander's password?'

'It's impossible!'

Her hands trembled as she recognized the sequence. Before she could react, Ethan had already typed the numbers.

The computer unlocked with a soft chime.

Simultaneously, a notification pinged on Alexander's phone.

His dark eyes snapped open, immediately noting Evelyn's absence. Checking his phone, he rose silently and headed toward the study...
###Chapter 427

Alexander strode purposefully toward the study, spotting golden light spilling from beneath the door.

His steps faltered slightly as his expression darkened.

Just as he reached the threshold, Evelyn emerged holding Ethan's small hand.

"Alexander?" Evelyn blinked in surprise. "You're awake too?" Her lips curved into a soft smile. "Let me tuck Ethan in first."

Alexander simply nodded without questioning.

His gaze lingered as Evelyn guided their son down the hallway before finally entering the study.

After settling Ethan into bed, Evelyn whispered, "Promise Mommy you won't tell Daddy about tonight?"

Ethan blinked his wide, innocent eyes twice before nodding solemnly. "Ethan keeps secrets for Mommy."

"Thank you, sweetheart." Evelyn brushed his silky hair aside and pressed a kiss to his rosy cheek. "Sleep tight now."

As Ethan obediently lay down, his tiny fingers grasped Evelyn's sleeve. "Sing for me, Mommy?"

The hopeful note in his childlike voice melted Evelyn's heart completely.

She couldn't possibly refuse.

"Of course, darling." Her gentle smile widened as Ethan beamed, revealing his adorable crooked tooth before closing his eyes.

Evelyn tucked the blanket around him and began humming softly. "Hush little baby, don't say a word..."

Mid-lullaby, unexpected tears pricked her eyes.

Her thoughts drifted to her missing daughter.

Despite investigating everyone connected to Victoria and the Lancasters, she'd found no leads.

Where could Victoria have hidden her child?

Meanwhile, Alexander stood silently in Ethan's doorway.

Watching Evelyn sing to their son, an uncharacteristic softness crept into his usually icy gaze.

Later, Evelyn returned to their bedroom to find Alexander already in bed.

"I couldn't sleep," she explained casually. "Went to the study for a book and found Ethan awake too."

Alexander studied her with a faint smile. "Trouble sleeping? Something on your mind?"

"Just... everything that's happened recently." Evelyn offered the vague excuse before sliding under the covers, careful to maintain distance.

"Get some rest. Big day tomorrow."

But the moment she settled, Alexander pulled her close.

His warmth and sandalwood scent enveloped Evelyn completely.

Though she tried remaining indifferent, she couldn't ignore the heat radiating from his body pressed against hers.

The memory of his computer password flashed through her mind - her own birthday.

Absurd.

Old Master Blackwood's words echoed in her head: 'If Alexander didn't love you, he'd never touch you.'

Evelyn scoffed internally. Love?

If he truly loved me, he wouldn't have shattered my heart repeatedly until nothing remained.
###Chapter 428

"What's troubling you? Your tension is palpable." Alexander's rich baritone voice caressed her ears like aged bourbon.

Evelyn snapped back to reality. A bitter smirk played on her lips in the darkness.

"Nothing important. Just remembered an amusing anecdote," she replied casually, though her eyes burned with intensity.

'Yes, an anecdote. A cruel cosmic joke.'

'He might cherish any woman in this world, but never me.'

At dawn, Evelyn prepared a lavish breakfast for Alexander before escorting Ethan to preschool with him.

The transformation in Ethan's demeanor was undeniable.

She'd never encountered a child who flourished so remarkably after being separated from his birth mother.

What kind of monster was Victoria to inflict such psychological scars on her own flesh and blood?

Blackwood Enterprises.

After the executive meeting concluded, Alexander escorted Evelyn to the corporation's prestigious jewelry division.

"With the department manager currently abroad for professional development, you'll assume interim leadership," Alexander announced before the assembled staff.

Every designer recognized the Lady Belle brand and its creator Vivian Prescott. More significantly, they knew her as the CEO's wife.

Evelyn accepted the responsibility gracefully. She would now shape Blackwood Enterprises' jewelry legacy.

Having familiarized herself with operations all morning, Evelyn headed to Alexander's office.

The elevator doors parted to reveal Yvonne clutching an ornate lunchbox, beaming as she dashed toward Alexander's private quarters.

Within moments, Yvonne's saccharine voice carried through the door. "Alex darling, I slaved all morning over this. You must try it!"

"Alex, you can't imagine how I pined for you during my studies in France—"

Her heartfelt confession met stony silence. Soon Yvonne emerged, lunchbox in hand.

Evelyn approached calmly. Yvonne's expression darkened instantly when their eyes met.

Without Alexander present, Yvonne abandoned all pretense of civility.

Evelyn ignored her—until noticing the malicious curl of Yvonne's lips as she passed. Then came the deliberate outstretched leg.

The audacity to attempt tripping a pregnant woman. But Evelyn maintained perfect balance.

Yvonne gaped at Evelyn's poise before meeting her razor-sharp gaze.

Evelyn's lips curved. "Perhaps focus on your own footing before sabotaging others."

In her confusion, Yvonne stumbled over her own feet. She crashed spectacularly to the marble floor.

"Ah!" The lunchbox exploded upon impact, its contents decorating both the floor and Yvonne's meticulously made-up face.

Now sporting a facial mask of ruined makeup and spilled food, Yvonne scrambled up furiously.

"You! Vivian Prescott, you tripped me!" Her shrieks drew curious stares from nearby offices.

Alexander emerged at the mention of Evelyn's alias.

Yvonne transformed instantly, tears welling as she rushed to Alexander. "Alex, this viper tripped me! Look at the mess she's made of my lunch and makeup!"

Evelyn chuckled. "She's right, Alexander. I did trip her—"

"See! She admits it! Such malice, Vivian Prescott!"

"I confessed freely. But will you admit attempting to trip me first? I merely returned the favor."

Yvonne shook her head violently, squeezing out crocodile tears. "Alex, I'd never—she's framing me! You know my gentle nature—"

"Check the security feed before lying," Evelyn suggested sweetly, gesturing toward the ceiling-mounted cameras.
###Chapter 429

Vivian Prescott turned sharply at the sound of Evelyn's voice, her gaze landing on the blinking security camera.

All her bravado evaporated instantly. Heat flooded her cheeks in mortification.

Alexander Blackwood's glacial stare swept over Vivian's face. "If I catch you near Evelyn again—"

"Alex, I—" Vivian stammered, trembling.

"Get out."

The whispered murmurs of nearby employees burned Vivian's ears. She shot Evelyn a venomous glare before fleeing the scene.

As Alexander approached Evelyn, the ice in his eyes melted. "Did she touch you?"

Evelyn shook her head with a serene smile. "Not a scratch."

Relief softened Alexander's features. He laced his fingers through hers, guiding her toward the elevator. "Tired after this morning's meetings?"

"Exhaustion disappears when you're near." Evelyn's eyes crinkled with genuine warmth.

The transformation in Alexander's expression stunned watching employees. His lips curved in a rare, unguarded smile.

"Since when does Mr. Blackwood smile like that?"
"Only for her, apparently."
"But she's practically identical to his ex-wife. Why does he adore Evelyn yet despise Madeline?"

The unanswered question hung in the air as the elevator doors closed.

Alexander took Evelyn to an intimate bistro for lunch, but their meal was interrupted by an urgent call. Through the receiver, Evelyn caught snippets of a crisis requiring immediate attention.

"Vivian, I'm needed elsewhere." Alexander slid a black card across the table. "Order whatever you like."

"Duty calls." Evelyn smiled graciously. "Don't keep them waiting."

The moment Alexander disappeared, Evelyn exhaled in relief. She signaled the waiter for their finest Merlot.

As the ruby liquid swirled in her glass, memories surfaced—Alexander's computer password, the cemetery, the ashes. Abruptly, she stood, leaving both wine and meal untouched.

Blackwood Enterprises stood quiet when she returned. With Alexander handling the emergency, his office lay unguarded.

Evelyn entered casually, aware of the cameras. She "accidentally" knocked over a water glass near his laptop, using the distraction to move the device to a blind spot.

Her fingers flew over the keyboard, entering the eight-digit code Nathaniel had decrypted. The screen flickered to life.

Last night's interrupted mission could now be completed. From her purse, Evelyn produced a slim flash drive.

Twenty minutes later, every crucial file had been copied. The game had just escalated.
###Chapter 430

Evelyn wiped every trace of her presence clean before carefully placing the laptop back in its spot.

The tiny flash drive in her palm felt unnaturally heavy, as if it carried the weight of her conscience.

Property of Blackwood Enterprises.

Though she hadn’t been raised with strict moral lessons from her parents, her grandfather had instilled in her the importance of integrity.

She had always lived with a clear conscience, never once crossing the line into deceit.

Yet now, hesitation coiled tightly in her chest.

Is this betrayal?

No.

Alexander Blackwood, you and Victoria destroyed me. Even on the day of my supposed death, you both tore into me with your cruelty.

The false accusations, the torment, three years of suffering, the loss of my child—all of it is still fresh in my mind.

You brought this upon yourself. Don’t blame me for fighting back now.

Alexander, you owe me this.

Her fingers tightened around the flash drive before she turned and strode out of the office.

Sebastian Whitman’s company was just across the street. Evelyn reached it in minutes.

It was lunch hour, and Sebastian happened to be stepping out. His obsidian eyes lit up when he saw her. "Looking for me?"

She nodded. "Something important."

A faint smile curved his lips. "Let’s grab lunch. We can talk there."

"Fine." She followed him to a nearby bistro.

Unseen, a shadow lingered behind them.

Inside, Sebastian ordered her favorite dishes and a bottle of aged red wine.

He poured her a glass, his aristocratic features softened by a gentleman’s charm. "What’s so urgent that you’d seek me out? Shouldn’t you be dining with Alexander?"

"He left for an emergency."

A glint of satisfaction flickered in Sebastian’s gaze. "I’m flattered you came straight to me."

Evelyn stiffened slightly. "Sebastian, this isn’t a social call."

"Of course." He leaned back, ever composed. "Go on."

"I know Alexander’s computer password," she murmured.

Sebastian’s brows lifted. "How?"

She thought of Ethan cracking it last night and deflected. "That’s irrelevant. What matters is this."

She pulled the flash drive from her bag. "I copied everything."

Sebastian’s eyes darkened, the usual calm replaced by something sharper. His hand extended slowly. "Give it to me."

Evelyn hesitated, her grip tightening.

Memories surged—Alexander’s merciless threats, the freezing night he’d used her grandfather’s ashes and her unborn child as leverage, the agony of Victoria stealing her face, her sight, her very identity.

Evelyn Sinclair, after all he’s done, why show mercy now?

Her resolve hardened. She dropped the drive into Sebastian’s palm.

He noted her internal struggle but smiled when she finally relented.

Just as their fingers brushed, a hand shot out and seized Evelyn’s wrist.
###Chapter 431

Evelyn's outstretched hand was suddenly yanked upward as Sebastian's fingers barely grazed the corner of the flash drive.

His cold eyes flickered with irritation as he looked up to see a furious face glaring at them.

"Vivian Prescott, you shameless hussy!"

Sophia Montgomery sneered, her voice dripping with venom. "The moment Alexander leaves, you're already cozying up to another man? Holding hands in public? You're disgusting! I'm telling Cousin Alexander everything!"

Evelyn hadn't expected Sophia to be following her. She withdrew her hand sharply, her expression hardening. "Watch your tongue. This 'other man' happens to be Alexander's uncle."

Sophia's eyes widened. She glanced at Sebastian, finally noticing the striking resemblance to Alexander—the same sharp jawline, the same piercing gaze.

She had heard of Sebastian Whitman but never met him. Now, seeing him in person, she was taken aback by his commanding presence.

"Apologize to Vivian," Sebastian demanded, his voice icy.

Sophia scoffed. "Apologize? To her? Why?"

"Because I could sue you for defamation based on what you just said," he replied coolly.

Evelyn smirked, shaking her head. "Sebastian, don't bother. Forced apologies mean nothing to me."

Sophia's face flushed crimson with rage.

A notification chimed from Sebastian's phone. He glanced at the screen, his brow furrowing. "Vivian, I need to return to the office. Something urgent has come up."

Evelyn nodded. "Go ahead."

Sebastian shot Sophia one last warning look before striding away.

Sophia rolled her eyes dramatically. "Pathetic," she muttered before storming off as well.

Now alone, Evelyn exhaled slowly.

Her gaze drifted over the untouched gourmet meal and the half-poured glass of red wine. She sank back into her chair, turning the flash drive over in her fingers.

After a moment of contemplation, she stood abruptly and headed straight to her office on Diamond Boulevard.

She copied the contents of the flash drive onto her personal computer, then clicked open the first folder.

Skimming through, she found confidential project blueprints, contracts, and classified reports from Blackwood Enterprises.

Leaking these would cripple the company.

Among them was a recent, highly sensitive collaboration with ZF Group—one misstep, and the fallout would be catastrophic.

Evelyn's lips curved into a slow, dangerous smile.

So this is how easy it is to destroy someone.

Alexander, you never imagined the woman you despise most is not only alive—but about to ruin you.

A dark chuckle escaped her as she recalled the merciless coldness in his eyes that night.

Just as she moved to shut down the computer, her cursor hovered over an unnamed folder.

Curious, she clicked it open.

Inside were thousands of text files. She selected one at random.

A single line appeared:

"It's nice to see you again. I mean it."

Her fingers froze on the mouse.

"I love you. I really do."

Alexander's voice echoed in her mind—those same words whispered against her skin on the shores of Pinecrest Heights before their wedding.

"I really do."

Was he emphasizing something?

Her phone buzzed violently, snapping her out of her thoughts.

Alexander Blackwood's name flashed across the screen.
###Chapter 432

Her fingers hovered over the phone for three heartbeats before answering.

A rich baritone voice melted through the receiver. "Are you back at the office?"

"At my boutique actually," Evelyn responded coolly. "Shouldn't you be buried in meetings? What brings this call?"

The pause that followed crackled with electricity. "I found myself missing you," Alexander confessed, then added with devastating sincerity, "Terribly."

Those two syllables sent Evelyn's pulse into chaos. She focused on the computer screen, but the numbers blurred as her composure shattered.

"Vivian," his voice dropped an octave, "I won't make it back tonight. Will you ache for me like I'm aching for you?"

The silence stretched between them, filled only with the sound of her shallow breathing.

Finally, she whispered, "Yes. God, yes I will."

Alexander's chuckle vibrated through the phone, warm and intimate. "Hold onto that thought. When this is over, I'm never letting you out of my sight again."

The line went dead before Evelyn realized she'd been holding her breath. Something about his words left her unsettled.

Shutting down her computer abruptly, she drove straight to the detention facility.

Victoria's face twisted from hope to venom when she recognized her visitor. Dark circles shadowed her eyes as she shuffled in, chains clanking.

She'd seen the news - the Montgomerys had publicly claimed Evelyn as their blood, yet remained oblivious to her Vivian Prescott identity.

"You here about that bastard child of yours?" Victoria sneered, gripping the table. "The one you whelped like an animal?"

Evelyn's gaze never wavered. "I'd love to know, but we both know you'd rather die than tell me." She leaned forward. "Let's discuss something else - why desecrate my grave? Why steal my ashes?"

"Ashes?" Victoria's laughter echoed off concrete walls. "Oh Evelyn, I wish you were just ashes! If I'd known you were breathing, I wouldn't have wasted time on that pathetic shrine!"

Evelyn's pulse jumped. "So you admit destroying my memorial?"

"Damn right I did!" Spittle flew from Victoria's lips. "Had it cursed too! Wanted your ghost to suffer for eternity!"

The venomous words should have shaken her, but Evelyn focused on one staggering revelation - that grave had truly been meant for her.

"Don't celebrate yet, bitch!" Victoria slammed her shackled wrists on the table. "When I get out, that brat dies first. You'll spend decades drowning in regret!"

Evelyn rose gracefully, looking down at the seething woman. "That day will never come. Once Sophia and Henry's murders are solved, you'll be counting down to your execution. And that clock's ticking fast."

"Evelyn! Come back here! You'll never find that half-breed spawn of yours!" Victoria's screams followed her out.

That night, winter's first chill kissed Evelyn's cheeks as she stood on the balcony. The questions haunted her.

That desecrated grave was really mine?

Why would he build me a memorial? And why did he look so shattered when it was destroyed?

Morning found her dropping Ethan at preschool before heading to Blackwood Enterprises.

"Vivian." The voice stopped her at the glass doors.

Sebastian approached, his gaze intense. "Do you have the drive?"

Evelyn pushed aside her swirling thoughts, retrieving the device from her purse. "Here."

The moment her fingers brushed his, familiar heat encircled her wrist. She looked up into Alexander's stormy eyes.

His grip tightened. "Don't give it to him."
###Chapter 433

Evelyn hadn't anticipated Alexander's sudden appearance. Not only did he intercept her, but he had also uttered those unexpected words.

Sebastian's expression darkened. "Alexander, weren't you supposed to be away on business?"

"Am I not permitted to return? If I hadn't, I wouldn't have caught you harassing my wife," Alexander retorted icily, his fingers tightening around Evelyn's wrist. "Let's go inside."

Without sparing Sebastian another glance, he guided Evelyn toward the entrance of Blackwood Enterprises.

Evelyn cast one last glance at Sebastian before following Alexander silently.

Back in the office, she braced herself for his interrogation—but none came.

"Aren't you going to ask me anything?" She studied his composed expression, curiosity flickering in her gaze.

Alexander shrugged off his coat, his tone light. "Should I have something to ask?"

"Don’t you want to know what was on that flash drive? Or why I was giving it to Sebastian?"

"If you wanted me to know, you would’ve told me." His lips curved into a faint smile.

His indifference unsettled her.

"You didn’t stop me out of curiosity—you already knew what was inside, didn’t you?" A knowing smile played on her lips.

"How would I know?" His patience was unshaken. "I simply dislike seeing you interact with him."

Noticing her frown, he closed the distance between them.

His voice softened, laced with a tenderness she’d never heard before.

"Vivian, I don’t want you getting close to any other man—especially Sebastian."

His warm gaze enveloped her like winter sunlight before he pulled her into an embrace.

"Promise me you won’t meet him alone again. Please."

The vulnerability in his whisper sent a shiver down her spine.

His arms tightened around her.

"I can’t lose you. Not again."

Evelyn hesitated before wrapping her arms around his waist. "I promise."

A low chuckle rumbled in his chest. "Good."

Later, she accompanied him to the board meeting, though her mind wandered.

Alexander’s behavior had planted seeds of suspicion in her heart.

When the meeting adjourned, Eleanor called unexpectedly—Beatrice’s trial was set for that afternoon. She wanted to thank Evelyn for her earlier assistance.

They would never know Vivian was the true victim in this twisted game.

At 1:30 PM, Evelyn sat in the courtroom’s gallery.

Beatrice stood defiantly in the defendant’s box, admitting to the baby swap but dismissing its gravity.

"I didn’t harm the child. I just switched them. My sister can confirm I handed her a living baby. If she died later, that’s her own fault!"

Her venomous words ignited fury in Eleanor and William, their fists clenching in silent rage.

Evelyn pitied the woman—her warped love for Sophia was nothing but self-delusion.

The judge recoiled at Beatrice’s callousness. Was this truly a mother’s justification for destroying a family?

Then, Beatrice’s sister took the stand.

Beatrice brightened instantly. "Your Honor, ask her! I gave her the child—alive and unharmed!"

"Silence," the judge commanded sternly. "Witness, answer the prosecution’s questions."
###Chapter 434

Margaret Dawson appeared to be an honest woman. Yet her tone dripped with contempt as she spoke.

"About twenty-eight years ago, my sister Beatrice handed me a child. She claimed it was abandoned. Out of pity, she asked me to take her in."

"She gave me a large sum of money to keep the child. I took care of the baby for a few days—only because I needed the cash. But that child wouldn’t stop crying at night. She was too much trouble, so I gave her to my father."

Eleanor Kingsley and William Montgomery listened, their hearts shattering with each word. Their daughter had cried for them—for their warmth, their comfort. Instead, she had been discarded like an unwanted burden.

All while they had doted on Beatrice’s own flesh and blood.

The irony was sickening.

Beatrice had the audacity to claim the child was abandoned by her parents. That she had taken her in out of kindness.

Lies.

Every word was a carefully crafted deception.

Beatrice had played the fool, the innocent. But she had known everything. How else would she have ensured her own daughter lived in luxury?

Margaret continued, indifferent. "My father wasn’t right in the head. But he seemed to like that child. After I gave her to him, I never asked about her again. Later, I heard he moved—just to send her to school. I don’t know where he went. It’s been thirty years since I last saw him. Or that child."

Evelyn Sinclair finally understood.

Her grandfather had been Beatrice’s father.

His own children had abandoned him. They hadn’t even known he had died.

The pain in her chest was unbearable—for herself, and for the man who had raised her.

Eleanor suddenly stood, her eyes burning with fury as she pointed at Beatrice.

"Beatrice! Is this the 'wonderful sister' you spoke of? Did you hear her? She didn’t just neglect my daughter—she dumped her on your father! And you dare call this a minor matter?"

"You robbed my daughter of her parents. She died without them by her side. Meanwhile, your own child lived in luxury from the moment she was born. You’re a monster. Heartless!"

The judge didn’t reprimand Eleanor. Perhaps he understood.

Beatrice lowered her head, silent.

The hearing ended. The verdict would come in an hour.

Outside, Eleanor’s tear-filled gaze locked onto Evelyn. The resemblance stunned her.

She rushed forward, pulling Evelyn into a desperate embrace.

"Sophia… my Sophia…"

Evelyn’s heart ached. She gently patted Eleanor’s back. "Mrs. Montgomery, don’t cry. It’s over now."

Yes. It was over. Soon, everything would be—

Alexander Blackwood arrived just then, his expression soft as he approached. "I came to take you home."

Evelyn blinked. "How did you know I was here?"

He smiled. "What kind of husband would I be if I didn’t know what you were thinking?"

The words should have been sweet. But Evelyn felt nothing.

Then she realized—they weren’t heading home.

They were going to the cemetery.

Alexander took her hand, leading her through the gates.

"I didn’t expect things to turn out this way the last time we came here. But there’s something you need to see."

They stopped before a grave—the same one that had been vandalized before. Now, it was restored.

Evelyn stared at the empty plot. A faint smile touched her lips. "Who was buried here before?"

Alexander met her gaze. "My ex-wife. Evelyn Sinclair."
###Chapter 435

The confirmation from Alexander hit Evelyn like a physical blow. Even though Victoria's words had already hinted at it, hearing it directly from him still left her breathless.

The early winter wind brushed against her cheeks, its icy touch a cruel reminder of the past. It carried the same chill as Alexander's merciless gaze all those years ago.

She could never erase the memory of his brutality—the way his eyes had held nothing but contempt for her.

After a long pause, Evelyn forced a hollow smile. "If you despised Evelyn so much, why build her a tombstone? Why bring her roses?" Her voice trembled slightly. "I don’t understand."

How could he hate her enough to destroy her, yet mourn her death?

Alexander's lips curved into a faint smile, his gaze softening as it lingered on her face. "I know you won’t believe me. I didn’t even believe myself at first."

Evelyn turned away. "Believe what?"

"That her death was a lie," he murmured. "And that... I never stopped loving her."

Her heart clenched violently, as if someone had reached inside her chest and twisted. A bitter laugh escaped her lips.

How poetic.

Yet his words didn’t stir warmth in her—only disgust.

She scoffed, spinning on her heel. "You dragged me all the way here just to confess your love for a dead woman?"

Her voice dripped with mockery.

"If a man truly loves a woman, he doesn’t let her suffer," she continued coldly. "If you had cared, she wouldn’t have died like that."

Her fingers curled into fists inside her sleeves, nails digging into her palms. She forced the fury down, meeting his gaze with icy detachment.

"Alexander, you don’t love Evelyn. You love Victoria. The whole of Willowbrook knows it."

She rejected every word.

He didn’t argue, just watched her silently.

"Ah, I see," she said, nodding slowly. "After Evelyn died, you finally learned the truth. Now you feel guilty. That’s why you built her a grave. The flowers? Just another apology, right?"

It was the only explanation that made sense.

Alexander only smiled, saying nothing.

Back at the estate, Evelyn headed straight to the kitchen.

She had no intention of cooking for Alexander tonight. But for Ethan? She’d prepare a feast.

Three dishes and a hearty soup—simple, comforting.

Once, she had spent countless evenings making meals Alexander never touched.

Now, watching him eat her food with such eagerness, a sardonic smirk tugged at her lips.

Alexander, if you hadn’t been so blind, if you hadn’t believed every lie Victoria fed you… this could have been our family.

But you ruined it.

We made promises. We swore vows. And in the end, it was all just my foolish hope.

You took the brightest moment of my life and turned it into my darkest nightmare.

That day in the snow, I told you—if you didn’t kill me, I’d make you pay.

Ding!
###Chapter 436

The chime of a notification broke the silence.

Evelyn blinked, pulling herself from her thoughts. The screen lit up with a message from Sebastian.

He wanted the files from the USB drive.

"Daddy," Ethan's voice piped up, innocent and sweet. "Is Vivian going to be my mommy now? Can I tell the other kids that my mommy is Vivian Prescott?"

Evelyn glanced over. Alexander was feeding Ethan, his expression tender as he nodded. "Ethan, listen to me. No matter what happens, you only have one mommy—and she's right here in front of you."

Ethan beamed at Evelyn, his bright eyes shining with pure joy.

That look—so full of love—pierced through the walls around her heart.

A sharp ache bloomed in her chest.

And then, reluctance settled in.

She didn’t want to erase that smile from Ethan’s face.

If Alexander’s reputation was destroyed, if the Blackwoods fell—Ethan would never smile like that again.

The next morning, Evelyn went to the boutique. She sorted through the files on the USB, deliberately omitting key documents before sending them to Sebastian.

But Sebastian wasn’t fooled.

He arrived at her shop just as she was preparing to leave for Blackwood Enterprises.

The office was silent.

Sebastian didn’t yell. He didn’t accuse her.

He just looked at her, disappointment etched into his features.

"Vivian," he said softly. "Are you having second thoughts?" His voice was calm, but his dark eyes burned with intensity. "You don’t want to see him ruined. You still love him."

Evelyn scoffed. "I stopped loving him a long time ago." Her tone was sharp, laced with bitterness. "I just don’t want to go too far. Ethan doesn’t deserve to suffer for his father’s mistakes."

Sebastian stepped closer, his gaze unwavering. "You’re not going too far. Not after everything he did to you."

His voice dropped, heavy with suppressed anger.

"Evelyn—let me call you that. Do you remember how he left you in the rain? How he let Victoria frame you, sending you to prison for three years?"

His words were like knives, slicing open old wounds.

"Do you remember the torture? The way they stole your child? How he forced you to sign those divorce papers while Victoria took your corneas? You’re being merciful by even considering this."

Evelyn’s vision blurred with unshed tears.

The past was a mountain of pain—unyielding, unshakable.

Her resolve hardened.

No more hesitation.

But even as she made her decision, she couldn’t bring herself to hand over everything.

The old master’s warning echoed in her mind.

Monday morning.

Evelyn walked into Blackwood Enterprises beside Alexander. The employees looked tense, but they forced smiles when they saw him.

Alexander’s expression was unreadable, but Evelyn knew him well enough to sense his unease.

She knew exactly why.

The moment they reached his office, Lucas, his assistant, strode in, his face grim.

"Mr. Blackwood," he said urgently. "We have a problem."
###Chapter 437

Evelyn regarded Alexander with cool detachment as he slowly flipped through a stack of documents without glancing up. "What is it?"

Lucas hesitated, his gaze flickering toward Evelyn.

She understood immediately and offered a faint smile as she rose. "I should leave you two to discuss this. I'll return to the jewelry department."

"Vivian is my wife," Alexander said, his voice firm as he stopped her. "There's nothing she isn't entitled to know."

Lucas nodded. "Mr. Blackwood, there's been an issue with the Cielo Aqua Bay project with ZF."

Alexander finished reviewing the document in his hands before responding. "The project hasn't even broken ground yet. What could possibly have gone wrong?"

"Precisely because it hasn't started—someone took it from us."

At that, Alexander's fingers stilled.

His ocean-deep eyes lifted. "Someone took it?"

Lucas nodded. "A company called Simis. They signed the contract with ZF's relevant department yesterday."

"Simis?" Alexander murmured under his breath.

"Mr. Blackwood, if this collaboration falls through, Blackwood Enterprises stands to lose significantly. All the groundwork we laid will be wasted."

Before Lucas could say more, a sharp knock sounded at the office door.

Several department heads stood outside, their expressions grim. Alexander's gaze darkened—already, he sensed the storm brewing.

They filed in, voices overlapping in urgency the moment the door shut behind them.

"Mr. Blackwood, the South American shipment has been halted without warning. The products are stranded at the docks. Our clients there are furious."

"Mr. Blackwood, RS has suddenly demanded a full reassessment of our partnership. All related operations are frozen."

"Mr. Blackwood, the Cielo Aqua Bay situation has escalated. The board is calling for an emergency meeting. They're already en route."

Lucas stood frozen, processing the onslaught.

Why was everything collapsing at once?

It felt deliberate.

Evelyn listened in silence, then turned as Alexander stood. "Prepare for the meeting," he ordered calmly.

He stepped toward her, his expression softening. "I need to handle this. You should return to your work."

She nodded. "Of course."

She had no intention of following him—the details of corporate turmoil no longer concerned her.

Evelyn remained where she was, watching as Alexander turned away.

His posture was as composed as ever, as if this were merely a minor inconvenience.

Her gaze drifted to the winter landscape beyond the window, her eyes shadowed.

Alexander Blackwood, your reckoning has arrived.
###Chapter 438

"I'll leave a glimmer of hope for you this winter—for Grandfather and Ethan."

"Consider this my last act of mercy."

Two days later, the crisis at Blackwood Enterprises had only worsened. Stocks plummeted, rumors swirled about impending bankruptcy, and yet Alexander remained eerily composed.

Instead of panicking, he brought Vivian back to Blackwood Estate for dinner.

The meal was tense. Alexander’s phone buzzed incessantly until he finally excused himself to take a call. His mother, Margaret, slammed her fork down in frustration.

"Aunt Margaret, what's wrong?" Sophia asked, feigning concern.

"What else could be wrong?" Margaret snapped. "The company is collapsing, and everything is happening at once!"

"Don’t worry," Sophia simpered. "Alexander can handle anything."

Margaret scoffed. "You think this is just about business? ZF is involved. There will be consequences."

Her glare shifted to Vivian, who was calmly eating as if nothing were wrong.

"Vivian," Margaret sneered, "what kind of wife are you? Your husband is drowning in work, and you’re stuffing your face without a care. If Blackwood Enterprises falls, you’ll suffer too!"

Vivian smirked. "I won’t. I have my own company. I don’t need a man to survive."

Margaret’s face darkened.

Sophia jumped in. "How can you be so heartless? If you don’t know how to be Alexander’s wife, just divorce him already."

Vivian’s eyes flicked up, cold and amused. "Why? So you can take my place? Even if I leave, he’ll never look at you."

Sophia flushed. "I—I only admire him! I’m not as twisted as you!"

"You tell yourself that." Vivian reached for another bite.

Margaret slapped her hand away. "Still eating? You’re useless! If you were half the woman you pretend to be, you’d be helping him!"

Vivian’s fork clattered onto the table. The sharp sound made both women flinch.

Her gaze turned glacial. "You keep calling Evelyn a monster. What did she ever do to you?"

Margaret gaped.

"Your son tortured her because of Victoria. Now that the truth is out, you feel no remorse? Do you think you’re better than her just because you’re her mother-in-law?"

Margaret sputtered. "How dare you speak to me like that?"

Vivian smirked. "I’m not your servant. And soon, you won’t be able to speak to me like this either."

Margaret paled.

Alexander returned, sensing the tension.

Margaret immediately pointed at Vivian. "Alexander! This woman is out of control! She yelled at me—disrespected me!"

Sophia nodded eagerly. "She even insulted you! Said you made Evelyn suffer, but Evelyn deserved to die!"

Vivian’s fingers curled around her glass.

The air turned deadly.
###Chapter 439

"Enough!" Alexander's voice thundered through the dining room, sharp as shattered glass.

Isabella immediately clamped her mouth shut, her breath hitching in fear. The glacial fury in Alexander's piercing gaze made her blood run cold.

He strode past Isabella and his mother without a second glance, his focus solely on Vivian. Noticing her tightened jaw, he softened his tone. "Had enough? Let's leave this wretched place."

Vivian rose gracefully, her emerald eyes sweeping over the two women like a queen surveying peasants. "How could anyone eat with such vile company?"

Margaret Blackwood's face purpled with rage. "Alexander! Did you hear how she spoke to me?"

Vivian's lips curled into a mocking smile. "And what will you do about it? Bully me like you did Evelyn?"

Margaret sputtered, "Vivian Prescott, what nonsense are you spouting? Defending that wretched girl? She deserved everything! If Evelyn hadn't—"

"I said ENOUGH!" Alexander's fist slammed onto the table, making the china rattle. His voice dropped to a dangerous whisper. "Evelyn was proven to be Sophia Montgomery's daughter. Would you dare say these things to Eleanor and William?"

Margaret's mouth snapped shut. The revelation about Evelyn's true parentage still burned like acid in her throat. That gutter rat turning out to be a Montgomery heiress? Unbearable.

The silence stretched taut until Alexander offered Vivian his arm. "Let's go."

Vivian unclenched her fists, shooting Margaret one last scathing look that promised retribution.

As they turned to leave, Margaret muttered under her breath, "Montgomery or not, that bitch disfigured Ethan! And she definitely had something to do with Sophia's death!"

Vivian froze. Slowly, she turned, her gaze sharper than Damascus steel. "Accusing without proof? Typical. You'd grovel if the truth exonerated Evelyn, but we both know you only kick those already down."

Margaret's face twisted, but she remained silent under Alexander's warning glare.

The car ride home was suffocatingly quiet.

Vivian stared out at the blurring city lights, her reflection fractured in the rain-streaked window. She remembered this road—the night Alexander had nearly choked her to death defending Victoria. How she'd begged for just a shred of trust before being thrown into the storm.

That night, the rain had felt like needles. The pain like fire.

If not for Sebastian...

Her fingers traced the scar hidden beneath her silk blouse.

How poetic. The only memories you've given me are written in blood.
###Chapter 440

"Yet now you're shamelessly using my death to claim you love me?"

"Alexander, you're utterly pathetic."

"I need to leave for F Country in three hours. I'll be gone approximately two days." His deep voice resonated through the car.

F Country?

Evelyn's eyes flickered with recognition. She responded coolly, "Understood."

Alexander studied her reflection in the rearview mirror - that icy expression that never seemed to thaw.

When the car stopped, Evelyn exited without waiting, striding into Blackwood Estate alone. She nearly went to see Ethan before remembering Eleanor had collected him that morning.

Though not their biological grandson, Eleanor and William adored Ethan unconditionally. Their love for the child was genuine.

Evelyn retrieved her silk pajamas, preparing for a shower. As she turned, she found Alexander watching her with that unreadable gaze.

"What now? Will you scold me for speaking to your mother that way? Or perhaps you agree your ex-wife Evelyn was a despicable wretch, so I've no right defending her?"

Her lips curled in that mocking smile she'd perfected. She stepped closer to the silent man.

"Save your breath if you plan to lecture me. My stance won't change."

But instead of words, Alexander cradled the back of her head gently. His lips descended, capturing hers in a kiss that stole her breath.

Evelyn froze. She'd expected anger, accusations - not this tender assault.

By the time she regained her senses, he'd already pulled away.

His gaze held hers, brimming with emotions she couldn't - wouldn't - decipher.

"Nothing you say or do could ever make me resent you."

His arms enveloped her then, holding her with impossible care - as if she might break from too much pressure, yet vanish if he held too lightly.

"Wait for my return. I'll resolve everything. Trust me."

That whisper curled around her heart like smoke.

Evelyn exhaled slowly, neither resisting nor reciprocating. Let him have this moment. Let them pretend.

Suddenly, she smiled against his shoulder.

'Alexander, this will be our final embrace.'

'When you return from F Country, Vivian Prescott will cease to exist.'

'No more smiles for you. Not even the counterfeit ones.'

Three hours later, Alexander's private jet cut through the twilight sky toward F Country.

The next morning found Evelyn attending the executive meeting as the acting CEO's wife. Before she could take her seat, Yvonne and Margaret Blackwood stormed in, hostility radiating from them.

"Vivian, don't presume you hold any authority here simply because my son is absent," Margaret sneered.

She marched straight to Alexander's customary seat and addressed the room. "Effective immediately, all company affairs will be overseen by myself and Miss Yvonne Yaleman. All documents requiring approval will come through us."
###Chapter 441

Margaret Blackwood finished barking her commands with an air of self-importance, plunging the conference room into stunned silence. All eyes were fixed on her and Sophia Montgomery.

Sophia beamed, relishing the spotlight that had suddenly shifted onto her.

Evelyn Sinclair couldn't help but laugh at the ridiculous display before her. "Taking over? And what exactly will you be overseeing? The circus act?"

Margaret's face darkened instantly. "Vivian Prescott! How dare you speak to me like that? You're merely Alexander's wife—what right do you have to manage Blackwood Enterprises?"

She turned to Sophia with a smug smile. "From today onward, this will be your seat. When Alexander returns, I'll inform him you're now his personal assistant."

Sophia's eyes lit up with triumph. "Thank you, Aunt Margaret!" Without hesitation, she slid into Evelyn's chair.

"Why are you still here?" Margaret snapped, shooing Evelyn away with a dismissive wave. "Go tend to your little jewelry boutique. You have no business in Blackwood Enterprises." She straightened her posture and announced grandly, "Let's begin the meeting."

The department heads exchanged uneasy glances, none of them moving to comply.

Evelyn watched the charade unfold with amusement before slamming her notebook onto the table with a sharp crack.

The executives flinched as an undeniable aura of authority radiated from her.

"So," Evelyn drawled, tilting her head. "My dear mother-in-law thinks she can waltz in and seize power while my husband is away, is that it?"

She watched with satisfaction as Margaret's expression twisted.

"A meeting? Do you even know what this meeting is about? The South American shipment deadlines? The RS contract negotiations? The Cielo Aqua Bay project?" Evelyn's lips curled. "You don't even know the client's basic requirements, yet you're prancing around claiming authority? How... comedic."

Margaret's face flushed crimson, her mouth opening and closing like a fish out of water.

"Vivian! How dare you—" Sophia began indignantly.

"And you," Evelyn cut in coldly. "Did you honestly believe you could steal my position so easily? Your celebration is premature."

Margaret slammed her palms on the table. "Vivian Prescott! You—"

"Mrs. Blackwood." A senior department head stood abruptly, intervening before the situation escalated further. "With all due respect, Mr. Blackwood made it clear yesterday that his wife is to oversee all company affairs in his absence. No one else has authority to interfere."

The color drained from Margaret and Sophia's faces. They hadn't anticipated Alexander would issue such explicit orders.

"Furthermore," the executive continued, "Mr. Blackwood stated that anyone who disobeys his wife will face immediate termination. Should anyone cause disturbances, security will escort them out. You wouldn't want to put us in that position, would you, Mrs. Blackwood?"

Margaret's expression turned thunderous. She hadn't expected her son to defend this woman so fiercely.

Evelyn's lips curved in a cool smile. "Did you hear that, Mother-in-law? Or do I need to call security to make it clearer?"

Margaret trembled with rage, her glare burning into Evelyn.

"Since you have nothing constructive to add," Evelyn said smoothly, "kindly remove yourselves. Every second you delay this meeting costs Blackwood Enterprises millions. Are you prepared to shoulder that loss?"
###Chapter 442

Margaret Blackwood could never be satisfied with such treatment. Yet she had no choice but to storm out in fury.

Sophia Montgomery clenched her fists, her cheeks puffing with barely contained rage as she trailed behind Margaret.

"Aunt Margaret, Vivian is absolutely despicable! Not only does she disrespect me, but she dares to humiliate you in front of all those department heads!"

Sophia's voice trembled with indignation as she fanned the flames.

"Aunt Margaret, with Alexander away, you should put that arrogant woman in her place! If you don't teach her a lesson now, she'll start thinking she runs Blackwood Enterprises."

Margaret's lips curled into a sneer. "You're absolutely right, darling. Tonight, I'll make sure she understands who truly holds power in this family."

Shortly after the meeting, Evelyn received a summons from Blackwood Estate. The butler informed her that Henry Blackwood requested her presence that evening.

Six years ago, Evelyn would have believed the old patriarch genuinely wanted to see her. But the woman who had risen from the ashes of her past self knew better.

Yet she went anyway.

Her stilettos clicked sharply against the marble floors as she strode into the grand parlor, designer handbag swinging from her arm.

Margaret and Sophia had already set their trap. When Evelyn appeared, Margaret plastered on a saccharine smile.

"Ah, my dear daughter-in-law has arrived. Shall we begin dinner?" Her voice dripped with false sweetness before her eyes dropped to Evelyn's shoes. "My, my - wearing heels in your condition? What if you take a tumble, Vivian?"

Sophia smirked, chiming in with mock concern. "Really, Vivian. Those are dangerously high. Wouldn't want anything... unfortunate to happen to your precious heir, would you? After all, a mother's status rises with her child's position. And this baby stands to inherit quite the empire."

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial. "What century are you living in with that antiquated nonsense? How pathetically provincial." Her eyes raked over Sophia with disdain. "My footwear choices are none of your concern."

Sophia's mouth gaped like a fish.

Margaret swallowed her fury with visible effort. "Sophia, that was uncalled for. Vivian is an accomplished businesswoman in her own right. She doesn't need to rely on her child's future success."

The words sounded supportive but carried venomous undertones.

"Come, let's eat. My dear Vivian must be exhausted after working all day," Margaret said, exchanging a meaningful glance with Sophia.

Evelyn took her seat, but no food appeared.

"Darling," Margaret purred, "according to Blackwood family tradition, the younger generation must serve the elders before dining. It's a sign of respect. When multiple elders are present, each must be properly greeted."

Evelyn's laughter rang out, sharp and humorless. "Blackwood traditions? How amusing. I'm not a Blackwood."

"You—"

"Was this your grand scheme? Luring me here to force obedience under the guise of family customs?"

"Isn't it natural for a daughter-in-law to serve her mother-in-law?" Margaret lifted her chin haughtily.

Evelyn's smirk could have frozen hell. "In theory, yes. But tell me, Margaret - have you ever acted like a mother-in-law worth serving?"

Margaret's face twitched. "Vivian, don't mistake my patience for weakness! If you continue this insolence, don't expect me to maintain appearances in public!"

"Respect?" Evelyn's bitter laugh echoed through the parlor. Her gaze turned steely. "Where was your respect when Victoria framed me for theft? When you refused to acknowledge me as your daughter-in-law? When you told your society friends I was nothing but a servant in your household? Is that the 'respect' you speak of?"
###Chapter 443

Margaret Blackwood's face drained of color. Her eyes widened in shock as she stared at the stunning yet icy woman before her, disbelief written across her features.

Eleanor Kingsley frowned, confused by Margaret's reaction—and even more so by Evelyn Sinclair's words.

"Aunt Margaret, are you—?"

"W-What did you just say?" Margaret ignored Eleanor. Her trembling finger pointed at Evelyn. "Say it again. W-Who are you?"

Evelyn leaned back in her chair, unbothered by Margaret's terror.

She arched a brow, her piercing gaze locking onto Margaret's.

"It happened right here that day. You said I could only be part of the Blackwoods and marry Alexander if the dead could rise again. Well, here I am—a 'dead woman' standing before you. Surprised?"

Margaret's heart lurched. She shot up from her seat, panic clawing at her throat. "Y-Y-You're not Vivian Prescott!"

Evelyn smirked. "Has it only been three years? Did you forget me so quickly, dearest mother-in-law?"

Margaret's breath hitched.

Evelyn rose gracefully, her every step radiating power as she closed the distance between them.

Margaret stumbled back, her spine hitting the decorative shelf behind her.

"Stay away from me!" Her voice cracked with fear. "Get back!"

Evelyn chuckled darkly. "How else will you see me clearly?"

Margaret flinched, her gaze darting away.

Evelyn seized her wrist, yanking her forward until they were face-to-face. "Look at me, Margaret. Is this the face you despised so much?"

Margaret trembled violently.

"See me now? I'm the daughter-in-law you scorned—Evelyn Sinclair."

Margaret's pulse skyrocketed. She couldn't breathe.

But those frost-laden eyes, brimming with hatred, left no doubt—Vivian Prescott was Evelyn Sinclair.

Eleanor gasped, realization dawning.

Evelyn Sinclair?

Alexander's ex-wife?

Aunt Margaret said she died three years ago!

How is she alive?!

"M-M-Mad—Evelyn... It's really you...?" Margaret whispered, her voice hollow.

"Disappointed?" Evelyn released her wrist with a cold smile.

The moment she was free, Margaret scrambled behind Eleanor, too terrified to meet Evelyn's gaze.
###Chapter 444

Evelyn's lips curved into a triumphant smile as she watched Margaret Blackwood shrink away from her.

"I distinctly recall you saying everyone would rejoice if I died." Her voice dripped with icy amusement. "Yet here we are, and you look absolutely miserable."

Margaret's mouth opened and closed like a fish out of water. Her shoulders slumped in defeat.

Behind her, Yvonne shot Evelyn a venomous glare. "So you're Alexander's dead ex-wife Evelyn Sinclair. If you're alive, why haunt my aunt like some ghost?" She squared her shoulders. "I swear if you—"

"This is between me and the Blackwoods." Evelyn cut her off with a glacial stare that could freeze hell. "Stay out of it unless you want to get scorched."

Yvonne's bravado faltered. When Evelyn took a step forward, the younger woman actually stumbled backward, her mouth snapping shut.

Left exposed, Margaret trembled like a leaf in a storm. "W-what do you want from me?"

Evelyn arched a perfect brow. "What do I want?" Her laughter held razor blades. "That's my line, darling. Tell me—what did I ever do to deserve your cruelty?"

She advanced slowly, each click of her heels echoing like a death knell.

"I came into this family with clean hands. Victoria was the architect of my marriage to Alexander. Yet you treated me like filth beneath your designer shoes." Her voice cracked like a whip. "You called me a gold-digging whore. Believed every lie Victoria fed you. Forced me to divorce so your precious daughter-in-law could take my place!"

Margaret flinched as if struck.

"That night I came to dinner in agony, barely able to stand—you forced curry down my throat until I vomited blood." Evelyn's eyes glittered with unshed tears. "You thought I was being dramatic. Did you even see the blood, Margaret? Or were you too busy playing the victim?"

The older woman's breathing turned ragged. She had no defense.

A bitter chuckle escaped Evelyn's lips. "I used to think marrying Alexander made me the luckiest woman alive." She adjusted her coat sleeves with deliberate calm. "Turns out I was the universe's favorite punching bag."

Margaret's hands twisted in her lap.

Evelyn picked up her handbag, her smile turning lethal. "Here's the thing, mother-in-law—had you shown me an ounce of kindness, I might have spared you." She leaned in, whispering like a lover. "But since you didn't... enjoy the hell I've prepared for you."

Margaret's face drained of color.

Evelyn turned on her heel—only to freeze mid-step.

Standing in the doorway was the last person she expected to see.
###Chapter 445

Evelyn had prepared herself to face them all.

Yet when her eyes met the silver-haired Henry Blackwood, her heart clenched painfully. Still, she maintained her composed gaze.

"Grandfather, you're right. I'm Evelyn."

The admission slipped past her lips at last. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes, hot and insistent.

"Grandfather, thank you for believing in me all those years. You were the only one in this family who ever showed me kindness. I'll never forget that."

The old man shuffled forward with the aid of his cane, his aged hands trembling slightly. His clouded eyes softened as they settled on her face, filled with warmth and understanding.

"My dear child... you've finally come back to us. This old heart is glad."

The tenderness in his voice made guilt twist sharply in Evelyn's chest. "I'm sorry, Grandfather. I fear I may disappoint you again."

"Never." His cold fingers wrapped around hers, squeezing gently. "I see the woman you've become, and I couldn't be prouder. Alexander wronged you terribly. No fortune or title is worth a human life. But by God's grace, you survived."

"Grandfather—"

"My support has always been yours. That will never change."

His words carved straight through her defenses.

Just then, Sebastian's call interrupted them. With a final farewell, Evelyn took her leave.

The moment the door closed behind her, Margaret Blackwood collapsed into a chair, her face ashen. "She's alive. All this time... she was right under our noses! This is revenge—she's here to destroy us!"

Her fingers shook as she dialed Alexander's number repeatedly, only to be met with silence.

Panic clawed at her throat. "I can't just wait for her to strike first!"

"And what exactly do you intend to do?" Henry's bushy white eyebrows drew together in disapproval.

"Father! You heard her—that's Evelyn Sinclair! The girl we buried three years ago! Do you think she's returned out of forgiveness? With her new status and connections, she's more dangerous than ever!"

"So it was acceptable to torment her when she was powerless, but now that she's formidable, you tremble? Have you ever considered your own actions? What kind of mother-in-law does that make you?"

"But Father, I—"

"I warned you about Victoria's true nature, yet you pushed Evelyn away at every turn. Have you truly never noticed your own son has loved her from the beginning?"

Margaret's mouth fell open. "W-what?"

Alexander... loved Evelyn?

That couldn't be.

After leaving Blackwood Estate, Evelyn drove Alexander's car to an upscale bistro downtown.

Through the floor-to-ceiling windows, the city lights glittered like scattered diamonds. The scene should have been peaceful, beautiful.

She raised her wine glass. The rich burgundy liquid burned a path down her throat, its sweetness undercut by a lingering bitterness.

"You don't seem happy."

Evelyn shook her head. "I am. It's just... I hate disappointing Grandfather."

Sebastian's expression darkened at the mention of Henry.

She remembered his story—his deep-seated resentment toward the Blackwoods, especially the patriarch.

Before she could redirect the conversation, her phone buzzed.

The name on the screen made her breath catch.

Eleanor Kingsley.
###Chapter 446

Did Margaret reveal Evelyn's true identity to Eleanor?

Probably not.

Evelyn wouldn't create additional complications for herself at this critical juncture.

As Vivian contemplated this, she reached for her phone.

"Miss Prescott, this is Eleanor Kingsley. Would you be able to come to our estate now? Ethan can't sleep and keeps asking for you."

Understanding the reason, Vivian agreed immediately. "I'll be there shortly."

"That's wonderful." Eleanor's voice carried unmistakable delight.

Perhaps seeing Vivian's face would bring comfort to both her and William.

After ending the call, Vivian ate a quick meal before departing.

Sebastian sat motionless, swirling red wine in his crystal glass. His piercing gaze remained fixed on some distant point.

"Vivian, he's not the noble man you imagine. He doesn't deserve your compassion."

Approximately twenty minutes later, Vivian arrived at Kingsley Manor.

Eleanor and William greeted her with open arms.

When Ethan spotted Vivian, his youthful face lit up with pure, unadulterated joy.

Vivian sang a soothing lullaby until the boy drifted into peaceful slumber.

Gazing at Ethan's angelic sleeping face, Vivian leaned down to place a tender kiss on his forehead.

'Ethan, I wonder if you'll still call me Mommy after learning what I must do.'

Tears pricked at her eyes as an inexplicable pain gripped her heart.

Suddenly, Vivian noticed movement in the doorway. Eleanor stood there, watching with gentle affection.

After carefully tucking Ethan in, Vivian stepped out.

Eleanor looked at her expectantly. "Miss Prescott, you're always welcome here anytime."

Vivian offered a bittersweet smile. "I believe this may be my last visit."

"Why?" Eleanor froze, concern flashing in her eyes. "Are you returning to France? Have we done something to offend you?"

"You'll understand soon enough," Vivian replied calmly, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "Some events change everything irrevocably. Still, I want to thank you and Mr. Kingsley."

"Thank us?" Eleanor appeared thoroughly confused, but Vivian simply nodded and turned away.

'Yes, thank you.
Thank you for giving me life, even though these thirty years have brought nothing but suffering.'

The following morning.

Vivian arrived early at Blackwood Enterprises. Shareholders holding company stocks waited in the conference room.

After organizing the necessary documents, Vivian strode confidently into the meeting. She took the seat of ultimate authority and declared solemnly, "Alexander Blackwood will no longer serve as CEO. All his responsibilities, business decisions, and positions are hereby transferred to me."

The announcement sent shockwaves through the room. Shareholders exchanged stunned glances.

At that precise moment, the conference room doors burst open. The man supposedly investigating in France now stood before them, his unexpected presence freezing everyone in place.
###Chapter 447

Evelyn Sinclair wasn't expecting Alexander Blackwood to return so soon, yet her composure never wavered. A faint, knowing smile played at the corners of her lips.

The moment he stepped into the room, the temperature seemed to drop. His presence was commanding, dominating the space as if everything else was merely background scenery.

His dark, piercing gaze locked onto Evelyn’s face, ignoring everyone else. With each step he took toward her, his heartbeat quickened, the rhythm betraying the icy exterior he wore so well.

One of the shareholders finally snapped out of their stunned silence. "Mr. Blackwood, your wife was just—"

"Leave."

Alexander’s voice was sharp, cutting through the air like a blade. His eyes never left Evelyn’s.

The shareholders exchanged uneasy glances but obeyed, filing out of the room until only the two of them remained.

Evelyn broke the silence first, her tone cool and detached. "You returned faster than I anticipated. I assume you already know what’s happened."

Gone was the softness she once carried. Now, there was only distance—and a flicker of disdain.

"Mr. Blackwood, you’ve always been exceptional. Efficient. But this time, you’re too late."

She snatched the stack of documents from the table and tossed them toward him.

"Effective immediately, you are no longer the president of Blackwood Enterprises. You have no authority in this boardroom anymore."

Alexander caught the papers effortlessly, his expression unreadable. He skimmed through the contents before setting them aside with deliberate indifference.

"If losing all of this means I can have you back, then it’s a price I’ll gladly pay."

Evelyn scoffed. "Alexander Blackwood, I’m done pretending. Why are you still playing this game?"

Her gaze raked over his handsome features, her lips curling in bitter amusement. "Do you really expect me to believe you love me enough to sacrifice everything?"

She lifted her chin, defiance flashing in her eyes.

"You know who I am now, don’t you?"

The air between them turned frigid.

A dangerous glint flickered in Alexander’s gaze, yet his voice remained steady as he met the hatred burning in hers.

Evelyn no longer carried the hesitation she once had. She faced him head-on, unflinching. For a brief moment, the past flickered in her mind, softening her expression.

"Do you have any idea how happy I was when I first met you?" she murmured, almost wistful. "You were the light in my bleak, lonely world. I cherished that light, held it close to my heart. I thought when we met again, it would only grow brighter."

Her voice hardened. "But you destroyed it. Over and over, with your cruelty."

Her breath hitched, the pain raw in her words. "Alexander, I loved you so much. I would have done anything for you. So tell me—why did you break the woman who adored you? Why was loving you my downfall?"

Alexander’s throat tightened. His fingers twitched, aching to reach for her, but she recoiled before he could touch her.

His hand fell to his side, empty.
###Chapter 448

"Don't touch me," Evelyn sneered, recoiling from Alexander's reach. "Your hands have been all over other women. It makes my skin crawl."

The sharp intake of Alexander's breath was audible.

Her words pierced through him like shards of glass. Who knew a single word—"disgusted"—could carry such devastating weight?

Yet he'd wielded that very word against her countless times before.

When Alexander remained silent, Evelyn drew a steadying breath. Her fiery gaze locked onto his, burning with barely contained fury. "What's wrong? Doesn't feel good when the tables are turned, does it?" Her lips curled into a mirthless smile. "Remember all those lovely names you called me? A shameless whore? A disgrace to the Blackwood name? Or how you said I wasn't fit to be Alexander Blackwood's wife?"

Alexander's brow furrowed as her accusations rained down.

Every cruel word he'd ever spoken to her came rushing back. His sins against her were innumerable.

He said nothing, simply drinking in the sight of her—this phoenix risen from ashes he'd created.

The crimson in his eyes held oceans of remorse, love, and unspoken apologies.

But the Evelyn before him now would never see them.

Only the flames of hatred danced in her striking eyes, making them glow with terrifying intensity.

Evelyn stepped forward, her statuesque frame radiating power despite their height difference.

"Since you're so desperate for proof," she challenged, fingers gripping the collar of her silk blouse. With one sharp motion, she tore it open.

The delicate hollow of her throat came into view, followed by the smooth curve of her shoulder. Alexander's gaze dropped to the distinctive mole gracing her collarbone—that small, familiar mark he'd kissed countless times.

Her grip on the fabric tightened, her smirk growing more venomous.

"Recognize it now, Alexander? Or should I remind you how you used to trace this very spot with your lips?"

A bitter laugh escaped her.

"I'm not Vivian Prescott. Not some ghost from your past. I'm Evelyn Sinclair—the woman you despised, the wife you discarded. And I've come back to collect what you owe me."

Though her words dripped with venom, Alexander felt something fragile bloom in his chest.

After three years of endless winter, spring had finally come.

His throat worked as unshed tears burned behind his eyes. Against all odds, a smile touched his lips.

"I've waited so long to hear you say that," he murmured, voice thick with emotion. "Welcome home, Evelyn."

"So you knew." She adjusted her blouse with deliberate calm. "Good. Then let's skip the pretenses. For Henry and Ethan's sake, I'll leave Blackwood Estate untouched. But everything else that bears your name? Consider it mine now."

Her tone was arctic, her eyes devoid of warmth.

"That marriage certificate with Vivian Prescott? Worthless. The pregnancy rumor? A lie. Nothing happened between us at Pinecrest Heights that night—it was all part of the act."

She paused, the temperature in the room dropping further.

"This is your reckoning, Alexander. You destroyed my life. Now I'll return the favor by stripping away everything that defines yours."
###Chapter 449

Evelyn finished speaking without hesitation. Her sharp gaze swept over Alexander’s face before she turned and walked away.

Alexander caught her wrist, forcing her to stop.

She glared at him, her eyes icy. "What now? Planning to punish me with your usual brutality? Alexander, I’m not that naive Evelyn who let you trample over her anymore. I’m not afraid of you."

She met his dark, intense stare without flinching. There was an unshakable defiance in her expression, regal and untouchable.

Alexander didn’t react with anger. Instead, his burning gaze lingered on her flawless face, searching for something—anything—that might betray her words.

Deep down, he already knew everything she’d said was a lie.

But as long as he pretended to believe it, he could keep her close.

Now, the illusion had shattered.

After a long silence, the corner of his lips curved slightly. "I have one question for you."

Evelyn regarded him coldly.

"Do you still love me?"

A low, mocking laugh escaped her lips, as if he’d told the most ridiculous joke.

When her laughter faded, she tilted her head. "Alexander, don’t you find it pathetic to ask that? Love you? Did you ever care about my love? I’m sure a woman like me loving you would disgust you, wouldn’t it, Mr. Blackwood?"

His heart twisted painfully. The answer he dreaded had come.

He stared into her hate-filled eyes, his own dimming with defeat.

"Alexander, I did love you. But the more you hurt me, the more that love died."

"I’m awake now. I don’t dream of your affection anymore. Even if you feel something for me, I don’t care. All I want is to watch you fall. I’ll be thrilled when you lose everything!"

She smirked, then yanked her wrist free.

Without another glance, she walked away, her steps steady and unfeeling.

Alexander remained rooted in place, watching her retreating figure. Agony clawed at his chest, yet a strange satisfaction flickered in his eyes.

As long as you’re alive and happy, I’ll gladly lose it all.

Evelyn stepped out of Blackwood Enterprises, the winter sun warming her skin. She lifted her face to the sky, inhaling deeply. A faint smile touched her lips.

Alexander, you never saw this coming, did you?

Neither did I.

With that, she strode to her car and drove off.

The moment news of Alexander’s return spread, Margaret rushed to his office.

When she burst in, she found him seated by the floor-to-ceiling windows, lost in thought, his head bowed. She hurried to him.

"Alexander!" she cried frantically.

He frowned, disturbed by the intrusion.

"Alexander, something terrible has happened!"

Annoyed, he tucked away the photo in his hand and lifted his gaze, sharp with irritation. "No disturbances. Get out."
###Chapter 450

Margaret Blackwood was stunned. But she had no intention of leaving. Instead, she stepped directly in front of Alexander Blackwood.

"Alexander, I have something urgent to tell you!" Margaret's voice trembled. "Evelyn isn't dead! She's Vivian Prescott! She confessed it herself two days ago! She really is Evelyn!" Her words spilled out in a frantic rush.

Yet, Alexander remained unmoved. A realization struck her. "Alexander... you—you already knew, didn't you? You knew that woman was Evelyn all along?"

The moment the accusation left her lips, Alexander lifted his gaze to meet hers.

His eyes were glacial, freezing Margaret mid-sentence.

Without a word, Alexander stood and strode away, leaving everything behind.

Margaret chased after him. "Alexander, w-what's happening now? Are you just going to ignore Evelyn? Do you even know what she's done these past two days? Alexander, don't underestimate her! That woman came back for revenge! Alexander—Alexander!"

No matter how desperately she called, Alexander didn’t spare her a single glance.

Frustrated, Margaret stomped her foot before turning to interrogate the department heads for updates on Blackwood Enterprises.

The moment she learned the truth, she nearly collapsed.

She never expected the "resurrected" Evelyn to be this ruthless—this bold. She had nearly seized control of the entire corporation.

After leaving Blackwood Enterprises, Evelyn headed straight to the police station.

She had spent weeks gathering evidence against Victoria Lancaster for Henry Whitmore’s murder. Now, she handed over every incriminating detail.

She also reported Victoria’s involvement in Sophia Montgomery’s death—though she lacked concrete proof for that crime.

Then, she bought white chrysanthemums and made her way to Henry’s grave.

She placed the flowers carefully, lit candles, and bowed deeply.

"Grandpa, your killer will pay soon. I hope you can finally rest in peace."

Her voice wavered. "Even though your daughter was the one who switched me at birth, I’ll always be grateful for the love you gave me. You raised me as your own."

"If there’s another life, I hope we can be a real family then."

Tears blurred her vision as she traced the engraved letters on the tombstone.

Despite her anger toward Beatrice Caldwell, Evelyn knew—without Henry’s protection, she would have died long ago.

She stayed until the candles burned out. But as she turned to leave, she froze.

Alexander was walking toward her.

Dressed in all black, his dark hair tousled by the wind, he still carried that same aristocratic poise.

Evelyn’s expression hardened when she spotted the white chrysanthemums in his hands. "What are you doing here? How dare you show your face at my grandfather’s grave?"

Alexander ignored her insults. He approached the tombstone, placed his flowers, and bowed.

"Stop pretending," Evelyn spat. "If you hadn’t let Victoria get away with everything, my grandfather would still be alive. She’s a murderer, and you’re her accomplice."

Alexander stiffened.

He hadn’t known Victoria was involved in Henry’s death.

"Get out," Evelyn hissed. "Take your flowers and leave. Don’t you dare taint his resting place."

When Alexander didn’t move, she snatched his flowers and hurled them at his feet.

"Do you think a few flowers and a bow will make me forget what you did?" Her voice shook with fury. "Four years, Alexander. Four years, and I still remember how you desecrated his grave—how you dug up his ashes right in front of me, all for Victoria’s sake. Tell me—do you even regret it?"
###Chapter 451

The wind howled through the cemetery as Alexander stood frozen, the memories of that fateful day flooding back with painful clarity.

Snow had been falling heavily that afternoon. Evelyn had trembled violently, clutching the urn in her arms, her lips stained crimson. She had looked broken—like a discarded marionette—yet her eyes burned with defiance.

"Alexander," she had whispered, her voice raw. "Kill me. I never want to see you again."

Then, with a chilling finality: "You will regret this."

And he, arrogant to the last, had sneered, "Regret is a word I don’t recognize."

Now, Evelyn’s mocking laughter snapped him back to the present.

"What’s wrong? Remembering your sins?" Her voice dripped with venom. "Do you recall how eagerly you believed our child was a bastard? How you wanted to crush her bones to dust?"

Alexander flinched. The weight of his past cruelty pressed down on him like a suffocating shroud.

I finally understand the pain I caused you.

"Stop looking at me like that," Evelyn spat. "Your remorse means nothing. It won’t undo what you did."

Her gaze was icy, stripped of all warmth. No love. No longing. Only fury.

"You refused to help me when I begged for my grandfather’s life. You humiliated me in front of Victoria. You believed her lies—that I was unfaithful, that I was scheming for your money." Her voice cracked. "You let Margaret and Richard torture me. Do you have any idea what that felt like?"

She swallowed hard, her fingers curling into fists.

"Richard kicked me so hard I vomited blood. I couldn’t stand. But you—you carried her to the hospital instead." A bitter laugh escaped her. "All I ever did was love you. And that was my crime."

Tears welled in her eyes, but she refused to let them fall.

Alexander watched her in silence, his own vision blurring. The shards of their past cut deeper with every word.

"I will never forgive you."

His throat tightened. He forced a smile, fragile and resigned. "If you can’t love me, then hate me. At least I’ll still have a place in your mind."

Evelyn scoffed. "Delusional to the end."

She turned away, disgust twisting her features. "And stay away from Henry’s grave."

Without another word, she walked off, her figure disappearing into the winter haze.

Alexander knelt, carefully rearranging the white chrysanthemums before Henry’s tombstone. The wind answered his silent apology with a frigid gust.

Later, at the police station, he handed over a small evidence bag. Inside was a Chanel earring, its surface long stained with dried blood.

Victoria’s face drained of color when the officers informed her of the new charges—two counts of murder.

Panic seized her.

Evelyn’s identity must have been exposed.

If Alexander knew the truth, she was finished.

And sure enough, he appeared moments later, his presence casting a shadow over the interrogation room.

"Alexander," she stammered, forcing a weak smile. "You came to see me?"

Her trembling hands betrayed her fear.

His expression remained unreadable.

The game was over.
###Chapter 452

Alexander had never loved her. Not even for a single moment.

When her deception about being the little girl from their past was revealed, she became nothing to Alexander. Not even a stranger, despite sharing a child together.

"You seem to anticipate what's coming," Alexander stated icily. His towering frame advanced toward her, his dominating presence making her tremble.

Victoria shook her head with feigned innocence. "Alexander, I don't understand what you mean."

She forced tears to gather in her eyes, crafting the perfect picture of victimhood.

"Alexander, for the sake of our past and for Ethan's future, please get me out of here. I was framed—"

A cold chuckle cut her off.

"Do you know why you're still breathing?" he suddenly asked.

Victoria stared dumbly at the man whose terrifying aura intensified with every passing second.

"Because I've been waiting for Evelyn's decision."

Victoria's eyes widened in shock, her pulse racing with terror.

So he knew. Alexander knew Vivian was Evelyn and Evelyn was Vivian!

He called her 'Eve' with such tenderness. His eyes softened at the mere mention of her name. His love for Evelyn was undeniable.

"Eve told me she despises me. Hates me for everything I've done to her. Hates how I believed your lies and made her endure pain worse than death," he said, taking another step forward. His overwhelming presence forced Victoria to retreat until her back hit the cold cell wall.

Alexander's hand shot out, gripping her throat.

He lifted her effortlessly, his narrowed eyes burning with lethal intent.

Victoria gasped for air, her toes barely scraping the floor. Her face flushed crimson as panic set in. "A-Alexander... please... let me go..."

"Let you go? After everything?"

His fingers tightened, the murderous glint in his eyes growing darker.

"Do you know I fell for Evelyn the moment I saw her at university? If you hadn't appeared, claiming to be the girl from my past, I would never have treated her so cruelly!"

"Because of that damned promise, I let you hurt the woman I love without restraint. Because of you, I rejected my own child as illegitimate. But the truth is—you're nothing. Not the girl from my past, not the woman I love!"

Alexander's lips pressed into a thin line, his expression softening slightly.

"Evelyn has always been the one. She's the little girl I met at Pinecrest Heights all those years ago."

Victoria's eyes bulged with realization.

'He knows everything!'

He'd even discovered Evelyn was the girl from the beach!

Just as suffocation threatened to claim her, Alexander released his grip.

She collapsed to the floor, coughing violently, her body curling in pain.

Feeling his murderous gaze still upon her, she crawled to his feet. "Alexander... cough... I was wrong... Please... don't kill me... I don't... I don't want to die... cough... I-I can help make Evelyn forgive you... If you just—"

Alexander looked down at her with disdain. "If you think I'd believe another word from you, you're even more foolish than I thought."

"N-No, Alexander! It's true!" Victoria clutched at his trousers desperately. "The truth is... Evelyn's child with you... it's still alive."
###Chapter 453

The murderous glint in Alexander's eyes vanished.

He seized Victoria's wrist and yanked her forward. "Say that again."

Victoria inhaled his familiar scent greedily, tears streaming down her face.

Even as he glared at her with icy detachment, his striking features still made her heart ache.

She had missed him—even now, when he was furious.

"Alexander, I know I've done terrible things, but my love for you was real. I truly—"

"Spare me the theatrics," he cut in coldly. "Answer me. Is the child Evelyn and I had really alive?"

His menacing tone sent a chill down her spine.

Trembling, she met his gaze and nodded. "H-He's alive... still breathing..."

The frost in Alexander's eyes melted instantly. "Where is he? Where's my son?"

Victoria bit her cracked lip. "I want out of here first."

"You think you're in any position to bargain?" His grip tightened. "Tell me now, or you'll be worthless to me."

Her face paled.

Survival was her only option. "He's... always been near you."

A spark ignited in Alexander's eyes. "Ethan?"

The image of the little boy flashed in his mind.

Victoria clenched her teeth, resentment flaring as she saw the joy in Alexander's expression.

When she had faked her pregnancy and "given birth" to Ethan, Alexander had shown no such happiness.

But now?

Pure relief.

All because the child was his—and Evelyn's.

Without another word, Alexander turned and strode away. Victoria scrambled after him, but the cell door slammed shut in her face.

"Alexander! Please! I won't do it again! Forgive me—for the sake of what we once had! Alexander!"

Her desperate cries fell on deaf ears.

Outside the prison, Alexander slid into his car. His hands trembled slightly as he gripped the steering wheel.

Ethan is mine and Evelyn's son.

No wonder he was always distant from Victoria but so attached to Evelyn. He called her 'Mom' without hesitation.

Blood recognizes blood.

Ethan.

The name echoed in his mind, filling him with an overwhelming warmth.

He made a call, confirming Ethan's whereabouts. The boy had been staying with the Montgomeries.

Without wasting another second, Alexander sped toward Montgomery Manor.

When he arrived, he found Ethan in the garden's glasshouse. The little boy sat on a bench, completely absorbed in assembling a small gadget.

His rosy cheeks were slightly flushed, his delicate fingers moving with precision. His bright eyes flickered with concentration.

Alexander's chest tightened as he approached.

Ethan must have sensed his presence, because he looked up. His lips parted in surprise.

"Daddy."

That single word struck Alexander like sunlight breaking through storm clouds.
###Chapter 454

Five years had passed, and this was the first time Alexander felt Ethan's voice sounded so sweet when he called him "Daddy."

He moved closer to the boy and knelt down. His gaze softened as he studied the small face before him. Maybe it was just his imagination, but in this moment, Ethan looked more and more like Evelyn.

"Ethan," Alexander murmured gently, suppressing the emotions swelling in his chest.

The little boy nodded eagerly. "Daddy, when can I go home? I miss Mommy. Not my mommy but Vivian." He emphasized the last part carefully.

Alexander's heart clenched. "Ethan, Vivian is your mommy. You only have one mommy. Never forget that."

"I won't," Ethan promised solemnly. He waved the small object in his hands. "I'm almost done with this bunny. When I finish, I'll give it to Mommy to keep her safe."

As the child explained his invention, Alexander realized it was a miniature self-defense device. He marveled at how a five-year-old could possess such technical skill. Then he remembered the microchipped bracelet he'd once given Evelyn - perhaps talent ran in the family.

Eleanor emerged from the house carrying tea and snacks. She stopped abruptly when she saw Alexander. "Mr. Blackwood! When did you arrive? Are you here to take Ethan home?"

Alexander rose slowly as Eleanor approached.

"Grandma!" Ethan chirped, his voice bubbling with a joy Alexander had never heard before.

He knew this transformation was entirely Evelyn's doing. Victoria had dragged this innocent child into darkness, but his real mother - Evelyn - had brought him back into the light.

"What a good boy you are, Ethan." Eleanor stroked the child's hair affectionately before sighing wistfully. "Though Victoria's actions were despicable, and William and I despise her completely, Ethan is innocent. He's such an obedient, intelligent child. We've truly come to love him as our own grandson."

She hesitated before adding, "Mr. Blackwood, if you're too busy to care for Ethan, William and I would be honored to continue raising him. We'd like your permission to keep him with us."

Alexander's lips curved into a rare, genuine smile. "You don't need to treat him like a grandson."

Eleanor's face fell. "What? Are you saying we can't see Ethan anymore? But why? We genuinely love him, and—"

"You misunderstand," Alexander interrupted gently. "That's not what I meant."

Eleanor blinked in confusion. "Then what are you saying, Mr. Blackwood?"

"I'm saying Ethan is actually your biological grandson."

Eleanor froze. "W-what? Ethan is my real grandson? H-how can that be?"

Alexander nodded, a self-deprecating smile playing on his lips. "Ethan isn't Victoria's child. He's Evelyn's son."

"What?" Eleanor gasped, torn between shock and overwhelming emotion.

When she'd learned Evelyn was her daughter, her heart had shattered. With Evelyn gone, she'd believed all hope was lost.

But if she still had a living grandson... perhaps her broken heart could begin to heal.

"There's more you should know," Alexander continued, his eyes softening. "Evelyn is still alive."

Eleanor's breath caught.

"Vivian is Evelyn."
###Chapter 455

Crash!

The porcelain teacup slipped from Eleanor Kingsley's trembling fingers, shattering against the marble floor.

Her hands remained suspended in midair, frozen in shock.

"W-What did you just say...? Vivian is Evelyn...?" Eleanor whispered, her vision blurring as tears welled up in her eyes. The only image she could focus on was Evelyn Sinclair's striking face.

She hadn't suspected a thing. Of course, she had wished—prayed—that her daughter was still alive. And over these past few months, she had grown inexplicably fond of Vivian.

She should have been overjoyed.

Yet, an inexplicable ache twisted in her chest.

William Montgomery emerged from the study at the sound of the crash. Seeing Eleanor standing there, tears streaming down her face, he rushed to her side, concern etching deep lines into his forehead.

"Ellie, what's wrong? Why are you crying?" He glanced at Alexander Blackwood, confusion darkening his gaze. "Mr. Blackwood, when did you arrive? Why is Ellie so upset? Are you here to take Ethan home?"

Alexander gently stroked Ethan's hair. "I'm not taking him back. Mrs. Kingsley isn't sad—she's happy."

"Happy?" William's bewilderment deepened.

Before he could question further, Eleanor spun around and seized his hands. "William, our daughter is alive!"

"What?" His breath caught. "Ellie, what are you saying?"

Tears spilled freely down Eleanor's cheeks. "Vivian is actually Evelyn! She's our precious girl, our Evelyn! She's alive!"

William's heart hammered against his ribs. "Vivian is Evelyn...?"

Eleanor collapsed against his shoulder, sobbing uncontrollably—a storm of joy and sorrow. "William, it's a miracle. Our daughter is alive. She's alive! Thank God!"

William's own eyes burned with unshed tears. Swallowing the lump in his throat, he wrapped his arms around Eleanor, steadying her. But he couldn't wait another second.

"Where is she? Where's Evelyn? I need to see her—now."

"Mr. Blackwood, you must know where she is, don't you? Please, tell us!" Eleanor pleaded, desperation lacing her voice.

Alexander's expression darkened, an unspoken bitterness tightening his jaw. "Try Blackwood Enterprises. She might still be in the CEO's office."

Without another word, Eleanor and William bolted for the door, not even bothering to change out of their house clothes.

"Where are Grandpa and Grandma going?" Ethan blinked up at Alexander, puzzled.

"They're going to find your mommy," Alexander murmured, crouching to meet the boy's curious gaze. His fingers brushed tenderly through Ethan's soft hair.

"Ethan... Daddy made a terrible mistake. I failed you and your mommy."

Ethan tilted his head, not fully understanding. Then, Alexander pulled him into a fierce embrace.

"I promise you this—from now on, I will spend every moment making it up to you both."

Winter evenings arrived swiftly, draping the city in early darkness.

Evelyn finished signing the last document and called Olivia Bennett, gathering her coat and bag.

As she stepped out of her office, the receptionist hurried over. "Miss Prescott, just now—"

"Miss Quinn is fine," Evelyn corrected smoothly.

"My apologies, Miss Quinn." The receptionist flushed. "The front desk just called—Mr. and Mrs. Kingsley are here to see you urgently. They're on their way up now."

Evelyn nodded, her expression unreadable. "Understood. Thank you."

Without another word, she stepped into the private elevator, the doors sliding shut behind her.

At that exact moment, the adjacent elevator dinged open. Through the narrowing gap of her closing doors, Evelyn caught a fleeting glimpse of Eleanor and William's frantic figures.

Her gaze remained cool, detached—until the metal sealed her away.

Eleanor and William rushed to the receptionist the second they stepped out.

"Is Miss Quinn still here?" William demanded.

The receptionist gestured helplessly toward the private elevator. "She just left."
###Chapter 456

"She's gone? Where to? Do you know?" Eleanor demanded, her voice trembling with urgency.

The receptionist hesitated before answering, "At this hour, she might be heading home."

"Home..." The word tasted bitter on Eleanor's tongue as she stood frozen.

Home.

The Montgomery Estate should have been her rightful home. Yet Eleanor and William didn't dare hope she'd return with them.

Perhaps she never would.

Eleanor remembered Evelyn's words two days ago when she'd come for Ethan. She'd said it would be her last visit.

Back then, Eleanor hadn't understood. Now, the meaning cut deep.

Overcome with remorse, Eleanor broke into uncontrollable sobs.

William pulled her close. "Ellie, don't. We'll find Evelyn again."

"She won't want to see us. She must despise us..." Eleanor's eyes burned as she recalled that hospital day - the day she'd learned Evelyn was her flesh and blood, the day she'd nearly taken her own life in shame.

That moment when Evelyn had called her "Mom."

She'd thought it was just to stop her from jumping.

But it had been genuine.

The memory of Evelyn's voice saying that single word became both the sweetest melody and most painful dagger in Eleanor's heart.

Meanwhile, Evelyn drove toward her meeting with Olivia.

The Mexican cantina overflowed with patrons, its air thick with cumin and chili. Several diners did double-takes seeing Evelyn - this ethereal beauty who looked like she dined on moonbeams, here for street tacos.

"Maddie! Over here!" Olivia waved enthusiastically.

Evelyn spotted not just Olivia but Nathaniel's gentle smile too. She slid into the booth, warmth spreading through her at the loaded tacos before her.

She remembered sharing spicy street tacos with Nathaniel years ago. Even then, his eyes had held that knowing dread - he'd already guessed her time was limited.

Funny how life had other plans.

"How's your recovery, Maddie?" Nathaniel asked with genuine concern.

Evelyn gave a small smile. "All better now."

"You absolutely did the right thing!" Olivia blurted. "After seeing Blackwood Enterprises' stock crash this week - Alexander deserved worse after everything he did to you! Losing his company and reputation is nothing compared to what you and your baby—"

Olivia abruptly bit her tongue. "God, I'm sorry. That was insensitive."

"It's fine," Evelyn said softly. "Actually...my first child might still be alive."

"What?!" Olivia's fork clattered to the table.

Nathaniel's eyes widened. "Alive?"

Evelyn nodded. "But Victoria hid her. I don't know where she is."

"That witch!" Olivia started, then her gaze snapped to something behind Evelyn. She slammed her hands on the table, standing abruptly. "How did you find us? What do you want?"
###Chapter 457

Nathaniel turned, his gaze shifting. His brows knitted together instantly, his expression darkening.

Evelyn didn’t need to look behind her. Olivia and Nathaniel’s reactions told her exactly who had arrived.

Murmurs rippled through the crowd. A group of women nearby blushed, their whispers carrying.

"That man is breathtaking!"

"Isn’t that the CEO of Blackwood Enterprises?"

"It’s Alexander Blackwood! I recognize him from the business magazines!"

Evelyn set her chopsticks down calmly, not sparing a single glance backward. "Olivia, Nate, let’s go somewhere else. I don’t want distractions."

Olivia shot Alexander a glare, fists clenched. "Fine. Let’s get out of here, Evelyn. Nate, come on."

Nathaniel stood, his eyes burning with quiet fury as they locked onto Alexander.

Evelyn grabbed her purse. When she turned, Alexander was already blocking her path.

Dressed in a sleek black leather jacket, he carried the chill of the winter night with him. But his eyes—usually so cold—were warm, almost tender.

"I know you don’t want to see me," he murmured. "But there’s something I need to say."

Evelyn glanced at Olivia and Nathaniel, forcing a smile. "Give me a minute."

Without waiting for Alexander, she strode outside, the icy wind biting at her skin. Under the flickering streetlight, her delicate features looked even more unyielding.

"Mr. Blackwood," she said, voice dripping with sarcasm. "You always manage to track me down. What now? Here to accuse me of cheating again? News flash—I’m not your wife anymore. You lost the right to question me the moment you signed those divorce papers."

Her words were sharp, meant to wound.

Alexander remembered the last time he’d seen her with Nathaniel—laughing over street food, carefree. Back then, the sight had twisted something inside him.

Now, he understood.

It had been jealousy.

He hated himself for not realizing it sooner.

"Vivian," he said softly, using her new name. "I know you’d rather be Vivian Prescott than Evelyn Sinclair or Eveline Montgomery. Those names carry too much pain."

"Is that all?" Evelyn cut in coldly. "Alexander, stop wasting my time. If you’re so desperate for company, go visit Victoria in prison. After all, she was always the one you loved."

"The woman I’ve loved all these years was never Victoria," Alexander denied. He stepped closer, pulling a faded, colorful shell from his pocket.

Evelyn froze.

"You might not believe me, but it’s true. It’s always been you."

She laughed, the sound brittle. "Me?" Her voice dripped with mockery. "If love means destroying someone, then yours is truly extraordinary."

Her gaze dropped to the shell. Tears pricked her eyes, but she refused to let them fall.

"When I gave you this, I genuinely wished for your happiness," she whispered. "Now? I dream of you suffering."

The words struck like a knife.

Alexander’s chest ached.

Evelyn snatched the shell from his hand. Without hesitation, she hurled it into the busy street, where it vanished beneath passing cars.

Then she turned, walking away without a single backward glance.

Straight to Olivia and Nathaniel.

Where she belonged.
###Chapter 458

Alexander stood motionless in the biting wind, his gaze fixed on Evelyn's retreating figure. The streetlight cast his tall, lean silhouette into a solitary shadow against the pavement.

A bitter smile twisted his lips as anguish spread through his chest like poison.

His vision blurred with unshed tears, making the woman walking away appear distorted and distant.

How could he blame her for being cold? This pain was entirely of his own making.

...

After dinner with Olivia and Nathaniel, Evelyn returned alone to her old apartment.

She sat by the bay window, Alexander's words echoing relentlessly in her mind.

'The person I love is you.'

"Ha."

Her laugh came out sharp and humorless.

'No one who truly loves someone could hurt them so deeply.'

'Alexander, don't you dare claim to love me now. Not after killing my heart with your cruelty.'

Buzz. Buzz.

Her phone vibrated insistently on the nightstand.

Evelyn blinked away her thoughts and glanced at the caller ID - Eleanor Kingsley.

'If they were searching for me so desperately earlier, they must know I'm their daughter.'

She watched the phone tremble across the surface, letting it ring four times before answering.

There was a stunned pause on the other end before Eleanor spoke. "Miss Prescott?"

Evelyn's breath caught at the formal address.

Did they not know? Had Alexander kept the truth from them?

"What's so urgent that you called five times?" Evelyn kept her voice carefully neutral.

Eleanor struggled to control her emotions. "Miss Prescott, Ethan can't sleep again. He's asking for you - wants you to sing him a lullaby. Could you come now?"

Evelyn's resolve wavered at the mention of the boy. Despite herself, she felt that familiar pull toward him.

"I'll be there shortly. Tell Ethan to wait for me."

"Yes! Of course! We'll be waiting!" Eleanor's voice trembled with barely contained emotion.

Something in Eleanor's shaky tone set off alarms in Evelyn's mind.

But she pushed the thought aside, changed clothes, and drove to Montgomery Manor.

Ten minutes later, she pulled up to the estate gates. Her breath hitched when she saw William and Eleanor waiting at the entrance.

Their expectant postures confirmed her suspicions.

She parked but hesitated before opening the door. Through the rearview mirror, she saw William's red-rimmed eyes and Eleanor's tear-streaked face contorted with grief.

Her fingers froze on the seatbelt clasp.

Seeing her hesitation, Eleanor rushed to the car window, knocking with trembling hands. Her desperate, hopeful gaze locked onto Evelyn's. "Miss Prescott, won't you come out?" she pleaded through her tears.
###Chapter 459

The car window remained shut, yet Evelyn could distinctly hear the tremor in Eleanor's voice.

Eleanor was clearly battling powerful emotions, and Evelyn recognized them instantly.

Tap. Tap. Tap.

Eleanor rapped lightly against the glass again.

Her knocks were hesitant—too soft to be demanding, yet too desperate to be ignored.

"Miss Prescott... Vivian..."

At the sound of her name, Evelyn clicked open her seatbelt.

William and Eleanor's faces brightened with hope when they saw her finally exiting the vehicle.

The car door swung open.

Meeting their tearful, expectant gazes, Evelyn remained composed. "Is Ethan in his room?" she asked quietly.

They nodded vigorously. "He's waiting for you!"

"I see." Without another word, Evelyn turned toward the mansion.

Their broken whispers followed her—"Evelyn..."—but she didn't look back.

Old wounds throbbed beneath her skin, both physical and emotional.

She tried suppressing the memories, but the pain spread like ink in water, staining every thought.

Ethan's bedroom door stood ajar. The boy sat propped against pillows, engrossed in a picture book.

At the sound of footsteps, his head snapped up.

His entire face illuminated when he saw her.

"Mommy!" The word flowed as naturally as breathing.

Honey-sweet warmth pooled around Evelyn's fractured heart.

"Ethan, why are you still awake? It's past bedtime." She perched on the mattress, smoothing his tousled hair.

"If staying up means seeing you, I'll never sleep again."

Evelyn chuckled at his earnest declaration.

"Such a charmer. You'll break hearts when you're older."

"Only yours matters, Mommy." Ethan's serious expression dissolved into a grin as he grabbed something from his nightstand—a handmade bunny-shaped device.

"This is for you. My bunny guardian will protect you from bad people."

Evelyn's breath caught. She cradled the tiny self-defense gadget, stunned.

She hadn't realized how deeply she'd rooted herself in this child's heart.

Tears pricked her eyes as she pulled him close.

"My sweet boy," she whispered into his hair. "You may not be mine by blood, but I love you fiercely. I'll keep us both safe."

The embrace tightened as she thought of the daughter she'd lost—the child she'd never held, never comforted.

How she longed to whisper those same words to her own flesh and blood.
###Chapter 460

Eleanor and William witnessed the heartbreaking scene from outside the room, their chests tightening with unbearable anguish.

They dared not interrupt. Nor could they reveal the devastating truth—that Ethan was actually Evelyn's biological son—without careful deliberation.

Eleanor clapped a hand over her mouth. Swallowing her sobs, she turned and fled down the hallway.

"Ellie!" William called after her in a hushed tone. After one last longing glance at Evelyn, he chased after his distraught wife.

Eleanor collapsed onto their bed, burying her face in the pillows as gut-wrenching sobs wracked her body.

Though equally devastated, William forced himself to remain composed. As her husband, he needed to be her anchor in this storm.

"Ellie, please," he murmured, rubbing her trembling shoulders. "Our daughter is alive and thriving. That's what matters most."

His words only made Eleanor weep harder.

Of course she was grateful Evelyn had survived.

But memories flooded her mind—the times she'd struck Evelyn, the cruel words she'd hurled, the day she'd watched her daughter cough up blood while accusing her of faking illness.

Each recollection stabbed through Eleanor like shards of glass.

"What kind of monster hits her own child?" Eleanor rasped, lifting tear-swollen eyes. "I called her vile names. I told her she deserved to be abandoned. I—"

"Stop." William's voice broke as his Adam's apple bobbed. The same horrific memories tormented him—his own cruelty, his blind trust in Victoria's lies.

Eleanor gasped for air between sobs. "She looked at me with those eyes—my eyes—and I didn't see it! How could I not recognize my own flesh and blood?"

"I failed too," William admitted hoarsely. "Every time I saw Evelyn, something felt familiar. But Victoria's poison clouded my judgment."

"William, we don't deserve her forgiveness." Eleanor clung to him like a drowning woman.

He held her tightly, taking a shuddering breath. "You're right. We've forfeited any right to call ourselves her parents."

"Then what—"

"Let's give Evelyn the choice," William decided. "However she wants to proceed...we'll accept it."

Eleanor understood. The thought of rejection terrified her, but forcing themselves into Evelyn's life would be another betrayal.

William gently wiped her tears. "If she never calls me 'Father,' I'll still thank God every day that she's alive and well."

Knock. Knock. Knock.

A maid's voice filtered through the door. "Sir, Madam? Young Master Ethan has fallen asleep. Miss Prescott asked me to inform you she's leaving."

"Tell her we'll be right down," William responded.

They quickly splashed water on their puffy faces. After composing themselves, they hurried downstairs.

Spotting Evelyn in the foyer, they forced smiles. "Miss Prescott," they greeted in unison.
###Chapter 461

The moment Evelyn heard voices behind her, she turned with deliberate slowness. Eleanor and William stood there, their faces adorned with tentative smiles.

Their expressions couldn't mask the turbulent emotions swirling beneath the surface - guilt, apprehension, and desperate hope.

Evelyn decided there was no point in pretense anymore. The charade had gone on long enough.

"I suppose you already know the truth?" Her voice remained steady, betraying none of the storm inside.

William and Eleanor froze. Their shocked expressions confirmed everything.

After an uncomfortable silence, Eleanor spoke hesitantly, "Miss Prescott—"

"Miss Prescott," Evelyn repeated with a humorless smile, cutting her off. "Shouldn't you be calling me Evelyn Sinclair now?"

The air between them grew heavy.

Eleanor's breath hitched audibly. William's hands trembled at his sides.

Tears welled in Eleanor's eyes as she stared at the woman before her - her daughter, alive after all these years.

"Evelyn!" The name burst from Eleanor's lips as she rushed forward, arms outstretched.

Her fingers trembled as they brushed Evelyn's cheek, tracing the familiar contours she'd dreamed of for decades. "My baby," she sobbed, pulling Evelyn into a crushing embrace. "I've found you at last. Forgive me, please forgive me!"

William approached more slowly, his eyes red-rimmed. "We're so sorry, child," he choked out, his hand hovering uncertainly before resting gently on Evelyn's head.

Evelyn remained statue-still amidst their emotional outpouring. She neither resisted nor returned their embraces, allowing the flood of long-suppressed parental affection to wash over her without response.

Only the faint flutter of her eyelashes betrayed any reaction at all.

The moment stretched until Evelyn's phone buzzed insistently in her pocket. Eleanor reluctantly loosened her grip, though her tear-filled eyes never left Evelyn's face.

Evelyn glanced at the screen before silencing the call.

"Bring the finest Earl Grey and some pastries," Eleanor commanded the waiting staff, her voice thick with emotion. "Evelyn, darling, sit with us. Let me look at you properly."

She reached for Evelyn's hand, but Evelyn stepped back smoothly, evading the contact.

Eleanor's face fell. "Evelyn—"

"I'll be leaving shortly." Evelyn's tone remained cool. "There's no need for such hospitality, Mr. and Mrs. Kingsley."

The words hung between them like an impenetrable wall.
###Chapter 462

Eleanor and William froze when they heard how Evelyn addressed them. Their faces paled with visible distress.

"Evelyn..." Eleanor's voice cracked with emotion.

Evelyn's lips curved into a faint smile as she glanced around the lavish parlor. Her fingers trailed along the velvet upholstery of the French sofa.

"That dinner invitation you extended for Victoria's sake—how gracious you were to entertain your enemy. The irony must taste bitter now that the truth is out."

William's hands trembled. "Darling, please—"

"Mrs. Kingsley," Evelyn interrupted smoothly, "you once asked if I'd found my parents after all these years." Her gaze locked onto Eleanor's tear-filled eyes. "Do you recall my answer?"

"Evelyn, let me explain—"

"I said I found them," Evelyn continued, voice like shattering crystal. "Yet reunion was impossible because even standing before them, I remained unrecognizable."

Eleanor clutched Evelyn's wrist, tears streaking her carefully applied makeup. "We were blind! That viper Victoria manipulated us—"

"Explanations are unnecessary." Evelyn extracted herself with glacial poise. "Some bonds aren't meant to be."

William stepped forward, his aristocratic features twisted in anguish. "For twenty years, your mother kept your childhood room untouched. She polished every surface daily, praying for your return."

"Home?" Evelyn's laugh held razor blades. She swept a hand across the gilded furnishings. "This mausoleum? These cold walls that sheltered my tormentor while I rotted in hell?"

The Montgomery heirlooms rattled as Eleanor collapsed onto the chaise lounge. "We'll spend our lives making amends—"

"You felt remorse when discovering Evelyn Sinclair was your blood," Evelyn mused, examining a Venetian vase. "But tell me—when you had me beaten for Sophia's murder, did your hands shake?"

William staggered as if struck. "You knew then? But the police—"

"Ah yes, the proud Montgomery legacy." Evelyn's smile turned feral. "Your darling Victoria framed me perfectly. And you? You called me a monster while I memorized your faces through bloodied vision."

The grandfather clock's ticking grew deafening.

"I never cried during those beatings." Evelyn tilted her head, sunlight catching the scar along her jawline. "Do you know why? Tears would have blurred my last sight of the parents who condemned their own daughter to death."

Eleanor's wail echoed through the marble halls as Evelyn turned toward the exit. Her stiletto heels clicked like a countdown to devastation.

"Wait!" William choked out. "The inheritance—the family shares—"

Evelyn paused at the threshold without looking back. "Keep your blood money. The only thing I inherited from you..." She touched her scarred wrist. "...was the ability to endure fire."

The door clicked shut, leaving two broken aristocrats amidst their gilded ruin. Outside, Evelyn inhaled the autumn air, her whispered words carried away by the wind:

"Checkmate."
###Chapter 463

Eleanor Kingsley was already sobbing uncontrollably after Evelyn spoke. William Montgomery could no longer hold back his tears either.

They remembered the day they visited Evelyn in the prison visitation room after Sophia's murder.

Evelyn's face had been ghostly pale, her eyes hollow. That haunting image kept replaying in their minds, along with the cruel way they had treated her.

They had hurled insults and accusations at Evelyn, all to protect Victoria. William had even struck Evelyn so hard that she collapsed to the floor, weak and broken.

Now, the memory tore through their hearts like shards of glass.

The weight of their remorse was unbearable.

Eleanor and William couldn't fathom how Evelyn had remained so composed in that moment.

Yet here she stood, just as strong as ever. A faint smile touched her lips as she recalled her painful past.

"It's all behind me now," she said softly, though disappointment flickered in her eyes.

"I don't blame you for falling for Victoria's carefully crafted lies. What hurts is that my own parents couldn't see the truth. Even after learning the depths of her cruelty, you still chose her side."

"Evelyn—"

"When that pendant fell from me, I stole Mrs. Kingsley's toothbrush from the hospital to test our DNA. I knew there was something unusual between us, but you were so convinced I had stolen Victoria's pendant. Maybe it was fate. We were meant to meet, but never meant to be family."

Her gaze swept over Eleanor before settling on William, whose regret was palpable.

"Even though I never got to know a parent's love, I still thank you for bringing me into this world. The one thing I wanted most was a family. The person I loved most was never truly mine. I won't beg for what wasn't meant to be."

Without another word, Evelyn turned and walked away.

"Evelyn! Evelyn!" Eleanor wailed, stumbling after her with William close behind. But Evelyn didn't stop.

From behind, she looked untouchable. Free.

Yet tears blurred Evelyn's vision, though neither Eleanor nor William could see them.

The dim glow of streetlights cast long shadows as she walked, her steps steady despite the ache in her chest.

Eleanor rushed outside just in time to see Evelyn's car disappear into the night.

Overcome, Eleanor collapsed onto the icy pavement, her cries raw with grief. "Evelyn, my daughter—I'm sorry! Please, forgive me!"

William dropped to one knee beside her, pulling Eleanor into his arms as she wept.

Snow began to fall, delicate flakes swirling around them. The cold seeped into their bones, but it was nothing compared to the agony in their hearts.

—

Evelyn's phone buzzed on the drive home.

She glanced at the screen. Alexander Blackwood.

She ignored it. Without hesitation, she blocked his number.

Back at her apartment, she showered and slipped into bed, exhaustion pulling her under.

The next morning, Sebastian Whitman called.

Evelyn dressed quickly and headed to Blackwood Enterprises.

When she arrived, Sebastian greeted her with a rare smile, his dark eyes warm like polished onyx.

She returned the smile before leading him to the office that had once belonged to Alexander.

Sebastian gazed out the floor-to-ceiling windows, watching snowflakes dance between skyscrapers before settling over the city below.

A smirk tugged at his lips. "This position was never Alexander's to begin with."

His voice carried quiet resentment, his eyes flashing with something darker.
###Chapter 464

Evelyn understood his bitterness. How could mere reputation ever heal the shattered pieces of a broken family?

Sebastian turned to face her. The dangerous glint in his eyes vanished as quickly as it had appeared, replaced by nothing but warmth.

"Vivian, from this moment on, everything will belong to us."

Evelyn smiled and nodded. "It's yours. Blackwood Enterprises was always meant to be in your hands. I never intended to keep it. Now that it's returned to you, justice has been served."

Sebastian looked stunned. "You don’t want any part of this?"

"What I want most is to see Alexander broken and stripped of everything," Evelyn murmured, her brow furrowing in thought.

"Yet... I can’t shake the feeling that hacking into his system was too easy. It’s almost as if he let me do it."

"You think he knew what you were planning and didn’t stop you?" Sebastian’s expression darkened.

Evelyn fell silent. Alexander’s words echoed relentlessly in her mind. "The only person I’ve ever loved is you."

"Vivian? Vivian?"

"Hmm?"

She blinked, snapping back to reality as she met Sebastian’s tender gaze.

"What’s on your mind?" he asked gently.

"Sebastian…" She hesitated before speaking. "Could you leave Blackwood Estate untouched?"

His grip on her shoulders tightened, his expression turning grave. "Vivian, don’t be fooled by that old man. He orchestrated my parents' deaths just to seize the Blackwood fortune. He’s not the benevolent grandfather you think he is."

Evelyn bit her lip, conflicted.

Was Henry truly that ruthless?

If so, why had he shown her such kindness?

Even knowing she sought revenge, he had stood by her.

"Vivian." Sebastian’s voice was soft, like a spring breeze against her skin.

When she focused again, he was holding her hands, his eyes burning with emotion.

"You keep saying I saved you these past three years. But the truth is, you saved me."

"Huh?" She didn’t understand.

He didn’t elaborate, only tightening his grip, his gaze more intense than ever.

"Now that everything is settled, I have just one wish." He took a deep breath. "Marry me. Be my wife. I’ll spend my life cherishing you, protecting you. I’ll give you and Amelia everything you deserve. Vivian… will you marry me?"

Evelyn had always known Sebastian’s feelings for her. But beyond gratitude, she felt nothing romantic.

Still, she had promised herself long ago—if he ever proposed, she wouldn’t refuse.

She hesitated, then met his hopeful eyes with a soft smile.

Just as she parted her lips to answer, a cold, commanding voice cut through the office.

"She won’t."

Evelyn froze.

Her gaze snapped up—and there stood Alexander, his expression icy as he strode toward them with lethal grace.
###Chapter 465

Evelyn gasped when Alexander appeared out of nowhere.

For reasons she couldn’t explain, a strange sense of relief washed over her.

Sebastian’s expression darkened. His heartfelt confession and proposal had been rudely interrupted. The usual warmth in his eyes vanished, replaced by irritation. "Alexander, what are you doing here? You have no business in this company anymore."

Alexander’s sharp gaze flicked to Sebastian before settling on Evelyn’s face.

When their eyes met, his hardened stare softened.

"I know you despise me. I know you wish I were dead. I’ve endured every punishment you’ve thrown at me—but I won’t stand by and watch you marry him."

His voice left no room for argument. The dominance in his tone was unmistakable.

Evelyn opened her mouth to respond, but Sebastian’s mocking laughter cut her off.

"You won’t allow it?" he sneered. "Who do you think you are? Have you forgotten how you treated Evelyn? Where were you when she was sick and bleeding? Off enjoying yourself with another woman. When she was alone, desperate for even a shred of your trust—what did you do? You told her to die."

Sebastian stepped closer, his smirk widening. "Alexander, ask yourself—what right do you have to interfere in Evelyn’s life? She’s not tied to you anymore. And frankly, you don’t deserve her."

Alexander’s jaw clenched. His eyes darkened with shame, and he couldn’t bring himself to look at Evelyn.

Sebastian smirked at his defeated posture.

He draped an arm around Evelyn’s shoulders. "Vivian, let’s go."

Evelyn nodded, her cold gaze sweeping over Alexander’s profile.

His lips were pressed tightly together, his handsome face etched with a bitterness she’d never seen before.

She didn’t dwell on his thoughts. Without hesitation, she walked away with Sebastian.

Alexander remained frozen in place, his expression hollow.

When he finally left Blackwood Enterprises, he drove aimlessly, the city blurring past him. Eventually, he stopped at Pinecrest Heights, staring at the endless ocean.

Memories of his cruelty toward Evelyn flooded his mind.

Her desperate pleas. The way she had loved him from afar, too broken to reach for him. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t escape them.

A cold wind whipped around him. His eyes burned red as he swallowed back a silent sob.

Snow settled on his shoulders, the chill seeping into his bones.

He stood motionless, the waves crashing against the shore like the pain crashing against his heart.

He didn’t know how long he stayed there.

Only the urgent call from Margaret Blackwood pulled him away.

At first, he ignored it—until she mentioned Evelyn.

He sped back to Blackwood Estate.

The moment he stepped inside, Margaret rushed toward him, frantic. "Alexander, has that woman lost her mind? First, she and Sebastian take over Blackwood Enterprises—now she wants this house too? That shameless—"

"Enough," Alexander snapped, his icy tone silencing her instantly.

Margaret pursed her lips. "Did I say anything untrue? If she can do it, why can’t I say it? Hmph, what did we ever do to her? She got what she deserved back then. Why is she back for revenge now?"

Alexander’s gaze turned glacial. "You dare say that?"

Margaret fell silent.
###Chapter 466

"If this will bring Evelyn peace, I'll do anything."

"What?" Margaret Blackwood's eyes widened in shock. "Alexander, what are you saying? You despised that woman for years. Have you truly fallen for Evelyn?"

Alexander didn't answer. But the softening of his gaze spoke volumes.

"I'll arrange for you to move out soon. Don't bother me unless it's urgent."

He turned to leave, only to freeze when he saw the old man standing in his path.

Henry Blackwood gripped his cane, his stern expression belying the warmth in his aged eyes.

"Follow me," he commanded before turning away.

Alexander hesitated for only a moment before trailing after him.

Study.

The old master stood before the floor-to-ceiling windows, staring at the overcast sky. A heavy sigh escaped him.

"What are your plans now?"

"Don't worry, Grandfather. Losing Blackwood Enterprises is temporary. I'll reclaim it."

Alexander's voice was firm, resolute.

Henry sighed again before turning to face him. "I'm not asking about the company. You know what I mean."

Silence.

Alexander knew exactly what his grandfather was referring to—Evelyn.

The old man tapped his cane against the hardwood floor as he approached. "You've always known things others didn't. When you married Evelyn, you came to me. You begged me to officiate that wedding."

Alexander's pulse stuttered at the memory.

Then, Henry continued.

"Everyone—including Evelyn—believed you were forced into that marriage. But the truth? You wanted her. You always did."

A flicker of panic crossed Alexander's face.

He looked like a guilty child caught in a lie.

Henry scoffed at his hesitation. "You loved her long before that wedding. You married her to claim her as yours before anyone else could. So why deny it? Why hurt her?"

A bitter smile twisted Alexander's lips. "I was wrong."

"Then fix it."

"She won't forgive me." His voice cracked. "She doesn't love me anymore."

The words burned like acid in his throat. The pain was unbearable—sharp, relentless.

Henry studied him. "I don't know if Evelyn still loves you. But I do know she'll never get too close to Sebastian."

Alexander's head snapped up. "What are you hiding, Grandfather? Why does Sebastian hate me so much?"
###Chapter 467

Alexander stood before the elderly patriarch, voicing the question that had haunted him for weeks. The old man gazed at the stormy clouds gathering overhead, his eyes clouded with decades-old sorrow. "This tale begins twenty-three winters past..."

As the narrative unfolded, transporting them back two decades, realization dawned on Alexander. This had to concern Sebastian's parents.

The revelation confirmed his suspicions with chilling clarity. Sebastian Whitman wasn't just dangerous - he was a viper coiled around Evelyn's life. Alexander couldn't permit their closeness to continue.

As he turned to leave, the patriarch's gnarled hand caught his sleeve. "Evelyn will learn the truth eventually. Sebastian stood by her during her darkest hours - she trusts him implicitly. Meanwhile, she despises you. Your warnings would fall on deaf ears."

"I don't seek her belief," Alexander's voice dropped to a growl, his jaw tightening. "But I'll be damned before I let that snake deceive her further."

His departure halted abruptly when a photograph on the mahogany desk caught his eye. Moving closer, he lifted the silver frame with trembling fingers.

Two silver-haired men in military uniforms stood proudly at attention, their youthful vigor preserved in monochrome. One was clearly Henry Blackwood. The other... Alexander's breath hitched.

The beach behind them - Pinecrest Heights. And there, in the background, two children played tag along the shoreline. The boy was unmistakably himself. The girl...

That radiant smile had haunted his dreams for years. The same child who'd pressed a seashell into his small palm - young Evelyn Sinclair.

The patriarch approached, his voice thick with nostalgia. "Now you understand why I've always protected Evelyn. Her grandfather was my sworn brother."

Alexander's throat constricted. The second man was Henry Whitmore - Evelyn's late grandfather.

"That summer at Pinecrest, I brought you to recover from your studies. By fate's design, I reunited with my old comrade - and his granddaughter Evelyn." A wistful smile touched the old man's lips. "We joked about uniting our families through marriage. He agreed readily... Then vanished without word. Only recently did I learn of his passing."

The photograph slipped from Alexander's grasp as an unnamed grief seized his chest. Through blurred vision, he studied Evelyn's innocent smile one final time before silently quitting the room.

Night had fallen when Alexander's Bentley pulled up outside Evelyn's loft. Through the illuminated windows, her silhouette moved gracefully about the space, softening his hardened features.

Then Sebastian appeared behind her.

Alexander's grip on the steering wheel turned his knuckles white. That unfamiliar burn in his chest - jealousy? The sensation was foreign yet undeniable.

Slamming the car door, he retrieved a bottle of bourbon from the trunk. The icy wind howled around him as he drank, his gaze never wavering from her window.

Snowflakes stung his skin, but Alexander barely registered the cold. Time crawled as Sebastian remained inside.

Midnight approached. Was that bastard planning to stay?
###Chapter 468

The lights in the apartment flickered out.

Alexander's breath hitched as his thoughts spiraled.

He tossed the empty wine bottle into the bin and turned without hesitation.

But just as he was about to step inside, Sebastian Whitman emerged from the building.

Some of Alexander's pent-up frustration eased. He paused, watching as Sebastian drove off with a stormy expression. Only then did he enter.

Alexander moved toward Evelyn's unit effortlessly. He still remembered when she had invited him in before—back when she had returned to his life as Vivian Prescott.

That was when he realized she wasn’t actually living with Sebastian.

Now, he approached her door slowly, standing there in silence.

The wind howled outside, snowflakes drifting in through the hallway window. The cold bit into his skin like needles, but Alexander barely noticed.

It was nothing compared to the pain he had once inflicted on Evelyn.

He leaned against the wall, knees bending as he sank onto a stool by her door.

Evelyn was a light sleeper. A muffled thud near her door pulled her from sleep—something between a knock and a stumble.

Curious, she slipped on a coat and stepped out.

Peering through the peephole, she saw nothing. Yet the faint noise persisted.

After a brief hesitation, she opened the door.

To her shock, Alexander was slumped against the wall beside it, head bowed. His thick lashes cast shadows under the dim hallway light.

Gone was his usual icy elegance. Instead, he looked vulnerable—like a lost child, sleeping soundly.

Evelyn studied him in silence before turning away.

"Love..."

The whisper stopped her cold.

She glanced back at the sleeping man.

"Really love..."

A bitter scoff escaped her.

"Alexander, are you seriously performing for me now?"

The sound of her voice—the one he ached for day and night—jolted him awake.

His hazy eyes lifted, landing on her. Slowly, he pushed himself up, the initial shock fading.

Evelyn finally noticed the unnatural flush on his face. The heavy scent of wine clung to him. He was clearly drunk.

"Evelyn," he murmured, voice soft. His dazed gaze burned with an intensity she'd never seen before.

She met his stare coldly. "Stop coming here. I don’t want to see you. And don’t call me Evelyn. Your foolish, naive ex-wife is dead."

Her glare was sharper than the winter wind. She reached for the door.

Alexander's hand shot out, stopping it. "Vivian." His voice was rough, wine-darkened eyes pleading. "Don’t push me away. I need to tell you something."
###Chapter 469

The man's voice was quiet yet firm. There was an undeniable plea in his tone. His eyes were clouded, a strange mix of sobriety and intoxication swirling in their depths.

Evelyn regarded him with icy detachment. "I have no interest in anything you have to say. The sight of you disgusts me."

Her words were a blade, sharp and precise, slicing through whatever fragile hope he might have been clinging to. The resentment burning in her gaze left Alexander standing there, utterly paralyzed.

It felt as though his heart had been plunged into an endless void, the cold seeping through his veins until his entire body was numb.

He missed it—the way she used to look at him. Those sparkling eyes filled with adoration, warmth, and love.

Now, her gaze was colder than that of a stranger.

When Evelyn saw the dazed expression on Alexander's face, her resolve only hardened. "Alexander, if you don’t leave now, I’m calling security."

His body tensed at her words. Slowly, he lifted his heavy-lidded eyes. "I’ll go. But first, I need to tell you something."

A biting wind swept between them, sharp as the tension in the air.

Evelyn studied Alexander’s flushed face, then released her grip on the doorknob. Without another word, she turned and walked inside.

The small concession made something flicker in Alexander’s darkened eyes. A faint, desperate smile tugged at his lips as he followed her in, shutting the door behind him.

The warmth of the apartment melted the frost clinging to his coat, but it was her reluctant tolerance that truly thawed the chill inside him.

"Say what you need to say. Don’t waste my time," Evelyn snapped, her voice like ice.

Alexander drank in the sight of her—her rigid posture, the frost in her expression—yet his gaze burned with something far from sober. "Stay away from Sebastian. And don’t marry him. He’s not who you think he is."

Evelyn let out a sharp laugh, her lips curling in derision. "Alexander, who do you think you are to dictate my life? What are you to me?"

Her tone was mocking, her eyes filled with nothing but contempt.

"I don’t care what kind of man Sebastian is. All I know is that he genuinely cares for me. He respects me. He doesn’t humiliate me, hurt me, or strip me of my dignity the way you did. At least with him, I’m treated like a person."

Her words struck him like a physical blow. He stood there, lost, his expression twisting with remorse and pain.

"If that’s all you came to say, then you’re done. Get out. I never want to see you again."

When she turned to leave, Alexander moved before he could stop himself. In two strides, he caught her, his arms wrapping around her from behind.

"Don’t go."

His voice was rough, laced with fear—as if letting her walk away meant losing her forever.

Evelyn froze, his embrace trapping her in place. For a heartbeat, she didn’t move. Then, she stiffened. "Let me go, Alexander."

"No." His grip tightened. "I can’t. I won’t."

His breath was warm against her ear, his voice trembling. "I’m sorry, Evelyn. I was wrong. From the very beginning, I was wrong."

The apologies spilled from him, raw and desperate.

Evelyn listened, unmoved. There was only bitter amusement in her eyes.

"Give me another chance," he whispered. "Please."

His lips brushed against her skin, the faint scent of alcohol lingering between them. The contact sent an electric jolt through her—but it couldn’t reach the shattered pieces of her heart.

Alexander held her like a drowning man clinging to driftwood. Even if she never answered, even if she never forgave him—this moment, this touch, was enough. For now, it had to be.
###Chapter 470

The silence was deafening. Alexander could hear Evelyn's soft, mocking laughter cutting through it like a knife.

"Alexander, it's too late. Nothing you say now will ever make me feel anything for you again," Evelyn's voice was ice-cold, devoid of the warmth that once colored her words when she spoke to him.

"Because I don't love you anymore."

Even though he already knew this truth, hearing it from her lips felt like being pierced by a thousand arrows. The pain was excruciating, unbearable.

It was as if invisible blades were shredding his flesh, leaving nothing but his hollow bones behind.

Evelyn suddenly raised her hand and pushed Alexander's limp arms away.

She turned to face him, her gaze filled with bitter sarcasm as she took in his devastated expression.

"Alexander, we're finished. The moment you had someone desecrate my grandfather's grave, I regretted ever loving someone as heartless and cruel as you."

His entire body went cold at her words. His heart plummeted into an abyss of despair.

Evelyn chuckled again when she saw the stunned look on Alexander's face. But in an instant, her expression hardened, her eyes turning to steel.

"When I loved you most, you did everything possible to hurt and humiliate me. You forced me to sign those divorce papers as I lay dying, all for that witch Victoria."

"Do you know that even after you made me sign them, I still hoped you'd turn back to look at me just once? Just one glance! But you didn't. I watched you walk away without a care in the world, taking with you the last shred of light in my life. All I could do was lie there, enduring unbearable pain, waiting for my vision to fade and my life to end."

"So don't tell me you're sorry. Don't say you were wrong. Alexander Blackwood, you weren't wrong! I was the one who was wrong - wrong to ever love someone like you!"

Tears burned behind Alexander's eyes as Evelyn's words struck him like physical blows.

He wept silently, his red-rimmed eyes meeting Evelyn's hate-filled gaze. In that moment, he'd never felt more worthless.

He had hurt her so deeply, yet here he was, foolishly seeking forgiveness with empty apologies.

Alexander couldn't bear to hold her gaze any longer. He wasn't worthy to even look at her.

"I understand." His voice was barely a whisper as he lowered his head, looking utterly broken. "I'll stay out of your life." He turned slowly to leave, but paused after a few steps.

"Is Amelia... our daughter?"

Evelyn pressed her lips into a thin line. "No. Amelia has no connection to you. She could never have such a heartless father."

The last flicker of hope in Alexander's eyes died at her definitive answer.

Now he truly understood the depth of pain Evelyn had endured. His heart sank like a stone, drowning in regret and anguish.

Alexander left the apartment, his tall frame looking more like a ghost than a man.

After the door closed behind him, Evelyn stared at where he'd stood. She took a shuddering breath and closed her eyes. When she opened them again, they were red-rimmed.

'Alexander, I was fatally drawn to you once. That love burned away everything innocent in me. But I won't make that mistake again.'

Evelyn retreated to her bedroom, tossing and turning for hours before sleep finally claimed her.

She woke before dawn, restless. On impulse, she decided to go for an early morning run.

But when she opened her apartment door, she froze in shock.

There, curled on the icy floor outside her door, lay Alexander.
###Chapter 471

Perhaps it was the shock of seeing him there, but Evelyn's pulse stuttered unexpectedly.

Her first instinct was to walk past the man collapsed on her doorstep. Yet when she caught sight of Alexander's furrowed brows and pained expression, her hands moved before her mind could stop them, checking his temperature.

His cheek felt like ice, but his forehead burned like fire.

As she leaned closer, the sharp tang of alcohol mixed with his distinctive cologne assaulted her senses.

He'd clearly been drinking heavily before passing out in the freezing night air. No wonder he was burning up now.

Evelyn considered calling an ambulance to deal with him - the perfect solution to avoid involvement. But as she turned to reach for her phone, Alexander's fingers closed around her wrist.

His touch was glacial, the cold seeping straight to her bones.

"Stay..." he murmured, lashes fluttering as if caught in a dream. His hooded eyes cracked open. "Please stay."

Then he was unconscious again.

Evelyn tugged at her trapped hand irritably. "Alexander, let go."

"Never again..." he mumbled incoherently, his grip tightening despite his unconscious state.

With an exasperated sigh, she relented. "Fine. I'm not leaving. Now will you loosen your death grip?"

At her voice, Alexander's eyes opened slightly. In his feverish haze, Evelyn's beautiful face swam before him.

Grudgingly, she helped the half-conscious man inside. At 5'6", dragging a 6'2" man was no easy feat. She barely managed to dump him onto the guest bed.

When she turned to fetch medicine, his hand shot out again.

"You promised," he accused weakly, his usually commanding voice now childishly petulant.

Evelyn shook him off impatiently. "Unlike you, I keep my promises. I said I'd stay, so I will."

She glared at him before retrieving fever reducers and warm water.

By the time she returned, Alexander had fallen into a deep sleep, oblivious to her efforts. The thermometer confirmed her suspicions - definitely a fever.

With no other options, she began cooling him with alcohol wipes. But as she worked, staring at his peaceful face, she suddenly clenched her fists and stood abruptly.

'What the hell are you doing, Evelyn Sinclair?'

'Why are you helping him?'

'Even if his temperature hits 105°, it's not your problem.'

'Did he care when you were in agony? When you begged for help? He turned his back on you without hesitation.'

With one last icy glance at the sleeping man, she walked away.

Hours later, Alexander awoke disoriented from strangely pleasant dreams. In them, Evelyn had tended to him with gentle hands.

Blinking at his surroundings, he realized it hadn't been a dream after all.

His bitter heart warmed at the sight of medication and water waiting on the nightstand. Though the water had gone cold, it tasted sweeter than any vintage wine as he swallowed the pills.

Meanwhile at Blackwood Enterprises...

Evelyn sat beside Sebastian Whitman, preparing for the press conference that would announce the seismic shift in company ownership - news already trending across financial networks.
###Chapter 472

The whispers about Alexander's financial ruin and disgrace grew louder by the hour.

Half of Willowbrook seemed glued to their screens, waiting for Alexander's response. Yet his Twitter remained eerily silent.

Sebastian kept checking his phone too, anticipating his nephew's next move. But twenty-four hours passed without a single sign of Alexander.

It was as if the man had vanished off the face of the earth. His phone went straight to voicemail every time.

Evelyn knew better. She'd left Alexander unconscious in her penthouse. Had he not woken up yet?

Today's explosive press conference should have provoked some reaction. Unless... his condition had worsened.

Evelyn pondered this silently as Sebastian led her into Willowbrook's most exclusive restaurant. To celebrate, he uncorked a vintage Bordeaux worth more than most people's monthly rent.

"To your victory. Blackwood Enterprises is finally yours." Evelyn raised her crystal flute, the bubbles catching the chandelier light.

Sebastian's smile reached his whiskey-colored eyes. "Before meeting you, revenge consumed me. Now?" He produced a velvet box, revealing a solitaire that could blind someone across the room. "You're the only dream I care about fulfilling."

The diamond's brilliance suddenly transported Evelyn back to her wedding day with Alexander.

Even through his usual icy demeanor, she remembered how his fingers had trembled slightly sliding that ring onto her finger.

"Vivian," Sebastian murmured, pulling her back to the present. "Let me cherish you forever. Marry me?"

Logically, Evelyn knew she shouldn't refuse. Sebastian was everything a woman could want - devoted, powerful, tender.

But she'd poured every ounce of passion into loving Alexander. Could her heart even recognize love anymore?

Then again, perhaps a marriage built on mutual care rather than burning passion would be... peaceful.

Evelyn extended her left hand just as a high-pitched voice shattered the moment.

"Mommy!"

Her head snapped up to see Ethan barreling toward them. She stood so abruptly her chair nearly toppled over. "Ethan?"

Sebastian's grip tightened around the ring box, his jaw clenching almost imperceptibly.

"Jack, how did you find me?" Evelyn knelt, gathering the boy into her arms. He smelled like sunshine and the faintest trace of Alexander's cologne.

Ethan nuzzled her neck with a giggle. "I followed the sparkles from Uncle Sebastian's ring!"

Her phone chose that moment to ring. Eleanor Kingsley's name flashed on the screen.

Evelyn answered tersely. "He's with me."

"Evelyn, wait—" Eleanor's voice cracked. "I... I miss you too."

The dial tone cut off Eleanor's sobs as Evelyn ended the call without another word.

Their romantic dinner ruined, Sebastian had no choice but to watch Evelyn leave with Ethan clinging to her hand.

"Mommy, guess what tomorrow is?" Ethan chirped as they approached her penthouse door.

Evelyn froze, her key hovering near the lock.

Tomorrow. The anniversary of the day everything burned to ashes.
###Chapter 473

Six years.

It had been six long years since that fateful day.

Evelyn pressed her finger against the biometric lock, the door clicking open with a soft beep. As she stepped inside, her mind drifted back—back to the prison cell, the cold concrete walls, the torment she endured.

She could still hear the rain pounding against the bars that stormy night. The hands that forced her down. The pain that never truly faded.

And tomorrow—tomorrow was her child’s birthday.

But this year was different. This year, she wouldn’t kneel before an empty grave.

Because she knew.

Her child was alive.

"Mommy, tomorrow’s my birthday!" Ethan’s voice, bright and clear, snapped her back to the present.

Her breath hitched. The ache in her chest flared, sharp and relentless.

Ethan—Victoria and Alexander’s son. The cruel irony that he shared the same birthday as her own lost child.

"Mommy, you’ll celebrate with me, right?" Tiny fingers tugged at the hem of her coat.

Evelyn looked down into those wide, hopeful eyes—so innocent, so trusting. She forced a smile, brushing a hand through his soft curls.

"Of course I will."

Ethan’s face lit up. He thrust out his pinky, grinning. "Pinky promise?"

She hooked her finger around his, sealing the vow. His delighted laughter filled the apartment, and for a moment, the weight on her shoulders eased.

Shrugging off her coat, she moved toward the kitchen, then paused.

The guest room.

She had expected it to be empty.

Instead, she found Alexander sprawled across the bed, exactly as he had been that morning.

Has he been here all day?

Even with a fever, he shouldn’t have slept this long.

Frowning, she approached, her gaze sweeping over his still form. She reached out, pressing the back of her hand to his forehead.

Cool. No fever. His color had returned.

Satisfied, she started to pull away—

A hand clamped around her wrist.

Her pulse jumped.

Alexander’s eyes were open now, dark and knowing, a faint smirk playing on his lips. She yanked her arm free, glaring.

"Were you pretending this whole time?"

He didn’t answer. Instead, he pushed himself up, his voice low, teasing. "You still care."

"Care?" She scoffed, ice dripping from her words. "I just didn’t want you rotting in my apartment."

His smirk faltered. In her cold stare, he saw the reflection of his own past cruelty.

"Leave. I don’t want you here."

She turned on her heel, storming out before he could respond.

Alexander watched her go, his chest tight. He had heard her come in, had feigned sleep just to see how she would react.

And despite the venom in her words, she had checked on him.

That was enough.

For now.

Stepping into the hallway, he caught sight of Ethan, then Evelyn in the kitchen, her back rigid as she worked.

A thought struck him.

Does she know?

Does Evelyn know Ethan is hers?
###Chapter 474

"Papa," Ethan called out to him at that moment.

Alexander turned in surprise. The handsome little boy approached him with a bright smile, his crystal-clear eyes mirroring Evelyn's more than ever.

Truth be told, during the three years of Evelyn's supposed "death," he rarely heard Ethan address him as "Papa." And when he did, it was always hollow and obligatory—nothing like the warmth in his voice now.

"Papa, you're here too? Will you celebrate my birthday with Mama tomorrow?"

Birthday.

Alexander suddenly remembered—tomorrow was Ethan's fifth birthday. Yet in all these years, he'd never once celebrated it with his son.

"Ethan, your father has to leave now. You can tell him whatever you want next time," Evelyn interjected with a practiced smile, her words clearly meant to dismiss Alexander.

She turned icy eyes toward the man. "You should go now."

Alexander's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "I'm leaving, but about Ethan's birthday tomorrow—"

"Birthday?" Evelyn cut him off with a mocking laugh, her gaze sharpening. "How touching, Mr. Blackwood. You treated Victoria's son like royalty while discarding mine like trash. You had someone force an abortion on me in prison, stole my child, and let her grow up as a bastard you threw away!"

Her voice cracked. "For years I clung to that fake photo Victoria gave me—the one she claimed was my baby. Do you remember finding me sobbing over a landscape postcard? That was my child's supposed picture!"

Alexander's heart wrenched. He remembered that day vividly—Evelyn kneeling on the pavement, desperately clutching that postcard. Now he understood the cruel truth behind her anguish.

"Alexander," Evelyn's voice trembled with rage, "tell me—what sin did I commit to deserve this? I will never forgive you. Not in this lifetime. Get out. Now!"

Alexander's throat worked silently. He searched Evelyn's furious eyes, words failing him. "Evelyn—"

"Leave!"

"Alright. I'm going." Without further protest, Alexander turned away, his broad shoulders carrying an unfamiliar weight of loneliness.

Evelyn drew a shuddering breath, forcing composure. At least her child was alive—that was her only solace.

The next morning after dropping Ethan at kindergarten, Evelyn headed to Diamond Boulevard to buy birthday gifts—one for Ethan, and another for the daughter she'd never held.

'My darling, I pray I find you soon. I want to hold you, to celebrate every birthday we've missed.'

As she exited the boutique, a familiar figure caught her eye—Margaret Dawson.

After testifying against Victoria, Margaret and Richard had vanished. Evelyn never expected to see her here.

While Victoria would never reveal her child's whereabouts, Margaret might.

Margaret had just pawned her jewelry. Spotting Evelyn, she paled and bolted like a criminal.

"Margaret!" Evelyn gave chase without hesitation. When Margaret recklessly dashed across the intersection against the light, Evelyn followed—her daughter's face the only thing in her mind.

If Margaret escaped now, she'd lose this crucial lead.

The walk signal flashed green. A speeding white sedan ran the red light, tires screeching as it barreled toward Evelyn.

Through the chaos, one voice pierced the air—"Evelyn!"—followed by a sickening crash.
###Chapter 475

The crowd began to gather, drawn by the commotion.

The car came speeding toward her, and for a terrifying moment, Evelyn thought she wouldn’t escape in time.

Then, in a blur of motion, strong arms yanked her back.

A surge of safety—something she hadn’t felt in years—flooded through her.

Before she could even process what had happened, firm hands gripped her shoulders.

"Evelyn, are you hurt?"

The voice was familiar, laced with concern.

Evelyn blinked, realizing it was Eleanor who had pulled her to safety.

Eleanor’s elegant face was tight with worry, her eyes scanning Evelyn’s body for injuries.

For a few seconds, Evelyn just stared, stunned. Then she managed, "I’m fine. Thank you, Mrs. Kingsley."

At the formal address, Eleanor’s eyes reddened. But she said nothing.

She had lost the right to be called "Mother" long ago.

Evelyn turned toward the car that had nearly hit her. It had crashed into a nearby tree, the front crumpled. The driver stood unharmed, already on the phone arranging a tow.

"That was too close! I almost hit that woman!"

"Thank God that elegant lady saved her. They must be mother and daughter—look how alike they are."

"A mother’s instinct is to protect her child, no matter what. See how she’s crying?"

Evelyn had been about to walk away, but the murmurs of the crowd made her pause.

She glanced back.

Eleanor stood there, tears streaming silently down her face, her emotions barely contained.

Then Evelyn noticed it—the deep gash on Eleanor’s right calf, blood trickling down her leg.

She strode back, frowning. "You’re hurt. Why didn’t you say anything?"

Eleanor shook her head, still crying. "As long as you’re safe."

Evelyn exhaled sharply. "Did you come alone?"

Eleanor met her gaze and nodded.

"Wait here," Evelyn said. "I’ll bring the car."

She walked off quickly, leaving Eleanor standing there, overwhelmed.

A few minutes later, Evelyn pulled up in front of her.

She got out, opened the passenger door, and helped Eleanor inside before driving straight to the hospital.

The entire ride, Eleanor barely glanced at her wound. Her eyes stayed fixed on Evelyn’s profile—her daughter’s face, so much like her own.

She wanted to speak, but she didn’t dare.

At the hospital, Evelyn handled everything—registering, guiding Eleanor to the doctor, waiting as her wound was treated.

When it was done, she helped Eleanor to the entrance before letting go.

"Call him to pick you up. I have things to do."

Eleanor knew she meant William. Her heart ached, but she forced a smile. "I don’t want to bother him. I’ll manage."

Evelyn hesitated. Then, flatly, "Fine. I’m leaving."

"Evelyn—"

But Evelyn was already walking away.

Eleanor wiped her tears, limping toward the exit alone.

From her car, Evelyn watched her go, fingers tightening around the steering wheel.

She didn’t know why it still hurt.

Alexander, Eleanor, William—they were the people she had loved most.

And they were the ones who had broken her the most.
###Chapter 476

She should have stopped caring about them years ago.

Yet when she saw Eleanor limping away, tears burned behind her eyelids.

After Alexander stormed out of Evelyn’s office, he barricaded himself in his suite at Blackwood Estate.

Yvonne and Margaret knocked relentlessly, but he never answered.

Day bled into night as he replayed his wedding footage with Evelyn on loop.

His grandfather had been right. He’d loved her since the beginning. Choosing her under Henry’s name proved it.

But Victoria had weaponized a childhood vow to manipulate him for six years.

She was never the one.

The girl he’d promised his future to was Evelyn.

Alexander slumped in his chair, then suddenly laughed—a raw, broken sound.

"The woman I loved then, now, always—it’s you, Lillian."

His phone buzzed violently.

"What? Evelyn almost crashed chasing Margaret?" His voice sharpened. "I’m on my way."

He tore through his closet for a fresh shirt.

Yvonne intercepted him with a dessert tray. "Alexander! Finally—where are you rushing off to?"

He brushed past her without a word.

Margaret blocked him at the grand staircase. "Going to Evelyn again? After she and Sebastian stole everything from us? Have you lost your mind?"

"My choices aren’t your concern," he said icily. "Interfere, and you’ll regret it."

She recoiled as he strode out.

Evelyn’s hands shook long after leaving Eleanor at the hospital. Distracted, she missed picking up Ethan.

Twilight painted the sky when Eleanor called.

This time, Evelyn answered immediately.

"Evelyn," Eleanor’s voice trembled. "I know you despise us. But come home tonight. Just once. Then I’ll never ask again."

"You saved me today," Evelyn said tightly. "Consider this debt paid."

Yet she knew the truth—she wanted to go.

Twenty minutes later, her car idled outside Montgomery Manor.

Alexander emerged from a black sedan, balancing a cake box.

Their eyes met. His gaze softened like spring sunlight.

He moved toward her—then froze when she smiled, all sharp edges and venom.

"How devoted. Even bankrupt, you remember your precious son’s birthday."

Alexander’s laugh was bitter. "If I were devoted, I wouldn’t have missed every one until now."

"Precious son." The words curdled on Evelyn’s tongue. Her chest ached.

"Victoria’s child gets everything. But mine?"

Her voice fractured. "Ten months of carrying her. Years of agony. And I never even held her. While you—you killed our baby to please Victoria."

Tears spilled over. Rage twisted her features.

"Alexander, I will never forgive you for that."

His response was a whisper.

"What if I brought her to you right now?"
###Chapter 477

The moment Alexander spoke those words, the atmosphere between them turned glacial.

Evelyn's furious gaze wavered with shock. "Alexander, what did you just say?"

His heart clenched painfully as he met her intense stare.

"Alexander, say it again! You knew our child was alive all along? Do you actually know where she is?" Evelyn's composure shattered completely. She gripped his shoulders desperately. "Tell me! Right now! Where is my baby?"

Alexander felt his soul tearing apart seeing the tears welling in Evelyn's bloodshot eyes.

"Eve, please calm down—"

"Calm down? How could you expect me to be calm?" Evelyn let out a bitter laugh, her glare sharp enough to pierce steel. "You never cared about our child, but I did! Do you have any idea what it's like to be torn from your own flesh and blood? Of course you don't—you're heartless! That witch Victoria is all that matters in your frozen, emotionless heart!"

"Daddy! Mommy!"

Just as Evelyn was about to demand answers, little Ethan came running from the house.

His beaming smile caught the moonlight, revealing an uncharacteristic mischievous glint in his eyes.

The sight of that cherubic face momentarily softened Evelyn's rage and pain.

She drew a shuddering breath, forcing composure before offering Ethan a tender, loving smile.

"Ethan, sweetheart."

Kneeling, she caught the boy as he barreled into her arms.

Tears threatened to spill as she felt his small, warm body pressed against hers.

She adored Ethan with every fiber of her being, wanting to shower him with all the maternal love she could give.

Yet in this moment, the ache for her own biological child burned fiercer than ever.

Alexander pressed his lips together, his gaze filled with aching tenderness as he watched them.

'Eve, Ethan is your son. Our son. When you learn the truth, your joy will know no bounds.'

"Happy birthday, darling." After releasing Ethan, Evelyn planted a kiss on his cheek before presenting the carefully chosen gift.

Ethan accepted it with an excited grin. "Thank you, Mommy!"

His childish voice flowed over Evelyn's heart like healing spring water.

Rising on tiptoes, Ethan reciprocated with a sloppy kiss on Evelyn's cheek.

She smiled through unshed tears, ruffling his hair before standing.

"Daddy, Mommy, come inside! Grandpa and Grandma made all my favorite foods!" The boy grabbed both their hands, tugging them toward the house with infectious enthusiasm.

Evelyn shot Alexander one last searing glare.

He responded with a gentle, knowing smile. "Don't worry. Our child is safe and loved."

"Loved? How can a child abandoned by her father and stolen from her mother possibly know love?" Evelyn scoffed. Yet as she followed Ethan, her hand instinctively tightened around his small one.

Watching them walk ahead hand-in-hand, Alexander's eyes shimmered with gratitude.

His smile turned bittersweet. Despite everything, he remained thankful that the people he loved most were still within reach.
###Chapter 478

Eleanor and William had been anxiously waiting, fearing Evelyn might not appear. When she walked into the grand living room of Blackwood Estate with Ethan, their eyes shimmered with relief.

"Evelyn! You came!" Eleanor rushed forward, her voice trembling with emotion.

Evelyn's gaze flickered to Eleanor's bandaged leg. The older woman still walked with a slight limp. "Mrs. Kingsley, you should sit. I wouldn’t want your injury to worsen on my account," she said coolly.

Eleanor’s smile faltered. "A mother would do anything for her child’s safety. Your well-being is all that matters. We owe you everything, Evelyn—not the other way around."

William nodded solemnly beside her, his eyes filled with remorse. "We’ve failed you in ways we can never make right. If you choose not to acknowledge us, we’ll respect that. Just seeing you here is enough."

Evelyn’s expression remained unreadable. "Isn’t this supposed to be Ethan’s birthday celebration?"

The older couple exchanged glances before nodding. "Yes, of course. But before we begin, Alexander has something for you," Eleanor said, gesturing toward the man approaching with a cake.

Evelyn’s brows furrowed. "If this is another attempt to reconcile us, I’m leaving."

"Evelyn, please!" Eleanor caught her arm. "We won’t mention it again if it upsets you."

As Evelyn turned to leave, Alexander’s fingers closed around her wrist. His touch sent warmth spiraling through her veins.

She met his gaze, irritation flashing in her eyes. "Let go."

"Ethan wants you here. As for my gift… you’ll accept it when you’re ready."

"Daddy, what gift?" Ethan piped up, tilting his head curiously.

Evelyn pulled her hand free and forced a smile for the boy. "It’s your special day, sweetheart. Of course there’s a gift for you." She scooped him into her arms and carried him toward the dining room.

Eleanor sighed as she watched them go. "If only she knew the truth—that Ethan is her son. She’d be overjoyed."

Alexander’s lips twisted bitterly. "After everything I’ve done, her hatred is justified. I don’t deserve her forgiveness."

Ethan’s sixth birthday was meant to be extravagant, yet it unfolded with quiet simplicity.

Alexander lit a single candle shaped like the number six. Ethan squeezed his eyes shut, made a wish, and blew it out with a giggle. When he cut the cake, his small hands carefully offered the first slice to Evelyn.

"Thank you, Mommy," he said solemnly.

Evelyn blinked. "For what?"

"This is the best birthday ever."

The room fell silent.

"My real mommy doesn’t like me," Ethan confessed, his voice small. "She only smiles when Daddy’s watching. When he’s gone, she locks me in the dark and yells. But you’re different. You always protect me."

His hopeful eyes met hers.

"Will you be my mommy forever? Will you keep me safe?"
###Chapter 479

Alexander's brows knitted tightly together as he processed Ethan's words.

His stormy gray eyes reflected a turbulent mix of sorrow and barely restrained fury.

The revelation struck him like a physical blow—how could Victoria have done such monstrous things to their child when he wasn't looking?

No wonder Ethan had been so withdrawn. The pieces finally clicked into place.

Alexander's hands clenched into fists, knuckles turning white with tension.

"That woman is pure evil!" Eleanor spat, her voice trembling with outrage. William placed a steadying hand on her shoulder, his expression equally grim.

Evelyn's heart ached for the little boy. A cold fire ignited in her chest as she turned her gaze toward Alexander.

"Mr. Blackwood, your beloved Victoria is truly exceptional," she said icily. "But do you really think that's the worst of it?"

Her lips curled into a bitter smile as she recounted the past.

"She carved open Ethan's face with a fruit knife to frame me. I'll never forget how she pressed the blade into my hand while he screamed, smiling like it was all some twisted game."

The room fell deathly silent.

Eleanor and William looked stricken. Even though they hadn't witnessed the event, they'd condemned Evelyn just as harshly afterward.

Evelyn's eyes flicked to Alexander's ashen face before softening as she turned back to Ethan. "I promise you, Ethan. No one will ever hurt you again."

"Really?" The boy's eyes shone with tentative hope.

Evelyn extended her pinky. "Pinky promise."

Ethan's answering grin—complete with adorable dimples—was the first truly childlike expression Evelyn had seen from him. Her own lips curved in response before she could stop them.

After the birthday celebration ended, Evelyn prepared to leave.

Eleanor and William hovered awkwardly, countless unspoken apologies lodged in their throats.

Alexander expected Evelyn to storm out without a backward glance. Instead, he found her waiting by the door, arms crossed.

"Alexander. Where is my daughter?" Her voice was steel wrapped in velvet. "Don't think this changes anything between us."

He approached slowly, guilt weighing down each step. "You're right to worry. She's... not well."

Evelyn's breath hitched. "What do you mean? Is she sick? Alexander, tell me—"

"I'm sorry."

Without warning, he pulled her into a crushing embrace. The scent of her perfume—something floral with a hint of spice—flooded his senses.

He'd been so arrogant, so certain Ethan was thriving under his care. All while Victoria systematically destroyed their son behind closed doors.

And now history was repeating itself with Amelia.

Evelyn shoved him away, panic sharpening her features. "Alexander! Where is she?"

His hands tightened on her shoulders. "Tomorrow. I'll take you to her tomorrow."

A spark of hope lit Evelyn's amber eyes. "You swear?"
###Chapter 480

"Truly." Alexander nodded, his piercing gaze unwavering. "Have faith in me."

His baritone voice carried a rare tenderness. Evelyn found herself momentarily disarmed, staring into those stormy gray eyes. After a heartbeat, she regained her composure and pushed his hands away with deliberate coldness.

"Mark your words, Alexander. Don't make me despise you further." She spun on her heel, her midnight blue dress swirling as she walked away.

Alexander watched Evelyn's retreating figure, a sharp pang gripping his chest. Memories flooded him - the way she used to look at him with adoration, her laughter like wind chimes in spring. All gone now, replaced by this icy distance.

That night, sleep eluded Evelyn.

Her thoughts raced with images of the child stolen from her at birth. What would her daughter look like? She must be beautiful, with Alexander's striking features and her own delicate bone structure.

Yet one question tormented her - how long had Alexander known their child survived? That cemetery scene... his cruelty had seemed so genuine. Was it all an act?

Dawn found Evelyn still tossing restlessly.

The shrill ringtone jolted her awake. Sebastian's sleep-roughened voice invited her to accompany him to Blackwood Enterprises for a board meeting.

After agreeing, she tried calling Alexander. When he didn't answer, she sent a terse message: "Don't forget your promise about our child."

Arriving at Blackwood Enterprises, Evelyn froze at the media circus outside. Reporters swarmed like vultures, their cameras flashing.

Then she saw him.

Alexander stood head and shoulders above the crowd, his tailored black suit accentuating his powerful frame. Even amidst chaos, he exuded effortless command, his chiseled features impassive.

Evelyn edged closer, catching his calm declaration: "Blackwood Enterprises remains under family control, merely temporarily managed by my uncle Sebastian. The Blackwood legacy endures."

He spoke with such conviction, as if losing his empire meant nothing. A wry smile touched his lips. "As for those rumors about my downfall? Wise men know truth from fiction."

The reporters pressed harder. "Mr. Blackwood, Victoria Lancaster faces murder charges. As her longtime lover, will you provide legal counsel?"

Another shouted, "You haven't visited Victoria since her arrest, despite her bearing your son. Many call this heartless. Your response?"

Alexander's expression darkened. "Victoria committed crimes and must face justice. Our past entanglement meant nothing - I never loved her." Then his gaze found Evelyn in the crowd, softening instantly. "There's only ever been one woman in my heart - my wife, Evelyn Sinclair. Though her true name is Eveline Montgomery."
###Chapter 481

The moment Alexander finished speaking, the entire crowd gasped in shock.

During the Blackwood Enterprises press conference years ago, they had learned that Evelyn was the true Montgomery heiress. That revelation had stunned them, but Alexander's current statement left them utterly speechless.

Everyone knew the heir to Willowbrook's wealthiest family had been infatuated with Victoria Lancaster. So why was he suddenly declaring his love for Evelyn Sinclair?

Evelyn was supposed to be the woman he despised most.

"Mr. Blackwood, are you saying you've always loved your ex-wife Evelyn Sinclair, not Victoria Lancaster?" A bold journalist broke the tense silence.

"Only half correct," Alexander replied, his gaze softening as it landed on Evelyn. "I don't have an ex-wife. I've only ever had one wife."

The reporters exchanged confused glances. "But Mr. Blackwood, you divorced Evelyn Sinclair three years ago—"

"We faced challenges in our marriage, but I can assure you she remains my lawfully wedded wife to this day."

The journalists fell into stunned silence, their pens hovering uncertainly over notepads.

Evelyn maintained her composure, though her heartbeat quickened at his words.

What had he just said?

That she was still his legal wife?

He'd been the one who forced her to sign those divorce papers. How could their marriage still be valid?

After a prolonged silence, the same journalist ventured carefully, "Mr. Blackwood, even if that's true, we must remind you that Evelyn Sinclair reportedly passed away three years ago. Surely—"

"You're mistaken." Alexander cut him off firmly. "My wife is very much alive."

What?

The crowd erupted in murmurs as Alexander began moving through the parting sea of reporters.

All eyes followed his path to where Evelyn stood in the distance.

Her statuesque figure and striking features were unmistakable—this was the Evelyn Sinclair they remembered.

Yet she carried herself differently now. Gone was the simple girl from years past. In her place stood a woman radiating confidence and regal bearing.

The journalists recognized that face immediately. Wasn't this Vivian Prescott, founder and lead designer of Lady Belle?

Was Vivian Prescott actually Evelyn Sinclair?

The realization struck the crowd simultaneously.

Before Evelyn could react, Alexander was before her, his voice tender as spring rain. "Evelyn, I was wrong. I hurt you deeply and made you suffer. I know forgiveness won't come easily, but please give me another chance to love you properly."

The journalists surged forward with their questions:
"Miss Prescott, are you truly Evelyn Sinclair?"
"Reports claimed you succumbed to a terminal illness. How did you survive?"
"Victoria Lancaster stole your identity and inheritance. What's your response?"
"If you never divorced Mr. Blackwood, will you reconcile with him?"

The barrage of questions overwhelmed Evelyn's senses.

Under the weight of countless expectant stares, she met Alexander's hopeful gaze with unwavering calm.
###Chapter 482

"Your words moved me deeply, Mr. Blackwood. But unfortunately, I'm not Evelyn Sinclair."

She denied it coldly, then let out a mocking laugh. "Even if I were Evelyn, I would never forgive you or give you another chance."

The light in Alexander's eyes extinguished instantly. His heart sank like a stone.

This answer shouldn't have surprised him. Yet hearing her denial felt like a dagger twisting in his chest.

Sebastian rushed to the scene as soon as he saw the live broadcast.

He pushed through the crowd, his usually refined face contorted with anger as he reached Vivian's side. In front of everyone, he grasped her hand possessively, his gaze challenging Alexander.

"Alexander, stop forcing your hypocritical apologies and fake love on Vivian. She's not your ex-wife Evelyn Sinclair whom you abandoned and humiliated. She's my fiancée, Vivian Prescott."

Sebastian's voice carried a clear warning.

This was the first time Vivian had seen such raw fury from the normally composed Sebastian.

"Out of respect for our relationship, I'll let this slide once. Have some dignity."

With that, Sebastian tried to lead Vivian away.

She didn't look back at Alexander as they turned to leave. But the moment they took their first steps, another familiar hand caught hers.

Vivian froze, forcing Sebastian to stop. His expression darkened when he saw Alexander holding Vivian's other hand.

"Release her. Now."

Ignoring Sebastian, Alexander stepped closer to Vivian.

Leaning down, he whispered something in her ear that made her eyes widen instantly.

Then loud enough for everyone to hear, he uttered four loaded words: "I'll wait for you."

Before anyone could react, Vivian suddenly released Sebastian's hand.

"Vivian?" Sebastian's face fell.

Her eyes brimmed with apology and urgency. "I'm sorry, Sebastian. I have to go. It's important. I'll explain later."

She was gone before he could stop her, clearly following Alexander's path.

The crowd murmured, suspicions growing about whether Vivian Prescott was truly the abandoned Evelyn Sinclair.

From his car's rearview mirror, Alexander watched Vivian approach.

A bittersweet feeling washed over him. Pathetic, that this was the only way to get her attention now.

He'd brought this upon himself.

Before he could dwell further, Vivian yanked open the passenger door and slid in.

"No more games, Alexander. Take me to my child now." Her demand cut through the air.

Alexander studied her striking profile with a faint smile. "I promised to bring our child to you today, and I will."

Vivian scoffed. "Over a decade ago, someone promised to protect and cherish me forever. How did that turn out?"

Her icy glare intensified. "Unless I see my child with my own eyes, your words mean nothing to me."

"Very well," Alexander conceded, starting the engine. "Let's go meet our child."
###Chapter 483

Alexander turned the ignition key without hesitation.

Evelyn's frosty expression melted into hopeful anticipation at his words.

Property? N?velDrama.Org.

Through the rearview mirror, Alexander noticed Evelyn's white-knuckled grip. Her eyes shimmered with turbulent emotions - longing, fear, and nervous excitement.

A satisfied smirk curled his lips when he caught her genuine smile in the reflection. Finally, after all this time, he saw light return to her face.

But as they navigated through bustling city streets, the scenery grew disturbingly familiar. Evelyn's brows knitted together as she recognized their destination.

'Has my child been living in Pinecrest Heights all along?'

'Who's been caring for my baby?'

The car rolled to a stop before she could voice these questions.

Evelyn didn't wait for Alexander's chivalrous gesture, throwing the door open herself.

The winter beach stretched before them, barren and windswept. Icy sea gusts cut through her coat like knives. No sane person visited Pinecrest Beach in December - even the hardiest locals avoided it.

She spun toward Alexander, eyes blazing. "Where's my child?" The wind snatched at her words. "Why bring me here? I want to see my baby now!"

"You'll hold our child before sunset," he promised.

"Sunset?" Evelyn seized on his phrasing. "Alexander Blackwood, are you playing games with me?"

His lips twisted in a helpless smile. "What choice do I have?"

"Explain. Now." She crossed her arms, patience evaporating.

His gaze softened. "You'll never forgive me. Never love me like before. So I steal what moments I can."

A bitter laugh escaped her. "How pathetic you've become."

"Utterly." His eyes drank in her mocking expression with unsettling tenderness. "Call me despicable. Shameless. I only want this day with you."

Evelyn studied his pleading eyes, then set her jaw. "If I don't see my child by nightfall, you'll regret this deception."

Alexander smiled at her fury.

'Oh Evelyn, if only you knew how I crave your attention - even your anger.'

The thought lingered as he watched her stalk toward the shore. Salty gusts carried fragments of their past - laughter buried beneath years of pain.

He followed, close enough to touch yet eternally out of reach.

An elderly woman struggling with an overflowing basket of sweet potatoes provided unexpected distraction. Several tubers tumbled down the dune.

Evelyn rushed to help. Alexander joined without hesitation.

"Bless you both," the woman panted, then did a double take. "My stars! You two again? Braving this cold to relive old memories?"

Recognition struck simultaneously. This was the retired physician from their youth.
###Chapter 484

Alexander walked beside her, his lips curving into a nostalgic smile. "Yes. My wife and I wanted to revisit where it all began."

Evelyn shot him a frosty glare, which he ignored as he bent to help the elderly woman gather her scattered potatoes, lifting the woven basket with ease.

"You live nearby, don’t you? Let me carry these for you."

"Bless you, dear." The woman accepted their assistance, her wrinkled face lighting up as she gestured down the cobbled path.

Without hesitation, Alexander laced his fingers through Evelyn’s, his grip unyielding when she tried to pull away.

"What a devoted pair you are, braving the chilly shore just to stroll together." The woman glanced back, her eyes twinkling at their joined hands. "You’re fortunate to have such a doting husband. I still remember how he sprinted to the clinic when you twisted your ankle years ago—arrived breathless, panic written all over his face. Even then, I knew you two were meant to be."

Evelyn’s lips twisted into a sardonic smile as she met Alexander’s gaze.

"Appearances deceive, ma’am."

"Nonsense! This old eyes sees true affection when it’s staring right at her," the woman chided playfully. "All couples quarrel—why, I bickered with my late Henry daily. But after he passed? The silence nearly broke me."

Her voice softened, weighted with wisdom. "Life’s shorter than you think, child. Hold tight to what matters."

"Wise words," Alexander interjected, squeezing Evelyn’s hand. "I intend to cherish every moment with my wife."

The woman beamed approvingly before leading them to her cottage.

Evelyn seized the chance to wrench free, murmuring farewell, but the woman clucked her tongue. "Stay for lunch! It’s rare I have company."

Alexander accepted before Evelyn could refuse.

As the woman bustled about her kitchen, her voice carried over the clatter of pans. "My children are always busy in the city. Today feels like a blessing."

Thirty minutes later, a humble spread of rustic dishes adorned the table.

Alexander piled Evelyn’s plate with care, savoring each bite as if it were gourmet—because with her beside him, even simplicity tasted divine.

Afterward, Evelyn helped clear the dishes before stepping into the winter sunlight, its golden warmth belying the chill in her demeanor.

She turned on the shoreline, fixing Alexander with an arctic stare.

He trailed her like a shadow, his gaze unwavering, sunlight gilding his sharp features.

"You have six hours left, Alexander. State your demands." Her tone was clinical, a transaction—nothing more.

His smile was a blade wrapped in velvet. "Anything you wish to do, darling. So long as I’m with you."

A brittle laugh escaped her. "Funny. Where was this devotion when I waited night after night, praying you’d walk through our door? Now you’re desperate for my company?" Her voice dropped to a whisper. "Pathetic."

Alexander flinched as if struck. "You’re right. It is pathetic. But what choice do I have?"

His fingers dug into his palms. "I can’t undo the past. Can’t go back to when you first smiled at me and tell you how much you meant to me."

The light in his eyes guttered out.

Suddenly, he seized her shoulders.

"I don’t expect forgiveness, Evelyn. I don’t deserve it. But if hatred is all you’ll give me?" His thumbs brushed her collarbones, desperate. "Then let me live in your hell. At least there, I still exist to you."
###Chapter 485

Evelyn let out a bitter, mocking laugh that cut through the salty sea air.

Her eyes glistened with unshed tears despite her defiant expression.

"Are you even listening to yourself, Alexander?" Her voice dripped with sarcasm as she blinked back the moisture in her eyes.

"You claim to have loved me since our reunion, yet you carved pieces of my flesh away?"

The word 'love' made her expression darken like storm clouds gathering.

"Is this your twisted definition of love, Alexander? Real love means wanting the best for someone! Not breaking them, destroying them, torturing them!"

The dam broke as tears streamed down her cheeks, carried away by the ocean breeze.

They landed on Alexander's knuckles, each drop burning like acid against his skin.

"Stop lying to yourself - and stop lying to me. We both know you've always loved Victoria. I saw how you protected her despite every horrible thing she did. And me? When I was slandered and humiliated? You left me on Maplewood Avenue in the pouring rain. You left me to die!"

Alexander's breath hitched as if she'd physically struck him.

He reached for her, arms encircling her trembling form. "Please... don't," he begged hoarsely.

Evelyn fought against his embrace, her fists pounding uselessly against his chest. "Let me go! If you had the courage to hurt me, have the courage to hear the truth!"

Her voice cracked. "You crushed me over and over when I loved you with everything I had! Even on the day of my 'death,' you were happily getting engaged to Victoria! Do you know how it feels to have your heart ripped apart? Death would have been kinder!"

Alexander's arms tightened like steel bands around her as each accusation struck deeper than the last.

Every word was a knife twisting in his chest, reopening wounds that never fully healed.

The memory of her bloody, lifeless body in his arms haunted him still.

Silent tears tracked down his face as he swallowed against the lump in his throat.

Words failed him - what could possibly make this right? He only held tighter, terrified she'd vanish again.

Evelyn drew a shuddering breath, trying to calm the storm inside, but the tears kept coming.

The pain of reliving those memories was too much.

Too exhausted to keep fighting, she settled for a derisive scoff.

"That first meeting at Pinecrest Heights... I was so happy. You were my friend, the first boy I ever imagined spending forever with. But my love for you is as dead as that rainbow shell I gave you. Gone. Forever."

Alexander's grip loosened just enough to reach into his pocket.

When he opened his palm, Evelyn froze.

It was the very shell she'd thrown away on Diamond Boulevard.

He'd retrieved it?

"I kept your gift," Alexander whispered, eyes red-rimmed but alight with hope. "Doesn't that mean we still have a chance, Evelyn?"

She reached for the shell mechanically.

Seeing the desperate hope in his gaze, something inside her snapped. She drew back her arm to hurl it into the waves.

"Evelyn, don't!" Alexander caught her waist, lifting her off her feet as his other hand grabbed for hers.

"Let me go! There's nothing left between us!" She thrashed wildly. "And I'll never believe your lies about loving me! Never! Not even if I die!"

Alexander pulled her closer. "I mean it, Evelyn. I love you. I always have."

"No! Release me, Alexan— Mmph!"

His lips crashed against hers, cutting off her protests.

His familiar scent overwhelmed her - masculine and possessive, drowning out her own floral perfume. The kiss was desperate, hungry, as if he could rewrite their past through sheer force of will.
###Chapter 486

Evelyn parted her lips only to sink her teeth harshly into Alexander's lower lip.

The man's striking eyes flew open, his brows knitting together in momentary pain.

Amusement flickered in his gaze as he misinterpreted Evelyn's violent rejection as passion.

His grip slackened, giving her the perfect opportunity to deliver a stinging slap across his face.

Evelyn glared at him, her fists clenching at the sight of blood blooming on Alexander's perfect lips.

"Don't you dare kiss me with the same mouth that's touched another woman!" she spat, disgust lacing every syllable. "It's revolting!"

She whirled around, her entire body trembling with fury.

Alexander lifted a long finger to dab at the crimson droplet at the corner of his mouth. "You're the only woman I've ever kissed."

Evelyn's steps faltered.

Alexander turned to study her rigid back. "I know you won't believe me, but it's the truth. There's never been another."

Slowly, Evelyn turned, her eyes blazing. "Oh really? So you're telling me you never touched Victoria either? Then how exactly did Ethan come into existence? Spontaneous combustion?"

"..." Alexander fell silent.

Evelyn's mocking laughter cut through the chilly air. "What's the matter? Forgotten all those times she claimed to be pregnant? Or how she supposedly miscarried because of me - the villain in your little fairytale?"

Her voice turned venomous. "You couldn't even bear to come home during our marriage. No, you spent every night with that scheming witch!"

"At least have the decency to own your actions, Alexander. Don't humiliate yourself further."

With that final blow, Evelyn stormed back to the car, slamming the door hard enough to make the windows rattle.

Alexander stood frozen as the ocean wind whipped around him, its icy fingers mirroring the chill in his heart.

He hadn't lied. Ever since discovering Ethan wasn't Victoria's biological child, he'd suspected their relationship had never been physical.

He was certain he'd never touched her while sober. The two times Victoria claimed pregnancy coincided with nights he'd blacked out from drinking.

Now it seemed obvious - Victoria must have orchestrated those drunken episodes, and her "pregnancies" were fabrications.

Which meant his body had remained faithful, even when his mind had been deceived.

Approaching the car, Alexander found Evelyn with her eyes closed, her head resting against the seat.

Perhaps she hoped sleep would make this nightmare of a day disappear.

Respecting her silent request, Alexander remained outside, standing guard as the damp wind seeped into his bones.

Evelyn drifted into an uneasy sleep, waking to find the sky painted in twilight hues.

Turning her head, she saw Alexander still standing sentinel beside the car, his silhouette as immobile as marble.

As if sensing her gaze, he turned abruptly.

Their eyes locked through the glass before Evelyn coldly looked away.

Alexander's lips curved at her reaction as he slid into the driver's seat. "Good evening."

"It's getting late, Alexander. Take me to my child. Now."

"Of course."

Evelyn eyed him suspiciously at his immediate agreement. "Don't play games with me."

"I'm serious." Meeting her gaze briefly, Alexander started the engine and accelerated onto the coastal road.

Thirty minutes later, the car pulled up to Blackwood Estate's imposing gates.

Evelyn's expression darkened. "What is this, Alexander?"

"Where our son is waiting." Amusement danced in Alexander's eyes as he added, "Our child is inside."
###Chapter 487

"Son?"

Evelyn froze.

'Victoria deceived me. I had a son, not a daughter!'

Her heart skipped a beat.

Doubt clouded her vision as she stared at Alexander's joyful expression.

Reading the unspoken question in Evelyn's eyes, Alexander met her gaze before giving a solemn nod.

All uncertainty vanished from Evelyn's heart at his silent confirmation. She practically leaped from the car.

Her hurried footsteps echoed through Blackwood Estate's grand foyer.

Alexander watched her retreating figure with remorseful eyes.

Yes, Victoria was despicable. But hadn't he been just as cruel?

Inside the manor, Eleanor Kingsley was leading little Ethan toward the dining room when a servant announced, "Sir, Madam, Miss Sinclair has returned!"

Both Eleanor and William Montgomery turned in shock, their faces lighting up at Evelyn's unexpected arrival.

"Evelyn!" Eleanor called out instinctively, her voice thick with emotion.

William's hopeful eyes shone. "Perfect timing, darling. Join us for dinner."

But Evelyn barely registered their words.

Her frantic gaze swept the room before landing on the small boy peeking from behind Eleanor.

"Mommy," Ethan chirped sweetly.

His cherubic face broke into a sunshine smile that made Evelyn's pulse race.

"Evelyn? What's wrong?" Eleanor asked, concerned by her strange expression.

"Are there... any other children here?" Evelyn whispered, unable to tear her eyes from Ethan.

The older couple exchanged confused glances just as Alexander entered. Understanding dawned on their faces.

"Are you and Daddy eating with me tonight?" Ethan asked, toddling toward Evelyn with wide, innocent eyes.

Her heart hammered against her ribs.

A terrifyingly wonderful possibility formed in her mind, but she dared not hope.

"Mommy?" Ethan repeated.

Alexander moved beside Evelyn, his deep voice heavy with regret. "When you told me Victoria slashed Ethan's face with a knife, I accused you of framing her. I couldn't believe any mother would harm her own child."

He let the words hang before continuing grimly, "Then I learned the truth - she could do such monstrous things because Ethan was never hers to begin with."

Evelyn's entire body trembled.

Tear-filled eyes met Alexander's guilty ones.

He gently wiped away her tears with his thumb.

"Ethan is the child you bore in prison, Evelyn. Our son."

The dam broke. Tears streamed down her face.

In a daze, Evelyn turned to the little boy before her.

Ethan blinked up at her with crystalline eyes, his smile never faltering.

The pain in Evelyn's chest was unbearable.
###Chapter 488

Evelyn sank to her knees, her trembling fingers tracing the delicate features of Ethan's face.

She brushed over his curious eyes, his button nose, down to his cherubic lips...

"Mommy, why are you crying?" Ethan blinked up at her in confusion, reaching up with tiny hands to wipe her tears.

Evelyn caught his small hands in hers, marveling at their softness against her calloused palms.

"My sweet Ethan... Mommy finally gets to hold you again."

Overcome with emotion, she pulled the boy into a crushing embrace.

Hot tears streamed down her face as joy and anguish warred within her heart.

She should have been celebrating this reunion, yet her chest ached as if being torn apart.

Victoria's cruelty knew no bounds. What kind of monster would devise such torment for an innocent child?

The memory of Victoria slashing Ethan's face surfaced unbidden, making Evelyn's breath hitch.

Of course Victoria would commit such atrocities.

The child she'd been torturing was Evelyn's own flesh and blood.

Though confused by his mother's tears, Ethan snuggled closer, basking in the warmth of her affection.

Eleanor leaned against William's shoulder, silent tears tracking down her cheeks at the poignant scene.

The universe had been merciless.

Why must her daughter endure such suffering?

Alexander stood apart, his eyes burning as he witnessed the emotional reunion.

How he wished he could rewrite the past six years.

Never again would he push away the woman he loved.

Evelyn's sobs gradually subsided when Ethan patted her back. "Don't cry, Mommy. Daddy and I will protect you from the bad people!"

She shook her head, her heart swelling at his innocent declaration. "No one hurt Mommy, darling. These are happy tears."

She pressed a kiss to his cheek before gathering him close once more.

"I promise I'll never leave you again, Ethan. Mommy will make up for all the lost time."

Her eyes shone with maternal devotion as she made her vow.

Alexander crouched down to ruffle Ethan's hair. "Daddy promises too. Our family stays together now."

The mention of family snapped Evelyn from her emotional haze.

Wiping her face, she gave Ethan a watery smile before turning to Alexander with cool detachment.

"We need to talk. Outside."

Rising, she addressed Eleanor and William. "Please watch Ethan for me. I won't be long."

"Evelyn..." Eleanor called after her retreating figure.

After one last pat to Ethan's head, Alexander followed Evelyn into the winter night.

The bitter wind cut through their clothes as Evelyn waited beneath the flickering lamppost.

She turned when Alexander's footsteps approached, her expression unreadable.

Alexander maintained his gentle tone. "What did you want to discuss, Evelyn?"
###Chapter 489

Evelyn's gaze was glacial as it clashed with Alexander's warm one.

"If you have any decency left, Alexander, you'll return my child to me."

"Is this what you wanted to discuss?" Alexander's lips twisted into a bitter smile. "Ethan can't lose his father just because he has his mother now."

"Father?" Evelyn let out a scornful laugh, her eyes burning with contempt. "Does your conscience not ache, Alexander? You've done nothing to deserve being called Ethan's father."

"..." Alexander pressed his lips together, silent.

Evelyn stepped closer, her slender frame radiating coldness as she faced the tall man.

"Do you even remember what you forced me to take every time you were done with me? Contraceptives. You told me a woman as wretched as me would never be worthy of bearing your children. Do you recall that?"

"..." Alexander's sharp brows furrowed at her words.

"I was already carrying your child when Victoria lured you to the hospital with her fake suicide attempt. I was foolish enough to believe my pregnancy might salvage what was left between us—but instead, you threw those pills at me before I could even tell you."

Alexander's eyes widened in shock.

"You were pregnant then?"

"I was. With Ethan. But what does it matter? You never cared!"

Her voice trembled with suppressed fury.

"You couldn't even face me to say it yourself—you texted me about the divorce. You called our child a bastard. You told me to get rid of him because I wasn't fit to be his mother, and that Victoria was the only woman worthy of bearing your heirs. You even threatened to kill him yourself if I didn't obey."

Her nails dug into her palms.

"You called your own son a bastard, Alexander Blackwood. How dare you call yourself his father now?"

She inhaled sharply, forcing her emotions down before locking her fiery gaze onto his.

"I begged you. I begged for a chance to love you, for our child's sake. But what did I get in return? Humiliation. Scars that will never fade."

"..."

Alexander felt his blood turn to ice.

His throat tightened as he stared at her icy expression. His chest ached, but his mind was blank.

When had he ever sent her such messages?

When had she begged him for love?

None of this made sense.

He knew Evelyn wouldn't lie about this. Which meant only one thing—someone had used his name to destroy her.

Snow began to drift from the darkening sky.

Evelyn wiped away the moisture at the corners of her eyes with a scoff.

"The pain of giving birth to Ethan is something I'll never be able to put into words, Alexander. And I won't waste my breath trying. Our divorce was final three years ago. Ethan is my son, and I will fight for him until the end."

She turned to leave.

Alexander caught her wrist, but before he could speak, she shot him a look so cold it froze him in place.

"All you ever did was push me away. And when I was broken beyond repair, you left me alone in the dark."
###Chapter 490

"And what about when Victoria framed me and locked me in prison? Do you remember what you told me then?"

My voice trembled with barely restrained fury.

"You told me to kill my own child—to make up for Victoria's miscarriage."

The words tasted like poison on my tongue.

"Have you forgotten every cruel thing you've ever said to me, Alexander? After everything you've done to Ethan and me, what makes you think you have the right to promise him a happy family?"

My fingers curled into fists.

"You lost the right to call yourself his father a long time ago."

I wrenched my arm free from his grasp and turned away, my heart pounding.

Alexander stood frozen, the snowflakes settling on his broad shoulders like a cruel mockery of the warmth we once shared.

Each one melted against his skin, seeping into the hollow space where his heart should have been.

Inside the house, I forced a smile as I knelt before Ethan.

"Would you like to live with Mommy from now on, sweetheart?"

Ethan's face lit up instantly. "Yes! I want to live with you!"

Then, with heartbreaking innocence, he added, "And Daddy too, so I can have both of you, like the other kids."

My smile faltered.

His hopeful eyes searched mine. "Does that mean we can all go home together after dinner?"

From the doorway, Alexander flinched.

I saw the pain flash across his face—raw and unguarded.

He expected me to refuse.

But instead, I nodded.

"Yes, baby. After dinner, we'll take you home."

I brushed his hair back, my voice soft but firm. "You are my precious boy, Ethan. And if anyone ever says otherwise, you tell me. Mommy will make sure they regret it."

Ethan clapped his hands in delight before darting off to Eleanor and William.

"Grandma! Grandpa! I'm going home with Mommy and Daddy tonight!"

He threw his arms around Eleanor, who hugged him tightly, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.

"We'll miss you, darling."

William ruffled his hair, his voice thick with emotion. "Come visit us soon, okay?"

Dinner passed in bittersweet warmth.

Eleanor and William watched me with quiet gratitude, as if my mere presence was a gift.

Afterward, I held Ethan's small hand as we walked to Alexander's car.

The drive was silent.

Through the rearview mirror, I caught Alexander's gaze—haunted, desperate.

But I refused to acknowledge it.

When we arrived at the estate, I led Ethan inside, helping him bathe and tucking him into bed.

Only when his breathing steadied into sleep did I finally step out.

Alexander was waiting.

Still in his coat, still carrying the weight of his sins.

I ignored him, moving past without a word.

"Evelyn."

His voice was rough, pleading.

I didn't stop.

"Evelyn, please."

His hand closed around my wrist, stopping me in my tracks.

Before I could pull away, he dropped to one knee before me, his grip tightening like a man clinging to his last hope.
###Chapter 491

Evelyn Sinclair never imagined she would witness the day Alexander Blackwood would kneel before her.

To say she wasn't shocked would be a lie, but beyond the shock, what truly overwhelmed her was the sheer absurdity of the situation.

The man currently on his knees was nobility personified, his name synonymous with power across all of Willowbrook. People either revered him or schemed to gain his favor.

Yet here he was - the mighty Alexander Blackwood - kneeling before the woman he'd once discarded like yesterday's news.

Evelyn's frosty gaze traveled down to study Alexander's chiseled features, his furrowed brow radiating waves of remorse.

"Who would have guessed the heir of the Blackwood dynasty would kneel before his cast-off wife?" Her lips curled in bitter amusement. "Doesn't this strike you as tragically comical, Mr. Blackwood?"

Alexander absorbed her mockery without flinching. "I'd move heaven and earth for your happiness."

A hollow laugh escaped her. "Then make me happy by vanishing from my life."

His eyes darkened as her glacial stare pierced his chest, each word like shards of ice embedding in his heart.

His only anchor was the warmth of her hand as he clung to it desperately.

"Evelyn—"

"That name died the moment I became Evelyn Sinclair," she cut him off sharply, attempting to pull away. His grip only tightened.

"Let go, Alexander. I want no more ties between us. Can't you comprehend how much I despise you?"

Her venomous tone sent chills through his body.

Despise.

Hate.

Alexander swallowed hard, forcing down the lump of anguish in his throat.

When he finally raised his wounded gaze, her beautiful features were twisted in undisguised fury.

"Lillian," he whispered her true name. "You're right - I was blind, a fool. I should never have let that viper harm my wife and child. I don't deserve forgiveness, but you must know—"

"It's too late for explanations. I won't listen, and I certainly won't believe you." Evelyn savored the desperation in his eyes before wrenching her arm free with violent force. "I don't love you anymore, Alexander. Save your hollow affections for someone who cares!"

She turned on her heel, the click of her heels echoing her finality.

Alexander remained kneeling, his shattered heart icing over with each retreating step.

The sound of the door opening jolted him from his stupor. "Lillian!"

He lunged forward, catching her at the threshold, his arms locking around her like steel bands.

"Release me!" She struggled futilely against his superior strength.

His distinctive sandalwood scent enveloped her, triggering an unwelcome flutter in her chest.

"What more do you want from me?" she hissed.

"Don't leave," he begged hoarsely against her ear. "Don't disappear from my world again. I won't survive losing you a second time."

"Save your sweet nothings for your prison-bound mistress!"

"No." His embrace tightened possessively.

"I know you won't believe me, but these words are yours alone. I mean this, Lillian. I've loved you from the beginning. Only you."

The declaration that should have been the world's most romantic phrase now sounded like a cruel joke to Evelyn's ears.

She laughed mirthlessly. "You remind me of an old saying, Alexander."

His arms slackened slightly in confusion.
###Chapter 492

The moonlight cast long shadows as their gazes collided in the darkness. Evelyn's frosty stare cut through the night as she parted her rose-colored lips. "The deaf heard the mute say that the blind saw love."

Alexander's bloodshot eyes widened at her words.

"Perhaps because you never meant what you said, Alexander," she continued, her voice dripping with ice. "That's why you treat promises like pranks and declarations of love as jokes. But I remember every word."

A bitter pause stretched between them, the mockery in her eyes intensifying.

"You told me Victoria holds an irreplaceable place in your heart," she recited, each syllable sharp as a blade. "That the moment you saw her, you knew she'd be the only woman you'd ever love and protect."

Repeating his own words back to him, Evelyn's smile twisted with contempt.

"You swore Victoria was your one and only, yet now you claim it's always been me?" A cold laugh escaped her. "If this is your version of love, Alexander, I want no part of it."

Without waiting for a response, she spun on her heel and disappeared into the night.

Left standing alone, Alexander's lips curled into a self-loathing smirk as he watched her retreat.

The past was an inescapable prison.

How could he possibly explain that his indulgence of Victoria's whims stemmed from childhood debts he could never repay?

Snow began its silent descent from the inky sky.

Though the flakes fell without sound, Alexander heard something vital shatter within him.

The night stretched endlessly before him.

Sleep refused to come as he kept vigil by Ethan's bedside.

Guilt gnawed at him as he studied the familiar features on the sleeping child's face - features that mirrored his own.

Each thought of Evelyn's struggles during her pregnancy with Ethan pierced his heart like shards of glass.

Dawn finally broke, bringing sounds of movement from downstairs.

Alexander's pulse quickened - Evelyn had returned.

Descending the stairs, he found her exactly where he'd hoped: moving gracefully through the kitchen.

The weight on his shoulders lightened slightly, but he dared not interrupt. She was here for Ethan, not him.

Determined not to provoke her further, Alexander waited until Ethan woke before helping the boy dress. Hand in hand, they went downstairs.

Spotting them, Evelyn ignored Alexander completely, her face softening as she smiled at Ethan. "I made your favorite breakfast, sweetheart. Shall I take you to school after?"

Ethan's hopeful eyes darted between them. "Can you both take me today?"

"Of course," Alexander answered quickly, relieved when Evelyn didn't object.

After breakfast, they drove to the elementary school together.

Upon arrival, Ethan proudly tugged his teacher's sleeve, pointing excitedly. "Miss Carter, these are my parents! Isn't my mom the prettiest?"

His classmates murmured in agreement. "Ethan's mom is so beautiful!"

"His dad looks like a prince!"

Ethan beamed with pride, his joy warming Evelyn's heart.

Her son would never again be the withdrawn child he once was.

As Ethan disappeared inside, Evelyn turned to leave - only to find Alexander following. "Where are you going? Let me drive you."

A sleek car pulled up just then.

Sebastian emerged, barely glancing at Alexander before opening the passenger door for Evelyn.

Seeing her move toward the vehicle, Alexander reacted instantly. His arm snaked around her waist, pulling her firmly against him. "She's not going anywhere with you. My wife rides with me."
###Chapter 493

Evelyn gasped as Alexander's strong arms suddenly wrapped around her. She hadn't even seen him approach.

Sebastian's usually gentle face darkened with anger. "Release her, Alexander. Stop harassing my fiancée."

"You know exactly who I'm holding, Sebastian," Alexander countered, his grip tightening. "Legally, Evelyn remains my wife. Don't play the homewrecker."

Sebastian's expression turned stormy.

With a faint smirk, Alexander guided Evelyn toward his car by the waist. "Let's go, darling."

Evelyn hesitated, torn between resistance and awareness of the watching parents.

Remembering Ethan's proud introduction of them as his parents moments ago, she reluctantly followed.

Only when they'd left the school grounds did Evelyn speak. "Pull over."

Alexander complied, stopping along the tree-lined avenue.

Evelyn's gaze was icy. "I only got in this car for Ethan's sake. We're done, Alexander. I'm not your wife anymore."

His knuckles whitened on the steering wheel.

As she reached for the door handle, he turned sharply. "You are. You'll always be Evelyn Blackwood."

She scoffed. "Have you forgotten forcing my signature on those divorce papers three years ago? All so you could marry Victoria Lancaster, that scheming witch?"

Alexander winced at the memory of his cruelty.

His remorseful eyes met hers, yet she detected something else - relief?

"The papers were signed," he admitted quietly. "But the divorce was never finalized."

Evelyn froze. "What?"

"I told you then - I have no ex-wife. You're the only woman I've ever married."

Her breath caught.

"Legally, we're still husband and wife, Evelyn. Then, now, always."

Her composure shattered.

Clenching her fists, she stared at his satisfied expression in disbelief. "What game are you playing? You forced a divorce, then never completed it?"

The absurdity made her voice shake.

"Fine. If we're still married, let's fix that immediately!"

She slammed the car door and strode away without looking back.

Alexander watched her retreating figure, his heart aching. The irony wasn't lost on him.

He'd once forced divorce papers on her.

Now she'd be serving them to him.

He'd brought this on himself.

Thirty minutes later, Evelyn locked herself in her Diamond Boulevard boutique office.

She pulled up divorce templates, but each draft ended up deleted.

Her hands trembled too much to type properly.

Why hadn't he finalized their divorce? The question tormented her.

Every keystroke felt like reopening old wounds. The past she'd buried kept resurfacing, and Alexander Blackwood remained the storm she couldn't escape.
###Chapter 494

She remained his lawful wife!

Three sharp raps echoed against the office door.

Evelyn glanced up to see Sebastian Whitman standing there, his lips curved in that familiar gentle smile.

After hastily organizing her desk, she gestured him inside and prepared his favorite Earl Grey tea.

Sebastian took a delicate sip before cutting straight to the chase. "Your phone's been switched off for two days. What did Alexander say to you outside Blackwood Enterprises?"

At the mention, Evelyn's entire face lit up, her eyes sparkling with unrestrained joy. "I've found my child."

Sebastian's hands trembled slightly. "Your firstborn with Alexander?"

"Yes." Her dimples appeared as she smiled. "Can you believe Ethan has been right beside me all this time?"

"Ethan is your son?" Sebastian's teacup clattered against the saucer.

Evelyn nodded eagerly. "It explains why I've always felt this inexplicable bond with him."

Sebastian studied the radiant expression she'd never shown him before, his gaze softening despite the tension in his brow.

"Congratulations on finally being reunited."

His smile didn't quite reach his eyes.

"You got into Alexander's car this morning because of Ethan, didn't you?"

Evelyn nodded. "I never wanted to be separated from him in the first place. As his mother, I owe him everything. Victoria only tortured him because of me."

"None of this is your fault." Sebastian gently grasped her hand. "The blame lies entirely with Victoria and Alexander. When you file for divorce, I'll help you fight for full custody of Ethan."

Evelyn's brow furrowed at the word 'divorce.' "Sebastian, I—"

"Just give me a little more time to settle some unfinished business." His obsidian eyes gleamed with tenderness. "Then I'll take you and Ethan back to France to see Amelia. We'll marry there—live simply and happily as a family of four."

He pulled her into a light embrace.

Evelyn hesitated, torn between returning the hug or pushing away. This had been her dream too—to leave behind the rumors and start anew after her revenge.

Yet now, her resolve wavered inexplicably.

Not long after Sebastian left, Olivia Bennett arrived at the boutique.

Evelyn recounted everything from the past two days, causing Olivia to nearly drop her teacup in shock.

"That bastard actually had the nerve to say he loves you? Love my ass!" Olivia's voice shook with fury. "Don't you dare believe him, Evelyn! He's probably just trying to manipulate you into stabilizing Blackwood Enterprises' stocks."

Evelyn nodded firmly. "Relax. Whatever feelings I had for him died years ago."

"Damn right!" Olivia squeezed Evelyn's shoulder affectionately. "As despicable as that bastard is, I'm overjoyed you found your son!"

"After everything you endured giving birth to him, then being tortured nearly to death by that monster and his bitch..." Olivia's eyes glistened. "I'm just relieved he's safe. And my god, he's grown into such a handsome boy."

"Ethan's remarkably mature for his age." Evelyn's voice cracked. "Knowing what he suffered breaks my heart."

"It breaks mine for you." Olivia wiped her eyes. "But don't let this change your plans, Evelyn. After everything Alexander put you through, you can't possibly go back to him."

Long after Olivia left, her words echoed in Evelyn's mind.

She wouldn't return to him.

Never again.

Evelyn spent the entire day locked in her office, redrafting divorce papers.

Outside, an icy wind howled against the windows.

Just as she finished typing, her finger accidentally hit 'close' instead of 'save.'

Frustrated, she rummaged through old files and inadvertently opened one of the unnamed folders copied from Alexander's computer.

She remembered it contained thousands of text documents. Clicking randomly, one file opened to reveal a single line: "It's nice to see you again. I mean it."

A strange unease settled over Evelyn as she reread those words.

She immediately closed it, only to open the first document in the sequence.

What she read there left her utterly stunned—
###Chapter 495

The document was structured like a personal journal.

When Evelyn clicked on it, the first thing that caught her eye was the date at the top.

It was from three years ago—the day after her supposed death.

The contents left her speechless.

[I never imagined you'd leave me like this. You wouldn’t, right? This has to be a cruel joke. Stop playing games, Evelyn. It’s not funny.]

[You swore you’d love me forever, that you’d never let me go. How could your "forever" be so short? I refuse to believe it. I won’t accept it.]

[You’re doing this on purpose, aren’t you? Making sure I never forget you, making sure I ache for you every single day. You’re cunning, but I won’t fall for it.]

[Evelyn…]

[Evelyn…]

The rest of the document was just her name, repeated over and over.

Her fingers trembled slightly over the mouse.

Though the words on the screen were clear, Evelyn couldn’t fathom what Alexander must have felt when he wrote them.

She didn’t understand why he would pour his emotions into this digital space.

It was as if he couldn’t—or wouldn’t—accept that she was gone.

The words carried the weight of a man on the edge of collapse.

Evelyn stared at the screen, stunned. The timestamp was undeniable proof—this wasn’t fabricated.

Her gaze flickered to the countless other files in the folder.

She hesitated, her finger hovering over the mouse, reluctant to open another.

Just then, an employee approached. "Mr. Blackwood is here, Miss Prescott."

There was a knowing smirk in her tone.

"He says he’s here to pick up his wife."

Evelyn’s jaw tightened.

She quickly closed the file, pulling up the divorce agreement from the browsing history before printing it.

"I’m not his wife. There’s nothing left between us." Her voice was sharp as she rolled up the papers and headed downstairs.

The moment she stepped into the lobby, her breath hitched.

Alexander stood there, holding an extravagant bouquet of blood-red roses, his presence commanding the room.

His striking features—the sharp cut of his jaw, the dark intensity of his eyes—made him impossible to ignore.

And right now, those obsidian depths softened as they locked onto her, a faint smile playing on his lips.

The sight of him, so effortlessly magnetic, had women nearby sighing dreamily.

"Goodness, he’s gorgeous!"

"That’s Alexander Blackwood!"

"Even after all this time, he’s still so romantic with Miss Prescott."

"She’s so lucky."

Evelyn clenched her fists.

It was public knowledge that she had married him as Vivian Prescott.

But whether she was Evelyn Sinclair or Vivian now, she was done with this man.

Alexander stepped forward, his gaze tender as he offered her the roses. "Let’s go get Ethan from school, Evelyn."

She tightened her grip on the divorce papers.

For a moment, she considered throwing them in his face right then.

Instead, she forced a cold smile.

"Fine. Let’s go."
###Chapter 496

Though Evelyn refused the bouquet, Alexander found solace in her silent acceptance.

The moment she slid into the passenger seat, divorce papers hit the dashboard with a sharp slap.

"My signature's already there." Her voice was ice. "Just return them when you've signed yours."

Alexander's stomach dropped at the bold "DIVORCE AGREEMENT" header.

He shoved the documents into the glove compartment without reading further and accelerated.

"Ethan's never known a complete family, Evelyn. Don't you think—"

"Don't use our son as leverage." Her glare could freeze lava. "Whatever game you're playing ends now. Did you really think I'd believe your sudden affection after everything?"

The finality in her tone left no room for argument.

Alexander clenched the steering wheel until his knuckles whitened.

At Pinecrest Academy, Evelyn moved to the backseat to sit beside Ethan.

Her breath caught seeing Alexander's features mirrored in their son's face.

My sweet boy. Every scar was worth it just to see you again. This is enough for me.

She didn't object when Alexander drove them to Blackwood Estate.

Evelyn headed straight for the kitchen while Alexander helped Ethan with homework. The domesticity of the scene twisted the knife in his chest.

Dinner smelled like nostalgia—her signature rosemary chicken, the same dish she'd left cooling on their dining table countless nights.

Back then, he'd never come home. Not to Meredith's bed as Evelyn assumed, but to empty offices and whiskey-filled glasses.

Watching Evelyn peel shrimp for Ethan, Alexander memorized the way her lashes fluttered when their son giggled.

After dessert, he washed dishes while mother and son strolled through the moonlit gardens. Through the window, their laughter carried on the breeze.

Finding them by the koi pond, Alexander's heart stuttered when Ethan waved. "Daddy! Come see the big fish!"

Evelyn's smile didn't reach her eyes but she didn't correct him—not when Ethan glowed between them.

The walk back was colder. Ethan drowsed in Alexander's arms as streetlights painted their path gold.

When Evelyn shivered, he captured her chilled fingers in his coat pocket. She stiffened but didn't pull away, not with Ethan sighing sleepily against his shoulder.

Moonlight gilded them like a Renaissance painting—a perfect nuclear family illusion.

The spell shattered back at the estate. The moment Ethan's bedroom door clicked shut, Evelyn thrust the papers forward again. "Sign them."

Alexander crossed his arms. "No."

Her bitter laugh echoed his own refusal from years past.

"I won't repeat my mistakes." He stepped closer, voice raw. "Give us another chance. For Ethan. For Amelia."

"Amelia isn't yours."

"Our daughter," he insisted, cornering her near the fireplace. "You conceived her that night in the penthouse three years ago—the night I took you like a starving man."

His thumb brushed her collarbone where he'd left marks. "You think I don't know my own wife's body? That I wouldn't recognize the child we made?"

The fire popped between them, casting shadows that danced across Evelyn's unreadable expression.
###Chapter 497

Evelyn's eyes burned with unshed tears as her fingers curled into tight fists. "Amelia has no connection to you, Alexander! Stop deluding yourself!"

Her composure cracked as the painful truth spilled out. "You destroyed me completely, you monster. Sebastian was the only light in the darkness you left me in!"

She met Alexander's increasingly stormy gaze without flinching.

"Amelia is Sebastian's child—ours. She will never call someone like you her father, so stop trying to claim her!"

With that, Evelyn shoved past him, her hands trembling.

Alexander stumbled back, his legs unsteady beneath him. He barely registered the movement before she was gone, her bag slung over her shoulder as she stormed out of the villa.

Inside the taxi, Evelyn exhaled shakily, her mind spiraling into the past.

She remembered dragging her weakened body to Alexander and Victoria's engagement party.

Her heart had shattered, but she had forced a smile through every cruel word from the man she loved and the hatred from the parents who had once adored her.

She had been certain she would die there.

Then, inexplicably, Alexander had rushed to her side, his voice frantic as he demanded to know what was wrong.

She had barely managed two words before darkness swallowed her.

She had thought it was the end.

Yet she had woken again—this time in the royal hospital of F Country, with Sebastian Whitman standing over her.

He had saved her from death's doorstep.

The tumor removal surgery had been successful, but while her body healed, her heart remained in pieces.

Then came the news that changed everything.

She was pregnant.

Amelia became her reason to keep going. Sebastian stayed by her side through every moment of despair.

The memories faded as Evelyn stared out the taxi window, her jaw set.

She would sever every last tie with the man who had destroyed her.

The following days settled into an uneasy routine.

Evelyn arrived at the villa early each morning to prepare breakfast for Ethan before taking him to kindergarten.

Alexander waited outside her boutique every evening so they could pick Ethan up together.

After dinner, she would take the boy for a walk, but she always returned—with Alexander trailing behind.

She stayed only until Ethan was bathed and asleep, then left without a word.

Her indifference toward Alexander never wavered, but he didn’t complain.

This fragile arrangement was more than he deserved.

Then came the court summons.

Blackwood Enterprises faced staggering fines for halted projects with RS and South America.

The financial burden should have been handled by the company, but the notice somehow reached Henry Blackwood instead.

Unable to pay, Blackwood Estate was to be auctioned off.
###Chapter 498

Like a frantic moth drawn to flame, Margaret Blackwood summoned Alexander Blackwood to her side.

Sebastian Whitman arrived shortly after, his presence slicing through the tension like a blade.

Clad in an impeccably tailored suit, Sebastian's usual aristocratic charm was now laced with something darker—something predatory.

Noticing Henry Blackwood, Alexander, and the rest of the Blackwood family gathered, Sebastian wasted no time. His assistant handed over a document before he delivered his ultimatum.

"This estate is mine now. Out of courtesy, I’ll give you twenty-four hours to gather your belongings and leave."

Margaret shot to her feet, her finger trembling as she jabbed it toward him. "Sebastian, you monster! First, you steal Blackwood Enterprises, and now you’re taking Henry’s home? Have you no shame?"

Sebastian’s lips curled into a humorless smile. "Shame?"

His obsidian eyes glinted with icy mockery.

"If any of you had an ounce of it, we wouldn’t be standing here."

"What—what are you implying?" Margaret sputtered.

Sebastian ignored her, locking eyes with Alexander instead.

"If you had even a shred of decency, Evelyn wouldn’t have been left to suffer at death’s door."

Then, his gaze shifted to Henry Blackwood, silent and pale. The hatred in Sebastian’s voice was razor-sharp.

"My parents wouldn’t have died in agony if not for your treachery."

"You dare lecture me about shame?"

Margaret’s fury withered under the weight of his glare.

Sebastian’s cold scrutiny swept over Henry before landing back on Alexander.

"You and your grandfather are responsible for the ruin of the Blackwoods."

With that, he turned to his assistant. "Make sure they’re gone by tomorrow."

"Yes, Mr. Whitman."

As Sebastian moved to leave, Alexander finally spoke. "Sebastian."

Sebastian paused.

Alexander approached, his expression grave. "Henry never meant to harm you or your parents. What happened was an accident. This estate was passed down through generations. I can’t let you take it."

Sebastian’s laugh was devoid of warmth. "You expect me to believe that?"

His refined features twisted into something dangerous.

"Worry about yourself, Alexander. You’re about to lose your son."

Alexander’s eyes darkened, his voice a lethal warning. "Stay away from Ethan. And don’t you dare go near Evelyn. We never divorced—she’s still my wife."

"What?" Margaret gasped. "Alexander, what are you saying? Didn’t you divorce that— Didn’t you end things three years ago?"

Sebastian’s phone rang, cutting her off.

Seeing the caller ID, his smirk returned as he answered, his voice softening unnervingly. "Vivian."

The contrast to his earlier tone was staggering.

Alexander’s jaw clenched as he watched Sebastian speak to Evelyn—his Evelyn.

Then came the words that sent a chill down his spine.

"Relax. I’m on my way. Wait for me."
###Chapter 499

Alexander's heart twisted painfully.

The moment Sebastian ended his call with Evelyn, Alexander immediately tried to reach her. But of course—she had already blocked his number.

Sebastian chuckled darkly.

"Don't waste your time. Evelyn loves me now. The only thing she feels for you is disgust."

Alexander's expression turned stormy. "What happened to her, Sebastian? What did she tell you?"

"That's none of your concern," Sebastian replied icily. "You lost the right to ask about Evelyn long ago."

"Who cares about that woman anyway?" Margaret snapped from behind Alexander before he could respond, gripping his arm tightly. "She helped Sebastian ruin our family, Alexander! Why are you still obsessed with her? Have you forgotten how much you despised her before?"

Alexander yanked his arm away, irritation flashing in his eyes. "Stay out of my business."

"Alexander! Alexander!"

"Enough!" Henry Blackwood finally spoke, his voice cutting through the tension. "Go pack your things. We're leaving tomorrow."

"What?" Margaret's eyes widened in disbelief. "We're really giving up the estate to Sebastian? He accused you of murdering his parents! I thought they died in an accident—what's really going on?"

"Silence! Pack and be ready to leave."

Margaret pressed her lips together, fuming. "And where exactly are we supposed to go? Some cramped apartment? Absolutely not!"

With a huff, she stormed upstairs, frantically gathering her jewelry and valuables—just in case they were seized to settle the family's debts.

Meanwhile, Alexander followed Sebastian's car through the city streets, his grip tight on the steering wheel.

In the distance, he spotted Evelyn standing beside a sleek black sedan.

The sunlight caught her delicate features, making her glow with an ethereal elegance. His breath hitched.

Alexander quickly parked and rushed toward her.

Hearing footsteps, Evelyn turned—and for one heart-stopping moment, her lips curved into a soft, tender smile.

His pulse raced.

Then reality crashed down.

She wasn't looking at him.

Her smile was for Sebastian, who stood just behind Alexander.

The crisp March wind carried the lingering chill of winter, seeping straight into Alexander's bones.

Evelyn's gaze turned glacial when it landed on him. "Why is he here? I don’t want to see him."

Sebastian smiled warmly. "Then wait in my car. I've already called for a tow truck."

Evelyn nodded. "Alright."

Alexander realized then—the white car stalled by the roadside was hers.

She could drive now.

The realization hollowed him out. He had missed yet another piece of her life.

As Evelyn moved to leave with Sebastian, Alexander grabbed her wrist. "Don't go with him, Evelyn."

She stopped. Lifted her eyes. "Let go."

Two words. That was all he got.

His fingers tightened instinctively. "I won't let you leave with him. You're my wife."

"Wife?" Evelyn scoffed, wrenching free before slipping her arm through Sebastian's. "Let's go, Sebastian."

Sebastian smirked, casting Alexander one last mocking glance over his shoulder.

The city bustled around them, but Alexander stood frozen, the wind howling through the emptiness in his chest.
###Chapter 500

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the city.

Alexander had countless reasons to keep Evelyn close, yet he stood helplessly as she walked away with Sebastian.

Hours dragged by in agonizing silence. The moment dusk settled, he rushed to Diamond Boulevard, only to be met with the news—Evelyn had already left.

His heart lurched violently.

Without hesitation, he sped toward the preschool, but the teacher informed him that Evelyn had picked up Ethan earlier.

A cold dread slithered down his spine.

She was leaving him.

Panic clawed at his chest as he raced to her apartment, his knuckles whitening around the steering wheel.

The elevator couldn’t move fast enough.

He jabbed at the doorbell repeatedly, but only silence answered.

The air turned frigid around him. Darkness swallowed his vision, his lungs constricting as if the world had stolen his breath.

Lillian...

Do you despise me so much that you won’t even grant me one last glance?

Alexander slumped against the wall, his striking eyes dulled with despair. The fading sunlight painted lonely streaks across his hollowed features.

He had no one to blame but himself.

The golden hues blurred as moisture gathered at the corners of his eyes.

A memory surfaced—young Evelyn laughing as he chased her along the shoreline, her hair whipping in the salty breeze. He had abandoned her there, and now, history was repeating itself.

The elevator dinged softly.

Evelyn stepped out, cradling a sleeping Ethan in her arms. She froze mid-step.

Alexander Blackwood stood motionless outside her door.

His usual commanding presence had crumbled. He looked like a man stripped of all vitality, his gaze vacant, his posture slack.

She had never seen him so... broken.

Then his head lifted, as if sensing her presence. His eyes locked onto hers, everything else fading into insignificance.

"Evelyn."

The name left his lips like a prayer.

He strode forward, the shadows in his gaze dissolving into desperate relief.

His lips curved slightly when he noticed Ethan. "Let me carry him."

"I’ve got him," she said coolly.

But Alexander had already taken the boy from her arms.

Not wanting to wake Ethan, Evelyn bit back her protest and unlocked the door.

Alexander moved with surprising gentleness, tucking the child into bed before quietly shutting the bedroom door behind him.

When he turned, Evelyn was waiting, two crisp copies of divorce papers in hand.

"Since you’re here," she said, voice devoid of warmth, "sign them before you go."

His jaw tightened. "No."

A humorless laugh escaped her. She stepped closer, pressing a pen into his palm. "That’s what I said too. Remember what you did?"

"I’ve already told Ethan you’re leaving on an extended business trip. Sebastian and I are taking him to F Country. We won’t be returning." Her gaze, once filled with affection, was now colder than a winter storm. "Love me or hate me, Alexander—our paths end here."

She forced the pen into his grasp.

"Sign it," she whispered. "Let’s end this."
