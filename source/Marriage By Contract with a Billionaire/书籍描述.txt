I never imagined I’d end up as Mrs. Alexander Kane. The cold, enigmatic billionaire barely notices anyone—let alone me. But when his grandfather's will demands that he marry and have a child within 18 months, I become his unexpected choice after he dismisses dozens of other women. Why me? I don’t know. But I’m determined to make him see me as more than just a convenient solution. Life in his world is nothing like I imagined. Beneath his frosty exterior lies a man haunted by secrets—and the closer I get, the more dangerous it feels. What started as a simple arrangement is quickly becoming something far more complicated. Now, I’m risking everything—including my heart. Can I melt the heart of a man who’s never believed in love, or will I be the one left shattered and alone?
