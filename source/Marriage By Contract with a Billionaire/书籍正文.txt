###Chapter 1

Alexander Kane. New York City's youngest billionaire and one of its most coveted bachelors, sat in the back of his bespoke Rolls-Royce Phantom.his hand impatiently tapping against the plush armrest. His eyes flicked at the watch on his wrist, the gleaming face reflecting the orange glow of the evening sky as the vehicle inched forward in the gridlocked traffic.


It was already 7 p.m., and he had just left the office-his mind on a far more pressing matter than the workday's end. Today was his birthday.but the thought of celebrating felt as foreign to him as a life of mediocrity.What truly weighed on him was his destination: the old family estate,where his late grandfather, Lord Benjamin Kane, WILL,would be about to be read.


Alexander's relationship with the man was complicated-part mentor,part tyrant-but respect was non-negotiable. Though his grandfather's empire had never been the driving force behind Alexander's success. the old man's teachings had shaped him into the cold,calculating business titan he had become. He owed his rise to his abilities, but even now, at 30. Alexander could feel the weight of his grandfather's expectations pressing on him from beyond the grave. As the Rolls-Royce finally navigated the congested streets and made its way up to the mansion, Alexander's mind wandered back to memories of his grandfather-the stern lessons, the ruthless power plays,and the unyielding grip the old man had over the family and business. The Kane name, once synonymous with absolute power, still loomed large, despite his passing five months ago. When the car came to a halt, his assistant, James Parker, hurried to open the door. "Quite the turnout," Alexander remarked, his voice laced with curiosity as he took in the sight of several expensive vehicles lining the driveway. His gaze narrowed.

"Is there a party I wasn't informed about?"

James hesitated, his expression uneasy. "Young master... it's a birthday celebration. Your grandmother organized it for you."


Alexander's brow furrowed. “A birthday party?" The words were spoken with an air of disbelief, his gaze turning colder.

James swallowed hard. "Yes, sir. She insisted."

"And you knew about this... and didn't tell me?"


James shifted uncomfortably, caught between loyalty to his boss and the pressure of his grandmother's wishes. "Forgive me, sir. I was instructed not to say anything."

A moment of silence passed before Alexander's voice, calm yet edged with menace, cut through the tension. "No bonuses for the next six months."


James winced, his thoughts racing. The wrath of Alexander Kane was not something easily escaped.


Inside the mansion, the sounds of cheerful greetings hit him like a tidal wave.“Happy Birthday!" rang out from all directions. Alexander's expression soured further as he spotted his grandmother, who embraced him with a smile that didn't quite reach her eyes. "I didn't ask for this,Grandma." She laughed softly, though there was a touch of sadness in it.′′Iknow,darling. But it's your 30th. You've never celebrated before." His gaze swept over the room, and he couldn't miss the obvious-his grandmother had invited every eligible woman in New York's high society.hoping to find him a match. His lips twisted into a wry smile. He wasn't naive; this was part of her endless campaign to secure his future-according to her,anyway.

"Where's the lawyer?" he demanded, not even bothering to acknowledge the women fluttering around him like moths to a flame.


Grandma Helen raised an eyebrow but gestured toward the stairs. "Let's have a drink first. The lawyer will meet us upstairs."

"I'll head up now." Alexander said, his tone dismissive.

As he turned to climb the stairs, a woman barreled toward him, her outfit garish,her perfume overbearing. She tried to get close, but the security guards swiftly blocked her path.

"Mr. Kane, just a moment-let me introduce myself. I'm sure you'll-"


"Escort her out," Alexander ordered, his voice cold. “And make sure she doesn't return."

The woman's protests were drowned out by the sounds of the guards'firm response. Alexander didn't even glance back as he ascended to the second floor.

Two hours later, the party had dwindled to nothing more than a distant memory. The last of the guests had gone, leaving only Grandma Helen,who marched upstairs, fury barely contained beneath her graceful exterior.

"Alexander," she began, her voice sharp, "you've made your point. Can we at least get this over with?" Alexander sat at a long table, the family lawyer, Mr. Edwards, beside him.His grandmother, her lips tight with frustration, took her seat. The rest of the household staff lingered quietly in the room, their presence a silent reminder of their loyalty to the family name. The lawyer adjusted his glasses and cleared his throat. "According to the will,"' he began, his eyes scanning the paper in front of him, "Alexander receives 50% of the estate, 20% from his absent sister, 20% from Grandma Helen, and the remaining 10% from the staff. This includes Kane Enterprises and various other properties."

A pause. Everyone in the room waited for the next part, sensing there was more.


"But." Mr. Edwards hesitated, glancing at Alexander, who had not flinched since he entered the room. "There is a condition."


Alexander leaned forward, his gaze icy. "A condition?"

"Yes," the lawyer replied, his voice dropping. "To inherit the full estate,including Kane Enterprises, Alexander must marry... and have a child within one year and six months. If he fails to do so, the entire inheritance will be donated to orphanages in New York City."

The room fell silent. Grandma Helen's face drained of color. She had known her grandson's stance on marriage and had tried countless times to get him to relent, but this... this was beyond anything she had expected.

Alexander's expression remained unreadable, his voice even as he addressed the lawyer. "So, you're telling me... if I don't marry and have a child within 18 months,everything goes to the orphans?"


The lawyer nodded, his eyes glinting with uncertainty.


Alexander's gaze shifted to his grandmother, who was now fighting to hold back tears. He wasn't surprised; the old man had always pushed for this, but now, it seemed his death would be the final nail in Alexander's coffin.


His voice broke the silence, sharp and commanding. "Get out," he ordered the others. The butler and staff exited immediately.leaving only the lawyer and Grandma Helen in the room.

Once the door was shut behind them. Alexander turned to the lawyer wvith a cold smile. "And if I don't comply, what happens to the Kane legacy?"

Mr. Edwards shifted uncomfortably, unsure how to respond.

“I guess we'll see," Alexander murmured, his eyes narrowing with a dangerous gleam. “But I wonder... will I be the one to choose my fate,or will my grandfather have the final word?"

The lawyer could only stare at him, his face paling as the weight of Alexander's words hung heavy in the air.
###Chapter 2

The room seemed to hold its breath.

"Yes, Mr. Kane," Mr. Edward confirmed, his tone grave."That is exactly what the will stipulates."

The words hung heavy in the air, each syllable amplifying the silence that followed. Grandma Helen's sobs broke through the stillness, her frail hands trembling as she clutched the table for support. "Alexander, please.You must do this. Your grandfather's legacy... it cannot just vanish like that.”


Alexander's jaw tightened, his teeth grinding together. The suffocating weight of duty pressed down on his chest, but his frustration burned hotter."I understand, Grandma. But marriage? A child? In that timeframe?”


"Think about what your grandfather built, Alexander." Grandma Helen's voice cracked, but her gaze held firm. "This isn't just about money-it was his life's work, his dream. It's our family's foundation. You owe it to him... to all of us."

Alexander turned away, running a hand through his dark hair. The enormity of the situation bore down on him, but he refused to crumble beneath it. After a long pause, he muttered, "I need time to think." Mr. Edwards cleared his throat, his voice measured. “You don't have much time, Mr. Kane. The clock is already ticking." Alexander exhaled sharply. "Then let it tick. Let the inheritance go.Donate it to the orphans. As if I care." Grandma Helen gasped, her face pale with shock. "Alexander! You cannot be  serious. This is your grandfather's legacy. His life." "I know. Grandma," he replied coolly, his tone sharper now.“But I won't be coerced into a life I don't want. Not for money,not for legacy... not for anything."

Her sobs deepened, but Alexander didIn't falter. He turned away, his voice lowering. "I'll think about it. But on my terms-not his, not yours."

Grandma Helen's tears streaked down her cheeks as she whispered, “Just don't let it all go to waste, Alexander. Don't let his spirit disappear like that.Please."

Alexander's resolve flickered briefly as he caught the desperation in her voice. But the fire of past betrayals burned within him, hardening his heart.
"I'll figure it out," he said flatly, then strode out of the room without another word.



**********


That evening, Alexander sat alone in his sprawling study, a glass of whiskey in his hand. The fire in the hearth flickered, casting long shadows that seemed to mirror the chaos in his mind.

He stared at the amber liquid, his thoughts returning to the ghosts of his past-the people who had shaped him, for better or worse. Chief among them was Ariana.


Ariana. The name tasted bitter on his tongue. She had been his first great love,a fiery whirlwind who had swept into his life during his college years. She was brilliant, ambitious, and charming-a woman who seemed to match his every move. With Ariana, he had dared to dream of a future,one filled with love, a home, and even the possibility of children. But just as he had begun planning their life together, everything fell apart.On the night of their anniversary, Alexander had gone out of his way to surprise her. He had left a multi-million-dollar deal hanging in the balance to show up at her office with flowers and take her to the city's most exclusive rooftop restaurant. It had been raining that night, and he'd arrived soaked but beaming, excited to see her face when he revealed his plans.

Instead, he found her in another man's arms.


The memory was vivid-the way the rain blurred the edges of the scene,but not the betrayal etched on her face. Ariana hadn't even tried to deny it.Her explanation had been cold, cutting: “I needed more, Alex. You're good for power and status, but love? That's not you."

The words had destroyed him. But worse still was what came later-when he learned she had leaked their company's business strategies, which almost led to the company's bankruptcy.


It was then that Alexander vowed never to let himself be vulnerable again.Love was a weakness, and he refused to be played the fool a second time.

Yet,despite his resolve, life had a cruel way of repeating itself. Years later.he had given love another trial, hoping that perhaps someone could mend what Ariana had broken. But history repeated itself, and the betrayal cut even deeper.

This time, it had been Elena, a poised and refined woman who seemed different from Ariana. She had been everything he thought he needed:supportive, understanding, and seemingly genuine. For a time, Alexander believed he could build something real with her. He had let his guard down and allowed himself to hope. Then, one day, Elena revealed she was pregnant. But just as his heart dared to feeI joy, the truth came crashing down-the child wasn't his. Elena had been seeing another man the entire time, using Alexander as a convenient shield for her affair. The pain of that betrayal had solidified Alexander's belief: love was a cruel illusion.


Now, as he sat in his study, the idea of marriage and a child felt like a sick joke. Could he truly trust anyone again? Was it even possible to find someone who wouldn't see him as a mere stepping stone?

The door creaked open, interrupting his thoughts. James,his ever-loyal assistant, entered cautiously, his face a mix of hesitation and determination.

"Sir, if I may... I have an idea," James began, his voice steady but unsure of Alexander's mood.


Alexander looked up, the flicker of the fire reflecting in his cold eyes.“Speak."


James took a breath.“What if... instead of pursuing a traditional marriage,you arranged a marriage of convenience? Someone who understands the terms-no emotions, no illusions. Just a contract to fulfill your grandfather's will.”


Alexander's brow arched, the idea intriguing him. “You're suggesting I buy a wife? A name partner only?”


“Exactly,"James replied, emboldened by Alexander's interest.“It doesn't have to be romantic. It's just an agreement. That way, you can meet the terms of the will without risking... personal entanglements." Alexander leaned back in his chair, a cold smile tugging at his lips.“A marriage of convenience," he murmured, the idea taking root in his mind.It was clean, pragmatic, and-most importantly-safe. He stood abruptly, towering over James as his shadow loomed across the room.“Fine. You have 48 hours to find a suitable candidate. Someone who understands the deal. If you fail..." He let the threat hang in the air,his gaze cutting into James.
James swallowed hard but nodded. "Understood, sir."

As James left the room. Alexander turned back to the fire, the flames reflecting the sharp edge of his resolve.


A marriage of convenience.

It was a calculated move, devoid of emotion.

And yet, as the firelight flickered across his face, Alexander couldn't shake the lingering thought: could even a contract marriage truly shield him from the pain of betrayal?


The past had taught him one lesson-trusting the wrong person could cost him everything.


This time, there could be no mistakes.

And if there were... the consequences would be unimaginable.
###Chapter 3

As James exited Alexander's study, the weight of his words pressed heavily on his chest. Alexander's voice echoed in his mind, sharp and unforgiving.

"Your time begins now, James. If I were you, I'd be out of here already.I'd hate to see you lose your job because you hesitated."

James barely registered the door closing behind him with a heavy,resounding click. The task ahead seemed impossible-a 48-hour deadline to find a woman who could meet the exacting standards of Alexander Kane. The clock was already ticking, the seconds slipping away like sand through his fingers, and failure was unthinkable.

His heart raced as he stepped into the bustling office. It was like stepping into a different world-one where everything moved too fast, too relentlessly. He barely heard the chatter of colleagues or the ringing of phones. His mind was consumed by the pressure to deliver. How could he possibly find someone worthy enough for a marriage of convenience with a billionaire like Alexander? His mind was clouded with the realization that no one would willingly agree to such an arrangement unless there was something more. But what? What did she have to offer that would make her stand out? The next 24 hours became a blur of interviews, each woman mnore desperate than the last, alI eager to marry a man like Alexander Kane. Yet,none of them measured up to the cold, calculating expectations he knew his boss required. Frustration gnawed at James, his confidence eroding with each rejection. Time was slipping through his fingers, and with it, his hope of meeting Alexander's demands. Meanwhile, Alexander sat alone in his study, the silence thick with tension. His eyes remained fixed on the clock, the sound of its ticking louder than ever. He wasn't just considering the business implications of the arrangement; this could change the entire course of his life, for better or worse. The idea of entering into a cold, emotionless marriage felt like walking on a razor's edge. But his grandfather's will loomed over him like a shadow, pushing him toward a decision he wasn't sure he was ready to make.


When James finally returned to the study, the exhaustion on his face was unmistakable. He looked drained like he had aged years in a single day.His eyes were bloodshot, his shoulders slumped in defeat. Yet, there was something eIse in his expression-a flicker of hope.

Alexander didn't look up immediately. He continued to stare at the pile of documents on his desk, the heavy silence stretching between them.“You realize you only have 24 hours left," he said, his voice a mere whisper,but sharp enough to cut through the tension.“Standing here isn't going to help you.”


James swallowed hard, his throat dry. He could feel the beads of sweat on his forehead, despite the cool air in the room. "I've found someone, sir.She's...different from the others."

“Different?” Alexander's voice was laced with doubt, his gaze finaly lifting from the papers.“How?”

James hesitated for a moment before handing over the profile, his hand trembling slightly. “Her name is Lily Evans. She doesn't come from money,but there's something about her-an honesty, a strength. She might be what you're looking for."

Alexander took the profile, his sharp eyes scanning the document with ruthless precision. He was silent for along moment, the room still exceptfor the sound of rustling paper. Fially, he looked up, his gaze piercing.“Bring herin."
*************
Lily Evans stepped into the study, her heart hammering in her chest.She had imagined this moment countless times, but now that it was here,everything felt overwhelming. The opulence of the mansion, the weight of Alexander's presence-it was all too much. But she had come this far,and there was no turning back now.


She forced herself to remain composed, to mask the whirlwind of emotions inside her. This was her chance-a shot at changing her life forever. She wasn't here for the money alone, not really. She had quietly admired Alexander for years, following his career with a fascination that bordered on obsession. But now, none of that could show on her face. She had to be calm and professional. Nothing more.

Alexander's gaze flicked up as she entered, and for a moment, she swore she saw something like curiosity flash across his eyes. “Ms. Evans,” he said.his voice cold and commanding. “Please, have a seat.”

Lily nodded politely and settled into the chair opposite him, her hands folded neatly in her lap, though her palms were slick with sweat.“Thank you for seeing me,Mr.Kane." He studied her in silence, his eyes never leaving her face, as if searching for some hidden truth she wasn't willing to reveal. “You understand the nature of this arrangement?" he asked, his voice low and calculating. Lily met his gaze without flinching. "I do, Mr. Kane. I undderstand this is a marriage of convenience, not a traditional one. I'm prepared to fulfill my role without any misconceptions." Alexander leaned back in his chair, his fingers tapping rhythmically against the desk. "Why would you want to enter into such an agreement?What do you hope to gain from this?"

Lily took a deep breath, trying to steady the whirlwind of thoughts racing in her mind. "I've been struggling to make ends meet. This arrangement offers me financial stability, and I believe I can fulfill the responsibilities required. More than that, I'm not looking for love or emotional attachment.
I'm here because I want a better life."

Her words were measured, but inside, her heart was pounding. She had been silently captivated by him for so long, yet now she had to bury those feelings deep down. This was about survival, not romance.

Alexander's eyes narrowed slightly as if sensing there was more to her story, but he didn't press further. "This will be a legally binding agreement,Ms. Evans. No romance. Just a mutual commitment to fulfill the terms."

"Yes, Mr. Kane," she responded firmly. “I understand completely. I'm prepared for that."

Alexander studied her for another long moment, his expression unreadable.
Finally, he nodded. "Very well. If you're ready to proceed, we can move forward. I'll have the legal documents drawn up, and we'll begin the process of registering the marriage."


Lily's heart skipped a beat, but she forced herself to remain calm. “Thank you, Mr. Kane. I'm ready to proceed.” With that, Alexander signaled the end of the conversation. James stepped forward to take over, relief written on his face as he handled the arrangements. But as Lily left the study, her mind was a storm of conflicting emotions.She had secured what she wanted, but now... now the reality of what she had agreed to was starting to settle in. She had entered into this for security, for a chance at a new life-but she couldn't help but wonder:Why did Alexander choose her?


And deeper still: Would she regret this?

As Lily closed the door behind her, she was left with an unsettling thought.The futuare she had fought for had just begun, but it wasn't the future she had expected. And with every step she took away from that door, she couldn't shake the feeling that something far more dangerous was waiting for her.
###Chapter 4

The morning sun spilled through the wide glass windows,casting long shadows across Alexander's office. Lily sat across from him. her back straight. her hands folded in her lap, but her heart thudded wildly. The tension in the room was palpable, and Alexander's steely gaze didn't help matters.


"This marriage." Alexander began, his tone as sharp as a knife.“isstrictly for a year and a half. There will be no romance, and we will not interfere in each other's personal lives. Privacy is non-negotiable."

Lily nodded. her throat tightening. She had known this was coming,but hearing it aloud made it all feel colder, more final. She forced herself to meet his gaze. though the weight of his words pressed heavily on her chest.

Alexander's expression didn't waver as he continued. "Finally, during this time, I expect you to bear my child. When the contract expires, I will take full custody, and you will receive your payment. I assume you read the terms yesterday, and I believe you also do again before coming here."

The statement hit like a blow. Lily fought to keep her composure, though her mind raced. This wasn't just a transaction-it was a life-altering arrangement. Yet, she swallowed her emotions and nodded. "I understand,"she said, her voice steady. Then, after a pause, she added,"But before we sign, I have conditions of my own." James,standing to the side, blinked in surprise, his brows furrowing as he exchanged a glance with Alexander. Alexander's jaw tightened, the slightest flicker of irritation crossing his face. "Go on," he said, his voice dangerously calm. Lily took a measured breath. "As the woman of the house. I will handle all domestic matters. You will eat what I prepare. Additionally..."She hesitated but then pushed forward."While I understand I won't retain custody.I must be allowed to see the child twice a month after the contract ends."


The room fell into a heavy silence. James' mouth dropped open, his eyes darting between Lily and Alexander. Alexander's expression hardened.his gaze narrowing to an icy glare."You dare negotiate with me?"

"I do." Lily replied, her voice unwavering, though her palms were damp."I won't let my child grow up without knowing their mother. If you can't agree,we can end this here."


For a moment. Alexander didn't speak. The air between them felt electric,charged with unspoken tension. Then, finally, he leaned forward,resting his elbows on the desk. "No," he said firmly. “You will not have access to the child after the contract ends. If that's unacceptable,walk away now."

Lily's heart clenched, but she refused to back down. She rose from her seat,her chin held high. “Then there's nothing more to discuss. Goodbye, Mr.Kane.”Without a backward glance, she strode to the door,her steps echoing in the silence.


James turned to Alexander, panic flashing in his eyes. "Boss, are you really letting her leave? We're out of time. You won't find anyone else like her in the next year and a half." Alexander's gaze remained fixed on the door Lily had just exited. For a moment, his expression softened, but it was gone just as quickly. "It's fine,"he said curtly. "I'll deal with this myself." "Boss.,." James hesitated, then pressed. "You might regret this. She's different,and you know it." Alexander's glare silenced him. "Enough," he snapped. "Bring her back."


Lily sat in the waiting lobby, her hands clenched tightly in her lap. She had left the office with her head held high, but now that she was alone.the doubt crept in. Had she made a mistake? Her resolve wavered as the seconds ticked by.


The door creaked open, and James stepped out, his face a mixture of relief and exasperation. "Ms. Evans,” he said, his voice tinged with disbelief."I thought you'd left."


Lily glanced up, masking her inner turmoil with a small smile. "I was just gathering my thoughts."

"Well, it seems the boss has reconsidered. He's ready to proceed-on your terms.Shall we?”


Lily's heart jumped, but she kept her expression calm. Rising gracefully,she followed James back into the office,where Alexander awaited.


Alexander's cold gaze met hers as she entered, but she didn't flinch.Instead,she held her ground, standing tall as if she were the one in control.


"Let's get this over with," he said, his tone clipped.

The contract was signed in silence, the air thick with unspoken tension. When it was done, Alexander handed Lily her copy without so much as a glance. "James," he said, "show her around the estate. Make sure she has everything she needs. And give her a card for shopping-Iexpect her to dress appropriately.” James nodded, motioning for Lily to follow him. The tour of the estate was as dazzling as it was overwhelming. Lily walked through grand halIs adorned with crystal chandeliers and priceless artwork,her footsteps echoing on the marble floors. Yet. beneath the splendor. a chilling emptiness lingered. The mansion was beautiful, but it felt devoid of warmth-a gilded cage.


After introducing her to the staff and handing her a sleek black credit card.James left her to settle in. Alone in her new room, Lily stared at her reflection in the ornate mirror. The reality of her situation settled on her like a heavy weight. She had secured her place in Alexander's life,but at what cost?


That evening, as the sky darkened and the mansion fell silent. Alexander returned. He found Lily in the living room, poring over a stack of documents. She looked up, startled by his sudden presence.

“Did you settle in well?" he asked, his tone unusually soft.

"Yes,"she replied carefully. "James was very helpful."

"Good," he said, his voice regaining its usual edge. “We must present a united front. Our marriage may be a contract, but appearances matter. Are you ready for that?"


Lily nodded, determination flickering in her eyes. "I understand. I'll do what's required."


“Good,” Alexander said again.“We211attend a charity gala next weekend.Be prepared to act the part." As he turned to leave, Lily's voice stopped him. "Mr. Kane," she said, her tone steady. "You may think this is just a contract, but I won't be invisible.I'll find my place here, with or without your permission." Alexander paused, his hand on the doorframe. For a moment,he seemed to hesitate, but he didn't look back. "We'll see." he said simply, before disappearing into the shadows of the hallway.


Lily sank back into her chair, her heart racing. She had made her move,
but the gamheavyweighteginning.

And she wasn't sure if she would win-or lose everything.
###Chapter 5

Grandma Helen stood on the grand terrace of the old Kane estate,her sharp eyes taking in the serene view of the garden that had witnessed generations of family history. A faint sigh escaped her lips, betraying the mix of relief and disappointment swirling within her. Relieved that her grandson hadn't been foolish enough to squander the Kane legacy on mere strangers, disappointed that he'd resorted to marrying under such dubious circumstances.


Her wrinkled hands gripped the arms of her chair as she called out sharply,"Camila!"


"Yes, Ma'am?" Camila, the loyal servant who had been with the Kane family for decades, appeared immediately at her side, ever attentive.


"My grandson has married a girl," Helen said, her voice laced with a bitter edge of resignation. "Even if she may not be the most fitting choice,I still feel it's only right to meet her. To understand who she is... to see what kind of woman has joined our family."


Camila paused, considering the request. She knew Grandma Helen's bluntness could be overwhelming, but there was no denying that Helen's intentions, however harsh, were always rooted in concern. After a brief moment, she nodded. "That is a good idea,Grandma."

"Then fetch me my phone," Helen commanded, her voice steady and decisive. Camila handed over the phone without a word, and Helen dialed Alexander's number with practiced ease. It rang several times, and then the call was answered-but there was only silence at the other end. "Hello, Grandma," Alexander's voice finally broke through, cold and distant.as if he had been expecting her call but dreading it nonetheless.

"Why the silence?" Helen's sharp tone cut through the air. "If you're not going to speak, then don't bother picking up the phone,you rascal."

After a moment's pause, Alexander's voice was sharper, though tinged with a hint of weariness.“What is it,Grandma?"


Helen wasted no time. "How could you rush into marriage like this.without even considering the candidates I gave you last year? You know what I mean. Alexander. There were better choices."

Camila, standing in the background, couldn't help but shake her head in silent sympathy. She understood Helen's love for her grandson, but her bluntness often did more harm than good.

"Alexander," Helen continued, her voice softening with a mix of sweetness and steel, "I'm relieved you've finally settled down, but you could've done better. Even though I'm disappointed, I understand why you did it. I miss you,my boy."


For a moment, there was a heavy silence at the other end. Then,Alexander's voice, quieter now, spoke, "I miss you too, Grandma.I know we haven't seen each other yet, but I did what I had to do."

Helen felt the pang of regret stab at her heart. She wasn't giving up yet.“That's why I want to meet your wife, Lily. I want to understand the woman who's joined our family, even if it's just for dinner." Alexander's frustration crackled through the phone. "Grandma, there's no need. This marriage-it'll end in a year and a half, okay?" “What?”Helen's voice rose in shock, her dismay evident. "So, you're telling me you plan to divorce her after that?"

Alexander raked a hand through his hair, his irritation flaring. "I'm busy,Grandma. I have to go."

"But I-" Helen started, but the line went deadbefore she could finish.

"That stubborn boy," she muttered under her breath, eyes narrowing as a surge of determination took hold of her. She turned to Camila, her mind already made up.

Camila's heart sank as she saw the fire in Helen's gaze. "You're thinking of going there yourself. aren't you?"

Helen's lips curved into a steely smile. "Since he won't bring her here,I'll go to them. I'm sure she'll be there."

Camila hesitated for a moment but then nodded decisively. “A good idea. I'Il prepare the car."

Helen stood with a decisive air and walked inside to ready herself for an unexpected but necessary journey.

*******************

Meanwhile, in Alexander's mansion, Lily sat in the sitting room, half-heartedly watching a movie. Her eyes glazed over as a scene triggered a flood of memories, ones shedesperately wished to forget but could never erase. The laughter and chaos of the movie faded, and she was left alone with her thoughts.

She remembered leaving her father's home to start a new life in one of Aurora City's poorest neighborhoods. The slums had become her refuge, a place to hide her true identity, and a place to search for justice for the tragic deaths of her twin sisters.

Eight months ago, everything had changed. Lily had lost her sisters to the greed and cruelty of her stepmother and stepsister-women who were willing to kill for the fortune left in their family's will. In the wake of their deaths. Lily had escaped with nothing but a heart full of grief and rage.Her name-the heir to the Emerson empire-was the reason her sisters were dead, and now she alone carried the weight of their family legacy.


She couldn't stop the memories from rushinng back. Her ex-boyfriend, a man she had loved despite her reservations, had betrayed her most horrifically. He and his companion had raped her, and in the aftermath,she had suffered a miscarriage from the trauma. Her heart broke all over again, the unbearable grief threatening to consume her.


Lily's gaze hardened as she thought of her father. His infidelity had brought the malicious stepmother into their lives-his choices had led to the tragedy that had taken everything from her. She remembered her late mother's warnings, how her grandfather had begged her mother not to marry him. She wished her mother had listened.


After her death, everything was left to Lily and her twin sisters. But now,she was the only one left to carry the burden. The knowledge that she was the last surviving heir, forced to face the peril of her family's inheritance alone,haunted her. As Lily sat there, her thoughts swirled in chaos. If Alexander ever found out about her past-about the rape, the pain, the death of her sisters-he would never look at her the same way again. He would see her as a gold-digger, a woman who had used her tragic past to manipulate him into marriage. And the idea of him calling her a "bitch," as he coldly rejected her, made her shudder with dread. The fear of being exposed, of having everything she had worked for unraveling. consumed her.

With a shiver. Lily curled up on the couch, hugging her knees to her chest.She could see it all so clearly in her mind's eye-the day Alexander found out, the disgust in his voice, the hurt in his eyes. And the thought of him walking away from her forever...

Her breath caught in her throat, and she squeezed her eyes shut, willing the thoughts away. She didn't want to lose him, but every step she took seemed to lead her closer to that inevitable end.


And somewhere in the depths of her mind, a chilling thought lingered:What if it's already too late?


As the door to the sitting room creaked open, Lily froze,her heart hammering in her chest.

The truth-her truth-was about to catch up with her.
###Chapter 6

Aurora City's elite enclave shimmered in the late afternoon sun,its crown jewel,the Garden Estate, standing like a fortress of opulence. Built by the Kane Corporation, the estate boasted both luxury and unmatched security.making it impenetrable to outsiders without proper clearance. Grandma Helen found this exclusivity an unnecessary ordeal.

As her car passed through the final security checkpoint, she sighed heavily,her annoyance palpable. "Why must I endure this charade every single time? My grandson couldn't even bother to inform his staff that I'm not just any visitor."


"Patience, Grandma," her companion soothed,though with little success.

Helen shifted her gaze to the estate's sprawling landscape.Manicured lawns stretched endlessly, accented by gardens bursting with color. She grudgingly admitted, "At least the view is worth something.”

Upon arriving at the mansion, a team of bodyguards sprang into action,opening the car door and bowing respectfully. Helen stepped out with an air of authority, her sharp eyes scanning the area as if she were inspecting her territory.


"Welcome, Grandma," a maid named Clara greeted her, rushing out to meet her.

Helen wasted no time."Where is the woman my grandson married?"

"She isn't back yet, Ma'am," Clara replied nervously. "But she mentioned she would return by 3 p.m."

Helen nodded curtly.“Fine. I'll wait." The clock ticked closer to 3 p.m. when Lily Evans pulled up to the estate.She noticed the unfamiliar car parked outside and hesitated. Was Alexander back? Her heart skipped a beat at the possibility.though whether it was anticipation or dread,she couldn't tell.

Inside. Clara met her at the door. "You're back, Miss Evans."

"Yes," Lily answered,setting her belongings down.

"I'll take these to your room," Clara offered. “MIrs. Kane is waiting for you in the living room.”


"Mrs. Kane?” Lily's brow furrowed.

"Mr. Kane's grandmother," Clara clarified.

Realization dawned on Lily, and she quickly smoothed her hair and adjusted her simple outfit. “I'll see her right away."

Lily stepped into the living room, her heart pounding. Sitting in an ornate armchair was a woman whose presence commanded the room. Helen's sharp eyes studied Lily before offering a faint smile, one that didn't quite reach her eyes.


"Hello, Grandma. It's nice to meet you," Lily greeted you with a polite smile, masking her nervousness.


Helen gestured to the seat across from her, "Sit down, dear." Lily obeyed, her posture poised and respectful. Helen observed her, noting the unassuming grace in Lily's movements. Despite her simple attire,she carried herself with a quiet dignity that intrigued Helen. “1assume you're the one my grandson married?" Helen asked, her tone neutral.

"Yes, Grandma." Lily replied softly.


Helen chuckled, a glint of amusement breaking through her usual stern demeanor. “Well, I already like you. Alexander may have stumbled into this, but he's made a good choice.”


Lily smiled politely but avoided holding Helen's gaze fortoo long,unsure of what to make of the compliment.

"What's your name, dear?" Helen asked, her curiosity piqued.

"Lily Evans," she replied.

"Lily Evans," Helen repeated, letting the name roll off her tongue.“A lovely name."

"Thank you,Grandma.”

Helen leaned forward slightly, her tone softening.“Tell me about yourself.Lily. What do you love to do?"


Lily opened her mouth to respond, but a familiar voice cut through the air,cold and unyielding.


"There's no need for that," Alexander said, striding into the room. "This marriage will last only a year and six months.”

Lily froze, her composure shattering for a brief moment before she masked her hurt. Helen's frown deepened at her grandson's callousness,but she quickly turned back to Lily with a reassuring smile.

Lily stood abruptly, attempting to steer the conversation."What would you like to eat, Grandma? I'll prepare something for you." Alexander's brow furrowed, his displeasure evident.

Such a considerate offer earned Helen's approval.“You're a sweet child.
but there's no need. I have other engagements to attend."

“Let me see you off, then," Lily offered, moving towardthe door.


Before she could take another step. Alexander stepped in front of her, his towering presence cutting off her path. His dark eyes locked onto hers, and though her heart raced, she forced herself to meet his gaze briefly before looking away.


"Clara will see her off," he said firmly.

Helen left with a knowing smile, pleased with her visi but aware of the tension in the air.


As the sound of the car faded into the distance, Alexander handed Lily a folder."Sign both copies and give one to Clara," he said curtly, his tone brooking no argument.

Lily held the folder in her trembling hands, watching as he turned and left without another word. She exhaled shakily, steeling herself before retreating to her room.

Alone,she carefully read through the new contract, her stomach churning as each clause confirmed the cold, transactional nature of their arrangement. With a resigned sigh, she signed both copies and delivered one to Clara. Later, in the kitchen, Lily overheard the hushed whispers of the staff. "Why is Mr. Kane back so early?”one asked nervously. "He's in a foul mood," another muttered.

Their fear was palpable, and Lily stepped in to reassure them. "It's fine.Go on with your work. I won't say anything.”

Clara approached her hesitantly. “Is there anything else you need, Miss Evans?”


Lily shook her head, her mind already preoccupied. "Just tell me where I can find Mr.Kane."


"He should be in his study," Clara replied.

Following the maid's directions, Lily made her way to the study. Her nerves prickled as she raised her hand to knock, hesitated, then knocked softly.


No response.

She was about to try again when a familiar, icy voice came from behind her,sending a chill down her spine.

"What are you doing here?" Alexander demanded, his presence looming as he stepped closer.
###Chapter 7

Lily froze as Alexander Kane's imposing frame approached, his expression unreadable and his movements precise. He stopped a mere step away, the tension between them palpable.

"I came to give you this," she said, her voice steadier than she felt,extending the signed contract toward him.

Alexander's sharp gaze flickered to the document. He didn't move to take it. "I instructed you to hand it to Clara," he said, his voice cold, laced with quiet authority.

"She might be busy," Lily replied, summoning her courage. "So I decided to bring it myself."

A flicker of something-amusement, perhaps-passed across his face before his demeanor hardened again. He stepped closer, invading her space.Lily's pulse quickened.

"Did you bring it yourself intentionally?" he asked, his tone low and probing, his eyes locked onto hers as if searching for something hidden beneath her calm facade.

"Huh?" Lily blinked, her confusion genuine.

Alexander studied her for a moment longer, the tension between them stretching taut. Then, without warning, he snatched the contract from her hand,his touch igniting a shiver that raced down her spine. "You can leave now," he said flatly. He turned abruptly, disappearing into his study, the door closing behind him with a decisive click. Lily exhaled slowly, the weight of his cold dismissal pressing on her chest. She turned and walked away, the sound of her heels echoing in the silent corridor.

The evening passed insolitude, the grand dining room feeling cavernous as Lily ate alone. Alexander had requested his meal be brought to his study,leaving her with nothing but the company of her thoughts and the suffocating weight of their arrangement.

By morning. Lily had resolved to reclaim some semblance of normalcy.She dressed for work, her modest outfit reflecting her practical mindset.The coffee shop she managed had been closed for two days, and she was eager to immerse herself in something familiar.

As she descended the stairs, skipping breakfast in her rush, she was startled to find Alexander seated in the living room, a newspaper in hand.

He glanced up, his dark eyes unreadable. "You'll never understand why,"he said suddenly, his voice cutting through the quiet like a blade.

Lily froze. Had she spoken her thoughts aloud?

Alexander lowered the newspaper deliberately, his gaze sweeping over her with unsettling intensity. He stood, his movements measured.

"Let's go," he commnanded, his tone leaving no room for negotiation.

"You mean us?" she asked, her confusion evident.

"Is there someone else here, Miss Evans?" His voice was clipped,his impatience clear. "I... Where are we going?" she stammered. "No questions," he snapped,stepping toward her. "But I have to

"Did you forget the terms of the contract?" His voice was sharper now.each word cutting like ice. He loomed over her, his presence suffocating. "One thing I detest is repeating myself. Don't make me do it again."

Lily swallowed hard, foreing herself to meet his piercing gaze. Her defiance flickered, but his intensity smothered it.


"You are coming with me," he declared, his grip firm as he seized her wrist and pulled her toward the door.


She stumbled slightly but quickly steadied herself, biting her lip to suppress her frustration. He released her only when they reached the waiting car.


"Get in," he ordered, his tone brooking no argument.


Lily obeyed, sliding into the car. She winced at the faint ache in her wrist,her fingers brushing against the faint bruise. Her gaze flickered to Alexander, who was already engrossed in his laptop, his focus unyielding.She turned her attention to the window, the city blurring past as they drove in silence.


The car finally pulled into the sprawling grounds of an upscale hospital.The sleek, modern building loomed before them, its reputation for catering to the wealthy and powerful unmistakable. Lily followed Alexander into the building, her unease growing with each step. They ascended to the 14th floor, the air growing heavier with unspoken tension. Her breath hitched as they entered the gynecology department. Her heart sank. She had known the marriage's purpose-to produce an heir-but the cold efficiency with which Alexander moved left her shaken.

"Mr. Kane," a middle-aged man greeted warmly, extending a hand.

"Dr. Williams," Alexander replied curtly, shaking his hand with a firm grip.

Dr. Williams glanced at Lily, his curiosity apparent. "And this must be-"


"Lily Evans," Alexander interrupted.

"Nice to meet you, Miss Evans," the doctor said with a friendly smile.

Lily nodded politely,forcing a small smile.

"Let's get straight to it," Alexander said, his impatience evident.

Dr. Williams raised an eyebrow but led them to his office.Alexander's commanding presence filled the room as he settled into a chair, while Lily perched nervously on the edge of hers.


The doctor listened as Alexander laid out his request, his expression shifting from surprise to amusement.


"IVF?" Dr. Williams asked finally, a faint chuckle escaping him. "That's your plan? I'd recommend something... simpler."

Alexander's cold glare silenced him instantly. "We're proceeding with IVF,"he said firmly.


The doctor sighed,leaning back in his chair.′′It′sa time-intensive  process.Are you sure it aligns with your...timeline?" Alexander's jaw tightened. "I freed my morning for this. Don't waste my time." Dr. Williams nodded reluctantly. "Very well. We'll begin preliminary tests today." He turned to Lily. "Miss Evans, if you'll come with me."


Lily hesitated but stood, glancing at Alexander. His expression remained impassive, his attention already back on his phone.

The tests were invasive and clinical, each step stripping away more of Lily's autonomy. By the time they returned to the office,she felt drained.

"Everything is in motion," Dr. Williams said, addressing Alexander.


Alexander stood, his presence as overbearing as ever. "Good. Keep me updated."


As they left the hospital, the tension in the air was suffocating. In the car,Lily finally dared to glance at Alexander.

"Prepare yourself," he said without looking at her, his voice low and ominous. "This is just the beginning."

Lily turned back to the window, her chest tightening. Whatever lay ahead,it promised to be anything but simple.
###Chapter 8

Flashback at the Hospital...

The sterile office was eerily silent, the tension stretching like a taut wire.Alexander Kane leaned back in his chair, his piercing gaze locked on Dr.Desmond. "Isn't there a faster way to determine if she can conceive?" he asked, his voice cold and deliberate.


Dr. Desmond sighed. "The only way to know is to proceed with IVF.Medical advancements haven't yet reached the point where we can predict outcomes without taking preliminary steps."


Alexander's jaw tightened, his frustration barely contained. "What about the normal method?" Dr. Desmond ventured cautiously, eyeing Alexander."It's faster, more reliable, and considering your timeline, more logical."

Alexander's expression darkened, his eyes glinting like shards of ice. "You know as well as I do, Desmond, that I didn't marry her by choice. This isn't a matter of desire-it's business. Do the tests and proceed with IVF.No further discussion."


Dr. Desmond raised his hands in a gesture of surrender. "As you wish,"he muttered, his tone laced with resignation.


The door to the office opened, and Alexander stepped out, his presence commanding the space. Lily quickly stood, catching his steely gaze before he turned away. "It was nice meeting you, Lily," Dr. Desmond said, trailing after him."Shame we can't have that lunch date, but I hope we can still be friends."His warm smile momentarily eased the tension. Lily managed a polite smile. "Nice meeting you too. Dr. Desmond."

Alexander's pace quickened, his impatience evident. Lily hesitated before following, her heels clicking against the pristine floor as she tried to keep up.


By the time she reached the parking garage, Alexander was already seated in the car, his posture rigid. He glanced up as sheapproached,his expression unreadable. "What are you waiting for? Get in. I don't have all day."


Lily's brows furrowed. "I'll get to work from here. You don't need to drop me off."


Alexander's gaze sharpened his tone like a whip crack. "I don't recall askingfor your opinion. Get in."

Reluctantly, Lily slid into the car, her frustration mounting. The vehicle pulled away, the silence inside suffocating. She stared out the window,determined to ignore him.


Halfway through the drive, his voice broke the silence, low and cutting. "So.you were eager for that date?"


Lily blinked, confused. "What?"

Alexander's gaze burned into her. "Miss Evans, don't feign ignorance.I saw how easily you smiled at his cheap flattery. Or are you like every other woman, swayed by hollow compliments?" Her hands balled into fists."Idon't- " "Save it," he snapped, his words slicing through her like a blade. Lily clenched her jaw, swallowing her restort. The weight of his accusations settled on her like a suffocating blanket. She pieced together his insinuation-he was referring to Dr. Desmond's lighthearted remark.The realization stung more than she cared to admit.

The car slowed in front of her coffee shop. Before it had fully stopped,Lily stepped out, her movements brisk and deliberate. She didn't look back as she strode toward the entrance, her spine rigidI with anger.

Inside, Sarah, her trusted confidante, greeted her with wide eyes."Who was that?" she asked, her tone dripping with curiosity.

Lily exhaled slowly, forcing a smile. "Guess."

Sarah's brows furrowed. "I can't. You've been keeping a low profile ever since...well,you know. So,who is it?"

Lily hesitated before answering. "Alexander Kane."

Sarah's jaw dropped. "You're joking, right? The Alexander Kane? Cold-hearted billionaire? What's he doing here?"

Lily leaned against the counter, her resolve wavering."It's... complicated."

Sarah narrowed her eyes. "Start talking."

Over the next several minutes, Lily recounted the events of the past few days, her voice steady despite the whirlwind of emotions coursing through her. Sarah listened intently, her disbelief growing with each word. When Lily finished, Sarah shook her head. "This is insane. You're telling me you married him under a contract to have his child? What if he never cares for you? What about your plan to seek justice for your sisters?" Lily's expression hardened. "I haven't forgotten my purpose. This marriage is just a detour. I'll find the evidence I need and ensure those responsible pay."

Sarah's gaze softened. "Just... don't lose yourself in this, Lily.Promise me."

"I won't." Lily said firmly, though a flicker of doubt tugged at her.


That evening, she returned to the mansion, exhaustion settling over her like a heavy cloak. As she stepped inside, Clara greeted her with an unusually formal tone.


"Welcome back, ma'am."

Lily blinked. Ma'am? Yesterday, everyone had called her Miss Evans.
What had changed?

"Thank you, Clara," she said cautiously.

"Would you like dinner, ma'am?"

"I've already eaten. I'll head upstairs now."


Clara nodded but hesitated. "Before you go, ma'am, there's something you should know."


"What is it?"

"Mr. Kane instructed us to move your belongings into his bedroom today."

Lily froze, her heart pounding. "His bedroom?" "Yes, ma'am. It was his direct order," Clara said, her tone neutral. Lily stood rooted to the spot, her mind racing, Alexander Kane's motives were a labyrinth she couldn't begin to decipher. And now, as the realization sank in, she felt the weight of the next movement pressing down on her like a dark cloud.


What was he planning?
###Chapter 9

Lily froze as Clara's words echoed in her mind. Her belongings had been moved to Alexander Kane's room. She hadn't prepared for this, mentally or emotionally. A shiver of unease coursed through her. It wasn't passion driving him to do this-it was a necessity. The weight of reality pressed down on her chest, suffocating.


For any other woman, sharing a room with Alexander might have been a dream, but for Lily, it felt like walking into a trap.

"Ma'am?" Clara's voice snapped her out of her thoughts.

Lily straightened, masking her turmoil. "I'll head up now. Good night,Clara."


"Good night,ma'am."

The elevator ride to the top floor was suffused with a tension Lily couldn't shake. When the doors opened, she stepped into a world that felt starkly different from the rest of the house. The air here seemed colder, heavier.The grand double doors loomed before her, and as she pushed one open,the master bedroom greeted her with its imposing elegance.


The space was vast, with dark, masculine tones dominating the decor.Everything screamed wealth and power, yet there was an unsettling emptiness to it. Her gaze flicked to the walk-in closet, where her belongings had been meticulously arranged. It all felt surreal. A year ago, she had watched him from afar at a business conference, her heart foolishly fluttering at the sight of him. Back then, she had admired him and dreamed of a connection that now seemed laughable.He was a man of steel, emotionally detached and driven by cold pragmatism.

Lily shook off the memories. She wasn't here for love or dreams. She was here to fulfill a contract-a business transaction with high stakes.

She explored the room briefly, her fingers brushing against the pristine sheets of the bed. The reality of sharing this space with him sent a chill down her spine. She took a deep breath, heading to the en-suite bathroom to wash away the tension clinging to her skin.


After a long bath, she slipped into her nightwear and climbed into bed.Sleep came fitfully, the weight of her situation pressing on her chest.

But hours later, something jolted her awake.


Her eyes shot open, and her breath hitched. Alexander was sitting on the edge of the bed, still in his suit. His face was unreadable, his piercing gaze locked on her.


"You're back," she said cautiously,sitting up.

He didn't respond, his silence more oppressive than any words could have been.


"I heard my things were moved here," she pressed, though she already knew why. "Care to explain?" Alexander stood, his movements deliberate as he removed his jacket and began loosening his tie. "A woman who adds clauses to a contract without hesítation shouldn't ask such an obvious question," he said, his tone laced with disdain. Lily bristled at the insult. It was his second one today, and her patience was wearing thin. She clenched her fists, forcing herself to stay calm. Without a word, she swung her legs off the bed, grabbed her phone, and headed for the door.

But before she could reach it, his hand closed around her wrist,yanking her back with an iron grip.

"And where do you think you're going?" His voice was low, dangerous.

"Away from you and your insults,"she snapped, trying to wrench free.

His grip only tightened. "Don't test me, Lily."

In one swift motion, he dragged her back and threw her onto the bed. She gasped,her body jolting from the impact. Before she could scramble away,he was on top of her, his weight pinning her down.

"What are you doing?" she demanded, her voice trembling.

"This is your room now," he said, his hand brushing a strand of hair from her face with unsettling gentleness. "Until you're pregnant."


His words sent a chill through her, but it was his touch-light,almost tender-that made her heart pound. She stared up at him, her breath hitching as his face hovered closer.


Then his lips were on hers, firm and insistent. She froze, her mind racing.This wasn't part of theplan. She wasn't supposed to feel anything, yet the heat of his kiss ignited something deep within her. When he bit her bottom lip, she gasped, givinghim the opening he sought.His kiss deepened, consuming her. His hands began to roam, their touch sending shivers down her spine. She wanted to resist, but her body betrayed her, responding to his évery move. It wasn't just about duty anymore. This was the man she had secretly admired, and now he was unraveling her completely.

Alexander moved with an intensity that left her breathless, his actions both calculated and overwhelming. He was relentless, and by the time he was done,she was utterly spent.

As sleep claimed her, one thought lingered: Was this just for the child,or was there something more?

The next morning, she awoke to find him lying beside her,his gaze fixed on her. Her heart skipped a beat. She quickly turned away, her cheeks flushing as memories of the night flooded her mind.

"I need to get to work," she muttered, trying to rise.

But Alexander's hand shot out, pulling her back. "You're not going anywhere," he said, his voice firm.

Lily's breath caught as he leaned in, his lips brushing her ear. "You'll stay here until I decide otherwise."

His words sent a shiver down her spine, and when she felt his hand begin to trace the curve of her waist, she knew the night's intensity was far from over.


And this time, she wasn't sure if she wanted him to stop.
###Chapter 10

Lily's hands shook as she spread the photos across the table. The images,though slightly grainy, carried a chilling clarity. A shadowy figure loomed in the background, his stance casual yet deliberate, the camera poised at the ready. Whoever had taken these photos hadn't been an innocent bystander; they had been watching, waiting, documenting.


"Look at the photos closely," Lily said, her voice tight with unease.She tapped on one of the images, pointing to the angle. "From this perspective,they weren't in the public park. They were across the street, somewhere hidden. This wasn't accidental."


Michael leaned forward, his brows furrowing as he examined the pictures.His lips pressed into a thin line, and the tension in his shoulders became visible. "You think someone was spying on you?"


"Not just me," Lily replied, her tone clipped as she began gathering the photos back into their folder. "This angle, this distance-it's not random.Someone planned this." She stood abruptly, grabbing her bag. "I need to check it out myself."

Michael rose quickly, stepping into her path and grabbing her arm. His grip was firm but not harsh, his eyes locking onto hers with an intensity that made her pause.

"Don't," he said, his voice steady and commanding.

She blinked up at him, startled. Michael rarely asserted himself like this,but theconcern in his gaze was unmistakable.

"Why not?" she challenged, her resolve faltering. He sighed, his grip softening but not releasing. "Going there will only bring back memories of that day. You've barely recovered as it is. Let me handle this."

His words struck a nerve, and Lily's shoulders slumped slightly. He was right-returning to the scene would be like tearing open a barely healed wound. The memories of that day, of losing her sisters so brutally, were still too raw.


"Fine," she relented after a long pause. "But promise me you'll keep me updated."

"I will," Michael assured her, finally letting go of her arm.

The tension in the room didn't dissipate as quickly as his grip, though. A silence settled between them, heavy with unspoken emotions. Michael's eyes remained on her, his expression unreadable, as if he was weighing whether to say something more.

Finally, he broke the silence. "Can I ask you something, Lily?"

She stilled, sensing the shift in his tone. "What is it?"


Michael hesitated,glancing briefly at Matthew, who sat quietly nearby but was listening intently. Then, as if deciding to press forward,he asked,"Why don't you live here anymore? Where did you move to... and why?"

The question hit her like a punch to the gut. She froze, her pulse quickening as the weight of his curiosity bore down on her. From the corner of her eye, she saw Matthew lift his head, his gaze sharpening. Though he hadn't voiced it, it was clear he shared Michael's curiosity. Lily swallowed hard,her mind racing for an answer. How could she possibly explain it? The truth-that she had entered into a contract marriage with Alexander Kane, a man as cold as he was enigmatic-was too complicated, too raw. They wouldn't understand. How could they,when she barely understood it herself?

"I..." she began, but the words caught in her throat.

Michael's eyes narrowed slightly, his patience wearing thin. "Lily,are you in trouble?" he asked, his voice softer now, tinged with concern.

Matthew leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees as he watched her intently. "It's not like you to be so evasive," he added. "If something's wrong,you know you can tell us."


Their concern only made the truth harder to bear. They didn't just want answers-they wanted to protect her. But this wasn't a situation they could shield her from.


"I moved for... personal reasons," she finally said, her voice barely above a whisper.


Michael frowned, clearly unsatisfied with her vague response. "Personal reasons? That's it? That's all you're giving us?"

Lily forced a weak smile, trying to lighten the tension. "Come on, Michael.Not everything in my life has to be an open book."

His frown deepened, but he didn't push further. Matthew, however, wasn't so easily deterred.


"Personal reasons don't explain why you've been so secretive lately," he said, his tone laced with suspicion. "You've been distant, Lily. More than usual. It's like you're hiding something." Lily's chest tightened, her resolve wavering under his scrutiny. Matthew's perceptiveness was both a blessing and a curse. He saw too much,read between lines she hadn't even written.


"I'm not hiding anything," she lied, her voice firmer this time. "I just needed a change of pace. That's all."

Matthew's gaze lingered on her for a moment longer, his eyes searching hers as if trying to uncover the truth she was so desperate to conceal.Finally,he leaned back in his chair, his expression unreadable.

"Fine," he said, though his tone suggested he wasn't entirely convinced.

Michael exchanged a glance with Matthew, then sighed. "If you ever need to talk..."


"I know," Lily interrupted, offering him a small smile. "And I appreciate it.Really."


The tension in the room eased slightly, but it didn't disappear entirely.The weight of unspoken truths hung in the air, a reminder that this conversation was far from over.


Lily took a deep breath and grabbed her coat, her movements brisk and purposeful. "I need to go," she said, her tone final. "I'll call you later."

Michael opened his mouth to protest, but the look she gave him silenced him.Matthew, meanwhile, simply watched her, his expression unreadable. As she stepped out into the cold night, the chill bit at her skin, but it was nothing compared to the icy fear gnawing at her insides. Her phone buzzed in her pocket, pulling her attention. She pulled it out,her breath catching as sheread the message displayed on the screen. "You can't run forever. Lily. We're always watching."

Her blood turned to ice, and her grip on the phone tightened until her knuckles turned white.


The shadows weren't just a memory of her past. They were alive,present,and closing in.


Lily climbed into her car, her hands trembling as she gripped the steering wheel. She stared out into the darkened street, her heart poundíng in her chest.


For the first time in a long while, she felt truly trapped.

And she wasn't sure she'd make it out unscathed.
###Chapter 11

Lily's voice cut through the quiet of the room like a blade. "I got married."

Michael and Matthew both froze as if time itself had stalled. The words hung in the air, heavy and unfathomable, like a thunderclap on a clear day.

"You did what?" MichaeI's voice finally broke the silence, sharp and incredulous. He looked as though someone had punched him.

Matthew's reaction wasn't any better. "Are you serious, Lily?" His normally calm demeanor fractured, his disbelief plain. “Married? When?To whom?”


Lily clenched her hands tightly, her knuckles turning white. She hadn't planned to drop this bombshell so abruptly, but there was no easy way to reveal the truth. "A few days ago," she said quietly, her words barely above a whisper.

Michael ran a hand through his hair, pacing the small space like a storm brewing on the horizon. "A few days ago?" he echoed. "Who in the world-”


“Alexander Kane," Lily said firmly, cutting him off.

The room went dead still. Matthew's head snapped toward her,his mouth slightly agape as if he hadn't heard right. Michael stopped pacing mid-step,his face blanching as the name sunk in. “Alexander Kane?” Matthew half-shouted, disbelief shaking his voice.“Alexander Kane? You mean the Alexander Kane? Lily, are you out of your mind?” "Yes,” Lily said, squaring her shoulders and meeting their stunned gazes.“ I married Alexander Kane."

Matthew collapsed into his chair as if the weight of her words had physically pushed him down. "Jesus Christ," he muttered, dragging a hand over his face."Alexander of all people..."

Michael stared at her, searching her expression for answers.“Why?"His voice was quieter now, no longer angry but deeply concerned.“Why him?Lily,what have you gotten yourself into?"

Lily hesitated, the truth resting heavily on her tongue.'It'scomplicated."she said finally, her voice faltering.

Matthew shot her a sharp look. "Complicated doesn't even begin to describe it. Do you know who he is, Lily? He's not just some businessman.He's ruthless-powerful beyond anything you can imagine. You married into a life of constant scrutiny and danger."

Michael stepped closer, his tone pleading now. "Lily, you can't trust him.Alexander Kane doesn't do anything without reason. What's his angle here? What does he want from you?”

She bit her lip, struggling to hold her composure. "It's a contract marriage."

"A contract?" Matthew blurted, his voicerising again. “You're telling me you married the most dangerous man in the city for some sort of deal?"

“I had no choice," Lily confessed, her voice low but firm. "It was the only way.” Michael stepped back as if her words had physically struck him. "The only way for what?" "To protect myself," Lily replied. "To keep my past buried and stay one step ahead of the people looking for me. Alexander can give me the protection I need."


“Protection?" Matthew exclaimed, disbelief still clouding his face.“Lily,you're playing with fire. If your grandfather finds out about this marriage,it's game over. He'll come for you, and Alexander Kane isn't the kind of man to let someone meddle with his affairs."


"I know," Lily admitted softly, "which is why you both have to help me.”She looked directly at Matthew. "I need you to make sure my family doesn't find me yet. I can't risk it. Not now.”

Matthew's expression darkened as he let out a slow breath.“Lily,your grandfather's reach is almost limitless. And now you're tangled with Alexander, whose influence might be just as dangerous."

"I know what I'm asking," Lily said, her voice steady but pleading.“But I have no other choice. Lucas, please. Just buy me more time."

Matthew pinched the bridge of his nose, clearly frustrated, but he nodded reluctantly. “Fine. I'll do what I can. But you're walking a razor's edge.Lily. One slip, and you'll lose everything."

Michael remained silent for a long time, his gaze fixed on her like he was trying to see through every layer of her defenses. Finally, he spoke. “Is this really what you want?"


Lily couldn't answer him. Instead, she turned away, her silence speaking louder than words. By the time Lily reached Alexander's mansion, the night had grown dark and heavy, the city's lights dimming against the horizon. The traffic had been unbearable, and it was nearly 10 p.m. when she pulled up to the estate. What she saw next stopped her in her tracks.

The staff-maids, security guards, and even Clara-were waiting outside in the cold, their expressions unreadable. The sight unsettled her, an inexplicable chill running down her spine.

"She's back," one of the maids whispered, and Clara quickly stepped forward, her relief palpable.

"Ma'am,you're finally home," Clara said, though her voice held something unspoken.

Lily frowned, confusion knitting her brows. "Why are you all standing out here? What's going on?"

Clara hesitated, glancing at the other staff before responding.“Mr.Alexander ordered us to wait outside until you returned.”

Lily's stomach dropped.“What?”

"Yes, ma'am,"one of the younger maids said timidly.“We've been waiting for hours."


“Enough," Clara snapped at the girl, clearly trying to contain the situation.She turned back to Lily, forcing a smile. "Please come inside. It's cold."

Lily didn't move. "Is this true, Clara?" Her voice was tight.


Clara avoided her gaze,"Now that you're back, everything is fine." The unease bubbling in Lily's chest only grew. She entered the house, her steps quick as she made her way upstairs. The mansion felt eerily quiet,as though it were holding its breath. When she opened the door to the bedroom, the emptiness struckher like a physical blow.

Alexander wasn't there. The bed was perfectly made, the room pristine,but something felt wrong. When she opened the closet, her unease turned into dread. Her clothes-her old, familiar belongings-were gone. In their place were pristine, luxurious garments that screamed wealth but felt like a stranger's wardrobe.

Panic swelled in her throat as she rifled through the clothes, tossing designer fabrics aside in search of her things. Her hands shook when she realized the scarf-her sister's scarf-was missing.

Storming into Alexander's study, Lily didn't knock. She threw the door open,her voice trembling with anger. "Where are my things?"

Alexander sat behind his desk, calm and composed as ever. He looked up at her,displeased by her interruption."How dare you barge into my office?”


"Where are my things?" she demanded again, ignoring his cold tone.“You had no right to move them."

His gaze darkened, his displeasure sharp enough to cut. He stood, closing the distance between them in two strides. Before she could react,he pinned her against the wall, his hands bracing on either side of her.

"This is my house, Lily," he said quietly, his voice deadly calm. "I can do whatever I please. Don't forget that,” Lily refused to flinch, meeting his eyes with defiance. "I don't care whose house this is. There's something important to me that you've taken." Alexander stared at her for a long moment, his expression unreadable.Then, he smirked faintly. "Important,you say?" "Yes," she hissed. her voice shaking with emotion. "Where is it?"

Alexander's gaze burned into her. "What's more important. Lily?"he murmured, his voice like silk laced with steel. "Your past... or your place in this house?”


Before she could answer, he leaned closer, his lips brushing against her ear.


"Be careful what you cling to," he whispered. "It might disappear before your eyes."


Her blood ran cold. As he stepped back, his words lingered like a curse,and for the first time. Lily wondered if Alexander Kane already knew far more than he let on.
###Chapter 12

The silence in Alexander's study was stifling, broken only by Lily's measured breathing as she tore her gaze from his. "Let me go," she demanded, her voice steady but laced with sharp tension.

Alexander didn't move. His grip on her arm was ironclad, his dark eyes boring into hers like twin blades, cold and unforgiving. The anger thathad colored his face moments ago dissolved, leaving an expression even more unsettling-one of complete detachment.

"I said let me go." Lily's voice was firmer this time,steel threaded through each word.


For a long, unbearable moment, he didn't react. Then, with a quiet exhale that hinted at frustration, he loosened his hold and stepped back. The air between them crackled with unspoken animosity as Lily turned abruptly.walking away without so much as a glance behind her.


Her pulse thundered in her ears as she strode through the mansion,rage simmering beneath her calm exterior. Alexander's audacity to remove her belongings-her memories-without so much as a warning felt like a violation she couldn't forgive. She would have her things back.


Lily's steps faltered as she intercepted Clara near the dining room. The housekeeper seemed startled, her usually composed demeanor tinged with guilt."Ma'am, do you need something? Shall I prepare dinner?" "No," Lily replied curtly, swallowing her anger as she fixed Clara with a hard stare. "Where did you put my belongings?"Clara hesitated, wringing her hands. "Mr. Kane ordered us to replace them with new items. Your things were... discarded,ma'am." "Discarded?" The word felt like a slap. Her stomach dropped. "Where?"

Clara hesitated. "The bins outside.But-"

Lily didn't wait for her to finish. Her blood ran cold as she turned sharply.determination tightening her spine. She ignored Clara's protests. ignored the growing chill that clung to her damp skin, and pushed through the massive front doors into the night.

The estate'sgrounds were vast, eerily silent beneath the dark sky. The soft glow of the mansion's lights offered little comfort as Lily made her way toward the bins near the staff quarters, her breath fogging in the cold air.

This is madness, she told herself. But she didn't stop. Couldn't stop.

Clara hurried after her. "Ma'am, please, let me help you! It's freezing out here!"


Lily ignored her, her hands trembing from the cold as she reached the first bin. Her fingers dug through discarded items-wrappers,broken utensils, torn packaging-each touch staining her skin. The humiliation burned like frostbite, but she kept going. Somewhere in this pile of carelessness were her scarves-her last tangible memories of her sisters.

Her fingers brushed against something soft. Lily froze. Heart pounding.she pulled it out: three scarves, worn and frayed at the edges, their faded patterns familiar and comforting. She held them to her chest, choking back a sob as the weight of the moment crashed over her. The memory of her sisters' smiles, their laughter on that final day,flickered through her mind like lightning. Those scarves were all she had left of them-symbols of a loss she had been forced to endure alone.Alexander had no right to take this from her. A chill ran down her spine. Slowly, she looked up, her instincts prickling.From the mansion's second-floor window. Alexander watched her.His silhouette was stark against the faint light of the study, unmoving,unreadable. He had seen everything.


For a moment, they stared at each other-her.broken and clutching the tattered pieces of her past; him, shrouded in shadows, observing her like a predator gauging his prey. The wind howled softly around her, and Lily's chest tightened.


Why is he watching me?

"Lily, come back inside. You're freezing!" Clara pleaded,her voice faint beneath the roar of Lily's thoughts.

Lily rose to her feet, swaying slightly as she hugged the scarves closer to her trembling body. Without a word, she turned back to the mansion,her mind a storm of emotions she couldn't contain.

Once inside, Clara reached for her, offering a blanket. "Please, ma'am, let me help you-"

"No." Lily cut her off, her voice barely above a whisper. "I'll handle this myself."


She ascended the grand staircase, her movements deliberate, her expression cold. She didn't head to the master bedroom but instead to the small guest room Alexander had first assigned her. Once inside, she locked the door,shutting out the world. Lily sank onto the edge of the bed, the scarves clutched to her chest as the tears she'd been holding back finally broke free. She didn't make a sound.She couldn't. The memories came rushing in-her sisters' faces, their warmth, their love, and the hollow void their deaths had left behind.

The hours dragged on, the house silent except for the faint creaks of the old walls. Outside, the wind beat against the windows, echoing the ache in her chest.

The next morning. Sarah arrived early at the coffee shop, only to find Lily already there, seated alone in the far corner. A scarf was wrapped tightly around her shoulders, her pale skin ashen against the dark fabric.

"Lily!" Sarah hurried to her side, alarmed. "What happened? You look-"

"I'm fine," Lily murmured, though her hollow eyes said otherwise.

Sarah touched her friend's hand and flinched at how icy it was. "You're freezing! What's going on? Did... did he hurt you?"

Lily shook her head, her voice barely audible. "It's not him. It's the memories."

Sarah's gaze dropped to the scarf Lily clung to. Understanding dawned,and her expression softened with concern. "What triggered them? What happened,Lily?"


Lily opened her mouth to respond, but before a word could escape, her body swayed. The room tilted violently, and she collapsed, unconscious.

"Lily!" Sarah shouted, catching her friend just before she hit the ground.Panic seized her as she checked Lily's pulse-weak, far too weak. Sarah's eyes darted toward the window, narrowing as she noticed movement outside. There-near the shop entrance-lingered two men pretending to read newspapers.Spies. Her instincts kicked in. She approached one of the men, her voice low and sharp. "Tell Alexander Kane that Miss Evans has collapsed. She needs a doctor,now.Go!"


The spy's surprise was brief; he nodded sharply and disappeared down the street.

Minutes later, the sound of tires screeching to a halt outside the coffee shop heralded Alexander's arrival. He burst through the door, his usual air of cool control fractured by the concern etched into his features.

Without a word, he crossed to Lily, scooping her frail form into his arms as if she weighed nothing. Sarah watched, stunned by the way his expression softened as he looked at Lily-protective,almost tender.

Alexander turned toward Sarah. "Which hospital?"

Sarah blinked. "The one nearby."

He didn't wait for more, carrying Lily out of the shop as though the world itself could not stop him.

Sarah stood frozen, the image of the enigmatic Alexander Kane holding her fragile friend lingering in her mind. For the first time, she realized Lily's connection to him was far deeper-and far more dangerous-than she had ever imagined.


And somewhere, deep inside her, a single chilling thought whispered: This is just the beginning.
###Chapter 13

The air inside the coffee shop was electric with tension as Sarah rushed back behind the counter. Her fingers trembled as she dialed Matthew's number,the weight of urgency pressing down on her like a stone. The line clicked, and Matthew's voice answered casually, though there was a thread of unease beneath his tone.

"Hey, Sarah. What's going on?”

"Matthew, it's Lily-she's been taken to the hospital. I don't know which one. Can you find her?" The words tumbled from her lips, sharp with panic.


There was a pause, then a shift in Matthew's voice-casual concern replaced by sharp alarm. “What happened?”

Before Sarah could respond, Michael's voice cut through the line, his tone edged with anxiety. "What do you mean she's in the hospital?”The sound of Matthew putting the phone on speaker made Sarah's pulse spike.

"She collapsed, Michael,” Sarah said, her frustration rising with her fear.“She showed up here shivering, clearly unwell. Then she fainted before I could do anything. I called her husband, and he took her. I-I didn't have time to follow them."


"Damn it, Sarah! How could younot find out where?" Michael snapped,his anger barely restrained. “You think I didn't try?" Sarah shot back, her voice rising. "He carried her out before I could even move." "Stop it, both of you," Matthew interrupted sharply, his calm precision cutting through the argument. "This isn't helping. We have bigger problems-hospitals use fingerprint ID systems. If anyone accesses her information, they'll start asking questions about who she is."

"Then block the system! 'That's your job, isn't it?" Sarah's tone was ice.

Matthew exhaled, already focused. "I'm on it. But don't shout at me unless you want me to stop."

"Find her. Matthew. Fast," Sarah demanded, her voice low and hard.


"I'll handle it," Matthew promised, typing furiously in the background.Moments passed in silence, each second heavier than the last. Finally, his voice returned. "Brightside Hospital. VIP Ward. Sending you the address now.”


Sarah snatched up her coat the moment the message came through.muttering.“You two stay out of this. If Alexander sees either of you near Lily,it'll make things worse."

Michael grumbled in protest, but Matthew cut him off. “She's right.
Alexander is already suspicious of us. Let Sarah handle this."

"Fine," Michael relented begrudgingly.

Without another word, Sarah stormed out of the coffee shop, the cold wind biting at her as she hailed a cab. As the city blurred past the window,her thoughts raced. Please let her be okay. The VIP wing of Brightside Hospital was unnervingly quiet when Sarah arrived. The scent of antiseptic lingered in the air and the hushed voices of nurses added to thesterile tension. She spotted Alexander instantly. He sat in a chair near Lily's room, his shoulders rigid, his gaze fixed on the closed door. Sarah paused, her pulse quickening. She had only ever heard of Alexander Kane-his cold reputation, his calculated ruthlessness. Seeing him in person was another thing entirely. His presence seemed to fill the hallway,dark and unyielding.


Before she could move, a doctor emerged from Lily's room. Alexander rose to his feet in one fluid motion, his expression tense, though his voice remained deceptively calm.

"How is she?”


“She's stable," the doctor said, removing his glasses and tucking them into his pocket. "It was a minor cold, compounded by exhaustion and exposure.
If you want her to maintain a healthy pregnancy, this cannot happen again. She needs rest and warmnth.”


Alexander's jaw twitched. “Noted."

The doctor gave him a knowing look. “You care about her more than you let on,you know."


“Enough,” Alexander snapped, though there was a flicker of something-guilt?-in his dark eyes.

The doctor said nothing more, retreating downthe hall. Alexander turned back toward the room, his hand hovering near the door handle, but he didn't enter. He stood there, staring at the door, the hesitation uncharacteristic of a man like him. Inside the private hospital room, Lily's eyelids fluttered open,her head pounding. She blinked against the harsh light overhead, disoriented by the sight of medical machines and the quiet hum of the monitors. A soft hand pressed against her shoulder as she tried to sit up. "Stay still. Lily," Sarah's familiar voice said gently.

"Sarah?" Lily croaked, confusion clouding her expression. "Where am I?”

"You're at Brightside Hospital. You collapsed,remember?"


The memories returned in fragments-her frantic search for the scarves,the cold, her body giving up as the world spun. "How long have I been here?”


"A few hours," Sarah replied softly. "Alexander brought you here."

Lily's eyes widened slightly."He did?”

"Yes,” Sarah said. “You're in a VIP ward."

Lily turned her head, taking in the luxurious surroundings.“A VIP room...
"Her voice trailed off, disbelief flickering across her face.


"You scared me, Lily. What happened?" Sarah pressed,her concern evident.


Lily hesitated, then finally explained everything-the scarves, the search.the emotions that overwhelmed her. By the end, Sarah's jaw was tight with anger.


“I'll have words with him," she vowed.Before Lily could respond, the door creaked open. Grandma Helen stepped inside, her presence commanding as always. Her eyes softened when they landed on Lily, though her tone remained firm. “Oh,my dear.How are you feeling?" “Grandma?" Lily blinked in surprise."How did you know I was here?" "I hear everything." Grandma Helen said dismissively, her voice tinged with disapproval. "That grandson of mine has been careless, and he will answer for it."


"Grandma, it's not a big deal-"

"Nonsense," Helen interrupted. “You need rest, and I won't have you staying here under his roof." She turned to Sarah, noticing her for the first time."And who is this?"


"I'm Sarah, a friend of Lily's," she said politely.

“Good," Helen nodded approvingly. “It's nice to know she has someone looking out for her." She turned back to Lily. “You're coming home with me after you're discharged. No arguments.”

Lily sighed,too tired to protest.


******

Meanwhile, in a towering office building downtown, Alexander sat at the head of a conference table, his expression unreadable as his executives pitched a rural development project. The silence stretched unbearably as he tapped his fingers rhythmically against the polished wood, the sound echoing like a ticking clock.

Finally, Alexander stopped, his voice cold and final. "Start over." With that, he rose, leaving stunned silence in his wake. James followed close behind as Alexander strode through the hallway, his steps quick and decisive."Any update on the hospital?" Alexander asked, his voice tight. James hesitated. "Miss Evans has been discharged. sir."

“Where did shego?" Alexander stopped walking. his gaze sharp as it pinned James in place.

"Wel. about that..." James shifted nervously. "Grandma Helen took her back to the family house."


The air seemed to crackle with tension. Alexander's grip tightened on his phone, his knuckles white.

"Return her." His voice dropped to a low growl, icy and final."Now.Grandma."
###Chapter 14

“Bring her back. Grandma."

Alexander's voice was ice, his words sharp enough to cut through steel. He stood by the towering windows of his office, the city lights shimmering like distant stars, but his focus was singular.


"No, Alexander." Grandma Helen's reply was calm but unyielding,laced with a subtle defiance. “She'll return in a few days. Right now, she needs peace and rest. wwhich she will not find under your roof."

His grp on the phone tightened, his knuckles whitening. “I said no.Send her back to my house now."

Grandma Helen's laugh was soft but deliberate, a subtle mockery of his demand. "You can command the world, my dear boy, but you cannot command me. Lilly stays with me."

The line went dead before he could respond.

Beep.

For a moment, the silence in the office was deafening. Then Alexander's jaw tightened, his frustration spilling over as he slammed the phone down on his desk. He turned toward James, his assistant, who stood frozen like a rabbit caught in the headlights. "Why wasn't I informed sooner?" Alexander's voice was dangerously low,but the fury beneath it was palpable. James stammered, his face pale. "I-I apologize, boss. I thought-” "No bonuses. For a year," Alexander interrupted, his tone like frost. James staggered under the weight of the punishment, his shoulders slumping in despair. A wave of whispers swept through the office hallways as employees overheard the declaration. Sympathy flickered in some eyes, but most turned away quickly, not daring to draw Alexander's attention.

Inside his office, Alexander's mind churned. His grandmother's audacity wasn't just a power play-it was a direct challenge. She knew him too well,knew exactly how to push his buttons. But what infuriated him most was that Lilly was now beyond his reach, her movements unknown,her vulnerability exposed.

On the road to the Alexander family mansion, Grandma Helen ended the call with a victorious smirk. She had outmaneuvered her grandson, at least for now.

Her gaze softened as she glanced at Lilly, who stirred on the leather seat beside her. Still groggy, Lilly blinked at the unfamiliar surrounadings,her brow furrowing.

"Where are we?" she murmured,her voice faint.

"We're going to the Alexander family estate," Grandma Helen said,her tone as soothing as a lullaby.“You'll stay with me for a few days. Rest is what you need, dear, and I intend to make sure you get it."

“But-”Lilly started,but Grandma Helen silenced her with a gentle pat on the hand. "No buts. Trust me, this is for the best." Lilly's gaze dropped to the scarves clutched in her lap, her fingers running over the soft fabric. Her mind drifted back to her sisters,the memories
  bittersweet.

"They meant a lot to you, didn't they?" Grandma Helen asked, her voice unusually tender.


"They're all I have left of them," Lilly whispered, her voice thick with emotion.


Grandma Helen nodded, her expression thoughtful. “And they'll remind you of your strength,too."

The Alexander mansion loomed in the distance, its grandeur intimidating even in the pale moonlight. When they arrived, the sprawling estate exuded an air of untouchable legacy. It wasn't just a home-it was an empire carved in stone and time.

Camila, the head housekeeper, greeted them at the door. "Welcome home,Ma'am. And welcome,Miss Lilly."

"Thank you, Camila. Show Lilly to her room and make sure she has everything she needs," Grandma Helen instructed.

Lilly followed Camila through the grand hallways,her footsteps muffled by the plush rugs. When they reached her room, she froze at the sight. The room wasn't just luxurious-it was familiar. Masculine details dominated the decor: deep mahogany furniture, muted tones, and shelves lined with books. “This.,. this was Alexander's room," Lilly said softly, her eyes sweeping over the space. "Yes, Miss," Camila confirmed.“Grandma Helen thought it would make you feel closer to him.” Lilly hesitated, her emotions a tumultuous storm. As she ran her fingers over the spines of the books, she tried to imagine a younger Alexander inhabiting this space. The thought sent an unexpected pang through her chest.


After a long bath, she rested until Camila returned to escort her to dinner.The meal was extravagant, with Grandma Helen ensuring Lilly sampled every dish. But the tension in Lilly's chest didn't fade, even as they strolled through the moonlit gardens afterward.

"It's so peaceful here," Lilly admitted,her voice soft.

Grandma Helen smiled knowingly. “Peace is a rare thing in our family, my dear. Cherish it while you can."


As they settled on a terrace overlooking the estate, Grandma Helen turned to Lilly,her expression serious.

"You'll meet Sandra soon," she began.

Lilly frowned.“Sandra?”

“Alexander's sister. She's studying abroad right now, but she's always been close to him."


The revelation surprised Lilly. "He's never mentioned her." Grandma Helen sighed, her gaze distant. "He's a man of secrets, that one.But there's more to him than what you've seen. This marriage may have started as a contract, but I see potential for something real." Lilly's heart ached at the truth in those words. She wanted to believethere was a chance, but Alexander's walls were formidable, his trust elusive. "Don't give up on him," Grandma Helen added softly."Sometimes,the strongest walls are built around the most fragile hearts."

At ONYX Corporation, Alexander sat in his office, the city sprawling below him like a chessboard, waiting for his next move.

"Repeat that," he demanded, his voice razor-sharp.

James swallowed hard. "The chauffeur reported that Grandma Helen refused to return Miss Evans until tomorrow evening.”

Alexander's eyes darkened, his fury simmering just beneath the surface.“Three days. She'll have her for three days."

James nodded hesitantly.

Alexander leaned back in his chair, the leather creaking under his weight.“What about the maid? The one feeding information to my grandmother?”

“We've identified her," James confirmed.

“Bring her to me.Now.”

Minutes later, Jackie, the chief bodyguard, dragged a trembling young woman into the office. She collapsed to her knees, herpleas spilling out in desperate sobs.
 
“Young mnaster, please, I had no choice! She forced me!" Alexander regarded her coldly, his silence more terrifying than any words.Finally, he leaned forward, his gaze locking onto hers. "You want forgiveness?" His voice was low, lethal. "You'll earn it. Go back to the mansion. Watch Miss Evans. Report to me if she even steps outside." The maid nodded frantically, her relief evident."Yes. young master. P'll do as you say."

Alexander dismissed her with a flick of his hand, his thoughts already elsewhere. This wasn't just about control-it was about understanding the pieces on the board.

Grandma Helen had made her move. Now it was his turn.


And he intended to win.
###Chapter 15

Earlier that morning. Lilly had risen before the sun. a quiet determination lighting herface. The idea had struck her during her conversation with Grandma Helen the previous night-an opportunity to express her gratitude and form a bond.


The mansion's kitchen buzzed with activity as the chef and Camila busied themselves, gathering the ingredients Lilly needed. She stood at the counter.sleeves rolled up, her focuis razor-sharp as she prepared Grandma Helen's favorite meal: a spread of vegetable salad, fish soup, rice, and a variety of side dishes.


"Are you sure you don't want us to handle this, Miss?" the chef asked.watching her wield the knife with surprising precision.

Lilly shook her head with a small smile. "No, thankyou. I want this to come from me."


The aroma of the meal filled the air, wafting through the halls and drawing curious glances from passing staff.

By the time she set the table, Grandma Helen walked into the dining area.her expression softening as her eyes landed on the carefully arranged dishes.


"Wow, you've been busy," Grandma Helen said, her surprise obvious. Lilly pulled out a chair for her. "Come, Grandma. It's your favorite. I hope I did it justice." Grandma Helen sat and took a tentative bite. Her eyes widened slightly,and then she smiled. "This is... remarkable. You made this?" Lilly nodded, watching her intently. "With the chef's help,of course."

"It's better than his cooking," Grandma Helen teased, her words loud enough for the chef to hear.


The poor man stiffened where he stood, a mixture of offense and despair flickering across his face.


Lilly chuckled, attempting to soothe the moment. "The meal yesterday was amazing. You're an excellent chef."


The chef nodded mutely, retreating with a hasty bow, and Grandma Helen laughed lightly.


They were mid-meal when Camila approached quietly and leaned down to whisper something in Grandma Helen's ear. The older woman's demeanor shifted slightly, her smile tightening.

"Excuse me, dear. I'll be back shortly," she said, rising from her seat.

Lilly nodded, watching her leave. She ate slowly, her thoughts wandering as soft murmurs echoed faintly from the hall. Minutes passed before Grandma Helen returned, her face calm but her movements brisk.

Lilly glanced toward the doorway where faint footsteps faded. Someone had come...and gone. After the meal, Grandma Helen led Lilly to a small art studio tucked away in the mansion. The scent of paint and varnish hung in the air, and the walls were adorned with breathtaking landscapes, many of them mountains. "You're so talented, Grandma!" Lilly exclaimed,awed as she watched the older woman's brush glide effortlessly across the canvas. The scene was
alive a mountain bathed in soft golden light. each detail painstakingly perfect.

Grandma Helen chuckled softly, her focus unwavering. "It's juast a hobby.dear.Nothing extraordinary."

Lilly shook her head."This is extraordinary. What mountain is it?"

"A place I visit for prayers," Grandma Helen replied, her tone thoughtful."It's special to me."


Lilly detected a subtle sadness in her words, an undercurrent of emotion she didn't quite understand.


"Can I join you the next time you go?" Lilly asked suddenly, surprising herself as much as Grandma Helen.


The older woman paused mid-stroke, her brush hovering over the canvas.She turned to Lilly, her expression unreadable. “Are you sure? It's not exactly a thrilling outing for someone your age."

"Thrilling isn't the point." Lilly replied, her voice soft but firm.“Sometimes.it's good to pray... especially for those we've lost."

Her chest tightened as the memory of her sisters surfaced, vivid and painful.She gripped the fabric of her dress to steady herself.

Grandma Helen's eyes softened, her gaze flickering to the scarves Lilly so often clung to. "The ones who owned those scarves?" Lilly blinked,startled. She hadn't realized how much Grandma Helen had observed. Slowly, she nodded, her voice barely above a whisper. "Yes." Grandma Helen didn't press further. Instead, she stood gracefully,her movements fluid as she gestured toward the door."You should rest. We'll be going out later, and I want you to come with me."

“Out?Where?"


"Shopping." Grandma Helen said with a smile,her mood brightening."It's been ages since I've gone, and I think it's time to spoil ourselves."

Lilly hesitated, but seeing the genuine excitement in the older woman's expression, she nodded. “Okay, Grandma."


The car pulled away from the estate later that afternoon, a sleek convoy with bodyguards trailing closely behind.

Grandma Helen sighed as she looked out the window. "My grandson is so overprotective. Look at this-guards for a simple shopping trip!"

Lilly smiled faintly, her mind flashing back to her grandfather. He had been just as vigilant, sending a small army of guards whenever she and her sisters ventured out. The memory was both comforting and bittersweet.

The car stopped in front of the most opulent mall Lily had ever seen. Its grand facade gleamed in the sunlight, and above the entrance, bold letters spelled out “ONYX Mall." She didn't need anyone to tell her it was part of the Kane family's empire.

As they stepped out of the car, all eyes turned toward them. The crowd parted instinctively, murmurs spreading as people speculated about their identities. The presence of the guards only heightened my curiosity. Some pulled out their phones, but the guards quickly intervened, ensuring no photos were taken. A man in a tailored suit hurried toward them, flanked by a group of shopping assistants. His demeanor was respectful yet eager as he bowed deeply.

"Mrs. Kane," he said, his voice reverent. "It's an honor to have you here.It's been such a long time since your last visit."


Grandma Helen smiled graciously, but her eyes gleamed with a sharpness that didn't escape Lilly's notice. “Let's hope the service here hasn't declined in my absence."

"Of course not, Ma'am. We'll ensure you have everything you need," the manager said quickly, gesturing for the assistants to follow them.


As they stepped inside, the weight of the moment pressed against Lilly's chest. The mall was a glittering showcase of wealth and power, but beneath its surface,something felt... off.

She couldn't shake the feeling that someone was watching them, and the faint echo of footsteps trailed just a second too long behind.

The shopping trip had begun, but Lilly couldn't ignore the creeping sense of unease curling at the edges of her mind. Something or someone was waiting.
###Chapter 16

"Mmm.I would only need two shopping assistants since I'm not buying much; the rest can leave." Grandma Helen ordered,her voice calm yet authoritative.


The manager complied instantly, dismissing the additional staff and focusing solely on Mrs. Kane. However, his sharp eyes couldn't help but linger on the striking young lady accompanying her-a vision of understated elegance. Though her demeanor hinted at privilege,her identity eluded him, which was unusual for someone skilled at recognizing influential faces.


The shopping trip stretched on, with stops at several high-end stores.Gradually, Lilly noticed the items being selected weren't solely for Grandma Helen. By the third store, it became obvious: Grandma Helen was shopping for her as well.

"Grandma,you don't need to go to all this trouble for me," Lilly said softly.holding back her unease.

"Nonsense," Grandma Helen replied with a wave of her hand."You deserve it. After that delicious meal and your promise to join me in the mountains, this is the least I can do." Lilly smiled faintly but couldn't shake her discomfort. Later, when she excused herself to "use the restroom," her true purpose unfolded. She had spotted a jewelry store nearby and wanted to find a gift for Grandma Helen-something special to show her gratitude. Inside the jewelry store, her eyes wwere drawn to a stunning collection: a necklace, earrings, and bracelets that radiated timeless elegance. "How much for the set?" she asked.

"Altogether, it's $100,000," the salesperson replied.unfazed.

Lilly hesitated only briefly before reaching into her purse. Pulling out her black card. she placed it on the counter. She could feel the salesperson's gaze on her, shock evident in their widened eyes. It was rare to see such a card-reserved for the wealthiest elite worldwide.


"Is everything alright?" Lilly asked casually, though she already knew what had caused the reaction.


"Yes, ma'am, of course," the salesperson stammered, quickly processing the payment.


Lilly left the store with the gift carefully wrapped, her heart lighter. But the sense of peace didn't last. Her steps faltered when she saw someone walking toward the jewelry shop with two others. Her breath caught.


“Kate?”she whispered, panic seizing her. No. She's supposed to be in Europe!


Lilly turned sharply, pulling the hood of her coat higher over her head as she quickened her pace.


Kate, engrossed in conversation, suddenly paused. Something about the woman leaving the jewelry store struck her as familiar. The walk,the slight tilt of her head-it tugged at buried memories. "Amelia?"she whispered, her voicelow with disbelief. "Kate?"one of her friends asked, puzzled, as Kate stopped dead in her tracks. Kate didn't respond. Instead,she broke into a sprint. her gaze locked on the retreating figure.


Lilly's heart pounded as she weaved through the mall. her mind racing.She knew Kate well enough to sense the moment she was spotted. Her phone buzzed in her hand-Grandma Helen's name lighting up the screen but she silenced the call.

She ducked into another aisle, her eyes scanning for a clear path. The mall felt endless; its brightly lit stores were a maze she couldn't escape fast enough. The sound of hurried footsteps behind her scent a fresh wave of panic coursing through her veins.

Kate's eyes darted through the crowd, her mind warring between certainty and doubt. “It can't be her," she muttered under her breath. But the closer she got. the stronger her conviction grew.

“Amelia!"she called. her voice cracking.

Lilly flinched but didn't turn around. Instead, she darted into another corridor, slipping into the shadow of a pillar as Kate ran past,her gaze frantically scanning the throngs of shoppers.

By the time Kate slowed to a halt, she was breathless. Her chest heaved as her eyes swept the crowd again, but the figure she had been chasing was gone.

Her heart sank, her mind reeling. Was it her sister she'd just seen? Or had her imagination played a cruel trick on her? "Kate,what's wrong?" one of her friends finally caught up to her, placing a hand on her shoulder. Kate shook her head slowly, her gaze still searching the crowd."I thought I saw her," she murmured, her voice hollow.

“Who?”

"Amelia." Kate whispered, her throat tightening. "But.,, she's gone now."

For a moment, she stood frozen, torn between relief and despair. Could it have been a mistake? Or was the past she thought she had buried now rising to the surface?
###Chapter 17

Kate's heart was racing as she drove through the familiar streets toward the Blake family estate. The image of the woman she had seen at the mall wouldn't leave her mind. Every detail-her walk, her hair, the way she carried herself-screamed of her long-lost sister, Lilly.


Arriving at the imposing Blake mansion. Kate parked her luxury car hastily, nearly forgetting to shut the door. The grandeur of the estate.surrounded by lush greenery and guarded gates, was a stark reminder of the weight of her family's name and the power they wielded in Aurora City.


The head maid. Emily, greeted her at the entrance. "You're back early,Miss Kate."


"Where's my mother?" Kate asked, barely stopping.

"In the garden, Miss," Emily replied, watching curiously as Kate strode past without another word.


Kate reached the garden, finding Lady Bella pruning roses with a calm precision that belied the storm brewing in her daughter's chest.

"Mother!" Kate called her voice tight with urgency.

Lady Bella turned, arching a brow. "You're back so soon. What happened?  Kate glanced over her shoulder,ensuring no one was close enough to overhear.′′Weneed to talk. Alone," With a wave of her hand, Lady Bella dismissed the nearby maids."What is it, Kate?" she asked, her voice low, sensing the tension in her daughter. Kate stepped closer, her voice trembling with suppressed emotion. "I think I saw her, Mother. Lilly. At the mall."

Lady Bella froze, the pruning shears slipping slightly in her hand."Lilly?"she repeated,her tone sharp.


"Yes. I saw someone who looked exactly like her walking out of a jewelry store. I wasn't sure at first, but the way she walked, the side profile-it was her," Kate insisted.her voice rising.


Lady Bella's expression darkened, her mind racing. "Are you certain? It's been months, Kate. No one has seen or heard anything about her. The search turned up nothing."


"I'm not entirely sure," Kate admitted reluctantly, "but I know what I saw.We need to confirm it. I need you topull the CCTV footage from the mall."

Lady Bella frowned. "That's not our family's mall, Kate. I don't have direct access."


"Didn't you say the manager is an old friend? Call him. Make something up. I need to know if it was her," Kate pleaded.

Lady Bella hesitated, but the desperation in Kate's eyes pushed her into action. "Alright. I'll see what I can do."

Kate grabbed her mother's hand tightly. "Thank you. You know we can't let her reappear now. Not after everything we've done." Lady Bella nodded, her lips pressing into a thin line. "We won't let that happen. She wwon't ruin what we've worked so hard for." As Lady Bella made the call to her contact at the mall. Kate paced the garden, her mind consumed with possibilities, If it was Lilly, why had she resurfaced now? What had she been doing all these months? And more importantly, what did she know?


Meanwhile, in a sleek black car speeding through Aurora City, Lilly was typing furiously on her phone.

Lilly: I think Kate saw me.

Matthew responded first.

Matthew,Are you sure?

Lilly: She chased me through the mall. If she didn't suspect something.she wouldn't have done that.

Michael chimed in.

Michael: That's not good.

Lilly: I need you to handle it. Delete any footage from the mall's security system. She can't confirm it was me.

Matthew: You mean to hack into the Kane family mall's system?

Lilly: Yes. Do whatever it takes. They can't know I'm alive. Not yet.

Matthew with a thumbs-up emoji, followed by a smirking face.

Michael: You're playing with fire, Lilly. If they figure it out, they won't sit still. Lilly: Then I'll be ready. But until then, make sure theycan't trace me. Lilly smiled faintly at her screen before glancing out the window. Her moment of calm shattered when she realized Alexander,sitting beside her,had been silently watching her.

"Something amusing?" he asked, his tone neutral but his eyes piercing.

Caught off guard. Lilly quickly locked her phone. "Nothing important."

Alexander's gaze lingered on her for a moment before his phone rang. He answered without breaking eye contact.

"Grandma," he said, his voice softening slightly.

"I heard you took Lily from the mall," Grandma Helen said sharply. "I told you I'd bring her back tomorrow evening!"

Alexander's jaw tightened, but he said nothing.

"I bought things for her, and she got something for me too.Send your driver to pick them up. And Alexander," Grandma Helen's voice grew stern, "if you mistreat that girl, you'll regret it. She's my granddaughter-in-law, and even if your marriage doesn't last, she'll always be part of this family. Treat her well."

The call ended abruptly,leaving Alexander staring at his phone in silence.


Lilly glanced at him, wondering what was going through his mind.But his expression remained cold as ever.


***************Back at the Blake mansion, Lady Bella sat by the phone, tapping her manicured nails against the table as she waited for her contact to send the footage. Kate paced the room, her anxiety growing by the second. "What's taking so long?" "Patience," Bella said sharply.

When her phone finally pinged. Bella opened the files immediately.Together, they scrutinized the grainy footage of the jewelry store entrance.

Kate leaned closer to the screen, her breath hitchingas she spotted a figure in a simple yet elegant dress. Her heart pounded as she recognized the familiar profile.


"It's her." Kate whispered, her voice trembling with equal parts fury and disbelief.


Bella's lips thinned into a calculating smile. "So, she's back."

Kate's fists clenched at her sides. "She thinks she can return after all these years and disrupt everything. She has no idea what's waiting for her."

But as they continued to watch, the footage abruptly cut off, leaving the screen blank.


"What happened?" Kate demanded.

Bella's contact called a moment later, his voice apologetic. "The footage was wiped clean. Someone hacked into the system."

Kate's face twisted in frustration, her suspicions growing deeper. "She's smarter than we thought. But it doesn't matter. She can't hide forever."

Her gaze hardened, determination etched into her features. "If Lilly is back,I'll make sure she regrets it." Kate grasped her mother's hand tightly, her eyes burning with determination."Thanks, MIother. You know what's at stake. We can't let this opportunity slip away. We need to finish what we started." Bella nodded solemnly. "Yes. We need to.

Kate wasn't just any Blake-she was the iHlegitimate daughter of Bella.born from an affair with Daniel Blake while he was still married to Lifly's mother. Bella had fought to secure her place in the family,clawing her way to the top after Selina. Daniel's wife, had died. Despite the lingering whispers of society calling Bella a gold digger and Kate an illegitimate child,they had managed to carve out their position. But there was always one thing left undone-taking full control of the Blake family legacy. And Lilly's sudden reappearance could ruin everything.


**********


When the car finally pulled into the mansion, Lilly moved to get out,but Alexander's voice stopped her.


"Leave the gift," he said, his tone sharp. "It will be taken to my grandmother. You won't be going to the family house again."

Lilly froze her hand on the door handle. Her heart skipped a beat at the finality in his words. She dropped the gift onto the seat without another word and stepped out of the car.


But as the door closed behind her. Alexander's eyes drifted to the package.and curiosity flashed across his face. With a slow, deliberate motion,he picked it up. A small brow quirked as he examined it-an expensive jewel set. His eyes narrowed.

"Who paid for this?" he murmured under his breath, his mind already working.

Reaching for his phone, he dialed his assistant. "Yes,boss?" "Didn't I tell you to report any transactions made with the card I gave her?"he asked, his voice low with suspicion.

"Yes, sir, but there haven't been any transactions on her card."

Alexander paused, his grip tightening on the phone. "What do you mean there haven't been any transactions?"

The silence on the other end was palpable, and then the assistant's voice came back, uneasy. "I'm checking it now, sir. But there's no record of any purchases."


Alexander's jaw clenched. He looked at the expensive jewel in his hand and the growing suspicion in his gut. "Then whose money did she use to buy this?"


Lilly Evans was becoming more and more of a mystery with each passing day.
###Chapter 18

Bella paced anxiously around the grand living room, her heart pounding in her chest as she anxiously awaited the manager's call. The minutes dragged on endlessly, each tick of the clock sharpening her nerves. Kate.equally restless. sat on the edge of the couch, her fingers twitching as if to do something-anything-to push the time forward. She was desperate for answers, her mind racing with countless possibilities.

Finally. Bella's phone rang, cutting through the silence. Bella snatched it up immediately. Her voice was tight with expectation as she answered.

The call was brief, but it hit like a blow to the gut. Bella's face paled as she listened, her grip tightening around the phone until her knuckles turned white.


"What did he say?” Kate demanded, her eyes burning with impatience.

Bella's lips curled into a thin, forced smile as she ended the call, the weight of the news pressing heavily on her chest. “The footage... it's been deleted," she said. her voice almost a whisper.

Kate froze, her eyes wide in disbelief. “What? That's impossible. They're supposed to preserve it! How could it just disappear?"

Bella's eyes narrowed as she fought to keep her composure."It's gone.Kate. But don't worry... we still have ways to find out the truth."

Kate stood up, her face tight with frustration. "What doyou mean,'ways?"Her voice was sharp, filled with a desperate edge. "Tell me. I need to know. If that was really Lilly... I need to know. This can't be happening right now." Bella reached out and took her daughter's hand, squeezing it reassuringly."I have my methods. And if that girl dates to reappeat or make herself known again. I'll make sure she disappears once more-permanently.

"But Grandfather..." Kate hesitated. the words hanging in the aif like a heavy fog. "Grandfather is looking for her too. What if he finds her first?

Bella's expression darkened, her grip tightening."We will handle this.Kate. Before he does. Don't worry about him."

Kate's breath escaped in a shaky sigh. "All I want is to finally get what's mine...all that belongs to me."


Bella smiled coldly, pulling her daughter into a tight embrace. "And you will, darling. You'll have everything. When your father returns, we'll push forward. You'll join the family business, and one day, you'll be the one to lead the Blake legacy."


Kate's lips parted in a slow smile. "I can't wait, Mother."

Meanwhile. Lilly's life was anything but peaceful. After a long day,she slipped into her room, the soft hum of the mansion around her, and her mind weighed down with a million thoughts. As she undressed,her phone rang-Grandma Helen's name flashing across the screen.

Lilly answered quickly, her voice soft but warm. "Hello,Grandma."

"Oh, my dear," Grandma Helen's voice was full of affection."I received your gift.It's lovely, such a fine piece of jewelry. You've made me so happy.” "I'm so glad you like it, Grandma," Lilly said, smiling at the thought of her grandmother's reaction. There was a pause, and then Grandma Helen's tone shifted slightly."I hope my grandson gave you enough funds for it, dear. You didn't go overboard,did you?"

Lilly hesitated, then lied smoothly, "Of course. Grandma. He gave me more than enough. You don't have to worry about a thing."

"Good,good. I'm glad to hear it. Now, rest well, my dear. I'll see you soon...and we'll have more time together, I promise."

Lilly smiled softly at her grandmother's words. "Thank you, Grandma.I can't wait.”"


The call ended, and Lilly sat there, the warmth of the conversation still lingering. But before she could fully settle into the quiet, there was a soft knock at the door.


Opening it,she was greeted by Clara and two maids, all holding packages in their hands.


"What's all this?" Lilly asked, eyeing the gifts.

"These are from Mrs. Kane. Ma'am,” Clara explained. “Your belongings.and some additional gifts she selected for you.”


Lilly nodded and stepped aside to let them in. The maids carefully placed the packages on the couch, then bowed and left. Once the door closed, Lilly walked over and began unwrapping the items.She recognized a few things from her time with Grandma Helen during the shopping trip, but there were many other items she hadn't been present for. Each one seemed more extravagant than the last, and she couldn't help but feel a knot tighten in her stomach. As she pondered the significance of these gifts, her phone buzzed again. It was Sarah, checking in on the coffee shop. Lilly replied, her thoughts distracted by everything happening around her. With Alexander becoming more controlling by the day, she needed to make sure her business back in the city didn't fall apart.

Later that evening, Lilly descended the stairs for dinner, only to find Alexander still seated at the table. His presence was commanding, even in his quiet reading of the newspaper. She sat down next to him, but couldn't help stealing glances at him, her mind a swirl of conflicting emotions.

He noticed her gaze."What's wrong?”

Lilly quickly averted her eyes, flustered. “Nothing," she muttered.

"Sure about that?" he teased, his voice low and unsettling.

The meal passed in strained silence. Every bite, every movement felt deliberate, measured. But still, Lilly couldn't help but observe him, the way his fingers moved with such precision as he ate. The tension was palpable, and Lilly was caught at the moment, unsure of what to make of it.


After dinner, Alexander retreated to his study, leaving her behind. But Lilly lingered. She needed answers. As the house felt unusually still, she wandered the halls, confusion gnawing at her.

Finally, she approached Clara. "Where is everyone? Why is it so quiet today?” Clara glanced at her, a flicker of something unreadable in her eyes. "Today is a mandatory day off, Ma'am. Mr. Kane's orders." Lilly blinked in confusion. "A day off? I didn't know..." Clara seemed almost reluctant as she added. "Mr. Kane instructed me to send you to the family home today. Ma'am. It's time for you to go."

Lilly froze, her heart pounding. The family home? Alexander had explicitly told her she would never set foot there again. Why the sudden change?

"What's going on?" she whispered to herself.

Clara's face remained impassive. "The car is waiting for you outside."

Lilly's mind raced. This didn't feel right. The whole situation felt off. As she stood there, staring out the window, a shiver of unease crept down her spine.


Something was happening, something she couldn't quite understand yet.And she knew-deep down-that today would mark the beginning of something far more dangerous than she ever imagined.

The question lingered in her mind as she prepared to leave: What was Alexander planning?
###Chapter 19

Clara let out a heavy sigh, a flicker of unease crossing her face as she realized Alexander hadn't briefed her on the significance of today. This lack of knowledge would make her arrival at the family estate awkward and suspicious.

“Ma'am, today marks the anniversary of Alessandro Kane's passing,Alexander's father," Clara finally revealed, her voice tinged with hesitation.

Lilly blinked, the words sinking in with a sharp jolt. She frowned,bewilderment flicking across her face. Alexander hadn't mentioned this to her during the five days she'd been away. A bitter laugh escaped her lips before she could stop it. Why would he share something personal like this?Of course,he hadn't.

“Yes, ma'am. MIr. Kane must have overlooked telling you." Clara glanced away, a hint of discomfort glinting in her eyes as she carefully chose not to address Alexander's decision to send Lilly to the family estate without disclosing such an important detail.

“You said a driver is waiting outside?” Lilly asked a flicker of curiosity now intertwining with her confusion.

“Yes,ma'am.” Without waiting for further input, Lilly walked past Clara, her heels clicking softly on the floor. The cool night air greeted her as she stepped outside. The chauffeurstood respectfully by the car, a Stoic figure with unreadable eyes. Clara's voice stopped her one more time."Ma'am, you should change your clothes first. A memorial like this requires proper attire." Lilly glanced at her simple, casual dress, realizing that her attire was far too informal for such an occasion. She nodded silently and quickly turned back into the house.


She changed into a sleek, black, fitted dress that hugged her figure just right and fell gracefully below her knees. Paired with black heels and a tidy ponytail, she looked polished but solemn. She took a breath,steeling herself for whatever lay ahead.


Together, she and Clara finally headed to the family estate. The car ride was quiet, theair in the vehicle thick with an unspoken tension. The estate's grandeur loomed larger with every passing mile. As they approached a distant section of the property, Lilly spotted the shrine in the distance,guarded by stern figures standing tall.

The car stopped, and Lilly got out, the gravel path crunching softly beneath her heels. She entered the shrine, removing her shoes as a sense of reverence settled over her. Inside, she saw Grandma Helen kneeling before the portrait of Alessandro Kane, a woman of quiet resilience. The sight stirred something in Lilly-a mix of curiosity and compassion.


She quietly lit incense, bowing three times before the portrait before settling beside Grandma Helen, who was still deep in silent prayer. The atmosphere in the shrine felt sacred yet suffocating.

She glanced around the room and noticed that only the two of them were present. Sandra was away in Europe, but where was Alexander? Hle had arranged for her to come here-so why wasn't he standing alongside her? A chill ran down her spine as she closed her eyes and clasped her hands,praying for Alexander's father. But soon, her thoughts drifted to her sisters.and tears began to stream down her cheeks. After an hour, the prayers ended. Lilly stood alongside Grandma Helen.their heads bowed, a heavy sadness hanging between them. But Grandma Helen's eyes met Lilly's with a frailty that shook her resolve.


"This is the first time someone joined me for my son's memorial since Sandra left for Europe." Grandma Helen finally spoke, her voice barely a whisper.


Lilly looked up in surprise. "Are you saying that...?”

“Yes.”Grandma Helen's eyes glistened with unshed tears.

She took a trembling breath. "Why hasn't Alexander come to his father's memorial?”


Grandma Helen wiped a tear from her cheek, the lines on her face deepening with the weight of past sorrows. “Since Alessandro's death.Alexander has avoided this place. The shrine-it brings him too much pain.”


"How so?" Lilly's voice was barely audible.

Grandma Helen met her gaze with a deep, sorrowful look."His mother...she's the first person to cause his agony. She was a terrible wife and a terrible mother. Her infidelity led to Alessandro's death. Alexander found her with another man. In his grief and rage, Alessandro drove recklessly,leading to his fatal accident." Lilly's breath caught in her throat as the words hit her like a shockwave.The gravity of Grandma Helen's story settled over her, a painful revelation that made her own eyes fill with tears. "I'm so sorry for everything that happened," Lilly said softly, reaching out to embrace Grandma Helen. Grandma Helen looked up, her eyes searching Lilly's face with a vulnerable trust. "You're not like his mother, and I believe you won't make the same mistake. But if you want this marriage to endure beyond one year and five months, you'll need to show Alexander you're different.Truly different."


She paused, the intensity of her words sinking in.66It5Ss not about money.or status, or power. It's about something deeper. Loyalty.Commitment.Love.”"


After a long, quiet moment, they laid flowers and burned incense at Alessandro Kane's grave and that of Nicholas Kane, Alexander's recently departed grandfather. But there was still no sign of Alexander's mother.The absence of a grave made Lilly wonder if she was still alive and, if so.why Alexander kept her hidden from the family.

She glanced around the tombs, a sense of mystery gnawing at her.

Returning home to an eerily empty house, Lilly tried to process everything she had learned. The revelationabout Alexander's mother and the deep emotional wounds it caused him stirred memories of her strained relationship with her father.


She went upstairs, the exhaustion of the day settling into her bones. After a long, hot bath, she lay down in bed, every nerve on edge.

Suddenly, a sound-a soft creak-shattered the silence. Her eyes flew open,her heart pounding in her chest. The guards were supposed to be outside.She was alone except for the guards beyond the house walls. She cautiously stepped out of bed, every shadow in the room now a potential threat. The door opened slowly. In the dim hallway light. Alexander stumbled in.disheveled, his face flushed with alcohol. The stench of whiskey clung to him.


He leaned heavily on the doorframe, his eyes glassy but still filled with an unsettling intensity.


Lilly rushed to steady him as he swayed, his towering presence disoriented but no less formidable.


“Alexander,what's going on? You've been drinking?" she asked, a mix of fear and confusion in her voice.


He pulled her into a wobbly embrace, his breath hot against her ear."Shhh... let's just... sleep," he muttered, barely coherent.

She tried to push him away, every instinct telling her this was dangerous.


But his grip tightened, and in his embrace, Lilly felt the precarious boundary between love and dominance blur.

She looked into his eyes, determined to find something-anything-that might give her insight into Alexander's true self.


Her thoughts swirled into questions that would remain unanswered.Why was he here? What would happen if he woke up sober? The answers were slipping through her fingers, but one thing was clear:whatever she thought she knew about Alexander, about love, loyalty,and trust-it was all about to change. With the night closing in and Alexander's presence overwhelming, Lilly felt a chill settle in her chest.Once she was sure he was asleep, she carefully extricated herself from his grip and helped him change into more comfortable clothing. She felt a flush at the sight of him, wondering how he could fit inside her.

After cleaning him up, she lay down on the other side of the bed, turned off the light, and settled in. Before long, he turned towards her and pulled her into his arms, holding her close as he slept peacefully.

When he awoke and saw them in this intimate position, things would surely become complicated.


She knew one thing-this was just the beginning.
###Chapter 20

Lilly woke up to the sharp scent of cologne mingling with the lingering traces of alcohol. Her eyes fluttered open, and she found herself face-to-face with a storm-an irate Alexander Kane, his intense gaze fixed on her like a blade ready to strike.

"Good mor-"


"Save it," he growled, cutting her off with a venomous edge. His voice was tight and controlled, but his eyes burned with fury. "Let last night be the first and last time you change my clothes. Understand?"


Lilly's pulse quickened. She wasn't sure what shocked her more: his anger or the inexplicable tension curling between them. She was caught off-guard,her words stumbling out. unfiltered. "It wouldn't have happened if you hadn't come home drunk, Mr. Kane."


"Don't push me." His jaw clenched, and he turned toward the door,but Lilly, her hand trembling slightly, reached out to grab his arm.

He froze, his sharp gaze flicking down to where her fingers had curled around his sleeve."What is it?" His voice was low, almost dangerous.

"Alexander, I..." Her breath caught in her throat, unsure of how to make him understand. "I just want to say... I'm here for you. Even if our marriage is temporary, if you need to talk, I'm here. You don't have to bottle everything up and drown it in alcohol."

His eyes narrowed unreadable, dark pools that made her feel as if she were standing at the edge of a precipice. He didn't move for a moment, the silence suffocating. Then, with a sharp exhale, he pulled his arm away and gave her a cold, final look. "I've been warned," he muttered, his voice as sharp as a knife, before turning and walking out without another word.

Lilly remained rooted in place, her heart thundering in her chest. She felt the sharp sting of his rejection-familiar, yet so much more intense than anything she'd experienced before. She was left alone, the air thick with unanswered questions and a growing ache for the man she couldn't quite understand.


***************

By the time Lilly arrived at the coffee shop later that morning, she was barely able to mask the storm of emotions swirling inside her. Sarah noticed her tense posture immediately.


"Good morning, stranger!" Sarah called out, her voice warm, but Lilly could hear the concern beneath it.

"Look who's here!" Sarah exclaimed, hustling over to Lilly and leading her into the storeroom where she was about to change. "You didn't call yesterday.What happened?"

Lilly exhaled slowly, her mind still reeling from the morning's events. "I'm sorry. I had to go to the Kane family residence."


"Really?" Sarah raised an eyebrow. "I thought he said you'd never go there.What changed?"


Lilly's expression hardened as she recalled the solemn day. "It was his father's anniversary of death. He sent me to be with his grandmother...and I found out something I wasn't expecting."

Sarah's curiosity was piqued. "What did you find out?"

Lilly hesitated, then spoke in a low, measured voice, as if still processing everything. "Hlis mother... she was unfaithful. It led to his father's death.Alexander found them together, and his father died in a reckless accident afterward."


Sarah's face went pale. Her lips parted, but no words came out at first.Finally, she gasped, "Oh my god... With a mother like that, no wonder he's wary of women."

Lilly nodded, the weight of the revelation heavy on her chest. "I hope he changes," she whispered, though her voice lacked conviction.

The two of them remained in silence for a moment before Lilly's stomach turned uncomfortably. The smell of coffee, usually her favorite scent, now made her feel queasy. She rushed to the restroom, her head spinning.


Once inside, she barely made it to the sink before she doubled over, her body rejecting everything she had eaten that morning. Her hands trembled as she wiped her mouth, staring at her pale reflection in the mirror.

Something was wrong.


Sarah knocked gently on the door, concern lacing her voice. "What's wrong?"


"I think I'm pregnant," Lilly saíd, her voice barely above a whisper,the words sinking into her like a weight she couldn't escape.

"Are you sure?" Sarah's voice was tentative.

Lilly's heart raced as she mentally calculated her period. It was late. "I was supposed to get my period yesterday, and now I'm throwing up."

Without another word, Sarah rushed out, returning with a test strip. Lilly used it, her hands shaking. The seconds stretched into an eternity before the two lines appeared.

"So?" Sarah asked her voice tight with anticipation.

Lilly looked down at the strip and felt her stomach twist. "I'm pregnant."


Sarah didn't hesitate. She rushed forward and enveloped Lilly in a tight hug."Congratulations!" she said, her voice warm and excited,but Lilly could only nod numbly.


The news felt like a double-edged sword-joy and fear swirling inside her,both equally overwhelming. Would Alexander push her away now that she was pregnant? The thought made her heart ache with uncertainty.

Later,Lilly arrives at the Kane family residence, her mind still reeling from the pregnancy revelation. Camila greeted her warmly, leading her to Grandma Helen, who was sitting in the upstairs living room, flipping through a photo album.

"Grandma," Lilly greeted, her voice soft with respect.

Grandma Helen smiled and gestured for her to sit."I've been going through some old photos. Would you like to see pictures of Alexander when he was younger?"

 
Lilly smiled, her curiosity piqued. "Yes, I'd lovre to." The two women spent the next hour flipping through the pages,laughing at the innocent, carefree photos of Alexander as a child. But Lilly couldn't ignore the shift that occurred when they reached the photos from when he was fourteen. That was the age his father had died, and Lilly could see the unmistakable change in his expression-a loss so deep it was still etched in his features. Grandma Helen's voice brought her back to the present. "Really? You're pregnant?" Her eyes lit up with genuine joy, and for a moment. Lilly felt a warmth that she hadn't expected.

"Yes," Lilly said, her heart heavy with the weight of her newvs. "But I still need to confirm it with a doctor."


"I'm so happy for you, dear. I can't wait to be a great-grandmother,"Grandma Helen said, enveloping Lilly in a hug.


Lilly felt a strange pang of uncertainty. "He knows?" she asked, her voice soft.


"I'll tell him when you get home," Grandma Helen assured her.

Lilly nodded, but something gnawed at her. She didn't know what would happen next-only Alexander could decide whether she would stay in his life after their contract ended. That thought hung over her as she reluctantly left, accepting the chauffeur's offer for safety.

At home, Lilly was greeted by Clara and another maid. "Thank you, Clara."

"Would you like something to eat, ma'am?" Clara asked, her tone polite.but Lilly's mind was elsewhere.

"No, I've already eaten," Lilly murmured. "I'll retire for the night."

"Good night,ma'am." She used the elevator to avoid the stairs, her steps heavy as she approached the bedroom. The door creaked open, and there he was-Alexander, seated on the edge of the bed, his gaze icy,his presence suffocating. "Why did you go to the family house?" His voice was cold.cutting through the silence like a blade.

Lilly's heart raced. "To visit Grandma and see how she's doing."

"I don't recall giving you permission."

Lilly's pulse quickened, but she stood her ground. "Didn't,know I needed to ask."


His face darkened, and she could feel the tension crackling between them."Just because I sent you there yesterday doesn't mean you can go whenever you want. You are not to develop any relationship with my family.When our one-year and six months are up, you're out. Understand?"

Her chest tightened, but she forced herself to remain calm. "You've made that clear.But my relationship with your grandmother has nothing to do with our arrangement. I care for her."


Lilly turned to leave for her room, but he blocked the door with a single step. "Where do you think you're going?"

"To my former room."

"No,you're not. Not until you're pregnant."


Her breath hitched. "I am pregnant."

His eyes darkened, and the words he spoke next held a dangerous weight.
"Why didn't you tell me?" The room fell silent, the tension unbearable. Lilly swallowed,trying to steady herself."Ijust found out today." "Can I go now?"


Alexander's gaze flicked to the suitcase in her hand. He didn't move, but his silence was like a trap closing in.


Lilly took a step forward, but then his hand shot out,gripping her wrist with a force that sent a shock through her body.


"What are you doing?" she asked, her voice trembling.

"Don't leave."


The words echoed in the silence of the room, and Lilly stood frozen,the weight of his touch grounding her in place. Was this a warning-or something else entirely?
###Chapter 21

Had she heard him right? Lilly's breath caught in her throat, her heart hammering in disbelief. Alexander Kane, the man who rarely revealed a crack in his icy exterior, had just said thie unthinkable.

"Don't leave," he had said.


The words hung in the air like a storm cloud, ominous and laden with meaning. She blinked, her voice faltering as she tried to confirm what she thought she'd heard. "What did you say?"

Alexander's expression didn't soften. His gaze was a fortress, locked down and impenetrable. "Have you been to the hospital?" he asked instead,his tone cold and detached.

Lilly shook her head."No."

His jaw clenched slightly, a flicker of emotion breaking through the calm facade. "Put that luggage down," he ordered, his voice steely. "You're not leaving this room until a doctor confirms you're pregnant."

And with that, he walked out, leaving her standing there in stunned silence.

The room felt suffocating in his absence. Did he not trust her? Did he believe she'd lie about something as monumental as this? Lilly's hands gripped the handle of her suitcase tightly. Her emotions were a tempest-confusion, anger, and hurt swirling together in achaotic storm.
****************
The next morning, Lilly woke up with renewed resolve. Alexander might control many things, but he wouldn't dictate her every move. Dressing for work, she chose a sleek gray fitted shirt dress. It was modest yet stylish.stopping just above her knees. The touch of small heels completed her look-confident and professional, a statement of her independence.

She descended the staircase, expecting the quiet hum of her usual morning routine. Instead, she was met with tension so thick it could choke the air.

Alexander sat at the breakfast table, documents spread before him, his eyes scanning them with a laser focus. His presence dominated the room, but it was the man standing beside him-James, his assistant-that caught her attention. The poor man looked as though he might pass out from fear.

Lilly hesitated,suddenly aware of the charged atmosphere. Maybe she should grab a bite at work instead.


"Sit down," Alexander's voice cut through her thoughts like a whip.

She froze mid-step, unsure if she'd even been noticed. Slowly,she obeyed.taking a seat opposite him. The maids brought her breakfast-eggs,toast,and juice-but the air remained heavy.

For ten minutes, Alexander didn't acknowledge her presence, his attention locked on his documents. James shifted nervously, every small movement betraying his discomfort. Lilly couldn't stand the oppressive silence.

"James," she whispered, offering a small smile. "Breathe."

James gave her a shaky nod, his pale complexion doing little to ease her concern. But her moment of kindness drew Alexander's attention. He glanced up,his eyes cold as steel. "You better eat your breakfast and mind your own business," he said, his voice cutting through the room like a blade."And once you're done, go upstairs and change into something more appropriate. Lilly blinked, taken aback. "Excuse me?"

Alexander's gaze dropped briefly to her dress, then back to her face. "You heard me."


Lilly glanced down at her outfit. The gray dress was elegant, professional.and one of the expensive pieces Alexander had bought for her. There was nothing inappropriate about it.


"Mr. Kane," she began. carefully controlling her tone, "this is one of the clothes you purchased for me. There's nothing wrong with it."

Instead of addressing her, Alexander turned his anger on James, who looked as if he might faint. "Why were such clothes included in the purchase?"


James stammered, his words barely audible. "Sir, you instructed me to take a female employee with a similar body type to shop for MIs. Evans' clothes.She selected everything. I only carried the items."

"Fire her." Alexander ordered sharply, his tone like ice.

"Sir,I-"


"Immediately," Alexander snapped, silencing any protest. Lilly's jaw tightened, her sympathy for the unknown employee mixing with her mounting frustration. The dress might be shorter than Alexander preferred, but firing someone over it was absurd. The sound of documents slamming onto the table jolted her from her thoughts. Alexander leaned back in his chair, glaring at James. "Take these away and have them redone. I want them on my desk by the time I arrive at the office."


James grabbed the papers and fled the room without another word,leaving Lilly and Alexander alone in the thick, suffocating silence.

"Didn't I tell you to change that dress?" Alexander said. his gaze now fixed on her.


Lilly met his eyes, her frustration bubbling over. "Mr. Kane, there's nothing wrong with this dress, and firing someone who was only following orders is unreasonable."


His jaw tightened. "As long as you're in my house and carrying my child,you won't wear whatever you please."


His words were a match to dry tinder. "Didn't you say you need confirmation before believing I'm pregnant?" she snapped, her anger boiling to the surface.


"Yes," he replied coolly. "Which is why we're going to the hospital as soon as you change that dress."


Her heart pounded, anger fueling her defiance. "No one knows I'm your wife, or that I might be carrying your child. So why are you so bothered by what I wear?"


Alexander leaned forward, his eyes burning into hers. "Because I said so." His tone was final, his gaze searing, but Lilly refused to back down. "Fine," she spat, standing abruptly. Her chair scraped loudly against the floor,echoing her frustration.′′I′Il change. But this is ridiculous." She stormed out of the room, her heels clicking angrily against the floor.

Alexander watched her go, his expression unreadable. The fire in her eyes had sparked something in him-something he couldn't quite place. But one thing was certain: Lilly Evans was no ordinary woman.

As the door slammed shut behind her. Alexander leaned back in his chair,his thoughts swirling. This wasn't just about the dress. It was about control-a control that seemed to be slipping through his fingers with every step Lilly took.
###Chapter 22

Lilly sighed. exhausted by the constant battle of wills with Alexander. If she wanted to leave the house today, there was no point in dragging this out further. Standing up. she made her way to the elevator. her frustration simmering just beneath the surface.

In her room, she chose a loose red dress that brushed just above her knees,its flowing fabric both modest and elegant. She paired it with dark,low-heeled shoes and slung a black bag over her shoulder. Letting her long.blonde hair cascade down her back, she cast one last look in the mirror.She looked radiant, poised-ready for whatever storm awaited.

When she returned downstairs, a maid informed her that Alexander was waiting in the car. She braced herself as she stepped outside. The moment she slid into the passenger seat, his piercing gaze swept over her. It was brief, but the tension was palpable. He gave a subtle nod of approval.though his silence spoke volumes.


They arrived at Highland Hospital, its sterile halls buzzing with activity.The elevator ride to the Obstetrics and Gynecology department was thick with unspoken words. Lilly glanced at Alexander, his stoic expression betraying none of his thoughts.


The door to Dr. Richard's office opened, and he greeted her with a warm hug. "Nice to see you again, Ms. Evans."


Lilly returned the gesture with a polite smile. "Same here." Richard studied her for a moment, his gaze curious. "You look... different." "Mm-hmm," Lilly replied, keeping her tone light. "So," Richard turned toward Alexander, his curiosity piqued, "what's the good news? You were rather cryptic when you called."

Alexander,sitting on the couch with his legs crossed, didn't bother to respond. His silence was a wall.

Lilly,tired of the games, took the lead. "I'm pregnant," she announced,her voice steady.


Richard's face lit up with genuine excitement. "Wow! Congratulations to you both!" He hugged Lilly again, his enthusiasm infectious. "The man of steel is going to be a father. Who would've thought?"

"Thank you," Lilly said softly, glancing at Alexander. His eyes were on her,sharp and calculatinng, as though searching for cracks in her calm demeanor.


"I'll have one of the female doctors run all the necessary tests and bring me the results," Alexander interjected, his tone clipped and authoritative.

"Of course," Richard replied, undeterred by Alexander's brusqueness. "Come on, Lilly. Let me introduce you to the doctor who'll be taking care of you throughout your pregnancy."

Dr. Elena's office was warm and inviting, a stark contrast to the tension Lilly had been carrying. As they entered, Elena ended a phone call and turned toward them with a bright smile.

"Hey, Richard," she greeted, giving him a quick peck on the lips. Lilly's eyebrows lifted slightly. The gesture didn't escape her notice.
"And who is this?" Elena asked, her gaze landing on Lilly with a mix of curiosity and admiration.
"Alexander's wife, Lilly Evans," Richard introduced smoothly.

Elena's smile widened as she crossed the room to take Lilly's hands. "I'm so pleased to finally meet you. Richard has told me a lot about you."

"Nice to meet you too," Lilly replied warmly.

"Elena is not just a doctor," Richard added with a proud smile. "She's also my girlfriend."


Lilly's lips curved into a knowing smile. "I had a feeling. You make a lovely couple."

"Thank you," Elena said, her cheeks flushing slightly. "I hope we can be friends too, apart from me being your doctor."

"Of course," Lilly agreed, lking Elena's easygoing nature.

Just as they were settling in, Elena received an emergency call. Apologizing,she promised to return shortly and left in a hurry.

As they waited, Richard leaned back, his demeanor relaxed. "So, Lilly, tell me about yourself. Alexander never shares anything personal."

Lilly hesitated briefly but decided to share a sanitized version of her past."I grew up an orphan, mostly alone. I own a small coffee shop now, and I only completed high school," she said, glossing over the finer details of her life. Richard raised an eyebrow. "You carry yourself with a grace and confidence that suggests otherwise. You could easily pass for someone with a prestigious education." Lilly smiled faintly. In truth, she held two master's degrees, but this wasn't the moment to reveal her secrets.

"And there's something... unique about you," Richard added, studying her closely. "You have an aura, like someone born into privilege."

"That's thanks to hard work," she replied smoothly.


Richard chuckled, clearly impressed. But Lilly wasn't done probing. "Since you're one of Alexander's closest friends, I assume you know about his father's memorial two days ago?"

"Yes," Richard said, his expression darkening slightly.

"HIe wasn't there. His grandmother told me why," Lilly said cautiously.

Richard's shoulders tensed. "He never attends. The memories are too painful."


"Was his mother there?" Lilly asked, testing the waters.

"She's deadto him," Richard replied curtly.

The finality in his tone hinted at deep scars, but Lilly wasn't ready to let it go. "Is it true that his mother was the reason for his father's death?"

"That's what everyone believes," Richard admitted, his voice quieter now.

"But there's more, isn't there?" Lilly pressed, her intuition sharpening.

Richard's gaze met hers, a flicker of something dark crossing his features. He leaned forward, his voice dropping to a near-whisper. "Yes. Nine years ago, Alexander gave love a chance." Lilly's breath hitched. The weight of those words settled over her, heavy and foreboding. Before she could ask more, a shadow seemed to pass over Richard's face, his expression unreadable.
###Chapter 23

"Are you saying Alexander once loved someone?" Lilly's voice was low.steady,yet tinged with disbelief.

Richard nodded, his expression darkening.(4)YeS,and she became the second reason he shut himself off from relationships. First, it was his mother. Then,it was...her."

Lilly leaned forward, her curiosity piqued.“Her?”

Richard's gaze grew distant as though he were reliving memories he would rather forget. "She was the woman he loved when he was 21. Back then, he was just a young man with big dreams, building his company from scratch. They met in college. Alexander gave love a chance, truly believing in it. He cared for her deeply, perhaps too deeply. But she betrayed him. And then, karma struck swiftly."

"Karma?" Lilly echoed, her intrigue deepening. “What do you mean by that?”


Richard hesitated, his jaw tightening before he spoke. "She fled with someone else. Took everything she could from him. But fate...fate had other plans. The private jet she escaped on? It crashed."

Lilly's breath hitched, the weight of his words settling over her like a heavy cloud. "So that's why he's like this," she murmured. Richard nodded gravely,"It's why he harbors such bitterness toward women. Why he vowed never to marry-until his grandfather's will forced his hand." The ride back home was a blur for Lilly. Her mind replayed Richard's words, trying to piece together the fragments of Alexander's past. Could that betrayal still haunt him after all these years?

At the hospital, the tests confirmed she was three weeks pregnant.Alexander, as expected, was swift and firm in his decisions.“You'll stop working until after the baby is born," he announced curtly, barely allowing her a moment to protest.

By the time she returned home, her thoughts had only deepened.She called Sarah to inform her about the work hiatus and reached out to Matthew and Michael to check on their investigation. Both assured her that progress was being made, with significant findings expected soon.

Later that afternoon, Lilly was startled awake by a knock on her door.Groggily, she got up and opened it to find Clara and a guard standing outside, thelatter carrying two large boxes.

"What's this?" Lilly asked, stepping aside to let them in.

“The boss sent these for you," Clara replied.

“And what's inside?"

"Luxury items," the guard explained without offering further details.

After they left, Lilly examnined the contents. Inside the boxes were meticulously chosen items: a pair of elegant heels, a limited-edition purse,and a stunning silver gown that shimmered under the light. The craftsmanship spoke of extravagance. Her phone buzzed, and Alexander's name flashed on the screen. “I assume you've seen the dress and other items," he said without preamble. "Be ready by 7 PM. The chauffeur will pick you up." "Where are we going?" Lilly asked, her tone wary.

"You'll see," hereplied before hanging up.


By 6:30 PM, Lilly was dressed in the silver gown, her makeup light yet flawless,her long hair cascading down her back. When Clara informed her that the chauffeur had arrived, she headed outside, where a luxury Bentley Mulsanne awaited her.


The drive was quiet, the city's lights casting fleeting shadows across her face."Where are we going, Frank?" she asked the chauffeur, trying to ease her unease.


“To Kane's 10-star hotel, ma'am,” he replied, his voice neutral.


The answer only heightened her curiosity-and her apprehension.

The hotel was breathtaking, every detail exuding opulence. As they parked in the underground garage, two bodyguards escorted Lilly to an exclusive restaurant within the hotel. She felt her heart race as she entered. The ambiance was luxuious, every detail curated for the elite.

At a table in the far corner sat Alexander. He glanced up from his phone.his expression as unreadable as ever. As Lilly approached, she felt the weight of countless eyes on her. She had always been confident, but here,surrounded by the most powerful and wealthy individuals in the country,she felt an unusual nervousness. Alexander stood as she reached the table and pulled out a chair for her.“It suits you," he said simply, his gaze lingering on her. "Why are we here?" she asked, trying to suppress the tension in her voice. "Look around," he replied, gesturing subtly. Lilly glanced around and noticed people whispering and sneaking glances in their direction. "I see people watching us. Is that why you brought me here?"


Before Alexander could answer, a waiter arrived, and they placed their orders.


As they ate, Lilly couldn't shake the feeling that Alexander was watching her more than usual. When she finally looked up, she caught hs intense gaze.


"Is there something on my face?" she asked, touching her cheek self-consciously.


For a moment, she thought she heard a soft chuckle-low and almost imperceptible. But when she looked again, Alexander's face was as impassive as ever.

She sighed, returning her attention to her food. Yet unease clung to her,gnawing at her resolve. She glanced around the room, her eyes darting over the crowd. Everyone seemed absorbed in their own conversations,yet she couldn't shake the sense that something was amiss.

"What is it?" Alexander's voice cut through her thoughts.

Lilly hesitated, unsure how to explain.“Can we...leave?"

Alexander studied her, his piercing gaze searching hers for an answer."Why do you want to leave?” Before she could respond, a voice broke through the hum of the restaurant,freezing her in place.
 
 “Lilly.” Her blood ran cold. That voice-she knew it. Slowly. almost unwillingly.she turned.


"Albert?" Her voice was barely above a whisper, her hands gripping the table as her world threatened to tilt.
###Chapter 24

The world is vast, but moments like this make it feel suffocatingly small.

"Albent?" Lilly's voice was barely audible, her heart racing as she faced the man from her past.

"Lilly, it's really you." Albert said with a charming smile: his eyes alight with recognition.


"What are you doing here?" she asked, her voice steady despite the storm brewing inside her.


Albert leaned in slightly, his tone casual but tinged with amusement."Wondering why I'm here? I came to expand the family business and hoped to cross paths with you."


Lilly blinked, startled by the bluntness of his response. Their paths had diverged three years ago when she ended their brief relationship abroad.She had thought she'd left that part of her life behind.


"Oh," was all she could manage, though she could feel the intensity of Alexander's gaze burning into her. Against her better judgment, she glanced his way and regretted it instantly. Hisface was a mask of fury,his jaw clenched in barely restrained anger.


Albert followed her gaze, his expression shifting as he noticed the man sitting across from her. Recognition dawned, and his smile faltered."Alexander Kane," he muttered, just loud enough for her to hear. Albert extended a hand with calculated politeness. "Mr. Kane,it's an honor. I'm Albert Smith." Alexander's cold stare didn't waver, and he made no move to shake Albert's hand. The awkward silence that followed was suffocating.Albert,reading the situation quickly, withdrew his hand. Few men dared appronch Alexander Kane without facing consequences,and Albert had just realized the risk he had taken.

Lilly's mind raced, panic bubbling under her composed exterior.She prayed Albert wouldn't dig deeper. During their time together abroad,she had been "Lilly Evans," a false identity she and her sister adopted to escape the scrutiny tied to their real surname, Blake. The truth had been buried beneath layers of secrecy, and she had every intention of keeping it that way.


Albert's attention shifted back to Lilly, his gaze softening. "Let's catch up sometime," he said, offering her his business card.

Lilly hesitated but accepted it, knowing she might need to control the situation if he pursued her. Albert seemed to notice Alexander's unyielding glare, the air around them thick with unspoken tension. With a polite nod, he excused himself.

Once Albert was gone, silence settled over the table, oppressive and heavy.Alexander's piercing gaze remained locked on her, and Lilly fet as though she were being dissected under his scrutiny.

Finally,Alexander stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor.“Stand up," he commanded, his tone icy.

"What?" Lilly stammered, startled by his sudden movement. “Stand.Up.” She obeyed without question, her pulse quickening. Without another word,he grabbed her hand, his grip firm as he pulled her along. "Why are you dragging me?" she asked, struggling to keep up with his long strides.

"You wanted to leave. We're leaving," he said curtly, his tone brooking no argument.


"Do you have to drag me?"

He didn't answer, his focus fixed straight ahead. They reached the ground floor in a blur, and Lilly noticed how everyone avoided even glancing their way. Alexander Kane commanded fear and respect wherever he went, and this moment was no exception.


In the underground garage, Lilly yanked her hand free, her voice rising."Let go of me!"

Alexander stopped abruptly, turning to face her. His eyes blazed with an intensity that made her take a step back. "Get in the car," he ordered, his tone cold as ice.


She hesitated, but the sharp edge in his voice left no room for debate.Reluctantly, she climbed into the car, Alexander following close behind.


As the vehicle sped away, the silence inside was suffocating. Lilly stared out the window, her heart pounding.


"Hand it over," Alexander said suddenly, breaking the quiet.

“What?” “His contact details.” Lilly turned to him, confused. "Why do you want it?" “Don't make me repeat myself," he warned, his voice low and dangerous. With trembling fingers, Lilly pulled the business card from her clutch and handed it to him. Alexander barely glanced at it before rolling down the window and tossing it into the night.


"What was that for?" Lilly demanded, her voice rising in disbelief.

"How do you know him?" Alexander asked, his tone sharp.

“That's not an answer to my question," she shot back,frustration bubbling to the surface.


“Don't test my patience,Lilly.”

She hesitated,realizing how precarious her position was. "He's... an old friend.”


Alexander's eyes narrowed. "An old friend? This is his first time in the country. How did you know him before now?”

Lilly's heart sank. He knew. Of course, he knew. Alexander Kane never moved without gathering information first. The realization hit her like a wave-he must have had Albert investigated the moment he left the table.

"The thing is..." Lilly began, struggling to find the right words.

"Lilly Evans," Alexander interrupted, his voice dangerously low.“Start talking.” Her throat went dry. She was trapped, and she knew it. She couldn't reveal the truth about her past without risking everything. But lying to Alexander Kane was just as perilous. Every second of silence felt like an eternity. She met his gaze, his cold eyes demanding answers, and knew there was no escape. “I...”Her voice faltered, the weight of his stare crushing her resolve.

She had never felt so exposed, so vulnerable. How could she untangle this web without it unraveling everything she had worked so hard to keep hidden?


The car sped through the darkened streets, but Lilly could only hear the pounding of her own heart. The truth loomed over her, threatening to shatter everything she'd built.
###Chapter 25

It she lied, he would uncover it. If she told the whole truth, everything she had carefully hidden would unravel. The only path left was the treacherous middle ground.


Lilly swallowed hard and said. "He's not just a friend. He wasm my former lover."


The tension in the car snapped like a taut wire. Alexander's expression darkened immediately. "Pull over."

The driver obeyed without question, bringing the car to a halt on an isolated road. The escort vehicles following behind stopped as well. Both the driver and James, Alexander's right-hand man, exited the car silently and climbed into one of the other vehicles, leaving the two of them alone.

Lilly's pulse quickened. The abrupt stop, the oppressive silence-something about the situation felt dangerously volatile. "Why are we stopping?" she asked, her voice trembling.

Alexander's gaze bore into her."When you say he was your ex, do you mean he was your boyfriend?"

"Yes,"she admitted.

“And how," Alexander asked coldly, "could you have had a relationship with him if this is his first time in Country A?" Lilly hesitated, the weight of his question pressing down on her. There was no point denying it further. “Because I traveled to another country before," she confessed. His hand shot out, gripping hers with a force that made her wince.“You visited Country C?"

"Yes," she said through gritted teeth, trying to pull away."Let go of me!"

His grip tightened before loosening slightly, his dark eyes studying her intently. “You need to explain why you went to Country C and why you hid it from me."

"I don't owe you an explanation," she snapped, defiance flaring despite her fear.


Alexander's jaw clenched. "When we married, I had you investigated thoroughly. Nothing about a trip to Country C came up. You'd better start talking, Lilly, or you'll face the consequences."

She met his gaze with a mix of defiance and desperation. "The contract we signed specifies that you're not to interfere in my personal matters, just as I don't interfere in yours.”


"Not when it's something I need to know," he growled, his voice like a blade slicing through the tense air. “Especially since he was your first."

Lilly flinched at the mention of her past, the unspoken accusation hanging heavy between them. “You're hurting me," she said quietly.

His grip loosened, and for a moment, something unspoken flickered in his eyes before he turned away. Without another word, he signaled for the driver and James to return, and the car resumed its journey. The rest of the drive was cloaked in icy silence. When they finally reached the mansion, Lilly climbed out and stormed inside, her anger simmering beneath the surface. Clara greeted her warmly. "Welcome back, ma'am.How was your evening? 



"It went fine," Lilly replied curtly, her tone betraying her irritation.

Clara's gaze dropped to Lilly's wist, her expression shifting to concern.“
Oh dear, what happened to your wrist?"

Before Lilly could respond, Alexander entered the room.


“I'm fine," Lilly said, pulling her hand back. She shot a glance at Alexander before adding, "Clara, you don't need to worry.”

"Let me treat it for you-" Clara began, but Lilly cut her off.


"No, it's fine." She turned on her heel and headed for the elevator,leaving Clara staring after her.

Alexander's presence loomed behind them. Clara quickly bowed.“Welcome back,sir."


He gave a terse nod before heading to the basement. There, he switched on the lights,selected a gun from the wall, and began firing at the target.Each shot rang out like a punctuation mark to his thoughts, sharp and deliberate.


Meanwhile, Lilly was pacing her room, phone in hand.

Lilly:“There's a problem."

Michael:"What happened?” Matthew:“Details,now.”" Lilly hesitated before typing: "Albert showed up. I had to tell Alexand er that we had a relationship and that I traveled to Country C." Matthew: "Does he know anything else?”

Lilly:“NNot yet.”

Matthew: "I'll deal with their investigation. I can plant a cover story to mask your time in Country C."

Lilly:“Do it. Just don't let anything about my connection,to Albert come up.”


The group chat fell silent for a moment before Sarah responded.

Sarah:“You know this can't last forever. You'll have to tell him the truth eventually.”

Lilly stared at the message, her mind a storm of conflicting thoughts.

Michael: “No, she can't reveal everything yet. Not until we've gathered enough evidence against her stepmother and stepsister."

Sarah:"He's going to find out, especially now that she's carrying his child.Do you really t'll let this go?”

The group chat erupted with stunned messages.

Michael:"Lilly... you're pregnant?!”

Matthew:“Wait,what?!” Lilly sighed, reading their shocked reactions. She quickly typed,“Let's meet tomorrow at my old place at noon," and turned off her phone. That night, Alexander didn't retuarn to their room. When she woke the next morning, her wrist was bandaged. The sight of the neatly wrapped gauze made her heart clench in confusion. She smiled faintly before shaking it off.

At breakfast, she was surprised to find Alexander still at home. He was seated at the table, casually scrolling through his tablet, his coffee untouched.

Clara greeted her warmly, serving breakfast. "Good morning, ma'am."

"Good morning, Clara," Lilly replied with a forced smile."Thank you for taking care of my wrist."

Clara blinked in confusion. “I didn't bandage your wrist,ma'am.”

Lilly froze, her gaze darting to Alexander.

Clara hesitated, glancing at him as well. “Ma'am, the truth is that Mr.Kane-”

"You're dismissed, Clara,” Alexander cut in sharply.

Clara bowed and left quickly.

Lilly turned to him, raising an eyebrow. “Did I do something wrong.Mr.Kane?” she asked, feigning innocence.

His gaze darkened, his jaw tightening. “You've made plenty of mistakes,"he said cryptically. He slid an envelope across the table toward her.

"What's this?" she asked, picking it up. “You'll accompany me to a banquet next week," he said. Lilly frowned. “You never take me to these things. Why now?" "It's the 80th birthday of the Lawrence family head. It's time I introduced you properly," he said, his tone leaving no room for argument.

Her blood ran cold. The Lawrence family was one of the most influential in Aurora City. The event would be swarming with media, ensuring her presence would not go unnoticed.


“You're planning to announce our marriage," she said,her voice barely above a whisper.


Alexander's cold smile was all the confirmation she needed.
###Chapter 26

The morning light streamed into the dining room as Lilly faced Alexander.The tension between them was palpable, the air thick with unspoken accusations. Alexander sat at the head of the table, his composure unnervingly calm as he stirred his coffee.

"Explain to me again why you're so adamant about this event," Lilly ventured, her voice steady but cautious.


Alexander didn't glance up. "It's time you played the role of Mrs. Kane in public."


Her heart thudded against her ribcage. “I thought we agreed to keep this marriage private," she countered, her tone measured.


Setting his cup down with a soft clink, Alexander fixed her with a gaze so cold it made her breath hitch. "I don't recall agreeing to anything. This marriage, like everything else, operates on my terms."

Lilly's fingers curled around her napkin, her mind racing. “Why now?What changed?”


He leaned back, a faint smirk tugging at his lips. “Perhaps I've grown tired of keeping you hidden.”


His cryptic response unsettled her. Before she could press further, he rose,buttoned his jacket, and left the room with a parting glance that promised no further discussion. As the sound of his footsteps faded, Lilly sat frozen, her thoughts a whirlwind of suspicion and fear. What was Alexander planning? Later That Day: Lilly's Apartment The air in her old apartment was thick with tension as her friends gathered around her. Matthew, Sarah, and Michael watched her expectantly.their concern evident.

“You're here early," Lilly said, forcing a faint smile to mask her unease.

Matthew crossed his arms, his expression grave. "We needed to talk. Sit down.”


The chair in the center of the roomn felt more like an interrogation spot than a place to rest. Lilly hesitated but eventually took the seat,bracing herself.


Matthew didn't waste time. "Why didn't you tell us about the pregnancy?And what's this about Kane dragging you to some high-profile event?”

Lilly exhaled, her fingers gripping the armrest. "I didn't tell you because it complicates things. As for the event..." She paused, glancing at each of them.“Alexander plans to introduce me as his wife at the Lawrence family's grand celebration."


The room erupted into chaos.

Michael's voice rose above the others."He's exposing your marriage? That wasn't part of the plan! Do you realize what this means?"

Sarah's eyes widened in alarm. "Your family will be there, won't they?They'll recognize you, Lilly. They'll know you're alive." Lilly nodded, her face resolute."That's exactly what I'm counting on." Matthew stepped closer, his tone sharp. "Have you lost your mind? If they find out, they'll come after you-and the baby." "I'm done hiding." Lilly said firmly. "This is the perfect chance to force their hand. In a public setting, with the media watching, they can't deny my existence. They'Il have to face me, and their every move will be scrutinized."


Michael shook his head. "We don't have enough evidence to take them down yet. If you make a move too soon-"

"I'll handle it," Lilly interrupted, her voice steady. “Being out in the open will force them to slip up. I need them to make mistakes, and this is how I'll do it."


Sarah stepped forward, her voice trembling. "And Alexander? What happens when he finds out the truth about who you are?"

Lilly's gaze faltered for a moment before hardening with resolve.“I'll deal with Alexander when the time comes. Right now, I need to focus on exposing my family.”

The room fell silent, the weight of her decision pressing down on all of them.

Matthew finally spoke, his voice low. "If you're set on this,we'll back you.But, Lilly... be careful. You're not just fighting for yourself anymore."

Lilly placed a hand over her stomach, a flicker of vulnerability crossing her face."I know. That's why I have to do this."

*****	******** The boardroom on the 30th floor was a hive of activity as Kate Blake made her entrance, flanked by her mother, Bella, and her assistant. The executives' murmurs quieted as she strode confidently to the front,her polished demeanor commanding the room.

"This is your moment. Kate," Bella whispered, her eyes shining with pride.

Kate nodded, her mind laser-focused on her goals. She had worked tirelessly for this position, enduring countless challenges to prove her worth. Today, she was officially taking over as CEO of Blake Real Estate Management.

"Good afternoon," Kate began, her voice smooth and poised. "I'm honored to accept the role of CEO. Together, we will continue to lead Blake Real Estate to greater heights.”


The applause that followed was deafening, but Kate's mind was elsewhere.Memories of a figure from her past-a face she thought she had seen in a crowd-gnawed at her. Could Lilly truly be alive?

Her thoughts drifted to the upcoming Lawrence family celebration. It was the perfect opportunity to solidify her standing in Aurora City's elite.And perhaps, it was time to confront the ghost of her past.

As the applause faded, Kate's resolve deepened. She would seize this moment-not just to claim her position, but to win Alexander Kane's heart.
###Chapter 27

A Few Days Later: The Banquet Gala

Lawrence Grand Hotel

The Lawrence Grand Hotel shimmered like a jewel, its opulent façade illuminated by a sea of flashbulbs. A parade of sleek, rare luxury cars glided into the entrance, each vehicle a statement of status and power.The gala was Aurora City's most exclusive event of the year, attracting the crème de la crème of society. Celebrities, moguls, and aristocrats graced the crimson carpet, their polished images immortalized by relentless photographers.

"Who will steal the show this year?” a reporter whispered, her eyes scanning the sea of arrivals.

Suddenly, gasps rippled through the crowd as a glossy black limousine slid to a halt. The air buzzed with anticipation, cameras poised for the grand reveal. As the door opened, Kate Blake stepped out,her gown glittering like starlight under the flashes. She carried herself with the poise of someone born to dominate a room, her every step calculated to perfection.

“Ms. Blake, over here! Tell us about your recent promotion!” a reporter called out, his microphone thrust forward. Kate turned, her polished smile masking the flutter of nerves beneath.“It's an incredible honor to lead Blake Real Estate Management. Tonight,though, I'm just here to enjoy the celebration.” As the media devoured her every word, Kate's gaze flitted toward the hotel entrance, Her heart raced, though not from the attention lavished upon her. She wasn't here to bask in the spotlight. Tonight, her eyes were set on one man-Alexander Kane.

“Still dreaming about him?" Amanda, a close friend, teased as Kate joined their group inside the grand hall.

Kate's smile tightened. "Dreaming? No. Tonight, he'll finally notice me."

Before Amanda could retort, a hush fell over the crowd outside. Every head turned as the unmistakable growl of a custom Mercedes-Benz Maybach Exelero sliced through the murmurs. The car's arrival was a statement: only one man in Aurora City commanded such presence.


“Alexander Kane," someone breathed, the name rolling like thunder through the crowd.


The car door opened, and his aide, James, stepped out first, scanning the scene with precision. Then came Alexander himself, stepping into the limelight with effortless command. Dressed in a tailored midnight-black suit, his sharp features exuded power. The mere sight of him was enough to silence the chaos, every camera trained on his every move.

But it wasn't just Alexander who stole the night. He turned back toward the car, extending his hand. A collective gasp echoed as a woman emerged, her presence radiant and arresting. Lilly Kane stepped into view, her gown an ethereal masterpiece that clung to her figure with elegant precision. The intricately beaded bodice shimmered under the soft glow, and her poise rivaled even the most seasoned socialites. The crowd froze. "Who is she?" whispers spread like wildfire. "She's breathtaking.. but I've never seen her before."

Reporters clamored to break the silence. "Mr. Kane, is she your date?"

Alexander's lips curved into a faint smile, his voice a smooth enigma.“You'll know soon enough.”

With Lily's hand in his, he strode toward the entrance, their presence leaving an indelible mark.

Inside, the gala hall buzzed with anticipation. Conversations stilled as eyes turned to the grand doors. Kate's breath caught in her throat as the announcer stepped forward, his expression betraying a flicker of disbelief.

“Presenting... Mr. Alexander Kane and Mrs. Lilly Kane."

The declaration hit the room like a lightning strike. The name reverberated through the hall,leaving an eerie silence in its wake.

Kate's glass slipped from her fingers, shattering against the marble floor.Her world tilted as the name echoed in her ears: Mrs. Lilly Kane.

"No,” Kate whispered, her voice trembling with disbelief. Her eyes locked on the woman by Alexander's side, her composure crumbling.

Bella's lips pressed into a thin line, her grip tightening around her champagne flute. "It can't be," she muttered under her breath. “She's supposed to be dead."

All eyes were on Lilly as she glided into the room, Alexander's arm wrapped around her possessively. Her heart pounded, but her expression remained serene, the perfect mask of confidence.

Kate's mind raced. Lilly? Alive? Married to Alexander? How?
Alexander, sensing the stir he'd created, leaned toward Lilly.“Enjoying the attention?"


Lilly's voice was steady, though her pulse thundered in her ears. “I think you enjoy it more."


He smirked, his gaze sweeping the room like a predator assessing its prey."Let them wonder. It's more entertaining that way."

Kate couldn't tear her eyes away. Every dream, every plan she had crafted for this night unraveled before her. Lilly's return wasn't just a disruption-it was a reckoning.

As the couple made their way further into the room, the whispers grew louder. The Blake family's faces were masks of barely concealed shock and anger. Kate clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms.

“This isn't over," she vowed under her breath, her eyes burning with unbridled determination.

Alexander's voice broke through Lilly's thoughts as they approached the center of the room. "Ready to meet the lions?"

Lilly lifted her chin, her resolve hardening. “I've been ready my whole life.



The tension was palpable, the air electric with unanswered questions. Lilly could feel the weight of every gaze on her, but she refused to falter. As Alexander led her into the heart of the lion's den, a storm brewed-one that would shatter the fragile facades of power,secrets, and deceit. Bella's eyes darted around the room. Too many were already watching.With a forced smile, she tugged Kate into a secluded corner, her voice a low but firm warning.
###Chapter 28

The air in the grand banquet hall was thick with tension. Kate stood frozen,her heart pounding in her chest as her mother's hand gripped her arm tightly.


"Oh no, Kate, you'll ruin your dress!" Amanda exclaimed, her voice tinged with alarm as she dabbed at the spilled wine on Kate's gown. But Kate didn't move-her focus was singular, her gaze locked on Lilly and Alexander.


Bella's face was a storm of emotions, her usually composed demeanor faltering. Her trembling hand clutched her own glass, and she struggled to steady herself. She cast a glance at her husband, Peter, whose expression was a strange mix of astonishment and... joy.

Is he pleased? Bella thought, the question sending a surge of cold anger through her. She shifted her attention back to Kate, whose fiery determination was written all over her face as she started toward Lilly.

“Let me go, Mother!" Kate hissed, yanking at Bella's grip.

"What are you planning to do, Kate?" Bella whispered urgently,trying to mask their argument from the prying eyes around them.

“Didn't you hear the announcer?” Kate snapped, her voice barely a whisper but sharp with fury. "Mrs. Kane. She's back to steal everything-Alexander, the company, my future. I won't stand here and let her take it all.” "Listen to me. Kate." Bella said, her tone laced with steel. "You cannot make a scene here. Compose yourself, or you'll ruin more than your dress."

"How can I stay calm with her flaunting hersef as Mrs. Kane?" Kate spat.

Bella's lips pressed into a thin line. “I'll deal with her. Focus on maintaining your image, Kate. This battle requires strategy, not emotion."

Kate's glare softened just enough to show she was listening, though her fists remained clenched at her sides.


Across the hall, Peter stood rooted in place, his eyes locked on Lilly. He could barely believe it-his daughter, presumed lost for years, was alive and standing mere feet away. A thousand questions churned in his mind.Where has she been? Why didn't anyone find her? And why is she now...Mrs.Kane?


"Should we inform the old master?" his assistant murmured beside him.

Peter shook his head, his voice quiet but firm. "No need. He knows."

His gaze met Lilly's, but her expression was unreadable, her icy stare enough to halt his tentative steps forward. Does she still blame me? For her sisters? He stayed back, his heart aching with the distance between them.

Lilly felt the weight of every stare as she stood beside Alexander.She had noticed Kate's attempted approach and Bella's swift intervention. Good,she thought. Not tonight, Kate. “Lilly, you look stunning," Sophia's familiar voice broke through her thoughts, accompanied by a warm kiss on her cheek. "She does," Richard added, his easy grin adding a rare moment of levity. "Thank you," Lilly replied, her tone gracious but guarded.

“You're stealing the spotlight, as usual," Richard teased. “Though I admit,
I never thought I'd see Alexander Kane introducing anyone as his wife.
You'll have to work hard to convince everyone it's real."

Alexander remained silent, his stoic demeanor unshaken as he motioned for Lilly to follow him.


They crossed the hall to another cluster of influential guests, where
Alexander's long-time friend Ethan greeted him with a warm smile.

"I've missed you, my friend," Ethan said, clapping Alexander on the shoulder.


"I'm busy," Alexander replied coolly, brushing past him.

Ethan's attention shifted to Lilly. "And who's this vision of beauty?"

"She was announced as Mrs. Kane," Alexander said, his tone sharp.

Ethan froze, his jaw slack with shock. "Is this some sort of joke?"

Alexander leaned in, his voice low and cutting."It's not. And you'd best remember that."

Ethan's stunned expression followed them as they moved on.

As they approached the patriarch of the Lawrence family, the tension in the air grew heavier. The old master's frown deepened at the sight of Lilly,and his voice was laced with irritation.

“You troublemaker," he said, glaring at Alexander. “Of all the headaches you've caused me, this one takes the crown." Alexander's response was calm but unyielding. "This is my wife, Lilly Evans."

Lilly bowed politely, her movements measured andI graceful despite the scrutiny.


The old master's eyes narrowed as he addressed her."You should consider yourself lucky to be with him. Without him, you'd be nothing."

Lilly held her composure, though she bristled internally.


Alexander's response was a quiet but firm declaration. “It's my choice."

The old master's frustration was evident, but he waved them toward the table. "Sit. Enjoy the meal. We'll discuss this later."

As the third course was served, Lilly's stomach churned. She excused herself and hurried to the restroom, her composure finally cracking as she retched into the sink. Steadying herself, she splashed water on her face before stepping back into the corridor.

Two towering men in black blocked her path.


“Miss Lilly Evans," one said, his tone devoid of warmth. “You need to come with us.”.


Her eyes darted around-Alexander's guards were nowhere to be seen.Panic prickled at the edges of her calm. “Who sent you?”

“You'll find out soon enough," the other replied, stepping closer. Before she could scream, a cloth was pressed to her mouth.Darkness closed in as she realized, too late, that the trap had been sprung.

###Chapter 29

Kate's gaze was like a hawk, fixed on Lilly and Alexander throughout the event. Fury simmered beneath her poised exterior, her clenched fists betraying her true feelings.

“You shouldn't worry so much," Amanda murmured, her tone laced with mischief as she swirled the wine in her glass. "I've heard rumors that their so-called marriage might not even be real.”

Kate turned sharply to her. "What did you hear?"

Amanda smirked. “Oh, just whispers. People are saying no one truly believes Alexander would tie himself down. They think he's using her to dodge Old Master Lowe's plans to marry him off to his granddaughter. So.darling, the door isn't shut for you just yet.”

Kate's lips curled into a slow smile. "That explains a lot." She turned her eyes back to Lilly, who had just left the hall for the restroom.Her father,Peter,stood nearby, his gaze lingering on Lilly like a shadow.

How pathetic, Kate thought. He knows she'll never forgive him, and yet he still watches her like a ghost from the past. I'm the only daughter he has now. Lilly disowned him the moment she walked away.

"Now that Lilly's gone, isn't this the perfect moment to approach Alexander?" Bella's voice broke through Kate's thoughts as she joined them. Kate's smile grew sharper. "Why didn't I think of that?" She pulled out a compact mirror, ensuring her makeup was flawless and her smile inviting. “You look stunning, darling. Go on," Bella urged, her eyes glinting with encouragement.

Kate nodded and moved gracefully toward Alexander, her heels clicking softly on the polished floor. Her heart raced with anticipation. This was her chance to make her mark.


"What's Kate up to?" Peter asked, noticing his daughter's determined stride toward Alexander.


Bella,standing beside him, raised a brow. “Relax, Peter. She's networking.Kate's the new CEO of Blake Real Estate. She's merely seeking a business collaboration. Who better to align with than Alexander Kane?”

Peter sighed, though his eyes remained on Kate. "I hope she doesn't stir trouble with Lilly.”

Bella smiled thinly. "You underestimate her, Peter.She knows what she's doing.”

Kate rehearsed her lines in her head as she neared Alexander, who was deep in conversation with Ethan. Her pulse quickened, but she forced herself to stay composed. With a measured breath, she spoke.

“Hello,Mr.Kane.”

Alexander turned his piercing gaze on her for a fleeting moment before returning his attention to Ethan without a word.

Kate felt heat rise to her cheeks, a mixture of humiliation and frustration threatening to crack her poise. She had idolized Alexander since high school,but now his cold dismissal stung deeper than she anticipated.Swallowing her pride, she tried again.

"I'm Kate, the new CEO of Blake Real Estate. I'd like to discuss a
potential collaboration with you."

Ethan paused, his curiosity piqued and looked at her. Alexander, however,remained indifferent, his attention now shifting to his watch.

"Twenty minutes," Alexander muttered, his brow furrowing. He signaled one of his guards. "Find out where she is."

"Yes,boss," the guard replied, immediately heading toward the restroom.

Kate froze. He's talking about Lilly.

Her frustration deepened as she watched the man she admired dismiss her entirely for the sake of her.

Determined not to slink away in defeat, Kate boldly slid into the empty chair Lilly had left behind. That finally drew Alexander's attention.

“Get up and leave," he said, his voice like ice.

The chill in his words sent shivers down Kate's spine, but she forced herself to stand with a small, embarrassed smile. Just as she was about to retreat, the guards returned, their faces pale with fear as they whispered urgently to Alexander. His expression darkened instantly, and he shot up from his seat.

"What's going on?” Ethan asked,already following his friend. Curiosity burned in Kate's chest, and she trailed behind them. By now,the unusual movement had caught the attention of others, including Old Master Lowe, who motioned for his men to investigate the growing commotion. Peter's eyes narrowed as he noticed the sudden stir. When he saw Alexander and Kate heading toward the restroom, alarm bells rang in his mind.

"Where are you going, Peter?" Bella asked, trying to mnask her unease as she saw the same thing.

"Lilly hasn't returned. It's been too long, and now Alexander is heading in her direction. Something's wrong." Peter made to leave, but Bella grabbed his arm.

“Don't. You've stayed calm this entire night, and now you want to create a scene? Let her come back on her own.”

Peter shook her off. "I need to know."


With a sigh of exasperation, Bella followed him, though her nails dug into her palms in barely contained frustration.

"What do you mean she's gone?” Alexander's voice was like a thunderclap.and the trembling guards flinched under his fury.

"We were ambushed," one of them stammered, blood trickling from his temple."Two men. They knocked us out and took her."

"Who dares take my wife?" Alexander's voice dropped to a lethal growl as he grabbed one guard by the collar. "If she isn't found, you're all dead.”

Ethan quickly intervened. “Calm down, Alexander. I've already sent my men to search the hotel and review the CCTV footage.We'll find her." “It's not enough," Alexander snapped, his jaw tightening as he stormed toward the exit. "If someone has taken her, they'll regret it." Peter arrived just intime to hear Alexander's threats. His face turned ashen as he pushed through the gathering crowd.


"Where is my daughter?" Peter demanded, his voice ringing out like a cannon blast.

Alexander stopped in his tracks, his sharp eyes locking on Peter.

“What daughter?” Ethan asked,confused.

Peter's voice shook with both anger and desperation. "Lilly. She came with you, and now she's missing. If anything happens to her, her grandfather will come for you.”


Ethan's expression shifted to shock as he turned to Alexander.“Your wife is a Blake?"


Kate's heart plummeted as the revelation hit her like a sledgehammer.Her fists clenched at her sides.


Alexander's face was unreadable, but the tension in his frame betrayed his inner turmoil. His thoughts were a storm of questions. Lilly. A Blake. Why didn't she tell me?

His expression hardened. One thing was clear, when he found her, Lilly would have a lot to explain.
###Chapter 30

Lilly's eyes fluttered open, her senses groggy and disoriented. The first thing she noticed was the soft silk of the sheets beneath her and the faint scent of lavender in the air. She pressed her hand instinctively to her abdomen, her breath hitching until relief swept over her, there was no pain.Her baby was safe.

As her mind cleared, she sat up and took in her surroundings. The room was spacious, the decor blending timeless elegance with subtle modern touches. But what caught her attention most were the portraits hanging on the wall, hers. One showed her as a carefree teenager, and the other, more recent, captured her with an air of quiet defiance.

A chill ran down her spine as recognition struck. This wasn't just any room; it was her room from years ago. Though updated with a larger bed and an adult aesthetic, the space remained unmistakably hers. She hadn't set foot here in over a decade, not since she and her sisters had fled the Blake mansion after their mother's death.


Memories flooded her, some warm, most bitter. She had lived here under the protective shadow of her grandfather, shielded from the betrayals that had torn their family apart. But even his watchful eye hadn't been enough to erase the scars Bella, her father, and Kate had inflicted. Her mother had been pregnant with her when her father's affair with Bella came to light, Bella, bold and unapologetic, had moved in, claiming her place as a second wife with her infant daughter, Kate. The scandal had shattered their family, leaving her mother a ghost of the vibrant woman she once was. She died when Lilly was five, the circumstances shrouded in secrecy, a mystery Lilly had vowed to unravel. Her hand brushed against the vanity table as she walked around the room.the sound startling her. She couldn't suppress a bitter laugh. She had known returning to the public eye would catch her grandfather's attention,but she hadn't expected him to kidnap her from the banquet.

Still, it was a twisted relief. For a fleeting moment, she had feared it was Bella, or worse, Kate, attempting to harm her and her unborn child. Yet here she was, safe under her grandfather's roof.

Her thoughts darkened, she knew he would be waiting, likely in his study.He would demand answers for her two-year absence and the secrets she had kept. But she had made peace with the confrontation, she had returned stronger, with plans in motion to bring the culprits to justice.

Lilly approached the door, squaring her shoulders. When she opened it,two of her grandfather's guards stood at attention, their imposing figures blocking the hallway.

"Where is my grandfather?" she asked, her tone calm yet firm.

One of them stepped forward. "This way, ma'am.”

They led her down the long corridors she hadn't walked in years,their familiarity both comforting and suffocating. Each step echoed with memories, laughter with her sisters, the coldness of betrayal, and the weight of her mother's absence.

Finally, they reached the study. She paused at the door, her pulse quickening. After a deep breath, she knocked. “Enter," came the deep, authoritative voice that could silence an entire room. She pushed the door open and stepped inside, closing it softly behind her. The air was thick with tension, the room dimly lit except for the warm glow of the lamp on her grandfather's desk.

Caleb Blake sat behind it, his form as imposing as she remembered.Despite his age, his presence commanded respect and fear in equal measure. He was hunched over, writing with an ink pen on a scroll, a tradition he refused to abandon even in the digital age.

Lilly walked to the center of the room and lowered herseIf onto a mat,bowing until her forehead touched the floor in a gesture of deep respect.She remained in that position, waiting for him to acknowledge her.

Minutes stretched into what felt like an eternity before the scratching of the pen stopped.

Caleb raised his head, his sharp eyes boring into her. The worry etched into his features betrayed the anger in his voice. "So, the wayward granddaughter returns."

Lilly lifted her head, her voice trembling.“Grandfather.”

The crack of his palm hitting the desk made her flinch.

"You dare call me that?" His voice thundered through the room.“You selfish child! What kind of granddaughter disappears for two years without a word? You didn't even attend your sisters' funerals!"

Tears stung her eyes as the weight of his words settled over her. He stood, his towering figure casting a shadow over her. "Do you have any idea what you've put me through? And to hear just now that you married,without my knowledge or consent? You've disgraced this family!" Lilly's voice broke as she replied, "Do you think I wanted to disappear? After my sisters died, if I had stayed, you would have lost me too. I had no choice; I had to hide, gather evidence, and bring their killers to justice."

Caleb's glare softened, a flicker of doubt clouding his anger. He sat back down heavily, his face grave. “You speak as if you know who killed them."

"I do," she whispered, her tears falling freely now. "But without proof, I couldn't risk exposing myself. I would have been their next target."

The room fell silent, and Caleb lost in thought. He had spent every resource at his disposal hunting for the culprits and his missing granddaughter. Their ability to evade him spoke to the power of their enemies.


"You could have been protected," he finally said, his voice quieter but no less firm. "After your sisters' deaths, I ensured the strongest security. And yet you still vanished."

Lilly bit her lip, knowing he didn't suspect Bella or Kate. Their guilt was a truth she carried alone, one she couldn't reveal until the evidence was undeniable. But now that they knew she was alive, they would make a move,and she would be ready.

“Grandfather, I'm sorry," she said, bowing deeply again. “Forgive me for the pain I've caused you."

Caleb studied her for a long moment before exhaling sharply. “Since you've apologized, I'll lessen your punishment." Her stomach dropped. She remembered his punishments all too well,creative, thorough, and unforgettable. "And also," he added, his gaze hardening, "you will divorce him." Lilly's head snapped up. her heart racing."Wha?"

"You heard me." he said coldly. "You will divorce Alexander Kane."

The weight of his command hung heavy in the air, and for the first time in years. Lilly felt truly trapped.
###Chapter 31

The grand banquet hall, once filled with high society chatter,fell abruptly silent. Alexander, his face a mask of authority and barely contained fury,had commanded the event to a swift and unceremonious end. With a sharp gesture, he ordered the guests to leave, and one by one, they filtered out, leaving behind only whispers and speculation. Journalists, unable to resist the pull of the unknown, lingered in the shadows, eager to uncover the reason behind the premature closure. They could feel the storm brewing but knew better than to approach.

Elsewhere, Old Master Lowe, a confidant of Caleb Blake, received the shocking news of Lilly's disappearance-along with the devastating truth of her identity. A woman he had initially thought was merely Alexander's wife had turned out to be the long-lost heiress to the Blake empire. The revelation hit like a bolt, the implications running far deeper than he could have imagined. Caleb had spent two years searching for her, and now.to learn she had been taken once again, this time with the knowledge of her true lineage, was enough to rattle even Lowe's steely resolve.

He wasted no time. The event, now a forgotten memory, had to end, and Alexander's search needed to begin in earnest. Caleb would be enraged, his fury amplified by the knowledge that his granddaughter had vanished-again-just as she had resurfaced. He had no time to waste, and neither did Alexander. The clock was ticking. Hours later, past midnight, Bella and Kate stood side by side in the cold,empty parking lot. Their search for Lilly had yielded nothing, and the frustration gnawed at them. Three hours had passed since the conclusion of the banquet, and still, there was no sign of Lilly. Kate's thoughts churned, her fists clenched as she stared at the ground, frustration turning into quiet fury. "Mother, was this your doing?"Kate's voice was a low, tense whisper,laden with suspicion as she glanced at Bela, who had always been a schemer atheart.


Bella's lips curled into a thin smile, but there was no humor in it. "No, I wouldn't be so foolish as to kidnap her in a place where we could be easily identified. Alexander will find her. He's powerful, and I'm sure she's safe...for now."

Kate narrowed her eyes, though she hated to admit it, her mother's logic was sound. But that didn't stop the gnawing resentment."Today has been the worst day of my life," Kate muttered through gritted teeth, anger building. Initially, she had hoped Bella had orchestrated the abduction,but now she saw it was unlikely. And then there was Alexander. His frantic search, as if Lilly were the most precious thing in the world to him, only made Kate's stomach turn. Why does he care so much? she wondered, her mind swirling with unanswered questions.

Kate balled her fists, pacing, trying to quell the rising tide of jealousy.She couldn't just let Lilly waltz back into their lives, reclaim her birthright, and win over the man Kate had set her sights on. No. She couldn't.

“Your father's coming," Bella remarked, her voice cutting through Kate's spiraling thoughts.

Kate froze. She didn't need to look to know what was coming.

Peter's silhouette emerged from the shadows, his stride confident and purposeful. "Have they found her?" he asked, his voice clipped with urgency. "I've just received word," Bella answered, her eyes narrowing. "Two of my men have been following Alexander's team. He's heading to the Blake estate."


A flicker of alarm passed between mother and daughter. "Why would he go there?" Kate asked her voice tight with confusion.

"He found out she was taken there," Peter replied, his words sending a jolt through the air.


Lilly... at the Blake estate? The realization hit like a blow to the chest. The mansion, the home where the Blake legacy was built.Why would Alexander think she was there?

Peter's expression softened. "It's Caleb. He took her."

“Grandfather took her?” Bella's voice was a mix of disbelief and shock.She had never expected him to act so swiftly, so decisively.

Kate stood frozen in place, her mind racing, piecing thefragments of this twisted puzzle together. Caleb... The very thought of him stirred a deep.uncomfortable fear inside her.

"I'm relieved it was him," Peter added, his tone cold and final. "Let's head back.”

Bella's composure returned as she nodded sharply, giving Kate one last glance before heading towards the car. "Let's go." Reluctantly, Kate followed. Her heart thudded in her chest as they climbed into the car. A sense of dread hung over her like a dark cloud, and she couldn't shake the feeling that things were about to take a darker turn. Back at the Blake Estate... The tension inside the Blake estate was palpable as Alexander sat in the car, his fingers tapping relentlessly against the armrest. His men, eight cars deep, stood by, ready to back him up if the gates didn't open on their own.Every moment that passed felt like an eternity, the silence between them filled with the promise of a coming storm. If the estate guards didn't let him in,he would break through.

James, sitting beside him, couldn't ignore the look of determination etched across Alexander's face. This wasn't just a man searching for his wife.This was something else, something deeper. Alexander wasn't just seeking Lilly-he was preparing for a confrontation, one that would shatter everything in its path.

"Since we know her grandfather has her, and she's safe, why don't we just leave? He'll send her back, or she'll come back on her own." James suggested, trying to reason with him.

But Alexander'ssmirk was cold, unexpected, sending a shiver through James. It was a rare expression from the usually composed man.

"No, he won't," Alexander said quietly, the words heavy with meaning."As far as he knows, she's still married to me. He won't let her return to me willingly."

James blinked, trying to process the deeper implication of Alexander's words. What did he mean by that? He didn't have time to dwell on the thought. The gate had swung open, and the convoy moved forward,driving into the estate. Inside the mansion, the tension was thick as Alexander stepped from the car,his demeanor regal and commanding. Guards didn't dare challenge him as he moved forward, a man on a mission. Inside the estate. Paul, a middle-aged servant, led Alexander down winding corridors before stopping at a broad, imposing door. With a knock,Paul received permission to enter.

Lilly was there. Sitting on the plush mat in the middle of the study.looking smaller than usual in the vast room. Her eyes locked with his the moment he stepped inside, and Alexander's heart twisted at the sight of her, vulnerable, yet strangely composed.

"Mr. Kane, Master Caleb is waiting." Paul announced.

Lilly stood in haste, her eyes flickering between Alexander and Caleb,who remained seated, a commanding presence in the room. But before Lilly could say a word, Alexander strode toward her, ignoring the stillness that enveloped the room. His voice was low, firm. “Let's go.”

Lilly's heart raced. She glanced at her grandfather and then back at Alexander.

Her grandfather's voice cut through the thick air likea knife."I only permitted this visit to inform you-she will not leave with you. She will be filing for a separation."

"Separation?" Alexander's eyes flashed, narrowing as he looked at Lilly,his gaze demanding answers.

Lilly's lips parted, but Alexander silenced her with a sharp motion. “Save it for later," he muttered."You have a lot to explain." The words hung in the air,heavy with tension. "I advise you to leave now," Caleb warned,his eyes cold. But Alexander wasn't moving. He stood his ground, his eyes locked onto Caleb's. "You know I will leave with her. Whether you like it or not."

Their eyes met, the room growing colder as the silent battle raged between them. Lilly stood frozen, her heart pounding, her mind a swirl of confusion. What had her grandfather just warned her about? What did she not know about Alexander that was now coming to light?

Caleb's next words cut through the air like a blade. "You have no idea what kind of man you married. What you think you know about him...is far from the whole truth.”

Lilly's breath caught in her throat. What was her grandfather trying to tell her?

Alexander's unreadable expression deepened. The silence in the room was deafening. One thing was clear, this wasn't just about Lilly anymore. The secrets, the lies, they were about to come to light, and nothing would ever be the same again.

The night stretched on, longer and darker than either of them could have imagined. The truth was about to unravel.
###Chapter 32

Lilly's mind raced as she tried to piece together the cryptic words her grandfather had left her with. What kind of man had she married? The question echoed in her mind like a relentless drumbeat. Caleb had been so sure-so certain-that there was something she didn't understand.something hidden beneath Alexander's cold exterior. The way the two men had locked eyes before she left the room, their silent tension unmistakable, made it clear that their relationship was more than it appeared.


"Lilly,you need to make a smart choice and stay." Caleb's voice had been low, but it carried a weight that unsettled her. His words still hung in the air as she glanced back at Alexander, who was waiting for her to make her move.

Her eyes flicked between her grandfather and her husband. She wanted to say something, to make sense of this chaos, but the tension in the room had become unbearable. After a long moment, Lilly spoke, her voice tentative. "Can I stay tonight and return tomorrow?"

"No," Alexander's response was immediate, his grip on her hand firmn as he gntly, but decisvely, led her toward the door. Lilly stole one last glance at her grandfather,and the expression on his face-disappointment mingled with a simmering fury-made her chest tighten. There was more going on here than she had realized, and as she stepped outside the mansion, she knew she was walking into something far darker than she had anticipated. Outside, James sat in the car, lounging as if he had all the time in the world. The guards stood at attention, guns at the ready,waiting for a signal from their boss to act. Lilly barely noticed them,her mind too clouded by the events inside.

The sound of another car pulling up broke through her fog. Peter, Bella,and Kate stepped out, their surprise evident as they took in thescene before them.


"What is happening here?" Peter asked, his voice low but sharp as he approached James.


"Alexander is here to retrieve his wife," James answered nonchalantly,watching the scene unfold.

Peter's gaze shifted to the armed guards, his confusion palpable. "I understand that, but why all the commotion?"

"They're just doing their duty to protect their boss," James replied, his tone dismissive, as though this were a matter of little consequence.


Before Peter could respond, Lilly emerged from the mansion, her hand still held tightly in Alexander's. Kate's eyes flared with jealousy as she watched the two of them walk toward the car, their connection unmistakable.


"Lilly!" Peter called out.

Lilly slowed her pace, prompting Alexander to stop as well, his grip on her hand tightening imperceptibly.


"Get in the car," he commanded, his voice as cold as steel. "Just a minute," she replied, her words quiet but firm. She broke free from his grasp and walked toward her family. Lilly's eyes swept over her mother and sister before landing onPeter."I just want you to know that I'm back, and you know what that means,right?" Her words were laced with an edge,and she let the unspoken threat hang in the air.

Bella's eyebrows arched, a silent undlerstanding passing between them.Kate's expression twisted into something darker, and Peter shifted uncomfortably, but Lilly paid them no mind.

"I'm glad you're back, Lilly; we were worried," Bella said, her voice dripping with a sweetness that didn't quite reach her eyes.

Lilly's smile was chilling, almost wicked. "If you were worried before, you should be even more worried now." With that, she turned, walking back to the car with Alexander.

As the two of them climbed into the car, Alexander cast one last glance at the three of them, his gaze unreadable. He didn't speak, only gestured for the driver to take them away.

James,always observant, climbed into their vehicle, the convoy following them silently into the night.

Peter stood watching, his fists clenched in quiet frustration as the cars pulled away from the mansion. He knew something was wrong,something had shifted, but he couldn't yet put his finger on it.

Kate's patience had long since run out. With a growl of frustration,she stormed back into the house, Bella trailing behind her like a shadow. The moment they were inside, Kate didn't hesitate. She stormed over to her dressing table, throwing things onto the floor in a fit of rage. "I'm so furious right now, Mother!" she spat, her voice trembling with anger."If Alexander hadn't been there, I would have slapped her! I can't believe she dared to threaten us like that! Does she think she can just waltz back into our lives?"

Bella's face remained impassive as she stepped forward, gently placing a hand on Kate's shoulder to calm her. "Shush, lower your voice," she murmured, her tone surprisingly soft.

Kate fought to control her breathing, but the frustration refused to dissipate. "I hate her, Mother. I hate that she's back. She's challenging me on every front. I can't believe she married Alexander! She must have known I liked him and is just trying to get under my skin!”

Bella's eyes narrowed, a slow smile curling on her lips as she settled onto the couch. "Relax," she said, her voice cool and calculating.“Alexander doesn't like women, so how did he end up marrying Lilly?"

Kate paused, her fury momentarily faltering. “That's true. How did he marry her?”

Bella's smile deepened as she began to piece things together in her mind.“And how did they meet? Alexander was shocked that she was she's a Blake. That means their meeting-and marriage-must have happened under different circumstances."

Kate's mind raced, trying to connect the dots. "Exactly. What I need to know now is how they met.., and why he married her.Something's not right about this." Bella stood, walking over to Kate with an air of quiet authority.She took her daughter's hand, squeezing it gently. “Don't worry about it. I'l find out everything she's been up to for the past two years. All you need to do is focus on your role as CEO and act normal around her.” Kate scowled."That will be hard, Mother. I despise her."

Bella's smile was soft but dangerous. "I'll handle her. Leave her to me.I promise she'll be out of our lives soon enough."

Kate smiled back, her anger simmering beneath the surface.“Okay, Mother.”

The drive back to Alexander's mansion was suffocatingly silent. Lilly had tried to speak, to explain herself, but Alexander's cold demeanor cut her off at every turn. His words were sharp, accusing. “You're a liar and a deceiver," he spat, his grip on the steering wheel tightening with anger.“And after yougive birth to my child, I'll divorce you."

Lilly swallowed hard, the sting of his words cutting deeper than she had expected. HHer phone buzzed with messages from Michael, Matthew,and Sarah,but she ignored them for now. They deserved an explanation,but she knew she couldn't offer one until she confronted Alexander. And that,she knew, was not going to be easy.

She glanced at him, watching as his fingers flew over his phone screen,his expression locked in icy silence. What had she missed? What did she not know about Alexander? What was it that had made Caleb so sure she had no idea who she had married? When they finally arrived at the mansion, it was already 2 a.m. Lilly was exhausted, every muscle in her body aching from the emotional strain of the night. But she knew she wouldn't sleep until she had explained herself to Alexander until she had convinced him she wasn't the person he believed her to be. As soon as the car stopped, Alexander stepped out, moving toward the house with purposeful strides. Lilly followed, trying to gather her thoughts.

Inside, Clara greeted them with her usual warm smile. "Welcome back, sir,"she said, but her eyes flicked nervously between Alexander and Lilly.

"Welcome back, ma'am," Clara said softly, offering Lilly a polite smile.

Lilly managed a tight smile before moving past Clara and stepping into the elevator. Alexander was already inside, his posture rigid and unyielding. Lilly reached for the door just as it was about to close,stepping inside before it could.

The elevator doors slid shut with a soft chime, and the tension between them was suffocating. Lilly dared not speak, not with the murderous expression on Alexander's face. She waited. She had no choice but to wait until they were in the privacy of their room.

The moment the door closed behind them, Lilly opened her mouth to speak,but Alexander was faster.

“You're a liar and a deceiver," he growled, advancing toward her,his eyes dark with anger."If you knew I was taking you to the banquet, why didn't you tell me? Why did you hide from your family?"

Lilly's heart thudded painfully in her chest. She had no idea where to begin, but she owed him the truth. "I should have told you before the banquet," she whispered, her voice shaking. "But I was afraid... so afraid.Two years ago, my sisters and I were targeted, and they were murdered.I was the next target, so I had to hide my identity to protect myself.Then you came into my life, and I thought... I thought it was the wrong time to tell you the truth." Alexander's face remained impassive as he processed her words,but his next question struck her like a blow. "Why did you marry me? Was it for money?” Lilly's throat tightened. How could she explain it to him? How could she tell him that she married him because she loved him

? But the truth was, she was scared of losing him. The words stuck in her throat.

Before she could speak, Alexander reached out, grabbing her wrist with a strength that made her wince. "Tell me the truth. No more lies,"he said darkly, his grip tightening. "If you lie again... you'll regret it."

Lilly's heart raced. She could feel the truth welling up inside her,but was she ready to say it? Could she tell him that all this time, she had only wanted to be with him?

The silence stretched between them, heavy with expectation. And then, in that moment,something shifted.

Would she finally tell him the truth?
###Chapter 33

When Alexander had instructed James to look into Lilly around the time they married, he never anticipated the uncertainty that would linger.The investigation revealed nothing beyond what Lilly had already disclosed, a mysterious gift for his grandmother, a costly gem with no traceable payment, and a gap in the information that James couldn't fill. But there was something about Lilly, something elusive and unspoken, that gnawed at him. What was her true motive for marrying him? If she dared lie again,he was determined to unearth a side of himself she had never seen.

Lilly stood before him, her heart racing as she fought to find the right words. He had been cold, calculating, even when she had hoped for something more. She had no choice but to be honest now. The weight of truth was unbearable, but perhaps it was the only way forward.

"I..."

"YOU WHAT?!" Alexander's voice was low but sharp, the impatience clear.

Lilly's gaze fell to their feet, her voice faltering. But before she could look away for comfort, Alexander gripped her chin,forcing her to meet his gaze.

"Look me in the eye while you talk so I can tell if you're lying," he commanded,his voice chilling.

"Go on," he pressed, his stare unwavering. Lilly's throat tightened, but she took a deep breath, gathering all her courage."I didn't marry you for money, but because I wanted to. The other women who were at the banquet that day had two reasons: your wealth and the title of Mrs. Kane. I had only one-I love you.” Her words hung in the air, their weight sinking in between them.She searched his face, hoping to seea flicker of emotion. But his expression remained unreadable, impossible to decipher.

"I love you, Alexander. I don't want our marriage to end after ayear and six months; I want it to last," she added, her voice trembling. Yet, despite the intensity of her plea, Alexander's face was as cold as ice, not a flicker of warmth or recognition.

Minutes passed like hours. Lilly waited, each second stretching the silence thinner and thinner. Finally, Alexander spoke, his voice an emotionless command.

“Tomorrow,your belongings will be moved back to your previous room.We will not interfere in each other's lives as stipulated in the contract.Understood?”

Lilly's stomach turned. The words were a dagger to her heart. She wanted to argue, to plead, butthe nausea that had been building in her chest suddenly overwhelmed her. Without a word, she rushed to the bathroom.her body trembling.

From the bathroom, she heard him-still standing in the hallway, his presence unwavering. But she couldn't bring herself to look at him. She retched, her stomach emptying its contents into the toilet,as her thoughts spun, What had she done wrong? Was this how it would end? Was their marriage nothing more than a cold agreement after all? When she was done, she cleaned herself up, feeling the weight of his words press down on her chest. She sat on the toilet, reluctant to face him.her mind reeling with confusion and fear. She only moved when she heard the distinct sound of the door closing-Alexander had left. She stood slowly, her heart still pounding. His words echoed in her mind like an unrelenting storm. Tomorrow. Move back to your room. Cold.Detached. There was no warmth left in his eyes, no connection. Had she failed him so utterly?

The next day, Alexander wasted no time. As soon as she woke,the move was underway, her things were being moved back to the second-floor room where she had first been placed. The separation was cold,final.There would be no further closeness, no reconciliation. Not yet.

Meanwhile, far from the mansion, Richard and Sophia were reeling from James's call. The information he had shared was staggering.

"This is huge," Sophia murmured, her voice thick with disbelief.


"I always knew there was something about her. She never fit the mold.She looked like she belonged to an elite world, but this... This is far bigger than I imagined. She's a Blake. The heir?" Richard's voice trailed off in astonishment.

“She lied to Alexander. I wonder if he'll divorce her," James said, his voice tinged with curiosity and concern.

"He won't," Richard replied with certainty. "They signed a contract stating the marriage would end in a year and six months, and it's only been a month. He's too bound by it to break it off now."

"What did you say? A contract?" James's voice rose in surprise. Richard explained the terms, the cold precision of their agreement,and how it had all been set in motion. "That explains a lot. But his behavior last night-that was different,"James continued, his tone reflecting the puzzle pieces he was still trying to fit together. "The Alexander I know wouldn't have acted that way over anyone,let alone a woman."


Sophia exchanged a concerned glance with Richard. "What do you mean?What did you see?"


"Alexander was upset, and not just upset-he was worried about her. He was willing to start a fight with the Blake family just to bring her back home. It's not like him, He never cared this much."

Richard's eyes narrowed. "Should we tell him?" he asked softly.

"I don't think we should," Sophia responded, her voice laced with caution."James made it clear that Lilly's secrets are off-limits."

"What are you two hiding? What is it that Alexander doesn't know?"James interrupted, the question hanging heavily in the air as he realized they had forgotten the phone was on speaker.

Richard sighed deeply, his voice resigned. "Lilly's pregnant. She's carrying Alexander's child."

A stunned silence followed. James finally broke it, his voice full of disbelief."What? That explains everything. No wonder he reacted the way he did."

The pieces were falling into place now. Alexander's cold exterior had cracked, not for Lilly's sake, but for the child growing inside her. But would he truly care for her, or was it all just the weight of responsibility that pulled him in? Lilly had spent the past few days alone in the mansion, trapped by her pregnancy and a rising sense of isolation. Alexander had left for a business trip,leaving her in the silence of their home, with only Clara's visits and her morning sickness for company. Sophia had advised her to stay indoors-this was the critical stage of her pregnancy, after all. But the stillness of her days only made the pressure build. The media buzzed with headlines about her identity,the missing daughter of the Blake family, her marriage to Alexander Kane, and the scandal that had unfolded. The negative comments flooded in from faceless accounts, all fueled by suspicion and judgment. Yet Lilly stayed silent, choosing not to retaliate. It wouldn't stop the rumors. it never did.

Her grandfather hadn't reached out. She hadn't expected himn to.There was nothing shecould say to fix what had happened. The silence between them was suffocating.

Then. as she picked up her bags and headed for the door, she froze. Two bodyguards stood near the entrance. Alexander had left early for his office,so why were they here?

Before she could ask, one of the guards stepped forward, blocking her path.

"What's going on here?" she asked, her tone sharp.

"The boss commanded that we ensure you don't stepoutside," one of them replied coolly.
Lilly's blood ran cold. She had been trapped in the house for days, and now, on the first day she decided to step out,she was stopped.Why?

Her heart raced, a growing sense of dread filling her chest as she realized the truth: Alexander's control over her life was far more absolute than she had ever imagined. And there was more to it-more than she understood.
###Chapter 34

"The boss has ordered us to prevent you from leaving the house."

The guard's words hit Lilly like a wall. Her voice,usually calm,sharpened with irritaion. "When exactly did he give this order?" she demanded.

"Since he left on his trip," came the curt reply.

Lilly blinked in disbelief. It had been over a week since Alexander left, and now, when she finally decided to step out, this? A smoldering anger ignited within her. She had endured days of confinement, morning sickness, and loneliness, all without a word from her husband. Today, she planned to meet Sarah and her friends, a small reprieve from the suffocating solitude. But now, she felt less like a wife and more like a prisoner.

Spinning on her heel, she stormed back upstairs to her room. The walls seemed to close in around her as she grabbed her phone and dialed Alexander. The line rang once before going unanswered. Gritting her teeth,she tried again. This time, the call was picked up-but not by Alexander.

"Hello, this is Alexander Kane's assistant. Who's calling?"

Lilly glanced at her phone, ensuring she hadn't misdialed. No, it was the right number. "Why are you answering Mr. Kane's phone?"
The assistant hesitated. "Ah, Miss Evans-sorry, Miss Blake," he corrected himself awkwardly. "Please put Mr. Kane on the phone," she demanded, her patience wearing thin. The assistant glanced nervously at his boss, who sat across the room, engrossed in his tablet. Alexander's fingers flew over the screen, his expression impassive yet intense.

"Hold on. Miss Blake. I'll check if he's available," the assistant replied.trying to keep his voice steady.

"Sir," he ventured cautiously.

"What is it?" Alexander's tone was clipped, his attention still on the screen.

"It's Miss Evans-er, Miss Blake," the assistant said, stumbling over her name.Since discovering her true identíty as the Blake family heir,addressing her as "Miss Evans" felt inappropriate.

Alexander's hands froze mid-gesture. His cold demeanor betrayed a flicker of something deeper. "Give me the phone," he ordered.

The assistant handed it over without a word.

"What's the purpose of this call?" Alexander's voice was as cold and sharp as steel.

Lilly's heart stuttered at the sound of him. It had been days since they'd spoken, but his voice still had the power to affect her. Could she ever stop loving this man who seemed so determined to remain distant?

"I..." She hesitated, then gathered her courage. "Why am I not allowed to leave the house? I've been cooped up for over a week, and now I find out you've ordered guards to stop me. Am I a prisoner?" Alexander leaned back in his chair, his expression hardening. "You are not leaving the house until I say so." Lilly's frustration boiled over. "You don't get to decide that for me! I'm
leaving today, whether you like it or not."

A muscle in Alexander's jaw twitched.′′Ifyou dare to leave, you'll regret it," he said, his tone laced with menace.

Lilly scoffed. "You're not even here to enforce your threats. Let's see if your guards can stop me."

Alexander's grip on the phone tightened. Her defiance, after all her lies,pushed him to the edge. "Try it, and see what happens," he warned,his voice dangerouasly low.

Without another word, Lilly ended the call.

Alexander stared at his phone, his mind a storm of emotions. Minutes later,it rang again.

"Speak," he barked.

"Sir," came the nervous voice of one of the guards, "Miss Evans has... has left the house."

"Did you touch her?" Alexander demanded,his tone like a whip.

"N-no, sir. She just... walked out," the guard stammered.

"Good. Don't lay a finger on her. I'll handle this myself," Alexander snapped before hanging up. He exhaled slowly, his icy facade cracking slightly. On his tablet, a wealth of information about Lilly lay open-details of her upbringing,her education, and even a long-hidden relationship during her second master's program. The pieces of her life, once obscured, were now clear. And then there were the threats. Her sisters had been murdered, and her identity as the Blake heir put her squarely in the crosshairs of whoever had killed them. The revelation that her life was in danger enraged him.She knew this and still dared to leave.

"James," Alexander barked.

"Yes,boss?"

"Cancel the meeting. We're going home."

James blinked but quickly complied, sensing the storm brewing in his employer's eyes.


Lilly stepped into the crisp air outside the mansion, defying the suffocating grip Alexander had imposed. Each step felt like a small victory, but her triumph was short-lived. The eyes of passersby and whispers in the air followed her, the weight of the public's scrutiny pressing down on her.

She hailed a cab and gave the driver the cafe address. As the car sped away, Lilly tried to ignore the gnawing sensation that she was being watched.


Back at the mansion, Alexander's car screeched to a halt in the driveway.His expression was thunderous as he exited, his usual composure shattered.

"Where is she?" he demanded of the guard at the gate.
 
"She left, sir. Took a cab," the guard replied, trembling. Alexander's jaw clenched. He could track her easily-her movements,her location, everything. But it wasn't just about control. It was about her safety. The threats to her life were real, and her recklessness infuriated him.Lilly arrived at the café, her heart finally settling. She needed the company of friends, a reprieve from the tension that had consumed her life. But even in the warmth of her friends' laughter, she couldn't shake the feeling that she had crossed a line-a line that Alexander wouldn't let her forget.

Meanwhile,Alexander sat in his car outside, his anger simmering.He wouldn't storm in; that wasn't his style. But when she returned home,he would be waiting.

Waiting to remind her that the world she had stepped into was far more dangerous than she realized. And that leaving his protection had consequences-ones she wasn't prepared to face.
###Chapter 35

Lilly wasn't sure what she had expected when she walked into the coffee shop that afternoon, but seeing Michael and Jacob sitting with Sarah was a surprise. The shop was officially closed for the day, yet the familiar space felt like a refuge.

"Lilly!" Sarah greeted her warmly and pulled her into a hug. Michael and Jacob stood to do the same.

"You look stunning, Lilly," Sarah said with a grin. "And is it just me, or have you gained a little weight? Pregnancy suits you."

Lilly blinked, momentarily caught off guard. Her hand instinctively went to her cheeks. "Do I really?"

Sarah nodded enthusiastically.

A soft smile tugged at Lilly's lips as her hand drifted to her still-flat stomach. The idea of carrying Alexander's child was both overwhelming and oddly comforting, a flicker of warmth amidst the chaos.

"This baby will be beautiful." Jacob chimed in, his tone playful yet sincere.
"With parents like you two, it's practically guaranteed.”

Lilly chuckled, picturing a little boy with Alexander's piercing eyes and sharp features. But the lighthearted moment didn't last long. Michael,who had been watching her intently, finally spoke. "Lilly,now that your stepmother and sister know you're alive, you're in real danger.You need to limit your outings and make sure you always have bodyguards with you.Alexander has plenty of them-use them." His words landed like a stone, shifting the mood entirely. "Michael, she's been cooped up for ten days." Sarah interjected, rolling her eyes. "Let her breathe. Don't act like an overprotective brother."

Michael ignored her. "Alexander's estate is massive, practically a small town. You can walk, exercise, even ride horses there without ever stepping outside the gates. You don't need to go out. And, Lilly, you have to tell Alexander everything. He deserves to know the risks, especially with his child involved. You're hiding the truth about your situation, and if something happens, he won't forgive you."

Lilly said nothing. She sipped her coffee, her expression unreadable.

Michael's voice softened. “Lilly, Alexander is the only one with enough power to protect you properly. This isn't about pride or independence.It's about survival."


“He's right." Sarah admitted reluctantly. “Alexander probably already suspects something. He knows about your sisters' deaths and that you were hiding because you were next. Do you really think he'll let you face this alone?"


Lilly's finagers tightened around her cup. Of course, Alexander knew.He always knew more than he let on.


When she finally returned to the estate later that day, her heart sank at the sight of Alexander's sleek black car parked out front. He wasn't supposed to be back so soon. The house seemed unnaturally quiet as she slipped through the front door.Her heart raced as she decided to take the stairs instead of the elevator,hoping to avoid him altogether. She was halfway up when his voice cut through the silence. “Come here."

Her breath hitched. She considered pretending she hadn't heard him but knew it would only make things worse. Slowly, she descended the stairs and made her way toward the living room, plastering a bright smile on her face.

"You're back," she said, her tone light and casual.

Alexander sat in an armchair, his expression cold and unreadable. He motioned for her to come closer.

Lilly hesitated, then moved to the couch across from him.

"Closer," he barked.

Her smile faltered as she reluctantly stood and walked around the coffee table,sitting next to him.

"Closer," he repeated, his voice lower but no less commanding.

Before she could react, he grabbed her wrist and pulled her to her feet.The distance between them vanished, and his grip was firm, almost bruising.

"When I say you're not to leave the house, you obey," he said, his voice cold and deliberate."You are carrying my child, and the world knows who you are. Do you understand the danger you've put yourself in?" Lilly stared at him, her heart pounding. His icy gaze bore into hers, and for the first time, she saw something darker lurking beneath his calm exterior. “Don't make me show you what I'm capable of, Lilly," he warned."You don't want to see that side of me."

A shiver ran down her spine.

He released her wrist abruptly and turned to leave. Lilly cradled her wrist,wincing at the pain. She wanted to hate him for his harshness,but deep down, she knew he was right. She had taken a reckless risk, and the consequences could have been far worse.

The next morning, the tension between them was palpable. Alexander had ordered her to come down for breakfast, and she complied reluctantly. She sat at the table, picking at her food in silence.

He noticed her bruised wrist and frowned."Why didn't you bandage your hand?”

She glanced at him, her expression defiant. “Because I wasn't the one who bruised it," she said simply before returning her attention to her plate.

His jaw tightened. "Finish your food, then go upstairs and change. You're coming with me."

Lilly looked up, surprised."Where are we going?”

Alexander's lips curved into a cold smile. “Aren't you desperate to leave the house?”
###Chapter 36

"Where is he taking me?" Lilly's mind raced with questions as Alexander's command echoed in her ears. He hadn't offered a single clue as to their destination, but one thing was clear-he wasn't going to wait for her to ask more.


"Get ready, I don't have all day.”

The urgency in his voice echoed in her mind as she turned and ascended the stairs, her mind in a whirlwind. What was going on? The past few days had felt like one long blur of confusion and fear. She had barely had time to process the mounting questions about her identity, her marriage,and the mysteries surrounding her sisters' deaths. And now, just when she thought she might get a moment of normalcy, Alexander had pulled her into something even deeper.

In her room. Lilly stood before her wardrobe, trying to decide on an outfit that would fit whatever agenda Alexander had planned. Her heart pounded with unease as she sifted through her options. After a moment's hesitation, she chose a white trouser suit paired with a cream silk blouse.The fabric was light and elegant, yet practical enough for anything.She tucked one side of the blouse into the waistband, giving it a slightly casual but stylish flair. Modest black heels completed the look, and she slung a black Birkin bag over her shoulder. When she caught her reflection in the mirror, Lilly allowed herself a small,almost imperceptible smile. She looked ready for anything, be it a formal meeting or something more casual. But what was Alexander up to? And why did he seem so cold, so unyielding whenever he spoke to her? Her fingers brushed over her bruised wrist-the reminder of their previous encounter-and her mind briefly wandered back to the painful tension between them. Rosa had bought her a bandage the night before, offering to help her, but Lilly had declined. She wanted to handle this herself, even if the physical ache mirrored the emotional turmoil she was carrying. She wasn't ready to give in to him, not yet.

Lilly grabbed the bandage anid carefully wrapped it around her wrist before walking back downstairs. As she entered the dining room,she found Alexander already seated, his eyes buried in a newspaper. He didn't look up as she approached, but she could feel his gaze on her, examining her every move.

"I'm ready," she said, standing at the doorway.

Without looking up, Alexander set the paper down and studied her from head to toe. His gaze lingered on her wrist for a moment.

"Why isn't your wrist bandaged?" he asked, his voice flat.

Lilly held out her hand, the bandage resting in her palm.“Why don't you do it for me, Mr. Kane?” Her words were laced with an edge, her defiance creeping back, despite her lingering fear.

He studied her for a moment longer, then took the bandage from her hand.His fingers brushed against her skin as he wrapped it carefully around her wrist, and Lilly couldn't help but notice how precise his touch was.There was something almost.., intimate abo uit it, though she couldn't quite place why. With her wrist bandaged, Alexander stood, his cold eyes locking with hers."Let's go.” She followed him out to the car, confusion still lingering in her chest. She hadn't expected this, but she couldn't refuse. She could feel the tension between them, thick and palpable, as the bodyguards flanked them on all sides. The world outside felt like a distant dream as they moved through the estate gates and into the streets.

It wasn't until they arrived at the sleek glass building of Alexander's company headquarters that she realized where they were going. Her heart skipped a beat, and she felt a wave of unease wash over her. Of course,he would bring her to work-she was his wife now, after all. But why? What was his endgame? Did he want to show her off, or was he preparing for something darker?


They walked toward the building, the bodyguards creating a protective barrier around them. And then, it happened-reporters appeared out of nowhere, cameras flashing and microphones thrust toward them.

“Mr. Kane is here, and with him is his wife, Lilly Blake," one reporter called out, his voice booming.

Lilly froze, her stomach twisting into a knot. She had been avoiding the media for days now, ever since her identity had been revealed. But now,it seemed, there was no escape. The questions came fast and furious,each one more intrusive than the last.

"Why did you marry Lilly Blake? Was it to unite both families and strengthen their power?" another reporter asked, his voice dripping with suspicion. "Did you marry her to gain your grandfather's property meant for charity?"another added, their wvords cutting deep. But it was the next question that made Lilly's blood run cold.
 "Lilly, why did you disappear after your sisters died? Did you feel responsible for their deaths?"

Her breath caught in her throat. She hadn't expected them to dredge up her past like this. The mention of her sisters-her sisters who had died in such mysteriouis circumstances-was too much. She clenched her jaw and fought to maintain her composure.

"You used a fake name, Lilly Evans, and married Mr. Kane under that alias. Why? Doesn't that make you a fraud?" another reporter shouted,the accusation hanging in the air like a threat.

Lilly's mind spiraled as she tried to keep her emotions in check. But Alexander was quick to act, grabbing her hand and pulling her close as they walked into the building, his bodyguards keeping the reporters at bay.

Inside the elevator, Lilly couldn't help but notice the way their hands were still entwined. She pulled her hand away, her heart beating faster with each passing second.

“Did you know the reporters would be there?" she asked, her voice tight with suspicion.“How did they know I was coming with you unless you told them?”


Alexander's expression darkened. His grip on her hand tightened, forcing her to face him. "What did you just say?" he demanded,his voice low and threatening. Lilly's emotions surged, but she stood her ground. "Why were there suddenly reporters? How did they know?" His eyes narrowed. For a moment, he said nothing, his gaze searing into hers. Then, just as the elevator doors opened,he released her hand and stepped out, waiting for her to follow.

Lilly stood in the elevator, her breath coming in shallow bursts. She didn't want to confront him, not now-not with the tension between them thick and unresolved. But she couldn't ignore the gnawing feeling that something wasn't right.

Finally,she pressed the button for the top floor, her mind racing as the elevator ascended. Was he setting her up? Was this some twisted game he was playing?

The elevator doors slid open, and Alexander was already waiting, his back to her, his hands clenched at his sides.

Lilly stepped out slowly, but before she could make a move, he turned to face her, his expression cold. "Step out," he ordered his voice like ice.

"I don't want to talk to you right now," Lilly snapped, pressing the button for the top floor once again.

But Alexander's piercing gaze never left her as the doors closed between them.

Upstairs, Lilly sat on the rooftop, alone with her thoughts. As she scrolled through the media reports on her phone, her mind wandered to the people who could have orchestrated all of this-the people who had been manipulating her life from the shadows. Her stepmother, her sister-were they behind this?

She dialed Matthew's number. "Hello, ma'am,” Matthew's voice answered. "Matthew," Lilly said, her tone serious. "I need you to find out everything my stepmother and sister have been doing for the past ten days."

"Right away, ma'am. I'll find out if they were involved."

Lilly hung up, taking a deep breath as she looked out at the city skyline.The silence on the rooftop was broken only by the sound of footsteps approaching. She turned to find Alexander standing just a few feet away,his gaze unwavering.

"Who is Matthew?" he asked, his voice low and dangerous. "What are you investigating about your stepmother and sister? You'd better tell me what you've been up to, Lilly."

Lilly's heart skipped a beat. She had hoped to keep this to herself,but now she was trapped, and she knew it. The truth was out-no more hiding. The stakes had never been higher.
###Chapter 37

Kate leaned back in her chair, a grin creeping across her face as she scrolled through the negative comments about Lilly online. The satisfaction in watching her enemy's reputation crumble was almost too much to bear.Lilly had always been the one standing in her way, and now, it seemed,fate had finally started to tip in her favor. The internet was buzzing with scathing remarks, and Kate could hardly believe how easily it was all falling into place. She knew Lilly's return to the family was imminent.Lilly would want to reclaim her position as the heir, and when that happened.Kate had every intention of ensuring she would have nothing but a tarnished name left.

Kate smirked to herself. She had paid a small army of faceless people to post vile comments online. It wasn't hard. People loved a scandal,especially when it involved someone like Lilly. The video of Lilly being hounded by reporters only added fuel to the fire. As she watched, Kate's sense of satisfaction deepened-until her eyes narrowed at the sight of Alexander's hand wrapped possessively around Lilly's. That's when the smile on Kate's face faltered.

Alexander's devotion to Lilly made her stomach churn. But it was only temporary, Kate reassured herself. Alexander would never tolerate a wife with a damaged reputation, not when he valued status and control above all else. Once Lilly's name was completely ruined, it would only be a matter of time before Alexander filed for divorce. Then, everything would fall into place. Still, one thing remained nagging at the back of Kate's mind-what was the real reason behind Alexander's marriage to Lilly? How had they even met? Kate wasn't one to leave a mystery unsolved. She would find the answers, sooner or later. But before she could go deeper into her thoughts, a loud bang on her door made her jump.

"Who dares interrupt me?" Kate muttered, already feeling the weight of irritation mounting. She spun in her chair, only to find her mother, Bella,entering the room with a look that could kill.

"Mother?" Kate's voice dripped with false sweetness. "Why did you barge in like that?"


Bella's glare could've burned a hole through steel. "I warned you to stay out of Lilly's business. I told you I'd handle her, but here you are,going behind my back."

Kate scoffed,crossing her arms.“Did you expect me to sit back and watch while Lilly takes what belongs to me?" Her voice was a venomous hiss,but Bella wasn't phased.

“You think I don't know what you've been up to?" Bella's voice was low,dangerous. “I know you're the one who paid for all those comments, and I know you orchestrated today's little spectacle with the reporters. You've been reckless."

Kate froze, her heart skipping a beat. "What do you mean?"

“Alexander Kane already figured it out. He found out who paid those reporters." Bella's words were like ice, and Kate's blood ran cold."And let me tell you, if I hadn't acted quickly, if I hadn't sent someone to silence the person who blabbed, he'd be coming for you next.” Kate's mouth went dry, her mind racing. If Alexander knew it was her,it was only a matter of time before everything unraveled. “What are we going to do?” she whispered, clutching Bella's hand in panic. Bella's expression softened, but only slightly. “You should be thanking me. I took care of it. But next time, use your brain before you act. If Alexander finds out it was you, you'll be done."

Kate's shoulders sagged in relief. "Thank you, Mother. I don't know what I'd do without you."

Bella patted her daughter's hair lovingly. "We're in this together, Kate.Don't forget that."

Kate leaned into her mother's embrace for a moment, allowing herself to relax. She'd dodged a bullet this time, but she knew this wasn't over.The war was just beginning.

But then Bella's voice broke through her thoughts,sharp and calculating.“By the way, how did you know Lilly would be with Alexander at the company today?”

Kate's lips curled into a smirk. “I didn't know. It just worked out that way. I suppose some things are just meant to fall into place." She couldn't hide the satisfaction in her tone. Seeing Lilly squirm under the weight of public scrutiny had been too perfect.
Suddenly, a thought hit Kate, and she shot her mother a wicked smile.“Mother. I just remembered something important. Lilly married Alexander under a fake name-'Evans.' She lied to him. She's been deceiving him from the start." Bella's eyes narrowed as she processed this new piece of information.“So she's been lying about who she is this whole time. That's interesting...” "I need you to hurry up with the investigation," Kate urged. "If we expose her for that, we can destroy her completely." Bella raised a hand to silence her, "My men are already on it. But Kate. you need to stop making this personal. If you don't want Alexander to see you as Lilly's enemy, try being nice to her for once. You don't want him to see how badly you've been trying to sabotage her. If you play this right,you'll earn your grandfather's approval. Just let me handle the heavy lifting."


Kate didn't like the idea of playing nice with Lilly, but she had no choice.Her mother's words made sense, and for once, she decided to put her personal vendetta aside for a greater goal. “Fine, I'll try. But it won't be easy.”

"Good," Bella said, her voice a low murmur as she walked to the bar and poured herself a drink.

As she took a sip, Kate couldn't help but feel a spark of excitement."Guess what, Mother?" she asked, her voice full of glee.

Bella raised an eyebrow, intrigued. "What?"

"My company has a meeting with Alexander Kane tomorrow. He's considering a partnership with us." Kate's eyes gleamed. “I'll see him tomorrow. This will start as a business relationship, but it will lead to something more. I'm going to make sure of it.”

Bella's lips curved into a knowing smile."Then we should make a toast." Meanwhile, Lilly sat in Alexander's office, her thoughts tangled in knots.The weight of secrets was starting to weigh on her shoulders, but she wasn't ready to tell Alexander the truth. Not yet. Her sisters' deaths were still an open wound, and she wasn't prepared to expose everything. But the more she thought about it, the more she questioned her silence. Was it time to tell him? Would Alexander understand, or would he take matters into his own hands? She glanced at him, lost in thought as he sat behind his executive desk,his focus unwavering. But when he noticed her staring, he didn't look at her with concern. Instead, his expression was cold and calculating.

"The more you delay serving your punishment, the harsher it will be,"Alexander's voice sliced through the silence, pulling Lilly back to the present.


Lilly blinked, caught off guard by his words. She hadn't expected this. She'd thought her punishment would be more severe, but instead, it was this-a simple, mind-numbing task of sorting documents.She could get through this easily. It was nothing compared to the torture her grandfather had put her through as a child. But Alexander's presence, the way he watched her every move, made her feel like a caged animal.

As she worked through the documents, the hours passed by in silence.Alexander left the office for meetings, but his presence lingered in the air,heavy and oppressive. When he returned, the tension in the room was almost unbearable. Lilly could feel his eyes on her, judging her every movement.

At 4 PM, her stomach rumbled-she hadn't eaten all day. The hunger was almost unbearable, but there was no time to think about it. She was still stuck in the office,sorting through piles of paperwork. As she wandered over to Alexander's desk, her gaze fell on a file. Curiosity tugged at her,and before she knew it, she was flipping through its contents. The project was a mess. Flaws at every turn. As she marked the errors in red,she found more and more mistakes until it became clear-this project was a disaster. Lilly quickly scanned the other files, finding the same pattern of incompetence. Only one file was relatively clean, but even that had a minor flaw. She wasn't sureif Alexander would notice-or if he would fire someone on the spot.

Just as she was about to finish marking the final file, the door to the office clicked open. Lilly quickly straightened up and returned to her seat, just as Alexander entered. His eyes immediately flicked to the sorted documents,then to the files on his desk.


"That was fast," he said, his voice laced with skepticism.

"It's not my first time with this kind of task," Lilly replied evenly,though her insides were churning.

Alexander's gaze shifted to the files again, and something about his demeanor changed. His eyes narrowed, and his lips twitched as if he were about to say something.

Before he could, Lilly's stomach gave another growl, louder this time. The sound seemed to cut through the tension, and Alexander's gaze snapped to her.

"Why haven't you eaten yet?" His voice was sharp,almost accusatory.

Lilly couldn't stop herself. “Aren't you the one who put me on punishment?" She shot back, trying to mask the hunger that was clawing at her. "It's entirely your fault that I and your baby are hungry." The words left her lips before she could stop them, and as soon as they did, the room went deathly silent. Alexander's eyes darkened. But before Lilly could make another move, the air between them thickened with unspoken tension. What had she just done?
###Chapter 38

Lilly's eyes sparkled as she gazed at the spread before her, an assortment of dishes she hadn't expected to find in Alexander's office. Seated at a small, hidden diningtable tucked away in a corner of the room, she couldn't help but marvel at the surprise. She hadn't noticed this part of the office before, and it seemed as though Alexander had spent nights here,perhaps alone, before their marriage. A mini kitchen,a resting room-it was an oasis in the midst of his otherwise cold, corporate world.

The scent of the food wafted up, inviting and fragrant, and Lilly felt her stomach settle-no longer churned by nerves. She had grown used to the taste of tension, but now, the warm aroma was a welcome distraction.Alexander made a casual call, and within thirty minutes,the food arrived.

"Why are you just staring at it? Eat," Alexander's voice broke through her thoughts. He sat across from her, flicking through the files she'd marked earlier. She had a sinking feeling he'd seen what she'd written.

Without hesitation, Lilly picked up her utensils and began to eat,savoring each bite. "This tastes amazing," she murmured, her curiosity piqued. "Do you mind telling me where it's from?"

"No," Alexander replied flatly, his eyes glued to the papers before him.

"Why not?" Lilly pouted, her gaze drifting back to the food.

Without missing a beat, Alexander pointed to the markedt-up file. "You did this?" Lilly glanced down, realizing he must have reviewed the documents and noticed the corrections she'd made."Yes. I marked the errors. The one that says 'Redo' needs to be rejected, the 'manageable' one is good but needs work, and the rest need major revisions."

Alexander glanced at the marked file titled "Redo," then back at the one labeled "manageable." His brow furrowed, a small flicker of annoyance crossing his face. "You said this one is manageable?"

Lilly hesitated, unsure of the sudden shift in his demeanor. "Yes, their plan is solid overall, but their cost projections and land requirements are off. It's salvageable with some corrections."

He studied her for a moment before nodding. As much as it irritated him,he had to admit she was right. At first glance, he would have tossedI the projects aside, but she was trying to give the companiesa second chance.However, something about her defense of the 'manageable' company nagged at him. "Do you know whose company this is?" he asked, his voice dropping slightly.

Lilly shook her head, confusion crossing her features. "No, I don't."

"And this one?" Alexander's eyes never left hers as he pointed to the 'Redo'file.

Lilly's eyes darted between the files and his piercing gaze, her pulse quickening. "No," she answered, her voice softer than before.

Alexander's stare lingered for a beat longer than necessary, the tension palpable. He seemed to be weighing her every word, his thoughts unreadable. "Since you want to give them a second chance," he said, breaking the silence, "why don't you attend the meetings with me tomorrow and evaluate the projects yourself? After all, you know exactly where they went wrong." Lilly blinked, taken aback by the unexpected offer. She hadn't expected him to actually involve her in the meetings. But a thrill ran through her at the thought of returning to the world she'd once been a part of-before everything had changed. "I'd love to," she said, her voice light with excitement. "But just so we're cear, I'm not your employee. Is it alright if I speak on behalf of the projects?"

"You'll be acting as a business consultant," he replied coolly,his expression unreadable. "And that's final."


Lilly nodded, a grin forming on her lips. She hadn't expected him to give in so easily. She was eager to get back into the swing of things, to prove that she still had a sharp mind for business, despite the years spent in exile.


"Alright," Alexander said, standing up from the table. "We'll leave in an hour."


Before she could respond, he turned to leave. A question lingered on the tip of her tongue, but the moment he walked out, she dismissed it. There would be time for that later.

An hour later, as they made their way home, Alexander's phone rang. Lilly's curiosity piqued when she heard the word "Grandma" echo through the car. "Grandma," Alexander answered with a polite tone, though Lilly could tell by his voice that he'd already known the conversation would take a predictable turn. "Did Sandra tell you she's finally coming back in three days?" Grandma's voice sounded on the other end, her words sharp and filled with irritation."I can't believe she didn't inform you!" Alexander feigned ignorance. "She is? I dlidn't know."

Grandma huffed. "I'm going to give her a piece of my mind when she returns. You make sure she knows how much she's missed out on!"

Alexander nodded, though he couldn't suppress the smile tugging at his lips. He knew his grandmother well. "Alright,Grandma."

"And how's Lilly?" Grandma continued, the tone of her voice softening. "I've missed her."

Alexander glanced at Lilly, who was looking at him curiously. She could hear every word from the speakerphone, and it was clear that his grandmother had a special place in her heart for Lilly.

"She's fine," Alexander answered, his gaze never leaving Lilly's.

"Is she there with you?" Grandma pressed.

"No," Alexander replied smoothly. "She's at home resting."

"Make sure to pamper her," Grandma warned. "If she ever complains to me,I'll give you an earful!"

The call ended with a chuckle from Alexander,though Lilly couldn't help but smile at the exchange. Grandma Helen always had her back.

Just as the car turned onto the familiar road leading home, Lilly's phone rang, the caller ID displaying a name she wasn't prepared for. "Michael?" Alexander asked, his sharp eyes flicking to her, a subtle edge to his voice. "Who's that?" Lilly's stomach clenched, and she quickly hit 'decline.' "A friend," she said,sending a quick text instead. "A friend?" Alexander's tone darkened. "Explain."

Lilly's heart pounded in her chest as she considered how much to tell him.She had always been upfront about Michael, but the look in Alexander's eyes made her second-guess everything. "We met in school," she began,her voice steady. "He came to the country with me. That's all."


Alexander's expression soured. "HHe left his country and came with you?"

Lilly sighed, growing weary of the questions. "You're still qquestioning me,even after all this time? We agreed not to meddle in each other's lives, but you're doing the exact opposite."


The silence that followed was suffocating. Alexander's gaze turned icy, and for a moment, Lilly felt like she was under fire. The tension thickened.Why was he so bothered by Michael? The question lingered in the air,unanswered.


And then, before she could breathe a sigh of relief, Alexander spoke, his voice low and dangerous.


"I'm going to have James look into him."


Lilly froze, her blood running cold. What was he planning to uncover about Michael? What would he find? The unease in her stomach grew as she wondered how far Alexander would go to control every part of her life.
###Chapter 39

The following day, Lilly dressed with purpose. She slipped into a sleek black pencil skirt that ended just above her knees, the fabric hugging her curves with an elegance that felt powerful yet restrained. Her silk blouse,neatly tucked into the waistband, added a touch of refinement. She finished the look with modest heels, the subtle click of them echoing as she moved. Her hair, pulled into a ponytail, cascaded down her back, a soft.controlled wave. A quick swipe of makeup, just enough to accentuate her features, and she was ready.


Excitement surged within her at the thought of the project consultation meeting ahead. It had been so long since she'd immersed herself in the world of business, and this felt like the perfect opportunity to step back into it.


As she made her way downstairs, she found Alexander at the breakfast table, something unusually hearty in front of him. For once, he was not consuming his usual tea and newspaper, but a substantial meal. Lilly greeted him with a cheerful, "Good morning," but he only nodded in acknowledgment, his attention focused elsewhere. She noticed a flicker of approval in his gaze as he looked her over,clearly pleased with her attire.

After breakfast, a maid quickly served her meal, and they were off to the office. During the drive, curiosity gnawed at her. She didn't know anything about the companies whose projects she would be reviewing. "Mr. Kane," she called,breaking the silence. He glanced at her briefly. "What is it?" "Istill don't know anything about the companies that submitted those projects," she admitted, her voice tinged with uncertainty.

Alexander was silent for a moment, his gaze fixed on the passing scenery outside the window. "You'll be briefed during the meeting," he said, his tone clipped.


Lilly felt a knot form in her stomach. How could she understand the full scope of each company's project in just one meeting? She couldn't remember the abbreviations on the files, nor had she taken the time to look them up the day before. She had failed to prepare.


Upon arrival at the office, they entered through the main entrance for the first time, the lobby filled wvith employees going about their tasks. A few people whispered under their breath as they caught sight of Lilly.

"She's even more beautiful in person," one employee remarked in awe.

"She must have something special to be the heir to the Blake empire,"another added in hushed tones.


Yesterday, they had taken a different route to avoid the media, but today,Alexander walked with confidence, unaware-or perhaps uncaring-of the gazes and whispers following them. Lilly walked at his side, her heels clicking against the polished floor, tho ugh the sting of judgment lingered in the air. Inside the elevator, Alexander remained focused, and Lilly lagged behind,struggling to keep up with his brisk pace. James, walking beside them,noticed the slight delay and turned to her. "Sir, the meeting will start in an hour. Do you want to go to the meeting room or your office first?" Alexander, his gaze sharp and unwavering, stopped, turned to face her.James followed suit, both men seemingly aware of her slower pace. The briefest flicker ofsomething passed through Alexander's eyes, but he remained impassive. He spoke before she could react. "We'll go to the meeting room first."


"We?" James asked, raising an eyebrow, clearly confused.

Lilly smiled faintly at James's surprised expression. She was equally taken aback by the turn of events. "Yes, I'm attending the meeting," she answered, her voice confident, but with a touch of uncertainty beneath it.

James's face showed pure shock. "But... why? You don't even know anything about the projects."

Lilly's smile widened in response to his baffled expression. Before she could say anything else, Alexander's cold voice sliced through the tension."James, I want you to fire every employee who gossiped about us in my presence today. Make sure they never find a job elsewhere."

"Right away, sir," James responded, his voice stiff with compliance.

Lilly's heart skipped a beat. "Why fire them? They didn't say anything bad," she asked, her tone filled with genuine confusion.
Alexander's eyes, hard as steel, met hers for a moment before he answered with chilling detachment. "Let's go." His words were final, leaving no room for argument. Lilly had no choice but to follow, the weight of his command pressing on her chest. Inside the spacious meeting room, Lilly was handed a file with details about the companies they would be meeting with. As she flipped through the documents, reading through the first few entries with interest,something caught her eye. The last two companies were particularly striking-both projects marked in ways that felt far too familiar. Her eyes fell on the first one. ALCorp. She froze. The project she had marked "manageable" was from none other than Albert Lee's company.Her ex-boyfriend. The realization hit her like a wave, and her breath caught in her throat. She glanced up at Alexander, seated at the head of the table, but his gaze was cold,unreadable.

"Is there a problem?" he asked in a voice that sounded deceptively casual,though there was an undercurrent of something more dangerous in his tone. He knew. He had to have known it was Albert's company, yet he still insisted on her attending the meeting.

"Nothing," she said, forcing her voice to remain steady. Her pulse quickened, but she forced herself to focus on the task at hand.

She quickly moved to the last project. Her stomach churned. Blake Real Estate. The project she had marked "Redo." And then it clicked. It was her stepsister's company-the one that had been rushed, the one that lacked attention to detail. Her heart pounded in her chest as she connected the dots. Both companies were tied to her past, and now, she would be expected to evaluate them impartially.

She looked up at Alexander again. He was staring at her, his gaze unwavering. It was as though he was studying her, waiting for a reaction.His eyes flicked briefly to James, and then he spoke, his voice low but clear.
"We'll start with the Blake Real Estate company," he declared,his tone brokering no argument. James,seemingly caught off guard, nodded quickly and motioned to the coordinators. "Please bring Kate and her team in." Lilly's heart thudded in her chest as she watched the door open moments later.Kate entered with a practiced smile on her face, but when her eyes landed on Lilly sitting beside Alexander, her expression faltered.The smile vanished in an instant, replaced by a tense, clenched jaw.

Kate's eyes narrowed, her fists tightening at her sides as she took in the sight of Lilly. What was she doing here? The question was written all over Kate's face, and Lilly could feel the weight of her stepsister's gaze,sharp with something that bordered on hostility.

The tension in the room thickened. Lilly had no idea what Kate was thinking, but she could feel it in the air-the simmering undercurrent of animosity.

And then, just as the silence reached its peak, Alexander spoke, his voice calm but with a dangerous edge. "Let's begin."


Lilly's breath caught in her throat. What would happen next? How would Kate react tothe scrutiny? And, more importantly, what was Alexander really planning by putting Lilly in this position-surrounded by her past,forced to navigate a web of complications she hadn't prepared for?

The stakes had just gotten much higher.
###Chapter 40

The moment Kate walked into the meeting room, her earlier confidence evaporated. Her eyes immediately found Lilly, sitting beside Alexander at the head of the table. Lilly's expression was neutral, her eyes sharp and unreadable as she met Kate's gaze, offering nothing that would betray recognition. The weight of the silence was thick between them.

"Ms. Blake, they're ready for us," Kate's assistant murmured,noting her momentary shock. Kate quickly snapped out of her daze, forcing a smile as she mentally recalled her mother's words: Be cordial with Lilly. Win over her favor,and you win the family.

"Good morning, everyone," Kate began, her voice smooth and professional."I am the CEO of Blake Real Estate, and I'm eager to discuss the potential for a partnership with Kane Realty." She took a moment to let her words sink in, then moved toward the designated seat. The team followed,their eyes briefly flicking to Lilly before they sat down opposite her.

Kate flashed Lilly a bright, calculated smile, her gaze lingering,but Lilly remained stone-faced, her eyes narrowing ever so slightly. The silent tension between them was palpable. Kate then turned her charm on Alexander,who was observing the room with a detached air. Lilly caught it-ahint of something deeper in his eyes, like he was silently scrutinizing the very atmosphere. “Thank you for considering our proposal, Mr. Kane,” Kate continued, her tone purposeful, designed to convey respect yet laced with an underlying hope for approval. She glanced over at him, but Alexander's gaze remained unreadable. His lips only parted to issue a cold, matter-of-fact reply: "Let's wait until your project is reviewed before you thank me." Kate's smile faltered briefly, but she recovered quickly, gesturing for her team to begin the presentation. The lights dimmed as they activated the projector, and the room fell into a focused silence, all eyes on the screen.

Lilly sat back, her posture composed, her attention unwavering. She was completely still, almost too still, but Alexander noticed. She was watching-not just observing, but calculating. After a few minutes, the lights flicked back on, and Kate, feeling the weight of Alexander's silent presence,turned to him.


"What do you think, Mr. Kane?" she asked, her tone now tinged with uncertainty.


Alexander's gaze slid to Lilly, his eyes narrowing with a quiet intensity."What are your thoughts?" he asked, his voice a quiet command that sent a ripple of surprise through the roomn. Kate's smile faltered for a moment,not expecting him to turn the conversation to Lilly so quickly.

Lilly's gaze flicked up to meet Alexander's, and for a heartbeat, time seemed to stretch. She picked up the project file and slid it across the table toward Kate. The sharp sound of paper brushing against the table broke the silence.

Kate glanced down at the file, and immediately, her expression shifted from confusion to recognition. “What's this about?" she asked,her voice strained. "Open it and find out," Lilly replied coolly, her tone so calm it was almost unnerving. The room held its breath as everyone watched the exchange-this was more than just business now. This was personal. Kate's fingers trembled slightly as she flipped open the file. Her face drained of color as she scanned the pages. Red marks. The bold “Redo" stamped at the end of the last page. "How dare you?"she muttered under her breath. The irritation boiled in her chest, but she masked it quickly.

"This project is a mess," Lilly said, her voice dripping with scorn.′′Ilacks proper planning, and the presentation only made it worse. You should be embarrassed," she added, her eyes cold.

Kate fought to keep her composure, but the anger was evident in her clenched jaw. She turned toward Alexander, desperate to salvage something. "Mr. Kane," she began, her voice more measured but tight with frustration. "Our company has a stellar record, numerous successful government projects. You can trust us."

Lilly's laughter, sharp and unexpected, rang out, slicing through Kate's words like a blade. The room stiffened at the sound, and even Alexander's expression flickered with a hint of curiosity.

"Trust you?" Lilly said, her voice dripping with irony. “Don't you even know how the Blake empire works? And you think you can just waltz in here,presenting something this flawed, and expect us to take you seriously?"She leaned forward, her eyes narrowing. “Didn't our grandfather tell you that those 'stellar' projects were approved by me-and my late sisters?”

The silence that followed was suffocating. Kate's face twisted in disbelief,her hands shaking with barely restrained rage. The room seemed to shrink under the weight of the unspoken challenge. Alexander, ever the observer.watched the drama unfold with his usual detachment, but even he couldn't ignore the tension cr ackling between the two women. Kate tried to salvage her dignity, her voice now clipped and defensive."Grandfather had many consultants," she shot back, her words biting. "What makes you think it was your work?" Lilly's eyes darkened, the calmness in her expression now laced with something dangerous. "You still don't understand, do you?" she said quietly, her voice almost a whisper. "I am the heir. I'm the one who mnade those decisions. And if you're still questioning it, maybe you should do your homework."


The room froze. Kate's lips parted, her retort dying on her tongue. She wanted to argue, to find a way to turn the tables, but the facts were laid bare, and they weren't in her favor. Lilly had just crushedI any hope of salvaging her reputation at that moment.

"This is your first project, and it's a failure," Lilly continued, her voice calm but final. "I'm disappointed. What do you think Grandfather would say about this?"


Kate's face turned a shade of crimson. The room held its collective breath,waiting for her to snap. But she didn't. She clenched her fists, her shoulders stiff witha humiliation. She knew she had lost.

But Lilly, in a rare moment of grace, offered a lifeline. "I'll give you a second chance," she said, her tone surprisingly gentle. "Draft a new contract, and if it meets my standards, I'll approve it."

Alexander's gaze shifted to Llly, a small glimmer of admiration flickering in his eyes. He remained silent, but his approval was clear.Kate,seething,could hardly contain her rage, but she had no choice but to nod in reluctant agreement.


"Fine," Kate spat, her voice low. "But this isn't over." With that, she stormed out of the room, her heels clicking loudly on the polished floor, a thunderous declaration of her fury. As soon as the door slammed shut behind her, Lilly leaned back in her chair,exhaling slowly. She had expected resistance, but the venom in Kate's reaction had caught her off guard.


Out in the hallway, far from the meeting room. Kate was a different person."We have a chance to redo it. We should be grateful," she muttered to herself, her hands cleniched into fists. But the fury didn't fade. It only grew.


She turned to her team, her voice low but seething. "It was my sister,not Mr. Kane! She plans to humiliate me again-again! But this time, I'll make sure she knows her place."


Her smirk was cold, calculating. "You won this time, Lilly," Kate wvhispered,her voice a promise, "But next time... I'll be the one in control."


And as she walked away, the echoes of her words hung in the air, an ominous reminder that the battle between them was far from over
###Chapter 41

"Sir, the next company on the agenda is the STH Company. Should I call them in?”


Alexander Kane leaned back in his chair, his gaze cold and calculating."No," he said after a pause, his tone sharp."Call in GLX instead."

Lilly Blake, seated nearby, glanced up at Alexander, startled by his abrupt decision. His expression revealed nothing of his thoughts, leaving her in the dark about what he was planning.

In a waiting room down the hall, Albert Lee and his team were caught off guard by the sudden summons. Confusion flickered across Albert's face.They had been told they were last on the schedule. Why the sudden change? Dismissing his unease, Albert gathered his team and strode confidently toward the meeting room.

As the heavy doors swung open, the atmosphere inside was instantly stifling. Albert scanned the room, his professional smile faltering as his eyes landed on Alexander Kane, seated at the head of the table with an air of undisputed authority. Beside him sat Lilly, posed and unreadable.

Albert's stomach churned. Seeing Lilly there was a shock. The last time they had spoken, she had been somneone entirely different-or so he had thought. Discovering her identity as the sole heir of the Blake empire through the media had left him reeling. If only he'd known the truth back then, he wouldn't have severed their ties so easily. Suppressing his emotions, Albert introduced himself and his company,outlining their eagerness to collaborate with Kane Corporation. His words flowed smoothly, but his confidence wavered under Alexander's piercing stare. When the presentation ended. Albert turned to Alexander for feedlback,only for the man to shift his gaze to Lilly. “What do you think?”Alexander asked, his tone deceptively calm.


Albert stiffened, his confusion deepening.Was Lilly the decision-maker here?


"In today's meeting," Alexander said, his voice cutting through the tension like a blade, "my wife will be evaluating and decidling on your project."

The words struck Albert like a blow.*Mywife.* The phrase echoed in his mind, leaving a bitter taste. He masked his discomfort,nodding respectfully.“Understood.”

Lilly's heart racedat Alexander's deliberate acknowledgment of her. Was this for Albert's benefit, or was there something deeper at play? She forced a polite smile, her gaze briefly meeting Albert's before shiftingto Alexander,whose icy stare sent shivers down her spine.

Maintaining her composure, Lilly addressed Albert.“Your presentation was well-prepared, and I've reviewed your project proposal. It's a commendable effort."

Albert's relief was short-lived as Lilly continued. “However, there's a critical issue that needs to be addressed.”

Albert leaned forward, his unease returning."What issue?" Lilly pointed to a section in the document. "Your cost and land calculations for the resort in the east are inaccurate. The proposed budget and space allocation are insufficient to meet the project's needs." Albert frowned, quickly reviewing the section. The errors were glaring.How had they missed this? "You're right," he admitted reluctantly.“What do you suggest?"

"Find a different location and revise your calculations." Lilly said evenly.

Albert hesitated. “Does this mean we'll have another chance to present?"

Before Lilly could respond, Alexander interjected, his tone frigid.“That won't be necessary."

The room fell silent, the weight of Alexander's words sinking in.

“Mr. Albert Lee.” Alexander said, his voice devoid of emotion,“Kane Corporation will not be partnering with your company. You have ten minutes to vacate the premises."

Albert's jaw tightened in disbelief.“But-”

Alexander stood abruptly, his chair scraping against the floor as he exited the room, leaving no room for negotiation. James, his assistant, followed in his wake.


Lilly hurried after them, her heels clicking against the polished floor.She caught up to James. “Where is he going?”

"His office," James replied, his expression unreadable.

Inside his office, Alexander issued swift orders.“Cancel the remaining meetings. Return their project plans and inform them we're not moving forward.”


James hesitated. “But sir, they're already-"


Alexander's glare silenced him."And one more thing. Ensure no company partners with GLX." James stared at him, stunned. Alexander wasn't just rejecting Albert; he was dismantling his business. Was this about Lilly's past with Albert?

"You're still here?" Alexander's sharp tone jolted James.

"Right away, sir." James said, retreating quickly.

In the hallway, he crossed paths with Lilly. "Is he inside?"she asked.

James nodded."Yes,ma'am."

Lilly stepped into the office, her expression stormy. Twenty minutes later.she emerged, her frustration palpable. She headed to the ground floor,her pace brisk.


As she reached the curb to hail a taxi, a sleek black car pulled up beside her. The tinted window rolled down,revealing a familiar face.

"Mr. Victor?"she asked, surprised.

"Your grandfather requests your presence." he said smoothly.

“For what reason?”

“You'll find out soon enough," Victor replied.


Lilly hesitated, glancing back at the towering building before clmbing into the car. Meanwhile, Alexander stood on the rooftop, the wind whipping around him. His eyes scanned the city below as his mind raced. Unable to find her,he checked the security footage, his expression darkening as he watched her leave in the black car. A storm of emotions surged within him. Memories long buried resurfaced, and a chilling thought crossed his mind. Was history repeating itself?
###Chapter 42

Alexander's office was a chaotic whirlwind of tasks, but his mind was elsewhere. The stack of files on his desk blurred into irrelevance as his thoughts circled around Lilly. Knowing that Caleb Blake's men had taken her didn't ease his anxiety. He could picture her grandfather's stern face,his words slicing through the airlike a blade. What was Caleb planning?Why had he summoned her so suddenly?

Unable to suppress the unease tightening in his chest, Alexander pushed back his chair and stood abruptly. He grabbed his jacket, ignoringthe blinking notification on his laptop about an upcoming critical meeting.

James entered just as Alexander was storming out, abundle of files clutched to his chest. "Boss, are you leaving?"

"Yes." Alexander snapped without breaking stride.

“But-there's an important meeting in an hour," James protested,his voice rising with panic. Alexander never canceled meetings, let alone one so crucial.


"Cancel it." His tone was sharp,final.

James gaped, frozen in shock."Huh?"

Alexander stopped, turning his steely gaze on James. "I said, *cancelit∗!His voice rose, laced with impatience. James swallowed hard and bowed slightly,"Y-yes,boss." Without another word, Alexander strode past him, his demeanor stormy.Watching him leave, James muttered to himself, "Miss Blake must be involved in this. She's the only one who can shake him like this." Despite his boss's foul mood, James couldn't help but feel a flicker of curiosity. Alexander Kane, the man known for his impenetrable composure.seemed to be unraveling.





Lilly sat stiffly in the backseat of a black car as it wove its way through remote roads. The urban skyline gradually gave way to a quiet. forested landscape.The car finally stopped in front of a secluded inn, its stone fac ade blending into the surroundings.


Victor, her grandfather's trusted aide, opened the door and gestured for her to step out. "This way, Miss Blake."


She followed him through the inn's dimly lit corridors, flanked by silent guards. They stopped in front of a heavy wooden door. Victor knocked once, then pushed it open, revealing a modest room. A tea set rested on a polished oak table, steam curling from a fresh pot. Seated at the head of the table was Caleb Blake, the patriarch of her family. Though in his seventies, his piercing gaze and commanding presence made him seem decades younger.


"Good day, Grandfather," Lilly greeted, bowing respectfully.

Caleb studied her for a moment before gesturing to the chair opposite him.“Sit. You shouldn't remain standing too long."

His cryptic comment made her pause. Did he know? Shaking off the thought,she complied, lowering herself into the seat.

"Have some tea," Caleb instructed, pouring her a cup, "Last time you refused to join me. This time, you won't.”

Lilly wrapped her hands around the delicate porcelain, taking a small sip."
Grandfather, you sent for me."

"Mmm," he nodded. his sharp eyes nartowing slightly. "Tell me.child.what's on your mind?"


His question caught her off guard. "Nothing, Grandfather. I was just thinking."


Caleb leaned forward, his gaze penetrating."Is there something you need to tell me?"


"No... There's nothin-"


The loud *bang* of Caleb's hand slamming against the table cut her off.Lilly flinched,her teacup trembling in her hands.


⋯∗Ncthing?!*”he thundered. "How about explaining why you're pregnant and didn't think to inform your grandfather?"

Lilly's heart stopped. Her hands froze mid-air, the teacup slipping from her fingers and clattering onto the table. "How... How did you-?"


Caleb's sharp laugh carried no warmth."You should know better than to underestimate me. Lilly.”


Shame washed over her as she lowered her gaze. Of course, he would know.Caleb Blake's network was legendary, his reach extending into places most could only dream of. "And that's not all." His voice was laced with fury now. "How dare you sign a contract with that man to have a child-and then leave the child with him? Have you lost your mind?" The room felt like it was closing in on her. Lilly dropped to her knees before him,her voice trembling. "Grandfather, please forgive me. I didn1't-,,


“Didn't *what*, Lilly? Didn't think I would find out?" Caleb's voice softened, but the disappointment in his tone cut her deeper than any yell.“I raised you to be strong, to value yourself. And yet, you willingly bound yourself to a devil like Alexander Kane?"


“Grandfather,he's not-”


"Don't you dare defend him," Caleb barked, his fist slamming down once more.“Do you even know who that man truly is? The things he's done?"


Lilly stared up at him, her lips parting to respond but no words coming out: What was he talking about? Her mind reeled with confusion.She loved Alexander despite his flaws. But now, staring at the anger etched into her grandfather's face, she wondered if there was something she didn't know.


“You think he's some tortured soul, don't you?” Caleb's voice dropped,almost to a whisper. "That he can be saved by love?" He leaned closer,his expression dark. “He's a man who destroys everything he touches.And you're willingly giving him my great-grandchild?”

Lilly's stomach churned.“Grandfather,please-”

“No!” Caleb interrupted, standing abruptly. His towering figure cast a shadow over her.“You will tell me everything now."
###Chapter 43

Lilly's mind swirled with unanswered questions. Her grandfather's cryptic warnings rang in her ears.there something I should know about Alexander?"* she had asked earlier, desperate for clarity. Caleb's pained expression hinted at the weight of a truth he was hesitant to reveal.

Before Caleb could respond, the door to the room swung open wwith force.Both Lilly and her grandfather turned to see Alexander stride in, his presence commanding as always. His sharp gaze immediately landed on Lilly, kneeling on the cold floor, her delicate frame visibly tense.

Alexander's frown deepened. He crossed the room in long,purposeful strides and pulled Lilly to her feet, his touch firm but not unkind. “Never kneel on the cold floor, especially not when you're carrying my child,"he said, his voice low yet authoritative.


Lilly instinctively pulled away from his grasp, her confusion mounting.Alexander's frown tightened as he caught her wrist again, refusing to let her retreat. Yet, her eyes remained fixed on her grandfather,seeking answers that seemed just out of reach.

"You scoundrel," Caleb spat, his voice dripping with disdain as he addressed Alexander. "Are you here to exploit my granddaughter further?" Lilly's chest tightened. She stood between two men who clearly knew more than they were letting on. Her grandfather's animosity toward Alexander,coupled with Alexander's unreadable demeanor, created a storm of tension that left her uneasy. Alexander, as usual, ignored Caleb's ire, his focus solely on Lilly. “I need to speak with your grandfather. Alone." His words were curt, leaving no room for debate. Lilly hesitated, glancing between them, but Alexander's expression softened just enough to prompt her to nod reluctantly.

As she stepped out of the room, her heart felt heavy. Outside,she found Victor and Max waiting by the cars. Both men greeted her respectfully,their presence a stark reminder of the dangerous world she had unknowingly stepped into.

"Max,open the car door for her," Alexander's voice carried through the open doorway, a subtle command that left no room for disobedience. Max moved swiftly to open Alexander's sleek black car, but Lilly shook her head and walked toward the car she had arrived in. Max, though puzzled,silently complied.

Inside the car, Lilly's thoughts raced. *Why did Grandfather call Alexander a devil? What is he hiding from me?* Her mind darted to the possibility of Alexander's underworld connections, something her grandfather had alluded


to in hushed warnings. She tried to dismiss the thought, but it clung to her like a shadow. If there was any truth to it, what had she gotten herself into?


Minutes stretched into an hour, and her impatience grew. Finally, she rolled down the window and called out to Victor, who stood a few paces away. "Uncle," she said softly, using the term of endearment she and her sisters had always called him.


Victor approached with a slight bow. "Yes, young miss?” "How long have they been talking?" "It's been over an hour now," he replied, glancing toward the inn. She frowned, her unease deepening, "Do you think something's wrong?"Victor hesitated, choosing his words carefully. "Discussions between them are rarely peaceful, but I wouldn't worry. Alexander... has his ways of handling things."


Lilly wasn't convinced."Did you bring anything to eat?" she asked,trying to change the subject and ease the knot in her stomach.


“I did, but I didn't think you'd want to eat in this situation," he admitted.
"Would you like me to bring you something?"

She shook her head. "No, I'll wait.”


Victor's concern lingered, but he nodded and returned to his post. As Lilly leaned back in her seat, the door to the inn opened. Alexander stormed out,his jaw set in anger, followed by Caleb, whose face was a mixture of frustration and resignation.

Victor sighed audibly. "As I said,it didn't end well."


Alexander scanned the area, his eyes narrowing when he didn't immediately spot Lilly in his car. "Where is she?" he snapped at Max.

Max gestured toward the other car.“Ma'am chose to wait in her car."

Alexander's irritation was palpable as he strode over to her, pulling the door open with sharp precision. “Let's go,"he said, his tone leaving no room for argument. Lilly hesitated, her own frustration rising,but she knew better than to defy him in front of everyone. He took her hand, his grip firm but not harsh, and led her to his car.Without a word, he helped her in, then followed, slamming the door shut behind him. “Drive," he commanded the driver, and the car sped off. Back at the inn, Caleb watched them leave, his expression conflicted. Victor approached him cautiously. "Master, did you come to an understanding?"

Caleb shook his head. "Not quite. But I've decided one thing-I won't be the one to tell her. She's smart; she'll figure it out. It's Alexander's responsibility now."

Victor frowned. "Do you trust him to protect her?"

Caleb sighed deeply. "I didn't, but today, I saw something in him. He may not realize it himself, but he cares for her. Perhaps more than he even understands."

Victor nodded, his own doubts somewhat eased."Then we can only hope she made the right choice."

As they got into their car anddrove away, a dark sedan parked discreetly nearby sprang to life. Inside, a man spoke into a phone. “They're on the move.”


“Good,"” came the cold voice on the other end."Continue to monitor her closely.”

“Yes, ma'am," the man replied before hanging up and driving off in the opposite direction.




In a luxurious penthouse, Bella set her phone down with a satisfied smirk.Beside her, Kate sipped her wine, her eyes gleaming with malice. "Did your men confirm they're keeping an eye on her?" Kate asked,her voice dripping with venom. "They're watching her every move,”Bella assured, her tone icy. "Lilly will no longer humiliate you-or stand in our way. Soon,she'll be gone for good."

Kate's lips curled into a wicked smile. "I can't wait to see her suffer."

Bella raised her glass. “Patience, my dear. Her downfall is already in motion.”


Their laughter echoed through the room. a chilling prelude to the storm brewing for Lilly.
###Chapter 44

The ride home was steeped in a tense silence. Lilly stared out the window.her mind a whirlwind of questions that gnawed at her resolve. Her grandfather's ominous words rang in her ears: *“You don't truly know him."* She stole glances at Alexander, his expression unreadable, his eyes fixed ahead as if the tension between them didn't exist.

When the car stopped in front of the estate, Lilly pushed the door open before the driver could reach her, stepping out into the cool night air.She didn't wait for Alexander and headed straight for the house, her heels clicking sharply against the marble steps. Behind her, she heard his measured footsteps quicken, and before she could ascend the grand staircase,he caught her wrist.


"Stop," he said, his voice low and firm.

She turned to face him, her expression challenging.“What now?”

Clara appeared at the doorway, her usual warm greeting stilled by the palpable tension. She gave a quick nod and retreated with the other maids,their whispers trailing behind them.


Alexander's gaze was unrelenting.“Do you have something to ask me?"

Lilly hesitated, but the weight of her unanswered questions tipped her resolve.“Yes. Why did my grandfather sa y I don't truly know you? WVhat haven't you told me?" His lips pressed into a thin line before he spoke. "Follow me." Her stomach churned at his tone. He led her to the elevator, the air around them thick with unspoken truths. Lilly's brow furrowed as he pressed a 
button she hadn't noticed before-one marked only with a small symbol.


“There's an underground floor?" she asked.

"You'll see," was all he said.


The elevator descended, the hum of machinery filling the oppressive silence.When the doors slid open, the darkness beyond was almost suffocating.


“It's pitch black," she murmured, taking an uneasy step forward.

"Lights on," Alexander commanded, his voice cutting through the void.

The basement was suddenly awash in bright, sterile light. Lilly's breath hitched as she took in the sight before her: a pristine white corridor leading to a glass door.


"What's behind that door?" she asked, her voice barely above a whisper.


“You'll find out soon enough." His tone was calm, but the edge in it sent a shiver down her spine.


He placed his hand on the biometric scanner, and the door unlocked with a soft click. As it swung open, the lights inside flickered on, revealing an arsenal that made Lilly's blood run cold. A shooting range stretched out before her, its walls lined with glass cases displaying an array of weapons,from sleek pistols to intimidating rifles. Her voice wavered as she asked, "Why do you have this here?" Alexander's response was unsettling in its simplicity. "To clear my head." She stepped inside cautiously, the cold tile beneath her feet amplifying the chill creeping up her spine. Her eyes roamed over the guns,her mind flashing back to the few shooting lessons she'd taken for sport. But this was different. This was calculated. Dangerous.


Turning to face him, she asked the question that had been building in her mind since their conversation with her grandfather. "Are you involved in the underworld?”


Alexander's gaze darkened, his eyes locking onto hers with an intensity that made her want to retreat. Instead, she stood her ground, even as his silence became deafening.


"Yes," he finally admitted, the word hanging in the air like a thunderclap.

Lilly's breath caught. She had suspected as much, but hearing him confirm it was a different matter entirely. Her grandfather's warnings about the devil in disguise echoed in her mind. Yet, here he was, openly admitting the truth-a truth that could shatter everything she thought she knew about him.


"Why are you telling me this now?" she asked, her voice trembling.


“Because you deserve to know what you've signed up for,"he said,his tone unreadable. "And because I don't hide from the people I care about."


The admission took her by surprise. Was this his way of saying he cared for her? Or was it a calculated move to earn her trust? Lilly couldn't tell.


The weight of it all became too much. She tuarned to leave, needing space to process what she'd just learned, But Alexander's hand shot out,grabbing her wrist. "Where are you going?"

“To clear my head," she said, echoing his earlier words. He studied her for a moment before letting her go. “Don't leave the house,”
he said firmly.

"I won't," she assured him. "I'll be in my room."

For the next five days, they barely spoke. Lilly avoided their shared meals,timing her routines to avoid crossing paths with him. But Alexander noticed. He always noticed.


One evening, after her bath, she emerged to find him sitting on her bed.his phone in hand. Startled, she froze, clutching the towel wrapped around her body. His eyes lifted to meet hers, sweeping over her in a way that sent heat rushing to her cheeks.


Embarrassed, she grabbed her clothes and retreated back into the bathroom,her heart pounding. *What is he doing in my room?* she wondered.His gaze lingered in her mind, a mix of something unreadable but undeniably intense.


When she finally stepped out, dressed and composed,he stood,closing the distance between them. "Where are you going?"he asked, his voice low.


"To meet my grandfather," she replied, hoping he wouldn't press further.

“And your antenatal appointment?" he asked, surprising her. “It's today,isn't it?”


“Yes, I'm going," she said, thrown by his attention to detail.

He nodded but didn't move. “Are you avoiding me?” “What?”she stammered. “You've been avoiding me for five days," he said, his voice tinged with frustration. "That stops now. From today, you'll have breakfast and dinner with me. No more excuses."

Lilly blinked, caught off guard by his sudden demand. But beneathn his stern words,she saw something else-something that looked almost like longing. Her heart softened despite herself.

"Fine," she said quietly. “But I'm not avoiding you out of dislike. I just needed time to process...everything."

Alexander's eyes softened for a moment before he stepped closer,his hand brushing her waist. "You signed up for this, Lilly. You don't get to walk away just because it's difficult."


She looked up at him, her heart pounding. “I'm not walking away," she whispered."I just need you to meet me halfway."


His eyes flicked to herlips, and before she could say another word, he kissed her-deep, possessive, and unapologetic. In that moment, all the doubts, fears, and questions faded into the background.
###Chapter 45

The kiss lingered in Lilly's thoughts, a heady mix of surprise and confusion. When they finally broke apart, her breath hitched, her cheeks a deep crimson. Alexander's piercing gaze locked onto hers, unreadable yet intense, as though he was unraveling her every thought. The room felt too small, the air thick with unspoken words.

He finally broke the silence. "I've arranged for a driver and a bodyguard to accompany you from now on," his voice steady,yet holding an edge of command.


Her brow furrowed. "A new driver?"

"Yes. You won't be leaving or returning alone anymore. Your safety is non-negotiable."


She nodded slowly, unsure whether to feel reassured or alarmed.

"When you're done with your errands, head to the family residence tonight."he added.


Her heart skipped. "The family residence? Is Grandma okay?" Concern laced her voice; Alexander rarely mentioned family unless it was significant.


He tilted his head, his expression softening just enough to stir unease. "Sandra arrives this afternoon. Grandma's hosting a welcome party for her.She expects you there." "Will you be there?" she ventured cautiously, her voice almost a whisper. His lips curved slightly, the ghost of a smirk.'′′Dyou want me there?" Caught off guard, she hesitated before retorting, "Isn't she your sister?Shouldn't yoube welcoming her home?"

"Mmm," he hummed, his fingers finally releasing her waist.She hadn't even noticed how firmly he'd been holding her until his absence left her cold. The sudden space between them felt unbearable.

Alexander leaned in, brushing his hand through her hair,his fingers twisting a strand before letting it fall. His eyes held a promise, or perhaps a warning. "Be good," he murmured before turning and walking away,leaving her standing there, her heart racing.

Lilly pressed her palm to her chest, then her lips, the memory of his touch still warm. It wasn't their first kiss, but it felt unlike any before-raw,purposeful, and completely disarming.




Descending the grand staircase, Lilly noticed a sleek black car parked at the entrance. Two men stood by it, both unfamiliar. The bodyguard opened the door with a precise, almost militaristic bow.

"Good morning, ma'am. I'm Pedro, your new bodyguard," he said, his voice deep and clipped. He was tall, dark, and imposing-an unmistakable air of authority about him. She nodded, her gaze shifting to the driver, who introduced himself as Samuel. His build was equally intimidating. Alexander wasn't taking chances,it seemed. "To the hospital," she instructed. "Yes, ma'am," Samuel replied as Pedro took the front passenger seat,his eyes scanning their surroundings with hawk-like precision. At the hospital, Lilly knocked lightly on Dr. Sophia's door before stepping inside. The doctor greeted her warmly, her face lighting up.

"Good morning, Mrs. Kane," Sophia teased, the title making Lilly's cheeks flush.


"You look radiant today," Sophia noted, her observant eyes narrowing. "Wait-what's this glow? Spill it."

Lilly hesitated, recalling the way Alexander's kiss had left her breathless."I'll tell you when I'm sure," she hedged.

"Sure about what?" Sophia pressed, her curiosity piqued.

"About Alexander," Lilly admitted quietly, a faint smile betraying her thoughts.

Sophia's eyes widened, practically dragging Lilly to the couch."He did something, didn't he?"


Lilly sighed, nodding. "He kissed me this morning," she confessed,her voice barely above a whisper.

Sophia gasped, clasping Lilly's hands. "Finally! What did you do?"

"I told him my feelings hadn't changed," Lilly said, the memory of his response sending a shiver down her spine. Sophia beamed. "And this is Alexander we're talking about? The same man who avoids emotions like the plague? Oh, Lilly, this is huge!" Lilly's heart warmed at her friend's enthusiasm but tempered her excitement. "He also ordered me to eat with him every day," she said, unsure whether to view it as affection or control.

"For him, that's practically romantie." Sophia quipped.




By early afternoon, Lilly found herself standing in front of Blake Headquarters. The towering building loomed over her, a stark reminder of her family's legacy. As she stepped inside, employees and directors scrambled to greet her, their deference almost suffocating.

"Miss Blake, welcome," one of the directors said, bowing.

Lilly responded with a curt nod, allowing them to escort her to the 20th-floor meeting room. Her grandfather's presence dominated the room,seated at the head of the table. Beside him sat her father, his expression a calculated mix of authority and pride.

"Grandfather," she greeted respectfully before turning to her father with a professional nod.


Her eyes swept the room, landing on Kate at the far end. Her half-sister's frown was as sharp as a dagger. Ignoring Kate's obvious discontent. Lilly took her seat beside her grandfather, her posture regal yet unyielding.

"Let's begin," she said, her voice steady, carrying the weight  of someone who knew her place in the family hierarchy. But beneath the surface, tension simmered. In a family like theirs, every meeting was a battlefield, every move calculated. Lilly braced herself,knowing that this was only the beginning.
###Chapter 46

"This initiative will not succeed," Lilly declared, her voice cold and sharp as she uncapped a red pen. With a single, deliberate stroke,she scrawled the word FAIL across the cover of the project document. The sound of the folder hitting the table echoed through the boardIroom,leaving an uncomfortable silence in itswake.


The tension was palpable. Every pair of eyes darted toward her, disbelief etched on their faces.


Peter Blake leaned forward, his gaze narrowing at his daughter. "I already sanctioned that project. On what grounds do you believe it will fail?" His voice was calm, but there was an undercurrent of irritation. This wasn't what he had expected when he insisted she oversee the project sign-off.

Lilly met his eyes with an unwavering stare, her demeanor exuding authority far beyond her years. "Do you want my honest assessment,or are we here to rubber-stamp failures?"

Peter flinched slightly, caught off guard by her boldness. Around the room.whispers began to ripple as the directors exchanged uneasy glances. Kate,standing off to the side, clenched her fists, her nails digging into her palms.The disrespect! Did Lilly even comprehend the months of effort their father had poured into this? "How dare you dismiss a project without proper justification?" one of the senior directors challenged, his voice trembling with barely concealed indignation. Lilly turned to him, her expression unreadable. "Let me ask you this-did you personally inspect the rural area where you plan to build, or did you rely on a glossy pitch deck and online research?" The director's face flushed as he stammered, "The team-uh, they assured me一


"Exactly as I thought," Lilly cut him off, her voice icy. "You approved a multimillion-dollar project based on assumptions."


She turned back to Peter, her voice dropping into a tone laced with disappointment. "Mr. Blake, as the president, isn't it your responsibility to scrutinize proposals? Or have you delegated that duty entirely to complacency?"


The room fell silent as the weight of her words sank in. Peter's jaw tightened, a flicker of hurt crossing his face. She had called him*Mr.Blake,* not *father.* Not since... the incident.

"How can you be so sure the project will fail?" Peter demanded, his voice low but strained. "You haven't even visited the site yourself."

Lilly exhaled slowly, her patience wearing thin. "Because I *did* my research," she said, her tone laced with quiet defiance. "If you send a team for a proper inspection, they'll find what I already know-this land is a disaster waiting to happen. Frequent natural calamities. Unstable terrain.Build a resort there, and you're not just wasting money. You're inviting ruin."


A wave of murmurs spread through the room. Kate looked like she was ready to explode, but even she couldn't deny the doubt creeping into her mind.

 Peter, however, was silent, his gaze fixed on his daughter. Could she be right? She had always been sharp,but this? Lilly didn't wait for further questions. "I suggest you verify my findings before proceeding. Until then, consider this project dead." With that,she gathered her papers and strode out, her heels clieking against the marble floor like a gavel delivering judgment.

As the doors closed behind her. Peter's father-who had been silently observing-allowed a small, approving smile to curve his lips. She's ready.*he thought.




Lilly walked briskly down the hall, her mind swirling with unspoken emotions. She barely noticed her father's voice calling after her until his hand caught her arm.


"Lilly," Peter began, his tone softer now.


She turned slowly, her expression guarded. "Is this about the project? I've said all I needed to say."

"No," Peter replied, shaking his head. "It's about u1s."

Her jaw tightened. "What about us?"

"I... I want to fix this," he said, his voice tinged with desperation. "I want us to go back to the way things were. Before... everything." His words faltered, his eyes searching hers for any sign of warmth. Lilly's lips curled into a bitter smile. "Go back? To what? To when you broke our hearts by remarrying so quickly after Mom died? Or to when you prioritized Brenda over your own daughters? Tell me, *Mr. Blake,*which part of the past are you so desperate to return to?" Peter flinched as if struck. "Lilly, please. I know I made mistakes,but-" "But nothing," she interrupted, her voice trembling with suppressed anger."You want to fix things? Start by finding the people who killed my sisters."Her voice cracked, betraying the depth of her pain.

"Lilly,I-"

"Don't," she snapped, stepping back. "You can't undo what's been done.And you can't make me forget."


With that, she turned and walked away, her steps heavy with emotion.Peter stood frozen, his heart aching as he watched her retreating figure.





By the time Lilly arrived at the family residence, exhaustion had settled over her. The glowing "Welcome Back Home" banner hanging over the entrance felt almost mocking.


"Welcome, ma'am," Camila greeted, bowwing slightly.

"Good evening, Camila," Lilly replied with a faint smile, her eyes scanning the bustling house.

"She's here early," Grandma Helen's voice rang out as she descended the stairs.


Lilly hurried to her, offering her arm for support. "I missed you, Grandma."And I missed you too," Helen said warmly. But her sharp eyes quickly noticed the redness in Lilly's eyes. "Have you been crying?" ′′NO,Grandma," Lilly lied smoothly. "Just something in my eye." Helen's gaze lingered, but she chose not to press. Instead,she smiled."Go rest in Alexander's room. You've had a long day. I'll have Camila fetch you when everyone arrives."

As Lilly retreated upstairs,her mind churned with thoughts of the evening ahead.She knew the night would bring questions,challenges,and perhaps revelations she wasn't ready to face. By 7:30 pm, the house was alive with chatter. Sandra's friends,family acquaintances, and key figures had all gathered, their laughter filling the air.


Lilly joined them, her face composed as she greeted the guests. Yet, amidst the pleasantries, a nagging tension lingered, like a storm cloud waiting to burst.


"Where's Alexander?" Sophia asked, her tone light but pointed.

"Busy with work, perhaps," Lilly replied evenly, though she wasn't sure herself.


Outside, a sleek car pulled up to the mansion. A young woman stepped out, her dark hair catching the fading light. Her eyes sparkled with childlike excitement as she gazed at the grand estate.


"Home sweet home," she murmured, her lips curling into a smile that hinted at secrets untold.
###Chapter 47

“Surprise!!"

The moment Sandra stepped through the door, a chorus of voices erupted in a warm, boisterous greeting. She froze in place for a heartbeat, her eyes wide as she took in the sight. A roomn filled with friends, family, and familiar faces greeted her, the cheerful noise mingling with laughter and excitement.


“Oh my..." Sandra's smile spread, her heart leaping in her chest. It had been so long since she felt this kind of warmth. Her eyes scanned the crowd,catching sight of her high school friends and a few family friends she hadn't seen in ages.


"Welcome back, my granddaughter," Grandma Helen said with open arms.her voice brimming with joy.

"Grandma," Sandra said immediately, rushing into her embrace."I missed you.”


"I missed you too," Helen replied emotionally, holding her close as tears welled in her eyes.


Lilly, standing off to the side, watched the reunion silently, her smile small but genuine as Sandra hugged one friend after another. Sandra's laughter filled the room as she made her way through the crowd, greeting familiar faces until she approached Richard.  “Richard!" Sandra exclaimed, her voice warm and familiar. “Sandra!" Richard responded just as enthusiastically. They embraced, their hug tight and full of the kind of affection only old
 friends could share. But as they broke apart. Sandra's gaze shifted to Lilly,who stood a few paces away, observing the reunion with a polite.composed smile.

"Welcome home, Sandra," Lilly said, her voice soft, yet undeniably warm.

All eyes in the room shifted toward Sandra as she stood still for a moment.contemplating. Everyone was waiting. Even Grandma Helen, who stood at the edge of the room, was eagerly watching to see how Sandra would react to Lilly.


After what felt like an eternity, Sandra smiled-an unexpectedly bright,welcoming smile. She stepped forward, wrapping Lilly in an embrace that startled everyone, including Lilly. No one had expected such a gesture on their first meeting, least of all Lilly.

For a moment, the room was completely still, the tension in the air dissipating as Sandra pulled back from the hug and flashed a teasing grin.“I never thought my cold-hearted brother had such a good eye for beauty,"she commented, her voice playful yet laced with an edge.


Lilly smiled, her lips curling in response.“You're stunning," Sandra added,her words genuine.

“Thank you, and so are you," Lilly replied, her voice steady, though there was an underlying hesitation.Grandma Helen let out a sigh of relief, the tension in her shoulders melting as she watched Sandra and Lilly engage in a conversation. It was clear to everyone that, for the momenat, Sandra had accepted Lilly. Sandra leaned in closer to Lilly. "So, tell me more about you and Alexander," she asked, her curiosity piqued as they continued to talk. As their conversation deepened. Sandra was delighted to learn that she would soon be an aunt. Her excitement was palpable. "That's the greatest gift Alexander could give me" she said with a broad smile.

By then. Sandra's thoughts turned to the only other petson she truly wanted to see."By the way, where is Alexander?" she asked.

Lilly's smile faltered, but she quickly recovered."He'll be here soon." she said,though the uncertainty in her voice didn't go unnoticed.

The room fell into a lighter chatter as everyone continued to enjoy dinner.Just as they were beginning to settle in, the door opened. and Alexander stepped inside. His presence was commanding.his eyes scanning the room before they landed on his sister.


"Brother!" Sandra stood up quickly, her voice filled with warmth and affection.


Alexander walked toward her. his expression a mix of fondness and calm control. As soon as they embraced, the room seemed to quiet. Lilly watched.noting the brief but genuine warmth in Alexander's eyes as he hugged Sandra. Despite his usual stoic demeanor, it was clear he cared deeply for his family.


After a moment, Sandra let go of her brother and took a seat, leaving Alexander to settle next to Lilly. There was a brief silence before Lilly spoke, her voice a bit softer now.

"I'm glad you made it," she said. Alexander nodded, his gaze lingering on her face for a moment longer than usual. "Is something on my face?" Lilly asked, raising an eyebrow. "No,” he replied slowly, though his gaze didn't waver, "Did you cry?" Lilly blinked, confused. "Huh? No," she said, her voice carrying a hint of uncertainty."Why do you ask?"

Alexander said nothing, but his eyes never left her. He knew more than he let on-his bodyguards had reported everything about her recent activities.including the fact that she'd cried after speaking with her father earlier that day.

The evening passed in relative ease, with laughter and shared stories around the dinner table. However, as the night wore on, Lilly's mind was elsewhere. Her phone buzzed in her pocket, and she quickly excused herself from the room. It was a message from Matthew.

We've found him. Call me.

Lilly's heart skipped a beat as she read the text. She rushed outside to make the call.


\---

"Where is he?" Lilly demanded, her voice urgent as she paced the hallway.

"If we're right, he's hiding in a small village in the western part of the country,"Matthew's voice crackled through the phone.

"That's not too far. How long will it take to get there?" Lilly asked,her mind already racing through the logistics of the journey.
 "The village is near City U. We'l need to get to the city, take a train to a nearby town, and then drive from there," Matthew explained.
Lilly cursed under her breath. "He's done well to hide, but we've found him. Now we need to catch him." 
"Yes," Matthew agreed."We'll make him confess to his crimes and tell us who sent him."

Lilly felt the weight of the situation pressing down on her. But there's more,"she thought. Sarah's warning echoed in her mind:

*"You need to tell Alexander. He trusts you now."*

Lilly hesitated, but Sarah's voice was firm in her head. *If you keep this from him, you'll lose that trust.*

"I think it's time you tell Alexander," Sarah had said earlier.“You can't keep hiding this. He has connections that could get the assassin to talk.”

Lilly stood still for a moment, lost in thought. Then Michael added, “Sarah's right. Your stepmother-now that you're the vice president-she's definitely planning something. You can't face this alone."

Lilly nodded,though doubt lingered in her mind. She needed Alexander's help,but telling him felt like walking a dangerous line.




When she returned home later that evening, she found Alexander already there.Clara greeted him warmly, but Sandra's usual welcome was absent.He looked around, noticing Lilly's absence. "Ma'am is already back home," Clara commented, watching Alexander closely. Without a word, he walked up the stairs, his mind racing. When he knocked on Lilly's door, there was no response. He opened the door and found it empty. His steps quickened as he made his way to the mini-library on the ground floor,where he found Lilly reading,her back to the door.

Lilly turned when she heard the door open, and when her eyes met Alexander's, her breath caught in her throat. She stood up immediately.moving toward him and embracing him without hesitation.

"What are you doing here?" he asked, his voice low,laced with curiosity.

“Waiting for you," she replied, her words steady but carrying an undertone of something heavier.


"In here? That's new." Alexander's lips quirked into a small, amused smile.


"I need to tell you something important," Lilly said, her tone suddenly serious.


Alexander's expression shifted, and he gestured for her to sit."What is it?"

Lilly hesitated, but then she stepped back and looked him in the eyes,her face somber. "It's about my sisters'deaths."

Alexander frowned, his attention fully on her. "You said you were investigating but found nothing."

"I did find somnething," Lilly corrected softly. "I know who killed them."
 
Alexander's brow furrowed, "You do?” "Yes,” Lilly replied, her voicetrembling with the weight of the revelation. “Who? And how long have you known?” Alexander pressed, his concern deepening.
"My stepmother and Kate," Lilly whispered. her throat tightwith emotion.


A heavy silence filled the room as Alexander processed her words.He turned away, his fists clenching.

"How long?" he asked again, his voice rough with anger.

"Two months after I went into hiding," Lilly replied, her voice breaking.

"And you've kept it to yourself? Letting the murderers walk free all this time?" Alexander's voice raised with fury, his control slipping for a moment.

Lilly swallowed,her heart pounding in her chest. “There wasn't enough evidence. I couldn't risk going to anyone without solid proof.”

"Solid proof? You should have told me, told your grandfather,"he snapped.unable to contain his anger. “You've been putting yourself at risk while they roam free!"

Lilly's breath hitched as tears filled her eyes. But despite the fury in his words, Alexander saw the pain in her eyes, and it softened him. He crossed the room and wiped the tear that slipped down her cheek.

"Stop crying," he muttered,pulling her into his arms.

Lilly leaned into him, finding solace in his warmth despite the storm that raged within her. "Tell me what you need me to do," Alexander said, his voice calm now but carrying a dangerous promise. Lilly pulled away slightly, her eyes locking with his. "I need your help to make the killer confess," Alexander's gaze turned cold, his jaw tightening. "Then we'll make them pay.”
###Chapter 48

Over the past month, everything between them had changed. Alexander.though never expressing his affection verbally, had showvn her in countless ways how deeply he cared. His actions spoke louder than words ever could,and Lilly had finally started to feel it. The last two months had been a whirlwind of unexpected turns-first. Alexander was undeniably falling for her;second, she had risen to the vice president of the Blake empire;third,she was carrying their child; and fourth, she had developed a strong relationship with his grandmother and sister. But despite everything that seemed to be falling into place, Lilly knew that true happiness would remain just out of reach until she avenged her sisters' deaths.

"I know where the one who killed them is hiding," Lilly said, her voice low,barely a whisper.

Alexander stiffened.“Where?"

“A small village in the west."

"I won't let you get involved," he said, his tone sharp."This is my responsibility. I'll make sure the truth comes out. You just focus on yourself and our baby."

“No,”she replied, hervoice unwavering. "I need to be there when you confront him. I want to witness his confession." He eyed her intensely, his expression unreadable. “You're sure? You really want to be there?" “Yes. I have to be." His eyes darkened, the tension between them growing heavier. "Are you asking me to go all the way? To make them suffer completely?"

Lilly shook her head. "No. I don't want you to make it easy for them.I want them to pay. I want the world to know they're responsible and to be locked away,facing the consequences."

A brief flicker of something almost like admiration crossed Alexander's face,but it was gone before Lilly could fully recognize it. “Yoú think I plan to give them an easy way out?”His voice was cold, filled with a promise."I will make them face the full weight of their actions. You don't need to worry about that."

Lilly's heart raced, but she held her ground. "Then I want to be there when you get the truth. I want to see it for myself.”

Alexander's gaze hardened.“No.”

The single word struck her like a slap. She stared at him, refusing to back down. "Please, Alexander. I need this. I need to be there for them. They took my sisters from me.”

“I said no," he repeated, his voice much firmer now. “The last thing I want is for you to witness what's coming. It's not a world I want you exposed to."

Lilly's breath caught, her chest tightening. She stepped closer, desperation creeping into her voice. "You don't understand. I need to be there. I can't be left out of this." Alexander's expression remained rigid, but his eyes betrayed a flicker of conflict. Still, he stood firm. "When I say no, I mean it.” She knew he wouldn't budge, but the fire in her rose, unyielding. She followed him as he turned to leave, his footsteps echoing in the quiet of the room. Without thinking, she stepped into the elevator with him, not letting him out of her sight.

"You're not changing my mind," he said, his voice low.

"I'm not trying to," she replied, her eyes focused on him as she unbuttoned his suit jacket. Slowly, she removed his shirt, her fingers grazing his chest. The touch was intimate, electric, and she could feel his resolve weakening just as much as hers.


Alexander's breath hitched, his body reacting to her touch in an instant.Before either of them knew it, they were on the bed, wrapped in each other,the world outside forgotten.


"I don't want you going back to your room," he muttered between kisses.“Clara will move your things to mine."


Her heart swelled at his words, and she smiled softly. “How long have I waited for you to say that?"


He smirked, that rare, charming smile creeping onto his lips. "Since the day I kicked you out of it, I'm guessing?”

Lilly's heart fluttered, but her thoughts were quickly lost in the heat of the moment. Their passion took over, but even then, a part of her remained determined, knowing that she couldn't let go of her need for justice. Hours later, Alexander held her in his arms, his gaze soft as she drifted into sleep. He kissed her forehead tenderly, but his mind was far from peaceful. He couldn't keep her safe from the storm that was coming, no matter how much he tried to shield her. The morning light crept in through the curtains, and before she had fully opened her eyes, he was already pulling her back into the storm.Their connection was undeniable, his every touch a promise, each kiss a reaffirmation of his desire.

As Lilly examined her body in the mirror, she couldn't help but gasp. The hickeys scattered across her neck, chest, and thighs were vivid marks of possession. She smiled faintly, touching them gently, before realizing how much she had to cover up. She placed a hand on her stomach, still flat at four months along, but a small smile tugged at her lips. She was carrying their child, and the thought of it was enough to push away her fear,for a moment at least.

Lilly chose a stylish black outfit to hide the marks-tight pants, a silky white shirt, and a cream coat to cover the rest. Thankfully, the cold weather made it all seem more natural. No one would question her choice of clothing. Not that she cared what anyone thought.


At the Blake empire headquarters, things were starting to feel more familiar. It had been a month since she assumed the vice presidency, and her role was only growing. Relationships with the staff were stronger,and the company's stock had risen sharply. Her name was now synonymous with success and power.


But when she stepped off the elevator, the last thing she expected was to see Kate standing outside her office.


"What are you doing here?” Lilly asked, her voice taut with suspicion. Kate turned, her smile forced, but still dangerous. “Dearest sister," she greeted in a sickly sweet tone.Lilly couldn't help but notice the way Kate's eyes lingered on her neck. A flash of anger passed through her stepsister's gaze before she covered it with a practiced smile. Lilly's heart skipped a beat. She knew exactly what Kate was thinking.

“You still haven't answered my question," Lilly pressed, keeping her voice calm, despite the rising tension in her chest.

“Oh, I'm just admiring how happy you look," Kate said, her voice taking on a mocking lilt. “But tell me, how long do you think that happiness will last?”


"Forever," Lilly responded, her voice steely,refusing to show weakness.

Kate's laughter was cold,devoid of warmth. "You've taken everything from me, everything I ever wanted. But it's okay,"she said, her voice dripping with venom. "What are sisters for,right?”

Lilly stood tall, her eyes narrowing. “Leave.”

Kate raised her hands in mock defeat. “Okay, okay, I'll leave." She turned toward the elevator, but as the doors opened, her smile faded.She looked back at Lilly, her eyes filled with malice. "Today is your last day on earth.Lilly.”


The doors closed with a soft hiss, and Lilly felt her blood run cold. Kate's words hung in the air, a chilling warning.
###Chapter 49

After Kate left. Lilly couldn't shake the feeling that her stepsister's visit was more than a mere coincidence. There was an underlying tension in the air, a sense of something dark looming just out of reach. Lilly's mind raced,replaying their conversation over and over. Kate's words felt like a slow-burning fuse, and Lilly was certain that her stepsister wasn't finished with her yet.

Her frustration boiled over as she walked back to her office. Every day,she lived with the same burning anger-the anger of knowing that the people responsible for her sisters' deaths were still out there, living freely without consequence. She had already provided Alexander with every shred of evidence,including the location of the assassin who had orchestrated the whole thing. It was only a matter of time before Kate and her mother's entire web of deceit would unravel. But until that happened, Lilly couldn't relax. Not yet. Not until she saw true justice for her sisters.


That morning, Alexander had taken further precautions, ramping up security at the estate, making sure Lilly would be protected at all costs.She appreciated his concern but couldn't shake the feeling that something more was brewing. Something bigger than just her sisters' killers.

As the day drew to a close, Lilly headed to her lunch date with Sandra.Her bond with Alexander's sister had deepened over the past few weeks,and it was one of the few things that managed to keep her grounded amidst the chaos of her life. "Sister-in-law!" Sandra greeted her with a warm hug as Lilly stepped out of the car. Lilly chuckled, hugging her back. "You've been waiting long?" Sandra grinned. "For two hours!"

Lilly raised an eyebrow, eyes wide with surprise. "Really?”

Sandra's face broke into a mischievous smile. "Kidding! Only about fifteen minutes."


Lilly sighed in relief, then playfully swatted Sandra's arm.


"Come on, let's go eat," Sandra linked her arm with Lilly's. "And after, we're going shopping... and maybe a movie?"


"Shopping again?" Lilly asked, incredulous. They had just gone a fewdays ago.


Sandra grinned. "You know I can't resist. And it's not like my brother's complaining."


Lilly's mind flickered back to the last shopping spree, when Alexander had blocked Sandra's cards after she'd maxed out the limit. It had been a whole week of no spending for Sandra, a punishment that Lilly had wholeheartedly supported. Now, Sandra was trying to convince her to join in on another spree.

"You're planning on spending my money again, aren't you?" Lilly said,knowing where this was headed.
 Sandra pouted but then flashed a bright smile. "Let's use your card this time. I'll be good, I promise!" Lilly sighed. "You never change, do you?" Sandra's eyes glinted mischievously. "I will, after this shopping trip.I swear." Lilly hesitated for a moment, then gave in. "Fine, but only because you promised."


"Yay!" Sandra cheered, dragging her toward the restaurant. The meal was delicious, and the shopping trip that followed had Sandra's excitement off the charts. Every store was filled with things Lilly didn't need, but Sandra had a way of convincing her that they did.

After hours of shopping, they finally made their way to a baby clothing store. Sandra was already picking out baby outfits for both genders, even though Lilly's pregnancy was only four months along. It was still a touch too early to tell the baby's gender, but Sandra's excitement was infectious.

Finally, they made their way to a jewelry store, where Sandra picked out an extravagant set of matching dresses. The last thing Lilly wanted was more jewelry or clothes, but Sandra insisted on them trying on the matching outfits.

"Come on, sister-in-law, please," Sandra begged, showing Lilly the white skirt,blouse, and jacket combination.

Lilly hesitated, eyeing the elegant outfit. "It's beautiful, but...”

"Just once!" Sandra urged.

Lilly's resolve crumbled under Sandra's pleading gaze. "Fine. Just this once." Sandra grinned, thrilled, and pulled her into the dressing room. They emerged, both wearing the matching outfits, their hair styled similarly.They laughed at how alike they looked. "We look like twins," Sandra exclaimed as they stared at their reflections. Lilly laughed, but a part of her felt unsettled. It had been a day of indulgence, but something was off. She couldn't shake the feeling that something dark was closing in.

By the time they finished their shopping, the sun was starting to set.Sandra insisted they walk to the nearby park, but Lilly was reluctant.

"It's getting late," she said, her unease growing as they neared the park.
There were far too many people around for her liking.

Sandra, however, wasn't hearing it. "Just a quick walk. I want ice cream."

Lilly rolled her eyes but agreed, albeit reluctantly. “Fine. But we're going home after that."


As they approached the ice cream stand, Lilly felt her anxiety spike. The crowd in the park seemed too dense, the air too thick with tension. Her eyes darted around, looking for any sign of trouble.

Two cars parked nearby, their engines running quietly. The hairs on the back of Lilly's neck stood up. Something wasn't right.

One of the men in the passenger seat of the car spoke into a phone.“Target in sight."

Lilly didn't hear the rest of the conversation, but the words “Finish it”echoed ominously in her mind. She turned to Sandra, about to say something, when the roar of an engine tore through the air. A car sped toward them at terrifying speed. Before Lilly could react, there was a deafening∗bang∗−ashot rang out, followed by the sound of screeching tires and panicked screams from the bystanders.


Lilly's heart stopped as she turned toward the horrific sight unfolding before her. Sandra's body crumpled to the ground, lifeless, blood pooling around her.


Time seemed to freeze. Lilly screamed, her voice drowned out by the chaos.as the lifeless body of her sister-in-law lay before her.

Everything around her blurred, and her mind was consumed by one thought-revenge.
###Chapter 50

Lilly's heart pounded as the car hurtled towards the ice cream stand. She barely had time to process what was happening before the screech of tires filled the air, and she saw Sandra's figure knocked violently to the ground."Sandra!! No!l" Lilly screamed, her voice breaking as she rushed to her sister-in-law's side, her hands trembling.


The scene was chaotic-blood pooled on the pavement. staining the
ground red as Lilly cradled Sandra's limp body in her arms. "Sandra.please... please stay with me," she begged, her voice barely above a whisper.The weight of the moment crushed her, her hands trembling as they soaked in Sandra's blood. She had been through this kind of pain before-the kind that made her feel powerless and small. The memory of her sisters' deaths loomed over her like a dark cloud. She couldn't lose Sandra
too.

The bodyguards had already begun chasing the fleeing vehicle, but Lilly was frozen in place. "Stay with me, Sandra, don't close your eyes," Lilly sobbed, pressing her forehead to Sandra's, her tears mixing with the blood on her face. Her mind raced,memories of that tragic day when she lost her sisters flashing before her eyes. It felt as though the world was closing in on her, and once again,she was helpless in the face of danger.

"Sandra.,, please..." The words escaped her lips in a desperate whisper.The pain was too much to bear, and yet, the chilling silence of the crowd-standing frozen, watching-only amplified her anguish. She had to stay strong. For Sandra. For the baby. But everything felt like it was slipping through her fingers.

The minutes dragged on, an eternity of fear, before Pedro and Samuel finally managed to call for an ambulance. Lilly's hands,now soaked in blood, trembled as she gazed at the dark crimson stain spreading across the pavement.her world spinning.


In the hospital room. Lilly lay unconseious, the events of the past two days catching up with her in a sea of nightmares. Her body was still recovering from the trauma. Alexander sat by her side, his eyes filled with worry.He brushed a lock of hair from her forehead, but the sweat beading on her skin spoke of her inner torment. "Please wake up," he whispered, his voice filled with a mixture of hope and despair. "I won't let them get away with this."

The doctors had explained it: the trauma had triggered a deep-seated memory of the day her sisters were taken from her. It had shaken her to the core, and now, Lilly remained in a deep sleep, fighting demons only she could see.


As Alexander sat beside her, the weight of the situation pressed on him.His sister's lífe hung in the balance, and yet all he could think about was Lilly-how close he had come to losing her, just like he had lost so much else in his life. The thought of facing another tragedy was more than he could bear. He couldn't allow it. "I will make them pay," he whispered under his breath, eyes dark with determination. Outside, in the hospital corridor, James stood, watching Alexander, his face grim. The scene before him was a rare one-Alexander,usually the stoic and controlled man, was a shadow of himself, consumed by worry.James knew this was different. This wasn't just about business or revenge. It was personal.
Alexander looked up sharply when he heard James approach. "What are you doing here?" His voice wvas cold,clipped. James raised an eyebrow, unfazed. "You weren't answering your calls," he said simply, "So, I decided to check in."

"Did you find the gang leader?" Alexander's tone remained flat, his eyes never leaving Lilly's face.

"Not yet," James replied. "But we're getting close."

Frustration flared in Alexander's chest. "Then why are you here?!"

"Calm down," James replied, his voice unbothered by Alexander's outburst.
"I'm here about the other matter, the one you asked me to handle."

Alexander didn't flinch, his gaze hardening. "Did you locate the assassin?"he demanded, his patience running thin.

James gave a slight nod. "Yes. Our men are transporting him now."

"Good," Alexander muttered, his eyes burning with a fierce, quiet rage. "Let me know when he arrives."

James crossed his arms, his eyes never leaving Alexander."How can I when you're not answering your phone?" He smirked, clearly not backing down.


Alexander's jaw clenched, but before he could respond, James spoke again."Look, I know things are hard right now, but you need to focus. You have responsibilities, too. You can't let your personal emotions cloud your judgment."

"I know what I'm doing," Alexander retorted sharply. "You can handle the rest."

James wasn't fooled by the cold demeanor. He saw through it-he could read Alexander better than anyone else. "You're afraid," he said, his voice softer now. "Afraid of losing her like you lost them. But Lilly's not the same. She's stronger than you think."

Alexander's eyes flickered with something unreadable before he turned back to Lilly. "Don't waste yourbreath," he muttered, though the weight of his words carried more meaning than James could see. "When she wakes up. I'll make them regret everything. All of them."

James's gaze softened, understanding the depth of Alexander's pain. "You love her, don't you?"

Alexander didn't respond, his gaze fixed on Lilly's pale face. The silence said everything. James could see the raw emotion in his eyes-the fear, the pain, the love. "Tell her how you feel when she wakes up," James added,his voice gentle. "Before it's too late."

After James left, Alexander adjusted Lilly's blanket, carefully tucking it around her. "We've found the assassin," he murmured softly,his voice just above a whisper. "When you wake up, we'll get justice. You won't have to fight this battle alone."

He kissed her hand, his lips lingering for a moment, and then leaned back in his chair, staring at her with determination. "You'll wake up. And when you do,we'll make them pay."
###Chapter 51

Grandma Helen stood at the threshold of the intensive care unit, her hand pressed against the cold, transparent glass. Her eyes, bloodshot from hours of silent vigil, followed the still figure of Sandra lying motionless on the hospital bed, hooked to an array of machines that beeped rhythmically-each pulse a reminder of how fragile life was. The sight of her granddaughter in such a condition brought fresh tears, which she wiped away in vain. "Sandra," she whispered, her voice breaking as she gazed at the girl fighting for her life.

Camila stood beside her, her face ashen, unable to look away from the woman in the bed. "Please recover soon, young miss," she murmured under her breath. It was hard to believe that just two months ago, Sandra had returned home with so much promise, only to find herself on the brink of death.


A few steps behind them, Mr. Blake, the patriarch, stood stoically, his eyes scanning the room before he turned to leave. His thoughts were elsewhere-on his granddaughter's near-fatal encounter. His people were still digging for answers, but he couldn't shake the feeling that things were spiraling beyond his control. The chilling possibility that his granddaughter could have been in Sandra's place sent a wave of anger through him. His fists clenched at the thought.

"How's the investigation progressing?" Caleb demanded, his voice steady but filled with frustration. "Our team is still gathering intel. The mastermind is elusive,covering his tracks well," came the response from one of his most trusted aides. Caleb exhaled sharply, unwilling to give up hope. "Mmmm." James, who had been standing in the corner, watching the scene unfold.took a step forward. "Sir, what did the doctor say about Sandra's condition?"His voice was tinged with a rare sympathy as he glanced at the ICU.

"The doctor said it would take a miracle for her to wake up." Caleb's tone was grim,each word weighed down with the harsh truth.

James nodded, looking towards Lilly, who was still unconscious and pale."And what about Lilly?"


"The doctor says only Lilly can decide when to wake up. She keeps calling out Sandra's name," Caleb replied, his voice softer now, a flicker of helplessness in his eyes.

"Sir, I want you to inform the hospital that we will cover both Miss Sandra's and Lilly's medical expenses from now on," Caleb ordered, his determination not to let them suffer financially despite the grim circumstances.


James hesitated for a moment. "You mean Miss Sandra,right?"

"Yes," Caleb affirmed. "And Lilly's too."

"Sir, with all due respect, you know Alexander won't accept your help,"James warned. "He's too proud."

"'I know." Caleb's jaw tightened. "But I can't sit here and do nothing."

James shifted uncomfortably. "Sir, your son tried to see Lilly. But he wasn't allowed."


Caleb's brow furrowed. "What do you mean he wasn't allowed?"

"According to what I gathered, Alexander has restricted visits. Only you are permitted to see her."

A slow,simmering anger began to rise in Caleb. "Since when?"

"This morning. Mr. Peter came with Bella and Kate, but they were turned away. I heard there was an argument between Alexander and Peter,"James informed him, concern creeping into his voice.

"Hmmm. James, I want you to find out what's going on. Alexander wouldn't have done this without a reason."

James nodded, his tone resolute. "I'll get to the bottom of it,sir."

Meanwhile, in a dark room a few floors up, Kate sat rigidly beside her mother. Bella, her face twisted in frustration. "How did we fail, mother?"she spat, her voice filled with venom. "Lilly should be dead by now.How did those people screw this up so badly?"

Bella remained silent, lost in thought. The thought of Lilly still being alive was a thorn in Kate's side, especially considering her own schemes were at risk of being exposed.

"Mother," Kate hissed, her impatience mounting. "We need to act fast. As long as Lilly is alive, Alexander will keep hating me. If she's gone, I can get close to him, make him see me differently."

Bella's response was slow, deliberate. She didn't even meet Kate's eyes."Shut up." Her voice was sharp, her gaze icy. "You're not thinking straight.Don't you realize te mess we're in right now?"

Kate's frustration boiled over. "What do you mean? We've been planning this for months! If Lilly's out of the way, I can get to Alexander.W′11−′′

"No!" Bella snapped, cutting her off. "Alexander is investigating, and so is your grandfather. They're both looking for answers. Did you not see the rage in Alexander's eyes when he saw you? He knows it's us, Kate. If he discovers the truth about your involvement, he will come after us. And believe me, he won't stop until we're dead."

Kate's breath caught in her throat as the weight of her mother's words hit her. "What do we do now?"


"We need to clean up our mess," Bella growled. "Alexander is dangerous.He'll hunt down anyone connected to this, and we can't afford to let him find the gang leader. We need him dead before your grandfather or Alexander get to him.Fast."

Kate's heart raced as she realized the full scope of their predicament."How soon can you take care of it?"

"I'll make the arrangements," Bella replied, her voice cold, calculating. "But you need to focus on staying out of Alexander's radar. We've gone too far for you to slip up now."

As the pieces fell into place, both Kate and Bella knew that their lives hung by a thread. They needed to act swiftly, or everything they had worked for would crumble. But as the net closed in, one thing was certain-their past mistakes would catch up with them sooner than they expected. And when Alexander finally found out the truth, there would be no place for them to hide.
###Chapter 52

On the outskirts of the city, a dilapidated warehouse concealed a chilling secret-ahidden underground complex with five levels, all kept in complete darknessfrom the outside world. This secluded base was one of many places where Alexander's enemies found themselves brought to face brutal consequences for their betrayals.

In a dimly lit room on the fourth level, Alexander stood over a table cluttered with an array of grim tools and weapons. His icy eyes locked onto a young man, bound and suspended on a stool, with a thick rope cutting into his neck. The room reeked of blood and fear, as the man winced in pain from his ongoing torment. Terror gripped him as he saw the gleaming butcher's knife in Alexander's hand.


"Please..." the captive begged, his voice trembling, as tears ran down his battered face. He had only followed orders to run down a woman,unaware of the dangerous game he was entangled in.


"Please?" Alexander sneered, his voice low and mocking. "Not until I get what I want."


The young man's body trembled violently as he desperately tried to control his breathing. "If I were you, I wouldn't do that," Alexander said,his voice chilling as he watched the man struggle. "A little too much movement, and you'll strangle yourself." "I'd rather die than endure this," the man muttered, his face contorted in pain before he kicked the stool from under him, the rope tightening around his neck.
Alexander's cold gaze never wavered. "Hold him steady," he commanded.His men,hidden in the shadows, swiftly rushed forward, stabilizing the stool, keeping the man from choking to death.


Gasping for air, the man whimpered, his throat raw. "Why won't you just let me die?" he rasped.


"I'm not finished with you," Alexander replied, his voice laced with venom.
He approached the man and plunged the butcher's knife into his foot, the blade sinking deep, causingthe man to scream in agony.

Up above, on the first underground level, Ethan's car screeched to a halt.
A guard greeted him with a nod.

"Where's your boss?" Ethan demanded.

"In the torture room," the guard answered with a somber tone.

Ethan strode toward the elevator, déscending into the depths of the building. He made his way through the shadowy corridors, the unsettling silence broken only by the sound of his boots hitting the cold floor.Reaching the torture room, he swung open the door, revealing the grisly scene: Alexander standing over the tortured young man, blood splattered across the floor.

"Alexander!" Ethan called out, his voice sharp. When Alexander didn't respond, Ethan's frustration boiled over. "Stop!" he shouted, his eyes burning with urgency.

It was only then that Alexander paused, turning toward Ethan, his face unreadable. "Lilly has woken up," Ethan said in a voice thick with urgency, causing Alexander to stop dead in his tracks. The nurse trembled, her voice barely above a whisper. "Dr. Sophia went to the ICU." Alexander's gaze darkened, a dangerous edge creeping into his voice." What did you say? This better not be a joke, or you'll regret it."

"Lilly woke up. I was just at the hospital. You weren't answering your calls, so Richard told me you were here," Ethan continued. Alexander dropped the knife, his face momentarily softening before he made his way toward theexit, but Ethan stepped in front of him.

"Are you really going to see her like this?" Ethan asked,noting the blood stains on Alexander's clothes.


Alexander glanced down at his attire and then dismissed the question,pushing past Ethan with a cold, calculated stride. He made his way to the fifth floor to clean up. Ethan sighed, his gaze lingering on the suffering man in the room.


After a quick shower and a change of clothes, Alexander rushed to the hospital, his mind racing. He arrived to find his bodyguards tense, their faces strained.

"Sophia has taken Lilly out of her room," one of them reported.


The news sent a wave of anger through Alexander. "Where?" he demanded.

"Sophia's office."

Rage simmering beneath his calm exterior, Alexander stormed into the office,but only found a nurse there, clearly flustered.


"Where is the doctor?" he barked, his patience thinning. Realizing where Lilly had been taken, Alexander's heart quickened. He rushed to Sandra's room, his pulse hammering in his ears. As he neared,he could hear the sound of muffled sobbing. There, against the glass,stood Lilly-her face pale, tears streaming down her cheeks as she stared at Sandra's lifeless body. Lilly's hand was connected to an IV drip, her fragile statebarely holding together.

Sophia caught sight of Alexander's approach, her eyes widening in surprise. He walked over to Lilly, gently wrapping his arms around her,offering her a semblance of comfort despite the chaos swirling around them.

"Alexander," Lilly whispered, looking up at him. She had never looked so vulnerable, so broken.


He wiped away her tears with a tender hand. "I'm here," he reassured her,his voice soothing yet firm.

Lilly's voice quivered with guilt. "It's my fault. I was the target, but Sandra's the one fighting for her life."

"Shhh," Alexander hushed her gently, pulling her closer. "It's not your fault. She'll pull through. Don't blame yourself."

Lilly rested her head against his chest, her sobs softening. "You need to rest," he urged. "You're not strong enough yet."

"No," Lilly protested weakly, shaking her head. "I want to stay and watch over her." "Listen to me," he said, cupping her face so she could see the concern in his eyes. "A sick person can't take care of another. You need to recover first. You know that, right?" Lilly reluctantly nodded, but her gaze lingered on Sandra, her heart heavy with the weight of thesituation.


"I caught the hitman," Alexander said, his voice quiet but intense, bringing a flicker of hope to Lilly's eyes. "And the driver who hit Sandra.We're closing in on the gang leader. We'll find out who ordered this."

Lilly's relief was palpable, but she didn't want to be left behind. "I want to be there when you interrogate them."


"You will," Alexander promised, placing a kiss on her forehead. "But first,you need to rest and take care of our baby. Can you do that for me?"


Lilly nodded, the exhaustion evident in her face, yet there was a glimmer of determination behind her eyes.


"Good girl," Alexander whispered, leading her back to her room. As they walked, his eyes shot a chilling glare at Sophia, who was clearly uneasy under the weight of his gaze. He hadn't forgotten that Sophia had taken Lilly out of her room without permission.


Sophia felt a chill crawl up her spine. She knew she was in deep trouble.Desperate, she made her way to Richard for help.


Richard, weary from an eight-hour surgery, was just trying to rest when Sophia barged into his office. She immediately climbed onto the bed,disturbing his peace.


"Richard," she whispered, her voice filled wvith panic. Richard blinked, his eyes softening as he looked at her. "What's wrong,baby?" "I'm in trouble," Sophia confessed, her voice trembling. "I need your help before Alexander sends someone to drag me back to his base."

Richard, now fully awake, sat up in bed. "What did you do?"

Sophia's voice dropped to a guilty whisper. "Lilly woke up... and I..."


Richard's eyes widened. "Lilly finally woke up? That's amazing!"

Sophia nodded, but the dread was still in her voice. "Yes. And when she asked about Sandra, I told her Sandra was fine. But she insisted on seeing her. So, I took her to the ICU. I didn't think Alexander would show up so quickly, but he did. I tried to get Lilly back to her room before he arrived,but..."


Richard sighed deeply, rubbing his forehead. "You've really done it now,haven't you?"


Sophia's face crumpled, terrified. "What's he going to do to me?"

"Don't worry. He won't do anything," Richard said, though his tone lacked conviction.

"Why not?" Sophia asked, looking at him in confusion.

"Because Lilly is his weakness," Richard replied with quiet certainty. "If Lilly pleads for you, he won't touch you."

Sophia breathed a sigh of relief, but it was short-lived as the reality of her actions settled in. "I hope you're right," she muttered.

Richard lay back down, pulling the covers up to his chest. "Now,go to sleep. You're safe for now. But remember, fear of Alexander is the first step to wisdom."

Sophia snuggled beside him, still uneasy but grateful for the small comfort his words gave her. As Richard drifted off to sleep. she lay awake.wondering just how far Alexander's wrath would stretch.
###Chapter 53

"My heart is at ease now that you and the baby are okay. What happened eo Sandra is  terrible," Sarah murmured, her voice laced with concern as she adjusted Lilly's blanket, sitting next to him on the hospital bed. She had rushed to be by his side the moment she learned Lilly had woken up the previous day.


Lilly let out a heavy sigh. "I was the intended target. They thought it was me, but it was Sandra they hit instead."


Sarah's expression darkened. "Im certain it was Bella and Kate," she said with quiet conviction.


Lilly nodded, her gaze hardening. "Kate came to my office earlier that day,spouting nonsense. Then the accident happened."

Sarah clenched her fists. "If I get my hands on Kate, she'll regret it. Her and that wicked mother of hers."


They'Il pay for everything they've done," Lilly vowed, her voice thick with determination. "And it won't be long before they're behind bars."


Sarah nodded in agreement. "You should tell your grandfather,Lilly.He'll be shocked when he sees the news."


Lilly paused, her thoughts racing. She needed Bella and Kate to confess,to reveal the truth to the world in front of her grandfather. The last thing she wanted was for him to learn about it like everyone else, through the media.


"You're right," Lilly finally said.11Alexander mentioned the same thing earlier. I'll prepare to tell him when he visits tomorrow."

"I ean't wait for this to be over. For Sandra to recover." Sarah's voice

 
softened.

"Me too," Lilly agreed.

"By the way..." Lilly glanced around the room, suddenly noticing the absence of certain familiar faces. "Where are Jacob and Michael? Don't they know I'm awake?"

Sarah hesitated, a strange smile playing on her lips. "Well.."

Lilly raised an eyebrow, sensing something amiss."What?"

Sarah's smile widened. "You didn't tell me that Alexander was the jealous type," she teased, her eyes sparkling with amusement.

Lilly stared at her, confusion clouding her expression. "What are you talking about?"


"Don't act surprised," Sarah grinned. "When you woke up, Michael and Jacob came with me to see you. But Alexander wouldn't let them in."

Lilly blinked in disbelief. "Are you serious?"

Sarah nodded. "Michael and Alexander had an... altercation, just the second day you were hospitalized."

Lilly's jaw dropped. "What? No way." Sarah's face turned serious.′′Itwas intense. If Alexander hadn't held himself back, he could have hurt Michael badly. But he didn't want you to wake up and find out something happened to him." Lilly had to sit up a little, the shock evident on her face. "What happened exactly?" Sarah sighed, her tone turning more serious. "We rushed to the hospital when we heard what happened. But Alexander's guards wouldn't let us in to see you. Alexander came out of the VIP room, saw us standing there,and allowed me in, but not Jacob or Michael. He said they weren't needed.Michael got angry, though. He insisted he had the right to see his friend,which triggered the altercation."


Lilly couldn't believe what she was hearing. "Michael told him he's been in my life longer and knows me better. That made Alexander lose his cool."

"Exactly," Sarah confirmed, her eyes filled with disbelief. "He had his guards throw Michael and Jacob out. Even though Jacob hadn't said a word."


Lilly stared at Sarah, her mind racing. "I didn't think Alexander would ever do that."


Sarah almost laughed at Lilly's shock. "Well, now that he has feelings for you,you're going to see a side of him you've never seen before. Trust me,Alexander isn't just the tough, commanding CEO. He's also an overprotective, jealous husband in the making."


Lilly's thoughts were interrupted by a voice that made her heart skip a beat.


"I don't want any man near you," Alexander's voice echoed through the room, his cold gaze locked on Lilly as he entered, his presence commanding. Lilly blinked, caught off guard by his sudden arrival. She opened her mouth, but words failed her. The intensity of Alexander's gaze made her hesitate. "You didn't let Jacob and Michael see mne," Lilly said, her tone betraying her confusion. "They're family-close friends who've been with me for years. They have every right to be here."

Alexander's jaw tightened. "You shouldn't have male friends."

Lilly was speechless. Sarah had warned her, but she never expected Alexander to be this insecure.


"But they're family," Lilly insisted, hoping to reason with him.

Alexander didn't flinch, his expression unreadable. His silence hung heavy between them.


Finally, after a long pause, he exhaled, his voice quiet but firm. "Fine.They can see you."


Lilly's lips curved into a small smile, relieved. Without thinking, she threw her arms around him, hugging him tightly. She couldn't deny the flutter in her chest-seeing Alexander so possessive, so jealous, made her heart race.


He hugged her back, his hold tightening. "You'll be discharged tomorrow,"he murmured.

"Really?" Lilly looked up at him, her eyes wide with surprise.


"Yes," Alexander confirmed. "We'll go home tomorrow after we visit Sandra." Lilly pulled back from the embrace, her mind racing. "Ineed to see my grandfather tomorrow before we leave," she said, her voice steady but resolute. "Why?" Alexander asked, his brow furrowing. "He can visit you since you're the one who's been sick."

Lilly's gaze hardened. "I need to tell him, Alexander. I need to tell him everything before he finds out from the media."


Alexander's eyes widened slightly, realizing what Lilly meant. "You've decided to tell him?"


Lilly nodded. "Yes. The truth needs to come out, and I want him to hear it from me first."


Alexander fell silent for a moment, his eyes dark with thought. "What about your father? Won't you forgive him?"

Lilly's face hardened at the mention of her father. "I want him to be more remorseful," she said, her voice cutting through the tension. "I need him to understand the damage he caused-how he destroyed his family and lost two of his children because of his actions. Only then will I forgive him."

Alexander stared at her, his gaze faraway, as though his thoughts were drifting to something painful.

Lilly watched him closely, sensing the weight of his unspoken thoughts.His silence made her wonder if the mention of her father had triggered something from his past-something he wasn't ready to share.


"Alexander," Lilly said gently, her hand reaching out to him, "I hope one day you'll open up to me. I want to understand... what's hurting you."She knew the truth, but part of her wanted him to speak it out loud. Alexander didn't respond. Instead, he stared at her, his expression unreadable. After a few moments, he leaned down and kissed her forehead,his touch soft but intense. "It's late," he said, his voice low. "You should sleep."

Lilly nodded, though her mind was still buzzing with everything that had been said. "You need rest too," she murmured. "You haven't slept in days."

Alexander smirked."Okay, but only if you give me a kiss first."

Lilly smiled, her heart warming at his words. She leaned in and kissed him without hesitation. As the kiss deepened,she could feel the weight of the world lift off her shoulders for just a moment, the quiet comfort of being in his arms almost enough to make her forget everything else.


Meanwhile, in the cold confines of a high-security prison, a woman sat alone, her eyes fixed on a business magazine. A photograph of Alexander graced the cover, and as she ran her fingers over the image, a wicked smile spread across her lips. Her dark eyes gleamed with something dangerous,a spark of recognition.

"You've grown up well, Alexander," she whispered to herself, her voice laced with an unsettling mixture of pride and malice.

The woman's features were strikingly similar to Alexander's, the same dark eyes, the same sharp features. But the warmth in her gaze was absent.replaced by a cruel smile as she continued to study the picture.


The past was never far behind, and it was only a matter of time before Alexander would have to face it.
###Chapter 54

Bella rushed out of the elevator, her heart racing as she shoved past the employees who greeted her with puzzled glances. Her mind was consumed with a singular thought: get to Kate. She stormed down the hallway,her footsteps echoing with urgency, until she reached her daughter's office.The door flew open with a crash, startling Kate, who looked up, eyes wide with surprise.


"Mom, what are you doing here?" Kate asked, confusion and concern mixing in her tone.


Without a word. Bella rushed in, her hands gripping Kate's arms as she yanked her to her feet. Kate stumbled, caught off guard by the force. "Why are you pulling me? What's going on?" she demanded, her voice sharp with alarm.


"We need to leave," Bella said, her voice taut with panic, the words a command rather than a suggestion.


Kate's confusion deepened. "What do you mean, we need to leave? And let go of my hand,Mom."


Bella released her but began pacing back and forth, her movements sharp and agitated. Kate could feel the tension radiating from her mother, and something in her gut told her this was more than just a fleeting moment of anxiety. "What's going on, Mom?" she asked, her voice steady despite the rising dread in her chest. "We need to leave," Bella repeated, this time her eyes flashing with intensity as she turned to face her. The urgency in her tone made Kate's heart skip a beat. Leave? What do you mean?" Kate's voice wavered slightly as she stood frozen, trying to process her mother's frantic words.

Bella's eyes locked onto hers with an unblinking stare. "The man I hired to eliminate the gang leader has gone missing. That means Alexander already has him. And... I've just heard word from the people watching him. They said he was taken by a group of men. I'm sure it's Alexander's people."

Kate's breath caught in her throat, a cold wave of dread washing over her."What??" she gasped, her mind reeling with the implications.

"Keep your voice down," Bella hissed, her hand gripping Kate's wrist,pulling her closer. "Don't let anyone hear."

Kate's mind raced, her pulse quickening. "You mean he already knows...about Lilly's sisters? About the accident with his sister?" Fear surged through her as she realized the weight of Bella's words.

"Yes," Bella whispered harshly, "which is why we need to leave now. It's only a matter of time before he comes for us."


Kate's thoughts scrambled, her mind racingfor a solution. "Leave? Where to?"


Bella's eyes darkened with resolve. "We have to flee the country. We're not safe here anymore. I'll have one of our most trusted maids bring our valuables to a safe location. We need to withdraw every penny from our accounts, then leave by ship. I've already made arrangements." Kate froze. The idea of abandoning everything, her position, her life, was almost unthinkable. Yet the cold dread in her stomach told her there was no other choice. Bella grabbed her hand again. pulling her toward the door. "Come on, we don't have time to waste."


But Kate didn't move. She stood there, her mind reeling with what her mother had just proposed. Bella turned sharply, her expression fierce."Kate!! There's no time to think about what we're leaving behind.If we don't leave now, we're dead."


Kate's face drained of color as the realization hit her.′′Ithere no other way?" she whispered, her voice trembling.


Bella's gaze softened for a moment, but only just. "Not right now. The only way to save ourselves is to run."

Kate nodded. though her mind was still clouded with doubt and fear. But Bella had already started pulling her toward the exit, leading her through the back halls of the company. As they moved swiftly, Kate could only wonder how deep the web of lies and betrayal had gone. There was no turning back now.




"I'll visit you every day, Sandra. Goodbye," Lilly whispered softly,standing just outside the ICU room. The doctor had said her sister's condition was improving, but she still lay unconscious, trapped in a coma. They were waiting for the moment she would wake up, but that moment seemed so distant. Alexander stood next to her, his eyes tender as he gazed at his sister. "Get welI soon, Sandra," he said, his voice low with emotion.′′Bythe time you wake up, those responsible for this will pay with their lives." Lilly could see  the fire of vengeance in his eyes, and she placed a hand over his, offering what little comfort she could.

Just then, Alexander's phone buzzed. He glanced at it but didn't answer.Lilly raised an eyebrow.


"It might be important," she suggested softly.

Reluctantly, Alexander answered the call. "What is it?" His tone was sharp,the impatience clear.


"They've figured out we have the gang leader and the assassin. They're planning to flee the country," James reported, urgency in his voice.

Alexander's eyes darkened. He looked at Lilly, his expression unreadable."Your stepmother and stepsister are planning to escape."

"What?" Lilly's heart sank. The idea of Bella and Kate fleeing now, after everything that had happened, filled her with dread. If they escaped,they would never face justice for what they had done.

"I'll send the driver and a few men to get you to your grandfather's place.Once you've told him the truth, he can follow you to the base. By then, we'1l have caught them," Alexander promised, his voice steady with determination.


Lilly's heart was heavy with the weight of the situation, but she nodded."Okay. Promise me you'll catch them."


"There's no way they can escape," Alexander assured her. He kissed her forehead gently. "Please, stay safe." "I will," Lilly said softly, her heart aching as she watched him leave to meet James. Lilly arrived at the Blake estate later that day, her mind a whirlwind of thoughts. Victor greeted her at the door, his face a picture of polite respect.

"Welcome,Young Miss," he said, bowing slightly.

"Thank you, Uncle," Lilly smiled faintly. "Where's Grandfather?"

"He's waiting for you."

Lilly followed him toward her grandfather's study, but as they neared the door, something stopped her in her tracks. Victor turned to look at her.

"Is something wrong, Young Miss?" he asked, his concern evident.


Lilly hesitated, then shook her head. "You can go back, Victor. I'll go in alone."


Victor studied her for a moment, sensing the tension in her demeanor.But he nodded and stepped back, leaving her standing before the door.

Taking a deep breath, Lilly steeled herself. She knocked on the door,then entered at the sound of her grandfather's voice.


Inside,Caleb sat at his desk, writing as always. When he saw her,he smiled warmly,setting down his pen and walking over to embrace her.The hug was unexpected, and Lilly's heart clenched in both surprise and longing. She hadn't realized how much she had missed her grandfather's embrace. "Good day, Grandfather," she greeted softly as he pulled away. Caleb frowned as he examined her face. "You look unwell. Why didn't you rest instead of coming here?" Lilly smiled faintly. "There's something I need to tell you."

Her grandfather's expression softened,sensing the gravity of the situation."What is it, my child?"

Lilly swallowed, gathering the strength to speak. "I don't know how to tell you this, Grandfather," she whispered, her voice trembling. "But... my sisters and mnother, they were killed by..."

Caleb's gaze sharpened. "You know who did it?"

Lilly nodded, her heart heavy. "Yes, I know. I've been investigating. And right now, as we speak, the assassin is locked up at one of Alexander's bases."


The words hung in the air, a chilling truth settling into the room.

###Chapter 55

"Did you capture the assassin?" Lilly's grandfather's voice was like ice,his eyes burning with a silent fury.


Lilly's nod was all the confirmation he needed. The darkness in his gaze deepened. “Bring him to me. I will have him executed for what he did to my granddaughters. Who sent him?" His words were sharp, like a bladle,the muscles of his jaw taut with restraint. His rarely seen emotions now emerged with the weight of every painful memory of his lost granddaughters.


"He confessed under severe torture," Lilly replied, her voice a whisper in the stillness."He revealed those who hired him."


Her grandfather's expression shifted, his anger now like a tempest in his eyes."Who are they?" he demanded, barely containing the violence in his tone.


Lilly reached into her bag, her fingers trembling as she retrieved her phone.She tapped a few buttons, and a video began to play-a recording of the confession, the words too heavy for her to speak aloud. The screen flickered to life, showing a bloodied man, his face distorted with pain, his body marked by scars of countless betrayals.

"I... was paid to kill them," the man rasped.

A low, calm voice echoed from off-camera."Who hired you?" "Two women," the man croaked, wincing at the pain coursing through him. "One young... the other older. They never told me their names." The camera zoomed in on two photos, each framed with deliberate precision. The older woman was unmistakable.

Lilly's grandfather's eyes hardened, his lips pressing into a thin line as he scanned the images. His voice was a venomous whisper. "Recognize her?"

"Yes," the assassin muttered, his voice barely audible. "She's the one who paid me.”


"And this one?” Alexander's voice remained cold, showing the photo of Kate.


The man recoiled slightly, his gaze flickering with recognition.“She came with the older one... called her 'mother.'"

Lilly's grandfather slammed his fist onto the table, the impact loud and deafening in the tense silence. His eyes burned with unrestrained rage."How dare they! I should have seen it-should have known! I let that filth into our family!"


“Guards!" he bellowed, his voice echoing through the cold, vast space. Two men rushed in, their faces blank and obedient.

“Yes,sir.”


“Find Bella and Kate. Bring them to the torture room!" His voice was ice-cold, the weight of his fury now fully realized.


Lilly stood, her voice cuttíng through the thick tension. “You won't find them," she said, her words chilling the air around them. “A few months after I disappeared," she admitted, the guilt weighing on her like a suffocating blanket. “What do you mean?" her grandfather growled, the fire in his voice sparking again. "They must pay for what they've done!” His gaze turned to ice as he fixed her with an accusing glare. "And you didn't think to tell me? After everything that happened?" "They're already gone," Lilly explained, her voice firm despite the turmoil inside her. "They're trying to flee the country. Alexander and his men are already in pursuit."

Her grandfather's face twisted with frustration. "Then I'll send more men.
They won't get far."

"No need," Lilly said, her gaze unwavering."“Alexander will catch them.
He has it under control."

The old man's teeth ground together as he turned away, pacing.“Do you expect me to sit here and do nothing while they escape?!"

Lilly's heart skipped a beat, but she remained calm. "No, Grandfather.We'Il go to Alexander's base. Once he catches them, they'll be brought there."

Her grandfather's eyes darkened with determination. “What are we waiting for, then? Get the cars ready!" he barked, his orders swift and cutting.


The car ride was heavy with tension. Lilly noticed her grandfather's stare,his eyes distant, lost in the abyss of his thoughts. The muscles in his clenched fist betrayed the storm of emotions brewing inside him.


“How long have you known?" he asked, his voice low and dangerous. Lilly's stomach dropped, the question she'd been dreading finally coming to the surface. She'd kep t this secret for too long, and now the weight of it crushed her. "I'm sorry." she whispered, her voice fragile.

"Sorry?!" he roared, his face contorting with anger."After what they did?And you kept this from me? Victoria and Shigella are dead, and you let them walk free. You let them worm their way into our family, into our lives!" He was trembling with fury, his voice a dangerous whisper."And Alexander knew before I did?"

"I didn't want to burden you," she replied, her voice barely a breath."After everything. I didn't want to add to your pain."

His anger didn't subside.“Pain?*Pain*?You should've told me. Lilly! Do you know what I've lost? What we've all lost because of their deceit? I trusted Kate. I gave her everything, made her CEO. And she's nothing but a murderer!”


"I'm sorry," she repeated, her voice cracking.

He turned away, his fists clenched, each word from his mouth a stinging lash.“I'm going to make them pay for this," he said, his voice cold as steel.“When we get there, I'll deal with them myself."

Lilly hesitated but finally spoke. "Alexander won't let you."

Her grandfather turned sharply, eyes blazing. “And why the hell not?”

"Because they caused Sandra's accident," Lilly said, her voice barely above a whisper. "She's in the hospital, fighting for her life.,, and it's all because of them. I wastheir target, Grandfather. But Sandra.., she was hit instead."

The words hung in the air,a dagger aimed straight at the heart. Lilly's grandfather froze, his body rigid with rage.

"They deserve death. All of them," he growled, his voice a promise of
violence.

**Earlier that Day:**

Kate and her mother had been frantically gathering their things, preparing to flee,when the walls of their escape collapsed around them. A voice cut through the air, familiar and cold.

“Not so fast.”

It was James, Alexander's most trusted associate. The look on Kate's face soured in an instant.


“Damn it, we're finished," Kate hissed under her breath, realizing how close James was to Alexander. He was sent after them, and there was no escaping now.

"So,trying to run from your sins, are we?” James' voice was calm,but the malice in it was clear. "Seize them!" he ordered.

The men around them moved swiftly, expertly neutralizing the threat as they injected both women with a tranquilizer, rendering them unconscious before they could react.

Hours later, cold water splashed across their faces,jolting them awake. The harsh light was blinding, the room oppressive. They were tied to chairs.their vision blurry as they tried to make sense of their surroundings.Bloodstains on the floor, ominous shadows creeping along the walls, and the cold chill in the air all sent waves of terror through them. Then, three battered men were dragged in, tied to chairs opposite them.Bella's heart lurched when she recognized two of them-the assassin and the gang leader. In a distant, sterile room, Alexander watched everything unfold on a screen.The sharp contrast between the pristine, modern control room and the filth of the torture chamber was chilling.


"Alexander, they've arrived," James's voice called as he entered the room.

Alexander nodded silently, his expression unreadable. He stood up, ready to face what was about to unfold, and followed James to the warehouse. It was time for the reckoning.


As Lilly and her grandfather arrived, they were greeted by an empty, eerie warehouse.The air felt still, like a trap waiting to spring.

"Is this the place?" her grandfather asked, his suspicion growing.

Lilly scanned the surroundings, noting the hidden guards lurking in the shadows.


"Yes,” Pedro confirmed, his voice a whisper. "This is where he told us to come.”


Suddenly, the sound of a door creaking open echoed through the quiet.Alexander emerged, his figure tall and commanding, his gaze locking onto Lilly's grandfather.


“Alexander," Lilly called, rushing to him.

He embraced her, his eyes briefly meeting her grandfather's. “Did you capture them?” "I did," her grandfather replied, his voice still laced with fury. "I'll let you decide their fate." Lilly exhaled, relief washing over her. She knew, at long last, Bella and Kate's time had come.

As they made their way underground, Lilly felt her curiosity stir. Thebase was hidden away beneath the earth-a secret lair of sorts.


"Why underground?" she asked, the question burning on her tongue.

"It's a story for another time." Alexander replied cryptically.

Her grandfather, however, was not so patient. His frustration was evident.and his foot tapped impatiently as they descended into the depths.

The doors opened to reveal a hallway that stretched out before them-dark,cold, and endless. But it was the clean, organized monitoring room that caught Lilly's attention. It stood in stark contrast to the bloody torture chamber she saw on the screen, and she shuddered at the thought of what was happening to her enemies in real-time.


Her grandfather's anger was palpable as he clenched his fists. “Take me to them.”


Alexander didn't hesitate. He signaled for a guard to escort him. But just as Lilly took a step to follow, Alexander's grip stopped her, his eyes softening as he wiped away her silent tears.


“Why are you stopping me?" she asked, her voice breaking.

“Because youI can't go in there," he said quietly, his gaze firm yet gentle.
###Chapter 56

He turned Lilly to face him, his gaze falling on the tears that stained her cheeks. With a tenderness born of deep care, he wiped them away, hislips brushing her forehead in a soft kiss.


"Why are you stopping me?" she asked, her voice fragile,strained by emotion.

"Because you can't go in there," he replied, his tone unyielding.

"But I have to!" Her hands trembled as she reached out, her words sharp with pain. "You promised I couId see them. They killed my sisters. I need to make them pay, to make them suffer."

Alexander's jaw tightened. He understood the torment in her eyes more than anyone else, but he couldn't allow this. Not like this.

"No,”"he said firmly,his voice final.

"Please," she begged, her tears falling freely now. Her words were raw,desperate. "I need to feel it, Alexander. I need to vent my anger."

He took her hands in his, pressing them gently to his lips. "I won't let your hands be stained," he whispered, his voice laced with both regret and determination. "You're not like them. You're not like us. Your grandfather will handle this-he will take care of it for you. You'll watch. And you'll make the final decision." Lilly shook her head, her heart in turmoil.′′Iwant to be there! I want to make them feel every ounce of the pain they caused." But Alexander's resolve never wavered. He held her close, determined to shield her from what lay beyond that door. She wasn't ready, and neither 
was he willing to let her be.

Inside the room, the tension was palpable. Bella and Kate's faces drained of color as they saw who had entered.

“Grandfather..." Kate's voice faltered, and in an instant, her defiance was met with the sting of a brutal slap that sent her chair crashing backward.

“How dare you call me that, you traitor?" Bella's voice was cold, but fear flashed in her eyes. She knew her life was slipping away. There was no saving them now. Her blood would be spilled tonight.

Bella remained silent, the weight of her crimes hanging over her like a death sentence. She had killed his granddaughters. There would be no mercy for her.


“Take them away!" her grandfather commanded with chilling authority.His men moved swiftly, securing ropes around their necks and hoisting them to the ceiling. The air was thick with tension, and Lilly could feel the anger bubbling inside her, even from the other room.

She stared at the monitor, her eyes glued to the screen. Her breath caught as she watched them suffocate, only to be pulled down and tortured further. A hot knife seared their skin, and their screams echoed in the silence. Her grandfather's methodical cruelty matched the vengeance she had longed for. But it wasn't enough. Not yet. She'd demanded they suffer longer. She didn't want them to die quickly. They needed to know what it felt like to lose everything. For over an hour, Lilly watched her family's torment. Her grandfather,unyielding, never relented. He carved marks into their flesh, left scars that would never fade, each stroke a reminder of their treachery. Bella, the monster in disguise, had also killed his real daughter-in-law.Her punishment was even harsher.

Lilly's mind reeled with the new discovery-that Bella had also been responsible for her mother's death. A bitter fury coiled deep within her.But Alexander stood by her side, watching her, sensing the storm within her.


When the ordeal became too much to bear, Alexander stepped in,blocking the monitor with his body.


"Why are you blocking the screen?”Lilly demanded, her voice raw with frustration. "I haven't had enough yet."


"It's been over an hour already," he replied, his tone soft but resolute."That's enough."


"You're denying me my justice," she hissed, the anger in her eyes burning brighter than before. "I'm not done."

“Lilly, you don't need to witness any more of this. It's too much for you to bear." His hand gently combed through her hair, his touch tender,almost protective.

"I can handle it!" she snapped, her voice trembling. "I still want to see them suffer. I want to look them in the eye and make them understand what they've done to me, to my family." “You will. After they're locked away for good. After they've been sentenced to life," he promised her, his voice filled with determination. But even as he spoke, he could see the anguish in her eyes. Lilly wasn't just looking for revenge-she was searching for something deeper, something only she could understand.

Back in the chamber of punishment, the minutes dragged on, each second stretching as her grandfather's men worked methodically, coldly. Bella and Kate cried for mercy, pleading for an end, but their cries were ignored.No amount of begging would save them. Their fates were sealed.

Eventually, they collapsed, their bodies limp. Each time they fell unconscious, they were revived with ice-cold water, only to be subjected to more torture. Her grandfather didn't want them to die too quickly. His plan had always been for them to suffer and then rot away in prison.

The sounds of their torment finally ceased when her grandfather, satisfied with the punishment, left the room to cleanse his hands of the blood.

One of his men approached him, indicating three other men tied to chairs,gagged and trembling from what they'd witnessed.

“What should we do with them?" the guard asked.

"Dispose of them," her grandfather ordered coldly, not sparing them another glance.


The last thing he wanted was for Lilly to witness their deaths. Alexander had already ensured she would only see the aftermath of the punishment,a decision he knew she would later thank him for.


As her grandfather returned to the room where Lilly and Alexander waited.his heart clenched. Lilly was crying in Alexander's arms, the weight of it all crashing down on her.

In that moment, he realized the truth of it all-his daughter-in-law and granddaughters had been lost because of his failure to protect them. The betrayal that ran through their bloodlines had cost him everything,and now his own family was fractured beyond repair.

He swore to himself, he would never let this happen again.

**********

Back at home. Peter walked in to an oppressive silence. Victor, his ever-faithful aide, greeted him quietly. But there was an edge to the air,a tension that made Peter's skin crawl.

"Where is everyone?”he asked,eyes scanning the room.

Victor hesitated, as though weighing his words carefully."Lilly was here earlier,"he said, his voice barely a whisper.

Peter's heart sank. "Lilly? But... she was supposed to be in the hospital."His mind raced with worry.


Victor nodded. guiding Peter to the second-floor living room, where a shocking sight awaited. Peter's eyes widened as the TV flickered to life,revealing Bella and Kate, their heads shaved, their bodies marked with burns and scars.


"What... is going on?" Peter's voice cracked with disbelief. "Why are they being taken to prison?"


Victor remained silent, allowing the reporter to continue. The words sent Peter into a spiral of shock. The evidence laid bare before him,and the truth of theircrimes came crashing down like a storm. His body went cold as the report revealed the murders of his daughters,his wife-and the dark role Bella and Kate had played in his family's destruction. Peter stood motionless, his world shattering around him as the reality of the monstrous people he'd shared his life with became undeniable.
How could he have been so blind?
 

###Chapter 57

The judge's voice echoed through the courtroom,cold and final:"Based on all the evidence presented. I sentence Bella Blake and Kate Blake to life imprisonment for multiple charges. including manslaughter." The gavel struck,punctuating the silence that followed.

"All rise!" the court clerk called, signaling the end of the trial.

Everyone stood as the judge departed, leaving behind the weight of justice.Lilly's chest tightened as the finality of the verdict settled in. She had done it-she had succeeded in bringing them to justice,and the truth was now laid bare for the world to see. But as she watched Bella and Kate being led out through the back door, a sudden chill gripped her. Bella's smirk lingered in her mnind like a shadow, and something in that twisted smile set her heart racing with unease.

Alexander,standing close by,noticed the change in her demeanor. "What's wrong?"he asked,his voice laced with concern.

Lilly forced a smile, but it didn't reach her eyes. "Nothing, Just... relieved.Now my sisters and mother can rest in peace."

Alexander studied her closely, his sharp gaze sensing the depth of her unrest. He opened his mouth to speak, but the words died on his tongue as he chose not to press further, respecting her silence. Peter nodded, tears welling in his eyes. "I know everything, Lilly.Everything that happened... it's my fault. I destroyed our family. I lost your mother because of my betrayal, and now... I've lost my daughters.I'm ready to accept whatever punishment you think I deserve. Please, just...forgive me." her name, halting her steps. She froze, dread crawling up her spine as she turned to see Peter approaching.


Her frown deepened.

"We can leave if you don't want to talk to him," Alexandler offered,his voice quiet but firm.

Lilly hesitated for only a moment before answering, her voice low and steady. "I can't keep avoiding him forever. We need to have this conversation.”


Alexander nodded, his expression softening. “Do you want to speak with him privately?"

Lilly gave a brief nod, and with a reassuring kiss on her forehead,Alexander walked toward the car, leaving them alone.

Peter reached her, his face drawn and weary, as if the last few weeks had aged him years. He stood before her, his shoulders slumped under the weight of his remorse. "I'm sorry... please," he whispered,his voice cracking with guilt.

Lilly looked at him, fury and disbelief mixing with the sorrow in her heart."You're sorry?" she repeated, her voice trembling with emotion. His words, though heavy with regret, only fueled the anger burning within her."Why are you only realizing now how much you've ruined everything? Why?!" Lilly's voice cracked as the tears began to fall.

The onlookers outside the courthouse turned, sensing the tension in the air.Alexander, who had been watching from a distance, rushed over the moment he saw the tears in Lilly's eyes. His eyes locked on Peter with a fierce,protective glare, but he said nothing, focusing only on Lilly as he wiped her tears away.


“Do you want to leave now?" Alexander asked, his voice gentle but insistent.

Lilly nodded, her voice breaking. “Please take me away.”

Alexander didn't need to hear more. He pulled her into his arms, offering what little comfort he could. “Shh, it's okay. We're leaving now,"he murmured,guiding her to the car, his presence a steadying force.

Peter stood frozen, tears streaming down his face as he watched the car drive away. His heart clenched with the realization that it had taken him losing everything to understand the depth of his failure. His eyes lingered on the car, filled with regret, as he whispered to himself, "I won't stop seeking your forgiveness."


In the car, Lilly stared out the window, lost in her thoughts. She could feel Alexander's gaze on her, soft but unwavering. He placed his hand over hers,a simple gesture that brought a sense of peace she desperately needed.

"It's all over now," Alexander said quietly. Lilly nodded, though her heart was still heavy. "It's over." He moved closer, wrapping his arms around her and kissing her forehead. 
"Thinking about your father?"

Lilly's eyesclosed briefly as the emotions swirled within her.∘YesHe's so selfish."


"You were disappointed in him. I saw it in your eyes," Alexander said,his voice low and understanding.


She nodded again, feeling the weight of betrayal and disillusionment.“I just want this period to pass."

"It will," Alexander reassured her, brushing a stray lock of hair from her face."I'll make sure it does. So you can focus on our new family... on me,and our unborn child."


A week later, on the anniversary of her sisters' deaths, Lilly stood before her mirror, dressed in all black-gown, shoes,gloves,and a veil draped over her head. The weight of the day pressed heavily on her shoulders,but there was a strange comfort in the routine of honoring them.

She took the elevator down to the sitting room, where Alexander was reading the newspaper. His smile, warm and sincere, made her heart flutter despite the heaviness in her chest. The simple act of seeing him made everything feel more bearable.


“You look beautiful," he said, standing as she entered the room.His arms wrapped around her waist, pulling her into a gentle kiss. “Even in all black.”

Lilly blushed, a small smile tugging at her lips. "Thank you." Alexander cupped her cheek with his hand,his thumb brushing over her skin tenderly, "Where do you want to go first?The grave...or the prison?" Lilly hesitated, her mind weighing both options. "The prison first. I need to say my final piece."

Alexander studied her for a moment, as if sensing the weight of her decision. Then he nodded, a quiet understanding between them.“I'll be there with you."


They left for the women's prison, a journey of three hours that allowed Lilly time to settle her thoughts. When they arrived, the strict security measures gave her a sense of uneasy relief. The thought of Bella and Kate escaping haunted her nightmares, but seeing the prison's tight security calmed her. Alexander's own efforts to ensure their confinement brought her a measure of peace.


They were led into a VIP visitors' room, and though Lilly felt exhausted,she refused to let herself falter. She couldn't afford to.


Thirty minutes later, the door opened. Two female officers entered.escorting Bella and Kate-both in prison uniforms, disheveled and defeated. yet something in their eyes remained defiant.


Lilly's pulse quickened, a flood of emotions surging within her. Anger,sadness, and an odd sense of pity all collided in her chest. She had prepared herself for this moment, but nothing could have prepared her for seeing them so broken yet still capable of defiance.

As they took their seats across from Lilly and Alexander, Bella's eyes remained sharp, filled with a quiet rage, while Kate seemed resigned to her fate. Her once-strong spirit had crumbled. Lilly exhaled, steadying herself before speaking."I needed to see you both one last time," she began, her voice shaky but determined. "To understand why you did what you did... and to tell you that, despite everything,I hope you find some form of redemption here."
###Chapter 58
Upon their arrival at the prison, the tension in the air was palpable. Kate and Bella had no words for their visitors at first. As they were led into the room, they looked at Alexander, his expression cold and unreadable, and then shifted their gaze to Lilly. Despite their grim surroundings, there was still a flicker of emotion in Kate's eyes-an ache, a longing-for something lost. Lilly noticed it, but she wasn't interested in playing that game.

The glass barrier between them seemed to magnify the silence, but Lilly's resolve remained firm. She walked to a seat, sat down, and picked up the telephone. The air was thick with anticipation as Alexander stood behind her,watching with an intensity that mirrored her own.

Kate and Bella mirrored their actions, lifting the phones to their ears, their eyes never leaving Lilly.

Lilly's voice broke through the silence, her tone calm but laced with unspoken fury."How does it feel to be here? I bet you never imagined your lives would end like this." Her gaze never wavered from Bella. “You'Il rot in here for the rest of your lives. All the harm you've done to my family, it's time you paid for it."

Bella's eyes flashed for a split second-was it defiance? Lilly couldn't tell,and it unsettled her. She had expected Bella to react, to show some sign of the person she once knew, but Bella remained stone-faced. It was unnerving. Lilly leaned closer, her voice low and dangerous. “You'll regret ever crossing me. I will make sure you never see the light of day again." Her eyes locked with Bella's, searching for any hint of fear-but there was nothing. Turning her attention to Kate, Lilly's gaze softened just for a moment.but the venom in her words remained. "And you, Kate. You'll never get out of here. Not now, not ever. You think Alexander's going to come rescue you?You're wrong."

Kate's eyes flickered, but it was fleeting-she quickly masked the emotion,her fingers trembling around the receiver. Lilly knew that, deep down,Kate's feelings for Alexander hadn't disappeared. But it was irrelevant now. Lilly was no longer that naive girl.

With a final look at the two women, Lilly put the phone down and stood.“I said what I needed to say," she murmured, her voice steely as she turned away, her hand brushing against Alexander's as he walked her out.

As they drove away, the weight of the visit settled over her like a heavy fog."You did what you needed to," Alexander assured her, his voice steady."They won't escape. I've made sure of it."

Lilly didn't feel reassured. The unease that had gnawed at her since the trial still lingered. Bella was too calm, too collected-something wasn't right. She couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to this than met the eye.

Several hours later, they arrived at the graveyard. Lilly took the flowers from the bodyguards, her movements slow and deliberate. As they approached the family plot, she froze. Someone was kneeling by the graves,crying softly. It was Peter. Alexander stood at her side, his gaze hard as he observed the scene. Peter was a broken man, his shoulders hunched in sorrow, his eyes red-rimmed with regret. He had been there for over an hour, paying tribute to the daughters he had failed. The assistant standing off to the side had never seen him cry, and even he couldn't help but feel the weight of the moment.

Lilly's eyes narrowed, her pulse quickening. She wasn't prepared for this confrontation,not today.

Peter stood as he noticed their approach. His eyes were bloodshot, his movements sluggish. "I came to ask for their forgiveness,"he said,his voice cracking.

"You're leaving?"Lilly asked, her voice trembling with a mix of disbelief and anger.

Peter nodded slowly. "I'm leaving in three hours. I have to. I've lost everything." His voice was tinged with a quiet desperation.“I need to find a way to fix this. I promise I'll come back. I'll make things right."

Lilly shook her head, the weight of his words sinking deep into her.“Is this your solution? Leaving? Is this how you plan to make amends?"

"I'm not running away, Lilly,” Peter said softly, stepping toward her, his hand outstretched. But Lilly stepped back, her eyes filled with fury and disappointment.

“Then what exactly are you doing?" she demanded, her voice rising.“What do you want from me?"

Peter's face contorted with emotion,but before he could speak, Lilly's words cut through him. “Leave. Just leave, I don't want to hear any more.” He hesitated, his eyes filled with anguish. "Lilly-” “Leave!" she shouted, her voice echoing in the quiet cemetery. He nodded, defeated, and turned away, his assistant following him with a look of sympathy for the broken family left behind.

Lilly stood frozen for a moment, the tears that had been building finally spilling over. Alexander was there in an instant, his arms enveloping her in a comforting embrace. "It's okay," he murmured softly. "I'm here for you. You don't need him."

Her tears didn't stop, but his words soothed the pain, if only a little.When she finally pulled back, she took the flowers from the bodyguards and made her way to her sisters' graves. The quiet whispers of the wind felt like a conversation with the lost. She placed the flowers carefully,whispering a prayer for their souls before she stood, a sense of closure washing over her.

Alexander stood beside her, their fingers entwined."How do you feel now?”he asked, his voice gentle.

Lilly closed her eyes,feeling a sense of peace she hadn't known in years. “
I feel like I can breathe again. Like the weight of the world is finally lifting.”

Alexander's lips curled into a smile, his gaze full of love. "Good. Because now we can focus on what really matters-our child and our life together."

Lilly's smile mirrored his. "I love you, Alexander," she whispered,her heart full.

"I love you too," he said, his voice thick with emotion.

She suddenly found the courage to ask what had been on her mind.“When did you start feelingthis way about me?"

“From the first day I saw you," Alexander replied, his tone unwavering. Lilly's eyes widened. "From the very first day?"

"Yes," he confirmed, a small, affectionate smile playing on his lips.“Ididn't know it then, but when your grandfather took you away, I almost lost my mind. That's when I knew."

Tears threatened to rise again, but this time, they were tears of happiness."I love you too. I always have."

And in that moment, everything felt right. The past was behind them, and the future-together-was all that mattered.


The bodyguards respectfully turned away, allowing the couple their moment of peace, as Lilly and Alexander shared a kiss, the promise of a future filled with love and a new life together.

 
************

THREE YEARS LATER.
###Chapter 59

**THREE YEARS LATER

The air inside the conference hall was thick with tension. A hundred executives sat at attention, their eyes trained on the man at the head of the table: Alexander Kane, the ruthless CEO of the Kane Corporation,whose reputation for being unforgiving and calculating was legendary acrosS Aurora City. He sat with unyielding authority, the sharp lines of his face betraying nothing of the storm brewing beneath his cold exterior.

A faint sound broke the oppressive silence-the gentle breathing of a child asleep on Alexander's shoulde. His three-year-old daughter, Viola,had become a fixture in these high-stakes meetings. Her presence was both a symbol of Alexander's complex. fiercely protective nature and an unspoken challenge to anyone daring enough to disrupt the sacred calm surrounding her.

Before the meeting had begun. Alexander had made one thing crystal clear to everyone present: *Not a single soul would dare disturb his daughter*.His directive had the effect of turning even the most seasoned executives into silent, sweating statues. Who else but Alexander Kane would bring his child to such an intense setting? And who else would fire an employee with a single word if their slightest mistake disturbed his daughter's peaceful slumber? It was a dangerous gamble, but in this room, no one dared question it. The presenter stood, voice shaky and slow,carefully pacing through his slides. His every word was weighed, measured, and scrutinized under the watchful gaze of the powerful men and women surrounding him. Every so often, his eyesflickered nervously toward the small figure nestled against her father's chest, her innocent face framed by her father's broad shoulder. But then it happened. A chair scraped back abruptly, its legs screeching as a director stood too quickly. The chaos that followed felt like a storm cracking through the silence-a loud crash as the chair tumbled to the ground.

The room went still.

Alexander's gaze flickered from the presentation on the screen to his daughter, whose small body stirred, the delicate sound of her whimpering filling the room. Viola rubbed her eyes with tiny fists, a frown forming as she looked up at her father, her innocent face contorted with confusion and distress.

Alexander's eyes narrowed. his lips pulling into a thin, implacable line. His voice, when it came, was ice-cold, cuttingthrough the tension with brutal finality.


"You're fired. Get out."

The words struck like a whip. The director's facedrained of color,panic flooding his chest as he scrambled for any shred of dignity. But there was no point. Alexander's word was law, and his punishment was swift. The man fled, leaving the room in stunned silence.

Viola,still tearful, clung to her father, her cries echoing softly in the sterile room. The air felt thick-charged, almost suffocating. Alexander's attention never wavered. His steely eyes remained fixed on the group of executives, all of them motioning to make their exit."What are you waiting for?" His voice was hard,leaving no room for negotiation. "Leave. Now." The remaining executives fled in a flurry of motion, the room emptied in moments. Only James remained, silently standing by the door, his eyes flickering between the father and the child.


Alexander moved with precision, his tone softening as he turned back to his daughter, his anger melting away. He gently wiped the tears from her cheeks, his hands tender as he comforted her.

"Shh... It's okay. Daddy's here. Stop crying now."

Viola's sobs slowly quieted, and her face softened into a contented pout.Alexander stood, cradling her against him, his arms protective and firm as he walked toward his office. James followed quietly behind them, the weight of the aborted meeting hanging over him.

As soon as the door to Alexander's office clicked shut. Alexander adjusted his daughter in his arms, the intensity of the meeting lingering in his eyes despite his apparent calm. His gaze shifted to James.

"What's the situation?" he asked, his tone authoritative but distracted by his daughter's innocent presence.

James hesitated,glancing at Viola. The project they had been discussing was urgent-critical. even-but at this moment, nothing seemed to matter more than the child nestled in Alexander's arms.

"The meeting we just canceled, sir... It was crucial. We need to submit the finalized project plan to the government by tomorrow." Viola's large eyes, innocent yet sharp, looked up at James, as if understanding the gravity of the situation. She'd been the cause of the disruption. yet her father's focus was unwavering. It was as if nothing could deter him from his commitments. Alexander nodded, still holding Viola close. "The project from the first presentation will suffice. Send that to thegovernment tomorrow."

James exhaled in relief. "Yes, sir. I'll make sure it gets done."

With the weight of the decision lifted, James stepped back, preparing to exit the office. Alexander's attention, however, was now entirely focused on his daughter, his icy demeanor melting in her presence.


Viola had barely settled on the couch before Alexander's voice broke the quiet again.

"You need to stay there for a while, alright?" he said gently, motioning to the couch where an array of treats awaited her.


Viola glanced at the treats, her small face scrunching in indecision. "Only if you promise to take me to the airport to pick up Mommy," she bargained,her voice sweet but filled with the kind of quiet power only a child could possess.


Alexander sighed, his resolve slipping just a little. "I already told you,you can't go-it's too late."

Her lip began to quiver, and tears pooled in her eyes. Alexander,despite himself, relented. "Alright, I'll take you."

Viola's face lit up with triumph, and she jumped into his arms. planting a kiss on his cheek. "Yay!" A rare, soft smile touched Alexander's lips as he kissed her forehead.He set her down gently and watched as she made her way to the couch,already excited by the promise of treats. For a moment, the office was still. The man who commanded millions,whose every decision rippled through the business world,was now lost in the simple joy of a child's smile.
As Viola munched happily on her snacks, Alexander turned back to his work. The documents on his desk were a mountain, demanding his attention, yet somehow, with Viola nearby, the burden seemed lighter. He was Alexander Kane-the cold,calculating CEO, a man of great power-but in this moment, he was just a father, quietly balancing the weight of the world with the weight of love.
###Chapter 60

Lilly's gaze drifted out of the airplane window as the city below grew larger, a smile slowly forming on her lips. After three long weeks of business travel, the familiar sight of home had never seemed so sweet. The time away had been grueling-not just for the work but for the ache of missing her family. She had left behind her little girl and her husband,Alexander, who had made it clear he wasn't happy about the length of her trip. The thought of seeing him again, of being in his arms, made her pulse quicken. But she was certain-now that she was back, he wouldn't let her take another trip like that again anytime soon.

As the airplane descended, her mind drifted back to their video call the day before. She couldn't help but chuckle at the memory of teasing him about not being able to come home today. His reaction had been instant-anger, sharp and clear. She'd had to quickly backpedal, trying to calm him.Then, in an attempt to keep the peace, he showed her their daughter,fast asleep in their bed, refusing to sleep alone because she didn't want the house to feel empty. It was an unspoken message of his own loneliness,one that made her heart ache.

The memory warmed her as shegazed out the window. She hated being away from them, but her role as the president of Blake Group had demanded it. Late nights, endless meetings, constant travel-life had become a whirlwind. But now, with the weight of the past few weeks behind her, she was determined to change things. Regular hours,more time for family-this was going to be her new normal. Stepping off the plane, Lilly was flanked by her assistant and her ever-present personal guard. She scanned the bustling crowd, her heart searching for the familiar, comforting sight of Alexander. "Mommy!" The high-pitched voice cut through the noise, and Lilly turned just in time to see her daughter barreling toward her, tiny legs carrying her with unrestrained excitement.

Lilly's heart swelled as she dropped her hand luggage, rushing to scoop up her little girl. "My baby, I missed you so much!" she exclaimed, lifting her daughter into her arms and spinning her around. Her laughter rang through the air, pure and unrestrained.


Her daughter beamed, touching Lilly's long blonde hair and planting a kiss on her cheek. "I missed you too, Mommy," she said, her voice a soft whisper.

"And I missed you, my darling," Lilly murmured, spinning her around once more, her laughter mixing with her daughter's. The unexpected joy of this reunion filled her to the brim, and she almost forgot everything else.


"But Daddy missed you more," her daughter added, with a knowing look in her eyes.

Lilly froze,her smile faltering as she glanced around. The crowd had gathered around them, snapping photos of the perfect family reunion, but something was missing. She didn't see Alexander anywhere.

"Where's Daddy?" she asked, her voice slipping with a hint of confusion.

"In the car," her daughter replied casually. A wave of discomfort washed over Lilly. He was waiting in the car? Not here to greet her himself? Her mind raced as she held her daughter close,trying to push down the unease that bubbled up inside her. What was going on? "Let's go," she said, forcing a smile for her daughter's sake, even as her mind churned with questions.

Her assistant had already collected her bags, and they moved quickly through the crowds, cameras flashing around them, but Lilly's focus remained on the missing presence of her husband.


Outside, several sleek black luxury cars stood in a neat line, drawing the attention of bystanders who couldn't help but admire the polished vehicles.But it was the first car that caught her eye-specifically, the man sitting inside,checking his watch with restless impatience.

Alexander.


He watched her approach, his expression guarded, his posture stiff. She couldn't read him. It had been a long three weeks, but his distance now-his decision to let their daughter come in to greet her while he stayed in the car-wasn't lost on her.


The moment she reached the car, she slid into the back seat, still holding her daughter in her arms. Alexander was silent beside her, his calm gaze meeting hers, but there was something in his eyes that made her pulse spike. He had been distant, and it didn't sit right with her.

She leaned her head on his chest, breathing in the scent of him,the familiar, comforting feeling of his presence. "I missed you," she murmured.lifting her face to meet his eyes, hoping for the reassurance she craved."Didn't you miss me?" His hand slid around her waist, pulling her closer. "I missed you so much,"he said, his voice low, before he kissed her deeply, passionately. It was everything she'd longed for during their time apart. And yet,something felt off, as if there were words left unspoken between them. Their kiss deepened, growing more urgent, until Alexander pulled back.his breath ragged. "If I kept kissing you like this, we'd make headlines again," he said, his voice rough with restraint.

Lilly's cheeks flushed, and she pouted playfully. "You didn't want to greet me?" she teased, still trying to piece together the odd distance between them.


Alexander's fingers ran through her hair, his gaze unreadable. "IfI had.we'd have ended up all over the tabloids by tomorrow morning," he replied with a half-smile. He was right. The last time they had shown affection publicly, the backlash had been swift and cruel. The internet had exploded with jealousy, and Lilly had been the target of hate-filled comments. Alexander had been furious, making sure those who insulted her paid the price.

Lilly leaned in, pressing a kiss to his lips, a suggestion lingering in the air."Then we can just keep it between us," she whispered,her voice hushed.

A knowing smile curled on his lips. "Agreed."

As the car rolled toward home, Lilly's mind continued to swirl with questions. Her daughter had fallen asleep by the time they reached the house. Lilly gently tucked her into bed, kissing her cheek before leaving the room. But when she entered their master bedroom, Alexander was nowhere to be found. His study, she knew, was where he'd be. Seizing the opportunity for a moment of peace, she decided to indulge in a warm bath. The soothing water relaxed her muscles, and before she knew it, she'd drifted off to sleep. When she woke, she found herself in bed, Alexander's arms wrapped tightly around her. The softness of his embrace was comforting, but his stillness only raised more questions.

The next morning, Lilly found herself staring at her reflection, shock running through her at the marks on her neck. Her fingers traced them.her mind running wild. What had happened during the night?

As she turned to face him, Alexander's smug smile said everything.

"Isn't it beautiful?" he asked, his voice dripping with satisfaction.

Lilly opened her mouth to protest but closed it, speechless. Instead,she sighed, wondering where her plans for the day would fit in with Alexander's ever-present control.

"Where are you going?" he asked, his tone more commanding than curious.
"You're not working today. You'll stay home and be a good wife."

Lilly turned to help him with his tie, her fingers brushing against his chest.
"I'll pick Viola up from school, then take her to see Grandma," she replied,a smile tugging at her lips.


Alexander studied her for a moment before speaking, his eyes dark with something she couldn't quite place. "Make sure you're both back by 7 p.m.



The weight in his voice had her pause. Why the insistence on an early return? But she nodded, hoping it was nothing more than a father's protective instincts. As he kissed her forehead and left the room, Lilly's thoughts lingered on his words. There was something he wasn't telling her-something beneath the surface. And she intended to find out what it was.
###Chapter 61

The teacher held young Viola's hand, who hopped excitedly as they made their way to the parking lot where parents waited in their cars to pick up their children from school. Unlike most kids who were greeted by at least one parent. Viola was always met by her nanny and two bodyguards due to her parents' busy schedules. The entire school knew who her parents were and understood why they couldn't pick her up themselves.


Mrs. Hannah, the middle-aged school teacher, walked Viola to the familiar car that always arrived to collect her. The car door opened, and instead of the nanny stepping out as expected, Viola's mother emerged. Viola's eyes widened in surprise, and she released her teacher's hand, running toward her mother.


Lilly bent down and opened her arms wide to embrace her daughter.


“Mommy!”

Lilly hugged her tightly and kissed her cheek. "Happy to see Mommy?"Viola nodded enthusiastically, bouncing in her mother's arms, overjoyed that her mother had come to pick her up.

Lilly stood up, holding her daughter, and turned to the teacher."Hello,Mrs. Hannah," she said, bowing her head respectfully.

Seeing such a high-profile woman bow to her made Mrs. Hannah feel uncomfortable; she felt it shouId be the other way around, especially since Lilly was the child's parent.

“Good afternoon, Mrs. Blake," Mrs. Hannah replied, bowing and smiling.

"Thank you for being such a good teacher and for always looking after Viola." Even though she didn't pick Viola up personally,she always received reports from the nanny and bodyguards about how the teacher took care of her daughter.


"It's nothing; as her teacher, it is my duty to look after her."

"Thank you," Lilly repeated, bowing again.


Other parents who had come to collect their children watched Lilly with interest. They were aware of her influential status, not just as Alexander Blake's wife but also as the president and future heir of the Blake empire.

The school catered to the elite, but there was always a hierarchy,with some wealthy families outshining others. Many mothers saw this as an opportunity to gain Lilly's favor and instructed their children to befriend Viola, hoping it would bring them closer to Lilly.


After a brief conversation with the teacher, Lilly got into the car with Viola.who waved goodbye to Mrs. Hannah.

"How was school today? Did you make any new friends?" Lilly asked as the car drove away from the school.

"School was fine, but I didn't make any new friends."

“Why not?” “Because they only want to be friends because their parents told them to."Viola looked at her mother, seeing her confused expression. "What do you mean?” "Their mothers want to be close to you, so they tell their kids to be friends with me," Viola explained, recalling what a classmate had told her. Lilly nodded, now understanding. "Then just be friends with those who truly want to be your friend."

Viola smiled and nodded. "I have two real friends."

Lilly knew who her daughter meant, as she was close to their parents as well. It seemed Viola was content with having a few genuine friends instead of many superficial ones.

"What do you want to eat,sweetheart?"

"I want chicken," Viola said,her mouth watering at the thought.

Lilly smiled; her daughter loved chicken. “Alright, we'll get some chicken and other things, then head to great-grandma's place."

"Yay, I want to see great-grandma!" Viola exclaimed excitedly.

Lilly laughed at her daughter's enthusiasm.

Old Mrs. Blake had two reasons to be thankful: first, that Alexander had learned to love Lilly and remained married to her; and second,that she had lived long enough to experience being a great-grandmother.Viola,at just three years old, was already displaying remarkable intelligence.something she had inherited from her parents.

Mrs. Blake stood smiling as Viola ran toward her and hugged her legs.

“Great-grandma, I missed you!" "And I missed you too, my smart girl.” Viola blushed; she loved it when her great-grandmother called her smart.While others called her cute, her great-grandmother always praised her intelligence. "Have you eaten?"

"No,but we bought chicken."

"Your favorite!"

Viola nodded."Yes."

"Alright. let's go inside. I also had something made for you to eat with the chicken."


Viola took her great-grandmother's hand, and they walked inside together.

Lilly followed behind, smiling. It always amazed her how Viola seemed to forget about her and Alexander whenever she was with her great-grandparents.


As they stepped into the house, the aroma of freshly baked bread and roasted vegetables wafted through the air. The mansion, grand and elegant,was filled with the warmth of family memories and the charm of old-world sophistication. Viola's eyes sparkled as she looked around,remembering the many happy moments she had spent there.


“Great-grandma, can we go to the garden after lunch?" Viola asked, her eyes pleading.


"Of course, my dear. We can pick some flowers for your mommy," Mrs.Blake replied, her face lighting up with a smile. Lilly watched the exchange with a heart full of love. Seeing her daughter bond so deeply with her great-grandmother made all the sacrifices she and Alexander made worth it. She knew they were building a legacy of love and strength that would carry through generations. They settled at the dining table, which was adorned with a beautiful lace tablecloth and fine china. The house staff had outdone themselves.preparing a feast fit for royalty. Besides the chicken that Viola loved.there were mashed potatoes, steamed vegetables, and a variety of salads.

"Let's wash our hands first," Lilly reminded Viola, leading her to the sink.They washed up quickly and returned to the table, where Mrs. Blake was already seated.


The meal was a joyous affair, filled with laughter and stories. Viola shared tales from school. talking about her two close friends and the various activities they enjoyed together. Lilly and Mrs. Blake listened attentively,encouraging her with smiles and nods.


After lunch, they made their way to the garden. The Blake family garden was a sprawling expanse of greenery, with vibrant flowers,towering trees.and well-manicured lawns. Viola ran ahead, her laughter echoing through the space as she chased butterflies and picked flowers.

Lilly and Mrs. Blakestrolled behind her, their pace leisurely. "She really is a smart girl," Mrs. Blake said, watching Viola with pride. “You and Alexander have done a wonderful job.”

"Thank you, Grandma. We try our best. It's not always easy with our busy schedules, but we make sure to spend quality time with her whenever we can,”Lilly replied.

“You're doing just fine. Family is what matters most, and you're showing her that every day," Mrs. Blake reassured her.

They spent the afternoon in the garden, basking in the sunshine and the joy of being together. Viola's infectious energy and enthusiasm brought life to every corner of the garden. She made flower crowns, picked bouquets, and even attempted to climb a small tree, much to Lilly's amusement and mild alarm.


"Be careful, darling!" Lilly called out, laughing as Viola wobbled but managed to balance herself.


"I'm okay, Mommy!" Viola replied, her face flushed with excitement.

As the afternoon turned to evening, they decided it was time to head back home. Viola, now tired from all the running and playing, held her mother's hand as they walked back to the car.


"Did you have a good time, sweetheart?" Lilly asked,smoothing her daughter's hair.

"The best time ever, Mommy! I love spending time with you and great-grandma." Viola replied, her eyes shining with happiness.

Back in the car, Viola quickly fell asleep, exhausted from her day of fun.Lilly looked at her daughter's peaceful face and felt a deep sense of contentment. Despite the challenges and demands of her career,moments like these made everything worthwhile.

As they drove back, Lilly reflected on the balance she and Alexander had found between their professional lives and their roles as parents. It wasn't always perfect, but they had created a supportive environment for Viola,filled witha love and security.
###Chapter 62

Sandra had spent a year and six months in a coma and underwent therapy to make a full recovery. Now, after an additional year and a few months, her life had returned to normal. She was no longer the reckless girl who loved to overspend and was irresponsible. The accident and long coma had completely transformed her, and she now held a position in the family company and had been entrusted with her inheritance by Alexander,who recognized how much she had changed.


Sandra walked into the house and was greeted by Camila.

"Welcome, Miss Sandra," Camila said with a respectful bow.

"Thank you. Camila. Do we have guests?" she asked, noticing the noise coming from the dining area.


"Yes,your sister-in-law and niece are visiting."

"Is my sister-in-law back?"

Camila nodded.

Sandra smiled and headed to the dining area. She found three people at the table, enjoying a late lunch. Little Viola was busy devouring chicken.

Sandra smiled at her niece's cuteness, knowing how much she loved chicken. "Look who's back," Sandra said, hugging Lilly from behind. "I missed you.sister-in-law." Lilly smiled warmly. "I missed you too. Come, sit," she said, patting the seat next to her. Sandra greeted her grandmother, then went over to kiss Viola on the cheek."Hey,cutie,how was school?"


Viola shook her head, indicating her mouth was full of chicken, a sign she couldn't talk. Her mother had taught her not to speak while eating. and she was trying to be obedient.


Sandra laughed and kissed her forehead before sitting next to Lilly.

"How was your trip,sister-in-law?"

"It went well. By the way, how many times have I told you to call me Lilly?" Lilly felt slightly offended that Sandra always referred to her as sister-in-law despite their close relationship.

Sandra shook her head. "I can't call you by your name. Alexander insists on the utmost respect for you, and not calling you by your name is part of that."


Lilly laughed. "He won't mind; I'll talk to him."

"He's made it clear that if I callyou by your name, he'll tell Viola to stop calling me aunty," Sandra said, making Lilly sigh. Alexander could be quite petty sometimes. "I'll talk to him about that."

"Okay,if you say so."

Grandma Helen, who had been listening, smiled. "Have you had lunch?"she asked, knowing Sandra often skipped meals. "I had a snack, Grandma." "A snack is not a proper meal." "I'll just eat dinner later." "No,have somnething to eat now," Grandma Helen insisted, starting to fill a plate for her.

"No,Grandma, if I eat now. I'll have to skip dinner since it's already 5 p.m."


"Fine, but I know you plan to skip dinner even if you don't eat now. So,eat up." Grandma Helen instructed.

Sandra sighedand nodded. "Okay, Grandma."

Lilly smiled, then glanced at her daughter, whose face was oily from the chicken. Viola had pushed away all the vegetables on her plate and focused solely on the chicken, which Lilly had deboned to make it easier for her to eat.


Seeing this, Lilly sighed tiredly. No wonder her father had reduced the number of chickens Viola ate to encourage her to eat more vegetables. Now,
she regretted buying the chicken.

"Sweetheart," Lilly called.

Viola looked up and smiled at her mother.

"You're not eating the vegetables," Lilly pointed out.


Viola glanced at her plate and realized she had indeed ignored the vegetables. She blinked and looked up at her mother. "Eat the vegetables, or no more chicken for a whole month." Viola's eyes filled with tears. "Noooo." "I'm serious, Viola." She pouted and looked sadly at the chicken in her hand before putting it down and starting to eat the vegetables.

Grandma Helen patted her head and smiled at her obedience. "Good girl."she praised her great-granddaughter.


"When is your grandfather's birthday again?"

"Next Saturday,Grandma."

"And you haven't started preparations?"

"Preparations have already started. Grandfather has people handling it. It's his 80th birthday, and he wants it to be grand. He says I'm too busy with the company to handle the preparations myself. I insisted, but he refused."


"But you're still going to get him a gift, right?"


"I already did. I got something for him when I traveled. He's going to love it."


"Good,good." Grandma Helen said.

After spending another couple of hours with Grandma Helen and Sandra.Lilly and Viola headed home before it got too late. When they arrived, Alexander received a text from his men confirming their safe arrival. He put down his phone and dialed a number. The person on the other end answered on the first ring."Do whatever it takes to ensure she stays in prison," Alexander said before hanging up after gettíng a response. "Really? Again?" Richard sighed. Alexander shot him a cold look.

"Don't you think she's suffered enough? She's already paid for her crimes.
1

"Richard is right. It's enough. Stop extending her sentence. The court sentenced her to 15 years, and she's served that. She should have been released three years ago, but you extended it by three years, and now you want to add more?" Ethan said.


Alexander ignored them, continuing with his paperwork.

"Are you seriously working now? We're supposed to be having drinks and catching up," Ethan said, but Alexander paid no attention.


"She's your mother," Richard said, which was enough to make Alexander leave what he was doing and charge towards Richard.


In a flash, Alexander grabbed Richard by the collar and punched him,sending him to the ground. Ethan and Richard were taken aback by the speed and force of the attack.


Richard touched his lip; which was bleeding. The look on Alexander's face was so dark that Richard, usually unafraid, felt a pang of fear. He had made the mistake of referring to her as Alexander's mother, knowing fully well how much he despised that. "Say it again, and see what happens," Alexander warned, staring into his eyes. Richard got up and rolled up his sleeve."We might as well settle this.Whether you like it or not, you need to hear the truth." Sensing what was about to happen and who would likely get hurt, Ethan stepped in front of Alexander, whose fist was already clenched.

"Please. Alexander, let it go." Ethan pleaded. They had come to hang out.not fight.


"Not until he knows not to repeat himself." Alexander's cold voice rang out.
###Chapter 63

It was 10 pm, and Alexander still hadn't returned home. Lilly,growing increasingly worried, tried calling him twice, but he didn't answer. This was unusual, as Alexander typically picked up her calls immediately. She recalled him menationing he would be hanging out with Richard and Ethan,so she decided to give Ethan a call. After the first ring. he picked up.

"Lilly?" he answered, his voice slightly strained.

"Hi, Ethan. Is Alexander with you? He's not answering his phone," Lilly inquired. anxiety lacing her tone.


Ethan, standing outside Sophia's office,glanced towards Alexander,who was sitting nearby. He wasn't sure how to tell Lilly that Alexander and Richard had a fight, resulting in Richard being hospitalized. He took a deep breath, trying to keep his voice steady.


"He's fine and will be home soon..."

Before he could finish, Sophia took the phone from his hand, her face stern and concerned.


"Sophia? What's going on?" Lilly asked, her worry escalating.

Sophia gave Ethan a cold look before walking away to speak privately with Lilly.


"Hello? Hello, Ethan?" Lilly's voice quivered on the other end. "It's me, Sophia," "Sophia, did something happen?" Lilly's heart raced. "Yes,something did."

Sophia's voice carried an edge of frustration and concern. Lilly stood up from the couch, her mind racing. "Is Alexander okay? What's going on?"she pressed.


"Alexander and my husband fought, and they're both in the hospital right now," Sophia revealed.


Sophia and Richard had married two years ago and now had a toddler named Theo.


"What? Why? Are they badly hurt?" Lilly asked. panic setting in.

"Richard is."

Lilly could hear the pain in Sophia's voice. "I'm coming over," she said,hanging up quickly. She changed out of her nightclothes and hurried out of the room. She checked on Viola, who was sound asleep, before heading downstairs.


"Ma'am, are you going somewhere?" Clara asked, noticing Lilly's hurried pace.

"Yes. Clara. Please look after Viola. I'm going to the hospital and will be back."


"Is everything alright, ma'am?" Clara asked, concern evident in her voice. "I'll explain when I return, Clara," Lilly replied, rushing out the door. Clara nodded,worried but not pressing further. The fact that Alexander wasn't home yet only added to her concern. "Ma'amn, where are you headed at this hour? The boss instructed you not to leave the house at night." Pedro said, seeing her step out.

"He's in the hospital, Pedro. Take me there now," Lilly instructed firmly.

"The boss is in the hospital?" Pedro asked, surprised.

"Yes,now get the car," Lilly insisted.

Pedro nodded and quickly fetched a bulletproof Audi from the garage. He drove her to the hospital without delay.

Upon arriving, Lilly took the elevator to Sophia's floor. As she approached Sophia's office, she saw Alexander sitting on a bench with a bandaged hand.


"Alexander!" she exclaimed, rushing towards him. She hugged him tightly,inspecting him for injuries. Aside from his bandaged hand, he seemed relatively unscathed. This meant Richard must be the one badly hurt.What had happened?

"What are you doing here?" Alexander asked, his voice tinged with frustration.


"Why did you and Richard fight? Sophia said you two fought. I've never seen you fight before," Lilly questioned, concern evident in her eyes.

"Why didn't you just caIl instead of coming here?" Alexander retorted.

"I gave you two missed calls. Why didn't you pick up?" Lilly countered Alexander stared at her in silence for a moment, then stood up, pulling her along with him. "Let's go home," he said curtly. "I need to see Richard first," Lilly insisted, trying to walk away,but he held her back. Sophia will take care of him. Let's go." Alexander replied.

Lilly pulled her hand free and walked into Sophia's office. She saw Sophia tending to Richard, who was severely injured. Unlike Alexander, Richard was in bad shape.


"Richard," Lilly said softly,approaching them.

Sophia turned to her, her expression softening. "Lilly, you're here."

"How did this happen?" Lilly asked.her voice trembling.

"Didn't Alexander tell you?" Sophia asked,surprised.

"He didn't explain why you both fought," Lilly replied, glancing at Richard.

Richard sighed deeply. "Wait until he tells you himself," he said, indicating it wasn't his place to explain.


"Alexander is still angry, so you'd better take him home. I don't want another fight," Sophia advised seriously.


Lilly nodded. "Get well soon, Richard," she said, turning to leave.Whatever had caused Alexander to fight Richard so fiercely, it must have been significant.


Outside the office, she found Alexander waiting. She looked at him briefly before walking past him towards the elevator. She heard his footsteps behind her, indicating he was following. As the elevator doors opened, Ethan stepped out. "Lilly, you came," he said, about to say more but stopping when he saw Alexander. "Good night, you two," Ethan said, walking past them. Lilly entered the elevator, followed by Alexander. They rode in silence.


Reaching the uinderground garage, Lilly got into the back seat of Alexander's car. He joined her, instructing the chauffeur to drive home. Pedro followed in the car he had driven Lily in.


Lilly glanced at Alexander's bandaged wrist and sighed, feeling a mix of frustration and concern. She looked at his face, noting the calm demeanor that replaced his earlier anger.


"What happened?" she asked again. "Richard is in a bad shape. Why would you fight him?"

"Friends quarrel," Alexander replied shortly.

"What kind of quarrel leads to this. Alexander?" Lilly pressed.

"You don't need to know," he snapped.

"I don't need to know?" Lilly repeated,disbelief in her voice.

"Yes," he said firmly.

"Fine," Lilly said, turning to look out the window, ignoring him.

Alexander watched her until they arrived home. She stepped out and headed upstairs to their room.


She changed into her nightclothes and fouand Alexander in the room.Ignoring him, she triedI to pass, but he pulled her back. "What?" she asked,exasperated. "Don't be like this," Alexander pleaded. "Why not, when you're keeping things from me?" she retorted.

"Things?" he asked,feigning ignorance.

"I know there's a serious reason you fought Richard, but you won't tell me.
What's wrong?" she pressed, searching his eyes for answers.

Alexander remained silent, and Lilly pulled away again.

"Are you really going to bed angry?" he asked.

"Yes, if that's what you want," she replied.

He sighed. "It was a friend's quarrel. We'll sort it out."

Realizing it was futile, Lilly gave up. "I'll sleep now. I have work tomorrow."


Alexander left the room,and Lilly sighed tiredly.

The next morning. Lilly woke up to find Alexander cuddling her.She stared at his peaceful face, then remembered the previous night. Thinking of Richard's injuries, she grew angry again.

Lilly traced his face with her hand, waking him. He smiled. "Good morning."


"Mm," she responded, still upset.

"No good morning for me?" he asked,teasing. "No," she  replied,firm. He kissed her. "But I can get a kiss." "Stolen kiss," she said, trying to get up, but he tightened his hold. "Where are you going?" he asked.


"Work,"she replied.

"It's Saturday," he reminded her.

"I work on Saturdays, and so do you," she said, matter-of-factly.


"Not today. We're spending it with Viola," he declared.

She wanted to. but she had an uargent meeting with her grandfather."There's a meeting. Grandfather will be there."

"Postpone it." Alexander insisted.

"I can't," she argued.

"You will," he said firmly.

Alexander was determined to spend the day with his family,meeting or not.
###Chapter 64

"What do you mean the meeting was called off?" Caleb shouted,his voice echoing through the office. His face was flushed with anger as he glared at Lilly's assistant, who had just come to inform him that the crucial meeting he had traveled for was abruptly canceled. Caleb had meticulously planned his schedule around this important meeting, and now he was being told it wasn't happening.

"My granddaughter wouldn't cancel such an important gathering without a valid reason!" he exclaimed, frustration evident in his tone.

"Sir.,, sir, it was her husband, Mr. Kane, who called off the meeting on her behalf." Karina, Lilly's assistant, stammered, her voice quivering under Caleb's intense scrutiny. She could feel the weight of his disappointment and anger.

"Alexander did what?" Calet's eyes widened with disbelief.

"Yes,sir. He called and canceled the mesting" Karina repeated, her hands trembling slightly as she held onto her clipboard.

Caleb clenched his teeth, his jaw tightening as he processed this information."Hand me my phone. Victor," he commanded sharply.turning to his loyal aide who stood meudby.  Victor promptly handed over the cell phone, sensing the urgency in Caleb's demand. Caleb dialed Lilly's number with quick, precise movements.Alexander was already exerting control over every aspect of her life. Why did he feel the need to interfere with her professional responsibilities too?The phone rang for a few seconds before someone picked up. "Lilly." Caleb began, his voice stem. "It's Alexander" came the calm response from the other end of the line.

Caleb pulled the phone away from his ear,double-checking the number on the screen to ensure he had dialed correctly. Frowning, he placed the phone back to his ear. "Hand the phone to Lilly.What gives you the right to answer her calls?" he demanded angrily,furious that Alexander had the audacity to pick up when he saw it was her grandfather calling.

“Because I'm her husband, and what's hers is mine." Alexander said calmly, his gaze fixed on Lilly, who was sleeping peacefully beside him. He spoke softly to avoid waking her,his tone steady and unflappable.

Caleb's grip tightened on the phone, his knuckles turning white."Give her the phone this instant!" he shouted, his patience wearing thin.

“I can't." Alexander replied, his voice still calm.

“What did you just say?” Caleb's voice rose in incredulity. The young man was pushing all his buttons, and he regretted not ensuring they divorced when he had the chance.

"She is sleeping,” Alexander explained, glancing again at the sleeping Lilly.his expression softening as he watched her.

"Sleeping?" Caleb could hardly believe what he was hearing."Victor,what time is it?”


"10 am,sir," Victor responded promptly. “10 am,and she is still asleep?" Caleb's voice was filled with disbelief and irritation. “Yes, grandfather-in-law," Alexander replied, maintaining his calm demeanor. “Mygranddaughter wouldn't be sleeping at this hour. You must have done something to her."Caleb accused, his mind racing with suspicions.

Alexander looked at the sleeping Lilly again, tracingthe faint marks he had left on her neck earlier that morning. If making love to his wife and leaving her exhausted was the same thing as drugging her, then he would gladly continue to do so, he thought wryly.

"So now you're silent, you insolent young man!" Caleb shouted."Mark my words, she will leave you once her feelings for you fade." he threatened.His granddaughter didn't need him; she was an heiress with her own strength and independence.

Alexander's face darkened at the statement. He hadn't wanted to marry or have a child due to past experiences, but after finding and loving Lilly,he couldn't imagine letting her go. If she ever tried to leave him,he would never allow it and would rather keep her confined at home.


“And you think I will just let her go?" Alexander asked, his voice filled with quiet determination.


"We'll see about that. Meanwhile, I want to know why you canceled her meeting. What right do you have?" Caleb demanded, his voice regaining its authoritative tone.


"I canceled it on her behalf because she's not coming to the office today.You took her away from me and our daughter for three weeks to secure an international contract. Now, I want to spend the weekend with my family," Alexander explained, his voice firm yet calm.


For the first time, Caleb was speechless, He had indeed separated the family for three weeks, leaving his great-granddaughter without a mother.It was only right for them to spend the weekend together. Caleb cleared his throat, attempting to regain his composure. "Don't you dare answer her phone again if I call. I will make sure she leaves you," he threatened before abruptly hanging up.

Alexander stared at the phone with a cold expression, then turned his gaze to Lilly. "Are you planning to leave me?" he whispered softly, though he already knew the answer in his heart.

***

"Daddy!” Viola called out, her tiny voice filled with excitement as she stood up from where she was playing with her toys and ran towards her father.


Alexander picked her up and hugged her tightly. "What were you doing.my little one?" he asked, his voice gentle.

"Playing with my toys," she replied, her eyes sparkling with joy.

The nannies discreetly left the father and daughter alone in the room.sensing they needed some private time together.

"Is there something else you want to do besides playing with your toys?”Alexander inquired, a smile playing on his lips.

"Yes,”Viola nodded eagerly.

"What is it?" he asked, curious about her answer. "I want to play with Daddy," she said, her tiny hands gripping his shirt.“But don't you have work today?" she asked, her concern evident in her voice. Alexander smiled at her sweetness and thoughtfulness. "Daddy and Mommy don't have work today, so you have us both to yourself.”

She placed her little hands on his cheeks, looking into his eyes.“Really?”she asked, excitement bubbling in her voice.


"Yes," he confirmed, his heart melting at her innocence.

“Yay!”Viola cheered, clapping her hands.


Alexander couldn't help but smile at her joy. “But where is Mommy?"she asked,glancing towards the door.


"She's still sleeping," he explained, adjusting her slightly in his arms.

“Okay. I want to go shopping with Mommy when she wakes up," Viola announced with determination.


"Shopping?” Alexander echoed, surprised by her request.

She nodded enthusiastically. “Yes, Daddy. It's great-grandfather's birthday next week, and I haven't gotten him a gift yet. He'll be unhappy if I don't get him something.”


Sometimes, Alexander forgot how young his daughter was because she often acted so mature. Her awareness of such things at her age amazed him,but he loved how smart and thoughtful she was.


"My good girl," he said, stroking her hair gently. "So, what game do you want Daddy to play with you?" She thought for a moment, her eyes lighting up. "I want you to bake with me.” “But that's not a game,” he said, taken aback by her request.“Yes, but it's what I want to do," she insisted, her eyes shining with excitement.


“Baking?" Alexander was surprised. He hadn't expected that.

"Yes, Daddy. I want you to teach me how to bake. There are many things I want us to make together."


Alexander doubted his baking skills; the last time he baked was in high school for a project. But for his daughter, he was willing to try anything.

"Alright, baking it is,” he said, smiling at her.


“Yay!” Viola cheered again, hugging him tightly.

“Let's go to the kitchen then,” Alexander suggested, carrying her towards the kitchen.


As they entered the kitchen, Viola's eyes widened with excitement
###Chapter 65

Before long, the father-daughter duo had commandeered the entire kitchen for their baking session. Viola would occasionally leap up in joy as she learned something new. Recently, her school had organized a field trip to a bakery where her class saw how various cookies and pastries were made,sparking her fascination and a vow to learn how to bake.


She perched on a kitchen counter, well away from the oven and stove,as her father had insisted she keep a safe distance. She observed with keen interest as he gathered all the baking supplies they wvould need. Outside the kitchen, the chefs, some maids, and Clara peeked through a small gap in the door, watching their employer take on a role they had never imagined for him. It was a stunning sight-one of the city's most influential businessmen in an apron, ready to bake. No one would have believed it if they hadn't seen it themselves. They hadn't even expected him to marry or become a father. Seeing how he catered to the wishes of his wife and daughter showed them that even the toughest hearts could soften for loved ones.


They stayed outside, concerned that a mishap in the kitchen could lead to a fire, ready to step in if necessary. After watching several videos on how to bake cookies and a cake, Alexander began preparing.

“Daddy,"Viola's voice called out.

Alexander looked at her, smiling. He noticed her dissatisfied pout.“What is it,sweetheart?""How can I learn if all I do is sit here and watch?" she pouted again. “Oh, you're right," Alexander acknowledged, glancing at the items he had set out on the long kitchen island. "P'll move everything closer to you." He carefully relocated the ingredients and tools within her reach while ensuring she remained safe.


“I want to make cookies too," she declared.

He put an apron on her and kissed her forehead. "Alright. let's bake some cookies together," he said, grinning. He gathered all the necessary ingredients and placed themon the counter beside her. She eyed the array of ingredients with excitement. With Alexander's guidance, she started measuring flour and sugar, pouring them into a mixing bowl with precision. Alexander watched with pride as she added the ingredients,her face lighting up as the dough began to form. He handed her a bag of chocolate chips, which she eagerly sprinkled into the dough with practiced ease.


Once they finished preparing the cookies, Alexander placed them in the oven."We need to wait for them to bake. Meanwhile, let's start on the cake.”he suggested.


“Yay!" Viola jumped up, brimming with excitement.

Alexander arranged the ingredients for the cake on the counter,smiling at her eagerness. “Alright, Viola," he said, placing the recipe next to the ingredients. “Let's follow the steps carefully to make the most delicious cake."He read through the recipe with her, ensuring they understood each step. Viola nodded eagerly, her eyes fixed on the instructions. She instinctively reached for the mixing bowl, ready to dive into the baking process.Outside the kitchen, the staff continued to watch through the door,marveling at the ease with which father and daughter were baking.“At least they seem to be doing it right," one of them commented, and the others nodded in agreement. "I didn't think Mr. Kane had such skills." "What's going on here, and what skill are you talking about?" a familiar voice interrupted, causing them to jump in fright. "Ma'am!" they exclaimed in unison.

Lilly looked at them, puzzled. "Why are you all standing here peeking into the kitchen? Care to explain, Clara?"

She couldn't fathom why they were spying, including the chef. She had woken up and decided to come down for a glass of water and check on Viola when she found them like this. The aroma wafting from the kitchen had caught her attention.

“Ma'am, it's sir and Miss Viola in the kitchen baking, so we're just staying alert in case something goes wrong," Clara explained sincerely.

“Baking?”Lilly was taken aback. Alexander, baking?

They nodded.

"Let me see," Lilly said.

They stepped aside to let her through. Lilly opened the door slightly and peeked inside. There, in front of her eyes, were Alexander and Viola baking together, laughing and smiling.

Lilly was astonished, her mouth agape at the sight of her husband baking.It was a beautiful moment, seeing father and daughter bond. She turned to the staff.“Does anyone have their phone with them?"

"Yes, ma'am," Clara handed her phone to Lilly. "Turn on the camera," Lilly instructed. Clara activated the camera, and Lilly took several photos of Alexander and Viola baking from different angles. Handing the phone back, she said,“Thanks, Clara. Please send these to me later."


“Okay, ma'am,” Clara replied.

"Everyone can leave now," Lilly said.

The staff sighed in relief and dispersed after bowing their heads. Lilly fully opened the kitchen door and walked in.

"I thought I said no one should come in here," Alexander's voice, now cold,greeted her. He was adding the final touches to the cake batter when he heard the door open.


Viola turned and beamed when she saw her mother.“Mommy's awake!”She wanted to jump down to hnug her but realized she couldn't reach the floor.


Alexander looked up and smiled upon seeing Lilly.

Lilly walked over and kissed Viola. “Sweetie, you're covered in baking stuff.”

"Yes,because I'm learning to bake!" Viola exclaimed.

"How adorable," Lilly said,making her daughter smile.

“Mommy,"Viola called.

“Yes,darling?” "I want us to go shopping later." “Shopping?”Lilly asked. Viola nodded. "I need to get something for great-grandpa for his birthday next week."


“That's so thoughtful of you,sweetheart."


"So, are we going after we finish baking?" Viola asked,eyes wide with hope.


"Yes, darling, we'll go shopping after," Lilly promised.

“Yay!”Viola cheered.

"You joined us to bake?" Alexander asked.

"I came for water and saw you two baking. I had no idea you had such skills," Lilly said to Alexander.

He moved closer and kissed her lips. "I have many skills you don't know about.”


Lilly blushed.


Viola smiled as she watched her parents' affectionate moment. The family of three continued to enjoy their time together, baking happily.
###Chapter 66

one Week Later


Caleb Blake's 80th Birthday celebration, The Blake mansion bustled with activity as the staff hurriedly prepared for the evening's event. By 5 p.m.,reporters had already gathered outside the grand estate, eager to capture the arrival of the first guests for the party starting at 7 p.m. They wanted to be ahead of schedule to catch all the important arrivals.

"Isn't that Mrs. Kane's car coming?" asked a reporter from Aurora news Daily, turning to his senior colleague as a car approached the imposing gate.


"Yes, that's her vehicle," confirmed the senior reporter. Immediately,cameras were raised, and recording began.


"It's 5:20 p.m., and Lilly Kane has just arrived at the Blake residence for her grandfather's birthday celebration. We can also see her daughter,little Viola, accompanying her," narrated the cameraman as he filmed the luxury car driving through the gates.


"We'll go live again once more guests start arriving," the reporter concluded, noticing his colleagues' stunned expressions. "What's with the look?" he asked.


"You referred to her as Lilly Blake," one of them pointed out.


"Isn't that her name?" the puzzled junior reporter asked, only to be reprimanded. "How could you call her Lilly Blake! Do you understand the trouble you've just caused?" the senior reporter exclaimed. The junior reporter, now visibly worried, stammered, "But isn't she a Blake?"


"Are you an idiot? Do you not know whose wife she is? Didn't you read the brief I gave you? Being new doesn't excuse such a blunder!"

Realizing his mistake, the junior reporter pleaded, "I'm sorry, sír. I promise it won't happen again." He knew he should have referred to her as Lilly Kane or Mrs. Kane, acknowledging her marriage to Aleander Kane.


"Leave now and prepare for your dismissal. I'm certain Mr. Kane is already taking action," the senior reporter stated sternly.

Desperate, the junior reporter fell to his knees, clutching his superior's legs."Please, sir, help me. Explain to the superiors that I'm new and didn't know better. Please, sir," he begged, fearing the loss of his recently acquired job.


The senior reporter sighed. "There's nothing I can do. You could try pleading with Mr. Kane, but good luck finding another job. And just so you know, I'll face repercussions for your mistake too," he said before walking away.


The junior reporter began to sweat, understanding the immense power and influence Oliver Kane wielded over the city, even though he didn't own the news outlet.


Meanwhile, Alexander, who had watched the live report, was livid. He immediately summoned his assistant. "You called for me, sir?" James entered the office promptly. "Did you see the news?" "Yes, sir. I've already addressed it." James responded, bracing himself.

Oliver's eyes narrowed. "How did you handle it?"

"The reporter responsible will be dismissed soon,sir," James explained.

"Good," Alexander replied, his voice icy. He detested hearing his wife referred to by her maiden name, insisting she be recognized as a Kane.

"When is the last meeting scheduled?" he asked.

"At 6 p.m., sir. It will end by 7 p.m., giving you time to attend the banquet," James reported, handing over the business brief.

"Thank you. You may leave," Oliver said, glancing at the document.

James bowed and exited the room.

Back at the Blake estate, Lilly stepped out of the car, carrying her sleeping daughter. "Welcome, ma'am," greeted the head maid, Janet.

"Thank you, Miss Janet," Lilly replied with a smile, observing the hive of activity around her.

"Would you like something to eat or drink, ma'am?" Janet offered.

"No, we ate already. You can continue with your tasks. I'll join you after I settle her upstairs," Lilly said, looking at her daughter fondly.

Janet smiled, "She's adorable, even while sleeping."

Lilly nodded,"Yes,she is." Janet then excused herself to continue her work, while Lilly took Viola upstairs to her old room, which had already been prepared. She laid her daughter on the spacious bed and ensured she was comfortable before checking that all their belongings had been brought up. After confirming everything, she instructed the guards outside the room to ensure no one entered.


Making her way to her grandfather's study, she knocked and entered upon his invitation. "Happy 80th birthday, Grandpa!" she greeted warmly,hugging him.


"My dear," Caleb embraced her, patting her back.


"I have a special gift for you, Grandpa. I think you'll love it," she said,handing him a file.

Curious, Caleb opened the file to find a property deed with his name on it.He was astonished to see that his granddaughter had bought him an island,a piece of land he had long dreamt of owning to build a vacation home.This island, not found on conventional maps, had been a cherished wish since he first saw it while visiting an old friend in the mountains.


"How did you manage this?" he asked, amazed.

Lilly explained, "It's unclaímed land. To purchase it, I had it registered as a government property under the relevant country. Afterward, I acquired it.11


Caleb beamed with pride. "Why didn't I think of that?"


"I'm glad you like it," Lilly said, smiling. "This is the best birthday present ever, thanks to my precious granddaughter," Caleb declared, pulling her into a hug. "I'm so proud of you." With tears in her eyes, Lilly replied, "I'm happy you love it, Grandpa."

"Where's my great-granddaughter?" Caleb inquired. looking around.

"She's napping. I'll bring her to you when she wakes up. Meanwhile, you should rest before the banquet," Lilly suggested.

"Alright," Caleb agreed.

"I'll supervise the staff to ensure everything is ready," Lilly said before leaving the study.


As Calebgazed at the deed, a bittersweet smile crossed his face.He was overjoyed with the gift but saddened by the absence of his late granddaughters.Their loss still weighed heavily on him. It was this sorrow,coupled with a desire to ease his granddaughter's buardens,that led him to reconcile with his estranged son. He wanted to ensure that Lilly had support, knowing he wouldn't always be there.

It was time for Peter to return.

###Chapter 67

The Blake estate was an architectural marvel, a testament to the family's wealth and influence. It sprawled over acres of manicured lawns and gardens, is buildings echoing a grandeur that had been maintained through generations. The family temple, nestled in the heart of the estate,was a sanctuary of peace and reflection, often used for private family gatherings. În contrast, the grand reception hall, situated near the mansion.was the hub of activity for the evening's celebrations. Its opulent design,with high ceilings adorned with chandeliers and marble floors gleaming under the soft glow of hundreds of lights, was a sight to behold.

As the clock ticked past 6:30 p.m., the first guests began to arrive, their vehicles lining up the cobblestone driveway. Chauffeurs opened doors for elegantly dressed attendees, who stepped out with an air of sophistication and grace. The air buzzed with excitement and anticipation. The elite of society mingled, exchanging pleasantries and warm smiles as they made their way into the hall. Among the guests were members of the esteemed White family, whose military lineage was well-respected across the nation.Other notable individuals included politicians, business tycoons,and philanthropists, all gathered to honor the legacy of Caleb Blake. The media presence was substantial. Reporters and photographers from various outlets hovered near the entrance, capturing every moment.Cameras flashed as esteemed actors and artists arrived, each one stopping briefly to pose and answer questions. The journalists, eager to capture soundbites and statements, thrust microphones toward the celebrities,asking about their relationship with the Blake family and their thoughts on Caleb's remarkable milestone.Inside the hall, the atmosphere was vibrant and celebratory. Lilly, Caleb's granddaughter, stood near the entrance, her eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. When she spotted Sophia and Richard, a genuine smile spread across her face. She moved gracefully through the crowd, her lavender gown flowing around her like a gentle breeze. "Glad you could make it," Lilly said warmly,embracing Sophia and Richard as they reached her.


"We wouldn't miss your grandfather's birthday for the world," Sophia replied with a heartfelt smile. Her eyes twinkled with the genuine affection she held for the Blake family. Beside her, Richard nodded in agreement.

"Indeed. despite any issues between Alexander and me, this is an event we had to attend." Richard added, his voice carrying a note of sincerity. His relationship with Alexander, Lilly's husband, had been strained, but tonight was about family and unity.

Lilly's smile deepened, gratitude evident in her expression. "Thank you for coming and setting aside your differences with Alexander," she said,wrapping her arms around Richard for another hug. The gesture was a testament to the bonds that held them all together, despite any past grievances.

At that moment, Little Viola, Lilly's daughter, dashed across the room, her white princess dress shimmering under the lights. "Uncle Richard, Aunt Sophia!" she squealed, launching herself into Richard's arms.

"Viola," Richard laughed, lifting her up effortlessly. He twirled her around,eliciting a giggle of delight. "Did you miss me?" She nodded enthusiastically, her small hand reaching out to touch a faint bruise on his face. "What happened?" she asked with childlike curiosity. "Uncle was being careless," Richard replied, brushing off the question with a smile. It was a simple explanation meant to shield her from the complexities of adult life.

Sophia and Lilly exchanged knowing glances, the real reason for Richard's injury unspoken between them. They both understood the need to protect Viola from unnecessary worries.


The little girl, however, had her own opinions. "Then stop being careless,"she admonished him with a stern look, mimicking the tone of a concerned parent.


Richard chuckled, nodding in agreement. "I promise," he said, his tone playful yet sincere.


Satisfied with his response, liy turned her attention to Sophia, wrapping her arms around her. Lilly then asked Sophia, "Where's Theo?"her eyes wide with curiosity, referring to Sophia and Richard's young son.

"He's at home with his grandmother," Sophia explained gently, smoothing down Lilly's hair with a tender touch.

Viola's face fell, disappointment evident in her pout. "Why didn't you bring him?"


Sophia smiled, exchanging a glance with Lilly. "He's too young for such a large gathering," she said softly. "He'd cry all night with so many people around."


Understanding dawned on Viola's face, and her disappointment melted away. "Okay," she said brightly. "Can I have cookies?"

"Of course," Richard replied with a grin, carrying her toward a table laden with an array of delectable treats. Cookies, cakes, and pastries were artfully arranged,tempting anyone who glanced their way. As Richard and Viola explored the table, Sophia and Lilly continued their conversation. The bond between them was strong, forged through years of friendship and shared experiences. "Is Alexander here yet?" Sophia inquired, her gaze scanning the crowd for any sign of Lilly's husband.

"Not yet, but he'll be here soon," Lilly assured her, glancing at her watch.


"You look stunning in that dress, Lilly," Sophia complimented,admiring the elegance of her lavender gown.


Lilly blushed, smoothing down the fabric. "Thank you. Your dress is beautiful too," she replied sincerely.

Sophia,ever the playful one, made an exaggerated bow, prompting a laugh from Lilly. Sophia wore a form-fitting navy blue gown that hugged her figure perfectly, while little Viola sparkled in her white princess dress adorned with sequins,looking every bit the young royalty.

"Where's your grandfather? I'd love to give him my gift," Sophia said,glancing around the room.

"He's over there," Lilly pointed, leading Sophia through the throng of guests to where Caleb was engaged in conversation with his friends.including Wilson White, a figure of notable prestige.

"Grandfather," Lilly called out as they approached.

Caleb and Wilson turned their attention toward the two women. Caleb's face broke into a warm smile as he saw his granddaughter."Come over here," Caleb beckoned, his voice filled with affection. Lilly greeted Wilson with a respectful nod. "Hello, Master Wilson." Wilson smiled back, recalling the initial misjudgment he had made about Lilly, unaware of her connection to Caleb at the time. "How are you?" he asked kindly.


"I'm well, thank you," Lilly replied, her smile genuine.

"Good to hear. Let's start anew," Wilson suggested, offering a handshake to symbolize a fresh beginning.

"Yes, Master Wilson," Lilly agreed,pleased with his gesture.

Turning her attention back to her grandfather, Lilly introduced Sophia."Grandfather, Sophia Jonnson is here to wish you a happy birthday."

Caleb recognized Sophia immediately. She was the daughter of the former governor and now married toRichard Jonnson, a prominent figure in the medical field. Her presence at the celebration was both an honor and a delight. "Hello. Master Caleb. Happy 80th birthday," Sophia greeted warmly,extending her hand.

Caleb shook her hand with a smile. "Thank you, Sophia. How's your father? I haven't spoken to him since his retirement."

"He's well, and I'll pass on your regards," Sophia replied,pleased to reconnect old acquaintances.

With a gesture of sincerity, she handed Caleb a small gift box. Caleb,intrigued,asked Victor, one of his trusted aides, to take it and open it. As Victor lifted the lid, the contents were revealed: an emerald ring, glistening and pristine. ′′Ilost this ring in an auction. How did you get it?" Caleb asked.astonishment coloring his voice. 11Itappeared in another auction, so I bought it for you." Sophia explained simply, a smile on her lips.


Caleb, touched by the thoughtfulness of the gift, remarked, "It must have been expensive."


Sophia shook her head lightly. "Doesn't matter. Happy birthday," shesaid with genuine warmth.


Caleb beamed, appreciating both the gesture and the gift. "It's a beautiful gift. Thank you, Sophia."

As Lilly gently led Sophia away from the gathering, she assured her grandfather, "We'll be back soon, Grandpa." However, as they turned to leave, a familiar voice interrupted them,freezing Lilly in her tracks.

"Lilly?"

The voice belonged to Peter, her father. Lilly turned slowly, her eyes wide with disbelief. It had been three long years since she had last seen him.since he had left her behind. "Father?" she whispered, the word carrying a mix of shock and emotion.
###Chapter 68

Peter approached Lilly with a smile, enveloping her in a warm hug. "I've missed you so much, my child," he said, his voice thick with emotion. Lilly had thought she would be angry when she saw him again, maybe even lash out at him for abandoning her instead of seeking forgiveness. But here she was, feeling nothing but happiness at his return.


She wrapped her arms around him, holding him tightly. "Father," she said.her voice trembling with emotion.


Caleb watched the scene with a satisfied smile. He had orchestrated his son s return, ensuring that Peter would be there for this momentous occasion.


Around them, guests at the banquet paused to observe the father-daughter reunion. Those who knew the backstory began to whisper among themselves.


"It looks like the old master has asked his son to come back."

"Yes, that's how it appears."

"Do you think she'll forgive him?"


"Judging by the look of things, she might."

Meanwhile, little Viola, who had been enjoying her cookies, stopped eating when she noticed tears in her mother's eyes. Confused by the man standing with her mother, she assumed he was the reason for her tears.She looked up at her uncle Richard, seeking answers. "Put me down, Uncle Richard." "Why? Where are you going?" "To see Mommy," she said, pointing towards her mother.

Richard followed her gaze and was surprised to see Lilly's father. "He's back."


Viola, still curious, asked, "Uncle, do you know that man?"

"Yes, Viola, he's your grandfather."

Her brow furrowed in confusion. "Grandfather?"

Richard nodded."Yes."

"Why is he making Mommy cry?"

"I think those are tears of joy."

"Hmmm," she said thoughtfully.

"Do you want to go meet him?"

She nodded.


Richard stood up from their seat and walked towards Lilly. He gently placed Viola on the ground, and she walked over to the man and her mother.


"Mommy, who is this?" she asked, pointing at Peter, who looked down at her with a wide smile, clearly filled with pain from missing her early years.


Though Uncle Richard had already told her who he was,she still wanted her mother to confirm it. Lilly picked her up, holding her close. ′′Tlhis is your grandfather, Mommy's father." Little Viola blinked, trying to process the new information. She had always known about her great-grandfather, but she hadn't realized she also had a grandfather.

Peter smiled at her warmly. "Do you want me to carry you?" he asked gently.


Viola nodded, and Peter lifted her into his arms. "You're so big already and so adorable. Grandfather regrets not being here when you were born,"he said, his voice tinged with sadness.

Lilly smiled sadly, recalling how her father had been disowned by her grandfather, forcing him to leave. Now that he was back, it meant her grandfather had accepted him again. Lilly glanced towards Caleb,who smiled and nodded encouragingly.

Seeing her father and Viola getting along, she decided to step away and use the opportunity to call Alexander, who had not yet arrived.

"Are you ready to forgive him?" Richard asked as she approached.

"I think so. I didn't realize how much I missed him until now," she admitted.

Richard smiled. "It's good you are. You need him."

"I do," she agreed.

"I'll go meet Sophia. You should call Alexander," Richard said,walking away. Lilly went to the spacious balcony near the pool to call Alexander. The calm and quiet atmosphere, coupled with the fresh air, provided a serene backdrop. She closed her eyes, taking deep breaths,feeling grateful that her father was back. She took out her phone to call Alexander.

"Looking for me?" came Alexander's voice. He had just entered the banquet hall and scanned for her, paying no heed to the now-silent hall.

Lilly turned and smiled, running to hug him. "Alexander," she said, her arms wrapped around him.


Alexander looked at her face. "Did you cry?"

She nodded.

Alexander frowned. "Why?"

"I'm just being emotional. I'm actually happy that my father is back."

"Your father is back?"


She nodded. "Yes, and I didn't know I would miss him this much."

"Are you glad he is back?"

She nodded again. "Yes."

"Are you ready to forgive him?"

"Yes, I am."


Alexander wiped her tears and kissed her forehead. "Don't ruin your makeup. It looks good on you."

She laughed and nodded. "Where is Viola?""She's with my father. They're already getting along," Lilly said with a smile.

Alexander nodded. "I don't even know if your grandma and Sandra are here yet."


"They are. They arrived at the same time as I did."

"Okay," she said, relaxing her head on his chest.


Alexander wrapped his arm around her. "The view here is nice. Doyou want to stay longer before they start serving meals?"

"We should go inside. Don't you plan on giving your grandfather his gift?"

"No."


"Why?" Lilly raised her head to look at him.

"Because his gift hasn't arrived yet. It will come in a few weeks."

"What is it?"

"I can't tell you yet, but it's something he'll like," Alexander smiled.


Lilly gazed at him suspiciously. "Okay, if you say so. We should go inside now."


Alexander held her hand, and they both wvent inside. The banquet continued with everyone eating, drinking, and dancing. The air was filled with laughter and music as the guests celebrated the joyous occasion. The clinking of glasses and the harmonious tunes of the orchestra added to the festive atmosphere. Not far from the Blake estate,an old car was parked by the road. A woman in a nose mask and hoodie sat inside, watching the banquet live on her cell phone. She had an inside man secretly filming the event.

She frowned as she saw Lilly dancing happily with Alexander and their daughter. Her eyes narrowed, and her grip on the phone tightened,revealing the bitterness she held within. "Let's see how long this happy family will last," she said, clenching her fist, her voice barely a whisper but filled with malice.


The celebration continued inside, oblivious to the ominous presence lurking outside. The guests enjoyed themselves, indulging in the exquisite dishesserved by the renowned chefs hired for the occasion. Caleb,the patriarch of the family, moved from table to table, engaging with his friends and family, his heart full of joy at having his family reunited.

Peter, still holding Viola, approached Caleb with Lilly by his side. The three generations together was a sight that warmed many hearts in the room. Caleb's eyes shone with unshed tears as he looked at his son and granddaughter. "It's good to have you back, Peter," he said, his voice choked with emotion.


"It's good to be back, Father," Peter replied, his voice steady but filled with gratitude.


Viola,perched on her grandfather's shoulder, looked between the two men.sensing the weight of their words. She didn't fully understand the complexities of their past, but she felt the love and reconciliation in the air. As the night wore on, Lilly and Alexander moved to the dance floor,swaying gently to the soft melody. Viola, now with Richard and Sophia,watched them with a smile. Her small heart was content, surrounded by family and love. "Look at them," Sophia said, nodding towards Lilly and Alexander. "They're perfect together."

Richard agreed, his arm around Sophia. "They deserve this happiness."


Meanwhile, Peter stood with Caleb, both men observing the scene with pride. "Thank you for bringing me back," Peter said, his voice filled with gratitude.


Caleb placed a hand on his shoulder. "We all make mistakes, son. It's how we make amends that matters."


Peter nodded. his eyes on Lilly, who laughed as Alexander spun her around. "I won't leave again. I promise."

Caleb smiled, squeezing his son's shoulder. "I know you won't."

The night continued with laughter and joy, each moment building on the last, creating memories that would last a lifetime. As the clock struck midnight, the guests gathered around Caleb, raising their glasses in a toast to the man who had brought them all together.

"To Caleb," Alexander said, his voice carrying over the crowd. "A man who has taught us the true meaning of family."

"To Caleb!" the guests echoed, their voices mingling with the music and laughter.

Not far from the Blake estate, an old car was parked by the road.A woman in a nose mask and hoodie sat inside, watching the banquet live on her cell phone. She had an inside man secretly filming the event. She frowned as she saw Lilly dancing happily with Alexander and their daughter."Let's see how long this happy family will last," she said,clenching her fist.
###Chapter 69

"Papa?"

"Yes,darling?"

"You once told me grandpa had passed away."

Alexander moved his attention from his tablet to her. "Yes, do you want to visit his resting place?"


"I would love that."

"Alright, we will go there when we visit the family estate.For now,you need to finish your breakfast so you won't be late for school."

"Okay." Viola looked down at her cereal. She was sitting at her small table having breakfast while her father sat at the main dining table with his coffee. She picked up her spoon and began to toy with her food.


"What's wrong, darling? You don't like the cereal?" Alexander asked,noticing her hesitation.


"I like it."

"Then why aren't you eating?"

"Because I wanted to ask you something."

Alexander put down his tablet and gave her his full attention. "What do you want to ask, sweetheart?" "What about grandma, your mother?" She blinked up at him with wide eyes. Alexander paused, pondering the best way to answer. "She's far away."

"Far away?"

"Yes,Viola."

"Where? Is she dead?"


"No." As much as he wanted to say she was dead to him, he couldn't say that to his daughter, knowing she would then ask to visit a grave that didn't exist.


"Where is she. Papa? I want to meet her."

Alexander's expression darkened.


Seeing the frown on her father's face, little Viola wondered if she had done something wrong.


"You can't meet her because she is far away in a place she can't return from."


"Why can't she come back? Doesn't she want to meet me,her granddaughter? Doesn't she want to come back to her family,to you,just like Mommy's father did?" she asked,full of curiosity.


Her persistent questioning irritated Alexander. Sincethe party, Viola had been asking many family-related questions. He had anticipated her asking about her grandmother but hadn't expected her to be so relentless.

"Viola," he called sternly. Viola pouted, tears welling up in her eyes. Her father had used her full name harshly, indicating sh e was about to be reprimanded. "Eat your food. You'll be late for school."

Now he understood why she had wanted her mother to leave for work without her and why she wanted to have breakfast with him and have him take her to school. She had planned to ask these questions. How clever.


"But.Papa..."

"Quiet," he cautioned.

Unable to hold back any longer, she started crying, tears streaming down her face.


Alexander sighed, feeling a pang of guilt for making his daughter cry.He stood up, walked over to her, and lifted her from her chair, allowing her to rest her head on his chest. He gently rubbed her back.

"Stop crying. Papa is sorry for raising his voice."

She sniffled, blinking away her tears.

Alexander wiped her tears with his hand. "How old are you again?"

Viola was surprised by the question but answered anyway. "I will be three soon," she said with a smile,remembering her upcoming birthday.

"Mmm," Alexander murmured. Sometimes she acted so mature, and other times she was the little child she really was, Reflecting on the gift she had given her great-grandfather,Alexander and others had been astonished that she had chosen a special ink pen crafted by a renowned pen master. He had initially thought Lilly had suggested it, but his daughter had selected it on her own. Now she was crying like the child she was, reminding him of her age.

"Papa?"

"Mmm?"

"Did you forget how old I am?" She wondered why her father would ask her age.

"I didn't."

"Then why ask?"

"Because sometimes you act like an adult, and other times you behave like the child you are,like now."


Viola smiled. "Because my IQ is high."。

Alexander chuckled. "Your IQ?"

She nodded.

Clara smiled as she watched the father and daughter bonding.

Meanwhile, at the Blake Group headquarters, Lilly was in her office on the 11th floor. At home, she was a wife and mother, but at work, she was a strict boss. Sitting in her executive chair with arms crossed, she looked at her assistant, Karina, and the team leader of the project planning department. "What did you say the name of the company was again?" she asked Aden,the team leader. "The nameis BSC Company. It's an international firm, and they want to partner with us." Lilly had arrived at the office that morning to find out about a company her grandfather had approved for a partnership without her consent. The project file, meticulously prepared, had only required her signature. She wondered why her grandfather had approved working with the company without consulting her, the president. She had immediately asked her assistant to investigate the company and its owner.

"Did you find out who owns the company, Karina?" Lilly turned to her assistant. who was staring at her tablet in shock.

"What is it?" Lilly asked, noting the astonished look on Karina's face.

"Ma'am,it's..."

"Who? Is it someone I know?"

"Yes,ma'am."

"Hand me the tablet, let me see."

Karina walked over and handed her the tablet.

Lilly took it and saw her father's image on the screen. "What's this? Why
is my father's photo here?"

"He is the CEO of BSC."

Her father was the CEO of BSC? She was stunned.
###Chapter 70

She had spoken to her grandfather the day before, and although he had returned to the office, he hadn't mentioned that he was the head of BSC and intended for them to collaborate. Was this his way of mending their relationship by withholding information? Her grandfather, however, didn't see the need to share this with her. She slowly scrolled through the tablet,reading about his role as chairman of BSC, a company dealing with construction. According to the information, he had founded the company from scratch in France three months after leaving their home country. She continued reading, taking in all the details.

Lilly handed the tablet back to Karina, who stood nearby.

"What will you do now, ma'am?" Karina asked.


"Arrange a meeting with them for tomorrow," Lilly replied.

"Okay, I'll do that right away. Anything else you need?"


"Reschedule my last meeting to 5 PM. I have dinner plans with friends who just returned to the country."

"Got it. I'll take care of it."

Lilly turned to Adam. "Review their project proposal and note any changes we might request during tomorrow's meeting."

"Understood," Adam said before leaving the office.Both Karina and Adam could sense their boss's displeasure with the news she had received. After attending her final meeting of the day, Lilly returned to her office to prepare for her dinner date with Michael and Jacob, who had just returned to the country. As she gathered her belongings, she received a calI from her father but chose to ignore it. not ready to speak with him until their meeting.


Was she upset that he owned a new company and wanted to collaborate?No,what angered her was his decision to keep his intentions from her.opting for secrecy. If he wanted to keep things professional, so would she.

After giving Karina her final instructions, Lilly took the elevator down to the underground garage, where Pedro and Roland were waiting for her in the car. For three years, they had been her bodyguards. Despite Alexander's suggestion to replace them. Lilly insisted on keeping them, having grown accustomed to their presence.


"Good day, ma'am," they greeted in unison.

"Good day, Pedro and Roland," she replied with a smile.

"Where to next,ma'am?" Pedro asked.

"I have a dinner date with Michael and Jacob," Lilly informed them,knowing they were familiar with her friends. She gave them the location.and soon they were on their way.

Halfway to the restaurant, her phone rang, Seeing Alexander's name on the screen,she smiled and answered the call.

"Alexander." "Where are you going?" was his immediate question. Lilly glanced at Pedro and Roland in the front seats. Clearly, someone had informed Alexander of her movements, but it wasn't them. "You left the office. Where are you headed?" he pressed.

So he had people watching her again. He always did this for safety reasons.
The last time was when she was newly appointed as the president of the Blake Group, but she had made him stop. Now he was doing it again.

"Are you monitoring me again? Why?" she finally asked. Was something happening that she didn't know about? He usually did this when he felt she was in danger.


The line was silent, and all she could hear was his sigh.

"Alexander," she called. "Is something wrong?"

"No,nothing is wrong."

"Is Viola with you at the office?"

Alexander looked at Viola, sleeping in his resting room. "Yes, she's sleeping. She must be exhausted from her day at school."

"Okay."

"You still haven't told me where you're going," he said more seriously.

"Michael and Jacob are back, so I have a dinner date with them," she said excitedly, happy to see her friends after a year apart.

He was silent again.

"Alexander, are you still there?" "Mmm," was his only response. Alexander still didn't like Jacob and Michael because they were men. He had once said he should be the only man she was close to, both as a husband and a friend.


"You don't like it, do you?”


"Are you really asking that? You know I don't," Alexander replied.

Lilly bit her bottom lip. "They're like family. Why can't you see it that way?"


"I can't."

"Stop being jealous."

"I can't help it."

Lilly smiled. "You love that I do, don't you?"

"Well, a little," she admitted.

She heard him chuckle.

"Don't stay out too long. Be home by 7 PM."

Lilly looked at her watch. It was already 6 PM. How did he expect her to be home by 7 PM? Was she supposed to spend only ten minutes with Michael and Jacob?


"But 7 PM is too early. It's already 6 PM, and I haven't even reached our meeting place." "Fine, get home by 8 PM," he conceded before hanging up. "You wish," she murmured. She planned to stay out until 9 PM since it had been so long since she last saw them. Upon arriving at the luxury restaurant, she was immediately directed to the reserved floor. She felt as if someone had followed her as she entered the hotel.


Taking the elevator to the third floor, she walked into the restaurant and quickly located the reservedtable. She kept her eyes on the entrance to see if anyone followed her, but no one did. She was certain someone had trailed her.


Deciding to focus on her evening, Lilly ordered a glass of water while she waited. Ten minutes later, Michael and Jacob walked in,and she rushed to greet them.


Unable to contain her excitement, she hugged them both tightly. Socialites who recognized her began taking photos, particularly of her embrace with Michael. Unbeknownst to her, the images quickly spread online.
###Chapter 71

"I really missed you guys," Lilly said as they sat at their reserved table.

"I missed you too. I rushed back because I missed Viola as well. Has she been asking about me?" Michael asked.

"I told her you two were coming today, and she was thrilled."

"I can't wait to see her," Michael said.

"Her birthday is coming up soon, right?" Jacob asked.

"Yes, she will be three next month."

"I need to think about what to get her for her birthday," Michael said.

"Me too," Jacob added.

"She's growing up so fast, isn't she?"

"Way too fast. I wish she would just act her age because sometimes she behaves like an adult," Lilly sighed.

Jacob and Michael both smiled. "She's very smart. I wish I had a child like that,"Jacob admitted.


"You can, if you get a girlfriend and settle down," Lilly teased.
 
Michael laughed at the horrified look on Jacob's face. "You should do the same, Michael," Lilly said. "I'll pass." "Me too," Jacob added. Lilly couldn't believe her ears. "Are you both planning to stay single forever?"


Michael and Jacob exchanged a look.

"What's that look?" Lilly asked, noticing their silent communication.

"We're planning to start a tech company together. There will be so much work that we won't have time to look for girlfriends," Michael explained.

"Really? That sounds like a great business. I can't wait to be your first business partner. Cheers to a successful venture!"


They raised their glasses and made a toast.

After taking a sip, Lilly set her glass down. "But still, you both should give it a try. You can go on blind dates." She wanted them to settle down since they weren't getting any younger.

Both men shook their heads. "Not now."

"We'll let things happen naturally," Jacob said.

Lily pouted. "But I want to be a godmother or an aunt."

"You'll have to wait a while," Jacob replied.

She sighed. "I really miss Sarah. If she were here, she would help me convince you both."


"Nothing would change," Jacob said."We'll see about that. Once I tell her, she'll start matchmaking for both of you." "Oh no,please don't" Michael pleaded, knowing Sarah's capabilities.


"Please don't," Jacob shook his head.


"I thought you said it wouldn't change anything."

"I was wrong. You don't need to talk to her."

Lilly smiled: "I won't if you say so."

"When was the last time yousaw her?"


"She visited three months ago, and I haven't seen her since. I really miss her." Sarah had moved to G City six months ago for a job opportunity she loved.


"Have you thought about visiting her? Jacob and I are heading to G City in a few days. We can see her then.Do you want to come?"

"As much as I'd love to, I can't. I'm a wife, a mother, and I run a company.These three things need me here."


"We'Il send your regards."


Their meals arrived, and they continued chatting and laughing.


Her phone rang, and when she saw who was calling, she ignored it and kept talkíng. Her father must have heard about the meeting anad wanted to explain himself. Too late. The phone rang again, catching Michael and Jacob's attention. "You should answer that," Michael suggested. Lilly looked at her ringing phone and decided it was best to pick it up, but not there, "Excuse me, I'll be back." She walked out of the restaurant and headed to the restroom to take the call.Someone at a distant table immediately stood up and followed her.

In the restroom, Lilly answered the call and waited for him to speak.

"Lilly," Peter said, but she remnained silent. He had just learned about the meeting and was surprised.


"Why did you call?" Her tone saddened him. It felt like they were back to square one. If he had known, he would have told her first before his father.He just wanted his grandfather's approval first.


"My assistant just informed me about tomorrow's meeting. I was really surprised. I didn't think Father would approve the project."

"You didn't know when you presented it to him?"


Peter sighed. "I was going to tell you tomorrow evening when we have dinner at the family house. Unfortunately,you already know."


"I'm busy right now. We'll see each other at the meeting tomorrow.Goodbye." She hung up before he could respond.

As she washed her hands, she heard the restroom door open and close.She looked towards the entrance and saw a middle-aged woman standing by the door. The woman, with blonde hair and wearing a black hoodie,looked like she came from the streets. Lilly found her suspicious since she was just standing there staring. She dried her hands and picked up her bag to leave but the woman blocked her way. "Excuse me, you're in my way." "I know," the woman replied.

Lilly raised an eyebrow and gripped her bag tighter,reaching for her phone.


"No need to do that. I'm not here to harm you. I have a message from Angela Kane."


"Angela Kane?" Lilly asked in surprise, referring to Alexander's mother.

"Yes, Alexander's mother. I was released from prison last week, and before I left. she asked me to meet you. So I came to Aurora City immediately after my release."


"Alexander's mother is in prison?"

"Yes, and her son is the one keeping her there."
###Chapter 72

Lily was taken aback by the news that Alexander was keeping his mother in prison. She scrutinized the woman before her, unsure whether to believe her claims about Angela being incarcerated. Although no one, including Alexander, had ever mentioned his mother's whereabouts, she never imagined prison would be where she was.

"How do I know you're telling the truth?" Lily questioned.

"It's Amanda," the woman replied.

"Alright. Amanda, how do I know you're not lying or have some other motive?" Lily pressed.

"Why would I travel all the way from G City to Aurora City just to tell a lie instead of being with my family?" Amanda said seriously.

Lily examined her closely, seeing sincerity in her eyes. "You mentioned you came from G City. Were you imprisoned there?"

"Yes, that's where Angela is too," Amanda confirmed.

Lily nodded. "What do you mean by Alexander keeping her in prison?"

Amanda pulled a piece of paper from her pocket and handed it to Lily. "It's a letter she asked me to give you. She couldn't write it herself because she's under constant surveillance. While others in prison have some freedoms, she is only allowed to labor, eat, sleep, and read about her son in newspapers and magazines. Alexander ensures she can't call,be visited,or send letters."

Lily looked at the paper. "So you wrote this after getting out?" Amanda nodded. "Yes, but these are her words to you." Lily opened the letter and read:


"HELLO,LILY. I'M ANGELA, ALEXANDER'S MOTHER. I WOULD LOVE TO MEET WITH YOU."


Lily checked both sides but found nothing else written. "That's it?"

"Yes."

"She wants us to meet?"

"Yes."

"But you said no one can visit her."

"You'll go in as a prison warden. In about five days, new wardens will be added in the women's prison in G City, and you'll be one of them to see her."


"Did she tell you why she wanted to meet?"

"I was closeto her in prison, so yes, she told me why and everything that happened. She helped me when I first arrived, and we becamne close.Her sentence was 15 years, and she should have been released three years ago,but Alexander ensured she stayed."

"Alexander did that?" Lily was shocked. She knew how ruthless her husband could be but didn't realize he was this heartless. "Yes,we all witnessed it. She was ready to leave one Friday morning,said her goodbyes, but then learned her sentence had been extended. She was devastated. Angela talked about her son constantly and wished for him to find a good woman and start a family. She regretted her past actions every single day. I wish her son could give her a break; she has paid for her crimes."


Lily listened, seeing the pain and sadness in Amanda's eyes as she spoke.She couldn't believe what she was hearing.


"So please, see her. She doesn't know how long she'll be in prison, but she wants to meet her daughter-in-law, the woman Alexander loves," Amanda said with a smile. "She was thrilled when she found out you got married and even happier when you had Viola."

Amanda continued, "She warned me to be careful and make sure Alexander doesn't find out about this meeting because he's very protective of you. From the moment I followed your car, I saw people watching you.Even here, in this restaurant, you're being watched. I used to do such work,so I can tell when someone is being observed. I'm sure they'll come knocking on this door soon."

As if on cue, there was a knock on the door. Lily looked at it in surprise,then back at Amanda.

"I told you, they're here because you've been in here a long time," Amanda said.

"Who is it?" Lily called out.

"It's me, ma'am," Pedro replied. He was supposed to be downstairs,so how did he know she was in the restroom? This confirmed what Amanda said. "Aren't you supposed to be on the ground floor?" "I came up a few minutes ago to ask when we're leaving and was told you were here. The boss informed us to take you home; it's already 8 PM." Lily checked her watch. It was indeed 8. "I'll be out soon."

"Okay,ma'am. I'll wait in the car."

"How will I get in touch with you?" Lily asked.

"We can't call, but my email is Amanda... Our email conversations will be anonymous. I need to leave now."

"It's best I go first." Lily suggested.

"Yes, that's true."

Lily opened the door and walked out of the restroom. She returned to the restaurant to inform MichaeI and Jacob she was leaving.

"You took so long that we finished our meals, and yours is cold," Jacob remarked.

"Seems the conversation was lengthy," Michael noted.

"Yes, it was," she replied, sitting down and taking a sip of water.

"Do you want me to ask them to warm your food?" Jacob asked.

"No,I have to leave now."

"Why the sudden departure?"

"It's already 8 PM; it's getting late."

"Are you okay, Lily?" Michael asked, noticing her mood had shifted. "I'm fine," she smiled. "Okay then, we'll talk on the phone or visit you at work tomorrow." "Alright, I'll leave now," Lily said. grabbing her handbag and leaving the restaurant.


Michael watched her go,feeling something was off. She had spent a lot of time in the restroom.
###Chapter 73

On her journey home, Lily pondered everything Amanda had revealed.She was certain that Alexander had strictly forbidden anyone from discussing his mother's whereabouts, which is why she had remained in the dark until now. Although Lily occasionally uncovered new aspects of her husband, her feelings for him remained unchanged. What puzzled her now was the reason behind Angela's imprisonment, her fifteen-year sentence, and why Alexander still wanted to keep her confined.

Lily recalled Grandma Helen once mentioning that Angela had been responsible for her son's death, causing a car accident that took his life.But Lily doubted that this was the full story behind Angela's incarceration.Should she confront Alexander about it? He always grew furious whenever she brought up the subject of his mother. Should she ask Ethan or Richard? Doing so would likely anger Alexander even more. Should she make the trip to G city to meet Angela? Was it safe to do so? Lily wrestled with these questions, feeling more confused than ever. A part of her urged her to speak with Alexander first; perhaps going to the prison might be a mistake.


What if this was some kind of trap? she wondered. Alexander wouldn't act without reason, would he? If he was keeping Angela in prison, there had to be a rationale. If there wasn't, then he was harboring deep resentment and refusing to give his mother a second chance. Lily sighed deeply,glancing out the window, surprised to find they were already home, the car parked in front of their mansion. How long had she been lost in thought? Her bodyguards hadn't even mentioned they had arrived.Turning to the front seat, she asked, "Why didn't you tell me we were here?"

"We tried calling you twice, but you didn't respond, ma'am, so we decided to wait," Samuel explained.

Lily ran her hand through her hair, then opened the car door and stepped out. She was greeted by the sight of Alexander and Viola standing at the entrance,watching her. The look on Alexander's face was not one she wanted to deal with, so she focused on her daughter, smiling broadly.

Viola beamed and ran towards her. "Mommy, you're home!”

"Yes, my love," Lily replied, picking her up and hugging her tightly.“I missed my little kitty so much."

"I missed you too,Mommy.”

Lily kissed Viola on the forehead."What did you do after school today?"she asked as they headed into the house, completely ignoring Alexander.

Alexander stood there, watching Lily pass him without a word, which took him by surprise and deepened his frown. After waiting outside for her,even watching her sit in the car without coming out, she had ignored him-why?

“Did anything happen today that I wasn't told about?" Alexander asked the bodyguards, but they shook their heads.

"No,sir,we reported everything that occurred," one responded. “You said she spent a long time in the restroom. Was anyone with her?" Samuel thought for a moment and shook his head. "No, sir.”"You'd better be sure because if I find out something different happened, you're as good as dead," Alexander warned, his tone deadly serious,causing the men to shiver.


Later that night, after Lily had read a bedtime story to Viola and put her to sleep, she returned to the bedroom and found Alexander sitting on the bed, watching her as she enatered. She walked over and sat beside him.

Alexander wrapped his arm around her waist and pulled her close."Mind telling me why I was ignored earlier? You owe me a greeting, a kiss, and a hug,"he said, sounding like a child who had been overlooked.

Lily put her arms around his neck and kissed him. “How was work today?



"Why did you ignore me?" he asked, this time more seriously. It was the first time she had ever done that, and he needed to know what prompted it.


“Because I'm upset with you," she replied with the same seriousness,making him raise an eyebrow.

“For what?”

"You made me come home early. I didn't even get to enjoy dinner with Michael and Jacob. It's been ages since I hung out with them,you know,"she pouted.


Alexander frowned, not because of the excuse she gave but because her mood had shifted from serious to playful. Was she hiding her true feelings?The thought deepened his frown. She might be angry, as she said, but the reason she provided wasn't the real cause.

“You know I'll find out anyway, right? So you'd better tell me now."
Lily was silent for a moment before speaking. "Viola mentioned earlier that she asked you about your mother, butyou got upset..."

"Stop changing the subject, Lily."

“What makes you think I'm changing the subject?"

"What does your ignoring me earlier have to do with Viola asking about that woman?"


"That woman is your mother," Lily said, noting how he always referred to her.


“Enough," he said, his voice rising in anger.

Lily frowned, pushing his hand away from her waist as she stood up."You got angry at Viola because she asked about her grandmother.What did you expect, that she wouldn't ask?”


Alexander couldn't understand why the conversation had shifted to his mother.“Why are we talking about her now?”


“I'm giving you a clue as to why I ignored you earlier. We've been married for three years, Alexander-three years-and you still haven't told me anything about your mother, about what happened, or where she is.Where is she, Alexander? Talk to me, I'm begging you," she pleaded.

She wanted him to tell her himself, to stop her from going to the prison behind his back. "Don't make me do things behind your back," she thought, waiting for him to respond. After a long silence, with them staring at each other, he finally spoke.“ Who did you talk to today?"

"Who did I speak to today? Alexander, this has been on my mind for a long time. I want to know; I'm just as curious as Viola is. You've forbidden anyone from talking about her. No one is telling me anything.Why don't you want to talk about her? Why won't you tell me?"

"I don't want you to know about that woman. She's part of the past,and she'll never be part of my family again. So what's the point of telling you about her?"


Lily sighed. “Since you won't open up to me, I might as well go behind your back," she said and began to walk away, but Alexander pulled her back.


“Let go of me.”

“What did you just say?" His voice was cold and threatening.

“I said I'll go behind your back. Don't say I didn't warn you."


Alexander's grip tightened, his anger rising. “Don't test mne. If I find out you're doing something behind my back, I will punish you."

He was deadly serious, and she could see it. If she acted, he would certainly follow through on his threat. But instead of backing down, she shot back.


"If you dare do anything to me, I'll divorce you!" That was the final straw. In a fit of rage, Alexander grabbed her and threw her onto the bed,climbing on top of her. Lily stared at his bloodshot eyes and swallowed hard. "Care to repeat that?



Lily didn't dare repeat her words, not with him so furious. She tried to free herself, but he held her firmly in place.

“Let go of me.”

Alexander glared at her, enraged that she had threatened him with divorce.“If you ever think of doing that, I'll lock you up in this house.”

He released her, and she wasted no time getting off the bed and walking out of the room, leaving him alone.


She had given him the chance to tell her about his mother,but he hadn't taken it. So in three days, she was heading to G city to see Angela in prison.
###Chapter 74

The next morning, the family of three sat down for breakfast together. Lily ate quickly, not wanting to linger at the table with Alexander,who had been silently watching her. They hadn't exchanged a word all morning,and she could see how much it was bothering him-he was struggling internally.


Alexander kept his eyes on his wife, who had been avoiding him completely. She had slept in their daughter's room last night, leaving hím alone,because she was upset with him. Should he finally tell her about his mother? It's not as if it would change anything.


Viola pouted as she noticed her mother avoiding her father, who had been trying to get her attention since breakfast began. She was sharp enough to figure out that her father was the one at fault.

Viola set her spoon down, gaining her parents' attention.

"What's wrong, sweetie? Don't you like the food?” Lily asked.

"I do, but I don't wvant to eat.”

"And why is that?" Alexander asked.

“Because you two aren't talking."

Lily and Alexander exchanged looks, surprised that their three-year-old had noticed. “Did you two have a fight? Mommy didn't talk to you when she got home yesterday. Daddy, did you make Mommy sad?”Viola always felt sad when her parents argued. Alexander was speechless. There was no denying it; she was asking to see if he'd lie.


"We'll sort it out, like always, baby. Couples argue, but they always make up, right, love?” He glanced at Lily, who shifted her gaze to their daughter,completely ignoring what he'd said.


"Mommy has to go to work now. Do you want Mommny to drop you off at school and buy you something different for breakfast?" Lily asked.


"Yes, Mommy, I'm coming with you." Viola was helped down from her seat by one of the maids and followed her mother out of the dining room.


Alexander sat there, watching as they both left him alone at the table.

His wife and child were upset with him. How was he going to fix this?

The servants glanced at him with pity as he ate breakfast alone. After dropping Viola off at school, Lily headed straight to work. Upon arrival,she was escorted to her office by her assistant, Karina.


"What's my schedule?" Lily asked as she settled into her executive chair,trying to maintain a calm demeanor despite the frustration lingering from her disagreement with Alexander.


Karina handed over her schedule for the day, and Lily quickly scanned it.


“First,you have a meeting with Peter Blake, CEO of BSC, and his team in an hour." After reviewing her schedule for the week, Lily set it down. “What's my schedule for the rest of this week and the start of next?" Karina ran through the details. It was Thursday, which meant Lily had just four days left before she would travel to G City to meet with Alexander's mother. Last night, she'd emailed Amanda, who had shown her photos of Angela in prison. It was the first time Lily had seen pictures of Alexander's mother, and she realized how much he resembled her-Angela was truly beautiful.

"Cancel my schedule for Friday, Saturday, and Monday and Tuesday next week.”

“Huh?”Karina was taken aback.

“You heard me."

“But,ma'am, these meetings are very important."

"Should I cancel them instead, or will you reschedule?"

"I'll reschedule. I'll inform the companies right away about the changes."

“Good.”

“But, ma'am, may I ask why you're canceling the meetings?"

"I'm heading to G City on Saturday. I'll make travel arrangements tomorrow.”


It takes abouteight hours to fly from Aurora City to G City.

“Okay,ma'am. Would you like me to book your flight?" Karina refrained from asking more questions, understanding that her boss's reasons for going to G City were personal. "No need, I'll take care of that." After giving Karina additional instructions, Lily called Michael to let him know she'd be joining him and Jacob in G City on Saturday.

"Wow,you suddenly decided to come along. What changed your mind?"

"Well, I figured since you guys are going, it's the perfect time for me to go too. I'd love to spend time with all three of you."

"That's great! Have you told your husband and daughter?"

“I'll let them know today."

“Okay.”

"Could you book my flight for me at the same time as yours?"

"Of course," Michael replied.

“Thanks. We'll talk later-I have a meeting."

“Bye,Lily.”

“Bye.”

She ended the call and gathered her things for the meeting with her father.


In the meeting room, Lily sat in the executive chair, waiting for a representative from BSC to present their project.

Her grandfather had called earlier, admitting that he'd mistakenly approved the project and handed it over to the project team without waiting for her or her father's input. As Lily listened to the project plan, she couldn't help but acknowledge that it was well-prepared and flawless. "The project plan is excellent, so we can proceed to the next phase. This meeting is adjourned," she announced, standing up and heading out.

Peter followed behind her. "Lily."

She stopped and turned to him. “Yes,Father?”

"Thank you for approving the project, and I'm sorry for keeping you in the dark. Would you be free for dinner this evening? I'd love to have dinner together so we can catch up. You can bring Alexander and Viola along. Let's have a family dinner-I've really missed you."


“Okay, Father, just text me the location and time, and we'll be there." Peter hugged her. “Thanks for letting me back into your life. I've really missed you.”


Lily smiled and hugged him back.“Me too,Father.”

After attending two more lengthy meetings, Lily tiredly walked back to her office, only to be met with a surprise.

When she entered, she found Alexander and Viola sitting on the office couch.


"Mommy's back from her meeting!" Little Viola rushed over and hugged her mother.


“Oh my, this is a pleasant surprise," Lily said as she spun her daughter around, who laughed happily.

“How was school?”

"It was good."

"Did you come to visit Mommy at work?” Viola nodded. "And Daddy too," she pointed at Alexander, who was walking toward them.


Alexander wrapped his arms around both her and their daughter, kissing Lily's cheek. "How's work going?"

Lily didn't respond.

“Apart from that other issue, there's nothing in this world that you could want that I wouldn't give you1, my love. You know I'd do anything for you,right?”


“You know I love you so much and hate seeing you upset."

Lily blinked at his words, which were whispered close to her ear, making her blush.


Viola grinned when she saw this. "Put me down, Mommy.I want to go see Aunt Karina."”


Lily put her down, and Viola used the excuseto leave her parents alone in the office.


After their daughter left, Alexander wrapped his arms around Lily and kissed her on the lips. "I brought you flowers."

"I don't want flowers," she frowned.

“Then what do you want? Just tell me, and I'll get it for you,"he promised.

Lily smiled.“Anything?” Alexander nodded. "I always keep my promises." Lily played with her fingers, thinking about how to phrase her request. She knew he would come to apologize, and she planned to use the opportunity to get what she wanted.

"I'll be going to G City with Michael and Jacob on Saturday. We want to visit Sarah and hang out like old times.”

"Did you say G City?" Alexander frowned.

“Yes,"she watched as his mood shifted.

“No.”

"Why can't I go?" she asked.

“You can ask Sarah to visit instead."


"She visited six months ago, so it's only fair that I visit her this time.Besides, I've never been to G City before, so I could use the opportunity."

Alexander stared at her in silence, clearly struggling with himself. He was trying not to say anything that would upset her, especially since they had just reconciled.


“Then I'll come with you."

Lily immediately shook her head. If he came along, her entire plan would be ruined-she wouldn't be able to visit his mother.


"Why don't you want me to come with you?" Alexander asked, frowning.

Was he beginning to suspect something?
###Chapter 75

"Why don't you want me to accompany you?" he asked, his brow furrowed. He couldn't grasp why she suddenly wanted to go to G City,and the idea of her going unsettled him.

"You really don't need to come along. You have work here, and who will take care of Viola?"


"She can come with us."

"And miss school?"

"Missing a few days of school isn't a big deal."

"It is when her exams are around the corner, and an eight-hour flight to a different time zone would be too tiring for her."

G City and Aurora City were in different time zones, with Aurora City being four hours ahead.


Alexander fell silent, searching for reasons to keep her from going. "I can ask Sophia to take care of her. She'll make sure she gets to school every day. Besides, we could use some time alone, don't you think?"

Lily shook her head. "You still haven't made up with Richard after your argument, and you don't have the best relationship with my friends, so no,I'm going alone on Saturday to G City, and I'll be back on Tuesday." She freed herself from his embrace and took her seat in the executive chair.Alexander turned and stared at her, then walked over, leaned in, and kissed her. "Alright, you can go."Lily smiled, wrapping her arms around him and kissing him again. Alexander pulled her up to deepen the kiss. "You've got a lot of making up to do tonight since you'll be gone for a few days."

Lily giggled, understanding his meaning, and kissed him back. "And I'll make sure to make up for it."

Alexander smirked. "My father wants to have dinner with us tonight."

"Dinner?"

She nodded. "All three of us."

"Viola too?"

"Yes."

He thought for a moment before replying. "Okay, what time and where?"

She gave him the details, and he nodded.

"Come, let's go for lunch. Viola is waiting for us."

"But I have work to finish."

"You can finish it when you get back."

After the family had lunch together, Alexander returned to work, and
Viola went with her mother to the office. She was excited to watch her mother at work since it had been a while. Viola sat on the couch, watching her mother work, dreaming of becoming a boss like her someday. Her father had told her that when she grew up,she would take over from him. Later that evening, they headed to the restaurant for dinner with Lily's 
father. When they arrived, they found her father and Alexander already seated and talking.


"Grandpa!" Viola rushed over to her grandfather and hugged him.

"My brilliant granddaughter. Grandpa missed you so much," he said,hugging and kissing her forehead.


"And I missed you too."

Lily sat beside Alexander and pecked his cheek. "You got here early."

"Yes, I finished work on time."

"Are you two getting along?"

"Yes,since you've made up with him, it's only right that I get along with him. If you hadn't, I wouldn't have either."


His words made her think of his mother. She was going to G City to see her behind his back, without his knowledge. If he found out, Alexander would be furious. She shuddered at the thought.


"What's wrong?" he asked, noticing her hands were warm and slightly damp.

"Nothing,I'm fine."

Alexander studied her briefly before nodding.

"We should order before it gets too late,"Peter said. "I want chicken,Grandpa." The adults laughed at her straightforwardness. "Of course, I'll make sure they bring you some chicken."

"Thanks,Grandpa."

"Anything for my granddaughter."

The family of four enjoyed dinner together, anad after a few hours,they headed home. Viola fell asleep in her father's arms, while Lily rested her head on Alexander's shoulder as they drove home.

Alexander kissed her forehead, then kissed their daughter's. They were the most important people in his life, and he would do anything to protect them.

On Saturday, Lily packed her things and headed downstairs. Her flight was in two hours.
0
Viola pouted when she saw her mother with a suitcase.

"Take the luggage to the car," Lily instructed one of the guards.

"Yes, ma'am."

Lily picked up her daughter and showered her with kisses all over her face.

"I'll miss you, Mommy," Viola said, kissing her mother's cheek with her tiny lips.

Lily smiled. "Mommy will only be gone for a few days,okay?"

Viola nodded firmly. "Okay, Mommy." Lily kissed her forehead again. "I'll be going now." "Okay,Mommy." Lily set her down. "Take good care of her," she told the nanny.

"I will, ma'am," the nanny replied.


She glanced at her daughter onelast time before stepping outside. She was surprised to see Alexander's car still parked there. She thought he had left for workafter saying goodbye.

She knocked on the window, and he rolled it down. "You haven't left yet?"

"Get in. I want to drop you off at the airport."

"Aren't you going to be late for your meeting?"

"I'm the boss. I can't be late."

Lily got in the car, and soon they were on their way to the airport. After a 40-minute drive, they arrived.

"I'll be leaving now. I'll miss you," she said to him.


Alexander leaned in and kissed her,his tongue exploring her mouth as he kissed her passionately. Lily responded in kind, losing her breath until he finally pulled away.


The bodyguards in the front seats respectfully looked away,giving the couple some privacy.


Lily's cheeks flushed.

Alexander smiled at her rosy face. "I'll miss you," "Me too." "Make sure you come back by Tuesday, or I'll come to get you myself." "I promise I'll be back by Tuesday."

"Good girl," he said, gently brushing her hair like she was a child.

"I'll be going now."

"Wait."

She paused, waiting for him to speak.

"Don't do anything behind my back. I'll find out if you do," he warned,his tone serious.


Lily smiled and nodded.

"Goodbye, my love," Alexander said.

"Goodbye."

She got out of the car and swallowed hard. She was going to be in big trouble when he found out what she was planning.

She took her suitcase from the guards and walked into the airport.

She met Michael and Jacob there, and soon they were on their way to G City. After a nine-hour journey, they finally arrived in the evening.

The aerial view of G City was breathtaking; it was beautiful. Although Aurora City was more stunning, the difference between the two was that Aurora City was a business hub, while G City had a more civil and military vibe. Sarah was waiting for them at the airport. She smiled when she saw Michael and Jacob, but when she spotted Lily, she screamed and rushed to hug her. "Oh my God! This is such a surprise! I had no idea you were coming!"Sarah had no clue that Lily was joining them.

"This is the best surprise I've had in months."

Lily smiled and hugged her back. "I've missed you,Sarah."

"I've missed you more."

"Are we invisible now?" Jacob said with a sigh.

"We're always invisible when these two get together," Michael added.

The women walked ahead.chatting, while the men trailed behind like bodyguards.

"This city is so beautiful and peaceful," Lily remarked.

"It's only quiet during the day. You should see it at night."

"Really? It seems to be the opposite of Aurora City. Aurora is buzzing during the day, with everyone rushing to work, including me."

Sarah smiled. "I miss Viola. Did she ask about her godmother?"

"She did. She told me to give you lots of kisses."

"Awww, so sweet. I wish she were here."

"I don't." Sarah raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean you don't? You don't want her to be with her godmother?" sheasked,frowning. "That's not it. I didn't come here just for fun, Sarah. While I'm using this chance to see you, I'm actually here in G City for another reason." Sarah stopped walking and faced her. The serious look on Lily's face told her something was up. "Why are you really here?"

Lily glanced around and saw Michael and Jacob approaching."I'll tell you when we're alone."

"They don't know why you're really here?"

"Nobody knows, but you'll be the first I tell because I need your help with a plan."
###Chapter 76

Sarah was shocked. "What? Alexander's mother reached out to you?" she asked, standing up abruptly from the couch to face Lilly. Lilly had just explained why she had come as soon as she had settled into her apartment.The apartment wasn't spacious enough for all of them, so Michael and
Jacob had booked a hotel nearby, while Lillystayed with Sarah.

"Yes." Lilly confirmed.

"So, it's true? She's really in prison?"

"Yes, and from what I was told, she's already served her sentence,but Alexander is still keeping her there."

"Don't you think he has his reasons for doing that?"

"T've considered that, but Alexander isn't telling me anything. This might be my only chance to talk to his mother."

"But what if this is all a lie? You didn't just believe everything that woman told you, did you? She could be in prison for a good reason,and this could all be a trap."

"You think I didn't consider that? Of course, I came prepared."

Sarah sat back down, her curiosity piqued. "True, you're not one to act without a backup plan. So, what's the plan?" "I got detailed information from Jayla about how to enter the prison disguised as a guard and who to approach to arrange a private meeting with Alexander's mother. If it turns out to be a trap, that's where you come in. You're a secret agent with the national police here in G city,so you have connections." "What kind of heIp will you need?"

"Tve got a Plan B and a Plan C. Plan B is in case Alexander's mother tries to trap me into getting Alexander to release her. I'll need people insidethe prison who can assist me if things go wrong."

"Is Plan B really necessary?"

"Yes,because Alexander will almost certainly find out that I visited his mother. The plan is to leave G city and return to Aurora City before he arrives. If it turns out that his mother is genuine, then Plan B won't be needed, and we'll move on to Plan C-avoiding my husband's anger."

Sarah couldn't help but smile. "This is going to be quite the adventure."




Lilly pulled her disguise tighter as she walked into the prison among the other female guards. She hoped she was mnaking the right decision by coming here to see Angela.


Almost immediately, a senior guard noticed her. Jayla had toldher there would be someone inside to help her meet Angela in private, and the woman staring at her matched the description perfectly. After traveling all the way to G city and witnessing the extent of Alexander's influence here, Lilly had prepared herself for the worst. She knew that by the time she finished speaking to Angela and left the prison,Alexander would likely be in the city. He had people watching his mother around the clock, and she suspected he had people monitoring her from the moment she stepped off the plane. Lilly discreetly made the hand signal Jayla had taught her, indicating that she was the person the guards were expecting. The guard gestured for her to follow.

Lilly trailed behind the guard, who led her to a secluded area of the prison.They stopped in front of a door.

"In here, it's an old storage room. You can meet with her inside," the guard said.

"Thank you," Lilly replied, turning the doorknob and pushing the door open.

Angela was standing by the window when she heard the door.She turned and saw Lilly, her face breaking into a smile. Without warning,she rushed over and enveloped Lilly in a tight hug.

Lilly was taken aback by the unexpected embrace, but Angela held on,not just hugging her but holding her tightly.

When she finally let go. Angela looked at Lilly with a warm smile. "I'm so grateful you came. Thank you,Lilly."

Lilly nodded, still processing the warmth of the older woman's welcome.

"You're even more beautiful in person. The photos in the magazines and newspapers dona't do you justice," Angela said with genuine affection.

"You look so much like Alexander, and you're younger-looking than I expected," Lilly observed, noting the resemblance between mother and son,though Alexander had a more masculine appearance, possibly due to his father's influence. Angela smiled. "I'm glad he only inherited my looks," she said,gesturing for Lilly to sit across from her. Lilly took in the room's dusty surroundings, noticing that only the area around the table and chairs had been cleaned.

"Don't mind the dust; this isan old storage room. I only had time to clean this part." Angela explained.

Lilly nodded and sat down.

"How is my granddaughter? I wish I could see her," Angela said softly.


"She's doing well."

"I'm sure she doesn't know anything about me."

"She doesn't. In fact, I don't know much about you either. All I have are rumors. So, tell me your side of the story. How did you end up in prison?Why is Alexander keeping you here? And why did you want to meet?"

"Those are a lot of questions," Angela remarked.

"Take them one at a time," Lilly said, leaning back in her chair.


"After my husband died because of my infidelity, I planned to leave the country a year later. But at the airport security check, I was caught with drugs in my bag.I thought I could get away with it since the drugs were hidden in my shoes' heels, as the people who gave them to me assured me.But someone tipped off the authorities, and that's how I ended up with a 15-year prison sentence."


Lilly didn't react to Angela's confession but moved on to her next question."Why does Alexander want you to stay here?"Angela seemed surprised that Lilly didn't judge her for her actions."Can I answer the third question before the second?" “Why?”

"It's better that way."

"Go ahead."

"I asked you here because I needed to talk to someone. I've been here for 1S years without any contact with my family or anyone from the outside.You're Alexander's wife, the woman he loves most, and he has refused to see me. I haven't laid eyes on my son since the day his father died,"Angela's voice cracked, and tears welled up in her eyes.

Lilly could feel the pain in her words.

"The only connection I have to the outside world is the magazines and newspapers that feature him. That's how I know he's grown into a handsome man who commands the business world. I never got the chance to beg for forgiveness. I wanted to meet with you, my daughter-in-law, to ask a favor."

"What favor?"

"I've made mistakes my whole life. In here, I've learned from those mistakes. I was a terrible wife and mother. I regret causing my husband's death, who loved me dearly and wanted nothing more than for me to change. I regret not considering how deeply my actions affected Alexander.I regret trying to flee the country with drugs instead of staying to make amends. I regret everything that led me to this prison. Every day,I wish I could turn back time and undo what I did," she said, her voice trembling as she wept. Lilly listened, moved by her words. "I just want one thing-to see my son. Even if he decides to keep me here, I just want to see him and ask for his forgiveness." Angela pleaded, tears streaming down her face.


Lilly didn't realize she was crying too. She leaned in and held Angela's hand. "He's never told me anything about you. Even mentioning your name makes him angry. But I'll see what I can do."

"Thank you," Angela whispered gratefully, tears still falling.

"You still haven't told me why Alexander wants you to stay here." Lilly reminded her.


Angela withdrew her hands. looking down at her feet. "Because I'm a murderer. I killed my own chld."
###Chapter 77

"What do you mean by you killed your own child? I don't understand.Which child are you referring to?"

"I was already three months pregnant when Alexander's father caught me in bed with another man. That was part of the reason he was so devastated that heended up in an accident," Angela's lips quivered as tears rolled down her face.

Lilly opened her mouth to speak but then closed it, utterly shocked.Who in the world gets pregnant and then cheats on her husband? What could have driven her to such desperation? It couldn't have been for money;she married into a wealthy family. So why?

Lilly stared at her, disappointment evident in her eyes. "Why? Tell me why?"

"I'm sorry."

"I'm not the one you should apologize to."

"I know, but I was a horrible person, so I'm sorry you had to learn about someone likeme and the things I did."

"I'll ask again. Why?"

"I was desperate. I couldn't live the life I wanted after marrying Alexander's father and having him." "Why couldn't you change for the man you loved? Why couldn't you change for Alexander, your son?" Angela swallowed the lump in her throat. "I tried my best." "You tried your best? And even after getting pregnant, you couldn't control yourself? Instead, you cheated and caused the death of your husband." Lilly hadn't planned on being so harsh, but after hearing Angela's story, she couldn't help it.

Angela remained silent.

"Go on, tell me, what happened to the child?"

Angela swallowed. "After my husband's burial, the Kane family put me in prison. But they released me when they found out I was pregnant. They agreed to cover my expenses until I gave birth, on the condition that I would leave the child with them and go far away. I had already lost Alexander, who hated me for causing his father's death. I couldn't bear the thought of losing another child, so I decided it was better that the child was dead than for me not to be in their life. I killed my child when I was six months pregnant. I watched as the baby's tiny eyes, heart,legs,and hands were torn apart during the abortion." Her entire body trembled as she spoke.

Lilly couldn't believe what she was hearing. It was so cruel and heartbreaking that she-couldn't stop the tears from falling. This was the height of wickedness. When Grandma Helen told her about Angela,she had conveniently skipped this part. Perhaps she didn't want to rememnber such a horrific act, which is why she didn't speak about it. If this was Alexander's reason for wanting her to remain in prison, then it was justified. "This is pure evil. How could you!" Angela wept bitterly. "I'm ready to pay for all I've done.""And you will pay." Lilly stood up from the chair. "Ithink I've heard enough." She wiped her tears. Shecouldn't remember the last time she cried this much. As a mother, it pained her deeply to hear of a woman killing her unborn child who was already six months along.

Angela stood up as well. "These were my past sins. I regret everything I did."


"Of course, you should! You deprived Alexander of having a sibling. If you hadn't killed that child, maybe Alexander would have forgiven you long ago. But you dared to do such a thing."

Now Lilly understood why Alexander got so angry whenever anyone mentioned his mother and why he refused to tell her anything about Angela. Everything about her was too horrible to recount. Now she understood why he wanted his grandparents to adopt Kate, to fill the sibling void in his heart and life that his mother had created.

"I'm sure Alexander must have had some hope when he learned he was going to be an older brother, but you crushed that tiny bit of joy and hope by killing his unborn sibling! The least you could have done was leave the child with the Kane family. It's only right that the child would have grown up with them and Alexander rather than have a mother like you!"

"Tell me the truth. The real reason you killed your unborn child was that you didn't want another child to despise you as Alexander did, isn't that right?" When Lilly saw Angela look away and cry even harder, she knew she had hit the truth.

"I guess you should get used to staying here until Alexander decides to forgive you."

"I don't mind staying here for the rest of my life since Ideserve it,but all I ask is to see my son, even if it's just for a few minutes. I need him to 
know how much I regret everything I've done and to ask for his forgiveness," Angela sobbed.

Lilly sighed.

"Please," Angela knelt in front of her and clutched her legs. "Please, I beg you. You're the only one who can make him change his mind. You're the only one who can get him to see me. Please."

Lilly's clothes were stained with Angela's tears. "Alright, I'Il see what I can do. Just stand up."

Angela stood up and wiped her tears. "Thank you," she said, hugging Lilly.

"I'm leaving now."

Angela nodded. "Alright. Thank you so much for agreeing to see me, Lilly.
"

"You're welcome."

Lilly knocked on the door, and the prison guards who had escorted her opened it.

"Are you done talking?" the female prison guard asked.

"Yes, it's time for me to go." Angela smiled at her as she walked out the door. She hoped Alexander would come to see her soon. After leaving the prison and changing into different clothes with a hoodie,Lilly crossed to the other side of the road and walked towards the car waiting a short distance away. Lilly got into the front seat, and Sarah, who was in the driver's seat,started the car and drove away.


Sarah glanced at Lilly, whose eyes were red from crying. "What happened in there?"


"A lot. There was so much information that brought me to tears.That woman has done so much harm and damage."

"Do you want to talk about it now or later?"

"I'll give you the full story later."

"Okay, but tell me, why did she want to meet with you?"

"Because she says she wants to meet Alexander. She said he's refused to see her for 18 years now. She wants to beg for his forgiveness."

"Well,how do you plan to convince Alexander?"

"I think I should first deal with the storm that's coming."

"I'm sure he already knows by now and is on his way here."

"Yes, I'm afraid of what he's going to do."

Sarah smiled. "Alexander loves you so much. I've seen how much he loves you these past three years, so he'll surely forgive you for doing this behind his back." "That's after he teaches me a lesson." Sarah laughed. "Gosh, I wish I could be there to see how he's going to punish you." "He warned me before I came here. Alexander was dead serious this time.It's not going to be like any other punishment he's given before."

Sarah said nothing else and just drove. "Since there was no need for plan B, do you still have plan C in mind?"

"Yes, I'm done here. Take me to the airport."

"Aren't you going to say goodbye to Michael and Jacob?They called to know where you were."

"Just tell them something urgent came up, so I had to go back home."

"Okay."

"Are my things in the car trunk?"
 
"Yes."

"Thank you for helping me, Sarah. What would I have done without you?"

Lilly smiled at her.

"You're welcome," Sarah smiled back.

Soon, Lilly boarded the plane back to Aurora City, and just ten hours after she left, Alexander arrived in G City with his private jet.He had gotten the information late that Lilly had actually gone to see his mother. Now it was clear to him why she had asked about her last time;she had planned on visiting his mother. How dare she go behind his back like this? In his anger, he ordered his people to prepare the jet and flew to G City, unaware that Lilly had already left. "Give me her location," he demanded, his voice filled with anger.

"Sir, the thing is..." James hesitated.

"What is it?"

"Ma'am already returned home. According to the information I got,she arrived in Aurora City about an hour ago." Alexander clenched his fist."How smart of her."

"Sir, I just received another update. Ma'am has packed her things and Viola's and is on her way to the Blake family residence right now as we speak."

Alexander's face darkened.

Was she trying to escape her punishmenit? How dare she leave his house!
###Chapter 78
While Alexander thought about how to handle his wife for going behind his back and leaving the house afterward, he received a message from her.

"Sir, there's a message for you."

"Who sent it?"

"It's from Madam."

Alexander's eyes narrowed as he looked at the phone. "Hand it over."

James passed him the phone, and he read the message from his wife.

"IF YOU HAD TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR MOTHER, I WOULDN'T HAVE BOTHERED GOING TO THE PRISON TO SEE HER. YOU SHOULDN'T BLAME ME FOR BEING CURIOUS. I'VE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WILL ONLY RETURN WHEN YOU'VE VISITED YOUR MOTHER.SINCE YOU'RE ALREADY IN G CITY,YOU SHOULD TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HER."


Alexander's expression darkened. Was she trying to challenge him?

He immediately called her, and Lilly answered on the first ring.

"Alexander," her voice came through the line.

"After what you did behind my back, you dare to tell me to visit her!" His anger was palpable.


"Don't you want to know what your mother and I talked about?"Alexander stayed silent, wanting to know both what was discussed and how Lilly had found out his mother was in prison. "How did you find out she was in prison?"

"I'll tell you once you come to pick us up from the family house,but only after you've visited her."

"So now you're giving me ultimatums?"

"No, I'm not," she said, feigning innocence.

"I wish you were here so I could silence you myself."

Lilly fell silent.

"Now you're quiet?"

"Will you see her?"
0
"Over my dead body."

"Please,Alexander, do it for me, I'm begging you. Your mother told me everything she did. It was horrible to hear, and now I understand why you never wanted to talk about her. I'm sorry for going behind your back,but I love you so much. You know I wouldn't normally do something like this without telling you, but I needed to understand what happened," she pleaded, hoping to soften his heart and sway him from punishing her.


Alexander remained silent, knowing his wife had a way of getting out of trouble.


"Alexander?" she called out when he stayed quiet for too long. "Will you see her? I'm not asking you to forgive her orrelease her from prison."

"I'm sure she contacted you, but I'm still wondering how she managed to do it." He was baffled by how his mother had reached out to Lilly or if someone had helped her. "We can discuss that later."

"Did she tell you she wanted to see me?"

"Yes, that's the main reason she wanted me to visit her. She says she regrets everything and just wants to ask for your forgiveness. Even if you don't forgive her, at least hear her out."

"Hmmm."

"Will you go?"

"I'll decide that." Alexander hung up the call.

He turned to James. "Get the private jet ready; we're going back home."

"Right away,sir."

There was no way he would visit that woman in prison. She wouldn't see him again until her dying day.




At the Blake residence, Lilly sighed as the call ended.

"Was that Alexander?" Caleb asked as he entered the livingroom.

"Yes,Grandfather."

"He must be furious with you for going behind his back," he said,settling onto a nearby couch. He had been surprised when his granddaughter arrived with Viola and a few pieces of luggage. Initially, he thought Alexander had done something to upset her, but then he learned that Lilly had upset her husband and fled here out of fear of his reaction.

"He is, but now that I've spoken to him, he won't be as angry."

"He'll come to take you both back home when he returns, you know that,right?"

"I know he'll come here, but I'Il only go back with him after I'm sure he's visited his mother."

"From what you've told me about that woman, Alexander has every right to treat her as he does. If I were him, I'd do even more." Caleb couldn't help but agree with Alexander. He rarely saw eye to eye with the young man, but in this case, he completely supported him.

"I know, Grandfather, but visiting his mother is also for his own good."

"And how is it good for him to see that woman? She'll only bring up memories of the terrible things she's done."

"Not if he sees how much she regrets her actions and sincerely asks for his forgiveness. Talking to her might ease some of the pain he's been holding onto for years."

Caleb sighed. "Do you think he'll listen to you and go see her?"

"I hope so."
 
"And if he doesn't?" "Then I'll stay here." "You should know Alexander by now. There's no way he'll leave here without you and Viola." "Grandfather, won't you help?" Lilly pouted.

"Not this time, Lilly. In this situation,you're in the wrong. So if Alexander comes, I'll let him take you back home." Alexander drove straight to the Blake family estate the moment he arrived in Aurora City. He had dismissed al his guards and drove himself to the house.


He parked in front of the main building and strode inside,ignoring the guards and Victor, who had come out to greet him. He scanned the living room but didn't see Lilly or their child, so he headed directly to her room upstairs.

On his way, he passed some maids who greeted him with bowed heads,but he ignored them. The cold look on his face filled them with fear.

He reached the room door and pushed it open to find Lilly and Viola sleeping peacefully on the bed. The sight was so serene and beautiful that it momentarily dispelled his anger.It was already 11 PM, so it made sense that they would be asleep.


He quietly closed the door behind him and walked toward the bed, his eyes fixed on them. They looked adorable as they slept.

Alexander stood there, watching them for almost 30 minutes.

Little Viola stirred and opened her eyes, immediately spotting her father.

Her eyes lit up. "Daddy!"

Alexander's cold expression softened into a smile. He picked her up and hugged her. "My baby girl."

She placed her tiny hands on his cheeks and kissed his forehead.

Alexander smiled and kissed her forehead in return. "Did Daddy wake you?"

She shook her head. "No."

"Do you want to go home?"

Viola looked at her sleeping mother. "But Mummy's sleeping." Alexander glanced at Lilly, who slept so peacefully, as if she had no worries in the world.


"Do you know the way to your room here?"

She nodded. "It's the room across the hall." Because of how much her great-grandfather adored her, Viola had her own room in his mansion.

Alexander took her to her room and tucked her into bed, kissing her forehead. "Go to sleep, okay? Daddy will come later." She nodded and closed her eyes.

Alexander returned to Lilly's room. He shut the door behind him and walked toward her on the bed.

He removed his shoes, his suit jacket, and his tie, then rolled up his sleeves before sitting on the bed beside her.He gently tapped her shoulder to wake her.Lilly slowly opened her eyes and saw him, his cold gaze fixed on her. "Sit up," he said sternly. Lilly obediently sat up, folding her hands and legs, then looked at him.

"I promise I won't overlook what you did today," he said, hinting at the consequences he had in mind for her.

"Get your things ready; we're going back home."

"Did you visit her?" she asked.

Alexander's expression darkened. "Over my dead body."

"In that case, I'm not going anywhere wwith you." She turned her face away from him.


Alexander clenched his fists tightly. "You're coming home with me,whether you like it or not. Now get up," he ordered.

"No," she responded stubbornly.

"You know I can carry youout of here,right?"

"You're goingto take me home against my will?"

"Yes."

"Just because I'm your wife doesn't mean you should force me."

"You should've known what you were getting into when you decided to marry me."

"So it's my fault I'm in this situation with you?" "Who else's fault could it be?" Lilly continued to look away from him. Alexander grabbed her chin and made her face him. "You're too stubborn for your own good. What am I going to do with you?" He was exasperated.As much as he wanted to punish his defiant wife, he couldn't bring himself to do it.


"Nothing, just forgive me." She moved closer, wrapped her arms around him. and gave him a passionate kiss.
###Chapter 79

Alexander understood what Lilly was trying to do. but he couldn't resist her kiss and responded in kind-how could he resist her? After a long kiss,Lilly pulled away to catch her breath, her eyes meeting Alexander's, filled with desire. He looked at her with such intensity that it made her blush.Lilly wrapped her arms around him and kissed him again, wanting them to become closer.

Alexander gently laid her down on the bed and kissed her more deeply.his tongue exploring her mouth. When he remembered how she had gone against his wishes, he took the opportunity to assert his control,biting her lower lip. causing her to feel a mis of discomfort and pleasure.

He kissed his way down to her intimate area.using his fingers to heighten her pleasure, making her cry out. He continsued to bring her pleasure and at the same time make her feel overw heined, until she could barely take it anymore.

"Alexander...haaaaa,"she moaned.

More than 30 minutes had passed. yet Alesander hadn't moved forward.keeping her in anticipation as pant of her lesson. She wanted all of him.but he delayed, making her wait.

Alexander moved back up, kissing her again before moving down to focus on her chest. She couldn't bear the intensity any longer, she felt as if she might lose control."Alexander... please," she pleaded. Alexander paused and looked at her flushed face, which was begging for him,and he smirked."Please what?" Lilly bit her lower lip. "Please stop teasing me and just make love with me.1


"Not yet," he said and resumed kissing and pleasing her again with his mouth and fingers. She reached her peak several times until she was utterly exhausted.

Finally, Alexander joined with her, starting slowly and then gradually increasing the pace. Lilly cried out in pleasure as his slow movements became faster. Alexander shifted their positions multiple times, moving faster each time.

Lilly tried her best not to cry out since they were in her grandfather's house and Viola was sleeping in the room opposite them. If she had known this would happen, she might not have initiated things-now Alexander wouldn't stop until he was completely satisfied.

After three rounds. Alexander still wasn't fully satisfied.but he stopped because of how tired Lilly was. Alexander wrapped his arms around her as she rested her head on his chest. He kissed her forehead as she drifted off to sleep. When Lilly woke up the next morning, she was alone in the bed. The other side was disheveled, indicating that Alexander had left as soon as he woke up. This was the first time he had left the bed before her,especially after being intimate.

It meant he was still upset with her. She got up, washed up, and chose something to wear that would cover her neck, where Alexander had left his marks. She still felt very weak that morning. After leaving the room, she went to Viola's room and was informed by the maid cleaning the room that they were having breakfast downstairs. She headed downstairs to the dining area, and as she was about to enter,she overheard her grandfather speaking.

"Sometimes Lilly acts immaturely; as her husband, you should overlook her actions at times."

Lilly couldn't believe what she was hearing-was her grandfather speaking on her behalf? When did the two men start getting along well enough to have breakfast together and discuss her?

Lilly walked into the dining area after they stopped talking.

"Good morning, Grandpa," Lilly greeted her grandfather with her head bowed.

Alexander pushed the chair next to him out for her to sit.

Lilly wanted to sit near her grandfather, but when she saw him signaling for her to sit beside Alexander, she obediently walked to his side and sat down.

Alexander placed food on her plate, giving her a bit of everything on the table,mostly vegetables.

"Eat up."

Caleb watched closely, noticing how Alexander calmly showed her affection despite his lingering anger. This made him smile, and he decided to leave them alone to finish their breakfast. "Grandpa, are you going somewhere?" Lilly asked when she saw her gran dfather stand up. "I'm done with breakfast." "But you still have food on your plate, you should eat more, Grandpa."

"T'll eat enough during lunch," he said and left the dining room.

Lilly watched him as he walked out, supporting himself with his walking stick. Her grandfather had taken good care of his health over the years,but now she felt he wasn't doing so as much. She would need to hire someone to help take care of him occasionally-she couldn't bear the thought of losing him.


Alexander held her hand gently when he noticed her worried expression."Don't worry about him, he's a strong man. He'll still be here in 20 years'time," he reassured her.


Lilly looked at him and nodded, "I hope so."

"Go ahead and eat; your breakfast is getting cold."

"Okay, but where is Viola? The maid I met cleaning her room said she was here."


"I already sent Max to take her to school before I came down."

"Oh, I forgot she should be in school by now."

Alexander smiled at her forgetfulness. "Eat up, so we won't be late."

"Where are we going?"

Alexander looked at her with a serious expression. "Did you forget your punishment so soon?" Lilly immediately lost her appetite. She dropped her spoon and looked at Alexander, whose expression was unreadable. Was she really not going to escape her punishment? "Alexander,you still intend to go through with it?"

"IfI don't correct you, you'll continue to act behind my back. To prevent that, I have to do this."

Lilly leaned back in her chair and crossed her arms.

Seeing that she had lost interest in the food. Alexander frowned. "You'd better eat and eat well, because what you're about to face will require a lot of strength."

It seemed she wouldn't be able to avoid it, so she decided to prepare for what was to come.

Alexander picked up the spoon, filled it with food, and held it near her mouth. "Open up and eat."

Lilly looked at him. "No, I'll skip." She turned away, ignoring him.

"Just tell me what my punishment is."

She needed to know what was coming so she could plan accordingly.
###Chapter 80

"If I disclose your penalty now,it will take away the excitement, my dear."Alexander said. Lilly had a strong premonition that whatever was planned for her would be unpleasant, so she needed to prepare herself.

"I need to use the restroom. I'll be down shortly so we can head out," she announced, rising and leaving without waiting for his consent. By the time she was finished with Alexander, he would be too wary to attempt anything against her in the future to avoid losing her.

She checked to ensure he wasn't following her before closing the door and heading to the restroom. Once inside, she sat on the toilet and retrieved her phone. She called Sarah, who answered on the first ring.

"Hey Lilly, how's everything? Did you change his mind? Is he still upset with you? I've been waiting for your call since yesterday," Sarah inquired.bombarding her with questions.

"He's still going forward with his plan to 'punish' me, as he puts it," Lilly replied.

"What's the punishment?" Sarah asked.

"I don't know yet, but I'll be initiating Plan D," Lilly said.

"Wait, there's a Plan D?" Sarah asked, surprised.

After her conversation with them, Lilly checked the time and realized she had been in the restroom for 30 minutes. Alexander might already be at the door waiting for her. She exited the restroom and returned to the room,only to find him sitting on the bed. She was confident he hadn't overheard her conversation, thanks to the restroom's soundproofing. Even after all these years, she still didn't understand why her grandfather had made the restroom soundproof but not the rest of the room. "He's really going to be furious. You might even provoke him into locking you up one day. Isn't your grandfather saying anything?" Sarah inquired.

"Grandfather supports him. He was even pleading on my behalf this morning," Lilly said. She remembered how her grandfather used to discipline her and her late sisters when they were growing up, so his support for Alexander didn't surprise her.

"Seriously?" Sarah asked, disbelieving.

"Yes, so whatever Alexander plans to do, Grandfather won't interfere,"Lilly noted, recalling how her grandfather Caleb used to handle things when they were children.

"So,what's your plan?" Sarah asked.

"You'll find out later," Lilly said with a smile, thinking about it.

After ending her call with Sarah, Lilly contacted Michael and Jacob to share her plan. They weren't supportive and saw it as a risk to their own interests. They knew well how formidable Alexander could be when truly enraged, and what Lilly was about to do would not only anger him but deeply concern him as well. Jacob, in particular, was anxious since he had been instructed to hack into Jack's phone to find out the specifics of the punishment so they could prepare. Alexander gave her a scrutinizing look. "What were you doing in there for over 30 minutes?"


"I was using the restroom," Lilly replied, meeting his gaze.

Alexander looked at her for a moment before standing up and approaching her. Lilly thought he was going to question her further, but instead.he said something different.

"You should change into something else."

"Why? Don't you like this outfit?" Lilly asked, looking down at her clothes and wondering what was wrong with them.

"It's nice, but since you're going to face your punishment, you should wear something more comfortable," he suggested.

What kind of punishment was she going to face? Lilly wondered. By now,Jacob would have already hacked into Jack's phone, but she still had no idea. Whatever it was, she was confident they would come up with a good plan to get her out of it. She just hoped it wasn't at one of Alexander's remote locations, as escaping from there would be nearly impossible.

Alexander watched her as she appeared lost in thought,likely contemplating her punishment.

"Get changed," he instructed, pointing to the outfit laid out on the bed. Lilly's eyes fell on the athletic wear-a pair of exercise pants and a top.Was she going to be doing some sort of physical activity? Alexander disliked clothes that revealed too much of her body, so she wondered why he wanted her to wear such tight-fitting clothes. "You dislike clothes like this, so why do you want me to wear them?" Lilly asked.puzzled.

Alexander looked at the clothes. He indeed disliked it when she wore revealing outfits outside, especially when other men looked at her with desire. Over the past three years, he had dealt harshly with men who dared to look at her inappropriately.

It took him considerable resolve and multiple considerations before he allowed her to wear this, given that there was no other choice. "If anyone dares to look at you with inappropriate intent, I will ensure they regret it,"Alexander warned.


Lilly knew he was serious. He had almost followed through on a similar threat before when one of Blake's business associates had ogled her during a meeting. Alexander hadn't been present, but how he discovered it made Lilly realize he kept a close watch on hef.

"Get dressed," Alexander repeated.

Lilly picked up the outfit and went to change in the closet. When she emerged, Alexander was no longer in the room. She put on sneakers and took her phone before leaving.

"Are you heading for a workout?" her grandfather Caleb asked when he saw her outfit.

Lilly glanced at her sportswear. "Alexander said it's part of my punishment," she explained. As soon as she finished speaking, Caleb burst into laughter. "Grandpa, it's not funny," Lilly protested. "It is to me," Caleb said with amusement. 
"How is me being punished funny?" Lilly's frown deepened.

"It's just a minor correction a husband gives his wife," Caleb explained.still chuckling.

Lilly wanted to ask if this was how he disciplined her grandmother but chose not to, not wanting to bring up painful memories.

"Really?" Lilly asked.

"Yes," Alexander said as he came down the stairs.

Lilly turned to him and frowned. "Is this what the scriptures say about how husbands should treat their wives?"

Her eyes widened at her own question. Alexander and Caleb looked at her in shock.

"Says the wife who doesn't even own a Bible," Alexander replied, amused.
Caleb shook his head and stood up to leave the room.

"Grandpa," Lilly called, unable to believe he was allowing this.

"Goodbye,granddaughter," Caleb said as he went to his study.

Alexander took her hand. "We should leave now."

As they left the house, Lilly glanced back, hoping her grandfather might intervene. They got into the car, and the chauffeur drove them out of the estate. Lilly kept her eyes on the road, trying to discern their destination. Thirty minutes later, they had left the city, traveling on a highway toward the mountains. Lilly glanced at Alexander, who was intently focused on his laptop. "Alexander," she said.

"Mmm," he responded without looking up.

"Where are we going?" she asked.

"You'll find out," he replied vaguely.

"Did it really anger you that I went to see your mother, or is it because I did it without informing you?" Lilly asked.

Alexander stopped typing and looked up with an expressionless face."Both," he replied plainly.

"You didn't think I needed to know about her. If you had told me,I wouldn't have gone to see her. If you were in my place, what would you have done?" she asked, but Alexander femained silent. He returned to his work,ignoring her.


Lilly turned to the window, her thoughts a whirlwind of emotions. The colorful autumn leaves gently swayed in the breeze, creating a beautiful view outside.

After about an hour, the car stopped in a wooded area with rocky terrain and tall mountains. The peaceful surroundings were broken only by the rustling leaves and distant bird calls. Lilly got out of the car,followed by Alexander, who signaled to his men to bring over the supplies. They promptly brought a large backpack. Alexander took the backpack, placed it on her back, and then put a coat on her. Lilly was confused. "Alexander,can you explain this to me?" she asked, bewildered. "You're going to climb the mountainto the other side," Alexander said.pointing into the distance.

Lilly's jaw dropped. "Is this my punishment?"

"You'll climb the mountain. The backpack contains a tent for you to sleep in if you don't make it to the other side before dark. I didn't plan to provide any food, just water, but since you missed breakfast, I included lunch. Good luck reaching the other side," he said.

Lilly stared at him in disbelief. Was this the man she loved, married,and had a child with? She knew he could be ruthless, but she hadn't expected this level of severity.

"Alexander, you want me to climb this mountain for a whole day? What will you tell Viola when she asks where her mother is?" she questioned.

"I told her you're on a business trip," Alexander replied.

"You told her what?" Lilly asked, astonished.

"You heard me."

"And what about my work? I run a multi-million dollar company," Lilly said,exasperated.


"You'll return to work tomorrow. If you want to reach the other side on time, I suggest you start climbing," Alexander said coldly."Alexander, look at me," Lilly pleaded, placing her hand  on his face. Alexander turned to her, his expression stilI cold. Lilly's heart ached as she looked at hím. "Are you sure you want me to go through this? To climb this mountain?" she asked.

Alexander remained silent.

"Look me in the eyes and tell me you truly want this," Lilly urged.

Alexander met her gaze but said nothing.

"Think it over, Alexander. I'm giving you a chance to reconsider.You'll only hurt yourself if you follow through," Lilly said.

Did she think it was easy for him to let her do this?

"I wouldn't be here if I hadn't considered it thoroughly," Alexander said.

Lilly withdrew her hands and gave him one last look before turning and starting her climb up the mountain without another word.

Alexander took a few steps forward but stopped, his fists clenched. He didn't want to do this, but his pride prevented him from backing down after warning her not to act against his wishes.
###Chapter 81

"Max."

"Yes,sir?"

"Is everything prepared?"

"Yes, sir. Her audio is live, and we're able totrack her movements."

"What about the camera I instructed you to attach to her backpack?"

"I installed that too, sir. It's online now, and you can watch and listen to her actions through the tablet." Max handed the tablet to his superior.

He powered it on and began watching the footage, noting that she was already approaching the base of the mountain. Max noticed the concern on his boss's face. Everyone was aware of how much he cared for his wife,making this decision especially difficult for him.

Alexander remained near the forest, intending to stay close to her. He settled inside the vehicle, observing her progress. Seven hours had passed since she started the climb, and from the sound of her breathing, he could tell how exhausted she was."You could take a break," he muttered to himself, as though she could hear him. She had been walking for hours without resting, and her legs must have been aching by now. He checked how far she had left before reaching the other side of the mountain and saw that she was stilI far from halfway. Worry gnawed at him, his heart leaping each time she almost stumbled. Did he make a mistake in choosing this punishment? He began to regret his decision, but it was too late to turn back now.Lost in his thoughts, he didn't realize when the live feed and audio cut off. When he finally focused back on the tablet, there was no image or sound.Alexander checked the connection, but everything appeared to be in working order. So why couldn't he see or hear her anymore?

His anxiety spiked, and he immediately called out, "Max!"

"Yes, sir," Max responded, rushing over.

"What happened to the audio and video feed?"

"Sir, the weather is calm; there shouldn't be any interference."

"Then why isn't the video or audio working?" Alexander was becoming increasingly agitated.

"I'll fix it right away, sir."
0
Max hurried to check the antenna, but it was functioning properly,which could only mean one thing: either the devices had been disconnected, or they were damaged. But how was he going to tell his boss that?

Alexander exited the car and approached the team. "Have you resolved the issue? Don't you realize she's out there all alone?"

"Sir..." Max hesitated, fear evident in his voice.

Alexander's concern for anything related to his wife was well-known,and now that they'd lost contact with her, Max knew he was in serious trouble.

"Speak!" Alexander demanded, his patience thinning. "Sir, we've lost the signal. The antenna is still working, so it likely means the audio and video equipment on the backpack was damaged or destroyed." Alexander's face paled, his heart pounding in fear of what might have happened to her. In a sudden fit of rage, he grabbed Max by the throat,squeezing as Max struggled for air. But as Alexander realized that if anything happened to her, the blame rested on him, not Max, he released his grip, leaving Max gasping on the ground. The other guards backed away in fear, not wanting to be the next target.

"Should we head up there to search for her?" one of the bodyguards cautiously suggested.

"Get the helicopter here, now!" Alexander commanded,cursing himself for letting his pride and anger push him to this point. They could have gone home together peacefully, but now his actions had led to this crisis.

A few guards immediately drove off to retrieve the helicopter from one of their bases. Alexander gazed anxiously up the mountain.She had climbed far, and if he attempted to scale it himself, he wouldn't reach her in time.His mind raced with fears of what might have befallen her-perhaps she had slipped and taken a hard fall, given how often she had nearly stumbled. The possibilities tormented him, driving him to the brink of madness.

When Ethan heard about the situation, he rushed over with the helicopter.He couldn't believe Alexander had subjected the woman he loved to such a harsh ordeal. He knew what Alexander was capable of, but he never imagined that Lilly would experience the brunt of his ruthlessness. Alexander looked up as the helicopter arrived, the noise of its blades slicing through the air. He walked toward it, bracing against the strong winds generated by the rotors. Max straightened up and trailed closely behind his boss. Alexander climbed into the helicopter, fastening his seatbelt and putting on a helmet. "What were you thinking?" Ethan shouted over the helicopter's roar.

What had he been thinking? Alexander asked himself the same question.

"You left her to tackle that mountain alone. Ifsomething happens to her,she'll never forgive you, and neither will Viola if anything happens to her mother."


"Just get us moving!" Alexander yelled back. Did Ethan think he wasn't already tortured by those thoughts? Losing his family wasn't an option.


Ethan piloted the helicopter to the top of the mountain, and they began their search for Lilly. They scoured the area until darkness fell.

"Alexander, she's nowhere to be found," Ethan said after they'd searched every possible spot with no sign of her.

"That can't be," Alexander shook his head in denial. His Lilly couldn't just vanish.


"Bring the helicopter down," he ordered.

"Alexander, it's too dark-"

"I said bring it down!" he snapped, his agitation growing.

Ethan complied, landing the helicopter on the mountainside. Alexander removed his helmet and unbuckled his seatbelt before stepping out. "Are you sure this is wise?" Ethan asked. "There might be caves in this mountain. She could have fallen into one and lost consciousness," Alexander speculated. Ethan considered this and nodded. "You might be right; we should continue searching."

"Get the men ready. Tell Max to assemble a team of about 200 to search this mountain immediately."


"I'll handle it." Ethan relayed the orders, and soon a large group of men was scouring the mountainside.


Alexander was right about the caves in the area, but none led them to Lilly.
If he combed this entire mnountain and didn't find her, he would lose his sanity. He would blame himself if anything terrible happened to her. What would he say to Viola if her mother wasn't found?

"Lilly, where are you? I'm sorry," he muttered, his voice thick with emotion. He searched the same cave repeatedly but found no trace of her.

"Lilly!" he called out, his voice echoing through the mountains.

He shouted her name over and over, but there was no answer. Ethan watched him sympathetically. "Why are you putting yourself through this?"Ethan asked.

Alexander suddenly remembered Lilly's warning that he would end up hurting himself, and she had been right-he was in agony.

Caleb was furious when he learned what had happened and immediately dispatched his men to join the search. He hadn't anticipated things spiraling out of control; otherwise, he would have intervened. Alexander sat on a large rock, staringblankly into the distance, wishing he could turn back time. His phone rang, and he quickly answered,hoping for good news. It was Viola. Hearing his daughter's voice made his heart ache even more. "Daddly," she said, her sweet voice making his chest tighten.

Alexander swallowed hard, trying to keep his emotions in check so she wouldn't sense anything was wrong. "Yes, darling?"

"Why aren't you home yet? You promised to read me a bedtime story since Mommy's away." Viola blinked her eyes and pouted.

Alexander forced a smile, knowing she was pouting. "I'm sorry,sweetheart.Daddy has some late work to finish and won't be back until tomorrow."

Viola sighed in disappointment. "But you promised," she said, her voice tinged with sadness.

Hearing her upset voice broke his heart. "Since Daddy broke his promise,
Daddy will let Viola decide his punishment. Does that sound fair?"

Viola perked up. "Any punishment?"

"Yes,darling."

"Okay," she said excitedly, already thinking of something.

Hearing her cheerful tone brought a small smile to his face. "Daddy needs to go now.Goodnight,sweetheart."

"Goodnight, Daddy. I love you."

"Daddy loves you too," Alexander replied before ending the call,sinking back into despair. If by tomorrow, Viola didn't see her mother, what would he tell her? It was already the next afternoon, and Lilly was still missing. Peter stormed over and punched Alexander in the face. "How could you do this?!" he shouted at Alexander,who stood motionless.

If it had been anyone else, Alexander wouldn't have stood there and taken the hit. Ethan was shocked-it was the first time he had seen his bosS receive a punch.

"And you allowed him to carry out this plan?!" Peter yelled at his father,who felt humiliated but remained silent, knowing he was also at fault.Had he stopped Alexander, none of this would have happened.

They had people searching the entire mountain and surrounding areas. If she wasn't on the mountain, it meant she had been taken.


Peter paced anxiously, realizing that he had always trusted his daughter's safety to Alexander, only to now discover that she wasn't even safe with her own husband.


Alexander wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth with a handkerchief. "If there's nothing else, I'll continue searching for her," he said, then left the mansion, got into his car, and sped off, ignoring his assistants who were calling after him.

He was on the verge of losing his mind. "Lilly, where are you?"
###Chapter 82
 to check on me, but she hasn't called. Doesn't she want to talk to me?" She looked at him with a sorrowful expression.

Running a hand through his hair, Alexander felt more lost than ever before.He had never been this unsure of what to say.

Viola didn't understand why her father was taking so long to reply.

After carefully considering his words, Alexander finally spoke,"Mommy is somewhere with a poor phone signal, which is why she hasn't been able to call. You know how much she loves you, and she would never miss calling you unless she couldn't."

Little Viola thought it over and then nodded. "Okay."

"Now eat up, and Daddy will read you a bedtime story," Alexander said.

Viola smiled, reassured. "Okay, Daddy," she said, picking up her spoon and starting to eat.

Alexander breathed a sigh of relief.

After dinner, he helped her brush her teeth, tucked her into bed, and read her a bedtime story.


Clara stood outside Viola's bedroom door, sighing quietly. She hoped the madam would be found soon and return home because her absence was weighing heavily on the boss, and it wouldn't be long before Viola felt the impact too. After ensuring Viola was asleep, Alexander kissed her forehead and left the room."Take good care of her. She won't be going to school tomorrow." "Yes, young master," Clara replied, bowing her head.

Alexander leftthe house afterward and met Ethan at one of their bases to discuss new strategies to find her.

"The only logical conclusion now is that she's been taken," Richard said.despite the tension between him and Alexander, knowing he had to support him during Lilly's disappearance.

"Who would dare take her without leaving a trace? Alexander is the most powerful man in the underworld. No one would risk provoking him,"Ethan added.


“I'm just saying we have to consider every possibility. What do you think,Alexander? Do you agree with me?" Richard asked, turning to their friend,who appeared utterly devastated.


Ethan and Richard watched their friend, who looked like his entire world had collapsed.


Suddenly, Ethan had a thought. Given their widespread connections,if someone had taken her, they would have uncovered it by now. If she was injured, perhaps someone from a nearby village had found her,but their men were searching those areas with no success. If she couldn't be found,maybe she was hiding on purpose, using this situation to punish Alexander. Pondering this, Ethan called ou1t,“Alexander?”

“What if Lilly doesn't want to be found?”he suggested. Alexander, who had been lost in thought, snapped his gaze to Ethan.“What are you implying?" “Could it be she left the mountain on her own and is staying hidden to make you regret sending her there?" Alexandler considered it but shook his head. "No, that's not possible.She didn't know I was taking her to the mountain. If she had left, she would have needed help, but she didn't know anyone or have any idea of what I had planned."

“I'm just suggesting we consider the possibility."

Alexander thought again but remained unconvinced. There was no way she could have known his plan.

Then he remembered Lilly had a friend who was a hacker-Jacob. With that thought. Alexander stood up and headed out of the office.

“Alexander, where are you going?" Richard called after him, but he received no reply.

"We should follow him before he does something reckless. He's not thinking straight right now," Ethan said, and the two hurried after him.

Alexander found Max, who was guarding outside.

“Boss,” Max greeted, bowing his head the moment he saw Alexander.

“Hand over your cell phone."

“Huh?”Max was confused. Why did his boss need his phone?

“Do it quíckly," Alexander ordered.

Max pulled out his phone and handed it to him without hesitation. “The password?” Max unlocked the phone and handed it back.
"Did you delete our conversation about the mountain?"

“No.Boss.”

Alexander nodded and headed back inside the base.

Max was still bewildered, not understanding why his phone was taken. As a loyal guard, he had nothing to hide, but he worried he might be in trouble.

Richard and Ethan observed, equally puzzled, but followed Alexander to see what he was up to.

Alexander entered one of their computer rooms and handed the phone to their hackers.

“Check if this phone has been compromised."

“Right away, Boss," the hackers replied, immediately getting to work.

"Alexander, what's going on? You know Max is loyal, right?" Ethan asked,thinking Alexander might be doubting his right-hand man.

“I'm aware.”

"Then why do this?”

“You suggested Lilly might be hiding from me, so I'm checking if Jacob hacked Max's phone to get information about what I planned." “Oh,”Ethan said, nodding in understanding. But he was surprised by how quickly Alexander had put the pieces together. Richard was equally stunned but waited silently to see what would happen."If it turns out you're right, what do you plan to do?" Ethan asked.Would Alexander let it go, or would he make her regret her actions?

“Before you decide anything, remember that this all started because you tried to punish her," Richard reminded him, wanting Alexander to acknowledge his role in the situation.


Alexander sat on the couch, silent, his expression unreadable, leaving Richard and Ethan unsure of what he was thinking.




Meanwhile, Lilly was comfortably settled in front of a television, enjoying an action movie with a large bowl of popcorn and a glass of juice,completely unbothered by her husband's frantic search for her.

Jacob was keeping her updated on Alexander's efforts to find her.According to him, her husband might turn the entire city upside down if he didn't find her soon.


After this, Alexander wouldn't dare try to punish her again. Who orders their loving wife to climb a mountain for hours? Even the seven hours she endured felt like a death sentence.


Lilly had gone hiking before, but this was different; the mountain was treacherous. Her legs had ached terribly, and if Jacob and Michael hadn't arrived in time to get her out, she might have passed out. She was still amazed at how they managed to find a way to climb the mountain and rescue her, Jacob had tracked her location by hacking into Alexander's systems. Occasionally,she glanced at her phone, waiting for Alexander to call. She knew it wouldn't be long before he figured out who might be helping her and reached out to either Jacob, Michael, or Sarah, confident they were in on it. When he did, she would give him a piece of her mind.

She had already told Sarah to give Alexander her new number so he could contact her.

Lilly hated resorting to these measures, but if she didn't, Alexander would continue to think it was acceptable to punish her as he pleased.Despite everything, she missed him terribly-his cuddles at night,his kisses all over her body. She couldn't wait for this to be over so she could return home to him and their daughter, Viola, whom she also missed dearly. She was sure Alexander had told Viola she was on a trip so she wouldn't worry about where her mother was.

Currently, Lilly was staying at a resort about three hours away from the city. The resort was small, luxurious, and discreet, hidden from public view,with its location not even marked on any map. Only the wealthiest of the wealthy seeking seclusion stayed there. Alexander was aware of such places but would have no idea which one she was at unless she told him.

After a few hours, her phone rang, and she smiled,seeing that it was him calling.
###Chapter 83

"Boss, based on what we've uncovered, it's clear the phone was hacked.but the hacker can't be traced,"

Alexander immediately stood up upon hearing this. So, Lilly had known about his plans all along but pretended she didn't?

He clenched his fist. "Max!"

"Yes, boss?" Max quickly entered the room.He had been following closely behind to see what Alexander intended to do with his phone.

"Bring Jacob and Michael here immediately! They must know where she is!"


"Right away,boss."

"Wait," Richard interrupted, stopping Max from leaving.

Alexander shot him a deadly glare. "What do you think you're doing?"


"Calm down,Alexander."

"Calm down? They helped her leave that mountain; they know where she is!" "You know how stubborn those two are. They won't tell you anything.even if you threaten them. You've never gotten along with them, and they don't like you either," Ethan pointed out. Matthew and Michael were fiercely loyal to Lilly. "So what should I do?" Alexander asked, desperate to get his wife back.Her grandfather and father had given him onlya few days to find her,and now Viola was starting to suspect something wasn't right.

"Think about it-Sarah is the only one you get along with. She'll tell you where Lilly is," Richard suggested.

"How do I know she even knows where Lilly is?"

"Because there's no way Lilly would plan something like this and leave Sarah out of it. I'm sureshe knows," Richard replied, and Ethan nodded in agreement.

"All you have to do is ask Sarah-politely," Richard emphasized the"politely," knowing Alexander's usual demeanor.

"Since we're done here, I'll be leaving," Ethan said, turning to go.


"Where are you going?" Alexander demånded.

Ethan gave him a surprised look. "Have you forgotten that I also have a multimillion-dollar company to run?" Alexander had gotten so used to having Ethan around whenever he needed him that he'd forgotten Ethan was the CEO of the Lawrence group of companies.

"Can you blame me? You never seem like someone who's busy,"Alexander remarked dryly.

"I agree," Richard added, nodding. "But how you manage to run your family empire so smoothly and win multiple contracts surprises me."

Ethan smiled. "Seems you've forgotten who you're talking to." "Remind me," Richard said, knowing full well that Ethan was just as sharp as Alexander. But while Alexander juggled three empires-the Kane Corporation, his family's company, and his underworld dealings-Ethan had only one.

Richard was grateful he only had to manage his family's hospitals, which was stressful enough.

"Before I go, good luck gettingLilly back," Ethan said, then left.

"I'll be going too. But please, don't make another mistake. She might do something drastic again," Richard warned before leaving.

After they were gone, Alexander called Sarah. She wasn't expecting his call so soon, but Lilly had predicted he'd find out she left of her own accord.

She answered the call, holding the phone to her ear. "Sarah."

Hearing his voice made her nervous. Even after knowing Alexander for three years as her friend's husband, he still intimidated her.

"Alexander."

"You know why I'm calling,right?"

"Why did you call?"

"Don't play games with me. Tell me where Lilly is, now!" His voice was authoritative.


Sarah didn't like his tone, but she knew who she was dealing with.He wasn't someone she could talk back to. "Lilly didn't give me her location,so I don't know where she is." She was telling the truth; Lilly hadn't shared her location, only her new phone number. "You can't be serious. She must have contacted you when she left." "She did." "Then give me her contact."

"I'll send it." Sarah hung up and sent him the number. She was at work and didn't want to continue the conversation.


Alexander checked his messages and saw the number. He left the room,grabbed his car keys, and headed out.

His bodyguards tried to follow, but he told them he was going alone.He got into his sports car and drove out to the main road, dialing Lilly's number as he went.

When Lilly saw the call, she smiled and let it ring for a while before answering. "Hello," she greeted first.

Alexander pulled his car to the side of theroad.Hearing her voice brought him back to life; he'd felt like a walking dead man until now. His racing heart finally calmed.

"Lilly, where are you?" Alexander asked, surprised by his own calmness.

Lilly was taken aback by how calm he was. She expected him to be shouting but instead, he was composed, which made her smile.

"Somewhere."

"Where? Tell me the location so I can pick you up and bring you home.Viola is asking about you." "Then tell her I went on a trip. Isn't that what you told her before taking me to that mountain?" Alexander was silent. "She hasn't heard from you, so she's starting to suspect." Lilly couldn't believe how calm he was. She hadn't expected this from him.Maybe she had really scared him.

"When you get home, call me back so she can hear my voice. Or better yet.give her my number so she can call me whenever she wants."

Alexander frowned. Was she planning on not coming home?

"You don't want to come home to me?"

"Not yet. I'm still relaxing," Lilly yawned, testing his patience.

"Lilly!" He shouted, his anger finally showing. "Give me your location now!"he ordered.

"This conversation is over," she said, ending the call.
0
She started counting, and in less than ten seconds, he called back. She picked up, "Alexander."

"You hung up on me?"

"Why did you raise your voice? I'll only respond to you if you speak calmly."

Alexander forced himself to stay calm. "Okay, fine. I'm sorry."

She smiled at his apology. "Okay."

"Can you please just tell me your location?" "What if I'm not ready to come home?" Alexander was silentfor a moment, choosing his words carefully. "Then I'Il stay there with you." Lilly hadn't expected him to say that.

"Lilly Blake, haven't you succeeded in turning me into a love-struck fool?"

Lilly was stunned by his statement. Had she really done that?

Seeing she was speechless, he continued, "I won't return home without you."

"You plan on leaving Viola at home alone?"

"I'll take her with me to find you." As he spoke, he had people tracking her location.


"Alexander, you won't find this place unless I tell you." She knew what he was doing.
0
Lilly hung up after saying that, wanting to show him that he could lose her for good if he mistreated her.

Alexander called again, but she didn't pick up. He called several more tímes,growing more agitated each time.

He dialed a different number. "Did you get her location?"

"No, sir. Her location is unknown."

"Didn't you check where the call signal is coming from?"Alexander shouted.


"We did, sir, but it's showing as outer space," the person on the other end replied nervously.

"Outer space?" "Yes, sir. When a call location shows outer space, it means it's untraceable."

Alexander ended the call and was lost in thought. Wherever she was,it wasn't on any map.

She was right--he wouldn't know where she was unless she told him. He had truly underestimated his wife.

He called her again and was relieved when she picked up. He had thought carefully about what to say. He'd wanted to punísh her, but now she was making it clear that if he treated her poorly, she'd leave, and he'd never find her again.

Lilly saw his call. It had been ten minutes since their last conversation, so she was sure he'd figured out he couldn't locate her.

She answered to hear what he had to say.

"Okay, I get it. I'm sorry for what I did. I shouldn't have treated you that way. Please forgive me and come back home."

Lilly remained silent.

"I promise it won't happen again," Alexander added.

Lilly smiled, pleased that he'd admitted his wrongdoing.

"Apology accepted."

Alexander sighed in relief. "Tell me your location."

"Ocean resort," she said then hung up.

Alexander couldn't believe it. He hadn't thought of searching hidden resorts. So that's where she was? He got back in his car and drove to the location, not caring about the distance.


Llly started packing, knowing he'd arrive in about three hours.

Three Hours Later

A gentle knock came on her room door, and she rushed to open it,knowing it was Alexander. The receptionist had already informed her.

Lilly opened the door, and before she could say a word, he hugged her tightly.

Alexander hugged her, inhaling her scent. "God, I've missed you." He had been terrified when he couIdn't find her.

He pulled back to look her over, making sure she was okay before hugging her again. "Please don't disappear on me again, okay?"

Lilly nodded. "I won't."

"Everyone was worried, especially me. I can't bear to lose you," Alexander said,gazing into her eyes before kissing her on the lips and then her forehead.


Lilly kissed him back,having missed his kisses.

People in the rooms across from them smiled at the couple. "They're so in love," a woman said to her friend. "Yes, they are." "They look familiar, though." "Don't you know them?" "Who are they?"

"Alexander Kane and Lilly Blake."

Her friend gasped. "Oh my God. I can't believe it's them."

Lilly smiled as she hugged Alexander. If anyone had told her she'd make Alexander love her this much,she wouldn't have believed it.
###Chapter 84

"Haha ha ha ha ha ha," Caleb laughed heartily when he heard what his granddaughter did. It never crossed his mind that she would do such a thing, but it was clever of her, and he felt proud seeing how she taught her husband a lesson. If he ever tried something funny with her,she would leave him. Although Caleb hadn't stopped Alexander from doing what he wanted, after finding out that he had sent his daughter to climb a mountain for hours, Caleb became furious and thought of ways to deal with the young man.

However, there would be no need for him to handle it, since his granddaughter had already done so. Every time she did something like this, Caleb felt more assured that he made the right choice in making her the heir to the family business. With the lesson she taught her husband,he wouldn't dare try something like that again. She had shown him that if he treated her love as worthless, she would leave. This was how she would make good decisions in business as well.

"Father, did you hear the news?" Peter walked into the study room.

"Yes, Victor just told me that Lilly has been found, and it was all her doing. She taught her husband a good lesson," Caleb said proudly.

"Really? Is that all you have to say about the fact that she put everyone in a panic?" Peter couldn't believe his father.


Caleb looked at his son. "Yes, we were all afraid and worried that something bad had happened to her."


"And what about the part where you planned to retaliate? You were ready to attack your enemies, thinking they took your granddaughter. It seems you don't realize the kind of problems her disappearance would have  caused."

Caleb looked at his son with a calm expression. "Which is why she showed up after a day, because she didn't want any of that to happen. If Lilly was thoughtless,she would have stayed hidden for days, but she knew what that would cause."

Peter walked out of the study and went to the garden to call Lilly.

Lilly was driving back home with Alexander when she got a call from her father. Victor must have given him her new number since she had just finished talking to him.

"Father."

"What were you thinking, Lilly? Did you know how worried we were?"

"I'm sorry, Father, that I made you worried, but it's all over now."

Peter sighed. "I just hope this will be the first and last time.You should know how your grandfather is and also how Alexander handles issues.Those men can be very ruthless. Just imagine how the whole city would have turned upside down if you hadn't shown up. A lot of people would have been affected."What her father said was true: a lot of people would have been affected if Alexander had decided to handle things more drastically. She looked at Alexander, who was driving with all his attention on the road. "I'm sorry,Father. There won't be a second time."Peter sighed. "Please take care." "I will." Lilly hung up the call.Alexander didn't say anything regarding the call and just kept on driving.

They arrived home, and she went straight to Viola's room.

Viola was busy doingher homework with the help of her nanny when the room door was pushed open.

Her eyes went to the door, and she jumped up from her seat when she saw her mother.

"Mummy!!" she shouted excitedly as she ran to hug her mother.

Lilly picked her up and swung her around. "I missed my baby so much."

"I missed you too,Mummy."

Lilly planted kisses all over her face.

Viola jumped happily in her mother's arms. "Mummy," she looked at her mother.


"Yes,baby?"

"Can you please stop going on trips?" she said, revealing what had been on her mind for a long time.


Lilly nodded. "No more trips, baby, no more. Mummy is going to be here every day to read you bedtime stories. And if we ever go on a trip, it will be you, me, and Daddy together."Viola jumped happily and kissed her mother's forehead. "Yay! I love you,Mummy!" "Mummy loves you too."Alexander stood close to the door and smiled at both of them. These two people were his everything, and he didn't want to lose either of them. He was ready to kill anyone who dared to hurt them.

The following day, the family of three had breakfast, and Alexander left first since he had a lot of meetings to attend in two branches of the company and was launching a new product.

Lilly and Viola left later, as she was going to drop Viola at school before heading to the office.

Other kids and parents who came to drop their children at school stared at the luxury car that drove into the school premises. They immediately knew the owner of the car since she was the only person who drove it in the whole city.

Alexander was very particular about cars, which is why he made sure that the car Lilly drove and the car that took Viola to school were the only ones of their kind in the entire country. This way, his wife and child would stand out from others.


The car stopped, and the bodyguard opened the back seat. Lilly stepped out first, and the other mothers who came to drop off their kids were in awe of her beauty. This wasn't the first time they had seen her, but every time they did, they were always astonished because she just got more beautiful and enchanting with each passing day, which explained why Alexander didn't joke about her. Lilly helped her daughter get down from the car by holding her small hands. Viola got down and smiled adorably at her mother. "Thank you, Mummy." 
"You're welcome."

"Awww, she's so polite," other parents admired her, which made their kids frown.Why would their parents admire another child instead of them?

Lilly kissed her on the cheek and on her forehead before handing her over to her teacher.


"Bye,Mummy."

"Bye, my baby. I will come to pick you up when you finish school."

"Okay." Viola was so happy; she couldn't wait to go to her mother's company after school.

Lilly stood there and waited for her to get to the school building before turning to get into the car. That was when one of the socialite women who came to drop off her kid at school suddenly approached her.

"Good morning, Mrs. Kane," she greeted, making Lilly turn and look at her. "Good morning," Lilly replied but didn't recognize who she was. Since returning to Country A and marrying Alexander, she hadn't mingled or hung out with other socialites because she knew how they behaved.Although she couldn't place the woman standing in front of her, from the way she dressed and her temperament, Lilly knew she was one of those socialite women who always gossip and spread false rumors in her circle of friends. "It's Mrs. Wilson," she smiled as she proudly called her husband's last name. Her husband's family owned chain stores around the country,so they were very rich and popular among the elites. She expected Lilly to know her husband's last name since she was someone in the business world and must have done business with him before, but the casual look on Lilly's face told her otherwise.

Lilly tried to recall the name, maybe she had heard it somewhere, but it didn't ring a bell. "Hi, Mrs. Wilson, is there anything I can do for you?"she asked politely.

Mrs. Wilson was disappointed but smiled to cover it up. "My chíld also attends this school and is in the same class as yours, so I was hoping we could get along, maybe hang out one of these days. What do you think?"she asked, anticipating her response.

Lilly smiled. "As much as I would love to hang out, I can't because I am busy with so many things. You should know I run a company and how stressful it is. I don't have time for things like that since I'm too busy."

Mrs. Wilson frowned inwardly. Was Lilly trying to say she was jobless?She scoffed inwardly. She didn't think Mrs. Kane could be this proud.Although she came from a wealthy family and married into another rich one, what made her think she could act this way? She thought to herself and scoffed.


"Alright then," she pulled out her card and handed it to Lilly. "This is my business card. My number is there, so you can call me or come to my restaurant just in case you change your mind." Lilly looked at the card and smiled. "Okay then, I will leave now." Mrs.Wilson had given her the card to show that she wasn't jobless and ran an expensive restaurant. Lilly shook her head and smiled at her attitude. Lilly got into the car, and the driver reversed before driving out of the school premises. Mrs. Wilson stood and watched as the car drove off, then frowned."Such a bitch." The truth was that almost all the young ladies in the elite world hated Lilly when they heard she was married to Alexander. Before they got married, they had all wanted to be Alexander's wife by any means necessary, doing all sorts of things to get his attention. They even debated among themselves who would win his heart. Alexander was the most sought-after bachelor at that time, so much so that some planned to drug him just to get into his bed. But the man was too tough and difficult,and he disliked every one of them, leading them to conclude he must be homosexual-until they heard the news that he was married on the day of the Lawrence family's head birthday party three years ago.

Mrs. Wilson just wanted to get close to Lilly since doing so would benefit her and her husband in business.


As soon as Lilly's car was seen driving out of the school premises, another car was parked a short distance

away from the school.

Inside the vehicle sat a woman with a scarf and glasses on. Her eyes were fixed on the school with a deadly look on her face.

"Ma'am, are you sure we can do this today?"

"Today is the day. It has to be today," the young lady said. "Alexander Kane's people are scattered everywhere; they're all around this place. Do you think we will succeed in taking the child? " The young lady gave her subordinate a cold look. "Yes, this is something we have been planning for two years now, and today is just perfect.Yesterday would have been more ideal sincehe was busy looking for Lilly, but the man was too smart not to have sent his daughter to school yesterday. So it has to be today, and today it shall be," she said with all seriousness.

The only way to get back at them was to take what was most precious to them-their precious child.
###Chapter 85

Six hours later, as school let out, parents arrived to pick up their children.Viola eagerly prepared to leave, excited to join her mother at work. She aspired to be just like her, a confident and capable businesswoman.

Ms. Amster noticed her enthusiasm and smiled, asking if she was ready to go. Viola quickly confirmed. Ms. Amster, always cautious, personally escorted Viola to ensure that the right person picked her up. Given Viola's powerful parents, any mistake could cost Ms. Amster her job and possibly even lead to the school's closure. Although she cared for all her students,she was particularly vigilant with Viola, not out of favoritism, but out of fear of the consequences if something went wrong, especially considering Viola's father's reputation.

"Alright, hold my hand," Ms. Amster instructed, and Viola gladly did so,eager to leave. Howeyer, they were interrupted by another teacher, Mr.Harold, who usually taught a dlifferent class.

"Mr. Harold, what are you doing here? I thought you had left?" Ms.Amster asked.


"I was about to, but the principal called me back. She mentioned a couple who want to enroll their child in your class, and she asked to see you," Mr.Harold replied, glancing at Viola. Ms. Amster was puzzled. Who enrolls their child at the end of the school day? Such things are usually handled in the morning or at the beginning of a term. However, thinking that Viola's mother must already be waiting,she decided to drop Viola off first. "I'll take Viola to her mother and then see the principal," Ms. Amster said.But Mr. Harold insisted, "The principal is about to leave, and the couple is in a hurry. I can take Viola to her mother for you."

Ms. Amster hesitated, feeling uneasy, but after some back and forth, she reluctantly agreed. As Ms. Amster handed Viola over, she couldn't shake a feeling of dread. Viola didn't seem to like Mr. Harold much either and looked disappointed as they parted.

"Come on, Viola, it's time to go," Mr. Harold said with a smirk, leading Viola away. As they neared the exit, Viola spotted her mother waiting outside and smiled, but her mother couldn't see her through the tinted glass.

"Why aren't we going to my mommy?" Viola asked,confused.

Mr. Harold bent down to Viola's level, his voice dripping with malice. "This will be the last time you see your mother," he said, smirking. Viola,alarmed, tried to bite him, but before she could react further, Mr. Harold injected something into her arm, causing Viola to pass out. Just before losing consciousness. Viola caught a glimpse of her mother and whispered,"Mummy," as tears filled her eyes.

Mr. Harold then carried Viola through a hidden exit,leaving the school unnoticed. He had taken the teaching job a year ago, all for this moment.

Meanwhile,Lilly anxiously checked her watch. Fifteen minutes had passed since she'd been standing outside, waiting for Viola. The delay was unusual, and with each passing minute,her impatience grew.

Finally, Ms. Amster emerged, but Viola was not with her. Panic set in as Lilly rushed toward her.

"Good morning. Mrs. Kane," Ms. Amster greeted her nervously. 
"Where is Viola?" Lilly demanded, skipping the pleasantries.

Ms. Amster froze in shock. "Viola? I... I sent her with another teacher to meet you."

"What teacher? I haven't seen anyone with Viola," Lilly said, her voice filled with rising fear.

Ms. Amster's heart sank. She had handed Viola over to Mr. Harold,trusting him due to his year of service at the school. But now, Lilly's panic confirmed that something had gone terribly wrong.

"Where is this teacher?" Lilly demanded again.

"He was supposed to bring Viola to you," Ms. Amster stammered,trembling.

Without waiting for more explanations, Lilly marched into the school.shouting for Viola as she searched every corner, Samuel and Pedro trailing behind her. But there was no sign of Viola or Mr. Harold.

When Samuel and Pedro informed their boss of Víola's disappearance,Lilly was beyond furious. She slapped Ms. Amster in a fit of rage.screaming, "You had one job, and you failed!"

Ms. Amster wept, filled with regret and fear for the consequences. Where could Mr. Harold have taken Viola? Lilly, desperate and terrified, called Jacob, her voice shaking with tears."Jacob, Viola is missing," she sobbed. Jacob and Michael were stunned. Viola had been taken, but by whom? As the news spread, Alexander, who had been away on a business trip, immediately canceled all his meetings and took a private jet back.Enraged and desperate, he made several calls, mobilizing the police, the army,and his personal security team to find his daughter.

James,hisassistant. handed him the information on Mr. Harold. It turned out that he was an orphan and an ex-convict who had forged his identity to get the teaching job.

Alexander's anger knew no bounds. "Shut down the school permanently!"he ordered, and within minutes, the school was closed by the education minister, with no protest from the families, given the seriousness of the situation.


As the city was thrown into chaos over Viola's disappearance, every available resource was used to search for her. But despite all efforts,it was clear that the kidnappers had planned this meticulously, leaving no trace behind.
###Chapter 86

The entire news media, both on television and online,was abuzz with the story of Viola's abduction, making it the day's top headline. Picturesof Viola and her kidnapper, Harlord, were everywhere, accompanied by a generous reward offer for anyone who could provide information leading to their capture. The disappearance of Viola quickly became the concern of not just the city but also surrounding areas.

People were shocked and wondered who would have the audacity to kidnap Alexander Kane's daughter. They were confident, however, that whoever was behind it would be caught, given Alexander's extensive influence.

In a concealed hideout on the outskirts of the city, a woman sat in a chair.watching the news coverage with a smug expression.

"Tsk, tsk," she muttered, glancing over at Viola, who was fast asleep on a nearby bed.“Your parents are going out of their minds searching for you,little princess. If only they knew they won't find you unless we decide otherwise," she said with a chuckle.

The sedative they had given Viola kept her in a deep sleep, and she wouldn't wake until the mnorning. The woman was pleased with how their plan was unfolding. By morning, Alexander and Lilly would be fraintic.and soon enough, they would understand exactly who they were dealing with. This scheme had been in the works for two years, and everything was going according to plan.

************
Night had fallen, but no one had left the school where Viola was last seen.Everyone stayed close to Lilly, who had been crying and refusing to leave the cold floor. Peter watched his daughter with growing concern.

As soon as Alexander landed, he rushed to the school.

“Alexander, you're here at last," Ethan said upon seeing him.

"Where's Lilly?" Alexander asked, his eyes searching the area.

“She's in Viola's classroom. She hasn't left the floor since it happened."

Alexander hurried into the school building and made his way to Viola's classroom, where he found Lilly sitting on the cold floor, crying.

Seeing her like this broke his heart. He knew one of them had to be strong.and it had to be him. As much as Viola's kidnapping tore him apart, he knew he had to hold it together for both of them.

Alexander walked over to her and sat down beside her on the floor.

Lilly looked up and saw that it was Alexander.

“Alexander," she whispered.

He pulled her into his-arms, gently rubbing her back. “I promise you, I will find her," he vowed.

“But what if they hurt her? I won't be able to bear it," she said through her tears.


“They won't dare. They've kidnapped her, which means they have a purpose. Sooner or later, they'll make contact, and we'll trace them." “But what if they're somewhere you can't trace?" Lilly asked, recalling how she once hid from him, and he couldn't find her. Alexander understood what she meant. “This time, I will find them. I'll track them down no matter where they are in the world, I promise. I have a contact,someone who can locate anyone, anywhere. I almost called him when you disappeared, but I didn't when I realized you were just hiding.But this time, I will use every resource at my disposal to find them," he assured her.


Lilly nodded and hugged him back, seeking warmth from his embrace.though her tears continued to fall.

"The floor is cold, my love. You'll get sick,Alexander said gently.

"I don't care."

"If you get sick, how will you help look for Viola? She won't be happy to return to a mother who's unwell.”


Hearing this, Lilly immediately stood up. Alexander was right-Viola would be heartbroken to come back to a sick mother.

Alexander sighed in relief when she finally stood. Her grandfather and everyone else had been trying to get her off the floor, but she had refused,insisting she would stay there until Viola was found.


“Let's go home and rest," Alexander suggested.

"No," Lilly shook her head. "I can't go home, not while Viola is missing."

Alexander knew he couldn't convince her to go home, but he had to get her out of the cold. "Alright, let's at least get into the car so you can warm up.”


Lilly resisted, insisting on staying, but Alexander gently picked her up,noticing she was barefoot, and carried her to the car. Despite her protests, he placed her inside and joined her.

"Let me out, Alexander," she pleaded, but he shook his head.

"No,you're freezing. You need to warm up," he said softly.He knew he had to stay composed to take care of her.

"Drive to the other estate," he instructed the chauffeur.

As the car drove away from the school, those who had stayed behind were relieved that Alexander had managed to get Lilly to leave.

Caleb, feeling the weight of the situation, decided to head to the police station.“Take me to the station," he instructed James, who quickly got the car ready.


Peter, sensing his father's determinatioń, insisted on going with him.“I'm coming with you," he said, knowing they were headed to interrogate the school staff.


Caleb nodded, and they both got into the car and left.

Grandma Helen, whose health had been deteriorating, had already gone home.

Outside the school, reporters wereeager to cover the story. As Alexander's car drove out, they rushed to get a statement, but the tinted windows concealed who was inside. Alexander directed the chauffeur to drive to one of their newer estates,a futuristic development constructed by his company. The estate's design featured sleek lines and bold geometric shapes, creating a visually striking aesthetic inspired by nature, technology, and contemporary art. The car stopped in front of the largest mansion in the estate, set apart from the others. Alexander got out first and then carried Lilly inside. As they approached the front door, the lights automatically illuminated, and Alexander used his fingerprint to unlock the door.

Lilly rested her head on Alexander's chest, her thoughts consumed by worry for Viola. Was her daughter okay? Were they treating her well? Was she cold? She was only three years old, and the thought of her daughter suffering broke Lilly's heart.


Alexander had planned to bring both Viola and Lilly to this house,but now he was glad he'd decided to bring Lilly here first. He used the elevator to take them to the second floor, where the calming atmosphere of the room might help her relax.


He placed Lilly on the bed and lay down beside her, wrapping his arms around her. The room was warm, thanks to the heater, and Alexander hoped it would provide some comfort.

"We can't just stay here, Alexander. Viola is missing. We should be out there looking for her," Lilly protested.

"We aren't just sitting idle. We're waiting for news from the hackers who are trying to trace the kidnapper,” Alexander reassured her. “You're freezing. I want you to warm up and eat something."

“No," she shook her head. "I need to be out there searching for Viola."

"And we will," Alexander promised. Lilly moved away from his embrace and looked at him with determination. “Promise me that when you find them, you'll let me be there, and you'll let me take care of them myself," she demanded. Alexander didn't want her to take such a dark path, but he knew she wouldn't relent. He couldn't deny her now, even though he didn't want her to follow through with it.

“Lilly," he began, but she interrupted him.

"No, Alexander. Promise me," she insisted.

Seeing the pain in her eyes, Alexander reluctantly nodded. "I promise,"he said, knowing it was a promise he would struggle to keep.

Satisfied,Lilly snuggled back into his arms, resting her head on his chest. “You need to eat something," he urged again.

Lilly nodded, realizing she needed to stay strong for her daughter, even if she didn't feel like eating.

Alexander stood up. "Stay here, okay?"he said.

Lilly agreed, and Alexander left the room to go to the kitchen downstairs.He had made sure the fridge was stocked before they arrived. Alexander quíckly prepared some porridge and was about to head back upstairs when his phone rang.

Seeing that it was James, he answered immediately. “Any news?”

"Yes,boss," James replied."We found out that Harlord served five years in prison before being released two years ago. During her time in prison,she was cellmates with Kate, and they were very close."“Kate?” Alexander repeated, surprised. He had kept a close watch on Kate and her mother since they were imprisoned. Two years ago,he had them separated,placing Kate in one prison and her mother in a more secure facility. “Yes,boss,"James confirmed.

Alexander was stunned. Could Kate have orchestrated this from prison?But how? There had been no reports of her escaping.

"I want you to verify if Kate is still in prison and to find out if she's had any significant outside contact," Alexander ordered.

“Right away, boss."James replied.

Alexander ended the call and turned around, only to fnd Lilly standing there with raised eyebrows. She must have overheard part of the conversation, and the last thing he wanted was for her to worry about Kate as well.

“Did I hear you mention Kate?” Lilly asked, her tone sharp.

Alexander couldn't deny it. “Yes,” he admitted.

Lilly walked closer, her expression hardening. “Is she involved in this? If she is, I'll handle her myself.”

"We don't know yet, but we're looking into it,” Alexander replied cautiously.

Lilly wasn't going to take any chances.

“Let me handle her," she demanded. “No,” Alexander said firmly. “This is my fighat, and I won't let you get involved.” But Lilly refused to back down. “This is about our daughter, and I will handle whoever is involved in her kidnapping.” The steel in her voice made it clear that she wouldn't be swayed.
###Chapter 87

"I have to see her in jail and confront her."

“No.”

"I need to look her in the eye and ask if she had anything to do with Viola's kidnapping," tears streamed down her face.


Kate despised her and always wanted to be in Alexander's life. If anyone would do this, it would be either her or her mother.


“I've already reached out to that friend of mine. He'll track them down eventually; there's no need for a confrontation."

“How can we be sure he'll find them in time? I need to find my daughter quickly. and if confronting Kate in prison might lead to answers, I'm willing to do it," she declared. A mother's desperation for her child knows no bounds; she would go to any lengths for her daughter. Alexander understood this and could see her desperation, so he knew the only option was to let her proceed. Otherwise, she might act behind his back, and he didn't want that.

“Alright.we can go tomorrow."

Lilly hugged him. "Thank you.”

The next morning, they prepared and headed to the prison,which was about four hours from the city. It would be a long journey. Alexander made occasional calls about any updates, but there was nothing.He realized that confronting Kate might indeed be the best course of action. Meanwhile, in one of Caleb's hideouts, two women were bound with ropes-Amster and the principal. Caleb had taken it upon himself to bring them there and extract the truth from them. He wasn't taking any chances;his great-granddaughter had to be found.

Peter supported his father's actions because his granddaughter was involved.

Caleb picked up a hot blade and approached Amster.

“Please, no, I beg you," Amster cried. “I don't know anything!"

She screamed as the blade was pressed against her skin. The pain was excruciating, and it would surely leave a scar. Caleb continued the torture,and when he got nothing from her, he moved on to the next person and did the same.


Peter couldn't bear to watch any longer, so he left the room. Caleb continued until both women passed out.

Caleb had been informed that Lilly and Alexander were on their way to confront Kate in prison. If it turned out that Kate was involved, he wouldn't hesitate to kill her, even if she was his granddaughter. Bella would be another person he intended to eliminate, as she was surely involved as well. When Sarah heard what had happened, she took the next available flight to H City to be with Lilly during this crucial time. It had been difficult to get permission from her superiors at work, but she explained that she was a friend of Lilly Kane, and their child had been kidnapped. Her superiors allowed her to go, knowing the significance of her connections. Lilly received a message from Sarah.Sarah: "I just landed." Lilly:"Okay."

Sarah:"Where are you?"

Lilly: "I'm on my way to the prison to see Kate."

Sarah: "The prison? Why? Is there something I don't know about?"

Lilly: "Yes, we found out that Harlord was Kate's cellmate before she was released. We're going there to see if she had anything to do with Viola's disappearance."

Sarah: "Really?"

Lilly: "Yes."

Sarah: "Please be careful. I'm glad Alexander is with you."

Lilly:"I will."

Sarah: "I'll just head to Jacob and Micheal to see if I can help."

Lilly: "Thanks."

Lilly logged out and leaned her head against the car window as they drove to the prison. They were about two hours away from the city, with another two hours to gobefore reaching the prison. Alexander's heart ached seeing her like this. He was in as much pain as she was. The absence of their daughter shattered him; he missed his little girl terribly. But seeing Lilly like this made his heart break even more.What he wanted most was for their family to be whole again. Alexander moved her away from the window and held her close to him. Lilly rested her head on his chest. "Who were you chatting with?"

"Sarah,"she replied.

“What did she say?"


"She's here in Aurora City. She's going to meet with Jacob and Micheal to see what she can do to help.”

“Okay,” Alexander said, kissing her forehead.

An hour before reaching the prison, both Alexander's and Lilly's phones started ringing. Lilly was asleep at first, but the sound of the phone woke her up.


Alexander checked his phone and saw that James was calling. At the same time,Ethan's call came in as well.

Lilly received a call from Jacob. She decided not to answer and let Alexander take his cal first. It felt strange that their phones rang simultaneously.

“You should answer Ethan's call.”

Alexander answered and put the call on speaker.

“Alexander, where are you?” From Ethan's tone, they knew the news wasn't good.

Lilly's heart skipped a beat, fearing the worst. Had something bad happened to her daughter? Had the kidnappers done something to her? Seeing how scared Lilly was, Alexander considered taking the call off speaker to talk to Ethan privately, but Lilly stopped him. "Let me hear what he has to say," she pleaded.

Alexander sighed. “Ethan, what happened?"

"Are you on your way to the prison right now?"

“Yes.”

"I just received information that some inmates escaped from prison an hour ago, and there's no trace of them."

Alexander and Lilly exchanged glances.

Lilly immediately thought of Kate.

“Ethan,did they reveal who escaped?”

“Yes, and Kate was one of them."

Lilly looked at Alexander.

"Where are you now,Ethan?”

"I just left the office. I was planning to come to you."

"I'll meet you at the base," Alexander said, ending the call. He was shocked that Kate and the others had managed to escape. Aside fromn the prison'ssecurity, he had his own people guarding it as well.

"Turn the car around and head to the base," Alexander instructed.Jack turned the car around and headed back to the base. Lilly was lost in thought, trying to connect the dots. First,her daughter was kidnapped, and now Kate had escaped. She wondered if the two were related. Alexander held her close. Now that Kate had escaped, Lilly wasn't safe either, "Don't worry; they'll catch her."

Their problems had just doubled. Now they had two urgent matters to deal with: finding their daughter and locating Kate before she could do something terrible.


Lilly's phone rang again. She checked the callerID but saw an unknown number.

Alexander noticed too. The number looked strange.

Lilly immediately answeredand put the call on speaker, thinking it might be the kidnappers calling about Viola.

The person on the other end remained silent.

When the caller didn't speak, Lilly decided to break the silence.

“Who is this?”

The person chuckled.

“Take a guess.”

Lilly's face turned pale at the sound of the voice. Even after so many years,she would never forget that voice.

Alexander couldn't recognize it, but from Lilly's expression, he knew she had an idea who it was. “Kate?” “Hah! Hahaha!” Kate laughed loudly, Alexander frowned.

"You're good at guessing. Too bad I had to escape before you could visit me in prison."

How did she know they were coming to the prison?

"Kate,where are you?"

"Somewhere you'll never find me," Kate said coldly. "Do you know how long I've been planning thisescape?"

"We'll find you, and when we do, you're dead," Alexander said.

Hearing Alexander's voice made Kate pause. She hadn't expected him to be with Lilly. She had thought Lilly would come alone to see her in prison.She had really missed his voice-a man she had wished to have but couldn't because Lilly had taken him from her. She hated Lilly with all her heart, and part of her escape plan was to kill her. Even if she couldn't have Alexander in the end, she would be satisfied knowing that Lilly didn't get her happily ever after.

“Kate?”Lilly called when she noticed the silence. "Kate, go back to prison,or I'll make sure you get a death sentence this time," Lilly threatened, and she meant it.

Kate couldn't hold back her laughter. "Are you sure you want me back in prison? Because if I do, it'll be over for someone you care about." Alexander frowned at the statement. His people were already tracking the call. Lilly didn't understand what shemeant."What do you mean?" Kate smiled as she walked towards the child sitting on the bed, softly crying.

"Tsk tsk tsk. Guess what? Escaping from prison wasn'tthe only thing I've been planning for the past two years. Want to know what else I succeeded in?”


"What are you saying?" Lilly clenched her fists.

"Hold on." Kate moved the phone away from her ear and placed it near Viola, who was crying.

"Say hello to your mommy."

Alexander and Lilly's faces turned pale at Kate's words. Tears welled up in Lilly's eyes. and she gripped the phone tightly.

"Mummy!” Viola cried, calling out for her mother.

Lilly covered her mouth in shock. It was really her daughter-her worst fears had come true.


“Viola!"she muttered.

"Viola!" Alexander called, equally shocked. He couldn't believe it-Kate had planned all this.

Viola heard her father's voice, which made her cry even more.“Daddy,Mommy!"she wept. The place was terrifying, filled with scary people. Lilly burst into tears. Kate placed the phone back to her ear and smiled in satisfaction when she heard Lily crying. "You should cry more because this is just the beginning.”“Please leave her alone; she is just a child," Lily pleaded.

Kate smiled. "Stay tuned and wait for my call. I'll send the location soon,but before that, you have to decide between her life or your own."

Even if she had to die, Lily would do anything to save her child. She knew that Kate's real target was her.


"Just send the location. I'm ready to give my life for that of my child,"Lily declared.


Kate smiled. “Brave of you," she said, then frowned.“But I don't plan on making your death easy. It will be slow and painful.”

###Chapter 88

“I won't make your end easy, Lily. It will be prolonged and excruciating."Kate declared with a sinister grin.

“Just promise me you'lllet her go," Lily insisted.

“I can't promise that because we're not close. Guess what?" Kate said.

“What?”Lily asked.

“I have another surprise for you. I have an accomplice who wants to see Alexander's downfall. Start guessing until my next call. Bye for now," Kate replied. “Goodbye," Kate said, cutting the call.
"Wait!” Liy shouted, but the line was already dead. Despite not desiring Alexander's ruin since she cared for him, Lily had to agree to the plan because she needed the support and resources of the person behind it to escape confinement and execute her scheme. They had agreed to stay out of each other's plans; Lily was her target, but Alexander was his.

Lily and Alexander exchanged shocked glances at Kate's revelation.Who could be plotting against Alexander?


Alexander could think of many potential enemies due to his numerous rivals.


"What are you talking about, Kate? Please, tell me!" Lily begged. It was one thing for Kate to target her, but the thought of Alexander being part of the scheme heightened herfear.
###Chapter 88
Kate smiled in satisfaction and sat on the bed. "Aww, even when you cry,you're so endearing, and so clever for your age," Kate remarked, though her expression turned to a frown.


Upon arriving at the hideout after escaping prison, she learned about the little girl's attempt to flee. The CCTV footage showed Lily's daughter trying to escape by reading the signs on the door. No one expected a three-year-old to be so literate and resourceful, underestimating her abilities.

Kate should have anticipated this, considering the child was the offspring of Alexander Kane and Lily Blake. After her failure to escape, the child cried, realizing her only chance was if her parents came to rescue her.

“Get out of my sight," Kate said sternly, wiping her own tears.She regretted showing her emotions during the call; it would only worry her parents more.

Kate was surprised. "Wow, you have your father's temperament. It's somewhat endearing to see a bit of him in you,” she said with a smile that soon shifted to anger. She seizedthe child roughly and dragged her closer.

"Let me go!" the child screamed, tears streaming down her face.

“Look at me," Kate demanded, lifting her chin. “If your mother doesn't come to save you, you're done for," she warned before shoving the child away.

Kate then approached Rosa, her trusted friend, who had been supporting her since her prison escape, before another ally joined her cause. "Rosa, I need you to stay here and monitor her. She's quite clever; if she escapes again, we might not catch her," Kate instructed. "I'll stay and watch over her. We're in this together. All I want is for you to get your revenge and then free your mother later," Rosa replied.

Kate smiled and hugged her. “What would I do without you? To think you've been financing this project... I don't know how to repay you."

"The only way you can repay me is by being happy," Rosa said.

Kate smiled and nodded. "I know Rosa cares deeply for her. After this, I'll make sure to repay her kindness."



************


The news of Kate's escape and her role in the child's kidnapping alarmed everyone. Caleb began reaching out to old allies for assistance, recognizing the need for all the help he could get.

Grandma Helen, weakened both physically and emotionally, had been praying at the temple since the child's disappearance.


Alexander's team struggled to locate Kate, increasing his anxiety. Despite becoming a powerful figure in the underworld, he had numerous enemies who desired his position. With his newfound vuInerabilities-Lily and their child Viola-his foes had seized an opportunity. The person aiding Kate must be among those wishing to bring him down. He was prepared to face their trap if it meant saving hisdaughter.

Alexander and Lily arrived at his underground headquarters,his most secretive base. Lily, seeing it for the first time, marveled at its size and the array of prison and torture equipment. “I like this place; it's enormous and has various kinds of equipment," she said. Her tears had ceased as she came to terms with her adversary. Alexander, having contacted his friend for assistance, prepared for their next steps.Although Lily was anxious for their child and Alexander's safety,Alexander was resolute to protect both.

He guided Lily to the changing room, filled with combat gear.He hadn't anticipated bringing her to this place, but they were preparing for battle.

Sarah,Jacob, and Michael had also arrived, ready to assist. It was a war,and they needed all the help they could get.

Lily chose the darkest, most formidable bodysuit with leather straps and a half-face mask from the options Alexander provided.

Alexander approved her choice. “Badass,” he said.

Lily managed a faint smile.

Alexander equipped her with a gun holster and loaded weapons.“They're all loaded. Shoot when necessary," he instructed.


Lily nodded, and Alexander fastened her bulletproof vest before she donned the bodysuit. Despite his precautions, he was anxious about her safety since she would confront Kate first.

“I'm really worried about your safety. I didn't think I'd ever feel this afraid," Alexander admitted.


Lily could see his anxiety mirrored her own. “I wish you didn't have to go;I'd rather handle it alone," she said."Not with Viola in their hands and their intent on taking me down. I can't stay idle," Lily responded. “Tonight is the night of battle. We must retrieve our child. We'll get Viola back," Alexander assured, embracing Lily tightly.

"We will get Viola back. I'll make sure of it," Alexandder promised.
 ###Chapter 89

Alexander kissed her forehead. "Everything will work out."

Lily nodded.

"Boss, she's calling." Max rushed into the dressing room to inform them.

Alexander and Lily followed him to the monitor room.

Lily's cell phone was handed to her, and she answered, placing it to her ear. Everyone stood close by in silence, able to hear the conversation as the phone was connected to a device that amplified it.

"Hello,Kate."

Kate smiled. "I appreciate your patience in waiting for my call."

"Justtell me the location. I don't have time for small talk."

Kate laughed. "You should lose the attituade. It won't end well for you if you don't," she warned.

Lily sighed. "I'm sorry,just tell me,please."

"That's better." Kate turned to glance at the man behind her,holding a glass of whiskey.

"Come to the forest on the eastern side of the city with Alexander only.When you arrive, I'll call you back," Kate said, then hung up.

"Forest?" Lily barely finished her thought before the call ended.

Lily looked at everyone.

"We heard," Ethan said. "She's clever. She expects you to come with just Alexander, but she didn't give an exact location to ensure you're alone before directing you further."

"From what I can see, there's no house in the forest," Jacob said,checking his system.

"You won't find one. It's underground, like this base," Alexander explained.

The others agreed.

"Makes sense," Michael added.

"Let's go, Lily. We'll take my sports car," Alexander said,holding her hand as they started out. He was suddenly so calm that it surprised everyone.

"Wait, you can't just go without a plan," Alexander said.

"And who says we don't have one?" Lily asked, meeting their gazes.

"We're getting our child back today, no matter what," she added.
 
No one in the room knew the plan they had made. Only Lily knew who Alexander had contacted to get Kate's location.Unbeknownst to them, beyond the hackers in the room trying to track the conversation with Kate, others had already pinpointed the location. But unlike their team, who hadn't succeeded, those people would be ready to strike once Alexander and Lily entered to face Kate and whoever else was after Alexander.Alexander and Lily left the base, got into the sports car, and sped off, heading east.

The sports car was so fast they arrived in just an hour.

After an hour, they reached the forest on the eastern side. They parked on the road and entered the forest, wearing boots to navigate faster.

When they ventured deeper into the woods. Lily's phone rang.

She answered immediately; there must be a camera somewhere watching them.

"Kate," Lily said.

"I like how you follow instructions," Kate said.

They had already checked the perimeter and confirmed Lily was with no one else except Alexander.

"Just tell me the exact spot."

"Calm down, you're too impatient."

"You can't expect me to be calm when my child is with you,can you?"

"Ha ha ha ha ha ha," Kate laughed loudly. "I love that you understand what I'm capable of."

"I do, so just tell me the exact place."

"You're eager to die, aren't you?" "If it means saving my child, then yes," Lily responded. Kate turned to look at Viola, who was listening to the conversation between Lily and her mother. "Guess who's listening, Viola. She wants to 
cry,hearing how much her mommy loves her."

"Viola," Lily called as tears rolled down her cheeks.

"Mummy," Viola said.

"Dad and I are coming, okay? Don't be scared," Alexander assured her.

"Okay, Daddy," Viola replied.

They both felt relieved knowing nothing had happened to their daughter.

"We both love you," Lily said.

"Someone is coming to guide you to the location, so wait there," Kate said.then hung up.

They waited for about 30 minutes before spotting a woman walking towards them. Lily recognized her immediately.

"She's the teacher who took Viola," Lily told Alexander.

"I know her," Alexander said.

Lily clenched her fists, wanting to hit her for daring to hand over her child to Kate.


"You'll have all the time in the world to deal with her later," Alexander assured Lily.

Harlord smiled when she reached them. "The power couple," she smirked. "How could you kidnap a child? You're a teacher." "The teaching job was just a way to get close to Viola so I could kidnap her when the time was right. You both were so protective of her that I had no choice but to teach at her school." Harlord said without a hint of remorse.

Alexander's face remained emotionless. If only they knew what he had planned for them by the end of the day.

Tears rolled down Lily's cheeks at her words.

"Just take us there," Alexander said calmly.

Harlord looked at him and smiled. "The mighty Alexander has suddenly become so calm. Who would have thought?" She smirked, as if she'd won a lottery by kidnapping the child of the most feared man in the city."It's true what they say-even the mighty fall," she added.

Alexander remained calm.

Lily wanted to say something, but Alexander stopped her.


"Let her be."

Harlord smiled, then turned around. "Follow me."

They followed her deeper into the forest until they reached a cave.

Harlord entered, and they followed her inside, using their lights in the darkness.

Harlord stopped suddenly, causing them to stop as well.

Lily wondered what was beneath this cave.

They watched as Harlord placed her hand on the wall to their right,which shifted,revealing an iron door with a smart lock.She typed in the password, which they couldn't see, and the door opened.

Lily concluded that whoever was helping and funding Kate must be very powerful.

Harlord stepped inside, and they followed. The door shut behind them.plunging the area into darkness.

"Lights on," Harlord said, and the lights flicked on, revealing a long passageway with many doors.

Alexander wondered what was behind all these doors, knowing his daughter was likely behind one of them.

Harlord began walking, and they followed her, passing many doors until they reached the last one in the middle of the passageway. It was large and tall.

Harlord knocked, and the door was unlocked and pushed open by someone inside.

They stepped into a large room. The floor was bare ground, covered in sand and stones.

They entered and saw men dressed in black standing at each corner,holding guns.

"Stand in the middle of the room," Harlord instructed, and they complied.Alexander held Lily's hand, and they stood at the center of the room,which resembled a large underground warehouse. Alexander scanned the entire area. A small door at the end opened, and their eyes snapped towards it. Kate walked out, smiling at them. "My guests have arrived," she said.taking a seat in a chair facing them, holding a shotgun in her hand.

Alexander and Lily hadn't brought their guns, knowing they'd be confiscated.

It had been over three years since Lily last saw Kate. She couldn't deny how much Kate had changed. Her grandfather had shaved off Bella and Kate's hair, and with the scars on their heads, it was impossible for their hair to grow fully. So, Kate's shoulder-length blondde hair was a wig.

"Hand over my child," Alexander said coldly.

Kate's eyes flicked towards him, her heart softening at his handsomeness.
He was as striking as ever. "I'll decide when you see her," she replied.

"If you give her to us and let us leave, I promise to let you live."

Kate laughed. "Let me live?" She frowned. "You're on my turf,so you should be begging me to let you live."

Alexander smiled.

Kate was startled by his smile. Alexander didn't smile often, so seeing it now meant he had a plan to get them out of there. But as she considered how secure the place was, she dismissed it asan empty threat.

"Who else is involved? You mentioned a surprise for me?" Lily asked.

 Kate smiled and nodded. "I did. He'lI be here soon," she smirked, eager to see Lily's reaction when she met the person who wanted her husband's downfall. They heard the large door behind them open. "Oh, he's here already," Kate said excitedly.

Lily and Alexander turned simuItaneously to see who it was.

Lily's eyes widened in shock when she saw who it was.

"Albert?"

Her ex-boyfriend Albert? She couldn't believe it.
###Chapter 90

For the past three years, she had no information about Albert and assumed he had returned to his home country. But now, here he stood,the very person funding Kate and her accomplice in their schemes.

“Albert,how...?”

"How am I here?" Albert interrupted.

Alexander had furrowed his brows the moment Albert entered the scene.Seeing Albert as the one plotting his downfall was not entirely unexpected.

"How could you, Albert? I can't recall doing anything wrong to you,nor has Alexander, to warrant this."

Albert erupted in laughter, loud and unrestrained, before abruptly stopping and fixing a stern look on Alexander.

“Didn't he tell you what he did?”

Lily's eyes darted between them. “What's he talking about, Alexander?”

Alexander tightened his grip on Lily. “Ignore him."

"Ignore me?!” Albert fumed. “Youa don't want her  to know how you nearly destroyed my life?!” He turned to Lily. "Did he not tell you how he ruined my business? After I approached him for a partnership that day you were there,my company started collapsing-all because of him!" Albert's voice shook with anger as he pointed accusingly at Alexander. Alexander stood unmoved by his words. Lily looked at Alexander, waiting for him to deny Albert's claims, but he remained silent.

Kate sat nearby, enjoying the unfolding drama.

"Your dear husband felt threatened by my sudden presence in Aurora City because I'm your ex. His jealousy consumed him, leading him to destroy my company, bleed it dry until it went under, and then ensure I left the country with nothing!”

Lily was shocked by what Albert had just revealed. She looked at Alexander, whose expression confirmed that what Albert said was true.Was it really jealousy that drove him to such lengths? She hadn't thought Alexander capable of that, especially since Albert had not made any inappropriate advances toward her-unless there was another reason.

“Alexander,is what he's saying true?"

“We'll discuss that later," he responded, turning his attention back to Albert. "Where is my daughter? Hand her over."

Albert frowned. "I advise you not to use that tone; you're on my turf."

Alexander smiled at the remark. “Seems like you want to be ruined again."

His words ignited a fiery rage in Albert.He clenched his fists so tightly that his nails dug into his skin. “When I'm done with you, you won't even have a tongue left to speak!" he threatened.Albert then turned to Kate. "Bring her out." Kate stood up, nodding. “It's about time," she said, clearly excited. This was the moment she had been waiting for-the moment to see fear and despair in Lily. 
Kate signaled to the men, and soon, little Viola was brought into the room.

Lily and Alexander smiled upon seeing their daughter.

“Mummy! Daddy!" Viola cried out, struggling to break free from the person holding her, but she couldn't, and soon, tears began to flow.

“Viola, don't cry. We'll be out of here soon, okay? Daddy and I will take you out of here soon," Lily reassured her.

Hearing her mother's voice, Viola stopped crying and wiped away her tears,trusting that her parents would take her home soon.

Alexander felt a sense of relief seeing his daughter, even though he wasn't holding her yet. It was only a matter of time before all of this was over.

“Aww, what a touching mother-daughter moment," Kate mocked before turning serious. “Move her to the center," she ordered, and the person holding Viola placed her in the middle of the room,not far from where Lily and Alexander were standing.

Viola was set down on the floor, and the person who had been holding her moved away.

Seeing this, Lily instinctively wanted to rush to her daughter and pick her up, but the sudden sound of a gunshot froze her in place. She looked towards Viola, fearing the worst, but felt a wave of relief when she saw that Viola was unharmed, though she was crying. Who was shot? Lily wondered, her heart racing. She quickly turned around,and her world shattered. “Alexander!” Lily screamed when she saw that Alexander had been shot in his right leg. He made no sound, enduring the pain in silence, his attention focused on Lily and Viola, who were both crying. Seeing them like this hurt him more than the wound.


Lily was about to rush to his side, but the sound of a second gunshot stopped her in her tracks. Her heart pounded in fear.

Who was shot this time? She was looking at Alexander, so it wasn't him.Slowly, she turned, dread filling her, and saw a gun pointed at Viola's head,her mouth now covered with tape.


“She was crying too much, so I had to quiet her," Kate said,her voice dripping with malice. "If I were you, I wouldn't move from that spot. If you do,one of them will die."

Lily looked between Alexander and Viola, seeing Viola trembling in fear while Alexander appeared calm, though she knew he was in pain from the shot. If they didn't treat him soon, the wound could become infected.

“Alexander...”

"I'm fine," he assured her.

"It'll get infected," Lily said,tears streaming down her face.

“Relax, trust me,” he urged her.

Understanding his meaning,she tried to calm herself. “Viola, don't be afraid, okay? Remember what Daddy taught you,"Alexander said to his daughter. Viola nodded. Despite being so young, she understood the situation she was in. Her father had always prepared her for dangerous situations and taught her not to be paralyzed by fear.

“Aww, what a beautiful family," Albert finally spokeafter watching in silence.“I love how you all support each other, but how long can that last?”


"Kate, let's move on to the next stage." Albert said.

“Your wish is my command," Kate replied with a mocking laugh.

“You both have lost your minds,"'Lily said.

“I've certainly lost mine,” Kate agreed with a grin.

"But I haven't," Albert said. “Anyone in my position would seek justice."

"You call this justice?!” Lily shouted.

“Yes.”

“Alexander never shot you in the foot!"

"I enjoy seeing him suffer! After this, he'll face more torture, and then I'll make sure he signs all his wealth over to me. He'll be left with nothing!"Albert declared, his face twisted with rage.

“You still have a chance to stop, Albert, and I'll forgive you."
 
Albert laughed. “There's no turning back now." “Kate, you can end this. I promise I won't take your life; I'll just send you back to prison. But if you continue, and by any chance I survive this,I'll make sure you're dead," Lily threatened, her tone deadly serious.Albert expected Kate to laugh as usual, but instead, he saw fear in her eyes. Was Kate now afraid of Lily? He remembered Kate as the ruthless and wicked stepsister.


Kate remained silent, recognizing the seriousness in Lily's eyes. But how could Lily kill her when she was the one destined to die first?

Kate's fear was quickly replaced by confidence as she recalled the traps she had set for Lily. Lily wouldn't survive.

“Open the floor!" Kate shouted.

A subordinate pressed a button on the wall, and the ground beneath Lily began to shift.

"What the hell...”

“Lily!!" Alexander wanted to rush to her aid but was stopped.

“Take one more step, and I'll blow her head off," Kate threatened,pointing a gun at Lily.

Alexander couldn't move. He watched in horror as the ground around Lily opened up, leaving her stranded on a narrow ledge. She looked down and saw a deep, dark pit below, sending a shiver down her spine. One wrong move, and she would fall in.

Alexander felt terrified for her. What was her stepsister planning? "My love,look at me, don't look down.”


Lily heard his voice and turned her gaze towards him. "Stay calm and don't move, okay?” She nodded, then glanced at Viola, who was still crying. "What now?" she asked Kate.

"I like how you're always ready for the next challenge." Kate said with a smile."Now we move on to the fun part."

She turned to her subordinates."Turn it on." she ordered, and another button was pressed.

The ground beneath Lily began to heat up, and before she could fully grasp what was happening.flames erupted from below.

Fire encircled her, trapping her in place with no escape.

Lily was stunned, completely unprepared for this. She looked around.but the fire blocked her view of Alexander and Viola. The heat was unbearable.like she was in hell.

"Lily! Lily!" She heard Alexander calling her name.

Was this how she would die? The thought crossed her mind as she closed her eyes, clenched her fists, and tried to endure the intense heat.

###Chapter 91

Lilly's situation was critical. Flames surrounded her, casting sinister shadows on her frightened face. The thick smoke engulfed her, making it difficult to breathe as her lungs struggled with the toxic fumes.Her clothes were scorched and torn, her skin reddened and blistered from the searing heat.


Amidst the chaos, the menacing laughter of her stepsister echoed through the blaze, a haunting reminder of the betrayal that had led to this horrifying moment.

Outside the inferno, Alexander's desperate cries pierced the night, his voice filled with anguish and terror. Their child, Viola, called out for her mother,her innocent voice trembling with fear.

Lilly's body felt as though it was being consumed by the flames, each passing second more excruciating than the last. She knew her chances of survival were slipping away, and a sense of helplessness overwhelmed her as she braced for the worst.

Was this the end for her? She had steeled herself for death, but not like this-not without saying goodbye to the people she loved,to Alexander.the love of her life, and to their child, Viola. Sweat poured down Lilly's face from the intense heat,her breath growing shallow as her vision blurred. Hot tears streamed down her cheeks as thoughts of the two people she cherished most flooded her mind.What would become of them once she was gone? Suddenly, she heard faint, terrifying screams. She could no longer hear Alexander's voice calling her name, nor Viola's cries, and the silence terrified her. Had something terrible happened to them? The memory of Alexander's leg wound filled her with dread.

"Alexander! Viola!" she tried to shout, but her voice cracked, and she coughed from the thick smoke. The screams continued,growing fainter.until they felt distant, almost as if they were coming from within her mind.She heard multiple voices, screams mingled with Alexander's pleading for her to stay with him.

The last thing she saw before losing consciousness was the blurred image of Alexander's worried face, tears rolling down her cheeks as she passed out.

Alexander quickly lifted her and carried her out of the blaze, rushing her to the medical van brought by the rescue team. He placed her gently on the bed inside the van.

"Sir!" the medic exclaimed.

"She's unconscious and struggling to breathe. Make sure she's okay,without any complications. Do you understand me?" Alexander's voice was sharp with urgency, causing the doctor to shrink back in fear.

"Y-yes, sir. I will make sure she's fine," the doctor stammered.

Alexander fixed the doctor with a warning glare. "Do everything you can,or you'll be among those who won't survive the night." Alexander meant every word. He would ensure that those who hurt Lilly and their child would pay, and their bodies would be sent back to their families.The doctor trembled, his dark gaze leaving him shaking uncontrollably. "I...will...make sure," the doctor stammered again. Alexander took one last look at Lilly, his heart aching at the sight of her like this. The thought of her trapped in that fire made him clench his fists.His world had nearly collapsed when the flames surrounded her,and he had been ready to dive into the fire to save her. But at that moment,his friend arrived with his men, and they managed to extinguish the flames.

All of Albert and Kate's men were killed, and Alexander made sure Albert.Kate, and the teacher who dared to take Viola were taken to his underground base, where they awaited their fate.

"I promise they'll all pay. Just get well soon, for us," he whispered to the unconscious Lilly, kissing her forehead before leaving the medical van.

"Sir, you're bleeding, and it looks like the wound is infected," the doctor noted, unable to ignore the bullet wound.
し
Alexander looked down at his injured leg, almost forgetting he had been shot. His mind had been entirely consumed with thoughts of Lilly and their child.


"Focus on her, not me."

"But sir, it could worsen to the point where you might lose the use of your leg," the doctor reminded him. "I'll have one of my subordinates treat it while I tend to your wife," the doctor offered.


Alexander nodded, allowing them to treat his leg. They took him to another van to care for his wound. Michael and the others arrived at the forest, where the underground base was hidden. The area was swarming with vehicles and men dressed in black. They spotted a man exuding authority, much like Alexander,giving orders to some of the men, who addressed him as "Sir" and bowed in respect.

Richard and Ethan exchanged glances, wondering who this man was.
They hadn't seen him before,so who could he be?

They only became aware of Alexander's plan a few hours ago when Max called to inform them that Viola had been rescued, prompting them to rush to this location. But the sight of the army here puzzled them-was this man someone Alexander had contacted?

"Aren't you curious?" Ethan asked.

"I am," Richard replied.

"Then let's find out who this friend of his is," Ethan suggested, starting towards the man, with Richard following closely behind.

Sarah's first priority upon arriving was to find Lilly and Viola.She spotted Viola first, sleeping in the arms of a young woman she didn't recognize.

"Viola," Sarah said, approaching the woman holding her.

The woman with red hair looked at Sarah with curiosity, and Sarah returned the look.


"Who are you?"

"Who are you?"

They spoke in unison. "You go first," the red-haired woman said. "I'm Sarah, Lilly's close friend, and you're holding her daughter, Viola,"Sarah explained, pointing to the sleeping child. The red-haired woman nodded. "I've heard of you. I'm Juliana, Antony's right-hand woman. Since Alexander and Lilly are both injured, I was asked to look after Viola."


"Alexander and Lilly are hurt?" Sarah asked, her voice laced with shock and concern. "Where is Lilly?"

"She's in the medical van over there," Juliana replied, pointing to the van.

Sarah nodded and was about to leave, but stopped and looked at Juliana. "Did you say you're Antony's right-hand woman?" Her heart pounded as she asked, hoping it wasn't who she thought. It had been five years.


"Yes."


"Where is he? Show me," her heart raced.

"Over there, talking to those two men," Juliana pointed towards Antony.

Sarah slowly turned to look in the direction. Her heart skipped a beat when she recognized him-Antony, the man she knew from five years ago in country C. It was him, in the flesh. The same man she hadn't been able to forget, even after all these years. The same handsome and dangerous figure.

He stood a short distance away,conversing with Richard and Ethan. That cold look on his face hadn't changed; he still never smiled. Sarah stood there, staring at him. He must have felt her gaze because he immediately turned to look at her, their eyes meeting. She quickly averted her gaze from his sharp eyes, turning around and hurrying towards the medical van. Her whole body trembled from his gaze, her heart pounding uncontrollably.She couldn't stay in the same space as him; she wouldn't be able to bear it. She had thought she'd forgotten about him completely, but she hadn't.

Wiping away the tears that escaped, Sarah approached the medical van.

"You can't go in," the two guards standing outside the van told her.

"I'm Sarah, Lilly's friend. I need to see her."

"Let her in," Alexander's voice commanded.

The guards stepped aside, and she entered the spacious medical van.

"Alexander, what happened to you, and what happened in there?" Sarah asked, walking over to him and looking at his bandaged foot.

"A discussion for later."

Sarah nodded. "Where's Lilly?" She looked around but didn't see her.

"The next van."

"Okay, I'll go check on her," Sarah said, turning to leave,but Alexander called her back.


"Sarah."


′′Yes?′′ "Stay with her until she wakes up, and even after she does, don't let her out of your sight. If she does, you won't like what I'll do to you,"Alexander warned. Sarah swallowed nervously, not because of what Alexander might do, but because of the other person. She planned to leave after making sure Lilly was okay; she didn't want to be anywhere near Antony-he wouldn't leave her alone. Now that Alexander had asked her to stay with Lilly,it meant she'd have to face Antony.

"Did you hear me?" Alexander asked coldly when she didn't respond.

Sarah nodded. "I did. I won't leave her side and will make sure she doesn'
t leave mine."

"Good,you can go."

Sarah left the van and headed towards the next one when a hand suddenly grabbed her, dragging her back. She winced in pain from the forceful pull. After regaining her balance, she looked up to see who had grabbed her, and right in front of her stood Antony.

He stared at her with a dark expression.

Sarah swallowed hard and took a step back,but he moved closer.

She tried to retreat again.

"If you take another step back, I'll cut off your legs and see if you can run from me again," he threatened, his voice filled with anger.

Sarah dared not move again. If he said he would cut off her legs,he meant it.
###Chapter 92

Five years ago, when she left him. Antony had become obsessed with finding her. Despite his expertise in tracking down people no matter how well they hide, he couldn't locate the woman he loved deeply. Sarah had concealed herself perfectly, fully aware of his abilities after being with him for two years. She knew exactly how to stay hidden from him.

Now, here she was, standing before him, more stunning than ever. There was no chance he would let her slip away again. Coming to Country A turned out to be the best decision he had made, and he owed Alexander for it since it led him to his lost love.

After a prolonged silence where they simply gazed at each other, Antony finally spoke.

"I'm relieved to find you here, Sarah," he said softly.

"Antony,what do you want?" she asked.

"What do I want? Is that what you say to someone you haven't seen in five years, someone you ran away from?" The pain of her leaving still stung every time he recalled it.

Sarah bit her lip. "It's been five years, let's just move on..."

"Quiet!" Antony interrupted, his voice raised.
"In the last five years, were you able to move on? So why should I?"Antony asked. "I have moved on. I have a good jobas a detective in G City."Michael wanted to step in to protect Sarah from Antony but was stopped by Jacob. "I don't care; you need to come home with me,Sarah.""Why are you holding me back?"

"What exactly do you think you're going to do?"

"Can't you see how he's yelling at her?" Michael said.

"Can't you see that they clearly know each other?" Jacob replied.

Michael looked at the two, "Okay, they seem familiar with each other, but how does she know someone like him?"

"We'll find out, but for now, let's just observe."

"What if he does something to her? Aren't you worried about that?"

"He won't. Look beyond the anger; there's concern in his eyes, like he's hurt."

Michael studied Antony closely, but all he saw was anger. "I don't see it,just anger."

"Well, I do. He cares about her. They must have a history. Antony is similar to Alexander; hard to read, but deeply caring."

"So now you're a psychologist?"

"No,just good at seeing what others miss."

Michael nodded. "Alright then, let's stay close in case anything happens." "Home? What home? Did we ever have one?"

Antony's face grew cold. "Yes, we did, and it's time for you to return!"

"Your home, with all your family members-do you call that our home?"Sarah's eyes welled up as she thought about the past. She had lived on Antony's family estate, where,despite his own mansion, she constantly faced his family and their meddling in their relationship.

Antony moved closer, wiping away her tears. "Please, don't cry. I'm sorry."

"You're sorry?"

"Yes. I'm sorry I didn'tsee what was happening then." Sarah stepped back from him. "I need to take care of Lilly, so leave me alone," she said.turning and walking away.

Antony watched her go, determined never to lose her again.

Sarah entered Lilly's medical van, making sure her tears were gone before she did. She approached Lilly, who lay unconscious on the bed,tended by a nurse.


"Ma'am, you're not supposed to be here," the nurse said.

"I was told to look after her."

"Okay, if you say so. I'll leave now," the nurse said before exiting the vanSarah sat besíde Lilly, gazing at her pale face. "I don't know what you went through, but please wake up soon. There's something I need to tell you," she murmured. Meanwhile, Antony entered another van where Alexander was. "How's your injury?"

"It's fine."

"Good," Antony said as he sat across from him. "I need to thank you."

Alexander looked up. "For what?"

"For being here."

Alexander furrowed his brow. "I shouald be thanking you. If it weren't for your help. I'd have been burned alive trying to save Lilly from that fire. So.I should be thanking you, Antony," he said sincerely. He wasn't one to express gratitude, believing people should do their jobs, but this was different-this was about saving his family.

Antony was surprised by the heartfelt thanks but understood why. He had been shocked when he learned that Alexander had married and had a child. He never imagined that the cold-hearted man would settle down.

"But I'm glad you asked for my help. Coming here was the best decision I've made in years. If I hadn't come, I wouldn't have found her," Antony said.


"Found her?" Alexander knew who he meant-the woman Antony had been searching for the past five years. The one he loved and had wanted to marry before she left. If Alexander remembered correctly, her disappearance was the only thing that had ever broken Antony's heart. Alexander hadn't understood his pain then, but he did now, having experienced the same fear when Lilly disappeared in the mountains. "Is she here?" Alexander asked. "Yes," Antony nodded.

"Someone I know?"

"Yes, very close to your family, very close to Lilly."

Alexander thought for a moment and one name came to mind."You mean Sarah?"


"Yes."

"You mean Sarah is the woman who left you five years ago?"

"It's shocking, right? But yes, it's her."

"She's good at hiding," Alexander said. There was no one in the world Antony couldn't find-except Sarah.

"Yes, she is. She learned from the best," Antony smiled.

Alexander shook his head. "So, what are you going to do now?"

"What do you think? I'm taking her back to G City."

"Sarah is doing well here. She's a detective in G City. Would she want to leave,especially after what your family did to her?" Alexander asked.

He knew what had driven the woman away but never expected it to be Sarah. Antony clenched his fists. "I only found out what they did after she left. If I'd known sooner, I would have made sure she stayed. By now, we'd be married with children." His fists tightened. "I'm taking Sarah back. She'll wear the engagement ring I bought five years ago, and we'll marry as soon as possible."

"What if she doesn't want to?" Alexander might not have cared about Antony's plans, but Sarah was Lilly's friend.

Antony frowned, giving Alexander a stern look before leaning in. "Don't interfere in my business. Focus on your own family and getting justice for them. I'll take care of Sarah. Whether she likes it or not, she's coming back with me to G City tomorrow mnorning."

Alexander gave him an unreadable look before nodding. "Okay."

Antony stood up. "Thanks again. If it weren't for coming here, I wouldn't have found her. Tell Lilly I promise to take care of her friend and give her everything she deserves," he said before leaving the van.

Alexander only nodded and smiled. He wouldn't interfere because if he were in Antony's shoes, he'd do the same, crushing anyone who stood in the way of being with the one he loved.
###Chapter 93

Lilly stood frozen in terror as the blade advanced towards Alexander, the cold metal drawing nearer with each heartbeat. Her voice failed her,and her body refused to move as she desperately wished to intervene, but her limbs were paralyzed. She longed to throw herself in front of Alexander to shield him from Albert, but she was helpless.

The atmosphere was thick with fear and despair. The walls seemedto close in around her, trapping her in a nightmare. She couald only watch as Albert drove the blade into Alexander's heart, and right before her eyes,he collapsed to the floor,lifeless.

“Alexanderrrrr!!!" she screamed, bolting upright in bed, gasping for air.

“Lilly," Sarah, who was sitting nearby, rushed over to her.

"It's alright.," Sarah soothed, patting her back. “It was just a nightmare."

Lilly scanned the large hospital room and realized she had been dreaming.
"Where are Alexander and Viola?”

“Viola is sleeping in the room over there, and Alexander is at the base where Kate and the others were kept."

The hospital room had an adjacent space where visitors could sleep while watching over their loved ones. They had left the forest in the middle of the night and brought Lilly to the hospital. Although Alexander was told that Lilly didn't need hospitalization since she was already fine and just needed to wake up,he insisted on staying with her until she was fully recovered. He didn't want Viola to be separated from her mother, so he arranged for her to stay in the guest room within Lilly's hospital room.

Lilly tried to get up, but Sarah stopped her. "Relax, you just woke up."

"I need to see Viola and the others. We finally got Viola back."

Sarah could see the determination in Lilly's eyes for revenge.

“I know, but Alexander will be furious if I let you out of bed,"Sarah warned.

"Alright, but I need to see Viola." Lilly began to rise on her own but felt dizzy.

"Careful," Sarah said, helping her. “I'll take you to see her."

Lilly nodded.

They both went to the other room to see Viola.

Lilly sighed with relief when she saw her daughter sleeping peacefully,tears welling in her eyes. A wave of relief washed over her as she gazed at her now-safe daughter. Emotions surged as memories of the past flooded back, vividly recalling the heartbreaking moment when Kate had taken her daughter away.

But now, with her daughter safely by her side and Alexander unharmed.a fierce resolve grew within her. Lilly was determined to bring an end to Kate and Albert, and anyone else involved in the past events. The fire of justice burned brightly within her,and she was committed to ensuring no harm would come to her loved ones again. "I'm glad she's safe now and that you and Alexander are alright too. It's all over now." Barah sald.

Lilly kissed Viola's forehead before standing up from the bed on her own."It's not over unil they're all six feet under."she replied to Sarah,who nodded in agreement.

"But first, you need to get back to bed. P'll ask the doctor tocheck on you and let Alexander know that you're awake"

Lilly nodded,though she wanted to head straight to the base anid exact her revenge, knowing that Alexander wouldn't allow it until he was sure she had fully recovered.

In one of the base's torture rooms, the screams of Alexander's tormentors echoed loudly.

Alexander stood before Albert, whose entire bodly was already stained with blood. Alexander had already inflicted significant pain but was not satisfied until he finished him. Kate, on the other hand, had been severely tortured. He would wait until Lilly was out of the hospital to decide what to do with her sister, while he focused on dealing with Albert.

Alexander picked up the heated knife from the fire and brought it close to Albert, who stared at it in horror.

"I gave you the chance to let us go, but you refused. I warned you, didn't 1? There will be no mercy," Alexander said darkly, his expression causing Albert to tremble.Alexander placed the hot knife on Albert's chest, and he screamed in terror. Alexander left the knife on his chest, and Albert continued to scream in agony. Ethan entered the torture room and sighed at the scene of Alexander torturing Albert.

"He's too loud, Alexander. Just take the knife out of his chest so it's a bit quieter."

"Why are you here? I don't recall calling you," Alexander spoke harshly.

"I know, but I came to inform you that Sarah called from the hospital."

Alexander turned to him. "What did she say? Are Lilly and Viola alright?"he asked,worried.


“Relax, they're fine. She called to tell you that Lilly is awake and even wanted to come here, but Sarah had to stop her." Alexander sighed in relief. With everything that had happened in recent days, he couldn't help but worry about every little thing concerning Lilly and Viola.

"She also mentioned that her grandfather and father, along with your grandmother and a few others, are visiting her."


Alexander nodded. “Remove the knife from his chest and lock himin one of the cells. I'm going to the hospital." He left the torture room.

“But...why me?" Ethan muttered, staring at the knife in Albert's chest.

He felt nauseous just looking at the wounds on Albert's body. How was he supposed to do this?

On his way out of the base, Alexander met Antony outside. “Are you heading to the hospital?"

"Yes, I am. Lilly woke up." I'm coming with you." Antonysaid.

Alexander gave him a look. "I thought you were leaving today?"

“Not without Sarah.”

"So,you're coming to the hospital because of her?"

"Yes, and also tosay goodbye to your wife and child."

Alexander nodded and headed to his car, while Antony joined him, and they drove to the hospital.

"I'm so glad you're okay, my child,” Grandma Helen said, touching Lilly's forehead."I was so scared something would happen to Viola,you,and Alexander. I stayed up all night praying in the family temple for you to find Viola safe and sound, but then I heard what happened to you, and I was so distressed I had to remain in the temple and pray that you would be alright."

Lilly held her grandmother's hand and smiled warmly at her. “Thank you,Grandma, for staying in the temple and praying for us. I'm sorry for making you so worried-and letting all of this affect your health.”

"Silly child, my health is just fine."

Lilly knew the old woman was lying, but instead of arguing, she just smiled.“Okay,Grandma.”After Grandma left, she also spoke to her father, then Michael and Jacob came for a short while,followed by the others.Lilly glanced at her watch and frowned. She hated being stuck here instead of at the base. She looked towards the door when it opened and was disappointed to see Sarah entering.

"Not happy to see me? You must be bored of me already," Sarah pouted.

“Did you tell Alexander I woke up?"

“Yes, he's on his way here." Sarah said, looking at Viola, who was sleeping close to her mother in the spacious hospital bed. Since they got her back from Kate, all she had done was sleep, wake up to eat, and then sleep again. She hadn't said much since. The cheerful and lively Viola hadn't returned yet. Witnessing her father being shot and seeing a fire surrounding her mother, coupled with the horrific people who kidnapped her, must have shocked her to the core. Such an experience can deeply affect a child mentally.

Two psychologists had visited her, and both said the same thing: that she was a child going through a profound shock, which was why she wasn't talking much yet. But with time, she would return to her cheerful self.

“Did she eat all her food?”

Lilly nodded, then looked at Viola sitting close to her. She ran a hand through her hair and kissed her cheek.

The hospital door suddenly opened, and both Lilly and Sarah turned to see Alexander and Antony walk in. Alexander wasted no time approaching Lilly and hugging her tightly, as if his very soul depended on it. Lilly hugged him back, "Alexander..." "I'm sorry for not being here when you woke up, my love. I'm so relieved that youa and Viola are okay."

They kissed passionately, as if they hadn't seen each other for a long time.

Sarah glanced at Antony, who had been staring at her since he walked into the room.


“Don't you think we're interrupting them?" Antony said,looking at Alexander and Lilly, who were being so affectionate without caring if anyone else was present.


Sarah knew she should leave the loving couple alone, but she also knew that stepping outside the room would mean she'd have to talk to Antony.She looked at them and sighed before walking out of the VIP hospital room, with Antony following, a smirk on his face.

She walked a bit farther from the room and then sat on one of the benches in the corridor.

Antony sat on the same bench. "We're leaving first thing tomorrow morning.”

"I'm not going back there with you."

Antony raised her chin so she would look him in the eye.

“You're coming with me whether you like it or not, Sarah."

“You're going to take me with you against my will?”

Antony softened, running a hand through her hair, "Sarah, I love you so much, and I can't be with any other woman but you. I'm sorry I didn't know what was happening or how my family treated you. You could have told me, but you know I was hardly around.”
Sarah moved his hand away from her chin. "I'm not coming with you."

Antony clenched his fist. As much as he wanted to take her with him against her will, he knew that would only make her resent him more.
After calming his nerves to keep his patience, he then said,"Tell me what you want me to do to make things right, and I will-please."

Sarah looked him in the eye and saw his longing for her. Her heart still beat for him even after five years. Should she just go back with him and face everyone? She was the one who left, but here he was, begging her to come back.


"I'm not ready to go back yet," she said softly.

"Yet? Does that mean you'll give us a chance?" Antony asked, hope flickering in his eyes.

“It's been five years," she replied, uncertainty in her voice.

“It doesn't matter. I want you back, even if it's been twenty years,"Antony said earnestly, placing his hand on her cheek and giving her a gentle peck.
###Chapter 94

A day later, Peter arrived at one of the most secure prisons in Aurora City where Bella was held. Each step felt like a burden as he approached the formidable gates. After undergoing multiple security checks, he was finally allowed inside to visit Bella.

It had been three long years since Bella, his former wife, was incarcerated for the heinous crime of murdering his first wife and Lilly's sisters, as well as plotting against Lilly herself. Peter had sworn never to visit her,burdened by his grief and anger.

But recentevents had shaken him deeply. Kate had crossed a line that could not be ignored-she had kidnapped Viola, his granddaughter,thrusting both families into a nightmare of fear and despair. Peter had made the difficult decision to visit Bella after Lilly recounted everything that had happened in Kate's underground lair. Learning about what Lilly endured enraged him. If Alexander's friend hadn't arrived in time with his team, Lilly might have perished in that fire.

As Peter walked through the cold, sterile corridors of the prison, memories of the years he spent with Bella flooded his mind. Who could have imagined things would turn out this way?


Finally,he reached the visiting area, where Bella sat behind a thick glass barrier, dressed in an orange jumpsuit. She looked older than the last time he had seen her. When Bella raised her head and saw Peter, her eyes widened in shock.She wasn't expecting him, nor was she anticipating anyone to visit her. She had heard that Alexander had ordered no one to visit her, so when she was informed of a visitor, she was genuinely surprised and curious to see who it was. Their eyes met, and Peter stared at her for a moment before taking his seat.

He picked up the phone, taking a deep breath before speaking, his voice filled with a mix of anger and disappointment. "I vowed never to come here and see your face again, not after everything you did to my family.I was good to you, Bella. I cheated on my wife with you,letting down my entire family. From the moment I allowed you into the Blake residence,my once happy family was ruined. I was a fool and the worst father to my children. You murdered my wife, my two daughters, and even attempted to kill Lilly."

He clenched his fist as he spoke. "You poisoned Kate's mind, turning her against her own sister. In case you're unaware, Kae escaped from prison with outside help. And do you know what she did?"

Bella,who had been looking down, snapped her head up, eyes wide with shock upon hearing that Kate had escaped. Did it make her happy that her daughter had managed to flee? Yes, it did. She was resigned to dying in prison herself, but the thought of Kate spending her life there troubled her deeply. She felt a twisted pride that her daughter had escaped and hoped she would go far and live her life freely.

"Kate kidnapped Lilly's child and tried to kill Lilly again,as well as harm Alexander, all in the name of revenge."

Bella was stunned. She hadn't expected Kate to do that; she had hoped Kate wouId be smart enough to flee as far as possible. Kate should have known that going against Alexander would only lead to her death.

"Thankfully, she didn't succeed. Right now, Kate and her accomplices are locked up in one of Alexander's bases. This time, he plans to end her life for good. If she tries to escape, she will meet the same fate." Bella's eyes widened in shock. "No," she muttered,shaking her head and attempting to stand, but the female prison guard held her down.

Bella, who hadn't spoken untl now, quickly picked up the phone to speak to Peter. "Peter, please, I'm begging you-don't let them do it. I'm sorry for everything I've done. Please don't let Kate be killed."

Peter sighed. "There's nothing I can do, Lilly and Alexander have already made up their minds," he said solemnly.

"She's your daughter!" Bella cried out through the phone, foreing Peter to pull it away from his ear slightly.

Tears began to stream down her face, and Peter watched as she wept.

"Yes, she is my daughter. Do you think what Kate has done doesn't affect me? Of course it does. It breaks my heart to see her living this way. But do you really think there's anything I can do?"

"Yes, you can plead on her behalf! Are you really going to stand by and watch Lilly kill her own sister?" Bella implored.

Peter was taken aback. He couldn't bear the thought-they were sisters,after all, despite everything. But Kate was unrepentant, and if she were allowed to live, she would undoubtedly come back to harm Lilly and her family. "Please, Peter, do something. You're a father-how can you just stand by and watch her die?" Bella sobbed. Peter dropped the phone and stood up. He was filled with regret and remorse for everything that had happened in his family. If things were the way they were now, it was all his fault. If he hadn't cheated on his first wife with Bella, none of this would have happened. His two daughterswould stll be alive, and his first wife would stillbe with him.

Peter was about to leave but felt there was one last thing he needed to say.He picked up the phone again.

"T'm sorry, Bella. I'm sorry for ever meeting you all those years ago. If we had never met, things wouldn't have turned out this way, My family would still be whole, and you would have found someone else and had your own happy family. I will carry this regret with me untiI the day f die.
11

Bella listened to his words, tears streaming down her face.

As Peter walked away from the prison, he wondered if his words had made any difference. Bella might be locked up, but the wounds she had inflicted on their lives were still painfully fresh.

After leaving the prison, he headed straight to Alexander's base, where Lilly was. Even though Lilly wanted to end Kate's life, Peter was determined not to let her kill her own sister with her own hands.

At the base, Lilly stood a short distance from Kate,holding a shotgun aimed at Kate's head.
###Chapter 95

Alexander held the top of the gun that Lily was gripping. "Let go," she demanded, but he shook his head.
"Please, let me handle this. The last thing I want is for your hands to be tainted with this," Alexander urged.
"No,Alexander. I need to do this myself. She's my blood, and if anyone should be responsible, it should be..."
"It shouldn't be you," Peter said from behind, causing both Alexander and Lily to turn around.

Peter walked towards them until he was standing in front of them.

"Dad, what are you doing here?" Lily asked, surprised to see her father at the base. The last thing she wanted was for him to witness her taking Kate's life, given that Kate was still his daughter,despite everything.

Peter glanced at Kate, who was barely recognizable due to the torture she had endured. He averted his gaze, deeply affected by seeing his daughter in such a state. Peter turned back to Lily and Alexander. "You should listen to Alexander.Your hands should remain clean. If anyone has to end Kate's life,it certainly shouldn't be you, Lily. She's your blood, and though she may deserve her fate, you shouldn't carry that burden. If you do this,you'll never forget it; this day will haunt you forever." "I've already made up my mind, Father," Lily said,resolute. Peter stepped closer and gently took the gun from her hand. "You don't have to do this."Alexander observed the exchange, relieved that Peter was there to dissunde her. He would take care of things himself. He didn't want Lily to bear the weight of this act.

After convincing Lily to step back. Peter appronched Kate,who was fied to a chair nearby. She was so battered that her face was aimost unrecognizable.

"Kate," he called, and she slowly ralsed her head, wincing in pain. When she realized it was her father standing before her, she scoffed."What do you want?" she asked angrily, her father being the last person she wanted to see.

"I'm sorry for not being a good father," he said,his voice heavy with regret.

Kate was taken aback by his words.

"I'm sorry for not guiding you better. If I hadn't overlooked so much in the past, perhaps things wouldn't have come to this."

Despite her pain, Kate let out a bitter laugh. "For your information,I disowned you as my father a long time ago. You're nothing to me now,so I don't care what you have to say," she sneered. "But know this-my death will haunt you forever for just standing by and watching." Her words echoed in his mind, but Peter responded with sorrow. "You're right, it will haunt me, but not for the reasons you think. It will haunt me because I am to blame for all of this. If I hadn't betrayed Lily's mother by getting involved with Bella, you wouldn't have been born into this world.My infidelity brought you into existence, and for that, I'm entirely to blame. His words shocked Kate, bringing tears to her eyes. She had never expected him to say something so painful, something that would cut so deeply, "Go to hell!" she screamed through her tears. Being reminded that she was the product of an affair struck a blow to her pride.

Lily and Alexander stood nearby, watching the scene unfold. They never expected Peter to speak so harshly, even if it was the truth.His words hit Kate hard, making her realize the full weight of whathe was saying.

"May we never meet again in another life," Peter said before turning and leaving the torture room. He didn't bother to look back at Lily.

Lily watched him go, then turned her gaze to Kate, who was still weeping.

"I think you should go home and rest. I'll handle everything from here.You'll hear of her death soon," Alexander suggested.

"I don't want to go home. I need to stay until I know for sure that she's dead," Lily replied.

Alexander sighed. "If her death is going to weigh on you, we can go through legal channels instead of doing this illegally."

"We tried the legal way before, but she escaped," Lily reminded him.

"Yes, but this time I'll make sure she's sentenced to death. Would you prefer that?" After thinking it over, Lily nodded. "That's better. What about Albert and the others?" "They'll die by my hand1. I'm only letting Kate go through the legal process because I don't want you to carry the burden of killing your own blood. Let the justice system do its job."

 Lily nodded and sighed in relief, feeling a weight lift off her shoulders.

Alexander later dealt with Albert and the others personally, ensuring their deaths. Anyone who dared to harm his loved ones would face his wrath.This would serve as a lesson to his enemies.

Three days later, after the court case, Kae was sentenced to death by hanging.

Bella received an anonymous letter in prison about her daughter's sentence. She tried to take her own life, believing that everything was her fault, but Alexander's people in the prison stopped her. Alexander had many eyes and ears within the prison walls, even among Bella's cellmates,who were keeping close watch on her.

According to them, their master, Alexander, insisted that Bella remain alive to continually reflect on her misdeeds until the day she dies. Staying alive was her punishment.

Lily was glad she had listened to her father and hadn't taken Kate's life with her own hands. If she had, the guilt of her sister's blood on her hands would have haunted her. Finally, everything was over, and they could move on with their lives.Viola returned to her cheerful self after the kidnapping. The chaos in Aurora City caused by the kidnapping eventually died down, and all articles-both old and new-about Viola Kane's abduction and the Kane and Blake family conglomerates were permanently erased from the internet. Alexander and Lily decided that Viola would be homeschooled from now on to prevent anything like this from ever happening again.
###Chapter 96

Six months later, in one of the grandest chapels in H City, Lily couldn't help but beam as she watched her beautiful friend emerge from the car.Today marked the wedding of Sarah and Antony, with Lily serving as the maid of honor.


It wasn't until Antony had moved to H City that Lily learned of the love story between Sarah and Antony. Sarah had kept their relationship a secret for four years. After hiearing their tale, Lily felt overjoyed that they had reunited and were now set to be married.

Sarah and Antony's wedding was a grand spectacle, hosted in one of the largest chapels in H City. The venue was an architectural marvel, with towering stained glass windows casting a warm, colorful light throughout the chapel. The high, vaulted ceilings adorned with intricate carvings and chandeliers added an air of elegance and grandeur.

As Sarah made her way down the aisle, she radiated beauty in her wedding gown. The dress was a stunning ivory piece, intricately detailed with lace, featuring a fitted bodice and a flowing train that seemed endess.Her veil, also adorned with delicate lace, framed her face perfectly.She carried a bouquet of white roses and lilies, adding an element of timeless grace to her ensemble.Antony,dressed in a classíc black tuxedo, looked equally striking. His crisp white shirt and black bow tie perfectly complemented Sarah's attire. He stood at the altar,exuding charm, his eyes filled with anticipation and joy. The chapel was filled with their friends and family, enveloping the atmosphere in warmth and love. The wedding had garnered widespread attention, not merely because of the couple but also due to their connections with Alexander Kane and Lily Armstrong. The event had become the talk of the town, with paparazzi and reporters eager to capture the perfect photo and story.

"I do.”

"I do."

"You may kiss the bride."

Antony wasted no time lifting her veil and locking lips with her, earning a joyful round of applause from the crowd. Viola, the flower girl,watched with a smile, dreaming of having a wedding like this one day.

Outside the chapel, the couple took photos together with their families and friends. Even Antony's relatives, who had initially disapproved of Sarah,had no choice but to attend the wedding.

Viola stood by, smiling as she watched the photo session,her curiosity piqued.

"Viola," Alexander and Lily called out as they walked toward their daughter, hand in hand.

Viola rushed to her parents and hugged their legs. Alexander picked her up and kissed her on the forehead.

“Daddy,Mommy.” “Yes,dear?” “Do all couples take pictures on their wedding day?" "Yes, sweetheart, they do. It helps them remember the day and show it to their children and grandchildren," Lily replied. Viola glanced back at the couple taking photos before turning to her parents."But you've never shown me your wedding pictures," she pouted.curious to see her mother's beautiful gown and her father's well-tailored tuxedo.


Alexander and Lily were taken aback, caught off guard by her question.They exchanged looks, momentarily at a loss for words.

They didn't know how to explain that they didn't have wedding photos since they never had a traditional white wedding or church ceremony due to the circumstances under which they married.

Alexander gently caressed his daughter's hair and smiled.“Soon,my love.Ours will be even more glamorous, and there will be plenty of pictures to look at, okay?" Viola smiled and nodded.

Lily leaned in and whispered to Alexander,“Are you saying we'll get married again?"

"Yes, Mrs. Kane, we wil have a church wedding once I sort a few things out." Alexander whispered back.

Lily smiled joyfully and kissed his cheek. “I'll be waiting,"she said.Alexander shook his head. "No, no, no, that's not a proper kiss." He leaned closer and kissed her deeply on the lips.

Viola closed her eyes, giving her parents a moment of privacy. ********************** Meanwhile, in a hidden underground medical research facility in Northern Europe,a pale-skinned girl with brunette hair lay in a king-sized bed in one of the ICU rooms. By her side sat a middle-aged woman with the same hair color,holding her hand. It had been 12 years since her daughter had fallen into a coma after a tragic accident. The woman had spent every night and day hoping and praying for her daughter's recovery.

As she prayed with her eyes closed, she suddenly felt her daughter's hand move.Startled, she opened her eyes to find her daughter wide awake.

"Oh my God!" she exclaimed, overwhelmed with shock and joy.“Oh my God,you're finally awake!" Tears streamed down her face as she looked at her daughter.


"Wh... where?” her daughter tried to speak, her voice raspy and dry.

“Let me get you some water," her mother quickly offered, rushing to fetch a glass of water. She placed a straw in it so her daughter could sip easily.

“Here, drink this slowly," she instructed.

The girl sipped the water, and once her throat felt better, she looked at her mother,eyes full of questions.“Where am I?”

Her mother, still overwhelmed with emotion, tried to calm herself before answering. “You're in a medical facility.”

The girl scanned the room before looking back at her mother.“What happened to me?" “You've been in a coma. You need to rest now. The doctors said that when you wake up, you shouldn't talk too much or move around. I need to call the doctor to check on you." "Coma," the girl repeated, the word echoing in her mind. How long had she been asleep? "Yes, my dear. Hold on, let me call the doctor."

As her mother prepared to leave the room, the girl's next words stopped her in her tracks.

"I need to get out of here. I need to find Alexander and beg for his forgiveness before it's too late, before he hates me completely," she said urgently,her voice growing hoarse again.

Her mother's expression changed. She turned slowly to face her daughter,forcing a smile. “You will, but only after you've recovered."

“No!” the girl screamed, shocking her mother.

"Jesus!" the older woman gasped, placing a hand over her heart. Even in her weakened state, her daughter's temper was still fierce.

The girl glared at her mother, her voice icy. “How long have I beenin a coma?”


Her mother hesitated, unsure whether to tell her the truth. She knew that if she didn't, her daughter would start screaming and possibly harm herself.Remembering how violent her daughter could be, she decided to answer.

"How long?" the girl demanded again, her voice sharp despite the pain in her throat. “12... years," her mother replied, trembling. The girl's eyes widened. "What did you just say?" Her tone grew eerily calm. "12 years. You've been in a coma for 12 years, and you've only just woken

 up."

"12 years," the girl muttered to herself, shaking her head in disbelief. “I've been in a coma for 12 years? No, no, no, that can't be true, Mother,"she said, tears streaming down her face. “It can't be.”

"I'm afraid it is. You nearly died in that plane crash, but fate gave you a second chance. Now, you have to live a peaceful and happy life," her mother said, trying to console her.

The girl had been only 19 years old when she was involved in the crash.She shook her head in denial, then noticed a calendar across the room.It was indeed 12 years later. How could she have been asleep for so long?

“You have to accept it," her mother insisted.

“But I need to ask for his forgiveness, Mother. I need Alexander to forgive me so we can go back to being the happy couple we were," she said, tears falling freely.

Her mother shook her head. “You can't do that anymore. Alexander Kane has moved on. He's happily married and has a child, and..."

"No! Stop! Stop!" the girl screamed, covering her ears to block out her mother's words. "No, no, no! Alexander despises women. There's no way he could end up with someone else. I'm the only woman he loves and will ever love!" she shouted,her voice breaking. Her mother rushed to her side, trying to calm her down. “Leave me alone!" the girl shouted, pushing her mother away. “I need to see Alexander," she insisted, pulling out the IV needles and trying to get out of bed. But the nurses and doctors arrived just in time to restrain her.

“Get a grip on yourself, Ariana!" her mother shouted, trying to bring her to her senses, but the girl continued to scream.

"I need to see Alexander! Alexander! Alexander!" she cried until the doctors injected her with a-sedative, and she drifted back into unconsciousness.
###Chapter 97

Two years later, in a hidden and remote base,deep within one of the underground rooms designed for torment, the agonizing cries of a man being subjected to extreme pain echoed through the chamber.His voice was filled with sheer terror as a scorching blade was driven into his palm,the searing pain too overwhelming to endure.

Alexander stood there, observing as his men relentlessly inflicted unimaginable suffering upon the man.

“Boss,he's passed out.," Max reported.

“Then bring him back around," Alexander responded with cold detachment.

Max hesitated, wanting to point out that the man had already endured more than enough. But when he caught the icy glare in Alexander's eyes,the words died in his throat. Swallowing hard, Max quickly grabbed another burning blade from the fire and plunged it into the man's other arm, jolting him back into consciousness with a scream of agony.

This man, once a trusted business associate in Alexander's shadowy world,had dared to betray him. Now, he served as a stark warning to others who might consider such treachery.

After a prolonged session of torure, Alexander finally gave the signal for Max to stop. "Lock him up in one of the darkest cells," Alexander commanded."Right away, Boss," Max replied. Checking his watch. Alexander noted that it was almost time for his daughter's important day. Today marked Viola's fifth birthday, an event she had been eagerly anticipating for weeks. If he lingered any longer at the base, he would be late for the grand celebration.

At one of Kane's most opulent ballrooms, preparations were in full swing for Viola's birthday celebration. Guests were expected to start arriving around 8 PM.


Alexander and Nuella had gone to great lengths to ensure their daughter's fifth birthday was everything she had dreamed of. Her favorite characters were invited, her friends were on the guest list, and family members were all set to attend.

Though primarily a children's event, many adults viewed it as an opportunity to attend a prestigious gathering hosted by the influential Alexander Kane.


A year prior, Alexander and Nuella had decided that Viola should resume attending aprivate school, as the threats to her life had subsided. They wanted her to interact with other children her age and begin forming friendships.


Every one of her classmates had received an invitation to the party,including her teacher and the principal of the newly established elite school. The old school had been permanently closed after the kidnapping incident two years ago. Parents of her classmates seized the opportunity to attend the party,hoping to establish connections with the Kane family. Many other influential figures, whose children attended the same school as Vioa,went to great lengths to secure an invitation. As the clock struck 8 PM, guests began arriving in their luxurious vehicles. Photographers and reporters swarmed the venue, eager to capture the event. What was intended as a children's party had transformed into a major social event for the elite, whose children shared a classroom with Viola Kane.


Viola, now referred to as the "Golden Child," became the center of attention as her fifth birthday celebration drew nationwide interest.

"If this is how much attention her fifth birthday is getting, imagine the global buzz when she turns sixteen or eighteen," one reporter commented during a live broadcast.


“Indeed, we wouldn't expect anything less from the only child of Alexander Kane, the most powerful businessman in the country,and Lily Kane,the most successful businesswoman," another journalist agreed.

Caleb Blake, Viola's great-grandfather, attended the grand celebration along with her great-grandmother. Helen Kane, and her aunt, Sandra Kane.Richard and Sophia arrived with their two-year-old son.

sarah, Viola's godmother, wouldn't have missed her goddaughter's birthday for the world. She and Anthony made sure to arrive in the city just in time for the event.


Everyone close to Viola had arrived and presented her with gifts, but her father was still absent. Despite her mother assuring her that Alexander would arrive soon, he still hadn't shown up.


Viola's mood darkened as her friends began to notice her unhappiness.It was her special day, yet instead of being filled with joy and excitement,she seemed preoccupied and sad.

"What's wrong. Viola?" one of her friends asked. "Nothing," Viola responded in a melancholic tone before walking away to find a quiet spot, behaving more like an adult than a child. She didn't want to interrupt her mother, who was deep in conversation with her godmother.

Several security guards followed as she sought out a secluded area to call her father, whose absence was now causing her distress. Viola found her father's number in her phone and dialed it. The call connected after just a few rings.

“Viola,” Alexander answered, a smile evident in his voice as he waited to hear his daughter.

“Daddy,why aren't you here yet?" she demanded, frustration evident.

His smile grew; only Viola and her mother could elicit such a warm reaction from him. "I'm sorry, sweetheart. I got caught in traffic but will be there soon.”"


"That's because you didn't leave work on time, Daddy! It's my big day,"she scolded him again.

"Yes, it is, my love. I'll be there shortly."

“You did get my present,right?"

"I wouldn't forget it for the world."

Viola smiled, reassured. "Okay, Daddy. I love you. See you1 soon.”

"I love you too," Alexander replied, blowing her akiss through the phone before ending the call.

Viola beamed with happiness as she returned to the ballroom, with her guards in tow.

Meanwhile, at the international airport of Aurora City, a woman with brunette hair stepped out of the terminal, dressed in all black with sunglasses that drew the attention of onlookers. A luxury car awaited her outside.


“Welcome back, ma'am," her bodyguard greeted her with a bow, opening the car door.

Ariana removed her sunglasses and smiled. She glanced around, taking a deep breath. “It's good to be home," she said before sliding into the car.

The bodyguard quickly took his place behind the wheel.

“Where to,ma'am?”

She looked at him from the back seat. "To the hotel first, then to the event.”

“Ma'am, you're still planning to attend the event?" The bodyguard was unsure of her intentions.

"Yes, of course. I have an invitation, so it's only right that I go. It would be quite rude to miss the celebration of their Golden Child," Ariana replied with a sly smile.
###Chapter 98

Ariana arrived at a newly constructed luxury hotel, a striking twenty-story building that had recently been added to the Blake Hotel Company's portfolio. She had meticulously planned her stay well in advance, ensuring that the prestigious presidential suite on the top floor would be reserved for her. Her bodyguard, Samson, respectfully opened the car door for her,allowing her to step out and take in the sight of the towering structure before her.


"Thank you, Samson," she acknowledged, her tone carrying a note of authority,before she confidently strode towards the entrance of the grand establishment, with Samson following closely behind.

As soon as Ariana crossed the threshold of the hotel, she was welcomed by the sight of a magnificent crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling, its radiant light casting an inviting warmth throughout the lavishly decorated lobby. The floors, crafted from pristine marble, exuded an air of opulence,while the gentle melodies of a grand piano playing in the background added a sophisticated touch to the ambiance.

An elegantly dressed doorman greeted her with a courteous smile,promptly arranging for her luggage to be handled with the utmost care.Ariana made her way to the reception desk, where a group of highly trained staff members attended to her needs with the highest level of professionalism and respect. After completing the check-in process, one of the staff members,wearing white gloves, presented her with a gleaming gold key card, a symbol of the exclusive privileges that awaited her. The concierge, eager to ensure her stay was nothing short of perfect, offered to assist with anyreservations or special arrangements she might require. With anticipation, Ariana entered the elevator and ascendedI to the highest floors, where her suite awaited. The corridor leading to her destination was adorned with exquisite artwork, each piece a testament to wealth and cultural sophistication, setting the stage for the luxury she was about to experience.

Upon entering the presidential suite, Ariana was immediately captivated by the breathtaking views of the city visible through the expansive floor-to-ceiling windows. The suite's living area was furnished with luxurious pieces in rich hues, complemented by plush carpets and a chandelier that mirrored the grandeur of the one in the lobby below. A grand dining table was positioned adjacent to a state-of-the-art kitchen, perfectly suited for hosting private gatherings of the highest caliber.

The bedroom was a sanctuary of comfort and elegance, featuring a king-sized bed dressed in the finest linens. The en-suite bathroom was nothing short of spectacular, boasting a Jacuzzi tub, marble countertops, and an array of high-end toiletries. A private terrace extended from the suite,offering a secluded space where Ariana could relax while enjoying sweeping views of the city skyline.

As she settled into her lavish surroundings, Ariana couldn't help but acknowledge the exceptional quality of the Blake Hotel. She mused over the remarkable taste and business acumen of the hotel's visionary,Alexander's wife, who had overseen the entire project. A smile played on Ariana's lips as she thought about the upcoming reunion with Alexander,a moment she had long anticipated. The prospect of reclaiming what she believed was rightfully hers filled her with determination. Ariana rose to freshen up and prepare for the evening's banquet,when her phone began to ring. A frown creased her forehead as she glanced at the screen, recognizing her mother's number. Although she deeply cared for her mother, she often found her overly concerned and somewhat intrusive,especially considering that she was a grown woman of thirty-three who didn't need to be told how to live her life.

Her mother had been vehemently opposed to her returning to Country A,urging her instead to move on from her past with Alexander. But for Ariana, moving on was impossible; Alexander was the center of her world,the onething she desired above all else. She had made a gravemistake years ago, betraying him for the sake of her family, but now she was determined to seek his forgiveness and gradually work her way back into his life, regardless of whether he was married or not.

The phone continued to ring until Ariana finally answered with a curt,"What is it?"

"Ariana," her mother's voice came through the line,filled with concern.

"Mother," Ariana responded, her tone edged with impatiece.

Mrs. Martins sighed deeply. "So, you're not going to change your mind?"

"No."

"Very well then. If that's the case, I'm coming to Country A to be with you.It's been two years since you came out of that coma, but your body hasn't fully recovered yet. I need to be there to take care of you."

A smile tugged at Ariana's lips. "Now you're talking sense, Mother." "Since you just arrived, you should rest," her mother suggested. "Rest?" Ariana chuckled softly. "I'll rest after I've attended the banquet.I can't miss making my grand entrance for anything in the world." "What banquet are you talking about?" her mother inquired,puzzled.

"The one for Alexander's child. I received an invitation," Ariana revealed,her voice laced with anticipation.

"What? How did you...?"

"Get an invitation?" Ariana finished the question her mother was about to ask.


"Yes."

"You won't believe who invited me, Mother."

"Who?"

"Lily Blake herself," Ariana said with a laugh, enjoying the shock she imagined on her mother's face.

Carolina was stunned. "How...?" Carolina knew all too well that Lily was Alexander's wife, and the couple was a constant topic of conversation online. How on earth did her daughter get an invitation from someone who should be her rival?

"I'll explain everything when you arrive in the country, but for now,I need to get ready. I can't afford to be late." With that, Ariana ended the call and moved to prepare herself for the banquet. Carolina stared at the now silent phone, a deep sense of unease settling in her heart. She had heard countless stories about Alexander's ruthlessness,and she was well aware that during Ariana's university days, her daughter had often spoken of how merciless Alexander could be towards his enemies. Carolina could only hope that when Ariana saw the reality of the situation,she would realize the futility of her quest and give up.




Meanwhile, at the banquet, Alexander's entrance immediately commanded attention. He was admired by many men his age who aspired to achieve his level of success, and numerous women envied Lily, wishing they could experience the love and devotion Alexander showered on her. Even the children present, attending what was ostensibly a celebration for Viola,couldn't help but feel as though it was their own party due to the grandeur of the event.

All éyes were on Alexander as he made his way to Lily, greeting her with a kiss in full view of the assembled guests.

"What took you so long?" Lily playfully chided him.

"Traffic," he replied simply.

"Alright," Lily said. placing her hand affectionately on his chest. "You look very handsome in this suit."


"And you look stunning in that dress," Alexander complimented her,causing Lily to blush.

He kissed her forehead tenderly. "Where's Viola? "I'll go see her now," Alexander said, kissing Lily's forehead once more before heading towards where Viola was seated, happily indulging in her dessert. Alexander chuckled as he approached his daughter, crouching down to her level and wrapping his arms around her small frame. "Happy birthday,my little girl."

"Daddy!" Viola squealed in delight, her hands, covered in cake, landing squarely on her father's face.

"Ooh," Viola blinked in surprise at the mess she had inadvertently made."Let me clean it!" she declared, using her tongue to lick the cake off his face.

Lily watched the heartwarming scene with a smile, feeling a deep sense of contentment as she observed the two most important people in her life.

Alexander laughed at his daughter's antics. "My girl is absolutely adorable."

"And beautiful," Lily added.

"Yes, and beautiful," Alexander agreed, pressing a kiss to Viola's forehead.

He then presented her with the gift he had brought, which quickly became the topic of conversation among the guests. The hotel where the banquet was held was now registered in Viola's name, along with a vacation house on the island she had dreamed of visiting during the holidays.Additionally, Alexander had gifted her a diamond necklace, personalized
with her name and the names of her parents. The party continued with Alexander and Lily sharing a dance with Viola on the dance floor until the atmosphere was disrupted by the arrival of an unexpected guest. Ariana made her entrance in an opulent gown that exuded luxury.The dress, crafted from the finest silk in a deep, regal shade of sapphire,featured intricate gold embroidery that shimmered under the ambient light of the banquet hall. The attire made her feel as though she was the true star of the event.

As she stepped into the room, heads turned and gasps were heard as guests took in the sight of the stunning woman who had just arrived.None of them recognized her, leading to hushed whispers as they speculated about her identity, assuming she must be one of the country's many mysterious billionaires.

The collective murmuring caught the attention of Alexander and Lily,prompting them to look towards the entrance. Alexander's eyes widened in disbelief as he recognized Ariana, alive and standing before him.

Ethan and Richard were equally shocked, their expressions mirroring Alexander's astonishment.

"Dear God," Ethan muttered, the glass of wine slipping from his hand and shattering on the floor. "Isshe a ghost? How can this be?"

"This is beyond belief," Richard whispered, pinching himself to ensure he wasn't dreaming. "She wvas supposed to be dead."

Lily, unaware of the history between Ariana and Alexander, smiled warmly.She had met Ariana during a business trip, and they had later signed a contract for a new venture together. Little did Lily know, she had unwittingly made the gravest mistake of her life. Lily stared at Alexander with wide eyes, shocked by his actions. Why did he push Ariana, especially in front of everyone, including their child? "Alexander, what's wrong?" Lily asked,grabbing his hand.
###Chapter 99
To say Alexander was shocked would be an understatement-he was absolutely livid when he saw Ariana standing before him, very much alive.The way she smiled at Lily made him clench his fists tightly.

"How could she be alive after all these 14 years without me knowing? This is unbelievable!" Alexander fumed silently.

Ethan and Richard noticed the fury on Alexander's face. They both knew that given the chance, he wouldn't hesitate to take revenge on the woman who had the audacity to betray him before fleeing.

Ariana did her best to avoid looking at Alexander, instead focusing solely on Lily, whom she smiled at. Had they met before? The thought made him tighten his fists even more. Lily smiled back at Ariana, which only caused Alexander to raise an eyebrow in suspicion.

Ariana approached and hugged Lily. "Hello Lily, thank you for inviting me," she said with a smile. Alexander's face darkened with rage, and he immediately pushed Ariana away from Lily.

Ariana stumbled to the floor, causing a collective gasp from everyone in the banquet hall. Even Ethan and Richard were taken aback by Alexander's reaction-they knew how much he despised Ariana for what she had done, but they didn't expect him to act so openly until the crowd had dispersed."She has no business being here! How could you have met her without me knowing?" Alexander demanded, his anger palpable.

Lily let go of his hand and went to Ariana. "Miss Martins, are you alright?"

Tears streamed down Ariana's face as she sniffled, looking at Alexander,who was glaring at her with a deadly intensity. "Why did you do that?What did I do wrong?" she asked, her tears flowing freely.

The onlookers began whispering among themselves. They were well aware of Alexander Kane's ruthless reputation, but they had never seen him act out like this before.


Alexander marched over and pulled Lily away. "Stay away from her. Do I make myself clear?" he warned sternly.

Lily was more confused than ever. What exactly was happening? Did Alexander know Miss Martins? Her gaze shifted to Ariana, who was being helped up by her bodyguard, Samson.

"Do you know her?" Lily asked Alexander, but he remained silent. It was at that moment that he realized he had never told Lily about his past, so there was no way she could know about Ariana.

"Alexander, talk to me," Lily insisted, her patience wearing thin.While it seemed clear that Alexander knew who Ariana was, it appeared Ariana did not recognize him. In the background, Peter turned to Caleb, "Father, I think wve should leave.Sooner or later, Alexander is going to end this party." Caleb nodded in agreement, still trying to figure out who the woman was.Judging by Alexander's reaction, she was clearly someone from his past. As they exited the banquet hall and got into the car, Caleb instructed Victor, his right-hand man, to investigate everything about the woman who had just arrived.

Back in the banquet hall, Alexander still hadn't answered Lily's question.

"Max." Alexander called out.

"Yes,boss?"

"Tell the chauffeur to take Grandma, Sandra, and Viola home."

"Viola too?" Lily questioned, surprised that Alexander wanted Viola to leave with Grandma Helen.

"Yes, she'll spend the night there," Alexander confirmed.


Lily was baffled by his sudden decisions.

"Right away, boss," Max responded, then promptly escorted Grandma Helen, Sandra, and Viola out. Viola said her goodbyes to her parents before leaving. Although she was just a child, she could sense the shift in her father's mood when that woman arrived, understanding that her father must deeply despise her. Viola wasn't upset that her party was ending early; she was already tired. Sophia also left with herson,while Sarah departed with Antony,her husband. Sarah was determined to question Antony later because it seemed like he knew who the woman was and why Alexander was so furious. "The celebrant has left. The party is over, everyone," Ethan announced.Their security team immediately began guiding guests outside. But,as expected, some reporters hid in the corners, eager to capture whatever might unfold between the Kanes and this mysterious woman.

Ariana appeared bewildered as she looked around, seeing only Alexander,Lily,Ethan,and Richard-whom she recognized.

"I'm confused. What's happening here, Lily? Did I unknowingly cause some sort of disturbance? And why did you push me like that,Mr.Kane?Care to explain?" Ariana demanded, her voice tinged with anger.

"And why did the party end as soon as I arrived? Lily, can you please tell me what's going on? I didn't travel all the way from Europe to be humiliated like this," she added, clearly irritated.

Ethan and Richard exchanged puzzled looks. Was she not the Ariana they remembered? Could they have madea mistake? It seemed like she didn't recognize Alexander or them.

Lily waited for Alexander to respond, but it was Ethan who finally spoke up.

"Miss Ariana Martins," he called out.

Ariana turned to him with a puzzled expression.′′Yes?′′

"That's your name, correct?" Ethan asked as he stepped closer to her.

"Yes,it is."

Ethan stopped just in front of her. "Then you're the Ariana from years ago." "University? Betrayed?" Lily murmured to herself. She glanced at Richard,who nodded, confirming her suspicions. Richard had previously mentioned the woman Alexander first loved and how she had betrayed him. Now it turns out Ariana was that woman. But how could she still be alive? Richard had told her she died in a plane crash while fleeing after Alexander discovered her betrayal. Lily was shocked that she had unknowingly befriended the same woman. Ariana's face was blank with confusion. "What are you talking about? This is my first time in Country A. I may be from here, but I grew up in Europe." Now she understood Alexander's anger. She looked at him and saw that his rage had not subsided, and from the look on his face, it seemed he would rip Ariana apart if given the chance."Don't yell at me!" she snapped back.

"So you're saying you don't recognize me?"

"This is the first time I'm meeting you."

"Alright," Ethan nodded, then gestured towards Richard. "What about him?Do you recognize him?"

Ariana looked at Richard, but her expression was blank."I don't know him. For heaven's sake, this is my first time in Country A."

"And what about him?" Ethan pointed at Alexander, who was still holding Lily tightly.

Ariana turned her gaze to Alexander. "Yes, I know who he is. He's Alexander Kane, Lily's husband, and aš a businesswoman, I'm well aware that he's one of the wealthiest men in Country A."

Ethan shook his head. "Look at him closely, Ariana. Do you not remember Alexander from university and how you betrayed him?" Ariana studied Alexander again, this time more intently, feeling a wave of emotion but maintaining her composure. "I don't remember. What exactly are you talking about? I studied in Europe, and I have no idea what betrayal you're referring to."

"Try again," Richard urged.

Ariana acted as if she were trying to recall something,clutching her head as if in pain. "I'm sorry, but I can't remember anything. Ahh, my head hurts!" she screamed, holding her head in agony.

"Ma'am!" Samson, who had been standing nearby, rushed to support her before she could collapse. "Ma'am, are you alright?"

"No, please get me out of here," she said weakly.

"Yes,ma'am."

Samson lifted her and carried her out of the hall.

It felt as if they were watching a drama unfold before their eyes.Ethan was speechless. Was she pretending, or had she genuinely lost her memory?

He turned to look at Alexander, who was glaring at the exit, his fists clenched tightly.

"Alexander, I think it's time you told me everything you've kept from me,"Lily said to him. Alexander gazed at her and nodded. "I will when we get home,"he promised, then turned to Ethan.Ethan understood immediately and nodded. They needed to investigate Ariana thoroughly-how she was still alive after all these years and why they were unaware until she appeared today.

Samson placed Ariana in the backseat of the car before getting into the driver's seat and driving off. Once they were away from the hotel, Ariana removed her hand from her head and sat up straight, a smile playing on her lips as she stared out the window.

"Ma'am, should I take you to the hospital?" Samson asked, still concerned.

Ariana smiled. "I'm fine."

Samson glanced at her through therearview mirror. "What you did in there was something else, ma'am. You had me convinced for a moment that you had really lost your memory. I thought you were suffering from temporary amnesia, but it turns out it was all an act."

"So should I head back to the hotel?"

"No."

"Where to,ma'am?"

"The hospital."

"But you said you're fine."

"Yes, I'm fine." "Then why are we going to the hospital,ma'am?" "Because I need to keep playing the victim. Alexander pushed me to the floor, and the reporters stayed until the end to record everything, including when you rushed me out," Ariana said, having noticed the reporters hiding in the corners. "Reporters?" Samson asked, surprised since he hadn't seen any.

"You need to be as observant as I am, Samson," she smiled.

Everything that happened today had worked in her favo.Now,Alexander and Lily would undoubtedly have a heated argument, especially since it seemed Alexander had kept his past a secret from her.

"But ma'am, was it necessary to pretend you lost your memory? What if they find out?" Samson was concerned, knowing the whole story and realizing that his boss was in the wrong for having betrayed Alexander.


Ariana smiled confidently. "Like I said, the reporters and the guests witnessed everything. By tomorrow morning, the news will be all over it,portraying Alexander as the villain while I come off as the victim.When they learn I'm in the hospital, the entire city will be buzzing with interest.All of Alexander and Lily's detractors will criticize them for treating me poorly, which will cause their stock to plummet and create chaos in their respective companies.

"And when the whole city discovers that they bullied a woman who lost her memory and recently woke up from a 12-year coma, they'll despise them even more. That's when I'll step in as their hero by doing an interview," Ariana smirked as she revealed her plan to Samson.
###Chapter 100

"Welcome back, ma'am. Welcome back, sir," Clara and the other maids greeted them, but they were completely ignored by Alexander and Lilly,who both wore expressions of anger. The maids wondered what had occurred during Viola's birthday to bring them home so early.

When Clara didn't see Viola with them, she approached Pedro, one of the bodyguards, and he informed her that Viola had been taken to the family residence to stay with her great-grandmother and aunt.

Lilly stormed into the room and slammed the door behind her. Alexander quickly followed, pushing the door open to enter.

"How could you possibly meet her and even sign a business contract with her!" Alexander was furious. They had,been arguing the entire way home in the car.


"Maybe if you'd been honest with me from the beginning, I would have known that the same woman was from your past, but instead,you kept everything from me," Lilly retorted.

"She was supposed to be dead, Lilly! Ariana died in a plane crash. For all these years, I would have known if she was alive. And now, out of nowhere, she reappears, pretending to have lost her memory,"Alexander shot back. Lilly stared at him in silence. He was right; he had kept this from her until now. "What if she really did lose her memory?" Lilly asked, unable to shake the feeling that it was all too real. Alexander frowned at her words. "Do you think her meeting you in Europe was just a coincidence? She doesn't even have the accent. How could you fall for such a scam? I knowyou're smarter than that."

"Not everyone has the accent. Besides, she told me she was from Country
A and spoke with our accent. So yes, I believed her. And the main reason I signed a business contract with her was because of her sharp business acumen. She's good at what she does, and I wanted to work with her."

"You're not doing business with her anymore," Alexander declared.

Lilly sat on the bed, lost in thought. Everything that had happened felt surreal. A person they believed to be dead had suddenly reentered their lives. "We already signed the contract. Breaking it without fulfilling our obligations will be difficult."

"I don't care how difficult it is. The last thing I want is her getting close to the people I care about,especially you."

Lilly gazed at him. "Do you think I want to do business with her after finding out who she is? I don't, Alexander. But now, I have no choice. If I don't fulfill my part of the deal, I'll be sued."

"Let me handle it," Alexander sat beside her, placing his hand on hers."Don't do anything. I'll deal with her," he said softly.

Lilly pulled her hand away. "Fine. I'm going to sleep, but I won't sleep here tonight." Alexander grabbed her arm. "Why not? Where are you planning to sleep?" "The guest room." "And why do you want to sleep elsewhere?" Alexander's tone grew harsher. "Because I need to be alone. A lot happened today."

Alexander pulled her onto his lap, wrapping his arms around her waist."You don't need to sleep elsewhere. I'll give you space if you need it,but only if you sleep here."

Lilly didn't argue further and got up to go to the bathroom.

Once she left. Alexander made a call to Ethan to get updates on wha he had found out.


The next day, the entire internet was abuzz with the events that had unfolded at the Kane family banquet. Reporters had not hesitated to post videos of Alexander pushing Ariana away from Lilly, causing her to fall to the floor, and recordings of Ethan, a friend of Alexander Kane,interrogating and bullying her.

"Attendance at the banquet was strictly by invitation, so she must have had one. The way the lady, Ariana Martins, hugged Mrs. Kane showed they were familiar with each other. But Alexander Kane pushing the woman away from his wife shocked everyone, including me,who was present. Because of that same lady, Alexander Kane ended his child's party and had his friend, Ethan, interrogate her. According to the audio, Ethan was heard asking the lady if she didn't recognize them, but she insisted she didn't know him, Alexander Kane,and Richard Williams. They talked about her betraying Alexander years ago during their university days. Ariana Martins fainted and was rushed to the hospital by her bodyguard after the confrontation. As we speak,she's at the central hospital," the reporter announced in the morning's live TV broadcast.  The broadcast sparked a flood of hateful comments aimed at Lilly and
Alexander. People who disapproved of their marriage created fake accounts to post negative remarks.

Within hours, Ariana, who had just arrived in Country A the night before,became infamous as the woman bullied by the Kanes, drawing sympathy and public attention. Her notoriety grew, and she began to amass a following of anti-fans who opposed Alexander and Lilly. These supporters formed groups to attack the couple and counter the defenses put up by Alexander's fans.


Amidst all the drama, Ariana couldn't help but smile and laugh as she read the news and comments on her phone. She had only just begun, but she already had significant support. It seemed it wouldn't be long before she could challenge Lilly's place as Alexander's wife, gradually winning back his trust.


As she reveled in the chaos, Samson, her bodyguard, entered her hospital room,interrupting her moment of satisfaction.

Ariana snapped at him, "What is it?"

"Apologies, ma'am, but you need to see this," Samson handed her his tablet.

Her eyes widened as she looked at the screen, then she burst into laughter,jumping up in excitement.
 
"Oh my God! This is amazing! I love this!" Ariana was ecstatic. The stock prices of Kane Corporation and the Blake Group were plummeting rapidly. She had expected this, but the speedI of the decline surprised her.Ariana grinned, "Everything is going according to plan. Now all I have to do is wait for Alexander to come see me."

"See you?" Samson asked, confused.

"Yes, I'm sure he's already on his way to this hospital right now," Ariana said with a gleeful smile. She couldn't wait for the confrontation.

Samson became alarmed. "Why would he come here, ma'am?"

"To strangle me," she smirked.

"Strangle you?" Samson was taken aback. "Then we should inform the police for your safety."


"Shut up!" Ariana screamed at him. "You're not doing anything. I want you out of here when he arrives. One thing Alexander hates is seeing something he's worked so hard to build over the years fall apart.His company means everything to him, and the fact that the stock market is crashing will make him want to strangle me."

"But what if he doesn't comne?"

"He will. I'm certain of it," Ariana said confidently as she looked at her watch,eagerly waiting for Alexander to walk through the door.
