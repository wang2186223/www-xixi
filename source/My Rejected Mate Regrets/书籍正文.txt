###Chapter 0001

I never questioned my fate. While others spend lifetimes searching for purpose, mine was written in blood from birth. Daughter of two Guardians - the elite warriors who protect our pack's Alpha line - I was born to wield a blade.

My parents were fated mates. That rare, sacred bond where two souls become one. Most wolves spend years yearning for that connection. Some fools reject it, seeing love as weakness. But my parents? Their bond forged them into legends. Together, they stood as Blackthorn Pack's most formidable protectors.

As lead Guardians, they safeguarded Alpha Alistair Grey, his mate Luna Seraphina, and their heir - young Adrian. Then came the Nightshade Pack's betrayal. Five years old, I watched my mother Ivy die shielding our Luna and Adrian from assassins.

In that same ambush, my father Grant fought like a demon. He held off five attackers single-handedly until reinforcements arrived. Then he felt it - the moment my mother's life thread snapped. His hesitation cost him everything. A Nightshade warrior's jaws crushed his spine.

Werewolves heal most wounds. But not this. Not when the mating bond shatters alongside your body. Most wolves follow their mates into death. My father stayed - broken, wheelchair-bound, a ghost of the warrior he'd been - just for me.

He tries. He loves me. But that battle stole everything: his mate, his legs, his purpose. Some days, I wonder if death would've been kinder.
###Chapter 0002

The school hallway buzzed with energy between classes. Pack members greeted me as I passed, their voices calling out my new nickname. I forced a smile and nodded in acknowledgment.

Nathaniel caught up to me, slinging an arm over my shoulders. "Hey, Firecracker, what's the plan after school?"

I groaned. "Don't start with that name."

He grinned, unrepentant. "Too late. The whole squad's calling you that after yesterday. Might as well embrace it."

I stopped walking and shot him a glare. "You're joking." His smirk told me he wasn't. Damn it.

"Anyway," he continued, undeterred, "after school?"

"Same as always. Training with Dad."

His eyebrows rose. "So you do train with the most lethal warrior this pack's ever seen. That's your secret, huh?"

I ignored his question, my attention snagged by Adrian Grey and his usual entourage of admirers. "His fan club's getting bigger," I muttered, nodding toward them.

Nathaniel followed my gaze. "Can you blame them? Future Alpha, built like a god—what's not to love?"

I rolled my eyes. Yes, Adrian was genetically blessed—jet-black hair, piercing glacier-blue eyes, a frame that looked carved by the gods themselves. Every unmated female in a fifty-mile radius was obsessed.

But I refused to be one of them.

My path was set: become the strongest warrior in Blackthorn Pack, stronger than even my parents. My legacy was to protect the future Alpha, just as my father had.

The irony? Adrian had no idea who I was.

My parents were the reason his family was still alive. Their sacrifices were the reason he could parade around like some untouchable prince. And one day, I'd be sworn to protect that arrogant—

Focus, Evelyn.

Selene, my wolf, stirred. 'You're staring.'

I snapped my gaze away just as Adrian's icy eyes locked onto mine. A jolt of electricity shot through me.

What the hell was that?

Selene practically purred. 'Alpha energy. Can't help it.'

'Not you too,' I groaned internally, shutting her out.

Nathaniel waved a hand in front of my face. "Earth to Evelyn. You zoning out again?"

"Sorry. What?"

He sighed. "I said, yeah, his harem's growing. His birthday's coming up—everyone's hoping they'll be his fated mate."

I snorted. "There can be only one."

Nathaniel laughed, recognizing the Highlander reference. "Nice. Now, back to my question—after school?"

"Thursday. You know Alpha Alistair comes for dinner."

Every Thursday, without fail, the Alpha shared a meal with my father. A small gesture, but it meant everything. After Mom died and Dad lost the use of his legs, he'd wanted to leave. Instead, Alpha Alistair built us a house on the edge of pack lands—close enough for protection, far enough for peace.

Nathaniel winced. "Right, forgot it was Thursday. Clubbing tomorrow, though?"

"Obviously."

"Perfect."

We walked into class, the weight of my future pressing down.

One day, I'd stand beside Adrian Grey as his guardian.

And I had no intention of being just another girl in his orbit.
###Chapter 0003

Graduation looms just months away. In two weeks, I'll turn eighteen. If fate smiles on me, I'll find my mate soon after, and Dad can officially pass me the Alpha title.

Donovan, my best friend and future Beta, leans against the kitchen counter when I enter the pack house. "Morning, Alpha. Sleep well?"

His smirk tells me he caught Bianca slipping out earlier. I take a sip of coffee, grinning. "No complaints here."

He barks a laugh. "Your mom would skin you alive if she knew."

True. Mom's obsessed with me waiting for my destined mate. "She won't find out," I say, grabbing my keys. "Why were you up so early anyway?"

He rubs the back of his neck, sheepish. "Let's just say I wasn't suffering either. At least I walked her to her car."

I roll my eyes and head for the door. "Riding with me?"

"Obviously."

Blackthorn territory stretches wide, but the school sits on the border between our lands and Nightshade Pack's. A fifteen-minute drive from the pack house.

Our home is structured by rank. The fourth floor belongs to my family—the Alpha line. Donovan's family occupies the third as Betas. Gammas take the second. The left wing houses ranked wolves; the right holds guest rooms and unmated warriors who prefer pack house living. The first floor? Kitchen, dining hall, rec room, meeting spaces—everything needed for pack gatherings. Omegas who stay here have their quarters downstairs too.

Blackthorn isn’t the largest pack, but we’re the strongest. Over five hundred members. My father, Alistair Grey, is a force. I’m his heir, bred to lead. And technically, we have two Guardians—though I’ve never met the daughter of the couple who saved my parents.

Mom visits Ivy Sinclair’s memorial weekly, leaving fresh flowers. A reminder that her sacrifice wasn’t in vain. I whisper my own thanks to her spirit, vowing to watch over Evelyn.

Dad meets with Grant Sinclair every week. No one joins them—not even Mom. For years, Dad’s tried pulling Grant back into pack life, offering him lead warrior trainer. No luck. The pack calls him "The Broken Warrior." Once our best fighter, now paralyzed for thirteen years. He and Evelyn live on the edge of our territory, under strict orders for privacy.

At school, Donovan and I are swarmed instantly. Girls hoping to be Luna or Beta female. Most just want bragging rights for sleeping with us. And we’re happy to oblige—but I’d never make one my Luna unless she’s my fated mate.

Double standard? Absolutely. Do I care? Not even a little.

"Adrian! Weekend plans?" Rosalind—a redhead I’ve definitely slept with—bats her lashes. Donovan’s smirk confirms it.

"Nothing solid. Why?"

"My friends are hitting Silver Fang Friday. You two should come." Her tone drips suggestion.

Donovan and I exchange a look. "We’ll be there."

She beams like I handed her the moon. "Perfect!" Her friend leans in, whispering, "You won’t regret it."

I smirk. "I never do."

They disappear down the hall, Rosalind calling over her shoulder, "See you later, Alpha! Beta!"

Donovan nudges me as we walk to class. "Sounds promising."

"Very."

——

By lunch, the buzz about Friday’s club trip has spread. Half of Blackthorn and Nightshade packs are going.

Then I feel it—eyes on me.

I look up and freeze.

Emerald green eyes lock onto mine. Thick, dark curls frame her face, lips made for sin. My wolf, Theron, surges forward, restless.

‘Who is she?’

‘Don’t know. But I want her.’

Theron’s never reacted to anyone before.

A guy slings an arm around her shoulders, guiding her away. Theron snarls.

‘Easy. We’re in public.’

I turn to Donovan. "Who’s that?"

He follows my gaze. "The brunette? No clue. But she’s your type—curly hair, killer eyes."

True. I love those wild, silken curls.

"Want me to dig up intel?"

I shake my head, grinning. "I’ll handle it myself."

The bell rings. By day’s end, she’ll be mine.
###Chapter 0004

The final bell rings, signaling the end of another exhausting school day. I make my way to my locker, mentally preparing for the homework waiting for me. Nathaniel is my ride this week—we alternate driving duties, and it’s his turn.

As I shuffle through my books, deciding which ones to take home, a sudden shadow looms over me. I glance up and freeze.

Adrian Grey.

The future Alpha of Blackthorn Pack stands there, his icy blue eyes locked onto me. Perfect. Just what I needed.

I bite back my irritation. No point in pissing off the guy I’ll likely be stuck with for the rest of my life.

Taking a deep breath, I force a polite smile. "Alpha, what can I do for you?" I think I nail the tone—just disinterested enough to be convincing but not outright rude.

His lips curl into a smirk. "Hey there, gorgeous. I don’t think we’ve met before."

Seriously? That’s his opener? Like we haven’t been in the same schools since forever?

I plaster on my best fake smile. "Guess not. Hard to see past all your admirers, huh?" I shut my locker and lean against it, crossing my arms. Just for fun, I bat my lashes. "Wait… you are an Alpha, right?" I widen my eyes, playing the starstruck fan.

His grin widens. "That’s right, sweetheart. But don’t let my aura scare you. I hear it can be… intense."

Selene snorts in my head. This guy’s full of himself.

No kidding.

The joke’s on him, though. Guardians are immune to Alpha commands. My dad says it’s because, centuries ago, Alphas started ordering their Guardians to stand down in battles, putting themselves at risk. So, evolution fixed that.

Not that Adrian would know. He clearly has no clue who I am—or what my family has sacrificed for his.

His aura rolls over me like a wave, but it doesn’t affect me. Not that I’d ever let him know that.

"Oh wow," I press a hand to my chest like I’m overwhelmed. "It’s so nice to meet you."

Selene cackles. You’re laying it on thick.

Maybe. But an Alpha should know his own pack. The fact that he doesn’t recognize me? Insulting.

He extends his hand. "Adrian Grey. Future Alpha of Blackthorn Pack. Maybe you’ve heard of me?"

I fake a gasp. "Oh! Wow! Nice to meet you!" I shake his hand—

And jolt.

A spark shoots through my fingers, raising the hairs on my arms. Not painful. Just… unexpected.

His eyes flicker with surprise. Did he feel it too?

Weird. Probably static from the locker.

He’s still holding my hand, waiting. For what?

Then he smirks. "Usually, when someone introduces themselves, you do the same."

Right. Because females must be too dazzled to speak around him.

I’m about to answer when Nathaniel saves me.

"Hey Ev—"

I cut him off. "Hey Nathaniel! Do you know Alpha Adrian?" I shoot him a play along glare.

Nathaniel blinks but catches on fast. "Of course. Alpha Adrian is from my pack." He dips his head in respect.

Adrian nods. "Nathaniel." Then turns back to me. "So, sweetheart, what’s your name? And which pack are you from?"

My jaw tightens. He really doesn’t know.

Nathaniel winces.

Time to mess with him. "What makes you think I’m not from your pack?" I arch a brow, dropping the innocent act.

He mirrors my expression, oozing Alpha arrogance. "Because I know every member of my pack. And I don’t know you."

Oh, this is too good.

I step closer, pressing a hand to his chest—warm, solid, annoyingly sculpted. I force myself not to explore further.

Rising onto my toes, I lean in. He bends slightly, letting me whisper in his ear:

"Then you don’t know everyone. And my name isn’t sweetheart."

I catch his sharp inhale before spinning away. "Let’s go, Nate. I need to get home."

In the car, Nathaniel shoots me a look. "What was that? Why let him think you’re not from Blackthorn?"

"I didn’t let him think anything," I snap. "He started it. He has no idea who I am, then claims he knows everyone?"

"So why not just tell him?"

I gape. "Are you serious?"

Nathaniel sighs. "Just be careful, Ev. You’ll be bound to him eventually. Don’t make him hate you before that."

He’s right. When Adrian becomes Alpha, if I haven’t found my mate, I’ll officially become his Guardian. Stuck with him and his entourage indefinitely.

Ugh.

"Fine," I mutter. "If he approaches me again, I’ll be nice."

Nathaniel snorts. "Yeah, sure. Like you’re nice when someone touches your stuff."

I shrug. "Your point?"

He shakes his head as we pull up to my house. "See you tomorrow."

I wave him off and head inside, already dreading afternoon training with Dad.

###Chapter 0005

She claims to be part of my pack? Impossible.

My father's words echo in my mind. "Know every member by name. Their loyalty is your strength." I've lived by that rule since childhood.

I storm toward my car, fists clenched. That she-wolf didn't submit to me. Didn't even give me her name. And if she's truly pack, why don't I recognize her?

Donovan blocks my path. "Did you find her?"

I glare. "Who?"

"The brunette from earlier. Did you get her details?"

I grip the car door. "You didn't recognize her either?"

He slides into the passenger seat, frowning. "Only saw her back. Why?"

The engine roars to life. "She implied she's Blackthorn Pack."

Donovan blinks. "So?"

"So I don't know her!" The steering wheel creaks under my grip. "I know every warrior, every child, every elder. How does she exist?"

His expression mirrors my frustration. "Maybe she lied?"

I scoff.

"Think about it," he persists. "Some she-wolves avoid Alphas until they find their mates. Could've been protecting herself."

A fair point—until I remember Nathaniel. "She's friends with him."

"Nathaniel Elcove?"

"Apparently."

"Then she's never trained with us." His tone turns definitive. We'd remember a warrior like her.

I drum my fingers. Impossible. I attend every gathering, oversee every training session, eat daily in the packhouse. That wild chestnut hair? Those piercing amber eyes? That electric jolt when we touched? I wouldn't forget.

"Ask Nathaniel tonight," Donovan suggests.

I shoot him a look. "I don't chase she-wolves. And I sure as hell don't interrogate warriors about them."

He shrugs. "Then point her out tomorrow. Maybe I'll recognize her face."

I bump his fist. "Thanks."

"Always." He grins. "Now let's go wreck some warriors."

———

Post-training, I head to dinner after showering. My mother intercepts me in the hallway.

"Adrian, how was your day?"

I kiss her forehead. "Fine. Going to eat."

Her hand halts me. "I'm visiting Ivy's memorial tonight. Your father's dining with Mr. Sinclair. Will you join me?"

As if I'd refuse. Thirteen years of weekly visits—our ritual since Dad claimed his meetings with Evelyn's father are "private time." I get it. But I want to pay respects to the man who sacrificed everything for us. And I want to meet his daughter.

She'll be my responsibility someday. I'll ensure the Sinclairs want for nothing.

I smirk. "You ask like I'd say no."

She laughs. "So like your father. Eat first, then we'll go."

The dining hall buzzes with warriors. My gaze sweeps the room—no sign of the mysterious brunette. Disappointing, but expected.

I load my plate, joining my fighters. The mystery can wait. But not forever.
###Chapter 0006

The moment I step through the front door, I know Dad's been preparing for our training session. He always has something new planned when I'm at school. His training regimens are brutal but effective—sprint drills, obstacle courses, combat simulations. No two days are ever the same.

Some days, he strips me of my senses, forcing me to rely on touch alone. Other times, he cripples one of my limbs mid-fight, testing my ability to adapt. The worst was when he took away both sight and sound. I spent half that session flat on my back.

But it works. Every bruise, every failure, makes me stronger.

"Hey, Dad," I say, dropping my backpack by the table before pressing a quick kiss to his cheek.

"Evelyn." He smiles, ruffling my hair. "How was school?"

"Fine. Classes are ramping up before finals, but nothing I can't handle."

"Still maintaining your grades?"

"Straight A's," I confirm.

Dad nods approvingly. He's drilled it into me since childhood—strength isn't just physical. A warrior needs a sharp mind just as much as a strong body. That's why my studies focus on anatomy, chemistry, and physiology.

Poison resistance training is the worst. Dad administers controlled doses, monitoring my reactions while the pack doctor stands by. It's miserable, but necessary. Wolfsbane barely affects me now—my system burns through it faster every day.

Tonight's session is agility. An indoor course for human form, another outside for shifting. Obstacles, traps, hidden hazards. It's not just about speed—it's about awareness.

Flying logs swing at me. Slick handholds threaten to send me crashing. In wolf form, knives fly from the shadows, nets drop from above. Dad and Evander guide Selene and me through it, correcting our movements.

By the end, we're both exhausted.

"Shower before Alpha Alistair arrives," Dad orders. "I'll start dinner."

Hot water soothes my aching muscles as Selene murmurs in my mind. We're getting stronger.

I grin. Damn right we are.

Dressed in jeans and a hoodie, hair in a messy ponytail, I bound downstairs just as the doorbell rings.

"Alistair!" I greet him warmly. He insisted years ago that I drop formalities during these visits.

He steps inside with a chuckle. "Evening, Little Hellion."

I groan. "Not you too!"

"If the name fits..." He smirks.

Dad's already outside firing up the grill. I grab two beers from the fridge, popping the caps before joining them on the deck.

They're discussing my training when Alistair suddenly asks, "Did Grant tell you about Evelyn's new nickname?"

Dad raises an eyebrow at me.

I sigh dramatically. "Apparently, I'm now 'Little Hellion.'"

Dad's beer pauses mid-sip. "And how exactly did you earn that?"

Alistair answers for me, grinning. "She pinned me in fifteen minutes flat."

Pride flashes across Dad's face. "That's my girl."

The conversation shifts when Alistair brings up warrior training again—his weekly attempt to recruit Dad back. I slip inside to finish dinner prep, tuning out their familiar debate.

Roasted Brussels sprouts with bacon and maple glaze. Garlic butter potatoes. The men return as I'm setting the table, and we settle into an easy rhythm of food and conversation.

They reminisce about old battles, discuss pack politics. Alistair always asks about my life, carefully avoiding any mention of Adrian. Smart man.

Dessert is Seraphina's famous brownies—rich, fudgy, impossible to resist. We devour them in contented silence.

As I clear the dishes, Alistair hands me an envelope. "From my wife. You're formally invited to Adrian's birthday next weekend."

I force a smile. "Wouldn't miss it."

Dad laughs until Alistair adds, "You're invited too, Grant."

His amusement dies instantly.

I pat his shoulder. "Guess you're my plus-one."

Later, homework spread across my bed, I hear them talking downstairs long into the night. Their voices fade as I drift off, dreading the upcoming party.

Adrian's smirk flashes in my mind.

This is going to be hell.
###Chapter 0007

The crisp winter air bit at my cheeks as Mother and I approached Ivy Sinclair's memorial. The sacred clearing held tributes to all our fallen warriors, but Ivy's stood tallest—a magnificent marble statue of a winged woman standing guard over her pack.

This week's offerings were winter blooms: crimson poinsettias, golden jasmine, delicate aconites, and clusters of snowdrops. Mother pressed her palm against the statue's clasped hands. "Thank you, Ivy," she murmured. "Your sacrifice is remembered."

We worked in comfortable silence, clearing frostbitten foliage, replacing it with fresh blossoms.

"Mother," I ventured, "have you ever met Evelyn?"

She paused, tucking a strand of silver-streaked hair behind her ear. "Of course, darling. Haven't you?"

I shook my head. "Never properly introduced. What's she like?"

"Brilliant. Reserved. Kind." Mother's fingers lingered on a snowdrop stem. "She has Ivy's bone structure but Grant's storm-gray eyes." A wistful smile tugged her lips. "Your father learned the hard way not to underestimate that woman."

My pruning shears stilled. "What?"

Mother chuckled, dusting snow from her knees. "During the Blackthorn-Nightshade tensions, your father tried benching Ivy—she was six months pregnant with Evelyn." Her laughter rang like wind chimes. "She challenged him to single combat. Pinned him in twelve minutes flat. Grant just leaned against the arena wall, grinning like a fool."

My jaw dropped. Father was the strongest Alpha in generations.

"The Nightshade Alpha surrendered when he saw our ranks included two fully operational Guardians," Mother continued. "Though Lucian Blackwood paid dearly for provoking us. When Cassian Nightshade killed him, he absorbed their territory... but lost Isolde in the process. Sebastian was only six."

A cold realization settled in my gut. Sebastian had shouldered the Nightshade Alpha mantle at sixteen after Cassian's grief-stricken decline. Meanwhile, I'd been learning trigonometry and sneaking beers with Donovan.

Mother's office smelled of bergamot and parchment—never a good sign. She poured two glasses of merlot.

"Adrian," she said, staring at the moonlit pines beyond her window. "I know about the girls."

Wine burned my throat. How?

Her reflection smirked in the glass. "Did you truly believe your Luna wouldn't notice her son turning his quarters into a brothel?"

I gripped the armrests.

"Darling," she turned, eyes softening, "when you find your mate—and you will on your birthday—those jealous little she-wolves will make her life hell." She sipped her wine. "At least bed outsiders. Spare your future Luna the humiliation."

Heat crawled up my neck. Seraphina Grey was everything a Luna should be—compassionate yet formidable. The thought of disappointing my own mate twisted something inside me.

"You're right," I rasped. "No more pack girls."

She kissed my forehead. "And for Goddess' sake, use protection. I want grandchildren, but not from some starry-eyed teenager."

"Mother!" I nearly upended my glass. "I'm not an idiot!"

Her laughter chased me down the hallway.
###Chapter 0008

The next morning at training, Alpha Alistair paired me against three of his warriors. I wasn’t worried. Dad had trained me to handle multiple attackers since I could walk. Two of them would be easy to take down. But Sebastian? That would take effort. Next to me and the ranked wolves, he was their best fighter. Smart, too—not just relying on brute strength like most warriors did with me. Sebastian studied his opponents, learned their weaknesses. He hadn’t found mine yet, but that didn’t stop him from trying.

I waited until they positioned me in the center of their triangle. I faced Sebastian, my biggest threat, while keeping the other two in my peripheral. He struck first, aiming a punch at my gut. I ducked under his arm, dropped to my knees, and slid toward Reginald—or "The Dick," as I liked to call him. My fist shot up between his legs, crushing his family jewels. He crumpled with a groan.

A rush of air near my head made me drop flat on my back, knees bent, feet planted. Julian’s leg swung where my head had just been. As his momentum carried him, I hooked my feet around his planted leg and twisted, yanking him down and dislocating his knee in the process. His howl of pain echoed across the field.

I flipped back up, ready for Sebastian. He watched me, calculating. I smirked and crooked my fingers, daring him forward. He feinted left, then swept low, trying to take out my legs. I leaped over him, spinning midair to deliver a roundhouse kick. He ducked, using the same move I’d just pulled on Julian. Clever bastard.

We traded blows, neither gaining the upper hand until I landed a sharp jab to his throat. In that split second of shock, I grabbed his arm, twisted it just shy of dislocation, and forced him to his knees. He tapped out before I could pop his shoulder. The squad erupted in applause. I hauled him up.

"Good fight, little hellion," he grinned, wiping sweat from his brow. "But I’m coming for you."

"I’d expect nothing less," I shot back as he helped Julian and Reginald limp toward the infirmary. Alpha Alistair gave me an approving nod.

The school day blurred past. I caught Adrian staring at me more than once but managed to avoid him—thanks in part to his ever-present entourage.

On the drive home, Nathaniel brought up our usual Friday night plans. Silver Fang, the local werewolf club, was our sanctuary. Nestled between Blackthorn and Nightshade territories, it was our place to unwind. I’d been going since I turned seventeen, and it was also where I met Alpha Sebastian.

We hadn’t put a label on whatever we were. Friends, but more. He knew I was waiting for my mate, so we weren’t friends with benefits, but he never pressured me. At twenty-four, he was older, wiser, and unlike a certain future alpha, he actually saw me. Respected me. Wanted me as his chosen mate. And if I was honest? Part of me hoped fate would agree.

After training with Dad, I scarfed down dinner and raced upstairs to get ready. Genevieve called to confirm our plans and hitch a ride. I told her Nathaniel was driving, and she promised to text him.

I slipped into a deep red corset top that laced up the back, paired with black skinny jeans and stiletto boots. My curls tumbled loose down my back, and I kept my makeup light—just a smoky eye to make my emerald gaze pop.

Nathaniel’s text buzzed as I headed downstairs. He was already outside with Genevieve and Julian in the car. I kissed Dad goodnight and climbed into the back.

"Hey, hellion," Julian teased. "Taken down any alphas today?"

"Not yet," I smirked. "But the night’s young."

Genevieve nudged me. "So… expecting a certain hot alpha tonight?"

I shrugged. Sebastian was an alpha with responsibilities. But lately, he’d made time for me—dancing, driving me home. Still, I never assumed.

"Put it this way," I said, "if I were betting? I’d say yes."

She fanned herself. "Girl, that man is fire. You need to—"

I laughed, cutting her off. Nathaniel’s eyes met mine in the rearview mirror. He was the only one who knew I was saving myself for my mate.

The club’s line stretched down the block, but as regulars, we bypassed it. The bouncer waved us in, earning grumbles from the crowd.

"Looking deadly, little hellion," he said as I passed.

I groaned. "Really? You too?"

He just grinned.

Inside, the bass pulsed through my bones. Werewolf clubs didn’t have drinking laws—our metabolism burned alcohol too fast to get drunk easily. We ordered shots first. I wasn’t here to drink; I was here to move.

As I tossed back the burning liquid, icy blue eyes locked onto mine from across the room.

Son of a bitch.

I slammed my glass down. "Adrian’s here."

Nathaniel followed my gaze and whistled low. "Think he’ll come over?"

"Don’t care," I said, grabbing Genevieve’s hand. "I’m dancing."

The music swallowed me whole. Eyes closed, body swaying, I lost myself in the rhythm. Most of the dancers were warriors from my pack, so I didn’t have to worry about unwanted advances. And everyone here knew Sebastian would show up eventually.

Genevieve leaned in. "Adrian hasn’t looked away since we hit the floor. What’s his deal?"

I shrugged. "He hit on me at school yesterday."

Her jaw dropped. "No way."

"Asked my name and pack."

Her eyes bugged. "How does he not know you?"

"Guess I’m not important enough," I said dryly.

She glanced between us, then smirked. "Team Sebastian all the way."

"Damn right."

We danced through several songs, switching partners, laughing. When the first slow song started, I motioned toward the bar. Genevieve followed, but not before shooting Adrian a pointed look.

His gaze burned into my back the entire way.
###Chapter 0009

All day at school, my eyes tracked her every move. I tried to approach her multiple times, but fate had other plans—either some girl dragged me into a conversation about tonight's dance, or by the time I reached her spot, she’d vanished. Never before had I been so frustrated by female attention. This mystery girl consumed my thoughts, and the fact that I couldn’t get close to her was driving me insane.

By the time I got home, my mood was foul. Training with the pack became my outlet. The warriors limped away afterward, grumbling under their breaths. I didn’t care. My irritation simmered beneath the surface.

Chase, however, was relentless. He insisted we hit the club tonight, already eyeing some redhead he planned to take home. Normally, I’d be game, but tonight? All I could think about was a certain green-eyed brunette. Theron, my wolf, had been unusually quiet, but his frustration mirrored mine.

I dressed in dark jeans and a fitted black shirt, then headed out with Chase. The bouncer let us skip the line, and we stepped into the pulsing heart of the club. The place was packed, bodies moving under neon lights.

We made it to the bar before a swarm of girls surrounded us. Chase bought drinks while I leaned against the wall, pretending to listen to their chatter. His redhead clung to him, while another girl—Natasha, I think—pressed against me like she was marking her territory. A third girl had one hand on my ass, the other stroking Natasha’s arm.

An invitation to a threesome. Normally, I’d be all in. Tonight? It felt desperate.

Then I saw her.

She was here. Laughing with three of my warriors—Nathaniel included. They didn’t look like a couple, but I couldn’t be sure.

Her gaze swept the room before locking onto mine. That electric jolt shot through me again. She quickly looked away, downed a shot, and turned to Nathaniel.

Theron growled in my head, his possessiveness flaring. Easy, I warned him. They’re just talking.

But then Nathaniel glanced at me.

They were talking about me.

A smirk tugged at my lips. Good. If she was discussing me, I was already in her head.

Natasha mistook my smile for encouragement and slid her hand under my shirt. I caught her wrist and pushed her away without a word. Unfazed, she leaned in closer.

Desperation reeked.

Then my mystery girl hit the dance floor with Genevieve. The moment the music pulsed, her hips swayed in perfect rhythm. Damn. She was fire. Theron paced inside me, agitated by the way every guy in the room watched her.

Genevieve whispered something to her. Her reply made Genevieve’s eyes widen before she shot me a disappointed look.

What the hell?

I was about to storm over when she headed back to the bar where Nathaniel and Julian stood.

"Excuse me, ladies," I muttered, pushing through the crowd. Chase noticed and fell into step beside me. "Everything okay?"

"I don’t know," I admitted. "But I’m finding out."

Chase smirked. "Need backup?"

"I’m good."

Every few steps, another girl stopped me. I brushed them off, but it took too long. By the time I reached the bar, she was downing another shot.

Then the DJ’s voice boomed: "This one’s for Blackthorn’s own Little Badass!"

The pack erupted. My warriors howled.

She froze, shook her head, then grinned when Who Runs the World blasted through the speakers. With a blown kiss to the DJ, she joined a group of girls in the center of the floor.

They owned the space, singing, sassing the guys, mimicking the music video’s choreography. I leaned against the bar, ordering another beer.

Alpha Sebastian appeared beside me, his gaze fixed on her. "She’s something, isn’t she?"

My grip tightened on my bottle. He knew her too?

"Yeah," I said casually, like I wasn’t the only one in the dark.

His smirk was infuriating. "Good. Maybe I still have a shot, then." He set his drink down as a slow song started. "That’s my cue."

I watched, jaw clenched, as he approached her.

Her smile for him stole my breath.

She slid her arms around his neck. His hands gripped her waist, pulling her flush against him. Theron snarled, clawing at my control.

Chase sidled up, his girl draped over him. "That her? With Alpha Sebastian?"

"Yeah," I gritted out.

Chase frowned. "You okay?"

No. I wasn’t.

They danced through multiple songs, lost in each other. When he finally led her toward the exit, my vision tinted red.

I moved to follow, but my warriors blocked me.

Sebastian—one of my best—stepped into my space. "What the hell, Alpha?"

Chase tensed beside me, ready for a fight.

Julian, who’d been with her earlier, spoke up. "You seriously don’t know who Evelyn Sinclair is?"

I scoffed. "Of course I know Evelyn Sinclair."

"Then why’d she tell Genevieve you had no clue?"

Ice flooded my veins.

No.

No, no, no.

My mystery girl—the one who hadn’t submitted, the one I’d insulted by not recognizing—was the Broken Warrior’s daughter.

My Guardian.
###Chapter 0010

The moment Alpha Adrian started moving toward the bar, I bolted for the dance floor. Just then, the DJ blasted Who Runs the World—dedicated to me. My pack warriors erupted in cheers. Little traitors. They were clearly trying to embarrass me. Joke’s on them. I owned that song alongside every fierce female warrior in the room. Genevieve and I led the charge, radiating pure attitude until the last beat. Then, like the queens we were, we howled our dominance to every male in earshot.

When I glanced up, Sebastian was watching me with that smoldering gaze. Goddess help me. Thank the stars for dark-wash jeans because the heat pooling between my thighs was undeniable.

I danced through two more upbeat tracks, acutely aware of Sebastian waiting for a slow song. The second the tempo dropped, he was on his way. The crowd parted for him like he was royalty. My breath hitched as those sage-green eyes locked onto mine—lighter than my own but burning with an intensity that sent my pulse racing.

His hands slid to my hips, pulling me flush against him as he buried his nose in my neck. "Hello, beautiful," he murmured against my ear, his breath hot. "Still saving yourself for me?" A purr escaped before I could stop it. "You know I'm waiting for my mate."

He leaned back just enough to smirk at me. "Exactly. Saving yourself for me." Cocky Alpha.

I melted into his arms, drowning in his scent—woodsmoke and something uniquely Sebastian. His strength, his humor, the way his body moved against mine... Everything about him was intoxicating.

"You look fucking stunning tonight," he growled, lips brushing my ear. "Did you wear this for me?" I tilted my head, flashing him a smirk. "Maybe."

A deep rumble vibrated through his chest, and damn if my lace thong wasn’t utterly useless now. He smirked, clearly noticing how my nipples pebbled against him. "Someone likes my growl."

"Perhaps," I teased, threading my fingers through his sandy blond curls. Short, because they turned wild when left unchecked. I scraped my nails lightly over his scalp, earning another possessive growl.

We swayed, oblivious to the music, lost in each other. His hard length pressed against me, and his grip tightened. "I love how you smell, Evelyn. But if you keep perfuming the air like this, I’ll have to drag you out of here. No one gets to scent your arousal but me."

I leaned up, lips grazing his ear. "Then maybe you should stop turning me on, Alpha."

The title triggered exactly what I wanted—a deeper, hungrier growl that shot straight to my core.

This was our dangerous game. I refused to lead him on, but something in my soul whispered he was my mate. And he knew my stance—I’d wait for fate. But he was a 24-year-old Alpha. Realistically, he wasn’t celibate. Yet if I asked him to wait? He would. That knowledge made the teasing even more delicious.

His growl had me dripping, and his nostrils flared. Without warning, he grabbed my hands and pulled me off the floor. "Don’t say I didn’t warn you."

Outside, winter air bit at my skin. Sebastian tucked me against his side. "Cold?"

"A little," I admitted. Werewolves handled chill better, but human forms had limits.

He lifted me into his Ford Raptor, draping his jacket over my legs. "Keep teasing me like that, mate or not, and you won’t leave my bed tonight." His gaze held mine, testing. When I didn’t rise to the bait, he kissed me quickly and shut the door.

The café was nearly empty. We slid into a booth, and Sebastian ordered steak while I opted for apple pie—knowing he’d steal half.

Then, out of nowhere, he took my hands. "Tell me your dreams, Evelyn."

Whoa. Heavy. I deflected with a smirk. "Romantic dinners. Beach walks. A man who dances and respects a strong woman."

His grin could’ve powered the sun. "Sounds like me."

When the waitress left, his expression turned serious. "I know you’re waiting for your mate. I respect that. But if it’s not me? I want you as my chosen mate." His voice dropped. "Even if you find him and hate him, I’m here. I’ll give you everything—respect, training, equality. Your strength doesn’t scare me; it turns me on. I’d protect our pups, but I know you’d gut anyone who threatened them." He squeezed my hands. "You’re it for me, Evelyn."

My throat tightened. "Sebastian, I..."

"Don’t answer. Just know I mean it."

The pie arrived, and I moaned around the first bite—cinnamon, apples, buttery crust. When I opened my eyes, Sebastian was frozen, steak halfway to his mouth. His eyes darkened. "One day," he growled, "I’ll be the reason you make those sounds. And I won’t stop until you’re screaming my name."

Heat flooded my cheeks.

Later, outside my door, he kissed me until my knees buckled. Selene pushed forward, purring to Dorian. His wolf’s gravelly voice replied, sparking a fresh wave of desire.

Sebastian pulled back, forehead against mine. "Dream of me, Evelyn."

As he drove away, a lone wolf howled in the distance.

###Chapter 0011

I storm out of the club, my mind racing. The crisp night air does nothing to cool the fire burning inside me. Every step toward Blackthorn Packhouse feels heavier than the last. How could I have been so blind? Evelyn Sinclair wasn't just some quiet girl tending to her father. She was my mystery woman all along.

Theron growls in my head, his voice laced with possessiveness. 'She belongs to us.' My jaw clenches in agreement.

The realization hits me like a truck. As a Guardian and daughter of two legendary Guardians, Evelyn would naturally be formidable. Why hadn't I seen it? We're the same age - we must have shared classes for years. Yet I only truly noticed her days ago.

She never fawned over me like the others. Never played their games. No, she saved her attention for Sebastian. And he took everything she offered.

When we reach the packhouse, I don't bother going inside. The forest calls to me. I shift before my clothes hit the ground, letting Theron take control. We race toward the Sinclair residence.

Through the mind-link, I confirm my patrols only circle the perimeter. Good. No witnesses tonight.

Five miles vanish beneath our paws. As we near their property, her scent wraps around me - vanilla and lavender, intoxicating. The house is dark, but the training setup in the backyard tells its own story. Obstacle courses. Weights. A separate structure that must be an indoor facility. No wonder I never saw her at pack training - her father was handling it personally.

Theron prowls the tree line, restless. Only one heartbeat inside. Evelyn's still out.

'Control yourself,' I warn as he starts growling. 'We can't alert Grant.' He huffs but settles down to wait.

Hours pass. No sign of her. My gut twists. Did she stay with Sebastian at Nightshade? Would her father allow that?

Just as I resign myself to an all-night vigil, headlights cut through the trees. A truck rolls up - Sebastian's.

My blood turns to ice when the passenger door opens. That scent. Theron surges to his feet with a rumble that nearly gives us away.

Sebastian's head snaps toward the trees. I force Theron silent, though his snarls echo painfully in my skull.

Then I see them. His arms around her. His whispered words. What promises did he make? She's not eighteen yet - she can't know I'm her mate. Is he planning to claim her the moment she comes of age?

The strategy is obvious. Nightshade is already the largest pack. With a Guardian Luna? They'd be unstoppable.

But when their lips meet, something worse becomes clear. This isn't just politics. Their wolves respond too. There's real feeling here.

On both sides.

###Chapter 0012

Theron was nearly feral, his growls vibrating through my skull. "I don't give a damn. I'll tear him apart! She belongs to us. I'll claim Evelyn even if I have to rip Dorian's throat out."

I barely kept him in check. The last thing Blackthorn Pack needed was a blood feud with Nightshade.

Forcing the shift, I took human form and sprinted toward the packhouse. Theron raged inside me, claws scraping at my control. "Theron!" I snapped, skidding to a halt. "We're not starting a war because you've decided she's ours. If she's truly our mate, the bond will draw her to us. But if we scare her—or worse, hurt her—she'll never forgive us."

That finally silenced him.

I grabbed shorts from one of the hidden stashes near the tree line and slipped in through the back entrance. The packhouse doors were always open—warriors trained at all hours, patrols cycled through for meals, and omegas worked around the chaos.

The kitchen light was on.

My mother stood there in my father's oversized shirt, her hair disheveled, assembling two sandwiches. I didn’t want to think about why.

"Hey, Mom." I grabbed a water bottle, hoping to escape fast.

"Adrian!" She beamed. "Good run?"

"Great," I lied. "Heading to bed."

"Wait—" She wiped her hands. "I forgot to tell you at the memorial. I invited Evelyn to your birthday party. I know we usually invite the whole pack, but you mentioned never meeting her. Your father strongly encouraged her attendance." Her smile turned sly. "And her father’s."

A plan ignited in my mind. Perfect.

"Thanks, Mom." I grinned. "I’ve been meaning to get to know everyone better. Dad’s lectures about pack unity finally stuck."

We said goodnight, and I took the stairs two at a time. Donovan was on the third-floor landing, saying goodbye to a redhead. As I passed, I mind-linked him. "Find me tomorrow. We need to talk."

He pulled back, frowning. "Everything okay, Alpha?"

"It will be."

The next morning, I cornered my father in his office. Confirmed: Evelyn trained with him every morning, even weekends. Her afternoons were reserved for private sessions with Gregory.

Then I tracked down my mother.

"I want the party set up near the training grounds," I said. "And make sure Evelyn’s seated at my table."

She lit up. "You think she’s your mate?"

"Maybe."

She clapped her hands. "Consider it done."

Finally, I met Donovan by the east gate. I laid out the plan—subtle but unmistakable. A statement to the pack.

He whistled. "You’re basically marking your territory. Everyone will know what it means."

I smirked. "Exactly."

"Then let’s make it happen." He punched my shoulder. "You know I’ve got your back."

I did. That’s why he was my Beta.

###Chapter 0013

The moment I stepped away from Sebastian, my body was on fire. That man was pure temptation wrapped in leather. Thank the moon my father was already asleep when I got home. I stripped off my clothes and slid between the sheets naked—no point wearing pajamas when I planned to take care of this unbearable tension before my few hours of sleep.

My fingers traced circles over my breasts, teasing my nipples until they peaked. The memory of Sebastian's growl sent a fresh wave of heat through me. One hand drifted lower, stroking my clit in slow, deliberate motions. I bit my lip, imagining the hard press of his body against mine while we danced. A soft whimper escaped me as I pictured his mouth claiming mine, that dominant kiss that left me breathless.

Then my mind betrayed me.

Suddenly, it wasn’t Sebastian between my thighs—it was Adrian.

I froze.

What the hell? Adrian? No. Absolutely not. This fantasy was about Sebastian. I shook my head sharply, forcing myself back to the memory of Sebastian’s kiss, his skilled tongue—

But the image of Adrian’s ice-blue eyes flickered behind my eyelids. That thick, dark hair brushing against my inner thighs as he pinned me down with one strong hand. The thought of his growl vibrating against my skin sent me spiraling into the most intense orgasm I’d ever had. I barely muffled my cry with my free hand, my body trembling through the aftershocks.

What. Just. Happened?

When my alarm blared hours later, I dragged myself out of bed feeling like I’d been hit by a truck. Warrior training was brutal, but thankfully, most of the pack was just as exhausted from last night’s festivities.

Weekends with my father meant two things: endurance training and deadly botany lessons. Knowing which plants could kill a werewolf—or worse—wasn’t just useful; it was survival. Witches existed, sure, but finding one who wouldn’t curse you for fun was like stumbling upon a unicorn. Better to rely on my own knowledge.

Exhausted didn’t even begin to cover it, but weakness wasn’t an option.

"Push through, Evelyn," my father said, tossing the 250-pound dummy into the pool. "An Alpha doesn’t get the luxury of fatigue."

For two grueling hours, I treaded water, keeping the dummy afloat while he drilled me on toxic plants, symptoms, and antidotes. By the time we finished, my muscles screamed. A long, scalding bath was the only mercy I allowed myself before collapsing into bed again.

But even as I closed my eyes, one thought lingered:

Why couldn’t I stop thinking about Adrian?

###Chapter 0014

Sunday was just as exhausting as Saturday. Instead of swimming, I had to run. Marathon day meant pushing through 26.2 miles in two and a half hours. By Sunday night, I finished my homework and braced myself for another grueling week.

Monday arrived like any other morning. My turn to drive meant picking up Nathaniel on the way. We split up for first period. From the corner of my eye, I spotted Adrian watching me. He didn’t follow me today, and I was grateful. After what happened Saturday morning—thanks to him—I couldn’t face him without my cheeks burning. Just the memory made me cringe.

The day passed smoothly until lunch. Nathaniel and Genevieve met me in the cafeteria. While Nathaniel went to grab food, I unpacked my leftovers. The room suddenly hushed. A delivery guy walked in, holding a dozen white roses.

Lucky girl, whoever she was.

The delivery guy scanned the room, then asked for directions. A student pointed straight at me.

What the hell?

"Evelyn Sinclair?" he asked, stopping at our table.

I frowned at the flowers. "Yes?" It came out more confused than certain.

"These are for you."

"Who sent them?"

"There's a card. Enjoy."

I stared at the roses, stunned, until Nathaniel nudged me. "Read it."

I opened the card:

Evelyn,
Roses are white.
Guardians are true.
Can you guess who I am?
Or will I have to tell you?

Your Secret Admirer

Nathaniel leaned over my shoulder. "Damn. You’ve got a secret admirer?"

I glanced between the card and the flowers, as if they held answers.

"Apparently."

Genevieve sighed dramatically. "That’s so romantic! Who could it be?"

"No idea," I muttered. "Seriously, who?"

They both shrugged.

Great. Now I had to carry these around for my last two classes. As if I didn’t already stand out enough. Whispers followed me down the hall. If Sebastian didn’t send these, he’d hear about it.

Was it him? He’d basically declared his feelings Friday night. But this didn’t seem like his style. The flowers, maybe—but not the cryptic note.

I scanned the room, searching for guilty looks. Instead, I locked eyes with Adrian. Of course he was smirking. I resisted the urge to roll my eyes, grabbed my things, and headed to class.

As I left the cafeteria, I called over my shoulder, "If you’re here—thanks. I’ll figure it out."

Behind me, I swore I heard a deep, amused chuckle.

###Chapter 0015

The entire Sunday was dedicated to strategizing. Donovan is fully committed and even managed to gather some intel for me. I'm feeling confident about the upcoming week. Everything will come together on my birthday, and I can only pray it's enough time to get closer to Evelyn.

Monday arrives with an early start. I've never witnessed Evelyn's training sessions, and now that I've connected the face to the name, my curiosity is piqued. Risking looking like a stalker, I position myself in a second-floor guest room of the pack house that offers a clear view of the training grounds where my father drills the warriors.

The room remains dark as I silently crack open the window. Warriors begin trickling out, stretching and warming up. She hasn't arrived yet. Just as I settle in to wait, movement catches my eye near the tree line.

A magnificent russet wolf emerges from the forest, a duffel bag clamped between her jaws. Selene. Evelyn must run here from her home every morning. No wonder she's always so prepared - a five-mile warmup would put anyone in peak condition.

I watch as she disappears behind a tree and reemerges in leggings, an oversized hoodie, and sneakers. Her curly hair is pulled into a messy ponytail, the short strands spiraling in every direction. My breath hitches. She's breathtaking.

Her scent reaches me as she joins the other warriors, and an immediate calm washes over me.

"Morning, Firecracker," Sebastian greets her with a fist bump.

"Call me that again and you'll be eating dirt before warmups are over," she counters without missing a beat.

The warriors chuckle, continuing their stretches. If I hadn't realized it Friday when several of my men were ready to defend her honor, it's crystal clear now - they respect her immensely. She's one of them. And I'm dying to see her skills firsthand.

For the next two hours, I'm treated to a masterclass. Evelyn dismantles every opponent with terrifying efficiency, like a hurricane tearing through a field of wheat.

I can't wipe the grin off my face. She's phenomenal - lightning fast, impossibly agile, and a tactical genius. Sebastian proves to be her toughest match. He's an excellent fighter, relying on strategy rather than brute strength, constantly probing for weaknesses.

Yet against Evelyn, he comes up empty-handed.

Their banter is constant. This must be their dynamic - equal parts competition and camaraderie. Sebastian's always been a trash-talker, but Evelyn seems to reserve her verbal sparring mainly for him.

When training concludes, I linger, hoping to catch another glimpse of Selene. What I don't expect is to see my father walking Evelyn to the forest's edge, his arm draped over her shoulders like she's his own daughter.

The sight is jarring. The only person I've ever seen him show affection to is my mother. They exchange words before he kisses the top of her head - a gesture so uncharacteristic it leaves me stunned.

As Selene emerges from the trees, she lets out a playful bark. My father turns, waves, and heads inside while she takes off toward home in that effortless loping gait.

Suddenly aware of the time, I rush through a shower and grab my things. I'm nearly late, barreling down the stairs and into the kitchen when I collide with Donovan at the landing.

"Whoa there, Adrian! Brought you breakfast," he says, holding out a paper bag. "Figured you'd need it after your...observations this morning."

"You're a lifesaver," I say, grabbing the food. "Everything set for today?"

"Locked and loaded," he confirms as we head out.

The game is afoot.

###Chapter 0016

I dial the florist with a grin. "Just confirming the lunchtime delivery."

Donovan grabs his keys. "I'll drive while you handle the details."

This secret admirer move might be cheesy, but it's necessary. Evelyn needs to know these aren't from Alpha Sebastian.

Lunchtime crawls toward me like molasses. The second the bell rings, I'm out of my seat. Front row observation is non-negotiable—her reaction determines whether my entire week's plan gets scrapped.

Donovan fetches our food while I stake out our usual table. Evelyn enters with Nathaniel and Genevieve. My stomach twists. No backup plans exist—if she tosses those flowers, I'm screwed.

The cafeteria buzz fades to silence.

A delivery guy scans the crowd, overwhelmed. I gave him Evelyn's description, but two hundred shifters pack this room.

Then I see it—the moment her lips curve. Bullseye.

The guy approaches, confirms her identity, and presents the bouquet. Her smile falters into confusion. When she asks who sent them, he follows my script perfectly: "Check the card."

I paid triple to ensure flawless execution. Mom's florist friend nailed it.

Nathaniel nudges her to open the card. Her bewilderment lingers, and I can't suppress my smirk.

Mission accomplished:

Total surprise? ✔
Making her feel cherished? ✔
Broadcasting that she's being pursued? ✔✔
Genevieve swoons predictably, demanding details they don't have. Donovan elbows me under the table, flashing a covert thumbs-up.

Evelyn's gaze sweeps the room—then locks onto mine. Sweetheart, this is just the beginning. Pink floods her cheeks, sending heat straight to my groin. I shift, jeans suddenly restrictive.

She gathers the flowers and exits. I'm about to resume eating when her parting words hit me.

Game. On.

After school, I visit Celestia—the most exclusive restaurant in three counties. The owner nods through my meticulous instructions. Perfection isn't optional.

Donovan covers my training slack this week. I change quickly, joining the last hour. Extra workouts will compensate, but it's worth it. Seven days to stake my claim—I'm using every second.

Mom confirms she'll handle her part tomorrow. I collapse into bed, replaying Evelyn's smile until sleep takes me.

Adrian Grey

Has your opinion of me shifted? Drop a comment—I'm dying to know.

###Chapter 0017

The school bell finally rings. I help Nathaniel with his books before heading home, still carrying those mysterious flowers that brightened my entire afternoon. No one's ever surprised me like this before. My mind keeps racing through possibilities, but the list is endless. The mystery remains, but I'm far from giving up.

Dad's voice greets me before I even close the door. "There's my girl! How was your... wait, what's this?" His eyes lock onto the bouquet in my arms.

"These?" I play dumb, flashing him an exaggerated innocent look. "Just some flowers from a secret admirer." I can't help admiring them again.

"White roses," he observes. "You know what they symbolize, right?"

I blink in confusion. "Colors have meanings?"

"Absolutely. White represents purity and devotion."

"Well, they know I'm a Guardian, so devotion fits. As for purity..." I waggle my eyebrows suggestively, making us both laugh.

"Go change for training, Evie. Meet me outside in five."

Later, I find myself staring at the roses, puzzling over who could have sent them.

My phone buzzes with a text from Sebastian.

Sebastian: Heard I've got competition.

Me: Only if you consider owing me flowers competition.

Sebastian: Mmm. Someone's marking territory, Evelyn.

Me: They're flowers, not a mating proposal. Did you know colors have meanings?

Sebastian: Specifically roses. White symbolizes innocence and purity.

Me: Dad said devotion and purity. They clearly know I'm a Guardian.

Sebastian: If you need help with that purity situation, you know where to find me.

Damn him. Just the suggestion has me squirming. I need to change the subject fast.

Me: If you're my mate, all of me belongs to you anyway.

The reply takes longer than usual.

Sebastian: Cold shower time. Go to bed, Evelyn. Sweet dreams... of me.

Me: Goodnight, Sebastian.

Training the next morning is brutal - not from the exercises, but from the constant teasing. Every warrior wants to know about my mystery admirer, offering to "handle" the situation if needed. These conversations help me eliminate most suspects - they're like brothers to me. Only one name remains: Donovan.

At school, I'm on high alert, scanning every face for clues. By lunchtime, frustration sets in as nothing stands out. Nathaniel joins me in the cafeteria line when a sharply dressed woman in designer heels approaches.

"Evelyn Sinclair?"

I eye her warily. "Yes?"

"Perfect." She gestures to a cart with a silver-domed platter and other elegant place settings.

"Lead the way to your usual table," she instructs.

I don't move. "What exactly is this?"

"Your lunch, of course."

"I didn't order anything special."

"It was ordered for you." Her smile doesn't waver.

"By who?"

"There's a card, but I can't give it to you until you're seated."

Right. Mysterious much?

I head to my usual spot with Nathaniel gaping beside me. Genevieve materializes at my side, linking arms. "What's happening?"

"Apparently someone sent me lunch."

Her eyebrow arches. "Who?"

I shrug. "Your guess is as good as mine. No card until after I'm eating."

We reach the table and I turn to the hostess. "Your name?"

"Theodora."

"Theodora, this is my spot." I start to set down my bag.

"One moment please." She stops me, and I pull my bag back, exchanging confused glances with my friends.

###Chapter 0018

Theodora produces a black tablecloth that looks straight out of a five-star restaurant and drapes it over the cafeteria table. She sets a single place with crisp linen napkins and polished silverware. I take my seat as she places the domed plate before me.

"Your beverage options include coffee, tea, or soda," she announces with professional grace.

"Soda, please, Theodora."

Her lips curve as she pours me a glass of sparkling soda, then adds a smaller dessert plate to the setting. "Complimentary sweets," she explains before asking, "Anything else I can get for you?"

"Was there... a note?"

Reaching into her apron pocket, she hands me an ivory envelope. "When you're finished, just leave everything. I'll return to collect it." With a nod, she exits the suddenly silent cafeteria.

"Thanks."

The entire room has gone still. Every shifter has stopped mid-motion, their attention locked on me. The lunch line remains empty. From the back, someone shouts, "Well? Show us what you got!"

I lift the silver dome.

The aroma hits me first - seared filet mignon and butter-poached lobster tail, accompanied by truffle mashed potatoes and charred asparagus. My jaw drops as the scent washes over the room, eliciting simultaneous groans from every shifter present. A ramekin of clarified butter sits beside a perfect quenelle of herb butter - for the potatoes or asparagus, I'm not sure which.

Nathaniel's voice comes out unusually breathless. "What does the card say?" Meanwhile, Genevieve - who hasn't blinked at my plate - reaches over to physically close my gaping mouth.

I snap my teeth together and unfold the heavy stationery.

Evelyn,

Soon, I hope you'll allow me the honor of a proper courtship -

To indulge your every culinary desire and romantic whim.

Providing for our mates is the wolf's most sacred privilege.



Thus, I present this humble offering,

As proof of my honorable intentions.

Yours in devotion,

Your Secret Admirer

I read it three times. Selene surges forward in my consciousness - this message isn't just for me, but for her. For a male wolf, demonstrating the ability to provide is the ultimate declaration of serious courtship. This isn't just lunch; it's a statement.

Holy hell. Sebastian was right. Whoever sent this is making his intentions crystal clear.

Nathaniel whistles low, reading over my shoulder. "Damn." He drags out the word as I keep staring at the elegant script.

"Sweetheart, if you're not eating that, I will," Genevieve threatens, practically salivating. "And if you are, for the love of the Moon Goddess, eat it before it gets cold!"

"You can't touch it, Gen," Nathaniel murmurs, still focused on the card in my hands.

"What? Why?" She snatches the note, her eyes widening as she scans it. "Moon's blood! That's... intense. Even Phoebe's vibrating right now." She means her wolf spirit. I meet her gaze. "Right?"

Genevieve arches an eyebrow. "Selene? Thoughts?"

I can feel my eyes glowing with my wolf's presence. Selene's voice purrs through me, "I intend to savor every bite of this courtship gift."

Silverware in hand, I take my first bite. My eyes flutter shut of their own accord, a moan escaping my lips.

"Really? Rub it in!" someone yells across the room.

"Sorry not sorry," I call back. "This is too incredible not to react."

"Gonna share?" another voice pleads.

"Not happening," I declare as Selene strengthens my voice. "And before anyone gets ideas about challenging me for it - remember who you're dealing with."

Grumbles fill the air as shifters edge closer than necessary, nostrils flaring. "Goddess above, is that from Celestia?" a wide-eyed sophomore asks. "It looks like Celestia's signature plating."

I glance at her. "No idea - never been. But I can confirm it's divine."

A senior I don't recognize steps up. "Definitely Celestia. Whoever sent this dropped serious cash to impress you. And unless I'm mistaken, that was Theodora Laurent - she owns the place."

###Chapter 0019

My mind races. The OWNER? Who has that kind of influence? It narrows things down—someone with status, a relative, or someone who called in a favor. That last option opens up possibilities again. There's no way I could guess who might have leverage over the owner.

I finish my meal and lift the lid off the smaller plate. The rich aroma of chocolate hits me instantly. Not just any chocolate—these are Celestia's famous brownies, my absolute weakness. Either this person got lucky or they know me disturbingly well.

Every bite is heaven, but I eat until I'm uncomfortably full. The bell rings, signaling the end of lunch. Gathering my things, I hesitate over the leftovers. I've arranged them neatly, but where do they go?

Theodora appears, starting to clear the table.

I smile at her. "Thank you. The food was incredible. I heard you're the owner?"

She turns with a warm smile. "That's correct, Ms. Sinclair. My mate and I own Celestia."

My pulse jumps. "Then you know who ordered this for me?"

Her smile turns knowing. "I do. And before you ask—no, I won't tell you."

My smile falters, but I press on. "What if I ask something else? Like—is it a family member?"

"Not someone I'm related to."

"Did they owe you a favor?"

"No. I did this because I appreciate romance."

"Can you at least tell me which pack they're from?"

She shakes her head. "Sorry. I was instructed not to reveal anything—no pack, rank, or status that might give them away."

I sigh. "Well, thank you for what you did share. And again, the food was amazing. Please compliment the chef."

"I'll tell Leopold you loved his cooking." She chuckles as she finishes clearing the table.

Stepping out of the cafeteria, I collide with something solid—Adrian's chest.

I stumble back, meeting those distracting eyes.

"CELESTIA, huh? What's the occasion?"

Ugh. Not in the mood for my future Alpha today. "Not that it concerns you, but someone sent me lunch."

"Flowers yesterday, Celestia today. Someone's making a very public claim on one of my pack members."

"Your FUTURE pack," I correct, pushing past him. He keeps pace effortlessly.

"So who's the lucky guy?"

"No idea."

"Come on, you must have some clue."

"None."

"And you're okay with that? Some stranger publicly claiming you?"

I shrug. "I'll figure it out. It's not like he'll stay secret forever. And I plan to uncover his identity long before he reveals it."

"Maybe it's Alpha Sebastian. I saw you two at the club."

"Nope. Not him."

"How do you know?"

"First, he wouldn't call himself a secret admirer. Second, he texted me last night asking about the flowers. So no, not him."

Adrian smirks. "Looks like we've got ourselves a high school mystery."

I reach my classroom and turn to him. "I WILL find out who he is."

As the door closes behind me, I swear I hear him mutter, "Good luck with that."

###Chapter 0020

Dawn barely breaks when I'm already awake.

Not ready to join the warriors' brutal training sessions yet, but I can't resist watching her.

I slip into the guest room and crack open the window just as her wolf streaks along the treeline.

Minutes later, she emerges in workout gear, heading straight for the training grounds.

The warriors immediately tease her about the flowers.

She deflects their jokes effortlessly, shutting down their suggestions about getting rid of me.

Theron growls possessively in my mind. 'Let them try.'

Today's sparring matches mirror yesterday's - except this time, she fights in wolf form.

Her wolf is smaller than mine but moves with lethal grace.

Theron practically vibrates with longing to meet her.

After training, I watch her wolf disappear into the woods before rushing to get ready for school.

Donovan waits downstairs with my breakfast.

"Thanks. I owe you big time for covering for me."

He punches my shoulder. "No sweat. Yesterday was entertaining. Ready for today's big move?"

Fuck yes, I'm nervous.

This could go spectacularly right or catastrophically wrong.

Theron howls at the mere thought of rejection.

'She'll accept. Our gift honors her wolf. Nothing speaks louder than this offering.'

'You're absolutely certain? No take-backs once we do this.'

'She's ours. I'll move mountains to prove it.'

The morning drags, my stomach twisting tighter with each passing hour.

By lunchtime, I'm fighting nausea.

Theron stays uncharacteristically silent as I enter the cafeteria early.

Theodora spots me instantly.

She gives the slightest nod before focusing on the entrance.

When Evelyn walks in, our plan springs into action.

The entire room falls silent as Theodora approaches Evelyn's table with the elaborate lunch setup.

Evelyn looks stunned, then asks for the card.

My palms sweat. This is the moment.

The cafeteria collectively groans as the food's aroma fills the air.

Donovan appears beside me, silent support radiating from him.

Evelyn reads the card.

For a heartbeat, nothing happens.

Then - sunlight erupts behind her emerald eyes as her wolf surfaces.

That golden glow only Guardian wolves possess.

She's discussing it with Nathaniel. Genevieve snatches the card, her own wolf rising to read it.

I hear Phoebe ask Selene's opinion.

Selene. Now I know her wolf's name.

Then - victory.

Theron's triumphant howl shakes my skull.

She accepted.

###Chapter 0021

"Perfect move, Alpha! You nailed it!" Donovan mind-links me, careful not to reveal the gift is from me.

A grin spreads across my face before I can stop it. Euphoria rushes through me, heady and intoxicating. Nothing in my life has ever felt as significant as this moment.

I watch as Evelyn takes her first bite, and the soft moan that escapes her lips sends a jolt straight to my groin. Damn.

But it's her next words that have me fully hard—her and Selene threatening anyone who dares touch her meal. My heart swells, and Theron practically rolls over in submission, his satisfaction radiating through me.

People pause, drawn by the scent of her food. It smells incredible, making the sandwich Donovan grabbed for me taste like sawdust. When she finishes, she reaches for the brownies.

Gregory had mentioned offhand that he often takes Beatrice’s brownies to his meetings with Mr. Sinclair because Evelyn adores them. So, I asked my mother to bake a batch, and I dropped them off at Theodora’s place this morning.

The moment Evelyn bites into the brownie, her eyes flutter shut in bliss. My mind conjures an image of her making that same face while riding me, her body tightening around me as she comes, crying out my name.

Now I’m dangerously close to losing control right here in the cafeteria. Desperate for a distraction, I tune into the nearby chatter. A few she-wolves are making thinly veiled comments about Evelyn not deserving this kind of attention.

Good. Their petty jealousy does the trick—shifting my arousal into irritation. She’s worth every effort, and not just because she’s a Guardian. Though that alone would be reason enough. She’s brilliant, fierce, the best warrior in my squad, and devoted to her father.

I’m about to shut them down when I hear Evelyn questioning Theodora about who sent the food. My pulse spikes. Theodora answers flawrably, exactly as I instructed.

An idea strikes. I bolt from the cafeteria before Evelyn can leave.

She’s distracted when she steps out, so it’s easy to position myself in her path. She collides with me, and—hell—now I’m hard again.

Her emerald eyes lock onto mine, no longer glowing with Selene’s gold. My cock throbs painfully against my zipper.

I need to know if she understands what this means—that I’m claiming her. So I steer the conversation there, pressing for an answer. When she deflects, I ask the other question burning in my chest: Does she realize it’s not Sebastian doing this for her?

Her snarky reply sends a thrill through me. Bonus—Sebastian will hear about yesterday’s incident. As an Alpha, he’ll recognize exactly what this means.

Competition.

When she confidently declares she’ll figure me out, I can’t help but murmur, "Good luck with that," under my breath as I stride toward the nearest bathroom.

Not ideal, but desperate times call for desperate measures.

After school, I finalize tomorrow’s surprise—something she’ll love, something romantic, and something that makes a statement.

I make it home in time for warrior training and push myself harder than usual. I challenge every fighter, testing the endurance Evelyn displays daily. By the last match, I’m drenched in sweat and barely standing.

On the walk back, I overhear one of my warriors grumbling about getting their ass kicked by Evelyn in the morning and me in the afternoon.

The high of the day lingers through dinner. As I drift off to sleep, all I see are Evelyn’s emerald eyes, flecked with Selene’s gold.

###Chapter 0022

The school bell rang, signaling the end of another exhausting day. I dropped Nathaniel off at his place before heading home alone. The moment I stepped through the front door, my father Grant gave me that knowing smirk. "No mysterious gifts today, Evelyn?"

My expression must have betrayed my turmoil because his smile vanished instantly. "Sweetheart?"

I collapsed onto the living room couch, exhaling sharply. Then I told him everything about the extravagant lunch delivered to me. His low whistle cut through the tension as he studied me carefully. "That could mean several things, Evelyn."

Wordlessly, I handed him the note. His eyes scanned the message, then lingered on it just as mine had. "Well, that removes all ambiguity. What did Selene think? I imagine she was quite pleased?"

"Ecstatic," I snorted. "Finally getting the worship she believes is her birthright."

Evander surged forward as my father's emerald eyes flashed brighter. "She's a Guardian and my cub. Any male should consider himself honored to court her. This is precisely the respect a Guardian and my daughter merits." His gravelly tone left no room for argument.

Grant wrestled control back from Evander, and we exchanged an exasperated look. Our wolves could be... overly proud sometimes. "Any leads on your secret admirer?" he asked, changing topics.

"None whatsoever. I eliminated most trainees this morning when they mocked me about yesterday's flowers."

"Could it be Alpha Sebastian?" His knowing look told me he'd noticed our flirtations, though I hadn't mentioned our private conversation Friday night. My feelings about that encounter remained unresolved.

"Doubtful. He actually texted me last night after hearing about the flowers. Pretty sure it's not him."

"Oh! The owner of Celestia personally delivered my meal today." Another whistle from Grant. He stroked his chin thoughtfully. "Might be Alpha Adrian."

I doubled over laughing until my sides ached. "Dad, hate to disappoint you, but Alpha Adrian doesn't even recognize me."

His eyebrow arched in silent question.

"Last week he literally asked my name and which pack I belonged to."

A growl rumbled through the room - whether from Grant or Evander, I couldn't tell. I quickly intervened before this reached Alpha Alistair's ears. "It's fine, Dad. He'll remember eventually."

After training and dinner, I was finishing homework when my phone buzzed. Sebastian's name flashed on the screen. I sighed - this confrontation was inevitable.

"Good evening, Sebastian. What brings this unexpected call?"

"I believe you know exactly why I'm calling, Evelyn. Yesterday you claimed it was 'just flowers, not a romantic dinner.'"

"Well... technically it wasn't dinner," I hedged awkwardly. How could I explain when I didn't understand it myself?

"Shall I join you for lunch tomorrow?" Even through the phone, his possessive energy pulsed - an Alpha sensing competition for his intended mate. His patience had limits, and now he perceived a rival.

"Don't trouble yourself, Sebastian. Surely you have better things to do than eat cafeteria food."

"Selene accepted the tribute." His statement required no confirmation, but I answered anyway. "Yes."

The prolonged silence made me wonder if he'd crushed his phone in anger. "Sebastian?"

"I'll see you soon, Evelyn." The abrupt click left me staring at the darkened screen.

I decided to turn in early. Opening my window to the warm night air, I lay awake analyzing the implications. Selene now had two wolves vying for her - which meant two Alphas claiming me. My wolf practically vibrated with satisfaction at the thought.

'Are you insane? One of them could seriously hurt the other!'

'Only if the challenger isn't also an Alpha.' The image of two dominant males fighting over her sent Selene into such intense purring I expected the bed to shake.

For me, the terrifying possibility remained - what if neither was my destined mate? Would there eventually be three wolves battling for me?

'We could call it "The Alpha Games" or "Luna's Choice." Maybe "Guardian's Conquest?"' Selene suggested unhelpfully.

'For moon's sake! Our duty is to maintain peace, not start wars!'

'Human emotions. In our world, only the strongest claims the female. This is natural.' Her calm certainty infuriated me.

Rolling over, I punched my pillow. I needed to uncover my secret admirer's identity before this escalated further.

The question haunted me as sleep finally claimed me: What if this courtship wasn't about affection at all, but pack politics? If Adrian had learned about Sebastian's interest, might this be his way of ensuring I remained with Blackthorn Pack?

Moon goddess help us all - two Alphas preparing to war over a Luna? History showed such conflicts devastated entire regions. And the terrifying truth? Selene would happily watch them destroy each other for the chance to choose the victor.

###Chapter 0023

The morning sun painted the sky in soft hues as I pulled up to Nathaniel's house. He slid into the passenger seat with his usual grin.

"Place your bets," he said immediately. "What's today's grand gesture?"

I rolled my eyes. "You're assuming there will be one."

"Please, Evelyn. After yesterday's spectacle? That man isn't done marking his territory."

A shiver ran down my spine. "Fine. What's your prediction?"

"No idea. But I do know the entire school will be crammed into the cafeteria at lunch, waiting for the show."

Perfect. Exactly what I didn't need.

As we parked, Nathaniel turned to me. "Still no leads on who it is?"

"None. But someone's running a betting pool. Find out who's topping that list—might help narrow it down."

"Consider it done."

The school hummed with whispers all morning. My secret admirer had become the hottest gossip. Did these people have nothing better to do?

When the lunch bell rang, my stomach twisted. Part of me dreaded Adrian making another appearance—especially after yesterday. The other part? Annoyed anticipation.

I stepped into the cafeteria. Every head turned. Conversations halted mid-sentence.

Silence.

Then, as if on cue, murmurs resumed when nothing happened. I grabbed my food and sat down, oddly... disappointed.

Then—

A hush.

Four older wolves strode in, dressed in classic barbershop quartet attire: striped vests, crisp white shirts, and those ridiculous little hats.

My lips curved. He hadn't let me down.

A harmonica note pierced the air. They launched into a song—You're a Heavenly Thing—complete with rose petals showering over me when they sang about "sprinkled roses." I laughed as they pantomimed throwing something away.

But the finale?

"You're all mine, all mine."

A statement. A claim.

The room erupted in applause. One man handed me an envelope before they exited.

Inside, the note read:

Evelyn,
Let me be clear—I intend to make you mine.
Fate hasn't spoken yet, but I'll wait.
Because I know you'll be mine.
My heavenly thing.

-Patiently yours, Your Secret Admirer

Selene preened under the attention.

Nathaniel peered over my shoulder. "Well. That's not subtle."

"No kidding." I exhaled sharply. "Who is this guy? This is either bold or reckless."

"Considering how often Selene's been front and center lately? He's doing something right."

I shot Sebastian a text about the quartet. No reply.

Later, Nathaniel delivered the betting pool's top contenders: Adrian, Donovan, Sebastian, and—I choked—Nathaniel himself.

"Very funny."

"Hey, I had to try."

That left Adrian and Donovan as real possibilities.

Training with Dad was brutal as ever. Paralyzed from the waist down, he still matched me rep for rep on upper body exercises. The Broken Warrior? More like the Unbreakable.

Back in my room, the flowers' scent lingered. Still no word from Sebastian. I left it alone.

That night, wolves battled in my dreams—Adrian and Sebastian, bloody and snarling. Adrian won. He kissed me, then sank his teeth into my neck—

I jolted awake, gasping.

3 AM. Might as well start the day.

###Chapter 0024

Morning light spills through my window as I stretch awake. Today feels different—lighter somehow. My warriors still fall to Evelyn's skill during training, but the sting of defeat doesn't linger like before. Even Sebastian, her fiercest opponent, can't match her.

Donovan meets me with a takeout bag from Celestia, the scent of cinnamon rolls making my stomach growl. The school halls buzz with one topic: Evelyn's secret admirer. I spot Julian near the lockers, his notebook already open for business.

"Julian." We exchange quick fist bumps. "Who's leading the betting pool?"

His grin turns sharp. "Interested, Adrian?"

"Maybe." If my name's on that list, placing a bet could throw everyone off her scent.

"Top five includes you and Donovan here."

Donovan blinks. "Why me?"

Julian rolls his eyes. "You're the only Beta who buys Celestia's gold-leaf desserts, genius."

I toss fifty on the table. "My money's on Donovan."

My Beta freezes mid-bite, syrup dripping from his croissant. Slowly, he wipes his hands and matches my bet. "Fifty says it's Adrian."

Bastard knows he'll win.

Julian cackles as he recalculates odds, muttering about "psychological warfare" as he disappears into the crowd.

Lunch is a spectacle. The entire student body crams into the cafeteria, waiting. When Evelyn enters, her gaze darts around—searching. That tiny frown? Perfect. Just wait, sweetheart.

The quartet's entrance silences the room. Rose petals rain down as they launch into an upbeat rendition of Perfect. Evelyn's laughter rings out, bright and unguarded, and Theron purrs approval in my mind. We did that.

The standing ovation shakes the walls. When Harry hands her today's note, my pulse spikes. Yesterday claimed her publicly. Today? No more games. Adrian Grey wants Evelyn Sinclair, and we're done hiding it.

Her eyes flare gold—Selene surging forward—before she tucks the card against her chest.

Training field gossip swirls after school. Sebastian vehemently denies involvement. Donovan and I shut down questions with lethal glares. Most theories point to Alpha Sebastian—logical, given their training sessions.

Genevieve guards the note's contents like a vault. "The gifts speak for themselves," is all she'll say, smirking when someone mentions the Celestia reservations.

Theron's growl vibrates through me as we spar. Let them guess. Soon, everyone will know.

###Chapter 0025

The pack dinner ended, and I made my way to my father's office. The door stood slightly open, so I knocked before entering.

I froze.

There was my mother, perched on my father's lap, his tongue practically down her throat.

"Really?" I deadpanned. "You couldn’t wait until you were alone?"

My mother jumped up, cheeks flushing pink. They turned crimson when my father gave her backside a playful smack. She shot him a glare, but I caught the smirk tugging at her lips.

She turned to me, smoothing her dress. "One day, Adrian, hopefully soon, you’ll understand the pull of the mate bond." She tapped my cheek lightly as she passed, closing the door behind her.

My father watched her go, lingering until the door clicked shut. Then his gaze shifted to me. "What do you need, son?"

I dropped into a chair, resting one ankle on my knee. "I want to go with you to the Sinclairs' for dinner tomorrow."

This wasn’t the first time I’d asked. But this time, I had an ulterior motive—Evelyn.

"Adrian, we’ve discussed this. That’s my time with Grant. I owe him my life. This is the one day a week I dedicate to him."

"I want to show my appreciation too, Dad. I want him to know I understand the sacrifices he and his wife made—how much their family means to me."

He leaned back, considering. "I’ve been trying to get him back into warrior training for years. He doesn’t realize how much he still has to offer the pack."

"If his training with Evelyn is any indication, he might be the best we’ve got."

"He is," my father admitted. "Better than you or me." He studied me for a long moment before sighing. "I’ll think about it. No promises."

"Thanks, Pops." I smirked. "At least he’s coming to my birthday party. So you’re getting him back into the packhouse, one way or another."

A sly grin spread across his face. "I told him I’d be deeply offended if he didn’t show."

I shook my head.

The conversation shifted to pack business. For the next two hours, we reviewed finances, the rising rogue threats near our borders, the increased patrols, and housing arrangements for pack members coming and going. My father kept me updated so I’d be prepared when I took over after graduation.

When we finished, I bid him goodnight and headed to my room. I still needed to write the card for tomorrow’s gift.

As Adrian left, Alpha Alistair watched the door close thoughtfully. The entire pack was buzzing about the mystery man staking a claim on Evelyn Sinclair. Yet, despite the hours they’d spent together this week, his son hadn’t mentioned a word about it.

Another observation struck him—he hadn’t seen any young she-wolves sneaking out of the alpha floor at dawn lately.

A knowing smile curved his lips.

This weekend’s birthday party was going to be very interesting indeed.

He locked up his office, whistling as he went to find his mate. There was unfinished business to attend to.

What do you think Adrian's surprise will be?

###Chapter 0026

The dream left me restless all morning. Or maybe it was the constant whispers and not-so-subtle speculation about my mystery admirer.

By lunchtime, my nerves were frayed—but excitement hummed beneath the surface. I won't lie, the attention was thrilling.

Selene, my wolf spirit, was practically preening. "You can deny it all you want, Evelyn, but I know you're enjoying this as much as I am."

I rolled my eyes. "Whatever."

She refused to be dismissed. She wanted another gift, and she was ready for it.

The cafeteria was packed when I walked in. I hadn’t realized so many students had this lunch period.

A man stood near the entrance, holding an extravagant gift basket. "Evelyn Sinclair?"

"That's me."

"This is for you."

"Is there a card?"

He handed me an envelope. I thanked him and headed to my table, where Genevieve and Nathaniel had already grabbed me lunch.

Good thing, because the moment I sat down, curious onlookers crowded around.

Nathaniel shot them a warning look. "Give her some space, unless you want to deal with me."

They backed off—but not by much.

I opened the card first.

Dearest Evelyn,

As a Guardian, you fight for your pack without hesitation.
But who tends to the Guardian when the battle is done?
Who soothes your wounds and eases your pain?

I will.

You will never be alone. Your needs will always come before mine.

Accept this gift. Let it remind you that you are cherished.
That your sacrifices are seen.
That your body, soul, and mind deserve rest.

From my heart,
Your Secret Admirer

My breath caught. Each note grew bolder. Today, he wasn’t just flirting—he was declaring his intent to claim me.

If Sebastian hadn’t stormed off the other night, I’d swear it was him.

Inside the basket: lavender candles, eucalyptus-scented bath salts, vanilla bubble bath, body lotion, and a bottle of my favorite wine.

Perfect. Exactly what I needed after brutal training sessions.

"And thoughtful," Selene purred.

Once the crowd dispersed, I examined the gifts—until the room fell silent.

A familiar scent hit me—pine, blood, and raw power.

Selene surged forward, instincts sharpening.

From the corner of my eye, Donovan and Nathaniel stood, their wolves alert.

I turned toward the entrance—and froze.

Sebastian strode toward me, Dorian gleaming in his eyes. His clothes were torn, bloodied. A vicious slash marred his chest.

But that wasn’t what stunned me.

Slung over his shoulders was a massive black bear—twice his size, lifeless.

He stopped before me. I stood. "Sebastian, what—?"

Dorian’s voice cut me off. "An offering for Selene."

He dropped the bear at my feet.

Selene nearly shoved me aside in her excitement. "Dorian," she crooned, admiring the kill. "You hunted a bear for me?"

Sebastian cupped my cheek. Selene leaned into his touch.

"I wanted to prove I can provide for you. Protect you." His thumb brushed my skin. "You don’t need my protection, Selene. But you’ll always have it."

###Chapter 0027

Selene pressed her palm against Dorian's chest. "Yes, Sebastian, I accept your gift."

A thunderous cheer erupted from the Nightshade Pack, their pride swelling as their Alpha's offering was acknowledged by a Guardian.

Then came the guttural snarl that silenced them all.

I spun to see Adrian struggling against Donovan's grip, his canines fully extended and claws unsheathed. Theron was clearly battling for dominance while Nathaniel positioned himself as a human shield between Adrian and Sebastian.

I felt Dorian's protective shift as he tried to push me behind him. Instead, I nudged Selene aside, stepping forward to diffuse the tension before claws started flying.

When I turned back to Sebastian, his own fangs were bared. I placed both hands flat against his chest—not to stop him, but to redirect his focus.

"Sebastian," I said firmly, waiting until those stormy eyes locked onto mine. "What exactly am I supposed to do with this? It's rather... substantial. And I still have afternoon classes." I flashed him a teasing smile, keeping one eye on Donovan maneuvering a still-growling Adrian out of the cafeteria.

The tension in Sebastian's shoulders eased slightly, his claws retracting. But it was Dorian who answered. "The Alpha will have it processed. The meat will be ready by tomorrow, though the hide requires additional curing time."

His gaze flickered toward the exit where Adrian's muffled snarls still echoed. Desperate to maintain his attention, I suggested, "Perhaps you could bring the meat tomorrow after school? You could train with Father and me." His head snapped back toward me at the mention of training with two Guardians. "We could make..." I glanced at the massive bear carcass, "...bear steaks?" I phrased it as a question—because honestly, was that even edible? But Adrian's persistent growls left me scrambling for distractions.

Finally, Sebastian's eyes softened back to their usual sage green. "I'd like that," he said, lips twitching with suppressed amusement. "I'll prepare the... bear steaks for grilling."

"Perfect."

He leaned down, brushing his lips against mine in a featherlight kiss before hefting the bear onto his broad shoulders. As he turned to leave, I couldn't resist one final jab.

"Oh Alpha Sebastian?" He glanced back. "Do shower before tomorrow's visit," I added with deliberate sass. The corner of his mouth lifted in acknowledgment before he disappeared through the doors.

I exhaled sharply, turning to find Nathaniel and Genevieve staring at me with identical 'what the actual hell' expressions.

Lunch was officially over—not that I had any appetite left. Nathaniel handed me my gift basket and bag before dragging me into an empty hallway alcove. "Explain. Now."

"Which part?" I hissed. "The part where Sebastian hunted a bear bare-handed as a courting gift? Or when Adrian nearly started an interspack brawl?"

"Both," he deadpanned. We stared at each other for a beat before he snorted, tugging me toward class. "Ever tasted bear meat?"

"Nope."

"Neither have I," he said, popping the 'p'. "You'll have to tell me how it is. And Evelyn?" He paused. "Just because I'm not an Alpha doesn't mean you can exclude me from training sessions."

I stopped walking. "Nathaniel, you're my closest friend. Which is precisely why I won't let you spar with Guardians. Unless you have a death wish?"

He shook his head, chuckling.

I wasn't joking.

###Chapter 0028

Thursday begins like any other. I watch Evelyn train, grab a quick breakfast, and head to school.

Today feels different. My daily gifts have grown bolder, and each time, she and Selene accept them without hesitation.

The whole school is buzzing about the mysterious admirer. Bets are being placed on when he—me—will reveal himself. I'm tempted to join in, but I hold back. Throwing the odds off by betting on Donovan is enough mischief for now.

I arrive early at lunch again. My courier waits by the door, a stranger I don’t acknowledge. He keeps his gaze down, playing his part perfectly.

The moment Evelyn walks in, he approaches. "Evelyn Sinclair?" She nods, takes the card, and heads to her table.

The cafeteria erupts. Everyone crowds around her—even the staff. Adrian and I move to intervene, but Nathaniel beats us to it, commanding space for her.

I watch as she reads my words. Selene pushes forward, eager as always, though today’s message is meant solely for Evelyn. I’m no poet, but my words are raw, honest—and they’re working.

She unpacks the gift basket, inhaling the scents, smiling before passing items to Genevieve to share. Adrian relaxes beside me. Our plan is succeeding. She’s accepting us.

As the crowd disperses, I start eating. A smirk forms as I glance at Donovan—until the metallic tang of blood hits my nostrils.

Theron surges forward in my mind at the same moment Orion does for Donovan. My body tenses.

We stand in unison.

Sebastian strides through the doors, a massive bear carcass slung over his shoulders. The challenge is unmistakable. He knows I’ve been claiming Evelyn—now he’s staking his own claim publicly.

He stops before her. The entire cafeteria freezes.

Dorian’s voice is rough, battle-worn. "An offering for Selene." He drops the bear at her feet.

Selene fully surfaces, Evelyn’s eyes blazing gold. Even furious, I can’t deny their beauty.

Then she purrs his name.

Theron loses control. I’ll kill him. She’s ours.

He’s never been this volatile. We’ve always been in sync. But now? All he sees is red, the need to prove our dominance.

I’m barely holding him back when Selene accepts the gift. Her hand touches Dorian’s chest—

Theron shatters my restraint.

A vicious snarl tears from my throat.

The room falls silent. Donovan jumps between us, joined by two warriors, but Theron won’t be calmed. My canines lengthen; claws slice through my fingertips.

If he forces the shift, Dorian will too.

And that means a fight to the death.

###Chapter 0029

My eyes track Dorian's reaction to Theron's aggressive display. Evelyn swiftly takes command of Selene, which is exactly what we need right now. Selene might enjoy two Alphas battling for her attention, but that would be disastrous in our current situation.

Dorian moves to shield Evelyn behind him, his fangs bared and claws extended. But she surprises me by placing both hands firmly against his chest. Theron is barely holding back his fury, and I'm struggling to help Donovan get us outside before all hell breaks loose.

Donovan and several warriors finally manage to drag me through the doors. Theron continues snarling and thrashing against their hold.

Donovan gets right in my face. "ALPHA! Get a grip! You need to leave before this escalates into a full pack war with innocent students caught in the crossfire." He emphasizes the word 'students' like a punch to the gut. "We'll handle things here. Go run it off before you do something irreversible."

With tremendous effort, I wrestle enough control from Theron to turn and sprint toward the forest. The moment I cross the tree line, I shift. We run for hours, until my muscles burn and my lungs scream for mercy. Only then does Theron's rage begin to subside.

By the time I return to the packhouse, training has long ended. Donovan waits for me in the courtyard, tossing me a pair of shorts as I shift back.

"How's the head?"

"Clearer." I pull on the shorts. "Thanks for earlier. Any fallout?"

"Evelyn smoothed things over with Sebastian. He left with his bear, and things settled down." Donovan smirks. "Though the betting pool has skyrocketed in your favor. For some insane reason, mine too. Guess they think you're my personal enforcer now."

I scoff. "Like you'd ever need me to fight your battles." He claps my shoulder, then sobers. "That was too close today, Adrian."

"No argument here." I scrub my face with both hands. "Donovan... I think she might be my mate."

His eyebrows shoot up. "You're serious?"

"Dead serious. Theron has never acted like this before." I search for the right words. "This possessive... this territorial. I've watched females I've been with move on to other males without a second thought from Theron. But with Evelyn..."

I trail off, remembering how Theron reacted when Sebastian approached her. "Just seeing her talk to another male makes my wolf lose his damn mind. Theron started growling the moment Sebastian walked in with that bear. When she accepted his gift? I nearly shifted right there in the cafeteria."

Donovan studies me carefully. "Can I ask you something?"

"Shoot."

"I mean this with complete respect, as your friend and Beta."

I motion for him to continue when he hesitates.

"Could this be about her being a Guardian rather than your mate? She's the strongest she-wolf any of us have ever seen. Every unmated male in the territory wants her. Even Orion recognizes what an asset she'd be to any pack."

A deep growl rumbles through my chest before I can stop it. Donovan holds up his hands. "Not making a play here. Just pointing out our wolves are hardwired to respect power. As an Alpha, Theron would naturally be drawn to that strength."

I reach for Theron, but he offers no clarity. We likely won't know for certain until after my birthday, or possibly hers.

"Honestly? I don't know." I exhale sharply. "Guess we'll have to wait and see."

For the first time in years, I won't be visiting my mother at Ivy's memorial site tonight. I need to see Evelyn. Need to make sure today's disaster hasn't ruined everything between us.

###Chapter 0030

Theron wheeled himself into the living room with practiced ease.

"Hey princess, what's cooking today?" His grin was infectious as always.

I exhaled sharply. "I'll tell you, but we need to talk. It's urgent. You know I wouldn't interrupt training unless it was serious. We need to discuss this before Alpha Alistair visits tonight."

"Shoot. Let's sit down and you can tell me everything."

Dad positioned his wheelchair directly across from me, giving me his full attention. I started from the beginning - the mysterious gift basket, the escalating notes. From Monday's cryptic riddles to today's blatant declaration of wanting to claim me.

"Sweetheart, Guardians always attract admirers. Your mother had suitors lining up for her favor too. With your birthday approaching, this isn't unusual. What's really bothering you?"

"Dad, right after I opened today's gift, Alpha Sebastian marched into the cafeteria carrying a massive black bear carcass. He looked like he'd just come from battle - blood still staining his clothes, that wild fight scent clinging to him. Dorian announced it was an offering for Selene."

Dad let out an impressed whistle, but I didn't let him interrupt.

"It gets worse. When Selene accepted Dorian's offering, Theron growled a direct challenge. Maybe he thought Sebastian and Dorian were disrespecting my secret admirer, but regardless, if Donovan hadn't dragged him out and I hadn't distracted Dorian, there would've been bloodshed. Over ME."

Dad studied me thoughtfully. "And you're certain why Theron challenged Dorian?"

"Clueless. But Sebastian's serious about making me his Luna. We talked last week. He knows I'm waiting for my mate, but believes HE is that mate. He was content to wait... until someone else started courting Selene and me."

"Evelyn, have you considered Adrian might be your secret admirer? Maybe Sebastian recognized him as legitimate competition."

"Dad, hate to break it to you, but Adrian doesn't even know I exist."

"What makes you say that?"

"Because he had the audacity to ask my name and which pack I belonged to at school yesterday."

Dad's jaw actually dropped before he recovered.

"So who's left on the list?"

"I had Nathaniel check the betting pool - you know there was one."

Dad smirked. "Obviously."

"Top contenders were Adrian, Donovan, Sebastian, Sebastian, and Nathaniel." I wrinkled my nose at the last name.

Dad raised an eyebrow.

"It's not Nathaniel. He's my best friend and even he thought being in the top five was disgusting. That leaves Donovan and Sebastian as possibilities. Never got any vibes from Donovan, so..." I met Dad's eyes. "That leaves Sebastian."

Dad's gaze drifted to the backyard, his expression distant. When he turned back, his voice was measured. "Sebastian's a strong possibility. Skilled warrior, would want an equally strong mate. But I don't see Alpha Adrian challenging Alpha Sebastian over a perceived slight. Males fight over Alpha females all the time - no reason for him to react so strongly." He focused on me. "How did it end?"

"Well..." I drew out the word dramatically as Dad's curiosity visibly grew. "I had to distract Dorian from fighting Theron while Donovan and some Blackthorn warriors escorted Adrian out, so..." I blurted out the rest in one breath. "I kind of invited Sebastian to train with us tomorrow and stay for dinner to eat whatever bear dish you make."

I braced for his anger. Instead, Dad burst into laughter.

"You're telling me I'll be training one of the strongest Alphas alongside the most powerful warrior alive tomorrow?" He rubbed his hands together excitedly. "This is going to be epic!"

My shock must have shown. "You're seriously not mad?"

"Mad? You should worry about Alistair. He's been begging me to train his warriors for years, and now I'm training another pack's Alpha. Good luck explaining THAT tonight."

"Wait - why tell him at all? He doesn't need to know!" Even as I said it, I knew how naive that sounded. Of course the Alpha would need to know about another Alpha visiting his pack member.

Dad chuckled and patted my shoulder as he wheeled past. "Oh, I can't wait to see his face. First his son nearly starts a war over my daughter, then she invites a rival Alpha to training. Tonight will be interesting."

Put that way, it sounded disastrous.

"Um..." I followed him to the kitchen. "I have tons of homework. Maybe I should skip dinner and..."

"Not a chance!" Dad cut me off. "You're a Guardian, not a coward. Besides, I'm curious to hear Alistair's take on why his son reacted that way. My guess? As the involved Alpha he is, he already knows who your secret admirer is."

That possibility hadn't occurred to me. This might actually help uncover the truth.

"Fine. What can I help with? And speaking of dinner - do you even know how to cook bear?"

"Sebastian will probably bring steaks or ribs. Either way, they're going on the grill. It's meat, Evelyn. I can grill anything."

###Chapter 0031

An hour ticks by before I hear the distinct knock at the front door. Alpha Alistair. My father shoots me a knowing glance before wheeling the grill outside to get it started. With an exaggerated eye roll, I head to greet our guest.

"Evening, Alistair. How's your day been?"

"Good evening, Evelyn. Can't complain. And you?"

"All good, thanks. Come on in. Dad's already out back firing up the grill."

He hands me two items—a decadent chocolate cheesecake that makes my mouth water instantly, and a six-pack of beer. He pops two bottles open before heading straight to join my father.

After confirming it's indeed cheesecake (because one can never be too sure), I stash it in the fridge. Dad's handling the baked potatoes on the grill, leaving me with just the veggies. I went with a broccoli and cheese casserole—simple, but it pairs well with everything.

When Alistair walks back inside, his gaze lands on the gift basket sitting conspicuously on the kitchen island.

"What's this?" He picks up the card, glancing at me. "Let me guess—courtesy of your secret admirer?"

"Yep."

He raises an eyebrow. "Mind if I take a look?"

Part of me wants to say no, but he's my Alpha. Plus, if he understands how serious this admirer is, it might help when I explain the near-disaster between Adrian and Sebastian earlier.

He reads the card and lets out a low whistle—just like Dad did. "This guy isn't playing around. Any leads yet?"

Dad stays silent, letting me handle this. "A few possibilities, but nothing concrete."

"Who’s on your list?"

I run through the names, deliberately leaving out Nathaniel and Sebastian but keeping Adrian in the mix—just like Dad and I discussed earlier.

"You're sharp, Evelyn. You'll figure it out soon enough."

Then I drop the bomb. "Speaking of which... did you hear about what happened today? Maybe Alpha Adrian mentioned something?"

Alistair frowns. "No. I’ve been dealing with rogue attacks near Nightshade territory all day." His eyes dart between Dad and me, sharpening with suspicion. "What did I miss?"

I give him the condensed version. His expression darkens when I mention Adrian had to be dragged away and I had to calm Sebastian down.

"Adrian challenged Sebastian. Over you." It’s not a question.

The weight behind his words is clear: My son almost started a war because of you.

I swallow hard, guilt twisting in my gut even though none of this was my fault. "Technically, it was Theron who challenged Dorian. But... yeah."

"Anything else I should know?"

I glance at Dad, who hasn’t taken his eyes off Alistair. "Well... I kind of invited Sebastian to train with us tomorrow. To keep him from retaliating."

I brace myself for his reaction.

Alistair slowly turns to Dad. "So you’ll train another pack’s Alpha, but you won’t help me with our own warriors?"

Dad just shrugs, completely unfazed by the Alpha aura rolling off Alistair in waves.

"My daughter just stopped a battle—possibly a war—that your son started, intentionally or not. I’d think you’d be grateful that all it cost you was one training session."

Another silent conversation passes between them. The air crackles with tension.

###Chapter 0032

Alistair's dominant aura faded as he relaxed his posture. "You're absolutely right, my old friend. I'm relieved the price was merely one night of training."

I exhaled in temporary relief until his piercing gaze locked onto me again. "Now Evelyn, after today's little demonstration, why are you so certain my son isn't the one sending those gifts?"

My boots scuffed against the floorboards as I avoided eye contact. How could I admit how deeply it wounded me that Adrian didn't recognize me - or likely my parents either? The last thing I wanted was for Alistair to tell his son about my humiliation. Adrian should have known my identity years ago.

"I'd prefer not to answer, Alpha."

His scrutinizing stare lasted several heartbeats before my father intervened. "Alistair, help me with these steaks." Dad shoved the platter into his hands, successfully breaking the tense moment. "Of course, Grant."

During dinner, Dad inquired about the rogue situation. Alistair detailed the alarming surge in attacks over recent months. My father noted the increased patrols but hadn't realized our borders had been breached multiple times. Their discussion turned to how we could assist. "You know what I'm asking, Grant."

That silent alpha communication passed between them before Dad finally conceded, "I'll consider it."

A satisfied smirk crossed Alistair's face as dessert arrived - Seraphina's famous chocolate cheesecake. I made sure to praise the Luna's baking skills. "Come tell her yourself at the packhouse," Alistair suggested. I agreed, especially since I'd be attending Saturday's celebration.

Rather than staying for after-dinner drinks, Alistair excused himself. "Need to speak with my son and confirm our alliance with Sebastian still stands. Damage control can't wait."

We bid our goodnights. I watched his silhouette disappear into the forest shadows heading toward Blackthorn territory.

Alistair



I'd sensed Adrian's presence the moment he arrived near the Sinclair property. My son had been eavesdropping the entire time, even mindlinking confirmation about Sebastian's unchanged alliance after Evelyn recounted today's incident.

Her refusal to explain why she doubted Adrian's courtship baffled me. The signs were obvious - my son was clearly claiming our Guardian. Yet she remained stubbornly unconvinced. Why?

Adrian's silence on the matter concerned me. Had he somehow offended Evelyn? Grant's comment about "one night of training" suddenly took darker meaning. If Adrian's mistakes proved irreparable...if Evelyn chose Sebastian as mate instead...

The consequences would devastate us. Not just Adrian and Theron, but our entire pack. Nightshade would become the dominant territory. And though Grant and I share an unbreakable bond, I know he'll always prioritize Evelyn over pack politics.

I found Adrian in wolf form beneath the pines. Magnus stirred within me. "Son. We need to talk."

###Chapter 0033

My paws hit the forest floor as I shift into my wolf form. The wind carries scents of charcoal and grilled meat from Evelyn's house. Theron surges forward, eager to reach her, but I force him to halt at the tree line.

Voices drift on the breeze - Alpha Alistair and Mr. Sinclair are outside. I duck behind the training equipment as they move indoors, masking my presence. If Evelyn's upset about today's incident, I need to fix this.

Theron's growling in my mind, demanding we claim her now. I tighten my mental grip on him. Not yet.

Through the open window, I catch my father mentioning the mysterious gift. Damn it. If he's heard rumors about her secret admirer, he'll question why I haven't mentioned it. Another problem to handle.

My ears twitch as Dad asks to see the card. "Have you figured out who sent it?" he asks Evelyn. She mentions the betting pool but rules out Nathaniel and Sebastian. Smart girl - Nathaniel's just a friend, and Sebastian disqualified himself today.

Then she brings up the confrontation. My fur bristles when Dad demands, "Did Adrian challenge Sebastian over you?" I open the mindlink immediately. "No issues with Sebastian." I hope that's true - I'm relying on Donovan's report.

The next words hit like a punch. Sebastian's coming tomorrow for private training. The highest honor. Exactly what I'd sacrifice anything for. No wonder he didn't follow me outside - Evelyn had perfectly defused the situation.

Because of Theron's outburst and my failure to control him, Sebastian gets alone time with my mate. Not just any time - sacred training hours. Dad's wanted Mr. Sinclair to train our warriors for decades. Now Sebastian gets personal lessons... because of me.

Theron snarls in my head. "Silence!" I snap mentally. "This is your fault. If you hadn't lost control—"

"Wrong!" he interrupts. "He needs to know she's ours." I clench my jaw, forcing him down to keep listening.

Mr. Sinclair's next words freeze my blood. His quiet threat is unmistakable. Sacrificing one training session means nothing compared to...

Theron whimpers at the thought. "We need strategy," I tell him. "To prove we're the better choice. Sebastian has history with her - we can't afford mistakes." Theron quiets, neither agreeing nor protesting. The idea of losing Evelyn and Selene terrifies us both.

Then Mr. Sinclair shocks me. He'll consider training our warriors. Major progress - Dad's practically radiating satisfaction.

I stay hidden as Dad discusses increased rogue activity in neighboring packs. I hadn't heard about today's particularly vicious attack.

When Dad mentions needing damage control with Sebastian, I know our talk's coming. I slip back into the trees.

His eyes darken as Magnus surfaces. "Adrian. Shift back. We need to talk."

###Chapter 0034

I obey without hesitation. Locating spare clothes hidden in a hollow tree trunk, I quickly pull on shorts before facing my father again.

"You're going to explain why an exceptionally gifted Guardian from our own pack would doubt my son—the future Alpha—would stake such a public claim on her?"

Turning toward the packhouse, I gather my thoughts before responding. "You and Mom made sure I understood Evelyn Sinclair's legacy. I've known since childhood what her family sacrificed for ours." I meet his gaze squarely. "What you never taught me was who Evelyn is as a person."

His silence urges me to continue. "Last week, I saw her at school. There was... something." My fingers rake through my hair. "I didn't recognize her. But I felt drawn to her, so I approached her. Introduced myself. Asked her name and pack affiliation."

When I glance up, my father's stare burns into me. I let the silence stretch between us.

"Let me guess—that didn't go well?" he finally asks.

"About as disastrously as you'd imagine," I admit.

"So this week of gifts is... what? Damage control?"

"Partly." My shoulders tense. "At first, yes. I needed her to know I recognize her worth—her family's sacrifices. But then Theron demanded more. With each note I wrote, I made my intentions clearer. This isn't just about claiming her. I want her to choose us."

"And Theron's certain about her?"

"Absolutely. I've checked with him daily to ensure I wasn't making empty promises."

I hesitate before voicing Donovan's concern from earlier. "Could Theron be drawn to her Guardian nature rather than their mate bond?"

Father gazes into the darkness, considering. "Doubtful. You've shared schools for years yet only noticed her now—weeks before your eighteenth birthday. I suspect Theron..."

The breath I'd been holding escapes in a rush.

Before I can speak, he continues, "What's your plan? Two days until your birthday—that's when you'll reveal yourself?"

"Yes. One final gift tomorrow. Then a dress delivered Saturday for the party."

His eyebrows shoot up when I describe tomorrow's surprise. "Adrian, how in the moon's name did you arrange that?"

"Calling in an old debt." My lips curve smugly.

"That's one hell of a favor."

"She's worth it." My voice drops. "At the party, I've coordinated with Mom to reveal this week's secret. She thinks I'm just finally taking interest in my own celebration." We share a laugh, resuming our walk.

"Sebastian will be there Saturday," he reminds me.

"I know." My jaw tightens. "I'm aware of their history, though not its depth. She's still months from eighteen—that gives me time to prove my intentions."

The thought of Sebastian getting private time with her tomorrow burns, but my final gift will eclipse that. I've saved the most impactful for last. There's no way she won't be moved.

What could Adrian's final surprise be? Share your theories!

###Chapter 0035

Friday should have been a relief, but my stomach twisted with dread. Another public showdown between Alphas was the last thing I needed. Maybe my offer to train with Sebastian and have dinner would keep him from storming the school again.

By lunch, my nerves were frayed. The entire school buzzed about yesterday's spectacle—even teachers asked if I favored one Alpha over the other. Unbelievable. Worse, what if my secret admirer got scared off? Or if he showed up and Sebastian returned?

The cafeteria doors swung open. No one waited at my usual spot. Relief and disappointment warred in my chest.

Selene's voice cut through my thoughts. If Sebastian frightened him away, he wasn't strong enough for us. Part of me agreed. My wolf spirit demanded a powerful mate, but Sebastian's dominance intimidated even seasoned warriors. Almost everyone, she corrected with a mental smirk.

Tray in hand, I joined Genevieve and Nathaniel. "Looks like Alpha Sebastian scared off your mystery guy," Genevieve said with a pointed glance at the empty chair.

I shrugged, poking at my salad. No gift today. Was that intentional? Maybe Friday deliveries came after classes. No way to know.

A sudden hush fell over the room. Then whispers erupted like wildfire. My head snapped up.

The most ethereal man I'd ever seen glided toward me. Seven feet tall at least, his movements fluid beneath gossamer robes that shimmered with each step. "Evelyn Sinclair?" His voice resonated like wind chimes in a summer breeze.

I managed a nod, mouth dry. Fae. Had to be. Their kind rarely interacted with werewolves, but his otherworldly beauty matched every legend.

He extended a parcel wrapped in plain brown paper, tied with hemp twine. "For you."

I accepted the package with trembling hands. "Thank you. Is there a—"

"None required," he interrupted, arching a haughty brow. With a swirl of fabric, he turned. At the exit, he announced loud enough for all to hear, "My debt is settled." Then vanished.

The weight in my hands felt ominous without a card. Fingers fumbling, I untied the twine. The paper fell away. A gasp tore from my throat.

My fingers traced the embossed leather cover. The History of the Guardian shimmered in gilded letters. Only one copy existed—and now it was mine. Father had searched decades for this. Tears welled as I cradled the priceless tome.

"Thank you," I whispered. In the dead silence, I knew he heard.

The bell rang. Students craned their necks, desperate to see what warranted such a reaction. Then my gaze locked with glacial blue eyes across the room. No surprise there. No curiosity. Just... satisfaction. Had my reaction pleased him? The thought sent shivers down my spine.

Clutching the book to my chest, I bolted for the exit. This treasure needed safekeeping—far from prying eyes and potential thieves. As I rushed past, icy fingers of awareness trailed down my back. Someone watched. Someone powerful. And they weren't done with me yet.

###Chapter 0036

Did Adrian get this for me? Why? He barely knows me. Unless... Does he? Could this be some territorial move because Sebastian showed interest? That would explain his reaction yesterday if he felt compelled to claim what another Alpha desires.

This gift stands apart from the rest. No delivery person—just a fae repaying a debt. That alone speaks volumes about the giver's status. And with no card attached, maybe this isn't from my original secret admirer. Maybe it's someone new.

I catch Adrian tilting his head slightly toward me, a silent "You're welcome" in his gaze.

Flustered, I gather my things, clutching the ancient tome to my chest. I tell Nathaniel I'm leaving—he can join me now or find his own ride later. He chooses the latter, so I head straight home to show my father this impossible treasure.

It's beyond anything I imagined. Someone sees me—truly sees me. A Guardian, hungry for her own history, her roots. Someone who understands that to be my best, I must know where I come from. It feels like my soul is laid bare before a stranger.

Could it really be Alpha Adrian? And if so... when did he figure me out?

Dad isn't in the house when I arrive. The rhythmic thud-thud from the training facility guides me. After dropping my bag in the kitchen, I follow the noise, still gripping the book like a lifeline.

The sight inside steals my breath. Dad's blasting music while assembling what looks like a hybrid of a military obstacle course and a gladiator arena. Since when did training an Alpha require this? Clearly, he's decided if I'm competing against Sebastian, we're doing it with stakes—and a timer. A grin tugs at my lips. Tonight just got interesting.

The music cuts off abruptly. "Evelyn? You're home early."

I blink at the chaos. "What is all this?"

Dad smirks. "If I'm training an Alpha and a Guardian, I can't half-ass it."

His gaze sharpens. "Now—why are you here?"

Wordlessly, I hand him the tome. His fingers freeze over the embossed cover, his breath hitching. "Where did you find this?" he whispers.

I explain the fae, the repaid debt, the lack of adornment—no card, no clues.

Dad traces the leather with reverence before locking eyes with me. "Do you understand what this means?"

Oh, I do. It means secrets buried for generations are now within reach. Forgotten Guardian powers. Our origins. Whether we're truly the last. Every question we've ever had—answered.

I smile. "I do. But Dad?" I wait until he meets my gaze. "Now I have a problem. Because whoever did this... they're serious about wanting Selene. And me. And I don't know if I want to resist anymore."

###Chapter 0037

Father and I returned to the house to prepare for Alpha Sebastian's arrival. While he wheeled off to shower, I began preparing a warm apple crisp with caramel drizzle - perfect for post-workout coffee. Did apple crisp complement bear meat? No idea, but we'd find out soon enough. With the dessert baking, I shredded potatoes and cheese for a gratin. Spotting fresh spinach in the fridge, I decided on garlic sautéed greens to complete our meal. The side dishes could wait until father started cooking the bear meat.

I hurried upstairs to change into training gear. Just as I descended, a knock echoed through the house. Sebastian's distinctive scent - like a pine forest after snowfall - reached me before I even opened the door.

The sight surprised me. In one hand he held a bouquet of delicate winter blooms, while the other balanced an enormous cooler against his shoulder. I quickly relieved him of the flowers so he could manage the heavy load. As he passed into the kitchen, he paused to brush his lips against mine in a fleeting kiss.

Following him while inhaling the floral fragrance, I asked, "Where did you possibly find flowers in late January?"

He turned with that heart-stopping smile. "Snowdrops. They grow wild in Nightshade territory. Their white petals always remind me of Selene's eyes." At the mention, my wolf pushed forward proudly. Sebastian closed the distance, hands settling on my hips as his eyes darkened with Dorian's presence. "There she is - those mesmerizing eyes I adore."

Before the moment could deepen, father's wheelchair announced his arrival. "Alpha Sebastian, I presume?"

As Sebastian moved to greet him, I arranged the flowers in water. Dorian remained prominent as Sebastian extended his hand respectfully. "Warrior Grant. The honor is mine, sir."

Father grasped his hand firmly. "A courteous Alpha. You're making a good first impression."

"Though I hope you don't expect special treatment during training, Alpha. Since hearing I'd be working with you today, I've planned quite the... intensive session."

"The privilege is mine, and I'd expect nothing less from our greatest warrior."

"Flattery won't earn you mercy, son. Ready to begin?" Sebastian grinned and turned to me. "At your command, Evelyn."

"Then let's begin."

For two relentless hours, father put us through punishing drills. Training with Sebastian differed dramatically from sparring with our warriors. While our fighters were skilled, Alphas commanded packs for good reason. Sebastian moved with breathtaking precision - powerful yet controlled, aggressive yet measured. Whether he felt the strain or not, this ranked among my most grueling sessions ever.

Father proved an exceptional instructor. Whenever Sebastian bested me, we'd pause to analyze the technique, with father demonstrating counters and strategies to exploit Sebastian's own strength against him. The same occurred when I gained advantage - father advising Sebastian on leveraging his power to break holds.

By session's end, we both gasped for air, sweat-drenched and exhausted.

Then father announced the true test: the obstacle course. Sebastian's eyes lit up with anticipation - clearly he'd been hoping for this challenge.

Father explained the rules: simultaneous start, identical obstacles testing every physical attribute imaginable, with victory going to the first completing the brutal course.

After outlining the parameters, father asked if we had questions. Sebastian turned to me with a smirk. "Just one - how many times have you run this gauntlet, little hellion?"

I feigned indignation. "For fairness' sake, Alpha, this is my first attempt."

"Fair play." He extended his hand. "May the best warrior prevail."

###Chapter 0038

"Oh, I'm definitely winning this." I shoot back as we approach the starting line.

Dad fires the starter pistol. We explode forward, scrambling up the first obstacle—a brutal test of upper body strength. Sebastian's muscles give him the edge, pulling ahead.

The next challenge is all about balance. This is where I shine. While he stumbles and has to recover, I surge past him with ease.

Then comes the aerial bars—core strength meets precision. I feel him gaining on me. Without hesitation, I forgo the standard grip and dive through a ring instead, catching the next bar mid-air. The risky move pays off as I land on the ramp first.

Swinging obstacles launch from the walls next. We dodge in perfect sync, crossing this section neck and neck.

The rope ladder stretches nearly to the ceiling. We scale it in seconds, then race across a razor-thin beam. Both of us wobble dangerously before leaping onto the slide.

We hit the ground running.

Our hands slam the finish buzzer simultaneously. A tie.

Panting hard, we collapse onto the mats. I sprawl on my back while Sebastian sits with his arms draped over bent knees. Our laughter mixes with ragged breaths.

"Good match," Dad calls. "Meet me inside when you've recovered."

Sebastian recovers first. He looms over me, those mesmerizing sage green eyes glinting. "Seems we're perfectly matched, little wolf."

I grin up at him. "I almost had you beat."

"Almost doesn't count, gorgeous." His lips crash onto mine before I can retort. My fingers immediately tangle in his hair.

Encouraged, he deepens the kiss. A soft moan escapes me when he nips my lower lip, demanding entry. Our tongues battle briefly before he dominates, one hand sliding beneath my tank top.

Electric pleasure shoots through me as his fingers graze bare skin. A possessive growl vibrates through his chest when he discovers my hardened nipples beneath my sports bra.



He shifts closer, his body pressing flush against mine. The hard length straining against his jeans presses into my thigh—impressively large even through layers of fabric. My breath hitches when his thumb circles a peaked nipple.

"Sebastian—"

His teeth scrape my claiming spot, making me stiffen. He pulls back instantly. "I know. We should stop." His thumb flicks my nipple again, drawing another gasp. "But fuck, you smell incredible."

The hunger in his eyes makes me whimper. With a tortured groan, he wrenches away.

"Up, little wolf. Any longer like this and I'll skip dinner to feast on you instead." He hauls me upright, adjusting my top with trembling hands.

Cradling my face, he delivers one last searing kiss. "You'll be the death of me." Hand in hand, he leads us back to the house, his arousal still evident in every tense line of his body.

###Chapter 0039

Friday finally arrived, and anticipation thrummed through my veins. Today's gift had cost me more than just favors - it required calling in a life debt.

The hallway whispers followed me like shadows after yesterday's confrontation. Both Blackthorn and Nightshade pack members eyed me with suspicion. Maintaining pack peace meant keeping my mouth shut, so I schooled my features into Alpha indifference and kept moving.

At my locker, I barely registered the hands sliding around my waist until rosewater assaulted my senses. Bianca. That cloying scent always made my nose twitch.

"Alpha Adrian," she purred, fingers dipping below my beltline. "I've been waiting all week for you. There's a party tonight..."

Two weeks ago, I would've taken what she offered without hesitation. Today? Nothing. Not even a flicker of interest. The last thing I needed was Evelyn catching me in this compromising position.

I removed her wandering hands with deliberate slowness. "Not tonight, Bianca. Birthday tomorrow, remember?"

Her pout followed me down the hallway. "I'll see you at your party then, Alpha?"

"Sure," I tossed over my shoulder, already dismissing her. Theron's chuckle echoed in my mind.

She'll love it, my wolf assured me.

Better be worth Oberon's displeasure, I shot back.

It's perfect. Shows we see her - really see her. The warrior and the woman.

Finnian's father nearly bit my head off.

He'd be mourning his heir if we hadn't pulled that boy from the fire, Theron reminded me sharply.

The clock mocked me all morning. By lunch, I was vibrating with restless energy. Then she walked in - my little Guardian, shoulders slumped like she expected disappointment.

The cafeteria fell silent when Oberon entered. Most wolves had never seen a Fae royal. Their kind considered us brutish, preferring human company where they passed as eccentric artists or environmentalists.

I watched as the Fae king approached Evelyn, verified her identity, and placed the ancient tome in her hands.

That book had been in the royal family for centuries. I only knew of its existence because of Finnian. Three years ago, hunters had turned their bunker into an inferno, trapping supernaturals inside.

My father and I had been searching for missing pack members when the explosions started. The screams... gods, the screams still haunted me. We saved who we could, including the Fae prince.

I'd been the one to return the terrified boy to his father. Oberon's gratitude had limits, but today, he honored his debt.

Evelyn's fingers trembled as she traced the embossed cover. When her gaze lifted to mine, wide with disbelief, Theron preened.

Told you.

###Chapter 0040

The meeting with Oberon took place in his private study. That's where I first laid eyes on the ancient tome. It struck me as peculiar that the Fae King possessed a historical record of the werewolf guardians, but my attention was quickly diverted to more pressing concerns - ensuring the safety of our pack members. Oberon declared himself in my debt that day. Truthfully, I never intended to call in that favor. My actions weren't motivated by political gain, but by simple decency. Finnian had been merely a child of five at the time.

Months later, when the memory of that book resurfaced, I began searching for another copy. After nearly a year of fruitless efforts, I consulted my father. That's when I discovered the terrible truth - only one such volume exists, crafted by the Guardians, for the Guardians. How Oberon's ancestors obtained it remains a mystery, but now it's finally where it belongs - in the hands of a true Guardian.

I observe as Evelyn inquires about a missing card. Oberon had reluctantly agreed to serve as my courier for this precious delivery. Securing his cooperation had been no small feat. Only the book's immense value convinced him to personally transport it, and only after I swore it would reach a legitimate Guardian - its rightful custodian.

He's correct about one thing - the book needs no introduction. When he declares our debt settled, I murmur my agreement, acutely aware of the Fae King's supernatural hearing that surpasses even our kind.

The shock flashing across Evelyn's face as she unwraps the gift sends Theron rumbling with satisfaction in my mind. She recognizes its significance immediately. Her whispered gratitude confirms we chose perfectly.

Clutching the ancient text to her chest, her gaze sweeps the room and locks with mine. Does she understand it came from me? Few could orchestrate such a delivery. In truth, only one. Me. But she likely doesn't realize that yet. My subtle nod acknowledges her unspoken thanks. Perhaps now she'll comprehend that I know exactly who she is - how vital she, Selene, and her lineage are to the pack, to my family, but most importantly, to me and Theron.

If today's events haven't made that clear, tomorrow's certainly will.

Training that afternoon buzzes with excitement about my impending birthday celebration. An Alpha's eighteenth birthday isn't an ordinary occasion. Naturally, everyone wants to attend.

Julian approaches me post-training with amusing news - there's a betting pool circulating about my potential mate. Bianca has been telling anyone who'll listen that she's destined to be my chosen one, landing her in the top five alongside other she-wolves I've been involved with. My interest only sparks when Julian mentions Evelyn's name among the contenders.

"Evelyn, is it?"

Julian studies me carefully. "Well, her mystery man remains unidentified, and you're currently tied for first place."

"Who's the other frontrunner?" I ask, already knowing Sebastian has been ruled out.

"Donovan, naturally."

I nod curtly and head toward the forest, eager to check on Evelyn's training session with Sebastian. Maintaining focus during drills has been challenging with jealousy gnawing at me over their private sessions.

I arrive near the Sinclair residence just as Grant enters from the training facility. Not spotting Evelyn or Sebastian outside, I edge closer to investigate. The indoor location works to my advantage - they won't detect my presence as easily.

Theron grows increasingly agitated as we approach. Tuning into his heightened senses, I understand why - Evelyn's soft moans mingle with Sebastian's pleasure-filled growls. Theron nearly rips control from me in his fury when suddenly they emerge hand-in-hand from the building. With immense effort, I restrain him and settle into watchful waiting.
###Chapter 0041

Sebastian's fingers remain entwined with mine as we approach the house. My father, Gregory, is outside lighting the grill. I slip my hand free and hurry inside to finish dinner preparations. Moments later, Sebastian and Dad join me in the kitchen.

"Alpha Sebastian," Dad begins, "I hope you don't mind—I peeked in the cooler and selected some steaks for the grill."

"Just Sebastian, please. And the steaks are perfect." He retrieves a bottle of wine from the cooler. "Brought this to pair with them. The rest includes ribs, bear sausage, and ground beef. Never hunted bear myself, but I had an expert process it. Evelyn, you'll have to tell me what you think."

I accept the wine with a smile, uncorking it to let it breathe.

As I transfer meats to the freezer—keeping out ground beef for weekend meals—Dad chuckles. "Sebastian, you're welcome back anytime to help us finish those ribs."

"I'd enjoy that, sir."

"Gregory. If I'm calling you Sebastian, you call me Gregory."

"Thank you, Gregory."

Dad takes the steaks outside to season them. Sebastian follows—typical male bonding over open flames. I sauté garlic and onions for the spinach, pour wine into three glasses, then pull roasted potatoes from the oven.

They return as I'm setting the table. Sebastian carries the wine and potatoes while I dish up the spinach.

Seated beside him, I take my first bite of bear meat. Gamey like venison, but heartier—surprisingly good.

Once we've all approved the exotic dish, Dad begins his interrogation.

"Sebastian." My palms dampen against my napkin until Sebastian's hand covers mine.

"Straight to it—are you only pursuing my daughter because she's a Guardian?"

"No, sir." His gaze locks onto me. "I pursue Evelyn because she's consistently the most remarkable woman in any room." Turning back to Dad: "We've spoken openly. She knows her Guardian strength, while impressive, isn't why I want her as my Luna. She'd be my equal in every way."

"Son, you understand she's waiting for her fated mate? Her mother and I raised her to value that bond."

"Absolutely. Evelyn has been clear about waiting, and I respect that." His fingers tighten around mine. "But Gregory... I believe with everything in me that we are fated. My wolf Dorian feels it too—his pull toward Selene is undeniable."

Dad studies us both. "Well... my daughter could certainly do worse than you, Sebastian." He pauses. "I was sorry to hear about Cassian's passing. He was a good man. By all accounts, you've honored his legacy as Alpha."

Sebastian's throat works before he murmurs, "Thank you. That means everything coming from you."

"Gregory," Dad corrects with a smile, raising his glass.

Sebastian clinks his against it. "Thank you, Gregory."


###Chapter 0042

The tension eased as we shifted to lighter topics, though the underlying issues remained. Sebastian had been dealing with rogue attacks too, coordinating with nearby packs to uncover their motives.

Training became the next subject. Sebastian tried persuading Gregory to train his warriors. My father chuckled, shaking his head. "If my own Alpha can't convince me to train our pack, what makes you think I'd train yours?"

"Wishful thinking?" Sebastian smirked. "Or maybe the fact I might become your son-in-law?"

Gregory's eyes twinkled. "Prove you're worthy of my daughter, then we'll talk."

I served my homemade bread pudding. Their empty plates confirmed it was a hit.

After dinner, I cleared the table while Gregory announced his retirement for the night. His pointed look at Sebastian spoke volumes.

"Alpha's honor, I won't overstay," Sebastian promised.

With a nod, Gregory retreated to his room.

Sebastian helped me finish cleaning. We took our wine glasses to the back porch, sitting in comfortable silence as we watched the moonlit forest.

"See you at tomorrow's gathering?" Sebastian asked.

"Luna Seraphina personally invited me," I confirmed. "And Alpha Alistair insisted Gregory attend too." His raised eyebrow mirrored my own surprise at that development.

When we finished our wine, Sebastian prepared to leave. At his car, he suddenly pinned me against the door, his lips hovering centimeters from mine. "Dinner was exceptional."

My gaze dropped to his mouth before meeting his smoldering eyes. "The training session was... invigorating."

His pupils dilated. "I can think of far more effective ways to work up a sweat." His breath ghosted over my lips. "Methods that'll leave you deliciously sore."

Heat pooled low in my belly. I traced his lower lip with my tongue - his control shattered.

The kiss turned possessive, demanding. His hardening length pressed against me as his fingers tangled in my hair, tilting my head for deeper access. My nails scored his back through his shirt, earning a growl.

When his mouth traveled down my neck, his tongue flicked over my future mating spot. A shudder wracked my body, my moan echoing in the night air.

"Sebastian," I gasped as his hands found my breasts.

"Say my name again," he commanded, grinding against me. "I want to hear you scream it later."

Breaking the kiss, he fixed me with that devastating look. "Let me show you our future, Evelyn." His nose brushed mine. "Do you trust me?"

"Yes," I breathed.

His triumphant smile outshone the moon as he claimed my lips once more.

###Chapter 0043

Sebastian's gaze never wavers as his fingers trail down my shoulder, slipping beneath the strap of my bra. With deliberate slowness, he tugs my shirt up and peels the fabric down until my breast is exposed, the curve fitting perfectly into his palm. His thumb brushes over my nipple, and I gasp, arching into his touch.

His eyes darken with raw hunger, a look so intense it sends heat pooling low in my belly. He lowers his head, capturing my nipple between his lips, tongue swirling before he sucks gently. My hips jerk involuntarily, grinding against him as pleasure arcs through me. My fingers tangle in his hair, holding him close.

While his mouth works magic on my breast, his other hand slips beneath the waistband of my shorts. Finding the barrier of fabric frustrating, he growls and yanks them down my hips, pinning my legs together so I can't move.

One hand grips my back, pulling me flush against him while the other trails lower, sliding between my thighs. His fingers glide through my slick folds, drawing a ragged moan from my throat. "So wet for me, Evelyn," he murmurs against my skin.

He tugs the other side of my bra down, leaving both breasts bare and aching for his attention. "Perfect," he rasps, locking eyes with me as he flicks his tongue over my nipple. My back bows, eyes fluttering shut at the sensation.

His fingers circle my clit in slow, torturous strokes while my arousal drips down my thighs. Pulling back slightly, he slides a finger inside me, his voice rough with command. "Look at me. I want to watch you fall apart."

I force my eyes open as he begins pumping his finger in and out. "Wider," he orders, and I spread my legs as far as the bunched fabric allows. "Against the car." I obey, bracing myself as he takes complete control, coaxing reactions from my body I never knew possible.

His fingers work me relentlessly - one thrusting deep while the other teases my clit. His free hand pinches and twists my nipple, sending jolts of pleasure straight to my core.

"That's it, baby," he growls. "You're going to come on my fingers." He adds a second finger, stretching me deliciously. "I want to feel you clamp down on me. Tell me what you want."

I can only nod, overwhelmed by sensation.

"Words, Evelyn." His fingers curl just right, making me whimper. "Say it."

"Make me come, Sebastian. Please."

His lips brush my ear. "Always."

His pace quickens, fingers pistoning in and out while his thumb presses hard on my clit. Just as I'm about to shatter, he hits that perfect spot inside me, and my world explodes. My walls clench around his fingers as my orgasm rips through me. I scream his name, but he swallows the sound with a possessive kiss, his canines scraping my lip.

As the aftershocks fade, I feel his body tense against mine. He groans into my mouth, licking the small cut on my lip until it heals. We stay wrapped around each other, breathing heavily.

"Wow," I finally manage.

Sebastian chuckles, bringing his glistening fingers to his mouth. The way he licks them clean sends another pulse of desire through me. "You're incredible," he murmurs. "I could spend eternity tasting you."

He helps me straighten my clothes, pressing a gentle kiss to my forehead. "You okay? Didn't mean to get carried away."

I touch my healed lip. "More than okay."

"I warned you'd be the death of me," he says wryly.

I grin. "Death by pleasure doesn't sound so bad."

His growl vibrates through me as he pulls me close. "If I don't leave now, I'll have you on that hood and make you scream my name again." The image makes me shiver, and his nostrils flare at my renewed arousal.

"Inside, Evelyn. I'll see you tomorrow." He kisses my nose before turning me toward the house.

Just as I reach the door, his voice stops me. "What did your other suitor give you today?"

I freeze. Damn.

Turning slowly, I meet his knowing gaze. "That bad?" he asks.

I bite my lip. "The Chronicles of the Guardians."

He lets out a low whistle. "Impressive. Even I couldn't have gotten that for you." His expression turns thoughtful. "This guy means business."

"Yeah," I agree.

Sebastian nods. "So do I. Tomorrow will be... interesting." With a smirk, he adds, "Dream of me," before driving off.

As I enter the house, his cryptic words linger. What could possibly happen tomorrow with Sebastian watching? No one would dare make a move under his nose.

Yet the promise in his tone sends both anticipation and dread curling through me.

###Chapter 0044

I know I shouldn't be lurking like this, but I can't bring myself to leave as I watch Sebastian and Evelyn disappear inside the house. I retreat further into the shadows, needing to see how far he'll push and how much she'll allow.

Their conversation about the bear meat makes my jaw clench. When Mr. Sinclair tells Sebastian to call him Gregory, it stings. Somehow, he's already closer to Evelyn's father than I am.

Outside, they grill the steaks while discussing training techniques. Sebastian thanks Gregory for today's session, praising the facility he built. The casual ease between them burns like acid in my veins.

Then comes the interrogation. Gregory demands to know Sebastian's intentions. To my irritation, his answer is flawless. He claims genuine feelings for Evelyn. Even suggests they might be fated mates.

Theron snarls in my mind. I don't blame him. If Evelyn is our mate, she can't possibly be his. But doubt creeps in—what if this pull we feel is just the Guardian bond? What if neither of us is truly her mate?

Relief floods me when Evelyn confirms she's waiting for her true mate. That means whatever's between her and Sebastian has limits. I nearly cheer when Gregory refuses Sebastian's request to train his warriors—until he adds that he'll reconsider if they're mates. Another reason to claim her first.

When they head for the car, I circle the house to eavesdrop. Theron nearly rips free when Sebastian kisses her. The scent of her arousal hits me as he whispers filthy promises, and my control shatters. Fur erupts across my skin.

Her scream of his name sends Theron lunging forward. It takes everything I have to drag him back behind the house. He rages at another male touching what should be ours.

"She's not ours yet," I remind him. "Even if we're certain, she doesn't know. She may not even realize we've recognized her."

The metallic tang of blood sends me rushing back. They're parting ways now, both having admitted she's waiting for her mate. While I hate that he touched her, their honesty gives me hope. When she accepts our bond, I'll be the only one who's tasted her.

My triumph evaporates when Sebastian asks about today's gift. So she hadn't told him. His reaction is priceless—that arrogant bastard realizing he can't compete with what I offer. My chest swells when Evelyn acknowledges my serious intentions.

Her confusion about his "interesting tomorrow" comment makes me grin. Tomorrow, he'll be on my territory.

As Sebastian drives away, his eyes lock onto my hiding spot. The challenge is clear. This isn't a game anymore—we're both fighting to keep her.

I circle back, hoping for one last glimpse of Evelyn before leaving her final gift. She sits by the window with The History of the Guardians, absently tucking hair behind her ear as she reads. I could watch her forever.

When she undresses, I turn away. Shifters may be comfortable with nudity, but she doesn't know I'm here. I won't violate her privacy further.

Back at the packhouse, I don't bother shifting until I reach my door. The faint rosewater scent makes me wonder what Bianca wanted on my floor. I grab clothes—shorts and a tee are enough despite the winter chill.

The gift box waits, perfectly wrapped with an extravagant bow. I attach my card and return to Evelyn's house on foot to avoid suspicion. Her lights are off now. I leave the package on her porch, spraying it with lavender to mask my scent.

Walking home, I whistle, already imagining how perfect tomorrow's birthday will be.

###Chapter 0045

His breath is hot against my ear. "Let me show you pleasure like you've never known." His bare skin presses against mine, the mattress soft beneath us. Those skilled hands explore every inch of me. His lips trail fire along my neck, my collarbone, teasing my earlobe. A whimper escapes my throat. My fingers trace the hard planes of his sculpted torso, drawing a satisfied hum from me. I crave the taste of him. Need to feel him claiming me in ways no other man ever could.

His erection glides against my sensitive bundle of nerves, sending electric shocks through my body. The slick heat between my thighs betrays how much he affects me. A soft moan slips out as I arch toward him, desperate for more. His fingers slide inside, curling just right. "Oh gods—" Pleasure erupts through me as I rock against his hand. "Don't stop."

"You want more, little wolf?" His voice is dark honey.

"Yes. Please." My voice breaks.

His teeth graze my earlobe. "Should I take you properly?"

"Gods, yes."

A sharp nip sends sparks down my spine. "I want to hear you scream my name. Want to feel you coming around me every night. Would you like that, my beautiful Guardian?"

"Adrian—"

"Louder." He withdraws his fingers and thrusts deep in one smooth motion, lifting himself so I see those smoldering eyes. "Say it!"

"ADRIAN!"

I jolt awake, gasping, sheets tangled around my legs. My hands fly to my pajamas—still on, thank the Moon Goddess. The bed is cold and empty.

What in the actual hell? That wasn't Sebastian in my dream. It was Adrian. Again. First at the window replaying memories with Sebastian's face replaced by Adrian's, now this? Even my traitorous body is responding to thoughts of him. Could he really—

No. I scramble out of bed before that thought finishes. Cold shower. Now.

'Selene?' I reach for my wolf spirit.

Only sleepy contentment echoes back. Maybe she favors Theron, though she certainly enjoyed Dorian's company last night...

'Mate bond comes first,' she mumbles before drifting off again.

After scrubbing away sinful thoughts, the clock reads 3:17 AM. Training starts at 4. Coffee first. Always coffee.

Dressed in workout gear, I open my door to find an enormous velvet box on the doorstep. The attached card bears elegant script:

My dearest Evelyn,
This final gift awaits your acceptance. Wear it tonight, and I shall reveal myself before the entire pack. The time for secrets is over. Let them all see who claims your heart.
Yours,
No Longer A Secret

My stomach somersaults. Tonight? Sebastian's cryptic comment yesterday makes sudden sense—he knew about this. Which means...

Hands trembling, I lift the lid.

The peacock-blue dress glimmers under the lights. Off-shoulder neckline dripping with crystals. Flowing chiffon skirt designed for dancing. Beneath it, a jewelry box reveals emerald earrings and matching pendant—real stones if I'm not mistaken. The price tag could feed a small pack for months.

A smaller note flutters down: The emeralds match your eyes when you come for me.

I nearly drop the necklace.

How does he—

The realization hits like lightning.

Only one person has seen that particular shade of green in my eyes.

And he's been watching me far longer than I ever guessed.

###Chapter 0046

I'm so mesmerized by the gifts that I don't notice my father entering. "Evelyn, training began half an hour ago."

My head snaps toward the clock. Shit. I'm late. "Dad, look what my secret admirer left for me."

I hold up the dress and jewelry. His eyebrows shoot up. "Planning to wear that tonight, sweetheart?"

"Obviously. Do you think these gems are real?" I examine the necklace closely.

He leans in, inspecting them. "Without a doubt."

"No fucking way, dad!"

"Language, Evelyn."

"Come on! Some guy just dropped serious cash on me for one night and I can't swear about it?"

Dad chuckles. "Take these upstairs and get to training. We'll discuss this later."

I rush to my room, then sprint to the training grounds.

The warriors give me hell for being late. Alpha Alistair makes me run laps before letting me wipe the floor with everyone. Good. I needed to burn off this nervous energy. When I finish demolishing his best fighters, I smirk at him. "Care for a rematch, Alpha?"

He shakes his head. "Not today, Evelyn. I may be getting old, but I'm not suicidal." Laughing, I head to the forest to change before going home.

I spend hours preparing - soaking in the tub, perfecting my makeup, styling my hair. Losing Mom young means I rarely miss having a mother...except at times like this. I can almost see her helping me get ready, speculating about my mystery man. The thought stings. I haven't visited her memorial in too long. I'll go this weekend.

I create a tousled French twist, using emerald hairpins that complement the earrings. Loose curls frame my face, softening the look.

Smoky plum eyeshadow, winged liner, and mascara accentuate my eyes. A touch of blush and glossy pink lips complete the makeup.

The dress fits perfectly. The jewelry transforms me. Strappy black heels add the final touch. The updo showcases the earrings, while the sweetheart neckline highlights the necklace. I never dress like this, but tonight? I feel like royalty.

Dad whistles when I descend the stairs. "Should I prepare to battle every unmated male tonight?"

"Dad!" I roll my eyes. "Sebastian AND my secret admirer will be there. I think we're covered."

"Great. Only two men to fight off then," he mutters.

I kiss his cheek. "Speaking of fighting people off...you clean up nicely. Might have to protect you from all those single women tonight."

He gives me that look - the one that says I've said something ridiculous. "Evelyn, my heart only ever had room for two women - you and your mother. Wolves mate for life. No one could ever compare to her."

I sigh. We've had this talk before. "Fine. Don't say I didn't warn you."

"Let's go. We're fashionably late already." He changes the subject. I climb into his specially modified van - equipped with hand controls and a ramp so he can drive independently.

The club looks incredible. Must have taken an army to decorate. Valet takes the van. I wait for Dad to join me, then take his offered arm.

"Ready?"

I exhale slowly. "Ready." We step inside together.

###Chapter 0047

The morning of my birthday arrives with golden sunlight streaming through my curtains. I'm up before dawn, determined to make this day entirely mine. And what better way to start than watching Evelyn dominate my warriors in training?

I press against the windowsill, anticipation humming through me. Minutes tick by. No sign of her. My stomach knots. Evelyn never misses training.

A cold thought slithers in—what if something happened? What if Sebastian showed up early to finish what he started last night?

Just as I grab my jacket to check on her, a flash of silver darts from the treeline. Selene. Evelyn's wolf. The tension in my shoulders unravels.

She bursts onto the field to a chorus of teasing from the warriors. My father makes her run laps before sparring—probably hoping to tire her out. Joke's on them. Within minutes, she's wiping the floor with every challenger.

Then she does something unexpected. She challenges my father. Again.

My eyebrows shoot up. When did they spar before? His muttered comment about being "old but not stupid" takes on new meaning. If Evelyn bested him... pride swells in my chest. Of course she could.

Next week can't come soon enough. I've waited months to train with her properly, to feel her strength matched against mine. After tonight, she'll know everything. Monday morning, I'll finally get my answer—can Evelyn Sinclair take me down?

The thought sends a thrill down my spine.

——

Post-training, I shower quickly. The scent of maple bacon leads me downstairs where my family waits. The dining room erupts in cheers as I enter.

"Happy birthday, my beautiful boy," Mother says, hands clasped like she's holding back from pinching my cheeks.

I kiss her forehead. "I stopped being a boy when I hit six feet, Mom."

"Never to me," she counters, eyes glistening.

Father embraces me next. "Happy birthday, son." His whisper tickles my ear: "Catch any... tempting scents this morning?"

I shake my head with a wry smile. "Just breakfast."

The omegas parade in with heaping platters. Every unmated she-wolf in the pack seems to have turned up, yet none stir my wolf.

Donovan slides beside me with a wrapped box. "Happy birthday, Alpha. Open it with our future mates or I'm taking it back."

Inside rests a bottle of WhistlePig Boss Hog VII. My whistle echoes through the hall. "Damn, Donovan! This deserves a proper occasion—mating ceremonies, pups' births..." I grip his shoulder. "Maybe we'll crack it tonight if things go well."

He grins. "So what's the plan?"

"Killing time until the main event. Everything's set."

"Let's run the perimeter then. Maybe your nose will catch something interesting."

——

For two glorious hours, we race through the territory. At a secluded lake, we let our wolves drink while Orion nudges Theron.

Ready for tonight? Donovan links.

Born ready. Just hope she doesn't bolt when she realizes it's a setup.

On your birthday? She'd have to be heartless.

Exactly why it'll work. At least at first... after that, I'll need every ounce of charm I possess.

Orion bumps against Theron. Whatever happens, I've got your back.

The water ripples as our wolves lift their heads, ears pricked toward home. Time to prepare for the most important night of my life.

###Chapter 0048

The moment we return to the packhouse, preparations begin in earnest. Another quick shower later, I slip into tailored black dress pants and the custom black shirt with emerald cuffs I'd commissioned to match Evelyn's gown. My fingers tremble slightly as I fasten the buttons. This could be the night everything changes.

A man bun and polished oxfords complete the look. I pause outside my parents' suite, knuckles hovering over the wood. Childhood trauma taught me to always wait for permission - some parental activities can't be unseen. My spine shudders at the memory.

"Come in, darling," Mother's voice floats through the door.

I find her adjusting diamond studs at the vanity. "Stunning as always, Mother."

"Flatterer." She winks in the mirror. "Your father's nearly ready."

The man himself emerges from the walk-in, still buttoning his cuffs. "Go ahead with Donovan if you're eager. We'll follow shortly."

Downstairs on the Beta level, I knock once before entering Donovan's quarters. No feminine scent lingers in the air - safe territory. "You decent?"

"Almost." He runs a brush through his golden waves before turning. "Damn, that's sharp." Within seconds, he's mimicked my hairstyle.

"Less fuss," I shrug.

"Spoken like a man with priorities," he grins, tossing me a hair tie. "Priorities that don't involve hairstyling."

Our laughter dies abruptly at the base of the stairs. The cloying stench of roses assaults my senses. Bianca stands frozen in a crimson catastrophe of a dress - plunging neckline threatening structural failure, hemline barely covering essentials. How had I ever found this appealing?

"Bianca." My voice could frost glass. "Why aren't you at the venue?"

She attempts a seductive saunter that lands somewhere between wounded gazelle and intoxicated flamingo. "I'm your date, remember?" Her taloned fingers trail up my chest.

Donovan chokes back laughter. "Since when?"

"Yesterday at campus!" She pouts. "You said 'sure' when I suggested we go together."

My brows collide. "Did I actually respond, or did you take silence as consent?"

Before I can erupt, Donovan intervenes. "The Alpha needs to appear available tonight. Potential mate situation, you understand." His elbow jabs my ribs. "But we've got limo space if you need transport."

Her squeal could shatter crystal. I find myself morbidly fascinated by the physics-defying containment of her assets as she bounces.

The ride proves excruciating. Bianca wedges herself between us in the backseat, perfume thick enough to choke a lesser wolf. "Twenty credits says the girls escape before midnight," Donovan whispers as we exit the vehicle.

"All yours, brother." I shrug free of Bianca's grip the moment we enter the pulsating lights of the club. "I've got bigger prey tonight."

Thank the Moon Goddess. No sign of Evelyn yet - she didn't witness that tragic entrance. The bar beckons like an oasis. I need fortification before my real quarry arrives.

###Chapter 0049

My stomach churns violently as we approach the club entrance. It's like a hive of angry wasps has taken up residence in my gut.

The moment we step inside, the entire room falls silent. Every head turns toward my father and me. Heat floods my cheeks, and I'm about to bolt when I notice something remarkable.

Every warrior in the room bows their head simultaneously in respect to my father. I'd almost forgotten how rarely the pack sees him. Without me living with him and Alpha Alistair's weekly visits, people would think he's a complete recluse.

Luna Seraphina glides toward us with Alpha Alistair trailing behind. She takes both my hands in hers, her eyes sparkling as she admires my appearance. Meanwhile, Alistair shakes my father's hand and offers him a drink before leading him toward the group of starstruck warriors.

"You look absolutely stunning," Luna Seraphina murmurs, her gaze lingering on my jewelry. I instinctively touch the pendant at my throat.

"Did you have this specially made?" she asks warmly.

"No, Luna. It was a gift."

"What a thoughtful present. Come, my son is eager to meet you properly."

I force a smile. What choice do I have? It's his birthday celebration, and she personally invited me. Glancing across the room, I see Adrian welcoming my father while his eyes remain locked on me.

Reluctantly, I follow Luna Seraphina toward where Adrian stands with Alpha Alistair and my father. The warriors are already swarming my dad, especially those from his generation. He's practically a living legend - any worthy fighter knows his reputation and seizes this rare chance to speak with him.

My attention snaps back when Luna Seraphina stops us before Adrian. "Adrian, this is Evelyn Sinclair, daughter of Grant and Ivy Sinclair." She turns to me. "Evelyn, meet my son Adrian."

I can't resist the jab. "Thank you, Luna, but we've actually met before."

Her brow furrows as she looks between us. "Oh? Adrian told me he'd never met you. How embarrassing - seems I'm late to the party."

Guilt stabs me. I only meant to make Adrian uncomfortable, not upset his mother.

"It was just a brief exchange at school," I quickly explain. "Nothing worth mentioning."



Her fingers trail up my chest. "What's wrong? I'm your date, remember?"

I stare at her like she's lost her mind. "Excuse me?" Donovan chimes in, "Yeah Bianca, what exactly are you talking about?"

She gives me that look people reserve for the mentally deficient. "Yesterday at school. I suggested we go together to your party today."

My eyebrows knit together. "When did this happen? And did I actually agree?"

"We were talking yesterday morning," she insists. "When I asked, you said 'Sure.'" That supposedly seductive smile reappears. "So here I am. And look - we even match."

I'm about to explode when Donovan intervenes. "The Alpha can't have people thinking he's bringing a date tonight - not when he might meet his mate now that he's eighteen. But you're welcome to ride with us if you need transportation."

I shoot him a look, but he just shrugs. She squeals and bounces excitedly, and I'll admit I watched with morbid fascination, waiting to see if her breasts would escape that ridiculously tight dress. Miraculously, they stayed put.

We head to one of the waiting limos. Donovan opens the door for Bianca and whispers as I climb in, "We should start a betting pool on whether those things pop out tonight."

"All yours, man. I've got other plans."

"No problem," he says, clapping my shoulder. "Always happy to be your wingman."

When we arrive at the club my mother rented, Bianca wedges herself between Donovan and me, linking arms with both of us. The second we're inside, I disentangle myself and make a beeline for the bar.

Thank the moon Evelyn hasn't arrived yet to witness this disaster.

###Chapter 0050

His gaze locks onto mine. "Let Selene come forward." I obey, allowing my wolf spirit to surface. Julian steps closer and lets out a low whistle. "Damn."

A few nearby warriors turn at the sound, their eyes widening as they take me in. Their reactions range from stunned silence to muttered curses. "What?" I snap, impatient.

Sebastian studies me with a soft smile. "Those jewels your mystery man gave you? They're an exact match for your eyes when Selene's in control. That emerald green with gold flecks—it's uncanny. Whoever he is, he's putting us all to shame. He's clearly obsessed with you, Evelyn. If he's not your mate, he's determined to make you believe he is."

Julian grins, immediately jumping in. "New wager. Odds on the secret admirer being Evelyn's fated mate?" The betting starts before I can protest.

"Are you idiots forgetting I'm still months away from turning eighteen?"

They ignore me completely, tossing numbers back and forth.

Rolling my eyes, I turn back to my father. He's deep in conversation, so I gesture to his empty glass, silently offering a refill. He nods, and I head toward the bar. I could use a drink myself.

I order a whiskey neat for Dad and a merlot for me. Scanning the room, my gaze lands on Adrian's harem, clustered around him like overeager groupies. One girl wears what looks like a repurposed tablecloth—scarlet and barely covering anything.

Shaking my head, I reach for the drinks when heat presses against my back. A familiar voice murmurs in my ear, "Should I be worried you're ordering two drinks?"

I spin to face him. "Alpha Sebastian." My lips curve into a smile. "What a pleasant surprise."

He flags down the bartender, barely glancing away from me. "Trust me, sweetheart, the pleasure's all mine. You're breathtaking."

"Flattery will get you everywhere," I tease, deciding against mentioning my anonymous gift—or that the sender plans to reveal himself tonight. Sebastian already seems to sense tonight's significance.

"Care to join me by my father?" I ask.

He gives me a look that could melt steel. "I'd follow you into a burning building."

He grabs his bourbon and trails me across the room.

I toss him a smirk over my shoulder as we approach Dad and the warriors. Introductions are made, hands shaken. Turning back to Sebastian, I ask, "Did you already wish the birthday boy well?"

He takes a slow sip of his drink, eyes darkening in a way that sends heat straight to my core. Memories of last night—his skilled fingers, my breathless moans—flood my mind. He licks his lips. "Got distracted the second I saw you."

These lace panties won't survive another minute of this.

Before I can respond, Alpha Alistair taps his glass for silence. The room stills as he begins his speech.

"As you know, today marks my son's eighteenth year. He's a man now, soon to lead this pack." Cheers erupt. Sebastian and I offer polite applause.

Alistair turns to Adrian, pride shining in his eyes. "Son, my greatest wish for you is to find a love like I share with your mother. To meet your mate, to build a family." The crowd howls approval.

He raises a hand. "Until then, enjoy this." He tosses Adrian a set of keys. A freaking car. Must be nice.

Adrian embraces his parents before taking the mic. "Thank you all for celebrating with me." His eyes find mine, and my breath hitches. Was that meant for me?

"I hope to find my Luna before taking my father's place," he continues. "A partner to rule beside me." More cheers.

"Now, I'd like to open the dancing with someone very special." The girl in the red tablecloth preens, clearly expecting to be chosen.

I turn to Sebastian, ready to chat while Adrian entertains his latest fling—until his next words steal the air from my lungs.

"Evelyn Sinclair, may I have this dance?"

The room vanishes. All I see is his outstretched hand.

###Chapter 0051

The moment I grab my drink, pack members of all ages surround me, showering me with birthday wishes. My gaze keeps darting across the room, searching for Evelyn. I need to know if she's wearing the dress I picked for her. Everything tonight hinges on that.

Donovan pulls me away from the crowd. Just as I'm about to thank him, the room falls silent.

I turn toward the entrance. Evelyn and her father stand there. Mate! Theron's voice erupts in my mind. A grin spreads across my face. Yeah, she is.

Theron is practically vibrating with excitement. Cool it, I tell him. She's not eighteen yet. Selene won't recognize us as her mate for another few months. That settles him slightly, but he keeps pacing in my head. Relax. Stick to the plan. She'll be in our arms soon enough.

She’s breathtaking. The dress fits her perfectly—elegant, commanding, like she was born to be a Luna. My Luna. Strong. Regal. Flawless. And right now, looking like she might bolt. The flush on her cheeks gives away how much she hates the attention.

Out of the corner of my eye, I catch my warriors dipping their heads in respect. Grant Sinclair swallows hard, his eyes glistening at the gesture. Before I can move, my mother is already striding toward them, my father close behind.

I watch as Mom approaches Evelyn while Dad greets Grant. As Dad leads him away, Evelyn’s fingers brush her necklace. My mother is sharp. Whatever she’s asking, she’ll know I gave Evelyn that jewelry.

Time to meet the man who saved my father’s life.

I join them just as Dad pulls me into the circle of warriors. "Son, meet the greatest man I’ve ever known—the reason I’m still standing here today. Grant Sinclair."

He turns to Grant. "This is my son, Adrian."

I extend my hand. "It’s an honor, sir. My parents have spoken highly of you and your family for years."

"Alpha Adrian, the pleasure is mine."

While Dad introduces the others, my attention drifts back to Evelyn. Our eyes lock just as my mother guides her toward me—no doubt for formal introductions.

Evelyn beats me to it, smoothly covering our previous encounters with a quick, "Pleased to meet you," though I catch the subtle jab in her tone. She feels guilty for confusing my mother, but not enough to hesitate in putting me on the spot.

Her hand slips into mine, and the contact sends electric warmth up my arm, sparking across my lips as I press a kiss to her knuckles. Theron purrs in approval. Two more months until her birthday. Torture. Glorious, agonizing torture.

"The pleasure is all mine, Evelyn." Her cheeks flush deeper. Is the bond affecting her too? As a Guardian, maybe she senses it stronger than most. Theron and I already knew—today just confirmed it.

I don’t want to let go, but another couple approaches to wish me happy birthday. Reluctantly, I release her, but not without murmuring, "Save me a dance."

Then I watch her walk away, back toward my father and the growing circle of warriors around Grant Sinclair.

###Chapter 0052

The crowd swallows me whole.

Unmated females press closer, their questions buzzing like gnats around my head. When will I take my father's place? Will there be a celebration? Have I found my destined mate?

My answers are automatic.

All my attention is fixed across the room where Evelyn stands.

Sebastian and his warriors have cornered her near the bar. Their eyes keep dropping to the emerald pendant resting against her collarbone—the exact shade of Selene's eyes when the moonlight hits them just right.

Theron snarls inside my skull.

Move. Now.

Before I can escape the circling vultures, Bianca shoves her way to my side. Her perfume cloys like rotting roses.

Then I spot him.

Sebastian Nightshade strides through the doorway, scanning the room with predator's focus. When his gaze lands on Evelyn, my canines lengthen.

"Alpha Grey? Are you unwell?" Some doe-eyed girl touches my arm.

"Fine." I shake her off without breaking eye contact with the interloper. "Have you seen my parents?"

Bianca seizes the opportunity. "They're by the stage, darling. Shall I—"

"No."

I shoulder through the crowd just as Sebastian leans in to whisper something that makes Evelyn's cheeks flush pink. Theron howls with rage.

My father's voice booms across the gathering before Sebastian can finish whatever poison he's dripping in her ear.

The speech is predictable—legacy, leadership, finding a Luna worthy of the Grey bloodline.

When he tosses me the Porsche keys, the weight of expectation settles on my shoulders heavier than the metal in my palm.

Then the moment arrives.

Mic in hand, I lock eyes with Evelyn as the opening chords of Perfect fill the air.

"Evelyn Sinclair." My voice carries across the silent room. "Dance with me."

Sebastian goes rigid.

Evelyn's gasp is audible. She stares at my outstretched hand like it might bite her.

When her fingers finally brush mine, electricity arcs up my arm.

Theron purrs.

Mine.

###Chapter 0053

His outstretched hand hovered between us. I blinked at it, momentarily stunned. What game was Adrian playing now?

Swallowing my hesitation, I placed my hand in his. The entire Blackthorn Pack watched us. Refusing would cause a scene I couldn't afford.

His fingers closed around mine, warm and firm. In one smooth motion, he pulled me against him, his other hand settling at the small of my back. The music swelled as we began to move.

That's when I noticed it. The subtle silver embroidery along his collar and cuffs matched the shimmering threads in my dress perfectly. To any observer, we looked like a coordinated couple.

His gaze burned into me, lips curved in that infuriating smirk. The music would mask our words if we kept them low.

"What's this about?" I forced a smile for the watching crowd.

"Whatever do you mean, Evelyn?" His voice dripped with false innocence.

"This dance. Why me?"

"It's my birthday. I choose my partner." His fingers flexed against my back. "I chose you."

"Don't play dumb. Half the women here would kill for this dance. Why pick someone you didn't even recognize an hour ago?"

"Ah, but that's where you're wrong." His eyes darkened. "I didn't know Evelyn Sinclair stood before me. But I've always known of Evelyn Sinclair."

My smile faltered. "Semantics."

The intensity of his stare could have melted steel. "Evelyn Sinclair is the daughter of Ivy Sinclair. Ivy gave her life protecting my mother and me during an attack when I was six. I remember every second of that day."

My breath caught.

"Evelyn is also daughter to Grant Sinclair," he continued. "Grant saved my father's life in that same battle, though it cost him the use of his legs. My father brought in every specialist - wolf and human - to try healing his spine."

I hadn't known Alpha Alistair went to such lengths. My father never spoke of it.

"Every Thursday without fail, my father dines with Grant Sinclair." Adrian's voice dropped. "Since childhood, I've begged to join them. But Father insists that's his time with his friend. And since he ordered the pack to respect Grant's privacy..."

His jaw tightened. "So instead, every Thursday, I accompany my mother to Ivy Sinclair's memorial. We lay flowers. We give thanks."

Theron's presence shimmered in Adrian's darkened eyes. Even his wolf showed reverence speaking of my parents. I felt Selene stir within me, equally affected.

"I owe my family's survival to two of the greatest warriors this pack has ever known." His grip on my hand tightened. "I've searched for Evelyn Sinclair at every gathering, every event. For years."

The music swirled around us as he spun me gently.

"I needed to meet the woman destined to be my Guardian. The one who'll swear her life to protect me as Alpha." His breath warmed my ear. "More than that, I needed her to know me. To understand I'll be an Alpha worthy of that sacrifice. Someone she can be proud to serve."


###Chapter 0054

"Do I know who Evelyn Sinclair is? Of course I do. Did I realize YOU were Evelyn Sinclair? Not until last week. Not until I saw you at school and felt this undeniable pull toward you."

I gaped at him, speechless.

"All this time," I whispered, shaking my head slightly. "All this time, I thought you had no clue who I was or what my family had sacrificed for yours. When you strutted up to me at school, all arrogance and swagger—" A small smile tugged at my lips. "—it just confirmed that you had no idea who I was. That you didn’t respect what my family had given up for yours."

His arm tightened around me, pressing us closer until only our clothes separated us. His warmth seeped into my skin, his words sinking deep into my heart. He leaned his forehead against mine.

"Nothing could be further from the truth. And I meant what I said. I want you to know me. I want us to learn each other. I want you to feel pride in being my Guardian, not like it’s some burden you and Selene have to bear."

We swayed together for a few more steps before I finally registered the song playing.

"Perfect? Seriously? How did you end up stuck dancing to this with me, Alpha?"

He lifted his head, one brow arched. "I picked it."

I jerked back. "You picked it?"

He grinned. "Yep. There were a few contenders, but this one won."

"What were the other options?" I asked, curious.

"All of Me was a close second. Lover, but that felt too soon." I scoffed.

A wicked smirk curved his lips. "Then there was that song from 50 Shades of Grey. If you're into that kind of thing, I’d be happy to oblige." He wiggled his eyebrows suggestively.

A laugh burst out of me, my cheeks burning. I quickly steered the conversation elsewhere. "So why this one?"

"None of them fit perfectly, but this one came closest. Especially since you’re wearing the dress and jewelry I got for you."

I nearly stumbled. He caught me effortlessly, his hands steadying me until I found my footing again.

"You?" My voice was barely audible. "You’re my mystery man?"

"I am."

Selene surged forward, needing to see the man—the wolf—who had honored her. I watched as Theron emerged, and Adrian’s icy blue eyes darkened to deep sapphire.

"I... Thank you." Selene’s voice layered with mine, deepening my words.

He smiled—soft, tender, full of promise. "You’re welcome." His voice, too, was richer with Theron’s presence.

"Is it true about the jewelry? That you had it made because it matches my eyes when Selene shines through?"

"Yes." He shifted slightly, almost sheepish. "Would it sound creepy if I admitted I’ve dreamed about those eyes more than once this week?"

I smirked. "Depends on what I was doing in those dreams while you were staring at my... eyes." I licked my lips deliberately. If his dreams were anything like mine, they were far from innocent.

His gaze dropped to my mouth, then flicked back up, his expression boyishly guilty. "Hmm. Sounds like you’re finally warming up to the idea of getting to know me. Maybe we save the dream talk for our second date?"

"Second date? You’re counting this as a date, Alpha?" I teased.

"Adrian. Call me Adrian. And no. When I take you on a real date, you’ll know."

The song faded, and he sang the last line softly against my ear. "You look perfect tonight."

We stood there, lost in each other, the rest of the world forgotten.

He opened his mouth to speak—

Then chaos erupted.

And now Evelyn knows. Not only does Adrian recognize her, but he’s the one who’s been watching over her all along.


###Chapter 0055

Everything unfolded exactly as I'd envisioned. I anticipated her initial anger, but unless she caused a scene by storming off the dance floor, I had precisely four and a half minutes to bare my soul.

The transformation in Selene was immediate when I began recounting her parents' sacrifices. Her lips parted in shock as I detailed everything her family had done for mine.

Theron surged forward in my mind, desperate to join this moment. He needed Evelyn to understand his gratitude too. The effect was instantaneous - I felt Selene pressing forward, engaging with us both.

The jewelry was absolutely perfect. When Selene emerged, those sapphire eyes that haunted my dreams matched the gems perfectly. Though completely absorbed in her, I maintained our dance effortlessly. To my delight, she followed my lead without hesitation. Flawless.

I confessed how I'd yearned to meet her at every pack gathering for years. This was crucial - she needed to fall for me before her eighteenth birthday when the mate bond would awaken. I wanted her to choose me freely, without supernatural compulsion.

Her shock was palpable as she struggled to reconcile this revelation with her lifelong perception of me. Drawing her closer sent electric currents through my body, even through layers of fabric. When our foreheads touched, skin to skin, I made sure she couldn't look away. This was just the beginning of what we could be.

The moment became overwhelming for her. She deflected by asking about my song choice, clearly startled when I admitted choosing it for her. Her blush when I mentioned "50 Shades of Grey" was adorable, though she ignored my teasing question about her preferences.

When I revealed I'd purchased her dress and jewelry, I was ready when her steps faltered, smoothly adjusting to maintain our seamless dance.

As Selene and Evelyn both expressed gratitude, Theron answered alongside me. After years of longing to hold her, he was finally content, practically purring in my mind.

Her question about the jewelry confirmed someone recognized my gesture. Not surprising for anyone who'd seen Selene's striking eyes. I took a risk, admitting I'd dreamed of her, praying she wouldn't press for details. That mischievous smile suggested she might have dreamed of me too. Goddess, I hoped so.

When her tongue darted across her lips, every fiber of my being ached to kiss her. "Do it! Now!" Theron demanded. But I resisted - she wasn't ready yet. Instead, I teased that I'd save our first kiss for our second date, ensuring she'd see me again.

Her playful grin when she asked if this counted as a date reminded me why I nearly chose "All of Me." Those clever lips would soon learn their reckoning when she sassed me - but not today.

I needed her to see me as Adrian first - her lover, mate, and partner - not just her future Alpha. When I take her out properly, there'll be no question it's a date. Other girls fell at my feet, content with empty promises of being Luna. Evelyn deserved so much more.

###Chapter 0056

Evelyn is extraordinary. And I need her to feel that truth every single day for as long as she lives. There should never be a shadow of doubt in her mind—she is my one and only. From the second I spotted her across the campus quad, no one else has ever come close.

The song fades, but I can't resist singing the final line directly to her. She's flawless, in every possible way.

Her eyes hold me captive. We might have stayed like that forever if chaos hadn't erupted.

The patrols' warning howls shatter the moment at the same instant wolves burst into the clubhouse from all directions. I shove Evelyn behind me as two rogues charge. My shift is instantaneous, clothes tearing away as Theron takes over. The stench of rot confirms their rogue status. Around us, warriors transform, the air thick with snarls and the metallic tang of blood.

My father's command echoes through the mindlink. "Warriors, clear these rogues! Protect the vulnerable!" He's right—the room is packed with pregnant females, pups, and elders who can't defend themselves.

I broadcast my own order. "Non-combatants, move to the bathrooms. Warriors, form a shield wall!" A rogue lunges at a pregnant female clutching her pup. Her mate is pinned down. I intercept, tearing the attacker's throat out. The female meets my gaze, then bolts toward safety with her child.

Evelyn hasn't shifted, but she's holding her own—slashing rogue throats with her claws while herding others toward the back. A pup stumbles into her path. She snatches the child up, pivoting just in time to gut a leaping rogue. Then she's moving again, depositing the pup behind the warrior barricade.

Her father stands at the barrier's center, his golden eyes blazing like twin suns as he barks orders. Despite his wheelchair, Gregory Sinclair is a force of nature. I watch him casually decapitate a rogue mid-leap, Evander's power undeniable.

More rogues flood in. My father, Sebastian, Donovan, and our warriors tear through them, but the numbers keep swelling. Where are they all coming from? I'm ripping through another group when an external howl sounds. The rogues suddenly retreat.

Oh hell no. You don't get to run.

I pursue outside—and freeze. Hundreds of rogues surround the building. On a distant hill, their leader locks eyes with me. His wolf smirks before fleeing. Coward.

Theron gives chase. The rogue Alpha is fast, but we're faster. Just as we close in, he veers into bushes. We follow—straight into a clearing reeking of ambush. Twenty wolves encircle us.

Theron snarls, fangs bared. The leader shifts back, grinning. "Alpha Adrian, so kind of you to join us."

Pain erupts in my hindquarters. Wolfsbane-dipped darts. The poison floods my veins, forcing my shift as Theron collapses.

Human and helpless, I glare up as the leader approaches with silver restraints. "Now," he purrs, "we wait for your Guardian."

A trap for Evelyn???

###Chapter 0057

The rogue wolves burst through the clubhouse walls in a frenzy. Adrian shoves me behind his massive frame, shifting mid-motion to take down two attackers before they can blink. I barely register the fluidity of his transformation before three more wolves charge at me.

Selene surges forward, claws extending, when Alpha Alistair's command booms across the chaos. "Warriors to the front! Get the vulnerable to safety!" My gaze sweeps the room - elderly wolves trembling in corners, mothers clutching whimpering pups. My human form will serve better here.

We form a protective wedge, Selene's razor-sharp claws carving through any rogue stupid enough to approach. I spot Gregory maneuvering his wheelchair toward the evacuation point, already barking orders to establish defensive lines.

A high-pitched whimper cuts through the noise. A tiny pup, no older than four, cowers beneath an overturned table. A rogue lunges for her exposed back. Selene strikes like lightning, her claws opening the attacker from shoulder to hip in one brutal swipe. I scoop up the shaking child as the rogue collapses in a gurgling heap.

Another beast springs at us. I twist, shielding the pup with my body while driving my free hand into the wolf's throat. Hot blood sprays my arm as its lifeless body hits the floor. Gregory's voice rings out when I deposit the child behind warrior lines.

"Evelyn! To Alpha Adrian - now!" His wheelchair pivots toward the breach. "Guard your future Alpha!"

I'm already moving when an unearthly howl reverberates through the shattered walls. The rogues disengage simultaneously, retreating through the gaps they created. Through the dust and debris, I spot Theron's massive form leaping through a gaping hole in the eastern wall.

Selene takes control, our shift rippling through me in seconds. The scene outside chills my blood - at least fifty rogues encircling the building, their yellowed fangs gleaming. Selene's warning howl shatters the night, alerting our warriors to the true threat.

Alpha Alistair's mindlink burns in my skull. I report the overwhelming numbers and Adrian's disappearance before severing the connection. His scent trail leads northeast, tainted with something acrid. Wolfsbane. Selene's growl vibrates through my chest.

'Trap.' Her mental voice drips with disdain. 'Theron's gone silent.'

I mindlink Gregory the situation before plunging through the undergrowth. The clearing beyond reveals our worst fears. A mountain of a man - easily seven feet tall with muscles stacked like cordwood - holds Adrian by his hair, a serrated blade kissing his throat. My Alpha kneels naked in the dirt, wolfsbane-laced shackles burning his wrists.

Twenty-five sets of glowing eyes emerge from the tree line. One makes the fatal mistake of entering my strike zone. Selene tears out his jugular before he can whimper.

"Guardian!" The giant's voice rumbles like distant thunder. His dark eyes rake over my shifted form with unsettling interest. Adrian snarls violently when I shift back to human skin, his restraints clanking against the wolfsbane weakening him.

The leader tosses me a rancid-smelling shirt. I slip it on without breaking eye contact. "You know what I am," I say, rolling my shoulders. "Which makes you either suicidal or brain-damaged for touching my Alpha."

His laughter dies abruptly when ten wolfsbane darts thud into my chest. Adrian's roar of fury shakes the trees as I pluck the first dart free. "Really?" I flick the toxin-coated projectile into the dirt. "I eat wolfsbane for breakfast."

Nine more darts follow as Selene's power surges through my veins. The rogues shrink back when my eyes flare gamma-bright. The leader's smirk falters for the first time.

Game on.

###Chapter 0058

Victor's eyes flicker with fear for just a second before it morphs into something darker. Hunger. Desire. The look makes my skin crawl.

"Admittedly, I had high expectations for you, Guardian," he rasps, voice dripping with lust. "But you're already surpassing them."

A cruel smile twists his lips as his gaze darkens.

"You have no idea what hell you've unleashed," I snarl, unleashing Selene's full power.

The surrounding wolves collapse instantly, whimpering in submission. Four more tumble from the trees, dart guns clattering beside them. Even Adrian is sweating under the force of my aura.

Victor alone resists, muscles straining as I focus my energy on him.

"Enough!" He presses the blade deeper into Adrian's throat. A thin line of blood appears. "Drop it or I slit his throat."

"Kill my Alpha, and you lose your only bargaining chip," I counter. But I release the pressure.

The rogue wolves pant heavily, some still writhing in pain. I lock eyes with Victor. "I know who you are. The Banished Beta of Obsidian Moon."

He gives a mocking bow. "Close. I'm an Alpha now."

I scoff. "You reek of Beta. Titles aren't earned through self-proclamation."

His snarl sends the blade kissing Adrian's skin again. "Spill more of my Alpha's blood, and your life is forfeit, Beta," I emphasize the word.

Selene's rage burns through me. She wants vengeance. Blood. I pace, calculating distances.

"So," I demand, "what does a false Alpha want with mine?"

"Future Alpha," Victor corrects with a sneer. "Since titles matter so much to you."

"He carries more Alpha essence in his pinky than you possess in your entire being."

Victor's jaw clenches. "Not for long. My plans are already in motion."

"Plans that involve kidnapping?" My voice drops to a lethal whisper. "Selene was named for the moon goddess of the hunt. We will track you to the ends of the earth if necessary."

"Fortunately," he taunts, "your Alpha's role concludes here."

My gaze flicks to Adrian's. I measure the distance. Calculate the odds. The resignation in his eyes tells me everything.

Still, I shift my weight forward.

"I'll make you an offer, Guardian." Victor's words freeze me mid-step.

"Which is?"

"Your Alpha was merely bait. What I truly want... is you."

"Me?" A bitter laugh escapes. Does he truly believe my loyalty can be bought?

"Come willingly, and I release him."

"NO!" Adrian thrashes against the blade. "I forbid it, Evelyn!"

Victor pats Adrian's cheek mockingly. "Poor pup. Alpha commands hold no power over Guardians." His gaze returns to me. "Well, Evelyn? Do we have a deal?"

"How do I know you'll honor it?"

"I'll leave him here, unconscious, for his pack to find." He tosses silver cuffs at my feet. "But struggle, and I kill him."

Adrian shakes his head violently.

This is my purpose. My destiny. And I know with absolute certainty - my father, my pack, Sebastian and Nightshade - they will burn the world to find me.

Victor Blackwood has just declared war.

"I agree."

Adrian's roar of protest cuts off as a needle pierces his neck. His body hits the ground with a thud.

"The cuffs, Guardian."

The silver sears my wrists the moment they click shut. Selene weakens but doesn't fade completely. Victor grips my arm with bruising force.

"Move."

He drags me into the shadows.

###Chapter 0059

The rogue wolves burst through the clubhouse entrance like a tidal wave. Warriors around me scatter in all directions, their bodies twisting mid-air as they shift into their wolf forms. Evander surges forward, eager to transform, but I grip his arm tightly. Our partially shifted state gives us the advantage here - extended claws and fangs ready for battle.

I position myself as a living shield between the attackers and our most vulnerable - the pups and those unable to fight.

Alpha Alistair's command rings through the mindlink like a thunderclap. He orders the non-combatants to safety and establishes a defensive perimeter. A private message follows, tasking me with leading the protective circle around our pack's weakest members.

Without hesitation, I begin carving a path toward my assigned position, dispatching rogue wolves with brutal efficiency.

Chaos reigns among our warriors when I arrive. They're scattered, directionless. My voice cuts through the confusion like a blade. "Form ranks! Protect the inner circle!"

The warriors snap into formation. Evelyn appears suddenly, shoving a terrified pup behind our defensive line.

"Get back to Alpha Adrian!" I command. "He needs you more than we do."

The haunting howl signaling the rogues' retreat echoes through the air. Evelyn leaps through a shattered wall section, her warning howl confirming our worst fears - we're vastly outnumbered.

I eliminate one last rogue attempting to slip past our defenses before assessing the damage behind our lines. The mindlink connects me to Dr. Whitmore instantly. "We need medical assistance immediately. Pups and pregnant females require attention."

Outside, the battle rages on. Our warriors refuse to let the attackers escape unscathed.

Then Evelyn's panicked mindlink shatters my focus. "Adrian's been taken! I'm going after him - it's a trap, but I have no choice!" The connection snaps shut before I can respond.

I attempt to reach Alistair, but his mental shields are up - undoubtedly engaged in combat. My teeth grind together. I should be fighting beside him.

As I maneuver toward an exit, a rogue wolf flies toward me. My left hand catches its throat while my right tears its head clean off. Orion's blood-streaked muzzle grins at me from across the room before he hurls another enemy in my direction.

We establish a deadly rhythm - warriors knock them down, I finish them off.

When the dust settles, Alistair approaches, clapping my shoulder. "Told you we still needed you, old friend."

"Alistair, listen-" I interrupt. "Evelyn linked me earlier. Adrian was captured. She went after him and I've heard nothing since."

"Location?" he demands, his Alpha persona taking over.

The answer dies on my lips as Evelyn's mindlink reactivates. "Adrian's unconscious in western territory. I traded myself for him. Send retrieval immediately. They're taking me somewhere... our bond is stronger than they realize." The connection fractures again.

Evander howls internally, overpowering my control. His massive wolf form erupts from my body, dragging us across the floor with powerful forelimbs despite his useless hindquarters. 'Our daughter needs us!'

Alistair grips Evander's scruff. "What happened? Talk to me!"

Through the mindlink, I relay Evelyn's message. Alistair barks orders for Adrian's retrieval before turning back to us. "Evander, we'll get her back. I swear it on my Alpha blood."

Sebastian steps forward. "Who's taken Evelyn?"

Alistair's gaze hardens. "Adrian was captured. Evelyn exchanged herself for him. He's unconscious; she's been taken."

Turning back to me, Alistair speaks with iron conviction. "Evander, yield to Gregory. My word as Alpha - we will bring your daughter home."

With visible reluctance, Evander recedes. As I regain human form, warriors bring my wheelchair. Alistair and Sebastian lift me into it with care. Someone drapes a towel across my lap, the mundane gesture absurd amidst the carnage.

The battle may be over, but the war has just begun.

###Chapter 0060

We need a strategy. First, we'll return to the packhouse and regroup. We've taken prisoners—they might have valuable intel.

I slip into my van, changing into fresh clothes. By the time I reach Blackthorn territory, they're dragging Adrian Grey inside.

Adrian

I'm furious with myself for getting caught. I should've seen the ambush coming.

When Evelyn—or rather, Selene—appears, I'm stunned by her wolf form's sheer size. In the training woods, I hadn't noticed. Now, she's unmistakably Alpha-tier. Her rich mahogany fur matches Evelyn's chestnut hair perfectly.

She scans the rogue wolves encircling her with lethal precision. My chest swells with pride when she tears into one who dares approach too close. Magnificent doesn't begin to cover it.

The rogue leader snarls when she kills his wolf, but his anger evaporates the second she shifts back. Naked. Exposed to their hungry stares. A vicious growl rips from my throat at their leering.

Small mercies—the bastard tosses her a shirt. Her nose wrinkles at the stench. Typical rogue filth.

Then comes the wolfsbane. My blood runs cold—until it becomes clear it doesn't affect her. Her rage is glorious. But when her aura erupts? Nothing in my Alpha experience compares. Other Alphas' auras roll off me. This? This was submission. Whether from Theron's unconscious state or her raw power, I can't tell. The other wolves whimper like pups. That's my mate. Absolute perfection.

The knife at my throat means nothing. If only one of us walks away, it must be her. She retracts her aura when he threatens me, then names him—Victor Blackwood. The Banished Beta. The name rings bells, but the memory slips through my fingers.

She's masterful at provoking him. And she's right—he reeks of rogue, not Alpha. Without Theron, I can't scent anything beyond the stench.

When he declares my part in this over, I brace for death. Having witnessed Evelyn's skills, I know she'll survive. The grief hits—she'll never realize we were mates. Maybe she and Sebastian will find happiness, though the thought churns my stomach.

Then he proposes the trade. Me for her. I have to try commanding her to stand down, knowing full well she'll refuse. I know the Sinclairs. Their legacy of sacrifice. They'd die for those they protect. And I can't—won't—live with her blood on my hands.

I've always respected the Sinclair family's sacrifice for mine. Now I understand my parents' haunted eyes. The crushing weight of owing someone your life? I'm not strong enough to bear it. Living without her isn't living. Theron wouldn't survive it either. She might not recognize our bond yet, but we do. Now that I've found her? There will never be another.

Victor mocks my stupidity. I ignore him, locking eyes with Evelyn. Begging silently. Shaking my head. But her resolve hardens—she accepts his terms. My roar of protest dies as a needle pierces my neck. Darkness swallows me whole.

###Chapter 0061

Victor pulls a thick hood over my head, plunging me into darkness. The fabric allows just enough air to breathe and faint slivers of light to penetrate, but nothing recognizable. We trek through the wilderness for hours before reaching a cluster of vehicles.

"Where are you taking me?" My question hangs in the air, unanswered like the dozen times before. Victor hasn't spoken a single word since we departed.

At a blacked-out SUV, he finally removes the hood and cracks open a water bottle. I accept the offering, letting him tilt the cool liquid into my mouth. Werewolves can endure dehydration, but I won't refuse resources when given.

The moment I finish, cold silver shackles clamp around my ankles. The hood descends again before rough hands shove me into the cargo area. A partition slides shut overhead, sealing me in complete blackness.

I seize the chance to mindlink my father. "Dad? Can you hear me?"

"EVELYN!" His mental voice cracks with relief. "Are you hurt? Where are you?"

"I'm unharmed. We've been moving west all night—I think. The hood makes it impossible to tell."

"Trackers picked up Adrian's scent where we found him. They're closing in on your trail."

"Is he—"

"Alive. The wolfsbane's still in his system, but he's stabilizing." His thoughts turn urgent. "Sweetheart, give me landmarks."

"Just a clearing with parked cars. I'm in a four-door SUV with a hatchback. No visible roads. Now they've covered me completely."

"Did Victor reveal his plans? Adrian said he's claiming Alpha status now."

"He mentioned having a plan when I challenged his scent. That's all I know."

My father's resolve strengthens our connection. "We're coming, Evelyn. Survive. Fight. Remember who you are—my daughter, a Guardian, a warrior!"

"You trained me well. I'll use every lesson." The vehicle lurches forward. "We're moving again. I'll contact you when possible. I love you, Dad."

"Stay strong, my heart."

The connection severs. Exhaustion weighs on me despite the danger. The rhythmic hum of tires eventually drags me under.

Voices arguing about rest stops jerk me awake. "I need to pee."

Silence. Then an unfamiliar male voice: "Hold it."

"For how long? It's been hours." I press the issue, hoping for a chance to gather intel.

Another pause. "Thirty minutes. No sooner."

He must be mindlinking Victor—which means my captor isn't in this vehicle. That could be an advantage or a deadly complication.

The SUV eventually slows, turning onto what feels like a dirt path. Each jolt sends fresh agony through my battered shoulders, but I bite back any sound.

When we finally stop, the hatch swings open. Light floods in as the partition lifts.

"Out." The command leaves no room for negotiation.

###Chapter 0062

"Sure thing, Mr. Grumpy Pants." I shift awkwardly to exit the car, my limbs stiff from the restraints. The moment my feet hit the ground, I straighten—only to be met with complete darkness.

"Uh, hello? You want me to pee right here? I can't see, and I can barely move, genius."

A growl rumbles from him as he yanks me forward, his rancid breath seeping through the hood. I gag. "Shut your mouth, little girl, or I'll shut it for you."

A vicious snarl cuts through the air. Suddenly, he’s ripped away from me.

The Beta.

Even through the rogue’s stench, I recognize his scent. "My apologies for my companion’s poor manners," he says smoothly, pulling the hood off my head. The sudden light makes me blink rapidly until my vision adjusts.

"Right. Kidnapping? Fine. Bad manners? Now that’s worth a beating."

"Has anyone ever told you your mouth is too smart for your own good?"

"Once or twice," I reply with a saccharine smile. "So, where’s this luxurious facility I’ve been promised?"

He leans in, his breath warm against my ear. "I’m going to enjoy breaking you in."

"Not happening, Beta," I emphasize his title.

"We’ll see." He guides me past the unconscious rogue who had threatened me earlier. The Beta leads me deeper into the woods, gesturing to a secluded spot. "Over there."

He turns away, giving me privacy.

"How exactly am I supposed to pee with my hands cuffed behind my back and my ankles shackled?"

He glances back, smirking. "Very carefully."

"Jerk," I mutter, knowing full well he hears me. I find a sturdy tree to brace against, maneuvering into a precarious squat.

While I relieve myself, I scan the surroundings—nothing but endless trees.

Selene, can you hear anything? Any clues where we are?

She stirs weakly, the silver suppressing her strength. Barely. I can’t pick up anything distinct.

Damn. Neither can I.

"Hurry up," Victor barks.

I do my best to shake off before shuffling back toward him. The forest offers no landmarks—no power lines, no distant sounds of civilization. Just wilderness.

"How much longer?" I ask.

"Still a while. Get comfortable." He motions me back to the car. The rogue remains unconscious on the ground. Will they just leave him?

I don’t ask. Instead, I relish the small victory—my hood stays off.

"It’s getting dark," Victor muses. "If you behave, I’ll leave the hood off for now."

"I’ll be an angel," I promise, flashing an innocent smile.

He snorts and orders me back into the car. The cargo cover drops over me again.

Voices murmur outside. Someone asks what to do with the unconscious rogue.

"Leave him. If he can’t follow orders, he doesn’t belong in this pack."

Interesting.

I reach out to my father through the mindlink. Dad?

Silence.

Dad, if you can hear me… we stopped in the middle of nowhere. Just woods. No signs of civilization. My scent’s here now. I’m okay.

Still nothing.

I rest my head back, closing my eyes. If there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s to conserve energy when I can.

###Chapter 0063

My eyelids flutter open, revealing the familiar ceiling of my bedroom. The IV needle stings in my arm as awareness floods back.

I shoot upright.

"EVELYN!"

My mother rushes to my side as I scramble off the mattress. "Adrian, wait—"

I yank the IV out. Blood beads on my skin. "I don't need a doctor. I need my mate."

The scent of pack leadership pulls me toward Father's office. I burst through the door without knocking.

"Where is she?" My voice cracks like thunder.

Father rises, palms raised. "We have trackers combing the territory—"

"You don't understand!" My fist slams the desk. "Victor wanted her. I was just bait!"

Grant Sinclair steps forward. His voice slices through my rage. "Alpha Adrian. Breathe."

He's the only one who could stop me from shifting right now. I suck in air through clenched teeth, scanning the room.

Father and Grant lead the strategy session. Sebastian's here with his Beta, Nathaniel. Benedict, Donovan's father, stands beside my friend.

I collapse into a chair. "I followed Victor when he appeared on the ridge. He ambushed me." My knuckles whiten. "When he had me pinned, he kept saying he wanted Evelyn."

Father leans forward. "Do you recognize him?"

"Evelyn called him the Banished Beta."

Sebastian vaults to his feet. "She said that? Those exact words?"

"Yes. Victor Blackwood, the Banished Beta."

Sebastian's fist connects with the wall. Plaster dust rains down. When he turns, his eyes burn with decades-old pain. "That monster murdered my mother."

The room temperature plummets.

Theron stirs in my chest, his rage fueling mine. Victor Blackwood—Isolde's killer—has my mate.

I surge to my feet. "Then why are we sitting here?"

Sebastian gets in my face. "We wouldn't be if you hadn't charged in like a reckless pup! And then what? You let your Guardian sacrifice herself?"

My fist flies toward his jaw.

Grant catches both our wrists mid-swing. His alpha aura slams into us like a tidal wave. "Enough!"

We freeze.

"Either help find my daughter," he growls, "or get out."

Sebastian and I glare at each other, chests heaving.

"Understood?" Grant barks.

We mutter simultaneous "Yes, sir" and drop back into our seats.

I rake hands through my hair. "Evelyn's my mate. I tried to stop her—used every alpha command I had. But she's her father's daughter." My gaze locks with Grant's. "Nothing would've stopped her from fulfilling her Guardian oath."

Theron howls inside me. The bond aches like an open wound. Somewhere out there, Evelyn's in the hands of a murderer. And I'll burn the world down to get her back.

###Chapter 0064

My peripheral vision catches Sebastian slamming back into his chair. "How can you be certain she's your mate?" His voice is tight.

"Theron knew instantly when we saw her yesterday. I chose not to tell her—wanted her to have space until her birthday. But now..." My fists clench.

"We'll locate her," my father states firmly.

They brief me on the trackers' findings—her scent trail leads west, mingled with the stench of rogues. Father and Sebastian hover over topographic maps when Grant Sinclair suddenly shouts, "Evelyn!"

The command center falls silent.

"She's alive. They've been moving all night." Grant's eyes lock onto mine as he relays her message aloud. "Yes, he's regained consciousness. Wolfsbane lingers, but he's stabilizing. Sweetheart, where are you?"

Bile rises in my throat. She's been abducted, gods know where, yet her first concern is my condition.

"They've taken her to a vehicle depot. Dark blue SUV, four-door hatchback. No visible roads now—she's blindfolded."

"Ask if she knows their objective," my father commands.

"Victor claims he's an Alpha now with some grand scheme. Evelyn doesn't have details."

"They're mobile." Grant moves to the map table. "If westbound, where would one conceal multiple vehicles?"

I stride over, spotting a wooded clearing twenty miles west near a service road. Sebastian's finger stabs the same location simultaneously. "There. Send teams immediately."

I pivot toward the door.

"Where do you think you're going?" Father demands.

"To bring her home."

Sebastian falls into step beside me. "I'm coming too." Our gazes clash, then I nod. Personal grievances can wait. All that matters is her safe return. And Sebastian? He's hunting for vengeance. If Victor murdered his mother, blood will spill tonight.

In the corridor, I grab his arm. "A word."

Sebastian jerks his chin at Nathaniel. "Meet me at the Jeep."

Once we're alone, I shove him against the wall. "She's my fated mate. You will not touch her."

He crowds into my space, our matching heights forcing eye contact. "Fate doesn't guarantee her choice. You barely knew her a week ago. And I question whether you truly see her—not just the Guardian, but the woman."

A growl rumbles through my chest as I press him harder against the drywall. "The mate bond exists beyond her power. Stay away from what's mine."

His eyes narrow to slits. "Fine. One condition." He waits, letting the tension coil tighter. "You don't interfere with our friendship. If she chooses me, you walk away."

Every instinct screams refusal. They share history I can't compete with. But I need this assurance. "Deal. Her decision." I extend a hand. His grip crushes mine in silent accord.

We separate, engines roaring to life minutes later. Time to test whether this Porsche Turbo lives up to its reputation.

###Chapter 0065

The first light of dawn barely touches the horizon when the vehicle finally halts. The door creaks open and I rise stiffly, my muscles screaming from hours of confinement. Before me stands a crumbling packhouse, its sagging roof and broken windows whispering of decades-long abandonment.

Victor's grip tightens around my arm as he leads me forward. "Welcome to your new home, Evelyn."

I survey the rotting porch beams. "Charming. Did you bring me here for demolition work? Because I specialize in destruction, not renovation."

Inside reveals a pathetic attempt at rehabilitation. A flickering bulb dangles above a rust-stained sink - proof of electricity, if nothing else. The living area boasts nothing but moth-eaten cushions and a couch that reeks of mildew. Faded rectangles on the wallpaper mark where framed pack photos once hung.

Victor spreads his arms. "The last remnants of Obsidian Moon Pack."

My eyes narrow. "Your original pack?" His slow nod carries the weight of buried memories.

"Correct. And with your help, we'll rebuild it stronger than before. Unstoppable."

"Let me process this insanity." I tick points off on my fingers. "Alpha Cassian destroyed your pack twenty years ago. As the exiled Beta heir, you think his death magically makes you Alpha now? And your master plan involves recruiting rogues and... what, exactly? Me?"

His smile turns predatory. "Rogues are temporary. You're the key to permanent power."

"Explain."

"As my mate, you'll bear heirs with Guardian blood. Our offspring will be invincible - strong enough to defend this territory forever."

Bile rises in my throat. "You're delusional. I'd rather die than be your mate."

"Your consent would be... convenient." His fingers trail down my neck. "But unnecessary. Once the bond takes hold, your body will betray you. We'll create the mightiest pack this continent has ever seen."

I laugh bitterly. "So your grand scheme is kidnapping a teenage Guardian to play breeding stock in your sad little fantasy? Pathetic."

"You're already here, little mate."

Before I can react, his fangs sink into my marking spot. White-hot agony erupts across my shoulder as my vision tunnels to black.

Pain drags me back to consciousness. 'Selene? Are you there?'

Silence.

I blink against the dim light, taking stock of my prison. Wrists shackled above my head to an iron bedframe. A scarred dresser stands sentinel across the room. My skin smells of cheap soap, my torn clothes replaced with a button-down that reeks of Victor. The implications make my stomach churn.

Testing my legs brings relief - no evidence of further violation.

The door swings open. Victor's silhouette fills the frame. "Sleep well, mate?"

"True Alphas don't need to chain their mates," I spit. "They earn loyalty."

His chuckle raises goosebumps. "Our pack lacks females, Evelyn. These warriors deserve mates. I've promised to find them - whether their future partners come willingly or not."

"Romantic."

"You'll understand soon." He perches on the mattress, fingers toying with my buttons. "The bond's pull is irresistible."

I bare my teeth. "Touch me and lose a hand."

"Let's test that theory." He yanks the collar aside - and freezes.

His roar shakes dust from the ceiling. "WHERE IS IT?"

I smirk. "Happy eighteenth birthday to me... in six months. Marks don't stick on minors, Beta." The title drips with venom. "You've abducted the wrong girl."

Victor's rage morphs into something more terrifying - calculated patience. "Then I'll simply remark you every forty-eight hours until your birthday." He traces my jawline. "Pray you come of age quickly, little mate."

The door slams shut, leaving me alone with the echo of his threat.

###Chapter 0066

I reach the clearing faster than expected.

Tobias and his team are already there, surrounded by twenty wolves scouring the area. I step out of my Porsche and approach him. "What do we know?"

"Alpha Adrian." He gestures toward a marked-off section. "Fifteen vehicles were here. The strongest scent belongs to our packmate."

Dropping to all fours, I inhale deeply. The scent is faint but unmistakable—vanilla, a whisper of lavender, and honey.

I meet his gaze. "That's her."

He nods.

"Which direction?"

Tobias points to tire tracks cutting through the grass. "They headed toward the road, then north."

My phone rings. Father's name flashes on the screen. I answer. "Yeah?"

"Son, Gregory just got another message from Evelyn."

My grip tightens. She's too far for me to sense her, yet she can mindlink her father? Her strength is staggering.

"What did she say?"

Sebastian joins me, so I put the call on speaker.

"They stopped to let her relieve herself."

Our heads snap up, eyes locking. That scent trail will make tracking her easier.

"Did she give any clues about her location?" Sebastian asks.

Father's voice crackles through. "Nothing but forest. No buildings, no water, no power lines."

"Tobias thinks they went north," I say. "Anywhere up there that fits?"

A pause. Then, "Nothing directly north, but there's a stretch of wilderness west of the Sierra Madre Mountains that matches."

"Send coordinates. We're moving."

Sebastian and I sprint back to our cars. My phone pings with the location. "Got it?"

He nods. "Got it."

"See you there."

I push the Porsche to its limit. Five hours later, I arrive at the coordinates.

Theron, you with me?

Let's find our mate.

I shift, letting Theron take over. His nose twitches, catching the faintest trace of vanilla before bolting forward. I surrender control, trusting his instincts. He alternates between sniffing the ground and the air.

An hour in, a howl echoes through the trees—Sebastian. I respond, guiding him to us.

We find the spot where Evelyn was taken from. Her scent leads to where she must have been forced back into the vehicle. We press on, following the barest hint of her until Dorian's paws thud against the earth behind us.

I bark to signal our position.

Sebastian shifts back, so I do the same.

"We should regroup," he says. "Her scent's fading. We'll lose it soon."

He's right. But the thought of her with that killer—being hurt, tortured—sends fury through me.

Why her?

Because she's a Guardian.

But it makes no sense. Guardians can't be bought or broken. Their allegiance only shifts if they find their mate—and she's not of age yet.

What the hell does he want with her?

###Chapter 0067

My eyes scan the area desperately. Not a single clue remains about where they've taken her. I turn to Sebastian, my jaw clenched. "Fine. I'll call my father. We're heading back."

The next day finds me home. Exhaustion weighs on me, but sleep won't come. I march straight to my father's office - it's transformed into a command center. Maps cover every surface, color-coded markers tracking search grids, cleared zones, and remaining hotspots.

We fought about school. I refused to go, arguing I couldn't focus. He compromised: home-schooling with delivered assignments, plus mandatory morning training sessions.

I only agreed because Mr. Sinclair had started drilling the warriors. Maybe he needed distraction from his missing daughter. Or maybe he was disappointed no one could save her.

A week passes with zero progress. I curse myself for not following that faint scent when we had the chance.

Now I'm in the training yard, channeling my rage into brutal physical exertion. Mr. Sinclair pushes us to our limits daily - exactly what I need. Between the sleepless nights and lost appetite, finding Evelyn consumes me.

"Move your pathetic asses! My daughter could outrun you blindfolded before wiping the floor with every last one of you!" Mr. Sinclair barks during morning drills.

"With respect, sir," Julian gasps, bent double with hands on knees. "She already does that."

"Every damn day," Nathaniel adds between wheezes.

"Then step up! When my girl comes home, she'll need real competition. Right now, I don't see any."

The brutal training continues until Mr. Sinclair finally dismisses us. I shower quickly before rejoining the search.



The atmosphere in my father's office crackles with tension. His gaze locks onto me the moment I enter. "What happened?"

"Sit." Father gestures to a chair while Benedict and Mr. Sinclair watch me intently. I hold his stare before complying.

"We've got a theory. Long shot, but worth pursuing." Father taps the map. "Every tracker and half our warriors are combing these sectors for Evelyn."

I nod. "What's the play?"

Benedict answers. "We suspect Victor may have taken her to the Obsidian Moon Pack."

My brow furrows. That pack was destroyed eighteen years ago when Cassian executed Lucian Blackwood and his loyalists. Survivors joined Nightshade.

"I thought that pack was wiped out?"

Mr. Sinclair's eyes burn into me. "It was. But if Victor's claiming to be Alpha now, he needs two things: a pack..."

"And a Luna," I finish. Dorian surges forward. "He'll never keep her. She's mine!"

Mr. Sinclair wheels on me. "We're getting her back. He may not realize she's still underage. That's our advantage."

###Chapter 0068

Theron is raging inside my mind. If that monster wants Evelyn as his Luna, he'll brand her against her will. A forced mating mark is the only way to create an unwilling bond.

Theron's snarl vibrates through my skull. I'm barely holding onto control. My body trembles violently as fur erupts across my skin. "Give me the pack's location. I'll check if she's there." My voice drops an octave with Theron's growl layered beneath it.

"I'm coming with you."

I whirl around to see Sebastian standing in the doorway. His assessing gaze locks onto me. "Neither of us wants her trapped in a forced bond. We find her together."

Theron protests violently at Sebastian's involvement, but Evelyn's safety overrides everything. I give a sharp nod.

By dusk, we're speeding toward the Obsidian Moon territory. It's closer than expected—they must have circled back after sending us on that wild chase.

We ditch the truck in a dense thicket and shift before continuing on foot. Sebastian knows these lands. I follow his lead through the shadows.

The sight that greets us chills my blood.

Dozens of wolves move through the crumbling ruins of what was once a thriving pack. The buildings sag with decay, but the place teems with activity. We skirt the perimeter patrols with practiced stealth.

Shifting back, we observe from the tree line. Sebastian points to a dilapidated structure swaying in the wind. "The old packhouse. That's where they'll be keeping Evelyn and Victor."

As if summoned by his words, Evelyn's scream pierces the night.

Pure agony.

I'm moving before conscious thought catches up.

Sebastian tackles me mid-lunge. "Think!" he hisses as I thrash against him. "Charge in blind and we lose any chance of getting her out alive!"

"He's torturing her!"

"Yes." Sebastian's grip tightens. "But she's a Guardian. Pain won't break her. We need strategy, not suicide. If they feel cornered, they'll kill her. For Evelyn's sake—think!"

My chest heaves. Every instinct screams to tear through the compound, but he's right.

I wrench free and stalk toward the trees. "I'm calling my father. We need reinforcements by dawn." My jaw clenches. "I won't let that monster touch her again. Neither will Theron."

"Understood." Sebastian's eyes gleam in the moonlight. "I'll maintain surveillance."

The phone call with my father lasts precisely ninety-three seconds. When I return, Sebastian hasn't moved from his vantage point. "They'll be here by first light. We're staying tonight."

He nods. "We'll rotate watch."

###Chapter 0069

My eyes flutter open to the familiar sting of metal cuffs biting into my wrists. This marks the third time I've regained consciousness, and each awakening leaves me weaker than the last.

Selene's voice echoes faintly in my mind, her message from earlier replaying. Victor has been pumping his venom into us with every marking attempt. The bastard thinks he can force the mate bond before my eighteenth birthday by sheer volume of venom. It hasn't worked yet, thanks to Selene burning it off each time - but her strength is waning too.

I take stock of my prison. Another fresh shirt clings to my sweat-drenched body. A water bottle and plate of cold food sit untouched on the bedside table. My stomach growls in protest, but dehydration makes the water more appealing than food.

My shoulders scream from being stretched above my head for what feels like an eternity. I wriggle toward the headboard, desperate to relieve the tension in my abused muscles.

Finally upright, I gasp as blood rushes back into my numb arms. The relief is short-lived - my limbs feel like lead weights. I reach for Selene mentally, but our connection flickers weakly.

The door bursts open. Victor strides in, checking his watch with clinical precision. "Right on schedule. Two days unconscious this time."

"How long do you intend to keep me chained up, Beta?" I spit the last word like poison.

His face darkens. "Alpha."

I deliberately sniff the air. "Still smell like second-rate power to me."

His lips curl in a snarl. "Since your birthday remains a mystery, I'll just keep dosing you until the venom takes. They say enough venom and a completed mating can override age restrictions."

"You're revolting."

He advances toward me, emphasizing each word. "Am I... mate?"

Victor snatches the food plate. "Eat." He holds a piece of meat to my lips.

I turn my face away. "Not hungry."

His hand clamps on my jaw, forcing me to meet his gaze. "You will eat. You've barely touched food all week!" His command slams into me with all the force of a gentle breeze.

I laugh bitterly as his weak alpha power slides off me. "I'll take nothing from you. Not food. Not your mark. Nothing forced."

His grip tightens until I see stars. "Fine! We'll do this the hard way until your body accepts what your mind won't."

Without warning, he yanks my head sideways by the hair. His fangs sink deep, pumping venom into my bloodstream. I scream as fire races through my veins. He withdraws only to strike again, milking the wounds like some grotesque serpent handler.

Selene surges forward in a desperate attempt to neutralize the poison, but darkness swallows me whole.

...

Distant sounds of battle penetrate my drug-induced haze. Screams. Crashing. The unmistakable sounds of wolves tearing each other apart. I drift in and out of awareness, unsure if it's real until the violence becomes too loud to ignore.

I try to call out, but my body won't obey. My mind feels stuffed with cotton, limbs unresponsive. Whether from venom or exhaustion, I can't tell.

A thunderous crash nearby. Snarling. The wet sounds of flesh tearing. As a Guardian, this fight should be mine - but I can't even lift my head. My eyelids might as well be cemented shut.

The battle rages on without me.

###Chapter 0070

The door slams open with a force that silences the room. Heavy breathing fills the sudden quiet.

"I'm taking her out." That voice—I recognize it, though I can't place it. Warm. Reassuring. Please let him mean me.

The restraints on my wrists snap free. A hiss of pain as silver burns skin. Then strong arms lift me, cradling me against a chest that smells like freshly baked cookies. I instinctively nuzzle closer, though my body remains limp.

"Got you, Evelyn. You're safe now."

I want to scream that we're not safe—Victor's still here—but my voice won't obey.

The scent of blood grows stronger as we move. Fighting echoes around us.

He stops abruptly. "Call my father. Tell him I have her. Sebastian's staying to handle Victor. You're in charge." Sebastian's here. That means I'm protected.

Another familiar voice asks, "How bad is she?"

A pause. "Too soon to tell."

Cold night air hits my face as we exit. The sounds of battle fade behind us. After what feels like hours, I'm lowered onto soft leather. That unmistakable new car smell.

"Hold on, love." The cookie-scented warmth leaves me, and I immediately feel adrift. But he returns quickly. "Can't stand that bastard's stench on you. Going to change your shirt. If you object, little guardian, feel free to wake up and stop me."

Buttons pop open. Cool air brushes my skin before being replaced by soft fabric saturated with that comforting cookie aroma. Like coming home. My heartbeat steadies.

He reclines the seat, buckles me in, and shuts the door.

Darkness claims me again. I drift in and out, catching murmured phone conversations. Sometimes he holds my hand, his thumb tracing circles that send warmth through my numb limbs, lulling me back to sleep.

Next awareness—antiseptic sting in my nose. He's carrying me again.

"Put her here," a new voice says.

"No. Where are you taking her?"

"This way, Alpha."

Needles prick my arms. Machines beep.

"Alpha, what happened?"

"Found her unconscious." A growl rumbles through his chest. "Neck's bruised with puncture wounds. Marking attempt failed."

"Where is she? Where's my daughter?" My father's roar is the last thing I hear before darkness swallows me whole.

Evelyn's home! Those bite marks better heal properly.

###Chapter 0071

The pain will be excruciating.

When venom gets rejected like this, it turns toxic in the bloodstream. Every inch of her body will burn as if set aflame. She’ll need complete rest once she wakes. Training is off the table until she fully recovers.

"Understood."

"As I mentioned, the bloodwork will give us more answers."

My gaze never leaves Evelyn.

"Thank you, Doctor."

Grant Sinclair echoes me. "Yes, thank you."

Silence settles over us as Dr. Whitmore exits, each of us drowning in our own thoughts.

Nurses move in and out, adjusting IV lines and monitoring her vitals. My father enters and grips my shoulder, his eyes locked on Grant. "Your daughter’s resilient, Gregory. More than any wolf I’ve ever known. More than you and Ivy. She’ll fight through this."

Grant only nods. The torment in his eyes mirrors my own as he watches his unconscious daughter.

Dad drags a chair over and joins our vigil.

Dr. Whitmore returns sooner than expected.

He acknowledges each of us with a nod. "Alpha. Alpha. Guardian." A pause. "Bad news first. The Beta’s venom has saturated her system entirely." His jaw tightens. "The good news? Her body’s rejecting it. Every blood sample confirms it."

###Chapter 0072

I inhale sharply, exhaling as if it's the first real breath I've taken in days.

"What does this mean for the future?" My voice is steady, but my heart races. I need to know if our bond still stands.

Dr. Whitmore meets my gaze. "We'll need more tests, but there are two possibilities. First, Evelyn will likely recover fully with no lasting connection to the Beta. Second, this explains why Theron can barely sense Selene—she's using all her strength to fight the venom."

Grant Sinclair steps forward. "What are you doing to help her? You promised you'd do everything."

"We are," Dr. Whitmore assures him. "IV fluids to flush the venom, liquid nutrients to rebuild her strength. She's severely dehydrated and hasn't eaten since she was taken."

Grant nods grimly. "Training protocol. Drink when safe, never eat anything that could be drugged."

"If progress continues, she could wake as early as tomorrow," the doctor adds. "Though Tuesday is more probable."

My shoulders sag in relief. She’s going to be okay. She’ll wake up. The rest—the bond, the aftermath—can wait. Time is all I need to give her.

"Thank you, Doctor," my father says.

Once we’re alone, he turns to me. "Adrian, go clean up. Eat something."

"I'm fine."

"Son." His tone cuts through me. "You're still covered in blood from the fight." I glance down, startled. I'd forgotten. "Do you really want her waking up to see you like this?"

I stand abruptly. To Grant, I say, "I'll be back soon. If she wakes—"

"You'll know immediately," he promises.

I follow my father out. After a scalding shower, I dress quickly, ready to return to the hospital.

"Adrian." My mother’s voice stops me at the kitchen doorway.

A sandwich waits on the table. "Sit. Eat. You’re no good to her exhausted." Her fingers brush my shoulder as I sit. "Ten minutes won’t change anything. Your father is checking in with Grant."

I take a bite. She doesn’t speak, just rubs my back in that quiet, steady way only mothers can. The simple kindness nearly undoes me. This is why every Alpha needs a Luna—someone to anchor them when they’re drowning in duty. My mother isn’t just a parent; she’s the heart of our pack.

When I finish, I hug her tightly, lingering longer than usual. Words aren’t needed.

Back at the hospital, Sebastian has joined Grant in Evelyn’s room. He’s cleaned up, taken my seat, and now holds her hand. My jaw clenches, but I force a nod. The growl building in my chest stays locked inside.

###Chapter 0073

My gaze locks onto Mr. Sinclair. "Any updates?"

"Nothing significant. They're hydrating her as Dr. Whitmore advised and took more blood to monitor the venom levels."

I drag another chair closer to Evelyn’s bedside, needing to be near her. My fingers brush against her leg—just enough contact to reassure myself she’s still here.

Time blurs until Sebastian rises abruptly. "I have to go. Victor’s trail won’t stay fresh forever. I just needed to see Evelyn before heading out." Good. Now I can reclaim my place beside her, my fingers entwined with hers.

He leans down, sweeping her dark hair from her face before pressing a kiss to her lips. A growl rips from my throat before I can stop it, and Theron shoves me upright.

Sebastian straightens, his eyes flashing as Dorian surges forward. "Stand down, Adrian. We had a deal."

I stalk to the foot of her bed, intercepting him. "She’s my mate. You agreed to keep your hands off her. Don’t ever let your lips touch her again." My voice is pure menace.

His irises darken, the wolf rising to the surface. "She hasn’t chosen yet. She might reject you and pick me instead. That’s her decision."

I’m a second from lunging when both of us are yanked backward. Mr. Sinclair has us by our collars, his grip ironclad. "Outside. Now." His Alpha aura slams into us like a tidal wave before he releases us.

Sebastian and I glare at each other as we stride into the hallway. Only then do I notice the waiting room packed with wolves from both packs, all waiting for news about Evelyn.

As we turn to face off again, Mr. Sinclair steps between us. "Listen up, pups." He spits the word like an insult. "If you two want to measure your dicks, do it somewhere that isn’t my daughter’s hospital room. Neither of you is proving you deserve her. A real mate puts her first—above your egos, above your titles. A worthy mate wouldn’t be too busy playing Alpha to notice she’s still unconscious beside you!" His roar echoes through the silent corridor.

His voice drops to a lethal whisper. "Until you can prove you’re worthy of my daughter, neither of you will step foot in her room again."

"You can’t do that!" I snarl. "She’s my mate!"

"Then you should’ve thought about that before starting a pissing contest at her bedside."

My chest heaves. He’s banning me from Evelyn? Out of the corner of my eye, I see Sebastian’s jaw twitch, his teeth clenched hard enough to crack bone.

"And if either of you pups,"—he drags out the word—"think you can get past me?" Evander surges forward, and Mr. Sinclair’s eyes burn molten gold. "Try me."

He waits a beat before turning on his heel and disappearing back into Evelyn’s room. My father steps up behind us, gripping both our shoulders.

"And that, young Alphas, is why Grant Sinclair was once called the Grim Reaper of Blackthorn."

###Chapter 0074

Pain consumes me. It's a relentless fire burning through every nerve. I reach for Selene, but she's locked in her own brutal fight. I sense her struggle yet can't bridge the distance between us. We'll have to battle this poison from opposite ends and fight our way toward each other.

My body won't obey me. Eyes sealed shut, limbs heavy as lead. Only my other senses remain.

Then it comes - the rich aroma of chocolate chip cookies. The scent works like magic, loosening the tension in my muscles. Someone's holding my hand. The right one. The pain there is fading, replaced by comforting warmth. I cling to that sensation like a lifeline. The only part of me not screaming in agony.

Voices drift in and out. One sounds like Dad's, but the words won't form clearly.

When awareness returns, the comforting hand is gone. The cookie scent has faded to a whisper. My body feels like it's been shrink-wrapped in barbed wire. I focus on chasing that fading chocolate smell, desperate for its calming effect.

A door opens. Fresh air carries the cookie scent back in full force. My mental sigh of relief is almost physical. The aroma soothes my frayed nerves like a balm.

A chair scrapes against the floor. Suddenly, the white-hot pain in my leg dulls. That same warm hand now rests on my thigh. The relief is instant. My mind floats free, surrendering to peaceful darkness.

Snarling jolts me awake. The cookie scent remains strong, but the pain in my leg has returned - less intense now, though I'd prefer it gone completely.

The growling fades into the distance, replaced by muffled shouting. Frustration burns - I want to open my eyes, to tell them I'm here, that I'll be okay. The whir of wheelchair wheels announces Dad's arrival. Softer footsteps follow, along with hushed voices, before unconsciousness drags me under again.

Time means nothing. When I next surface, the pain has dulled to a manageable ache. I force my eyelids open - and immediately slam them shut against the blinding hospital lights. A soft groan escapes as the brightness stabs through my skull.

"Evelyn? Sweetheart, can you hear me? Someone get Dr. Whitmore!" Dad's voice cracks with emotion. I try opening my eyes again, but the light burns like acid.

"Kill the overheads. Hang on, Evelyn, we'll fix the lighting."

The switch clicks. Even through closed lids, I see the difference. This time when I open my eyes, the adjusted light still stings but doesn't blind.

"Dad." My voice sounds like gravel. My tongue sticks to the roof of my mouth, throat drier than desert sand.

"Here, darling." A straw touches my lips. I gulp greedily, then choke as the water hits my parched throat. Coughing violently, I collapse back, exhausted from the simple act of drinking.

"Try again, Evelyn. They're hydrating you intravenously, but you need to drink too. It'll help Selene fight the venom." That gets through the fog. I open my mouth obediently. This time the water goes down smoothly, and I drain the glass.

"I'll fetch more." That's Genevieve's voice. Blinking, I confirm it's her taking the empty glass from Dad's hands.

"Evelyn." Dad's voice brings my focus back. "How are you feeling, sweetheart?"

"Like I got hit by a truck." My weak smile probably looks more like a grimace.

"How long was I out?" Time had become meaningless. For all I knew, minutes or months could have passed.

"Adrian found you about thirty-six hours ago. You've been unconscious here in the pack medical center since." So Adrian was my rescuer. I wonder if he's the source of that comforting cookie scent.

The door opens again. Nathaniel enters first, followed by Dr. Whitmore, with Genevieve bringing up the rear - a fresh water glass in one hand, pitcher in the other.

###Chapter 0075

Dr. Whitmore approached my bedside. His penlight flashed across my vision as he studied the monitors. "Evelyn, I'm Dr. Whitmore. Rate your pain level for me."

"Like I got hit by a truck." My voice came out raspy.

He made a note on his chart. "Describe the sensation. Throbbing? Stabbing? Constant ache?"

"Burning mostly. Some deep aches. No sharp pains though."

"Your father may have mentioned this already, but let me explain your condition." He adjusted his glasses. "Your kidnapper's venom overloaded your system. Both your body and Selene are treating it like a foreign toxin. Right now Selene's focusing all her energy on containment, so don't panic if the bond feels muted."

I swallowed with difficulty. "I sense her presence, but the connection's faint."

"That's actually promising. Your recovery exceeds my projections." A hint of admiration colored his tone. "Then again, I should've anticipated this from a Guardian."

"The discomfort should gradually subside. For now, I need you drinking fluids between IV sessions. Rest is crucial - when you wake next, attempt solid food. Think you can manage?"

I nodded, eyelids already growing heavy. Darkness claimed me as my father's voice promised he wouldn't leave.

Moonlight streamed through the window when consciousness returned. Strength had seeped back into my limbs. Genevieve dozed in one chair while Nathaniel snored in another. My father's absence brought a smirk - he'd be furious about missing my awakening after his vow.

A rustle alerted Nathaniel. He bolted upright. "Evelyn." His whisper carried across the quiet room.

He hovered by my side. "I'll fetch the doc and mindlink your father. He'll skin me alive for this - just convinced him to shower and eat after twelve hours."

"What's the time?" My throat felt like sandpaper.

"Nearly 2 AM." He pressed a straw to my lips. I drained the entire glass. The movement stirred Genevieve.

"Look who's back with us!" She sprang up as Nathaniel disappeared for the doctor.

"Better?" She refilled my water.

"Not perfect, but improved." This time I took the glass myself, fingers steadier than before.

Nathaniel returned with Dr. Whitmore. "Evening, doc."

"Good, you're awake." He grinned. "How's my star patient?"

I arched a brow. "Am I your only shifter case?"

"Practically. Werewolves make terrible hospital guests - too restless with our accelerated healing." He began his examination just as my father burst in.

"Knew I shouldn't have gone." His wheelchair squeaked across the floor.

"You needed the break." I studied his face. The worry lines had deepened.

His gaze swept over me. "Your color's better. Status report?"

"Stronger. Still can't hear Selene clearly, but her energy feels less strained."

"Excellent news, sweetheart."

A nurse wheeled in a food tray, positioning it across my lap.

Dr. Whitmore eyed the unappetizing spread. "I know hospital food isn't thrilling, but try."

I poked at the bland mush. "I'll choke it down if it means discharge papers."

"After eating, everyone clears out. No marathon chats." His stern look included Nathaniel and Genevieve.

They nodded in unison as the medical team exited.

I forced down what I could stomach. Genevieve and Nathaniel filled me in on pack gossip, but exhaustion soon dragged me under again.

###Chapter 0076

Being thrown out of Evelyn's hospital room by Gregory Sinclair made my blood boil. I'd made vows to her. She might have been unconscious, but that didn't make my promises any less real.

I stormed back to Blackthorn Packhouse, pacing my room like a caged animal. How the hell was I supposed to get back to her? Before I could plot my next move, my father's voice cut through my thoughts via the pack link. "My office. Now."

I didn't bother knocking.

"You saw what he did," I snapped the second the door shut behind me.

Alistair Grey leaned back in his chair, studying me with that infuriating calm. "As an Alpha, I understand his reaction. You and Sebastian were out of line. But that’s not your biggest problem right now."

I froze. "What are you talking about?"

His gaze sharpened. "You really don’t remember, do you? What you declared in front of half the pack at that hospital?"

My mind raced. I'd said a lot of things. Too many things.

His brow arched. "Let me refresh your memory. You announced—quite publicly—that Evelyn Sinclair is your fated mate. By now, every wolf in both territories knows. Except, of course, Evelyn herself."

My stomach dropped. Shit. This wasn’t how it was supposed to happen. I wanted her to choose me before the bond took hold. To want me for who I was, not because of some cosmic pull. Now? The truth would hit her like a freight train.

I gripped the edge of his desk. "Tell me there’s a way to fix this."

A slow smile spread across his face. "You’re the future Alpha of Blackthorn. Issue a command. No one in our pack breathes a word to her until she figures it out herself."

An Alpha command. Of course. It would bind every member of Blackthorn to silence—physically incapable of disobeying.

"Should it come from you or me?" he challenged.

The question caught me off guard. Technically, the pack wasn’t mine yet. But my bloodline didn’t lie—my authority would hold the same weight as his.

"From me." I straightened. "Walk me through it."

Pride flashed in his eyes as he explained: Specific wording. Absolute clarity. The mental reach to every pack member at once.

When I was ready, I opened the pack link.

"Attention, Blackthorn Pack." My voice echoed through the collective consciousness. "This is Adrian Grey. What was overheard at the hospital stays within these borders. No one speaks of Evelyn Sinclair being my mate—not to her, not to outsiders. This is your Alpha’s command."

The power surged through the link like a shockwave. My father gave a single nod. It had worked.

Training grounds were my next stop. I found Genevieve and Nathaniel immediately.

"You’re both on Evelyn duty," I said. "Rotate shifts at the hospital. Skip school, work, whatever—I want hourly updates. Everything. Changes in her condition, who visits, if she so much as twitches."

Genevieve blinked. "You mean... 24/7 updates?"

"Problem?"

They exchanged a glance. "No, Alpha."

"Good. Move out. First report in sixty minutes." As they turned, I added, "I’ll handle your parents."

A quick mental reach to their families smoothed any objections. Their parents’ responses were unanimous: "Whatever you need, Alpha."

###Chapter 0077

True to their promise, Genevieve and Nathaniel sent me hourly updates.

Several hours later, the first piece of good news arrived. Evelyn had woken briefly, and Dr. Whitmore was astonished by her rapid recovery. A grin spread across my face as I made my way to the pack house dining hall for dinner.

I found Donovan and shared the update. "That's fantastic, Adrian! I'm thrilled for you." We took our seats, and before I could settle in, the overpowering scent of rosewater hit me. Donovan wrinkled his nose just as Bianca slid into the chair beside me.

She sat silently, staring at her folded hands.

"Bianca." I acknowledged her.

"Is it true, Alpha?" Her voice trembled as she lifted her gaze.

"Is what true?" I already knew she was asking about Evelyn being my mate, but I had explicitly forbidden this topic from being discussed. Theron snarled in my mind, ready to put this she-wolf in her place.

I watched her struggle against my command, her words tangled. "About... Evelyn?" she finally managed.

"Yes."

Tears welled in her eyes. "But what about me?"

I was genuinely confused. There had never been anything between us beyond physical intimacy. "What about you?"

"I thought you cared for me."

"Of course I care about you, Bianca." Her face brightened momentarily, but I had to be clear. "You're a valued member of this pack, and I care for all my pack members."

Her expression shattered. "I thought we had something special," she whispered.

"Bianca, you're a good woman who'll find her true mate one day. When you do, you'll understand—there will never be anyone for me but Evelyn." I kept my tone gentle but firm.

She sniffled. "If you ever change your mind—"

"I won't." I cut her off.

With a nod, she left.

Donovan watched her go, thoughtful. "You realize there will be others like her. They'll assume sleeping with you meant you wanted them as Luna."

"They'd be wrong. I never made promises to any of them. My mate was always destined to be Luna. Now that I've found Evelyn, I won't let her go."

After dinner, I retreated to my room, hoping to rest before the next update. Around 2 AM, Nathaniel's mind link came through—Evelyn was awake again, eating, and regaining strength, though Dr. Whitmore insisted she rest more. Relieved, I fell back asleep.

Morning brought more updates: Evelyn was stable, still sleeping. With my father leading training, I joined in. It wasn't as brutal as Gregory Sinclair's sessions, but I pushed myself, channeling the intensity of Evelyn's sparring lessons. One by one, I took down my warriors, earning grumbles—they'd hoped for a break without a Guardian present.

On my way to breakfast, Genevieve linked me. Evelyn was awake, stronger, and had spoken briefly with Selene. The failed mate marks were gone. Selene remained weak, fighting the venom, but both were recovering.

Nathaniel informed me Gregory was coming to the pack house for Evelyn's meal. I intercepted the kitchen's lead omega, requesting two to-go boxes. I filled them with protein, carbs, and something sweet—Evelyn had a notorious sweet tooth.

When Gregory arrived, I approached. His lips thinned, but I ignored it. "Sir, I heard you were here for Evelyn's food. I took the liberty of packing two breakfasts to save you time."

I placed the boxes in his lap and fetched a carafe of coffee. "Here you go, sir."

As I turned to leave, he spoke. "Thank you, Alpha."

"Please, call me Adrian." He nodded and wheeled away, returning to my girl.

###Chapter 0078

My eyes flutter open, and the first thing I notice is the surge of strength coursing through me. For a brief moment, Selene pushes forward, her presence warm and reassuring.

"The venom is weakening," she tells me. "It'll take another week for me to fully recover, but Victor's mark is gone. The bruises will fade slower—I prioritized healing the internal damage first."

The hospital room comes into focus. Genevieve, Nathaniel, and my father are all there. Dad's head snaps toward me the second he senses I'm awake.

"Sweetheart," he breathes, relief flooding his voice. "You're awake. How do you feel?"

"Better," I rasp, fingers instinctively brushing my neck. "Selene says she's fighting the venom, and Victor's mark is gone. Is that true?"

I tug the hospital gown aside. Their reactions are immediate—Genevieve practically leaps from her chair, gripping my shoulders as she examines my skin.

"Oh my gods!" she gasps. "Your wolf is incredible! Every single mark is gone!"

I blink. "Wait—all of them? How many were there?"

An uneasy silence settles over them. It's Dad who finally answers.

"Evelyn," he says carefully, "there were multiple puncture wounds on both sides of your neck. It looks like he was trying to flood your system with venom—to force your body into submission so he could solidify the bond."

I shouldn't be surprised, but the cruelty still stings. "Guess I owe Selene a thank-you."

I ask for updates—how they found me, what happened while I was unconscious. They tell me everything, including how Adrian and Sebastian played crucial roles in my rescue.

Fifty...

Dad leaves to grab real food from the packhouse, and I seize the moment to voice the question gnawing at me.

"I get that Adrian and Sebastian helped, but... neither of them has come by?"

Genevieve and Nathaniel exchange a look.

"What?" I press.

Nathaniel clears his throat. "Well... your dad might have gone full Guardian on them."

Genevieve nods. "Yeah. There was some kind of... standoff in your room. Your dad kicked them out and banned them from returning."



Nathaniel adds, voice tinged with awe, "He said if they wanted to see you, they'd have to go through him first."

I'm speechless. First, whatever tension exists between Adrian and Sebastian seems as volatile as the day Sebastian brought that bear to school. Second, my dad just asserted dominance over two Alphas.

"Alpha Alistair didn't intervene?"

"Nope," Genevieve says. "He just grinned and said it was good to see his old Guardian back in action. Did you know your dad's been training warriors?"

"What? What else did I miss?"

Genevieve groans. "You mean besides the fact that your father is trying to kill us with his insane training regimen? I've never been this sore in my life."

I'm laughing when Dad returns with Dr. Whitmore.

"That's a good sign," the doctor remarks, smiling.

"Hey, Doc," I say. "So? When can I get out of here?"

He checks my vitals, flipping through the nurse's notes before meeting my gaze. "You and Selene are something else. Your recovery rate is astounding. At this pace, I’d say you can leave tonight."

Relief crashes over me. I don’t want another second in this sterile bed. I need fresh air, my own room, my own space to heal properly.

"What do I need to do?" I ask, already sitting up straighter.

###Chapter 0079

"I need another blood sample, and you need to eat a full meal."

"Fine. What exactly are you testing for?"

"We're monitoring how Selene is progressing with eliminating the venom."

"She told me it's working. The marks have disappeared."

Genevieve cuts in. "Look at her neck, doctor. The bruises are still there, but the puncture wounds are completely gone."

Dr. Whitmore examines both sides of my neck, his expression shifting to satisfaction. "Good. Let me run these tests. Eat the food your father brought, and I'll process your discharge."

I'm starving. The meal Dad brought is a thousand times better than last night's bland hospital food. By the time I finish, I feel stronger. When Dr. Whitmore returns, I'm ready to leave.

"Alright," he tells Dad and me. "You're cleared to go, but I need you back tomorrow for more tests. Possibly Thursday too, depending on tomorrow's results."

Genevieve stays to help me change while Dad retrieves the car and Nathaniel heads to afternoon training. I eye her. "Won't you get in trouble for skipping?"

A mischievous grin spreads across her face. "Nope. When your dad barred Alpha Adrian from your room, he gave us permission to miss training as long as we stayed with you and provided hourly updates."

I freeze mid-motion, my shirt tangled around my arms and head. "Wait. Alpha Adrian authorized you to skip training... for me?"

Genevieve yanks my shirt down, freeing me. "Yep. As long as we kept him updated every hour—which we did, even overnight."

I stare. "So he meant it. That claim wasn't just talk?"

"Yeah, he's your—" She cuts herself off, frowning. Her mouth opens and closes like a fish before she huffs. "Yes, he meant it. He's dead serious, Evelyn. You should know that before you see him again."

"Good to know. And I won't be seeing him until Dad lifts the ban, right?"

"That's what I heard. I wasn't here when it happened, but Nathaniel was, and his intel is solid. Others confirmed it too, so... yeah."

I finish dressing and follow Genevieve out, where a nurse waits with a wheelchair. "Seriously?" I groan.

"Hospital policy," the nurse says apologetically. I sigh and sit.

As we exit the room, warriors from both Blackthorn and Nightshade packs line the hallway, cheering. My breath catches. I had no idea this many people were here, waiting for me.

Just before the automatic doors, I ask the nurse to turn me around. "Thank you, all of you. Your support means everything. I'll be back on my feet in no time."

A roar of applause follows as the nurse wheels me out to Dad's van. As we drive away, I spot Adrian near the packhouse, watching. Our eyes lock. I raise a hand in a small wave. He smiles and lifts his in return.

I turn to Dad. "How long before you lift the ban on Sebastian and Adrian?"

###Chapter 0080

My father shoots me a sideways glance. "If it were my decision, I'd extend your recovery period. But you're back on your feet now, so it's your call."

I smile at him as we pull into the driveway. He turns to face me fully. "And...you might forgive them faster than I would."

"Why do you say that?"

"Sebastian left you a gift on Sunday when he visited. I suppose it's the finished version of what Dorian gave Selene."

I frown as we step inside. "What are you talking about, Dad?"

He wheels over to the largest gift bag I've ever seen.

"What is it?"

"Open it and see for yourself," he says.

I do—and there it is. The bear. Or rather, the bearskin rug that needed processing. It's thick, impossibly soft, and will look perfect against the hardwood floors of my bedroom. "Whoa." I stare at my father. "This is incredible!"

"I'm taking it upstairs. Then I'm calling him to thank him." I haul the rug up to my room and spread it across the floor. Stepping onto it barefoot, I close my eyes and let the fur brush against my skin. Even Selene purrs in my mind. Nice, right? I ask her.

I can't wait to shift and roll around on it, she replies. The mental image makes me grimace. Ew.

She snickers before settling down in my thoughts.

I call Sebastian, but it goes to voicemail. I leave a message telling him I've been discharged and that the bearskin is now a rug in my room—and that Selene is already fantasizing about rolling on it. Maybe Dorian will appreciate that detail.

I study my phone. Every pack member has both Alphas' numbers. The clock reads past 6 PM. Adrian should be done with warrior training by now. I take a chance and text him.

Me: Hey, Alpha Adrian. Heard I owe you a massive thank-you for saving me.

Adrian: Evelyn. I was surprised to see you leaving the hospital. How are you feeling?

Me: Much better, thanks—partly because of you.

Adrian: What kind of Alpha would I be if I left you with that murderer?

Me: Why do I feel like there's more to that story than I know?

Adrian: Maybe a conversation for another time.

Adrian: Focus on getting strong. I hear you keep wiping the floor with my warriors. Think it's time we sparred.

Me: Alpha Adrian, are you sure you want your pack watching me hand you your ass?

Adrian: It'll take more than a little Guardian to bring me down.

Me: Challenge accepted. But if you want a fair fight, give me a few more days. Selene's still healing.

Adrian: I'll wait. In the meantime, your father's training us in the mornings. We’ll both be stronger by the time we face off.

Me: Don’t say I didn’t warn you when you’re crying like a pup in front of your pack.

Adrian: Rest well, Little Guardian. Hope to see you soon.

Me: Thanks again, Alpha. For everything—including all those gifts before.

Adrian: Call me Adrian. Anytime.

I set my phone down. My chest feels lighter.

###Chapter 0082

The moment Mr. Sinclair leaves, I snag breakfast and bolt upstairs to prep for school. A whole week missed means I’m drowning in make-up work. But that sparks an idea.

At school, I march straight to the office. Being Alpha at an all-werewolf academy has perks—I can get whatever I want without much fuss. I rarely flex my status, but today’s an exception.

"Mrs. Hawthorne." I nod at the elderly she-wolf who might be the oldest living werewolf I’ve ever seen. My dad claims she worked here when he was a student. "I’m here for Evelyn Sinclair. She missed last week. Need her assignments so she can catch up while recovering."

"Certainly, Alpha." Her fingers fly over the keyboard, pulling up Evelyn’s schedule. "I’ll gather everything from her teachers by dismissal. Swing by before you leave, and I’ll have it ready."

I flash her a grateful smile and head to class.

The entire day drag, my mind stuck on the chance of seeing Evelyn later. Mr. Sinclair banned me from visiting until he gives the green light, but he can’t argue against delivering her homework. At least, that’s my gamble.

After school, as Donovan and I near the pack house, Genevieve’s mind link hits me—Evelyn’s being discharged tonight. Great news, but it means no visit. She’ll need rest, probably crash early.

Then it clicks. I can see her today—just not talk. I grab Donovan before he vanishes.

"Start training without me. Evelyn’s getting out. I need to see her."

"Go ahead. We’ll be in the ring when you’re done."

I sprint upstairs, dump my stuff, and change in record time. Nathaniel’s mind link pings—he’s heading to training since Evelyn’s release is happening.

Outside, I plant myself where their van will pass. Sunlight at my back, I’m impossible to miss.

The van rolls into view. Through the windshield, Evelyn’s gaze locks onto mine. She waves, and suddenly, the world tilts back into place. The weight crushing me for days evaporates. I wave back, grinning like an idiot.

Once they pass, I jog to training, lighter than I’ve felt in weeks.

Dinner’s a solo affair in my room. Piles of missed schoolwork demand attention if I want any shot at seeing Evelyn this weekend. I’ll take just sitting beside her while she studies—closeness is enough.

Midway through brutal calculus, my phone buzzes. Any distraction is a gift.

My pulse spikes when I see Evelyn’s name. She’s texting me first—even if it’s just a thank-you for rescuing her. I ask about her surprise early discharge and how she’s feeling.

Of course she picks up on the unspoken—there’s more about Victor. But I won’t ruin our first chat with that. Instead, I flirt, challenging her to spar. It’s also my sneaky way of saying I’m watching over my Little Guardian.

Her sassy reply about kicking my ass? Thrilling. Oh, Evelyn, you’ve no idea how badly I want that. But only when she’s healed—our first match needs to be fair so I can witness her full brilliance.

As much as I crave talking all night, she needs rest. I sign off with a heart emoji—my tiny love confession. The mate bond’s still dormant for her, but Theron and I? All in.

###Chapter 0083

The scent of jasmine hits me the moment I step onto the Sinclair property for morning training. Stronger than yesterday. Theron rumbles in approval inside me - our girl is close, and she's safe.

Grant Sinclair runs us through brutal drills like a Marine Corps instructor. "Move those pansy asses!" he barks, making warriors twice his size flinch. I bite back a grin imagining Evelyn calling him out for his language. My fierce little guardian would never complain about training, though.

For the first hour, I help Blackthorn warriors through obstacle courses. Then comes my favorite part - Evelyn's signature takedown sequence. One by one, I drop every warrior in the yard. Improvement shows in my fluid movements. Soon, I'll be ready to spar with her properly.

As Grant debriefs the group, prickling awareness crawls up my spine. There. Second-floor window. Evelyn's golden eyes lock onto me before she ducks behind the curtain. Too late - I caught her watching. My lips curl as I wink at the glass. Let her see me using her techniques. Our warriors never stood a chance.

School drags like molasses. All I can think about is finally seeing her after classes. Her textbooks and assignments wait in my trunk, carefully organized. I drop Donovan home before heading straight to the Sinclair residence.

Knocking brings no answer.

Silence.

My pulse spikes. I reach out with enhanced hearing - no heartbeats, no rustling clothes. Empty.

Theron snarls as panic claws up my throat. Did Victor Blackwood somehow breach our borders? Did her recovery take a turn?

"Father," I mind-link, voice tight. "The Sinclairs aren't home."

Alistair Grey's calm washes over me. "Bloodwork at Whitmore's clinic. Grant mentioned IV fluids and vitamins while waiting for results. They left two hours ago."

Relief unknots my shoulders. Safe. She's safe. "Update me when you hear?"

"Of course. Grant says she's stronger every day."

I leave her materials on the porch swing where she'll find them. The notebook in my glove compartment holds a fresh page. My pen hovers.

Dearest Evelyn,

Planned to see your beautiful face today. Instead, I'll imagine you rolling your eyes at this note.

Brought your schoolwork - not because I think you're bored (you are), but because I know how much your education matters. Even recovering, you'd never fall behind.

Miss your sharp tongue more than your smile. And that's saying something.

Yours,
Adrian

P.S. Theron says Selene owes him a rematch.

The paper smells faintly of my cologne when I tuck it between her textbooks. Let her wonder if that was intentional.

###Chapter 0084

Sleep came easily that Tuesday night. My own bed felt like heaven after so long away.

Morning light brought the sounds of combat training drifting through my window. I curled into the window seat, watching the scene below. Adrian had mentioned Father was overseeing warrior drills, but I hadn't expected them to be using our private training grounds.

My gaze locked onto Adrian immediately. The man moved like liquid steel - powerful yet graceful. He moved among his warriors like a force of nature, correcting stances and pushing them past their limits. I'd never trained alongside him before. The commanding presence he wielded surprised me.

Father was brutal. His insults rained down like hailstones, calling them "kittens" and "weaklings" as he put them through hellish obstacle courses. Adrian never flinched, taking every challenge without complaint.

When sparring began, I studied Adrian's technique hungrily. Our styles differed naturally - he relied on raw power and reach while I favored agility and stamina. Yet watching him dismantle his warriors with terrifying efficiency proved endurance wasn't his weakness either.

Sebastian gave him the toughest fight, but Adrian still emerged victorious.

Selene's sudden purr vibrated through my mind.

"Really? This is how you're spending your recovery time? Staring at our Alpha like some lovestruck pup?"

I smirked. "Call it tactical reconnaissance. We'll be sparring soon enough."

"Mmm, perhaps we should request private lessons. I'm certain watching him up close would speed my recovery."

"Selene!" I hissed aloud. "You're embarrassing us. And no, we're not using training as an excuse to drool over him."

"You're no fun," she sulked, though her purring continued as we kept watching.

I'd lost track of time when the session ended. Adrian lingered, receiving Father's critiques for each warrior. Just before leaving, his head snapped up. Those piercing eyes found mine through the window. A slow, knowing smile curled his lips before he winked and strode away.

Downstairs, I was fixing breakfast when Father wheeled in. "Sweetheart, you should be resting."

"I'm healing, not helpless," I said, flipping pancakes. "Don't worry, I'll take it easy today."

He chuckled. "Catch any of the training?"

"Enough to pity your victims. What did they do to deserve that?"

Father's grin turned wicked. "Oh, this was just the warm-up." He rubbed his hands together like a cartoon villain.

"Those poor souls," I sang in my best Disney villain voice, making him laugh as he left to shower.

The pack hospital visit came at 3pm. Dr. Whitmore wanted both bloodwork and an IV for hydration. Once the needle was in, I seized my chance.

"Father, what aren't you telling me about Victor Blackwood?"

His expression shuttered. "What makes you think—"

"Don't play dumb. Something's off. Tell me."

He exhaled heavily. "This should come from Sebastian... but you deserve the truth." His gaze turned grave. "When you were taken and we realized Victor was responsible, Sebastian revealed something shocking about him."

###Chapter 0085

"What kind of information?"

Dad's gaze locked onto mine, unflinching. "Victor is the one who murdered Isolde."

My hand shot up to cover my gasp. "What? How does Sebastian know that? And how is Victor still alive?"

"Apparently, Victor was discovered holding Isolde's lifeless body, drenched in her blood. He fled before anyone could stop him. He's always been good at disappearing—just like when he escaped our warriors and Sebastian after they found you."

He hesitated before continuing. "Sebastian has spent most of his life hunting Victor. Now that he's close, I fear this obsession will consume him. Alistair has been speaking with him daily, ensuring he doesn't lose himself in this pursuit. He might need a friend, Evelyn."

"Of course. Sebastian is a good friend and a strong Alpha. I'll do whatever I can to help him."

Dad nodded just as Dr. Whitmore entered. The news was positive—the venom levels in my system were decreasing, Selene was regaining strength, and I would recover fully without lasting effects from the Beta's attack.

When we arrived home, a stack of books waited on the porch. My school materials, accompanied by a note. My breath caught. Could this be from Adrian? He was the one who had been leaving me secret admirer notes.

A smile tugged at my lips as I read. I outright laughed at his playful jab about not wanting me to get bored. The cheeky smiley face confirmed he was referencing me watching him train this morning.

My pulse fluttered when he wrote that he missed my smile and sharp tongue. Then he signed it—Yours, Adrian. Was that deliberate? It had to be. He'd made no secret of his claim on Selene and me. He wanted me, and though I wasn't entirely sure what that entailed, he kept surprising me. Not only had he always known who I was, but his respect for me and my family warmed me in ways I hadn't expected. He valued everything my parents had done for him.

An idea sparked as I carried the books inside. I mentally outlined my plan before scanning the mountain of assignments waiting for me. Ugh. This weekend would be nothing but studying.

I climbed into bed early. Just as I reached for the lamp, my eyes landed on the withered flowers from Adrian on my desk. The ones that started everything. Dead now, yet I couldn’t bring myself to discard them.

I slipped out of bed and padded downstairs, rummaging through the kitchen junk drawer until I found cardstock. Back in my room, I penned my response.

Sleep brought the nightmare again. Trapped. Handcuffed. Victor advancing with elongated canines, ready to mark me. Then—Theron lunged, tearing into him before ripping his head clean off. The massive wolf leaped onto the bed, pinning me beneath him in protection.

My alarm blared, and I woke tangled in sweat-damp sheets. I must have thrashed all night.

I hurried to the window, craving another glimpse of Adrian. Would he look for me? Did he truly miss me like he’d said?

He didn’t disappoint. The moment he arrived, his eyes lifted to my window. When he spotted me, that slow, knowing smile curved his lips, followed by a nod. I returned the smile, watching as he moved through drills with lethal precision. A natural leader. A born warrior.

After training, he lingered while the others left. His gaze never wavered from mine as he pointed at me, then pressed a fist over his heart. The message was unmistakable.

You have my heart.

He walked backward, maintaining eye contact, his fist still pressed to his chest until the tree line swallowed him. One last pause. Then he vanished into the forest.

I rushed to get ready for school. Dad had wanted me to take the week off, but sitting around wasn’t an option. I needed normalcy. Routine.

Predictably, Dad argued, but he’d always taught me to push through weakness. After extracting a promise that I’d call if I felt unwell, he relented. I grabbed my bag and headed out, determined to reclaim my life.

###Chapter 0086

I stop by the front office to check in. They're already briefed about my return and welcome me back with warm smiles. A late pass gets scribbled for my first class since I'm running behind.

By mid-morning, I spot Adrian surrounded by his usual fan club. That familiar pang of jealousy tries to surface, but Selene shuts it down fast. 'Remember how he publicly claimed you? Powerful Alphas naturally attract attention. Watch closely – he's barely tolerating them.'

She's right. His bored expression says it all as he politely endures their chatter. Just as I gather the courage to approach, his head snaps up. Our eyes lock.

He cuts through the crowd like a hot knife through butter.

"Evelyn." His hands roam my arms, scanning me head to toe. "You should be resting. Why aren't you home?"

The concern in his voice makes me smile. "Because I'd go crazy staring at walls all day. Besides, I feel stronger every hour."

His shoulders relax slightly. "You're full of surprises, Little Guardian."

I hand him the cream-colored envelope I'd prepared last night. His brow furrows as he examines it. "What's this?"

'Just say it,' Selene urges.

My fingers twist together. "You mentioned never getting to have dinner with our fathers... So I arranged something. Tonight. If you—"

"Yes." The word bursts out before I finish. His sudden grin could power the city. Then doubt clouds his features. "Will your father actually let me through the door?"

I arch an eyebrow. "Scared of my dad, Alpha?"

"Terrified," he admits without shame. "That man could bench press a truck."

"Good thing you've got a Guardian then." I tap my chest. "I'll protect you."

The playful glint in his eyes shifts into something darker, hungrier. "Best perk of being mated."

Heat floods my cheeks. "I should—" My thumb jerks toward class, but his gaze pins me in place.

His fingertips trace my jawline, tucking a loose strand behind my ear. When he speaks, his voice drops to that velvet growl that makes my knees weak. "Let me walk you."

My tongue darts out to wet suddenly dry lips. Big mistake. His pupils blow wide as he leans in, breath hot against my ear. "Unless you want me to devour you in front of the entire student body, stop doing that."

He pulls back just enough to drag his nose along my cheekbone. The smirk he flashes tells me he knows exactly what he's doing to me.

My backpack changes shoulders as he takes charge. "Come on, trouble. Wouldn't want you late." His palm settles possessively on the small of my back as we move.

Selene's laughter echoes in my mind. I'm just as gone for him as she is.

###Chapter 0087

Then nothing.
Dawn broke with electric energy coursing through my veins. Today was the day I'd see Evelyn again. My pulse quickened at the thought - these stolen morning moments were all we'd have until evening.

Her silhouette appeared in the window before I even reached the Sinclair residence. She'd been waiting. A grin split my face as I tipped my chin upward in greeting. Suddenly every muscle in my body burned to impress her. Let her see the warrior I could be for her.

Training became a performance. Each movement sharper, each strike more precise with my mate's gaze upon me. When the session ended, I lingered while others dispersed.

"Time to go, Alpha," Grant Sinclair murmured.

I pointed upward without breaking eye contact with Evelyn, pressing a fist to my chest. This gesture needed no translation - my heart belonged to her completely.

Retreating toward the treeline, I maintained our connection until distance forced me to turn. The temptation to abandon all responsibilities and remain with her nearly overwhelmed me.

Back at the pack house, breakfast tasted like ashes without her. My mind whirred with schemes to cross her path before dinner.

Between classes, Donovan and I found ourselves surrounded by the usual flock of females. Their chatter faded into white noise as I plotted ways to reach Evelyn. Then it hit me - that intoxicating blend of vanilla, honey, and lavender.

My head snapped up. There she stood, radiant amidst the hallway chaos. Disbelief paralyzed me for a heartbeat before I shoved through the crowd.

My eyes raked over her frame, searching for any lingering signs of injury. The healed skin where puncture wounds once marred her neck sent relief flooding through both Theron and me.

Her musical laughter at my rapid-fire questions melted my tension. The universe had answered my unspoken wish - delivering her directly into my path.

The dinner invitation required exactly one syllable: "Yes." Her teasing about my wariness toward her father drew a chuckle, but we both knew Gregory Sinclair's threats weren't idle.

When she claimed I was fortunate to have her as my Guardian, all humor vanished from my response. The truth of that statement resonated in my bones.

Then she licked her lips.

Every coherent thought evaporated. Suddenly all I could imagine was the taste of her mouth, the feel of her body pressed against mine. Leaning close, I inhaled deeply, issuing a hushed warning about the consequences of that innocent gesture.

The dazed look in her eyes as I pulled away told me my message had been received.

Escorting her to class tested every ounce of my self-control. The urge to claim her lips nearly overrode common sense.

I made certain our paths crossed between every period. By the second encounter, she was scanning the halls for me, her smile blooming when I appeared.

"You know escort service isn't required between classes," she teased as I took her bag.

"What if I enjoy playing the doting mate?" I countered. Carrying her books was just the beginning - I intended to worship every aspect of her existence.

Lunch found me abandoning my usual seat to join her table. Nathaniel and Genevieve exchanged glances but held their tongues. Donovan followed my lead, leaving our usual companions visibly seething.

Their displeasure meant nothing. My world had realigned the moment I found my other half. Conversation flowed effortlessly, each moment in her presence more precious than the last.

###Chapter 0088

Donovan flashes Genevieve his most charming smile. "So, Genevieve, got anything exciting planned for tomorrow night?"

She barely glances up from her phone. "Same as always. Silver Fang."

His grin widens. "Need some company?"

Genevieve offers him a practiced, polite smile that doesn't reach her eyes. "Already covered, but thanks."

Her responses are clipped, borderline dismissive. I watch Donovan's interest spike—nothing fuels his pursuit like a challenge. Genevieve doesn't realize she's just made herself irresistible.

I turn my attention back to Evelyn. "Need a ride home?"

She shakes her head, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "I'm good, but I appreciate it."

The rest of the day follows the same rhythm. I carry her books between classes, my fingers brushing hers whenever I can. When the final bell rings, I walk her to her car, my pulse thrumming.

She unlocks the door but pauses, turning to face me. I step into her space, close enough to feel the warmth radiating from her skin. The parking lot is too public for what I really want, so I cage her against the car, my lips grazing her ear. "Thanks for the invite. Counting the minutes until tonight, little guardian."

My breath ghosts over her neck as I nip her earlobe. Her heartbeat kicks up, loud enough for me to hear. She swallows hard, voice shaky. "It's just dinner. Don't get too excited."

I press my forehead to hers. "Every second with you is a gift." I kiss the tip of her nose before stepping back, savoring the flush creeping up her cheeks. She's still rooted to the spot when I slide into my car beside Donovan.

At home, I shower and change in record time—dark jeans, a fitted black sweater, boots. No way am I telling my father about tonight. He'd find a way to ruin it.

I nearly collide with my mother in the hallway. "Hey, Mom."

"Adrian." She catches my arm. "You're coming to Ivy's memorial, right?"

I freeze. Dinner with Evelyn had eclipsed everything else. Guilt twists in my gut as I take her hands. "Mom, I can't. I have plans."

Her face falls. "Plans?"

"A date," I clarify, expecting her delight.

Instead, her frown deepens. "A date?"

"Yeah. With Evelyn, actually. She invited me to dinner with her, Dad, and Mr. Sinclair."

Her eyes widen. Then, like the sun breaking through clouds, she beams. "She's your mate."

"Not that she knows yet. But the bond's there—I can feel it."

Mom cups my face, her joy palpable. "I'll tell Ivy tonight. She'd be thrilled."

"Don't tell Dad."

"Only if you promise details tomorrow."

"Deal."

I stop at a florist on the way. Red roses this time—for love.

###Chapter 0089

Adrian's attention is relentless for the rest of the day. He meets me after every class, taking my bag without asking, walking me to my next destination. I'm hyper-aware of the stares we're drawing. Maybe the whole school has figured out he was my mystery savior. His public claim couldn't have been more obvious.

It's intoxicating how his focus narrows to only me when we're together. The arrogant Alpha persona vanishes completely. This version of Adrian is unexpected—all in, no reservations, making sure I feel it with every gesture.

"He's not fully committed yet, but he could be," Selene purrs, her voice dripping with suggestion.

"SELENE! We agreed to wait for our mate!"

"We did," she concedes, but her tone wavers. "But I like him. I like Theron too. The way they treat us... the respect..."

Her words stun me. She never wavered with Sebastian or Dorian, never entertained risks to our mate bond. This sudden interest in physical intimacy with Adrian and Theron is jarring.

"My decision stands. We're not jeopardizing our future mate by getting involved with Adrian. Not when our birthday is weeks away."

Selene sighs. "Fine. But admit it—he's exquisite. When we can shift again, I wonder if Theron would run with me."

"I'm sure he would. Question is, can you control yourself?"

"Possibly?" She laughs darkly.

I shove her aside and refocus on lunch. Donovan is laying thick charm on Genevieve, who isn't biting. We've always shared the same standards—no being anyone's conquest. Donovan's reputation with women is... extensive. If bedposts had notches, his would be whittled down to toothpicks by now. He's wasting his time with Genevieve.

When Adrian walks me to my car after school, I turn to thank him for today—but he's already closed the distance, short-circuiting my thoughts. I tilt my head back, meeting his gaze. His whisper against my ear sends electric shivers down my spine. His breath on my neck ignites a molten trail lower, and when his teeth graze my ear, it's lightning in my veins.

"It's just dinner," I manage, voice unsteady.

He presses his forehead to mine. "It's everything."

And just like that, a piece of my heart brands itself with his name. No future mate could ever reclaim it. The realization hits me like a truck—I'm falling for Adrian Grey. I stand frozen, watching him leave. He turns at his car, winks, and drives away.

Damn it. Selene and I are doomed. We're falling for our Alpha—the one we're sworn to protect, the one who might not even be our destined mate.

###Chapter 0090

With no training scheduled after school, I indulge in some extra pampering for tonight's dinner. The bathtub beckons, and I sink into the warm water scented with the jasmine bath salts Adrian gifted me last month. Candles flicker around the porcelain edges as I soak longer than necessary. After toweling off, I massage vanilla-scented body butter into my skin until it glows.

My hair takes forever to style - the blow dryer coaxing my natural waves into bouncy curls that frame my face. A light touch of mascara and lip gloss completes the look. Subtle but effective. I don't want to appear like I'm trying too hard.

The olive sweater dress hugs my curves perfectly, the cowl neckline adding just enough sophistication. Black leggings and knee-high suede boots complete the outfit. Casual yet put together.

Planning this dinner required strategy. Since Dad always grills steaks on Thursdays, I decided to elevate our usual meal. The truffle butter was my brilliant idea - it'll melt luxuriously over the meat. Dad came through with all my special requests: fresh lobster for the mac and cheese, crisp iceberg for wedge salads. Decadent but still homey.

When Dad barrels into the kitchen, he freezes mid-step. "Evelyn?"

I keep my back turned, focusing on the salad prep. "Thanks for getting the lobster and truffle butter, Dad."

"Evelyn Sinclair, why are you dressed like you're going on a date?" His voice carries that particular dad-tone - equal parts suspicious and amused.

I could play dumb, but my terrible poker face would give me away instantly. "I invited Alpha Adrian for dinner. Apparently he's been begging Alistair to let him join our Thursday dinners for years. Something about it being 'father-son time'." My fingers make sarcastic air quotes.

"So that explains the fancy spread," he says, eyeing the lobster.

"It's his first time eating here," I hedge.

Dad cuts me off with a knowing smirk. "And your first time inviting a man over for dinner."

"He saved my life, Dad."

"Uh-huh. That's the story you're sticking with?" His eyebrows practically touch his hairline.

"Aren't those steaks supposed to be prepping themselves?" I deflect just as the doorbell rings.

My breath hitches. We lock eyes for a charged second before I smooth my dress. "I'll get it."

 POINTS

The short hallway feels endless. Why are my palms sweating? I paste on a calm smile and swing the door open.

"Alistair. Hello. Please come in."

His eyebrow arches at my unusually warm greeting. "Were you expecting someone else?"

I gesture toward the kitchen with forced nonchalance. "Dad's just getting the steaks ready. If you hurry, you might catch him before he seasons them." Alistair's chuckle follows him down the hall as I lean against the closed door, exhaling sharply.

From the kitchen, I hear Alistair's surprised exclamation about the lobster mac. "Did I win some secret lottery to deserve this feast?" His question coincides with another knock.

Alistair's head snaps up, nostrils flaring. He must recognize Adrian's scent. "I've got it," I announce, spinning on my heel before he can comment.

Adrian stands on the porch holding two dozen red roses, his smile brighter than the setting sun. "Hey gorgeous. These reminded me of you." The flowers press into my hands, their fragrance intoxicating.

"Red this time," I note, stepping aside to let him enter.

He brushes past me, lips grazing my cheek. "Mmm, red means something entirely different than white." His gaze holds mine, stealing my breath and coherent thought.

"Son? What are you doing here?" Alistair's voice shatters the moment.

###Chapter 0091

"Son? What brings you here?" Alistair's voice cuts through the moment like a knife.

I instinctively step in front of Adrian, shielding him. Whether I'm protecting him or bracing for Alistair's reaction, I don't know. But this was my idea, so I'll face the consequences.

"Alpha Alistair. I invited Adrian to dinner tonight. I know this is your time with my father. If you'd prefer Adrian not to be here, we'll leave and let you two have your evening."

His eyebrow arches. "You and Adrian will leave?"

"That's right." I feel Adrian trying to move around me, but I subtly shift to keep him behind me. Alistair's gaze flickers between us, assessing.

"Alistair," my father calls, wheeling closer. "Haven't you learned your lesson about challenging Guardians yet?"

Alistair studies me for another heartbeat before his lips curve into a smirk. "You're right, Grant. One encounter with your fierce little warrior was enough for me." He turns and follows my father outside to the grill.

I exhale and face Adrian. "Well, come on in."

As he passes me, his lips brush my cheek again, sending heat rushing to my face.

In the kitchen, I gesture upstairs. "Be right back. Need to grab a vase." He takes the flowers while I dash up to my room, retrieving the vase holding the wilted roses from our first date.

When I return, Adrian is studying our living space with quiet intensity.

"Cozy," he murmurs as I reach the bottom step. "Feels like a real home. I like it."

I pause, seeing our house through his eyes for the first time. The worn leather couch where Dad reads. The photos lining the stairwell. The faint scent of pine and leather that always lingers.

"Yeah," I say softly. "I guess it is."

His gaze drops to the dead roses in my hands. "You kept them?"

"Couldn't throw them away." My fingers tighten around the vase.

Adrian takes it from me, handing me the fresh bouquet. "I'll replace them whenever you want. Where's your trash?"

I point to the bin. He disposes of the old flowers with care, rinsing the vase at the sink before filling it with fresh water. His hands are sure as he arranges the new blooms.

"Dining table for now?" he asks.

I nod. "I'll move them to my room later."

He sets the vase down with a satisfied smile. "Now, what's for dinner? Something smells incredible."

"Steak. It's a Thursday tradition with our dads."

"But that's not what I'm smelling."

"Lobster mac and cheese," I admit. "Hope you like it."

Adrian closes the distance between us in two strides. His hands settle on my hips, drawing me close. "You made me lobster mac and cheese?"

"It's for everyone," I stammer, my palms flattening against his chest. The heat of him seeps through our clothes. His muscles tense under my touch, and suddenly I'm imagining tracing every ridge down to his beltline.

His scent envelops me - crisp pine and rich chocolate, the same comforting aroma from when he rescued me. Our house may feel like home, but Adrian smells like safety. Like coming back to where you belong after the longest day. Like everything you never knew you needed.

###Chapter 0092

I didn't realize I'd pressed closer to Adrian until his lips brushed against my hair. "My little Guardian," he murmured, his breath warm against my scalp. "I'd give anything to know what thoughts are swirling through that brilliant mind of yours. But perhaps we should focus on something else before our fathers walk in and catch your scent."

His words hit me like an ice bath. I jerked away as Adrian chuckled darkly. "Dinner," he suggested smoothly. "Tell me how I can help."

My cheeks burned, but I forced myself to survey the kitchen. The macaroni bubbled on the stove, nearly ready. "Salads next," I managed, grabbing vegetables from the fridge. I thrust silverware at Adrian. "Set the table."

Father and Alistair returned with sizzling steaks. Their sharp eyes flicked between us, and I suddenly understood Adrian's warning. If they'd caught even a whiff of my arousal...

I topped each steak with truffle butter before we settled around the table. Alistair and Adrian sat opposite Father and me, putting me directly across from my future mate. "Everything looks incredible," Adrian said, though his gaze never left mine. "Thank you for having me."

I ducked my head, focusing on my plate.

Father cleared his throat. "So. The mysterious Adrian Grey."

"Yes, sir," Adrian responded politely.

Father's grin turned wicked. "Did your father ever tell you how he convinced Seraphina to date him?"

My head snapped up. "You had to win Luna Seraphina over?" Even Adrian looked surprised, his attention shifting to his father.

Alistair glared daggers at Father, who smirked. "Like Ivy was eager to be with you either, Grant."

Father nodded. "True enough." He turned back to Adrian. "Neither of us had reputations for... restraint."

Alistair snorted. "Calling what we did 'dating' is generous."

"Fair point." Father leaned forward. "So, Rik—"

"Adrian," I corrected automatically.

Father waved a hand. "Right, Adrian. Your mother and Ivy were inseparable. One day, your father spots Seraphina at school—"

Alistair interrupted, voice softening. "The world just... clicked into place."

Father continued, "Exactly. So your father, future Alpha and all, struts up to them—"

"I did not strut."

"Oh, you absolutely strutted," Father teased before resuming. "He asks Seraphina out. Now, your father didn't usually ask—girls just flocked to strong pack males." His eyes flicked to me, but Adrian wisely kept silent.

"Imagine his shock when your mother flat-out refused," Alistair took over, shooting me an amused look. "I stood there dumbstruck while they walked away. And your father?" He jerked his chin at Grant. "No help at all. Just laughed and said 'better luck next time.'"

###Chapter 0093

My gaze darted between the two men. Adrian's presence had somehow shifted their entire dynamic tonight, and I couldn't help finding it amusing.

"How exactly did you win her over?" I asked, genuinely curious.

Alistair grinned. "I convinced your father to perform a ridiculous duet with me at the bar." Grant burst into laughter so hard tears streamed down his face. "We were so terrible," he managed between chuckles, "that Seraphina finally agreed to go out with him just to make us stop."

The three of us were laughing now. "Hey, it worked," Alistair defended with a shrug.

"And that was it?" I prompted.

"Not quite." Alistair's expression turned serious. "I had to prove my intentions were genuine. That she wasn't just another conquest." His eyes softened at the memory. "She finally believed me when I commissioned a custom jewelry set for her."

Adrian suddenly leaned forward. "The aquamarine with sapphire accents?" At Alistair's nod, he added, "I designed Cara's set based on that piece. Always loved how it captured both Mom's and Shali's eye colors."

As he spoke, Selene pushed forward, making my eyes glow amber. Not to be outdone, Theron surged forward briefly, transforming Adrian's warm brown eyes into deep sapphire pools. His mother's influence was unmistakable.

"Like father, like son," Grant observed with a chuckle. "You might not have serenaded her, but grand romantic gestures clearly run in the Grey bloodline."

Alistair shot back, "You're one to talk. I don't recall you being subtle with your affections either."

"Wait," I interrupted, shocked. "Mom rejected you at first?" All I'd ever heard were stories about their perfect love story.

"Your mother turned me down multiple times," Grant admitted with a nostalgic smile. "Only made me more determined."

Adrian's curiosity mirrored mine. "So what was your grand gesture?"

"Not to be outdone by your father here," Grant began, shooting a playful glance at Alistair, "I found this obscure song called 'September Lily' and spent months learning it on guitar."

"Every. Single. Day," Alistair interjected, shaking his head. "I thought my eardrums would bleed."

Grant continued, undeterred. "On Alistair's eighteenth birthday, we staged it as a toast. I grabbed the guitar instead and sang to her, weaving through the crowd until I stood right before her." His voice softened with the memory. "At the final note, I knelt. She thought I was proposing, but we were too young. Instead, I asked her to prom."

"Bold move," Alistair commented. "She could have humiliated you in front of the entire pack."

"But she didn't," Grant said quietly.

"No, she didn't," Alistair echoed.

"So we went to prom together - all four of us - and had an incredible night." Grant smiled at the memory. "And the rest, as they say, is history."

###Chapter 0094

The moment I step into the Sinclair residence, it's obvious Evelyn has dressed up for my arrival. She's breathtaking on any ordinary day, but tonight her golden hair cascades in perfect waves, her lips painted a soft rose. The sight of her steals my breath.

Grant Sinclair raises an eyebrow when he sees me. I'm prepared for his interrogation, but what shocks me is how Evelyn immediately positions herself between us—a living shield. Her voice carries steel as she tells her father in no uncertain terms that if he has any objections to my presence, we'll take our dinner elsewhere.

Her fierce protectiveness warms my chest even as it twists my gut. The concept of having a Guardian—a warrior equal who'd fight beside me—thrilled me when I first learned of it. The reality is far more brutal. This woman who holds my soul in her hands would willingly throw herself into danger for me. Unacceptable. I'm the future Alpha of Blackthorn Pack. Protecting everyone, especially my mate and future Luna, is my sacred duty.

When I try to sidestep her, she shifts seamlessly to block me again. Across the room, my father Alistair observes this dance with keen interest. Thankfully, Grant chooses that moment to defuse the tension, and Evelyn tugs me toward the dining room.

While she searches for a vase, I study the cozy living space. Unlike the pack house's communal halls, this home feels intimate. Private. The thought of building our own den together someday takes root in my mind—somewhere we could raise our pups away from prying eyes. I'd never considered living separately before, but the idea suddenly feels essential.

"Smell that?" Evelyn asks as she arranges the flowers.

I inhale deeply. Beneath the aromas of seared meat and herbs lies her unique scent—vanilla and storm winds—that instantly calms the restless energy thrumming through me. "Not the steaks," I tease when she mentions them. Her eyes sparkle when she admits to making lobster mac and cheese, a dish she knows I adore. The realization that she planned this meal specifically to please me sends heat rushing through my veins.

Unable to resist, I close the distance between us in two strides. My hands find her waist as she melts against me with a soft sigh, her palms flat against my chest. The sweet musk of her arousal floods my senses, and for one dangerous moment, I consider forgetting about dinner entirely. But the murmur of our fathers' voices just beyond the door forces me to step back.

We're setting the table when Alistair and Grant return with the grilled steaks. The rich aromas make my mouth water. No wonder my father guards his Thursday nights so jealously—if I'd known he was being fed like royalty, I'd have crashed these dinners months ago.

I brace myself when Grant asks about being Evelyn's "mystery man," but the conversation takes an unexpected turn. Watching our fathers interact fascinates me. Alistair rarely lets his guard down, yet here he seems... relaxed. It's a stark reminder of how isolating leadership can be. Another reason the Luna's role proves vital—she provides the partnership an Alpha can't find elsewhere, save perhaps with his Beta.

###Chapter 0095

The bond between my father and Mr. Sinclair runs deeper than friendship—it’s brotherhood. They banter and tease each other like siblings, a side of Dad I’ve never witnessed before. It’s refreshing.

Evelyn looks just as stunned as I am when Dad admits he had to convince Mom to date him. I mentally scold Mr. Sinclair for bringing up how female wolves are drawn to dominant males. Way to sabotage me, Grant.

Hearing Dad commissioned Mom’s jewelry set—the same one that inspired Evelyn’s—hits me hard. I never connected the dots before. Mom’s eyes had always reminded me of the gemstones, which led me to choose something similar for Evelyn.

While I speak, Selene steps forward, proudly displaying the alluring eyes I’m describing. Theron isn’t far behind, making it clear he’s fully committed to me.

Mr. Sinclair’s remark—"like father, like son"—fills me with pride. Dad is everything an Alpha should be: strong, devoted, and loving. I can only hope to measure up when it’s my turn.

Listening to Mr. Sinclair recount how he won over Ivy Sinclair gives me hope for Evelyn and me. She doesn’t realize we’re mates yet, but I know. Just like our parents, fate will bring us together.

We pause to clear the table for dessert. Dad brought one of Mom’s homemade pies. "What flavor this time?" I ask.

Evelyn opens the fridge and sniffs. "Peanut butter?" Her tone is uncertain.

I move behind her, sliding an arm around her waist as I lean in. "Definitely peanut butter. Best pie ever. Want to make coffee?"

She directs me to the supplies while she starts washing dishes. Our fathers remain in the dining room, lost in nostalgia, leaving us alone in the kitchen.

There’s an intimacy in this mundane moment—moving around each other, sharing space. It’s everything I want. A future with Evelyn, a home, a family. For a heartbeat, I imagine the sounds of cartoons in the background, tiny feet racing through the house as we clean up together.

The emotions overwhelm me. I can’t resist.

I take her soapy hands, turn her toward me, and cup her face. My kiss is desperate, pouring every ounce of my longing into it. I need her to feel it—not just desire, but devotion. Forever.

Her scent, her taste, the way her lips yield to mine—I’m lost in her. My fingers tangle in her hair, pulling her closer as my tongue explores her mouth. One leg slips between hers, our bodies melding together.

Reality crashes back when someone loudly clears their throat.

I freeze.

We’re in full view of both our fathers—Grant Sinclair and Alistair Grey—with Evelyn clinging to my shirt, her lips swollen, her eyes dazed.

And I’ve never seen her look more beautiful.

###Chapter 0096

I glance sideways to find both fathers staring at us. "Maybe you could stop kissing my daughter long enough for dessert, Adrian," Grant Sinclair chides with a raised eyebrow.

My lips twitch. "Apologies, sir. Your daughter makes it impossible to resist such moments."

He nods slowly, understanding flashing in his eyes. "Just remember my daughter's still underage and saving herself for her mate." His pointed look tells me everything - he knows I'm her destined partner, but wants me to wait until Evelyn realizes it herself.

"Understood. I respect that completely."

"Son," Alistair Grey interrupts gruffly, "if you're going to be kissing my future daughter-in-law like that in front of me, you'd damn well better start calling me Alistair."

Victory surges through me. Finally! "Thank you, Alistair." The grin splitting my face feels permanent.

Evelyn has retreated to the sink, shoulders hunched as she regains composure. I grab the apple pie and serving knife while she collects plates and coffee mugs. Between bites of flaky crust, a burning question surfaces.

"So," I spear a forkful of dessert, "how exactly did you earn the nickname 'Little Badass,' Evelyn?" Her lips quirk before she schools her features, but not before I catch it. Her gaze darts to my father, and realization hits me like a freight train.

"Wait - you pinned my dad?" My fork clatters against the plate. My father was once the strongest Alpha in the country. Only warriors like Sebastian and I have surpassed him recently.

Grant wears a smug expression that could rival the Cheshire cat. "Not just pinned. What was the time again, Alistair? Fifteen minutes flat?"

The taunting tone makes my father scowl. "Fifteen minutes exactly. Seems the apple doesn't fall far from the tree in your family."

My jaw drops as I reassess the petite warrior beside me. I've seen her train - she's the best fighter in Blackthorn Pack. But defeating my father that quickly? Maybe challenging her to sparring matches wasn't my brightest idea.

Evelyn's forehead creases. "What do you mean? Did my mother...?"



Alistair's head swivels between Evelyn and Grant. "You never told her?" Grant blinks, then studies his daughter thoughtfully. "Guess it never came up." His smile turns tender. "You're her spitting image - same sharp tongue, same lethal skills. Ivy took your father down in under fifteen minutes too."

Evelyn's entire face lights up. The sight twists something in my chest. With her mother gone so young and Grant's subsequent grief, she probably knows less about Ivy than most know their parents. I make a silent vow to help uncover more about her mother's legacy.

"Hold on," I interject. "So she inherited her Alpha-defeating skills from her mom and got the nickname from you?" I direct this at Grant.

"Damn right," Grant confirms, pride radiating from every pore.

"My nickname comes from you?" Evelyn's eyes widen. "What was yours?" The fact that I know more about her family history than she does suddenly seems tragically unfair.

Alistair answers with a chuckle. "They called him the Original Badass - at least until your mother came along and knocked him down a few pegs."

###Chapter 0097

What an incredible night. Seeing my father so joyful, almost like he'd regained his youth, warmed my heart.

When Adrian inquired about his mother's pie, I couldn't resist inhaling deeply. The rich peanut butter aroma filled the air. Honestly, the entire room smelled like a decadent dessert between the pie and Adrian's intoxicating chocolate scent. My mouth watered uncontrollably. If noses could experience pleasure, mine would be in ecstasy. As he wrapped his arm around my waist to smell the pie, I nearly gave in to the urge to taste his neck. It was right there, so close...

Coffee! We definitely needed coffee. Thankfully, Adrian appeared far more composed than I felt. I busied myself washing dishes, trying to clear my mind while he prepared the coffee. Then suddenly, he was there, taking my hands and kissing me with an intensity I'd never experienced. The kiss was possessive yet tender, filled with so much promise that all I could do was clutch his shirt and surrender to the sensations - his mouth, his scent, everything about him overwhelming my senses.

I was so lost in the moment that I completely forgot our surroundings. Even when someone cleared their throat, I barely registered it. Adrian had me spellbound. Even after opening my eyes, I remained in his thrall, needing to shake my head slightly to regain my composure.

His question about my nickname surprised me. Dad, of course, proudly announced how I'd pinned Alistair in fifteen minutes flat.

I hadn't known my mother had achieved the same feat in her time. The revelation reminded me I needed to visit her memorial. Maybe Adrian would accompany me. Though this was usually his night with his mother, perhaps I could persuade him to join me this weekend.

The biggest shock came when I learned my nickname originated from my father. Looking back, it made sense - the older warriors had started calling me that intentionally. At the time, I hadn't understood, but now I wore the name with pride. Being compared to my father was the highest compliment imaginable.

After dinner, Adrian helped me clear the table again. When we finished, I met his gaze.

"Want to see something?"

His face lit up like I'd just handed him a winning lottery ticket. "Absolutely."

Taking his hand, I led him toward my room. "Dad, Alistair, we're going upstairs. Alistair, if I don't see you before you leave, have a good week."

They both stopped talking and stared at me like I'd grown a second head. Dad's eyes zeroed in on our joined hands. "Keep the door open, Evelyn."

"Dad! Really?"

"Door. Open." This time he directed the command at Adrian, his tone leaving no room for argument.

"Fine." Rolling my eyes, I tugged Adrian along, grabbing my flowers on the way up. I wanted them back in their rightful place.

In my room, I released Adrian's hand to return the flowers to their spot. As I cleaned up the fallen petals from my desk, I noticed Adrian studying my space. His brows furrowed slightly at the sight of my new bearskin rug. Then he closed his eyes and inhaled deeply. I sniffed but detected nothing unusual - I washed my sheets weekly. When he turned back, his radiant smile told me he'd found something pleasing. Maybe my room carried the lingering scent of his candles?

I gestured to the window seat where I often watched him train. "Sit there."

As he settled in, I retrieved The History of the Guardian from my desk drawer. Few knew I possessed this book, and I preferred to keep it that way.

Having read certain passages, I wanted to share my discoveries with Adrian. It seemed fitting, since he'd gifted me the book in the first place.

Carrying the massive tome to the window seat, I sat beside him, balancing the book across our laps. His arm encircled my shoulders, his warmth seeping into me. That irresistible chocolate scent enveloped me again, and I found myself nuzzling into his chest. I tried to be subtle, but of course, he noticed.

###Chapter 0098

"Do I smell?"

"No, definitely not." I hesitate, biting my lip. Maybe I should just drop it.

His thumb grazes my lower lip, freeing it from my teeth. "But?"

I blurt it out before I can stop myself. "Did your mom bake brownies today?"

Confusion flickers across his face. Yeah, I know—random.

"Not that I'm aware of. Why?"

I inhale again. "You smell like them. Like warm, just-out-of-the-oven brownies."

His grin turns blinding. "Is that right?" His thumb traces slow circles on my shoulder, sending sparks through me. He leans in, nuzzling my hair. "I heard my mother's brownies are your favorite."

I close my eyes, sinking into his presence. Selene is useless right now—she's been under Adrian and Theron's spell for ages.

He chuckles, pressing a kiss just above my ear. "Was there something you wanted to show me?"

My eyes snap open. Right. I didn’t bring him up here just to get distracted. I flip open the book to the marked page.

"I've been reading this history book—the one that someone," I shoot him a playful glance, catching his smirk, "got for me. Found something interesting."

I point to the passage:

Since the dawn of the Guardian lineage,
Only two have ever existed at once.
Forged by the Moon Goddess herself,
The spirit reincarnates
When the current vessel falls.

Adrian's brow furrows as he processes my unspoken question.

When he meets my gaze again, I voice it.

"It says nothing about a Guardian being born. But here I am. For five years, there were three of us." My voice wavers. "Do you think that imbalance... caused my mother’s death?"

His arm tightens around me, pulling me against his chest. I melt into him, the weight of the question finally spilling out. The kidnapping had pushed it aside, but now it’s back, gnawing at me.

His fingers absently trace my arm as he thinks. Finally, he answers.

"No. Your birth didn’t disrupt anything. There had to be a chance two Guardians would mate eventually." He pauses, letting the implication hang.

I voice the next question. "Then where is my mother’s wolf spirit?"

We stare at each other for a long moment before the rest tumbles out. "It’s been thirteen years. Shouldn’t we have seen her? Heard something? Even if she didn’t recognize Dad or me, another Guardian awakening would’ve been known. You’d have heard, right?"

He kisses my temple. "No, but we can ask my father. If another had awakened, he would’ve told yours."

He exhales. "Give me time. I have a theory, but I need to be sure before I say anything." His fingers tilt my chin up, locking onto my gaze. "Trust me?"

I smile softly. "Always."

His answering look is pure hunger. He brushes his nose against mine, so tender it makes my chest ache. Even Selene, quiet all evening, purrs in approval.

He closes the book, setting it aside before pulling me in. One hand tangles in my hair, the other slides down my back, crushing me against him. His kiss is commanding, overwhelming—and I surrender completely.

###Chapter 0099

The moment we step into Evelyn's room, I inhale deeply. Her scent wraps around me like silk. Theron practically vibrates with the urge to roll across her bedspread. I'd join him if it wouldn't make me look like a complete creep. Just imagining our mingled scents marking her sheets sends heat rushing through my veins.

Her teasing question about smelling like brownies makes my lips curl. Me? Reminding her of her favorite dessert? I bury my nose in her hair, breathing her in. Vanilla and wildflower honey - that's what she is to me.

The book passage raises more questions than answers. If only two Guardians have ever existed, how was Evelyn born? Guardians are supposed to be reincarnations of the same wolf spirit. Selene shouldn't exist. And where's the Guardian who should've taken her mother's wolf?

She's absolutely right. Thirteen years is too long for a Guardian's awakening to go unnoticed. That kind of news spreads faster than wildfire. My father would've mentioned it, or at least told Gregory. Unless...

There's one person who might have answers. King Oberon. He possessed this book, after all. But convincing the Fae king to meet with us won't be easy.

I don't want to get Evelyn's hopes up, so I simply ask for her trust and some time to arrange things. Her soft "I trust you" undoes me completely.

The book goes flying as I claim her mouth. No holding back this time. I let my Alpha aura roll over her in waves, something I've always restrained before. But Evelyn isn't some she-wolf who'll get clingy. She can handle me. Needs to handle me. I want her submission, want to feel Selene's surrender alongside hers.

Her arousal perfumes the air, mixing with that intoxicating vanilla-honey scent. The combination threatens to shatter my control. But I rein it in. This isn't about claiming - she's too young for that. But marking? That I can do.

Her breathy moan when my teeth graze her neck sends a growl rumbling through my chest.

Pulling her onto my lap, I trail kisses along her jaw. "You're fucking addictive."

I nip at her throat, tilting her head to expose more skin. These love bites might heal by morning, but my scent will linger for days. And I intend to make sure it's everywhere.

My hand slides up her thigh as I continue my assault on her neck. I need to feel her, to learn every way she responds to my touch. My strong, fierce mate - watching her surrender is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

Laying her back on the loveseat gives me better access. I peel down her leggings, slipping a finger beneath her panties. The wetness I find there makes Theron snarl with approval. My little mate is so responsive, so perfect.

When I slide inside her, Selene surges forward. Both parts of my mate giving themselves to Theron and me completely. Now comes the best part - watching her unravel beneath us.

###Chapter 0100

Her breath hitches as I claim her lips again, silencing her moans with my kiss. My fingers trace her slick folds, teasing her until she shudders against me.

"Open wider for me, darling."

She obeys instantly, spreading her thighs. I watch her face as I slide one finger inside, then another. Her back arches off the bed, her nails digging into my shoulders. The way her eyes darken with lust sends fire through my veins. I can feel Theron prowling beneath my skin, just as Selene burns in her gaze.

Fisting my hand in her hair, I take her mouth with possessive hunger. My fingers pump faster, curling just right to make her gasp. Her walls clench around me, her body tensing for release. I pull back to watch her unravel.

My Alpha power surges as I command, "Come for me, little mate." The growl in my voice surprises even me. The moment the words leave my lips, I press hard against that sweet spot inside her.

Theron roars through our bond. "MINE!"

Her climax hits like a storm. I swallow her cries, kissing her with everything I possess—love, need, devotion. My fingers keep moving, drawing out every last tremor until she's boneless beneath me.

We're both panting when I finally still my hand. I rest my forehead against hers, gently brushing damp hair from her face. My fingers stay buried inside her, feeling her pulse around me.

I need to taste her.

Slowly, I withdraw my glistening fingers and bring them to my lips. The first lick sends electricity down my spine. Fuck. She's intoxicating. My eyes roll back as I savor every drop, a growl rumbling in my chest.

"Adrian." My father's voice shatters the moment. "Evelyn has school tomorrow."

I feel her tense beneath me, but I take my damn time licking my fingers clean. This is the most exquisite flavor I've ever known.

"Be right down," I call back, though I have no intention of hurrying. Soon, I won't have to stop. Soon, she'll be mine completely.

I help Evelyn dress, my hands lingering longer than necessary. While I don't care who knows we're together, no one else gets to see what's mine.

One last kiss lets her taste herself on my tongue. Our noses brush—a wolf's gesture of affection. I need her to understand this isn't just lust. It's everything.

Standing, I offer my hand. "Walk me out?"

She stumbles when I pull her up, her body deliciously unsteady. The press of her curves against me makes my cock ache, but that's a problem for later. Right now, my mate needs me.

When she finds her balance, I cup her face. "Beautiful."

And she is—eyes still hazy with pleasure, lips swollen from my kisses, neck marked by my teeth. No one has ever looked more perfect.

Downstairs, I bid my parents goodnight. Father mind-links that we'll talk tomorrow. Whatever he wants can wait. Nothing's ruining this high.

###Chapter 0101

I press Evelyn against my Porsche, my body humming from our earlier encounter. She must feel the evidence of my desire pressing insistently against her abdomen. No subtlety there.

Her hands find their way around my neck as mine settle on her hips, anchoring her to me. The streetlight casts shadows across her face, highlighting the uncertainty in her eyes.

"Be mine," I murmur against her lips.

Her breath hitches. "What?"

"Exclusively. For the next seven weeks." My thumb traces the curve of her waist. "No other guys. No dates. Just you and me—holding hands between classes, kissing by the lockers, the whole damn fairytale."

I know about her vow to wait for her mate. The irony tastes sweet on my tongue—she's waiting for me without knowing it. Theron growls approval in my mind.

"Can I... think about it?" Her fingers toy with the hair at my nape.

"Take your time." I capture her hand, pressing a kiss to her pulse point. "But understand this—I want Evelyn Sinclair. Not just the Guardian. Not just the warrior. Every stubborn, beautiful inch of you."

A quiet "Okay" escapes her lips.

"Good." I nip her bottom lip. "I'll collect you at seven tomorrow."

When she nods, I seal the promise with a kiss that leaves us both breathless. Already planning to rearrange my morning patrol to accommodate this new routine.

"Sweet dreams, love."

I watch until her front door closes behind her. The drive home is torture—every nerve ending alive with unspent energy. Cold shower. Definitely a cold shower.

Alistair

The creak of the staircase announces Evelyn's return. I track her movement through the house until her bedroom door clicks shut.

"You're brooding," Gregory observes from the armchair. Moonlight glints off the whiskey in his glass.

Tonight had been... nostalgic. Watching our children navigate the same rites of passage we once did. Haven't seen Gregory this relaxed since Ivy's passing.

"Not brooding," I correct. "Considering."

"Considering what?"

I turn toward the darkened hallway. "How Adrian will handle a mate who's also his Guardian. Our bond is unbreakable, but at least you weren't..." I rub my sternum. "If Seraphina had been a Guardian, I'd have gone mad trying to protect her from herself."

Gregory's gaze lifts to the ceiling where Evelyn's footsteps fade. "We don't choose these things. The compulsion to protect our Alpha is written in bone and blood."

"I know." The weight of the Alpha mantle settles familiar across my shoulders. "But their instincts will war against each other. That girl would throw herself in front of a bullet for him, and he'd burn the world down to keep her safe."

The silence stretches between us, filled with the unspoken truth—we might be raising two warriors destined to destroy each other with devotion.

###Chapter 0102

Sleep eluded me all night. Adrian's question played on repeat in my mind. A part of me screamed to say yes—to take the chance, to know him. But the rational side warned of consequences. If he wasn't my mate, this could complicate things later. Still, as his Guardian, understanding him was necessary. I'd just have to keep my walls up.

Dawn arrived too soon. Exhaustion clung to me, but routine pulled me from bed. Training couldn't wait any longer. Father would protest. Adrian might too. But sitting idle wasn't an option.

I dressed quickly and stepped outside as warriors gathered. Adrian hadn't arrived yet, so I greeted the others. Slaps on the back, warm welcomes, the usual camaraderie after an absence.

"Evelyn." Father's voice cut through the chatter. "You should be resting."

"I need to train. My strength won't rebuild itself."

"Next week," he insisted.

I squared my shoulders. "No, sir." The title was deliberate—a reminder this wasn't a father-daughter conversation. The field fell silent. Warriors watched, waiting to see who'd yield.

"Evelyn." A warning.

"Sir." I held his gaze. "You taught me to fight through pain. 'The enemy won't wait for you to heal.' Your words. This is how I was raised. So I'm starting today. Sir."

His glare burned. The air thickened with tension. Then warmth pressed against my back—Adrian's presence, his scent wrapping around me. Chocolate and spice. I didn't turn. This was between me and my father.

Alpha Alistair approached, resting a hand on Father's shoulder. "She's Ivy's daughter through and through, don't you think, Gregory?"

Father remained silent.

"Better she trains under your watch than sneaks off alone," Alistair added.

A muscle ticked in Father's jaw before he exhaled sharply. "Fine. But you stop when I say. No sparring—obstacles only."

"Yes, sir." I flashed him a quick smile before facing Adrian. His brows were drawn together. "Going to argue too?"

Hands raised in surrender, he stepped back. "Wouldn't dream of it." That grin—equal parts charming and infuriating.

Father barked orders. "Adrian. Evelyn. You're up first."

The outdoor course loomed ahead. Familiar terrain gave me an edge, but Adrian's raw strength still tipped the scales. At the gunshot, we launched forward.

Halfway through, I noticed it—Adrian matching my pace, hovering just close enough. He crossed the finish line mere seconds before me. My lungs burned. My time was pathetic. But I'd finished.

I grabbed the water he offered. "You held back. Why?"

A shrug. "Wanted to make sure you didn't need help. You didn't." His gaze held mine. "But I'd have been there if you did."

###Chapter 0103

This unexpected sweetness isn't something I'd ever associate with the old Adrian. The cold, distant Alpha I once believed him to be. But after witnessing his leadership, his unwavering support in countless situations, I'm no longer surprised.

We pivot, cheering for the other warriors now. Our collective gasps and groans follow each fall, each flying object that finds its mark. Even weakened, I still placed third—right behind Adrian and Sebastian.

"You call yourselves warriors?" My father's drill sergeant bark cuts through the air. "My daughter, who was nearly dead days ago, just outperformed most of you! Pathetic!"

During sparring drills, I assist my father in training. While he focuses on the weakest links, I approach the group facing Adrian. "Listen up," I command, halting their movements. "Who can tell me the Alpha's signature move?"

Predictably, Sebastian answers. "He uses his height and speed to take you down. For shorter opponents, an uppercut. For taller ones like me, a leg sweep. Once you're on the ground, his strength pins you."

"Correct. So how do you counter it?" Silence. Even Adrian watches me, curiosity flickering in his gaze.

"Anticipate it."

Sebastian scoffs. "That's your genius advice? I already try that."

"You don't," I counter. "I've watched you. You know our moves, yet we still best you every time."

"Because he's Alpha and you're Guardian," he mutters.

"Wrong." Adrian steps forward. "You expect to lose. You get lost in the fight and forget to anticipate."

"Exactly." I pick up the thread, shoulder brushing Adrian's as we face the warriors like co-instructors. United. The solidarity thrums through me. "When did we last use our signature moves in the first five minutes against you?"

"Now try it." I step back as Adrian advances. At my whistle, Sebastian engages—but predictably loses focus. The others watch, waiting for the sweep.

"Jump!" I shout.

Sebastian reacts too late. Adrian still takes him down. "Better," I say as Adrian helps him up. "See the difference?"

"Yeah," Sebastian admits, dusting himself off.

"When do we get to watch you two spar?" he asks. The others echo the question eagerly.

"Monday," I say, just as Adrian declares, "Not for another week."

We lock eyes. "No," he growls. "You're not at full strength yet."

"Julian!" I call out, ignoring him. "Get your betting pool ready."

I step toe-to-toe with Adrian. He shakes his head, but I know how to play this game. By Monday, I'll be close enough to full strength. And in this? Even losing means winning.

"Here's the deal, Alpha. Spar me Monday. If you win, last night's question gets a yes."

His eyes darken. "Dirty play, little Guardian."

"Just using every weapon I have."

He extends his hand. "Deal."

Our handshake seals it. Behind us, Julian starts taking bets.

Training ends. Warriors disperse. Adrian's gaze lingers. "I'll pick you up in forty-five minutes, Evelyn."

"See you soon, Adrian." I turn toward the house, then pause. He hasn't moved—still watching me. "Oh, remind me to ask you something on the way to school."

His smirk sends heat up my spine. "Can't wait."

I walk inside, feeling his stare like a physical touch the entire way.

###Chapter 0104

The moment Gregory and I step onto the training grounds Friday morning, two things catch my attention. First, Evelyn stands ready in workout gear. Second, the entire pack has gone silent as she verbally spars with her father.

I move to stand behind her. If she's determined to train, I'll be her partner. My priority is ensuring she doesn't overexert herself. While I'm proud of her determination, recovery requires balance.

During sparring sessions, my chest swells with pride when Evelyn positions herself to coach warriors facing me. Her teaching style electrifies the air - she forces my fighters to strategize rather than react. Of course Sebastian recognizes my signature move when she quizzes them. I shouldn't be surprised she knows it; she's been forged into a warrior since childhood.

Her combat intellect outshines everyone present. When she delivers a simple counterstrategy that leaves Sebastian speechless, I watch realization dawn across the warriors' faces. She's absolutely right - the only way to defeat a predictable fighter is to anticipate and prepare.

When Sebastian dismisses her solution as impractical, I intervene immediately. Taking my place beside Evelyn, I make our united front visible. The pack needs to see their future Alpha and Luna aligned. This display of unity strengthens the entire Blackthorn Pack - divided leadership breeds weakness.

Evelyn proceeds to dissect Sebastian's technique flawlessly. Next time we spar, he'll be harder to defeat - exactly why I'm grooming him as my lead warrior.

"Will you two spar?" Sebastian asks, and our simultaneous responses echo across the field. I had no intention of facing her so soon... until she offers the ultimate incentive.

Herself.

The challenge hangs between us. I quickly assess the possibilities - my skills are refined enough to exhaust her without causing injury. Normally I'd never push her this way, but if this is what it takes to claim her as my mate, I'll gladly oblige.

When Gregory calls an end to training, I savor the sight of Evelyn's retreating form before heading toward the pack house. My father falls into step beside me.

"Son, is sparring with Evelyn wise? She's strong, but is she ready?"

"I share your concern," I admit. "But she's made her answer conditional on the outcome. So while I'd prefer to wait, I'll win that fight - and her."

He studies me thoughtfully. "Just ensure you don't spend the next month nursing her back to health."

"Trust me, Father. I have this handled."

At Evelyn's cottage, she's already exiting when I arrive. I jog over, taking her bag and stealing a quick kiss on her nose.

That delicate blush spreading across her cheeks undoes me. My fierce warrior turns into a flustered girl at the slightest affection.

When we reach my car, she pauses. "Is this my birthday present?" she asks.

###Chapter 0105

I give Evelyn an embarrassed smile as I open the car door for her. "It's mine, though I'll admit I didn't see this coming. I'd been eyeing this model for ages, planning to buy it eventually. Guess my mother notices more than I thought."

She slips into the passenger seat and I shut the door behind her. When I reach the trunk to stow her bag, the scent of vanilla and honey already fills the interior. The confined space makes her natural fragrance even more intoxicating.

As we pull out of her long driveway, I recall her earlier words. "What was it you wanted to ask me?"

She twists in her seat to face me. "You can say no." Like I'd ever refuse her anything. Unless she asks me to stay away—that's the one request I'll never honor.

I glance over to find her fidgeting with her hands in an uncharacteristic display of nerves. Without thinking, I cover her restless fingers with mine. Her anxious eyes meet mine. "I haven't visited my mother's memorial in weeks. I'm going this weekend... and I wondered if you'd come with me."

"You're inviting me to your mother's memorial?" My pulse jumps. She wants to share this intimate moment with me. Better yet, it means I won't need an excuse to see her this weekend.

"Yes, but if you're not comfortable—"

"I'll be there," I interrupt. "On one condition."

She eyes me with suspicion. "Which is?"

I wait until we're stopped at a red light before answering. "Have dinner with me tonight."

When hesitation flickers across her face, I add, "Not as my girlfriend. Just two people sharing a meal. That's allowed, isn't it?"

The car behind us honks, forcing me to drive on before she responds. We're already parking at school when she finally speaks. "Alright. Dinner tonight."

Sunshine might as well be bursting through the clouds. She said yes. An entire evening with Evelyn to myself. Now I just need to make sure every detail is perfect. My grin stretches so wide it hurts.

I'm out of the car in a flash, reaching her door just as she tries opening it herself. "My job," I tell her, swinging it wide and offering my hand. When she stands, I can't resist pulling her close. "Thank you," I murmur against her ear.

Her breath hitches. "For what?"

"For saying yes. You just made this the best day." I steal a quick kiss, the first of many I plan to take today—and all weekend if she'll let me.

After grabbing our bags, I risk threading my fingers through hers as we walk toward the building. When she doesn't pull away, I escort her to her locker—even though mine's clear across the courtyard.

Miraculously, after collecting her books, she asks if I need anything from my locker. Smiling, I lead her there by the hand, only releasing her long enough to swap out my textbooks.

I walk her to class, claiming one more kiss before reluctantly heading to my own. The entire way, I can't stop whistling.

###Chapter 0106

Adrian arrives precisely when he said he would. The moment I step outside, I notice his restless energy as he jogs toward me, taking my bag without a word. His lips brush my nose in a featherlight kiss that sends heat rushing to my cheeks.

Romantic Adrian is dangerously addictive.

He opens the car door with effortless grace. Okay, I could definitely get used to Chivalrous Adrian too. Not that I'd ever admit how much I enjoy his undivided attention.

As we drive, he reminds me about my unanswered question. I don't understand why his answer matters so much, but the thought of him visiting my mother with me makes my pulse race. The intensity of my desire makes me hesitate, so I blurt out that he's free to refuse before even asking. I could swear I hear him stifle a laugh.

My fingers twist together nervously as I stare out the window, struggling to form the words. Then his hand covers mine, warm and steady. When I meet his gaze, those piercing eyes hold me captive. The question tumbles out before I can stop it.

Hearing him repeat it back with disbelief makes me cringe. It sounds ridiculous now. I immediately start backtracking, offering him every possible out.

His agreement brings instant relief—until he attaches a condition. A date.

Here's the problem. My entire existence has revolved around training and academics. Morning drills, school, evening practice, homework, sleep. Repeat. Weekends? More training. Dating has never been part of the equation. At nearly eighteen, I'm clueless about dating etiquette.

Unfamiliar insecurity claws at me. What if Adrian thinks I'm too inexperienced? What if I embarrass myself and he regrets wasting time on me? He claims it's just dinner, not a girlfriend outing. Dinner I can handle. We survived last night's family meal, right? How different could a restaurant be?

Lost in these thoughts, I barely notice we've reached school until Adrian clears his throat. 'Just say yes. It's only dinner,' Selene chimes in, deciding for me. His megawatt smile when I agree could power cities. Nothing compares to being the focus of that radiant expression. My heart does somersaults beneath my ribs.

His gratitude for accepting our date makes the piece of my heart he already owns expand. The quick kiss he steals leaves me breathless, so when his fingers intertwine with mine as we enter school, I don't protest.

Outside my classroom, he kisses me again. Though I'd said this was conditional on being his girlfriend, I'm growing addicted to this version of Adrian. He couldn't care less about spectators—his entire world seems to narrow to me alone. It's heady stuff.

The pattern continues all day. He escorts me between classes, stealing kisses at every doorway.

At lunch, Donovan's still trying to thaw Genevieve's icy demeanor. Her frosty attitude only seems to fuel his determination. Good luck with that.

After lunch, I decide to flip the script. Before he can initiate our usual goodbye kiss, I grab his collar and yank him down. This isn't some chaste peck—I pour everything into it. He responds instantly, pinning me against the hallway wall with bruising intensity. When my tongue traces his lips, he parts them without hesitation.

He reclaims control within seconds, the kiss turning possessive.

When we break apart, his eyes mirror my dazed expression. Smirking, I give him one last quick kiss before slipping free. "See you after class, Alpha," I murmur over my shoulder, sauntering into the classroom. The growl that follows sends delicious shivers down my spine.

After school, we collect our weekend assignments before heading to his car. At the trunk, he suddenly spins me against the passenger door, claiming my mouth in a kiss so fierce it steals my breath. Forehead pressed to mine, he rasps, "Consider that payback for driving me crazy in the middle of school, little guardian."

His smirk as he opens my door leaves me lightheaded. This man obliterates my senses with every kiss.

###Chapter 0107

Today is perfect. Every time I see Evelyn, I can't resist stealing a kiss. She doesn't push me away - instead, she's started anticipating them.

By lunchtime, I'm floating. I've arranged a special dinner tonight and convinced my mother to bake Evelyn's favorite chocolate fudge brownies. Donovan is still pursuing Genevieve. I know my friend - the more she resists, the harder he'll chase. If Julian were taking bets, I'd put my money on Donovan without hesitation.

After lunch, I walk Evelyn to class. I'm about to steal another kiss when she shocks me by pulling me down and kissing me exactly how I've fantasized. For one stunned second, I freeze before responding, pressing her against the hallway wall. When her tongue teases my lips, heat shoots straight to my groin. I take control instinctively.

We're in the middle of school with an audience. I hear guys snickering and girls sighing. Don't care. Let them all see she's mine.

Breaking the kiss leaves me intoxicated - by her scent, her taste, everything. Her eyes glaze over briefly before sparkling with mischief. She pecks my lips, slips from my grasp, and throws me a smoldering look that turns me rock hard instantly. My little guardian is publicly flirting with me. The growl rumbling in my chest is pure satisfaction.

If this is our future, I'm done for. Completely, utterly gone. And I've never been happier.

I barely take three steps toward class when Donovan appears beside me. "Might want to handle that situation in your pants before walking into class, Alpha." I glance down. Damn it. No amount of adjusting will hide this.

"Thanks," I mutter, detouring to the restroom. Again, this girl has me so worked up I need to take care of business at school. The thought of how I'll punish my little guardian for this distraction makes me finish embarrassingly fast. Somehow, I still make it to class on time.

After final bell, I find Evelyn waiting. When we reach my car, I pin her against the door before she can enter. I pour everything into this kiss - passion, desire, possession. Her soft moan when I pull away sends another jolt through me. Forehead against hers, I whisper that this is her punishment for distracting me all day. The way her legs wobble when I step back fills me with smug satisfaction.

I hold her hand the entire drive home, addicted to the electric current between us that intensifies daily as her birthday approaches. Once she recognizes me as her mate? After we complete our bond? The thought makes me lightheaded.

At her house, I rush to open her car door. She's mine, and I want her to know this is how I'll always treat her. Pleasure curls through me when she waits this time. I help her out, sling her bag over my shoulder, and lead her to the door.

"I'll pick you up at six," I say, taking both her hands. "Wear something nice. I'm taking my future girlfriend out tonight." I kiss her nose, moving toward her lips when Gregory clears his throat behind me.

"Good afternoon, sir." I extend my hand. "I'm taking Evelyn to dinner tonight."

He eyes me skeptically, glances at Evelyn, then back. "She's your responsibility tonight, Adrian. Anything happens to my daughter, you answer to me."

"Of course. She'll be safe with me."

Most fathers are thrilled when their daughter catches an Alpha's attention. Not Gregory Sinclair.

"Do I need to review the rules, Adrian?"

"No, sir." I remember perfectly - she's waiting for her mate. Her mate being me. I'll respect her ignorance of that fact, even as I feel our bond strengthening daily.
###Chapter 0108

"Dad. You do realize I'm HIS Guardian, right? Not the other way around? Shouldn't you be warning me not to hurt him?"

A smirk tugs at my lips. Evelyn can't see it, but Gregory can. His gaze slides past me to his daughter. "First, you're not at full strength yet. Second, this is a date, not a mission. He'd better treat you with the same respect and protection he'd give any woman he's courting." His steel-gray eyes lock onto me. "Isn't that right, Alpha?"

"Absolutely, Guardian." I mirror his formal tone. "Your daughter will be treated with the utmost care tonight."

Gregory turns back to Evelyn. "Go warm up for training. Light drills today."

"Yes, Dad." She gives a quick nod.

As I turn to say goodbye, Gregory's voice stops me. "Adrian. Join our training sessions starting Monday."

My jaw nearly hits the ground. "It would be an honor, sir."

A single nod, then he wheels himself inside.

I'm still staring at the doorway when Evelyn's fingers brush under my chin, closing my mouth. She steps into my space with a smirk. "Looks like you'll be seeing more of me, Alpha."

My hands find her waist. "After I wipe the floor with you Monday, Little Guardian, you'll be spending more than just training time with me. Six o'clock sharp. Don't keep me waiting."

I crush her against me in a searing kiss before striding to my car. When I glance back, she's touching her lips, watching me with those storm-gray eyes. Yeah, she's mine.

Home smells like chocolate. My mother has the brownies boxed and ready, along with a picnic basket complete with wine glasses. I kiss her silver-streaked hair. "Thanks, Mom."

"Your father's waiting in his office."

Alistair Grey looks up from his desk when I enter. Dark circles shadow his eyes.

"Any word from Sebastian about Victor Blackwood?"

"Traces. Nothing concrete." He rubs his temples. "That man's been evading capture for decades."

Disappointing, but expected.

"Son, we need to discuss Evelyn."

I straighten. This is new.

"Have you considered what mating a Guardian means?"

Theron growls in my mind. We already nearly lost her once. The thought of her deliberately walking into danger...

"I have." My knuckles whiten on the armrests. "I want her beside me, not in front of me. Protecting her is my right as her mate. But she's stubborn. We'll need... boundaries."

Alistair exhales heavily. "Clint's loyalty nearly destroyed me after the attack. If it had been your mother..." He doesn't finish. Doesn't need to.

I rise, mind already racing through arguments for tonight. Evelyn fights like a hellcat, but I'll make her see reason.

"Good talk, Dad."

As I reach the door, he calls out, "Where are you taking her?"

"Celestia." My chest swells. "Only the best for my girl. Then stargazing at Blackthorn Point with Mom's brownies."

A rare smile cracks his stern features. "Don't keep her out too late."

"Wouldn't dream of it."

The shower runs cold as I scrub away the day's tension. Tonight changes everything. And I'll be damned if I let anything—or anyone—ruin it.

"Dad. Did you forget I'm HIS Guardian, not the other way around? Shouldn't you be warning me to protect him?"

A smirk tugs at my lips. Evelyn can't see it, but Adrian can. His gaze slides past me to Evelyn. "First, you're not at full strength yet. Second, this is a date, not a mission. He'd better treat you with the same respect and protection any woman deserves on a date." His piercing eyes lock onto me. "Isn't that right, Alpha?"

"Absolutely, Guardian." I mirror his formal tone. "Your daughter will be treated with the utmost care tonight."

His attention returns to Evelyn. "Go get ready for training. Light strength drills today."

"Be right there, dad."

As I turn to say goodbye, Gregory stops me. "Adrian. Join our afternoon training sessions starting Monday."

My jaw nearly hits the pavement. "The honor would be mine, sir."

A single nod, then he wheels inside.

I'm still staring when Evelyn's fingers press my chin up, closing my mouth. She steps into my space. "Guess you'll be seeing more of me, Alpha."

My gaze burns into hers. "After I wipe the floor with you Monday, Little Guardian, you'll be spending far more than training time with me. Be ready by six." I yank her against me, claiming her lips in a searing kiss before striding to my car.

She stands frozen, fingertips brushing her swollen lips. Exactly where she belongs - under my touch.

Home. Mother has the brownies ready, along with a picnic basket complete with wine glasses. I kiss her silver-streaked hair.

"Dad wanted to talk?"

"Office."

The knock echoes. His weary face lifts when I enter.

"Any word from Sebastian about Victor Blackwood?"

"Traces. The bastard's good at hiding."

I nod. Expected, but disappointing.

"Son... about Evelyn."

I straighten. Unexpected.

"Have you considered what mating a Guardian means?"

It's haunted me. Theron and I already feel violently protective. Losing her to Victor nearly destroyed us - and that was before bonding. It'll only worsen after marking her.

"I have. No easy answers, Dad. I can't command her to stand down. Won't. I need a partner beside me, not a shield in front. Protecting her is my right as her Alpha, her mate. But we'll need clear boundaries."

His knuckles whiten. "Good. No advice to give. My bond with Gregory was hard enough. If it had been your mother..." He trails off. The unspoken horror hangs between us.

"Just wanted you thinking ahead."

I smile. Planning for the future is what good Alphas do. And my father raised me right.

"Where are you taking her?"

"Celestia." My chest swells. "The full experience. Then stargazing at the overlook with brownies."

His approving nod follows me out. Tonight changes everything.

###Chapter 0109

Father takes it easy on me during training, but the workout still leaves me pleasantly sore. Every movement strengthens not just my body, but Selene too. She's fully present in my mind again, though not strong enough to shift yet.

I skip the bath for a quick shower, knowing I'll need extra time to get ready. Since Adrian didn't specify where we're going—only that I should dress up—I settle on a deep red off-the-shoulder sweater dress. A wide brown belt cinches my waist, paired with knee-high leather boots. I style my curls into loose waves, adding a small braid pinned to one side. My makeup is subtle—soft smoky eyeshadow, glossy lips, just enough liner and mascara to accentuate.

A knock interrupts my final touches. I grab my jacket and purse, hurrying downstairs.

Adrian stands there, devastating as ever, holding a vase of tulips.

He lets out a low whistle, raking his gaze over me. "Well, damn. I might need to start a fight tonight just to remind everyone you're mine."

I roll my eyes, ignoring the heat in my cheeks. "Tulips? And you brought your own vase?"

He kisses me lightly as I take the flowers. "Wanted to surprise you. And you only had that one vase."

Father glances up from the living room. "Adrian." His eyes flick to the tulips, then back. "Interesting choice."

Adrian smirks. "Yes, sir."

I look between them. "Do tulips mean something?"

Father turns back to the TV without answering. Adrian kisses me again, murmuring, "Maybe."

Shaking my head, I set the vase on the counter before calling goodnight to Father.

Adrian laces his fingers through mine, leading me outside. "So where—"

He pins me against the car, kissing me hard. My hands tangle in his hair, pulling him closer until he groans against my mouth. When he pulls back, his eyes are dark. "Delicious."

I smirk. "Must be the lip gloss."

"Definitely not the gloss," he growls.

The drive passes in comfortable silence, his hand warm on my thigh. Then he says, "We're dining at Celestia tonight."

My breath catches. Celestia—the most exclusive restaurant in the territory.

I glance down at my outfit. "Am I dressed okay?"

Adrian looks unfairly perfect in a sapphire button-down, sleeves rolled to reveal crisp white cuffs, untucked over black slacks. His usually tied-back hair falls loose tonight, framing his sharp jawline.

He squeezes my hand. "You're breathtaking."

Celestia lives up to its name. Twinkling lights weave through ancient trees, transforming the clearing into something magical. Soft music floats through the air, blending with the rustle of leaves. Through floor-to-ceiling windows, candlelight flickers across intimate tables, the dim glow ensuring privacy despite the crowd.

It feels like stepping into a dream.

###Chapter 0110

Adrian approaches with an amused smirk, clearly enjoying my awestruck expression. The restaurant's grand entrance leaves me breathless. His fingers intertwine with mine as we step inside. My heart leaps when I spot Theodora at the hostess stand.

Her face lights up at our arrival. "Alpha, Luna... Evelyn, welcome to Celestia."

"Theodora." My smile feels impossibly wide. "What a wonderful surprise."

She returns my smile before casting Adrian an oddly apologetic glance that makes me curious.

"Right this way." Theodora guides us toward a secluded booth. As we pass through the dining area, the ambient chatter dies instantly. Every patron turns to watch our progress, heads bowing respectfully toward Adrian.

Our semicircular booth offers both intimacy and a breathtaking forest view. "Don't hesitate to call if you need anything," Theodora says, presenting our menus before withdrawing.

Adrian's hand finds mine as we peruse the selections. "Does this always happen when you go out?" I ask, unfamiliar with public outings with an Alpha.

He cocks his head. "What do you mean?"

"That." I gesture vaguely. "The sudden silence. Everyone staring."

A casual shrug. "Pretty sure they were looking at you too."

I snort. "Why would anyone bow to me?"

His expression suggests I'm being deliberately obtuse. "You're a Guardian," he states, as if explaining the obvious.

Before I can argue, our waitress appears. "Alpha," she purrs, barely glancing my way before devouring Adrian with her gaze. My fingers tighten around the menu. Yes, he's devastatingly handsome, but professional decorum exists for a reason.

Selene surges forward, equally offended by the blatant disrespect. Just as I open my mouth, Adrian looks up briefly. "Evening, Rosalind."

He turns back to me. "Wine?"

"Sure."

"Red?" He scans the wine list.

"Do you even like red?" I've never seen his preferences.

His answering smile makes my pulse stutter. "Tonight I do."

"Adrian-" I try to protest, but he's already ordering an expensive bottle along with water. Rosalind flashes what must be her most seductive smile, which Adrian completely misses as his attention returns to me. Her expression sours noticeably as she retreats.

In this moment, it's as if we're the only two people in the world. The intensity of his focus is intoxicating, pulling me deeper into his orbit with each passing second.

###Chapter 0111

Adrian approaches with an amused smile, clearly enjoying my awestruck expression. The restaurant's exterior is breathtaking, all gleaming glass and twinkling lights against the night sky. His fingers intertwine with mine as we step inside.

Theodora stands at the hostess podium, her face lighting up when she sees us. "Alpha Grey, Miss Sinclair, welcome to Celestia."

"Theodora!" I can't hide my delight at seeing a familiar face. "How wonderful to see you again."

She returns my smile before casting Adrian an oddly apologetic glance that makes me curious.

"Right this way," she gestures, leading us toward a secluded booth. As we pass through the dining area, conversations hush. Every patron turns to watch our progress, offering respectful nods to Adrian.

Our booth curves gracefully, offering both intimacy and a stunning forest view. Theodora hands us leather-bound menus. "Please don't hesitate to ask for anything you need."

Adrian's warm hand covers mine as we peruse the menu. "Does this always happen?" I whisper.

He tilts his head. "What exactly?"

"The way everyone goes silent when you walk in. Like you're royalty or something."

A chuckle rumbles in his chest. "Pretty sure half those stares were for you, Evelyn."

I snort. "Why would anyone care about me?"

His gaze turns serious. "You're a Guardian." He says it like it's the most obvious thing in the world.

Before I can argue, our waitress appears. "Alpha," she purrs, barely glancing at me before letting her hungry gaze roam over Adrian. My fingers tighten around my menu. The audacity.

Selene surges forward, bristling at the disrespect. I'm about to speak when Adrian looks up briefly. "Evening, Rosalind."

He turns back to me. "Wine?"

"Sure."

"Red okay?" His thumb strokes my knuckles.

"You drink red?" I've never actually seen his preferences.

His lips curve. "Tonight I do."

"Adrian-" I start to protest, but he's already ordering an expensive bottle along with water. Rosalind flashes him a sultry smile that he completely misses as his attention returns to me. Her expression sours when she turns away.

In this moment, it's like we're the only two people in the restaurant. The intensity of Adrian's focus makes my pulse quicken. I could drown in those storm-grey eyes and die happy.

###Chapter 0112

What could possibly make my girl this flustered? My fingers brush against hers as I take her hand. She should never feel embarrassed or hesitant to share anything with me. Ever. I want every corner of her life to be open to me.

The question seemed innocent enough—just a playful icebreaker. On previous dates, I'd gotten responses like "I stole my first kiss at eight" or "I walked in on my parents going at it in the laundry room." Lighthearted confessions. But this? This matters to Evelyn. And now I'm burning with curiosity.

Her gaze stays fixed on the napkin she's twisting between her fingers. "Promise you won't laugh?"

The intensity in my voice surprises even me. "Never."

A shy smile tugs at her lips before those mesmerizing eyes finally meet mine. "This is...my first date. Ever."

My breath catches. I blink. Once. Twice.

How? She's nearly eighteen. A Guardian. Rumors swirled about her spending time with Sebastian, but she's never been on a date? Thank the Moon Goddess I chose Celestia for tonight. The thought that I'm her very first date sends heat rushing through my veins.

My silence makes her fidget. She starts to look away again, but I catch her chin, tilting her face up. Our lips hover centimeters apart. "I'm honored to be your first," I murmur against her mouth. "I don't know what cosmic luck brought me here, but I'll take it. And I intend to be the first for many more experiences we'll share."

Her eyes glisten—was she really worried I'd react badly? If anything, I'm ecstatic. No exes to measure up against. Every first will be ours.

This time, it's Evelyn who closes the distance. Her kiss is tentative but electric, a spark that'll one day ignite into an inferno. For now, I savor her inexperienced passion, the sweet little sounds she makes, the way her fingers tremble against my jaw.

An exaggerated cough shatters the moment. Rosalind needs to learn some damn boundaries.

"Your appetizers," she announces with fake cheer. "Need anything else?"

Evelyn's hand stays on my face as she answers without breaking eye contact. "We're perfect."

+15 BONDS

As Rosalind retreats, I bring Evelyn's palm to my lips. My tongue traces slow circles on her sensitive skin. Her breath hitches, pupils dilating. Keeping her hand captive, I select a piece of cheese and guide it to her lips.

Her moan when she bites down goes straight to my groin. "Try it with the wine," I suggest.

She obeys, watching me over the crystal rim as she sips. "You're right. Divine."

Now it's her turn. She assembles prosciutto on bread with her free hand and offers it to me. I keep my grip on her wrist as I let her feed me, lips brushing her fingertips.

We continue this sensual exchange until the plates are empty. There's something profoundly intimate about feeding each other—a primal act that feels more erotic than any overt gesture.

In this moment, clarity strikes like lightning. I don't just want this woman tonight. I want every meal, every sunrise, every battle and triumph for the rest of my damned life. And come hell or high water, I'll make sure we have it all. Together.

###Chapter 0113

My envy toward Rosalind evaporates instantly. It's impossible to resent someone who's clearly suffering because of my presence.

When Adrian inquires about my deepest secret, my mind blanks. There must be other private things about me, but right now, all I can focus on is him. The way his scent wraps around me, the heat of his gaze. So I take the plunge and confess about this being my first date, bracing for mockery.

Instead, his eyes light up. His words about this being the first of many shared experiences send Selene purring in my mind. She's already smitten. I'm still guarded - his notorious past lingers in my thoughts like storm clouds. This tender version of Adrian seems unreal, and I need to protect my heart.

Then he licks my palm.

Suddenly, I understand why people obsess over appetizers.

When Rosalind returns, I glance at Adrian. "What's good here?"

His smile could power a city. "You already tasted my favorite. Filet and lobster." My cheeks warm remembering my gift to him.

I turn to Rosalind. "Any specials tonight?"

She pales slightly. "We have Wagyu Beef Chateaubriand for two."

"Perfect," Adrian declares before I can respond. His fingers brush mine as he adds, "Choose your sides, Evelyn. They're à la carte."

"I trust you, Alpha." The wattage of his smile could blind someone as he orders.

Once we're alone, I steer the conversation back. "Your turn. Tell me something no one knows about you."

He tucks a loose strand behind my ear, fingertips lingering. "I've never brought anyone here except family."

That shocks me. The candlelight, the wine, the intimate booth - this place screams romance.

"Why?" I whisper.

His brow furrows. "Why what?"

"Why me?" The question bursts out. If this is just about the Guardian bond, why the roses and soft touches? Selene and I are falling fast, but I need to know if this is real before we plunge over the emotional cliff.

"Don't you see?" His thumb traces my jaw. "You're extraordinary, Evelyn. And I plan to spend every day proving it to you."

There's no stopping the freefall now. My stomach swoops as our food arrives, saving me from responding.

Dinner flows easier after that. The Wagyu melts like butter, and Theodora's mate Leopold visits our table.

"Did you cook this masterpiece?" I ask, remembering his incredible lunch.

His chest puffs with pride. "Every bite. Enjoying it?"

We shower him with praise until Theodora appears, beaming at her husband. "This restaurant was all his vision," she boasts.

Leopold kisses her temple. "But it's my fierce mate who made the dream come true." The love between them is palpable.

###Chapter 0114

Adrian answered for both of us. "You've outdone yourselves tonight. The ambiance, the cuisine, the service - flawless. Thank you for making my evening with this extraordinary woman unforgettable." I nodded in agreement as they offered dessert. Adrian declined, saying we had other plans and requested the check.

"Other plans?" I arched an eyebrow when they left.

He flashed that irresistible smirk. "Our date isn't over yet. I hope you'll enjoy our next stop as much as dinner."

"At this point, I wouldn't doubt you. You've anticipated my preferences better than I have." My fingers traced the stem of my wine glass. "Though I suspect the company is the real highlight."

"The feeling is mutual." He brought my fingertips to his lips, sending electric currents up my arm.

Instead of heading toward Blackthorn territory, Adrian drove toward the human city's outskirts. When we stopped at an unfamiliar clearing, he retrieved a wicker basket from the trunk.

"A midnight picnic?" I asked as he opened my door.

"You'll see." His hand found mine as we followed a narrow dirt path.

The trail ended abruptly at a cliff's edge overlooking the human city's distant glow. The vantage point offered perfect stargazing - close enough to admire civilization's twinkling lights, far enough to see every constellation.

Adrian spread a wool blanket beneath an ancient oak and produced a bottle of wine. "Courtesy of Luna Seraphina."

"How is she?" I hadn't visited the packhouse in months.

"Worried about you." He uncorked the bottle with a pop. "We both are. You train with our warriors, but otherwise... you keep to yourself."

I shrugged. "Between combat drills, university, and assignments..." My voice trailed off as he handed me a crystal glass.

"That changes now." His tone left no room for argument.

The basket yielded a covered ceramic dish. Before he lifted the lid, the rich chocolate aroma made my mouth water.

"No way!" I nearly dropped my glass. "Your mother's famous triple-fudge brownies?"

His grin confirmed it. "When I told her they were for you, she baked two batches."

The first bite sent me into sensory overload. The perfect balance of chewiness and molten chocolate center. "What's her secret? Mine always turn out like hockey pucks."

When I opened my eyes, Adrian's gaze had darkened to predatory intensity. Even in moonlight, I saw his pupils dilate. Selene's answering purr vibrated through my chest loud enough for him to hear.

"Care to share that thought?" His voice dropped an octave.

I shook my head, hastily finishing the brownie. He mirrored my actions before leaning against the oak's trunk.

"We need to talk, Evelyn."

###Chapter 0115

This night couldn't have been more perfect. The candlelit dinner, the soft music playing in the background, the way Evelyn's laughter filled the space between us—everything was flawless. Now standing at the cliffside overlook with the stars stretching endlessly above us, I've never felt more alive. The crisp night air gives me the perfect excuse to pull her tighter against me.

Selene's constant purring intrigues me, but when Evelyn playfully refuses to explain, I let it go. There's something far more important I need to discuss with her. I've been turning it over in my mind since yesterday, and now, with just the two of us under the moonlight, it's time.

I lean back against the oak tree and pat my thigh. "Come here," I murmur. All evening, I haven't been able to keep my hands off her, and now the distance between us feels unbearable.

She moves to sit beside me, but I catch her waist and pull her into my lap instead, facing me. I need to see those storm-gray eyes when I say this.

She gasps as she settles over me, her thighs bracketing mine. Probably the first time she's ever been in this position without pinning someone down in combat training.

"I want to talk about last night," I say, my voice low. "About what it means for us."

Her brows knit together as she remembers, so I don't give her time to question me.

"When you thought my father would punish me, you stepped between us. You acted as my Guardian instinctively, even when I didn't need protecting." She opens her mouth to protest, but I press a finger to her lips.

"Let me finish." She nods, and I trail my hands down her arms to rest at her hips. "I've had time to think about what happened in the woods with Victor. To imagine what would've happened if you'd..." My throat tightens. "Evelyn, I can't live with myself if you take a bullet—or an arrow, or a damn nuclear warhead—for me. I don't know how my parents bear that weight, but I won't."

I take a steadying breath. This next part is everything.

"I want us to be partners, not Alpha and Guardian. I know I'll never keep you from a fight, but I need you beside me, not in front of me. If we fight together and something happens, that's fate. But never—never—throw your life away for mine."

I take her hand and press it over my pounding heart. "I'm strong, Evelyn. Strong enough that I probably don't need a Guardian. But since the Moon Goddess blessed me with the fiercest warrior alive, who am I to argue?" My grip tightens. "Your life means more to me than duty ever could. Promise me—when the time comes, you'll stand with me, not for me."

A storm of emotions crosses her face—defiance, understanding, reluctant acceptance. Her free hand rises to my chest, fingers splaying over my heartbeat.

"I can't promise I won't protect you," she says finally. "Being a Guardian is like being Alpha—it's in my blood. But..." Her thumb brushes my collarbone. "I do want to be your partner in every way."

My grin could split my face. I surge up to capture her lips in a searing kiss, pouring everything I can't say into it.

"Thank you," I growl when we break apart, foreheads touching.

She nuzzles her nose against mine, eyes closed in quiet contentment. "Can I tell you something?" she whispers.

"Tell me everything, Evelyn Sinclair. Every thought, every secret—I want it all."

Her answering smile is my undoing.

###Chapter 0116

Her nose traces a slow path from my cheek to my ear. Warm breath ghosts over my skin a second before she speaks, and I’m already hardening beneath her. “You smell even sweeter than your mother’s cinnamon rolls.” Yeah, I’m done for.

I drag my lips along the delicate curve beneath her ear. “Can I confess something?” My whisper draws a visible shiver from her. She’s as lost in this as I am. Her nod brushes against my jaw. “You’re pure vanilla and wildflower honey. Every damn time you’re close, I have to stop myself from devouring you. And when I finally do?” A low groan escapes me, and the intoxicating scent of her desire rises between us. My teeth graze her earlobe. “You taste even sweeter than you smell.”

Her throat arches—just enough surrender to make my pulse spike. I don’t hesitate. My mouth claims her neck, licking, biting, descending toward where her mate mark will one day bloom. I want her to feel the pleasure that’ll soon be carved into her skin forever.

I keep going, slower now. But the second my tongue swipes over the unmarked spot, her entire body locks up. I freeze. Her heartbeat thunders against my lips. Her breaths come sharp and shallow—not from pleasure. Panic.

I wrench back. Her eyes are wide, haunted. My palms frame her face. “Evelyn.” Nothing. “Evelyn!” Her gaze snaps to mine. “That’s it. Look at me. I’m right here.”

“I—I—” The stammer cracks something in my chest. Then it hits me. Last night, I’d littered her neck with kisses, but between her sweater and my own hunger to watch her, I’d never reached this spot. The place Victor had sunk his fangs into, over and over. I just catapulted her back into hell.

“Evelyn.” I wait until her eyes lock on mine. “I will never force my mark on you. Never. You’re safe with me. I swear it.” Her nod is stiff, but I pull her against me anyway, arms banding around her, rocking us gently.

I hold her until the tension bleeds from her limbs and her hands clutch my shirt. “Sorry,” she whispers.

I grip her shoulders, putting space between us. “Don’t. This is on me. I got reckless. I should’ve known.”

Her face is still too pale. “I ruined—”

“You didn’t.” Scooping her up, I pivot us until she’s cradled between my legs, her back to my chest. My chin rests on her shoulder. “Did you know I can name every constellation up there?”

A weak headshake. “No.”

“Watch.” I point to three jagged stars. “See that triangle? That’s Nemo.”

She twists to glare at me. “Nemo? Like the clownfish?”

“Obviously.” Deadpan.

One eyebrow arches. “That’s not a real constellation.”

“Sure it is.” I trace the imaginary lines. “Front star’s his nose, back one’s his tail, top fin’s right there. Nemo.”

A giggle shakes through her. Good. I spin more absurd names until she joins in, until we’re breathless with laughter, the night wrapping around us like a promise.

“I should get you home. You need rest, and I want to see you tomorrow. Preferably before your dad banishes me again.”

“He can’t banish you if I’m awake. And… can we visit my mom tomorrow?”

“Absolutely. But I’ve got a condition.”

“Which is?”

“Dinner with me at the packhouse after.” Her agreement sends a thrill through me. Tomorrow’s going to be perfect.

###Chapter 0117

The panic attack hit me out of nowhere. One moment I was fine, the next—flashes of that night surged through me like a tidal wave. The terror. The agony. Adrian was there instantly, grounding me with his steady presence. But it left me shaken. What happens when I finally meet my mate? He’ll want to claim me. What if I freeze again? What if I can’t do it?

I barely slept, those questions gnawing at me.

Training with Dad was lighter than usual, but still exhausting. By the end, every muscle screamed. A scalding bath was the only solution. I dumped in the last of the muscle soak Adrian had given me and sank into the water, letting it leach the soreness away until it turned tepid.

I need flowers for Mom’s memorial. Luna Seraphina and Adrian probably bring something formal, but spring’s here—I want color. Something vibrant, like she was.

Adrian’s picking me up at three. Plenty of time to grab flowers and cram for finals. Graduation’s in three months. Nothing’s stopping me from walking that stage.

At lunch, Dad only nodded when I told him my plans. “Good. Your mother would’ve wanted you there.”

The florist’s shop smelled like damp earth and petals. An elderly woman smiled from behind the counter. “Need help, dear?”

“Yes. I’m visiting my mother’s memorial, but I don’t know what to bring.”

“Did she have a favorite flower?”

I shook my head. “She died when I was little.”

“Oh, I’m sorry.” She gestured at the blooms around us. “There’s no wrong choice. You can pick by color, meaning, even birth month.”

Birth month. “What’s the flower for May?”

“Lily of the Valley.” She led me to a cluster of delicate white bells. “These.”

I brushed a fingertip over one. “Lily of the Valley… I wonder if that’s why she was named Ivy?”

The woman’s eyes sharpened. “Your mother was Ivy Sinclair?”

“Yes.”

She pressed a hand to her chest. “Goddess above. You’re Evelyn Sinclair?”

I tensed. “How do you know me?”

“Dorothy,” she introduced herself, shaking my hand eagerly. “I knew of your mother through Luna Seraphina. They were close.” She hesitated. “May I suggest something?”

“Please.”

“Luna’s been receiving red and white arrangements all winter. Since it’s March now, we have daffodils—the birth flower for this month. Pairing them with lilies would make a lovely spring bouquet.”

I agreed, and she began assembling it. The shop’s bell chimed as another customer entered. Then the scent hit me—warm, rich, unmistakable.

Chocolate.

###Chapter 0118

I spin around and there he is—Adrian.

He hasn’t spotted me yet, but I see his nostrils flare as he catches a scent.

I dart behind a towering fern, pulse quickening.

Let him hunt us. Selene’s laughter echoes in my mind.

Peering around the planter, I search for him—only to yelp when strong arms encircle me from behind.

"Found you." His breath is warm against my ear.

Laughing, I twist in his grip and loop my arms around his neck. "Selene thought it’d be entertaining to make you work for it."

"Theron was already sharpening his claws," he murmurs before claiming my lips. "What brings you here?"

"Flowers for Mother. You?"

He laces our fingers together, leading me toward Theodora, who’s wrapping my bouquet. "Picking up the arrangement I ordered yesterday. For your mother."

I slant him a look. "When you were supposedly here just for my tulips?"

"Guilty." His grin is unrepentant.

"Do these blooms carry secret meanings I should decode?"

"Only one woman gets flowers chosen by their symbolism." He brushes a kiss to the tip of my nose.

"Perfect love?"

"That’s what you are." His smile lingers as he turns to Theodora. "Afternoon."

"Oh, Alpha!" She nearly drops the ribbon. "Let me finish the future Guard— I mean, Miss Sinclair’s order, then I’ll fetch yours."

"No rush. I came to collect this vision before Ivy’s memorial. Saved me a trip."

"I drove here, Adrian. My car’s outside."

He tugs me closer. "I’ll send someone for it. Unless you need to leave?"

I glance down at my dress. I’d planned to fuss over my appearance, but he’s already seen me. "No—"

###Chapter 0119

I checked my watch for the tenth time. Still too early to pick up Evelyn. My fingers tapped impatiently against the steering wheel. Every instinct screamed at me to go now, but I forced myself to wait. She had her own life, her own schedule. The last thing I wanted was to smother her.

When I couldn't stand it anymore, I drove to the florist. The bouquet of violets waited for me, just as I'd ordered. Seraphina had suggested adding more color to Ivy's memorial. The scent of vanilla and honey hit me the moment I stepped inside. My pulse quickened.

'She's here.' Theron's voice rumbled through my mind, eager as a pup. He'd been dying to properly chase our mate. But Selene hadn't fully emerged yet, leaving him frustrated.

I followed my nose through the aisles. There - a flash of movement behind a display of orchids. She'd hidden on purpose, this clever little guardian of mine. As if she could ever escape my notice.

My arms wrapped around her waist before she could react. That startled squeak sent warmth flooding through my chest. Breathing in her scent, the tension melted from my shoulders. Just being near her soothed the chaos in my mind better than any meditation.

A sudden thought of Sebastian hit me. Years without his mate, yet he still led Nightshade Pack with steady hands. Most Alphas went feral without their other half. I respected his control, but if he so much as looked at Evelyn wrong, I'd rip his throat out.

Convincing Evelyn to ride with me took some doing. At the memorial, her nervous energy was palpable. Having never lost my parents, I couldn't fathom her pain. But I'd stand by her through it all.

"You and your mother did all this?" Evelyn's voice wavered as she took in the sea of flowers.

I pointed to a cluster near the base. "Those are from your father. The ones in back are from pack members paying respects. The side arrangements are from Mother and me."

Taking her hand, I led her forward. So many lives Ivy Sinclair had touched. According to Seraphina, she'd been the kind of woman who lit up every room she entered.

Releasing Evelyn's hand, I approached the stone angel. My fingers brushed the folded hands, just as Mother always did. "Thank you, Mrs. Sinclair, for your sacrifice. My mother promised we'd never forget, and we haven't." I added softly, "I'm keeping my word to you. She'll always be safe."

Evelyn moved beside me. "What promise?"

I made space for our flowers at the angel's feet before answering. The memory played vividly behind my eyes.

"The day your mother died, we were under attack. My mother tried getting us to safety, but we were cut off. Then your mother appeared like an avenging angel." My throat tightened. "I'd never seen anyone fight like that. Until you."

The scene unfolded in my mind - the snarls, the blood, Ivy's wolf going down under too many attackers. My mother fighting desperately to protect me. Then those piercing eyes locking onto mine.

"I'm trusting you to watch out for her. Keep her safe for me. Promise me, Adrian. Promise you'll always look after my little girl."

Evelyn's sharp inhale pulled me back. "Those were her last words. I don't think even my mother heard. I never told anyone." My laugh held no humor. "Guess she didn't know her daughter would be a guardian too."

Taking Evelyn's hands, I met her shimmering eyes. "So you see, this isn't just about being Alpha, or how I feel about you. This is a sacred vow to your mother."

My palm cradled her cheek. When she leaned into my touch, something primal in me purred. The kiss was soft, tasting the salt of her unshed tears. My thumbs brushed them away before they could fall.

"Don't cry, love."

She composed herself, placing her flowers beside mine. "Can I have a moment alone with her?"

"Of course." I kissed her forehead. "I'll be at the car."

Leaning against the hood, I replayed that day. There'd been something in Ivy's eyes when she made me promise. Almost like she knew. Knew Evelyn and I were destined. Impossible, yet... I think she did.

###Chapter 0120

Adrian walks back to the car, leaving me alone with my mother's memorial. "I miss you, Mom," I whisper, tracing the engraved letters with my fingertips. "I wish you were here to guide me through all this. Dad tries his best, but he's not you."

Closing my eyes, I imagine her standing beside me. The wind brushes my cheek like a gentle caress.

Follow your heart, Evelyn. It never lies.

The words echo in my mind so clearly it sends shivers down my spine. For a fleeting moment, I swear I catch her lavender scent—the one she always wore. "Thank you," I murmur, blinking back tears. "I love you."

When I return to the car, Adrian presses a kiss to my temple before opening my door. The drive to Blackthorn's pack house is quiet, but my nerves are anything but. I've never dined there before. From what I've heard, meals are chaotic affairs with pack members cramming into the dining hall—some living on-site, others just visiting.

Adrian's fingers intertwine with mine as we step out. Though I haven't officially accepted being his girlfriend yet, I've already made my decision. After Monday's sparring match, I'll say yes. My mother's advice settles in my bones like an unshakable truth.

The moment we enter the dining hall, conversations stutter to a halt. Dozens of eyes lock onto me. My stomach twists.

"Evelyn!" Luna Seraphina's musical voice cuts through the silence as she strides toward us, her silver-streaked hair gleaming under the chandeliers.

"Luna Seraphina," I force a smile, though my palms are sweating. Adrian's thumb strokes the back of my hand, steadying me. His quiet confidence is an anchor.

She pulls me into a warm embrace. "Adrian mentioned you'd join us tonight, but I had to see it to believe it." Gesturing to the high table where Alpha Alistair, Donovan, Benedict, and other ranked wolves sit, she adds, "You'll dine with us, won't you?"

"Of course."

Luna Seraphina tugs me away from Adrian, who rolls his eyes. "Mother, you can't monopolize her all evening."

"Nonsense. If you want to sit beside her, make Donovan move."

Donovan freezes mid-bite, glaring at Adrian as if he'd lost his mind. With a grumble, he shifts down one seat, leaving me sandwiched between Adrian and Luna Seraphina.

An omega approaches, bowing slightly. "What would you like for dinner, Guardian?"

"Ah—what's available?"

"Anything you desire," the omega says with a proud smile. "Our chefs are exceptionally versatile."

I glance at Adrian, but he just grins, leaving the choice to me. Turning to Luna Seraphina, I ask, "What do you recommend, Luna?"

"Call me Seraphina, darling. Or Sera, like your mother did." She winks. "And between us? I'm hopelessly addicted to Italian."

The omega stifles a laugh behind her hand. Clearly, the Luna's pasta obsession is pack legend.

###Chapter 0121

"The chicken parmesan here is divine. Our chef makes it better than any I've tasted before, don't you agree, Alistair?" Seraphina Grey remarks, glancing at her husband. The Alpha has a forkful of food suspended mid-air, clearly caught off guard by being dragged into the conversation.

"Not quite as good as my signature truffle butter steak," he replies with a wink at me. I return his smile. "Chicken parmesan it is," I tell the waiting omega.

Dinner conversation flows effortlessly. Seraphina radiates excitement at my presence, while Benedict's mate Phoebe appears equally pleased to have another female joining their male-dominated pack hierarchy.

Excusing myself after the meal, I follow Adrian's directions to the restrooms. Though nature calls, what I truly need is a moment to collect myself. The evening's unexpected attention leaves me breathless - exhilarating yet overwhelming.

Emerging from the stall, I find a she-wolf waiting. "All yours," I say, attempting to pass.

"You realize he'll tire of you eventually, right?"

I freeze. "Pardon?"

"That infatuated act won't last. He always loses interest. Then you'll just be another notch on his bedpost."

Her barb strikes true, voicing my deepest insecurity. What if this connection isn't real? What if his feelings don't match mine?

'She reeks of jealousy,' Selene observes. 'Beneath our notice.'

My wolf's calm rationality steadies me. Choosing the high road, I remark, "Green really doesn't suit you."

The she-wolf scoffs. "Are you blind? I'm not wearing green."

I offer a serene smile. "The color of envy. It looks terrible on everyone - you included."

"Why would I envy you?" she spits.

Her sudden transformation alerts me to Adrian's approach before I see him. Her posture softens, voice dripping honey. "Alpha," she purrs. "I was just welcoming Evelyn to the pack house." My eyebrow arches at the blatant lie.

Adrian's arms encircle me, his scent and warmth enveloping me like a protective cloak. "Is that what you were doing, Bianca? Sounded more like you were insulting my future mate."

Her face pales as she stammers for excuses.

He nuzzles my hair. "Did you know Evelyn pinned my father in combat within fifteen minutes?" Her eyes widen at this revelation.

"Or that wolfsbane doesn't affect her?" Now her gaze resembles saucers.

"Adrian," I murmur, though my protest emerges breathless. His proximity, his deep voice vibrating against my skin, turns my bones to liquid.

"Or," he continues, tracing my neck with his nose, "that she can mind-link her father from distances where I can't sense mine?"

Switching sides, he adds, "That even silver restraints can't silence Selene?"

Defeat flashes across Bianca's face. Did she truly believe me an ordinary she-wolf? Surely she knew something of a Guardian's capabilities. Then again - she's no warrior.

###Chapter 0122

The sudden silence behind us makes me freeze. Every eye in the room is fixed on our exchange. Adrian raises his voice to address the crowd. "If anyone's foolish enough to challenge my Guardian, good luck - you'll need it. And after I defeat her in our sparring match on Monday, she'll officially be my mate."

My muscles tense at his bold declaration. I should've seen this coming. He's never been subtle about claiming me in public.

It's Sebastian who reacts first. "Wait! The 'yes' Evelyn would give if you win is to become your mate?" He asks like this changes everything. I feel Adrian nod against my shoulder.

"Well damn! Sorry Evelyn, I was betting on you, but now..." Nathaniel shakes his head. "No way Alpha's losing this one." From my peripheral vision, I see Bianca slinking away, wounded pride evident.

I twist in Adrian's arms to face them directly. Not just Sebastian - all the warriors are huddled around Julian now. "You can't all bet on Alpha Adrian. That's not how betting works when everyone chooses the same side."

"Are you serious right now?" I demand.

Nathaniel pops his head up. "Sorry Evie, we didn't know you were the prize. No chance Alpha's losing on Monday." I glance over my shoulder at Adrian's smug expression. His arms remain locked around me like steel bands.

"Evelyn?" Alpha Alistair's voice cuts through the chatter. The betting table falls silent immediately.

"Yes Alpha?"

"You heard the stories the other night. You should know a Grey never loses when his heart's set on something. Isn't that right, Seraphina?" He turns the same infuriating smirk Adrian wears toward his mate.

Seraphina presses her lips together before a reluctant smile breaks through. She meets my eyes. "I'm sorry darling, but Alistair's right. If I were to place a bet..." Every warrior's head snaps up like prairie dogs. "I said if I gambled, which I don't," The heads drop back down. "I'd have to wager on Adrian this time."

I shake my head in disbelief. "Fine. If everyone's betting against me, at least make it interesting." They all turn expectantly. I step out of Adrian's embrace toward their table. "You really think he'll take me down that easily? Why not bet on how long it'll take him to pin me?"

Julian's face lights up. "Genius!" He starts scribbling new odds. Sebastian glances at me. "Has Selene shifted yet?"

"Not yet, I-" Selene pushes forward to answer. "Tomorrow, warrior. My first shift comes tomorrow. And if any of you doubt me again, I'll personally remind you on the training grounds exactly who you're dealing with."

Every warrior immediately bows their head in deference to Selene. "Our apologies, Selene. It's just...we know you're not at full strength yet, and Adrian with Theron have made their intentions clear. No disrespect - we know your power." They rush to appease her.

Only when Adrian's arms encircle me again does Selene settle. His voice drops an octave as Theron surfaces. "Does this mean we get our run tomorrow, little guardian?"

###Chapter 0123

The dinner was perfect.

I could feel every eye in the room tracking our movements, watching Evelyn. This was her first official appearance as my chosen mate, and just as I’d anticipated, my mother had strategically surrounded her with high-ranking pack members to ease her nerves.

I moved between conversations, engaging with the others while keeping my focus locked on Evelyn. Ready to intervene if the crowd became too much. When she excused herself to find the restroom, I pointed the way, understanding she needed a moment to breathe.

My gaze never left the hallway. If she took too long, I’d go after her. This night had to be flawless—her comfort was non-negotiable. The pack needed to see her as their future Luna, and that meant ensuring she felt at ease among them.

Then I spotted Bianca slipping toward the bathrooms.

Hell no.

I was on my feet instantly, cutting through the crowd. Bianca rounded the corner without noticing me, and what I overheard made my blood boil.

But Evelyn—goddess, she was magnificent.

She didn’t rise to Bianca’s bait. Didn’t flinch when that venomous she-wolf claimed I’d discard her. Instead, Evelyn simply arched a brow and said, "Jealousy is such an ugly look on you."

As if I’d ever give her up.

The sheer audacity of Bianca’s delusion bordered on insubordination. So I did what any self-respecting Alpha would do—I claimed my mate. Again.

Every wolf in the room fell silent as I listed every reason Evelyn was the only she-wolf worthy of standing beside me. They knew her strength in training, but they had no idea the depth of her resilience.

By the time I finished, even the doubters couldn’t deny it.

Announcing our official match on Monday had already sent shockwaves through the betting pool, but I didn’t care. Let them adjust their wagers. No one was foolish enough to bet against me now.

Evelyn’s compromise—betting on the match’s duration—was clever. I had no intention of hurting her, but I wouldn’t make it easy either. This would be a battle of endurance, and I’d savor every second of wearing her down until she was pinned beneath me.

Then Selene stepped forward, declaring she’d shift tomorrow for their run.

Theron nearly shoved me out of my own mind in his eagerness. He’d been restless for days, desperate to be near his mate. When he leaned in, his voice was a low purr against Evelyn’s ear. "Tomorrow, little guardian. Just you and me."

Her smirk was pure challenge as she twisted in our arms. "Think you can keep up, Theron?"

A growl ripped from my chest. "I’ll chase you to the ends of the earth if I have to. You can’t hide from me."

Her eyes flashed gold before Evelyn reeled her wolf back and leveled a warning look at Theron. "Behave, or no more runs. Understood?"

He nuzzled her cheek, unrepentant. "Define ‘behave.’"

She scoffed. "You’re just as bad as she is." A sharp nip to my chin, then she pushed at my chest. "Give Adrian control. He’s walking me home."

I wrestled Theron back and took her hand. She hadn’t pulled away yet, and I wasn’t about to stop.

"Let me say goodbye to your parents first," she said, tugging me toward them.

My mother embraced her warmly. "I hope we’ll see you again soon, Evelyn. Tonight was wonderful."

Evelyn’s smile was wry. "Well, since I’m apparently losing on Monday, and part of our deal means I’ll be here more often… you might get sick of me."

###Chapter 0124

Mom's gaze shifts between me and Evelyn, her face lighting up with joy. "That's fantastic! And with your father back training the warriors, perhaps we can convince him to stay home more often. I've missed having both of you around."

"I'll do my best," Evelyn replies, waving at my father before we step outside. The evening air is crisp, the last remnants of daylight fading fast. "You cold? I can grab you a jacket." A thought strikes me. "Better yet, come with me. I'll give you one of mine."

I tug her back inside, leading her upstairs to my room—a place she's never seen before. It's decently clean, I think. But more importantly, when I return tonight, her scent will linger here.

As we enter, I release her hand and head to the closet.

"So this is your room?" Her voice holds a note of wonder.

I pause, seeing my space through her eyes for the first time. It's just always been my room—filled with trophies from school and Alpha tournaments, a few personal touches here and there. But if she doesn’t like something, I’ll change it. The only thing that matters is that she’s happy here with me.

I turn back to her.

"It's enormous!" she breathes, eyes wide.

I shrug. "Never really thought about it. One day, it’ll belong to my Luna too, so it had to fit both of us."

If I hadn’t been watching her closely, I would’ve missed the way she stiffens. She doesn’t know she’s my mate yet, and I can only imagine what’s running through her mind.

Before she spirals, I hand her a hoodie—one that carries my scent. She takes it, subtly inhaling, her eyes fluttering shut for a brief second. Pure bliss crosses her face.

Gods, her birthday can’t come soon enough.

She slips it on, and I zip it up for her, pulling the hood over her head. "Ready?"

"Ready."

The walk to her house is quiet, but it’s a comfortable silence. Just being near her, breathing in her scent, settles something deep inside me—a calm I’ve never known before.

But as we reach the forest’s edge, emotion swells in my chest, impossible to contain. It’s too soon, but I don’t care.

I stop, turning her to face me. Cradling her face in my hands, I stare into those emerald eyes.

"I love you, Evelyn Sinclair." The words spill out, raw and honest. "I know it’s early. I know you’re waiting for your birthday before making this kind of commitment. But I need you to know—what I feel for you is real. I love you. That will never change."

Shock flickers across her face, followed by something softer, warmer. Then, without warning, she leans in, pressing her lips gently to mine.

"I think I’m falling for you too, Adrian."

Ever heard how the Grinch’s heart grew three sizes? Yeah. That’s exactly what this feels like. My chest threatens to burst.

She’s falling for me.

I respond the only way I can—pulling her close and kissing her with everything I have.

###Chapter 0125

Adrian's confession last night should have left me tossing and turning. When he'd talked about needing space for his Luna, doubt had clawed at me. The idea of another woman wrapped in his scent, claiming what might not be mine, sent sharp pains through my chest. But then those three words—"I love you"—ignited a wildfire of hope. Maybe Selene's instincts, my own racing heart, were right all along. That thought carried me into dreams with lips curved upward.

Sunday morning light spills across my bed. Wrapped in Adrian's hoodie, his pine-and-ember scent clinging to the fabric, I'd slept deeper than in months. Selene pulses beneath my skin, restless and strong, demanding release. Adrian promised to escort us to the woods, standing guard in case the shift proves harder than usual.

Dad drills me with pool laps before breakfast. Two hours of relentless strokes leave my muscles trembling. By the time I step onto the back porch, steam still rising from my shower, Adrian appears at the tree line. His jog slows as our eyes meet.

"Morning, gorgeous." He closes the distance in three strides, capturing my mouth before I can speak. My fingers tangle in his dark waves, pulling him closer. Every point of contact sparks electricity. The hard press of his arousal against my hip makes me gasp.

"Little guardian," he growls against my lips, "unless you want me bending you over that log right now, we need to stop."

I bite my lower lip as I step back. Selene's impatience thrums through me, but not before I catch the hunger darkening Adrian's gaze. Time for payback.

Instead of seeking cover, I peel the sweatshirt overhead in one fluid motion. His sharp inhale is victory itself. Turning, I take my time peeling the yoga pants down my legs, bending just enough to hear Theron's growl vibrate through Adrian's chest.

Strong hands seize my hips, yanking me against his rigid length. "Playing with fire, sweetheart," he rasps, teeth grazing my shoulder.

His palms skate up my torso, thumbs brushing peaked nipples. A moan escapes as liquid heat pools between my thighs. Then—stinging impact. His palm connects with my ass hard enough to leave a mark. "Last. Warning."

I stumble forward, legs unsteady. Damn him for turning me into this needy, breathless mess.

Crouching, I brace for the shift. Bones begin cracking before I'm fully ready. White-hot agony lances through me.

Breathe. We've done this before. Selene's voice cuts through the pain.

Fur brushes my side. Theron, massive and silver-furred, presses against me. Where his body touches mine, the pain dulls. My panting slows as Selene surges forward, completing the transformation amidst the scent of pine and the warmth of her mate beside us.

###Chapter 0126

Panting heavily, we collapse onto the soft earth. Theron pads over and nuzzles Selene affectionately, his rough tongue swiping across her muzzle in encouragement.

Selene rises with newfound energy, sauntering toward him with deliberate grace. She presses her body flush against his, marking him with her scent. The boldness of it makes me blush. Just when I think she might do something even more brazen, she flicks her tail sharply across his face before darting away, her playful yips echoing through the trees.

Theron gives chase instantly, his teeth snapping playfully at her heels. They race through the forest for what feels like hours, reveling in the freedom of their wolf forms. Eventually, Theron mind-links that it's time to rest, leading us to a secluded pond before disappearing into the underbrush.

Selene laps at the cool water before stretching out in a sunlit patch of grass. Theron returns moments later with a freshly caught hare, dropping it at her paws like some primal courting gift. She devours it while he settles beside her, watching with unmistakable pride.

I tune out until she's finished. Love her as I do, some wolf habits still turn my stomach. When she's done, she rubs her muzzle against Theron's shoulder, and he cleans the remaining blood with slow, deliberate licks. The intimacy of it—lingering far longer than necessary—sends warmth flooding through me. She rests her head on his paws, and he drapes his own across her neck protectively as she drifts off.

Hours later, Theron rouses her with gentle nudges, and we begin the leisurely trek home. Selene moves slower now, muscles tired but content. Back at the clearing, I shift and reach for my discarded clothes.

Adrian materializes behind me, his arms encircling my waist. "Theron hasn't stopped talking about today," he murmurs, his breath hot against my bare shoulder. "He's been waiting months for this."

I twist in his embrace—both of us achingly aware of our nakedness. "Selene loved every second. Next time, she won't go easy on him." My gaze lifts to his glacier-blue eyes, crinkling at the corners with amusement.

"Theron thrives on a challenge." His hands slide downward, palms curving possessively over my hips. "Has anyone told you how breathtaking you are?" He leans back, drinking me in with shameless appreciation. "I knew you were stunning, but this—" His thumb brushes my collarbone. "—this is art."

His nose traces the shell of my ear, his voice dropping to a growl. "One day, I'll memorize every inch of you. Every scar, every freckle, every place that makes you gasp." My knees nearly buckle as his teeth graze my pulse point. "Would you like that, little guardian?"

"Yes." The word escapes in a shuddering exhale. I've never wanted anyone like this—never imagined I could. But Adrian ignites something primal in me, something that hums beneath my skin.

"Good." He steps back abruptly, putting frustrating distance between us. "For now, get dressed. Dinner at the packhouse awaits."

I gape at him. "How do you just—stop?"

His smirk is downright sinful as he gestures to his very evident arousal. "Does this look stopped to you?"

My throat goes dry. Goddess above, the rumors about alphas weren't exaggerated. That's... intimidating. And intriguing.

Adrian cups my chin, his thumb brushing my lower lip. "It's meant for pleasure, not fear." The promise in his eyes steals my breath. "When the time comes, I'll prove it." A chaste kiss lands on my nose. "Now clothes. Before I forget my resolve."

###Chapter 0127

Evelyn's reaction to my fully erect state wasn't what I anticipated. She's made it clear she's untouched, but she's still a werewolf. Surely she's seen naked warriors before. That flicker of fear in her eyes threw me off. But the curiosity beneath it? That I can work with.

Telling her I'd make love to her someday was risky. Promising to show her every pleasure she could imagine was bolder still. Yet she doesn't realize I'm declaring her as my mate.

When she admitted wanting my hands and mouth on her? Goddess help me. Cold showers and lonely nights will be worth it if she grows comfortable with intimacy before her birthday. It'll make our marking ceremony smoother for her.

I need to ease her into letting me near her neck too. Last night spooked her, so we'll take it slow. The thought of exploring every inch of her isn't helping my current situation. I'm painfully hard, my loose sweatpants doing nothing to conceal it.

"Coming?" she asks when dressed.

I rake fingers through my hair. After running through the woods, we both need showers. I gesture to my obvious predicament. "Gregory might object to seeing me like this around his daughter. I'll wait here." Maybe I can find privacy to handle this while she's gone.

"Dad's at the packhouse. Your mother personally called him this morning to help with warrior training. He might stay for dinner." She rolls her eyes. "Apparently my father can't resist your mother's requests."

The Goddess is favoring me today. I take her hand. "Let's go then."

We head straight to her bedroom. "I'll shower after you," I say, moving toward the loveseat.

Silence.

I turn to find her clothes pooled around bare feet, her flawless body on display. "Join me," she says, walking toward the bathroom. My already straining cock turns to steel.

I swallow hard. "You're sure?" She seemed intimidated before - now it's worse.

She glances over her shoulder, that heart-shaped ass swaying. "Only if you want to."

Any other woman would be playing me. Maybe she is. Maybe all females inherit this power to destroy a man with a look. But this woman? She'll be the death of me.

What a glorious way to go.

I'm behind her before the shower door closes. She tests the water temperature, steam already curling around us. I shed my clothes in seconds.

When she turns, water sluices down her curves, between her breasts, over that perfect apex. Her arousal perfumes the steam-thick air.

Her gaze drops to my cock. It jerks in response. Her fingers twitch like she wants to touch. Yes. Please.

Those wide eyes meet mine, asking permission. I nod, my voice beyond trust.

Her first tentative touch is everything. Gentle fingers exploring, learning. A groan rips from my throat. Nothing's ever felt this good. Every nerve ignites under her touch.

When her hand closes around me, my eyes fly open. "Evelyn. Stop." She freezes but doesn't let go.

"Did I hurt you?"

"Opposite. It's too good. My control's hanging by a thread."

A wicked smile curls her lips. "What if I want you to lose control?" Her hand moves again.

Fuck.

###Chapter 0128

"Evelyn." My voice cracks, barely a whisper of warning. And damn if she doesn't take that as encouragement, wrapping her other hand around me completely. My palm slams against the shower tiles for balance.

One last chance. "If you keep going, I'm going to cover you."

My stubborn mate doesn't pause. Her strokes quicken, ruthless. Two more pulls and I'm gone. "GODDAMN IT!" My shout echoes as I spill over her skin, marking her from collarbone to hips. Fisting her hair, I yank her mouth to mine, kissing her hard while she milks every last drop from me.

When I finally release her lips, that smug little smirk of hers makes me growl. "That was interesting," she dares to say.

I look down at the mess I've made of her—my claim glistening on her skin. Something feral surges in my chest. Theron purrs approval in my mind. Ours. Damn right.

Evelyn follows my gaze. I brace for disgust, but my minx shocks me again. She drags a finger through the mess on her chest, brings it to her lips, and—fuck me—licks it clean. Those eyes darken with hunger. "You taste like dark chocolate."

Instant erection.

I pin her against the wall before her finger leaves her mouth. "My turn," I rasp, dropping to my knees.

Smearing my scent across her skin, I nudge her leg over my shoulder and dive in. One long lick from ass to clit has her jerking. I take my time, savoring her flavor, teasing her until she's trembling. When I finally suck her clit between my lips, she screams my name, soaking my chin.

Addicted. That's what I am. To her taste, her scent, the way she falls apart for me. I work her through three more orgasms until she's sobbing, voice raw. Each scream of my name pushes me over the edge again.

By the time I let her go, she's slumped against the tiles, breathless. I kiss my way up her body, inhaling my scent on her skin. At her marking spot, I resist the urge to bite—not yet—and claim her mouth instead. Those dazed eyes? I'll spend my life putting that look on her face.

Tugging her under the spray, I wash her hair with hands that won't stop shaking. Vanilla body wash—the kind I bought her—foams between my palms as I clean every inch. Her gasp when I graze her oversensitive nipples? Perfect.

After toweling her off, I press a kiss to her damp hair. "Bed. Now."

I watch her stumble toward the mattress before finishing my own shower. Tonight, I'll dress my mate for dinner. And later? I'll ruin her all over again.

###Chapter 0129

There's nothing more intoxicating than having a powerful Alpha at your complete mercy. The way Adrian trembled under my touch, surrendering to every stroke—it made me feel like a goddess. And when he took control? Sweet Selene, that man's tongue should be classified as a lethal weapon. I was reduced to a trembling mess, barely able to form coherent thoughts afterward.

His tenderness afterward nearly undid me completely. The way he bathed me with such reverence, ensuring every inch of me was cared for before we headed to the packhouse. It's these moments that make me fall harder for him. He constantly shatters every expectation I've ever had.

I'm still sprawled across the bed when he emerges from the shower, water droplets glistening on his sculpted torso. He leans over me, his damp hair brushing my cheek. "Still with me, little guardian?" His voice is rough with concern.

"Mmhmm," I manage, still dazed. "Just... processing. That was..." Words fail me.

His smirk tells me he understands perfectly. "Need another minute?"

"Maybe half of one."

Adrian chuckles and strides toward my closet, the towel riding dangerously low on his hips. The play of muscles across his back as he rifles through my clothes is downright criminal. I bite my lip hard enough to draw blood. Selene's voice purrs in my mind: Go on. Run your tongue along those ridges. Then maybe find some clothes.

I feel my wolf pressing against my consciousness, urging me forward. With effort, I regain control and meet Adrian's amused gaze. "Excuse me, Alpha. I believe I need clothing for dinner."

His eyes darken. "Indeed you do, little guardian."

Before I can slip past, his fingers tangle in my hair, tilting my head back for a searing kiss that leaves me breathless.



"Get dressed, love." A sharp smack on my backside sends heat flooding through me as he saunters out.

I emerge minutes later in dark jeans and an emerald sweater, knee-high boots completing the look. Adrian's changed into fresh black slacks and a gray Henley that clings to every ridge of muscle. "Ready?" I ask.

His fingers intertwine with mine. "Always."

At the packhouse, he whisks me to his room to change into something more formal. When we enter the dining hall hand-in-hand, the continued chatter is a welcome change from previous awkward silences.

"Let's greet our parents first," Adrian murmurs, thumb stroking my wrist. "Then we'll sit with the pack. Agreed?"

"Perfect."

We approach the high table where my father sits with Alistair and Seraphina. Dad's actually laughing at something the former Alpha says—a sight that warms my chest.

"Hey Dad."

His head snaps up, nostrils flaring as his eyes narrow at Adrian, who merely shrugs. Gregory turns back to me with forced casualness. "Evelyn. Good day?"

The way his jaw twitches tells me he knows exactly what kind of day I've had.

###Chapter 0130

His question carries a hidden edge that makes me suspect he knows about what transpired between Adrian and me. I choose to focus only on the details I'm comfortable sharing.

"My patrol was more challenging than usual, but Selene managed to run for a few hours before Theron called for a break. She was exhausted on our return and has been resting since we got back."

His gaze remains fixed on me, assessing my condition rather than my scent. "How did Selene feel about the run?"

"She adored it. She's been wanting to run with Theron for ages. Even at half-strength, she had an amazing time playing and chasing today."

Before my father can circle back to the scent issue, Adrian smoothly intervenes. "We're heading to grab some food. Just wanted to stop by and say hello." He guides me toward a table with unfamiliar pack families.

The evening proves enjoyable as I meet new members and chat with the younger pups. Their mothers share amusing stories that keep me entertained.

Adrian walks me home later, leaving me with a kiss that lingers. "Get some rest, little guardian. Tomorrow I plan to win our match and stake my claim publicly."

I laugh. "As if your scent covering me isn't declaration enough?"

He simply smiles and turns me toward the door. "Goodnight, love. Sleep well."

Morning finds me preparing for our match. 'How are you feeling, Selene?' I ask, wondering if there's any chance I might actually best Adrian today.

'Recovered, but not at full capacity yet. Maybe another day or two,' she replies.

'Any concerns about sparring with Adrian? Will this set back your healing?'

'Not at all. Though I doubt we can defeat him today - he's a powerful alpha. But we'll give it everything we've got.'

I head downstairs to find warriors already gathering. Approaching Julian, I ask, "So what are the odds on how quickly Adrian will pin me?"

Julian looks uncomfortable. "Well," he hesitates. "Just remember I'm only recording the bets, not endorsing them."

I narrow my eyes. "And I really don't want Selene taking offense with me," he adds quickly. Now I'm genuinely curious - do they really consider Adrian that much stronger?

Sebastian approaches. "For the record, my bet says you'll last the longest."

"How long exactly?" I ask.

"One hour," he says. Respectable, but if that's the longest estimate... I turn back to Julian. "And the other bets?"

He shifts uneasily. I feel Adrian's hands settle on my hips as he joins us. Julian meets my gaze. "Remember, this isn't my bet. I can't participate. But... Sebastian's hour is the longest estimate." Adrian nods in acknowledgment.

"And the shortest?" I press.

"Five minutes."

Adrian scoffs behind me. "Which idiot thought I'd pin Evelyn in five minutes?"

"Reginald," Julian answers.

Reginald the Rotten. Of course. Next time we spar, I'm aiming straight for his family jewels.

My father joins us then, calling us forward. "Evelyn? You sure you're ready for this?" I nod firmly. Let's do this.

###Chapter 0131

Gregory gathers us in the training grounds, warriors forming a tight circle around Evelyn and me. My blood thrums with anticipation. Though I know she won't be at her peak today, my little guardian will make me earn every inch of this victory.

We begin cautiously, testing each other's reflexes with quick jabs and feints. The air crackles between us as we dance around the ring. Within minutes, the intensity builds. Sweat glistens on Evelyn's brow when I finally attempt my signature move—a devastating uppercut.

She anticipates it perfectly.

Ducking beneath my swing, she drives a fist into my sternum that nearly knocks the wind from my lungs. Stars explode behind my eyelids.

"You're holding back, Alpha," she pants, emerald eyes blazing.

"Can't have my girlfriend limping to class," I counter, sweeping toward her legs. She leaps like a damn gazelle, landing a sharp elbow to my shoulder before dancing out of reach.

The match stretches on—a brutal symphony of grappling and strikes. I note the subtle lag in her movements first. Fatigue. Perfect.

I strike like lightning. One moment she's upright, the next I've pinned her beneath me, our bodies flush against the packed earth. My hips cage hers, my knees trapping her thighs as I stretch her arms above her head.

The warriors erupt.

Beneath me, Evelyn's chest heaves. What happens next freezes the entire clearing.

Selene surges forward.

My breath catches as Evelyn bares her throat in complete submission. The training grounds go deathly silent.

Theron doesn't hesitate. He darts forward, nipping gently at the exposed column of her neck before I reclaim control. My lips find hers in a claiming kiss that leaves no doubt—she's mine.

When I pull back, her eyes shine brighter than any emerald. "Mine," I growl.

A wicked grin curls her lips. "Want to know a secret, Alpha?"

I raise a brow.

"I was going to submit either way," she whispers, breath hot against my ear. "I just wanted to fight you."

Laughing, I haul us both upright. Julian calls out the time—seventy-five minutes. A new record.



"Rest of you maggots!" Gregory barks. "Obstacle course in forty-five. Move!"

As the warriors scatter, Gregory claps us both on the shoulders. "Good work. Evelyn, you're done until afternoon training."

I watch her stride toward the packhouse, then pull out my phone. Oberon's voicemail greets me again. I leave another message before heading to breakfast.

The dining hall buzzes with exhausted warriors. Donovan slings an arm around my shoulders. "Nice work claiming your guardian, Alpha." His gaze tracks Genevieve across the room.

"Speaking of which," I smirk, watching him approach her. The ice queen might still play resistant, but I'd bet my title she's thawing.

School passes in a blur of stolen kisses between classes. By Thursday lunch, Evelyn's leaning against my locker. "Dinner tonight?"

A slow smile spreads across my face. Oberon finally returned my call last night. At first he'd been resistant—until I mentioned bringing not one, but two Guardians to his court.

The Fae King's tune changed remarkably fast.

###Chapter 0132

"Actually, yes." I adjusted Evelyn in my lap, breathing in her lavender scent. "I have something important to discuss with everyone tonight. What should I bring?"

Nathaniel groaned dramatically. "I swear I'm turning into a permanent third wheel here."

Donovan had finally gotten Genevieve to stop ignoring him this week. The way she giggled at his terrible jokes made Nathaniel's complaint valid.

I exchanged a glance with Donovan. We'd planned this conversation for later, but the opportunity presented itself now.

"Nathaniel," I said, feeling Evelyn's fingers threading through my hair, sending pleasant shivers down my spine. "Donovan and I need to talk to you about something."

He straightened immediately. "Did I mess up, Alpha?"

"Quite the opposite," Donovan interjected.

"You know our Gamma lineage only produced one daughter?" I asked.

Nathaniel nodded.

"Did you know she found her mate in another pack last weekend?" Donovan dropped the bombshell.

Nathaniel's jaw slackened. "What? Since when?"

"That's not the important part," I continued, making sure I had his full attention. "When I take over as Alpha, I want you as my Gamma."

Evelyn gasped, her wide eyes darting between us. Nathaniel looked like a fish out of water, mouth opening and closing soundlessly.

"Nat?" Evelyn prompted when the silence stretched too long.

He shook his head as if clearing cobwebs. "You're serious?"

Our synchronized nods made his face break into a grin. "Hell yes! I'd be honored, Alpha. You won't regret this."



I arrived at the Sinclair residence with a fresh bouquet - crimson peonies and white lilies this time, symbolizing passion and purity. Who knew floral arrangements could speak volumes?

While Grant and Alistair manned the grill, I helped Evelyn prepare side dishes in the kitchen. When we gathered around the table, I cleared my throat.

"There's something we need to discuss." All conversation ceased.

"I assume Evelyn shared her findings from the Guardian histories?" I directed at Grant, who nodded grimly. "After our conversation last week about Valeria's missing wolf spirit, I contacted King Oberon."

Grant frowned. "Why does that name ring a bell?"

"He's the Fae monarch who provided Evelyn's book," I explained.

Evander leaned forward. "I recognize the name, but can't place why."

"He's invited all four of us to Eldermere," I continued. "He specifically requested to meet both of you." My gaze shifted between Evelyn and Grant. "And he might have answers about your mother's missing Guardian spirit."

Grant's fork clattered against his plate. "Aren't the Fae and werewolves at odds? Is it safe entering their territory?"

Alistair answered before I could. "Our species were allies centuries ago. While I don't know what fractured that alliance, Oberon has always been honorable. He wouldn't extend an invitation if there was danger."

Evelyn turned pleading eyes on her father. "This could finally give us answers about Mom. Don't you want to know what happened to her spirit?"

The prolonged silence stretched before Grant sighed. "More than anything."

Evelyn's fingers found mine under the table. "When do we leave?"

###Chapter 0133

Adrian and Alistair departed earlier than usual last night. They needed to consult Benedict and Donovan since both would be absent from the pack for several days. We decided to leave after morning training, as the journey to Eldermere would take approximately four hours.

The winding mountain roads led us to a desolate area that seemed utterly remote. Our vehicle halted before an iron gate that appeared more suited to a rustic farm than a mystical realm. Adrian turned in his seat. "Wait here."

I observed as he approached the gate. His hand lifted halfway when a towering fae warrior materialized from thin air. Alistair's muscles tensed visibly, his protective instincts flaring at the potential threat to his son. Through the windshield, I saw Adrian conversing with the guard, who then scrutinized our group before accompanying Adrian back to the car.

Grant lowered his window as they approached. The fae guard inclined his head. "I am Sylas, sentinel of King Oberon. Before granting entry to Eldermere, I require proof of your claimed identities."

From the backseat, I heard Grant's voice deepen as Evander surfaced. "Will this suffice, fae sentinel?"

Sylas dipped his head in acknowledgment. "Guardian Evander. Your return honors Eldermere." His gaze shifted to me. "Our king spoke of two Guardians."

Selene surged forward within me. "Your king speaks truth," I declared.

"Guardian Selene." Sylas bowed slightly. "You are the newly awakened. May I know your name?"

"I am Selene, daughter of Valeria and Evander."

A flicker of intense interest crossed his features before vanishing. "You may pass, Guardians." He nodded to Grant and me, then to Alistair and Adrian. "And you as well, Alphas."

Once through the gates, the world transformed before our eyes. My breath caught. The landscape resembled something from ancient storybooks - impossibly vibrant and alive.

"How...?" I stammered, unable to form a coherent question.

"Fae glamour," Alistair explained. "The illusion conceals their true realm from outsiders. What you see now is authentic elvish territory."

"It's breathtaking," I whispered, unable to mask my wonder. Even Selene seemed awestruck.

"The fae possess unparalleled mastery over natural elements," Grant remarked. "Their magic nurtures rather than destroys. Clearly, they flourish under Oberon's rule."

My face remained pressed against the window, drinking in the impossible scenery. Lush vegetation in impossible hues created a living tapestry that should have overwhelmed the senses, yet instead radiated profound comfort. It felt... right. Like returning home after a long absence.

Rounding a bend revealed a crystalline palace whose spires pierced the clouds. At our arrival, another guard escorted us to a grand library that dwarfed any I'd ever seen. Towering bookshelves reached toward the glass ceiling fifteen feet above, bathing the space in perfect, temperature-controlled sunlight that somehow preserved the ancient tomes. The familiar scent of aged leather and parchment mingled with faint traces of aromatic woodsmoke.

King Oberon awaited us inside. "Alphas," he greeted Alistair and Adrian with a nod. "And the Guardians. We haven't been properly introduced. I am King Oberon." His gaze settled on me. "You must be Evelyn."

###Chapter 0134

"Yes, I'm Evelyn Sinclair. Pleasure to meet you, King Oberon." Should I curtsy? Bow? Protocol escapes me. Thankfully, he doesn't seem bothered by my awkwardness.

"May I know your wolf's name, Evelyn Sinclair?"

Selene steps forward. "I am Selene." The king's golden eyes sparkle with recognition. "Named after the Moon Goddess, I presume?"

She dips her head in confirmation. "The honor is mine, Selene. First Guardian born of two Guardians in centuries."

He turns to my father. Evander has already moved closer. "I'm Evander, Grant Sinclair's wolf. Guardian to Alistair and father to Selene."

"A privilege to meet you again, Evander. Guardian of Alistair and sire of Selene."

"Again?" Evander's ears perk up.

"I understand you seek answers. Those require time. First, you must be famished. Join me for luncheon, then we'll begin unraveling your questions." His gaze shifts to Adrian. "I assume your party is staying?"

"Prepared for two nights if needed," Adrian confirms. The king's smile could light up the entire fae realm.

"Excellent. This way."

He leads us through arched corridors to an intimate dining chamber. An obsidian table carved with celestial patterns dominates the space, already set with crystal goblets. King Oberon takes his place at the head.

"Alpha Alistair, Guardian Evander - would you grace my sides?" He indicates the flanking chairs. As Adrian and I move toward seats beside our fathers, rapid footsteps echo down the hallway.

The king sighs as a carbon copy of him - twenty years younger - bursts in.

Adrian spins toward the newcomer. "Finnian!" He sweeps the fae prince into a bear hug, lifting him off the marble floor.

"Alpha Adrian! You haven't aged a day."

Adrian sets him down, scrutinizing the young royal. "Look who's talking. Last time I saw you, you barely reached my elbow." He guides Finnian toward us. "Meet my mate and our family."

Over silver platters of roasted pheasant and honeyed fruits, I learn how Adrian saved Finnian from rogue vampires, earning King Oberon's eternal favor. My fingers tighten around my fork when realization strikes.

"So you used your royal favor... to get me that history book about my parents?"

If my heart wasn't already his, this would've sealed it. He could've demanded fae gold or weapons. Instead, he gifted me the one thing money can't buy - my past.

Adrian's gaze burns into mine. "Seeing you hold that book... I'd trade a thousand favors for that moment." Selene presses against my ribs, radiating approval.

A deliberate cough shatters the moment. I look away, but not before catching Adrian's smirk.

Post-luncheon, we return to the library transformed. While we dined, the fae conjured a research station - holographic displays floating beside leather-bound tomes, quills that never need ink.

King Oberon steeples his fingers as we settle around the knowledge hub.

"First truth: The fae have chronicled Guardian history since your kind's dawn."

Father interrupts. "Then why are we just learning of you now?"

"An excellent question... for another time."

Alistair leans forward. "Does this relate to why werewolves and fae severed ties?"

King Oberon's jeweled rings glitter as he spreads his hands. "Not just related. The very reason."

###Chapter 0135

I'm relieved my father is inquiring about the fractured alliance between the wolves and the fae. My encounters with King Oberon and Prince Finnian have been surprisingly amicable so far. There must be a way to repair this bond, but first, we need to uncover what shattered it in the first place.

Father turns to Gregory. "I'd like to understand what drove our kinds apart. If there's anything I can do as Alpha—or my son as the future Alpha—to restore our alliance, I'm willing to make it happen."

King Oberon studies them both before nodding. "To fully grasp the situation, we must revisit events from nearly a century ago. I had already been king for over fifty years when it happened..."

Evelyn interrupts him abruptly. "You were king a hundred years ago? How old are you?" The moment the words leave her mouth, she flushes with embarrassment. "I'm sorry, it's just—I've never met anyone who's lived that long..." She trails off, wincing at her own bluntness.

Fortunately, King Oberon chuckles. "I am 248 years old."

Evelyn's jaw drops. "Whoa," she whispers.

I can't blame her for being stunned. Even I didn’t realize the fae lived that long. And he fathered a child just eight years ago. Impressive.

He continues, unperturbed. "The first Guardians awakened two centuries ago—Gideon and Valeria. Their awakening came during a time of brutal conflict among the wolves. Your Moon Goddess was furious at the bloodshed that was decimating your Alphas and threatening your species' survival. Back then, only two Alphas were deemed worthy of her blessing."

Father interjects. "Alpha Lucian and Alpha Rhiannon."

King Oberon nods. "Correct. They were the first to receive Guardians. Initially, we didn’t realize these spirits would reincarnate and continue their lineage through the wolf spirit. It wasn’t until the first Guardians died that the fae were tasked with documenting their histories."

"Alphas quickly realized that a Guardian made a pack nearly invincible. Alpha Lucian and Alpha Rhiannon remained undefeated during their reigns, despite countless attacks from rival packs. When the next generation of Guardians awakened, they became highly coveted."

His expression turns thoughtful. "As a young fae, I was assigned to chronicle their lives. I soon learned that a Guardian’s awakening didn’t necessarily mean the Alpha was worthy—it meant the wolf who inherited the spirit was." He inclines his head toward Gregory, acknowledging his selection as a Guardian.

"Once a Guardian awakened in a pack, Alphas refused to let them leave, fearing the loss of power. So, they began forcing their Guardians to mate with them or their heirs."

"That makes sense for female Guardians, but not males," Gregory points out.

I was thinking the same thing.

"Actually, most Guardians are female," King Oberon reveals. "You, Evander, are only the third male Guardian in seven generations."

The revelation leaves us all speechless.

Gregory stammers, "What? Why? How?"

"I can only speculate. Each Guardian possesses unique gifts that set them apart from ordinary wolves. I believe you descend from Gideon’s warrior lineage—the first male Guardian. When his spirit reincarnated, it passed to a she-wolf. Your bloodline, Evander, is renowned for its strength, which may explain why it occasionally manifests in males."

"Your line is also known for its exceptional long-distance mind-linking abilities. I assume you’re aware of this gift?"

Gregory nods. "Yes, Evander has demonstrated those skills."

King Oberon shifts his gaze to Evelyn. "And has Selene inherited them as well?"

Evelyn confirms, "She has. We’re also immune to wolfsbane and less vulnerable to silver."

King Oberon smiles. "That would be from Valeria’s spirit, passed down to Andra. I presume you also have accelerated healing?"

###Chapter 0136

Evelyn and Gregory exchanged stunned glances. "Yes," they answered simultaneously.

"That lineage traces back to Valeria as well."

Oberon rose gracefully, moving toward an ornate bookshelf. His fingers brushed against three ancient tomes before carrying them back to the table. He placed them before Gregory with deliberate care. "These chronicle the first four generations of your wolf spirit's Guardian lineage."

Resuming his seat, the Fae king folded his hands thoughtfully. A shadow crossed his features as he began speaking again. "I met Elowen while documenting the Guardians. She came with her Alpha to share her story." His voice grew heavy. "The moment our eyes met, we both knew. But her Alpha refused to release her from his pack."

"What?" Adrian's father growled, his outrage mirroring my own. Denying a mate bond violated every sacred wolf law.

"Guardians were considered strategic assets," Oberon explained bitterly. "When we planned her escape, he discovered us. Marked her before my very eyes to claim her permanently."

Evelyn gasped, her hand flying to her mating mark. I pulled her against me instantly, feeling her tremble. This story cut too close to our own nightmare.

Oberon paused, perplexed by her reaction. "This happened centuries ago."

"For you," I countered sharply. "Someone recently tried to force the bond on Evelyn."

The king's eyes widened. "And you resisted?"

"Selene fought the venom until Adrian found me," Evelyn whispered.

Oberon nodded slowly. "Elowen was of age when marked. Afterward, her Alpha spread lies that I sought to steal his mate for power. It shattered our alliance." His gaze lifted to Adrian's father. "Not until your pack, Alpha Alistair, has any wolf treated my kind with honor."

"I see no reason we can't rebuild that alliance," Adrian's father declared. "Our Guardians would benefit from having their histories preserved again."

"Absolutely," Gregory agreed. "I want to understand my legacy—and how it affects Evelyn."

"Call me Oberon." The king's posture relaxed slightly. "Finnian could apprentice as your scribe. As for Selene's unique situation..." He exhaled sharply. "We'll discuss this tomorrow. My guards will show you to your chambers."

We opted for private dinners, needing to process everything. Before separating, Adrian's father called a meeting in his room.

So much had changed in a single day. The past wasn't just history—it was alive, breathing, and inextricably tied to our future.

###Chapter 0137

The revelations from today hit me like a tidal wave. We came seeking answers, but all we found were deeper mysteries. And we've barely begun unraveling the threads of my own questions. I still need to know if Oberon has any knowledge about my mother's wolf spirit, Selene, and what he might understand about how I'm also a Guardian.

A knock interrupts my thoughts, followed by his familiar cedar-and-spice scent. I open the door to find Adrian studying me, his storm-gray eyes shadowed with concern. "You alright?"

I step aside, letting him enter before closing the door and pressing into his embrace. His arms tighten around me, anchoring me. "I can't stop thinking about King Oberon. To find your mate only to have them stolen away... And for Elowen—forced into a bond against her will. No matter how strong the connection, that violation would always linger." My throat tightens. "I know that feeling too well, when Victor tried to force the bond on me."

A growl vibrates through his chest as his fingers trace soothing patterns down my spine. I tilt my head up, brushing my lips against his. "Come on. Our fathers are waiting."

We find Gregory emerging from his room just as we reach Alistair's door.

Dinner becomes a strategy session. We all agree—we need to uncover what Oberon knows about my mother's Guardian lineage and the location of the newest Guardian. And Artemis... What does it mean that I'm the first born Guardian?

At dawn, we regroup in the dining hall before returning to the library. The air crackles with tension—we're all desperate for answers about my mother.

Before we begin, I voice the question gnawing at me. "What happened to Elowen?"

Oberon's gaze drifts to the stained-glass windows, his expression crumbling. "Her Alpha treated her as a weapon, not a mate. He used her as a shield in battle—a power-hungry brute who cared nothing for her heart. She died young." A single tear glides down his cheek. "My only solace? Her death destroyed him too."

My chest constricts. "I'm so sorry."

He offers a sad smile. "Your compassion honors her memory. It's what defines all Guardians."

Adrian snorts. "Clearly you've never survived one of Gregory's training sessions. 'Compassionate' isn't the word I'd use."

Oberon observes our group with newfound interest. "In all my centuries, I've never witnessed such unity between Alphas and Guardians. Perhaps there's something extraordinary about you, Alpha Alistair, and you, Alpha Adrian, that prompted the Moon Goddess to bless your pack with three Guardians simultaneously."

His piercing gaze lands on me. "I have theories about why this is happening now. But first—your mother's lineage." He retrieves four ancient tomes from the shelves. "These chronicle Valeria's bloodline across six generations."

The question I've dreaded finally escapes. "Did my birth cause her death? Did ending her Guardian line kill her?"

Gregory whirls toward me. "Evelyn? You believe that?"

Tears choke my reply. Adrian's thumb strokes circles over my knuckles as Oberon places the heavy books before me. Their leather bindings smell of time and secrets. "Read for yourself, child. The truth lies within."

###Chapter 0138

"Six? But you told me mine only had four." Gregory's voice held confusion.

"Correct. I also mentioned your bloodline carries exceptional strength. A power that surpasses even an Alpha's. Valeria's lineage granted the Guardian the might of an Alpha. Thus, her line has reincarnated more frequently than Gideon's."

"How many times?" My father pressed.

"From what I know, Valeria's line spans eleven generations, while yours has only seven."

Oberon turned back to me. "Now, to your question. No, I don't believe your birth erased her Guardian line. I suspect something happened to the wolf carrying it. Either that, or she's exceptionally skilled at hiding. If I had to guess, she fled her pack upon discovering her true nature and has been living among humans ever since."

"Yet despite years of searching—sending my finest trackers—I've found nothing. Once, I thought I caught her scent, but it vanished. Never resurfaced."

He hesitated, then admitted, "I confess, Valeria's line was tied to my mate. I've longed to reconnect with the Guardian who once shared her soul. Believe me, I've exhausted every resource trying to find her. To no avail."

Alistair Grey crossed his arms. "But you think her line still exists because you briefly detected her scent, and no new Guardian has appeared?"

"Yes." Oberon paused. "When she's found, I believe she'll recognize both of you—not just as Guardians, but as her former mate and... possibly as her daughter. Not in past tense, but present. The Guardian spirit endures. And since no Guardian has ever been born from another before, she may very well still see you as her child." His gaze locked onto me.

"Even if she's younger than me?" That would be beyond strange.

"Her human side may be younger. Her Guardian side is ancient. Her wolf will likely recognize Selene as her daughter, not you, Evelyn."

"Why now?" I pressed. "Why am I the first Guardian born in centuries?"

Oberon studied me before answering. "Several theories. First, male Guardians are rare. Your existence required one to mate with another. Second, your Alphas broke tradition by allowing true mates instead of forced bonds. That may have been key. Forced bonds could've prevented Guardian offspring."

He exhaled. "The last possibility... I hope I'm wrong." His eyes darkened. "The Moon Goddess may foresee a need for more than two Guardians. If so, a third means war is coming."

Adrian and Alistair exchanged glances. Neither showed any sign of prior knowledge about impending conflict.

"I'll consult our allies," Alistair said. "Though all three theories could hold truth."

Food arrived as we pored over ancient chronicles. I learned little new about Valeria's spirit—only the packs she'd lived in and battles fought. Oddly, Guardians had fought in simultaneous wars yet never crossed paths.

When my eyes grew heavy, I announced I was retiring. Adrian walked me to my room, kissing me goodnight. That night, my dreams were haunted by visions of my mother's wolf—lost, alone, desperately searching for me and Selene.

###Chapter 0139

After escorting Evelyn to her room, I sought out my father. We shared the same unease about Oberon's warning of impending war. Allies needed to be gathered. Plans needed reviewing. Though two Guardians being fated mates was unprecedented, our violent nature as werewolves made conflict inevitable. The Moon Goddess had foreseen this. She'd prepared us for battle.

At breakfast the next morning, we prepared to depart when Gregory dropped his bombshell. "Oberon has invited me to stay. I've accepted."

Evelyn's fork clattered against her plate. "What? For how long?"

"He wants to document your mother's legacy—Valeria and Evander's story. She deserves to be remembered. Honored."

"As do you," Alistair interjected. I noticed Oberon watching my father closely. Did he expect resistance? After everything, he should know better. My father cherished Gregory like a brother. Evelyn was already family to us.

Alistair turned to Oberon. "If he downplays his own role, contact me. I'll set the record straight." The Fae king nodded.

Gregory wheeled toward Evelyn. "You're practically grown, but Sebastian will check on you." His gaze shifted to me. "And I know Adrian will protect you." I inclined my head. Nothing would harm my mate.

Her voice wavered. "When will you be back?"

"However long it takes. But I'll return for your birthday." He squeezed her hand. "Keep training. Excel in your studies."

"Always, Dad." Their embrace lingered before we gathered our bags. As we thanked Oberon, Alistair reaffirmed our desire to rebuild alliances. This visit had been productive.

Without Gregory's car, we'd run home. Oberon provided an escort to the decrepit gate we'd entered through. Crossing the threshold, glamour reshaped reality—the fence-lined forest reappeared.

We shifted. Selene matched our pace effortlessly during the long journey home. Her strength had fully returned. Our howls announced our arrival as we crossed pack borders, heading straight for the main house.

Alistair vanished immediately—I wouldn't see him or Seraphina until morning. Lunch smells greeted us as we dressed. Evelyn's stomach growled loudly.

"Food first," I said. "Then your place. Unless you'd rather stay here while Gregory's gone?"

She surveyed the bustling pack house. "Home, please. If that's alright."

"I'll stay with you." Her radiant smile drew me in. My hands settled on her waist.

"Is this your sneaky way into my bed, Alpha?"

I kissed her nose. "I respect your choice to wait for your mate. But if you want company on the couch..." With a smirk, I steered her toward the dining hall.

###Chapter 0140

We shared lunch with several pack members at the Blackthorn estate before heading to Evelyn's place. I made sure to grab my textbooks and an overnight bag - I'd practically moved into her home these past weeks.

The following month settled into a comfortable rhythm. We spent most nights at her house, respecting her boundaries while discovering each other's bodies with slow, deliberate exploration. Without the pressure of sex, our intimacy deepened in unexpected ways. Every touch became sacred, every gasp memorized. And let me tell you, Evelyn has particular talents involving chocolate desserts that have nothing to do with baking. The things that woman can do with her tongue should be illegal.

We became inseparable. Morning and evening training sessions continued, now more balanced since Selene had fully recovered. Theron and she sparred as equals, constantly inventing new takedowns that left us both bruised and exhilarated.

Homework sessions turned into strategy meetings when Evelyn started joining my consultations with Father about pack affairs. She slipped into the Luna role effortlessly, though she'd never admit it. Natural leadership radiates from her.

I made sure to plan weekly dates - not for privacy (we had plenty) but to show her the world through my eyes. Fancy restaurants, midnight picnics, even that terrible vampire romance movie she secretly loved.

One evening after pack dinner, we raced home in wolf form. Selene and Theron had grown close, often running together between the Blackthorn lands and the Sinclair house. As we reached the tree line, we shifted back as usual.

The scent hit us simultaneously. My growl started instinctively before I choked it back. We'd agreed to this. Evelyn's birthday approached in weeks, and the choice would be hers. I'd nearly forgotten about him after months without contact.

"Sebastian." Evelyn started forward.

Theron surged forward with a warning snarl, bodily blocking her as I tossed her a shirt. I'd consented to their meetings - not to my mate standing naked before another alpha.

Sebastian rose from the porch swing where he'd been waiting. My scent saturated this property after months of occupation. His jaw tightened as he inhaled it.

When Evelyn moved to follow me, I caught her wrist. "I should go."

Her head shook violently. "Stay."

I cradled her face. "Two alphas wanting the same woman? That's a death match waiting to happen." My thumb brushed her cheekbone as she glanced between us. "Call me later."

I pressed a kiss to her forehead before retreating into the trees. Every instinct screamed to challenge him, to mark her so thoroughly no one would dare look twice. But this wasn't about dominance - it was about trust.

The hardest part of loving someone is letting them choose.

###Chapter 0141

My chest tightens as Adrian turns away, his broad shoulders disappearing into the distance. A piece of my soul seems to walk away with him. I don't move until the last glimpse of him vanishes, then force myself to face the house—and Sebastian.

"Sebastian." His name tastes unfamiliar on my tongue now. That easy grin of his still warms me, but differently. I step into his embrace, breathing in his familiar pine scent.

"So, you and Adrian, huh?" His chuckle holds an edge. "What happened to waiting for me?"

I smack his chest playfully. "Yes, Adrian and I are together. And for the record, he's respected every boundary I've set."

"Boundaries?" His nose wrinkles. "Is that why you reek of him? Your whole house smells like Blackthorn Pack."

"Did you come here to interrogate me?" My fingers curl into fists. He lost the right to question my choices when he disappeared.

"No." He exhales sharply. "I just didn't expect... this. I don't even smell your father here—just you two. It threw me off. I'm sorry. Can we reset?"

I nod, leading him inside. "Hungry? I can whip something up."

"I'm good."

After grabbing two beers, we settle in the living room. The glass bottle sweats in my palm as I ask, "Any luck finding Victor Blackwood?"

Sebastian's fingers flex against my knee. "He's a ghost. My best trackers can't pin him down." He takes a swig. "Where's your father?"

I recount everything—the Fae realm, my parents' wolves, how Grant stayed behind to share Evander and Valeria's story with Oberon.

Sebastian's brows lift. "Your mother's wolf spirit... you think she's hiding in the human world?"

"Oberon believes so." I chew my lip. "But if Valeria knows Selene is her daughter, why stay away for thirteen years?"

His expression darkens. "You think an Alpha's holding her captive? That'd be hard to hide this long."

"She wouldn't abandon me willingly." My voice cracks. "Evander wouldn't have either."

We finish our drinks and I fetch another round, catching up on lost time until Sebastian stands abruptly. "I need to keep searching." His thumb brushes my cheek. "But I'll be here for your birthday. Promise."

When his lips meet mine, it's like kissing a photograph—a memory with no heartbeat. No spark. Just warmth where fire used to live.

He feels the difference too. His smile falters as we walk to the door.

"Don't count me out yet, Evelyn." His knuckles graze my jaw. "Wait until your birthday. I'd be good to you—fated or not."

I hug him tightly. "I'm not deciding anything yet."

From the porch, I watch his car disappear down the gravel drive. My mind agrees to wait. But Selene howls in protest, and my heart? It's already chosen.

The shower scalds my skin as I wash away Sebastian's scent. Adrian will come tonight—he always does since we returned. I won't let another man's smell linger between us.

When I call, he arrives before I can hang up. Theron must have sprinted the whole way. The moment Adrian steps inside, his arms band around me, his nose buried in my damp hair.

"You showered."

I tilt my face up. "I didn't want you uncomfortable."

His stormy eyes search mine, the unspoken question loud between us.

"Nothing happened." I press his palm to my racing heart. "My feelings for Sebastian have changed. He's family now." Step by step, I back toward the stairs, pulling him with me. "But you..."

I place his other hand low on my stomach, where heat pools. "You're everywhere."

His growl vibrates through me as I dart upstairs. He catches me at the bedroom door, and for the rest of the night, I show him exactly how much I crave his particular flavor of dessert.

###Chapter 0142

Grant came back a week before Evelyn's birthday. The timing couldn't have been worse. We'd just shifted back from our run, both completely bare, when we walked into the house. I was holding her against me, her legs locked around my waist as we kissed, already moving toward her bedroom. That's why I didn't sense his presence until it was too late.

"Alpha Adrian, perhaps you could release my daughter long enough for her to greet her father."

Nothing kills the mood faster than hearing your mate's father's voice when you're seconds away from taking his daughter to bed.

Evelyn immediately untangled herself from me. I shifted to shield her from view. "Hi Dad. When did you get back?" She peeked around my shoulder at Grant.

"A few hours ago." His gaze flicked between us as Evelyn edged toward the staircase. "I'll be right back," she called, darting upstairs to dress.

Grant turned his full attention to me. "I thought we agreed you'd respect my daughter's boundaries."

"I have." I wasn't about to justify our relationship to him. What Evelyn and I shared was private—father or not, it wasn't his concern.

"Judging by the scent, you've been living here."

Evelyn returned, handing me a pair of shorts from her room. Yes, I kept clothes here, just as she had things at my place in the packhouse. "Yes, Dad, he has. Is that an issue?" She answered before I could.

"Evelyn, I'm not comfortable with a man sharing your bed when you haven't even confirmed he's your mate."

She nodded once, then looked at me. "Give me five minutes to pack, then we'll go to the packhouse."

Damn. Part of me wanted to cheer for her boldness. The other part cringed at the impending confrontation.

"Excuse me?" Grant's eyebrow arched.

"I respect your choices, Father. But you'll respect mine too. I'm old enough to decide who I sleep with. Adrian and I have grown closer while you were away. I love him. I want to be with him. If that means leaving, so be it. But we're not separating."

I turned to her. "You love me?"



Her lips curved. "Surprised?"

This incredible, breathtaking woman—my mate—had fallen for me before even realizing our bond. I cradled her face. "I'm hopelessly in love with you, Evelyn Sinclair."

We were seconds from kissing when Grant cleared his throat, reminding us he was still there.

Without looking away from Evelyn, I addressed him. "What's it going to be, Grant? Are we staying, or heading to the packhouse?"

He grumbled but finally relented.

After showering, Grant shared stories from his time with Oberon and Finnian. They'd documented his history with Ivy, as well as Evander and Valeria's tale. Reliving those memories clearly brought him both joy and sorrow.

I knew once Evelyn and I mated, we'd move permanently into the packhouse, leaving Grant alone. I hoped he'd adjust—maybe Dad could persuade him to return to pack grounds or take on extra training sessions to stay close to Evelyn.

In the week leading up to her birthday, I stole moments away to arrange her gift. I'd had the idea for weeks but hadn't found time to execute it. Between our constant togetherness, training, school, graduation prep, birthday plans, and my upcoming Alpha ceremony, life had been chaos.

###Chapter 0143

Evelyn has no idea that my Alpha ceremony will double as her Luna ceremony. After her evening with Sebastian, I'm certain she'll choose me. She belongs to me as much as I belong to her. By tomorrow, it'll be official.

The night before her birthday, I tell her I'm staying at the packhouse while she should remain at her father's place. Confusion flickers across her face, but I need her to see me properly for the first time as her mate at the celebration. My excuse about helping Mother prepare isn't entirely false - I want every detail perfect for my mate's special day.

At dawn, I text her birthday wishes. No phone calls - she might recognize our bond through my voice. Her first gift waits by her door.

Mate: Another dress? Really?

Me: This one's for an extraordinary occasion. Do you approve?

Mate: It's stunning. Absolutely perfect.

Me: Counting the hours until tonight.

Mate: Me too. Still think you should've stayed over. We'd know for sure by now.

Me: Having doubts, love?

Mate: None. But certainty would be nice.

Me: Patience. Enjoy breakfast with your father.

Mate: Fine. See you soon.

Me: I love you, Evelyn.

Mate: Love you too, Adrian.

The sand-colored dress will complement her hair perfectly - and match the other surprise I'm bringing tonight. My tailored suit includes a shirt in the exact same shade. After tonight, no one will question we're fated.

Mother and I transform the packhouse. Evelyn chose this venue, having met most pack members recently. Since everyone knows she's my mate, nearly the entire pack is coming. The main hall features a dance floor surrounded by food stations. Outside, we've recreated Celestia's famous twinkling lights - her favorite ambiance.

Flowers overflow every surface, each arrangement containing blooms symbolizing love. Twin bouquets of Lily of the Valley flank the entrance - our tribute to Ivy Sinclair on her daughter's big day.

Guests arrive an hour before Evelyn. The packhouse vibrates with anticipation. Sebastian appears. We exchange tense handshakes before parting ways. Tonight, one of us leaves heartbroken - and it won't be me.

Father's crystal glass chimes for attention. Showtime. Evelyn and Grant have arrived. My pulse skyrockets. Palms dampen. This is the moment I've awaited for months - the start of our life together.

Her vanilla-honey scent floods the hall before she appears, stronger than ever. She must feel it too. Theron surges forward, eager to claim his mate.

When she enters, my certainty crystallizes. Selene stands prominent in her gaze, which locks onto mine. "Mate," she breathes, radiant smile illuminating the room.

"Mate," Theron and I respond in unison before crossing to her. Our kiss ignites like never before - passionate, possessive, perfect.

Official confirmation - she's recognized Adrian as her mate

###Chapter 0144

Without him in her past life, Evelyn's fate would never have spiraled into tragedy. This time, he had been reborn to avenge her.

"Seraphina, is this what you call the truth? You set me up!" Adrian gripped Seraphina's wrist with bruising force.

Today had been nothing short of humiliating.

"It's not what you think—Adrian, please, let me explain!"

Panic flashed in Seraphina's eyes as she tried to cling to him.

Slap!

But Adrian was done being fooled by her lies. His palm struck her cheek with a sharp crack, the sound echoing through the venue.

The reporters below caught every second of it.

A groom slapping his bride at their own wedding?

Tomorrow's headlines would be brutal.

Alistair couldn't stomach another second of this farce. He shot Adrian a withering glare before storming out. As the head of the Grey family, he refused to be associated with such disgrace.

These two were nothing but failures.

With Alistair gone and the reporters closing in, Benedict followed suit, his face burning with secondhand shame.

As for the mess Seraphina and Bianca had created? They could clean it up themselves.

"Mr. Grey, was this entire wedding staged?"

"Mr. Grey, did you target Miss Evelyn to get revenge for Miss Seraphina?"

"Aren't you afraid of Mr. Sebastian retaliating?"

The questions came rapid-fire, microphones shoved aggressively into their faces.

"What a disaster of a wedding," Sebastian mused, feigning regret. He set down his wineglass with a sigh, then flashed a dazzling smile.

"I agree!" Evelyn beamed, matching his grin.

"All thanks to you, Evelyn. You're terrifying—I'll have to keep an eye on you from now on."

Despite his words, Sebastian reached out, brushing his thumb affectionately over her nose.

He adored her cunning, the way she played the victim so flawlessly. Only a woman like her was worthy of him.

"Sebastian, I'm exhausted. Can we go home?"

Evelyn suddenly looked bored, tugging at his sleeve with a pout.

Seraphina had been publicly humiliated. The show was over.

There was nothing left worth staying for.

"Of course."

Sebastian's smile softened, warmth flooding his chest.

Ignoring the stunned stares around them, he swept Evelyn into his arms.

In this chaos, they had no reason to linger.

"Let's go home," he murmured, lips brushing the shell of her ear.

His breath against her skin sent a shiver down her spine, her cheeks flushing crimson.

She looked like a ripe apple—tempting, irresistible.

And he was starving.

Evelyn's pulse quickened as his words sank in.

Sure enough, the moment they were alone, she discovered just how skilled her man truly was.

###Chapter 0145

Words fail me. He's been endlessly patient. Willing to wait. To accept me as his chosen. But my heart belongs only to Adrian.

Sebastian turns. I slip from Adrian's embrace, closing the distance between us. "I—"

He stops me with a look. "Don't. You never lied to me. I knew you needed to find your mate. The risk was mine to take."

His gaze shifts to Adrian over my shoulder before returning to me. "You always wanted your fated one. Adrian is worthy. He'll be a good Alpha. A good mate." His eyes flick back to Adrian. "And if he fails you—you know where I am."

Calloused thumbs brush away my tears. Then he produces a velvet box from his pocket. "Happy birthday."

My hands shake as I unwrap it. Inside rests an exquisite silver locket, vines twisting across its surface, cradling a flawless emerald at its center. "It's stunning."

"Open it," he murmurs.

The left side holds a photograph of my parents—young, radiant, their love palpable. An image I've never seen. On the right, my mother cradles infant me while my father embraces us both.

"How—?" My voice breaks. These fragments of my past, lost to time...

"Dorian helped track them down." Sebastian presses his lips to my forehead. "I'll be away for a while. Take care, Evelyn."

He steps back as Adrian moves forward, his arms encircling my waist. Together we watch Sebastian's taillights vanish into the night.

"You alright?" Adrian turns me gently.

"Yes." My fingers clutch the locket. "There was never really a choice." I meet his glacier-blue gaze. "It's always been you."

His smile warms me as he retrieves a small box. "My turn."

I tuck the locket away. Adrian pockets it for safekeeping before I accept his gift. Nestled in satin lies a sapphire pendant—a heart crowned with diamonds, suspended from a silver chain.

"Theron and I wanted you and Selene to know you hold our hearts." His thumb traces the gem. "The stone matches my eyes when he surfaces. The heart... well."

Selene surges forward. "We love you," we say in unison.

Adrian's voice deepens with Theron's resonance. "More than anything in this world."

"Put it on me?" I turn, lifting my hair. His fingers brush my nape as he fastens the clasp. Then his lips find my neck, trailing fire until they graze my mating mark. I gasp.

"Soon," he vows against my skin. "Forever. But first—" He nips my earlobe. "We've a celebration to attend. And a mate to honor."

###Chapter 0146

The celebration was absolutely breathtaking. Evelyn had been glowing all evening. I couldn't keep my hands off her, and she responded to every touch with equal hunger. When the first unmated male attempted to give her a birthday embrace, Theron's vicious snarl sent a clear message. No one dared approach her after that.

We feasted, drank, and danced until the stars faded. Saying our goodbyes, we retreated to my chambers. I'd prepared the space meticulously—fresh roses adorned every surface, and the flickering candlelight cast a warm, intimate glow.

Turning to face my breathtaking mate, I found her eyes overflowing with devotion. She stepped into my embrace without hesitation, her arms encircling my waist.

"Are you ready to claim me, Alpha?" she whispered, tilting her face up to mine.

"I've been ready since the moment I saw you, little guardian," I growled. My lips traced a burning path down her jaw to the curve of her neck—to where my mark would soon brand her as mine.

Her soft moan filled the air as I lavished attention on that sensitive spot. The intoxicating scent of her arousal wrapped around us, blending with her natural vanilla-honey fragrance.

With impatient hands, I stripped away her dress. The sight that greeted me made my blood roar.

"What the hell is this?" My voice came out rougher than intended. Though I'd seen her naked countless times, this...this was designed for torture. The nude lace lingerie left nothing to imagination, the sheer fabric teasing more than it concealed.

A possessive growl tore from my throat as she slowly turned, revealing the scandalous thong. My palms molded to her curves, squeezing the supple flesh of her backside. When she pressed against me, I made quick work of her bra, letting it pool at our feet.

Lifting her effortlessly, I carried her to the bed, her legs locked around my waist. Our mouths fused in a searing kiss as I lowered her onto the sheets. My tongue plundered hers, tasting the sweetness I craved.

Moving between her thighs, I worshipped every inch of her. My teeth grazed her marking spot, drawing another breathy moan. Though my canines ached to claim her, I held back—tonight was about pleasure, not possession. That would come later.

I descended to her breasts, teasing each peak until her whimpers filled the room. Her fingers tangled in my hair, urging me closer as she arched into my mouth.

Continuing my exploration, I trailed kisses down her stomach until her intoxicating scent overwhelmed me. The delicate lace was already soaked through. When she instinctively tried to close her legs, I nipped her inner thigh—the gasp she made sent fire through my veins.

Ripping away the last barrier with my teeth, I finally tasted her. Her leg draped over my shoulder as I feasted, drinking in every drop. The sounds she made were my personal symphony.

Locking eyes with her as I reached her most sensitive spot, I smirked before delivering a slow, deliberate lick. Watching her eyes roll back as she ground against my face was the most beautiful sight I'd ever seen.

###Chapter 0147

I take what's given without hesitation. My hands slide beneath her, gripping each perfect curve as I claim her with my mouth. The taste of her is intoxicating—sweeter than I remembered, and I hadn't thought that possible. Her scent, her sounds, the way her body responds to me—this is everything I've ever wanted. And now, she's mine.

I feel her body tensing, seeking release. My fingers slip inside her, stretching her carefully. For weeks, I've prepared her for this moment, making sure tonight wouldn't be too painful. As I curl my fingers, my tongue doesn't relent, and she whimpers my name in that breathless way I know too well.

She's close.

I add another finger, dragging them slowly as I suck hard on her clit. Her back arches, her thighs trembling around me. Then she shatters, crying out as her body clenches around my fingers.

I ease her down, slowing my movements as aftershocks ripple through her. When she's still, I move up her body, lifting one leg over my hip. Our lips meet, and I let her taste herself on my tongue.

Pulling back, I press my forehead to hers. "Ready to be mine forever, love?"

Her answer is immediate. "Yes, Adrian. Make me yours, and I'll make you mine."

I position myself at her entrance, kissing her deeply as I push inside in one smooth thrust. Her nails dig into my back, sharp claws pricking my skin as she gasps. I still, letting her adjust. "Breathe, Evelyn. It'll pass. I love you."

I kiss the tears at the corners of her eyes, nuzzling her nose with mine.

"I love you too," she whispers.

I grit my teeth, fighting the urge to move. She feels like heaven wrapped around me, but I wait until she shifts beneath me, signaling she's ready.

Then I begin to move—slow at first, letting her body accept me. Her moans grow louder, her claws dragging down my back in pleasure now, not pain. I speed up, driving deeper, losing myself in her.

Just as she teeters on the edge, I whisper against her ear, "Let me mark you."

She tilts her head, baring her throat. The moment her walls tighten around me, my fangs descend, sinking into her marking spot.

She screams my name as she comes.

The bond snaps into place—a surge of power unlike anything I've ever known. I start to pull back, but then her fangs pierce my skin.

Ecstasy explodes through me. Her venom floods my veins, and I lose control, spilling into her as my body convulses. Nothing has ever felt this good.

When the world stops spinning, I lick the wound on her neck, sealing it. She does the same for me. We're both panting, still joined, when I cup her face.

"You're mine, Evelyn Sinclair. Forever."

###Chapter 0148

Six months have flown by since Evelyn's birthday celebration. So much has changed in this short time. A month after her special day, we graduated high school, and just a week later, the Alpha ceremony took place.

The ceremony was monumental—not just for me, but for our entire pack. We welcomed a fresh wave of ranked wolves into their new roles. Evelyn pledged her oath as Luna, Donovan as my Beta. Genevieve was officially instated as our Beta female—yes, my best friend finally claimed his mate. Nathaniel took his place as Gamma, while our lead warrior respectfully stepped down alongside my father, making room for Sebastian.

Adjusting to these roles hasn’t been easy, but we’ve adapted well. The weight of responsibility is heavy, yet we function seamlessly as a unit.

Gregory has been spending more time at the packhouse lately, training our seasoned warriors while Sebastian handles the younger ones who’ve just come into their wolves.

Right now, I’m seated in what used to be my father’s office—now mine. The call from Dr. Whitmore about Genevieve’s pregnancy came a few days ago, so I wasn’t surprised when she asked me to give Donovan the night off. The grin on his face these past few days hasn’t gone unnoticed. He’s practically bursting with pride, announcing to anyone who’ll listen that he’s going to be a father.

Watching him with Genevieve is endearing. As mates, they’ve always been affectionate, but now his hands constantly drift to her stomach, as if reassuring their little one of his presence.

I won’t lie—I’ve felt a pang of envy. Not that Evelyn and I have been actively trying. Quite the opposite, actually. With everything on our plates, bringing a pup into the world didn’t seem like the right time.

And yet, I’d be lying if I said I haven’t cherished having my little Guardian all to myself. Every night, she has my undivided attention. That euphoria from our first time hasn’t faded—if anything, our bond has only deepened. Evelyn is my addiction, and I’m more than happy to indulge. Though, I must admit, my mate has developed an insatiable craving for a very specific kind of dessert.

Maybe it’s time to reconsider. The thought of Evelyn’s belly swelling with our child sends a rush of emotions through me. And the idea of putting in extra effort to ensure my seed takes root? Well, let’s just say it’s having a very noticeable effect.

At that exact moment, my little Guardian’s voice slips into my mind. "Adrian? I’m hungry." Her tone is downright petulant.

That’s unusual. "Did you skip lunch, love? Do you need me to bring you something?"

"I’m hungry for dessert. And not the kind your mother bakes." Then she floods our link with an image of exactly what she wants—and how she plans to satisfy that hunger.

I’m out of my chair and halfway to the door before my brain catches up. Maybe baby-making starts tonight.

Taking the stairs two at a time, I burst into our room, startling my Luna. She’s standing by her desk—the one we added after she officially moved in. When she turns, her eyes are dark with hunger, but I don’t give her a chance to speak.

In one motion, I scoop her up and pin her against the wall, tearing her dress in my haste.

"I liked that dress, Alpha," she breathes.

"I’ll buy you ten more," I growl before slamming into her.

No matter how many times I have this woman, no matter how often I touch or taste her—it’s never enough. Even during her heat, when I thought I’d wear myself out, I still craved more.

I take her hard against the wall before carrying her to the bed, where I claim her again—slower this time, pouring every ounce of love into each movement. Afterward, she curls against my chest, my arm wrapped securely around her. This is where I’m meant to be.

"I have something to show you, Adrian." She looks up at me, and I feel Selene pushing forward.

I kiss her nose. Whatever this is, it’s important enough for her wolf to be present. Theron surges forward in response.

"What is it, love?"

She slips off the bed and retrieves a paper from her desk before settling back against me. I prop myself up slightly to read it, keeping her tucked close.

"You went to the doctor? Are you okay?" Concern laces my voice.

"Just read it, Alpha." Her smile is radiant.

I scan the page, searching for the reason she visited the pack hospital without telling me. Then I see it.

Test Results:
Positive: Pregnant

The words register instantly. In a flash, I flip us over, pressing my face to her stomach. Theron is right there with me, as if our mere desire has willed this little one into existence.

I inhale deeply, searching for the scent. Evelyn giggles. "Dr. Whitmore said you won’t be able to smell our pup for another week."

Maybe for a normal wolf. But I’m mated to a Guardian, and since completing our bond, every sense has sharpened beyond even an Alpha’s capabilities. Theron is frantic, nuzzling her flat stomach as if our child might answer.

Then—there. The faintest shift in Evelyn’s honeyed scent. Theron presses harder, zeroing in on that spot.

"Found you, peanut," I murmur against her skin. "And now that I have, I’m never letting you go."

###Chapter 0149

Two years have passed since Adrian and I became Alpha and Luna of Blackthorn Pack.

We discovered my mother's wolf spirit. Or more accurately, she found us. Selene and I formed an unbreakable bond. But nothing compares to the joy of welcoming our daughter into this world. We named her Ivy after her grandmother - a fierce and loving Guardian.

Adrian never lets me forget he knew we'd have a girl from the start. Though he dreams of a son to inherit the pack someday, he's terrified of what another pregnancy might do to me.

My pregnancy with Ivy was brutal. War raged around us, and the stress nearly cost us both our lives during childbirth. But Adrian never left my side, and we pulled through.

Ivy is her father's entire world. He carries her everywhere, even now at two years old. She's definitely a daddy's girl - from birth, she'd only settle in his arms unless she was nursing.

Genevieve and Donovan's little boy adores his father just as much. Watching our mates take the kids for ice cream or playdates warms my heart. They've grown into wonderful fathers.

I was stunned when Genevieve finally accepted Donovan. But when she turned twenty-one a month after me and recognized him as her mate, everything clicked. Like Adrian, Donovan knew first and pursued her relentlessly until her birthday. They welcomed their second child, a girl, recently.

Adrian's trauma from nearly losing me has made him refuse to try for another baby. Selene and I were ready months after Ivy's birth, but he wouldn't hear of it. The thought of losing me - or worse, both me and our child - paralyzes him. But the Moon Goddess has her own plans about such things.

I step out of the shower, wrapping myself in a robe instead of getting dressed. Anticipation thrums through me as I prepare to tell Adrian we're expecting again. I hope he'll be as excited as he was with Ivy, ready to go "pebble hunting" again. That's what I started calling it after he nicknamed Ivy "Pebble" during my first pregnancy. Every night, he and Theron would sniff my belly before resting their heads against it, whispering about their day.

Towel-drying my hair, I exit the bathroom just as Adrian walks in carrying Ivy. His eyes darken instantly at the sight of me in just a robe. My love for this man only deepens with time.

"Mommy! Guess what?" Ivy wriggles until Adrian sets her down. She barrels toward me, and I scoop her up. "What, sweetheart?" I carry her to the window seat in our bedroom.

"Theron gave me a ride! Then Daddy showed me all the stellations!" She mispronounces constellations with adorable confidence.

"Did he now?" I feign excitement, shooting Adrian a look. He grins unrepentantly.

Turning back to Ivy, I ask, "Did you fall off this time?"

"Nope! Held on tight like Daddy said."

"Did he show you the Dolphin constellation?"

She nods vigorously. "Uh-huh! He showed the nose and tail and..." She glances at Adrian for help.

"Dorsal fin," he supplies, sitting to remove his shoes.

"Yes! That, Mommy."

"Daddy's very smart, isn't he?"

She nods emphatically.

"Want to know a secret?" I whisper.

Her eyes widen. "What?"

"Mommy knows something Daddy doesn't. If I tell you, you'll know too. Want to hear?"

At her eager nod, I whisper, "Tell Daddy it's time to go pebble hunting."

She pulls back, forehead wrinkling. "Why would Daddy want to hunt pebbles?"

So much for the surprise. Adrian's head snaps up, and now it's my turn to grin.

Keeping my eyes locked with his, I tell Ivy, "Because it'll make Daddy very happy."

Adrian's face lights up with that heart-stopping smile I adore.

Ivy suddenly pats my stomach. "Daddy would be happier if you told him my baby brother's in your tummy."

My head whips toward her. "What did you say?"

She taps my right side. "Daddy, wouldn't you like knowing Mommy's growing my brother instead of hunting pebbles?"

Adrian joins us on the window seat, settling Ivy in his lap. "Princess, why do you think Mommy has your brother in her tummy?"

"I can smell him. Don't you?"

"What does he smell like?" I ask, stunned.

"Like cocoa!"

Adrian and I exchange glances over her head. He transfers her to my left side and points where she'd touched my stomach. "Here?" Theron pushes forward in his curiosity.

Ivy guides his finger to the spot. Adrian leans down, sniffing in careful circles before pressing his nose exactly where she indicated. When he lifts his head, shock colors his features.

"She's right. I smell him too. Just like hot cocoa."

"Told you, Daddy."

I stare at Adrian. "Her sense is stronger than yours? Without even having her wolf yet?" My voice trembles. "What does this mean?"

He lifts Ivy, cradling her face. She cups his cheeks with tiny hands. His golden eyes meet mine over her head. "It means we've been blessed with another Guardian."

###Chapter 0150

"Sebastian!"

I was almost to my car, almost free from witnessing her choose him over me.

It had been a gamble. I knew Evelyn longed to find her fated mate. The odds grew slimmer when I realized Adrian was that man. But I had to try. She's extraordinary. She'll be a remarkable Luna. Just not mine.

I stop. I can't leave like this. She needs to know we can still be friends. Just not now. Not yet.

I turn back. Even in the dim light, her glistening tears are unmistakable. She just found her mate, yet here she stands, worrying about me. Of course she is. That's Evelyn—one of countless reasons I wanted her.

"I'm sor—"

I cut her off. "Don't." My voice is steady. "You were always honest with me. I knew you wanted this. I took the risk willingly."

My gaze lifts to Adrian. He's giving us space. More than I'd manage in his place.

Hands on her shoulders, I speak firmly. "You dreamed of finding your fated mate. Adrian is a good man. He'll lead well and love you right." My eyes flick to him, then back. "And if he doesn't—you know where to find me."

A shaky breath escapes her as she fights more tears. I brush them away with my thumbs before retrieving the small velvet box from my pocket. Hunting down those photos had taken weeks.

"Happy birthday."

The locket glimmers in her palm as she opens it. Her gasp is sharp when she sees the images—her parents radiant before her birth, then cradling her as an infant.

Her fingers fly to her lips. "Sebastian..."

I press a kiss to her forehead. "I need to leave for a while. Take care of yourself."

Adrian steps forward, arm circling her waist as he examines the gift. Surprise flickers across his face. "Thank you. This means everything to her. To us."

A nod is all I offer before turning away. The engine roars to life. In the rearview, they remain entwined, but I don't look back.

Now that my Luna is lost to me, there's only one mission left: hunting down Victor Blackwood. The Banished Beta will pay for my mother's blood.


###Chapter 0151
Thirteen Years Ago

Today's the day! My tenth birthday, and the moment I've been dreaming about since I could remember. The day my wolf spirit awakens.

I'm practically vibrating with excitement at the breakfast table. Mom made my favorite - cinnamon french toast with maple syrup. The sweet scent mixes with my anticipation.

"Seraphina, sweetheart, breathe," Mom says with an amused smile. Her dark brown eyes crinkle at the corners. "Valeria will come when she's ready. Every wolf wakes at their own time."

"But what if she doesn't like me?" I blurt out, syrup dripping from my fork.

Dad's booming laugh fills the kitchen as he enters. At 6'5", he towers over everyone. His calloused hand ruffles my hair. "Who wouldn't adore my little firecracker?"

I stick my tongue out at him. At barely five feet, I hate when he calls me short. Mom's 5'10", so I'm holding out hope for a growth spurt.

Dad steals a piece of toast from my plate. "So what's the birthday agenda?"

Mom swats his hand away. "We're getting camping gear this morning. Next weekend, we'll test Seraphina's new wolf senses in the woods." She winks at me. "Then pizza dinner, presents at six, and shifting at seven."

The mention of shifting makes my stomach flutter. What if I'm one of those rare cases who never gets a wolf?

After Dad leaves for training, Mom and I hit the outdoor store. Colorado winters are brutal, even for werewolves. We load up on thermal sleeping bags and insulated tents.

By afternoon, we're baking cookies when panic sets in. Still no wolf. What if the Moon Goddess rejects me? What if-

'What if you stop overthinking?'

I freeze. That voice...it wasn't Mom's.

Mom's eyes gleam amber as her wolf Aurora surfaces. "Well? What's her name?"

The presence in my mind feels like sunlight warming my skin. 'Relax, little one. Let me forward.'

When I do, my voice changes. "I am Valeria."

Mom's face pales. She stumbles back like she's seen a ghost. "N-nice to meet you, Valeria." Her smile doesn't reach her eyes. "Excuse me, I need...air."

She flees to the living room, leaving me with a dozen questions and my new best friend.

'Why did Mom react like that?' I ask Valeria.

Her presence pulses with warmth. 'I don't know, Seraphina. But we'll figure it out together.'

The cookie timer beeps, but all I can think about is Mom's strange reaction and the secrets it might reveal.

###Chapter 0152

Mom returns to the kitchen with news that dad's coming home early. Barely twenty minutes pass before the front door swings open. "There's my birthday girl," Dad says, though tension lines his face.

"So you've got your wolf? Valeria, is it?"

"Yes! She's amazing, Dad!" I throw my arms around him.

Theron, my father's wolf spirit, nudges forward. "Introduce me to my pup, little one."

Valeria emerges effortlessly this time, the transition smooth. Dad's eyes widen before he crushes us in a bear hug. I cling to him, thrilled he's home early for my celebration.

When we separate, Dad exchanges a loaded look with Mom. "Alpha Vincent wants to meet our newest pack member tomorrow," he says. Their silent conversation stretches uncomfortably long.

"But!" Dad's sudden grin breaks the tension. "I've got a better idea. Let's take that new camping gear and find somewhere spectacular for your first shift. Sleeping under the stars - Valeria would love that."

I turn pleading eyes to Mom. "Please? Can we?"

Their silent communication continues. "They're mind-linking," Valeria observes. "Hiding something from us."

Mom finally nods. "Dinner first. Pack clothes while I prepare food."

"This is going to be epic!"

Nightfall finds us still driving. "Rest, sweetheart," Dad suggests. "First shifts take time and hurt like hell. We'll wake you when we find the perfect spot." Though buzzing with excitement, I doze off in the backseat.

Parental whispers rouse me. "Breaking the pack link will alert him immediately," Mom frets. "Shouldn't we wait until we're farther? They can still track us this close."

"Best time is just before dawn when he's deepest asleep," Dad counters. "With luck, he won't notice until afternoon. By then we'll have ditched the car for the Sierra Madre foothills."

"But her stamina-"

"Theron can carry her for hours if needed."

I bolt upright. "Where are we? Why are we still driving?" When they exchange guilty glances, anger flares. "This was supposed to be my special day! What's really happening?"

Mom meets my gaze. "We had to leave the pack, Seraphina. It was necessary."

"Leave? You mean... permanently?"

"Valeria?" Dad interjects. "Do you understand what you are?"

"A Guardian," she replies calmly.

"Wait - Guardian?" My voice rises. "Explain!"

Mom answers. "Valeria's golden eyes mark her as a Guardian. No ordinary wolf spirit has that glow."

"Why does that mean we have to flee?"

Dad keeps his eyes on the dark road. "You'll become more powerful than any Alpha, little star. Vincent would've forced you to mate his heir to keep that power within his pack. Guardians never leave their birth packs willingly - they're either mated to the Alpha or their successor."

"Every recorded case except one," Mom adds. "And that Guardian was male, already friends with his Alpha. We won't let them chain you to someone before you've even met your true mate."

"So what now?"

"We'll stop soon," Mom says. "After your first shift, we'll renounce the pack bonds and run for the mountains as rogues."

"Rogues?" My stomach plummets. "You mean-"

"We're leaving everything behind," Dad confirms.

###Chapter 0153

Six months ago

The tires screech as I peel away from Evelyn's birthday celebration. My fingers dial Nathaniel before the engine even settles into a steady hum.

"Alpha?" His voice cracks with anticipation. The entire Blackthorn Pack had been holding their breath, praying Evelyn would pick me.

"Clear out my suite. I'm staying at the penthouse tonight." The words taste like ash. I'd spent weeks preparing that room - rose petals strewn across silk sheets, black candles scenting the air with sandalwood. All for nothing.

Nathaniel's exhale crackles through the speaker. "What's our next move?"

"Victor Blackwood. My apartment at dawn." Eighteen years. That's how long I've waited to avenge my mother. Lucian Blackwood's rogue Beta had slit her throat before vanishing into the night. My father hunted him until his dying breath. Now the bastard's resurfaced, trying to claim Evelyn as his mate last month.

The leather steering wheel groans under my grip. That failed kidnapping only made me hungrier for his blood.

"Should I come keep you company?"

"Just leave the bourbon in my office."

The city skyline swallows my car whole. Blackstone Enterprises towers over the financial district - my dual empire of construction and private security. Nearly eight hundred shifters depend on these human-fronted businesses.

The elevator dings open directly into my private bar. The bartender doesn't speak, just slides over a tumbler of 18-year-old Pappy Van Winkle. I drain it in one swallow and shove the glass back. "Bottle. Now."

Memories flicker like bad film reel. Evelyn's laugh. The way her Guardian strength could pin me during sparring matches. That damn birthday cake with candles I'll never blow out with her.

Then - jasmine and night-blooming cereus. A woman materializes beside me in a dress that should be illegal. Ebony hair cascades over golden shoulders. The cheetah-print fabric clings to every dangerous curve.

Her crimson nails tap the mahogany bar. "Buy a girl a drink?"

I scowl, nostrils flaring. She laughs - a velvet purr - and leans in. Her cheek brushes mine as she whispers two words that make my wolf snap to attention:

"Panther shifter."
The tension in the room was palpable as Adrian's grip tightened around Evelyn's waist. His golden eyes burned with barely contained fury, reflecting the flickering candlelight of the underground chamber.

Selene growled low in Evelyn's mind, her hackles rising at the sight of the Fae prince's smug expression. Finnian lounged carelessly against the stone wall, twirling a silver dagger between his fingers.

"You dare threaten my mate?" Adrian's voice dropped to a dangerous whisper that sent shivers down Evelyn's spine. The air crackled with the energy of his barely restrained shift.

Finnian merely smirked, his emerald eyes glinting with mischief. "I merely offered the Guardian a choice, Alpha. Surely even you can't deny the benefits of an alliance with the Fae court."

Evelyn felt the weight of Oberon's ancient gaze upon her. The Fae king sat motionless on his obsidian throne, his expression unreadable. The silence stretched between them, broken only by the distant drip of water echoing through the cavernous hall.

"Enough." Evelyn's voice cut through the tension like a blade. She stepped forward, placing herself between Adrian and the Fae royalty. "I won't be bargaining chip in your political games."

Finnian's smirk faltered for the first time. Oberon's fingers twitched against the armrests of his throne.

Adrian moved like lightning, positioning himself at Evelyn's back in a protective stance. His warmth seeped through her clothes as his fingers brushed against hers in silent reassurance.

Selene surged forward in Evelyn's consciousness, lending her strength. "We don't need your magic," Evelyn declared, lifting her chin. "The Guardian bloodline has survived without Fae interference for centuries."

A slow, chilling smile spread across Oberon's face. "Brave words, little wolf." His voice slithered through the chamber, raising the hairs on Evelyn's arms. "But every Guardian before you has eventually bowed to necessity."

The ground beneath them trembled suddenly. Cracks spiderwebbed across the stone floor as an unearthly howl echoed through the caverns.

Adrian's arms encircled Evelyn as the walls began to shake. "What the hell was that?" he growled.

Finnian's face drained of color. "Father..."

Oberon rose from his throne, his regal composure shattered. "They've found us."

Before Evelyn could demand answers, the chamber's far wall exploded inward in a shower of rubble and dust. Through the gaping hole, dozens of glowing red eyes stared back at them.

Evelyn's blood turned to ice.

Vampires.
###Chapter 0154

She leans back with a smirk, swirling her drink before catching the bartender's eye. A subtle tilt of her glass is all it takes. The bartender nods, already reaching for the bottle.

Her gaze slides back to me, sharp and knowing. "That's what you were thinking, isn't it, Alpha?"

I brace my forearm against the bar, closing the space between us. "A creature like you doesn't belong in a place like this."

The bartender sets down her refill. She drags her tongue along the straw, slow, deliberate. "Business trip. Just for the weekend."

"Name?" My fingers trace the edge of her dress, skimming bare skin.

"Isolde." Her lips curve. "And you, gorgeous?"

"Sebastian." I tilt my head toward the elevators. "My suite's upstairs."

That feline smile widens. "One more for the road."

I signal the bartender. "Another bottle. Add it to my tab."

The moment the bottle lands in my grip, I’m steering her away, one hand possessive on the small of her back. The elevator doors close, and I swipe my keycard before shoving her against the wall. My mouth crashes into hers, my fingers sliding higher, higher—until I find exactly what I expected.

Nothing beneath that dress.

A growl rumbles in my chest as I stroke her, relishing the way her breath hitches. Her fingers tangle in my hair, yanking hard. Perfect. She wants it rough.

The elevator dings. I let her go just long enough to watch her stride into my suite, hips swaying. Prey, taunting the predator.

I drop the bottles on the table as she turns. Her amber eyes burn with the same hunger coiled tight in my gut. Too long. Months of celibacy, playing the noble Alpha for Evelyn. All that restraint—gone tonight.

She grins, stepping backward, setting her glass aside. A challenge.

I prowl forward. "Here, kitty." My voice is pure gravel.

She spins to run. One step. That’s all she gets before I slam her into the wall. Her chest heaves as I rip her dress clean down the middle. Fabric pools at her feet.

"Hope that wasn’t sentimental," I mutter.

Her nails rake down my chest, shredding my shirt. "Loved that dress."

"Gentle isn’t on the menu." My claws pierce her waist as I lift her.

She purrs, legs locking around me. "Who said I wanted gentle, puppy?"

I bare my teeth. "It’s Alpha." Then I bury my face between her thighs.

She screams my name three times before I let her breathe.

I don’t give her time to recover. Spinning her around, I fist her hair, pinning her to the wall as I kick my pants aside. One sharp jerk parts her legs.

"Hands on the wall."

The second she obeys, I’m inside her.

No mercy. No thought. Just the brutal snap of my hips, the scrape of her claws gouging the wallpaper. None of it matters—not the losses, not the future, not the fucking loneliness. Only this. Only her.

When she chants "Alpha" like a prayer, I let go.


###Chapter 0155

The morning light barely touches my eyelids when I wake. My body thrums with energy despite the minimal sleep. That panther shifter has stamina like nothing I've ever encountered.

Isolde lies sprawled naked beside me, her golden skin a canvas of fading claw marks and love bites. The handprint on her ass has lightened overnight but remains visible. My own body tells a similar story - teeth marks and scratches in various stages of healing.

I press my lips to her shoulder. She stirs with a throaty moan. "Again? Are all Alphas this insatiable?"

A dark chuckle escapes me as my palm connects sharply with her backside. The fresh red mark makes her hiss, but she arches toward me instead of away. Taking the invitation, I sink my teeth into the same spot. Her moan vibrates against my lips, her arousal perfuming the air.

"Naughty kitten. Shower with me if you want more. I've got meetings this morning." Her groan follows me into the bathroom.

The hot water barely has time to soak my skin when I feel her behind me. Her hands find me already half-hard from our earlier play. When she strokes me to full attention, I turn and watch those feline eyes darken with hunger.

"Starved, little panther?"

She nods, licking her lips as I drag my tip across them. That tongue - rough like a cat's - nearly undoes me after last night's activities. Then she takes me deep, proving feline shifters have particular talents. When I finish down her throat, I haul her up and take her against the shower wall.

Afterward, I leave her to finish washing while I dress. A knock interrupts my buttoning. Expecting room service, I open the door to Nathaniel's shocked face.

"What the actual fuck?" His gaze rakes over my marked skin. He takes two steps inside before freezing. "Jesus Christ. What happened here? And that smell..."

"Panther," Isolde purrs, emerging with only a towel wrapped around her hair. Water droplets slide down her bare shoulders.

Nathaniel's jaw drops. Can't blame him - even after last night, the sight of her steals my breath. Every curve is perfection.

"Nathaniel, Isolde. Isolde, Nathaniel."

"Hey," they say in unison before she pins me with a look. "My clothes are shredded thanks to you, Alpha."

"Right." I fetch her one of my shirts and shorts, dressing quickly myself.

Nathaniel surveys the destruction - the demolished bed, shredded furniture, splintered table, and walls that look like they survived a tiger attack. "You two did all this?"

"Every inch," I confirm, handing Isolde the clothes.

She dresses with feline grace before turning to me. "Best night I've had in years. If I'm ever back in town..."

Nathaniel produces a business card before I ask. "Look me up," I finish for her.

Her satisfied smile lingers as she grabs her purse and saunters out.

Nathaniel whistles low. "Office. Now. And we need a cleaning crew."

"No shit," I mutter, following him out. The scent of panther and sex still clings to my skin.

###Chapter 0156
10 Years Ago

Running was the right choice three years ago. Father had been correct. Our Alpha sent warriors hunting for us relentlessly. Those initial years were brutal. We dodged through hostile territories, clashed with rogues constantly, and survived by hunting or stealing when necessary.

Father took whatever odd jobs he could find for cash. But we never lingered anywhere long. The moment he sensed our pack closing in, we vanished into the night again.

When not working, he trained me relentlessly. As Valeria's Guardian, he insisted combat skills were essential for my survival. Mother wasn't a fighter, so protecting us fell entirely on his shoulders initially. After months of drills, I started assisting during rogue attacks. Now at thirteen, I can handle two rogues alone. Father manages four, but I'll catch up. Valeria and I grow stronger daily.

Mother refused to let my education suffer. Without formal schooling, she became my teacher. The wilderness became our classroom - science in the forest streams, chemistry in campfire reactions, math in tracking prey. Gathering supplies turned into history lessons about supernaturals and humans alike.

The wild calls to my wolf spirit. This life would be perfect without the constant threats - our pursuing pack, supernatural hunters, or wandering Alphas who might claim me.

Everything changed when Father detected our old pack's proximity again. They'd herded us steadily southeast. We'd fled through Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and recently crossed into Kentucky's Black Canyon region. This area teemed with packs, but we'd found unclaimed territory.

When the warning came, we gathered our scant possessions and ran. This time, one of Father's former warrior friends intercepted us. Father mind-linked Mother and me to hide in a cave while he shifted to confront his old comrade.

With Valeria's enhanced hearing, I eavesdropped despite Mother's protests. I wouldn't let Father face death alone. Bones cracked as an unfamiliar voice spoke. "Reginald. You're notoriously difficult to locate."

More shifting sounds preceded Father's response. "Tobias. What an unexpected reunion."

"Enough games. Three years we've hunted your family. Why abandon the pack?"

"My reasons are mine alone. Walk away, Tobias. I'd spare you, but I'll kill you if forced."

Tobias sighed heavily. "Must it come to this? Your family deserves better. Help me understand. Everything was fine, then you vanished. The Alpha wants you home."

"We're never returning. That's all you need to know. Leave now before I do what I must. Our past friendship means nothing compared to my family's safety."

I shifted silently. Valeria and I crept through the underbrush, ready to intervene.

###Chapter 0157

"Julian, I came alone." Tobias crouched low, palms raised in surrender. "The others split off in another direction. Just talk to me, brother. Help me understand why this..." His gesture encompassed the dense forest around us. "Why this exile is better for your family."

Truth rang in his words. Even Valeria couldn't detect deception in his scent.

We emerged from the thicket, my small human form dwarfed by Valeria's massive silver-furred frame. Father exhaled sharply. "Valeria, I told you to stay hidden."

Tobias's sharp intake of breath cut through the forest. "Guardian." The reverence in that single word made my skin prickle. His wide eyes darted between me and Father before landing on me with dawning realization. "This child—"

"Is my daughter Seraphina and her wolf Valeria." Father's voice turned gravelly. "The Guardian spirit awakened on her tenth birthday."

Joy transformed Tobias's face. "This changes everything! Alpha Vincent will—"

A vicious snarl ripped from Father's throat. "She's not going back."

Confusion creased Tobias's brow. "You'd deny her birthright?"

Father scrubbed a hand over his stubbled jaw. "Think, Tobias! You've got a daughter too. What would Vincent do if she manifested as a Guardian? Would you hand her over to be claimed like property?"

The truth hit Tobias like a physical blow. He took a halting step toward me. Father's warning growl vibrated through my bones.

"I'd die before harming your pup." Tobias knelt until we were eye-level. "And no, I wouldn't let any Alpha claim my girl against her will." His calloused fingers carded through Valeria's fur with practiced ease—a father's touch.

"Eleanor's here too," Father admitted.

My mother stepped from behind a moss-covered oak, her worn leather boots silent on the forest floor.

"You look..." Tobias's gaze swept over her threadbare clothes. "Better than expected." He turned back to Father. "I've got a cabin in the Sierra Madre foothills. Off-grid. No pack ties."

Mother produced a charred stick and birch bark—our makeshift writing set. Tobias sketched a rough map with quick strokes. "Cover your scent trails. I'll misdirect the hunting parties."

As he turned to leave, Tobias clasped Father's forearm. "For all the times you saved my hide."

The forest swallowed his retreating form.

Weeks of cautious travel brought us to the weathered cedar cabin. Father took construction jobs in the nearest human town while Mother and I chinked the walls with river clay.

For three peaceful years, we lived in the golden hush of the mountains. Until the shadows found us again.

###Chapter 0158
7 Years Ago

Tobias kept his promise. After six months, a burner phone arrived. He updated us regularly—pack movements, the relentless search for our family. Gradually, the hunt lost its urgency, though it never truly ceased.

We remained cautious. Lived quietly. But we were content.

Mother homeschooled me, turning the wilderness into my classroom. Father trained me daily. As a Guardian, my strength outpaced others my age. By sixteen, our sparring matches ended in equal victories.

That spring afternoon began like any other. Mother and I returned from gathering medicinal plants—herbs Father believed would enhance Valeria's growth.

Then everything shattered.

Father burst from the cabin, a duffel bag slung across his shoulder. "They're here. We leave NOW."

No questions asked. We shifted instantly. The bag landed between my jaws as we fled northward, skirting familiar territory lines.

An hour into our escape, the howl came. They'd picked up our scent.

We pushed harder. Crossed streams. Dove through lakes. Anything to break our trail. When Mother faltered near midnight, Father found a cave.

"Seraphina, guard your mother." His mind-link was tense. "I'll scout the perimeter."

The frantic message came too soon. "RUN! Vampire nest! Go NOW!"

The sickly-sweet stench hit my nostrils as we exited. I pivoted away, Mother at my heels. We'd barely covered a mile when the scent intensified. I changed course.

Again. And again.

Until realization struck—we were encircled.

The vampire emerged from shadowed pines with predatory grace. "Well, well." His crimson gaze flicked between us. "Related to the mongrel we caught, I presume?"

My blood turned to ice as two figures dragged Father into the clearing. Human form. Barely alive. Mother tensed. "Don't move," I mind-linked.

"Mate and... pup?" The vampire tilted his head. "Pity your blood tastes foul. I do enjoy them young."

His order came like a guillotine's drop. "Kill them."

Father's head rolled before the command fully registered. As the second vampire lunged for Mother, I moved faster than thought—ripping off his arm, then his head with a single slash.

The clearing erupted into chaos.

###Chapter 0159

My mother's agonized wail shatters the air. The sound claws at my soul, raw and broken from losing her mate. But grief is a luxury I can't afford right now.

She's defenseless in this state. Freshly widowed werewolves rarely survive their mate's death. So I move before the vampires do.

Father trained me well, but these aren't practice dummies. Vampires blur where wolves thunder. Faster. Deadlier. Valeria tears through them beside me, snapping necks and crushing hearts with Guardian strength. Still not fast enough.

"WOLF!"

The shout makes my blood freeze. The lead vampire - Malachi - has my mother. Her human form stands limp in his grip, eyes vacant with sorrow. She's already halfway to joining Father in death.

But not like this.

Malachi presses against her back, fingers curled around her throat. His crimson eyes lock onto me over her shoulder. "Little Guardian. Keep slaughtering my kin, and I'll snap her neck now."

I bare my teeth. His earlier threat still rings in my ears - he plans to kill us all regardless.

His lips twist into a cruel smirk. "Ah, you're right. She dies either way." He raises a staying hand as I tense to spring. "But..." He gestures to Silas slinking closer. "Stop fighting, and I won't let him play with her first."

Silas licks his fangs, gaze crawling over my mother's body. Malachi nuzzles her ear. "Silas enjoys...creative ways to make prey scream. You wouldn't want her last moments filled with that kind of pain, would you?"

'Valeria?'

'Too many. Can't reach her in time.'

I shift back. Human hands raise in surrender. Mother's eyes focus briefly, her weak head shake barely noticeable against Malachi's grip.

"Wise choice."

Then he rips her head clean off.

My scream echoes through the trees as her body crumples. I collapse to my knees. Orphaned. Alone. The last Sinclair about to die in these cursed woods.

Malachi saunters over. "I promised Silas wouldn't touch her. Never said I'd spare her." He fists my hair, wrenching my head up. "Now...what exactly are you?"

Confusion cuts through my grief. He saw me shift!

Then his nostrils flare. A fang slices my finger. When my blood touches his tongue, his pupils blow wide with unholy rapture. "Custos regni," he breathes like a prayer.

Silver cuffs snap around my wrists before I can react. "Prince Damien will reward me well for you." More shackles clamp my ankles as I'm tossed over his shoulder.

The last thing I see are my parents' broken bodies staining the forest floor.

###Chapter 0160
Trigger Warning: This chapter contains graphic depictions of violence and sexual assault.

The vampire leader tossed me into the trunk like discarded cargo. The duct tape over my mouth muffled my screams as darkness swallowed me whole.

Tears burned hot against my cheeks. No one was coming for me. My parents—gods, the thought shattered what remained of my heart—were gone. Valeria's mournful howls echoed through my mind. Even if Jude survived, my former pack would assume I'd perished with them.

Why would Prince Damien want a werewolf? Our blood supposedly repulsed vampires. Yet when Malachi tasted me, he'd reacted like a starving man finding water in the desert. His whispered words still crawled under my skin. Nothing good awaited me.

The car finally stopped after what felt like hours. I coiled my bound limbs, ready to spring—useless as it was. Malachi anticipated the move, snatching me mid-leap.

"Patience, little snack." His breath reeked of copper. "Play your cards right, and the Prince might keep you as a blood pet." A fate worse than death.

The gothic monstrosity looming before us screamed vampire lair. Gargoyles leered from crumbling turrets. Crimson light bled through arched windows, illuminating silhouettes engaged in unspeakable acts.

The screams hit first. Raw. Primal. The kind that claws its way from ruptured lungs. Moans of forced pleasure twisted with wet, tearing sounds. My stomach heaved.

Malachi dumped me onto cold stone. The throne room reeked of blood and terror so thick I could taste it. At the dais, Prince Damien lounged like a predator savoring its kill.

The scene burned into my retinas:

A young man swayed on his knees, wrist trapped between the Prince's fangs, skin turning waxen. A woman—girl, really—was being face-fucked to death. Her weakening punches against the Prince's thighs slowed as his grip on her hair tightened. I watched the exact moment life left her eyes.

The Prince released both corpses carelessly. He dabbed his lips with a linen napkin, as if cleaning up after afternoon tea. Those soulless eyes locked onto mine while the man at his feet bled out.

Malachi shoved me forward. The Prince's smile revealed bloodstained fangs.

"Ah," he purred. "The Guardian."

Every hair on my body stood erect. How did he know?

The Prince rose, circling me like a shark scenting blood. "You're going to make me very powerful, little wolf."

Valeria's growl vibrated through my bones. Whatever game they were playing, the rules just changed.

###Chapter 0161

"Malachi, what have you brought me?"

"Sire." He drops to one knee, forcing me down with him. His gaze lifts to the prince. "I've located one."

Prince Damien's eyes lock onto me, burning with predatory hunger. "Are you certain?" His voice drips with greed.

Malachi yanks my arm forward. "Taste her yourself. I only took enough to confirm. She took down four of our coven before I subdued her. That's how I knew."

The prince doesn't blink as he strides forward, seizing my wrist and inhaling deeply. His eyelids flutter shut—but not before I see the ravenous glow in them. His fangs descend, and with deceptive gentleness, he pierces my skin.

The second my blood hits his tongue, his irises flood crimson. His grip turns vicious. A low, obscene groan rumbles from his chest as he drinks. When he finally tears away, his lips glisten.

"Untouched. Pure." His filthy purr makes my stomach revolt. He raises his voice over the chaos around us. "No one touches her but me."

He turns back to Malachi. "A fresh shipment arrives tomorrow. You may pick first from the feeders. For now—" His finger trails down my cheek. I jerk back, but Malachi clamps a hand behind my skull. "—I'll escort her to her quarters. I want her close."

He hauls me upright and addresses Malachi. "You've done well. Go feed. Take your pleasure. Report back when you're finished."

Malachi bows. As I'm dragged away, I spot him heading toward a cage I'd missed—packed with trembling humans. He wrenches open the door, snatches a sobbing child no older than five, and sinks his fangs into the boy's throat. The scream cuts off as Malachi nearly decapitates him, tossing the small body aside before grabbing a grown woman next.

The prince leads me to a lavish chamber, shockingly bright compared to the castle's gloom. White walls. Airy drapes. "This is yours now. Don't attempt escape—the walls are laced with silver." He rips the tape from my mouth. "You'll be treated well here. No one feeds on you. No one defiles you. Your exquisite blood remains mine alone."

He gestures around. "Within these walls, you may do as you please. Books? Ask. You'll receive three iron-rich meals daily—I'll require regular feedings. Anything reasonable will be provided."

"And if I refuse?" Does he truly think this is a privilege?

His smile vanishes. "I placed you here out of respect for your status as a Guardian. Elite among werewolves—superior even to other supernaturals. But cross me, and I'll chain you in the cells with the other cattle. Or perhaps I'll grow bored and let my coven have you." His fingers brush my throat. "They lack my... restraint."

He tosses me the key to my shackles and strides out, locking me in this gilded cage.

Exhausted, I collapse onto the bed. The day's horrors—the screams, the blood—echo in my skull. These nightmares will haunt me forever.

###Chapter 0162

One month ago

Five months. Five long months I'd spent hunting Victor Blackwood, and now I finally had him trapped. The bastard was slippery, I'd give him that, but this time, there was no escape.

I sat in my car outside a rundown motel off some forgotten highway in the middle of nowhere, Arizona. The place reeked of desperation and cheap liquor. My team had the building surrounded. We'd spotted him earlier, and to avoid any complications, we'd spun some bullshit story to the clueless human kid at the front desk—something about us being federal agents and Victor being a fugitive. Didn’t matter. The lie was just to keep the local cops from interfering and giving him another chance to vanish like he had before.

The door to his room creaked open. Victor stepped out, glancing around like a cornered animal before slinging his bag over his shoulder. He was about to bolt again. Lucky for me, we’d caught up just in time.

My men moved in fast, cutting off his escape. He dropped his bag, muscles tensing for a fight, but they hit him with wolfsbane darts before he could shift. Within seconds, he crumpled to the ground.

I got out of the car and strode over, grabbing a fistful of his hair to yank his face up to mine. His eyes were hazy, but he was still conscious.

"Got you, you worthless piece of shit," I snarled. "Time to pay for what you did."

Victor had been rotting in my dungeons for nearly a month now. The first week, I didn’t even bother questioning him—just used him as a punching bag. All the rage, the frustration, the years of loneliness, the agony of losing Evelyn, the bitter resentment of being forced to choose a Luna who wasn’t my fated mate—it all poured out every time I stepped into that cell.

Honestly, I was surprised he was still breathing. The bastard could take a beating, I’d give him that. Maybe he had some Alpha blood in him after all. Most Betas would’ve broken by now.

I wiped his blood off my knuckles and glared down at him. "Why did you do it?"

Same question I’d asked every day for the past three weeks.

Same answer.

"I didn’t kill her," he rasped, his voice raw from screaming.

His arms were shackled above his head with silver cuffs, his body hanging limp, feet barely scraping the floor.

"Bullshit," I snapped. "You were found holding her body. Covered in her blood. Tell me why."

He lifted his head with effort, one eye swollen shut, the other barely open. "I didn’t do it. I swear."

I drove my fist into his stomach. "You expect me to believe that? After what you did to Evelyn? You tried to force a mate bond on her. You’re a monster."

He coughed, spitting blood onto the floor. "What I did to Evelyn was wrong. I’ll pay for that. But I didn’t kill your mother."

I grabbed his hair again, forcing him to meet my gaze. "Admit it. Just say it, and I’ll make it quick. Keep lying, and this"—I gestured to the bloodstained room—"never ends."

He locked eyes with me, defiance burning through the pain. "I. Didn’t. Do. It."

I let go with a snarl. "Fine. Suffer, then."

Twenty minutes later, he was unconscious.

I turned to the guards. "Get him down. Feed him. Keep him alive." I wiped my hands on my pants. "Call me if he talks."

The dungeons were soundproofed, reinforced so no one upstairs could hear the screams. Werewolves were violent creatures, but the pups and pregnant females didn’t need to know what happened down here.

At the top of the stairs, Nathaniel was waiting. He took one look at me—covered in blood—and grimaced. "You need a shower."

I glanced down. He wasn’t wrong.

"Walk with me," he said, keeping his voice low.

I followed, making sure the halls were empty. Couldn’t have the pack seeing their future Alpha like this.

Not yet.

###Chapter 0163

Nathaniel updates me on warrior training, border patrols, and rogue sightings as we head toward my quarters.

The restless itch beneath my skin won’t fade. If anything, it’s grown worse. I thought capturing Victor would help. When it didn’t, I hoped beating him senseless would. No confession yet, but the violence hasn’t soothed this gnawing unease.

I step into the shower while Nathaniel continues his report. When I emerge, his expression makes my spine stiffen.

“What?” I snap.

“You know damn well what.” His voice is steady, unflinching. “You’re spiraling, Sebastian. The signs are there—the aggression, the recklessness. You’re slipping toward feral. You need a Luna. A mate. You can’t keep carrying this alone.”

“I had a Luna.” My growl rattles the mirror. “She chose someone else.”

“Wrong.” He doesn’t back down. He’s the only one in Nightshade Pack who dares challenge me—which is why he’s my Beta. “She chose her fated mate. If he hadn’t been, her decision might’ve been different. It’s been six months. You need to start considering who could stand beside you.”

I slam my fist into the counter. “You think I haven’t tried? That I haven’t searched for someone strong enough to handle this pack? To handle me? I was leading Nightshade long before I took the Alpha title. No she-wolf here can shoulder that.”

“What about Alpha Alistair’s daughter? She’s Alpha-blooded. Raised to be a Luna.”

I scoff. “That timid little thing? I need a partner, Nathaniel. Someone who can match me in battle, in bed. Not some decorum-obsessed puppet who frets over table settings.” I shove past him, yanking open my closet.

“I’m going into the city tonight. To find a warm body that isn’t from this pack. Tomorrow—”

A patrol’s mind-link cuts me off. Alpha. Beta. Breach at the eastern border.

“Rogues?” Nathaniel asks.

Just one. But you need to see this.

“Donovan, you can’t handle a single rogue?”

It’s not that. Just—come.

Nathaniel moves first. “I’ll go.”

“No.” I’m already striding past him. “I’m coming.”

We jog toward the border. Halfway there, a scent hits me—raspberries and fresh cream. Dorian, dormant since Evelyn’s rejection, surges forward with a possessive snarl.

Dorian?

He doesn’t answer, but his focus locks onto the intruder.

When we reach the patrol, one of my warriors cradles a limp figure. The moment I see her, a roar tears from my throat. Dorian forces me into an aggressive stance, hackles raised. Nathaniel blocks me. “Alpha?”

Mate. Dorian’s voice is a thunderclap in my skull. He shoves past Nathaniel and rips her from Donovan’s grasp.

She’s slight. Fragile. Skin like frosted glass, white hair tangled with dirt. Her face is hollowed by starvation. Beneath the tattered jacket she wears, puncture wounds litter her body.

Dorian, is she human?

I drag her against my chest, inhaling deeply. No. But her wolf… it’s silent. Gone.

It wouldn’t matter if she were human. The Moon Goddess made her for me. She’s mine.

Her scent alone dissolves the tension that’s plagued me for months. My body settles, the war inside me stilling. A calm I’ve never known washes through my veins.

“Mate,” I rasp.

###Chapter 0164
Present Day

Time has blurred in this nightmare. The feeding chamber, as I instantly named it that first horrific night, remains my nightly destination. Night after night, they drag humans in for slaughter. Missing persons. Runaways. Trafficking victims. All end up as vampire sustenance.

Prince Damien selected his permanent feeder the night after my arrival. Strangely, he kept her alive. She's endured as long as I have. The poor girl stopped screaming when he rapes her during feedings long ago. Most humans don't survive the initial attack. Those who do never see a third sunrise.

I witness the carnage daily. Men. Women. Children. Elderly. The vampires don't discriminate. They use them. Drain them. Sometimes tear them apart when bloodlust overcomes reason.

Screams. Sobs. Begging. Death rattles. This symphony of suffering plays endlessly in my personal hell. Only once did I get respite. When visiting royalty from another coven came, Prince Damien offered me as a novelty. They nearly bled me dry. The prince had to rip the other vampire from my throat, barely sparing my carotid artery.

Those three recovery days were my only reprieve in this eternal torment. Sometimes during feedings, I wonder what cosmic crime condemned me to this existence. My life was never easy, but this?

Valeria rarely surfaces anymore. At first, she healed me swiftly. Now my bite marks scar. She only mends the most life-threatening wounds. My body's a roadmap of punctures - arms, legs, breasts, inner thighs, backside. Anywhere Prince Damien fancies drinking.

Resistance is futile. He won't harm me - he's addicted to my blood. But he'll slaughter others if I disobey. So I comply. Doesn't stop the nightly killings. Just means they're not my fault.

The orgies nauseate me. Vampires coupling with their prey. Pain excites them. Agony enhances their pleasure.

Only Malachi's girl differs. We've formed a silent bond. After her second night, I realized he'd keep her alive. He rapes her nightly while feeding, but never lethally. Eventually she got her own cell. Our eyes met during nightly transfers.

Maybe curiosity drew us together. Maybe shared survival instinct. She'd stopped crying like I had. We both learned to endure.

Tonight, Prince Damien feasts on my inner thigh, his repulsive tongue lapping blood. He's raping someone simultaneously, pinning them with one hand while gripping my thigh with the other. Their pained whimpers mix with his grunts of pleasure as he violates us both.

###Chapter 0165

My gaze darted wildly for an escape from the nightmare when our eyes met. Malachi had her pinned against the stone wall, fangs buried in her throat as he took her violently. Through the haze of terror, we clung to each other's stare like drowning souls grasping at driftwood. Her lips formed silent words that seared into my soul: "I'm here." My chest constricted as I answered with my own voiceless promise: "You're not alone."

It became our secret rebellion. Every night when the monsters feasted, we'd find each other across the blood-soaked chamber. Those stolen moments of connection were the only things keeping me sane. Especially after Valeria's voice vanished from my mind, leaving me stranded in this waking hell.

"Guardian." Prince Damien's slimy voice slithered through the dungeon. "I'm particularly thirsty tonight. Remove that pathetic scrap you call clothing." Though the prince never violated me like the others—his twisted pride wouldn't share his "prize"—he delighted in making the feedings degrading. Tonight he'd already drained two humans dry, their lifeless bodies discarded like empty wine bottles.

The sheer fabric slipped from my shoulders. He yanked me against his ice-cold chest, fangs piercing the tender flesh above my heart. I bit back a scream as his revolting tongue flicked over my nipple. When he dragged another girl onto his lap, I knew what came next. I'd witnessed this grotesque ritual countless times—how he climaxed while suffocating his victims between his thighs.

As his eyes rolled back in ecstasy, I searched the shadows. There. My lifeline. My only friend in this charnel house. We mouthed our mantra across the gore-slick floor, our gazes weaving an invisible shield against the horror.

The explosion shattered the castle doors.

Vampires scattered like cockroaches as silver gas canisters rolled across the flagstones. Wooden projectiles whizzed through the smoke—each hit causing a bloodsucker to age centuries in seconds, crumbling to dust mid-scream. I remained frozen, too broken to even flee my own salvation.

A heavy jacket engulfed my bare shoulders. "You're safe now," a gruff voice declared, though the battle still raged around us. "We're getting everyone out."

The sudden cold night air shocked my system. After years of imprisonment, my knees buckled at the sight of the moon. They loaded me into a waiting van where medics strapped an oxygen mask over my face.

"Who—" I rasped between gulps of clean air.

"Hunters Guild," my rescuer answered with grim pride. "We exterminate supernatural vermin." He vanished back into the fray before I could react.

Hunters. My stomach plummeted. I'd traded one executioner for another. If they discovered what pulsed beneath my skin...

A weak hand grasped mine. My friend tugged her oxygen mask aside, her whisper barely audible over the chaos: "Run. I've always known you're different. Go—I'll buy you time."

Her fingers slipped from mine as I melted into the shadows.

###Chapter 0166

"Who are you?" I demand, my voice hoarse from days without proper rest.

"Genevieve," the woman answers, her eyes darting toward the chaos around us. "Now move, Guardian. Your secret dies with me." She emphasizes the title—the only name anyone here knows me by.

I nod my thanks before scanning the area. Pure pandemonium. Hunters chase fleeing vampires while others load survivors onto trucks. Slipping from the vehicle, I weave through the shadows until the tree line swallows me whole. Then I run.

Three days of relentless flight. Streams have washed away the stench of blood and captivity, but starvation claws at my insides. Without Valeria to hunt for me, weakened as I am, prey escapes my grasp. Berries and edible roots barely sustain me—certainly not enough to outpace the ghosts on my heels.

Nights find me curled in hollow logs or perched in towering oaks, praying predators and rogue vampires pass beneath me.

The rising sun guides me south. My family had ventured north years ago—straight into vampiric territory. I don't know where the coven stood relative to our capture point, but south promises ocean. If I live to see it.

Today's march leaves me swaying on my feet. A day without water. Countless since real food passed my lips. I'm sinking to my knees when a sound freezes my blood—a hunting wolf's howl. Not just any wolf. A predator closing in on prey.

More join the chorus.

I bolt.

Trees blur as I zigzag through the undergrowth, lungs burning. Maybe a river could save me. Maybe—

The forest spits me into a moonlit clearing. Three massive wolves materialize from the opposite tree line. I whirl—only to find two more cutting off my retreat.

"Please." The word tears from my throat. Not for mercy. Not for life. Just not another cage. "Don't—"

Exhaustion wins. The world tilts. Darkness rises.


###Chapter 0167

My arms tighten around my fragile mate as I ascend to the alpha floor. These private quarters have remained untouched since my mother's passing when I was six. My father couldn't bear the memories and relocated to a cabin deep in the woods. He offered me the choice—I chose to stay. The familiar scent of pine and leather still lingers in these walls.

Dr. Whitmore arrives just as I settle the unconscious woman onto the guest bed across from my own chambers. I don't know if she'll recognize our bond yet—not in this condition. She needs space. Safety.

"Alpha?" The doctor knocks lightly.

"Enter." My command comes out rougher than intended.

Nathaniel hovers at the threshold until my growl sends him retreating. Dr. Whitmore's eyebrows lift but she says nothing, immediately assessing my mate's condition. "Remove her outer garments while I prepare the IV."

The moment I peel back the tattered jacket, my vision tints red.

Bite marks.

Dozens of them. Some fresh, others faded to silver scars. All unmistakably vampire.

"Moon Goddess," the doctor breathes, gloved hands hovering over the worst clusters. "Where did you—"

"Found her collapsed at our northern border." My claws extend involuntarily. Dorian howls in my mind, demanding vengeance for what's been done to her.

Dr. Whitmore works swiftly—inserting IV lines, drawing blood samples. "Severe dehydration. Malnutrition. Likely anemia given the blood loss." Her stethoscope pauses over my mate's ribs. "Her wolf?"

"Dormant," I grit out. How could fate give me someone so broken? So small she might shatter if I hold her too tight.

The doctor's gaze flicks to my clenched fists. "She's...?"

I give a single nod. "That information stays between us."

"Understood." She packs her kit with clinical efficiency. "I'll run these tests immediately. Monitor her breathing—if it changes, mind-link me."

As the door clicks shut, Nathaniel's voice echoes in my skull. "Report."

"Three known covens within our territory," he responds. "But nothing about escaped prisoners." A pause. "Though... hunters raided a nest 170 miles north nine days ago. Rumor says their prince kept a favorite blood donor." His hesitation speaks volumes. "The description matches her."

I sink into the bedside chair, fingers brushing a strand of hair from her ashen face. Whoever did this will pay in screams.

But first... first she has to live.

###Chapter 0168

"Do we have any updates on the coven? Did the prince manage to evade the hunters?" I demand.

"Not yet," Nathaniel replies. "I just wanted to inform you of my findings. Are you still planning to go into the city tonight?"

My gaze shifts to my mate. The thought of seeking another's warmth is laughable now. I've found her, and I'll do whatever it takes to ensure she never slips away again.

"No. I'm staying here. If you uncover anything else, link me immediately."

Hours later, Dr. Whitmore returns. His expression is grim.

"Alpha, we can administer a blood transfusion, but we've never performed one on a werewolf before. There's no guarantee her body will accept it."

I shake my head. "Let's give her more time to heal naturally before resorting to extreme measures."

A week passes.

My mate still hasn't opened her eyes.

Dr. Whitmore assures me she's recovering, albeit slowly. My presence, even if she doesn't consciously sense the bond, is aiding her recovery.

I've barely left her side. Nathaniel handles all pack matters, delivering only the most urgent reports. Only he and Dr. Whitmore are permitted on this floor. The pack remains unaware of her existence—until she wakes, I won't risk unnecessary disturbances.

When Dr. Whitmore arrives for his morning checkup, I slip away to shower and change.

Through the mind link, I ask Nathaniel, "Anything requiring my attention?"

"What should we do with Victor Blackwood?"

I haven't set foot in the dungeons since my mate arrived. Leaving her now is unthinkable—her condition remains fragile. If anything happened in my absence, I'd never forgive myself.

"Let him rot. Ensure he has enough food and water to survive, but nothing more. My focus is on her."

"Yes, Alpha." He hesitates, the link still open.

"Out with it, Nathaniel."

"I've gathered more intel on the northern vampire coven. Prince Damien and his inner circle escaped the hunters. Rumor has it they've seized control of a weaker coven, and his influence is growing."

Another pause. I growl in warning.

"Get to the point."

"They're searching for two women. One matches your mate's description—pale skin, white hair. The bounty for her safe return is five million dollars."

I freeze mid-step.

Five million? For a werewolf?

Vampires despise our blood—they claim it tastes like rancid mud. So why would a vampire prince want my mate badly enough to offer such a fortune?

"Double the patrols. I want immediate alerts if anyone detects an unfamiliar scent." I consider for a moment. "Have you ever encountered a vampire's scent before?"

"Once. It's unforgettable—cloying, sickly sweet."

"Did you notice it on my mate when we found her?"

"No offense, Alpha, but you didn't exactly let any of us get close enough to check. I'll ask Donovan if he detected anything unusual before we arrived."

"Order the patrols to hunt for that scent. If it's detected anywhere near our territory or the human city, I'm to be notified immediately."

"Understood."

The link closes.

As I finish dressing, my mind races. What makes my mate so valuable to them? Dorian confirmed she has a wolf—her blood should repel vampires, not attract them.

Lost in thought, I return to her room—my nameless, mysterious mate.

It takes me a full three seconds to realize her eyes are open.

She stares at me, wide-eyed.

Then, the fear in her gaze hardens into something far more unsettling—dread, and cold, unwavering resolve.

###Chapter 0169

Hell has reclaimed me. The metallic scent of blood, the piercing screams, the suffocating fear—it all crashes over me like a tidal wave. I was supposed to be free. How did I end up back in this nightmare? My mind scrambles for answers, but the feeding room's horrors drown out all coherent thought.

Panic claws at my throat when I realize she's gone. Genevieve. The name surfaces from the depths of my fractured memory, though I can't recall how I know her. Only corpses surround me now. Maybe I've joined them. This isn't the afterlife I imagined—where are my parents? Where's the safety I was promised?

Then it comes—the crisp, earthy fragrance of pine needles. The scent of my childhood, when Mother and I would forage for medicinal herbs. The aroma intensifies until suddenly, the stone walls dissolve. I'm standing in an emerald forest, sunlight dappling through the canopy.

Alone, but safe. This place smells of happier times. I wander aimlessly until finding a sunlit clearing. Exhaustion weighs me down as I collapse onto the mossy ground. The golden warmth on my skin lulls me into oblivion.

When I wake, the forest remains unchanged. I inhale deeply—damp soil, resinous bark, the ozone hint of approaching rain. My soul soars at nature's perfume. If this is death, why aren't my parents here? I call for them until my voice grows hoarse, but only the forest answers—chirping birds, babbling brooks, the evening chorus of insects.

Peace. A forgotten sensation that now feels dangerously addictive.

Time loses meaning. I sleep when weary, explore when awake. The perpetual twilight never shifts. Until—

A voice. Deep, resonant, magnetic. It pulls me like a lodestone. As I follow the sound, a familiar vibration thrums in my mind. "Valeria?" Silence, then the purr grows stronger. "Oh Valeria. Can you hear me? I've missed you desperately. I love you. We'll find our way back—just grow stronger for me."

The masculine voice fades, taking Valeria's presence with it. The cycle repeats for untold days until new voices join the chorus—a woman's lilting tones. Valeria's sudden growl startles me. 'Danger?' I ask my wolf.

No—this feels sharper, hotter. Jealousy? Absurd. Why would we care about strangers talking? The man's voice disappears as the forest dims. The woman keeps speaking while invisible hands tug at my arms. When the pulling stops, Valeria whispers two earth-shattering words: 'Wake up.'

'Valeria? Are you really back?'

'Not fully, my sweet Seraphina. But I'm close. Wake now—help me return to you.'

###Chapter 0170

"Name your price. I'll do whatever you ask."

"Open your eyes."

I hadn't realized they were shut. The moment she speaks, my eyelids fly open. The forest is gone. Instead, I'm lying on a plush bed in an unfamiliar room. An IV line snakes into my arm, dripping fluids into my veins. I yank it out without hesitation, bringing the tube to my nose. Saline. No trace of wolfsbane or poison.

My limbs feel weak as water, but I force myself to assess the situation. This isn't my cell at the vampire coven. The space feels... welcoming. Ridiculous. Bedrooms should be described as cozy or well-decorated, not safe. Especially not for me. I need to move before whoever put me here realizes I'm conscious.

The sheet slips as I try to rise, revealing bare skin. Fantastic. My body still bears evidence of that final night in the feeding chamber - wounds healing slower than usual, though not as badly as some older scars. Maybe Valeria's strength is returning enough to aid my recovery.

Footsteps echo in the hallway. I drop back against the pillows, dragging the covers up to my chin just as the door swings open.

The man who enters could rival a mountain in size. His broad frame reminds me painfully of my father. Sun-kissed blond hair, the kind that lightens in summer. Eyes like wild sage leaves - the exact shade my mother and I would hunt for in the woods.

Then his scent hits me.

Goddess above. It's the same earthy fragrance that pulled me from nightmares into that forest clearing. Pine and fresh rainfall and something indescribably familiar. I inhale deeply - and catch the unmistakable musk of alpha.

Our eyes lock as his dominance rolls over me. Fear surges like a tidal wave, but I've had years of practice drowning it. I shove the emotion down, locking it away. Whatever comes next, I'll survive it. I always do.

He freezes mid-step, studying me with unsettling intensity. "You're awake."

Not a question. I remain silent, waiting.

Slowly, cautiously, he approaches like I'm a skittish animal. "Sebastian. You collapsed on Nightshade territory over a week ago. My physician has been keeping you alive." His gaze flicks to the blood trickling from my torn IV site. I swear his jaw tightens.

"We were treating severe dehydration and malnutrition. Your blood levels were critically low - explains why that isn't clotting." He reaches for my arm.

I jerk back instinctively.

A low growl rumbles in his chest. "I don't drink blood, little wolf. Only reason I care about yours is because I didn't waste a week of my life healing you just to watch you bleed out." His palm remains outstretched. "Arm. Now."

Not a request. And I'm fresh out of options.

###Chapter 0171

My palm meets his, skin against skin. A jolt of electricity shoots up my arm, making me flinch. His smirk only deepens my unease.

He lifts my wrist to his lips, eyes locked on mine. When his gaze drops to the wound, irritation flashes across his face. "Did you have to tear it out like that?" The question hangs in the air, demanding no answer.

His tongue glides over the injury, sealing it shut. I bite back a gasp. This feels nothing like the vampire prince's revolting touch. Sebastian's contact sends unexpected waves of pleasure through me—unwelcome and confusing.

He settles into the chair beside the bed. "Can you speak?"

"Yes." The word scrapes my throat, turning into a cough. In an instant, he's on his feet, pressing a glass of water to my lips. The cool liquid soothes the rawness. I close my eyes, savoring the relief.

When I open them again, his stare pins me in place. "Finish it." He tilts the glass back to my mouth. I obey, watching him over the rim.

"Better?"

I nod.

"Use your words, Seraphina."

"Yes." This time, my voice holds steady.

"Good." He sets the glass aside. "Your name?"

"Seraphina."

A slow smile curves his lips. "Fitting. You look like one."

"Where are you from?"

I shrug. That answer isn't simple.

"Were you always rogue?"

"No."

"What pack?" The rapid-fire questions leave no room for hesitation, but this one makes me freeze.

"Are you sending me back?"

"Never." His tone brooks no argument. "You won't set foot there again."

"Then why does it matter?"

"Why were you running from them?"

I counter, "What makes you think I was?"

"No wolf turns rogue without cause. Did you kill someone?"

I scoff. Rogues carry stigma—most assume we're violent outcasts. They don't consider those fleeing tyranny, like my family did.

"No, I didn't."

"Didn't kill or didn't run?"

"Why do you care?" Frustration tightens my chest. His interrogation spins my thoughts.

"As Alpha, my pack's safety comes first. I need to know if you're a threat."

"I'm no danger. Just point me to some clothes, and I'll disappear."

His expression hardens. "You're not leaving."

Dread coils in my stomach. He doesn't even know I'm a Guardian yet, and already he's claiming ownership. I have to escape before Valeria regains strength—before he discovers the truth.

###Chapter 0172


The moment I step back into the room and see my mate awake, Dorian starts rumbling in my mind. The sudden vibration makes me pause. "What the hell, Dorian?"

"She's ours. Flawless. Divine."

Fantastic. My wolf's already obsessed with this fragile girl. I'm not there yet. Too many unanswered questions.

Her IV's been ripped out. Typical. I've been fighting to keep her alive, and her first act is sabotaging my efforts.

Her refusal to let me heal her pisses me off more. Not that it should. Who knows how long those bloodsuckers kept her? The scars suggest years. Maybe the whole damn coven fed on her simultaneously.

"Angel," she says when I ask her name. Fitting. At least visually. 'Our angel,' Dorian coos. Annoying bastard.

Key discovery: She wants nothing to do with her pack. Worse, she's determined to leave mine. Not happening. Even without the mate bond, the bounty on her head would force me to keep her here. Her pallor when I tell her she's staying concerns me. Did her old pack drive her out?

A knock interrupts us. I snarl instinctively. The door cracks open. "Alpha?"

Food aromas drift in. Angel's stomach growls loudly. Shit. How long since she's eaten? "Enter, Nathaniel."

He freezes upon seeing her awake. His smile at her makes my canines itch. "You're awake," he observes.

She clutches the blanket to her chest. Right. No clothes. Starving and exposed. 'Brilliant caretaking, Sebastian,' Dorian mocks.

+15 BONDS

I'd been so focused on interrogation, I forgot basic needs.

"Nathaniel, fetch clothes for Seraphina." He glances between us before nodding to her.

"Seraphina. Suits you. I'm Nathaniel." She gives a tight nod. When he moves to place the tray on her lap, my growl stops him mid-motion. I snatch it away.

"Clothes. And bring another portion."

"Yes, Alpha." He exits swiftly.

Turning back, I reassess my mate. So damn petite. Is the Moon Goddess playing games? Yet she survived vampire captivity. There's steel beneath that fragile exterior.

Rejecting her isn't an option. Dorian would turn feral instantly. Besides, I've waited lifetimes for this. The alternatives? Going rogue or settling for an unworthy Luna. The Goddess chose her. That's enough.

'Damn right,' Dorian snaps. 'I'd shred you from the inside if you tried.'

The image chills me. Dorian unrestrained would require execution. Only Adrian or Evelyn could stop us.

'Relax. Just theorizing.'

'Stop theorizing. Never happening.'

I adjust the tray on Angel's lap. She sniffs cautiously before tasting. Time for questions between bites.

"Did you leave your pack voluntarily?"

She swallows. "No. My parents took me."

Interesting. Rogues by choice.

"Where are they now?"

Her throat works. I know the answer before her whisper: "Dead."

I nod, giving her space, but press the fork back into her hand. "Eat. How old?"

"Sixteen when they died."

"Vampires?" A tear slips down her cheek. Dorian rages in my skull.

'You insensitive prick! Let me handle her!'

'She needs this. Probably never processed their deaths properly.'

"How long ago?" My voice stays soft—uncharacteristic for me. She's so small. Could pass for twelve, but she said sixteen when orphaned. Is she even legal?

Her frown deepens. "What year is it?"

When I tell her, she gasps, hand flying to her mouth. Tears cascade. Dorian's snarls fill my mind. Fuck. Exactly how long did those parasites keep her?

I take her hand. She might not want comfort, but she's got no one else. I know that isolation well.

"Seven years," she breathes. "It's been seven years."

###Chapter 0173

Seven years. Seven years of torment. Those monstrous vampires stole everything from me. If I ever get my hands on them...

"I'll make them pay." Valeria's voice echoes my thoughts.

The thought of more bloodshed twists my gut. At twenty-three, I've already endured a lifetime of violence.

Sebastian's fingers tighten around mine. I hadn't even noticed he was holding my hand. Part of me wants to pull away, but his touch is strangely grounding.

"This isn't easy for you. Try to eat more—you need your strength. We can change the subject while you finish." His voice is softer than I expected.

I glance down at the half-eaten meal when another knock interrupts us. Nathaniel's cedar-and-sage scent drifts through the door before he enters, balancing a second tray and a shopping bag.

"Come in," Sebastian says, still gripping my hand.

Nathaniel hands the tray to Sebastian, who balances it on his lap without releasing me. The Beta's eyes flick to our joined hands but he wisely keeps silent, placing the bag at the foot of the bed instead.

"Wasn't sure about sizing. You're... petite. Brought a few options."

"We'll get you proper clothes once you're stronger," Sebastian adds.

My brows knit together. I don't want his charity. I need to run.

"Why would you do that?"

He arches an eyebrow. "Prefer swimming in children's clothes?"

I glare at the bag, then back at him. He taps his nose. "I know my pack's scent—including the pups. You're tiny. Kid's sizes were Nathaniel's best bet on short notice."

"I wanted to be taller," I mutter. Sebastian's sharp gaze tells me he heard. "My father was your height. Mother towered over me, but..." I trail off with a shrug. Years as a blood bag stunted my growth.

+18 BONDS

"Some of our fiercest she-wolves are pocket-sized. Doesn't make them less deadly." Nathaniel grins.

I can't help smiling back—until Sebastian's growl vibrates through the room. I try to yank my hand free, but his grip turns vice-like.

"That's enough, Nathaniel."

The Beta smirks behind Sebastian's back, ducking toward the door. "See you soon, Seraphina." He's gone before Sebastian can snap again.

Those piercing amber eyes lock onto me, impossible to look away from. "Eat." The command comes out surprisingly gentle.

He finally releases me to attack his own meal. Nathaniel's interruption helped settle my nerves enough to resume eating.

"Need to ask you something." Sebastian's tone warns me another interrogation is coming.

I sigh. "What now?"

"When you escaped the coven—you did escape, right? They didn't let you go?" I nod. "Was it during a hunter attack?"

My fork clatters onto the tray. "How could you know that?"

Instead of answering, he fires another question. "Were you Prince Damien's personal blood bag?"

Ice floods my veins. Are they allied with the vampires? Will they return me to that monster?

I push the tray away. If I'm going back, I won't give them the satisfaction of fattening me up first. "Yes. Are you sending me to him?"

Sebastian's jaw tightens. "No. But you should know—he's offering five million for your safe return. Every bounty hunter and vampire on this continent is hunting you."

Bile rises in my throat.

His hand engulfs mine again. "You're safe here. I'll protect you." He doesn't understand—no one can.

Sebastian moves both trays aside, sitting on the bed to cradle my face. "Listen to me, Seraphina. My pack is the second strongest nationwide. Our allies? The strongest. If war comes, we'll burn the world to keep you safe."

My breathing turns ragged. I can't go back. Genevieve escaped with the hunters—I only survived because of her.

Sebastian tilts my chin up. "Breathe."

I'm gasping like a landed fish, terror flooding my system—until his lips crash against mine.

His winter-pine scent overwhelms my senses, shocking me into inhaling sharply. I shove him away. "What the hell was that?"

"You stopped breathing. Needed to snap you out of it." He shrugs like he didn't just steal my first kiss.

###Chapter 0174

Seven years? That explains why I never detected her presence. My destined mate had been imprisoned as a blood donor since I reached maturity. Had she not escaped when she did, I might never have discovered her existence. The passage of time had nearly driven me to accept a chosen mate instead. My fury toward the vampires burns white-hot. They stole my mate from me, and they will suffer for it.

When Nathaniel returns, his flirtatious banter with Seraphina ignites my temper. He's deliberately provoking me, though as Beta he should show proper respect to his future Luna. The bastard knows exactly which buttons to push.

It stings that Seraphina believes I'd return her to those parasites. She doesn't recognize our mate bond yet, but her perception of an Alpha's role is dangerously warped. Though she's not officially part of my pack, no honorable Alpha would condemn their mate to such torment. This makes me question what horrors shaped her views. Her parents abandoned their pack - that always traces back to leadership failure. Either their Alpha was the problem or refused to address it. Either way, he poisoned my mate's understanding of what an Alpha should be.

I've effectively led Nightshade Pack since age ten. Though my father held the Alpha title until his death, his ability to govern died with my mother. Nathaniel's father, my father's Beta, guided me in ruling. He protected our vulnerable pack and taught me everything required of an Alpha.

At sixteen, my father seemed relieved to finally join my mother in death. The transition of power flowed smoothly. I retained Nathaniel's father as Beta until Nathaniel came of age and assumed the position officially.

I've always taken my Alpha responsibilities with deadly seriousness. Knowing other Alphas abuse their packs - and I know they exist - enrages me. I refuse alliances with any Alpha known for mistreating their wolves. Given Nightshade's current status as the strongest pack nationally, most seek our favor.

I anticipate Blackthorn Pack will surpass us at next year's quadrennial Alpha competition. While I edge out Adrian in strength, his two Guardians - one being his Luna Evelyn - tip the scales. Gregory's wheelchair may prevent competition, but he'd dominate if he participated. And Evelyn is formidable alone. I may surpass Adrian, but not Adrian and Evelyn combined. Losing our top ranking next year won't trouble me. Though I haven't spoken to Evelyn since her birthday, I update Adrian periodically about Victor's situation. I'll also warn him of potential vampire attacks. Our alliance remains solid regardless of rankings.

When I inform Seraphina about the bounty, I expected distress - but not this magnitude. She must understand leaving isn't an option. Beyond my refusal to let her go, her safety demands she stay under my protection. Too many hunters would pursue her.

When she spirals into panic, I realize she needs a system shock. 'Kiss her,' Dorian suggests. It's as good a solution as any.

The instant our lips meet, her flavor explodes across my senses - raspberries and whipped cream, even sweeter than her scent.

Suddenly I comprehend Adrian's violent protectiveness over Evelyn after recognizing their bond. Were our positions reversed, I'd struggle not to decapitate him. No one touches my mate. NO ONE. She belongs to ME.

She's finally calmed when Dr. Whitmore enters. "Ah, our patient is awake."

Had I not been watching closely, I'd have missed it. I'm not certain I actually saw what I think I saw. It's impossible. Yet for one fleeting moment, Seraphina's eyes flashed golden - the unmistakable mark of a Guardian.

"Dr. Whitmore," she introduces herself.

"Seraphina."

"A pleasure, Seraphina. I've overseen your care since your arrival at Nightshade Pack. May I examine..." She trails off, noticing the disconnected IV.

"She removed it," I interject, observing their interaction.

Dr. Whitmore glances between us. "The IV contained only saline, vitamins, and liquid nutrition - nothing harmful. Medically, I recommend reinsertion. Would you permit me to place it in your other arm?"

I track Seraphina's darting gaze between the doctor and myself. Her distrust is palpable - she fears restraint but won't voice it. A flicker of terror surfaces before she masks it. I want her healthy, but more crucially, I need her trust.

"Are there alternatives, Doctor?" I ask. Seraphina's shoulders relax marginally.

Dr. Whitmore considers. "If Seraphina commits to eight ounces of water hourly - precisely hourly - and small meals every three to four hours, we could forego the IV. Do you agree, Seraphina?"

"Absolutely," she answers instantly.

"Very well. I'll prepare a tracking sheet. Alpha, who will monitor her?"

"I will." Her shock at my declaration is brief but telling.

"Yes, Alpha."

After completing her examination, Dr. Whitmore prepares the tracking forms. "Seraphina, noncompliance means reinstating the IV tomorrow. If you want it removed, adhere strictly to the regimen."

"My thanks, Doctor," I say, escorting her out. She hesitates as if to speak, then thinks better of it. "Until morning, Alpha."

Closing the door, I turn to my petite mate. "I imagine you'd appreciate a proper bath?"

###Chapter 0175

The moment Dr. Whitmore entered and spoke, I recognized her voice—the same one I'd heard while drifting in and out of consciousness. She had been talking to Sebastian while I was unconscious. Valeria surged forward, a growl rumbling in her chest, but I yanked her back. We couldn’t risk exposure. Sebastian’s gaze lingered on me, sharp and assessing, but he remained silent.

When the doctor suggested reconnecting the IV, my pulse spiked. The thought of being tethered again sent ice through my veins. I’d spent seven years as a prisoner—I couldn’t go back to that helplessness. Relief flooded me when Sebastian intervened, demanding alternatives. I’d do anything to avoid restraints.

After she left, tension eased from my shoulders—until Sebastian mentioned a bath.

A bath.

Hot water. Soaking until my muscles unknotted. The coven’s showers had been frigid, designed for vampires who didn’t feel the cold. I’d learned to scrub fast, teeth chattering. It had been years since I’d felt real warmth.

I studied him, weighing the offer against potential traps.

He exhaled roughly. "I’m not playing games. You’ve been running through forests, then trapped with vampires for years. A bath might help. There’s a shower too, but you’re still weak. Standing that long could be dangerous."

My gaze flicked to the adjoining bathroom. The temptation was unbearable. "Okay."

His smile hit me like a physical blow. The man was striking normally, but when he smiled? Devastating. He should do it more often.

"Need help getting there?"

Absolutely not. "I can manage."

He nodded and disappeared into the bathroom. The sound of running water followed. I pushed upright, dragging the sheet around myself before sliding off the bed. My legs buckled instantly. The floor rushed up to meet me—

Strong arms caught me mid-fall. Sebastian lifted me effortlessly, his expression torn between irritation and concern. "You’re determined to undo all my hard work, aren’t you? A broken nose wouldn’t heal with licking, and you’re already anemic."

I curled against him, painfully aware the sheet hadn’t followed. Naked, I pressed into his chest, desperate for modesty. He adjusted his grip, testing the water one-handed like I weighed nothing. The sheer strength left me stunned.

When he lowered me into the tub, a moan escaped before I could stop it. Bliss. The heat stung my newer wounds but melted the aches deep in my muscles. I hugged my knees to my chest, shielding myself—but his gaze never dropped. He was already rummaging through shampoo bottles, eyes glazed in a mind-link trance.

He set the bottles beside me, then moved to the door. I thought he was leaving, but he only pushed it halfway shut before returning. "Lean back."

I stiffened. "What?"

"Your hair’s a disaster. I’m washing it."

I hesitated. His sigh was heavy as his hands settled on my shoulders. I flinched, but he leaned close, voice low. "I won’t hurt you. You’re under my protection now. Relax."

###Chapter 0176

I can't let my guard down, but I obey, leaning back into the water. My gaze flicks up, searching for that same predatory hunger I saw in the vampires' eyes. But Sebastian's attention isn't on my body—it's fixed on my hair. Strange.

His palm cradles the back of my head, lifting it just above the surface. With his free hand, he scoops water and lets it cascade over my scalp. The rhythm is hypnotic, and against my will, the tension bleeds from my muscles. His focus is absolute—until he meets my stare and winks.

"Your eyes," he murmurs. "Like storm clouds over the ocean. I've never seen that shade before."

A gentle pressure urges me upright. He reaches for the bottles lining the tub's edge, sniffing each with increasing frustration before selecting one. Shampoo lathers between his palms before his fingers sink into my hair. The moment they massage my scalp, a whimper escapes me. It's been years since anyone touched me with kindness. The sensation is almost painful in its sweetness.

A clatter outside the door jolts me rigid. Sebastian doesn't pause. "Just the staff changing your sheets," he soothes, voice velvet-soft. "You deserve clean linens after this." The way he speaks—like I'm some skittish creature—makes my throat tighten.

"Lean back." Water sluices through my hair, his fingers combing out suds. When I resurface, conditioner follows, then the slow drag of a brush through snarled strands.

"Gorgeous," he breathes. "I've wondered about its true length."

"Past my waist, last I checked." My voice sounds foreign to my own ears. "No scissors in years."

"Would you like it cut?" His thumb grazes a knot. "Though I'll admit—I'm partial to long hair."

I twist to study him. There's something unsettling about how enthralled he seems by something as simple as hair. Another wink. This alpha is an enigma.

A washcloth appears in my periphery. "You can wash yourself while I finish here." His tone implies this will take a while.

I eye the unmarked bottles. Before I can choose, he plucks one free. "Try this." Vanilla blooms when I uncap it—pleasant, though I'd have picked something fruitier. Berries, maybe.

As he works, I scrub my arms, avoiding the worst of the scars. My wrists are a lattice of old wounds, the skin deceptively smooth over lingering tenderness. Higher up, the puncture marks from fangs ridge my shoulders. Disgust coils in my gut. How can he stand to look at me?

Tears hit the water before I realize they're falling. What if Valeria can't heal these? What if I'm forever marked by that monster's cruelty?

Sebastian stills the brush. His fingers tilt my chin up. "Scars mean you survived," he says, fierce as a vow. "They're proof you're stronger than whatever tried to break you. Wear them with pride, Seraphina. Few could endure what you have."

I nod, swiping at my cheeks. The water has cooled when he finally drains it, refilling the tub with fresh heat.

"Better?"

"Yes." My voice cracks. "It's been... a long time since I felt warm."

"Ask me anything." The invitation hangs between us.

I turn, meeting those ocean-deep eyes. "Why are you doing this?"

###Chapter 0177

Taking Seraphina into the bathroom, I sense her expectation—she thinks I'll do something inappropriate. So I deliberately avoid looking at her. Mostly.

Her body is already imprinted in my memory from when she was unconscious. Every protruding rib, the sharp angles of her hips, the way her shoulders are more bone than flesh. She's tiny, yes, but also starved. I can't wait to see her fill out. Dorian and I will make sure she never goes hungry again.

"Lean back," I instruct, starting to wash her hair. Her gaze burns into me, but I resist the urge to glance down. One meal hasn’t changed anything. Instead, I meet her eyes and wink.

She jerks in surprise.

The soft whimper she makes when my fingers massage her scalp sends warmth through me. Taking care of my mate feels right. Dorian purrs in approval as her body slowly relaxes under my touch.

I want to ask her more, but I won’t ruin this moment. For once, she isn’t tense, isn’t calculating an escape.

Then she asks the dangerous question: Why are you doing this?

Telling her we're mates isn’t an option—not when her wolf is still weak. Not when her past with Alphas is clearly traumatic. So I trust my instincts.

"You were injured. Dying when you stumbled into my territory." My voice stays steady. "Yes, you're a rogue, but you’ve suffered enough. Protecting those who can’t protect themselves is an Alpha’s duty—even to outsiders."

She frowns but stays silent.

Through the mind link, I thank the omegas and request two trays of food. Nathaniel will bring them up.

The salt of her tears hits me before I see them. She’s studying her scars—raised, uneven marks covering nearly every inch of her. To me, they’re proof of survival.

"Not many could’ve endured what you have," I say honestly. Her strength isn’t in her body but in her will. A reminder not to underestimate her.

Her hair, finally untangled, is impossibly long and silken. I stroke it longer than necessary, savoring the feel. She mentioned cutting it. I hope she doesn’t go too short.

Everything about her is striking. Hair so pale it’s beyond blonde. Eyes a foggy gray—not blue-gray or green-gray, just gray, like storm clouds. I only noticed when rinsing her hair, our faces close.

Standing, I offer a towel. "Need more time?"

"No." She shows me her pruned fingers. "Thank you."

I drain the tub and hold the towel open, giving her privacy as she stands before wrapping her in it and lifting her out.

"I can walk," she murmurs.

I raise a brow. "Last time you tried, you face-planted. Let’s get more food in you first."

###Chapter 0178

Seraphina nodded as we stepped into the room. Nathaniel entered carrying two trays. "Put them over there." I gestured toward the couch.

My jaw clenched as Nathaniel flashed Seraphina that charming smile. Dorian snarled in my mind. One more flirtatious glance and I'd rip his throat out.

"You're looking better, Seraphina." His voice dripped with warmth.

"Thank you, Nathaniel."

"That's all for tonight." My tone left no room for argument. If he didn't leave now, Dorian's growl would terrify our fragile mate. The bastard actually chuckled before turning. "Sleep well, Seraphina." He disappeared before I could retaliate.

I guided her to the bed first. The clothes Nathaniel brought were useless for sleeping. "Wait here."

In my room, I grabbed a shirt and drawstring shorts. The shorts would drown her, but the shirt would do. Dorian purred at the thought of her wrapped in my scent.

Returning, I helped her into the oversized shirt. The hem brushed her knees. "The shorts won't stay on."

"This is perfect." Her fingers clutched the fabric. "More than I've had in years."

Dorian's rage spiked. She hugged herself, drowning in my shirt, but I caught her subtly inhaling the scent. Good.

She picked at her food, eating barely enough to sustain a human, let alone a werewolf. At least she drank plenty of water.

Tucking her in, I sat beside her. Sleep already tugged at her eyelids.

"Dorian senses your wolf is dormant. Valeria?"

A shadow crossed her face. "Yes. She... saved me once. A vampire nearly drained me. But over time, we both weakened. Now I only hear her sometimes."

"As you heal, she'll strengthen too. We'll fix this."

Her sad smile made my chest ache. Did she doubt me? Or was there something worse she wasn't saying?

Once she slept, I slipped out. Dorian needed to run before he tore through the packhouse to reach her.

Nathaniel stood guard downstairs. "Wake me the second she stirs."

I shifted mid-leap off the porch. For hours, we raced through the territory. Patrols were alert—good. The vampire threat was real. I'd need to warn Adrian.

Returning at dawn, I dressed quietly. Then a scream shattered the silence.

Dorian took over before I could think. Fur erupted as we charged toward our mate's terror.

###Chapter 0179

The bath and meal left me utterly drained. I'm grateful Sebastian doesn't press me with more questions. The thought of Valeria growing stronger terrifies me—what if we're discovered? Yet, having my wolf back thrills me to the core. She's been more active since we woke, far more than in recent years. Maybe she'll regain enough strength for us to escape before Sebastian learns the truth.

I don't recall drifting off, but suddenly I'm back in that nightmare. The feeding room. The screams. The metallic stench of blood. My mind knows it's a dream, but my body reacts as if it's real. Prince Damien's crimson eyes lock onto me, his fangs glinting.

"You thought you could run?" His voice is a venomous snarl. "You're mine. Always mine." He seizes my head, wrenching my neck to the side. The pain explodes as his fangs pierce my skin.

I jolt upright, screaming, my hands flying to my throat. The phantom pain lingers. My cries don't stop until a massive wolf—golden fur gleaming in the moonlight—crashes through my door.

Dorian.

He leaps onto the bed, his warmth enveloping me, his forest scent drowning out the nightmare. I clutch his fur, burying my face against his neck. He settles over me like a living blanket.

"Is she alright, Alpha?" Nathaniel's voice comes from the doorway.

I can't respond. Can't let go. Dorian is my anchor.

Sebastian must have mind-linked him, because Nathaniel's footsteps retreat down the hall.

Dorian rumbles deep in his chest, a sound like a purr. It steadies my breathing. He nuzzles my face, my neck, patient as my death grip on him slowly eases.

When his heat finally melts the icy fear in my veins, I loosen my hold. "Sorry," I whisper into his fur.

He chuffs softly. As I calm, I realize just how enormous he is—larger than my father's wolf, his body longer than my human form. An Alpha's stature.

I lean back to meet his dark eyes. "You must be Dorian."

His tongue swipes my nose, making me giggle. I stroke his fur in the dim light. "You're enormous. And stunning." My fingers sink into the silken strands. "So soft." He nudges my hand insistently. I laugh. "You like that, huh?" A quiet woof answers me.

We stay like that—his weight grounding me. Then he whines, questioning.

"Just a nightmare." My voice cracks. "I was back there. In the feeding room." I swallow hard. "Prince Damien... he said he'd found me. That I belong to him." Dorian's growl vibrates through me. "I can't go back," I whisper.

He licks the tears from my cheeks until I'm calm again. There's something meditative about petting him, the rhythmic motion soothing my frayed nerves.

"I'm okay now," I murmur. "You don't have to stay."

He lifts his head, huffs at me, then licks my nose once more before resting his heavy skull on my chest. His presence says everything words can't: I'm not going anywhere.

###Chapter 0180

I smile, my fingers brushing against his neck before trailing down to his chest. "Thank you," I murmur, already slipping back into a dreamless sleep.

Morning light filters through the curtains when I wake, but the bed beside me is empty. The sheets still hold his warmth, though—Sebastian hasn’t been gone long. I push myself up, my body stiff but stronger than yesterday. The bathroom isn’t far, but the distance feels daunting.

Gritting my teeth, I slide off the bed, gripping the mattress for balance. My legs wobble, but they hold. One step. Then another.

The door swings open before I can take the third.

Sebastian strides in, damp hair curling at his nape, fresh from the shower. His eyes widen. "What the hell are you doing?"

Three long strides, and he’s scooping me up like I weigh nothing.

"I need to pee," I mutter, face heating.

"You couldn’t wait five minutes?" He shakes his head, carrying me toward the bathroom. "Dorian just jumped down. I thought you’d still be asleep."

He sets me in front of the toilet, then arches a brow when I don’t move.

"Out," I say flatly.

A smirk tugs at his lips. "I’ll be right outside. Call when you’re done."

He leaves the door cracked. Not ideal, but I’m desperate. The moment I finish, his voice drifts through the gap. "Done?"

"Yes."

He’s behind me before the faucet finishes running, hands steadying my hips as I wash up. "Dr. Whitmore’s coming by later. Food’s on the way. Bedrest today—no arguments." His tone brokers no debate.

"Are you leaving?" I turn, catching the tension in his jaw.

"Blackstone needs me. I’ve put off too much already." His thumb brushes my hipbone. "Nathaniel will check on you. Need anything to pass the time? Books? Music?" A teasing glint enters his eyes. "Knitting?"

I snort. "Knitting?"

"Covering all bases, sweetheart." That damn smile does things to my stomach.

"Books. Music. No yarn."

He nods, lifting me effortlessly. "Couch or bed?"

"Couch."

His lips thin, but he deposits me on the plush cushions anyway. "Be right back."

The door opens before he reaches it. Nathaniel strides in, balancing a tray. "Morning, Seraphina. You really know how to scare a man."

"Sorry," I mutter, not in the mood to relive last night.

"Don’t be." He sets the tray on my lap, settling beside me. His arm drapes over the couch behind me. "So. Guess we’re stuck together today."

Sebastian’s growl rattles the windows.

Nathaniel just grins wider as Sebastian storms out, the door slamming behind him.

###Chapter 0181

Nathaniel is testing my patience. He knows how protective I feel about my unclaimed mate. Logically, I understand he wouldn't dare cross that line, but his teasing makes it hard to remember.

'If he lays one finger on our mate, I'll rip his throat out.' Lucian's growl vibrates through my skull.

My wolf - the same ruthless predator who's torn through battlefields without mercy - has become utterly smitten with that fragile girl. The fiercest warrior I know has turned into a lovesick fool over our mate.

'She's flawless,' he insists for the hundredth time.

'You're pathetic. Next you'll be begging for belly rubs.' I shoot back. Though I can't deny he's managed to break through her defenses faster than I have.

'She prefers me. And if she wants to rub my belly, I'll gladly roll over.'

I nearly groan aloud.

Her terror of that vampire prince - Damien, she called him - runs bone-deep. Her grip on Lucian had been punishing, but my wolf reveled in being her protector. What shocked me was how readily she accepted his comfort, even welcoming him to guard her through the night.

Not that I'm complaining. Breathing in her scent, listening to her steady heartbeat, watching her sleep safely because of our presence - it filled me with primal satisfaction. I just hope someday she'll seek that comfort from me, the man, not just my wolf.

The city trip couldn't be postponed any longer. Several candidates needed my personal evaluation before joining the company. Normally I'd send Nathaniel, but this requires an Alpha's judgment.

She should be safe resting in bed. Both Nathaniel and Dr. Whitmore have strict orders to contact me immediately if anything changes.

Before leaving, I brought Seraphina a phone loaded with my playlists. No clue about her music preferences, but I'll discover them. The stack of books from our pack library might keep her occupied - another thing I'll tailor to her tastes later. I showed her how to use the speaker system, ensuring she could listen comfortably until my return.

The day dragged on endlessly. Lucian and I grew increasingly restless being separated from Seraphina. My repeated check-ins with Nathaniel confirmed she'd been eating, drinking, and regaining strength - even walking to the bathroom unaided. Impressive progress since this morning. Maybe proper nutrition is accelerating her healing.

Dusk had fallen when I finally returned to Nightshade territory. Pack members intercepted me with greetings and updates, but I politely excused myself, desperate to see my mate.

Taking the stairs two at a time, I burst into her room to find it empty. Panic spiked until I spotted her by the window.

"Would you like some fresh air?" My voice startled her. When she turned, my breath caught.

Her eyes.

For one electrifying moment, gray irises shimmered gold, shifting to an olive hue. The transformation lasted barely a heartbeat, but I saw it. I know exactly what it signifies.

She's a Guardian.

My pulse races. The Moon Goddess didn't just deliver my mate - she gifted me with a Guardian, the most formidable of all werewolves. The revelation staggers me. How can this delicate, timid creature be a warrior of legend?

Her fearful expression gives me pause. Is she afraid of my reaction? I school my features into calm. "I can take you outside if you'd like."

"No, I'm fine. How was your day?" Her quiet question draws me closer. After hours apart, her scent soothes like a healing balm.

"Productive. Though I hated being away from you." The honest admission slips out as my mind whirls. She's a Guardian - I'm certain of it. There's only one way to confirm...

###Chapter 0182

"Dorian mentioned you checked on me several times. That's very kind, though unnecessary. I'm recovering well."

"I can see that. You're standing and walking on your own now?"

She nods. "Only short distances, but yes, I can manage."


"That's excellent news. Have you eaten dinner?"

She shakes her head.

"I'll have them bring up two trays. I'll join you, if that's alright?"

"I was going to rest first. Maybe later?"

Perfect. "Sounds good. I'll shower and check what's for dinner." I watch as she makes her way back to bed. Her steps are unsteady but determined. I help her settle in before leaving.

In my room, I grab my phone and dial a number I haven't called in months. She answers on the second ring.

"Sebastian."

"Evelyn. I need your help."

"Anything. You know that."

"Come to the packhouse. Can you make it?"

"When?"

"Now?"

"I'll be there in forty minutes."

"Thank you."

"Sebastian... After everything, you're still family to me."

I smile. Of course she'd say that. "See you soon."

After showering, I check on Seraphina. Her eyes are closed, breathing deep.

Downstairs, I order dinner for three, anticipating Evelyn might be hungry. Right on cue, the front door knocks.

I open it to her familiar smile.

"Sebastian."

"Evelyn. Come in."

She steps inside, then turns with open arms. The hug feels different now—no lingering pain, just warmth. Like coming home.

Her scent has changed. I pull back, studying her face. "Congratulations?"

Her grin lights up the foyer. "Thank you! We just announced it. The scent change gave us away."

"Boy or girl?"

"Adrian insists it's a girl. Says she smells like honey already."

"I'll trust his nose."

Evelyn stands barely taller than Seraphina but with twice the muscle mass. Training four hours daily does that. Remembering our sparring sessions still makes my ribs ache. Seeing her size gives me hope for Seraphina's recovery.

"So, why am I here?"

"I want you to meet someone. She arrived two weeks ago, nearly dead from vampire captivity. Still recovering, so be gentle."

"Okay..." She draws out the word as we climb the stairs. "But why me?"

"She's special. I need your Guardian instincts. See if you sense what I can't."

Evelyn grabs my arm at the Alpha floor landing. "She's your mate, isn't she?"

I meet her gaze. "Yes. But she doesn't know yet. Her wolf's still too weak to recognize the bond."

"What exactly am I looking for?"

"Meet her first. I don't want to influence you."

At Seraphina's door, I block Evelyn momentarily. Seraphina sits up in bed, alert. "I brought someone to meet you. This is my friend Evelyn."

I step aside.

The moment their eyes meet, Seraphina's flare gold. "Selene," she breathes.

I turn to see Evelyn's eyes glowing silver. "Mother."

###Chapter 0183

Sebastian leaves, and I attempt to listen to his music. It's all aggressive beats and screaming vocals. I barely make it through two songs before giving up. Not knowing how to navigate the playlist, and not wanting to overstep, I abandon the device and reach for the books instead.

I read until exhaustion creeps in, then struggle to climb onto the bed. Nathaniel walks in just as I'm failing spectacularly at the simple task. He lifts me effortlessly onto the mattress.

"You realize I'm responsible for you, right?" His tone is light, but there's an edge to it. "If anything happens, Sebastian will have my head."

"Sorry," I murmur. "Just needed to rest."

Sleep claims me quickly. When I wake, Nathaniel brings food. My strength is returning, so I force myself to eat everything. The portions are still staggering compared to what I survived on in the vampire coven. Maybe once Valeria fully recovers, this won't feel like a feast.

After eating, I hear commotion outside and move to the window. Warriors train in the field behind the packhouse while mothers watch pups splash in the pool. The playground echoes with laughter. The scene is so... normal. Peaceful.

Maybe Sebastian truly is the good Alpha he claims to be. Though I once believed the same about Alpha Vincent, until my parents feared my Guardian blood would change everything.

Valeria? I reach out. You've been quiet.

Her presence stirs. I'm recovering. We'll be strong again soon.

We can't stay here. If Sebastian discovers what we are—

He won't force us, she interrupts. I want to stay.

My breath catches. That's reckless.

Is it? Her mental voice turns sharp. There's a bounty on us, remember? Where exactly would we go?

The door creaks open before I can respond. I turn instinctively—and freeze. Sebastian stands there, his gaze locked onto my eyes. Valeria's eyes.

I yank her back immediately.

Sebastian doesn't react. Maybe he didn't notice. Or maybe he doesn't recognize Guardian eyes. He asks about dinner, but exhaustion weighs me down. He leaves without pressing when I request more rest.

I wake to voices in the hallway—Sebastian and a woman. Valeria surges forward so violently it makes me gasp.

What's wrong with you?

She doesn't answer. The door opens. Sebastian enters, followed by—

"Selene," Valeria breathes, taking control of my voice.

The woman—Evelyn—gasps. "Mother."

Mother?! My mental scream goes unanswered as Evelyn/Selene crosses the room in a blur, crushing me in a tearful embrace.

I awkwardly pat her back while wrestling control from Valeria. "Someone explain. Now."

Evelyn pulls back, wiping her eyes. "I'm sorry. Sebastian didn't warn me." She glares at him. "You absolute asshole."

Sebastian holds up his hands. "I had suspicions. I didn't expect Valeria to just... appear." His gaze lands on me. "You've been keeping secrets, little wolf."

I look away, cheeks burning.

Evelyn takes my hand. "You can trust him. He's not like other Alphas." She glances at Sebastian. "Though he's clearly an idiot."

Sebastian's expression darkens. "Is that what you feared? That I'd force you?"

I shrug helplessly.

His growl rattles the windows. "Tell me. Did your family flee because Alpha Vincent tried to claim you?"

Evelyn answers before I can. "It's become common. Alphas force bonds with Guardians for power." Her voice turns bitter. "Only one Alpha in history refused—Alistair." She squeezes my fingers. "My mate's father."

###Chapter 0184

Sebastian stared at Evelyn in disbelief. "I'd like to say no honorable Alpha would force a mate bond for power, but it tracks. My pack is already the strongest in the country—I don’t need more power. But a weaker pack? A smaller one? They’d kill to have a Guardian."

Evelyn turned back to me. "Now that we’ve confirmed you can trust Sebastian, let’s return to your question. Valeria, you know you’re a Guardian, right?"

"Yes," I answered without hesitation.

"Do you know you descend from the Guardian line that began with Valeria?" she pressed.

I nodded. "I remember fragments from past lives. The clearest is that you, Selene, are my daughter. Born to Evander and Andra. You were the first Guardian ever born."

Sebastian held up a hand. "Wait—so you were Ivy Sinclair’s wolf before you were Seraphina’s?"

Evelyn shook her head. "It’s complicated. King Oberon explained it like this—the Guardian spirit reincarnates when both human and wolf die. The wolf finds their mate, and humans experience love in their own way. A mate bond, like Evander and Andra’s, ends when one dies. But the Guardian spirit retains memories. Not all of them, but enough. That’s why the Fae started recording our histories." Her face lit up. "Oberon will lose his mind when he finds out we’ve located you! He’s searched for thirteen years."

Sebastian’s growl was low. "Why would a Fae King care about a wolf Guardian?"

Evelyn met his gaze. "A century ago, Oberon was mated to the wolf who carried Valeria’s Guardian line. Her Alpha refused to release her and forced a mate bond. Though Oberon never got to be with her, he’s watched over her bloodline ever since."

A knock interrupted us. Nathaniel entered with a food cart, freezing when he spotted Evelyn.

"Luna? I didn’t realize you were here. Good to see you."

Evelyn hopped up, grinning. "So formal, Beta. It’s just Evelyn, like always."

"You as well," he said, though his tone was flat. His eyes darted between Evelyn, Sebastian, and me.

Sebastian grabbed a tray and brought it to me. "Eat while we talk. You’re recovering fast, but I want you stronger."

Evelyn took a tray, and Nathaniel inhaled sharply. "Luna… is there news you’d like to share?"

She beamed. "Adrian won’t mind—it’s obvious anyway. We’re expecting our first Alpha heir in five months."

"Congratulations." Nathaniel hugged her stiffly. "Please tell Adrian the pack is happy for you both." His gaze flicked to Sebastian, but Sebastian was focused on me.

"You’re not eating," he murmured.

I quickly picked up my fork. He smiled before grabbing the last tray.

Once Nathaniel left and everyone was seated again, Evelyn leaned forward.

"I don’t want to overwhelm you, but there’s so much to discuss. My father will be thrilled to see you." She paused. "Valeria, when do you think you’ll be strong enough to visit our pack for dinner?"

Sebastian cut in. "She was nearly dead two weeks ago, Evelyn. She’s not ready for social calls."

Evelyn rolled her eyes. "She’s a Guardian with accelerated healing. Oberon taught me that. She’ll bounce back faster than you think." She turned to me. "So? How long?"

Valeria hesitated. ‘Should I answer in front of the Alpha?’

‘He already knows we’re a Guardian. And your daughter—still weird to say—trusts him.’

"I’ll be strong enough for light activity tomorrow. Shifting will take a few more days."

Evelyn nodded. "Same as Selene and me when we healed. Tomorrow’s Thursday—Adrian, Alistair, and I always have dinner with my father. You should come. He’ll be ecstatic we found you."

I glanced at Sebastian.

"If you feel ready, meeting another Guardian could help your recovery," he said. Then, to Evelyn: "I also need to speak with all of you. There might be a war coming. I’ll need your help."

###Chapter 0185

Two mysteries solved. Seraphina is undoubtedly a Guardian, and her parents fled their pack to protect her from forced mating bonds.

While I'm grateful for these answers, and Evelyn's excitement is palpable, my mate still needs recovery time. "We'll join you for dinner tomorrow," I say firmly. "But that's enough for tonight. Seraphina needs rest to regain her strength."

"Of course," Evelyn nods. Then her expression shifts. "Before I leave - have you been running all this time? Adrian mentioned something about vampires."

I glance at Seraphina. This is her story to share. "I was kept prisoner by vampires," she whispers.

Evelyn's smile vanishes. "What?" Her eyes dart between us. "Kept prisoner how?"

"A vampire prince used me as his personal blood supply for seven years."

Evelyn's hand flies to her mouth. "But werewolf blood repels vampires."

Seraphina shrugs. "The one who captured me - Malachi - called me 'custos regni' when he tasted my blood."

Evelyn pales dramatically. "Do you know Oberon?" she demands.

I shake my head.

"Custos Regni means 'Guardian of the Realm'," Evelyn explains, instinctively cradling her pregnant belly. "They know about us. And our blood... it must be irresistible to them."

"More than irresistible," Seraphina adds darkly. "I think he became addicted. No one else was permitted to feed from me. No one could touch me except during one royal visit. His exact words were that no one could 'taint' me." Her voice drops. "That's the only reason I wasn't raped like the others in that hellhole."

A savage growl tears from my throat. That bastard will pay for every drop of blood he took from her.

"I need to leave," Evelyn says, looking queasy. "I must contact Oberon before tomorrow's dinner." She turns to me, eyes blazing. "If those leeches think they can take Seraphina, they'll face the fight of their immortal lives. Our pack stands with you. Adrian and Alistair would never risk me or the baby, though I hope Adrian doesn't overreact and confine me." She rises, shaking her head.

She embraces Seraphina again. "Meeting you was everything I hoped. You're safe here now, I promise." Her eyes meet mine, seeking confirmation. I nod.

"I'll walk you out."

We move silently to her car. At the driver's door, she turns. "She doesn't know you're mates yet." A statement, not a question.

"Not yet. I'm hoping Valeria will recognize Dorian when she's stronger."

Evelyn grips my wrist. "I knew Adrian was my mate before Selene confirmed it. Be her safe place. Even if the recognition takes time, she'll feel the bond."

I kiss her forehead. "I'm trying."

As she slides into the car, she asks, "Anything I should know about Victor before I go?"

"He claims remorse and offers penance for what he did to you. But still denies killing my mother."

Her brow furrows. "Why deny that?"

"No idea. But I won't stop until I have the truth."

She smiles up at me. "I'm glad you found your mate. She'll be your anchor."

I watch her taillights disappear before returning to Seraphina.

She's asleep when I reenter the bedroom. Seizing the opportunity, I head to my first-floor office. Nathaniel is waiting behind my desk.

"How'd it go with Evelyn?" he asks, vacating my chair.

"Better than expected," I reply, taking my seat.

"Really? No lingering feelings? No drama?"

I study him. Without a mate bond, he can't understand. "None. It's like... she could never compare to Seraphina. The mate pull is terrifying in its intensity." I pause. "Does that make sense?"

"Not a bit," he admits. "But I trust you. Maybe someday I'll find my mate and understand."

###Chapter 0186

"I truly hope you do. She's someone worth every second of waiting, trust me."

We dive into work, tackling the backlog that's been piling up in my absence. Nathaniel is a capable Beta who can seamlessly step into the Alpha role when needed, but he's meticulously documented every decision made while I was gone. It's reassuring to see the pack functioning smoothly despite everything. I update him on the company's progress and the new hires I brought in during my time away.

Just as we're about to take a break for drinks, I hear it—Seraphina's bone-chilling scream.

I'm out the door and up three flights of stairs in an instant, bursting into her room. Her eyes meet mine, haunted and wide with terror. When I step closer, she flinches away. Damn it.

Shift. She isn’t afraid of me. Dorian urges.

Without hesitation, I shift, shredding my clothes in the process. Dorian leaps onto the bed, and Seraphina immediately clings to him, her grip desperate. He settles over her just like last night, his massive frame pressing gently against hers.

Nathaniel's voice echoes through the mind link. "Do you need anything, Alpha?"

"No. Another nightmare. Keep everyone off this floor."

"You know you’ll have to address the rumors soon. The pack is buzzing."

I know. For the first time in my life, I’ve had a female secluded on my private floor for nearly two weeks—unseen by anyone. And now that Evelyn has visited, the speculation will only grow wilder.

Seraphina trembles violently, her bones pressing sharply into Dorian’s body despite his thick fur. He starts purring, the deep vibrations soothing her like before. Slowly, her death grip on his fur loosens, her breathing steadies, and she whispers, "I'm sorry," just like last night.

She has nothing to apologize for. The horrors she endured—I can’t even fathom them. Anger surges through me. I should have found her sooner. Logically, I know searching a vampire coven for my mate would’ve been madness, but the guilt still claws at me. I’m her mate. I was supposed to protect her.

As we lie there, listening to her heartbeat slow, I recall Evelyn’s words. The vampires knew about the Guardians. Worse, they seemed to relish their blood. If King Oberon’s records hold any clues about this, we need them. The last thing I want is every vampire in the country hunting my mate.

Dorian licks her face. 'I don’t like when mate cries.'

"It's okay, Dorian. I'm okay," she murmurs, stroking his fur. I savor the sensation of her fingers running through it as much as he does. One day, I hope she touches me like this.

Dorian nudges her with his nose, the same way that coaxed her to talk last night. I need to know what’s haunting her.

"Another nightmare," she admits, pausing as Dorian nuzzles her. A soft laugh escapes her before she continues. "There was another girl in the coven with me. The vampire I told you about—Malachi, the one who brought me to Prince Damien—was rewarded with his pick of 'fresh food.' That’s what they called the humans brought in daily. She was the only other one they kept alive. Malachi didn’t share her, but he... hurt her every day."

Her voice wavers. "We made eye contact once. After that, we’d mouth words to each other at night. Just a way to say, You’re not alone. Someone here cares."

Tears spill down her cheeks again. "In my dream, Prince Damien killed her because I fought him. I watched them tear her apart in front of me." Her sobs return, and Dorian whines, pressing closer.

I need to speak to her. Dorian agrees.

I shift back, careful not to crush her, then pull the blanket over myself before drawing her into my arms. She stiffens the second she realizes it’s me.

"What are you doing?" she asks, voice tight.

"Shhh. I just want to talk to you."

###Chapter 0187

The nightmare still clung to me like a second skin. Watching those vampires tear Genevieve apart had been pure torture. Prince Damien's crimson eyes burned into my memory, his gaze locking onto mine with terrifying intensity. Even though I knew it was just a dream, the screams, the metallic scent of blood, the sickening sounds of flesh rending—it all felt too real. My chest tightened with the desperate hope that somehow, Genevieve had escaped.

It took several shuddering breaths before I could ground myself in reality. The soft sheets beneath me, the faint scent of pine and leather that permeated Sebastian's room, the steady warmth at my back. Wait—warmth?

My entire body went rigid. When had he shifted back? Why?

"I need to talk to you." His voice was low, rough with sleep. One hand carded gently through my hair while the other rested possessively on my hip, pulling me flush against him. The contact should have made me recoil—just like Prince Damien's touch always had—but instead, I found myself acutely aware of the hard planes of Sebastian's chest beneath my palm. The urge to explore those ridges and valleys, to see if I could elicit the same shiver from him that Dorian gave when I scratched behind his ears, was almost overwhelming.

"About what?" I managed to keep my voice steady.

"I don't want to upset you further, so tell me if it's too much." His thumb traced absent circles on my hipbone. "But I need to know about the other girl you mentioned."

So I told him. About Genevieve. About our secret alliance in that hellhole, the whispered plans, how she'd shoved me toward the trees with a hissed "Run!" when the hunters came. Sebastian stayed silent throughout, his breathing even. When I finished, I tilted my head back to find him staring at the ceiling, jaw clenched.

"What?" I prodded.

His eyes met mine briefly before returning to the ceiling. "When we first learned about the bounty on you, there was another one—for a human girl. I was too focused on you to pay it much mind then. But now... I think it might have been Genevieve."

I bolted upright, bracing on one elbow to study his face. "It had to be her. We were the only ones who lasted more than a few days. Who else would they care enough to hunt?" The tears came hot and fast. "Do you... do you think they caught her?"

Sebastian cupped my cheek, calloused fingers wiping away the moisture. "I don't know. Can you tell me anything about her? Where she was from? Where she might have gone?" I was already shaking my head before he finished.

"I thought she'd be safe with the hunters. I was so worried about myself, about what they'd do if they found out what I am..." My voice cracked. "I should have thought about her. Why didn't I realize she was in just as much danger?"

"Hey." He caught my chin, forcing my gaze to his. "Tell me everything. What she looked like, how tall she was, anything that could help me find her. I'll put the word out. And I'll check if the bounty's still active—if it is, that means she's still free. We can reach her first."

I searched his face. "You'd do that? For a human? For a stranger?"

The intensity in his eyes stole my breath. "I'd do it because she needs help, and protecting the vulnerable is an Alpha's duty. But more than that—she helped you when no one else would. Helped you escape, kept your secret." His thumb brushed my lower lip. "That makes her pack."

###Chapter 0188

My fingers brush against his stubble as I cradle his face. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me yet." His voice is rough with sleep. "You've given me barely any clues, but I'll figure it out."

I nestle back against his chest. The warmth of his body and the earthy scent clinging to his skin lull me into a deep sleep.

Morning light floods the room when I wake. Something firm presses against my abdomen. For a blissful moment, I don't remember where I am. Then realization hits - I'm sprawled entirely atop Sebastian. My cheek rests on his pectoral, my legs tangled with his. And that persistent pressure against my stomach-

I bolt upright with a gasp. Holy hell. That's definitely not his belt buckle.

My sudden movement wakes him. In one fluid motion, he flips us over, pinning me beneath him. His lips find my neck, sending electric shocks down my spine. Valeria purrs in approval as his tongue traces my pulse point.

"Sebastian?"

"Mmm?" His teeth graze my collarbone. "Ready for round two?"

"SEBASTIAN!"

He jerks back like I've burned him. Recognition flashes in his eyes. "Shit. Seraphina, I'm sorry. I was half-asleep and-"

"It's fine." My cheeks could melt steel.

He sits up, running hands through his wild curls. The gesture only makes him look more deliciously disheveled. When he turns, the morning light sculpts every muscle of his bare torso. My fingers itch to trace the ridges of his abs.

Then he stands.

Every coherent thought evaporates. The man is gloriously, unapologetically naked. And from what I can see of his backside, the front view must be... impressive.

He catches me staring and smirks. "Like what you see, little guardian?"

Oh goddess, yes. "I'm going to shower," I blurt instead.

"Good plan." He stretches lazily. "We'll skip shopping since we're dining with Blackthorn Pack tonight. I'll give you a tour of Nightshade territory instead."

I nod vigorously while studying the ceiling. The floor. The wall. Anywhere but at the walking temptation currently sauntering toward me.

He stops inches away, pressing a kiss to my forehead. My traitorous eyes flick downward.

Oh.

My.

Goddess.

That explains the pressure against my stomach. The man is... generously proportioned.

Sebastian chuckles at my stunned expression. "Twenty minutes. I'll have breakfast sent up." His eyebrow arches. "Unless you need assistance washing your back?"

I squeak and bolt for the bathroom. His deep laughter follows me down the hallway.
###Chapter 0189

My delicate mate straddles me, moving with the grace of a celestial being. The wicked glint in her eyes as she controls our rhythm sends fire through my veins. Her intoxicating scent drowns me in pleasure I've never known existed. My soulmate, my entire world, is here surrendering to our connection.

A groan escapes me when she collapses onto the mattress. In an instant I'm over her, claiming her neck with desperate kisses. Her sweetness is addictive - a flavor I'd been starved of my entire existence.

"Sebastian?" That voice. Hearing my name from her lips nearly undoes me completely.

I growl against her skin. "Again, my love?" My body throbs with need.

"SEBASTIAN!"

The panic in her tone jolts me awake. Reality slams into me as I find my mate pinned beneath me, her eyes wide with shock and lingering desire.

I leap backward so fast I nearly crash into the wall. Fuck. What did I do in my sleep? Did I hurt her? Goddess above, if I forced myself on her I'll never forgive myself.

Her reassurance comes like oxygen to drowning lungs. Just a dream. A fucking incredible dream that leaves me painfully aroused. I need space before I do something reckless.

Standing at the foot of the bed, I catch her stealing glances at my body. My warriors train relentlessly under my command, and I hold myself to higher standards. Genetics and discipline have sculpted me into the Alpha my pack deserves.

The way her gaze lingers makes my blood sing. When she suddenly finds the ceiling fascinating, I can't resist teasing her. I approach slowly, careful not to make contact. One touch and I might lose control.

Our height difference puts me at eye level with her collarbones. I catch her peeking again and smirk. "See something you like, little mate?"

The way she scrambles for the bathroom when I offer to join her showers sends warmth through my chest. For the first time in memory, I feel... light.

Under the spray of cold water, I relive every second of that dream. My release comes violently. Fuck. She needs to recognize our bond soon. The vampire trauma complicates things, but I need to know she feels this connection too.

Breakfast reveals her in oversized clothing, carefully covering every scar. My chest tightens at her self-consciousness. When I suggest exploring pack lands, her radiant smile could power cities. I'd move mountains to keep that expression on her face.

The packhouse buzzes with activity when we descend. Every head turns as members finally glimpse the woman I've kept secluded for weeks. She-wolves approach under guise of greeting me, their assessing glances obvious.

Seraphina remains polite but withdrawn through countless introductions. I see the doubt in my pack's eyes - they expected a fierce Luna, not this fragile beauty. But they don't know her strength yet. When she heals, when Valeria emerges fully, they'll understand why the Moon Goddess chose her for me.

###Chapter 0190

The crisp autumn air greets us as we step outside. I gesture toward the sprawling grounds of our territory.

The training fields catch her attention first. "We'll get you started there soon," I promise. Beyond them lies the pups' playground, then the communal pool area with its outdoor kitchen—perfect for pack gatherings.

I point toward the winding forest trails where our wolves run free. When we reach the tree line, I pause.

"There's something I want to show you," I say, watching her curious expression. "It's a bit far though. Would you ride with Dorian? You're light—he won't even notice your weight."

Seraphina hesitates briefly before nodding. Inside my mind, Dorian practically vibrates with excitement.

'She's a Guardian,' he reminds me. 'Even weakened, she's formidable. Our mate deserves to see our strength.'

I strip quickly, catching the faint blush coloring her cheeks before she turns away. After shifting, Dorian collects my clothes with his teeth and struts—there's no other word for it—toward Seraphina.

He nudges her arm gently, depositing the bundle before rubbing his massive head against her side.

Her musical laugh fills the air as she strokes his fur. "Hello Dorian. You're sure about this?"

In response, he lowers himself to the ground. She climbs aboard carefully, and the moment she's settled, we're off.

Her initial gasp of surprise quickly transforms into delighted laughter as the wind whips through her hair. Dorian maintains a careful but swift pace until the thunderous roar of water announces our destination.

He kneels to let her dismount, then I shift back. True to her considerate nature, Seraphina keeps her back turned while extending my clothes over her shoulder.

Once dressed, I join her at the water's edge.

"These are the Nightshade Falls," I explain, guiding her toward the crystalline pool. "The heart of our territory."

Her eyes widen at the cascading water. "It's breathtaking."

I test the temperature with my toes. "Too cold for swimming now, but in summer, this place is packed." Leading her along the shore, I help her scale the rocky outcropping beside the falls.

The view from the summit steals her breath. Below us, the canyon stretches endlessly.

I point across the chasm. "That's Blackthorn Pack territory—Adrian and Evelyn's lands. Our borders meet here, which makes alliance convenient."

Movement catches my eye—our patrols running the perimeter. "See those wolves? Our borders are guarded constantly." I indicate corresponding shapes in the distance. "And those are Blackthorn sentries. They maintain the same vigilance."

Turning to Seraphina, I cup her face. "I brought you here so you'd understand—you're safe now. No vampire will reach you in Nightshade territory."

Her brow furrows. "You increased patrols...for me?"

"Of course." My thumb brushes her cheek. "You've endured enough. Here, you can finally breathe easy."

The unspoken questions in her eyes make me ache for our completed bond. Soon, I'll hear her thoughts. For now, I settle for her tentative trust.

"We should head back," I say after a comfortable silence. "You'll want to freshen up before dinner—Blackthorn's a thirty-minute drive."

Dorian carries her home with equal care, her arms wrapped securely around his neck. Her joyful laughter echoes through the trees, a sound I could happily spend eternity hearing.

###Chapter 0191

I can't comprehend why Sebastian would go to such lengths for me. Doubling patrol shifts, offering shelter, promising new clothes, providing meals, arranging medical care. No one does all that out of pure charity. If kindness alone solved problems, my family wouldn't have suffered as rogues for years.

His motives remain unclear, but his concern for my safety feels genuine.

"I believe him." Valeria insists. "His scent carried no deception during your conversation."

"You trust him? We barely know him, Valeria."

I sense her restless energy in my mind. 'Valeria?'

'Something about them feels right. I trust them both.'

With a sigh, I relent. If Valeria trusts them, and Evelyn and Selene do too, I'll follow their lead. But I'll find ways to repay Sebastian for everything.

Dressing carefully, I choose clothes that conceal my scars and leave my hair loose to hide my neck. I'd considered cutting it, but Sebastian mentioned liking it long. His fingers running through it last night had felt surprisingly nice.

Approaching his slightly ajar door, I raise my hand to knock when it swings open violently. Sebastian nearly bowls me over but catches me just in time. "Damn it, Seraphina! You okay?" His arm snakes around my waist, lifting me effortlessly until we're face to face. His other hand braces against the doorframe, preventing our fall.

His sage-green eyes hold me captive. My pulse races - from the near accident or our sudden closeness, I can't tell.

Heat radiates from his body as my hands rest against his solid chest. Every inch of him feels sculpted from marble.

"Sweetheart, you need to stop looking at me like that."

"Like what?" My tongue darts out to moisten my lips.

His gaze tracks the movement before returning to mine, his pupils noticeably dilated.

"Like you're deciding where to take your first bite." His voice drops an octave, equal parts velvet and gravel.

I stare at his mouth. The truth is, I do want to taste him. His intoxicating scent clouds my judgment as I bridge the distance, my tongue tracing the seam of his lips.

His entire body tenses. One arm crushes me closer while his other hand tangles in my hair, tilting my head for better access. When his tongue meets mine, electric currents race down my spine. My eyes flutter closed as he deepens the kiss. He tastes like crisp mountain air and golden sunlight - an impossible combination that somehow fits him perfectly.

The soft whimpers I hear shock me - they're mine. Sebastian's answering growls vibrate through my chest as his tongue dances with mine. The sound makes my nipples peak and sends liquid heat pooling between my thighs. An unfamiliar pressure builds as I instinctively wrap my legs around his waist.

He breaks the kiss abruptly, nostrils flaring at my scent. Forehead pressed to mine, he rasps, "We have to stop, sweetheart."

Mortification floods me. Of course he'd reject me - my scarred body against his perfection. He could have anyone.

As I try to disentangle myself, he tightens his grip. "This isn't rejection." His fingers tilt my chin up. "I want everything we're starting here. But you're not ready for what I need to give you, and once we begin, I won't stop." His thumb brushes my swollen lips. "When you're ready, I'll take my time exploring every inch of you, showing you pleasures you've never imagined."

His words reignite the fire in my core. His nostrils flare again. "Fuck, if you keep smelling like that, dinner's canceled." Slowly lowering me, his hardened length drags against me, drawing a gasp. Once my feet touch ground, he nuzzles my ear. "Wanted you to feel that, in case you doubted how badly I want you."

###Chapter 0192

A shiver runs down my spine as Sebastian nuzzles along my jawline, his lips brushing the corner of my mouth.

He rises, gripping my hand while adjusting his jeans with the other. Steering me downstairs, he positions himself protectively behind me as his pack members swarm near. With effortless authority, he informs them we have prior commitments but will return later for any urgent matters.

The massive black truck awaits outside. Sebastian swings open the passenger door, lifting me effortlessly onto the leather seat. His fingers brush my thigh as he buckles my seatbelt. That playful wink sends heat flooding my cheeks before he shuts the door with a soft click.

My last car ride involved vampire captors and a suffocating trunk. Before that? A lifetime ago in Colorado's mountains. The normalcy of this moment feels surreal.

As we drive, I study the unfamiliar landscape. Lush greenery replaces snowy pines, the humid air clinging to my skin. So different from my childhood pack's territory.

I turn to Sebastian. "Aren't I distracting you from pack duties?"

His calloused hand engulfs mine, bringing my knuckles to his lips. "Nightshade Pack spans seven states. 832 members. 27 expecting mothers." He places our joined hands on his muscular thigh. "The work never stops. You're not a distraction - you're the first thing that's made it bearable in years."

"How long have you been Alpha?" The question slips out before I can stop it.

Muscles tense along his jaw. I start to retract the question when his thumb strokes my palm. "I promised you honesty." His voice drops. "Just know some answers come with shadows."

The steering wheel creaks under his grip. "To understand, we go back to when I was six. Another pack attacked for our lands and numbers. My father killed their Alpha..." His throat works. "But not before they murdered my mother."

My hand flies to my mouth. That hollow ache - I know it too well.

Sebastian's knuckles graze my damp cheek. "Father... broke. Moved out of the packhouse. His Beta - Nathaniel's father - essentially ran Nightshade until I turned ten." His grip tightens. "That's when they started training me. By sixteen, I'd been making pack decisions for six years."

The truck's engine hums as he continues. "Father died the day after my birthday. No illness. No warning. Just... gone." A bitter chuckle. "My Alpha ceremony happened at his funeral. No celebration. Just obligation."

I twist our fingers together, thumb tracing the scars on his knuckles. Twenty-five years old with fifteen years of leadership weighing on those broad shoulders.

"Aren't you exhausted?" The words escape in a whisper.

His answering smile doesn't reach those stormy eyes. "Every damn day. Until you." The truck slows as we reach a stoplight. He turns, capturing my gaze. "You're the first light in that darkness, Seraphina."

The way he says my name - like a prayer and a promise - steals my breath.

###Chapter 0193

Opening up to Seraphina felt terrifying yet exhilarating. She's my fated mate. I crave to know every thought in her mind, every secret in her heart.

That hallway moment proved she's feeling the mate pull too, even if she doesn't understand the sensation yet.

Everything about my Seraphina intoxicates me. Beyond her honeyed scent and addictive taste, the mere idea of sharing my burdens with someone after all these lonely years? It's almost more than I dare believe.

We reached the Sinclair residence five minutes early. I'd brought two bottles of Cabernet since Evelyn hadn't specified any contributions.

Circling the truck, I helped Seraphina down. Her petite frame makes even simple exits challenging, but truthfully? I'll seize any excuse to touch her. Our fingers remained entwined as we approached the front door.

Muffled voices carried through the wood. Gregory's gruff "Who's here?" blended with Evelyn's cheerful "I'll get it!"

The door swung open to reveal Evelyn's beaming face. "You made it! Come in, come in."

We followed her into the kitchen where Evelyn positioned herself before Seraphina. "Dad, we've got company tonight," she announced.

Gregory's gaze found me first. "Sebastian! Been too long," he said, maneuvering his wheelchair toward us.

"And someone special," Evelyn added, stepping aside to reveal my mate.

Evander surged forward instantly. "Valeria?" His gravelly voice cracked.

"Evander." Valeria responded through Seraphina. "I go by Valeria now."

"Valeria." Gregory whispered the name like a prayer, eyes glistening. "Where... all these years... I thought you were..."

Seraphina knelt before his chair. "We'll talk tonight. But first - Lily left you a message."

Gregory's calloused hand covered his mouth, dragging downward roughly. "From Lily?" His whisper trembled.

"You understand how Guardian spirits work? I inherit memories, but not all at once. Some surface when I meet certain people - like with Evelyn yesterday... and now you." Gregory's eyes darted to his daughter before locking onto Seraphina again.

Gregory grasped Seraphina's hand. "What did she say?"

Valeria covered their joined hands with her free one. "She knew. That final battle? The Moon Goddess warned her days before. She traded her life for yours. The attack was meant to claim you, but she knew you'd survive for Evelyn and Selene. Her sacrifice was deliberate."

I watched Alistair move to Gregory's side, gripping his shoulder. The devastated look on Gregory's face... How would I react if Seraphina made that choice for me? Because once she accepts our bond, she absolutely would.

"If you'll excuse me..." Gregory wheeled away abruptly, disappearing down the hall.

Seraphina rose, seeking me out. "Was that wrong? Lily wanted him to know." Her uncertain gaze demanded both reassurance and validation.

Cradling her face, I murmured, "Thirteen years wondering about her Guardian... and now he learns not only of Valeria's return, but that Lily chose death for him. It's overwhelming." My attention shifted to where Adrian cradled a weeping Evelyn against his chest.

###Chapter 0194

Adrian's gaze meets mine, and an unspoken understanding passes between us. These Guardians—these remarkable women—sacrifice everything for those they love. It's a burden neither of us wants Evelyn to bear. I make a mental note to speak with him later, to see if he's found a way to shield her from that fate.

Alistair moves to follow Gregory. Their bond runs deep, forged over decades of friendship. I pull Seraphina close, pressing a kiss to her forehead. "Let's open the wine. Would you like some?"

Evelyn wipes her eyes. "I'm sorry. Learning what my mother did for me... it's overwhelming."

Adrian brushes his thumbs across her cheeks, catching fresh tears. "Knowing someone you love would give their life for yours... that weight never gets lighter." His words carry history—this isn't the first time they've had this conversation. Definitely need to corner him about it later.

Evelyn extends her hand. "None for me, but I'll pour for everyone."

Seraphina steps back with a small shrug. "I've actually never tried wine before." She accepts the bottle from me with a curious glance. "Never had the opportunity."

I slide my hand to the small of her back. "Why not sample both? I brought red and white since I didn't know the menu."

Adrian flashes a grin. "Thursday's always steak night—a tradition our fathers kept for years. I only got invited after Evelyn and I started dating."

"Joke's on you, Alpha," Evelyn counters, eyes sparkling. "Tonight it's ribs." The love between them is palpable. My chest tightens as I glance at Seraphina. That's what I want for us.

"Congratulations are in order, I hear," I say to Adrian.

"Damn right." He passes glasses to Seraphina and me. "Can't wait to meet my little Peanut. Did Evelyn tell you we're having a girl?" Behind him, Evelyn rolls her eyes skyward.

"We don't know that yet," she protests. Adrian mouths 'It's a girl' at us with exaggerated secrecy.

Gregory and Alistair return, the former's eyes red-rimmed. He looks wrecked—like he's cried himself hollow.

Seraphina approaches him. "I'm so—"

He cuts her off gently. "Don't be. Ivy wanted me to know. It explains... a lot about her final days." He straightens, voice thickening. "Before dinner, I need you to understand how grateful I am you found us. The bond you shared as Andra is different now—Evander senses it—but the family tie remains. Does Valeria feel it too?" At Seraphina's nod, he continues, "Good. You're not alone anymore. However long you were lost, whatever happened... this is your family now." His gesture encompasses the room.

Tears glisten in Seraphina's eyes as everyone murmurs agreement. I move to her side, fingers threading through her hair. She leans into my touch with a shaky breath. "I'm okay. It's just... been years since I belonged anywhere."

###Chapter 0195

I never expected dinner at Evelyn's place to hit me this hard. Emotions swirl like a storm inside me, memories I'd buried deep now clawing their way to the surface. It's too much.

Sebastian's steady presence anchors me. His hand never leaves my back for long. Every time I shift away, he closes the distance again, fingers brushing my waist. I don't protest. His touch is the only thing keeping me from drowning in this unfamiliar sea.

"Alistair, the ribs need carving. Evelyn, is everything else ready?" Gregory asks.

"Table's set," Evelyn answers, nodding toward the spread. "Those ribs have been slow-cooking since noon. They'll melt in your mouth."

I trail her into the kitchen. "Where do you need me?"

Adrian pulls golden-brown twice-baked potatoes from the oven while a bubbling vegetable casserole and mac and cheese send savory tendrils through the air.

"Smells incredible," Sebastian murmurs in my ear, palm settling on my hip.

Evelyn thrusts serving platters into our hands. "Set these out."

We're arranging dishes when Gregory and Alpha Alistair enter bearing a mountain of glistening ribs. The men take their seats—Gregory and Alistair at the heads, Evelyn and I flanking Gregory, Adrian and Sebastian across from us beside Alistair.

Alistair clears his throat. "Seraphina, we haven't been properly introduced. I'm Alpha Alistair Grey, former leader of Blackthorn Pack. This is my son Adrian, your current Alpha."

"Pleasure," I say, watching in awe as all four men heap their plates impossibly high. Evelyn loads hers nearly as much. My modest portion looks laughable beside theirs. No wonder Sebastian's always nagging me to eat more.

Gregory catches my stare. "Take as much as you want. There's plenty."

"I'm good, thanks." I bite into a rib—and freeze. The rich, gamey flavor explodes across my tongue, catapulting me back to campfires under starry skies.

"This is bear meat."

Every head swivels toward me. Adrian's fork hovers midair. "You recognize bear?"

I hesitate. Three Alphas at one table isn't the place for rogue confessions. "My family spent six years as rogues. My father hunted bear when he could—one kill fed us for days." I brace for disgust, but only curiosity meets me.

Gregory leans forward. "Your father must've been formidable to take down multiple bears."

"Lead warrior in our old pack. After we left, Alpha Vincent hunted us relentlessly. We kept moving until..." I swallow hard. "Until my father's friend Tobias found us. Understood why we'd run."

Alistair's brows knit. "How did his involvement help?"

I explain about the hidden cabin, the burner phone, Tobias's warnings about search parties. "We had a few peaceful years before... before it all ended."

Gregory's calloused hand covers mine. "Let's save the heavy talk for after dessert." Grateful, I nod. Even now, the memories stick in my throat like dry bread.

The silence stretches until I grab another rib. "So who bagged this bear?"

No one answers.

I look up to find every eye locked on Sebastian. His jaw tenses.

###Chapter 0196

Sebastian's gaze locks onto mine. "I did."

My brows knit together. "You hunted a bear and gave it to Evelyn and Gregory?" That makes no sense. Why wouldn't he take it to his own pack?

Adrian lounges in his chair, that infuriating smirk playing on his lips. Sebastian shoots him a glare before facing me again. "Dorian killed it for Selene."

I glance at Evelyn, who's watching Sebastian with an unreadable expression. This doesn't add up. Why would he do that when Evelyn is clearly mated to Adrian?

"Sebastian was courting Evelyn before we found each other," Adrian announces, still smirking. The low growl from Sebastian's chest makes my pulse spike.

"Adrian!" Evelyn scolds, swatting his arm.

A hot flare of jealousy licks through me, though I have no right to feel it. Selene is Valeria's daughter—strong, fearless, everything I'm not. Of course Sebastian would want someone like Evelyn. It's just another reminder of why I'll never measure up.

Sebastian captures my hand, pressing his lips to my knuckles. "That was before I met you. I told you how overwhelmed I felt—no mate, no Luna to share the burden of leadership. But Evelyn belongs with Adrian, and I'm glad they're happy."

'He's telling the truth,' Valeria murmurs in my mind.

It doesn't soothe the ache in my chest. I never asked to be a Luna, never wanted an Alpha's mate. Yet the thought of Sebastian with someone else feels like a knife twisting between my ribs. 'Hurts me too,' Valeria admits softly.

I nod stiffly and push food around my plate, appetite gone.

When dinner ends, I gather dishes and retreat to the kitchen. Sebastian intercepts me on my way back, pulling me into the shadowed foyer. His palms cradle my face. "Listen to me. There's nothing between Evelyn and me but friendship—maybe sibling rivalry at most. What I feel for you... there's no comparison."

I shrug, staring at his collar instead of meeting his eyes.

He growls, tilting my chin up with rough fingers. "Do I need to remind you what you do to me, little angel?"

"It's fine, I underst—"

His hands grip my thighs, hauling me up against the wall. My legs lock around his waist as his mouth crashes into mine—hot, demanding, leaving no room for doubt. One hand fists in my hair, angling my head just how he wants it. The other arm braces beneath me, muscles straining as he devours me like a man starved.

When I don't immediately yield, he nips my lower lip, the sharp sting making me gasp. He takes full advantage, tongue sweeping in to claim what's his. My fingers tangle in his hair as heat pools low in my belly, every nerve ending alight.

By the time he pulls back, we're both breathless. "Never doubt me," he rasps, letting me slide down his body until my feet touch the floor. He presses my hand against the hard evidence straining against his jeans. "This is how much I want you. Only you."

I swallow hard. The proof is... substantial.

"Come on," he mutters, stealing one last kiss before nudging me toward the dining room. "Before they send a search party."

The way he positions me in front of him—it's not just chivalry. It's to hide exactly what I do to him.

And that knowledge sends a thrill straight through me.

###Chapter 0197

I made sure Seraphina knew she was the only one for me before we returned to the living room.

"Everything settled?" Gregory asked. We both nodded.

"Good. Sit down. We have important matters to discuss."

Dinner had revealed much about Seraphina's past. Her life had been brutal—far worse than mine. Her parents had struggled while on the run, but they'd made the best of it. The cabin was the only place she'd ever known stability.

I braced myself. The rest of her story would be painful. I knew fragments, but we needed the full picture to prepare for what was coming.

I pulled her onto my lap as we sat. She flushed but didn't resist. After her earlier insecurity, I wanted everyone to see she was mine. More importantly, I knew what came next would break her. She needed my strength.

"Seraphina," Gregory began gently, "we need to hear everything. I know it's difficult, but we can't protect you unless we understand the threat. Start from the beginning. Remember, you're safe here. No one will hurt you." His gaze flicked to me. "And if they tried, I suspect the Alpha holding you would tear them apart."

"Damn right," I growled. She turned, searching my eyes. Whatever she found there made her sag against me. My arms tightened as she began.

She spoke of fleeing the cabin when the Whitewater Pack found them. I glanced at Adrian. His frown confirmed he'd never heard of them either—probably some minor pack.

Then she described watching her parents die.

My grip turned crushing. She trembled, raw grief pouring off her even after all these years. When tears choked her voice, Gregory wheeled closer and clasped her hand. "I'm so sorry, sweetheart. You're doing so well."

His tenderness surprised me. The Gregory I knew was all steel and grit. Evelyn joined us, taking Seraphina's other hand. "We're here. It won't bring them back, but you're not alone."

I rubbed circles on her back until she steadied. Then she continued—Prince Damien, Malachi, the humans, the feeding chamber. When she revealed the prince's obsession with her blood, Adrian snarled, dragging Evelyn onto his lap in a protective vise.

Gregory and Alistair pressed for details about the prince's reactions. But when Seraphina described how he'd feed from her—turning it into a spectacle, a perverse performance—I had to leave.

I set her down gently, kissed her temple, and strode out.

The training facility was exactly where I remembered. Punching bags lined the walls. I demolished the first one with a single blow, my fist bursting through the leather. The next five met the same fate.

On the sixth bag, Adrian's voice cut through my rage. "Need a live target?"

"You're not who I want to hit," I spat, driving my fist through another bag.

"Gregory's gonna make you replace those."

I shrugged. Worth every penny. Better the bags than letting Seraphina see this fury and think it was meant for her.

###Chapter 0198

"Let's go." Adrian beckons with a crooked finger. "You need a real challenge—someone who can fight back."

"I'd rather not explain to Evelyn why you're covered in bruises."

His lips curve into a smirk. "Good thing I'm mated to a Guardian then. The bond transfers some of their strength. Face it, Sebastian—I'm stronger than you now."

My brows knit together. Guardian power sharing through mating? I kick off my shoes and take my stance. "Is that why the old Alphas forced the bonds?" I throw the first punch.

"Doubt it." His fist slams into my ribs, stealing my breath. Damn, he wasn't lying. "According to Oberon, past Alphas gained no strength from their Guardians."

I sweep his legs, but he's already rolling upright. Faster too. "My theory?" He blocks my next strike. "The power transfer only works with fated, willing bonds."

We trade blows until my knuckles split and my lungs burn. The rage simmering beneath my skin finally eases. That vampire prince still needs to die, but at least I can think straight now.

"Thanks, Adrian." I mean it. Exactly what I needed.

"Family looks out for each other." He shrugs.

"Don't expect me to be good at it." I wipe blood from my mouth. "First real family I've had."

"Noted." We head inside where Seraphina jumps up the second I enter.

"Sebastian!" Her gaze darts between us before seizing my hands. Split knuckles, already healing.

"Just blowing off steam." I pull her palms against my chest. "I hate that you suffered alone. But I'm here now." My lips brush her forehead. "No one touches you again."

"Seconded." Alistair steps forward. "We need a joint plan to secure both territories."

"Agreed. But tonight, Seraphina needs rest." My arm circles her shoulders.

Gregory clears his throat. "I'd like to train you, Seraphina. Trained Evelyn when her spirit awakened, raised her from a pup. Know every Guardian strength and weakness. I'll have you battle-ready in no time."

She turns to me, and damn if that trust doesn't hit me square in the chest.

"You'll take it easy?" I ask Gregory.

"On my honor."

Her fingers tighten around mine. "I want this."

"Then it's settled."

Evelyn bounces on her toes. "Perfect! Adrian banned me from warrior training since I'm pregnant, but he can't stop me from sparring with you!" She hugs Seraphina like it was her idea.

Adrian and Gregory exchange a look—silent agreement to keep Evelyn in check. Good. Seraphina needs time to rebuild.

"Nine tomorrow. We start with swimming." Gregory says.

We say our goodbyes. As we walk home, Seraphina leans into me. For the first time in decades, the future doesn't look entirely bleak.

###Chapter 0199

Training excites me. It's been years since I last trained with my father, and I was making significant progress back then.

'We'll progress much faster with Gregory as our instructor,' Valeria comments.

'Do you recall training with him, or remember Evelyn training with him?' I ask.

'Yes, he was patient yet demanding. Evelyn became a formidable wolf thanks to Gregory and Evander.'

I'm deep in thought when Sebastian speaks. "What's on your mind?"

I smile at him. "Do you actually have a coin?" I tease.

He pats his pockets, then searches his truck, finally producing a quarter. "Hey now! That's worth twenty-five thoughts." His playful antics make me laugh.

I take the quarter and place it back in the console. "I was discussing training with Gregory and Evander with Valeria. She remembers Evelyn's training sessions and says he's an excellent, patient teacher."

"I trained with him once. He's a strategic fighter. He'll teach you techniques that will make you stronger and sharper." His gaze meets mine as he takes my hand before looking back at the road. "I'd like to train you too when you're stronger. Maybe mornings with Gregory and Evelyn, afternoons with me?"

"You want to train me yourself?"

"Absolutely. It's not about doubting Gregory's skills - I completely trust him. But different fighters have different styles. The variety will enhance your training." He pauses. "And honestly? Once you're at full strength, my warriors could benefit from sparring with you too. You'll make them better fighters."

"Alright." He kisses my hand - a gesture I'm noticing he does when happy, concerned, or simply when the mood strikes.

Back at the packhouse, knowing he has work, I offer to go to my room alone. He insists on escorting me. "You've had a tough night. Take a hot bath, relax, then sleep. I'll check on you later." He leans down for a gentle kiss.

I cup his face, holding him close. "Thank you for tonight. It meant everything to me."

"Always, Seraphina."

Following his advice, I sink into a steaming bath. The night's events replay in my mind - painful memories I'd rather forget. I know nightmares will come tonight.

When the water cools, I slip into one of Sebastian's shirts he gave me for sleeping. His scent might help, but I'm hoping he'll stay with me again. He or Dorian have stayed the past two nights after my nightmares.

Peeking out my door, I see his is ajar. I knock softly before entering. "Sebastian?"

Steam billows as he emerges from the bathroom, a towel slung low on his hips, showcasing his sculpted torso. My breath catches. He's drying his hair, so it takes a moment before he notices me.

"Seraphina? Are you alright? Another nightmare?"

###Chapter 0200

He flings the towel onto a chair and strides toward me mid-sentence. His palms glide along my arms, inspecting me like I might be hiding injuries.

"Um..." My thoughts short-circuit. The heat radiating from his freshly showered body is overwhelming. His scent—dark cedar and something uniquely him—wraps around me, dizzying.

"Seraphina?"

"I was thinking...after tonight...sleep seems impossible." I cringe at my fumbling words.

"You want Lucian to stay with you? Give me a sec to dry off properly so you're not stuck with damp wolf stench." His lips curve in that effortless smile. No irritation. No hesitation.

'Just ask him.' Valeria's voice hums in my mind.

"Actually...would you stay with me instead?" My gaze drops to the floor, bracing for refusal.

His fingers tilt my chin up, forcing our eyes to meet. "You're asking me to sleep beside you?"

A nod. That's all I can manage.

He presses a kiss to the bridge of my nose. "One minute. Let me grab sleep pants unless you want a repeat of this morning's...situation." His smirk flares when my cheeks burn.

"Right. I'll just—" I jerk a thumb toward my bedroom.

"Be there in five."

Alone in my room, nerves twist my stomach. He won't expect anything...probably. But when he or Lucian are near, the nightmares stay away. I burrow under the covers, pulling them to my collarbones just as the door clicks open.

Black cotton pants. Fitted tee. I've never seen him in sleepwear—does he always dress like this for bed?

He crosses to the empty side, lifts the blanket, and pats his chest. "Here."

I nestle against him. One arm bands around my waist while the other holds up his phone. "Music?"

I scrunch my nose.

"Problem?"

"Your playlist is...aggressive."

"Aggressive?"

"That first song? Some guy screaming about isolation."

Recognition flickers. "Linkin Park. Okay, fair."

"Then there was that numb anthem."

His brow furrows. "Also Linkin Park. Maybe a theme there."

"The last one had a man shrieking 'What have you done?' like a courtroom accusation. The female vocals were pretty, but overall? Fury."

"Within Temptation," he concedes. "Love them, but yeah, not exactly lullabies. Made that playlist during a...dark phase. Needed music that matched the storm inside." His thumb brushes my shoulder. "What do you listen to?"

Shrugging, I trace the hem of his shirt. "Haven't had access to music in years. But my mother used to sing folk ballads while we foraged as rogues."

"Remember any? I'll pull them up."

"Too rustic for your taste."

"Try me. Hum one?"

I exhale, then begin the lullaby she'd sing beneath star-scattered skies.

###Chapter 0201

Seraphina's voice is pure magic. Holy hell. That ethereal sound wraps around me like silk. While she sings, I search the lyrics and confirm my guess—it's "Nocturne." Not my usual taste, but when my mate sings, I'd listen to nursery rhymes on repeat.

Her final note lingers in the air. I press my lips to her crown. "You're divine."

Storm-cloud eyes blink up at me. "Mom was the real talent. Glad some of it stuck."

I queue similar songs at low volume, setting my phone aside. One hand cradles hers while the other tangles in her hair, massaging her scalp. She melts against me like warm honey. Soon, her breathing deepens, her weight solid against my chest. Even after tonight's chaos, holding her feels like coming home.

My mind shifts to tomorrow's training. A quick mind-link to Nathaniel: Get her a swimsuit. I've cleared my schedule to take her shopping after Gregory puts her through her paces. Then my thoughts darken—those bloodsuckers won't get another shot at her.

Dorian's growl vibrates through my skull. They'll bleed for touching our mate.

Damn right. I need intel—coven structures, numbers, attack patterns. They'll come. It's not if, but when. Earlier, I'd put out feelers for Genevieve, but radio silence so far.

Responsibilities pile up in my head—pack security, border patrols, not overloading Nathaniel or Donovan. Once Seraphina accepts the bond, we'll plan her Luna ceremony. The title might intimidate her, but her mere presence steadies me. Makes leading easier.

Then there's Victor. Two weeks since I've visited the cells. Tomorrow, after dropping Seraphina with Gregory, I'll rectify that. Her absence from the packhouse provides the perfect window. Last thing I need is her seeing me splattered with that traitor's blood.

Plans set, I drift off to Seraphina's phantom lullaby.

———

She's riding me hard. Goddess above, the way she moves—hips rolling, breasts bouncing as my hands claim every inch. A sharp pinch to her nipple draws sinful moans. I latch onto the other peak, and her fingers fist in my hair, holding me captive. Her pace turns frantic. I'm close. So fucking close.

I wake with a jolt, hips jerking, as pleasure detonates through me. What the actual hell?

Disorientation fades into grim amusement. First wet dream since puberty, and of course it's her. I glance down—thank the moon, she's still asleep, but her thigh is wedged against my straining erection. These sweatpants just earned their keep.

A soft whimper escapes her. Oh? Seems I'm not the only one dreaming dirty. My softening length frustrates her quest for release, but those breathy little sounds have me hardening again. Gently, I slide a hand between us.

###Chapter 0202

My precious Seraphina is soaked for me, and I can't help the deep growl that rumbles in my chest. The sound makes her whimper, her body arching toward me. My fingers trace slow, deliberate circles around her sensitive bud as she grinds against my thigh. She shatters quickly, her cry of ecstasy tearing through the quiet room as she jolts awake.

For a heartbeat, she looks just as dazed as I had been earlier. Before she can scramble away, I tighten my arm around her waist, pinning her in place. My fingers never stop their relentless rhythm.

"What—?"

"You were dreaming," I murmur against her ear. "I thought you might need some help." I withdraw my fingers slowly as her breathing evens out, then bring them to my lips without breaking eye contact. The taste of her explodes on my tongue—sweet with a hint of tartness, like wild berries dipped in cream. A possessive growl vibrates through me.

I need more.

In one swift motion, I flip her beneath me. My hand glides up her thigh, savoring the way her skin trembles under my touch. "I want to taste every inch of you."

Her eyes widen, dark with desire.

"Tell me to stop," I challenge.

She shakes her head frantically.

Thank the Moon Goddess.

I drag her shirt upward. When her hands fly up to cover herself, I catch her wrists and press them gently to the mattress. "Let me see you, Seraphina."

"I'm covered in scars," she whispers.

"Scars mean you survived," I remind her, trailing my lips along a jagged line on her ribs. "Now let me worship every single one."

She doesn't resist as I peel the shirt off completely. My gaze devours her—the curve of her hips, the swell of her breasts, the way her body has softened since she came to me. Every scar tells a story, and I intend to learn them all.

I start at her collarbone, kissing downward until I reach her breast. My tongue flicks over her nipple, and her back arches off the bed. Her eyes lock onto mine, pupils blown wide. I suck harder, relishing the way her breath hitches before her eyelids flutter shut. A broken moan escapes her as I switch to her other breast, lavishing it with the same attention.

Her hands fist in my hair when I continue my descent. Just as I reach her hipbone, her fingers tug at my shirt. I yank it off in one motion, tossing it aside. "You want me naked too, little mate?"

She nods desperately.

"Use your words."

"Yes," she gasps. "I need you naked. Now."

I obey, stripping off my pants before spreading her thighs over my shoulders. My breath ghosts over her glistening folds, and she shivers. Then I dive in.

The first lick has her crying out. I groan against her, drunk on her flavor. She tastes like sin and honey, and I lap at her like a starved man. When I suck her clit between my lips, her hips jerk violently. Her thighs clamp around my head as I slide one finger inside her, then two, curling them just right.

"Adrian!" she screams as she comes, her walls pulsing around my fingers. The sound of my name on her lips sends me over the edge too. I ride out her pleasure with her, gentling her through the aftershocks before crawling back up her body.

When I finally claim her mouth, I let her taste herself on my tongue.

"Perfect," I rasp against her lips. "I could feast on you every damn morning." The blush that spreads from her cheeks down to her chest is utterly intoxicating. "Come on, little warrior. Time to shower—you've got training today."

###Chapter 0203

What a way to start the morning.

First, I dreamt of Sebastian between my thighs, his skilled fingers bringing me to the edge. Then I woke to my very first climax—real, not imagined. And just when I thought it couldn't get more intense, there he was, the living, breathing version of him, finishing what my dream started.

The man’s tongue should be registered as a lethal weapon.

He takes my hand, helping me off the bed, his low chuckle vibrating through me when my knees nearly buckle.

"Easy," he murmurs, steadying me.

The bathroom tiles are cool under my feet as he turns on the shower, testing the water with his hand before glancing at the bottles lined up on the ledge. His nose wrinkles slightly.

"We’ll get you proper shower things today," he says, plucking up the floral-scented body wash with a frown. "This doesn’t suit you."

His gaze flicks to me. "Unless you like it?"

I shake my head. "I prefer berry scents. My mother and I used to forage for wild berries and make our own soaps."

He steps aside, letting me enter the shower first. As I pass, he leans in, inhaling deeply near my hair.

"Berries," he murmurs, satisfied. "Exactly what I thought."

I turn as he joins me under the spray, his hands already working through my hair, rinsing it thoroughly.

"I smell like berries to you?"

His fingers massage my scalp, sending tingles down my spine. "Raspberries and cream," he confirms, voice rough. Then, lower: "But you taste even sweeter."

Heat floods my cheeks.

He grins, pressing a kiss to the tip of my nose before reaching for the shampoo.

"You smell like the forest," I tell him.

A slight frown creases his brow. "All wolves do."

I shake my head as he lathers the shampoo into my hair, his fingers working magic against my scalp. My eyes drift shut without realizing it, only opening when I feel him watching me.

"Like that?" he asks, voice husky.

"Mm. Perfect." I tilt my head back into his touch. "But your scent is different. Not just trees and earth. You smell like sunlight through the leaves after rain. Like morning dew on grass."

He stills for a heartbeat before gathering my hair in his hands, rinsing the suds away.

"Do you like it?"

"Yes." The word comes out breathless. "It reminds me of hiking with my mother at dawn, when the world felt new. But there’s more—something just… you. Alpha. Male."

The conditioner comes next, his fingers combing through the lengths with reverence. A soft sound escapes me, something between a sigh and a purr.

"Wrap your arms around me," he orders softly, and I obey, anchoring myself against him as his hands continue their work.

"Your hair," he murmurs, almost to himself. "Like silk. Even this long, it barely tangles."

There’s something in his voice that makes me look up. He’s staring at my hair like it’s something precious.

"Still want to cut it?"

"Just a trim," I say. "The ends are split."

His smile is instant, relieved.

As he tips my head back to rinse, I reach up, threading my fingers through his own damp hair. He leans into the touch with a rough exhale.

"I’m overdue for a cut too," he admits. "Gets unruly when it’s this long."

The water runs clear between us, carrying away the last of the suds—and any remaining barriers.

###Chapter 0204

"I can trim it for you." His gaze meets mine, and I give a casual shrug. "I used to cut both my parents' hair."

"I'd love that. Maybe tonight after shopping?" He presses a kiss to the tip of my nose before handing me a towel. "Your hair is perfect, my lady."

"Thanks."

After we finish showering, I hesitate when it's time to dress. "I don't have a swimsuit."

Sebastian moves to the door, opening it to reveal a package on the floor. He retrieves it and sets it on the bed. "Nathaniel found you a one-piece. We'll buy more when we go shopping."

The suit comes with a full-length cover-up that has long sleeves. Relief floods me—I wasn't comfortable showing too much skin.

Once dressed, we head out. The drive to Blackthorn Pack is quiet and serene. Sebastian lowers the windows, our fingers entwined the entire way. When we arrive at Gregory's place, he escorts me inside.

"Seraphina! Ready for your first training session?" Gregory's eyes spark with excitement.

"Gregory. You promised to take it slow," Sebastian reminds him firmly.

"I will. But Guardian training is different from regular wolf training." He turns back to me. "Julian and I have a bet going—you'll feel stronger by the time you leave today."

"Who's Julian?" I ask.

Evelyn appears behind me. "Our resident gambler. This pack bets on everything." She rolls her eyes as Adrian grins behind her.

"Still bitter about that time they bet against Selene," Adrian teases.

There's clearly history there, but Gregory cuts in, motioning for us to follow. Sebastian walks with us to the outdoor pool—massive, easily Olympic-sized by human standards.

"Alright, Seraphina, you can swim, right?" Gregory asks.

"Bit late to ask now," Sebastian mutters under his breath.

I smile but nod. "It's been years, but I think I'll remember."

"Good. Then hop in."

Evelyn sheds her cover-up and dives gracefully into the deep end. I freeze, suddenly aware of all the eyes that will see my scars. Sebastian immediately takes my hands. "Remember, these people are family. They won't judge you."

Gregory wheels closer. "He's right. What happened to you wasn't your fault. You're strong—Valeria wouldn't have chosen a weak wolf as her Guardian. Your scars prove your strength."

Adrian crouches by the pool's edge, speaking quietly to Evelyn. I glance at Sebastian and Gregory before pulling off my cover-up, cheeks burning as Gregory studies the marks on my skin.

"A warrior worthy of Valeria's spirit. Now get in," he says, jerking his chin toward the water.

I turn to Sebastian. "Will you be okay without me?" he asks.

"I'll manage." He kisses me quickly before addressing Gregory. "What time should I pick her up?"

Evelyn answers instead. "We'll bring her home. I want to show her around the pack house and maybe have her stay for lunch if she's up to it."

Sebastian looks back at me. "Don't push yourself too hard. Have fun."

I step into the pool, the cool water rising as I descend the shallow end steps. Sebastian winks at me before leaving with Adrian.

###Chapter 0205

Evelyn's request to keep Seraphina longer works in my favor. It means more time alone with Adrian today.

As we step outside, the question that's been gnawing at me finally slips out. "How do you do it?" I glance at him.

"Do what?" He smirks.

I exhale sharply. "Sorry. How do you handle being mated to a Guardian, knowing she'd die for you? As an Alpha, it doesn't compute. Protecting the pack—that's our role. How do you live with it?"

His smile fades. He stares into the trees before answering. "It's not easy. It's in their blood, just like protecting the pack is in ours. Evelyn protects me the way I protect our people. After Victor kidnapped her, I told her never to sacrifice herself for me again. I asked her to fight beside me, not for me. That's the key." He meets my gaze.

"You have to treat her as an equal, and she has to agree to stand with you when the time comes. It's a compromise. One I made to keep her safe. Evelyn may be Luna, but she's my equal in every way. That said..." His voice drops. "She's also submitted to me."

My head snaps toward him. "Evelyn submitted?"

His eyes grow distant. "Before we were mated. And still does, sometimes. I know she doesn't have to. Nothing I say or do could force her. It has to be her choice."

"How?" I demand. "How did you make that happen?"

His focus sharpens on me. "By becoming everything she needed in a mate. By being better than I thought I could be—because she expected it. Demanded it. When I proved myself, she submitted willingly. So yes, we're equals. But I'm still her Alpha."

I nod, absorbing this. I have no idea what Seraphina expects from me. If this bond between us is going to work, I need to figure it out fast. "Thanks, Adrian."

"Anytime. We still need to discuss the vampire threat and border security."

"I'll bring Donovan," he says.

We part ways. Back at the pack house, I head straight to the dungeons.

Victor hangs limp in his cell. "One chance," I growl. "Why did you do it?"

Same answer as always. "I didn't kill Luna Isolde."

A snarl rips from my throat. "Don't you dare say her name!"

I jerk my chin at the guards. "String him up."

He doesn't resist as they shackle his wrists overhead. Weeks of frustration explode out of me—my mate nearly dying, vampires hunting her, Seraphina's suffering, her being a Guardian, my mother's murder, my father's abandonment. Every punch carries the weight of it.

When he sags unconscious, I step back. "Why?" I rasp.

"I didn't do it," he slurs.

One final blow knocks him out cold.

"Get him down," I order the guards. "Keep him alive."

Wiping blood from my hands, I realize how much time has passed. I need to clean up before Seraphina returns.

The moment I step into the hallway, her scent hits me—raspberries and fresh cream. My muscles unwind. Even her lingering fragrance soothes me.

Upstairs, I scrub Victor's blood off in the shower. Just as I finish, Nathaniel's panicked mind-link shatters my calm.

"Alpha, she's running!"

"Who?"

"Seraphina. And she's fast—you need to get out here now."

What the hell? I bolt from the shower, shifting mid-stride. Dorian hits the ground running as I leap the staircase railing.

"Location," I demand through the link.

"Heading toward Black Canyon Falls."

I push harder. I didn't even know she was back. What scared her this badly?

"When did she return?"

"Unknown. Patrol spotted her sprinting full-speed."

"Any vampire scent?"

"None detected, but you know her senses are sharper."

"Double-check the perimeter."

The thunder of paws grows louder as I near the falls. Through the trees, I spot Nathaniel struggling to keep pace as Seraphina scales the cliffside. I howl, praying she'll stop when she senses me.

She turns.

No relief—only terror.

What the—?

I surge forward, blowing past the patrol wolves. Dorian overtakes Nathaniel's wolf, Leon, closing the distance to my mate. Something's horribly wrong.

At the cliff's edge, Seraphina stands trembling. Tears streak her face as she whispers, "I won't do it again. I'd rather die than belong to monsters."

Dorian whines. 'What did you do?' he snarls at me.

'I don't know!'

He drops to his belly, crawling toward her with pleading whimpers.

"I can't," she keeps repeating, like a broken record. Then, softer: "I won't."

Her gaze locks onto Dorian. "Even if you're my mate, I won't bind myself to a monster. And he is one. I'm sorry, Dorian."

If she jumps, we follow. I don't know if she'd survive the fall, but I know we wouldn't. It doesn't matter. She'd rather die than be with me. She thinks I'm a monster.

If she rejects us, death is better.

###Chapter 0206

The water feels incredible against my skin. Gregory guides me through gentle stretches, working muscles that have lain dormant for years. Evelyn effortlessly overtakes me lap after lap. It reminds me of that superhero movie Dad managed to get for us in the bunker - the scene where the fast guy keeps passing the other one on the track. Now I truly understand both the humor and frustration of that moment.

By the time we finish, every muscle burns with that satisfying ache of exertion. 'Gregory was right. I can feel myself getting stronger,' Valeria murmurs in my mind.

I climb out of the pool, dripping wet as Evelyn hands me a towel. While Valeria feels empowered, I'm completely drained. Evelyn settles beside me just as Gregory wheels closer in his chair.

"How are you holding up?" His gaze is assessing.

"Valeria says she's stronger, but I'm wiped out," I admit. Evelyn nods knowingly. "That tracks. It always takes more out of you than her, but the results are worth it."

Gregory studies me thoughtfully. "Let's keep lunch simple today - sandwiches here. You can tour the packhouse tomorrow. I gave Sebastian my word I wouldn't push you too hard, and I intend to keep it." Relief washes over me at the suggestion.

Over our meal, Evelyn shares news about her talk with Oberon - the Fae king plans to visit next weekend with his son Finnian. They're eager to meet me and begin documenting my story for their Guardian Archives.

Gregory explains the Valeria bloodline's enhanced healing abilities. "This explains how Valeria sustained you for so long, and why your scars aren't more severe."

I glance down at my marked arms. "They look plenty severe to me."

"Imagine how much worse they'd be without Valeria's healing," Gregory counters.

"He's right," Evelyn adds. "Those wounds could have festered, or caused permanent damage given how often you were... used." The realization hits me. I'd been so focused on the visible damage that I never considered how much worse it could have been.

'I wish I could have done more,' Valeria whispers guiltily.

"You saved my life. That's more than enough."

'I believe I can improve their appearance after we shift. Not erase them completely, but make them less prominent.'

'Don't strain yourself. I'm just grateful we're both regaining our strength.'

"Seraphina," Gregory changes subjects abruptly, "when was the last time you ran?"

"Define run. For pleasure? For survival?"

"Exercise," he clarifies.

"Never, honestly. Dad's training focused on combat - sparring, fighting techniques."

He nods. "Fighting skills are vital, but so is stamina. Tomorrow we'll start running drills. Evelyn can still run for another month or so, but her endurance surpasses yours - for now. We'll take it gradually."

After helping clean up, I'm ready to collapse before my shopping trip with Sebastian. Evelyn offers to drive me home, and we chat easily about Luna responsibilities, her pregnancy, and baby preparations.

"Want me to walk you in?" she asks when we arrive.

"No, I'm good. Thanks! See you tomorrow."

"Looking forward to it!" She waves as she drives off.

Turning toward the packhouse, the rich scent of pine floods my senses. MATE! MATE! MATE! Valeria practically vibrates with excitement.

'Our mate's here?'

'Yes! Hurry!'

I rush inside only to freeze at the coppery tang of blood mingling with my mate's scent. My stomach plummets. Is he hurt? I creep toward the kitchen and there he stands - Sebastian. My mate. Drenched in blood that clearly isn't his own.

Every nightmare memory from the feeding chambers crashes over me. Valeria whimpers in confusion and fear.

I can't breathe. My lungs refuse to function. Pressing against the wall, I watch silently as Sebastian heads upstairs. 'He's a monster, Valeria. I warned you. I told you we couldn't trust him.'

She cries pitifully, torn between mate-bond and horror. 'We have to leave. I can't go through this again. I won't survive that hell a second time.'

###Chapter 0207

My instincts kick in like they always do when danger strikes. I bolt.

Slipping out of the packhouse unseen, I hit the tree line at full speed. Exhaustion from earlier vanishes as adrenaline floods my veins. Fight or flight? I choose flight every damn time. My legs pump furiously, carrying me deeper into the woods.

The sound of paws tearing through dirt echoes behind me. They're gaining. If they catch me, it's back to that gilded cage. Never again. Not when I'm this close to reclaiming Valeria. The Blackthorn Pack might offer temporary shelter, though their alliance with Sebastian complicates things. Right now, it's my only play with wolves snapping at my heels.

I push harder. The waterfall's my last chance. They're too close for scent masking to work, but the cliff face could buy me precious minutes if I descend it. Wolves can't follow in that terrain without shifting first.

Reaching the falls, I scramble up the rocks. Human hands grip better than wolf paws. Halfway up, a familiar howl stops me cold.

I turn.

Dorian stares up at me with those golden eyes. Valeria whimpers in my mind, aching for her mate.

'We can't have Dorian without Sebastian.'

'I know. But losing him now hurts just as much as finding him did.'

No time to argue. Dorian's already climbing after me. I reach the cliff edge just as he lets out a wounded sound behind me.

Turning, I meet his gaze. "I won't go back. Death's better than living with monsters."

Dorian whines, crawling closer. Valeria's distress mirrors his.

"I can't," I tell them both. "Not even for you, Dorian. I won't tie myself to a killer." It's not him I'm running from. Dorian's perfect - kind, protective, everything a mate should be. He deserves better than this. "I'm sorry."

Scanning the cliff for an escape route, I hear bones cracking. Sebastian stands there human, raw desperation twisting his features.

"Seraphina, please." His voice cracks. "Tell me what I did. I'll fix it, whatever it is. Just don't jump."

Jump? The thought hadn't occurred to me until he said it. My threat about preferring death wasn't literal - I'd never take Valeria with me like that.

He's on his knees now, torment in his eyes.

'He's telling the truth,' Valeria whispers, though his expression says it all.

"Talk to me," he begs. "Let me make this right."

"I saw you." The words taste like bile.

Confusion washes over his face. He genuinely doesn't understand.

"After we returned, I caught your scent. Valeria recognized you as our mate." His nod confirms he already knew. That explains his recent behavior.

"I followed it to the kitchen." My hand flies to my mouth as nausea hits. "You were covered in blood. Just like them. The vampires. The monsters."

The memories drag me under. Panic claws up my throat, stealing my breath. Darkness creeps at the edges of my vision as my knees buckle.

The last thing I see is Sebastian lunging to catch me.

###Chapter 0208

I've never begged for anything in my life. Never gotten on my knees. Until today. Today, I'll crawl through broken glass if it means she'll stay. Adrian's warning echoes in my skull. 'Become whatever she needs you to be.' At the time, I didn't understand. Now I do. It means swallowing my pride like I've never done before.

The realization hits like a knife between the ribs. She's running from me. From what I became after leaving Victor. My own mate fears me.

'Fix this, or I'll tear this world apart.' My wolf's threat vibrates through my bones.

Even without his warning, I'd move mountains to make this right. This delicate angel somehow tamed the storm inside me. Losing Evelyn was nothing compared to the thought of losing Seraphina.

As she paints, I see the blood on my hands threw her back into her nightmares. When her breathing turns ragged, I'm already moving. I catch her before her knees hit the ground, pulling her away from the cliff's edge.

Nathaniel stands there watching. My lips curl back in a snarl. He bares his throat instantly. "Cleared the area myself. You know I'd never talk."

An Alpha showing submission? Unheard of. The pack would scent weakness like sharks to blood. Challenges would come daily until I bathed in enough challengers' blood to reclaim my title.

Cradling Seraphina, I descend the waterfall. "Run the pack until I handle this. Nothing matters more than her."

"Understood, Alpha."

She stays unconscious past curious pack members. Nathaniel must've given orders - a few sharp barks send everyone scattering.

I tuck her into bed, then grab fresh clothes from my room. The chair creaks as I drag it beside her bed. No more running. We need to talk. I need her to see I'm not the monster she thinks.

But maybe I am. Victor's been rotting in my cells for months. My personal stress relief. All that rage, that loneliness - it's twisted into something monstrous.

She called my music angry. I never noticed. That playlist was born from losing Evelyn, when I believed I'd always be alone. It fit then. It fits now.

Except... I haven't touched those songs since Seraphina arrived. The emptiness is gone. Replaced by something terrifying - hope. She made me believe in a life I never dared imagine. And I might've ruined it all by being exactly what I feared becoming.

Earbuds in, I craft a new playlist. Songs that say what I can't. That show how she's changing me, even if she doesn't know it.

The mattress shifts. I look up to find wide gray eyes staring at me. Slowly, I remove the earbuds. Waiting.

"Who died?" Her voice cracks.

"No one. Victor Blackwood. I hurt him, but he's breathing."

###Chapter 0209

"Why?"

"Because he's the one who took my mother from me. I finally tracked him down six months ago." My gaze drops to the floor. Admitting this makes my stomach twist with shame, even though I know the bastard deserves every ounce of pain I've given him.

"He keeps denying it. Swears he didn't kill her. But I know he's lying."

"How can you be sure?"

"They found him crouched over her body, covered in her blood. When someone tried to stop him, he ran like a coward. My father spent years hunting him. Then I took over. Eighteen years he's evaded justice. I won't let him die until he tells me why."

She stays silent, fingers twisting in the blanket.

"If this is too much for you, I'll end it now."

Her voice cracks. "You're my mate."

"Yes. I knew the moment I saw you. Valeria wasn't strong enough to sense the bond until today."

"I never wanted a killer." The whisper shatters me. How can I promise never to take another life when the monsters who hurt her still breathe?

"I'm an Alpha. Violence is in our blood. I won't lie—I've killed before. I'll kill again to protect this pack. To destroy anyone who harms what's mine. And the ones who hurt you? I'll tear them apart with my bare hands."

I reach for her. "I want to fix this. I'll do whatever it takes. But don't ask me to spare the leeches who put a price on your head. I don't kill for pleasure. Only necessity. Let me prove that to you. Dorian and I can't promise more."

Her eyes lock onto mine. "You terrified me."

"I'm sorry. I never wanted you to see that side of me. I thought you were still out. Planned to clean up before you returned."

Cradling her hand between mine, I lay myself bare. "Give me a chance to show you I'm not a monster. Maybe I'm harsh. Maybe I'm ruthless when my pack is threatened. But with you? I want peace. You calm the storm inside me. I'll try to be gentler, if that's what you need. Just... don't walk away."

Tears burn my eyes—something that hasn't happened since my mother died. For her, my mate, my Seraphina, I'd bleed myself dry.

She studies me for an eternity before speaking. "Fine, Sebastian. One chance. Valeria wants Dorian. Evelyn and Nathaniel believe in you. For them, I'll try."

I press my lips to her knuckles. "You won't regret it."

'Screw this up and I'll rip out your throat myself,' Dorian growls.

'Our mate comes first. Fix this so we can claim her properly.'

"Hungry? I can have food brought up. Or better—let me take you out. Show you more of Nightshade territory. We'll get dinner, buy you real clothes. You must be sick of wearing borrowed scraps."

"A shower first. Then we'll go. I... I'd like to see my new home."

###Chapter 0210

Valeria confirmed everything Sebastian said was true. He genuinely wants to fix things. He doesn’t kill without reason. And she’s right—he’s an Alpha. The weight he’s carried for years isn’t something I can just dismiss. I’ve seen firsthand how brutal our world can be, how ruthless the supernatural factions are. I want the vampires gone just as much as he does. After years of fear, I deserve safety too. So why am I holding him to a standard I wouldn’t even follow myself?

"And we’re his Guardian."

"What does that even mean, Valeria?"

"A Guardian is bound to protect an Alpha. The cycle of power shifts with the Guardian’s life. Sebastian and Dorian being our mates ties us to them. We can’t walk away. It’s our fate."

"So even if I hate it, I’m stuck with him?"

"You don’t have to accept the bond, but yes, we’re linked to them for life."

Fantastic. Looks like I need to figure out how to coexist with him.

After my shower, I dress and head to his room, knocking lightly. The door swings open instantly, and his gaze locks onto me.

"Ready?" he asks. I nod.

Downstairs, the pack members keep their distance, unlike before when they’d swarm him.

"Why is everyone avoiding you?" I ask as we walk to the car.

He lifts me into the passenger seat effortlessly. "I told them to back off. Right now, you’re my priority. They can wait."

I frown as he slides into the driver’s seat. "But they’re your pack. They need you."

He turns, intensity burning in his eyes. "And I need you. More than you realize. More than I’m willing to admit." The engine roars to life. "Nathaniel’s handling anything urgent." His fingers twitch against the wheel. "Shopping first, or are you hungry?"

"Shopping’s fine."

Music fills the car as we pull out. The melody isn’t angry like before—it’s lighter, almost like absolution. Strange.

"I wasn’t going to jump," I say suddenly.

His grip tightens on the wheel. "You were at the edge. You said you’d rather die than be with a monster."

"I was looking for a way down. I thought I could make it to Blackthorn before your wolves caught me. But Dorian’s fast."

"Adrenaline," he mutters.

"I just didn’t want you thinking I’d hurt Valeria like that. I just got her back."

He changes the subject abruptly. "How was training with Gregory?"

I notice his restless hand and exhale. Fine. I’ll give him this. I place my palm up on his thigh.

His reaction is instant. His fingers intertwine with mine, and the tension in his jaw eases.

"He really does care," Valeria murmurs in my mind.

She’s right. Today has shaken him more than I realized.

###Chapter 0211

His lips brush against my knuckles, sending a shiver down my spine. "Thank you." His gaze locks onto mine, intense and unreadable.

"For what?"

"For not giving up on me. I won't fail you."

I squeeze his hand in response. "Training went better than expected. I could barely stand afterward, but Valeria felt stronger. Maybe that's how she finally recognized you as our mate."

Sebastian nods. "Makes sense. You're going back tomorrow?"

"Same time. Oh, and Evelyn mentioned someone named Oberon is visiting next weekend. He's bringing his son Finnian to document my story."

"The Fae King and Prince. They're historians of Guardian lineage. Oberon will be fascinated by you."

"I've never met a Fae before. What are they like?"

His grip tightens around my fingers. "From what Adrian and Evelyn say, he's fair but cunning. He was mated to a Guardian centuries ago, so he'll favor Valeria. But don't get any ideas." A low growl rumbles in his chest. "You're mine."

"And apparently, I'm your Guardian too." I tilt my head. "Did you know that?"

His eyes flicker toward me before returning to the road. "Logical assumption. Evelyn is Adrian's Guardian and mate. The pattern fits."

We pull into a charming district lined with boutique shops. Sebastian parks and helps me down, his hand never leaving mine as we approach a clothing store. "This is neutral territory between Nightshade and Blackthorn packs. Humans frequent the nearby towns too. My corporate office is in the city—I'll take you there soon."

My pulse jumps when he says "our pack lands." This man doesn't do anything halfway.

The shopkeeper's annoyed expression vanishes when Sebastian enters. "Alpha! What an honor. How may I assist you?" She blatantly ignores my presence.

+15 BONDS

Valeria snarls in my mind, bristling at the disrespect. The woman pales when my eyes flash gold. "Guardian. My deepest apologies." She bares her throat. "I didn't realize our packs had another Guardian."

"Beatrice. This is Seraphina, my mate and a Guardian."

Her gaze darts to my unmarked neck. "Your... mate?"

"Yes. We need a wardrobe for her. Can you help?"

Sebastian turns to me while the woman continues addressing only him. "Want to browse first?"

"Please."

"Feel free to look around," Beatrice tells Sebastian. "Let me know if you need anything."

We explore the racks together, selecting jeans, blouses, and delicate nightwear. Sebastian insists on approving every outfit I try on. By checkout, we've amassed workout gear, casual wear, and silk pajamas.

"Good start," he says, adding scented lotions to the pile. Beatrice rings us up while flirting shamelessly. Sebastian doesn't even glance her way.

Bag in hand, he offers me his arm. "Hungry?"

"Starved."

###Chapter 0212

Beatrice's blatant disregard for Seraphina set my blood boiling, but I swallowed my anger. Causing a scene wouldn't help matters. From now on, no one disrespects my mate—she's their future Luna, and they'll damn well act like it.

I made sure Seraphina wore one of her new outfits. No more hand-me-downs from pack teenagers. Even in sophisticated clothing, her youthful glow remained untouched. When I took her hand, relief flooded me. She'd given me a second chance when I didn't deserve one.

"What's this song?" She tilted her head. "Doesn't seem like your usual taste." A playful smirk curved her lips. "Unless your secret playlist is full of... romantic ballads?"

I feigned offense, pressing her knuckles to my lips. Her scent—vanilla and wildflowers—wrapped around me. "Made this for you while you slept. Saw me with earbuds in? That's what I was doing."

Her fingers tightened around mine. "Why these songs? They're... different."

"Words aren't my strength." My thumb traced circles on her wrist. "Thought music could say what I can't. About you. About us. What I want us to be."

She hummed along to the lyrics, voice soft:

"Full is not heavy as empty,
Not nearly, my love..."

"True, isn't it?" Her eyes met mine, understanding passing between us.

"Didn't know what 'full' felt like until you." The steering wheel creaked under my grip. "Always been empty. Now? I'm lighter than air."

Her smile lingered as I parked outside Celestia—the only upscale restaurant near our territory borders. Twinkling fairy lights draped over the entrance like captured stars.

"Gorgeous," she breathed.

"Worth a shot without reservations." I squeezed her hand. "If not tonight, we'll come back."

Theodora, one of the owners, greeted us at the host stand. "Alpha Sebastian! Let me check..." Her gaze flicked between the seating chart and the crowded dining room. "Patio okay? More private anyway."

Seraphina nodded eagerly.

"Perfect." Theodora led us to a secluded corner table draped in ivy. Candlelight flickered between us, the night breeze carrying the scent of jasmine.

"Come here often?" Seraphina teased, tracing the rim of her water glass.

Theodora vanished with our drink orders as I leaned closer. "Only with someone special."

Her blush matched the sunset. Exactly as I'd planned.

###Chapter 0213

"No. It's considered a romantic place, and honestly, I don't do romance. I've visited alone a few times—sat at the bar, listened to music. Once, Nathaniel and I stopped by for steaks after working late."

"Why bring me here then?"

"Isn't it obvious, Seraphina?" She shakes her head.

"I'm trying to prove something. That there's more to me than the beast you saw earlier." She studies me for a long moment before glancing at the menu.

"What do you recommend?"

"If you trust me, I'll order for us both."

She closes the menu. "Surprise me."

I grin as the waitress approaches. I select a bottle of wine and starters. Hoping today's training worked up her appetite, I plan to share a steak and potatoes with her.

"I have a question," she says. "Fair warning—you won't like it."

I take her hands. "Ask me anything. We might not like each other's answers, but we'll be honest."

She nods, staring at our joined hands. "Would you let me see Victor?"

My body locks up. My jaw clenches so hard the muscle twitches.

"Why?" The word comes out rough. I force control. "You might not realize he kidnapped Evelyn and tried to force a mark on her. Meeting him puts you in danger."

"You'd be with me the whole time," she counters, holding my gaze.

I don't want her near that killer. I should've ended him when I had the chance.

The wine arrives, giving me a moment to think. Before diving back into that conversation, I raise my glass.

"To new beginnings. Together."

She taps her glass to mine. "Together."

Damn. I might've just trapped myself.

I exhale. "Tell me why you want to see him."

"Gregory and Evelyn told me about Valeria's Guardian lineage today—the strengths the Fae King documented. But they didn't mention one ability Valeria has: scenting lies. That's another reason I'm giving us a chance. I knew everything you said earlier was true. If you'd lied, I'd have smelled it."

This changes things. I'm glad she trusts my honesty, but how does this help with Victor?

She leans in. "I can confirm when he's lying. If he tried to force-mark a Guardian, he knows we have abilities beyond regular wolves. He'll know I can detect his lies." She tightens her grip. "You need closure. This way, you'll have proof he's guilty."

"You stay by my side. Promise me."

"I promise. I have zero interest in being forced-marked."

The appetizers arrive, and I order our mains.

When I turn back, she asks, "Tell me about your company. You said you run a business in the human city?"

"Yes." I explain the company structure, our two divisions, my role as CEO, and how it funds the pack. She listens intently, asking thoughtful questions. It hits me—no one's ever cared about my life beyond me being Alpha. People usually want something. Sharing this with her, having her genuinely listen... it feels different.

###Chapter 0214

"How do you manage it all? Running a massive pack and a nationwide company. When do you ever have time for yourself, Sebastian?"

I shrug. "Work has always been my life. There was never anything else for me. Just responsibilities, duties, endless tasks. I’ve spent years searching for someone to share it with—someone to stand beside me as a partner, not just a subordinate. I looked everywhere. Across the country, even overseas. And yet, you were right here all along. If only I’d known where to look."

Her fingers curl around mine, warm and reassuring. "You couldn’t have known. Just like I never would’ve guessed you wanted me as a mate, not just a Guardian. Even if I hadn’t been trapped by vampires, I would’ve stayed far from packs. Our paths might never have crossed."

Dinner ends, and I ask if she wants dessert. She declines, unsurprisingly. But she ate more than usual tonight—progress.

Outside, I take her hand, leading her back to the car. Lifting her into the truck, I press a soft kiss to her lips. Her hands cradle my face, holding me there. Then, just like before, her tongue slips between my lips, teasing. I meet her halfway, deepening the kiss until her quiet moan vibrates against my mouth.

Reluctantly, I pull back, brushing my lips against the corner of hers before climbing into the driver’s seat. The drive home is quiet, filled with the playlist I made just for her.

Back at the packhouse, she hesitates. "Did you still want me to cut your hair?"

"I’d love that. Thank you." Anything to keep you close, to feel your touch.

I hand her clothes off to the house omegas for washing, then guide her upstairs to my room. Stepping into the bathroom, I grab scissors and a comb. When I return, she’s studying the space—taking in the dark woods, neutral tones, the absence of personal touches. Only a few framed photos of my parents remain.

She drifts toward them, and I follow.

"That’s my mother."

"She’s beautiful. You have her eyes. And her hair."

I point to another. "My father. I got my build from him. And that’s me as a kid." The photo was taken a year before my mother died. There are no others after.

She picks it up, her thumb tracing over my childhood smile.

I settle behind her, hands resting on her hips. "I’ve paid for a lot of thoughts tonight. Care to share this one?"

She glances over her shoulder, lips curving. "I was just wondering… what it would be like to have a child who looked exactly like you."

###Chapter 0215

The effect of my words on Sebastian is immediate. His dark eyes turn stormy, his throat working as if swallowing suddenly became difficult.

I return my gaze to the photograph. Young Sebastian is breathtaking. His radiant smile reaches his eyes, lighting them up with pure joy. I ache to see that expression on his face again someday.

The image hits me harder than expected. Maybe it's the mate bond intensifying everything. But the second I saw this photo, I knew—I want his children. A whole pack of pups with his smile, maybe a blend of our features. The desire burns hotter than anything I've ever felt.

In this moment, I'm certain. I want to be mated to this man. There are still issues to resolve, trust to rebuild. But the thought of another she-wolf claiming him? Unthinkable.

As I replace the photo, I notice Sebastian's shirt hangs open. Those sculpted abs demand attention. My fingers trace the ridges of his stomach up to his chest. "Is there a reason you're half-dressed?"

The shudder that runs through him at my touch sends power coursing through me. I love affecting this dominant alpha.

"Was going to remove it," he rasps. "For the haircut."

I push the fabric off his shoulders, letting my hands glide down his arms as the shirt pools on the floor. "Good plan," I murmur. "Where are we doing this?"

He jerks his thumb toward the bathroom but doesn't move. Doesn't stop staring.

My hands travel back up his arms, fingers threading through his hair. His gaze holds mine until I scratch lightly at his scalp. Then his eyes drift shut with a soft groan.

"Someone enjoys this as much as I do."

"Your touch... I crave it."

He tugs me toward the bathroom, settling in a chair. "No one's touched me like this since my mother died. Lovers, yes. But nothing lasting. This... this is different."

I comb through his thick locks before responding. "I can't imagine how lonely that must've been." Moving in front of him, I meet his gaze.

"Desolate," he admits, pulling me between his knees. "Want music while you work?"

His phone produces the playlist instantly, speakers in the bedroom carrying the melody.

The opening lyrics make me laugh. 'You're barely waking, and I'm tangled up in you.'

"Sounds familiar," I tease.

His hands find my hips, thumbs tracing circles. "I haven't slept this well in years. Not until you."

As I trim his hair, I savor the texture—soft curls slipping through my fingers. I leave enough length to enjoy the sensation. His contented sighs mingle with the music, creating an intimacy that feels like coming home.

###Chapter 0216

The realization hits me hard—Sebastian hasn't just been alone his entire life. Beyond Nathaniel's father, who only taught him how to lead a pack, no one has ever shown him real love or affection.

I set down the scissors and comb. Leaning into him, I run my fingers through his freshly trimmed hair. My thumbs trace his eyebrows, then drift down to his closed eyelids, finally brushing over his lips. He kisses my fingertips gently.

A soft smile touches my lips. "I haven't slept without nightmares in years. Not until I came here. You and Dorian... you keep them away."

His voice is rough with emotion. "You make me feel whole, Seraphina. That hollow ache I carried for so long—I'd forgotten it was even there. That's why I'll do anything to keep you with me. I've never felt this complete before."

I pull his head against my chest, and his arms wrap around me tightly.

After a moment, I ease back. "Come on. Want me to wash your hair in the tub?"

His eyes darken. "Will you join me?"

This closeness between us is intoxicating. Maybe it's just the mate bond pulling us together, but I don't care. I want to be the one who heals him. The one he turns to when the world breaks him. The one who transforms his pain into something beautiful.

We're like two jagged puzzle pieces—mismatched and damaged—yet when we fit together, we become something whole.

"Yes," I whisper.

The way his face lights up steals my breath. I cup his cheek. "You should smile more. It suits you."

He turns to press a kiss to my palm. "You give me reasons to."

Standing, he moves to fill the tub. "Where's the broom? I'll clean this up."

While he fetches towels, I sweep the hair clippings and return the chair to the bedroom.

When I reenter, he's already undressed. "Get in. Let me rinse this hair off you first."

The roles reverse from earlier. Cradling his head, I pour water over his dark strands, the musky scent of his shampoo mixing with his natural aroma. As I massage his scalp, his eyes drift shut, tension leaving his body under my touch.

I take my time, savoring this rare vulnerability.

After rinsing, I stand to undress. His gaze burns as it travels over my body. Slipping into the water between his legs, I lean back against his chest.

"Thank you for the haircut," he murmurs in my ear.

I tilt my head to meet his eyes. "Thank you for trusting me with your truth. I want this to work, Sebastian."

His arms tighten around me. "We'll make it work. I promise."

The water laps gently as we hold each other, two broken souls finding solace in the unlikeliest of places.

###Chapter 0217

My chest feels lighter than it has in years. She's actually considering this, believing it might work between us. Opening up this much terrifies me, but it's clearly what she needs right now.

After drying her off with a fluffy towel, I fetch one of my oversized shirts for her to sleep in while I pull on gray sweatpants. Returning to the bathroom, I offer her the soft cotton. "Stay with me tonight?"

The words come out rougher than intended. Now that she's beginning to sense our mate bond, I want her in my bed permanently. This room should become ours.

A pretty flush spreads across her cheeks. "I'll probably end up using you as a body pillow again."

My lips curve at the memory of waking with her sprawled across me. "Problem with having your personal heater?" I tease, running a finger down her nose. "I've got a solution - we'll sleep spooning. I'll be your big spoon."

"Deal." She crawls into bed first, discreetly inhaling the scent on my pillow. Valeria must be urging her to finalize the mating bond. But this decision has to be Seraphina's choice alone.

'Help her understand,' Dorian growls in my mind. 'I want to claim our mate properly. Let the whole world know she's ours.'

'Patience,' I remind him as I settle behind her curving frame. She fits against me like the missing piece of my soul. One arm slides beneath her pillow while the other wraps possessively around her waist, my palm flattening against her stomach beneath the thin fabric. Breathing in her vanilla-and-rain scent, I press a kiss to her hair.

"Goodnight, Seraphina."

Her fingers intertwine with mine under the pillow. "Night, Sebastian."

This is perfection. I stay awake until her breathing evens out, only then allowing myself to drift off.

Hours later, restless movement wakes me. She's arching against me, her backside grinding against my erection. One hand fists in my hair as she whimpers my name.

That desperate sound shoots straight to my groin. Still mostly asleep, she's chasing pleasure in her dreams. I don't hesitate - my hand slips between her thighs, hiking her leg over my hip for better access.

She's drenched for me.

"Sebastian-" My name spills from her lips like a prayer as I work her with skilled fingers.

The second she startles awake, I pin her thigh with my free arm. My other hand abandons her pillow to tease a peaked nipple. Her gasp nearly undoes me.

Nipping her earlobe, I growl, "Come for me, sweetheart."

Her climax hits violently, her inner muscles fluttering around my fingers. The sensation triggers my own release, staining my sweatpants. Again.

True to yesterday's promise, I bring glistening fingers to my mouth. She turns to watch me taste her, grey eyes darkening with Valeria's golden ring. Dorian surges forward in response, no doubt turning my eyes hunter-green.

"Told you I wanted you for breakfast every morning," I rasp.

Leaning in, I claim her mouth in a searing kiss before pulling back. "Soon, little mate. Very soon, I'll take my time feasting on you until you forget your own name." I nip her swollen bottom lip. "But today, we've both got training."

She blinks up at me, still dazed. "You're training with me today?"

###Chapter 0218

"No. But I've been neglecting my warriors' training since you arrived. I need to check on their progress."

Her expression softens. "Thank you. I know this isn't easy for you."

I press a kiss to her forehead. "I'd do anything to keep you happy, little mate. Even if it means tolerating that bastard."

"Now go." I give her backside a sharp smack. Her eyes widen, then darken with unmistakable desire before she scrambles away. Oh yes, we'll be revisiting that reaction later.

Playfully, I let out a low growl. She whirls around just as I leap from the bed. A squeal escapes her as she bolts for the bathroom. I catch her at the threshold, sweeping her into my arms. "Got you."

"Hardly a fair chase," she teases breathlessly.

Adjusting my grip, I turn on the shower with my free hand. "Run anytime you like, mate. Dorian and I love the hunt. And we always win."

A delicious shiver runs through her before I set her down. As we shower, I make a mental note to book her a salon appointment.

Later, I drop her at Gregory's place. Apparently Evelyn wants to give her another tour of the packhouse today. I remind them both to eat and not overexert themselves before kissing her goodbye.

Training with my warriors feels invigorating. Tristan gives me a solid sparring session while Nathaniel and Donovan circulate, offering corrections.

During our water break, Tristan wipes his brow. "So, Alpha... is it true? Is she really your mate?"

Every warrior within earshot stills, waiting for my answer.

"She is. But she's only just regained enough strength to recognize our bond. Her wolf Valeria hasn't surfaced yet."

"Is the Guardian part true?" another warrior asks.

"Yes. For those who remember Ivy Sinclair - Evelyn's mother - Seraphina carries the reincarnated Guardian spirit."

A ripple of growls spreads through the group when I confirm the vampires' seven-year captivity and the seven-million-dollar bounty on her head.

The discussion about the other girl's six-million bounty is interrupted by an urgent mind link from patrols.

"Alpha! White wolf approaching at full speed - she's not stopping at the border!"

The link broadcasts to all warriors, including Nathaniel and Donovan.

Another patrol chimes in. "She blew past us! Heading straight for the packhouse!"

A triumphant howl pierces the air - not aggressive, but exhilarated.

"Second perimeter breached! Still accelerating!"

"Description?" I demand.

"Pure white coat. Golden eyes brighter than any I've seen."

"Let her pass."

"Sir?"

"I said let her through!"

A chorus of acknowledgments echoes through the link.

Nathaniel frowns. "Who is it?"

The answer bursts from the tree line - a white blur streaking toward me. Even at this distance, those golden eyes burn like twin suns.

"Valeria!"

I barely have time to brace before she tackles me to the ground in a whirlwind of white fur and joyful energy.

She shifted!

###Chapter 0219

My dreams have been nothing but pure sin lately. Every morning I wake up with Sebastian's hands and mouth working magic between my thighs. Not that I'm complaining. The man could make a saint beg for mercy with those skills. This morning, I nearly caved when he gave me that hungry look.

Then he spanked me.

That single slap sent shockwaves straight to my core. I almost arched back and begged for more. This mate bond is turning me into some kind of sex-crazed maniac.

'It's not just the bond. It's his Alpha nature. Your body instinctively responds to his dominance. And gods, is he dominant.' Valeria purrs in my mind. Helpful as always.

'Didn't seem very dominant when he made me that sappy playlist.' I counter.

'That was his way of saying I love you when words failed him. Adorable. He can be tender and commanding. Tell me your body doesn't obey his every word? You certainly didn't hesitate when he ordered you to come for him.'

Just remembering his deep voice growling in my ear makes me clench. Not ideal when you're mid-run. But I can't deny how my body reacts to him. And the thought of him and Dorian hunting us?

'Oh yes. The moment I can shift, Dorian will get the challenge he deserves.' Valeria's excitement thrums through me. Not just about shifting after seven years, but giving Dorian a run he'll never forget.

I'm approaching the five-mile mark when Valeria suddenly whimpers.

'Valeria? What's wrong?'

'I need to shift. Now.'

'Here? Seriously?'

'Can't... control it.'

My knees hit the dirt. Gregory's face appears above me, alarmed. "Evander!" Valeria screams through me right before agony rips through my body.

Somehow Gregory reaches me impossibly fast across the field. "Seraphina, what's happening?"

"Shifting." Our voices merge, strained with pain.

Gregory hauls himself from his wheelchair to the ground beside me. His hand presses against my heaving side. "Easy. Breathe. It's been years, but you can do this. I'm right here."

He positions himself before my face. "Look at me. Let Valeria lead. Don't fight it. Match my breathing."

His deep inhales guide me, but the pain is unbearable. My first shift wasn't this excruciating.

'You were a child then. Your body wasn't fully formed, and I could heal you faster than the damage occurred.' Valeria's voice is tight with suffering.

Time blurs. Every cracking bone is torture. At some point, I register Gregory has shifted, and Evander is nuzzling against us, his presence easing the pain slightly.

Then Evelyn appears, her hands smoothing over our trembling form. Between their combined support, Valeria finally completes the shift. We collapse, panting.

Evelyn strokes Valeria's fur. "Stunning, Valeria."

###Chapter 0220

Evander nuzzles his muzzle against my shoulder. "Can you stand?" Evelyn asks softly. "Gregory and Evander are worried about you."

Valeria takes her time rising. When she finally stands, she shakes out her silver-tipped fur and wags her tail at Evander, letting out an excited yip.

'How are you feeling, Valeria?'

'Like I could run forever!' She bursts forward without warning. I have no idea where she's headed, but she doesn't care—she just needs to move. A joyful howl echoes behind her as she bolts westward. The moment she changes direction, I understand. She wants Sebastian and Dorian to see her.

'Were you always this fast?' I'm mesmerized by my wolf's grace and power.

'Wait until I'm at full strength.'

We tear through Black Canyon, heading straight for the cliffs behind the cascading falls. She scales the rocky face with impossible agility, leaping between narrow ledges like they're stepping stones.

Near the summit, the first patrol spots us. Valeria doesn't slow—she pushes harder. Her triumphant howl rings through the mountains, announcing our arrival. I pray they recognize her. The last thing we need is to battle Sebastian's warriors.

She blazes past another patrol, weaving through the dense pines behind the packhouse. Then we catch his scent. Valeria's pace becomes frantic. As we burst into the clearing, he's already there—waiting.

The moment Sebastian sees us, his face lights up. He spreads his arms wide. Valeria doesn't hesitate. She launches herself at him, knocking them both onto the soft grass. She's trembling with excitement, wriggling in his embrace like an overgrown puppy.

Sebastian laughs as she covers his face in sloppy licks, yipping and dancing around him.

"Easy there, gorgeous." He sits up, brushing dirt from his shirt. Valeria rubs against him before prancing in circles, too exhilarated to stay still.

"Look at you." His voice holds awe. "So much bigger than I expected. Almost Dorian's size, though Seraphina's so petite."

Valeria purrs, scent-marking Sebastian as he stands. She suddenly crouches playfully, front paws down, hindquarters raised, tail wagging furiously.

Sebastian freezes. His eyes darken as Dorian's voice blends with his. "Feeling feisty, little wolf?"

Valeria barks, darting forward to nip at his boots before retreating. She glances back over her shoulder—challenge gleaming in her golden eyes.

"Run." The command is pure Dorian.

Valeria explodes into motion. Seconds later, thunderous paws shake the ground. She glances back to see Dorian in full pursuit. Her delighted howl splits the air. His answering cry is primal—the hunt is on.

For what feels like hours, Dorian chases us across pack territory, his teeth snapping playfully at Valeria's heels whenever he gets close. She leads him on a merry chase, never making it easy.

We're sprinting back through the canyon when that scent hits us—cloying, unnatural, unforgettable. Valeria skids to a halt, claws digging into earth. Her nose lifts, testing the air.

Vampire.

Just as Dorian reaches us, Valeria unleashes the warning howl. Danger.

We're stranded between Blackthorn and Nightshade territories. Alone until reinforcements arrive. And from the thickening stench, we're outnumbered.

###Chapter 0221

"Custos Regni." The hiss sent chills down my spine, dredging up memories I'd rather forget. "We finally found you. Prince Damien will be thrilled."

Dorian snarled beside me, his fur bristling. Valeria stepped forward, positioning herself protectively between him and the five vampires now blocking our path.

'Valeria?'

'I'm not at full strength, but I'm stronger than last time. We can take them.'

I felt Dorian's teeth gently tug my tail, pulling me back behind him.

"Kill the male. Bring the female to the prince," the lead vampire commanded. It wasn't Malachi this time, but his arrogance was just as infuriating. Three of his lackeys lunged for Dorian before he could react—but Valeria and I saw them coming.

Before the first could lay a hand on him, Valeria seized his arm and ripped it clean off, then slashed her claws across his throat. He wasn't dead, but two more were already closing in.

She whirled just in time to see Dorian tear the head off one attacker while the other wrapped his arms around Dorian's neck. Valeria leapt, claws flashing—until the leader grabbed her from behind, his fingers digging into her throat. She thrashed, struggling to break free. Strong as she was, she wasn't at full power, and the vampire had her pinned, his other arm crushing her ribs. The fifth vampire joined in, helping restrain her.

They started dragging her away as she fought desperately to reach Dorian. He was still locked in combat, the second vampire clinging to him, while the first I'd downed was already stirring. I could see the panic in Dorian's eyes—he wanted to get to me.

Then came the thunder of paws. Reinforcements.

One of the vampires holding Valeria turned to face the newcomers. Seizing the moment, she twisted and sank her teeth into the leader's throat. He choked, blood bubbling as he flailed, beating at her fur.

With the vampire still dangling from her jaws, she turned to see two more wolves had arrived—Nathaniel and Donovan—ripping through the remaining vampires. Dorian finished off his opponent and sprinted toward us.

Valeria stomped on the dying vampire beneath her, then shook her head violently, tearing his head from his body.

Nathaniel and Donovan made quick work of the last two. Valeria lifted her nose, scenting the air, then gave a sharp bark—all clear.

Dorian approached, nipping at her muzzle before licking her wounds clean. As the two newcomers shifted back, Nathaniel grinned. "So this is Valeria?"

"Yes," Sebastian answered, his voice tight. "Whether these were scouts or not, their absence will be noticed. Our timeline just moved up." He turned to the others. "I've arranged a meeting tomorrow at the pack house. We'll finalize our plans then."

More wolves arrived from both packs, their paws kicking up dirt as they gathered. Before addressing them, Sebastian knelt beside me, his hands running over Valeria's fur, checking for injuries. He leaned close, his whisper a heated promise.

"We will talk about this later, Seraphina."

The vampires have found her. And what exactly does Sebastian want to discuss?

###Chapter 0222

Valeria actually stepped in front of me. I couldn't believe it. Did she seriously think she could take on five vampires alone while I just stood there like some useless bystander? My hands clenched into fists so tight my knuckles turned white. But right now, anger had to wait - those bloodsuckers had found her.

If Prince Damien was even half competent, he'd know exactly where he sent his scouts and when they should report back. We could only pray this was their first stop and they weren't due back anytime soon.

Nathaniel and I immediately organized extra patrols to secure the canyon perimeter. I assigned warriors to burn the vampire remains. That sickly sweet stench clung to my nostrils - Nathaniel had been right. Once you smelled it, you never forgot.

Thank the moon Seraphina stayed in wolf form. If she'd shifted back naked in front of all these males, I might have lost control completely. My rage already simmered too close to the surface. I needed to rein it in before confronting her at the packhouse.

First, I had to make sure Valeria wasn't injured. She still hadn't fully recovered her strength, and that leech had been pounding on her. My quick inspection showed no major wounds, but I couldn't be certain.

When we finished securing the area, I jerked my chin toward home. Valeria understood and started back. I shifted immediately, with Dorian shadowing her every step. Her pace was noticeably slower now - she'd pushed herself too hard. Damn it.

Dorian matched her limping gait, ready to catch her if she stumbled on the steep climb. The ascent took forever, but we finally reached the top where clothes were stashed. I shifted back, pulling on shorts before turning to Valeria.

"Shift." I layered my Alpha command thick, though I knew it wouldn't work on her. Maybe she'd grasp how deadly serious I was. She transformed cautiously, watching me with wary eyes.

I tossed her a shirt and waited until she'd pulled it on. Then I hauled her over my shoulder like a sack of grain and stalked toward the packhouse.

"Sebastian! Put me down this instant!"

I smacked her ass hard enough to leave a mark. "Stay still and shut up."

Carrying her made the trip faster. She needed food, but our conversation couldn't wait. Pack members scattered from my path - whether from the sight of Seraphina draped over my shoulder or the murderous look on my face, I didn't care.

I marched straight to my room before dumping her onto the bed and rounding on her. "What the hell was that?"

Her confused expression only fueled my anger. She genuinely didn't understand why I was furious. I paced like a caged animal, trying to burn off the adrenaline. Beneath the rage lurked something worse - bone-chilling terror at how close I'd come to losing her today.

I whirled back to face her. "Never. Ever. Put yourself between me and danger again. Understood?"

"They were going to kill you," she whispered.

"First!" I roared, arms flailing wildly. "I'm a damn Alpha! I've been handling my own battles since I was six years old!" My voice cracked. "Second! Your life is not currency to spend on mine. Not today. Not ever. Are we clear?"

I loomed over her, breathing like a dragon about to spew fire. Part of me admired how she held her ground against my fury.

"I'm a Guardian, Sebastian. This is what I do. It's who I am."

###Chapter 0223

"Are you fucking kidding me? Did nothing I said last night get through to you? Do you not understand how vital you are to me? Sacrificing yourself for me isn't saving my life—it's destroying it. Without you, I have nothing. Remember that song lyric you love? You showed me what it feels like to be whole, and now that lightness is everything. You think I can go back to that emptiness after knowing this? I can't. There's no life for me without you, Seraphina. Nothing."

I pace the room, my hands raking through my hair. "For the first time, I understand what my father endured all those years." I stop abruptly, turning to face her. "And I'm telling you right now—I'm not strong enough to survive it. I wouldn't last ten fucking minutes without you, let alone a decade like he did. Do you hear me?"

Closing the distance between us, I grip her arms. "You are my everything. Without you, there's no point. No reason to keep breathing."

I press my forehead to hers, breathing her in. "I know I can't ask you to walk away. That protective instinct is in your blood, just like the fight is in mine. But promise me this—never step between me and danger again. Stand beside me, fight with me. I'll hate every second of you being at risk, but I'll accept it. Just don't shield me with your body. Promise me that."

Her palms cradle my face. "I'll try, Sebastian. No guarantees—Valeria feels that pull to protect you too. But I'll do my best to fight at your side, not in front of you."

I crush her against me, claiming her mouth in a desperate kiss. My hands roam her body, needing to feel her alive and unharmed. Breaking the kiss, I demand, "Let me see you. Did that bloodsucker hurt you? I know there aren't deep wounds, but show me the bruises."

I strip her shirt off, dropping to my knees to examine the darkening marks along her ribs where the vampire focused his blows. My lips trace each bruise, following the trail up her sternum.

Her fingers tangle in my hair as I wrap my arms around her waist. "I love you, Seraphina. So damn much it terrifies me."

She yanks my head back, forcing me to meet her gaze. "I love you too, Sebastian." Her thumbs brush my cheekbones before she kisses me, soft yet possessive. Wrapping her legs around my waist, she locks herself against me as I carry her to the bed.

"Show me how much you love me," she whispers.

I nuzzle her nose with mine. "Nothing would make me happier than losing myself in you, sweetheart. But if I do, I won't stop myself from marking you."

Her hands frame my face. "Would that be so terrible?"

I stiffen. "Once I mark you, there's no going back. You'd be mine forever. Are you absolutely certain?"

"We still have obstacles, I know that. But one thing's crystal clear—I want to be yours, and you to be mine. We were crafted for each other. So yes, Sebastian, mark me. Claim me. Make me yours in every way possible."
The Shattered Alpha's Heir

The crisp mountain air carried the scent of pine as Evelyn Sinclair tightened her grip on the dagger. Moonlight glinted off the silver blade, casting eerie shadows across the forest floor.

Selene, her wolf spirit, growled low in her mind. "We're being watched."

Evelyn didn't need the warning. Years of training under her father, Gregory Sinclair, had honed her instincts. She could feel the presence lurking just beyond the tree line—predatory, calculating.

Then the attack came.

A massive black wolf lunged from the darkness, fangs bared. Evelyn twisted, barely avoiding the snapping jaws. She countered with a swift kick to the creature's ribs, sending it crashing into a nearby oak.

The wolf shifted mid-fall, transforming into a broad-shouldered man with piercing amber eyes. Adrian Grey, future Alpha of Blackthorn Pack, wiped blood from his split lip.

"Still holding a grudge, Sinclair?" His voice was rough, edged with amusement.

Evelyn flipped the dagger in her hand. "You started this when you sabotaged my patrol route."

Adrian smirked. "And you ended it by dumping a bucket of wolfsbane on my head."

Before she could retort, a howl echoed through the trees—urgent, panicked. Both froze.

That wasn't part of their rivalry.

Adrian's expression darkened. "The eastern border."

They ran without another word, their feud forgotten. Because whatever was out there wasn't playing games.

And it smelled like death.

The clearing was a nightmare.

Bodies littered the ground, their throats torn out. Evelyn recognized Julian's face among them, his eyes frozen in terror. Her stomach twisted.

Adrian knelt beside the youngest victim—a boy no older than twelve. His hands shook as he closed the child's unseeing eyes.

"Victor Blackwood's work," he snarled.

Evelyn's blood ran cold. The banished Beta had returned. And if the carnage was any indication, he wasn't alone.

Selene's warning came too late.

The arrow struck Adrian square in the chest.

Evelyn barely caught him as he collapsed, her hands slick with his blood. Shadows moved at the edge of the clearing, laughter drifting on the wind.

Victor's voice slithered through the trees. "Tell your Alpha... the hunt has just begun."

Then silence.

Evelyn pressed her palm to Adrian's wound, his breath coming in ragged gasps. She made a vow then, teeth bared at the unseen enemy.

This time, the Guardian wouldn't hold back.

And the woods would run red before dawn.

###Chapter 0224

Sebastian lifts my body higher onto the bed, settling between my thighs. His elbows brace on either side of me, his kiss burning with the same desperate need I feel for him.

"I'll try to be gentle, Seraphina," he murmurs against my lips. "But gentle isn't exactly my strength."

"I won't shatter," I promise, dragging his mouth back to mine. His hands roam my body, possessive and hungry, pulling me closer. His lips trail down my throat, pausing at the curve where my collarbone meets my neck—the spot he’ll claim before dawn. The scrape of his teeth sends fire through my veins, pooling low in my stomach.

He worships his way down my body, taking one peaked nipple into his mouth while his hand kneads the other. A moan tears from my throat. My fingers tangle in his hair, yanking his head up until his dark eyes lock onto mine.

A growl rumbles through him before he switches sides, his teeth grazing the sensitive bud. The sharp pleasure-pain makes my back arch. He watches my reaction with predatory satisfaction as he continues lower, his breath hot against my stomach. "You smell intoxicating, little mate."

When he reaches my thighs, he hooks one leg over his shoulder, pinning the other with his forearm. His fingers stroke me, teasing.

"Sebastian." My voice is ragged—pleading, demanding, I don’t even know.

His palm presses flat against my stomach, holding me down as his mouth replaces his fingers. The first swipe of his tongue has me gasping. He works me with ruthless precision, adding two fingers inside me. "Drenched for me," he groans.

"Yes." The word is barely a whisper. My body coils tighter, pleasure building to an unbearable peak.

"Look at me."

I force my eyes open, meeting his gaze as he flicks his tongue over my clit before sucking hard. A third finger stretches me, his thrusts turning relentless. Just as I’m about to break, he curls his fingers and bites down.

Stars explode behind my eyelids. My scream echoes through the room as my body convulses around him. He doesn’t let up, forcing me through wave after wave until I’m trembling, oversensitive.

When the aftershocks fade, he withdraws his fingers, licking them clean with a satisfied smirk. He shoves his shorts off and covers me again, lifting my leg to hook around his waist. The thick length of him presses against my entrance, but he hesitates, forehead resting against mine.

"I don’t want to hurt you. You’re so fucking small—I feel like I’ll tear you apart."

I smile, tracing his jaw. "Sebastian Blackstone. The Moon Goddess made us for each other. I know exactly what I’m getting into—I didn’t nickname you 'giant' for your height." I kiss him softly. "We’ll go slow. Valeria heals fast."

"Tell me if it’s too much. I mean it." His voice is rough with restraint.

"If you don’t claim me tonight," I warn, nipping his lower lip, "you’ll answer to both me and my wolf."

He groans, sinking into me inch by torturous inch. The stretch burns, my nails digging into his shoulders. His muscles tremble with the effort to stay still.

"Forever, Seraphina?" he rasps when he meets resistance.

"Forever."

One sharp thrust seats him fully inside me. I hiss, but the pain quickly melts into overwhelming fullness. He waits, letting me adjust before pulling out and driving back in. The rhythm builds—slow, then deeper, harder. His grip on my hip tightens as he angles deeper, hitting a spot that makes me cry out.

I shatter first, my climax ripping through me. He doesn’t slow, pushing me into another, then another, until I’m sobbing from the intensity.

On my fourth peak, he snarls, "Mine," and bites down on my marking spot.

Ecstasy blinds me. My canines descend instinctively, and I sink them into his neck in return. The bond snaps into place, his emotions flooding me—relief, devotion, fierce love.

Sebastian roars, his release shaking the windows as he spills inside me.

I cling to him, our hearts pounding in sync.


###Chapter 0225

The taste of my mate was intoxicating, but it paled in comparison to the sensation of being buried deep inside her. She was impossibly tight, and I knew she must have torn. Thank the Moon Goddess for Valeria’s accelerated healing.

When she shifted beneath me, I took control. I needed to watch her unravel, to know I was the only man who could ever make her feel this way. One climax wasn’t enough. The way her body clenched around me was the most exquisite pleasure I’d ever known. I craved it again. And again.

By the fourth time, she was trembling, tears glistening on her cheeks. I couldn’t hold back any longer. My canines lengthened, the primal urge to claim her overwhelming.

"Mine."

As I pushed her over the edge once more, I sank my teeth into her neck. Her emotions flooded me—raw ecstasy, joy, an ocean of love. But before I could savor it, her own fangs pierced my skin.

Power surged through me, so intense I roared as I came. The world nearly went dark. Only the steady pull of her venom kept me grounded.

When she finally withdrew her fangs and sealed the wound with her tongue, I cupped her face. "Are you okay?"

She sniffled. "Never better."

I nuzzled her nose with mine. "Then why the tears?"

"It’s just... I never knew it could feel like this." I kissed another tear away as it trailed down her cheek.

"You’re mine now, Seraphina. No turning back." I started to pull out, but her hands locked onto my hips.

"Don’t. I like you inside me."

A groan rumbled in my chest. "Little angel, if I stay buried in you, it won’t take long for me to be ready again."

Her grin was pure mischief. "Is that a problem?"

With a growl, I flipped us over, leaving her straddling me. "Then take what you want."

She rose slightly before sinking back down, drawing a sharp gasp from me. "Aren’t you sore?"

"Advanced healing, remember?" She tossed her hair back, the dark waves cascading over my thighs as she began to move.

My hands settled on her hips, guiding her rhythm as her head tipped back. She was breathtaking—wild, untamed, mine.

"You’re fucking perfect." My thumbs brushed her nipples, teasing until her walls fluttered around me. "You were made for me."

"Going to come for me, little angel?"

Her smirk was downright sinful. "I’d rather make you lose control, Alpha."

I chuckled darkly. "Is that so?"

In one swift motion, I hauled us up the bed, pressing her hands against the headboard. "Hold on."

She rolled her hips, and I let her set the pace. There was something intoxicating about surrendering control to her—something I’d never done with anyone else.

Her stormy eyes locked onto mine, filled with hunger. Then, with a boldness that sent fire through my veins, she cupped her breast and brought it to my lips.

###Chapter 0226

My lips close around her nipple, sucking in perfect rhythm with her movements. Her eyes flutter shut as she throws her head back, riding me harder. One hand grips her breast, keeping it firmly in my mouth until she pulls away with a soft pop.

She slows her pace, bringing her other breast to my lips.

The moment I latch on, she's moving faster again. My free hand finds her clit, giving her exactly what she needs. I'm close, but I want her to come with me.

"Sebastian!" Her chant becomes a scream as her walls clench around me like a vise. I growl my release, teeth grazing her nipple as she shudders above me.

She collapses against my chest, breathless. Gods, I could spend eternity buried inside my Seraphina.

Through our bond, I feel her exhaustion mixed with smug satisfaction and overwhelming love. She needs food and rest. I mind-link the kitchen staff to send up a meal cart.

Scooping her into my arms, I carry her to the bathroom. The marble counter cools her skin as I turn on the shower. When the steam rises, I brush damp hair from her face.

"You're my entire world," I murmur against her temple.

Her fingers trace my jaw. "And you're mine."

The berry-scented shampoo fills the shower as I wash her hair. She clings to me while I rinse the suds away, then gasp when the washcloth grazes her bruises.

"Does this hurt?" I ask, gentle between her thighs.

She bites her lip. "In the best way."

The food arrives as I'm drying her off. I dress her in my shirt and pull on sweatpants before wheeling the cart to the loveseat.

She straddles my lap, feeding me strawberries between kisses that quickly turn hungry. The cart is forgotten as I take her again against the cushions, then later against the headboard, until dawn paints gold across her sleeping form.

Morning light reveals my mate in all her glory - tousled hair, love marks, and the new claiming bite on her neck. Peace settles in my chest where there was once only rage.

My lips trail down her stomach. The perfect breakfast awaits.

"Sebastian!" Her cry echoes through our chambers as I feast.

The best way to start any day.


They are officially mated!

###Chapter 0227

I awaken with Sebastian's weight still pressed between my thighs, his body heat seeping into my skin. Every muscle aches in delicious ways I'd never known possible. The bond hums between us, radiating his contentment that mirrors my own. For the first time in years, the hollow loneliness is gone.

He loves me. The certainty of it thrums through our connection, his joy at our completed bond as tangible as the morning light filtering through the curtains.

My head rests on his bare chest while his fingers trace idle patterns through my hair. The peaceful moment shatters when he speaks.

"We're meeting Adrian and his pack tonight about the vampire threat." His voice rumbles beneath my ear. "Since we missed visiting Victor yesterday, do you want to go this morning?"

I tilt my head up. Sebastian's gaze is fixed on the ceiling, but it drops to meet mine when I move. "I need to go. Don't you want answers, Sebastian? Don't you want to finally move forward?"

A heavy sigh escapes him as his eyes return to the ceiling. "More than anything. I want to bury this past and start fresh with you." His lips brush my forehead before he sits up. "Let's get dressed."

When I slide from the bed, his palm connects sharply with my backside. I whirl around, arching an eyebrow.

"Couldn't resist," he smirks, stretching his muscular frame.

"As for your things," he continues while pulling on black jeans, "I want them moved into this room today. Redecorate however you like. The only things I care about are those photos of my parents."

"We'll make new memories here," I promise, slipping into a sapphire blue top. "And yes, I'll move my things in. Not that I have much."

That boyish grin from his childhood photo transforms his face. In two strides he crushes me against him. "You and me together," he murmurs into my hair. "I'll never tire of hearing that."

Hand in hand, we descend to the dining hall. The instant we enter, conversation dies. My fingers tighten around Sebastian's.

His alpha voice rings out. "Thank you for your patience these past weeks. There will be a formal pack announcement soon, but today I present Seraphina Bennett - your future Luna."

Applause erupts. Sebastian guides me to a table before fetching our food. Multiple pack members approach to congratulate me, their eyes lingering on the mate mark displayed proudly at my collarbone. For once, I don't shrink from the attention.

Over breakfast, I observe how effortlessly Sebastian interacts with his pack. The respect they show him is palpable. When questions about my origins arise, he deftly redirects, promising full explanations during his announcement.

The dungeon stench hits us before we reach the bottom stairwell - urine, sweat, and despair. Sebastian's grip on my hand turns vise-like as we approach Victor Blackwood's cell.

The disgraced beta springs to his feet at our arrival. "The fuck, Alpha?" He spits the title like a curse. "Since when do you parade she-wolves through your torture chambers?"

"She's not here to watch," Sebastian growls.

"Oh, just to listen to you breaking my bones then? Classy."

Sebastian lunges. I intercept, pressing both palms against his chest until the murderous glint fades from his eyes.

When he's calmer, I turn to Victor. "I want to hear your answers."

"To which question?" Victor sneers. "He only ever asks one."

"Then answer it for me."

"Why?" His eyes narrow before suddenly widening. "Guardian." The word comes out reverent.

Sebastian yanks me behind him. "She's already marked. Don't even think about it."

Victor actually rolls his eyes. "I told you - what happened with Evelyn was a mistake. I wouldn't touch your mate."

"That's not why we're here," I interrupt before they can spiral into their usual argument.

Sebastian's question drops like a stone. "Why did you do it?"

"I didn't." Victor's gaze flicks between us. "Not that you'll believe me, even with your Guardian present."

Valeria's voice whispers through my mind. 'He speaks truth.' I already know - lies carry a metallic tang that's conspicuously absent.

"You were found holding her body," I press, stepping forward despite Sebastian's warning growl.

"Never denied that."

"Then explain why."

Victor's bitter laugh echoes off the stone walls. "Why bother? Your mate's made up his mind."

I turn to Sebastian, whose expectant look demands confirmation of Victor's guilt. My next words shatter his certainty.

"He's telling the truth."

###Chapter 0228

My fingers tighten around Seraphina's arm as I pull her away from the cells, putting distance between us and Victor. "What do you mean he's telling the truth? He was standing over her body."

She doesn't flinch. "He admits to being there. But every word he just said was true. Valeria confirms it."

No. No, this can't be right. My entire life has been built on hunting the man who murdered my mother, and now—what? He didn't do it? The ground feels unsteady beneath me.

"Then why was he there?" My voice is rough. I rake a hand through my hair, pacing. "Why was he holding her?"

Seraphina steps closer, her hands closing over mine. "I don't know. But he's the only one who can tell us."

I search her eyes. "You're certain?"

"Completely."

Fuck. All these years. All this rage. I've been torturing an innocent man.

I drag in a sharp breath. "If he lies—even once—you tell me."

"Of course, Sebastian." Her palm cups my cheek, and I lean into her touch like it's the only thing keeping me grounded.

"Always," she murmurs.

I press a kiss to her palm before releasing her. "Always, little angel."

When we return, I drag two chairs over, pulling Seraphina into my lap the moment I sit. I need her scent, her warmth, to keep the storm inside me at bay. She settles against me without protest, and only then do I meet Victor's gaze.

"You said it's a long story. Start from the beginning."

Victor

Why now? After years of torture, why does this arrogant Alpha suddenly want the truth? I don't want to relive this. But if it means clearing my name—if it means exposing Lucian Blackwood's lies, even in death—I'll do it.

I lower myself onto the thin mattress in my cell. "Do you know why I was banished?"

The Guardian—Seraphina—shakes her head, but Sebastian answers. "Your Alpha exiled you because your father betrayed the pack."

That's the story Lucian fed everyone. That my father turned traitor, murdered my younger brother and the Alpha heir, Leopold. That Lucian, in his mercy, spared my life.

Every word of it was a lie.

"That's the story Lucian told to save face." My hands clench. "Do you want the truth?"

Seraphina shifts slightly against Sebastian. "Yes. We do."

I scrub my face, then begin.

"I was twelve. My brother Tristan was fifteen, training to take our father's place as Beta. Leopold Blackwood was worse than his father—a spoiled, vicious brat who thought being an Alpha heir made him a god."

"Leopold was seventeen when it happened. He and his friends took Tristan into the woods. I don't know if it was planned or just bad luck, but they stumbled across a mother cougar and her cubs."

"Leopold ordered my brother to prove his worth as Beta by protecting him. Then he ran. Left Tristan alone against an enraged predator defending her young." My throat tightens. "My father and I found him torn apart. Claw marks shredded his body."

"My father confronted Lucian and Leopold. Leopold claimed if Tristan had been worthy, he'd have survived. Lucian said my father failed to raise a strong Beta." A bitter laugh escapes me. "My father snapped. He challenged Leopold to a duel."

"Lucian forbade it, but Leopold accepted. My father won. And in his grief—his rage—he didn't let Leopold yield. He killed him."

###Chapter 0229

Alpha Lucian was devastated, losing his sole heir to the Alpha bloodline. He condemned my father to execution. At twelve years old, I was forced to witness Alpha Lucian behead my father, declaring him a traitor responsible for both Leopold's and Tristan's deaths. As a twisted act of mercy, I was banished—sent away with nothing but the tattered clothes on my back. Mercy? After those lies spread, no pack would shelter me. I became a rogue, barely scraping by in the wilderness.

I pause, fingers tangling in my filthy, matted hair. The Guardian's eyes glisten with tears. Sebastian's gaze is steel, but it's him I focus on as I continue.

"Months passed before I encountered Luna Isolde. I was near a lake just beyond your territory, desperate for food. Your mother recognized me immediately. She sat beside me, asking how I survived. When she saw my state—starving, wearing rags—she told me to return the next day."

"I thought it was a trap, but hunger won. I hid nearby until I saw her arrive with a basket—food, clothes, even a hunting knife. She asked what else I needed, where I slept, if I was safe. After that day, we met weekly. Sometimes she read to me."

My eyes lock with Sebastian's. "Your mother was the only light in my darkness. She never believed Lucian's lies about my father. Her kindness kept me alive. Without her, I'd have died in those woods."

I swallow hard. "I tracked Alpha Lucian's movements, waiting for revenge. That's how I learned his plan—to conquer Blackthorn Pack first, but their twin Guardians made them too strong. So he targeted Nightshade. His strategy? Kill Luna Isolde to weaken Alpha Cassian, then seize your pack lands. He even planned to take a new mate, sire another heir."

"On the battle day, I followed his warriors into your territory. By the time I found your mother..." My voice cracks. "One of Lucian's soldiers had already reached her."

Memories choke me. "She was still breathing when I got there. Her last words were to stay strong." I can still feel her trembling hand against my cheek before it fell lifeless.

"What happened next is blurred. I remember holding her body when warriors found us. They assumed I murdered her. So I ran. I've been running for years."

A bitter laugh escapes me. "My birth killed my own mother. Luna Isolde was the closest I ever had to a parent. And I failed to protect her."

###Chapter 0230

Tears streamed down my cheeks as Victor finished his account. Every word rang with undeniable truth. Not a single note of deception colored his story. Sebastian had seated me in the second chair before beginning his restless pacing. Through our bond, I sensed his turmoil, the frustration churning inside him.

"Why didn't you tell my father this story back then?" Sebastian demanded.

"Your father was drowning in grief, consumed by vengeance. He wouldn't have listened to me any more than you have these past six months."

The words struck Sebastian like physical blows. I felt their impact through our connection. He knew Victor spoke the truth, and the realization was eating him alive.

I rose and went to him. For a moment he remained rigid, then his arms encircled me. He buried his face in my neck, inhaling deeply as he fought for composure. We stood locked together until his breathing steadied.

When he pulled back, his gaze returned to Victor. "What about Evelyn? Why try to forcibly mark her?"

Victor stood and began pacing the confined space. "Too many power-hungry, incompetent Alphas exist. They care nothing for their packs, only their own ambitions. As a rogue, I encountered countless wolves who'd fled such tyrants. The Alpha bloodline is flawed. Corrupt fathers breed worse sons, creating miserable packs with nowhere for decent wolves to go."

I understood this better than Sebastian ever could. Six years on the run had shown me exactly the suffering Victor described.

"What does this have to do with Evelyn?" I asked softly. Sebastian moved behind me, his arms encircling my waist, anchoring me against him.

"I wanted to build a sanctuary. A safe haven for those fleeing abusive packs or seeking fresh starts. To establish such a pack, I needed a strong Luna. As a Beta's second son, I required that strength. And no one is stronger than a Guardian." Victor's shoulders slumped. "Forcing the bond was wrong. I'll carry that regret forever."

Sebastian studied me thoughtfully before addressing Victor. "I need time to process this. Evelyn and Adrian arrive tonight. No decisions will be made until we speak with them."

Victor nodded and returned to his seat. Sebastian turned to the guards. "See he gets a shower, clean clothes, and proper meals. Move him to a fresher cell." Victor's head snapped up in surprise.

"Yes, Alpha," the guards chorused.

As we turned to leave, Victor spoke. "Thank you, Alpha."

Sebastian gave a curt nod but kept moving, his grip on my hand unyielding. Upstairs, he pulled me into a crushing embrace. His guilt and frustration pulsed through our bond.

"Clean slate, remember?" I murmured.

"How could I have been so blind? I nearly executed an innocent man. Instead, I've tormented the wolf who tried to save my mother."

"The past can't be changed. Only the future." I held him tighter.

He exhaled sharply before stepping back. "Come. I've got a surprise before your training with Gregory."

We drove to the border district, stopping before a sleek salon. My pulse jumped when I recognized our destination. "A haircut?" Excitement made me bounce in my seat.

###Chapter 0231

"Absolutely. I remember how much you've been wanting this haircut, so I booked the appointment yesterday." Sebastian moves swiftly to help me out of the truck, his fingers lacing with mine as we step into the salon.

A young she-wolf with bright eyes greets us immediately. "Alpha. Luna." She dips her head respectfully, her gaze lingering on my hair. "Your hair is stunning. That shade of white is incredibly rare."

She guides me toward the washing station, glancing at Sebastian. "Alpha, you're welcome to wait in the lounge."

He doesn’t budge.

"Or," she amends quickly, pointing to a chair nearby, "you can sit right there. I’ll position her beside you."

This time, he complies, though his eyes never leave me.

I recline as warm water cascades over my scalp. "Your hair is so thick," the stylist murmurs. "How much are we taking off today? Just a trim?"

"I want it short enough that I don’t sit on it anymore. It’s been getting tangled too easily, and it’s too heavy to put up. Maybe just past my waist?"

She works efficiently, rinsing and towel-drying before leading me to the chair beside Sebastian. "I can thin it out if the weight is still an issue," she offers.

Sebastian shakes his head before I can respond.

I smirk at him. "You like it this way?"

"Obviously. Unless you truly hate it, leave the thickness. I love the way it feels when I run my hands through it."

The stylist—Cassandra—sighs dramatically at his words. I catch her eye in the mirror. "You heard him. No thinning. Just shorten it."

Forty-five minutes later, my hair is sleek and freshly cut, falling just where I wanted. Sebastian stands behind me, his fingers combing through the strands. "Happy?"

"Much better. Still long, but lighter."

Cassandra beams. "I took off about six inches. It’ll grow back healthier now."

Sebastian handles the payment, and we head back to the packhouse. "Change quickly. I’ll take you to Gregory’s."

"Valeria could run me there."

"I don’t know when I’ll be free to pick you up later, so I’d rather drive you now and have someone bring you back." He hesitates. "You need your own car too. More independence."

"I don’t know how to drive."

He freezes mid-step, turning sharply. "What?"

I shrug. "My family fled when I was ten. The vampires took me at sixteen. Not exactly a lot of driving lessons in between. Honestly, riding in your truck was only the second time I’d been in a car since I was a kid."

His jaw tightens. "When was the first time?"

I don’t answer.

"Seraphina." His voice drops dangerously. "When?"

"When they shoved me into their trunk after capturing me."

A growl rips from his throat, raw and furious. I press against him immediately, my arms locking around his waist. "I’m safe now. But seriously, don’t buy me a car. I’d probably crash it into a tree."

"I’ll teach you." His tone leaves no room for argument.

I frown. He’s already drowning in responsibilities, especially with the looming vampire threat.

"Go change," he says firmly, cutting off my protest. "Gregory’s waiting."

I swallow my words. There’ll be time to argue later.

###Chapter 0232

I escort Seraphina to Gregory's place personally. He needs to understand she's still recovering from yesterday's ordeal and exhausted from our marking ceremony last night.

After extracting promises that he won't push her too hard, I pull her aside.

"Valeria." Dorian surges forward, demanding her full attention. I grip her shoulders firmly when I notice the golden ring around Valeria's eyes and Seraphina's irises shifting from gray to olive green.

"Don't run home alone. We don't know if more vampires are lurking nearby. The patrols are watching our borders, but they're hunting you specifically. I won't risk your safety when I'm not there to protect you."

"Yes, Alpha." She tilts her neck in submission, catching me off guard. My heart skips before I lean down to gently nip her skin, trailing kisses up to her lips.

"I love you too much to lose you now." The words burn my throat. She nods, and I steal one last kiss before leaving, the weight on my chest lighter than before.

Driving back to the packhouse, I mentally catalog my priorities. The alliance meeting tonight comes first—I need Anders and Adrian's input on strategy. Then there's the matter of Victor Blackwood. If he didn't kill my mother, keeping him imprisoned serves no purpose. Evelyn and Adrian should agree to release him. He's suffered enough for hurting Evelyn, and Seraphina confirms his remorse is genuine. I'll provide funds to give him a fresh start elsewhere.

Next is planning Seraphina's Luna ceremony. The city can't wait either—new employees need onboarding, quarterly reports require review, and contingency plans must be drafted in case I fall during the vampire conflict. My mate might already carry my heir. They'll want for nothing if I don't survive.

Back in my office, I finalize meeting preparations before calling Lawrence at Blackstone Enterprises. "I'll be in tomorrow overnight," I inform him. I intend to take Seraphina shopping, dine at Celestia, and stroll through Crestview's central park. My penthouse has been completely remodeled since Isolde's time—every inch will be new for my angel.

Nathaniel interrupts my thoughts. "The others will arrive within thirty minutes. Should we serve refreshments now or wait?"

"Set up a buffet in the side room. We'll decide about dinner afterward."

The meeting room is ready when Alistair and Adrian arrive with Evelyn, Gregory, and Donovan trailing behind. Evelyn brushes a kiss against my cheek. "Seraphina's showering. She'll join us shortly."

I turn to Gregory. "How was her training today?"

"Remarkable. The mating bond suits her well—suits both of you." His approving smile warms something primal in my chest.

###Chapter 0233

"That was incredible."

Theron gives me a firm pat on the shoulder. "Good thing I trained with you when I did. You'd wipe the floor with me now."

"What do you mean?" I frown, not following his train of thought.

He studies me with raised brows. "You didn't notice? The energy surge when you marked her?"

"I felt something. Thought it was just the mating bond settling. Didn't realize it was Guardian magic."

Both Theron and Alistair shake their heads. "That's pure Guardian energy," Theron explains. "Her power flowed into you during the marking. Now you share her abilities—diminished versions, but still potent."

Well, damn. I knew Theron had gained strength after mating Evelyn, but inheriting Seraphina's Guardian gifts? That changes everything. My mind races with possibilities.

Before I can voice my thoughts, the door opens.

My entire world narrows to her presence. My feet move before my brain catches up. I know I'm grinning like an idiot, but I haven't seen my mate in hours. Her scent hits me first—vanilla and thunderstorms—and suddenly everything clicks into place.

I crush her against me, inhaling deeply at the curve of her neck. "Missed you," I murmur into her skin.

Her arms tighten around my waist. "Missed you more."

Pulling back just enough to see her face, I keep her locked against me. "Did you eat? You must be starving."

"Ravenous," she admits with a laugh.

I jerk my chin toward the buffet. "Grab whatever you want. Formal dinner's later if you're staying."

The group migrates toward the food. I keep Seraphina tucked against my side as we join them. Balancing two plates proves tricky—I refuse to let her go completely. She snags bottled waters while I pile our plates high.

We settle at the conference table's end. Ignoring her raised eyebrow, I pull her onto my lap and press a kiss to her nose. She huffs but starts eating without protest.

Once everyone's seated, I call the meeting to order.

"We know why we're here. Vampires have a bounty on Seraphina's head because she's a Guardian. They kept her captive for seven years as a blood source. Now that they've found her, more will come. And when they do..." I let the implication hang. "They'll discover we have three Guardians, putting both our packs at risk."

"Agreed," Theron says. "What intel do we have on vampires?" His gaze sweeps the room.

Alistair clears his throat. "Historical records show minimal interaction. They dislike our taste, we can't stand their stench. Mutual avoidance worked for centuries."

A heavy silence follows.

"They're faster than wolves," Seraphina murmurs.

"True," I confirm. "Couldn't see them coming during the attack."

Theron's head snaps up. "You couldn't track their movements?"

"No. You could?" He nods.

"Did you two complete the bond before or after the attack?"

"After. Why?"

Theron looks between us. "Seraphina, could you see them?"

"Clearly. But I knew Sebastian couldn't."

Theron smirks at me. "Bet you'll see them just fine now. Perks of mating a Guardian."

###Chapter 0234

"Why would mating with me help Sebastian see the vampires?" I ask Adrian.

His golden eyes gleam with certainty. "When Evelyn and I completed our bond, I gained some of her Guardian abilities—just not as strong as hers. You'll share your gifts with Sebastian too, including vampire sight." His fingers tap against the armrest. "I became faster after mating. He'll experience the same enhancement."

I twist to face Sebastian. "Do you feel different?"

His arms tighten around my waist. "Felt the power surge when you marked me." His lips brush my temple. "Haven't had time to test anything else yet."

Gregory clears his throat sharply. "Focus. We need a strategy to keep those bloodsuckers away from Seraphina and Evelyn—especially now that Evelyn's pregnant." His jaw tightens. "We don't know how that affects her... appeal to them."

"You mean I might taste better now?" Evelyn grimaces as Adrian snarls.

"Too many unknowns." Gregory rubs his temples. "I'll ask Oberon to bring any relevant texts when he visits this weekend."

Alistair leans forward, spreading a map across the table. "We should integrate patrols—your warriors with ours, and vice versa." His finger traces the border between our territories. "This way both packs learn each other's terrain. We can reinforce weaknesses faster."

Sebastian's chin rests on my shoulder. "I agree. Our packs need to memorize every vulnerability in both territories." His gaze locks with Adrian's. "Do you trust me enough to grant that level of access to Blackthorn lands?"

Adrian studies him for three heartbeats. "We're family. I'd trust you with my life—and my pack's." A challenge glints in his eyes. "The real question is whether you'll grant Nightshade the same privilege."

I tilt my head up at Sebastian. When our eyes meet, I give a subtle nod. These people have proven their loyalty.

Sebastian kisses my forehead before addressing Adrian. "Family bonds don't come naturally to me." His hand finds mine. "But I trust everyone in this room. Nightshade's borders are open to you."

"Excellent!" Alistair weights the map's corners with whiskey glasses. "We've marked vulnerable areas in our territory." His finger lands on a jagged ravine between our lands. "This no-man's-land in Black Canyon is our biggest weakness. Yesterday proved how hard it is to defend."

Sebastian stands abruptly, depositing me back in the chair as he looms over the map. "Or we use it as bait." His finger stabs the canyon. "Lure them in and attack from both sides."

For hours, they strategize—exchanging intel on border weaknesses, designing traps in the canyon, coordinating communication signals. They debate bunker placements for elders, children, and pregnant females, voices rising and falling like tides.

The war plans unfold with terrifying precision.

Adrian's suggestion that Evelyn should oversee the underground bunker sparked immediate tension. Evelyn's eyes flashed with defiance as she squared her shoulders. "I won't be sitting this fight out," she declared, her voice sharp.

The argument escalated until Alistair chuckled, glancing at Gregory. "Seems my son needs to learn the same lesson Ivy taught me years ago." Gregory smirked. "I wouldn't bet against Evelyn on this one."

While they debated, I drifted toward the food table. My stomach twisted too tightly for hunger, but the talk of vampires, battle strategies, and potential losses gnawed at me. Even across the room, I felt Sebastian's gaze burning into my back—our bond betraying my unease.

I grabbed a water bottle, twisting the cap with shaky fingers. Gregory wheeled beside me. "How are you holding up, Seraphina?"

"Fine," I lied, forcing a smile.

His knowing look cut through me. "Try again."

Tears pricked my eyes. I squeezed them shut, but one escaped. "I'm terrified," I whispered.

He clasped my hand. "I'd worry if you weren't."

A growl ripped through the room before I could speak again. "Don't even think about leaving," Sebastian snarled, suddenly inches away. His golden eyes blazed. "I'll track you to the ends of the earth and drag you back."

I flinched. He'd been listening closer than I realized.

"But—"

"No." Gregory cut me off. "Sebastian's right. Come here." He guided me to a chair, his wheelchair creaking as he turned to face me. "Just because they haven't found us yet doesn't mean they've stopped looking. This is our chance to end the threat on our terms. Otherwise..." His jaw tightened. "They'll strike when we least expect it. Evelyn or I—or both of us—could end up caged like you were."

Adrian's snarl vibrated through the room. "Over my dead body."

"And we all pray it won't come to that," Gregory said quietly. "But make no mistake—they are coming."

###Chapter 0235

Tension crackled in the air when Adrian informed Evelyn she'd be responsible for the civilians in the bunker. Evelyn's eyes flashed with defiance. "I won't be sitting this fight out," she snapped.

Their argument escalated until Alistair chuckled, glancing at Gregory. "Seems my son needs to learn the same lesson Ivy taught me decades ago."

Gregory smirked. "I wouldn't bet against Evelyn if I were you."

While they debated, I drifted toward the refreshments. My stomach churned too much for food, but the grim talk of vampires, battles, and potential losses gnawed at me. Sebastian's gaze burned into my back despite his involvement in the strategy session—our bond transmitting my unease.

I twisted the cap off a water bottle. The cool liquid did nothing to soothe the dread coiling in my chest.

Gregory rolled up beside me. "How you holding up, kid?"

"Fine," I lied.

His wheelchair creaked as he leaned forward. "Try again."

Hot tears pricked my eyes. I clenched my fists until my nails bit into my palms. "I'm terrified," I whispered.

He captured my trembling hands. "I'd worry more if you weren't."

A shuddering breath escaped me. "They're coming for me. They don't know about you or Evelyn. If I left—"

A guttural growl cut through the room. "Don't even fucking think about running." Sebastian's voice dripped with lethal promise. "I'll track you to the ends of the earth and drag you back."

My pulse spiked. Apparently, he'd been monitoring me closer than I realized.

"But Sebastian—"

"He's right, Seraphina." Gregory squeezed my fingers. "Come here." He guided me to a chair, positioning his wheelchair directly in front of me.

"Just because they haven't found us yet doesn't mean they've stopped looking. This is our best chance to eliminate the threat on our terms. Otherwise, they'll strike when we least expect it—and next time, Evelyn or I might end up in chains."

Adrian snarled, "Over my rotting corpse."

"We all pray it won't come to that," Gregory continued. "But make no mistake—they will come. These monsters slaughter without remorse. They just don't realize they'll face three Guardians and two Alphas enhanced by Guardian bonds." His gaze swept the room before returning to me. "This is our opportunity."

"I know I should be stronger—"

Gregory gripped my chin, forcing eye contact. "You survived seven years in their clutches and still have the courage to fight. That's strength. Your instinct to protect others by sacrificing yourself? That's what Guardians do. Starting tomorrow, we intensify your training. I'll forge you into a weapon worthy of your pack."

"Thank you," I murmured, embracing him.

"Anytime, kid."

Final plans solidified over dinner. Nathaniel had the kitchen staff deliver meals while we cleared the tactical maps.

Sebastian pulled me against his chest, his heartbeat thundering against my ear. "You and me, Seraphina. That means no vanishing acts. Promise me."

I tilted my head up, drinking in the fierce determination in his golden eyes. "You and me," I vowed. "Always."

###Chapter 0236

My heart nearly stopped when Seraphina suggested leaving to protect the packs. Like hell I'd let my mate walk away. Thank the moon Gregory agreed with me and made her see reason.

Her promise to stay eased the tightness in my chest. Not completely—this won't be over until we end it—but for now, my Seraphina remains safe beside me.

I turn to Adrian and Evelyn as we settle at the table. "There's another matter. Victor Blackwood."

Adrian pauses with his fork halfway to his mouth. "What about him?"

"He didn't kill my mother." The entire table goes still. Seraphina's fingers twine with mine beneath the wood.

"You're certain?" Adrian's eyes narrow.

"I trust Seraphina and Valeria. They say he's telling the truth." All attention shifts to my mate, and I feel her discomfort ripple through our bond.

"He can't lie to them," I clarify.

"It's more like...tasting deception," Seraphina murmurs.

Gregory leans forward. "Make sure Oberon knows about that ability. It wasn't among the gifts he listed."

Alistair exhales sharply. "If Victor didn't do it, who did?"

I lay out the entire story—from Tristan's murder, to my mother helping Victor, to her death.

Alistair and Gregory exchange a loaded glance.

"What?" I demand.

"We never believed the official story either," Alistair admits. "Until Victor kidnapped Evelyn, I thought him innocent. Had I known a child from Obsidian Moon was hiding nearby..." He shakes his head. "I'd have offered sanctuary."

"He was twelve," my softhearted mate adds.

Adrian studies me. "So what now?"

I meet his gaze squarely. "I've punished him for six months—partly for Evelyn, mostly for my mother." Seraphina squeezes my hand, her quiet strength steadying me. "I want to release him."

Adrian's eyebrows shoot up. "Just like that?"

"Yes. But I won't make this decision without you two."

Evelyn's gaze turns thoughtful. "Where is he now?"

"Still in the cells."

"Bring him here. I want to speak with him."

"No!" Adrian's roar shakes the windows. Exactly how I'd react in his place.

Evelyn cups his face, her thumb stroking the tense muscle in his jaw. "What he did was wrong, but his intentions weren't. Let's hear him out. He can't mark me now—I'm safe."

I already know she'll win this argument. Adrian once told me: 'Be whatever she needs. Because she expects it.' Seraphina's making me a better man—not the path I'd have chosen alone, but the right one with her beside me. She submits because she trusts me, and I'll spend eternity proving worthy of that trust.

"You stay by my side," Adrian growls, hauling Evelyn onto his lap and burying his nose in her scent.

"Always," she murmurs, arms looping around his neck.

After a long breath, Adrian nods at me. "Bring him up."

I mind-link the guards. When Victor enters, he freezes at the sight of us.

"Judgment day?" His voice cracks as he steps inside.

###Chapter 0237

I rise and pull out a chair for him. I position it carefully, keeping distance from both Seraphina and Evelyn. No way I'm letting him near my mate either.

"Sit." My tone leaves no room for argument. A sharp nod sends the guards outside.

"Alpha Sebastian shared your story," Gregory says.

"Every word is true."

"We're aware," Gregory replies while Alistair frowns. "Guardian gifts don't lie."

Victor's gaze flicks to Seraphina, and a growl rumbles in my chest.

He rolls his eyes. "Relax. I'm not after your mate. Already told you I regret what happened with Evelyn." He turns to her. "I owe you an apology. What I did was unforgivable."

Evelyn glances at Seraphina, who gives a subtle nod. He's sincere.

Her eyes shift to Adrian. I see the conflict in his posture—personal vengeance versus his mate's wishes.

"What would you do if we released you?" Adrian finally asks.

Victor blinks, scanning each face in the room. "Is this a test?"

"No games," I say. "I kept you locked up believing you killed my mother. Now that I know the truth, I've got no reason to hold you. Adrian and Evelyn have their own grievances."

"And Sebastian seems to think six months of beatings settled your debt to Evelyn," Adrian adds.

Evelyn steps forward, ignoring Adrian's warning growl. "Seraphina confirmed your remorse. If you truly regret your actions, then yes, I consider your debt paid. But answer Adrian's question—what happens if we let you go?"

Victor shrugs. "Honestly? Been running for two decades. Don't even know how to live normally anymore."

"I'll give you startup funds, but you're banned from my territory," I state.

"Understood."

Adrian's jaw tightens before he turns to me. "Fine. Let him go."

Victor's shock is almost comical. "You're serious?"

"Dead serious. I'm heading to the city tomorrow. You'll ride with me, get your money, and disappear. Until then, you'll have a guarded room. One hostile move toward any pack member, and you're dead. Clear?"

"Crystal." He stands, then pauses. "Thank you. All of you."

The door closes behind him as I mind-link the guards with instructions.

"Meeting adjourned," I announce.

Seraphina and I escort everyone out.

Adrian pauses on the porch. "I'll send over patrol schedules tomorrow."

"Nathaniel will coordinate with you. We start joint patrols at dusk. I'll be in the city overnight—call if anything comes up."

Handshakes are exchanged with Adrian, Alistair, and Gregory. Evelyn hugs us both. Seraphina surprises Gregory with an embrace before they leave.

She returns to my side, pressing against me as their cars disappear. "You okay?"

Her cheek rests against my chest. "Is it strange that Gregory feels like a father to me?"

"Honestly? Everything about this is strange. Your Guardian spirit was mated to his wolf. They had a daughter together who's technically your ancestor. Most messed-up family tree I've ever seen." I kiss her hair. "But family's family. Father, brother, sister—they're yours, which makes them mine too. And gods know we could use more family."

She smiles up at me. I lead her back inside, toward our room.

Our room.

Damn, that sounds perfect.

###Chapter 0238

I'm stunned that Sebastian agreed to release Victor. Even more shocking—Adrian gave his approval too. But relief washes over me. Valeria and I both sensed Victor's sincerity in every word he spoke today.

Exhaustion weighs me down after the long day, but it evaporates when my mate starts undressing for bed. He turns, catching my stare. "I sleep naked. Unless you want me to keep these on?" His smirk sends heat through my veins.

I move toward him, fingers working the buttons of my blouse. His gaze darkens as the fabric slips from my shoulders. The bra follows, hitting the floor with a whisper. My palms glide over his sculpted abdomen, tracing every ridge down to that tempting V.

That's all the invitation he needs.

In one motion, he lifts me, carrying me to bed where he reminds me—repeatedly—exactly how much he adores me.

Morning finds me pleasantly sore, sprawled across Sebastian's chest again. How do I always end up here? When I try to slip away, his arm locks around me like steel.

"Leaving before breakfast, little star?" His sleep-roughened voice ignites sparks low in my belly. Is this constant hunger normal for new mates? Or is it just my insatiable Alpha?

'Both,' Valeria purrs.

I prop my chin on his chest. "Thought you were asleep."

"House rules—I get breakfast in bed." His hands span my waist. "And today, I'm craving something sweet."

Before I can react, he hoists me up. "Ride my face."

My breath hitches.

"Hands on the headboard." He positions me over him, grip firm on my thighs. "Eyes on me, little star."

When I obey, he devours me like a starving man—until I'm shaking, crying his name to the ceiling. Goddess, the man worships his morning meal.

After showering (and another round against the tiles), I head downstairs while Sebastian meets with Donovan. Nathaniel's joining our trip, so Donovan's taking charge.

The kitchen scene freezes me mid-step.

A male Omega—the Lead, judging by his stance—has his hand raised over a cowering girl. Her cheek already bears a red mark. Another younger Omega clutches her shirt from behind.

"What's happening here?" My voice cracks like a whip.

The man sneers. "Not your concern. Get out."

I step closer. Both girls look barely eighteen. After enduring abuse myself, I'll be damned if I let it continue under my nose.

"I asked a question. Why are you striking pack members?"

His lip curls. "Rogue sluts don't give orders here. Alpha's whore or not, this is my domain."

Apparently, news of our mating hasn't reached everyone.

When his hand swings toward the girl again, I intercept his wrist mid-air. Valeria's fury merges with mine, our combined aura slamming him to his knees.

'Shield the girls,' I warn her.

His yelp draws a flood of pack members. They take one look at me restraining him and charge—until my aura flattens them against the floor, necks bared. More wolves rush in, only to join the growing pile of subdued bodies.

Nathaniel skids in, hitting my aura's wall. "Seraphina! What—"

Valeria snarls through me. "Is abuse standard in your pack?" My power slams into him. He bares his throat but stays upright.

"Let's discuss this," he grits out.

"Discuss?" I gesture to the twenty wolves groveling around us. "Your pack attacked first."

Sebastian's voice cuts through the tension. "Valeria. Release them."

I meet his gaze.

"No." My aura rolls over him too.

###Chapter 0239

My meeting with Donovan was wrapping up when Nathaniel's panicked mind link hit me like a freight train.

"Alpha, kitchen. Now." His voice came through gritted teeth, laced with pain.

"What happened?"

"Just...get...here..." Each word sounded like it cost him.

I bolted from my office, taking the stairs three at a time. The scene in the kitchen froze me mid-step.

Every pack member knelt with necks bared—including my strongest warriors. Nathaniel stood off to the side, barely upright, his submission clear despite his struggle.

At the center stood my mate, gripping Reginald's wrist as the Lead Omega knelt before her. Behind them, two young Omegas huddled against the wall, untouched by the suffocating aura that had everyone else gasping.

No time to wonder why they were immune. The pack was suffering.

"Seraphina, explain this."

She turned—and I saw Valeria's golden eyes blazing. "Drop the aura. Now."

The force hit me like a battering ram. My back foot slid half an inch before I locked my knees.

Don't you fucking kneel, Dorian.

Try me. My wolf snarled back. Submission had its place—behind closed doors, not when my mate was crushing our pack under her power.

"Talk to me. I can't fix what I don't understand."

She jerked her chin toward the cowering girls. "He was beating them."

Reginald spat on the tiles. "Lies!"

Copper flooded my tongue. Seraphina's growl shook the room. "The taste of your deceit is—"

"Metallic." I finished. Her head whipped toward me.

"Yes. Like blood and pennies." A Guardian trait I'd apparently inherited.

I crouched before the girls. The older one flinched when I reached for her bruise.

"Why are you scared of me?" I kept my voice softer than the whimper she made.

Her darting eyes landed on Reginald before skittering away. Seraphina's answering snarl made the bastard whimper.

"Answer me." I caught her chin gently. "No Omega should fear their Alpha."

The younger one pointed a shaking finger. "He said you'd banish us if we complained."

Dorian's roar in my skull matched the fury burning through my veins. Every pack member had the right to bring grievances directly to me. This corruption festered because I'd been spread too thin.

The kitchen reeked of fear and betrayal. But worst of all? The metallic stench of lies from the man who'd poisoned my pack against me.

###Chapter 0240

"Has this ever occurred before?" The elder girl glanced at her younger sister before turning to me with a nod.

"Where are your guardians?"

"Gone. We're alone in this world."

"Who's responsible for you?"

Their fingers pointed straight at Reginald. That arrangement ends now.

I rose and returned to Seraphina, brushing my lips against her temple. "What consequence would you deem appropriate for Reginald?"

Her eyes widened at my question. "You're the future Luna who caught him red-handed."

I didn't miss how Reginald flinched when I mentioned her title. Had he truly been oblivious? My mark adorned her neck, for moon's sake.

"What's the customary penalty for abusing pack members—especially minors under one's care?" she countered.

"Strip all rank. In this case, he'd lose his Lead Omega status and revert to basic Omega. Typically followed by two to four weeks in confinement."

Her next question made Nathaniel inhale sharply. "And the punishment for calling his future Luna a rogue slut?"

My reaction was instinctive. One hand locked around Reginald's throat, lifting him off the ground. "Disrespecting one's Luna warrants death or exile."

"Too merciful," Seraphina declared. She knelt before the girls with a conspiratorial smile. "What's the most dreaded chore in the packhouse?"

"Scrubbing toilets," they chorused.

"Perfect." She straightened, meeting my gaze as understanding dawned. "Permanent sanitation duty."

"You heard your Luna. After your cell time, you'll report to the lavatories." I released him, watching him scramble backward. Nathaniel seized his arm, hauling him toward detention.

The dining hall remained packed with silent observers.

"Show's over," I announced. Turning to Nathaniel, I asked, "Who can foster these girls?"

"I'll take them, Alpha." A petite woman approached, her gaze fixed on the sisters.

"Gwendolyn?"

She met my eyes. "My mate and I have longed for children. We'd cherish them as our own."

Crouching before the girls again, I asked, "Would you like to live with Gwendolyn and her partner?"

After exchanging glances, they nodded. I kept hold of their small hands. "Your names?" I might not know every pup in the pack, but these two would forever be etched in my memory.

"Isabelle," said the elder. "This is Rosalind."

"From today onward," I promised, "if anyone troubles you, come directly to me, to Seraphina,"—I gestured to Nathaniel—"or your Beta. No one can deny you that right. Understood?"

"Yes, Alpha," they whispered before joining Gwendolyn.

"Get them settled," I instructed. "Find replacements for kitchen duty." Nathaniel was already summoning Omegas to resume breakfast service.

Before leaving, the sisters dashed back to embrace Seraphina. "Thank you, Luna," they breathed before retreating to Gwendolyn.

I pulled Seraphina against me. "Quite the power display, little Guardian. Next time, perhaps less theatrics? Command respect without inducing terror."

"I lost control," she admitted. "If this was pack tradition, Valeria and I wouldn't tolerate it."

"Nor would I." My lips found hers. "Later, you'll demonstrate how you shielded those girls with your aura. That was extraordinary." Breaking apart, I nodded toward the exit. "Gather what we need. The city awaits."

###Chapter 0241

We gathered Victor and Nathaniel before making our way into the city. Upon arrival, Sebastian took Victor to a boutique for new clothes and a backpack, then purchased his bus ticket.

"Where to? The next departure heads west to Crestview," Sebastian offered.

"That'll do," Victor replied gruffly.

Sebastian handed him a thick envelope. "Enough to rebuild your life. Good luck, Victor."

With muttered thanks, Victor boarded the bus. We watched until the vehicle disappeared down the highway.

The human city overwhelmed my senses. Towering structures pierced the sky while endless streams of honking vehicles clogged the streets. I clung to Sebastian's hand like an anchor in the chaos.

His penthouse took my breath away. Floor-to-ceiling windows showcased the glittering skyline. "Incredible," I breathed.

Sebastian's arms encircled me from behind. "The view's not what's breathtaking." His warm breath tickled my ear as he stared at me instead of the cityscape.

Heat flooded my cheeks.

"Ready to visit the office?" he asked. "I'd feel better having you nearby after recent events."

Through our bond, I sensed his unease. Truthfully, I'd be lost alone in this concrete jungle. Perhaps I could assist him somehow. "Let's go."

Nathaniel joined us as we descended to Blackstone Enterprises' executive floor. The moment we entered, my body locked in shock.

There she stood - dyed hair, oversized clothes, thick glasses - but those eyes remained unmistakable. The same eyes that kept me sane through seven years of darkness.

"Genevieve," I choked out.

"Mate," Nathaniel growled simultaneously, lunging forward.

Sebastian blocked him with a sharp whisper. "She's human. Control yourself or you'll terrify her."

Nathaniel trembled, fists clenched at his sides.

Meanwhile, Genevieve's whisper barely reached human ears. "It's really you."

"Genevieve!" I rushed forward, embracing her tightly. "You're alive! When I escaped, I feared the worst. I've searched everywhere-"

I held her at arm's length. "You worried about me? I thought the hunters protected you! What happened? Why the disguise?"

Her body stiffened as warmth pressed against my back. "Mr. Blackstone," she addressed Sebastian warily.

"Seraphina, you know Victoria?" Sebastian asked.

I whirled toward him. "Sebastian, this is Genevieve!" My brow furrowed. "Why did you call her Victoria?"

His gaze darted between us. "My office. Now."

Genevieve tensed like a cornered rabbit. I seized her hands. "I'm here."

Our old code words slipped between us. "You're not alone." Some tension left her shoulders.

"Trust me. Trust them," I urged.

After assessing Nathaniel's vibrating form and Sebastian's steady presence, she nodded.

Inside the office, Nathaniel practically vibrated out of his chair until Sebastian's alpha command settled him. Genevieve perched stiffly beside me.

"What happened after I left?" I asked gently.

Her hands twisted in her lap. "The hunters were monsters too. They took us to this... facility." A shudder racked her frame. "Cells filled with part-animal people. Screams everywhere. They wanted to recruit us, said these 'creatures' deserved no mercy."

Sebastian's rage pulsed through our bond.

"How did you escape?" I pressed.

"I refused their ideology." Her whisper cracked. "Couldn't stomach their cruelty."

When Nathaniel reached to comfort her, she recoiled. The hurt flashing across his face vanished behind a carefully neutral mask.

###Chapter 0242

I lock eyes with Sebastian. "He's unaware of her past, isn't he?" I send through our mind link.

His subtle head shake confirms it. Nathaniel's in for a brutal awakening if Genevieve ever accepts our world.

Her gaze shifts to me. "What about you? How did you escape?"

"I ran until I collapsed on Nightshade territory." I gesture toward Sebastian.

"Territory?" Her brows knit together as she glances nervously between Nathaniel and Sebastian.

"Remember what the vampires called me?" She nods hesitantly. "They know I'm a Guardian. A werewolf Guardian."

Her eyes dart between all three of us. "Like... that horror movie?"

"Similar, but we don't slaughter humans."

Her voice pitches higher. "We?"

Sebastian steps forward. "I'm Alpha of Nightshade Pack. Nathaniel's my Beta. And Seraphina's my mate."

"It's overwhelming," I admit, squeezing her trembling hands. "But we're nothing like those bloodsuckers."

Sebastian cuts to the chase. "You're fleeing the hunters?"

She nods frantically. "When I refused their demands, I escaped one night. Dyed my hair, wore glasses, ended up here. The secretary job saved me - I'd run out of cash."

Nathaniel's jaw tightens. "Where are you staying?"

Her cheeks flush scarlet. I cover her fidgeting hands with mine. "You're safe with us."

A hesitant glance at Sebastian before she whispers, "Alleys mostly. I wash up in office bathrooms before work."

Nathaniel's fists clench so hard his knuckles whiten. His wolf's practically vibrating with protective rage. "Sebastian?"

The Alpha leans forward, elbows on knees. "Genevieve, did you know there's a vampire bounty on you?"

Her gasp coincides with Nathaniel vaulting to his feet. "WHAT?!" He whirls toward Sebastian. "She's the other bounty target?"

Tears streak down her face. "What does that mean?"

"It means Malachi wants you back."

Her hands fly to her mouth. "I need to run. Now. I can't go back there-"

Nathaniel blocks her frantic dash for the door. "We'll protect you. Come to our pack. Right, Sebastian?"

The Alpha doesn't hesitate. "Pack law protects all mates."

"You can't!" She shakes violently.

I move beside her. "We can. It took me months to believe it too. We're preparing for their attack. But if you run alone? You're prey."

Nathaniel's voice cracks. "Please. Food, safety, your own bed. Sebastian can arrange remote work, can't you?"

I feel Sebastian's resigned sigh at my back. He'd do this for me, but knowing she's Nathaniel's mate? He'll move mountains.

"Consider it done. We're staying in town tonight - you'll get a proper room. Tomorrow we leave for Nightshade. It is Genevieve, right? Not Victoria?"

A shy smile breaks through her panic. "Genevieve."

"Good. You don't go anywhere without Nathaniel or me. Hunters might be tracking you, but we know vampires are. Understood?"

As we exit the office, Nathaniel's already dragging a chair to Genevieve's workstation when the scent hits me.

"Sebastian!" I scream as elevator doors slide open.

Malachi steps out flanked by two vampiric enforcers.

Found her just in time... or perhaps too late?

###Chapter 0243

The irony isn't lost on me. The girl we've scoured the country for has been hiding in plain sight all along. Right under my damn nose. At least we found her, even if her bond with Nathaniel complicates things. One less problem to deal with in this never-ending chaos.

My thoughts race with logistics—arranging her permanent residence, adjusting her work setup at the packhouse, and worst of all, breaking the news to Nathaniel about what that bloodsucker did to his mate. The scars run deeper than even Seraphina's.

The stench should've hit me sooner. But it's only when Seraphina shouts my name, panic lacing her voice, that I catch it. The elevator doors slide open. Three vampires stride into my office foyer like they own the place.

The leader tilts his head, nostrils flaring. "Ah. There's my little snack. Missed you, darling." His gaze locks onto Genevieve, who's trembling so violently Nathaniel snarls like a feral beast.

Seraphina steps between them, shielding Genevieve. The vampire's eyes gleam. "Well, well. Look what we have here—the Prince's favorite plaything."

My growl shakes the walls. This is a disaster. My office. The human world. Civilians everywhere. We can't afford collateral damage.

"Kill the mutts. Keep the feeders alive. I'm starving." The bastard actually strokes himself while saying it.

This time, I'm ready. One charges me while another goes for Nathaniel. Seraphina moves to intercept, but the third—Malachi—circles toward the girls. "Come to me, sweetheart. Daddy's got a treat for you."

Even over the sounds of combat, Genevieve's whimpers cut through me. Then Seraphina's voice rings out, layered with Valeria's power: "Rot in hell, Malachi. You and your pathetic leeches die today."

Pride surges through me. Terrified but fighting. That's my mate.

I finally get a grip on my vampire's throat. Dorian surges forward, claws erupting from my fingers. The vamp gurgles, thrashing as I dig deeper. One brutal twist—his head rolls free.

I whirl to find Genevieve pressed against the wall while Seraphina trades blows with Malachi. Nathaniel's pinned beneath his opponent. "Help them!" he chokes out.

Just as Malachi swings at Seraphina, she ducks and uppercuts his jaw. The stumble gives me an opening. I seize him from behind.

"Now, Seraphina! His heart!"

She drives her hand into his chest—misses. He snarls, yanking her closer. I release him to pull her away, but the bastard bolts. He crashes through the window, clutching his gaping wound as he flees.

Behind me, Nathaniel finishes his fight with a gruesome squelch. He tosses the vampire's heart onto its corpse before crouching before Genevieve. "Hey. It's over. You're safe." His voice is gentler than I've ever heard—the tone reserved for wounded creatures.

###Chapter 0244

Blood coats his entire body, yet she throws herself into his arms without hesitation, clinging to him like he's the only solid thing in her crumbling world. His whispered reassurances vibrate against her skin as I spin toward Nathaniel.

"Sebastian." He jerks his chin toward the doorway. I whirl, expecting another bloodsucker, but it's Lawrence, my human operations manager, standing frozen in the threshold.

"Lawrence."

He steps over the shattered glass, surveying the carnage with practiced calm. "Sir. We had an agreement about keeping the office space... presentable." His mouth twitches.

I return the half-smile. Lawrence owes me after I extracted his niece from a warlock's debt three winters ago. He's one of the few humans who understands our world.

"Trouble doesn't make appointments."

"Clearly." He pulls out his phone. "Should I be concerned about follow-up visits?"

"Assume they'll return. Lock down the building and initiate protocol seven."

"Already on it. My team will handle cleanup—you know the drill. Get your people out before round two starts."

I grab Nathaniel's shoulder. "You're clean? No injuries?"

"Just adrenaline shakes. We need to move—Prince Damien's enforcers won't stay gone long."

A growl rumbles through my chest as I pull him closer. "They'll die before touching you again."

We retreat upstairs to scrub off the battle stench. Seraphina surprises me by refusing to leave Genevieve's side, shadowing Nathaniel instead of coming to our suite. Maybe human mates imprint differently.

During the drive back to Nightshade territory, I have Nathaniel alert Donovan to triple patrols while I update Adrian. We agree to start joint combat drills in Black Canyon—familiarizing both packs with the kill zone where we'll funnel the vampires.

Genevieve's voice pipes up from the backseat. "So... being a werewolf means you turn into an actual wolf?"

Nathaniel's patience astonishes me. "Bigger than timberwolves. Sharper instincts. Enhanced senses—smell, hearing, night vision."

"Like my neighbor's German Shepherd?"

I tense, but Nathaniel just chuckles. "Similar, but wolves are wilder. Our wolf spirits think independently—like having a second conscience."

She processes this silently, forehead pressed against the window.

At the packhouse, I mind-link Nathaniel. "Your floor for her?"

"Only me up there. She'll take the room opposite mine—close enough if she has night terrors like Seraphina did."

"Order whatever she needs. We'll do a supply run tomorrow."

As he guides Genevieve upstairs, I add, "Meet me after she's settled. We need to talk." His subtle nod confirms receipt.

Seraphina presses against me. "You're telling him tonight?"

"It's time."

"Should I—"

"I'll handle it alone." I kiss her temple. "Go rest. This won't be quick."

My office door clicks shut behind me, sealing in the truth I can no longer outrun.

###Chapter 0245

I watch Sebastian stride away before turning toward the kitchen. My mate is drowning in responsibilities, and I only made it worse this morning by reorganizing everything. At least this is one problem I can fix.

The Omegas immediately bow their heads when I enter. A young woman steps forward nervously. "Luna Seraphina, may we assist you?"

"First, tell me your name," I request.

"I'm Penelope, Luna."

"Penelope. Call me Seraphina. Since you were thrown into this role unexpectedly today, why don't I help?"

Two hours later, we've completed a full inventory, planned meals for the coming week, and started a grocery list. We're finalizing the Omega shift rotations when I hear Sebastian's voice behind me. The comfortable atmosphere I'd created vanishes instantly.

"Alpha!" Every Omega freezes mid-task, heads bowed in submission. Clearly, Sebastian doesn't visit the kitchens often - they seem unsure how to behave around him.

"Sebastian." I move to embrace him. "What brings you here? Dinner isn't for..." I glance at Penelope.

"Thirty minutes," she supplies.

Sebastian surveys the room before answering. "I came to arrange tonight's pack meal." His gaze drops to me. "But you've already handled it."

"Everything's under control. Just need to discuss grocery payments when the Omegas go shopping. Otherwise, we're finishing the rotation schedule. Want to review it?"

He pulls me close, examining our work before smiling. "No need. You just freed up hours of my time, Seraphina."

I shrug. "You're carrying enough weight. This was something I could take off your shoulders. Penelope and I actually had fun."

Penelope offers a shy smile and nod.

Sebastian turns me to face him, cradling my cheeks. "Have I told you today how incredible you are? How fortunate I am to have found you? How deeply I love you?"

I tap my chin playfully. "Yes, no, and yes." He kisses me thoroughly, ignoring our audience. When we separate, my face burns. "I love you, my angel."

"It's you and me, Sebastian. Always."

"Always." After another glance around, he says, "Call me when dinner's ready. Thank you all for stepping up today."

He kisses my nose before leaving.

As I'm about to mind-link Sebastian, Nathaniel and Genevieve enter.

"Genevieve! Hungry? You're welcome to join us in the dining hall."

She looks overwhelmed but starts to accept when Nathaniel interrupts.

"Actually Luna, I thought Genevieve might prefer a quiet meal after today's ordeal."

"Of course. When you're ready, I'll give you a tour. Our territory is beautiful - the pack is named after stunning waterfalls. Though perhaps Nathaniel should show you. Sebastian's wolf, Dorian, carried me there initially."

She glances at Nathaniel uncertainly. "I wouldn't want to burden your wolf."

Nathaniel's fingers twitch with restraint. "My wolf Magnus is strong and eager to show you the falls. It's practical too - you'll learn our borders and stay safely within them."

###Chapter 0246

I prepare two plates of food for them, adding bottled water before sending them off. "Genevieve, if you need anything—anything at all—just ask for Nathaniel, me, or Sebastian."

As they walk away, I catch Genevieve questioning Nathaniel about why he calls me Seraphina. His explanation about pack hierarchy drifts back to me.

Sebastian enters just as they disappear from view. "Guess it's just us for dinner?" he remarks.

"Looks that way."

"Good. I'd like to eat with the pack tonight, if that's alright with you. We need to formally introduce you as our Luna and warn everyone about the vampire threat. Training with Blackthorn Pack starts at dawn tomorrow. With Nathaniel frequently unavailable, I'll have to reorganize the patrol schedules to ensure everyone gets at least one combined training session per day."

We load our plates high with food and join the others in the dining hall. After quick introductions and greetings, I turn back to Sebastian.

"What else needs to be done? How can I help? This is too much for one person to handle alone."

He pulls me close, his warmth seeping into me as he murmurs, "Thank you. Having you in my life is a blessing."

Leaning back, he takes a thoughtful bite before answering. "Actually, there is something you could do that would be a huge help. We need to stock the bunkers and safe rooms—food, medical supplies, linens, baby essentials. Everything our pack might need while waiting out the battle."

"I can assist with that, Luna," offers a young mother at our table. "Since I'll be staying in one of those rooms, I probably have a better idea of what we'll need. I'd like to help."

"Perfect. Consider it handled," I tell Sebastian, watching some of the tension ease from his face. It feels good to lighten even a fraction of the weight he carries.

After dinner, Sebastian stands and commands the room's attention. Though not all 800+ pack members are present, the majority gather here for meals.

"Listen up, everyone. Normally I'd do this more formally, but there are urgent announcements. First," he draws me to his side, "this incredible woman is my mate. You may have heard rumors, but yes, we've found each other and completed the mating marks." Cheers erupt, and he waits for them to subside.

"Seraphina's Luna ceremony will be held tomorrow night. I know it's sudden, but there's a reason." He pauses, lifting my hand to his lips. "For seven years, vampires held her captive. They've developed a taste for Guardian blood—and placed a seven-million-dollar bounty on her head. We've already faced two attacks: one in Black Canyon, another at our city offices today."

Uneasy murmurs ripple through the pack. Sebastian continues, "They're coming for your Luna, but we won't let them take her." The hall erupts in applause. He raises a hand for silence. "Blackthorn Pack fights alongside us. Our alliance strengthens with mixed patrols—their warriors learning our territory, ours learning theirs. Starting tomorrow, we train together twice daily. Revised schedules will be posted tonight. Questions?"

For thirty minutes, Sebastian fields inquiries before bidding everyone goodnight.

He sends me to bed while he finalizes preparations and waits for Nathaniel. After showering, I crawl between the sheets, sleep elusive until his familiar warmth envelops me. Exhaustion weighs heavy on us both as we drift off, tangled together.

###Chapter 0247

I braced myself for the difficult conversation with Nathaniel. No Alpha enjoys revealing such horrors about a pack member's mate. But as his leader, this duty fell to me.

When the knock came, I called him in. The scent of distress rolled off him in waves. Without a word, I poured two glasses of bourbon from my office bar.

"That bad?" Nathaniel asked, accepting the drink with trembling fingers.

I took a measured sip before speaking. "You remember how Seraphina was when she first arrived."

His knuckles whitened around the glass. "Yeah."

"Malachi didn't just feed from Genevieve during those seven years." I watched his jaw clench. "He tortured her daily."

The glass shattered in his grip. Nathaniel drove his fist through the wall with a roar that shook the windows. When he turned back, his eyes glowed wolf-gold with rage.

"I knew... I felt it in her panic when she saw him." His voice cracked. "How do I fix this, Sebastian? How do I make her feel safe?"

I gripped his shoulder. "There's no quick fix. But she's stronger than she knows - surviving this long proves that. Let her set the pace. Be whatever she needs in each moment."

He dragged a hand through his hair. "Would she see Dr. Whitmore? Maybe professional help..."

"Suggest it gently. If she resists, give her time. Maybe Evelyn could help persuade her."

Nathaniel nodded stiffly. I refilled his glass, watching him drain it in one swallow.

"I should get back. The nightmares..." His throat worked. "Magnus stayed with her last night. That helped?"

"Yes. She trusts him. Right now, his presence may comfort her more than yours would."

As he turned to leave, I added, "Whatever you both need - it's yours. She's pack now."

His eyes flashed. "She's my mate. I'll wait however long it takes for her to believe that."

After he left, I finalized the training rosters. When I finally slipped into bed, Evelyn's warmth and lavender scent pulled me into exhausted sleep.

Morning found us heading to Black Canyon for pack training. I'd heard only one scream in the night - an improvement. Perhaps Magnus' presence had helped.

Five hundred warriors gathered on the training grounds - three hundred from Nightshade, two hundred from Blackthorn. Adrian and Donovan were already drilling groups when we arrived.

I pulled Evelyn aside. "Show me what Gregory's taught you." I dropped into a defensive stance.

Her nose wrinkled. "What?"

"I need to assess your skills. Attack me."

"I'm not hitting you, Sebastian."

Standing straight, I leveled my gaze. "As your Alpha, I need to evaluate your combat readiness. Now," I reset my stance, "show me what you've got."

Her eyes narrowed. Then she moved.

###Chapter 0248

She starts what I can only call a playful warm-up. None of her strikes are meant to cause pain, none have enough force to even make me stumble. I need her to unleash her true potential. "Seraphina," I say, catching Adrian's gaze over her shoulder.

"Make her mad," he mouths silently.

"Seraphina," I repeat, taking his advice. "I thought you said your father was a lead warrior."

"He was. One of the best."

"Then why...?" I let the question hang. "Did he not train you properly?"

Her jaw tightens. "He trained me well. I just don't want to hurt you."

I nod slowly, feigning understanding. "Maybe he wasn't as skilled as you believed. If he had been, his daughter would know how to throw a proper punch. What you're doing now is barely—"

Her palm slams into my chest with enough force to send me flying backward. The impact knocks the breath from my lungs as I hit the ground hard.

"There she is," I mutter, grinning through the pain.

"My father was a legend!" she shouts, eyes blazing gold. "He could've taken Sebastian Blackstone with one hand tied behind his back!"

I push myself up, but before I can explain I was only provoking her, Adrian fans the flames. "That's more like it, Seraphina. Show him what a true Guardian's mate looks like."

She whirls back to me, chest heaving. I crook my fingers in challenge.

Holy hell, she answers.

I've seen Evelyn fight, but nothing prepared me for this. There's a stark difference between a born Guardian and a reincarnated one. Seraphina's spirit carries centuries of battle wisdom, raw instinct, and relentless fury. My mate becomes a storm of motion—fists like lightning, kicks like falling trees. I barely keep up, using every ounce of Alpha strength to block and dodge.

When I finally catch her wrist, I spin her against me, locking her in place. She nearly headbutts my nose—I jerk back just in time. As she struggles, I drop us both to the grass, pinning her in my lap. "My father was honorable," she snarls. "A warrior worthy of songs."

"I know," I murmur, holding her tighter. "Forgive me, love. I needed to see your fire. Your father raised a daughter who fights like a tempest."

Her rigid posture softens. When I hear a quiet sniff, I tilt her face up and brush my lips over hers. "You and me, Seraphina. That hasn't changed."

The warriors erupt in applause as we stand. I hadn't even noticed they'd stopped training to watch.

"Impressive," Adrian tells her. "Ready to spar with an Alpha who's used to Guardians?"

She glances at me. I shrug. "Your call."

That wicked smile returns as she curls her fingers at Adrian exactly as I'd done.

This time, I observe closely. He's fast, but she's faster. Her technique is flawless—every block, every counter executed with precision. When she finally flips him onto his back, he yields with a laugh.

"Tomorrow," I announce to the gathered fighters, "you'll train against a Guardian. Until battle comes, Seraphina will be testing your limits."

###Chapter 0249

Sebastian's comments about my father initially infuriated me. When we fought, I channeled all that rage into every strike. His ability to match me surprised me - Valeria's combat knowledge surfaced vividly during our clash.

By the time Adrian proposed sparring, my anger had dissipated. I focused entirely on analyzing his movements, exploiting openings with precision. The successful takedown pleased me more than I expected.

After Sebastian suggests daily training sessions with the warriors, inspiration strikes. "Bring Evelyn and Gregory tomorrow," I tell Adrian.

His brow furrows. "Why?"

"Three Guardians versus your warriors would make excellent practice."

"Absolutely not. Evelyn's pregnant, and Gregory..." He gestures vaguely at the wheelchair.

"First," I counter, "No one would dare lay a finger on Evelyn. Valeria knows her daughter's capabilities. Second, if you think a wheelchair diminishes Gregory's skills, you severely underestimate your father-in-law."

Donovan interjects. "She's right about Gregory. When Victor attacked with those rogues, we kept throwing them his way. He dismantled them like a seasoned warrior. Mobility limitations didn't hinder him at all." Several Blackthorn warriors nod in agreement.

Adrian exhales sharply. "Fine, they'll come. But Evelyn won't spar."

"Of course," I reply quickly, turning away before he sees my smirk. Evelyn will have her own opinions about that.

Sebastian reaches for my hand, pressing his lips to my knuckles. "Truce?"

"Truce."

His grin turns playful. "Race back as wolves?"

Valeria practically vibrates with excitement. 'Yes! Now!'

Laughing, I translate, "That's an enthusiastic yes from Valeria."

"Last one to the packhouse misses dessert," Sebastian declares mid-shift, his clothes shredding as Dorian bursts forth, already sprinting.

'Cheater!' Valeria snarls as I transform, letting her take control.

She stretches into a full run, muscles coiling with newfound power. Dorian notices her gaining ground and accelerates. Valeria moves faster than ever before - her speed astonishes even me. At the cliff base, she scales the rock face with impossible agility, reaching the summit first.

We're nearly to the packhouse when Dorian tackles us. Valeria rolls gracefully to her feet, darting for the back door despite Dorian nipping at her heels. Someone opens the door just in time - she barrels through, howling triumph as we bound upstairs.

We pause briefly to nuzzle Genevieve on the staircase before skidding to a stop outside our room.

Behind us, I hear Genevieve ask Nathaniel, "What was that about?"

"Seraphina and Sebastian racing," he explains. "Looks like Seraphina won. The white wolf was Valeria - she stopped to thank you for helping Seraphina during the coven ordeal. The tawny one was Dorian."

I shift back, heading straight for the shower. Sebastian follows close behind. "I won," I announce, pulling him in with me.

###Chapter 0250

"Seraphina." His voice is barely above a whisper as his gaze traces every curve of my body like it's the first time he's seen me. Heat rises to my cheeks, but before I can shield myself, Sebastian captures my wrists and pulls me before the full-length mirror.

"Look."

At first, I don't understand what has him so transfixed. Then I see it.

'Valeria?'

'We've restored ourselves completely. I knew we could do more. The scars remain, but they're fading.' She murmurs in my mind.

Fading? The puncture wounds now resemble clusters of dark freckles scattered across my skin. The grotesque welts that once marred my body have vanished entirely, leaving only smooth, unblemished flesh.

Tears blur my vision as I meet Sebastian's reflection.

"I didn't think perfection could be perfected, yet here you stand." His arms encircle me, lips brushing my shoulder.

I turn into his embrace and let the tears fall freely.

——

The afternoon passes in a blur of exertion. Gregory has me running an advanced obstacle course now—complete with sudden drops and projectiles designed to knock me off balance. It forces Valeria and me to think three moves ahead, our reflexes sharpening with each near-miss.

Gregory ends the session early. "Seraphina, come here."

I drop onto the bench facing him, accepting the water bottle he offers. "How are you feeling about tonight's Luna ceremony?"

The water cools my throat as I consider my answer. "Part of me is ready. Sebastian needs me, and I won't fail him. The other part..." My fingers tighten around the bottle. "What if I'm terrible at this? What if he realizes too late that he's bound himself to a liability?"

The fears pour out like floodgates breaking—all the insecurities I hadn't acknowledged until now.

My voice drops to a whisper. "What if he regrets choosing me?"

Gregory's smile holds decades of paternal wisdom. "Listen to me, child. Sebastian would burn the world before regretting you. Fate doesn't make mistakes—and neither did he."

His wheelchair creaks as he moves closer, capturing my hands. "I've watched that boy grow into the Alpha who stands before you. Twenty years of grief and duty, never knowing joy... until you."

A calloused thumb wipes away my tear. "Want to know how to become the Luna he deserves?"

"Tell me."

"After the ceremony, seek out Luna Seraphina Grey. That woman could teach stones to lead. If anyone can guide you, it's her."

"Thank you." My arms wrap around his shoulders, breathing in the familiar scent of leather and pine.

###Chapter 0251

Valeria's power never ceases to astonish me. I don't know if these abilities were always within her, but they keep revealing themselves in the most unexpected ways. My mate is extraordinary—the most remarkable woman I've ever encountered. The Moon Goddess truly favored me when she bound our souls together.

The rest of my day is spent preparing for Seraphina's Luna ceremony. My own Alpha ascension was far from joyous—more of a grim necessity than a celebration. But for her, I want nothing less than perfection. Nearly a thousand werewolves have been invited, including members of Adrian and Evelyn's pack.

This morning, I met with Penelope to ensure the kitchen could handle tonight's feast. With Nathaniel occupied assisting Genevieve, I assigned Donovan to oversee the music, dance floor, and lighting.

While Seraphina trains with Gregory, I step outside to inspect the warriors setting up the stage. Speakers and lights are being arranged behind the packhouse. I inhale deeply, savoring the crisp air and the knowledge that in just a few hours, Seraphina will officially become my Luna. The weight that lifted when she took charge of the kitchen preparations was indescribable. For years, I've shouldered every responsibility alone—I hadn't realized how heavy the burden was until she shared it.

"Alpha." Nathaniel's hand lands on my shoulder.

I turn to face my Beta. "Nathaniel. Shouldn't you be with Genevieve?"

"She's resting. Thought I'd check if you needed help."

I scan the bustling preparations. "The flowers haven't arrived."

"On it." He pulls out his phone.

While he contacts the florist, I survey the progress. Everything is falling into place seamlessly. I can't tell if the pack is this enthusiastic because we haven't celebrated in years, or if it's Seraphina's influence. I hope it's the latter. A Luna who commands respect is vital for a strong pack.

"Flowers will be here in fifteen. What else?" Nathaniel asks.

"Honestly, everything else seems handled." For the first time in memory, I feel almost unnecessary.

"Good. Do you have the ceremonial knife and chalice?"

I snap my fingers. "The safe. Let's retrieve them."

After securing the final items, I tackle other pending tasks. Nathaniel and I work side by side until Genevieve stirs upstairs. "Go," I tell him with a smirk. "She comes first." Then, recalling our earlier conversation about mates, I add, "Starting to understand what I told you?"

"The mate bond... it's surreal, isn't it?"

"Incredibly so."

"Do you think... as a human... she'll ever feel it?" His voice is hesitant.

I meet his gaze squarely. "I believe she already does. Whether it's from prolonged exposure to vampires or something unique to her, the connection is there."

"Thanks, Alpha."

Later, I realize Seraphina has returned from training. She doesn't seek me out, which I take as a positive sign—she's growing comfortable in the packhouse and among our people. Knowing she'll come to me if needed, I finalize contingency plans for the impending vampire battle.

When I finish, I head upstairs. Steam curls from the bathroom doorway, and I lean against the frame, admiring my mate. Her body has transformed since her arrival—no longer gaunt, her curves softer, muscles more defined. She still needs to gain weight, but time will take care of that.

###Chapter 0252

"Sebastian? Were you planning to join me?" My sweet Seraphina asks, her voice dripping with playful innocence.

"I'm just admiring the scenery." I reply, leaning against the bathroom doorway.

She emerges from the water, droplets cascading down her bare shoulders as she gives me that signature raised eyebrow. "What's going through that mind of yours, Alpha?"

"I've got a surprise for you when you're finished."

Stepping into our bedroom, I inhale deeply. The space now carries our mingled scents - hers like wildflowers after rain, mine like cedar and smoke.

I can barely contain my excitement about tonight's ceremony. Once we deal with these damn vampires, I'm hoping Seraphina will want to start our family immediately. We haven't discussed it formally, but we certainly haven't been taking precautions either.

When she steps out wrapped only in a towel, a low growl rumbles in my chest. "You take my breath away every single time I see you." I stride forward, pulling her damp body against mine.

"That's just the steam fogging up your vision." She teases.

"Not a chance." I press a kiss to her forehead before meeting her gaze. "But I will admit it's because I'm completely, utterly obsessed with you. You, Seraphina, are my greatest blessing. Tonight, when you officially become my Luna, my heart might actually burst with pride."

Tears glisten in her sapphire eyes, so I kiss each eyelid gently. "No tears, love. Tonight is pure celebration. This pack has waited generations for a Luna like you. We're going to make this unforgettable."

Releasing her, I move to the walk-in closet. "Since I want my Luna looking absolutely regal for her induction ceremony..." I emerge carrying a sleek garment bag. "I may have gone shopping."

Seraphina literally jumps with excitement, clapping like an eager child. "Show me! Please!"

"Absolutely. But no trying it on until Cassandra finishes your hair and makeup. Speaking of which..." I check my watch. "She should be here any minute. I took the liberty of arranging her services. Hope that's alright."

She cups my face with both hands. "Sebastian Blackstone, you continue to amaze me daily. And considering how incredible my father was, that's saying something. Now stop stalling and show me that dress!"

Her squeal could shatter glass.

I hang the bag on the door, slowly unzipping it to reveal a deep burgundy chiffon gown. The A-line silhouette features a plunging V-neck, with delicate beadwork accenting the waist. Matching silver stilettos complete the ensemble.

"It's breathtaking." She whispers, tracing the intricate beadwork with reverence.

"Glad you approve. The color matches your hair perfectly. And darling..." I run my fingers along her marked arms. "No more hiding these beautiful markings. You're a warrior. Let the pack see that."

She yanks me by my collar, crashing her lips against mine in a kiss that leaves me dizzy. "I adore it. And you."

A sharp knock interrupts us. "That'll be Cassandra." I steal one more kiss before answering.

The stylist stands there loaded down with enough products to stock a salon. "My cue to exit. See you at the altar, love." I wink at my mate as I slip out the door.

###Chapter 0253

"That man is absolutely divine!" Cassandra exclaims as she sweeps into the room. "You're one fortunate woman, my Luna."

"I know." I reply with a smile.

"And so am I." She grins, her eyes sparkling with mischief.

'Why is she looking at us like that?' Valeria questions.

'No idea, but it's making me nervous.' I respond.

"I've been itching to style your hair since you walked through our doors," Cassandra gushes. "When Alpha Sebastian called, I canceled all my afternoon appointments. You, my dear Luna, will be the most breathtaking Luna our pack has ever seen!"

Her enthusiasm grows with every word, while my anxiety spikes. What exactly does she have planned for me? Images of over-the-top makeovers flash through my mind.

To my surprise, the experience is far more enjoyable than expected. Cassandra works her magic with skilled hands, and by the time she's finished, I barely recognize myself—in the best way possible. "Incredible," I breathe, staring at my reflection.

She claps her hands together, beaming. "You love it?"

"It's perfect." My hair is gathered into an elegant high ponytail disguised beneath cascading curls, with delicate ringlets framing my face. A silver clip, matching my shoes, secures the sides.

"Now, Luna," she begins hesitantly, "I hope this isn't too forward, but word is you arrived with nothing but the clothes on your back." I nod, curious where this is leading. "And we all know our Alpha barely has time to breathe, let alone take you shopping." Another nod.

"So," she draws out the word, rummaging through her bag, "I brought you something special—undergarments designed to make our Alpha weak in the knees."

She produces a black lace set—a daring thong and a bra so delicate it might not survive the night. Sebastian will undoubtedly tear it off me within minutes.

"Thank you, Cassandra. That's incredibly thoughtful."

"Oh, it's not just from me," she says warmly. "The entire salon pitched in. We're all thrilled Alpha Sebastian finally found his mate. He's been searching for you forever, and we've already seen the change in him. He deserves happiness."

I embrace her. "I'll thank everyone personally. Now, help me into my dress—it's almost time."

I opt for just the panties, as the dress's design makes a bra impossible. Once dressed, Cassandra hugs me tightly. "So happy for you both," she whispers before stepping back to admire her work. "See you downstairs."

Alone, I steady my breathing. This is what I want—to stand beside Sebastian as his Luna. The thought calms me, and with one final deep breath, I head out.

The backyard transformation leaves me speechless. It's nothing short of magical. Nathaniel and Genevieve wait by the door.

"Luna," Nathaniel says formally. "I'll announce you to our Alpha and escort you to the stage."

"Thank you." I glance at Genevieve. "And you?"

She blushes. "Nathaniel said I could walk with you both until we reach our seats."

"Perfect." Tradition dictates only the Luna and her escort should walk through the pack, but without Genevieve, I wouldn't be here. I'm honored to have her by my side.

"Alpha is ready," Nathaniel says, offering his arm. "Are you?"

"Yes."

He extends his other arm to Genevieve, then smirks at me. "Alpha won't know what hit him when he sees you."

As if on cue, the crowd parts, and there he is—Sebastian, waiting for me on the stage. Everything else fades away. The people, the noise, the world. It's just us. As it was always meant to be.

###Chapter 0254

The path ahead was lined with pack members I hadn't met yet. Nathaniel paused to settle Genevieve into a front-row seat before guiding me toward the stage.

Sebastian took my hands the moment we reached the top. His eyes burned with devotion as he led me to a ceremonial table.

"Welcome, Nightshade Pack and honored Blackthorn guests." His voice carried across the gathering. "Tonight, we celebrate the induction of an extraordinary woman as your Luna."

I spotted Gregory, Adrian, Evelyn, Alistair, and Seraphina in the front row. Gregory winked. Evelyn gave a discreet wave.

Sebastian's fingers tightened around mine. "The Moon Goddess has blessed me beyond imagining. Fierce yet compassionate. Strong yet nurturing. She is everything this pack deserves in a Luna."

The crowd erupted. Sebastian mouthed, Ready?

My pulse thundered. Never more certain.

The ritual blade flashed. His blood dripped into the chalice. When my turn came, the sting barely registered. Our essences swirled together in the cup.

His tongue sealed my wound, gaze locked on mine. "Repeat after me, Seraphina."

The vows poured from my lips. The chalice touched them next.

Eight hundred voices exploded in my skull. Valeria surged forward, taming the cacophony with practiced ease.

Sebastian's grin told me he'd noticed. "As Alpha of Nightshade, I present your Luna—Seraphina Blackstone!"

Howls shattered the night as he crushed me against him. The kiss left me breathless.

Later, between greeting well-wishers, I caught Seraphina Grey at the buffet.

"Sweetheart!" She cradled my face, pressing kisses to my cheeks. "Alistair and I are overjoyed for you both."

"Thank you, Lu—"

"Seraphina," she corrected.

I twisted my fingers. "Gregory suggested I ask... Would you mentor me? Teach me to be the Luna they need?"

Her smile outshone the torches. "The honor would be mine."

###Chapter 0255

My Seraphina is the most breathtaking creature I've ever laid eyes on. As she emerges for her Luna ceremony, the world around me ceases to exist. Time stands still when our gazes meet across the crowded clearing. She's my entire universe - every dream I dared to have and every blessing I never thought I'd receive.

When she recites the sacred vows that bind her to me and drinks from the ceremonial chalice, I hold my breath. Taking on the mental connection of our massive pack is no small feat - 800 voices suddenly clamoring in one's mind would overwhelm most. But my perfect mate doesn't even flinch. Within moments, she's sorted through the cacophony and embraced them all.

I parade her through the gathering like a prized jewel. Every introduction fills me with such pride I might burst. Eventually, I can't resist stealing her away to the dance floor. Just one private moment with my radiant angel. The ceremony has been flawless - laughter echoing through the trees, joyous dancing under the moonlight, our pack united in celebration.

When Seraphina excuses herself, I head to the makeshift bar. Adrian appears beside me instantly. "That grin looks foreign on your usually serious face, Sebastian."

"I've never had reason to smile like this before." I clink my glass against his. "The storm clouds will gather soon enough, but tonight? Tonight the world is perfect."

Our toast is interrupted by Nathaniel and Donovan joining the conversation. This easy camaraderie - it's what I imagine having brothers feels like. For the first time since my parents' death, the Alpha's mantle doesn't feel like it's crushing me. I have people to share the burden.

I spot Seraphina deep in conversation with Luna Seraphina Grey. Whatever they're discussing makes my mate's eyes sparkle. That's all that matters.

Evelyn comes to collect Adrian, bidding us goodnight as the Blackthorn Pack retires to our guest quarters. When my Luna finally returns to my side, I can't resist pulling her close, inhaling her scent as my lips brush her hair.

"You're glowing," she murmurs, studying my face.

I whisper against her ear, "How could I not be when I have you?" My throat tightens with emotion. "You've given me everything, Seraphina."

The celebration winds down as dawn approaches. I guide my exhausted but radiant mate to our private chambers.

Inside, I carefully remove the pins from her hair, letting the silken waves cascade down her back. My fingers tremble slightly as I unzip her gown - then freeze at the unexpected sight of black lace barely covering her curves.

"Now what's this?" My voice drops an octave as I trace the delicate fabric.

Seraphina turns with a mischievous smile. "A gift from Cassandra and the salon girls."

"I'll double their bonuses tomorrow." I help her step out of the dress, then turn to find her standing before me in nothing but those sinful panties and silver heels. Moonlight catches in her curls, framing her like some celestial vision.

"Tell me what I did to deserve you," I breathe.

She closes the distance between us, arms encircling my neck. "Sebastian?"

I rest my forehead against hers. "I never imagined... never dreamed I could feel like this." The words catch in my throat.

Her kiss pours liquid warmth into my veins. When we part, her fingers thread through my hair. "I love you, Sebastian Blackstone."

"I love you, Seraphina Blackstone." The way her eyes light up at her new name undoes me completely.

I lift her effortlessly, laying her across our bed. Normally I'm not a patient lover, but tonight demands reverence. Every touch is a prayer, every kiss a devotion.

My lips trail down her body with agonizing slowness. She arches beneath me, breath coming in soft gasps. When I finally sheath myself inside her, we move together like the tide - slow, powerful, inevitable.

Tears glisten on her cheeks in the moonlight. I kiss them away as she whispers, "I love you," between shuddering breaths.

No words could contain what I feel in this moment. All I can do is show her - with every careful thrust, every lingering touch, every shared heartbeat as we crest together into bliss.

Tonight isn't about claiming or passion. It's a sacrament. A holy communion between two souls finally made whole.

###Chapter 0256

Every moment with Sebastian leaves me breathless, but last night was something else entirely. His tender lovemaking reached depths of my soul I didn't know existed. If my heart hadn't been his before, it's irrevocably his now.

The Luna ceremony meant no training this morning. Perfect timing to start preparing the bunkers. I head to the kitchen, where Beatrice waits with her friend Rosalind.

"Luna, meet Rosalind. She's expecting and will need shelter too."

"Welcome," I say. "Do you know where the bunkers are located?"

They nod just as Nathaniel and Genevieve enter.

"Luna, got a moment?" Nathaniel asks.

I promise to meet the women shortly and approach him. "What's going on?"

"Alpha hasn't assigned Genevieve duties yet. She wants to contribute." He glances at her. "Thought you might have ideas?"

I study Genevieve's determined expression. "You know you're welcome here regardless."

She shakes her head fiercely. "I need to keep busy. Dwelling on yesterday helps no one."

"How about inventory and cleaning?" I offer with a playful grin.

"Sounds perfect," she deadpans, matching my tone.

We share a laugh before joining the others. The bunker's state earns collective groans.

"These haven't been used since Luna Isolde's time," Beatrice remarks.

As we divide tasks, Beatrice studies Genevieve. "You're human."

A statement, not a question. Genevieve's eyes dart to me before answering. "Yes."

"How did you meet our Luna?" Rosalind asks.

Genevieve's voice stays steady. "We were prisoners together."

Rosalind gasps, tears welling. "May I hug you?"

The sudden embrace makes Genevieve stiffen, but she awkwardly pats Rosalind's back. Beatrice rolls her eyes. "Control your hormones, Rosie."

"Sorry," Rosalind sniffles. "But no wonder our Beta's smitten. That place..."

"Survival makes you strong," Genevieve shrugs.

An hour later, we've transformed the space. I'm cataloging pantry items when Nathaniel reappears.

"Morning, Beta!" the women chorus.

His gaze locks onto Genevieve. "Ladies. Progress?"

She flushes as he steps too close—not that she minds. Her tension visibly eases. "Hi Nathaniel."

His subtle sniff doesn't escape notice.

"What's she smell like, Beta?" Beatrice teases.

Caught red-handed, Nathaniel freezes. Genevieve looks mortified.

###Chapter 0257

"Were you sniffing me?" I recoil slightly, watching Nathaniel's face flush crimson.

He shakes his head so fast it's a blur. "No! I mean, yes, but—you don't smell bad. You smell amazing." That lovesick grin spreads across his face again.

Beatrice and Rosalind exchange knowing smirks. Clearly, tormenting their Beta is rare entertainment.

"So, what's this divine scent, Beta?" Rosalind presses, eyes gleaming.

"Strawberries," Nathaniel breathes, like it's sacred. The girls' grins turn wicked.

"Beatrice," Rosalind sing-songs. "Remember when Beta Nathaniel raided all the strawberry bowls before Alpha Alistair's summit?"

Beatrice nods vigorously. "Oh, I remember. The day we learned never to come between our Beta and his berries."

Nathaniel looks ready to combust. Poor Genevieve just blinks in confusion while I bite my lip to keep from laughing.

"I should go," Nathaniel blurts. "Just wanted to check on you, Genevieve. Liam needs me."

"Bye, Nathaniel," she says softly. He hesitates, then darts forward to kiss her forehead before fleeing.

The second the door shuts, Beatrice and Rosalind dissolve into giggles. Genevieve looks between them and me. "What?"

I lose it too. "Werewolf thing," I gasp between laughs.

Her frown deepens. I pull her into a hug. "Good or bad werewolf thing?"

"Very good," we chorus.

By noon, we're starving. Heading upstairs for lunch, I nearly collide with Seraphina Grey.

"Seraphina! I didn't expect you today."

Her gaze sweeps over my dirt-streaked clothes. "No time like the present, though you seem busy already."

"Prepping the bunkers for battle," I explain. "I was about to shower. Join me for lunch?"

"Delighted. Alistair was looking for Sebastian—"

"Right here," Sebastian's voice rumbles as he enters. "Alpha Alistair. Luna Seraphina. Thought you'd be leaving."

"We'll stay until Oberon arrives tomorrow," Alistair says. "Figured I could assist until then."

Seraphina tugs me aside. "Go clean up, dear. Let the men talk while we handle real work."

Sebastian pulls me against him before I can leave. "My busy Luna."

"Mmhm. Bunkers are halfway done. Oh, and I learned about Nathaniel's strawberry obsession."

Sebastian's brows shoot up. "Did they mention the summit incident?"

"Every detail," I whisper. "Apparently Genevieve smells like them."

His booming laugh freezes the room. Every head swivels to gape at their usually stoic Alpha clutching his sides. Alistair and Seraphina share a smirk while I giggle against Sebastian's chest.

"Can't wait to torment him about this," Sebastian wheezes.

I rise on tiptoes to kiss him. "Duty calls, Alpha. Luna business awaits."

His gaze burns into my back as I leave, following me up the stairs until I disappear around the corner.

###Chapter 0258

My heart soared as I watched my mate walk away. Alistair stepped up beside me, his presence steady as always.

"The Moon Goddess never makes mistakes, does she?"

I smirked. "I wouldn't say never, but she certainly nailed it with us."

When Seraphina disappeared from view, I turned to him. "What exactly did you have in mind for helping us, Alistair?"

We moved toward my office. "Adrian put me in charge of reinforcing our border vulnerabilities. Figured I could do the same for Nightshade while I'm here. If you can spare some warriors, we'll scout the weak points and set up defenses—barriers, traps, whatever's needed."

"That’s perfect. I’ve been meaning to address that but haven’t had the time."

"Consider it handled." He clapped my shoulder. "You’ve got allies now, Sebastian."

"I’m starting to see that. Thanks, Alistair. Want to grab lunch before you head out? We can discuss my thoughts."

As if summoned, a knock interrupted us. Isabelle and Rosalind stood at the door, balancing trays of food. "Alphas, Luna Seraphina and Luna Seraphina insisted you eat. She thought you’d want to debrief, Alpha Sebastian, so she sent us with your meals."

"Come in." I took a tray from Rosalind while Alistair accepted his from Isabelle. "Have you met Alpha Alistair?"

They shook their heads, eyeing him curiously.

"Alistair, these are Nightshade members Isabelle and Rosalind." I gestured to each. "This is Alpha Alistair, former leader of Blackthorn Pack."

"Pleasure, pups. Always good to meet allies."

"Sit," I told them, pulling up chairs. "How was your first night with Gwendolyn and her mate?"

Their faces lit up. "We got our own beds!"

"And rooms, but we wanted to stay together."

"They made all our favorite foods—pizza, tacos, burgers—because we couldn’t decide!"

They bounced between sentences like excited puppies. Clearly, Gwendolyn had already won them over.

"Isabelle, let me see your cheek." She’d been too skittish yesterday.

She approached, brushing her hair aside. The bruise had faded. "Gwendolyn said it looked worse than it was. Put some salve on it."

I examined the area. No fractures. "So, you both want to stay with her?"

"Yes, Alpha," they chorused.

"Good." Gwendolyn’s voice came from the doorway. The girls sprinted to hug her.

I joined them. "Need anything from me?"

"No, Alpha. My mate and I are set financially. But thank you." She smiled down at them. "Ready to go, girls?"

They glanced at me.

"We’re done. Remember, my door’s always open."

Nodding, they followed Gwendolyn out. "Time for a shopping trip!"

Alistair’s gaze tracked them. "What was that about?"

"Seraphina caught their guardian abusing them yesterday. Let’s just say her reaction was...memorable." A thought struck me. "Ever seen a wolf direct their aura?"

His brows shot up. "You mean focus it directionally?"

I described how she’d shielded the girls while subduing the pack. He whistled. "Never heard of that. Seraphina might’ve done it protecting Adrian and Evelyn, but I wasn’t there."

"I’ll ask Oberon tomorrow."

After lunch, I outlined my border ideas. Alistair proposed adjustments but wanted to assess the terrain first. I assigned five warriors to him, and they departed.

Come afternoon, I cleared paperwork before training. I found Seraphina and Luna Seraphina deep in discussion, a notebook between them.

"What’s this?" I kissed Seraphina’s crown, peeking at her notes. The contents made me straighten.

She fidgeted until Luna Seraphina squeezed her hand encouragingly.

"I want to be the Luna you deserve," she blurted. "So I’m learning. Luna Seraphina’s teaching me."

I pulled her up, cradling her face. "The Moon Goddess gave me perfection. Learn for yourself and the pack, not me. I’ll love you regardless."

"Told you," Luna Seraphina murmured.

"But you’re such a natural Alpha," Seraphina protested. "I don’t want to disappoint you."

I kissed her forehead. "Funny—Alistair and I were just praising the Moon Goddess’s matchmaking skills. You’ve already lightened my load immensely."

"Really?"

"Absolutely. Now enough doubts. Train with whoever you want, but never question being my mate."

"Okay."

"Good. Ready to kick some warrior ass?"

###Chapter 0259

I rushed through my shower, not wanting to keep Seraphina waiting.

I found her in the kitchen chatting with Isabelle and Rosalind. After greeting them and Gwendolyn who stood nearby, I sent them with food for Sebastian and Alistair, knowing Sebastian would want to check on them too.

Seraphina and I grabbed plates and I snatched up a notepad and pen before finding a quiet corner to eat and talk.

"From what I've observed, you already understand the Luna role, Seraphina," she said between bites. "What exactly do you need from me?"

"I want to learn how to do it properly. To become the Luna Sebastian and his pack deserve."

Her kind smile softened her features. "Darling, you already are."

I shook my head before she finished. "I'm just filling in temporarily. I don't even know what daily responsibilities I should have."

"But that's precisely what being Luna means - supporting your Alpha and the pack. An Alpha's burden is immense. A good Alpha carries that weight seriously, and Sebastian is exceptional. He's responsible for 800 lives, but who takes care of him? Who helps shoulder that load?"

As I pondered her words, she continued. "I've known Sebastian since he was a pup. Today, when you whispered in his ear, I heard him laugh properly for the first time in his life. Judging by the shocked expressions around us, I'd say the pack had never heard it either. That's your power as Luna - you make your Alpha stronger by being his foundation."

"I still need to understand the practical daily tasks."

"Naturally. Every Luna operates differently, but I'll share my methods. Evelyn runs her pack her way, and that's fine. This will give you a starting point."

For the next two hours, I filled pages with notes as Seraphina detailed her routines. The responsibilities seemed endless, and doubt crept in - was I truly capable of this?

Sebastian's arrival lifted my spirits. After their conversation, I bid Seraphina farewell and changed for training.

Sebastian and I arrived to find roughly the same number of warriors as yesterday. Adrian had brought Gregory and Evelyn, who stood at the front. Evelyn bounced on her toes, radiating competitive energy while Gregory appeared calm, though his sharp gaze betrayed his readiness.

"Ready to wipe the floor with them?" I greeted my fellow Guardians.

Adrian's clenched jaw told me Evelyn had won their argument about her participation today.

Sebastian murmured instructions to Adrian before addressing the group. "Warriors! Today we're changing tactics. Vampires move faster than most wolves can track. Form battle lines."

The warriors spaced themselves, adopting defensive stances.

"Evelyn and Seraphina, take attack positions on either side." Evelyn chose the right flank while I took the left, facing the warriors.

"Your objective: touch a Guardian." Evelyn and I exchanged competitive smirks. We both knew our speed surpassed normal werewolves.

As Sebastian explained we'd charge through their lines while they attempted to block or catch us, we crouched into attack stances.

"On my mark!" he shouted as Gregory fired the starter pistol.

We launched forward like bullets. The front line clearly expected an advantage seeing us first, but we'd already taken them down before they reacted.

A third through the lines, Evelyn's challenging smirk ignited our unspoken competition. This wasn't about the warriors anymore - it was about us. We accelerated, toppling warriors at blinding speed, each determined to outpace the other.

When the last warrior fell, we halted, bursting into laughter at our tie. The real victory was the exhilaration of the challenge.

For the remainder of training, Adrian and Sebastian paired warrior after warrior against me and Gregory. I appreciated Adrian allowing Gregory to spar - though unconventional, it forced the warriors to adapt to obstacles like his wheelchair.

The session left me energized, my earlier doubts momentarily forgotten in the thrill of combat and camaraderie.

###Chapter 0260

The training session goes smoothly with Adrian and Sebastian assisting the warriors. Evelyn and Donovan move between sparring pairs, offering corrections. By sunset, we're all exhausted but satisfied as we return to the packhouse.

After dinner with Nathaniel and Genevieve, we prepare our bags for the trip to Blackthorn territory. Sleep comes easily despite the anticipation humming through my veins.

Morning finds us sharing breakfast with Alistair and Seraphina Grey. Alistair briefs Sebastian on the new security measures along vulnerable border points. When the meal ends, we exchange farewells and hit the road. The Greys depart simultaneously, and our vehicles arrive at Blackthorn's packhouse in unison.

The moment I step inside, his scent hits me like a tidal wave. Memories flood my consciousness, making my pulse spike. I quicken my pace, drawn toward the main hall like a magnet. There he stands. "Oberon."

His head lifts, lips curving into a familiar smile. "Guardian." He reaches for my hands, but Sebastian's vicious snarl stops him cold. A protective arm yanks me backward against Sebastian's chest.

Darkness swirls around Oberon like living shadows. The air turns thick enough to choke on as his eyes blacken completely. I feel Dorian and Sebastian's wolves rising to the surface, ready for violence.

I twist in Sebastian's grip, planting myself between them. "Sebastian. I know Oberon. Stand down."

"She belongs to me."

"Ownership requires consent," Oberon counters smoothly.

I whirl to face the fae king, keeping one hand pressed against Sebastian's chest. "Sebastian is my fated mate. My choice. This isn't like with Elowen, Oberon. Control yourself."

When he doesn't retreat, I release my aura in a sharp burst. The golden energy slams into Oberon with physical force.

"Don't force my hand," I warn. "My choice won't change."

The tension leaves his shoulders the instant my power touches him. "Forgive me, Guardian. I meant no disrespect."

"What about disrespect toward me?" Sebastian growls.

"Sebastian."

Oberon's jaw tightens. "History colors my perception of Alphas and their treatment of Guardians. Too often, they're coerced into unwanted bonds."

Ignoring Sebastian's warning rumble, I step closer to Oberon and grasp his forearm. "Not this time. You have my oath as a Guardian."

"What shall I call you now?"

"Seraphina. My wolf is Valeria. It's good to see you again, old friend."

"And you. When Evelyn told me you'd been found..." His voice catches. "I've searched since Ivy's death. Thought I'd located you once, but you vanished." He finally notices the ring of bristling werewolves surrounding us.

"Evelyn mentioned you'd need the full story. While I'm here, I'd like to document your experiences. Nearly a century has passed since Valeria's line was last recorded."

"Of course. I'd enjoy catching up properly." Again I touch his arm. Again Sebastian growls. Again I ignore him. "You should know—Elowen never stopped loving you."

His throat works visibly. "Thank you. My love for her endured until her last breath."

"Can we move the hell on?" Sebastian demands.

I cup his face, waiting until his stormy eyes meet mine. "What I feel for Oberon mirrors my bond with Gregory. Guardian spirits don't reincarnate with human emotions, Sebastian. I carry Jinelle and Ivy's memories, but my heart belongs only to you."

His hands find my hips, pulling me flush against him. "Does he understand that?"

"As the Guardian's historian for over a hundred years, I'm certain he comprehends how reincarnation works. Isn't that right, Oberon?"

"Seraphina speaks truth. My affection stems from history with Elowen's line, but I know that bond died with my mate. What I feel for your mate is familial, not romantic."

Sebastian's gaze never wavers from mine. "You and me, Sebastian."

His forehead drops to mine with a sigh. "You and me, Seraphina."

###Chapter 0261

One more touch from Oberon and I swear I'll rip his hands off. If he thinks he can steal my mate from me, he's got another thing coming. Seraphina is mine, and I won't let anyone take her from me.

Valeria's calming presence soothes my rage, but I still keep Seraphina close. I trust her completely, but that Fae king? Not a chance.

"Now that we've settled that," Adrian says, "let's move to the conference room."

I pull Seraphina onto my lap the moment we're seated. She rolls her eyes but doesn't resist, melting against me with an exasperated sigh.

"Everyone, meet my son Finnian." The young Fae prince, no older than ten, gives a polite nod. "He's here to begin his training as our future historian."

I notice the kid deliberately sits beside Evelyn. Interesting. These Fae males seem drawn to our Guardians. I tighten my grip around Seraphina - no chances will be taken this weekend.

Oberon focuses on my mate. "Seraphina and Valeria, I'm curious about your whereabouts these past thirteen years. From what Evelyn shared, it wasn't a pleasant experience."

I hold Seraphina closer as she recounts her story - from first shifting to when she stumbled onto our territory.

Oberon strokes his chin thoughtfully. "Have you encountered this before?" Gregory asks him.

The Fae king's prolonged gaze at Seraphina makes my wolf snarl. Her fingers trail down my arm, instantly calming the beast within.

"There was a Guardian death under mysterious circumstances," Oberon finally says. "It happened after Elowen's time, so I wasn't officially recording history then. But since it involved Valeria's bloodline, I kept notes. The records were vague - it occurred during vampire unrest."

He turns to Finnian. "Make a note to research Gabriela's undocumented history. I believe I noted the vampire conflicts from that period."

His attention returns to Seraphina. "They called you Custos Regni?"

"Yes. Evelyn said it means Guardian of the Realm."

Oberon's expression darkens. "It does, which suggests a far greater role than just a werewolf Guardian."

After a pause, he continues. "I noticed your Guardian aura has intensified significantly. Did you attempt to use it on Prince Damien or other vampires?"

Seraphina shakes her head. "I was only sixteen when they took me. After that, Valeria grew weaker until she only appeared when I needed healing."

"Father, should I research Guardian auras?" Finnian interrupts.

Oberon studies Seraphina before turning to Gregory. "Can you project your aura?"

Gregory does, and while noticeable, it's nothing compared to Valeria's power.

"Fascinating. Evelyn?"

Her aura flares stronger than her father's, though not quite matching Seraphina's intensity.

The Fae king's thoughtful gaze lingers on my mate again. My arms constrict around her. I've never been the jealous type, but this Fae is testing my limits. Before Seraphina, everyone was replaceable. She's the exception.

"I believe your aura's strength comes from your Guardian spirit's multiple reincarnations," Oberon concludes.

Alistair voices the question we're all thinking. "Why would that matter?"

"Each rebirth strengthens the Guardian spirit," Oberon explains. "Memories and abilities accumulate. Valeria's line has reincarnated four times more than Gideon's, resulting in greater power. Have you noticed any other changes?" he asks Seraphina.

###Chapter 0262

"She can control her aura." I blurt out.

Seraphina turns to me with raised eyebrows before facing Oberon again. "It's true. I can focus my energy on specific targets while shielding others."

Oberon's jaw drops. "Demonstrate."

She gives a casual shrug. "Already did. When I pushed my power onto you earlier, I wrapped Sebastian in a protective bubble so he wouldn't be affected."

My brows furrow. "When did you use your aura on him?"

"Right before he was about to attack you. I needed to diffuse the situation." So that strange warmth I'd felt came from her. I'd mistaken it for Oberon's energy, though his always carries an edge. This felt like being wrapped in a security blanket.

I lock eyes with Oberon. "Is that why you backed off?"

He's staring at Seraphina like she's the eighth wonder. "Honestly? I'm not sure. It definitely forced my attention onto her, but whether that was from the impact or compulsion... We'll need proper testing this weekend."

"What else?" His intense gaze never leaves her face.

"I can detect lies. Evelyn and Gregory don't have this gift."

"You still possess it." His voice drops to a whisper, eyes glazing over with memory.

Confusion radiates through our bond. "Still have what?" Seraphina asks.

"Finnian, record this. I bestowed Elowen with lie detection when her Alpha was manipulating their bond. I never expected the ability to persist beyond one generation, yet your guardian essence has absorbed it permanently." A soft chuckle escapes him. "Remarkable."

Tension coils in my muscles until Seraphina's fingers begin tracing soothing patterns along my forearm. Oberon notices immediately.

"Appreciating a Guardian's worth doesn't equate to claiming her. Fae rarely receive fated mates, which makes the bond sacred. I'd never violate that."

I nod stiffly, grateful when Seraphina maintains contact.

"Any other observations?"

Adrian speaks up. "Yes. Based on last year's discussion, Guardian powers shouldn't transfer through mating bonds."

"Correct." Oberon confirms.

"Yet both Sebastian and I experienced ability enhancements and power surges after bonding."

Oberon's eyes widen. "You're manifesting Guardian traits?"

"To a lesser degree, I believe." Adrian says.

"Beyond increased strength, I've gained lie detection too." I add.

Silence stretches as he studies us all. "This requires testing during my visit. No historical records mention such phenomena. Perhaps the reincarnation frequency..."

"We think it's because our bonds were chosen, not forced." Seraphina interrupts.

Evelyn nods in agreement.

Oberon turns to Finnian. "We have much to analyze. I'll need tonight to process these revelations. Shall we reconvene tomorrow morning with test protocols?"

Everyone agrees. I desperately need privacy with my mate—my emotions are a tangled mess.

After being shown to our quarters, I pull Seraphina inside and lock the door. The world outside can wait. Right now, I just need her.

###Chapter 0263

Reliving my past was never easy. The knowledge that these words would be preserved forever made it even more daunting. Though I wasn't thrilled about Sebastian insisting I sit in his lap, I found comfort in his embrace as I spoke.

Oberon's effect on Sebastian puzzled me. He'd never shown an ounce of jealousy toward Gregory. But with Oberon, he acted as if I might walk away—as if I'd choose the Fae king over him.

When he pulled me into our private quarters, I understood his need to reaffirm our bond. No one could ever replace him—not in my heart, my soul, or my life. Those two words we whispered to each other—you and me—they meant everything.

The moment the door clicked shut, I yanked him into my arms. He buried his face against my neck, his breath warm. "Sebastian."

"I can't lose you." His voice was rough. "Maybe you don't sense it, but he does. And I won't let him take you from me."

I cupped his face, forcing him to meet my gaze. "You won't lose me. Never. Don't you feel it?"

His eyes stayed downcast. I'd never seen my mate look so raw, so exposed.

"Feel what?"

An idea struck me. If I could project my aura, maybe I could push this overwhelming love toward him. If the bond wasn't enough, I'd make him feel it.

I closed my eyes, gathering every emotion—my love, my trust, my awe for this man—and then I pushed. I wrapped it around him, cocooning him in the intensity of what he meant to me.

His sharp inhale told me it worked.

"That's what you are to me," I whispered. "No one else. No one could replace you. You pulled me from the darkest place I've ever known. You're my other half."

He crushed me against him, lifting me as he carried us to the sitting area. I kept the emotions flowing, relentless. "We've both lost too much. The people who should have loved you failed. But I won't. I'm never leaving you, Sebastian."



He leaned back, his eyes glistening. "I can't lose you."

"You won't." I pressed my forehead to his. "I'm yours. Always."

His kiss started tender but quickly turned desperate—a claiming, a reaffirmation. He carried me to the bed, stripping us both bare before burying himself inside me.

I clung to him as his growls of "mine" grew louder, fiercer. He drove me over the edge again and again until, just as another climax tore through me, he sank his teeth into my mating mark.

Stars exploded behind my eyelids. The pleasure was so intense, so consuming, that darkness swallowed me whole.

When I woke, I was sprawled across his chest. One hand tangled in my hair, the other locked around my waist. Moonlight streamed through the window.

"What time is it?" I murmured.

"Late." His thumb brushed my cheek. "You okay?"

I took stock. Sore, satisfied, happy.

"Perfect." I propped myself up. "But what about you? Are we okay?"

He kissed my nose. "Better. Sorry for knocking you out. Guess my emotions got... intense."

I smirked. "If I have to lose consciousness, that's the way to go."

His laughter rumbled beneath me.

"Good," I said, sliding off the bed. "Because I'm starving. Go handle whatever Alpha business you need to, then bring me food."

He swatted my ass—hard—leaving a stinging imprint. I shot him a mock growl over my shoulder, delighting in the way his eyes darkened.

The shower was bliss. I took my time, knowing he'd rush through his duties to get back to me.

I wasn't wrong.

——-

The next morning, we gathered for breakfast. Oberon had a full day planned—tests for Evelyn and me, some involving Gregory to determine which abilities stemmed from reincarnation and which we'd developed naturally.


###Chapter 0264

The session begins with aura manipulation. Oberon observes with keen interest, his piercing gaze analyzing every movement. He starts with me first, giving precise instructions. Adrian summons two of his warriors—one eager, the other hesitant.

"Evelyn, focus your aura around one while pushing it onto the other," Oberon directs.

I hesitate, not wanting to inflict pain. The last time I unleashed my aura, it harmed the pack. These men don’t deserve suffering. My eyes flick to Sebastian, silently pleading for guidance.

"Adrian," Sebastian says without breaking eye contact with me. "Do you have anyone in holding?"

Adrian considers for a moment. "Two. One joyrider who wrecked his parents' car, and another who used his mate as a punching bag after drinking."

"That one," Sebastian decides.

Minutes later, guards drag a disheveled man forward. Adrian steps close, voice cold. "Consider this an extension of your punishment. You’ve been selected as a test subject."

He turns to me. "Whenever you're ready—"

Valeria snarls in my mind before I even act. The man collapses, knees slamming into the dirt, neck bared in submission. The warrior beside him—Nathaniel—stares wide-eyed. "Damn."

"Impressive," Oberon murmurs. "Nathaniel, you felt nothing?"

"Just warmth," Nathaniel admits. "Like being wrapped in a comfortable blanket."

"Good. Now let’s test Seraphina."

Valeria seethes, furious at the man’s abuse of his mate bond. He whimpers as my aura presses down, his body trembling. Sebastian’s arms encircle me. "Release him, Valeria. This is training, not vengeance. His punishment is Adrian’s to deliver."

I exhale sharply, reining Valeria in. The man crumples, gasping.

Sebastian strokes my hair, murmuring, "Breathe, Evelyn." His touch soothes me until my pulse steadies.

When I turn back, Seraphina is ready. Oberon gestures. "Same exercise. Protect Nathaniel while directing your aura at him."

Seraphina’s aura flares—unfocused, uncontrolled. I feel it, and so does Sebastian, his muscles tensing. The man drops again, submitting instantly. Nathaniel fights to stay upright but eventually kneels.

"Is that your limit?" Oberon asks.

Another pulse of energy. Sebastian and Adrian grunt under the pressure. Nathaniel hits the ground. But it doesn’t affect me or Gregory.

"Strong, but imprecise," Oberon notes. "Your aura affects everyone nearby. Evelyn, now you try—just Nathaniel."

He turns to Nathaniel. "Your rank?"

"Lead warrior."

Oberon glances at Adrian. "High in the hierarchy?"

"Top one percent," Adrian confirms.

"Perfect. Evelyn, bring them both down."

"We already know she can," Adrian cuts in. "She subdued twenty of my best warriors at once."

Oberon’s eyes gleam. "How many for this test?"

"Fifty?"

"Excellent."

Adrian summons his warriors. First, Seraphina and I force all fifty to their knees. Then Oberon has me refine my control—half under my influence, half free. He varies the groups—three here, two there, one isolated. Each time, I succeed. But exhaustion creeps in, weighing me down.

Sebastian senses it before I speak. "Enough. She’s drained." He lifts me effortlessly.

Oberon nods. "We’ll break. If Evelyn needs rest, we’ll adjust this afternoon’s trials."

The session ends, but the real test has only just begun.

###Chapter 0265

I cradle my precious Seraphina in my arms as we enter the dining hall. She squirms slightly, but exhaustion wins out—she doesn't protest. My mate never ceases to amaze me. The way she wields her Guardian aura, bending it to her will, is nothing short of miraculous. Even Evelyn can't manipulate energy like this. I used to believe Evelyn was the strongest she-wolf alive, but now I know the truth—my mate surpasses them all.

Seating her on my lap, I signal for two meals. She needs to eat. Maybe food will revive her enough to join Oberon's demonstration. She should witness firsthand what Guardians are capable of.

Oberon's gaze lingers on Seraphina again. After last night's reunion, jealousy doesn't flare—just irritation. Would it kill him to stop staring?

"Auras function like muscles," Oberon remarks, eyes sliding to me. "Training will strengthen hers without draining her completely."

My mate's voice cuts in sharply. "I'm right here, you know."

Oberon blinks. "My apologies, Seraphina. I wasn't certain you were listening."

By meal's end, color returns to her cheeks. "Ready to continue?" I ask, brushing hair from her face.

She smirks. "Advanced healing, remember?"

"Watch first. Then participate."

Her response is a soft kiss that makes my pulse spike.

Outside, Oberon gestures toward me. "Sebastian, let's test your immunities. Seraphina and Valeria resist wolfsbane. Do you share that trait?"

He produces a vial. My growl rumbles through the clearing before I can stop it. "You want me to drink poison?" I invade his space, muscles coiled. He's taller, but I know my strength dwarfs his.

Seraphina materializes at my side. "Explain, Oberon."

"You're immune to wolfsbane, correct?"

She hesitates only a second. "Yes."

My head whips toward her. "Since when?"

"Wolfsbane and silver both. Resistance, if not full immunity."

Evelyn chimes in, "I inherited wolfsbane immunity from my mother."

I study both women before snatching the vial from Oberon. One quick swallow later, I brace for agony.

Nothing happens.

Nathaniel, Adrian, and Gregory gape at me. "Well?"

I grin at Seraphina. "Nothing. Absolutely nothing."

Crushing her against me, I claim her lips fiercely. "Thank you."

She laughs against my mouth. "I didn't do anything."

"You shared your gifts with me. Intentionally or not, this is your doing." My thumb traces her jaw. "You keep giving me miracles."

Mischief sparks in her eyes. "Want to test silver next?"

Hell yes, I do. Oberon produces shackles from his bag. The metal should sear my flesh, but when I grip them, only discomfort flares.

'Dorian?'

'It weakens me, but doesn't incapacitate.'

Seraphina's proud smile ignites something primal in my chest. Whatever comes next, we'll face it—together.

###Chapter 0266

My gaze sweeps across the gathered faces. "Dorian is still with me. Weakened, but present."

The shackles clatter to the ground. I sense Dorian's relief like a weight lifting from my shoulders. "And it seems I've inherited my mate's remarkable healing gift. Dorian has fully recovered."

"Your turn, Adrian."

Oberon puts Adrian through identical trials. Wolfsbane and silver affect him more than they do me. The Fae king theorizes this is because Evelyn gained her resistances genetically, whereas Seraphina's lineage received theirs directly from the Moon Goddess.

But when testing mind links, Adrian and Evelyn demonstrate extraordinary range. I recall when Victor Blackwood kidnapped Evelyn—she could reach Gregory across impossible distances. Adrian confirms they've maintained that same connection.

Next comes Gregory's evaluation. His Guardian lineage gifts—long-distance linking and brute strength—remain intact despite his wheelchair confinement.

Finished, Oberon turns to Seraphina. "More tests today? Or shall we resume tomorrow?"

"Now works."

"Attempt to link with a pack member."

Her eyes glaze over as she reaches out mentally. When they refocus, I already know the outcome. I hear the pack's collective murmur, but no distinct voice.

"Nothing."

"Evelyn, join us please."

She approaches, and Oberon instructs her to clasp Seraphina's hands while channeling her enhancing ability into the mind link. Once prepared, he has Seraphina try again.

A sharp inhale. Seraphina's eyes snap to mine. "Nathaniel. I reached Nathaniel."

Further experiments prove Evelyn can only amplify Seraphina's and Gregory's abilities, not mine or Adrian's.

We conclude as dusk falls, retreating indoors for a subdued dinner before retiring.

At dawn, Oberon requests one final test with Seraphina and Evelyn. But first, he asks me to walk with him.

We stride toward the forest's edge, putting distance between us and the packhouse.

"I owe you clarity regarding my feelings toward your mate." His voice carries the weight of centuries. "Historical tensions between werewolf alphas and Fae created the rift that Alistair and Adrian now mend. I won't let personal misunderstandings hinder this reconciliation."

I nod curtly.

"Imagine the unthinkable—losing both Seraphina and Valeria." My snarl cuts through the morning air, muscles coiling. If this is his idea of diplomacy—

He raises placating hands. "Hear me out. The explanation matters."

After a tense pause, I gesture for him to continue.

"Should they perish, their Guardian essence would reincarnate. A fragment of Valeria would live on. But the new vessel wouldn't be Seraphina. Your bond wouldn't transfer. Yet you'd still feel compelled to protect her." He meets my glare unflinchingly. "That's my connection to Seraphina and Valeria. The remnants of my bond with Elowen and her wolf Emlyn forged this protective instinct—nothing more."

Turning fully toward me, he asks, "Does this help you understand? Does it ease your discomfort?"

"It does." The admission comes grudgingly. "You're right. If I lost Seraphina and somehow survived, I'd guard her successor with my life."

"Precisely. So know this—I'd die for Seraphina, but not out of the love you bear her."

He pivots toward the packhouse. "Now, let's discover what other surprises your remarkable mate possesses."

###Chapter 0267

Sebastian and Oberon returned from their walk, and my heart swelled seeing the smile on Sebastian's face.

"Everything alright?" I asked.

He pulled me into his arms. "Perfect. Oberon has one final test for you. Let's see what other surprises my little mate has in store."

Laughing, we joined the others - Donovan, Evelyn, Adrian, Alistair, Oberon and Finnian were already gathered.

"I'd like to conduct one last experiment before Finnian and I return to Eldermere," Oberon announced. "I want to see if Seraphina can channel her ability to manipulate Evelyn's aura."

He turned to Adrian. "Could we borrow some warriors again?"

Adrian summoned several warriors, including an eager Sebastian who practically bounded over. The young warrior clearly enjoyed witnessing Guardian abilities firsthand.

Five warriors assembled this time. "Seraphina, stand behind Evelyn and place your hands on her arms."

As I moved into position, Evelyn reached back and grasped my hands instead. She gave them an encouraging squeeze before flashing me a smile over her shoulder.

"Evelyn, slowly extend your aura," Oberon instructed. "Seraphina, I want you to direct it so these two warriors," he indicated Sebastian and another, "remain unprotected while these three are shielded."

Sebastian smirked. "Show us what you've got, Luna!"

His companion elbowed him. "Quiet, Sebastian."

Focusing intently, I reached out to sense Evelyn's energy signature.

"Ready?" she asked.

"Ready."

As her aura expanded, I wrestled it under my control. Though powerful, my will proved stronger. With considerable effort, I shaped her energy to protect only the three designated warriors.

Sebastian grimaced but watched the unaffected trio. "Damn."

"Evelyn, is this your full strength?"

"Just standard output."

"Seraphina, could you maintain if she increased pressure?"

"Not certain," I gritted out, already straining.

"Evelyn, gradually intensify your aura," Oberon directed.

The moment I lost control was unmistakable - the three unprotected warriors collapsed under the sudden onslaught of energy.

When Evelyn released her aura, I sagged against Sebastian who immediately supported me, transferring his strength.

"With your impending battle, I recommend the Guardians train together," Oberon advised. "Experiment with combining your powers. Perhaps this was always the intended dynamic, but previous Alphas kept Guardians separated. Or maybe Evelyn serves as the nexus that unites your abilities. Regardless, with practice, you'll become an unstoppable force against the vampires."

After training, we shared lunch before parting ways. Oberon and Finnian departed for Eldermere while Sebastian and I returned to Nightshade.

"Do you realize how extraordinary you are, my mate?" Sebastian murmured, cradling my hand in his lap and pressing periodic kisses to my knuckles.

"Valeria's the remarkable one - I'm just the fortunate human who gets to host her," I replied.

"I disagree. The human must be worthy of the Guardian spirit just as the wolf is. By that measure, you're exceptional. And we already know Valeria is extraordinary."

The drive passed pleasantly with Sebastian's curated playlist - which I found myself enjoying more each time.

Back at the packhouse, Sebastian turned to me. "I need to check in with Nathaniel and Donovan. Will you be alright alone?"

I chuckled. "Sebastian, what kind of Luna would I be if I couldn't navigate our own pack without you?"

He kissed my forehead before heading off. I made for the kitchens, curious what Penelope had accomplished in my absence. The transformation astonished me - in just days, she'd completely reorganized everything, grouping ingredients by their intended meals.

###Chapter 0268

"Penelope, everything looks perfect here. Do you need anything from me?" I glance around the bustling kitchen.

"Seraphina, could we speak privately?"

"Of course." I lead her to a quiet corner where she voices her concerns about the young Omegas working in the packhouse. I request a detailed list of names, schedules, and their parents' information by tomorrow.

As I head toward the bunker to check on the cleaning progress, another pack member stops me. Then another. And another.

By sunset, I've held twelve impromptu meetings in hallways and empty rooms.

Sebastian finds me mid-conversation. "Everything alright, love?" His eyes flicker to the she-wolf beside me.

"I need an office," I blurt out when we're alone. "Somewhere private to handle pack concerns properly."

He guides me to the dining hall where Nathaniel, Donovan, and Genevieve are seated. Sebastian leaves to grab us food while I collapse into a chair, rubbing my temples.

"Rough day?" Genevieve pushes a glass of water toward me.

I exhale sharply. "Everyone needs something, and I'm conducting meetings in broom closets. I can't even remember half the promises I made today."

Sebastian returns with two steaming plates. He kisses my forehead. "We'll handle this together."

"But some members specifically came to me because they're uncomfortable bringing certain issues to you." I twist my napkin. "I don't want to fail them."

"I can help." Genevieve's sudden offer makes us all look up. "I was hired as Sebastian's secretary. Let me organize your schedule, track follow-ups, screen requests." She turns to Nathaniel. "Could Seraphina use your office?"

Sebastian interrupts. "There's a Luna office. It just needs clearing out."

"We'll take care of it!" Genevieve's eyes spark with excitement. "I'll recruit Isabelle and Rosalind - they adore you. And those women who helped clean the bunker, Beatrice and Cassandra. They'd jump at the chance."

From my periphery, I catch Nathaniel grinning at Sebastian. A Beta female supporting her Luna - Genevieve was unconsciously stepping into her destined role.

"Alpha," Nathaniel adds, barely containing his joy, "doesn't the Luna's office have an adjoining space for an assistant?"

"It does." Sebastian squeezes my hand. "We'll have it ready by tomorrow afternoon."

"Genevieve," I say firmly, "you must call me Seraphina. We're friends, and apparently, we'll be spending every waking moment together."

By dessert, the weight on my shoulders has lifted. Maybe, just maybe, I can do this Luna thing after all.

###Chapter 0269

I can't decide whether to feel flattered or slighted that some of my pack members prefer confiding in Seraphina over me. Honestly, I've never witnessed a pack functioning with a Luna up close—only observed Adrian and Evelyn's dynamic from a distance. Until recently, every concern had to funnel through me alone. Part of me is relieved, but another part stings realizing how many wolves might have hesitated to approach me before. Perhaps certain matters truly do belong in a Luna's domain. Though it's an adjustment, my chest swells with pride seeing how naturally our pack has embraced Seraphina's guidance.

I curse myself for overlooking the Luna's office. The tradition had faded so long ago that the necessity never crossed my mind. Nathaniel practically vibrates with excitement when Genevieve offers assistance—exactly the role she'd fulfill if she accepts their mate bond.

He's confessed they've discussed it, and she's considering. As a human, the concept of fated mates is overwhelming. We wolves don't experience the slow burn of human courtship. Our bonds ignite instantly, an irresistible pull ordained by the Moon Goddess herself. Not that every werewolf honors this sacred connection—some arrogant fools believe themselves above destiny—but who are we to question divine pairing? Judging by my own mate, the Goddess's wisdom is flawless. Seraphina completes me in ways I never imagined.

At dawn, I verify Seraphina and Genevieve's arrangements before summoning Nathaniel to my office, surrendering his space to my mate. We review war strategies, scrutinize Dorian's border reinforcements, and coordinate Guardian-warrior training regimens.

Halfway through, Nathaniel's distracted silence becomes unbearable. "Out with it," I demand when he avoids my gaze for the third time.

His fingers tighten around his pen. "Genevieve refuses the fertility examination. It changes nothing for me, but...I'd like to know if fatherhood is possible."

"Suggest she speaks with Seraphina. Perhaps have my mate accompany her to the clinic." I lean forward, recognizing the deeper wound. "Their friendship forged in captivity may provide comfort your bond hasn't yet reached."

His coffee cup cracks under sudden pressure. "She's terrified of intimacy. They took her as a virgin teenager. That monster was her only..." He swallows hard. "I'd wait eternity if she needed. Marking her would be enough—just to show the world she's mine."

I arch a brow.

"Fine, I want everything," he growls. "But I'll settle for her accepting the bond. She already feels it—sleeps soundly only when I hold her, though she claims Magnus's presence would suffice." His smile turns feral. "We both know she's lying."

###Chapter 0270

A smirk tugs at my lips as memories of Seraphina's early days flood back. "How's that working out for you?"

Nathaniel shoots me a pained look. "Absolute torture! I've never endured so many icy showers."

"I remember those days. At least Valeria recognized the mate bond once Seraphina was strong enough. Genevieve won't have that advantage."

I study him carefully. "Are you certain you're ready for this? Before you snap at me—yes, I know the mate bond is worth any sacrifice. But this could mean years of waiting. She'll be here physically, but the bond won't be complete. Magnus will struggle with restraint."

"He already does. But he understands pushing too hard could drive her away. That's why he lets me intervene when the tension becomes unbearable. Sleeping in her bed helps—it's the closest we can get for now."

"Talk to her. Maybe she'll open up to Seraphina. They're friends, and Seraphina is her Luna now."

After plowing through mountains of paperwork, we head to training. "What's the plan for Genevieve during drills?"

Nathaniel hesitates. "Actually, I wanted your permission to bring her from now on. She needs to learn weapon skills—it'll boost her confidence during attacks. Our Beta female should understand basic combat tactics."

"Bring her along," I agree before going to find my mate.

Genevieve blocks Seraphina's door. "Alpha, the Luna's in a meeting. Can it wait? She'll be done in five minutes—I scheduled everything around her training."

"I'll wait. Seems she's not the only one training today." I nod toward Nathaniel approaching behind me.

He strides past me to Genevieve. The way her eyes soften tells me everything—she feels something for him. Not the mate bond's intensity, but something real and growing. Nathaniel would move mountains for her, and he makes no effort to hide it.

"What's happening?" she asks as he pulls her close, pressing a kiss to her hair.

"I want you to feel safe when I'm not there. Sebastian agreed you could train with us—weapons only, no hand-to-hand yet."

Her face lights up. "Seriously?"

That look on Nathaniel's face—I know it well. It's the glow of a man who just made his mate's day. When Seraphina smiles at me like that, I feel invincible. Right now, Nathaniel looks like he's conquered the world.

"Dead serious. Ready to go?"

She glances down at her clothes.

"Change into something comfortable. Magnus will give you a ride." He hugs her briefly before releasing her.

"Thank you! Both of you!" She beams at us before darting off.

"No thanks needed. Every pack member should know self-defense," I call after her.

The office door opens as I turn to Nathaniel. "Alpha. Beta." Penelope, the temporary kitchen supervisor, greets us with a bright smile.

###Chapter 0271

Penelope turned to Seraphina. "Should we seek the Alpha's approval for this?"

Seraphina's gaze flicked to Sebastian. "I don't believe that's necessary." She addressed Penelope. "I've appointed you as Lead Omega for the kitchens, and I'll be hiring another Lead for packhouse maintenance."

I could see the silent plea in Seraphina's eyes. Truthfully, I was relieved to delegate these responsibilities. "Perfect. Penelope, you've clearly demonstrated your capability to manage the kitchens to your Luna. Congratulations," I said.

"Indeed, congratulations," Nathaniel added beside me.

"Thank you," Penelope murmured before excusing herself.

I met Seraphina's eyes. "Ready for combat training?"

She nodded. "But first, let's stop by the Luna's office. I want to check if it's prepared so Nathaniel can have his workspace back tomorrow."

"You're welcome to use my office as long as required, Luna," Nathaniel assured her as Genevieve joined our group.

Seraphina arched a brow at the newcomer. "Genevieve will be training with us from now on," I explained, sliding an arm around Seraphina's waist as we moved toward the stairs. "She's learning weaponry."

Seraphina glanced over her shoulder with an encouraging smile. "That's excellent! I know you'll excel at this."

We divided the warriors for training—Gregory, Evelyn, and Seraphina worked together while Donovan and I drilled the combat units. Our superior speed forced the others to adapt their fighting strategies. Donovan and Tristan circulated, offering critiques, while Nathaniel began instructing Genevieve in knife-throwing techniques.

Tristan and Sebastian, our top warriors, arrived last, energy crackling around them. Their passion for combat was matched only by their skill—the very reason Donovan and I had promoted them. We sparred with our own warriors first, then switched opponents to increase the challenge.

Post-training, we found Nathaniel had already progressed Genevieve to hitting tree-mounted targets.

"Nathaniel." I summoned him. "Let's upgrade her to a live target."

Seraphina materialized at my side instantly. "Sebastian?"

I cupped her face. "She needs to experience aiming at something that moves. If she can't throw at a person, she won't be able to defend herself or the pack."

Her eyes clouded with concern until I reminded her, "You gifted me remarkable healing abilities, remember? I'll be fine."

"Nathaniel, bring Genevieve. We'll take this gradually."

I stripped and shifted, waiting as Genevieve approached with visible trepidation.

"What's happening?" Genevieve asked, fingers twisting together.

Nathaniel steadied her. "The Alpha wants you to practice on a moving target—specifically, him."

Her head shook violently. "Absolutely not! I won't endanger someone who's shown me nothing but kindness."

Nathaniel captured her trembling hands. "Sweetheart, you won't always be throwing at stationary objects. Sebastian and Dorian were formidable even before bonding with Seraphina. Now? They're nearly invincible. Dorian's reflexes are exceptional—if you actually graze him, I'll eat my boots."

A ring of warriors formed around us—standard procedure, but undoubtedly intimidating for a novice. This simulated real combat conditions: distractions, pressure, adrenaline.

Nathaniel positioned her stance. As I feinted forward, Genevieve's knife flashed through the air.

###Chapter 0272

Genevieve leaves me speechless. In under thirty minutes, she's transformed chaos into order. My future office is spotless, Nathaniel's space is prepped for my use, and she's even set up a scheduling station outside with a color-coded calendar. I immediately authorize her to order a new computer and phones for both of us—one less thing for Sebastian to worry about. This woman is a force of nature.

Pack members stream in all day. Most simply need a trustworthy ear, but others require tangible help. Word spreads faster than wildfire about my availability—by lunchtime, Genevieve informs me the entire week is nearly booked solid.

We establish a new routine: working lunches. It's perfect for strategizing, reviewing follow-ups, and coordinating schedules.

"May I ask you something, Seraphina?"

"Always." I watch her twist her fingers nervously.

"Nathaniel explained the mate bond to me. Is it truly that... consuming?"

"Indescribably so." I take her trembling hands. "Even among werewolves, you can't comprehend it until you experience it. Your mate becomes your oxygen. Every unspoken longing, every secret dream—they fulfill parts of you that you never knew were empty."

Her gaze drops to our joined hands. "And children? What if..."

I squeeze gently. "Every couple is different, but I've seen the way Nathaniel looks at you. He'd risk never having pups if it meant keeping his fated mate."

When she finally meets my eyes again, there's steel in her whisper. "Come with me to the doctor this week? I need answers before telling him."

I pull her into a tight embrace. "Whenever you need me."

Penelope is my final appointment before combat training. I'd initially considered her for Lead Omega overseeing both kitchens and packhouse, but the scope demands specialization. When I offer her the kitchen leadership position, tears streak down her cheeks. The honor humbles her, but truthfully? Her organizational brilliance during the kitchen overhaul impressed me more. Already, pack members rave about the improved menus.

We discuss implementing structured chores for pups—educational priorities must come first. I jot down reminders: school-hour work restrictions requiring mine or Sebastian's approval, and interviewing Gwendolyn (who took in Isabelle and Rosalind) for packhouse Lead Omega. Having an assistant? Revolutionary.

Nathaniel and Sebastian intercept us post-meeting. I brace for Sebastian to override my decision about Penelope, but he simply nods approval. His trust in my judgment sends warmth through my chest.

Even better news? Genevieve starts weapons training today. Every woman should feel capable of her own defense.

At the training grounds, Gregory and Evelyn fall into formation with me. We defer to Gregory's expertise—he trained us both, and his drills are brutal perfection.

###Chapter 0273

Training to amplify each other's gifts is exhausting, but we're improving by the session. Just as we finish, I catch Sebastian talking to Nathaniel about Genevieve needing a live target. My stomach drops—he's planning to volunteer himself.

He trusts his healing ability, but the thought of him getting stabbed makes my skin crawl. I watch as Nathaniel positions Genevieve in attack stance. Then Dorian lunges.

Genevieve reacts instantly—pure reflex. The knife leaves her hand before she even processes the threat. I track its path. Too fast. He won't dodge in time.

Valeria surges forward before I can think. My body moves on its own. I intercept the blade bare-handed, catching it inches from Dorian's chest.

For one surreal moment, I just stand there, stunned it worked. Then Sebastian shifts back and yells my name like a curse.

"Seraphina!" He wrenches the knife from my grip. "We swore you wouldn't do this again." The blade clatters to the ground as he shakes me. "You promised."

"It wasn't a choice." My voice comes out steadier than I feel. "Valeria acted before I could think. She saw Dorian in danger and—"

Sebastian crushes me against him, his heartbeat wild against my ear. "We're changing tactics. I can't fight distracted, wondering if you'll throw yourself in harm's way." He pulls back just enough to lock eyes with me. "We stay side by side. That's the only way we both keep our vows. I won't lose you."

Adrian and Evelyn join us. Evelyn touches my arm. "She's right, Sebastian. It's instinct. If it were Adrian, I'd have done the same." She gestures between us and Gregory. "We Guardians need to fight close to our mates. Otherwise, we'll break formation trying to protect you."

Sebastian and Adrian exchange a loaded look. "Fine. New battle plan." Adrian tucks Evelyn against his side. "The Betas lead their squads. My father commands his own unit."

"That puts the five of us on the front lines." Adrian's grip tightens on Evelyn. "You don't leave my sight, little Guardian."

The weight of impending battle presses down like a physical force. There will be losses. People I've laughed with, trained with—people who feel like family.

I scan the clearing—my Guardian sisters, Adrian's family and pack, Nathaniel, Genevieve, Donovan, our warriors. Who won't make it home? How much blood will buy our victory? What if we lose?

If Evelyn, Gregory and I are captured... Evelyn and I might not survive our mates' deaths. But Gregory would be left alone.

And Genevieve. She's just starting to feel safe again. Could she endure another nightmare?

Sebastian's arms wrap around me as my thoughts spiral. "Breathe." His voice cuts through the panic. "I know it's brutal, but you can't let it consume you. War is ugly. Messy. But we will win." His lips brush my temple. "Those parasites won't take what's ours."

I cling to him like he's the only solid thing in a crumbling world. Because he is. When the fight comes, it'll be him and me. Together in life. Together in death.

###Chapter 0274

The following days pass in a blur as Seraphina settles into her role as Luna of our pack. Her office takes shape quickly, and she and Genevieve establish an effortless rhythm together. Watching them, you'd swear they'd been preparing for this Luna-Beta partnership their entire lives.

While the threat of war looms over us, an unexpected calm blankets the pack. I've given everything as Alpha—strength, strategy, protection. But strength alone isn't enough. A pack needs a soul, and Seraphina has become ours.

I see the fear in her eyes when she thinks I'm not looking. The unspoken terror that this war might take everything from us. The Moon Goddess wouldn't be so cruel, would she? To finally bring us together, to give me everything I've ever wanted, only to rip it away?

Warrior training progresses without issue. We've started evacuation drills for non-combatants, assigning leaders to each bunker group. Their responsibilities include headcounts and supply management—food, water, medical kits. Everything must be accounted for.

Adrian and I have scouts monitoring vampire movements. So far, nothing. Meanwhile, the Guardians grow stronger daily. Evelyn seems to be the glue holding them together. While Seraphina and Gregory are formidable, Evelyn's presence as their daughter completes the triad in a way nothing else could.

"Alpha." The mind link from my border patrol snaps me to attention.

"Report."

"A visitor at the perimeter demands to speak with you."

"Identity?"

"Claims to be Victor Blackwood."

Victor? What the hell is he doing back? I shipped him out on a bus weeks ago. "Hold him there. I'm on my way."

I reach out to Nathaniel through the link. "Meet me at the southern gate. Now."

When we arrive, Victor paces like a caged animal. He lunges toward me the moment I appear, but my warriors intercept. I wave them off.

"Victor. This is... unexpected."

"They're coming, Sebastian. The vampires." His eyes dart wildly. "I couldn't save your mother, but I won't let history repeat itself."

"Timeframe?"

"Tomorrow. Maybe forty-eight hours if you're lucky."

I nod stiffly. "You have my thanks. Need shelter?"

He shakes his head. "Found my mate north of here."

"Congratulations. Watch your back—steer clear of bloodsucker territory."

With a sharp nod, he shifts and vanishes into the trees.

I turn to Nathaniel. "Mobilize the warriors. Double patrols effective immediately."

A quick call to Adrian confirms he'll reinforce his borders as well.

Back at the packhouse, I stride straight to Seraphina's office. Genevieve stands guard outside, but one look at my face makes her step aside. I enter without knocking.

"Sebastian?" Seraphina reads my expression instantly. "What's wrong?"

Gwendolyn rises from her chair. "I should go."

The moment the door closes, I pull Seraphina against me. Her warmth steadies me.

"Victor just appeared at our border. The vampires move against us. We have one day. Two at most."

Her fingers dig into my arms. "Numbers?"

"Unknown."

I hold her tighter, memorizing the feel of her in my arms. The clock ticks louder now. War comes for us all.

###Chapter 0275

"Not yet. Our scouts haven't spotted them approaching, but according to Victor's intel, they could arrive any moment now."

I pull Seraphina closer, breathing in her scent. "Tonight, I need you to ensure the bunker and safe rooms are fully prepared. I'll announce to the pack that the vampire threat is imminent. Everyone designated for shelter must be ready to move at a moment's notice."

"Consider it done, Sebastian." Her arms tighten around me. "I love you."

"I love you too."

We work tirelessly until the early hours, collapsing into bed exhausted. Dawn barely breaks when a sharp mind link jolts me awake.

"Alpha! Urgent situation at the Blackthorn Pack border!"

"On my way. Alert Beta Nathaniel to meet me there."

I leap from bed, yanking on sweatpants I know I'll discard seconds later to shift. Seraphina sits up instantly. "What's happening?"

"Border disturbance. I have to go."

"I'm coming with you."

"Seraphina—"

"We promised, Sebastian. No separation during this fight. I'm coming."

No time to argue. I nod sharply.

Outside, we strip and shift in unison, racing toward the border. An unfamiliar scent hits my nostrils—crisp as winter's first frost, sharp as glacial ice. "Fae," Seraphina links.

We arrive simultaneously with Adrian. My breath catches.

Five hundred fae warriors stand in flawless formation, each wielding pearlescent spears taller than their seven-foot frames. Their ethereal height makes them resemble Tolkien's elves brought to life.

I shift back, positioning myself protectively before Seraphina. Though nudity doesn't bother shifters, no one looks at what's mine. She tosses me my sweats once dressed.

"I'm Alpha Sebastian of Nightshade Pack. This is Alpha Adrian. Explain your presence."

The lead warrior steps forward. "King Oberon sends his regards. To honor our alliance, he dispatches 550 warriors to aid the Guardians against the vampire horde."

Adrian's stunned expression mirrors my own.

"Your assistance is deeply appreciated," Adrian recovers first. "Though our alliance required no such demonstration."

I glance at the canyon. "We can arrange accommodations—"

"Unnecessary." The fae interrupts. "King Oberon provided supplies. We understand the battle will occur in yonder canyon?"

"Correct."

"Then we'll encamp there unless you object to our early positioning."

"None whatsoever," Adrian answers for us both.

The fae leader bows slightly. Seraphina steps forward, extending her palm skyward in a fae greeting. The warrior mirrors the gesture without making contact. "King Oberon sends his personal regards, Guardian."

She nods before turning to me. "I should return. Are we finished here?"

"We're good," Adrian and I say in unison.

After ensuring the fae have everything needed, I'm about to leave when another mind link shatters the calm.

"Alpha! They're coming! Thousands of them!"

###Chapter 0276

I sprint back to the packhouse and immediately mind-link the leaders of each safe room. "Status report. Are we fully prepared? War is upon us."

Once confirming our readiness, we begin rounding up all pack members. Those who need extra time—the elderly, the injured—are directed to their designated shelters now.

One she-wolf is in active labor. I've stationed a doctor in her safe room along with others who might need medical attention.

Just as I'm helping the last group settle in, Sebastian's urgent voice pierces my mind. "Seraphina, where are you?"

"Securing the vulnerable members," I reply.

"They're coming. Sunset. I'm returning now. Initiate lockdown procedures."

Moments later, his command echoes through the pack link—a call to arms.

I change into combat gear swiftly. Passing Valeria's room, I scent her nearby—in Nathaniel's quarters. My knock is answered instantly.

"It's time," I say. "Grab your go-bag. Now."

Her eyes widen but she moves without hesitation.

"Luna!" Nathaniel's panicked mind-link hits me.

"I have her," I assure him. "Bunker-bound."

"Did she pack her blades? She fights better armed."

I turn to Valeria. "Nathaniel's asking about your knives."

She taps her thigh where twin daggers are strapped. "Always."

At the bunker entrance, I hand her a clipboard with evacuation protocols. "Seal the doors when the last person enters. No exceptions."

"Understood. Go!"

The packhouse floods with warriors saying tearful goodbyes. Pups cling to parents; mates share desperate embraces. Near the exit, Nathaniel barrels in and sweeps Valeria into a crushing hug. Their kiss is fierce, final—a silent promise to survive.

My chest tightens. Not all of us will keep that promise tonight.

Sebastian's right—this war isn't just about me or Evelyn and Gregory anymore. Valeria's safety, every human mate's survival, hangs in the balance. As Luna, my duty is clear: stand with my Alpha, protect our pack, honor our alliance with Adrian's Blackthorn Pack. Even without treaties, Oberon's bond with Valeria would compel me to fight for them.

Nathaniel jogs over after releasing Valeria, jaw set. "Ready, Luna?"

I nod. "Move out."

As we race toward Black Canyon, I spot warriors diverging from our path. "Where—"

"Sebastian's orders," Nathaniel cuts in. "Reinforcing perimeter weak spots. No vampires reach those bunkers."

Smart. Hostages would be catastrophic.

He grabs my arm abruptly when we reach the staging area. The canyon yawns before us—our battleground under the blood moon.

###Chapter 0277

"She promised I could claim her after this battle. Genevieve...she asked me to return to her so she could accept me as her mate." I see the lump in his throat move as he swallows hard.

My fingers tighten around his forearm, forcing his gaze to meet mine. "Then you'd better listen to your mate and do exactly as she says."

A faint smile tugs at his lips before we turn to take our positions. Nathaniel leads a flanking group from the side, while I stand at the front with Sebastian, Evelyn, Adrian, and Gregory.

I break into a jog toward Sebastian. His arms open before I crash into them, my grip desperate around his waist.

"Little Seraphina," he murmurs into my hair. "Just focus on staying alive today. You survive, I survive, and we'll sort out the rest later." I press my forehead against his chest in silent agreement.

He pulls back, cradling my face between his hands. His eyes burn with intensity. "You and me, Seraphina. Promise me you'll fight beside me today—not in front of me. Promise."

Valeria, can we keep that promise?

Only if his life isn't in danger. Otherwise, we won't stand by and watch.

I hold Sebastian's gaze. "If you swear not to throw yourself into death's path, then yes. But if your life is at stake, Valeria and I won't hesitate to intervene."

"Understood." His thumb brushes my cheek. "Same goes for you. I'll trust you to handle yourself—but if I see you falter, I'm stepping in."

A soft smile curves my lips as I stare at the man who owns my soul. Never could I have imagined my life transforming so completely in such a short time. He is my everything. "You and me, Sebastian."

The battlefield hums with restless energy as we wait. Our front line is set—Evelyn stands between Gregory and me, Sebastian on my other side, Adrian beside Gregory. We are the shield. Evelyn, Gregory, and I will combine our power to decimate the first wave of vampires. We know we can't eliminate them all, but thinning their numbers will give our wolves an advantage.

Oberon's warriors flank our central line, led by Alistair. Nathaniel and Donovan command the groups poised to strike from the sides.

The stench hits me first—rotting flesh and cold malice. Evelyn and Gregory scent it the same instant I do, a heartbeat before Sebastian and Adrian.

Then they emerge.

Vampires pour from the tree line across the ravine. At their forefront stand Prince Damien and Malachi. Beside Damien, another vampire clad in royal garb surveys us with predatory amusement.

Damien inhales deeply, his lips curling. "Custos Regni." That sickening purr slithers down my spine, dragging up memories I'd rather forget. "Do you see now, Malachi?"

Malachi's fangs gleam as his eyes bleed crimson. Around us, wolves snarl, their growls vibrating the earth. Valeria's rage simmers in my mind, but I remain silent. Watching.

Vampires love theatrics. This is no different.

While the royals make a show of savoring our fear, two vampire units dart toward Oberon's warriors. I step forward, hands thrust out. My aura erupts like a solar flare. Evelyn grips my hand, her other clasping Gregory's. Their power merges with mine.

The vampires don't even have time to scream.

Where my light touches them, they crumble to ash.

Cheers erupt around me, but Damien's sneer never wavers. His eyes lock onto mine.

"I'm not the helpless girl you fed on for years, Damien." I spit his name like poison. "You'll find I'm not so easily caught this time."

His grin widens. "Then breaking you will be all the sweeter."

###Chapter 0278

My lips curl into a vicious snarl at Prince Damien's taunt directed at Seraphina. Though I couldn't distinguish which of the two smug bloodsuckers he was, the arrogance radiating from both made my hackles rise.

Now my sights lock onto him. That bastard belongs to me. For every torment he inflicted on Seraphina, I'll make sure he suffers tenfold before I end him.

Seraphina and the Guardians' power create a momentary hesitation among the vampires. But it's fleeting. Some unseen signal passes between them, and suddenly hundreds of undead creatures surge toward us. Seraphina, Evelyn, and Gregory unleash their auras, with Seraphina specifically shielding our frontline of werewolves and fae.

The second wave crashes against us before the first even finishes. The initial attackers disintegrate upon contact with the Guardian energy, turning to ash mid-stride. But the relentless assault takes its toll - cracks appear in our defenses as more vampires break through.

My vision tunnels when I spot several vamps targeting Seraphina and Evelyn. Dorian surges forward simultaneously with Theron, Adrian's massive wolf form. We become a whirlwind of fangs and claws, tearing through undead flesh. Remembering Gregory's situation, I hurl a vampire toward him, catching the satisfying crunch as he decapitates the creature mid-air. His modified wheelchair proves an unexpected advantage, creating a kill zone around him.

The vampires move with unnatural speed. Every wounded howl from my pack members feels like a physical blow. Every life extinguished leaves a gaping hole in our defenses.

Seraphina surprises me with her lethal efficiency. Every ounce of her Guardian training manifests in precise, deadly movements. She guards Evelyn's flank protectively, ensuring neither the pregnant Luna nor her unborn child come to harm. Gregory holds his ground nearby, though his mobility limitations make his position precarious.

Adrian and I gradually shift forward, creating a living barrier between our mates and the onslaught. Dorian's silver fur glistens crimson - whether from vampire blood or our own wounds, I can't tell. The injuries sting, but Seraphina's enhanced healing already knits my flesh back together.

A blur of movement at my periphery - a vampire lunges. Before I can react, Valeria materializes mid-pounce, ripping out the creature's throat with surgical precision.

Whether by design or chaos of battle, the Guardians begin separating. Adrian stays glued to Evelyn's side while I remain Seraphina's shadow.

Fighting beside my mate proves devastatingly effective. Dorian becomes a living weapon, his jaws reducing vampires to gory chunks. Seraphina and Valeria move like synchronized killers, their every strike lethal.

We reinforce Oberon's warriors, though many fae already litter the battlefield. Werewolf corpses appear with increasing frequency among the fallen.

The only consolation? The air thickens with vampire ash, proof that for every loss we suffer, they're paying tenfold.

Hours blur into endless combat when suddenly Prince Damien and his second-in-command Malachi emerge. Their royal status shows in their superior strength and tactics. Damien makes straight for Seraphina while multiple vampires keep us both occupied.

Malachi veers toward Evelyn. I have to trust Adrian will protect his mate - my focus belongs to mine. That undead bastard won't lay a finger on my woman. Dorian clamps onto a vamp's throat just as another wraps around my ribs, squeezing until bones creak. I tear out my victim's windpipe while twisting to reach the one crushing me.

###Chapter 0279

The sickening crunch of breaking ribs echoes through the air. Dorian's agonized howl pierces the chaos. Valeria whips around, her golden eyes locking onto our dire situation.

She tears through the vampire ranks with lethal precision. Just as she's about to reach me, Damien intercepts. His arms lock around her - one crushing her ribs, the other choking her throat.

That bastard smirks at me before sinking his fangs into Valeria's neck.

A feral snarl rips from her throat as her body begins shifting. I don't question it - if she's transforming, so am I. The shift back is excruciating with broken ribs, but I understand Valeria's strategy immediately. Human form gives us better mobility against these creatures.

I twist violently in the vampire's grasp. My claws slash across his face and throat. Not a killing blow, but enough to break free.

Damien's no longer feeding. Blood stains Valeria's chest, but the bite marks have already healed. The vampire prince's nose sits at an unnatural angle - clearly Valeria retaliated.

"Duck!" I mind-link the warning milliseconds before my arm swings.

Valeria drops beneath my strike. She lunges for the wounded vampire while I focus on Damien. His head snaps back from my blow. I seize the advantage, locking my hand around his throat.

"Valeria is mine," I snarl, our faces inches apart. "You'll never touch her again."

"We'll see, mongrel." He attempts a wild punch.

Fool doesn't realize mating with a Guardian gives me preternatural reflexes. I intercept his arm, wrench it behind his back, and twist us into a lethal position.

"Valeria!"

She needs this kill more than I do.

Our eyes meet. She sees Damien exposed, vulnerable. "Heart!" I command.

Just like when Malachi attacked us in my office. History repeats as I hold the monster steady for execution.

But this time, Valeria doesn't hesitate. Her fist plunges beneath Damien's ribcage with surgical precision. I feel his body convulse as her fingers close around the cold, dead muscle.

She leans in, her breath hot against his ear. "No more victims, you vile parasite."

With one brutal motion, she rips his heart free.

I let the corpse drop. Valeria crushes the organ in her fist, her expression savage. Bloodied and naked, I pull her against me. The monster who tormented her for seven years is finally dead.

The battlefield shifts instantly. Dozens of vampires collapse simultaneously - proof of the sire bond's power. Without their creator, his progeny perish. Victory surges within our grasp.

Then Valeria stiffens in my arms.

A split-second warning.

"SEBASTIAN!"

She throws herself against me, arms outstretched. Her Guardian aura erupts in a protective dome around us and our allies.

The explosion hits with concussive force.

Everything goes white.

Bodies fly through the air like ragdolls.

Damien is dead. But what unleashed this devastating blast?

###Chapter 0280

Prince Damien sends his first wave crashing toward us. Hundreds of bloodthirsty vampires surge forward. Evelyn, Gregory and I combine our powers, but the energy drain is immediate and brutal. We barely manage to eliminate the first assault before the second wave breaks through our defenses. By the third onslaught, we're forced to separate and fight individually.

We hold our formation as long as possible. I catch glimpses of Adrian and Sebastian hurling vampires toward Gregory like lethal projectiles. The man is an unstoppable force. Even confined to his modified wheelchair, he's slaughtering more vampires than most able-bodied warriors. Valeria remembers his prime - stronger than any Alpha, a living legend.

The psychic backlash of pack deaths hits me like physical blows. I've never held rank, yet each fallen warrior's final howl echoes through my soul before their life force extinguishes. The agony threatens to overwhelm me.

Then my Guardian instincts take over. Centuries of combat knowledge floods my consciousness. Valeria has battled vampires before - we know exactly where to strike. We become a whirlwind of death, dispatching monsters faster than they can regenerate.

I fight my way toward Sebastian, even as the tide separates us from Evelyn, Adrian and Gregory. I trust Adrian will protect his pregnant mate, though I understand Evelyn's need to stand with us. We're the power they fear. This is our war to win.

Sebastian is magnificent. Dorian's strength radiates through him, proving why Alphas lead. He cuts through vampires with terrifying precision, his every movement lethal.

When three vampires simultaneously attack Sebastian, Valeria reacts before I can think. She launches us forward, decapitating one creature mid-leap with a single swipe. The headless corpse disintegrates before hitting the ground.

Oberon's fae warriors fight valiantly, but many already lie motionless. My heart shatters knowing these ancient beings have met their final sunset.

A pained howl from Sebastian snaps my attention. As Valeria turns to aid him, the stench of decay assaults my senses. Prince Damien. The bastard exploits my split-second distraction, seizing us by the throat.

"There's my exquisite little Guardian," he purrs, rancid breath washing over my face. "How I've longed to taste you properly." His gaze flicks to Sebastian just before his fangs pierce my neck. White-hot agony erupts through my nervous system.

'Valeria, shift now! He can't maintain his grip on our smaller form.' We transform mid-air, ignoring Damien's startled curse. My skull connects with his nose as I regain human form, forcing him to release my bleeding neck.

"Seraphina, down!" Sebastian's warning comes just in time. I duck beneath his swinging fist as it crunches into Damien's temple. The vampire I wounded earlier still twitches at my feet. My claws extend, severing its head in one clean motion.

When I look up, Sebastian has Damien restrained. My mate offers me the killing blow, understanding my need for vengeance. This monster tormented me for years - the privilege of ending him belongs to me alone.

Unlike with Malachi, I know precisely how to destroy this creature. My fist drives upward beneath his ribcage. Valeria's claws extend internally, puncturing vital organs as we grasp his unbeating heart. Damien's expression is almost comical - the arrogant prince never imagined his prey would turn predator.

I want him to comprehend his worthlessness as I tear his heart free. This parasite brought nothing but suffering to our world. No remorse floods me as I crush the shriveled organ in my fist, watching his body disintegrate to ash.

Sebastian pulls me against his chest. His embrace anchors me, preventing my mind from spiraling into darkness. The battle's tide has turned - we're winning, though the cost is steep.

Then I see it.

Malachi has Gregory in a death grip, fangs buried in his throat. With a vicious jerk, the vampire rips out Gregory's esophagus, blood cascading down his chin. Malachi tilts his head back in ecstasy, savoring his feast.

The Guardian bond between us snaps. I feel Gregory's life extinguish just as Evelyn does. Her anguished scream precedes the shockwave of raw power erupting from her body. This uncontrolled energy surge will kill everyone nearby.

"SEBASTIAN!"

I leap into his arms, wrapping my protective aura around him. I extend the shield toward as many wolves and fae as possible before Evelyn's power bomb detonates. The concussive force slams into us like a freight train. I absorb the brunt of the impact, shielding my mate and allies until darkness consumes me.

Hundreds of miles away, in a modest apartment, another Guardian's eyes snap open.

###Chapter 0281

The explosion sent bodies flying through the air like ragdolls. My vision cleared just in time to see Seraphina's unconscious form sprawled across my chest. Then the sound hit me - a soul-shattering wail that made my ribs constrict.

I scrambled upright, cradling Seraphina against me. Around us, fae warriors and werewolves were staggering to their feet, dazed. The source of that terrible sound became clear - Evelyn. She clutched Gregory's motionless body, rocking violently as primal grief poured from her lips.

No. Not Gregory.

Adrian hauled himself up first, rushing to pull Evelyn into his arms. That sound... I knew it too well. The sound of a bond snapping. The sound of a heart being ripped in half. Whatever detonated wasn't a bomb - it was Evelyn's power erupting when she realized her father was gone.

I looked down at Seraphina. She'd sensed it coming. Disobeyed my orders to stay back. Now her back was shredded, but she still breathed. The pack hospital. Now.

The canyon looked like the aftermath of a wildfire, ash swirling thick in the air. Evelyn's outburst had vaporized the remaining vampires. Our forces were stirring, but where Seraphina's shield hadn't reached, dozens of Blackthorn wolves lay unmoving. Maybe their pack bond would spare them the worst.

Alistair reached Gregory's body. The mighty Alpha collapsed beside his oldest friend, gathering the lifeless form against his chest. Even from here, I could see his shoulders heaving.

I stood with Seraphina in my arms. Adrian met my gaze across the battlefield. The war was won, but our mates needed us. A silent understanding passed between us before I turned and ran.

"Nightshade! Fall back to territory lines!" I barked at every warrior I passed. "Med teams incoming!"

The packhouse grounds showed signs of struggle when I arrived. Good. The guards I'd left had held. I mind-linked every able wolf to triage the wounded, ignoring how that term wouldn't apply to those who'd lost their mates. Werewolves didn't survive such losses. Not really. Gregory had only lasted this long for Evelyn's sake. My father... hadn't even tried.

The hospital doors burst open under my shoulder. "I need a medic NOW!"

Dr. Whitmore materialized instantly. "This way, Alpha." He guided me to a treatment room where I laid Seraphina facedown on the table.

Machines beeped ominously as they hooked her up. Slow pulse. Shallow breathing. An oxygen mask fogged with each weak exhale. Someone thrust sweatpants at me - when had I lost my clothes? - but I refused to budge from her side.

Hours later, they'd stabilized her, bandaged the wounds, flipped her onto her back. "Why isn't she healing?" My voice sounded raw.

"Unknown at this stage," the doctor admitted. "More tests—"

Genevieve appeared, gripping my shoulder. "Sebastian. Shower. I'll watch her."

I shook my head.

"You're covered in gore and reek of death," she said bluntly. "If she wakes to that stench, it'll send her right back into shock."

###Chapter 0282

I whip my head toward her. The scent is that strong? Then I spot it—Nathaniel's mark on her neck.

"Congratulations." My voice holds no joy.

"Thanks. Now leave. You know how much she means to me. I won't abandon her."

I exhale sharply and relent.

Sprinting back to the packhouse, I plan to shower, change, and return to Seraphina immediately. As I step out, Nathaniel blocks my path.

"Alpha, I'm finalizing the casualty and injury reports." He hesitates, avoiding my gaze.

"I already know about Gregory," I say, assuming that's his concern.

He nods. "We also lost Donovan." His voice is barely audible.

I freeze. Donovan, my Gamma. He led the warriors guarding the packhouse.

"How?"

"Vampires breached the bunker. He fought them off but fell before finishing them. They broke through the door."

My stomach churns at the thought of pregnant mothers and pups slaughtered. "Casualties?"

"None. Genevieve stabbed them with firewood. Malachi attacked her, but she killed him."

"Then I suppose it's fortunate she accepted her place here as your mate."

His smile flashes, brief but radiant. "Yes. At least one good thing came from this. She agreed to be mine."

"I'm happy for you. But I need to return. Anything else? You'll handle pack affairs while Seraphina recovers. I won't leave her."

"I'll bring the full report to the hospital. She'll pull through, Sebastian. She's strong."



Two days later

"Why isn't she waking up?" I snarl at Dr. Whitmore, my patience gone. "She's a Guardian! Her healing should be accelerated. Why is she still unconscious?"

"We'll run more tests, Alpha."

"What tests? You've done everything! Why isn't she improving?" My voice rises to a shout.

Genevieve intervenes, calming me so the doctors can work.

I collapse into a chair, raking my hands through my hair. It's grown longer again, wild from my constant tugging. I need to hit something—hard—but I refuse to leave. What if she wakes while I'm gone?

I expected her to be out for hours, not days. Each passing moment tightens the knot in my chest. What if she never wakes? What if I lose her?

Carefully, I climb onto the bed, curling around her. Genevieve slips out, leaving us alone.

"You promised," I whisper. "You swore you'd never leave me, little angel. I'm holding you to that. Don't you dare break it. Come back to me."

I talk as if she can hear me. "Evelyn needs you too. She lost her father, and Adrian says she almost miscarried. She's on bedrest—possibly for the entire pregnancy. She needs your strength."

My fingers trace through her hair when the doctors return.

"Alpha, we've identified why Seraphina isn't healing properly."

I ease off the bed. "Well?"

"Valeria is diverting her strength elsewhere instead of healing our Luna." He hands me a report.

I scan it twice. "You're certain?"

"Yes, Alpha. Luna is pregnant. Valeria is protecting the pup, which slows her recovery."

Seraphina is pregnant. I'm going to be a father.

###Chapter 0283

My consciousness surfaced in a hazy dreamscape.

A dense forest surrounded me, the only sounds being rustling leaves and small creatures scurrying through the underbrush. The serene beauty felt isolating. Where was everyone?

"Sebastian? Valeria?" My voice echoed through the trees.

'I'm here.' Valeria's mental voice sounded drained.

"Where is this place?"

In my mind's eye, I saw her lift her head weakly. 'I recognize these woods.'

"Are we near Nightshade territory?"

'No.' Her answer came just as Gregory materialized between the towering pines.

"Gregory!" I sprinted to him, crashing into his embrace. "I thought we lost you!"

"Not your time yet, sweet girl. But why are you here?" His warm hands gripped my shoulders.

I scanned our surroundings again. "I don't know. I just woke up here." Dread coiled in my stomach. "Am I dead? Where's Sebastian?" My voice rose in panic.

"Can you still hear Valeria?"

"Yes."

"Then you're very much alive. Let's figure this out together."

His arm settled around me as he guided me to a cliff's edge. Below, the battlefield's aftermath stretched endlessly. "We won," I whispered.

"At great cost." His somber tone matched the devastation below.

Mates collapsed over fallen partners, their anguished cries rising like smoke from the ruins.

"This isn't where you belong. Let's check Nightshade lands."

The packhouse stood battered but intact. Warriors repaired shattered windows while others comforted grieving families. Everywhere, the air thrummed with sorrow and rebuilding.



"Not here either. The hospital next."

I clung to Gregory's presence, my form feeling insubstantial, like mist barely holding shape.

At the hospital, I spotted Genevieve and tugged Gregory's sleeve. "We should follow her."

She entered a private room. The sight inside stole my breath - my own body lay motionless on the bed, machines blinking rhythmically. Sebastian curled around me, his broken pleas shattering my heart.

"Please Seraphina...come back to me. You promised." His raw sobs sent me rushing forward.

"I'm right here!" My hands passed through him like smoke. I whirled to Gregory. "What's happening?"

He studied our entwined forms on the bed. "This is your anchor. You need to return."

'Valeria, how do we go back?'

'I'm already here. It's you who must wake.' Her voice held gentle urgency. 'Feel the pack's pain. Let it guide you home. Sebastian needs you. Our pup needs you.'

Pup?! My gaze snapped to Gregory. "I have to go back."

He nodded, turning to leave.

"Wait!" Tears blurred my vision. "Will I...?"

His smile held centuries of wisdom. "In time, little guardian. Ivy and Valeria send their love. They're proud of how you honor their legacy. Now live, Seraphina. Live fully." With those final words, he dissolved into the light.



I didn't hesitate. Laying over my physical form, I opened myself to the pack bonds - so many severed threads, others fraying as mates followed their fallen partners into death.

Agony lanced through me. My eyes flew open to Sebastian's tear-streaked face.

"Seraphina!" His lips crashed against mine, then my cheeks, my forehead, as if confirming I was real. "Don't ever scare me like that again." His entire body shook as he buried his face in my neck.

"I'm here," I whispered, cradling him as his tears soaked my hospital gown. "I keep my promises."

We clung together until his trembling subsided.

When he finally pulled back, his calloused hands framed my face. "You and me," he vowed fiercely.

"And our little miracle," I finished.

The doctors insisted on twenty-four more hours of observation despite my protests. Sebastian updated me during the endless tests - we'd lost 150 pack members, many perishing after their mates fell.

My heart ached hearing about Evelyn's close call. She needed to know her father's spirit guided me home. That might help her heal.

Discharge came the morning of the funeral pyres. As Luna, I had to be there. For three days, flames would consume our fallen as the pack paid respects.

Sebastian stood before the first fifty shrouded forms, his Alpha power radiating solemn strength. I took my place beside him as pack members stepped forward with tearful tributes. Hours passed before torches finally touched kindling.

Hand in hand, we watched ashes spiral into the starless sky, carrying our warriors' spirits home.

###Chapter 0284

The doctor's words hit me like a thunderbolt. Seraphina was pregnant. My first thought was whether she'd known before the battle and kept it from me. Relief flooded through me when I learned she'd only discovered it after that strange encounter with Gregory, who somehow brought her back to me. The hows and whys didn't matter - I owed that man everything.

Nathaniel had taken charge of the funeral arrangements while Seraphina was unconscious. We'd agreed on three days of mourning. The Nightshade Pack was drowning in grief, but every member deserved their chance to say goodbye.

I'd spoken with Adrian about his losses. After Evelyn's power surge, I wasn't sure how many of Blackthorn Pack had survived. Nearly a hundred were gone, along with their mates. Miraculously, Evelyn's blast had only knocked out their warriors, unlike the vampires who'd been obliterated.

That kind of power terrified me. It made me wonder about Seraphina's untapped potential. If losing Gregory could trigger an explosion like Evelyn's... perhaps she just needed the right catalyst. Once things settled, we'd discuss this with Oberon.

After a week of mourning, we traveled to Blackthorn Pack for Gregory's memorial. Evelyn had been hospitalized since the battle, and Alistair needed time to heal before this final farewell. Seraphina planned to speak with Evelyn - to tell her about Gregory's post-death visitation.

The entire Blackthorn Pack attended, along with many from Nightshade. Over the past month, my warriors had come to respect Gregory deeply. He'd been an exceptional Guardian, devoted father, and honorable man.

Adrian gave the eulogy, honoring Gregory's sacrifices for family and pack. Then he opened the floor for others to share memories. Elders recalled his mentorship in their youth, while younger warriors spoke of recent lessons learned.

Alistair sat between Evelyn and Seraphina Grey in the front row, head bowed. Even without seeing his face, I knew his eyes would be bloodshot. Their bond had been brotherly - not quite a mate bond, but close enough to shatter a man.

My breath caught when Seraphina rose unexpectedly. She hadn't mentioned speaking, not that she needed my permission.

"I didn't know Gregory long, at least not as the person I am now," she began, voice steady. "When I arrived here, I was broken - years of abuse had severed me from my wolf and Guardian spirit. Gregory didn't care. He took me in, pushed me to rebuild myself stronger. He helped me reclaim my wolf and Guardian powers. Treated me like family - like another daughter."

She paused, composing herself before meeting Evelyn's gaze with a soft smile. "He found me when I got lost after the battle." Evelyn's head snapped up. "I woke in an unfamiliar forest, disoriented. He appeared, told me it wasn't my time yet, and guided me back to Sebastian. True to form, he didn't leave until he was certain I was safe."

The air thickened with unspoken implications. Around us, pack members exchanged glances, some wiping tears, others clutching their mates tighter. Seraphina's words carried more than grief - they carried hope.

###Chapter 0285

Her voice cracks, and I see the moment she surrenders to the grief. Tears streak down her face like silver trails in moonlight. "Even in death, he protected me. I know he's watching over us all today, guarding this pack and family he cherished so deeply." She presses a trembling hand to her chest. "Though he's no longer with us, he'll never leave our hearts. I'm forever grateful to have known such an extraordinary man—one who became the father I never had."

As she steps down from the podium, Evelyn rises to meet her. They collapse into each other's arms, their shared sorrow for the loss of a father, a friend, their Guardian bond, pouring out in wrenching sobs.

We stay for the memorial dinner. Seraphina spends hours talking with Evelyn, recounting her time with Gregory during his final moments. The conversation visibly eases some of Evelyn's anguish, and I notice Adrian's shoulders relax slightly.

Later that evening, I pull Adrian aside near the fireplace. "How are you holding up?"

We keep our mates in view—neither of us willing to let them out of our sight for long.

"Better after today," he admits, rubbing his jaw. "Seeing her with Seraphina helped. You and your mate understand parental loss better than I do."

He sinks onto a bench, dragging his hands through his hair. "We still don't know how her power surge affected the baby. Was the near-miscarriage from her grief or her magic?" His voice drops to a raw whisper. "I can't lose them, Sebastian."

I grip his shoulder. "You won't. Our mates have proven they're stronger than we ever imagined. They're warriors. As for our children..." I shrug. "We're both flying blind. But those women?" I nod toward where they sit, heads bent together. "They're the fiercest wolves I've ever known."

Adrian huffs a laugh, watching them. "Fair warning—if I have a daughter and you have a son, keep him away from my girl."

"Likewise. And we both know I'm far more intimidating than you."

He scoffs. "Debatable."

We lapse into comfortable silence, just watching them. "Hard to believe we'll both be fathers in a few months."

"Terrifying. Amazing."

"Perfect," I agree.

That night, after showing Seraphina exactly how much I adore her—how her pleasure undoes me, how her cries of my name ignite my blood—I curl around her in bed. My lips brush her crown, breathing in her scent of wild berries and cedar, now deepened with something richer, wilder.

After talking to Adrian, I'm certain of the change in her fragrance. Evelyn carries the sweetness of vanilla. But my mate? She smells like the heart of the forest—like me. Our child will be a son.

"We never discussed if you wanted pups," I murmur. She tilts her face up, and I kiss the tip of her nose. "Bit late now, not that I'm complaining. But we probably should've talked about it."

She props herself on one elbow, her palm warm against my chest. "Sebastian Blackstone," she says, eyes gleaming, "I'd happily fill every room in this packhouse with proof of our love."

Her answer wrecks me. In one motion, I pin her beneath me and show her exactly how perfectly she's ruined me for anyone else.

###Chapter 0286

The week of mourning passed in a blur of grief and quiet determination. Our packhouse needed extensive repairs—the back section, several homes, and the underground bunker all required attention.

Sebastian flat-out refused to let me help with reconstruction work. He also banned me from warrior training sessions, citing my pregnancy. Instead, I began private training sessions with Genevieve. Werewolf pregnancies progress faster than human ones—five months instead of nine—so I only had a limited window before my growing belly would ground me completely.

During one of our medical checkups, Dr. Whitmore delivered sobering news to Genevieve. After letting Nathaniel mark her immediately following the battle, she'd hoped to conceive. But the doctor warned that human bodies weren't designed for werewolf gestation periods. Scar tissue could complicate conception, pregnancy, and delivery. Still, with strict bed rest, it might be possible.

When Genevieve shared this with Nathaniel, his initial reaction was protective hesitation. But they decided to try anyway. For Genevieve, overcoming her intimacy fears to embrace their physical relationship marked tremendous progress.

I maintained weekly calls with Evelyn. We'd both been stunned—and relieved—when news arrived that Evander's Guardian spirit had been located. The fact that it manifested as female rather than male added another layer of surprise. Though we hadn't met her yet, we hoped to soon.

Life settled into a new rhythm with Genevieve officially assuming her Beta female duties. Sebastian hired a new office assistant with her input, solidifying her role in pack leadership.

The ordinary day shattered when Sebastian's voice echoed through our mind link. "Little Seraphina. Meet me in your office immediately. We're going to the border."

He appeared within minutes, tension radiating from his frame. "What's happening?" I demanded.

"Not sure," he growled, steering me toward the stairs. Below, an entire contingent of armed warriors stood at attention. My stomach dropped.

Sebastian swept me into his arms. "They're demanding to speak with you or Evelyn. Refused to explain why to Adrian or me. Been camped outside our territory all day."

At the border, Adrian and his warriors stood ready. Beyond them, the sight froze my blood. I stiffened against Sebastian's chest.

"Easy," he murmured, arms tightening. "They won't touch you."

He set me down but positioned himself slightly ahead. "You requested the Guardian. Here she is—my mate. Now state your business."

The lead vampire—clearly royalty—lifted his chin. "Custos. Regni." The words carried none of Damien's mocking tone, only solemn respect.

I stepped forward despite Sebastian's restraining arm. "I'm the Guardian. Name's Seraphina. What do you want?"

"King Lucian," he introduced. "I understand your previous encounters with my kind have been... unfortunate."

"Those bastards are dead," Sebastian snarled.

Lucian nodded. "I regret my brethren's actions. Not all vampires live as Damien and Malachi did." He gestured to his entourage. "My coven coexists peacefully with humans. Willing blood donors eliminate any need for coercion."

###Chapter 0287

King Lucian clenched his fist and pressed it against his chest in an unusual gesture of devotion. "We come to swear our allegiance, to demonstrate our unwavering loyalty to the Guardians of the Realm. We vow to uphold the sacred covenants of the Guardians. You need never fear betrayal from my coven." As he finished speaking, he and his vampires dropped to one knee, bowing their heads in submission.

I exchanged a glance with Sebastian, both of us equally bewildered. Stepping forward cautiously, I felt his presence shift behind me, ready to shield me if this turned out to be a trap.

"Rise, King Lucian," I said, my voice steady. "Your pledge is noted. Know this—I never sought to harm your kind, but those who threaten me or mine will not survive the encounter." Valeria's power surged through me, her voice blending with mine. The vampires' heads snapped up at the shift in my tone.

"Guardian," Lucian murmured, "should you ever require our aid, we stand ready to serve."

In the blink of an eye, they vanished.

I turned to Sebastian and Adrian. "That was... unexpected. Do you think they're sincere?"

Adrian rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "They seemed genuine, but only time will tell."

Over the following months, more supernatural factions arrived at our borders, pledging loyalty to Evelyn and me as the Guardians. We summoned Oberon and Finnian to document these events and discuss their implications.

"Your power surpasses all others," Oberon remarked one evening. "The vampires named you well—Guardians of the entire supernatural realm, not just werewolves. The Moon Goddess may have created you for us, but your influence now extends beyond any single species. This is both a blessing and a burden."

Sebastian frowned. "What do you mean?"

"It means," Oberon explained, "that when conflicts arise between species, all will look to the Guardians for intervention. You will be forced to take sides. The birth of Evelyn and the revelation of your fated mates mark a turning point. Whether by design or chance, the role of the Guardians is evolving. The next generation will define what that means."

It was during one of these discussions that Evelyn went into labor.

We stayed close, knowing her pregnancy had been difficult. The delivery proved just as harrowing. Hours passed with no progress until the baby showed signs of distress. They called me in, hoping my healing abilities could help.

Unsure but determined, I placed one hand on Evelyn's stomach, sensing her daughter's weakening heartbeat, and the other on her forehead. Closing my eyes, I channeled healing energy into both of them. I had to be careful—my own pregnancy was advanced—but I managed to stabilize them, ensuring Evelyn didn’t hemorrhage and baby Ivy’s heart kept beating.

Then Finnian slipped in unnoticed.

He moved to the doctor’s side, reaching out to touch the crown of Ivy’s head as it emerged. Adrian was too focused on comforting Evelyn to notice. The doctor tried to push Finnian away, but Ivy suddenly moved down the birth canal as if drawn to him.

The doctor stepped back, allowing Finnian to guide Ivy out with gentle hands. His expression was one of awe and tenderness as he cradled her for the briefest moment before the doctor took over, cleaning her and coaxing her first cries.

When Evelyn finally held Ivy in her arms, relief washed over me. They were going to be okay.

###Chapter 0288

I grab Finnian's wrist and drag him out of the room, his gaze still locked on little Ivy. Outside, Sebastian waits for us. I turn to the fae prince. "What the hell was that?"

Finnian blinks slowly. "Her soul was calling to me. She needed guidance to enter this world, so I helped." His eyes drift back toward the delivery room door. "Never seen a newborn so radiant."

My mate and I exchange stunned looks. "Finnian?"

A soft smile plays on his lips. "Don't worry. I know she's just an infant now. I'll wait centuries if I must." With that cryptic declaration, he strides off to find Oberon, leaving us speechless.

After visiting Evelyn and baby Ivy—with Adrian beaming like the proudest father alive—we return to Nightshade territory.

Weeks pass in peaceful routine. Genevieve and I take on more responsibilities, not just managing the packhouse but assisting Sebastian and Nathaniel with business affairs. My friend's organizational skills make the workload feel effortless.

Sebastian finally promotes Tristan to Gamma, then appoints a new lead warrior to fill his previous position.

But twilight hours belong solely to us. As my belly grows rounder, Sebastian invents increasingly creative ways to satisfy my relentless pregnancy hormones. Not that he complains—my mate seems to relish my insatiable appetite for him.

Tonight, he enters as I towel off from my shower. Like clockwork, he approaches, brushes his lips against mine, then kneels to commune with our son. The ultrasound confirmed his prediction—we're having a boy. We've chosen a name but keep it secret, waiting for his arrival.

"How's my little warrior today?" Sebastian murmurs, his large hands cradling my swollen abdomen as he inhales deeply, seeking the perfect spot.

"Kicked my ribs all afternoon," I laugh.

"That's my heir." When he locates the right position, he launches into a detailed account of his day and all the adventures awaiting our child.

The adjoining nursery stands ready, complete with a connecting door so we can hear every whimper. Sebastian insisted on soundproofing the walls—for "privacy reasons."

Mid-conversation, warm liquid gushes down my thighs. Sebastian freezes, eyes darting between the puddle and my face.

"Sebastian... it's happening."

He carries me to pack medical center in record time. Three intense hours later, I cradle our perfect son. We wanted to honor both Gregory—who shielded me through childhood—and Grant, who helped me embrace my Guardian heritage.

Sebastian carries our swaddled newborn to the packed waiting area where hundreds of pack members await news of their future Alpha's birth. His proud declaration echoes through the halls:

"Meet Reginald Grant Sinclair!"

###Chapter 0289

Three months had passed.

Calling fatherhood life-changing would be an understatement. Nothing prepares you for the moment you first hold your child and feel your heart swell until it physically aches. The mate bond is sacred, a divine gift from the Moon Goddess herself. But this? Becoming a father? This is my greatest accomplishment.

My son is flawless. Ten perfect fingers, ten perfect toes. His golden curls are coming in thicker now – definitely inherited from me. But those storm-gray eyes? Pure Seraphina. She claims they're the only feature he got from her, joking that we'll soon have a mini-Sebastian running around.

I don't mind. If our next child is a girl, I hope she looks exactly like her mother. Beautiful. Though it means I'll have to terrify every male who glances her way. A tiny Seraphina would be worth the bloodshed.

Yes, I got my perfect mate pregnant again almost immediately after Julian's birth. Can you blame me? She's irresistible. When she asked me to fill the packhouse with our love, who was I to refuse my Luna?

Today, Julian and I are at my office in the human town while Seraphina rests. This pregnancy tires her more than the last. The doctor blames me for not giving her enough recovery time, but Seraphina just smirks and cites her "advanced healing."

Either way, it gives me precious time alone with my son.

My office now includes a full nursery setup. Nathaniel joins us, seizing every opportunity to hold and feed Julian. He even changes diapers without complaint. It's bittersweet – he and Genevieve have been struggling to conceive due to her past trauma.

"We're considering adoption," he says suddenly, bottle in hand. His eyes flicker to mine before returning to Julian. "War orphans... we'd planned to adopt eventually but hoped to conceive first. Given Genevieve's likely difficult pregnancy..."

Seraphina and Genevieve converted part of the packhouse for war orphans. Some lost both parents in battle; others lost one parent to battle and the other to mate-loss sickness.

"Five pups still need homes," I tell him.

"Genevieve bonded with a two-year-old girl. The child struggles with her loss. She's spent nights in our quarters – with Seraphina's approval, of course."

"You'll be amazing parents." I take the completed adoption papers he produces, signed by all parties except me. My pen glides across the page.

Standing, I reclaim my son. "Go. Tell your mate you're officially parents. Anything your daughter needs, just ask."

His grin could power the sun. "Thank you, Sebastian. This means everything."

After he dashes off, I finish work with Lawrence and my assistant, arranging to work from the packhouse next week. By departure time, we're alone.

"Lights off, then home to Mommy," I tell Julian. He might be a baby, but I swear he understands. Seraphina laughs when I say this, but the way he looks at me? Pure comprehension.

The elevator dings as we approach. Instinct kicks in – I shove Julian's carrier behind a desk and brace for combat. No one should be here this late.

The doors reveal Isolde.

Moon Goddess. The change is horrifying. Once exotic and striking, now she's skeletal, with patchy hair and death-pale skin.

"Isolde!" I catch her as she collapses.

Blood vessels have ruptured in her eyes. "Sebastian," she gasps, clutching my shirt. "They're coming. For the Guardians."

I carry her to a chair. "Who did this? Who's coming?"

Her cracked lips part. "The hunters. They know. And they're coming."

###Chapter 0290
Three Years Later

Time changes everything.

Just two days after Genevieve and Nathaniel officially adopted Sienna, Genevieve discovered she was pregnant. The timing couldn't have been more perfect - her pregnancy was high-risk from the start. She spent most of those nine months confined to bedrest.

Nathaniel would take Sienna to his office, or she'd stay with me in my newly child-proofed workspace. On particularly restless days, Nathaniel would carry Genevieve to her desk when the walls of their bedroom started closing in. Having them in the packhouse meant we could keep constant watch over her condition.

The doctors delivered grim news - natural childbirth wasn't an option due to severe internal scarring. Five months after Sienna joined our family, baby Donovan Nathaniel Roberts entered the world via C-section. They named him after our fallen Gamma, the hero who'd sacrificed himself protecting Genevieve and the others during the bunker siege.

Meanwhile, Evelyn and Adrian finally expanded their family. After everything Evelyn endured with Ivy's birth, her second pregnancy was surprisingly smooth. A year ago, they welcomed Cohen Leopold Forte. Now they're expecting their third child - another boy - any day.

Adrian confronted Finnian about his unusual interest in young Ivy. The truth emerged - they're fated mates. Finnian's been visiting regularly ever since. At first we were wary, but watching them together erased all doubts. The way he dotes on her, never losing patience despite their age gap... it's unmistakable. His father Oberon was mated to a Guardian, and Ivy already shows Guardian potential despite not yet manifesting her wolf. This time, there'll be no forced separations - Evelyn and Adrian insist Ivy must willingly accept the bond when she comes of age.

We've finally established contact with Gregory and Evander's Guardian spirit. Fiery doesn't begin to describe her. Evelyn and I bonded with her instantly. Her presence has amplified our Guardian powers beyond anything we imagined.

With great power comes greater responsibility.

Nearly a year after the hunter war began, the requests started pouring in. Oberon's prophecy proved accurate - supernaturals now seek our counsel to mediate interspecies conflicts. We formed a council requiring two of the three Guardians present, with representatives from vampire, fae, and shifter communities. Recently, sirens and dragons petitioned for seats, though they're currently classified under shifters. Even angels and demons want representation. I never realized how many supernatural factions existed until now. All petitions will be reviewed at our next assembly.

As for Sebastian and me? We've been busy. Four children in rapid succession - first Richard Gregory, then Leana Isolde (named after Sebastian's parents). Thankfully, I wasn't pregnant during the hunter war - Sebastian would've never allowed me to fight otherwise. Six months post-war came Alexander Conal, followed seven months later by Cayden Andrew.

Yes, it's been exhausting. The doctors lectured us relentlessly about spacing pregnancies. Caring for four toddlers under two? Grueling. For over a year, I nursed two simultaneously. But I wouldn't change a thing.

Today's world looks nothing like three years ago. And tomorrow? That's another story entirely.

###Chapter 0291

I wouldn't change a single thing.

Sebastian promised to fill our packhouse with pups, and he's kept that promise beautifully. Even after three and a half years, I still crave his touch as desperately as the first day we mated. He finds ways to show his love in the smallest gestures—a lingering kiss before dawn, his fingers tracing my spine when he thinks I'm asleep. And at night? Well. Let's just say we've perfected the art of silent pleasure, though he takes wicked delight in testing my limits.

Our first four came in quick succession, leaving no room for heats between pregnancies. After the fourth, Dr. Whitmore insisted we wait. Whether it was the nursing or simply my body needing respite, my cycle took months to return.

I don't think Sebastian truly believed Nathaniel's warning about the intensity of a Guardian's post-pregnancy heat. By day three, he was muttering prayers to the Moon Goddess for mercy. Thank the stars for Genevieve and Nathaniel—they kept our pups fed, stocked our fridge with electrolyte drinks, and turned away all visitors for seven straight days.

When it finally broke, we stood under the shower spray, washing away a week's worth of sweat and musk. Sebastian glanced down at himself with a wince. "Little mate, I think you've ruined me for other women."

I pressed against him, laughing against his collarbone until I felt evidence to the contrary. "Seems functional to me."

"Never thought I'd say this," he groaned, "but please tell me you're done."

"Absolutely fried," I admitted, wincing as I shifted my weight. "I'll be walking funny for days."

We collapsed onto fresh sheets and slept around the clock, making up for lost time.

Now, two weeks later, I've arranged candles throughout our bedroom, their flickering light painting the walls gold. Normally Sebastian's keen nose detects my pregnancies before I do—only with our daughter did I know first. This time, I want to savor his reaction.

Genevieve has the pups for the evening, giving us this perfect moment alone.

The door creaks open. "What's all this, my love?" Sebastian's voice wraps around me like velvet as he nuzzles my mating mark, sending electric sparks dancing across my skin.

I melt into his embrace, still marveling at how his touch sets me ablaze after all this time. "I have news."

"Mmm." His hands slide under my thighs, lifting me effortlessly. "Let me guess—you've arranged a night of debauchery with your irresistible mate?"

"Partly." I gasp as his teeth graze my earlobe while he carries me toward the bed.

He lays me down with reverence, trailing kisses down my throat. "Explain the other part."

"The kids are with Genevieve because..." I arch into him as his mouth finds my breast, my fingers twisting in his hair. "Sebastian, look at me."

When his storm-gray eyes meet mine, I see eternity reflected there. "We're having twins."

Dorian surges forward in his gaze before Sebastian drops to his knees, pressing his ear to my stomach with a laugh that shakes his entire frame. "Should've known you'd outdo yourself, little Guardian."

###Chapter 0292

I never thought I'd find my mate. Certainly not in some backwater town tucked deep in the Sierra Madre Mountains, a place I was just passing through. The biggest shock wasn't just that she was human—it was that she was barely eighteen, half my age.

The bus ticket had been a parting gift from an old enemy who wasn't quite a friend anymore. The envelope of cash he'd shoved into my hands was buried in my backpack beneath the new clothes he'd bought me, tags still dangling.

When the bus stopped for a two-hour break, I stepped off to find food. The town had one diner, a shabby little place with peeling paint. The moment I walked in, her scent hit me—cherry blossoms, sweet and floral with an edge of something wild.

She came to take my order, and something about her felt... off. The faintest trace of forest clung to her, but none of the heavy musk all werewolves carry.

Magnus, does she have a wolf? I asked my wolf.

In my mind, he tilted his head, ears pricked forward. No. But...

But what?

There's power there. Not a wolf, but something else. Maybe wolfless? I can't tell.

"Afternoon," she said, flashing a practiced smile that didn't reach her eyes. "What can I get you to drink?"

"Just water. Thanks."

She was gone before I could say more. The most stunning woman I'd ever seen—caramel skin, dark chocolate eyes, short black hair that framed her face like a portrait. Every werewolf claims their mate is beautiful, but she was something else entirely.

The bell over the door chimed. She looked up, grabbing extra menus before returning with my water.

"Hey, Theo," she greeted the newcomer, her smile suddenly warm and genuine.

Magnus snarled inside me. Ours.

Easy. She doesn't know us yet. No wolf means no instinctual pull. We'll have to stay, win her over.

But it was the conversation after she walked away that set my nerves on edge. The humans were whispering about "animal attacks" in the area. I knew better. Those were vampire kills. And if the pattern held, they were moving south—toward the packs that had just cut me loose. Toward Sebastian, the son of the woman I'd failed to protect years ago.

I owed her. Even if I owed them nothing.

I left without ordering, sprinting for the nearest trees and shifting. Magnus ran full tilt, eating up the miles. I had to warn Sebastian. For Isolde, I had to make sure her son survived.

After delivering the warning, the pull to return to her was unbearable. Like a hook in my ribs, yanking me back.

I found the town's only motel and booked a room. Needed to learn everything about my little mate—her birthday, her family, why she smelled like a werewolf but had no wolf of her own.

Once my things were stashed, I went back to the diner. Through the window, I saw her behind the counter, working the night shift. I took a seat, breathing in that sweet, wild scent.

Then she stepped out from the kitchen—and froze.

Her nostrils flared. Her spine straightened.

When her eyes locked onto mine, they weren't just brown anymore. Gold blazed through them, the unmistakable glow of a Guardian.

"Mate," she whispered.

###Chapter 0293
The Tenth Winter

"Look at my radiant princess," my father's voice boomed as I descended the grand staircase of our packhouse on the morning of my tenth birthday.

"Morning, Papa." I beamed, skipping the last few steps. "I'm perfect. Today's the day I meet my wolf!"

For a decade, I'd been the center of my father's universe. He paraded me through every gathering, introducing me as the future Alpha of Blackthorn Pack with unmistakable pride. I threw my arms around his waist, inhaling his familiar cedar scent as he pressed a kiss to my crown.

"Happy birthday, my heart." My mother appeared, cupping my face to leave a strawberry-scented kiss on my cheek. "Any tingles yet? Any whispers?"

"Nothing." My brows knitted together. "Should there be?"

"Patience, Isolde." My father's chuckle rumbled through me as he tilted my chin up. "The Moon Goddess works on her own schedule."

The entire packhouse buzzed with preparations for tonight's celebration. I secretly hoped my wolf would emerge before the festivities - how magnificent would it be to make my grand entrance in wolf form? As the Alpha's sole heir and a natural-born leader, the pack would erupt in cheers.

Every pack member I encountered showered me with birthday wishes and hopeful inquiries about my wolf. Their admiration wasn't just obligatory respect - I'd earned their loyalty through years of leadership training and genuine care for our people.

As twilight painted the sky, anxiety clawed at my throat. "Mama," I whispered while she braided my hair, "what if she never comes?"

Her fingers stilled. "Darling, your wolf isn't some tardy guest. She'll arrive precisely when she's meant to." The emerald gown she'd helped me into whispered against the floorboards as we descended to the ballroom.

My mother moved like royalty beside me, every inch the perfect Luna. She carried the weight of our pack's wellbeing with effortless grace, her compassion as legendary as my father's strength in battle.

The crowd parted as we approached the dais. I caught the fleeting disappointment in my father's eyes before he masked it with a proud smile, pressing a crystal flute of cherry soda into my hand. "To our future Alpha," his toast rang out, "may your reign be as glorious as your spirit."

Days bled into weeks with no sign of my wolf. Each morning began with the same question from my father, each evening ended with my same ashamed denial. The warmth in his gaze cooled to frost, as if I were deliberately withholding his heir.

"Mama," I sobbed into her lap one night, her fingers carding through my hair, "why won't she come? Did I offend the Moon Goddess?"

"Shhh, my brave girl." Her voice trembled slightly. "This isn't punishment. Some wolves simply take longer to wake."

The seasons changed. So did my father. His accusations now included my mother. "This is your failing," he snarled one evening, shattering a vase against the wall. "Weak blood producing weaker offspring. I should have chosen a true Alpha female."

My eleventh birthday dawned with his customary question. "No, Father," I whispered, watching his lip curl like he'd tasted something foul.

"No celebration tonight," he declared. "Nothing worthy of celebration exists."

The violence came weeks later.

I woke to crashing sounds, sprinting toward my parents' chamber expecting intruders. The scene froze my blood - my father had Mama pinned against the wall, his hand around her throat, her cheek already purpling.

"OUT!" he roared when he noticed me.

My limbs locked in terror.

He turned back to Mama, his free hand tearing at her nightgown. "Unless you want her to watch while I plant a proper heir in you, make her leave."

"Go to bed, darling," Mama mouthed, her eyes screaming apologies. I fled, shutting the door on my father's growls.

Dawn revealed only Father emerging from their room. After my usual denial, he spat something about "useless females" before storming off.

I found Mama limping toward the bathroom, her body a canvas of bruises and blood. "You shouldn't see this," she rasped.

"He's gone." I steadied her trembling frame. "Let me help."

While she soaked in the tub, I stripped the bloodied sheets, replacing them before the omegas could witness our shame. Returning to the bathroom, I sank beside the tub.

"This is my fault."

Her wet hand grasped mine. "Never," she said fiercely. "Your worth isn't tied to your wolf. You are my greatest joy, Isolde."

The next year became a nightmare of daily interrogations - "Wolf?" for me, "Pregnant?" for Mama - until my twelfth birthday changed everything.

###Chapter 0294

The morning of my twelfth birthday fills me with terror.

Father's temper has been worsening these past two years. If I don't shift today, his rage will explode. The entire pack suffers under his growing cruelty. Everyone tiptoes around him now.

No one visits the packhouse anymore. I'm grateful—no one should witness what he does to Mother. The abuse has escalated dangerously this past year. I fear he'll kill her one day.

My bedroom door crashes open. I jolt upright as Father looms in the doorway.

"Well?" he demands.

I shake my head.

His face twists in disgust. "Worthless girl. You're no daughter of mine."

His hand rises to strike me.

Mother materializes between us like a shield.

The backhand cracks across her cheek. Blood and saliva spray as her head snaps sideways. She steadies herself, still blocking me from him.

"Move," he snarls.

She stands firm.

After a charged silence, he turns his glare to me. "Get out."

I blink in confusion.

"Out. Of. My. Packhouse!" he spits. "If I ever see you on my lands again, I'll kill you myself."

The door slams behind him.

"Mom? What does he mean?"

She remains silent for a full minute. "Pack a bag. Only essentials—what you can carry. Bring anything irreplaceable. I'll return in five minutes."

True to her word, Mother reappears with her own packed bag. I've stuffed my favorite clothes and some photos into an overnight duffel.

"Quickly now," she whispers, grasping my hand.

We move like shadows down the staircase, pausing at every creak. Instead of the main entrance, she guides me through a service hallway—the omega's exit.

Outside, we sprint for the tree line. Mother suddenly yanks me behind an oak as border patrols pass. We're nearly to the territory edge when Father's Gamma intercepts us.

"Where are you going, Paige?" Jack blocks our path.

Mother shoves me behind her. "She's banished, Jack. I won't let her go alone. Will you stop me?"

His gaze flicks between us. Then he pulls cash from his pocket. "Take this. Get far away—bus, rental car, whatever. He won't let you leave easily. I'll buy you time."

"Thank you," Mother murmurs, embracing him briefly. He whispers something in her ear before we're running again.

A mile from the border, howls erupt behind us.

Mother thrusts her bag at me. "Climb on."

She shifts mid-stride. I scramble onto her wolf's back as she launches forward. Though not born an Alpha female, a decade as Luna has honed her strength. Today, desperation fuels her speed.

She takes rivers when possible, masking our scent. Ten miles later, we reach the outskirts of a human town. Mother shifts back, and I toss her clothes.

The bus station appears like a miracle. With fifteen minutes to departure, Mother buys two tickets. We slouch in rear seats, only breathing when the wheels start turning.

We don't sit up until the city disappears behind us.

###Chapter 0295

The first bus station is just the beginning. My mother yanks us off before our scheduled stop, purchasing tickets to a completely different town. We repeat this pattern three more times, zigzagging across state lines like fugitives.

By the time we reach her chosen destination, it's well past midnight two days later. Exhaustion weighs me down as we stumble into the only motel this tiny Sierra Madre town has to offer. I collapse onto the scratchy sheets and am unconscious before my head hits the pillow. Somewhere in my fading thoughts, I realize this escape from my father is my twelfth birthday gift. The best one I've ever received. For now, we're safe.

Mom declares this remote mountain town our new home. "We're in neutral territory here," she explains between yawns as we unpack. "Several packs roam these mountains, but they keep to themselves."

The next morning, she enrolls me in the local school and lands a job at Teddy's Diner, the only eatery for miles. We rent a cramped studio apartment above a hardware store—what humans call a "granny flat." It's not much, but for the first time in my life, I don't wake up to my mother nursing fresh bruises.

Nearly a year passes in this fragile peace. My routine never varies: school, then the diner's ice cream counter where I do homework until Mom finishes her double shift. She works herself ragged, hoarding every penny in case we need to run again.

Then everything shatters on an ordinary Tuesday afternoon.

A bloodcurdling scream cuts through the diner's chatter. My mother collapses, her tray clattering to the floor as she curls into a fetal position. The pain contorting her face sends ice through my veins.

Teddy, the owner and cook, comes barreling out of the kitchen. "What in blazes—?"

I'm already crouched beside her. "She just dropped!" My voice shakes.

"Ambulance," Teddy barks, reaching for the phone.

"No!" Mom gasps. Her trembling hand grips my wrist. "Isolde... water... I'll be fine." Each word seems to cost her tremendous effort.

"You need a hospital," I insist.

Teddy studies my mother's face, some silent understanding passing between them. "Get your mama some water, kid."

Whatever she whispers to him while I'm gone must have been convincing. When I return, Teddy's helping her sit up against the counter. She gulps the water like it's medicine.

"I'm okay," she lies, her pallor ghostly. "Teddy, I just need—"

"Go home," he interrupts, taking the empty glass. "I'll call Janine to cover. Girl, take your mother straight to bed."

Teddy presses a takeout box into my hands as we leave. "You call me if she takes a turn tonight, hear?"

Back in our apartment, Mom won't stay quiet. "Sit," she orders, patting the mattress. Her fingers are like ice against mine. "You need to understand what happened today."

I perch on the edge of the bed, dread coiling in my stomach.

"Sweetheart, do you know why I collapsed?" Tears shimmer in her eyes when I shake my head. She exhales shakily. "The important thing is... I believe we're finally safe from your father. He's stopped searching."

Her gaze drops to our intertwined hands. "But he's taken another mate." Her voice cracks. "Do you understand what that means?"

I don't—not until she explains the agony of a broken mate bond. How every time my father betrays their union, she'll feel it like a blade twisting in her gut. The pain will worsen with each indiscretion, draining her strength until...

"But what happens to you?" My voice is barely a whisper.

Mom won't meet my eyes. "Eventually, Aurora will surrender. And we'll fade away."

###Chapter 0296

That painful conversation with my mother occurred five years ago. My father's betrayal slowly drained the life from her over three agonizing years. In the end, I'm certain he took another mate. Mom had been fading, but on that final day, her scream of agony still haunts my nightmares.

It was my sixteenth birthday. Mom had cleared her schedule to celebrate with me. So many of my birthdays had been tainted by my father's cruelty, but this one became the most devastating.

The morning had been perfect. We'd visited a secluded creek, hiking through sun-dappled woods. Mom hadn't been able to shift for years - her wolf had grown too frail - but we cherished every moment together.

The horror struck during dinner, right when pack celebrations would normally begin. Mom froze mid-bite, her face twisting in sudden anguish. Then came that terrible scream as she clutched her mating mark. I rushed to hold her, accustomed to these episodes by now. But this time... this time it killed her.

She died in my trembling arms, abandoning me to face the world alone at sixteen.

Without Theodore's kindness, I don't know where I'd be. Probably lost in the human foster system. But I'd already started covering Mom's shifts at the diner. She'd told Theodore she had cancer - impossible for werewolves with our healing abilities, but he never knew her true nature.

So when Mom got "sick," he let me work her shifts. After her death, he protected me - keeping me employed, ensuring I finished school. He retired from cooking months ago but still checks on me daily.

I'm always wary when bus travelers stop by. Many assume a lone waitress is easy prey for a quick fling. Theodore keeps me safe, but I stay alert around these transient customers.

Days before my eighteenth birthday, a massive man entered - built like the warriors from my old pack. Not just tall (though at 5'11" I'm no petite flower myself), but broad and powerfully muscled. His intense stare unsettled me before he vanished without ordering. The encounter left me wondering if he was werekind, but bus people are unpredictable.

On my eighteenth birthday, I wake with no intention of celebration. My birthdays mark only tragedies: failing to manifest my wolf, my banishment, Mom's death. The sole bright spot? Human law now recognizes me as an adult - no one can force me out.

All plans vanish when I hear her voice in the shower.

Oh Isolde, you've endured so much waiting for me. Forgive my long absence.

"Who's there?" I demand, yanking back the curtain to an empty bathroom.

It's me, your wolf. My name is Aurora.

"I don't have a wolf. I'm too old," I argue aloud.

I've always been part of you, but couldn't awaken until now.

Why the wait? I think, testing if this is real.

Our destined Guardian spirit lived beyond his time. The Moon Goddess honored another's plea to spare him. I waited until we received our proper Guardian bond.

You're truly my wolf?

Always, Isolde. You'll never be alone again.

Tears streak my face as decades of loneliness crash over me.

Aurora. At last.

At last indeed, my Isolde.

At work, I tell Theodore I need the evening off. When pressed, I admit it's my birthday - one I'd planned to ignore, but now must honor. He produces a cupcake with a wink, shooing me out the door.

###Chapter 0297

The moon hung high as I ventured into the woods bordering our sleepy town. When Aurora assured me we were alone, I shed my clothes and surrendered to the first shift. Agony tore through me. Most wolves experience their first transformation at ten, when their bodies are still malleable. Mine came at eighteen—alone, without family or a mate to guide me through the torment.

Hours passed in a blur of snapping bones and reforming muscle. When it finally ended, I collapsed onto the damp earth, gasping. Aurora surged forward, lifting our unfamiliar four-legged form with cautious steps. Every movement felt alien, uncoordinated.

The world exploded with new sensations. Distant rustles became crisp sounds. The river’s scent—where Mom and I had picnicked two birthdays ago—flooded my nose. Tiny creatures scuttling through underbrush, the earthy musk of their dens, even the whisper of leaves above us—all vibrantly clear. My vision pierced the darkness like never before.

Aurora bolted. I relinquished control, exhilarated by her joy as she raced through the trees. Her playful bark echoed in my mind, infectious. We ran until a potent scent halted us—pack territory. "We must avoid their borders," Aurora warned.

We pivoted, only to encounter another pack’s markers miles later. Another detour. By the time we reached the river, Aurora slowed, padding to the water’s edge. Our reflection shimmered: a wolf with midnight-black fur streaked with russet and caramel, a pattern I’d never seen on any other.

"You’re stunning, Aurora."

Dawn approached as we returned. Exhausted, I managed a few hours of sleep before my shift at the diner.

A week had passed since Aurora’s arrival, and our new routine settled in. Days at work, nights running wild. Yet questions gnawed at me. As a Guardian, Aurora insisted we had a purpose—but whether she didn’t know or refused to say, I couldn’t tell.

My heightened senses revealed secrets: the line cook’s lingering glances since his first day, how Theodore spun tales of Mom appointing him my protector to ward off trouble. Humans smelled bland compared to werewolves, whose scent carried the richness of deep forests.



Tonight, we traced pack boundaries, Aurora drinking in the familiar aromas. I sensed her longing for pack life, but neither of us would return to my father’s cruelty. So when the diner’s bell chimed near closing, the sudden rush of pine and damp earth startled me. A werewolf. The first since my change.

Nervousness spiked. Did I smell like a rogue? Banished wolves lost their packs at ten—my exile came differently.

Aurora stirred urgently. "I need to see him."

Steeling myself, I stepped from the kitchen.

The aroma hit like a tidal wave—sandalwood, cedar, and something primal that made my mouth water. My gaze swept the room, locking onto him: the man from over a week ago, watching me with equal intensity.

Aurora’s voice was a whisper in my mind. "Mate."

His lips curved into a dazzling smile as he echoed, "Mate."

###Chapter 0298

The Moon Goddess must be laughing at me right now.

A year ago, I kidnapped a Guardian, trying to force her into being my mate. Turned out she was underage—my mark didn’t take.

I’ve since realized how wrong that was.

Yet here I stand, staring into the eyes of my new mate.

Another Guardian.

She approaches cautiously, sizing me up. "What can I get you?"

"Water," I say. "And your name. And what time your shift ends. We need to talk."

She doesn’t flinch. "Water. Coming right up."

I catch her wrist before she can leave. "Your name."

Behind me, a chair scrapes. She glances past my shoulder. "It's fine, Reginald."

Then those sharp eyes lock onto mine. "Isolde. And no, we don’t have anything to discuss. You ordering food, or should I bother bringing that water?"

Damn. That attitude? Hot.

Not that I’d admit it, but everything about her turns me on. Strong. Sassy. Exactly my type—not that I’ve had much experience. Spent years running, then six months in a cell getting my ass kicked daily.

"I’m not leaving, Isolde."

She nods and walks off.

Reginald steps up behind me. "Boy, unless you want trouble, walk away from that girl."

I turn. He’s tall—but not as tall as me. Lean where I’m built like a brick wall. And human.

"Sir," I say, keeping my tone respectful, "I won’t hurt her. But we are talking."

To his credit, he doesn’t back down.

Before things escalate, Isolde’s back, sliding between us. "Reginald, sit." Then she jabs a finger at my chest. "You. Sit. Now."

And oh—she’s an Alpha.

Her power rolls off her in waves, whether she realizes it or not. I drop into the booth, half against my will.

She leans in, cherry blossoms and defiance flooding my senses. "Thirty minutes. Then we talk. If you behave. Want food?"

I smirk. She’s affected too—her scent gives her away. Pissed? Maybe. But her body knows I’m hers.

"Whatever you like best."

Her smirk matches mine. Mistake.

She returns with a banana split.

Not dinner. But I’ll play along.

I eat slowly, watching her work. Taking orders. Cleaning tables. Talking to everyone but me.

Questions burn in my skull.

Where are her parents? Why’s an Alpha working a diner in some human town? Does she even know she’s a Guardian?

Because if she does, she should know how dangerous that is.

The second word gets out that a Guardian’s died, every Alpha in the country will hunt her.

And the mate bond? Most wolves don’t react like she did—like I’m some inconvenience.

Rejection isn’t an option.

I need to contact Adrian Grey. Find out which Guardian died—probably in the vampire battle.

Blackthorn and Nightshade Packs will be grieving. They need to know their Guardian’s been reborn.

Why Isolde’s here, alone, I don’t know. But if she won’t let me mark her yet, she needs protection.

The safest place for her?

With me. And the other Guardians.

Whether she likes it or not.

###Chapter 0299

Our first conversation carried more emotional weight than I'd anticipated.

When her shift ended, Isolde collected my dishes before vanishing into the kitchen. I tensed, listening for any sign she might slip out the back exit. Relief washed over me when she reappeared moments later, a crossbody bag secured across her chest, sliding into the booth opposite me.

Her golden eyes locked onto mine. "Well? You wanted to talk. So talk."

"Not here." I lowered my voice. "I'll walk you home."

"That's not happening." Her fingers tightened around her bag strap. "You're not getting my address."

I leaned across the table, catching the faint citrus scent of her shampoo. "You know what I am. Tracking you would be child's play. Do you really want your human friend overhearing this?"

Her gaze flickered over my shoulder to where Theodore watched us with undisguised curiosity.

"Goodnight, Theo." She stood abruptly, waiting for me to follow.

As we reached the door, the older man called out, "Text me when you get home safe, Izzy."

The night air hit us as we stepped outside. A thousand questions burned my tongue, but Magnus's possessive growl in my mind twisted them into something sharper. "What's he to you? That human. He's old enough to be your grandfather."

Her laugh held no humor. "He practically is. And he's the reason I never wound up in foster care." She shot me a sideways glance. "Not that you can judge. How old are you? Forty?"

"Victor. Thirty-two." I ignored her jab. "So your parents are dead?"

"My mother is. Never knew my father. Don't care to."

"But you're an Alpha."

She froze mid-step, shock flashing across her features. "How did you—"

"Because you commanded me back in the diner. Felt your Alpha aura slam into me like a freight train." I studied her bewildered expression. "You didn't even realize you were doing it, did you?"

Isolde shook her head, strands of chestnut hair catching the streetlight. "I just wanted you away from Theo."

"What's your wolf's name?"

"Aurora."

My pulse jumped. "And she just manifested? Because a week ago, you didn't have a wolf."

"Got her on my eighteenth birthday."

"Happy belated." I made a mental note to find her a gift, though what do you buy for a female Alpha who hates birthdays?

She shrugged. "Not exactly a holiday I celebrate. Too many bad memories. Though getting Aurora made this one... different."

The pieces clicked together—late wolf manifestation, dead mother, absent Alpha father. My gut twisted. Odds were high her own pack had discarded her, assuming she'd never shift. I'd seen it before with Alpha bloodlines; children cast out for failing to meet expectations.

"Aurora." I addressed the wolf directly, watching golden flecks bleed into Isolde's irises as her spirit surfaced. Magnus pressed against my consciousness, drawn to his mate. "Do you know what you are?"

"A Guardian," came the immediate response, her voice layered with Aurora's resonance.

"And what does that mean?"

"That we're destined to protect our mate."

I blinked. That wasn't the answer I expected. "Protect me from what?"

"Anything that would harm you."

A dry laugh escaped me. "We'll circle back to that. Right now, you're the one who needs protection. If any Alpha discovers you, they'll force a bond. A wolf like you? Packs would kill to claim you permanently."

She whirled to face me, moonlight catching the challenge in her gaze. "And you? What do you want?"

"What do you mean?"

"Do you want me for my power?"

"I want you because the Moon Goddess carved our souls from the same star." My palm itched to touch her, but I clenched my fist. "You're my other half."

Isolde's next words sliced through the night like shattered glass. "I don't believe in mate bonds."

###Chapter 0300

"This is my place." I say as we stop outside my apartment building. Aurora could have warned me about becoming this man's Guardian. The term still feels foreign, but she insists we're irrevocably tied to him now. A man who looks old enough to be my father yet is supposedly my destined mate.

He's not unattractive. Quite the opposite. His entire presence screams danger - midnight skin, obsidian eyes, hair black as a moonless night. Even through his leather jacket, I can see the defined muscles. Shoulders broad enough to carry the weight of the world. Thighs like ancient oaks straining against his dark jeans.

But none of that matters. I've seen firsthand how poisonous the mate bond can be. Watched my mother wither away under my father's cruelty until there was nothing left. I won't let history repeat itself.

"Thanks for the escort. Conversation was... enlightening." I reach for the door handle when his fingers wrap around my wrist.

"This isn't over. We have more to discuss."

"My part in this discussion is finished. You got more of my time than most strangers do. I've got things to do. Goodnight." I wrench my hand free and slam the door before he can respond.

An hour later, I venture outside. The night air carries his lingering scent - sandalwood and something distinctly wild. Damn the Moon Goddess for making mates smell this intoxicating. As if their unnatural attractiveness wasn't enough temptation.

At the forest's edge, I strip quickly and let the shift take me. The familiar prickle of unseen eyes makes my fur stand on end, but the wind reveals no intruders. Aurora takes control, following our usual patrol route along the territory borders until we reach the river.

She's drinking when I spot him. A massive black wolf, easily Alpha-sized, melting into the shadows. Only the full moon's glow gives him away.

Aurora inhales sharply. 'It's him.' Her voice purrs through my mind.

'Who?'

'Victor. Our mate.' She takes a step forward.

'What are you doing?'

'Introducing ourselves properly.'

'Like hell we are. Home. Now.'

We engage in our usual mental tug-of-war before she reluctantly concedes. Back at my clothes, his presence still prickles along my skin. Shifting with an audience feels violating, but I have no choice. Turning away from the unseen gaze, I change quickly and jog home, locking every bolt behind me.

'He's protecting us,' Aurora insists. 'Keeping us safe.'

'Explain what he meant about Alphas forcing Guardians into bonds.'

Her hesitation speaks volumes. 'Guardians amplify pack strength. For centuries, Alphas have... acquired us through less than voluntary means. He's right - once word spreads about your awakening, every Alpha will be hunting you.'

'Then we keep doing what we've always done. Stay invisible.'

Next morning at the diner, his scent hits me before the bell finishes chiming. I can't exactly ban him from a public place. He orders coffee and proceeds to occupy a booth through my entire shift.

"Most customers don't camp out for eight hours," I remark while refilling his mug for the fifth time.

###Chapter 0301

"I'm not leaving until you do. You might be finished talking, but I'm not." Victor's voice is firm, and I exhale sharply.

"You don’t understand the danger you’re in. I have suggestions, but we need privacy."

"Fine." I move behind the counter to clock out and grab my purse before approaching him. "Let’s go."

The evening air is cool as we step outside. "Funny how I was perfectly safe before you showed up," I say, making air quotes around the word 'safe.'

His expression darkens. "A week ago, you didn’t have a wolf. Now you’re an Alpha female with a Guardian. Every Alpha male will hunt you the moment word spreads about Gregory’s death."

Aurora flinches in my mind. 'What’s wrong?'

'I remember Gregory and Evander. Evander was the wolf who carried the Guardian spirit before me. Gregory was his human.'

I narrow my eyes at Victor. "How did you know Gregory?"

"I know all three Guardians—or did. My reputation with them isn’t stellar. But I called Adrian, Alpha of Blackthorn Pack, last night to confirm which Guardian had died. They fought vampires recently, and one Guardian was killed. That’s how you inherited the spirit."

He steps closer. "They want you to visit. I told Adrian I’d try to persuade you. You’ll be safe there… until you let me mark you."

I freeze. "Excuse me? Mark me?"

Victor looms over me, his gaze intense. "Yes. My canines in your neck, yours in mine. Then we mate. The bond seals."

"Not happening, old man. I’m fine where I am."

His laugh is dark. "You’re happy working a human job, sneaking around pack territories at night, hoping no one realizes what you are? That no Alpha will force you into his pack and claim you?"

His fingers tilt my chin up. His breath is warm against my lips. "And I’m not old."

I scoff, but my pulse betrays me. Heat pools low in my stomach. Aurora purrs in my head, practically ready to shift and rub against him. Traitor.

'He’s our mate. Look at him. Strong. Powerful. I wonder if—'

"Aurora!"

'If you won’t act, I will.'

Before I can stop her, she surges forward. My lips crash against Victor’s.

He doesn’t hesitate. His hand tangles in my hair, holding me in place as his mouth claims mine. His tongue sweeps past my lips, and a growl rumbles from his chest.

I grip his shirt, dizzy. His scent—spice and storm—overwhelms me. My knees buckle, but his arm locks around my waist.

His kiss is demanding. Dominating. I’ve only been kissed once before, at eight years old, by a packmate on a dare. This is nothing like that.

Wait—what am I doing?

I shove him back. "That can’t happen again."

Victor smirks, rubbing his nose against mine. "Your wolf disagrees." He kisses my nose before releasing me.

###Chapter 0302

My breath catches when Isolde suddenly leans in and presses her lips to mine. I don't hesitate to respond, deepening the kiss immediately. It's clear she's never done this before, but her shy curiosity only fuels my desire.

When she pulls away, I see the mate bond and her wolf, Aurora, overwhelming her. That's fine by me. Magnus keeps growling in my mind, demanding I mark her and claim her as ours. But I won't make that mistake again—not after forcing a bond on someone who didn't want it.

Last night, when I called Adrian, his first question was whether I'd forced the bond on Isolde. After explaining she's my fated mate and that I haven't marked her yet, we both agreed the situation isn't ideal. A young, unmated Alpha female who's also a Guardian, alone in the world? That's a target on her back. I also told him there's something dark in her past, and I intend to uncover it. If she refuses to leave willingly, we've agreed to take more drastic measures.

We continue walking in silence. "Tell me about your father," I say.

"Why do you care?" she snaps. There's definitely a story there. Anyone who's seen the mate bond in action would know why I care—she's mine. Even if she weren't, I'd still want to help her.

"I care because I'm your mate. But beyond that, you're out here alone when you have a parent who should be protecting you." We reach her porch, and I stop, studying her. "Let me guess—as an Alpha, your father couldn't stand that you didn't have your wolf. So he either banished you or started abusing you. Your mother probably got you out or followed you into exile. If that's true, then the severed mate bond is what slowly killed her. How close am I?"

The look on her face tells me I've hit the mark. She turns, pushing open the front door. Tonight, she doesn't slam it in my face. I linger in the doorway, watching as she moves inside.

"You might as well come in," she mutters when she notices I'm still there.

The place is barely bigger than my hotel room—and that's saying something, considering this one has a kitchen. No wonder she works at the diner; at least there, she can eat real food. Her kitchen consists of a mini fridge, a sink, a sliver of counter space, a hot plate, and a microwave. No stove.

She fills a pot with water and sets it on the hot plate, then pulls two tea bags from one of her two cabinets. "Tea?" she asks.

I nod. I don't usually drink tea, but if it means more time with her, I'll drink anything.

She grabs two mugs—the only two she owns—and drops a tea bag into each. When the water boils, she pours it carefully.

"Cream or sugar?"

"I'll take it how you take it."

She leaves both cups black and carries them to a tiny table, setting them down. "You can have the chair," she says, settling onto the floor.

Instead of taking the only chair, I sit across from her on the floor.

###Chapter 0303

Selene's fingers tightened around her teacup as she lost herself in thought. I remained silent, giving her space to gather her words.

"My father was a good man—once." Her voice was quiet, edged with old pain. "For the first ten years of my life, he was the perfect Alpha, the perfect father. I was his only child, his heir. But when I didn’t shift at ten… everything changed."

She exhaled sharply, as if the memory still burned. "At first, he was patient. Then came the anger. Then the cruelty. He turned on my mother, blaming her for not giving him a 'worthy' heir." The word twisted bitterly in her mouth.

"He exiled me when I was twelve. My mother refused to let me go alone—she knew I wouldn’t survive. We ran. Found this place. Spent a year looking over our shoulders, ready to bolt at the first sign of him."

Her fingers trembled as she lifted the tea bag from her cup, setting it aside. "Then he started taking other women. At first, I didn’t understand. My mother just called it betrayal. But it happened more and more. She grew weaker. Couldn’t shift anymore."

A dark shadow crossed her face. "On my sixteenth birthday, he killed her." Her voice cracked. "I’m sure he knew what day it was. He’d ruined enough of them before."

"What do you think he did?" I kept my voice low, careful not to pull her from the memory.

She met my gaze, her eyes sharpening with cold certainty. "He marked another she-wolf. Took a second mate. And it destroyed her."

"So that’s why you don’t believe in the mate bond."

"Would you?" Her laugh was hollow. "I’ve seen what it does. I won’t let any man have that kind of power over me."

I couldn’t argue. Her father wasn’t the first Alpha to twist the bond into something ugly. But I’d also seen the other side—Adrian and Evelyn, Sebastian and Seraphina. The bond didn’t make them weak. It made them stronger.

"Not all men are like him," I said softly.

Her jaw clenched. "How would I know?"

"Give me a chance to prove it."

She shook her head. "My father was different—until I failed him. If I’d shifted, I might never have seen the monster underneath."

"Your father was a bastard. That doesn’t mean I am." I leaned forward, holding her gaze. "Even if I wanted to be cruel, Magnus wouldn’t let me. My wolf would tear me apart before I hurt my mate—or my child."

"You can’t know that."

"I do." My voice dropped. "I grew up without a father. I won’t let my child do the same."

###Chapter 0304

Victor's confession hits me like a freight train. "I grew up without parents," he admits, his voice rough with buried pain.

My breath catches. This wasn't what I expected.

"What happened to them?" I press. If I'm sharing my past, he owes me his truth too.

"My mother died bringing me into this world." His jaw clenches so tight I hear his teeth grind.

"And your father?" I keep my voice soft. Something tells me this story won't have a happy ending.

Muscles ripple along his throat before he speaks. "Short version? My father challenged our Alpha's heir to a duel after that bastard got my older brother killed—the brother who was supposed to be our next Beta. The Alpha forbade it, but his son accepted. My father... in his grief, he killed the Alpha's only child." He drains his tea in one swallow before meeting my gaze again.

"The Alpha made me watch as he took my father's head. Called him a traitor. Blamed him for both deaths. Then he cast me out at twelve years old." A bitter laugh escapes him. "So yeah, I get why your mother worried about surviving alone at that age. I barely did."

My throat constricts. Our stories mirror each other—except he had no one.

"How did you make it?"

A ghost of a smile touches his lips as he stares past me. "Six months of starving in the woods before the Luna of a neighboring pack found me. Brought me food, clothes... even read to me. Those few months were the only time I ever knew what having a mother felt like."

There's more. I can feel it. "What changed?"

His exhale carries the weight of centuries. "The Alpha who banished me wanted more territory. More power. Another heir. He attacked her pack. I heard he planned to kill the Luna first—to weaken her mate before finishing him."

Victor's voice fractures. "I tried to save her. Got there too late."

Silence stretches between us, thick with shared grief. Finally, I ask, "Did her Alpha win?"

"No. Alpha Cassian executed him. But they thought I'd murdered Luna Isolde. Spent nearly twenty years hunting me for it." His fingers tighten around the empty cup. "I'd just gotten out of Sebastian's dungeons when I found you."

My brows shoot up. "Sebastian? Why were you—"

"Alpha Cassian and Luna Isolde's son. He took over the hunt after his father died."

Words fail me. His life makes mine look like a fairy tale. "How'd you get free?"

"Didn't. His mate—another Guardian—knew I was telling the truth. She convinced him. Gave me clothes, cash, and a bus ticket that led me straight to you." He leans forward. "Point is, Evelyn, I've known monstrous Alphas. But I've also seen good ones—like Sebastian and Adrian. Both mated to Guardians. Both decent men."

We sit in heavy silence, lost in our ghosts. Eventually, I voice the question that's been burning since he returned.

"Where did you go? You left so suddenly."

His eyes darken. "Overheard humans at the diner talking about animal attacks."

"Yeah, that was weird. Attacks everywhere, then nothing."

"Those weren't animals." His gaze turns lethal. "Vampires. Headed south to slaughter Sebastian and Adrian's packs. Take their Guardians as blood slaves. Sebastian's mate, Seraphina? A vampire prince kept her captive for seven years. I had to warn them." He exhales sharply. "Couldn't save Isolde... but I made damn sure her son got enough warning to protect his own."

###Chapter 0305

"Wait. You actually went back to the man who kept you locked in his dungeon for months just to warn him about the vampires?"

"Yes."

"Why?"

"It was the right thing to do. And... I owed Isolde a debt—at least in my heart. She was the only one who helped me when no one else would. I couldn’t save her, but I could protect her son."

"You have a strange way of defining honor," I tell him.

He considers this. "What if Theodore found out what you are and fired you? Maybe even forced you to leave town. He’s helped you, protected you in his own way." I nod, unsure where he’s going with this. "Even if he turned against you, and you learned someone was coming to hurt him... wouldn’t you still feel compelled to warn him?"

I think about it, then nod again. "Maybe. I don’t know. I’ve never been in that position."

Our tea has long gone cold. "So, instead of stalking me like a creep tonight, how about we go for a run?" I offer with a half-smile.

He grins. "I’d love to. But let’s stay clear of those pack borders. The last thing we need is them catching your scent and wondering why a lone she-wolf keeps lurking near their territory."

"Except I won’t be alone tonight, will I?" I stand, taking our mugs to the sink.

He follows me outside. I duck behind a tree to undress while Victor, unsurprisingly, has no qualms about nudity. I vaguely recall pack life where shifting made modesty pointless, but six years among humans has conditioned me differently.

Once shifted, Aurora emerges. She spots Magnus and practically prances toward him—if she were human, those hips would be swinging. She nuzzles him, rubbing her face along his body before swatting him playfully with her tail and darting off.

I knew it. My wolf is shameless.

I’m not shameless. He’s our mate. Look at him—perfect. She purrs.

Should I roll over and show him my belly too?

If you’d let me, absolutely.

We’re Alphas. We don’t submit.

We do for our mate.

I roll my eyes internally as Aurora weaves through the trees, Magnus chasing her, nipping at her heels. She’s exhilarated, too distracted by him to notice the new scent until it’s too late.

We’ve strayed too close to the border.

Aurora whirls to flee, but two wolves cut her off. As she pivots, Magnus leaps over her, attacking them just as three more emerge.

With a snarl, Aurora faces the newcomers, fangs bared.

###Chapter 0306

I never planned to share my past with Isolde this soon. Yet somehow, my confession broke down her walls. Perhaps our mirrored tragedies will make her see I'm not the monster she thinks. If not as her destined mate, then maybe as an ally.

When she invites me to run with her, my pulse quickens. I would've followed regardless - her safety is my priority, especially near rival territories. Last night's route skated too close to their borders. One glimpse of those golden eyes would reveal her secret. Only Guardians bear that mark.

Magnus is practically giddy chasing Aurora. She's fully embraced their bond, playfully nipping at his heels whenever we catch their scent. I don't realize how far we've strayed until three wolves materialize at the boundary line. Waiting. They've likely tracked her pattern, anticipating this confrontation about her repeated trespasses.

When Aurora pivots and two more wolves spring from the brush, I know claws will fly. I don't hesitate as Magnus vaults over her, locking jaws with the wolves blocking her retreat. Three more join the fray. I pray Aurora will flee beyond their reach. They've seen her eyes now.

Two wolves attack me simultaneously. I brace for the inevitable flank bite that never comes. Instead of running, Aurora engages three opponents at once. While my attackers fight to kill, hers hold back. This terrifies me more - they recognize what she is and have called reinforcements. An untrained Guardian facing five wolves? We need to leave. Now.

I wanted to avoid fatalities, but survival trumps mercy. My hind leg crushes one wolf's throat while my fangs shatter another's foreleg. I hear the snap of bone as Aurora clamps down on a third wolf's flank. His agonized howl will summon the entire pack.

Magnus breaks ribs with a well-placed kick. The last wolf lunges for Aurora's scruff, but she whirls last second. Her jaws close on his throat. The gurgling death rattle echoes as his body collapses.

I nip at Aurora's heels, urging retreat. She understands, bolting toward her apartment. We run flat-out for fifteen minutes before answering howls pierce the night.

At our clothes, we shift and dress in frantic silence.

"We're leaving. Tonight."

"I can't just disappear! Where would I go?"

"Blackthorn and Nightshade territories. Adrian and Sebastian will protect you. But we must go now. They'll hunt you for killing their packmate, Guardian or not."

"I don't have a car. What about Theodore?"

"Call him. Do you need anything from your apartment?"

"Everything left from my mother is there." My jaw tightens.

"Get your things. I'll secure bus tickets. Don't step outside until I return."

The urgency in my voice makes her freeze. She nods once before vanishing into the building. I watch until her silhouette disappears behind the door, praying we haven't run out of time.

###Chapter 0307

My palms cradle her face. "Do you get it now?"

Her breath hitches. "Yes."

I crush my lips to hers in a fleeting kiss. "Move. I'll be there in twenty. Be packed."

The hotel room swallows me whole as I snatch my backpack. The bus terminal reeks of diesel and desperation. Next departure? Fifty-three minutes. Enough time to grab Isolde and disappear. Two tickets burn in my pocket as I sprint back to her place.

Snarls ripple through the pines. They've tracked her scent. Circling like vultures. My fist pounds her door. "Open up. We're leaving."

The door swings wide. Isolde stands there, duffel bag slung across her chest. "I have to warn Theodore—"

"No time." I yank her forward. "Call him from the road. They're here. We can't take on the whole pack."

Her pupils dilate. The door slams shut behind us. We're running now, sneakers slapping pavement. The bus hisses at the platform, half-loaded with passengers.

"Board now. If we're lucky, it's sold out and they can't follow. If not..." My knuckles crack. "We fight at the first stop."

Plastic seats creak beneath us. "What if they chase us?"

"Evading hunters is my specialty." My thumb strokes her wrist. "I'll keep you safe."

The engine roars to life. Through grimy windows, I spot them—pack SUVs screeching into the lot. Frantic gestures. Pointing. Then I see him.

Broad shoulders. Hands planted on hips.

Alpha Magnus locks eyes with me through the glass.

Shit.

This just became a suicide run.

The bus lurches forward. My phone glows in the dark. "I'm calling Adrian first. Then you ring Theodore."

Isolde's fingers worry at her bag's stitching.

"Hey." I trap her trembling hands. "Look at me. I swear on my wolf's life—nothing touches you. You're mine." The growl vibrates in my chest, Magnus surging to the surface.

She nods, but fear bleeds through her scent. "When Mom and I ran...we switched buses every stop. Had cash stashed for emergencies. Should we—"

I tilt her chin up. "Would that help you breathe?"

Another nod.

"Then we hop buses like jackrabbits. Any connection under thirty minutes, we take it. Deal?"

"Deal."

Adrian's voice crackles through the line. Offers backup. I tell him we're being hunted—I'll call when the trail's cold. Then Isolde dials Theodore. The old man's shouting shakes the phone. Kidnapping accusations. It takes three minutes before he believes I'm not the villain here.

When the call dies, I drag her against me. Her head finds my shoulder, but sleep doesn't claim her for hours.

Midnight. First transfer point.

I leap off, scanning the lot. No tails yet. Inside the station, a westbound bus idles. Two more tickets. Two more ghosts in the night.

When I return, Isolde's upright—wild-eyed until she sees me.

"Change of plans." I press tickets into her palm. "Next bus leaves in seven. Let's vanish."

Bags. Sprinting. Another vehicle. Another escape.

For seven days, we zigzag across the state. Their scent clung for seventy-two hours.

Then—silence.

We're ghosts now.

###Chapter 0308

The constant running is wearing me down. Bus after bus, town after town. A week without proper food or a real shower. Theodore called yesterday—two suspicious men were asking about a young woman at the diner.

When Victor finally decides we can stop for the night, we check into a motel. I’m too exhausted to protest sharing a room. Relief washes over me when I see two beds.

"Take a shower. I’ll be back soon."

"Where are you going?"

"Scouting the area. Making sure we’re not followed. Then I’ll grab us real food." His hands cup my face, his lips brushing my forehead. "Don’t open the door for anyone."

The moment he leaves, I head straight for the bathroom. The hot water is heaven against my skin. I tilt my face up, letting it wash away the grime of the road.

We’ve zigzagged across the country—Colorado to Nebraska, then Montana. Through the Sierra Nevada, then south into Arizona before turning east. Victor’s been in constant contact with Alpha Adrian, updating our location twice daily. The mountains were risky—too many packs, too many eyes. But Victor knows how to disappear. Twenty years on the run taught him that.

I finish scrubbing off the journey’s filth and change into clean clothes. My dirty ones go into the sink to soak. They’ll need washing after Victor showers.

The door clicks open. "Just me." The aroma of food hits me before he even steps inside. My stomach growls loudly.

Steaks. Potatoes. Salad. I could cry.

He sets the food on the small table. "Eat. I’ll shower and join you."

The first bite of steak is pure bliss. I moan without thinking, eyes closed, savoring the flavor.

A low chuckle snaps my eyes open.

Victor stands there, dripping wet, a towel slung low on his hips. Water glistens on his chest, trailing down the hard planes of his abdomen. My gaze lingers, tracing the V of his hips.

His voice is rough. "Stop looking at me like that, Isolde."

"Like what?" The words come out breathless.

He moves like a predator, caging me between his arms. "Like you’d rather skip dinner and devour me instead."

Heat radiates off him. My throat goes dry.

His tongue swipes across my bottom lip. Dark eyes hold mine captive. The world narrows to the space between our mouths.

Then he kisses me, and I forget how to breathe.

###Chapter 0309

"You taste even better than you smell. Absolutely intoxicating." Before I can react, his mouth claims mine in a searing kiss. His tongue sweeps inside, drawing a moan from my throat. My fingers dig into his sculpted arms as fire pools low in my belly.

He explores my mouth with deliberate slowness before breaking away. "Mmm, divine," Victor murmurs, licking my swollen lips before standing. The towel tenting at his waist leaves little to the imagination. My cheeks burn at the obvious evidence of his arousal.

I gape as he steps back with a dark chuckle. He grabs his duffel and disappears into the bathroom, emerging minutes later in low-slung athletic shorts that showcase every ridge of his abs.

Victor prowls back to me, nuzzling my cheek before whispering, "You smell like heaven, little wolf, but we both need food." His heated breath fans my ear as he takes the chair opposite mine.

The mention of my scent makes my face flame. I stab my fork into the takeout container rather than respond.

Thankfully, Victor changes the subject. "We'll keep heading east. I know this highway well—it's where Sebastian's warriors ambushed me. We'll follow it to Florida, then shift for the final stretch to northern Georgia."

"How long?"

"A week, maybe. These buses stop at every podunk town. But if we stay safe, we can get proper rest each night."

"Good. I'm running on fumes."

A muscle ticks in Victor's jaw before he schools his expression.

"What aren't you telling me?"

He hesitates, then exhales. "Money's getting tight. Hotels every night will drain my cash fast."

I blink. Guilt twists my gut—he's been funding everything while I've been too panicked to think. Crossing to my bag, I pull out a thick envelope.

"Take this."

He starts to refuse, but I cut him off. "This was my emergency fund. Well, I'm in an emergency. You shouldn't bear this burden alone—not when you're only running because of me."

It's not all I have. Mom left me nearly $10K, and I've added to it over the years. This $1K is just the beginning.

Victor pockets the cash reluctantly. "I'll account for every penny."

"Keep it. There's more if we need it."

I gather our trash, tying the bag neatly. "What time do we leave?"

"Bus departs at seven."

"Then I'm turning in." I slip between the scratchy motel sheets. The lamp clicks off as Victor settles into the other bed.

"Goodnight, Isolde."

His voice wraps around me in the dark, equal parts comfort and danger.

###Chapter 0310

It kills me that I can't provide for Isolde. The thought gnaws at my insides. Sure, I've spent years running, then six months locked in Sebastian's dungeon, but that's no excuse for failing my mate. What stings worse? She and her mother managed to save up during those six years fleeing her father. How the hell are Magnus and I supposed to prove ourselves worthy mates when I can't even afford a damn train ticket or a decent roof over our heads?

I'm sprawled in the darkness, tracing cracks in the ceiling with my eyes, plotting our next move once we reach Adrian's or Sebastian's territory. Then her voice cuts through the silence.

"You awake?" Her whisper is barely audible. I knew she wasn't sleeping. Her breathing never evened out into that slow, steady rhythm of true sleep.

Propping myself up on one elbow, I study her silhouette across the room. Whether by instinct or design, she chose the bed farthest from the door—exactly where I wanted her. Untrained Guardian or not, if anyone bursts through that door, they'll have to go through me first.

"Yeah. Something wrong?"

Silence. I wait, but she doesn't answer.

"Isolde?"

"Can I...come over there? Not for—not for anything like that. It's just...your scent. On the train, I got used to it. Now I can't sleep without it."

I shift toward the wall, keeping myself between her and potential danger, and pat the mattress. "Get over here."

When she curls against me, I stay on my back. She hesitates, sitting upright to study my face in the dark. I tap my chest once. She melts against me instantly, her head finding its place over my heartbeat. My arm locks around her waist, pulling her closer.

Peace. Actual fucking peace. Not something I've felt since...ever. Not when you spend your life watching your back, waiting for the next attack. Even now, with new threats looming, having my mate pressed against me settles something primal inside me.

"What if they catch me?" The words tremble against my skin.

"They won't." My fingers tighten on her hip. "I won't let them."

"But if they do? We can't fight an entire pack, Victor. Neither of us can."

I press my lips to her hair, inhaling her jasmine-and-rain scent until it floods my lungs. "I'll die before I let anyone force a claiming mark on you." My voice drops an octave as Magnus surges forward, roughening every syllable.

She lifts her head, moonlight catching the silver in her eyes. "Promise me something."

"Depends what it is. No blind promises."

"If it's hopeless—if they're about to take me—I want you to mark me."

I jerk like she's electrocuted me. "It won't come to that." The words come out strangled.

Fuck yes, I want to claim her. She's mine. But not like this. Not as some last resort. I want her willing, wanting the bond like Adrian and Sebastian's mates do. I want the devotion I've seen between them. Forcing my mark, even at her request, isn't how our story starts.

###Chapter 0311

"Please." Her voice cracks with desperation, trembling like a leaf in the storm. "Swear to me. I'd endure a forced bond with my destined mate over being marked by some stranger. Promise me this."

My jaw tightens. Can I make such a vow? I've walked this path before. Learned the hard way that forced bonds fracture before they ever truly form.

I meet her gaze in the dim light, those silver eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "I swear this - if I can't protect you or get you to safety, I'll mark you myself before letting any other wolf claim you."

She nods, pressing her damp cheek against my chest. My lips brush her hair as my fingers thread through the silken strands, massaging away her tension. Gradually, her breathing steadies, her body going slack against mine.

Sleep claims me unexpectedly. The scrape of shoes outside our door jolts me awake - years of running have honed my instincts to razor sharpness. Carefully, I disentangle myself from Isolde's arms and pad silently to the door.

Through the peephole, I see them - a couple pressed against the hallway wall, all tangled limbs and hungry mouths. Either hopelessly drunk or clever shifters playing a dangerous game. The stench of alcohol clings to the woman, but the man... that's shifter musk beneath the cologne.

A low growl rumbles in my throat, pitched just for shifter ears. The man's head snaps up instantly, nostrils flaring as he scents the air. "Wrong door, cher," he drawls in that thick bayou accent, steering his drunken companion down the hall. "We don't wanna disturb nobody."

Louisiana. I'd recognize that accent anywhere. More fox than wolf in those parts. I wait until moans echo from down the hallway before returning to bed.

Isolde molds herself against me the moment I settle, her thigh draping over my hips. My body responds instantly, painfully. Every shift of her warm curves against my erection is sweet torture. Sleep won't come like this, but I'd rather ache with her in my arms than know the cold emptiness of her absence.

My fingers trace idle patterns on her back until she stills, until my own eyelids grow heavy.

Morning comes too soon. "Isolde," I murmur, brushing hair from her face. "Time to go, love."

She startles awake, flushing when she realizes how she's draped across me. "Goddess! I didn't mean to-"

"Don't fret." I sit up, rolling my shoulders. "There's a shifter a few doors down. I don't like it. We'll grab breakfast on the way to the bus station."

She disappears into the bathroom to change. I grab my own clothes, adjusting myself discreetly. When she emerges, I duck inside, taking care of my problem surrounded by her lingering scent. Quick work - too quick.

We move like shadows leaving that room. I scan the hallway before ushering her out, closing the door silently behind us. Just in case those shifters were meant to be watching.

###Chapter 0312

We pause at a diner near the bus station for breakfast. I choose a booth tucked away from the windows, giving me a clear view of the street outside while keeping us hidden. The scent of coffee and bacon fills the air as we order. Halfway through our meal, I spot him—the shifter from last night, prowling the sidewalk. His gaze sweeps the diner but passes right over us. Damn it. He’s working with the red wolves.

"Plans just changed. We’re leaving." I drop cash on the table and guide Isolde out the back exit, veering away from the shifter’s path. I inhale deeply, catching his musky, aggressive scent lingering in the air.

"Smell that?" I ask her. She breathes in and nods.

"That’s our tail. If you catch even a whiff of it again, tell me immediately."

We circle the block, sticking to back alleys. I memorized the town’s grid-like layout earlier, and now I use it to our advantage. The bus station comes into view, and I slow our pace, scanning the crowd. There he is—lounging near the central benches like any other traveler. If I hadn’t seen him hunting us earlier, I might’ve believed the act.

I nudge Isolde and point him out. We weave through the parked buses, searching for ours. Relief hits when I find it—the door faces away from him. The departure board says we have twelve minutes. I push Isolde ahead, shielding her with my body as we board. My height makes me a walking target, so if they’ve got my description, this bus just became a trap.

I send Isolde to the rear while I take a seat near the front, eyes locked on the shifter. He’s still scanning the station, oblivious.

The engine rumbles to life. Just as we pull away, two more men sprint up to him. Red wolves. Of course. They’re embedded in Texas and Louisiana. We need a new route.

I slide into the seat beside Isolde. Fear tightens her features. "They didn’t see us," I say. "But we can’t stay on this path. The red wolves are hunting you now."

I drape an arm around her shoulders. "Do you have a license?"

She shakes her head. "Never learned."

Shit. Neither did I. Renting a car won’t help if we can’t drive it. I pull out my phone. Adrian needs to hear this. Plan B starts now.

###Chapter 0313

I meant every word last night when I told Victor to mark me instead of some stranger. Better the devil you know than the one you don’t. At least, that’s what I keep telling myself. I don’t believe in the mate bond, but if I have to choose, I’d rather take my chances with someone who might actually care about me—not some power-hungry Alpha who only sees me as a weapon and a womb.

I know what I am—a Guardian, a rare wolf that every Alpha covets. But the truth? I’m terrified. Until a few weeks ago, I thought I was human, just struggling to survive. Fighting? Defending myself? Those were never part of my reality.

So, as much as I hate feeling dependent, I’m grateful Victor is here. He makes me feel safe. Or at least, safer than I’d be alone. I didn’t expect to sleep last night, but curled against his chest, breathing in his scent, listening to his steady heartbeat—I crashed hard. Waking up practically draped over him? Not ideal. Especially when I felt the evidence of how much he wasn’t immune to our closeness.

Victor’s on the phone with Alpha Adrian. There’s another voice in the background, but I can’t make out the words. Sounds like the Crimson Moon wolves know we’re running. Since they have territory in Arizona and New Mexico, we need to change course fast—head north again. I listen as they map out a route through Oklahoma, then east toward Georgia.

I miss the question, but Victor turns to me. “No, we’re not there yet.” I can guess what they asked. Why doesn’t he just mark me? It would end this chase.

Part of me wants to say yes. Then I remember my father—what it was like to be bound to someone who saw you as property. I’d rather run forever.

I stare out the window at the endless flatlands. Victor hangs up. “We have a plan. Not a great one. If the Crimson Moon wolves are watching bus stations, we’re screwed. Next stop, if it’s clear, we shift and run. We’ll skirt pack territories—it’s the safest option.”

I nod. “I’m sorry you’re stuck in this mess. It’d be easier if I just let you mark me.”

He presses a finger to my lips. “You don’t trust the mate bond. I get it. I can wait. As long as it doesn’t mean you end up bound to someone else.”

Silence stretches between us.

That car’s been pacing us too long, Aurora murmurs in my mind.

I glance out. A dark sedan matches the bus’s speed. Too slow for this empty stretch of road.

“Victor.” My voice is tight. “Aurora says that car’s been tailing us. You think it’s them?”

He leans over me, curses under his breath, and grabs his phone.

“They’re on us,” he snaps as soon as Adrian answers.

“How far to the next station?” A different voice—not Adrian.

“Thirty minutes. Just hitting town limits.”

“Give the phone to Isolde.”

Victor hesitates, then hands it to me.

“Hello?”

“Isolde, this is Alpha Sebastian. Do you recognize my name?”

“I know you’ve been talking to Victor.”

“But you don’t remember me?”

“Should I?”

###Chapter 0314

Victor's low curse reaches my ears. "What does Aurora recall about being a Guardian?"

'Aurora?'

'Only that I'm a Guardian, which means I'm powerful.'

"She knows we're Guardians and that we're strong."

"But she doesn't remember how to tap into that strength? Nothing about her past?"

"Nothing at all."

"Listen, Isolde." His voice turns urgent. "Getting you out without a fight might be impossible. If it comes to it, you run. Fight if you must. Even if it means leaving Victor behind. We can retrieve him later—but you're their target. If you won't accept his mark, then run. Head east. Follow Victor's lead—he's skilled at evasion—but when the moment comes, don't hesitate. Aurora's memories might resurface if she's forced to fight."

"Understood." My reply is automatic. Leaving Victor isn't an option. Aurora has made it clear—we're bound to him as his Guardian. I pass the phone back to Victor.

His gaze burns into me. "Yeah, we'll signal when we're safe. If you don't hear from us in forty-eight hours, send a search party." He ends the call with Alpha Sebastian.

"You need to run if he says so. Even if it means abandoning me."

"I can't. Aurora won't allow it. We're bound to you as your Guardian."

Victor exhales sharply. "I have a plan, but no guarantees. When we arrive, we move fast. They'll have to park, giving us seconds to exit the bus and run. With luck, the station's scent chaos will mask our trail. Without it, they'll track us and call backup. Pray Aurora's fast enough."

As the bus station looms into view, Victor nudges us toward seats near the door. The second the vehicle halts, we're on our feet. The doors hiss open—Victor leaps out, yanking me behind him. His head swivels, assessing, then we're sprinting past buses and weaving through the station's chaos.

We reach the building's rear. One final scan—then we bolt for the treeline. The open ground offers no cover. Our only chance is speed.

Paws hit earth the moment we breach the trees. Fur replaces skin as we run. An hour in, a howl pierces the air. They're hunting.

Every stream, every pond—we wade through, scrambling over slick rocks to break our scent trail. Alligators lurk beneath murky surfaces, forcing us to limit our aquatic detours.

At last, we pause. Lungs heaving, we devour protein bars from Victor's pack. He unfolds a map, squinting at terrain markers. "North remains our priority, but we can angle east soon."

His eyes find mine. "How's Aurora holding up?"

"She's fine. We can keep going."

Victor nods. "We run till dusk. Find shelter if possible—otherwise, we push through the night. No caves here. Trees will have to suffice."

Muscles scream as daylight fades. A weathered sign announces our proximity to the Colorado border. Beyond a drowsy town, rolling foothills rise. Victor—no, Magnus—scouts ahead, nose twitching. He signals safety.

I collapse the instant he gives the all-clear.

The ground is cold. The night is alive with danger. And we are far from safe.

###Chapter 0315

My mate is stronger than she realizes. Pushing through an entire day of running would break most wolves. I drove us relentlessly, knowing the red wolves were tracking our scent. The silence stretching for hours gives me cautious hope we might have breathing room.

Near the Colorado border, I spot a rocky outcrop perfect for shelter. Isolde needs rest more than I do. Years of survival have conditioned me to function on minimal sleep, but she's lived a sheltered life until now. Tomorrow we'll slow our pace, but first we must clear Silver Fang territory.

When Aurora collapses from exhaustion, I shift and pull on shorts before gathering her in my arms. Her wolf form is magnificent - obsidian fur streaked with russet and gold. A unique beauty I've never seen before.

"I've got you, love," I murmur as she whimpers. "You were incredible today. Magnus and I are so proud." Her muscles tremble beneath my fingers as I massage her shoulders, working down her spine. Her whines gradually turn to contented rumbles.

Using pine boughs and vines, I fashion a crude nest. When her eyes grow heavy, I nuzzle her muzzle. "Rest now. I won't be long."

She jerks awake, scrambling up. I press a firm hand to her chest. "Stay. You're safe here. Remain in wolf form. Promise?" Her tongue swipes my cheek in answer.

Magnus hunts with lethal efficiency, taking down three rabbits. He presents them to Aurora with a proud rumble. My mate hesitates only briefly before tearing into the first with ravenous hunger. She devours two before nudging the last toward Magnus with her nose.

He cleans her muzzle tenderly before swallowing the final rabbit. With gentle insistence, he herds her back under the overhang, curling his massive form around hers. I feel her relax against him with a sigh.

We remain alert until the rhythm of her breathing lulls us into light sleep.

Moonlight still bathes the landscape when my eyes snap open. Magnus lifts his head, nostrils flaring. The night sounds ordinary at first - rustling rodents, an owl's call, distant water. Then comes the unmistakable crunch of paws on pine needles. Multiple sets.

Aurora's glowing eyes meet mine in the dark. She's already alert, nudging my shoulder in silent understanding. We move like shadows up the hillside, using the terrain to our advantage. The pursuing wolves will lose precious time navigating the steep incline.

Once clear, I set a punishing pace, letting Aurora find her rhythm before pushing harder. By afternoon we reach the Missouri River's rushing waters. The rocky banks offer countless hiding spots if we avoid human trails.

Finding a secluded cove with fresh water access, I shift back and dress quickly. "Isolde, I'm getting us proper food. Stay hidden in wolf form. If danger comes, run east." When she protests, I cradle her face. "You're too vital - to me and all Guardians. If they come, you flee."

Our foreheads touch. "I'll always find you. Stay safe, my heart." With one last look, I shift again, gripping my bag in powerful jaws as I vanish into the trees.

###Chapter 0316

This helplessness is suffocating. What terrifies me more is the gnawing fear when Victor isn't by my side. I'd face capture with him rather than be left alone like this. Back in my old town with Mom and Benny, at least I had roots—a home, a job, familiarity. Here? Without Victor, I'm adrift in a sea of unfamiliar sights and sounds, every rustle making my pulse spike.

I curl deeper into the rocky crevice Victor scouted for me. His knack for finding safe havens still amazes me. Then again, survival's been his life for years.

"He's a worthy mate," Aurora murmurs in my mind.

I can tell she's utterly smitten—not just with Magnus after last night's tender massage, but with Victor himself.

"He didn't have to ease our aches before hunting. Most wouldn't bother. But he's different—attentive, protective."

She's right. Victor hasn't pressured the bond once. Even our makeshift sleeping arrangements show his restraint. And though I won't admit it aloud, the bond's pull is undeniable. His presence steadies me, which makes his absence cut deeper.

"Let him claim us," Aurora urges.

I've considered it. He's proven himself—risking everything to keep us safe. But marking is permanent, reversible only by death. Trusting someone with forever? That's a leap I'm not ready to take.

A sign during our flight revealed we're near Black Canyon. The scenery should be breathtaking, but anxiety drowns out any appreciation. Every minute Victor's gone tightens the coil in my chest. I should rest, but my nerves won't allow it.

As I watch clouds drift, Aurora's consciousness sharpens.

"What is it?"

Through her senses, I feel her zero in on movement below. Ears pricked, she detects what I can't see—bodies shifting through underbrush.

"Scan our perimeter. Are we surrounded?" Dread claws up my throat.

"Stay calm, Isolde. Panic will give us away. Let me handle this."

I refuse to be some Alpha's trophy—forced into bonding just to bolster their pack's strength.

"There." Aurora's vision reveals ten wolves slinking through the trees. The lead one lifts its muzzle, sniffing the air before nosing the ground.

"Tracker," she growls. "We move. Now."

She slips from the crevice, weaving through rocks and foliage with practiced stealth.

"Where?"

"Victor said east. But first south—to water. We'll break our scent there."

Descending the hill, Aurora bursts into a sprint. The forest blurs past us until a howl pierces the air. They've found our hideout.

My blood turns to ice when answering howls encircle us.

"New plan," Aurora pants. "Straight east. Pray we hit water."

She rockets forward, pain forgotten. But the chase only fuels their bloodlust. Without Victor, my sole hope is outrunning them long enough for him to find us.

Another howl—closer this time. Aurora pushes harder. We crash through a shallow creek without slowing.

Panting and paw-steps close in from the left.

"Aurora—"

"I know." She swerves right, only to hear pursuers flanking us. East it is, then, flat terrain leaving no room for error.

They're closing in. The weaker wolves have fallen back—only the strongest remain. Which means their Alpha is likely among them, intent on claiming me.

After an hour of flat-out running, Aurora's running on fumes. Victor must know we're gone by now. Unless they left wolves to delay him...

A nip at Aurora's hind leg sends her tumbling. She scrambles up, only to be bitten again. A well-placed kick connects with a pursuer's snout, but his yelp offers no comfort.

We're hopelessly outnumbered.

###Chapter 0317

A massive russet wolf barrels into us from the side, sending Isolde sprawling onto the forest floor. By the time she scrambles up, we're completely encircled. Six wolves form an impenetrable ring around us, led by the same reddish beast that just knocked us down.

Isolde stands rigid, chest heaving as she assesses the threat. The russet wolf begins shifting, his transformation leaving him hunched over and panting. When he finally straightens, his gaze locks onto Isolde with predatory hunger. A possessive grin splits his face.

Aurora responds with a vicious snarl, lips peeling back to reveal gleaming fangs.

The male raises his hands in mock surrender. I don't buy it for a second. Not when his pack has us trapped, and he's been stalking me relentlessly for days.

"You led us on quite the chase, Guardian." His voice drips with arrogance. "But the game's over. I'm Alpha Dominic, and I claim you as mine."

Aurora's snarl intensifies, her teeth snapping dangerously close to his face.

"Easy now." He tsks. "You can't escape. Be a good girl, shift back, and let me mark you properly."

What chills me more than his casual claim is his obvious physical reaction. Even half-hard, he's nowhere near Victor's size, but his intentions are clear. He'll force the mating bond the moment his mark sets.

'Aurora, if he gets within—'

'I'm tearing his throat out.'

Good. We're in agreement. But that doesn't solve our immediate problem. Six against one are impossible odds.

"You can come willingly and I'll be gentle," Dominic purrs. "Or fight, and my pack will hold you down while I take what's mine. Either way, you're leaving with my mark. Choose."

This is exactly why I've been running. I should've let Victor claim me when I had the chance.

"Hard way it is." He starts shifting back. He'll mark Aurora first to weaken her, then force my human form to complete the bond.

As a last resort, I unleash a desperate howl. If Victor's within range, maybe—

The pack attacks before Dominic finishes transforming. Aurora fights like a demon, tearing fur and flesh alike. I think she rips off someone's ear. But six trained warriors overwhelm us quickly.

They pin Aurora belly-down, her furious growls vibrating through me. Dominic's wolf form settles heavily across her back, his jaws clamping her scruff to force submission. His dominance aura rolls over us—and does absolutely nothing.

A commotion erupts behind us. The weight lessens as Dominic turns to look. Aurora seizes the moment, twisting to sink her fangs into his throat. Hot blood sprays as she tears free.

We're up and sprinting when Dominic slams into us again, his neck wound gushing. His teeth graze my marking spot—

Then a black blur hurls him sideways. Magnus.

The two Alphas collide in a whirlwind of claws and fangs. Victor positions himself between me and Dominic, giving me space to flee. But I can't abandon him. Not when he's magnificent like this—larger than Dominic despite being Beta-born.

With Dominic already wounded, Victor gains the upper fast. The other wolves form a silent circle, respecting the dominance challenge. Interference would mean doubting their Alpha's strength.

They trade brutal blows until Victor finally clamps his jaws around Dominic's spine. The audible crack echoes through the clearing. Victor gives one final shake before dropping the lifeless body.

Then he's human again, standing before me gloriously naked and blood-splattered.

"Mine!" The single word rasps from his throat, more beast than man.

The remaining wolves suddenly lunge for me—new Alphas seeking to claim the prize. Victor tackles the nearest while shouting, "Run!"

Aurora doesn't hesitate. We're sprinting when I hear Victor shift behind us. Snarls and yelps chase us through the trees.

Something nips my heel. We stumble but recover—only to be tackled again. A crushing weight presses me into the dirt. It vanishes abruptly, but another body replaces it.

Sharp pain erupts at my marking spot as fangs pierce skin.

"No!" My mental scream drowns in darkness. The last thing I sense is reaching for Victor as the world fades away.

###Chapter 0318

I left Isolde in the safest spot possible before heading into town for supplies. As I approached the outskirts, I shifted and called Adrian, warning him we were still being pursued by the crimson wolves. I told him I hoped our lead was enough to avoid further trouble.

While speaking, my gaze swept the area. Then I saw them—three vehicles with men standing guard, sniffing the air like only shifters could. Their attention snapped toward the direction where I'd left Aurora.

"Adrian, I have to go. They've found us." I hung up and bolted back toward the tree line, shifting mid-stride.

Halfway there, a chilling howl pierced the air.

They had found her.

Or at least, they'd found where she'd been. That wasn't a victory cry—it was the sound of hunters closing in. I veered east, praying she'd followed my instructions and run. When another howl echoed from the south, I knew she was trying to evade them. But they had her surrounded.

Rounding a bend, I spotted shifters in human form setting up camp, lighting a fire. No time for them. I sprinted past, but their presence confirmed one thing—their Alpha was here, and he wanted Aurora.

Magnus pushed harder, legs burning as we raced toward her.

Then I saw it.

My heart nearly stopped.

Aurora was pinned beneath multiple wolves, a massive Alpha looming over her, forcing her head into the dirt. His dominance rolled off him in waves, but he didn’t realize—Guardians don’t submit.

Magnus lunged, tearing two wolves off her. Aurora scrambled free, but the Alpha was on her again, jaws snapping, trying to claim her.

'Magnus, take him down.'

'No one touches our mate and lives.'

He launched at the Alpha, knocking him aside before positioning us between him and Aurora.

The Alpha turned, eyes burning with fury.

This would be a fight to the death.

A part of me wished Aurora would run, but I knew she wouldn’t. She took her duty as a Guardian seriously, even if she didn’t fully understand it yet.

The Alpha fought like a demon.

Even wounded, he came at us with everything. We were larger, but he was vicious. Every scar, every battle I'd ever fought—I needed all of it just to hold my ground.

Then Magnus seized his chance.

Jaws clamped around the Alpha’s neck, shaking violently until bone snapped.

Shifting back, I snarled at the remaining wolves. "Mine."

They attacked as one.

I shifted again, ripping through them—one down, then another, claws slicing deep.

Magnus wanted blood, but then Aurora was tackled. He lunged, dragging the wolf off by its tail.

I never wanted to force a claim.

But I’d promised to protect her.

And right now?

The only way was to mark her before they did.

###Chapter 0319

"She belongs to us." Magnus's growl echoes through my mind as he pounces on her, his fangs sinking deep into her neck.

The mate bond ignites instantly. I feel her terror like a live wire, and in her final conscious moment, my name tears through her thoughts—Victor! Then Isolde goes limp. I keep pumping venom into her while she's unconscious, ensuring her scent changes to carry my mark before Magnus withdraws his fangs.

He turns, standing protectively over Isolde as she shifts back to human form. A vicious snarl rips from his throat at the four remaining wolves. She's claimed, but that won't stop them from trying to kill me and reclaim her.

Their eyes dart between each other, then to their dead Alpha and the other warrior I just slaughtered. A silent conversation passes between them before they bolt into the trees. I'm not naive enough to think this is over. I saw the rest of their pack at their camp. They'll be furious—their Alpha dead, another high-ranked wolf gone. And now they know I have the Guardian. That only makes me a bigger target.

I shift back swiftly, sprinting to where I left Isolde's bag. I grab mine, yank on a shirt and shorts, then sling both bags over my shoulder. Cradling Isolde against my chest, I take off running.

Near the next town, I dress her in fresh clothes from her bag. I find an empty field just outside the town limits and lay her down carefully. Then I head into town alone, straight to the bus station. The next eastbound bus leaves in two hours. Not ideal, but it's the fastest way out.

Now comes the tricky part—getting an unconscious woman onto a bus without drawing attention.

I buy tickets, then stop for food and water. She hasn't eaten in who knows how long, and she'll need hydration when she wakes.

Back at the field, Isolde is exactly where I left her. I scoop her up and take back roads to the bus depot. When I arrive, I spot our bus's designated bay and sit with her slumped against me, my arm around her like she's just napping.

The bus pulls in. I wait until the last passenger disembarks and the driver steps away. Then I move fast—lifting Isolde, carrying her on board, and claiming two seats in the back.

We ride through the night and into the next day. She still hasn't stirred. My nerves tighten with every passing hour.

At the outskirts of a larger city, I make a decision. We need a hotel. I have to contact Adrian, and more importantly, I need to make sure my mate is okay.

I wait until the bus empties before carrying Isolde off. The hotel is only a block away, but the stares are unavoidable. So I play it off—whispering against her ear, adjusting her in my arms like a lovesick fool carrying his drunk girlfriend home.

At the front desk, I prop her in a lobby chair long enough to check in. Once inside our room, I change her into one of my shirts and tuck her into bed. Then I lock the door and head back out—food, supplies, and a call to Adrian can't wait any longer.

###Chapter 0320

Consciousness returns in slow waves.

The unfamiliar scent of detergent and pine cleaner assaults my senses. My eyes flutter open to an empty hotel room, the sterile white sheets tangled around my legs.

Memory crashes over me like a tidal wave.

My fingers fly to my throat, tracing the tender puncture wounds. The claiming mark.

"Aurora? Where are we?"

"Same as you—I was unconscious."

I push myself upright, scanning the room. Two duffel bags sit near the dresser—mine and Victor's. I scramble to his bag first, rifling through the contents to confirm it's his. My own bag appears untouched, cash still tucked in the side pocket.

The blackout curtains are drawn. I creep to the window, peeling back a corner. A bus terminal glows neon across the street.

That's when I realize I'm wearing nothing but an oversized t-shirt that smells like cedar and musk. Victor's scent clings to the fabric.

"Aurora...do you think Victor saved us? Is this his mark?"

The bedside phone rings, shattering the silence.

I stare at it for three full rings before snatching up the receiver.

"Isolde?" Victor's voice crackles through the line, laced with urgency. "I can feel your panic through the bond. I'm two blocks away—got us food. You must be starving."

"Victor! The mark—"

"Mine. I'll explain everything. But Isolde...I had no choice."

"I know." My fingers tighten around the phone. "Thank you. For getting me out."

"Always." The word carries the weight of a vow. "Don't open the door for anyone. Key's in my pocket."

The line goes dead.

I splash cold water on my face in the bathroom, gingerly cleaning the claiming bite. The wounds have already closed, leaving only angry red punctures.

The door clicks open.

"Isolde?"

I'm across the room before my brain catches up, crashing into Victor's chest. Two days of terror pour out in shuddering sobs. He lifts me effortlessly, settling on the edge of the bed with me in his lap. His hands stroke my back in slow circles.

"Breathe, little wolf. You're safe now."

When the storm passes, he thumbs away my tears, pressing kisses to each damp eyelid. The tissue box appears like magic.

"Better?"

I nod into his shoulder. The mate bond hums between us, stronger now with his mark in my skin.

Victor's lips quirk. "I can hear you thinking, you know." His palm settles over my growling stomach. "But first—food."

The takeout bags reveal Italian pasta, tacos, and barbecue ribs. Victor shrugs at my raised eyebrow. "Didn't know what you'd want."

"Perfect."

He watches me devour three tacos before speaking.

"I marked you during the fight. Challenged the others." His knuckles whiten around a water bottle. "Rik—Adrian—offered reinforcements, but I wanted you awake first. After everything..."

The unspoken question hangs between us.

I reach across the table, threading our fingers together. "Tell Adrian we're coming."

The corner of his mouth lifts. "Eat first, little wolf. Then we run."

###Chapter 0321

"Why is there still a target on your back?" I zero in on the most crucial detail, my stomach twisting. I thought his mark was supposed to end the chase.

His jaw tightens. "I slaughtered their Alpha. Probably took out his Beta or Gamma too. Then I had the audacity to claim the Guardian they'd been hunting for a week." A dark chuckle escapes him. "Now, the only way to get to you is through me—by killing me first."

My pulse spikes. "Are they following us right now?" Gods, I can't keep running—

"No." He shakes his head. "They'll have retreated to regroup. But we shouldn't linger now that you're awake. We move east as soon as you're ready."

"Where are we exactly?"

"About a day's ride from the Missouri border." His fingers tap the map between us. "From there, another few days to North Georgia—our final stop. We can rest each night or push straight through. Your call."

I finish my meal, savoring the unfamiliar fullness in my belly. "Can I sleep on it? We'll leave tomorrow, but..." I hesitate. "One more night in a real bed. Please."

"Whatever you need."

Right now? A scalding shower. I stand, then freeze. "Earlier—you said you could feel my confusion through the bond. What did you mean?"

His gaze burns into me. "The mark lets me feel your emotions. Hear your thoughts. Unless you consciously block me."

I whirl to face him fully. He can—what?

A smirk tugs at his lips. "Yes, even that panicked voice in your head. It's... loud."

"How?"

"Mate bonds work the same way as pack links. Didn't your parents explain?"

"They were in a pack. We're not." My breath comes faster.

Victor rises, closing the distance between us. His hands settle on my shoulders. "Mated pairs share this connection regardless of pack ties. If you'd had your wolf when you left your mother, you could've still mind-linked her."

"Then why can't I hear you?"

His thumb brushes my mating mark. "You haven't claimed me yet. When you do, the bond becomes reciprocal."

"So I need to mark you?"

His eyes darken. "It'll deepen our connection. What you feel for me now? That intensity will multiply." He searches my face. "I won't rush you. But understand—this bond is one-sided until you claim me too."

"Meaning?"

"If you die, it could destroy me. But if I die?" He shrugs. "You'd grieve, but survive."

"That's not fair."

"Fair doesn't matter." His voice drops to a growl. "Finding you was a miracle I never expected. I'll carry this risk until you're ready."

I rise onto my toes, pressing my lips to his. "Thank you. For saving me. For your patience." The words taste foreign but true. "I'm not there yet, but... this means something."

"You're my mate." His hands frame my face. "I love you. No conditions. No expiration date."

I retreat to the shower, his confession echoing in my skull. Victor Blackwood just handed me his heart—and the power to shatter it.

The water scalds my skin, but it can't burn away the truth:

I have a choice to make.

And it terrifies me.

###Chapter 0322

I watch Isolde head to the shower, listening to the water start running. Thank the Moon Goddess she's finally awake. When I called Adrian earlier, he confirmed that females often lose consciousness during marking, though neither he nor Sebastian experienced that with their Guardians. But then again, their mates weren't exhausted, starving, and emotionally shattered when they were claimed.

I'm relieved she doesn't hate me. Dark memories resurfaced—times when I tried to force the bond on Evelyn. Different circumstances, but the fear is the same. I can't lose Isolde. I meant every word when I said I never expected a fated mate. After everything I've done, I didn't think I deserved one. The Goddess works in mysterious ways.

While she showers, I tidy up. She takes longer than usual—avoiding me or just enjoying the water, I'm not sure.

When she finally emerges, I grab my things and slip into the bathroom. My wardrobe was never extensive, and this journey has left me with even less. I'll need to figure out finances soon—clothes, supplies, everything.

My plan is to take Isolde to the Obsidian Moon Pack lands. I started rebuilding after my failed attempt with Evelyn. It's rough, but it's become a refuge for rogues seeking redemption.

I called myself their Alpha, and they followed. Many died in the battle against Blackthorn Pack when I took Evelyn. Those who acted like true rogues—violent, uncontrollable—were exiled or killed. The ones who remain? Fighters. Wolves desperate for a pack.

Too many rogues are alone because of cruel Alphas. Isolde's story, mine—they're not unique. I built a place for those who wanted safety, a home.

I haven't been back in years. After Evelyn was rescued, I ran. Then Sebastian caught me, held me captive for six months. Now I've been protecting Isolde. But it's time to return. Time for her to see what awaits if she accepts the bond. All I can offer is a broken pack full of misfits.

I step out of the shower, pulling on shorts. Feeling Isolde's emotions soothes Magnus, but I want more. I want her to choose me, to complete the bond. I want a partner to help rebuild something worthy.

When I leave the bathroom, she's already in bed. Not wanting to assume, I drag the chairs together, preparing to sleep there.

"What are you doing?" Isolde asks.

"Getting comfortable."

She frowns. "In the chairs?"

I glance down. Yeah, they look about as comfortable as a pile of rocks.

"I told you I can't sleep unless you're beside me." She pats the mattress. "Unless you don't want to."

###Chapter 0323

I move closer to the bed. "I'd like to. Wasn't sure if you'd be okay with it."

Her lips curve slightly. "We're already partially bonded, aren't we? You'll sleep better next to me."

"Much better."

"Good. Get in."

I slide under the covers beside her, and she instantly presses against me. A deep exhale escapes me—the first real moment of peace I've felt in weeks.

"Wish I could've marked you differently. Not like that."

Her fingers trace idle patterns on my chest. "You saved me from those wolves. Their Alpha alone tells me I'd be suffering in that pack."

My arms tighten around her. Magnus snarls in my mind at the thought of another male trying to claim our mate.

She presses her palm flat over my heart. "Easy, Magnus. I'm safe because of you and Victor. Rest now."

"Sweet?" I huff a laugh. Magnus has been called vicious, relentless—never sweet.

I feel her smile against my skin. "He's gentle with Aurora. She adores him."

Magnus's growl shifts to a contented rumble, and Isolde giggles. "Told you."

"What about me?" I tease, nudging her chin up. "Do I get a compliment?"

Am I shamelessly fishing? Absolutely. Jealous that my wolf gets her affection so easily? Pathetically so.

Her gaze meets mine. "You're fierce. Protective. Everything I need."

I capture her lips in a slow kiss. "Thank you."

When she doesn't pull away, I deepen the contact. Suddenly I'm rolling us over, caging her beneath me. My mouth moves hungrily over hers, one hand bracing my weight while the other tangles in her hair.

A sharp nip at her lower lip makes her gasp. I take advantage, tasting the cherry sweetness of her mouth. Her moan sends fire straight through me.

Her nails scrape down my back—blissful pain. Through the bond, I feel her hesitation warring with desire, her scent intoxicating as it wraps around us.

My lips trail down her throat, lingering at my mark. Her breath hitches as her hips lift against me, seeking friction.

I pull back just enough to see her flushed face. Embarrassment flickers through the bond as she starts to lower her legs.

"Don't." My hand slides up her thigh, watching for any resistance. Finding none, I push her nightshirt up, palming her breast. Her nipple pebbles instantly under my touch.

A whimper escapes her when I tug gently. "Want to pleasure you. Let me?"

Her eyes open, dark with need. "Yes."

I strip the shirt away, taking my time exploring her body. When my mouth closes over one peak, her back arches beautifully. The sounds she makes have me painfully hard.

Looking down at her—lips parted, lost in sensation—I commit this sight to memory. This is how my mate should always look.

###Chapter 0324

My lips trail to her other peak, lavishing it with the same devotion. My fingers glide downward, slipping beneath the thin fabric of her panties. The heat radiating from her core makes my breath hitch. She's drenched—completely soaked because of me. The knowledge sends a primal satisfaction coursing through my veins.

I tease her, dragging a single finger through her slick folds before circling her swollen clit. Her hips jerk violently, a sharp gasp escaping her lips. I keep the pressure steady, relishing every whimper that spills from her mouth.

With a final nip at her nipple, I release it, trailing kisses down her trembling stomach. My tongue traces every inch of her skin, memorizing her taste. When I reach the waistband of her panties, I grip them with my teeth and tug them down slowly.

Her wide, darkened eyes meet mine as I toss the fabric aside. I hook one of her legs over my shoulder, spreading her wider. Then, without breaking eye contact, I lower my mouth to her core.

The first lick has her arching off the bed. She tastes divine—sweet and intoxicating. A possessive growl rumbles in my chest as I devour her, my tongue swirling around her clit in slow, deliberate circles.

Her fingers tangle in my hair, urging me closer. I slip a finger inside her, groaning at how tight she is. Her walls clench around me, desperate for more. I add a second finger, curling them just right—

Her breath hitches.

I suck her clit hard between my lips, and she shatters.

Her scream echoes through the room as her body convulses beneath me. The force of her climax sends me over the edge too, my own release crashing over me like a tidal wave.

I let her ride it out, my fingers still buried deep inside her as her muscles flutter around me. When I finally pull back, my face is glistening with her arousal.

I press a kiss to her inner thigh before crawling back up her body. My lips find hers, and I let her taste herself on my tongue.


"You're delicious," I murmur against her lips. "I'm going to clean up. Then we'll sleep."

She nods, already half-asleep.

I wash up quickly, stripping off my shorts before returning to find her curled naked under the sheets. I slide in behind her, pulling her tight against my chest.

Within moments, her breathing evens out.

I follow her into the darkness, my arms locked around her.

###Chapter 0325

I stir awake slowly, enveloped in warmth and the rich aroma of sandalwood. It's been ages since I've felt this utterly at peace.

Reality filters in gradually. First realization - I'm completely bare beneath the sheets. Second - there's a muscular arm possessively wrapped around my waist, a large hand cupping my breast. Third - the hard, unmistakable evidence of Victor's arousal pressing against my backside.

I attempt to wriggle free, but his grip tightens instantly. His lips brush my shoulder blade, sending shivers down my spine.

"Stay," he murmurs, his voice gravelly with sleep. "Five more minutes."

"Victor." My protest comes out embarrassingly breathless.

"Mmm." He nuzzles closer, trailing kisses up the column of my neck. My skin erupts in goosebumps everywhere his lips touch.

"I'm not wearing anything," I point out needlessly.

"You were dead asleep when I finished showering," he rumbles against my skin. "Didn't have the heart to wake you." His breath fans across my ear, making me shiver.

"You're naked too."

"Sweetheart," he chuckles darkly, "after what we did last night, there's not an inch of you I haven't worshipped. And I grew up among shifters - nudity doesn't faze me."

Heat floods my cheeks. What felt natural in the darkness now feels scandalous in daylight.

His teeth graze my shoulder playfully. "I can smell your embarrassment, darling. We're mates. The bond may not be sealed yet, but you and your wolf are already drawn to me and Louis. This is how the Moon Goddess intended it."

"I should shower," I say quickly. "Don't we have a bus to catch?"

He lifts his head, golden eyes searching mine. "You sure you're up for traveling today?"

I meet his gaze over my shoulder. The concern in his expression makes my heart flutter. "Actually, I feel amazing," I admit.

His smug grin tells me everything. The arrogant bastard knows exactly how good he made me feel. And much as I hate to admit it, my body feels deliciously loose and satisfied.

I lean up to peck his lips, but he captures my mouth in a searing kiss that leaves me dizzy. His tongue tangles with mine as I melt against him, a soft moan escaping my throat.

When he finally pulls away, he bumps his nose against mine affectionately. "Go shower. I'll grab breakfast and check the bus times."

Sliding out of bed, I feel his heated gaze tracking my every move. I pause at the bathroom door, glancing back. "What?"

Propped on one elbow with the sheet barely covering his hips, his eyes make a slow, appreciative journey down my body. "Just memorizing the view," he purrs.

I throw him a smirk over my shoulder, putting extra sway in my hips as I enter the bathroom. His answering wolf whistle makes me laugh aloud.

The knowledge that I can affect a man like Victor so profoundly is intoxicating.

When I emerge from the shower, the bed is empty. I dress quickly, and moments later Victor returns laden with food - egg sandwiches, strong coffee, and several bottles of water.

"Drink up," he orders, setting everything down. "Take whatever you want. Wasn't sure how you take your coffee, so I got cream and sugar." He dumps a handful of condiments and napkins onto the table between us.

###Chapter 0326

I gulp down half the water bottle in one breath, then attack the food. "What's next?"

"There's a bus at 1 pm heading toward Montgomery, Alabama. We'll stop in a small town just past Montgomery tomorrow, rest for the night, then move toward Nashville the following day. After another night there, we'll push toward home. At this pace, we'll reach northern Georgia by week's end. Two nights in proper beds with real meals. I already called Adrian and filled him in. I'll update him again when we stop outside Montgomery."

After breakfast, Victor showers. We check out and return to the bus station. His eyes never stop scanning, watching for anything out of place. The ride toward Montgomery is long but quiet. I use the time to learn more about where we're going—and about the man who's now my mate.

"We're heading to my old territory—the Obsidian Moon Pack. I'd begun rebuilding it, offering sanctuary to wolves with nowhere else to go. You'd be surprised how many have stories like ours, Isolde. The borders were never empty for long."

"Are they still there now?" I ask, unsure what awaits us.

"Honestly? I don't know. It's been nearly a year. I left my Beta in charge when I stepped away as acting Alpha. We'll find out when we arrive."

We reach the town and secure a hotel room. A quick wash removes the grime of travel before we head out for dinner. Victor seems lighter after speaking with Alpha Adrian, hearing the red wolves have spread word that I'm marked and off-limits.

The steakhouse we choose feels surreal—the most normal night I've had since losing my mother. We talk. We laugh. With each passing hour, I see more of who Victor truly is: a protector. Had our paths crossed earlier, he would've sheltered my mother and me just as he does every lost soul he finds. He'd never call them strays, but that's what we were—wolves without a pack, without roots.

He doesn't realize he gives people what they've lost: safety. Belonging.

To him, it's simply what should be done. What he wished someone had done for a lone child years ago.

Hand in hand, we walk back to our room. At the door, he turns. "Tired?"

I shake my head.

He grabs the remote and sits on the bed, TV flickering to life. "Anything you want to watch?"

I have other ideas. Instinct guides me as I climb onto the bed—not beside him, but straddling his hips. My palms press against his chest as he looks up, that half-smile playing on his lips. "Something on your mind, Isolde?"

I nod. "You made me feel incredible the other night." My hands trail lower. "Now it's my turn."

###Chapter 0327

Blackthorn Pack Territory – Evelyn’s POV

The scent of pine needles crushed beneath my boots as I sprinted through the forest. Selene, my wolf spirit, growled a warning.

"We’re being followed."

I skidded to a halt, spinning to face the shadows. A low laugh echoed between the trees.

"Did you really think you could outrun me, little Guardian?" Victor Blackwood stepped into the moonlight, his silver eyes gleaming.

My pulse spiked.

He shouldn’t be here. Not after what he’d done.

Victor tilted his head, studying me like prey. "You’ve gotten faster. But not fast enough."

Before I could react, he lunged.

Celestia Restaurant – Adrian’s POV

The steak knife slipped from my grip as a sharp pain lanced through my chest.

Evelyn.

Magnus, my wolf spirit, snarled. "She’s in danger."

I was halfway to the door when Nathaniel blocked my path. "Alpha, the alliance meeting—"

"Move." The command ripped from my throat, laced with alpha power.

The warriors scattered.

I shifted mid-stride, bones cracking, fur erupting across my skin. The last thing I heard was Seraphina’s gasp before I exploded into the night.

Cliffside Overlook – Victor’s POV

Her back hit the cliff edge, loose gravel skittering into the abyss below.

Evelyn’s breath came in ragged bursts, but defiance burned in her gaze. "You won’t win."

I smirked. "Already have."

Then the howl came—long, furious, vibrating with alpha rage.

Adrian had found us.

Game on.

###Chapter 0328

My body responds instantly as Isolde's fingers trace over my abdomen, slipping beneath the waistband of my shorts. The heat between us is undeniable, but I need to be certain she understands what she's asking for.

"What did you have in mind?" My voice is rough as her hands glide up under my shirt, exploring every inch of my chest. The fabric rides up, and I yank it off, tossing it aside.

Her gaze devours me, dark with hunger, before meeting my eyes. "I'm not entirely sure."

"You can have whatever you want—but only if you're comfortable." My fingers tighten on her hips. "There are no limits with you, Isolde. I'm yours."

She leans in, capturing my lips, and I let her take the lead. It's agony holding back when every instinct—and Magnus—demands I complete the bond. I crave burying myself inside her warmth, marking her throat with my teeth. But not yet. Not until I feel her fangs sink into me in return.

My hands slide up her thighs, gripping her hips as she rocks against me. The friction is maddening. One of her hands braces on my shoulder, the other tangles in my hair as she deepens the kiss, claiming control.

When her mouth trails down my neck, I groan as her teeth graze my marking spot. My cock jerks beneath her, and she smirks before continuing her path down my chest. Little bites mark my skin—her way of branding me—until she reaches my shorts.

Mimicking my earlier move, she tugs them down with her teeth, sliding off the bed to strip them completely. Now it's just my boxers separating us.

"Your turn." My voice is thick with need. "Take it all off."

She stands, watching me. "Do you want that?"

"Yes." The word comes out as a growl. My eyes are black with hunger.

Slowly, she pulls her shirt over her head. I lick my lips, drinking in the sight of her. Never have I wanted anyone more.

+15 BONDS

Her bra follows, pooling at her feet. My gaze drops to her perfect breasts—small, perky, utterly flawless to me.

Then she turns, bending to peel off her shorts, giving me a view of her incredible ass. Gods, I want to bite those curves. And soon, I will.

When she faces me again, hesitation flickers in her eyes. Doubt creeps in. "Come here," I command, crooking a finger.

She crawls back over me, unintentionally seductive. The moment she's close, I haul her onto my lap. The heat of her presses against my cock, separated only by thin fabric. It won't take much to push me over the edge.

"What's wrong?" I brush my lips along her jaw.

"I want to please you... but I don't know how."

I grind up against her. "Feel how much I want you?" My voice is raw. "You already are." She needs to know this is about her comfort—not just my desire.

###Chapter 0329

My body presses against hers, my cock sliding through her slick heat. A deep groan escapes me as my eyes flutter shut. "You feel incredible, Isolde. I can't take you yet—not until you're ready. But when that day comes, I'll mark you properly."

Her sweet voice sends another wave of desire through me. "I could use my mouth like you did."

My jaw clenches. Just the thought of her lips wrapped around me threatens to undo me completely.

"Have you ever done that before, love?" I rasp.

"No," she admits, but there's no hesitation in her tone. "But I want to."

I grit my teeth. If I survive this without exploding the second she touches me, it'll be a miracle.

"Do you want me to guide you?"

"Yes."

I pull her into a searing kiss before settling back. "Take off my boxers. Find a comfortable position between my legs."

She obeys, her gaze flickering between my cock and my face.

"Wrap your hand around me," I instruct. "Stroke me slowly."

Her fingers close around me, and I nearly lose it right then. My entire body tenses as pleasure shoots through me.

"Now lick me," I growl. "Then take just the head into your mouth."

She does, and I swear I see stars. "Fuck, that's good. So good. Take more of me in, use your lips—suck gently as you move."

I'm barely holding on. Her warm mouth, the way she hollows her cheeks—it's too much.

A sharp hiss escapes me when her teeth graze me. "Careful with your teeth, sweetheart."

She pulls back immediately, worry in her eyes. "Did I hurt you?"

"Just be gentle," I reassure her. "That part doesn't like pain."

She nods and takes me back into her mouth, sucking harder this time. My fingers tangle in her hair as I fight for control.

"Listen to me," I manage. "When I say stop, you need to pull away. I won't come in your mouth unless you want me to."

But she doesn't slow down. If anything, she takes me deeper, her throat opening around me.

"God, Isolde—yes—just like that—"

My balls tighten. I'm seconds away. "Stop—I'm close—"

She doesn't. Instead, she swallows me whole.

My hips jerk forward as my release tears through me. A feral growl rips from my chest as I spill down her throat. She takes every drop before finally pulling away, licking me clean with a satisfied smirk.

"Fuck," I pant. "That was unbelievable."

Her smile widens. "I'm glad you enjoyed it."

I drag her up my body, crushing my mouth to hers. "Enjoyed doesn't begin to cover it. You're perfect, my mate."

Her giggle turns into a gasp when I flip us over. By the time I'm done with her, she's screaming my name. Only when she's boneless and sated do I curl around her, both of us drifting into contented sleep.

###Chapter 0330

Waking up in Victor's arms is becoming my new addiction. The warmth, the security, the way his body molds perfectly against mine—it's everything I never knew I needed. Every moment with him deepens our connection, both emotionally and physically.

The physical part? Mind-blowing. I always heard stories about the mate bond intensifying pleasure, but nothing prepared me for this. If this is how it feels before completing the bond, I can't fathom how much more intense it'll be after.

This morning, I don't hesitate to press myself back against him, relishing the way his body responds instantly. His sleepy growl vibrates against my skin as I wiggle closer, teasing the hard length pressed against my back.

"Mmm, what are you up to, little wolf?" His voice is rough with sleep, sending shivers down my spine.

"Just enjoying my favorite pillow." I smirk, grinding against him deliberately.

In one swift motion, he flips me onto my back, pinning me beneath him. His amber eyes darken with desire as he nips at my throat. "We have a bus to catch soon," he murmurs against my skin, though his hands are already roaming. "One more stop, then we're home. Or what used to be home for me."

I arch into his touch, emboldened by the morning light. Aurora's voice purrs in my mind, 'Stop teasing him unless you plan to follow through.'

Challenge accepted.

Sliding off the bed, I stand just out of reach, letting the sheet pool at my feet. "Come shower with me, old man."

Victor moves faster than I can blink. One second I'm standing there, the next I'm airborne as he tosses me over his shoulder. I shriek with laughter as he carries me effortlessly to the bathroom.

"Old man?" He growls, setting me down under the spray. "Did I seem old when you were screaming my name last night?"

I bite my lip, shaking my head.

"Need a reminder of how young and capable I am?" His hands slide down my hips.

"Maybe."

He proceeds to remind me—three times—before we even finish washing up.

The next two days pass in a blur of roadside diners and tangled sheets. We push through wolf territory without stopping, finally reaching a rundown motel on Birmingham's outskirts.

Exhausted, we collapse onto the bed after showering. Victor traces circles on my bare shoulder as we talk about his makeshift pack. "They're survivors," he says. "Loyal to a fault, but they need structure. Leadership."

I study his profile. He claims he's not a true Alpha, but everything about him screams leadership—the way he commands respect, protects fiercely, thinks strategically.

My canines pricked last night when I kissed his neck, the urge to mark him nearly overwhelming. Victor noticed but didn't push, even though I know he's waiting for me to take that final step.

Two more days of travel lie ahead. As much as I'm enjoying our time together, I'm eager to see this pack he's gathered. To walk the lands we might rebuild together.

Victor may not believe he's Alpha material, but I see the truth. With my knowledge and his instincts, we could build something extraordinary.

Aurora's voice rings clear in my mind: 'Stop overthinking. He's ours. The pack will be too.'

I curl into Victor's side, breathing in his scent. For the first time in years, the future doesn't just look bearable—it looks bright.

###Chapter 0331

The final stretch of our journey winds through the Cascade Range. The breathtaking scenery fills me with joy as we return to the Sierra Madre mountains. At the last bus stop, we gather our belongings and step out into the crisp mountain air.

Victor glances at me. "The pack territory is roughly two hours away in wolf form."

"Perfect. Aurora has been itching to run."

We grab a quick meal before disappearing into the dense forest. Shifting forms, I follow Victor as he sets a steady pace. In this form, the world sharpens—the rushing streams, the towering pines, the raw majesty of the mountains.

The scent of other wolves hits me seconds before Magnus howls our arrival. Almost instantly, patrol wolves block our path, guarding their borders. My pulse quickens. This could mean two things—either the pack has thrived in Victor's absence, or someone else has seized control.

Victor shifts back, standing tall before the patrol. "Who leads here?"

One wolf steps forward, shifting into human form. His eyes flicker between us. "I do."

His gaze lingers on me. "Guardian." He dips his head toward Aurora. "I'm Leopold. How may I assist you?"

"Is Donovan still serving as Beta?" Victor asks.

Leopold's eyes narrow slightly. "He is."

"Tell him Victor has returned."

"Alpha?" Leopold's voice wavers.

"Yes."

Leopold bows his head. "We heard rumors you were held captive by a rival pack. We didn’t know you’d escaped."

"I was freed," Victor corrects. "And I found my mate." He gestures to me.

Leopold hesitates. "May I ask which Guardian this is?"

"My mate is Isolde. Her wolf is Aurora. Grant Sinclair fell in battle during the vampire war, and his Guardian spirit passed to them."

"An honor to meet you, Aurora. Isolde." Leopold's tone is respectful. The other wolves lower their heads in deference—to Victor, to Aurora.

"We'll escort you to the packhouse, Alpha. The pack will rejoice at your return."

They shift, and we race toward the heart of the territory.

It's been years since I've stepped onto pack lands. The familiarity is unsettling. As we near the packhouse, howls erupt. Wolves sprint from every direction, joining our run, their excited yips blending with cheers from those in human form. The air thrums with pure joy—no fear, no tension. Just unrestrained happiness at their Alpha's homecoming.

At the packhouse, a man stands waiting. His scent marks him as an Alpha, but something's wrong.

He has no wolf, Aurora murmurs.

Like I once was?

Worse. His wolf isn’t dormant—it’s gone. I sense nothing in him.

This must be Donovan. Victor mentioned his Beta was a wolfless Alpha.

Victor shifts, pulling on shorts before striding forward. "Alpha," Donovan says, clasping his forearm. They embrace roughly, thumping each other’s backs.

The crowd swells. Shifting here feels too exposed, but staying in wolf form means silence. I begin the change—

Victor is there before I finish, draping one of his shirts over me.

"And you’ve brought a Guardian," Donovan observes, stepping closer. "Welcome." His presence is commanding yet disarming—exactly the kind of Beta an Alpha would trust.

"You must be Donovan." I extend my hand.

"Donovan, this is Isolde. My mate. My fated mate," Victor emphasizes. "Isolde, meet Donovan."

Before I can respond, a shriek cuts through the air. A woman barrels toward Victor, leaping into his arms, legs locking around his waist. Her lips crash against his.

Pain lances through my chest—

Aurora moves.

She tears the woman off Victor and hurls her across the yard.

"Mine!" Aurora snarls, standing between Victor and the sprawled woman.

Victor's hands settle on my hips from behind. "Easy, Isolde."

But Aurora isn’t listening.

The woman scrambles up, glaring. "I don’t see a mark on his neck. He’s not yours."

Aurora whirls—

Victor’s stunned face flashes in my vision—

Her fangs sink into his neck.

###Chapter 0332

I never imagined in my wildest dreams that Giselle would throw herself into my arms as if we were star-crossed lovers reunited. Sure, there was a brief moment over a year ago when we were involved, but that chapter closed long ago.

Anger flares inside me. Isolde must have felt it when Giselle kissed me. Before I can even react, Isolde sends her flying across the room, her fury and possessiveness slicing through our bond like a blade. A thrill shoots through me at her reaction. We’ve grown closer during our time on the run, but she’s never outright claimed me—until now.

I step forward, needing to soothe her. Her aura pulses violently around her, crackling with rage. I open my mouth to reassure her that Giselle means nothing to me, but of course, Giselle can’t keep quiet. You’d think after surviving as a rogue for so long, she’d have better instincts for self-preservation.

Then Isolde turns, and for a split second, I see Aurora’s presence flicker in her eyes before she sinks her canines into my marking spot.

The moment her teeth pierce my skin, power explodes through me like nothing I’ve ever felt before. A roar tears from my throat as raw energy surges through my veins. One arm locks around Isolde, crushing her against me, while the other cradles her head as Aurora pumps venom into my flesh, altering my scent to carry hers.

Through the bond, I feel her burning need to declare to everyone here that I belong to her. She’s staking her claim—publicly, irrevocably.

Marking usually happens during mating for a reason. Having the most intense orgasm of my life in front of pack members I haven’t seen in over a year was not on my agenda. Add this insane power surge coursing through me, and I desperately wish we were in a bedroom instead of standing in the middle of the packhouse.

But I wouldn’t change a single second of it.

She marked me. She made me hers, in front of everyone. A deep, unshakable sense of belonging floods me, stronger than anything I’ve ever known.

The bond, already intensified when I marked her, snaps into place with unbreakable force. Tonight, we’ll complete the mating process, and after that, nothing will ever take her from me.

"Mine." Her voice echoes through our mind link as she continues to pump venom into me.

"Yes, love. I’m yours." I respond just as she finally withdraws her fangs.

Cupping her face, I kiss her deeply, flooding our bond with everything I feel—love, pride, adoration.

"Mine," she murmurs against my lips when I pull back. The room is dead silent. Every wolf heard her.

"From the first second I saw you," I whisper back.

"Victor?" Giselle’s whine cuts through the moment.

I reluctantly tear my gaze from Isolde to glare at her.

"Giselle, meet my mate—your future Luna, Isolde."

Isolde turns, but I keep my arm locked around her waist, holding her in place. If she steps away now, the evidence of what just happened will be on full display. Mated pairs might understand, but I don’t need the pups and unmated wolves witnessing this.

"Isolde, this is Giselle. She’s a pack member."

Isolde’s voice drops low, layered with Aurora’s growl. "Giselle, if you ever touch my mate again, you’ll face the wrath of an Alpha female and a Guardian. Are we clear?"

Giselle’s eyes dart to me, silently pleading for intervention. But I stay silent. Isolde is my mate—my future Luna. I won’t undermine her authority.

Leopold steps forward, ever the diplomat. "Alpha, perhaps you and Luna would like to freshen up after your journey. Your room is ready."

"Thanks, Leopold." I press a kiss to Isolde’s hair. "Come on, love. Let’s go."

As we turn to leave, Leopold hesitates. "Alpha… you’re staying, right?"

I meet his gaze steadily. "Yes. I’m not going anywhere."

###Chapter 0333

"Perfect. We'll talk once you're settled."

I nod. There's so much to discuss, but first I need to speak with Isolde. And I have to call Adrian to let him know we arrived safely.

I lead Isolde upstairs to my old room. It's modest, like everything else in this pack that still needs rebuilding. The moment we step inside, she turns to me.

"I'm sorry. Aurora took control and I know we didn't plan this..."

I silence her with a kiss, pouring all my joy into it. When I pull back, I meet her worried gaze. "Not sorry. Not even a little. Would I have preferred privacy? Absolutely. But you claiming me in front of the entire pack?" I grin. "That was the hottest thing I've ever experienced."

"You're not angry?"

"About the mark? Or about the audience?"

"About marking you at all. Because that she-wolf—" Her lip curls in a snarl. "—dared touch what's mine."

"I don't care about your reasons. I'm glad you did it." My fingers trace her jaw. "I told you—with you, there are no limits. I'm yours, Isolde. Yours and Aurora's."

I brush my lips against her nose. "Now I need to wash off the mess you made marking me." I step back with a smirk. "But tonight? Tonight I'll claim you in every way possible. Are you ready for that?"

"Yes, Alpha." Her coy smile sends heat straight through me.

A growl rips from my throat as I close the distance between us, capturing her mouth in a searing kiss. "Hearing you say that makes me feel more like an Alpha than anything else. Most days, I still feel like an impostor."

I turn toward the bathroom, checking for towels.

"You're more of an Alpha than you realize, Victor. You might not see it, but everyone else does." Isolde follows me as I start the shower.

The hot water cascades over my shoulders. I feel her step in behind me. "You've built something incredible here. A sanctuary for people like us—those who never had a safe place to rebuild. That's what makes you a true Alpha. A good one." Her hands glide over my back.

I turn to face her. "I know this isn't the future you imagined. But can you see yourself building this life with me? There's so much work ahead, but together... I believe we could create something extraordinary."

"I want that life with you, Victor. A haven for others like us—the lost, the broken, those who need protection."

I rest my forehead against hers. "How did I get so lucky to have you as my mate?"

She pulls back slightly. "Because I'm a Guardian?"

I shake my head. "No. Honestly, I wouldn't care if you were an omega or even human. Hell, I thought you were human when we met, and I was already falling for you. Alpha Sebastian's Beta is mated to a human, and from what I hear, she's remarkable. It's not about your gifts—though I do believe only someone extraordinary could become a Guardian. It's about who you are, Isolde. You were born an Alpha female, chosen as a Guardian, yet you're willing to roll up your sleeves and help me build a pack from nothing."

She steps closer, wrapping her arms around my waist. "I'm not naive enough to think this will be easy. We both have so much to learn about leading a pack. But together? I believe we can do anything."

###Chapter 0334

The moment we step out of the shower, Victor immediately calls Alpha Adrian. I hear the urgency in his voice, but I make him postpone the meeting. This place still feels foreign to me, and I'm not prepared to face those two Alphas yet. They're looking at me with Guardian expectations shining in their eyes, and that's a weight I can't shoulder right now.

Victor's fingers intertwine with mine as we go searching for Leopold. We find his office door slightly ajar, raised voices spilling into the hallway.

"This pack belongs to me now, regardless of his return!" A stranger's voice booms.

Leopold's response comes sharp and clear. "I've told you before - you hold no authority here. You don't make the rules, and I won't step aside while you destroy everything we've built." His voice doesn't waver. Victor chose well when appointing him Beta, wolf or not.

Victor strides in without knocking. "Problem?" His single word carries authority.

I scan the room quickly. Leopold stands firm behind his desk while three men loom over him in clear intimidation. Their leader whips around to face Victor.

"You've been absent too long. The Alpha title no longer belongs to you," the man sneers.

Victor's aura erupts before he even speaks. Again, I question whether Beta blood truly runs through his veins. His dominance surpasses any Beta I've encountered, and I've met plenty during my childhood.

The challenger visibly flinches under Victor's power. Victor closes the distance between them in two strides, invading the man's personal space. "If this is your formal challenge for Alpha position, I'll gladly accept." His quiet tone holds deadly promise.

The man's gaze flicks to me. "Brave words from someone hiding behind a Guardian."

I laugh sharply. "Hide? Look at him - he could snap you in half without breaking a sweat." My words leave no doubt about where my confidence lies.

Victor cocks his head. "Your move." The physical contrast between them couldn't be more obvious. Victor towers over the man, his shoulders nearly twice as broad, every inch of him hardened muscle. The challenger looks like he's never trained a day in his life.

"Fine." The man jerks his chin at his companions. "Let's go." As he passes Victor, he attempts a shoulder check that backfires spectacularly when Victor doesn't budge an inch. The impact visibly jars the challenger instead.

I shut the door behind them. Leopold collapses into his chair, dragging both hands down his face. "This is what I needed to discuss with you," he tells Victor.

Victor pulls out a chair for me before taking the seat beside me. "Explain."

"Rumors have been spreading about multiple wolves preparing to challenge for Alpha. I've managed to maintain order while you were gone, but without a wolf..." Leopold shakes his head. "Alistair isn't the only one scheming."

"How many?" Victor's voice turns grim.

"Between three and five, possibly more. Though some might back down now that you've returned."

Victor considers this. "Arrange formal challenges for anyone contesting my right as Alpha."

"Victor." My protest comes automatically. This isn't how I envisioned our first days together.

He turns to me. "It's the only way to establish order. Uncertainty in the hierarchy breeds chaos. Once we settle this, we can focus on rebuilding properly." His eyes gleam with determination. "This time, we'll make it official - Alpha, Luna, and Beta ceremonies with every pack member pledging loyalty. I intend to formalize this pack completely. There are matters I need to discuss with Alpha Adrian and Alpha Sebastian about making that happen."

###Chapter 0335

"Alright, while you deal with the Alpha challenges, I can assess our immediate needs." I turn to Leopold. "How are you managing food and supplies for the pack?"

He exhales sharply. "No proper system exists. Without income, our warriors hunt while the she-wolves maintain vegetable gardens."

"I'll handle finances—that's why I need to speak with Adrian and Sebastian." Victor interjects, then faces me. "We should tour the territory together. I need to evaluate the changes since I left, and you should understand our challenges." His fingers tighten around mine.

I smirk. "Seems we both have battles ahead." Though daunting, the prospect thrums with energy. I bite back my offer about using my savings—now isn't the time.

"How many are we sheltering now?" Victor asks.

Leopold shuffles parchment before extracting one. "Just under three hundred."

Victor's brows lift. "Nearly double when I departed."

"Exiles with nowhere else go." Leopold's shoulders slump. "Word spreads—new arrivals beg sanctuary daily. I document them manually, but we desperately need digital records. The paperwork drowns me."

"Requiring an assistant?" I probe.

His laugh holds bitterness. "What I need is a Beta female mate. Unlikely without a wolf."

"Listen." I lean forward. "My wolf emerged at eighteen—months ago. I was scraping by in a diner before becoming Guardian, mating an Alpha, and stepping into Luna duties overnight. You've single-handedly led this pack for a year. That proves your worth—wolf or not. She'll find you."

A wistful smile flickers before he redirects. "I can give that tour now. I'll announce challenges for Alpha position—arrange them this week."

We rise. "Start tomorrow," Victor orders.

Leopold arches a brow. "Certain? The mate bond ceremony tonight might... disrupt your rest."

Victor's gaze smolders at me, and heat floods my cheeks at the implication. "Fine. Schedule it for the day after," he amends.

Leopold's lips twitch. "As you command, Alpha."

###Chapter 336

The urge to take my mate upstairs and complete our bond is overwhelming, but duty calls. The pack lands need my attention. I know there's much work to be done, though I hope progress has been made in my absence.

We don't linger in the packhouse. I'd started repairs before bringing Evelyn here, but it seems little has changed. As we step outside, Leopold gestures toward the construction sites.

"We're recycling concrete blocks from the crumbling structures to build homes for new families." He points to another cluster of houses. "Those had solid foundations, so we're just renovating them."

"How do you track occupancy?"

He rubs his neck sheepishly. "More paperwork. I try to keep count of families and available homes. People don't mind working when housing's the reward, but we've run out of salvageable buildings. Now we're cutting timber to meet demand."

The pack bustles with activity. Some dismantle unstable structures while others haul usable materials to construction sites. Near the tree line, fresh stumps mark where we've harvested lumber.

"Those trees became building materials?" I ask.

Leopold nods. "Not ideal, but necessary. Supplies were running low."

The financial burden weighs on me. While our people work willingly for shelter, a pack can't survive on labor alone.

We reach a fenced garden where a woman rises from tending plants. "Good afternoon, Alpha. Luna. Beta." She inclines her head respectfully.

Isolde steps forward. "What are you growing here?"

The woman removes her gloves. "Would you like a tour?"

"I'd love that," Isolde says, glancing at me for approval.

"Beatrice," the gardener introduces herself, extending a hand.

Isolde shakes it warmly. "I'm Isolde. This is Adrian."

"Word travels fast," Beatrice smiles. "Call me Bea. Welcome home, Alpha."

Her garden impresses with its variety - tomatoes, peppers, melons, root vegetables, and fruit trees. The scale matches our pack's needs.

"How many tend these crops?" Isolde asks.

"Five of us maintain them daily. During planting and harvest, we recruit more hands. Hunger motivates volunteers, and it's good work for pups."

After thanking Bea, we move on to security. "How are patrols organized?"

Leopold explains the rotation system. "Eight-hour shifts with overlapping meal breaks ensure constant border coverage."

"Any trespassers?"

"Few even know we're here. Most get redirected peacefully. Only a couple required... persuasion." His tone suggests those encounters ended in our favor.

The tour continues, revealing both progress and challenges. My mate's sharp questions show her mind working, though I can't yet decipher her thoughts. Every answer paints a clearer picture of what our pack has become - and what it might yet be.

###Chapter 0337

"What about warrior training?" I demand.

Leopold exhales sharply. "That's been complicated. Most refuse to train under me since I lack a wolf. A few warriors volunteered to lead, but their methods are sloppy compared to yours. Worse, they're the same ones eyeing your Alpha position—they think running training gives them authority."

I freeze mid-step. "You've been completely excluded from warrior training?" This makes no sense. Leopold was raised as an Alpha heir—his expertise is unmatched, wolf or no wolf.

"I train the she-wolves and pups," he admits bitterly. "The Lead Warriors banned females from regular sessions."

The fading sunlight paints the trees gold as we turn toward the packhouse. "Tomorrow, I want patrol schedules reviewed. Once this Alpha challenge nonsense is settled, you and I are taking over training."

Isolde arches a brow. "What about the women?"

A grin tugs at my lips. "I'd pay to watch those she-wolves destroy the warriors. If Leopold's right about their poor skills, his trainees will humiliate them."

Leopold's smirk is downright predatory. "Oh, they will."

The kitchen is understaffed when we arrive, with only a handful scrambling to feed the entire pack.

"Why so few workers?" Isolde asks.

"I haven't had time to hire more," Leopold admits, rubbing his temples. "Between construction, new families arriving, and constant challenges to Victor's authority, it's all I can do to keep this pack from collapsing."

I grip his shoulder. "You've held this pack together single-handedly. But you're not alone anymore."

The relief in his eyes is palpable. "Having you both here... it changes everything."

"I'll handle kitchen staffing tomorrow while you two review patrols," Isolde offers.

We grab plates of food—portions too small for werewolf metabolisms, but better than nothing. As we eat, I study the room. Most seem genuinely pleased at my return, but several clusters glare openly.

Time to end this.

My chair scrapes back as I stand. The room falls silent. "For those who don't know me—I'm Alpha Victor. This is my pack. My Beta informs me some believe they'd make better Alphas." My gaze sweeps the dissenters. "Challenges begin the day after tomorrow. See Beta Leopold to schedule yours."

I emphasize his title deliberately. Some need reminding of his rank.

"What if we win?" a voice calls from the back.

"Standard rules apply—the victor takes the pack."

"Submission or death?" another shouts.

"That's the challenger's choice. I prefer not to kill packmates, but if death is demanded, I'll oblige."

Someone sneers, "What about your Guardian?"

"My mate," I snap, "won't interfere."

After fielding more questions, I finish eating. When Isolde sets down her fork, I take her hand and lead her out.

Tonight, we complete our bond.

###Chapter 0338

The wooden stairs creak beneath our feet as we ascend toward Victor's room. My pulse quickens with each step, and I find myself filling the silence with nervous questions. Though I'm no longer afraid to complete our bond, the unknown still sends shivers down my spine.

Most girls learn about intimacy from their mothers or friends. But my mother was too broken by my father's betrayals to speak of such things. Then she died when I turned sixteen, leaving me with no one to ask. So now, standing on the precipice of this moment, I grasp for distraction.

"Were these always the Alpha's quarters?"

Victor's fingers tighten around mine. "No. The ranked wolves' rooms were originally on the opposite side of the packhouse." His voice darkens. "I couldn't stomach sleeping where my father or Jerome had. So I moved our warriors here and turned the other wing into guest quarters—though after today's revelations, I suspect it's housing displaced families now."

He pushes open the door, revealing our sparse sanctuary. My gaze traces the bare walls, the functional furniture. Victor's arms encircle me from behind, his breath warm against my neck. "Once the pack's finances stabilize, you can redecorate however you—"

I spin in his embrace, pressing a finger to his lips. "I love that we're building this life together. That every choice, every possession will be ours. Not yours. Not mine. Ours."

His nose brushes mine in an affectionate nuzzle. "Do you have any idea how perfect you are, Isolde?"

The tender kiss he gives me melts my apprehension. When he pulls back, his question hangs between us: "Are you ready?"

Suddenly, confidence surges through me. I step back, fingers working the buttons of my blouse. Victor's eyes turn molten as I command, "Take off your clothes."

He obeys without hesitation, stripping with predatory grace. My breath catches at the sight of him—all corded muscle and primal intensity. Aurora purrs approval in my mind as I shed my remaining garments.

When I take his hand and guide it between my thighs, his nostrils flare. "Does this feel like I'm ready, Alpha?"

The honorific ignites something feral in him. His growl vibrates through my core as he withdraws his glistening fingers, sucking them clean with a groan. "Like wild honey," he rasps.

"On your knees."

To my surprise, he drops instantly. I lift one leg over his shoulder, fingers tangling in his dark hair. "Taste me."

He devours me like a man starved, hands gripping my hips with bruising possessiveness. The world narrows to his wicked tongue and the building pressure in my core.

###Chapter 0339

His mouth works magic between my thighs, sending electric shocks through my body. The bond between us pulses with raw emotion, amplifying every sensation. My climax hits me like a storm—sudden, violent, and utterly consuming. My fingers dig into his shoulder, desperate for an anchor as he doesn’t let up.

His hand slips between my legs, two fingers sliding inside me. His tongue slows, matching the deliberate rhythm of his fingers. I whimper, my body trembling as he curls them just right, hitting that sweet spot. When he sucks hard on my clit, my knees buckle.

I scream his name as another orgasm tears through me. His answering growl sends another wave of pleasure crashing over me. My muscles clench around his fingers, my body shuddering uncontrollably.

He pulls his fingers free, gripping my thighs as he lifts me effortlessly. His mouth stays locked on me, relentless, even as he carries me to the bed. The moment my back hits the sheets, his fingers are inside me again, driving me toward another peak.

This time, he doesn’t slow down. His fingers thrust faster, his tongue circling my clit until I’m gasping, writhing, then shattering all over again.

He finally lifts his head, his voice rough with satisfaction. "I love hearing you scream my name, Isolde."

The sound alone makes me clench around nothing.

He drags us up the bed, his body covering mine. I wrap my arms around him, pulling him closer as his mouth claims mine. I taste myself on his tongue, the intimacy of it making my pulse race.

When he pulls back, his forehead rests against mine. His hand moves between us, gripping his length and pressing it against my entrance. "Ready?"

I nod.

He thrusts deep in one smooth motion. The stretch burns, stealing my breath. He kisses me, giving me time to adjust, his body still as I acclimate to him. The pain fades, replaced by a deep, aching need.

He reads me perfectly. He starts slow, but as my hips lift to meet him, his pace quickens. He hooks my leg over his arm, changing the angle, driving deeper.

My nails rake down his back. "Victor." I don’t know if it’s a plea or a demand—only that I need more.

He gives it to me. His thrusts turn punishing, obliterating the line between us. My climax hits me like lightning, my vision whiting out.

"I love you, Isolde."

His fangs sink into my neck, marking me as his. I scream his name, my own fangs piercing his skin in return. His roar of pleasure vibrates through me as he spills inside me, our bond sealing completely.

We don’t pull away until the last waves of pleasure fade. Then, slowly, we withdraw our fangs, licking the marks closed.

I cradle his face in my hands. "I love you too, Victor."

And the bond is complete.

###Chapter 0340

Waking up with my mate curled against me is pure bliss. Her lavender scent wraps around me, and her body molds perfectly to mine. My arm rests possessively around her waist, my hand cupping her breast. She’s flawless in every way.

Last night thrilled me when she embraced her Alpha nature, taking control, demanding what she wanted—until she reached her limit. I knew her confidence would falter when inexperience took over. That’s when I stepped in.

She has no idea what she does to me when she calls me Alpha. Hearing that word from a strong, dominant woman is intoxicating. From my mate? It’s electrifying.

I’d planned to go slow, be gentle. But between her taking charge, that husky Alpha on her lips, and the raw emotions flooding our bond, restraint shattered. My body claimed her. She insisted she was fine afterward, just tender. So I held back, even though I was ready again almost instantly. Instead, I tucked her against me, my favorite way to sleep, and we drifted off together.

Now, she stirs awake, arching her back, pressing against my already-hard length.

"Good morning, sweetheart. How do you feel?" I murmur, my hand gliding over her hip.

"Good morning." Her voice is sleep-rough, delicious. "I feel amazing. And I want more of what you gave me last night." She rocks back, teasing, and I hiss through my teeth.

My fingers find her nipple, rolling it until she moans. Then I grip her thigh, lifting it slightly, positioning myself at her entrance. "Is this what you need?"

"Yes, Alpha."

That’s all it takes. I sink into her, slow and deep. This time, I savor her—tracing her nipples, circling her clit, drawing out every shudder. When she comes for the third time, clenching around me, I lose control and spill inside her.

Afterward, I nip playfully at her neck. "You know exactly what you’re doing when you call me Alpha, don’t you?"

Her soft laugh is answer enough. "I like this position. We should use it more often."

I grin against her skin. "We’ll try them all. You can tell me which ones you love most."

"Mmm, Alpha," she purrs, arching again, and I’m hard inside her once more. So I take her again, exactly how she likes it.

After a shared shower, we head downstairs hand in hand. The dining hall is nearly empty except for Leopold.

He glances up, smirking. "Everything good?"

"Perfect." I lift Isolde’s hand, kissing her knuckles, loving how she blushes.

"Where is everyone?" I ask.

"Late start. Most are already at their assigned posts. Ready to begin patrols?"

I turn to Isolde. "What’s your plan today?"

"I’ll start in the kitchens—check staff, supplies, everything. You handle patrols, and I’ll bring food up later." She smiles at Leopold. "Have you eaten?"

"I’m fine, thank you, Luna."

"Then I’ll see you both soon." She squeezes my hand before heading to the kitchen.

"She’ll make an exceptional Luna," Leopold remarks.

"No doubt." I follow him to his office, mentally noting we need dedicated spaces for our work.

We spend the next hour reviewing patrol rotations, unassigned pack members, and housing. Almost every room in the packhouse is full.

"Where will new arrivals go?" I ask.

"Beta and Gamma floors. Since you haven’t appointed a Gamma, that floor’s empty. And aside from me, the Beta floor has space."

"What about the first floor? The omega quarters?"

His expression darkens. "Already packed. Most newcomers are omegas—abused, traumatized, seeking refuge. We’ve doubled up, even built bunk beds."

As we talk, I realize many unmated wolves have joined—some rejected, others widowed. I make a note to discuss pack mingling with Adrian and Sebastian. Maybe their unmated wolves are destined for ours.

Adrian insists Isolde visit them, believing it’ll trigger her memories. Possible, but we have pressing matters here. Until Alpha challenges conclude or she’s ready, it waits.

Morning flies by. Another omega knocks, delivering lunch from Isolde. I check the clock—already afternoon.

Over the meal, I outline the day. "I’ll interview new members for patrol eligibility." I take Leopold’s files.

"I’ll check on Isolde first."

"I’ll join you," Leopold says, standing.

We carry our trays to the kitchen—and I freeze, stunned by the sight before me.

###Chapter 0341

I make my way to the kitchens immediately after parting ways with Victor and Leopold. Only four people are present—three omegas and Beatrice, all busy cleaning up from breakfast and prepping for lunch.

"Good morning," I greet as I enter. The room falls silent.

Beatrice steps forward with a warm smile. "Luna Isolde, allow me to introduce Rosalind, Penelope, and Genevieve. We go by nicknames here—Rosie, Penny, and Gen."

"Pleasure to meet you all. Call me Isolde," I say.

They dip their heads in quiet acknowledgment, their movements hesitant. Beatrice's expression tells me this is normal behavior. These women have clearly known hardship in their previous packs. They'll only learn to trust me by working alongside me.

"Listen up." I clap my hands once. The omegas flinch. "First rule—this kitchen is a safe space. No one here will harm you. Not me, not Alpha Victor. Understood?" I wait until each meets my gaze and nods.

"Good. Second—you're severely understaffed. We're getting more help, but first I need to assess your skills. Putting someone who burns water in charge of cooking won't help anyone." That earns tentative smiles.

"Beatrice, let's start with you. What's your role here? And what would you prefer doing?" I begin with her deliberately—her confidence will reassure the others.

"I originally just delivered garden produce," she admits, wiping her hands on her apron. "Stayed when I saw they needed extra hands. Mostly prep work—cleaning, chopping. But given the choice? I'd rather be in the gardens. Love working with soil and plants."

I nod, turning to the others. "Rosie?"

She fidgets with her sleeve. "I... cooked in my last pack."

"Excellent. What specialties?"

"Stews. Roasts. Anything with meat."

"Perfect. You're officially our head cook." Her eyes widen at the title.

"Penny?"

"I can't cook," she admits. "I just fetch ingredients or find substitutes when we're missing something."

"Stock manager it is."

Lastly, I face Gen. "And you?"

"I follow orders. Do whatever's needed."

"Sous chef. Welcome aboard."

As I dice wild boar sausage with peppers and mushrooms, I keep talking. "Who plans the menus?"

Blank stares.

Rosie finally speaks. "I just... make do with what we have."

"What's planned for lunch?"

From the corner of my eye, I notice Beatrice pausing her vegetable washing to listen.

Rosie exchanges a glance with Gen. "Haven't decided yet. Still cleaning breakfast."

"Right. First—do you know others who'd want kitchen work?"

Their shocked expressions answer before words do. "So many want to help," Gen blurts. "But Beta Leopold's too busy assigning roles."

I pour beaten eggs over the sizzling filling. "Gen, who could you recruit right now?"

"At least six, Luna."

"Go get them. Anyone willing to work, bring them here. We're doing mass placements today." Gen darts off.

"Penny," I say as I plate the omelets, "what do we have for today's meals?"

She opens the pantry. "Some leftover boar ham. Pork shoulders."

It's not ideal, but it'll feed everyone. For now.

###Chapter 0342

"Do we have bread?"

Rosalind nods before glancing at me, anticipating my next question. "Cheese and lettuce too. But no mayo or mustard." She wrinkles her nose. "Budget's tight this week." So the entire kitchen staff knows about our financial struggles. At least they're being realistic about expectations.

I'm about to assign lunch duties when rapid footsteps echo through the kitchen. Two young omegas skid to a halt upon seeing me.

"Luna." They chorus, dipping their heads in respect.

"We heard you needed extra hands," the first says.

"Reporting for duty," adds the second.

"Perfect timing." I gesture toward the counter. "Let's see who's brave enough to deliver this to Alpha Victor and Beta Leopold."

The bolder girl immediately steps forward. "I'll do it."

As we assemble sandwiches on a tray, her companion pours two glasses of iced tea. "They're in the Beta's office," I inform her before turning to the shy one. "What's your name?"

The morning unfolds with surprising efficiency. We transform basic ingredients into hearty ham and cheese sandwiches. No store-bought chips, but the potato sacks inspire me - soon thin slices crisp to perfection in the oven.

More volunteers arrive. I put Gwendolyn in charge of slow-roasting pork shoulders for dinner while others improvise a tangy barbecue sauce from pantry staples.

When the first patrol returns, omegas serve meals with quiet pride. The warriors' startled expressions quickly melt into appreciation. We repeat this rhythm through each shift change.

I assemble two special sandwiches - one for Victor, one for Leopold - and finally make one for myself after skipping breakfast to ensure Leopold ate. As I send an omega runner with the Alpha's meal, I survey the bustling kitchen.

Laughter rings through the space. Omegas thrive when valued - they're the unsung backbone of every successful pack. Their skilled hands keep us fed, their diligent work often overlooked. Today, that changes.

The sudden silence pulls me from inventorying our meager pantry stores. I turn to find Victor and Leopold standing frozen in the doorway, empty plates in hand. Their stunned expressions contrast sharply with every omega now studying the floor tiles.

These poor souls expect reprimands, conditioned by years of harsh treatment.

"Alpha. Beta." I move toward them, voice deliberately light. "What brings you to our domain?"

Victor closes the distance, awe and concern warring in his tone. "Isolde, what's happening here?" Behind him, the omegas tense at his uncertain phrasing.

"Your pack members have organized themselves magnificently." I emphasize each word. "They're ensuring everyone gets proper meals today. Doesn't their initiative make you proud, Alpha?"

Understanding flashes in Victor's eyes. He presses a kiss to my forehead. "I've never been prouder of our pack." Stepping into the kitchen, he surveys the activity. "Tell me about these preparations."

A nervous omega glances my way. At my encouraging nod, she explains, "We're using the new potato harvest, Alpha. Lunch features homemade chips, and tonight we're roasting them with garden rosemary."

Victor rests a gentle hand on her shoulder, ignoring her instinctive flinch. "Brilliant resourcefulness."

Like flowers turning toward sunlight, the omegas blossom under their Alpha's attention. Victor moves through the kitchen, praising each contribution while Leopold adds enthusiastic compliments.

The tension dissolves into warm camaraderie. When Victor returns to my side, his whisper carries heartfelt admiration. "Have I told you today how extraordinary you are?"

I meet his gaze. "I merely pointed our pack in the right direction. They're the ones performing miracles."

###Chapter 0343

The kitchen was completely transformed from this morning. When Victor and I stepped inside, I was speechless. My incredible mate nudged me gently, reminding me to boost our omegas' morale.

I moved through the bustling space, stopping at each workstation. Listening. Praising. In my experience, omegas thrive on validation from their ranked members, especially their Alphas. Considering every omega here had suffered abuse, I wanted to establish a new norm—they were valued. Essential.

After making my rounds, I returned to Isolde. "Need to finalize patrol schedules," I said, brushing flour from her cheek. "Came to check on you, but clearly you've got everything under control." The warriors' shocked expressions mirrored my own—this was proper packhouse service for the first time in years.

I pulled her against my chest, inhaling her vanilla scent. "What's next on your agenda, love?"

"Food inventory first," she said, ticking tasks off her fingers. "Then assessing packhouse supplies and recruiting cleaning staff. Already have volunteers from this morning, but we'll need more hands."

"Anything you need from me?"

"Meat. That boar from yesterday won't last past tonight's dinner. Could we send a hunting party out this afternoon?"

I turned to Leopold. "Who usually handles hunts?"

"My off-duty lead warriors and I," he answered.

"Let's go ourselves. What do you think?"

His grin said everything.

"We'll return with enough game to feed an army," I promised Isolde, kissing her thoroughly before leaving.

Outside, patrol warriors were returning. One broke formation to intercept us.

"Beta Leopold, Alpha Victor—might I join your hunt?"

"Donovan." Leopold studied the warrior. "Just came off shift?"

"Yes, sir. Kitchen's running smoothly now, which means higher food consumption. I'd like to contribute."

I glanced at Leopold for assessment. No tension radiated from him, so I deferred to his judgment.

"We leave now," Leopold said. "Keep up."

Donovan fell into step as we headed for the treeline.

"You took boar last time," I noted. "What else runs these woods?"

"Boar are overpopulated—good for culling," Donovan answered. "Plenty of deer too. Turkey, rabbit, even bear, though we've yet to bag one. Older pups handle fishing when the creek runs high."

"You're a regular hunter for the pack?" I asked, wondering if he'd be among tomorrow's challengers.

"Primary hunter, yes." His jaw set. "And since we're speaking plainly, Alpha—I've entered tomorrow's challenge. No disrespect intended, but this pack requires strong leadership. I believe I can provide that."

"Appreciate your candor. That's an Alpha trait many lack."

"Donovan's your strongest contender," Leopold added.

I met the warrior's gaze. "Then impress me today, Donovan."

"Likewise, Alpha."

We stripped and shifted at the forest edge. Following their lead, we hunted until twilight. The haul—three deer, eight rabbits, and five turkeys—required multiple trips to transport.

Fine work, Donovan. Your wolf has excellent instincts.

Thank you, Alpha. Though he's not as skilled as yours.

Magnus and I have hunted to survive most of our lives, I replied as we trekked back. If I may ask—what brought you to this pack?

Same as most here—a story. His wolf's ears flicked backward. Second son of a Beta. When the Alpha's heir took over, my brother became Beta. I... needed to make my own path. The melancholy in his tone spoke volumes.

###Chapter 0344

"I never aspired to be Beta. That rank belonged to my brother by right. But fate played its cruel joke—I outpaced him in strength and speed, breeding resentment in his heart. He grew paranoid, convinced I'd steal his place in the pack hierarchy. The constant tension became unbearable. When he fabricated lies about my ambitions and presented them to our new Alpha, I was given an ultimatum: challenge him for the rank or exile myself. I chose exile."

Donovan's shoulders lift in a nonchalant shrug. "The title meant nothing to me."

—

"And now you seek to be Alpha?" I arch a brow. Leading a pack demands far more than Beta responsibilities ever could.

"I want this pack to flourish." His gaze burns with conviction. "No offense, Beta, but a leader without a wolf can't truly command respect. Too many lives depend on this pack's survival. Too many would suffer if it falls. Not every contender deserves the Alpha title—so I stepped forward."

"Compassion for your pack is a rare trait in a ranked warrior." I nod approvingly. "You possess the makings of a true Alpha."

"Appreciate that." He dips his chin as we reach the packhouse's rear entrance.

We deposit the game carcasses by the door. Inside, the aroma of herbs and roasting meat makes my stomach growl in unison with Leopold and Donovan.

"Isolde!" I call into the bustling kitchen.

She emerges from behind a counter, sleeves rolled up, chestnut curls escaping her messy bun. A streak of flour decorates her cheek. The sight ignites a primal urge to claim her. In three strides, I haul her against me.

She wrinkles her nose. "Ugh, you reek of blood and sweat. Successful hunt?"

"You smell like laundry detergent and disinfectant. Fair trade." I nip her bottom lip.

"Three bucks, six rabbits, four turkeys," Leopold announces proudly.

Her eyes spark like struck flint. Clapping once, she silences the kitchen.

"Who knows how to dress a deer?" Five hands shoot up. "You five—deer duty." She pivots to Leopold. "Where's the processing area?"

"I'll show them." He gestures for the group to follow.

"Rabbit and turkey butchers?" More volunteers emerge.

An omega named Nathaniel steps forward. "I can lead the small game prep, Luna."

"Excellent. Take whatever tools you need. Bring the meat back here for storage—and save the turkey carcasses. Rosalind wants to make soup."

A chorus of "Yes, Luna" echoes as they scatter.

Then those storm-gray eyes lock onto me. "You." Her finger jabs my chest. My grin falters.

"And you." She points at Donovan. "Name?"

"Donovan, Luna." His lips twitch at her commanding presence.

"Donovan, you and Victor are banished from my kitchen until you shower. Now. Dinner in ninety minutes—spread the word."

"Yes, Luna." He flashes a grin before retreating.

I catch Isolde's wrist, spinning her into my arms. "Watching you command this chaos?" My growl vibrates against her throat. "Fucking intoxicating."

Her arousal perfumes the air as she grinds against me. Over her shoulder, she tosses a smoldering look. "Show me how much you love it tonight... Alpha."

A predatory rumble shakes my ribs. "Count on it, little mate."

Donovan waits by the staircase, admiration glinting in his eyes. "She's born to lead."

"That she is."

###Chapter 0345

Victor and Leopold returned from their hunt, leaving me to turn toward Beatrice who had just come in from the gardens. "Could you start compiling a list of pantry essentials? The men will bring more meat, but we're dangerously low on spices and other basics."

"Right away, Luna."

I began interviewing the new omegas flooding into the kitchen. Those without cooking experience but skilled in cleaning were assigned tasks throughout the packhouse.

First, I organized teams for kitchen and dining room cleanup, adding the communal bathrooms to their duties. One omega, Isabelle, had been a Lead Omega in her former pack. I paired her with an assistant to inventory each room—tracking occupants, supply needs, and preferred cleaning schedules.

Our linen situation was dire. Towels and sheets were piled haphazardly, supplies nearly depleted. I designated someone to establish a washing rotation while another team sorted and cleaned the existing stock. Beatrice added cleaning supplies to our growing procurement list.

By the time Victor, Leopold, and an unfamiliar hunter returned, I was sweaty but satisfied. After assigning teams to process the fresh game and stealing a moment to flirt with my mate, I sent him off again.

I pulled Rosalind and another skilled cook aside. "Let's plan meals for the week." We drafted a menu that would gradually increase meat portions for the pack. Beatrice updated the shopping list as we worked.

"Luna," Gwendolyn interjected. Her sister Isabelle was handling room inventories—both had fled the same abusive pack. "We should consider egg-laying hens. A coop near the gardens would provide steady protein. The children could collect eggs, and excess chicks could supplement our meat supply."

"Brilliant." I had Beatrice research local poultry sources—no easy task without internet access.

As dinner approached, omegas plated food while others set the tables. Two gardeners, Seraphina and Cassandra, arrived with wildflower bouquets.

"Luna," Seraphina said. "We heard about the new meal system and wanted to celebrate."

"Perfect timing." We arranged the flowers just as warriors began filing in. Their steps faltered at the sight of the set tables.

"Take your seats," I announced. "Tonight's menu: pulled pork, roasted rosemary potatoes, and steamed spinach."

The dining hall buzzed with excitement. Through our bond, I summoned Victor. Attendance had doubled—whether drawn by food or curiosity about their Alpha and Luna, we needed extra tables.

I ensured every omega ate, including those still processing game. When I finally joined Victor, his gaze held pure wonder.

"You've transformed this pack into a home in one day," he murmured. "As always, you amaze me."

The atmosphere couldn't have been more different from last night's tense reunion. Laughter and lively conversation filled the space.

Pack members approached to thank us or simply introduce themselves. As the crowd dispersed—some to work, others to rest—Victor retreated to finalize patrol schedules. I stayed to confirm tomorrow's kitchen assignments before following him upstairs.

###Chapter 0346

The room is empty when I arrive. Victor hasn't returned yet. I peel off my clothes, desperate to wash away the day's grime. Slipping into one of his oversized shirts, I curl up in bed, mentally preparing for tomorrow's Alpha challenge.

My thoughts drift to Victor's possible anxiety when the door creaks open. Before I can speak, his hands are on me, his lips silencing all thoughts. The night dissolves into passion, his touch erasing every worry.

Dawn comes too soon. I feel Victor stirring beside me. "Nervous?" I whisper the question that's been haunting me.

"Not exactly." His fingers trace patterns on my arm. "But defeat is always possible. Leopold mentioned only one real threat - Donovan, that warrior you met yesterday."

"He's challenging you?"

"Yes. And he's got the skills. Strong. Beta bloodline. If he wins fairly, I'll accept it. The others? Not so much."

"How many others?" I imagine a small group.

"Five. Including that bastard Alistair from our first day."

My stomach twists. "How many will fight to the death?" The words taste bitter. Victor may be confident, but killing packmates isn't easy.

"Hard to say. But Alistair? Definitely."

We dress in silence. Victor chooses flexible combat gear while I opt for leggings and a tank top - ready to move if needed.

His arms suddenly encircle me from behind, chin resting on my shoulder. "You know you can't interfere today, right?"

"Like hell I won't." My voice cracks. "If saving you means leaving this pack, so be it. Aurora and I won't watch you die."

"Hopefully it won't come to that. But these are my fights to win."

"Fine for submission battles. But if it's to the death and you're losing?" I turn in his embrace. "I won't hesitate."

"Isolde..."

"No!" My shout echoes. "Don't ask that of me. Aurora says it's in our blood - the Moon Goddess made us this way. I won't kill them, but I won't let them kill you either."

He exhales sharply. "Alright. Let's face the day."

Breakfast is a funeral compared to last night's feast. Whispered speculations about the challenge fill the air. The entire pack gathers outside afterward, tension thick as fog.

Leopold oversees the proceedings. The first challenger demands a submission match. Victor defeats him swiftly. The second lasts longer - nearly forty-five minutes of grappling before yielding.

Then Alistair steps forward. "To the death," he declares.

Victor's jaw tightens. "You're certain?"

Alistair's smirk makes my skin crawl. "Absolutely. And know this, Alpha," he drawls, eyes raking over me, "when I kill you, I'll claim your mate as mine."

Victor's growl shakes the ground. Alistair merely grins. Leopold signals the start.

Unlike before, Victor attacks first. Alistair's taunt has unleashed something primal. To my surprise, Alistair holds his own, dodging more than striking but staying dangerous.

'He's too close,' Aurora warns seconds before Alistair lunges - not at Victor, but at me. His grip is iron, one hand fisted in my hair, the other crushing my waist.

"Or maybe I'll mark her now," he breathes against my neck, "make her MY Guardian."

###Chapter 0347

The moment Alistair declared he would claim Isolde as his mate, Magnus and I saw red. This bastard wasn't walking out of here alive. No one touches what's mine. No one.

He moved faster than anticipated, dodging my initial strikes. A few punches landed, but rage numbed the pain. As we circled each other, I realized his game too late.

When he grabbed Isolde, threatening to mark her immediately, my blood turned to ice. I didn't know if remarking a Guardian with a living mate was possible. Didn't care either. She belonged to me. Magnus roared in my mind, demanding we tear this threat to pieces.

"You've forfeited the Alpha challenge by involving my mate," I growled. "The duel is void."

"Meaningless," he sneered. "Once bonded to a Guardian, no one can defeat me."

Just as I prepared to lunge, Isolde winked at me - her eyes shifting to solid gold. Aurora had taken control.

What happened next froze everyone in place. She twisted in his grasp, her hand plunging through his chest. I swear she gripped his still-beating heart. The shock on Alistair's face was almost comical. The pack's collective gasp echoed around us.

"No one brands me against my will," Aurora declared, yanking his heart free. His corpse collapsed with that same stunned expression. She turned to the crowd, crushing the organ in her fist before tossing it aside.

"Anyone else fancy trying to use me against my mate?"

Silence. Then a sea of frantic head-shaking.

I pulled her close. "Are you hurt, love?"

Aurora hadn't relinquished control yet. "Only you and Magnus get to sink teeth into me," she purred.

I kissed her fiercely. Whether intentional or not, she'd just publicly claimed me again. Goddess, this woman.

"And only you and Isolde get that privilege with me," I murmured against her lips. "Now give her back so we can finish this."

When her eyes returned to warm brown, I faced Leopold. "Let's proceed."

Leopold hesitated, then gestured to Alistair's lackeys. "Remove this." They obeyed, giving Isolde terrified glances.

"Next challenger - Donovan," Leopold announced.

Not the fight I wanted after that spectacle. My focus was fractured, but finishing this meant restoring order.

Donovan stepped forward. "I won't risk weakening our pack by challenging Alpha Victor to the death. His death could kill our Guardian, Luna Isolde." He addressed the pack. "You've all witnessed what these two achieved in forty-eight hours. Imagine their impact over years." Turning back, he continued, "Therefore, I withdraw my challenge, believing you're worthy of leading us."

He grinned. "Though I'd welcome a friendly spar later."

"Agreed," I nodded before facing Leopold.

The remaining challengers rescinded their petitions. Just like that, I stood as undisputed Alpha again.

With Isolde at my side, I addressed the pack.

"Rebuilding begins now. I'll meet with Alphas Adrian and Sebastian to discuss pack finances and official recognition. Once settled, we'll hold proper ceremonies for Alpha, Luna, and Beta roles - establishing our mind link."

Cheers erupted.

"Your Luna's already transforming the packhouse, as yesterday's meals proved." More applause.

"Those needing assignments, see me, Luna Isolde, or Beta Leopold. Finally, for those seeking mates, I'll arrange gatherings with neighboring packs."

The response was deafening.

"Our doors are always open. This pack is a sanctuary. Voice concerns freely to any ranked member." I gestured to Leopold and Isolde. "Now - back to work!"

I sent Isolde to clean up while accepting congratulations. Many wanted to discuss patrol schedules. Leopold handled other duties as I scheduled a meeting in fifteen minutes.

Spotting Donovan, I approached.

"Alpha," he said, baring his neck.

I clasped his shoulder. "Ever considered becoming Gamma?"

His eyes widened. "Never crossed my mind."

"Well, I need one. You're my choice. Think it over." I left him gaping as I headed to shower.

###Chapter 0348

The water runs cold as I finish my shower. Toweling off, I realize with sudden clarity - I have no clue if anyone in this pack owns a functioning vehicle. Beatrice's extensive shopping list won't fulfill itself, and all I know about this area is the tiny town Victor and I passed through when we disembarked from that godforsaken bus.

Victor strides in just as I'm buttoning my jeans. His presence fills the small space effortlessly. "Does anyone here actually own a car?" I ask, watching him peel off his sweat-drenched shirt.

Muscles ripple beneath golden skin, every morning's injuries already vanished thanks to our accelerated healing. My fingers itch to trace those defined ridges.

"Donovan has one. Why? Planning an escape already?" His smirk tells me he's joking, but the possessive glint in his eyes says otherwise.

I step closer, running my palms down his torso. "Maybe I just want to admire my mate without interruptions." My fingers dip lower, brushing the waistband of his pants.

Victor's growl vibrates through me as he spins me against the wall. My jeans pool around my ankles before I can blink. One strong hand grips my hip while the other tangles in my hair, tilting my head back.

No foreplay. No gentle caresses. Just raw, claiming possession as he drives into me. The wood paneling digs into my palms, but I don't care. This - the desperate joining, the primal need - it's everything.

We collapse against each other, sweat-slicked and panting. Victor nips at my shoulder. "Distracting me won't get your shopping done, Little Alpha."

I turn in his arms, meeting his darkened gaze. "Who says that wasn't the goal?"

His answering snarl sends heat pooling low in my belly. Strong hands flip me around again, bending me over the dresser this time. When his palm connects sharply with my backside, stars explode behind my eyelids.

By the time we're both sated and dressed, the morning light has shifted to afternoon gold. Victor kisses me roughly before shoving me toward the door. "Leopold will know who can drive you. And Isolde?" That wicked grin reappears. "Wear the red panties tonight."

I find Leopold in his office with Donovan, their conversation halting abruptly at my entrance. "Apologies for interrupting. I need transport to town for supplies."

Donovan rises immediately. "I'll take you, Luna. Where are we headed?"

"The market. The packhouse kitchens are practically bare."

Leopold's expression darkens. "We don't have funds for-"

"The pack doesn't," I interrupt. "I do." Turning to Donovan, I add, "You'll also be playing bodyguard. Can't have humans thinking a lone female is easy prey."

Leopold barks a laugh. "As if you need protection. If anything, Donovan here should worry about you defending him."

"Leopold," Donovan groans, rubbing his neck. "Alpha only asked me about the Gamma position an hour ago."

I study the broad-shouldered warrior. "You'll make the right decision. Victor doesn't choose pack hierarchy lightly."

Donovan nods, ears turning pink. "When do we leave?"

"Now, if you're ready."

Victor catches us at the front entrance, his scent still clinging to my skin. "Going somewhere, trouble?"

"Donovan's escorting me for supplies."

Victor's arms band around me. "We can't afford-"

"The pack can't," I correct, pressing closer. "We can."

His grip tightens. "I don't want you spending your money on-"

I twist free, spine straightening. "Am I your Luna or not?"

"Isolde, that's not-"

"Is the pack's wellbeing my responsibility too?" My voice drops to a whisper only he can hear. "Either we're partners in this, or we're not. Your pride won't feed our people."

Victor's jaw works silently. I see the battle raging behind those stormy eyes - Alpha instincts warring with reason.

Finally, he exhales sharply. "Fine. But I'm repaying every cent."

"Wrong answer." I frame his face with my hands. "When I claimed you as mine, I claimed this pack too. Let me help build something extraordinary."

His kiss steals my breath, slow and deep and promising retribution later. "Goddess help me, I adore you."

"Remember that when you see the bill." I step back, calling over my shoulder, "Donovan! Let's move before the stores close!"

The engine roars to life as I slide into the passenger seat. My mate watches from the porch, arms crossed, looking every inch the dominant Alpha - and entirely at my mercy.
###Chapter 0349

First, I can't even support Isolde financially. Now she's the one sustaining the pack because I've failed. I must be the most pathetic Alpha in existence. At least she still believes in me, which means I need to meet with Sebastian and Adrian immediately. With the Alpha challenge over, I'll arrange a meeting today.

I head to the dining hall to meet potential new patrol members. Bringing one of the patrol leaders along, we discuss current security rotations. It hits me—I should join patrols myself to assess our border weaknesses. I would've done it sooner, but bonding with Isolde took priority. Being newly mated makes every second apart unbearable.

We're wrapping up when a howl pierces the air. The patrol leader tenses. "Someone's at the border, Alpha. Should we check?"

"Let's move."

We jog toward the sound. "How do you know it's not an attack?" I ask, noting our steady pace instead of shifting.

"Different warning tones. A pack link would make this easier. We've adapted to wolf-form communication, but it's not ideal."

When we arrive, I see a woman—Lillian—kneeling, clutching an infant. A patrol member crouches beside her. "Alpha, this is Lillian and her child."

She looks up, face bruised, the metallic scent of blood clinging to her. "You're the Alpha?"

"Yes." I kneel before her. "You're safe now."

She collapses into my arms, sobbing. I hold her until she regains composure.

"Can you walk?"

She nods.

Arm around her, I guide her toward the packhouse. "How old is your baby?"

"One month."

"Who did this to you?" I ask as the packhouse comes into view.

"Hunters. They're getting reckless. I barely escaped—they might've followed me. I'm sorry."

I glance at Tobias, the patrol leader. He bolts to alert the others.

Entering the packhouse, a furious growl echoes. Isolde stands there, Aurora blazing in her eyes at the sight of me touching another she-wolf. Then her nostrils flare—she smells the blood. Her eyes soften, and she rushes forward.

"What happened?"

"Lillian was fleeing hunters," I explain, relieved she understands instantly.

"Summer! Where's an empty room?" Isolde asks.

Lillian suddenly stiffens, inhaling sharply. "Mate."

I follow her gaze—Leopold stands frozen, staring at her.

Isolde blinks, then recovers. "Okay, let's get you settled in a room near Beta Leopold's quarters." She shoots me a wide-eyed look. "Summer, which one's ready?"

A young woman checks her clipboard. "The one beside Beta Leopold's."

"Come with me," Isolde says, then turns to me. "Do we have a pack doctor?"

Leopold's still entranced. "Leopold. Doctor?"

He snaps to attention. "You're hurt." His gaze drops to the baby. "And you have a child." His voice cracks, hope deflating.

Isolde intervenes smoothly. "Let's focus on her injuries first, okay?" She guides Lillian upstairs.

Leopold clears his throat. "No doctor, but we have someone with medical training."

"Bring them," Isolde orders.

"Rosalind, prepare a meal. Have Leopold or Donovan deliver it."

"Yes, Luna."

"Donovan, help Victor unload the car. I bought two computers—one for you and Leopold to share, one for pack logistics."

I grab the food tray, but a new howl erupts—this one screams danger.

I shift mid-turn, leaping through the door. Victor follows. Another howl cuts off abruptly.

Thirty to forty hunters armed with silver and wolfsbane weapons are attacking. Magnus snarls—how dare they invade our territory? Pack members lie wounded, some mid-shift, silver poisoning their veins. Bullets whiz past as I lunge into combat.

A bullet tears through my shoulder. Magnus eviscerates a hunter. Wolfsbane arrows pierce my flank, slowing me. I rip an archer's arm off, but our numbers dwindle.

Aurora streaks into the fray. An arrow strikes her, but she barely flinches. Grace never trained to fight, but Aurora's Guardian instincts are lethal—decapitating hunters with terrifying precision.

I fight on, strength fading. The wounded aren't healing. How many are dead?

The hunters' weapons made this unfair. Aurora finishes the last one. Limping to her, I scent wolfsbane—she's favoring her injured leg. Magnus whines, licking her face before darkness claims me.

###Chapter 0350

I barely had Lillian settled in her room when the alarm howls shattered the night. The border had been breached. Lillian clutched her newborn tighter, sobs wracking her body.

"Stay here. You're safe." My voice was steady despite the adrenaline surging through me. "I have to go."

A searing pain lanced through my shoulder—Victor had been hit. A vicious growl tore from my throat as Aurora surged forward, forcing the shift. I barreled past Leopold and another pack member, likely the medic, before exploding through the back doors of the packhouse.

The acrid stench of hunters flooded my nostrils—thirty-eight of them, their fear and hatred thick in the air. Bullets whizzed past, arrows slicing through the darkness.

Another jolt of agony—Victor took a second hit, this time in the leg. When I reached the battlefield, carnage greeted me. Victor and the remaining warriors were outnumbered, struggling to close the distance against the hunters' ranged attacks.

Aurora didn't hesitate. She tore through their ranks with brutal efficiency. These monsters had come to slaughter our pack. They'd wounded our mate. None would leave alive.

The sting in my own leg barely registered until a fresh wave of pain signaled Victor's third injury. Aurora kept ripping through bodies until the last hunter fell. Panting, she scanned for survivors when Magnus limped forward, licking blood from her jaws before collapsing.

I shifted instantly, catching Victor's limp form. His pulse thrummed weakly beneath my fingers. My howl for help echoed through the trees as pack members emerged from the smoke. Leopold arrived first, already assessing the wounded.

"Do we have a medical facility?" I demanded.

"Just the packhouse dining hall." He moved to check an unconscious warrior.

"Get everyone inside. Now."

Donovan helped me carry Victor back. Others followed with the injured. In the dining hall, I barked orders as I pulled on a borrowed shirt. "Where's the medic?"

"Fetching her," Leopold said. "There's another with field experience."

"Bring them both. Donovan—double the patrols until we're sure there aren't more attackers."

The she-wolves stood ready. "Who's trained with Leopold?"

"All of us," they answered in unison.

"Form a defensive perimeter. No one gets through." Aurora's growl darkened my voice.

Leopold returned with two medics—a man and woman whose eyes widened at the bloodshed. "Triage the wounded. The Alpha first—two silver bullets and an arrow. We need extraction tools."

"Supplies?" the female medic asked.

Leopold shook his head. "Only what's at the clinic."

"Go. Get everything—scalpels, clamps, bandages." As they raced off, the medic frowned at my leg.

"Luna, you've got an arrow—"

I glanced down, surprised to see the shaft protruding from my thigh. A quick claw-snap shortened it. "Treat them first."

"Rosalind!" I called toward the kitchen.

She appeared instantly. "Luna?"

###Chapter 0351

"We need easily digestible meals for the wounded. Start preparing that turkey soup you mentioned earlier. The injured will need it, along with anything else that might aid their recovery."

"Yes, Luna," she replies just as Leopold and Donovan return with medical supplies.

"You must be Isolde." A deep, unfamiliar voice speaks from behind me. I whirl around to see a man standing beside one of the warriors I assigned to guard the packhouse.

"Luna, this is—"

I know him. Somehow, I recognize this man. "Sebastian," I finish for her.

His answering smile is like sunlight piercing through storm clouds. "It's good to finally meet you," he says, glancing around. "Though I wish it were under better circumstances. Seraphina and I heard your call for assistance. I've brought warriors and my personal physician. Seraphina wanted to come, but she's pregnant, and I didn't know what we'd be walking into."

I shake my head. "Sebastian, thank you."

As I stare, he raises an eyebrow. "Are you going to tell your warrior squad to stand down so my pack can enter?" he asks dryly.

"Of course. Let them in," I instruct my pack member.

"Where's Victor?" Sebastian asks, stepping inside and immediately assessing the wounded.

"Here. He's been hit three times."

Sebastian moves to examine him, nodding. "Remove the bullets and the arrow, and he'll recover. I'd bet he'll be on his feet by morning."

I frown. "How do you know that?"

He smirks. "Perks of being mated to a Guardian."

His gaze lingers on me. "You've been avoiding us, Isolde. It's time Aurora met her sisters. You won't understand what it means to them—or to you—until her memories return. But it's time. We're family. Aurora just needs to remember that."

Sebastian picks up a scalpel and makes a precise incision near Victor’s shoulder before extracting the bullet with forceps. He drops it onto the floor.

"Seraphina has a silver immunity, so now I do too. I don’t think you share that Guardian trait, but you seem resistant to wolfsbane," he notes, nodding at my injured leg. "If that’s the case, Victor will have developed the same resistance. It’ll speed up his healing."

The moment Sebastian’s physician enters, Donovan’s head snaps up. "Mate!"

Her eyes lock onto his with equal intensity. "Mate."

"Well, damn. There goes my best doctor," Sebastian mutters, already working on the second bullet lodged in Victor’s thigh.

The adrenaline is fading, and Sebastian’s presence feels surreal, so my response comes out oddly casual. "Victor mentioned we have a lot of unmated pack members. He wants to organize gatherings between our three packs."

"Smart idea. Adrian and I did something similar, but we’ve mostly paired off our members by now."

"I’m annoyed about losing Dr. Whitmore, but we have another physician. Sounds like you need her here more anyway."

He shifts to remove the arrow from Victor’s thigh. "Hunters?" he guesses, glancing at me.

"Yes. A woman and her baby showed up at our border seeking refuge." I look over at Leopold, who hasn’t stopped tending to the wounded. "She was fleeing the hunters. They must have tracked her here. She’s mated to our Beta," I add, nodding toward him.

Sebastian inhales subtly, then tilts his head. "He smells like an Alpha to me." A pause. "But no wolf?"

I see Leopold stiffen at the comment. "He’s an excellent Beta, with or without a wolf," I say defensively.

"Didn’t say he wasn’t. Just noted the Alpha blood," Sebastian replies as he pulls the arrow free and drops it.

"Alright, you’re next," he says, standing.

"Me?"

He arches a brow. "You’re a Guardian, but that arrow still needs to come out. I’m not a miracle worker, so I’ll only treat you and Victor. If I mess up, I know your bodies can handle it."

He kneels in front of me, examining the wound before making a quick incision beneath the arrowhead. I hiss as he extracts it, blood trickling down my thigh.

"Sebastian, get the hell away from my mate." Victor’s voice is strained but firm.

"Victor!" I drop beside him, pressing against him as the day’s tension finally crashes over me. I hadn’t realized how terrified I was of losing him. Tears spill as his arms wrap around me, his scent enveloping me.

"I'm here, love," he murmurs.

###Chapter 0352

Consciousness returns in slow, painful waves. Every muscle screams in protest as chaotic sounds assault my ears. My vision clears to reveal Sebastian kneeling before my mate, his hands working on something I can't see. Isolde wears only an oversized t-shirt that does little to preserve her modesty.

The moment she collapses into my arms, relief floods through me despite her tears. My gaze lifts to Sebastian, who deliberately displays the arrow he just extracted from Isolde's thigh.

"Why are you here?" I demand, giving my mate space to compose herself while I stroke her back.

"Seraphina sent a distress howl. Evelyn and I heard it. My warriors are outside assisting with patrols until we regain control. Adrian should arrive any moment." Another howl pierces the air, signaling arrivals at the border.

Sebastian cocks his head. "That's probably him now. I'll go confirm."

I grab his arm before he can leave. "Sebastian...thank you."

"We're family now." His expression softens. "We need Isolde and Seraphina to understand that. I'm still learning what family means, but I know this - we stand together when needed."

When he departs, I attempt to sit up. Isolde hastily wipes her eyes and helps me. "I'm sorry, I just-" she begins.

"Shhh." I cut her off gently. "You handled everything perfectly during the crisis."

My eyes scan the wounded. No fatalities, but many will need extended recovery time.

Now that I'm conscious, Isolde moves to assist others. "Stay put," she orders, and I can't suppress a grin at her commanding tone. My Alpha female.

Sebastian returns with Adrian in tow. "You're Adrian," Isolde says, approaching him with visible confusion about how she recognizes him.

"And you must be Isolde. I wish our first meeting was under better circumstances." Adrian extends his hand.

After their handshake, he surveys the scene. "Sebastian mentioned hunter attacks." His gaze finds me, and he starts toward us with Isolde beside him. "Thirty-eight of them," she confirms.

"How do you know the exact number?" I ask.

She pauses, frowning. "I could smell them."

Adrian whips his head toward her. "Individually?"

"It was like...I could visualize them. Sense their numbers. Unless Aurora's wrong about the count."

Adrian smiles at her before addressing me. "Never doubt a Guardian. My pack learned that lesson the hard way. If she says thirty-eight, it's thirty-eight."

Isolde stares at him incredulously. "Guardian gifts," he explains.

"I thought the gifts came from mating a Guardian," she says, glancing at Sebastian.

"The Guardian possesses the gifts initially," he clarifies. "Completing the bond with your fated mate shares them." He turns to me. "Didn't you feel the power surge when she marked you?"

My shocked expression must answer for me.

"Gifts of being mated to a Guardian," Adrian and Sebastian chorus in eerie unison.

"Her Guardian healing is why you're awake before any other injured wolf here," Adrian continues. "Some merely got wolfsbane, yet you're the only one conscious after sustaining worse injuries."

Sebastian adds, "That comes from Isolde. I'd love to spar with you now - imagine the strength from bonding with the most powerful Guardian."

Isolde snarls before he finishes. Sebastian raises placating hands. "Not to harm him, just to test his limits. Your Guardian spirit is the strongest, though Evelyn's display during the vampire war was terrifying. Which is why you three need to unite - to strengthen your gifts through shared knowledge. Once you access Evander's memories, everything will make sense."

"Evelyn," Isolde whispers, her gaze turning distant. Both men snap to attention.

"Do you remember Selene?" Adrian asks softly.

"My...daughter?" Isolde's brow furrows in confusion.

"Daughter?" I echo, equally puzzled. I thought Selene was Evelyn's wolf spirit.

"Much to discuss," Sebastian interjects, "but not now. Our mates should be present for this conversation - they can answer your questions better."

Dr. Whitmore approaches. "Alphas, Luna." He nods to each of us. "All projectiles have been removed. Shouldn't we move the injured somewhere more comfortable?"

###Chapter 0353

I glance at Isolde. "Do any require continuous medical care?" She turns to the physician.

"Most won't need intensive treatment," the doctor replies. "But they'll need supervision when they wake. Food, water, and rest to regain strength. A few, however, will need ongoing medical attention. I assume your pack hospital isn't functional?"

"Correct." I attempt to push myself up, but two pairs of hands press me back down—Isolde's and Adrian's.

"We've got this, brother," Adrian says firmly. "Let yourself heal. Sebastian, Isolde, and I can handle things."

"Brother?" The word catches me off guard. After everything, I never expected Adrian to truly forgive me.

"You're mated to a Guardian," he states, his tone leaving no room for argument. "Past grievances don't matter now. You're family. And I take family seriously."

"Very seriously," Sebastian adds dryly from behind him. "You'll get used to it. Though, fair warning—it's weird."

Adrian rises, shaking his head before fixing me with a look. "You should follow doctor's orders. Eat. Rest."

"I'll rest when my pack is settled."

"Spoken like a true Alpha." He extends a hand to help me up. "But at least sit while you eat. Supervise from there."

Standing makes my vision swim. Isolde is instantly at my side, sliding my arm over her shoulders. She guides me to a table, pulls out a chair, then signals Rosalind to bring soup and water.

As I eat, I watch Isolde organize the injured. Those who live in the packhouse are returned to their rooms. Others are taken home. Mates are assigned to stay with them; for those without, omegas volunteer as caretakers, instructed to alert Isolde if anything changes.

One of Adrian's warriors enters with a patrol update—then freezes, nostrils flaring. "Mate!" His gaze darts around until it lands on Beatrice, the gardener. Her face mirrors his dazed excitement. "Mate," she breathes.

"Two down," Isolde murmurs, collecting my empty bowl.

"Two?"

"Donovan found his, too." She nods toward where he assists the doctor, his devotion already obvious. His mate seems equally smitten. Maybe this will finally convince him to accept the Gamma position.

"What about Leopold and Lillian?"

"Right—three, then." She exhales. "Sebastian approves of your pack gathering idea. Clearly, it's needed. I'll miss Beatrice—she's an excellent worker—but we're gaining a doctor from Sebastian's pack, so that balances out."

I observe as the injured are relocated, soup distributed. Twenty-two wounded, only two critical. Adrian offers to transfer them to his pack hospital for proper care.

"Sebastian and I will leave warriors to reinforce your patrols," Adrian says. "They'll alert us via pack link if you're attacked again. Also—" He gestures to the warrior now deep in conversation with Beatrice. "I'd like Sebastian to stay. To bond with his mate."

"Beatrice," I supply. "Of course. I'm glad our members are finding their matches."

"Sebastian mentioned your idea for pack gatherings. We should discuss it. Soon."

"There's much to discuss with you both. This weekend, if things stabilize here."

Adrian nods. "We'll head out now. Update me tomorrow." He clasps my shoulder. "Hope to see you and your mate this weekend."

As he informs Sebastian he can stay, Beatrice's face lights up like a solstice bonfire. She takes Sebastian's hand, and I'd wager they'll be fully mated by dawn.

"Come on, old man," Isolde teases, slipping behind me. "Bedtime."

I stand, pulling her close. "We've had this talk before, Little Alpha. I'm not old."

"Prove it when you're healed," she counters, leading me upstairs. Wrapped in her cherry blossom scent, I finally surrender to sleep.

###Chapter 0354

The morning light barely touches the sheets when I slip out of bed, leaving Victor to his peaceful slumber. My bare feet pad silently across the hardwood as I head downstairs to check on last night's wounded. No one disturbed us—a good sign that either everyone's recovering or still resting.

The kitchen hums with activity. Several omegas who volunteered for night watch are brewing coffee and slicing fruit. I learn only five patients remain unconscious. Most woke hungry, devoured soup, and are now preparing to join breakfast in the dining hall. I'm turning toward the stairs to check the remaining sleepers when Donovan and Dr. Whitmore stride in.

Their matching yawns can't hide the fresh mating marks on their necks.

"Morning," I tease, grinning at their flushed faces. Been there, done that. I extend a hand to the blushing doctor. "I'm Isolde. You must be Dr. Whitmore."

Her grip is firm despite her pink cheeks. "Seraphina, please, Luna. Donovan's told me everything about your vision for this pack. I'd be honored to contribute."

I shoot Donovan a knowing look. "She's flawless."

"Damn right," he murmurs, nuzzling her temple.

"As much as I hate to interrupt newlyweds," I say, "could I borrow Seraphina? Five pack members haven't woken yet."

"Of course." She darts upstairs for her medical bag.

Donovan tracks her movement like a compass needle finding north. When she disappears, he turns to me with stars in his eyes.

"Luna, is Alpha awake? I've got his answer."

I arch a brow. "Will this answer delight your Alpha and Luna, Donovan?"

His grin could power the entire territory. "Absolutely."

"Good. My office. Now." Victor's voice rumbles behind me.

I spin into his arms. "You should've woken me." His limp is barely noticeable as he crushes me against his chest.

"You needed rest. Seraphina and I will check the remaining patients. Most are already at breakfast—you and Donovan should eat after your talk." I press a warning kiss to his jaw. "Don't overexert yourself, Alpha."

Seraphina returns, medical bag in hand. "We'll meet you in the dining room," I tell Victor.

Two warriors rouse during our examination. For the other three, I rotate their watchers, sending exhausted volunteers to nap.

"You're jumping into the deep end joining us," I tell Seraphina as we walk. "But we're building a true sanctuary here."

Her eyes spark with challenge. "Ruins excite me, Luna. A blank slate for our hospital? That's every physician's dream." She hesitates. "Assuming you and Alpha approve."

I laugh. "Supernatural medicine is your domain. Whatever you need, we'll make it happen. Slowly, but surely. You'll have two med students assisting—evaluate their skills yourself."

The dining room buzzes with conversation. Victor, Donovan, Leopold, and Lillian sit together. The Alphas' noses twitch simultaneously before they rise, chairs scraping. Victor claims me in a possessive embrace before seating me beside him.

"Eat," he orders, pushing a plate toward me. "Report."

Seraphina and I detail each patient's status. "Alpha Adrian called," Leopold adds. "His two patients remain unconscious." I note how Lillian's gaze flicks to him, then away. Something unspoken lingers there.

"Lillian," I say gently, "how was your first night? I'm sorry I didn't check on you and your little one."

Seraphina brightens. "You have a baby?"

"One month old," Lillian murmurs, peeking at Leopold through her lashes. Ah. Unresolved tension indeed. "We slept well, thank you, Luna."

The clatter of cutlery fills the silence that follows. Victor's fingers lace through mine under the table—a silent promise. Whatever storms come, we'll weather them together.

###Chapter 0355

Victor's gaze shifts past me to Lillian. "Is there anyone we should contact? Someone who might be searching for you, so we can assure them you're safe."

She shakes her head. "No, thank you, Alpha. There's no one."

I sense Victor's confusion through our bond. How can this woman have a newborn if there's no one in her life?

'The baby is a hybrid,' Aurora murmurs in my mind.

'A hybrid?' I ask. "Part wolf, part human?"

'Not exactly. Part wolf, yes. But the other half... I'm not sure.'

"Lillian, do you have everything you need for your baby?" I ask gently. "And what's her name?"

Tears glisten in her eyes. "I... haven't named her yet."

"It's okay," I say, placing my hand over hers. Out of the corner of my eye, I notice Leopold's fingers twitch, as if resisting the urge to reach for her. My heart aches for him. I'd hoped he'd find someone, but this situation is complicated. I just pray they can overcome it.

"Would you like to join me today?" I offer. "I have some tasks to finish, and I can show you around at the same time."

Her face brightens. "I'd love that. I want to work—to be useful. Whatever you need, I'll do it gladly."

Victor's hand settles on my back, warm and reassuring. "There's no shortage of work here," I say with a light laugh.

"We're happy to have you, Lillian," Victor adds. "Isolde is organizing everything, and I'm sure she'll find something that suits you. But please, take all the time you need to recover."

"I'm ready to work, Alpha," she insists.

Seraphina frowns. "Are you injured? From yesterday's attack?"

"No, before that. The hunters held me captive, but I escaped and found my way here." A fleeting smile touches her lips.

"Have you been examined by a doctor?" Seraphina presses, her tone shifting into professional concern.

"Someone checked me yesterday," Lillian murmurs, glancing at Leopold.

Leopold's eyes never leave her. "Dr. Whitmore is our pack physician. You should let her examine you properly."

Lillian nods. "Alright."

"Good!" I clap my hands together. "After breakfast, you'll have your first assignment." I turn to Donovan. "What about you, love?"

He looks to Victor for guidance.

Victor stands abruptly. "Everyone, listen up." The room falls silent. "I've asked Donovan to serve as our Gamma, and he's accepted. At our next ceremony, he'll be officially recognized as Gamma, and his mate, Seraphina Whitmore, will join us as our Gamma female. She's a skilled physician from the Nightshade Pack, and we're fortunate to have her."

Cheers erupt as pack members swarm the table to congratulate Donovan and Seraphina. I notice Lillian slipping away quietly. Leopold pretends not to watch, but I catch the way his gaze follows her. When he turns back, he finds me staring. I raise a brow, but he just shakes his head.

Victor continues, "One more announcement. Our own Beatrice Gray found her mate yesterday—Sebastian, Lead Warrior of the Blackthorn Pack. While we gain a doctor, we lose one of our finest gardeners. Thankfully, our alliance with both packs remains strong."

More cheers follow, along with tearful goodbyes from Beatrice's gardening team.

Victor raises his hands again. "Yesterday's attack revealed our need for stronger warrior training. Starting Monday, all warriors will train twice daily under my command and Leopold's. Every pack member with a wolf will train at least once a day—men and women together."

A chorus of approval rises from the women.

"Until then, train with Leopold. He is your Beta—respect him accordingly. Isolde and I leave tomorrow morning. If you have concerns, see me before we go."

He sits, pressing a kiss to my temple before we return to our meals.

###Chapter 0356

"What's on your agenda today, Isolde?" I ask as we finish breakfast.

"I need to install those computers in the kitchens and packhouse." She pauses, turning to me. "Did you unload them from the car yesterday, or did things get... interrupted?"

"They're probably still in the vehicle." I glance at Donovan. "You didn't retrieve them, did you?"

"Completely slipped my mind, Alpha." He pulls Seraphina closer, kissing her temple. "After finding my mate, other priorities took over."

Seraphina's cheeks flush pink. Donovan clearly enjoys making his mate blush. From my periphery, I notice Leopold stiffen at their display. Time to address the elephant in the room.

"Leopold, let's fetch those computers together. Hopefully no perishables were left in the car."

"The omegas helped unload everything," Isolde assures us.

I take Isolde's hand, savoring the contact as I help her up. Pressing a kiss to her knuckles, I reluctantly release her. "I'll deliver your computer first, then Leopold and I will set up his office system. Donovan, start scouting offices for ranked members—keep them clustered together. Afterwards, show your mate our medical facilities so she can assess the workload."

Turning to Seraphina, I add, "It'll be demanding. Hope you're prepared."

"Like I told Luna Isolde, I thrive on challenges," she responds.

My lips curve. "Then you've found the perfect pack. Challenges are our specialty."

After dropping Isolde in the kitchen, Leopold and I head to Donovan's unlocked car. The trunk release sticks, requiring extra force.

"So," I lean against the vehicle, "want to explain the tension with your mate?" His jaw clenches. Silence stretches, but I wait him out.

Finally, he exhales sharply. "She has a child. But nobody's searching for them. I assumed she had a wolf partner. What kind of father abandons his pup? Even if some Alphas dismiss female heirs, I'd never let my child's mother disappear."

"Have you asked her?"

His fingers rake through his hair. "Last night was chaotic."

I raise a brow. "Donovan fought hunters, triaged wounded, and still claimed his mate. You're telling me you couldn't manage one conversation?"

"Fine." His voice drops. "What if she rejects a wolfless mate?"

Ah. The core fear.

"Didn't seem like rejection at breakfast. She looked devastated by your avoidance. She's alone here, Leopold. You need to resolve this. If you're considering rejection—"

"I'd never!" He nearly shouts. "The Moon Goddess blessed me despite my condition. Why would I throw that away?"

"Then act like her mate. At minimum, learn her story. She's not just fleeing hunters." Confusion wrinkles his forehead. "A single mother with an infant? Nobody searching? Consider how long she's been captive." Understanding dawns in his eyes—the grim possibilities of conception during captivity, or a mate killed before the birth.

"You're right." He squares his shoulders. "I'll talk to her."

"Do it now." I hoist a computer box. "No better time. I'll set up your office system while you two talk. Meet me afterwards to discuss the new training regimen."

Back in the kitchen, I nod toward Lillian washing dishes, her baby in a makeshift crib nearby. She glances up, then quickly looks down when she spots Leopold, her cheeks blooming pink.

"Your computer, Isolde." I watch Leopold stare at Lillian before addressing my mate. "Luna, may I speak with Lillian privately?"

Isolde meets my gaze before answering. "Of course. Lillian, we've got this. Would you like me to watch Felicity?"

"No, thank you, Luna." She dries her hands, scooping up her daughter before following Leopold out.

Isolde wraps her arms around me. "Hope that goes well." Her lips brush mine softly.

"At least they're talking. His fear isn't the child—it's being rejected. Hers isn't his lack of wolf—it's the baby."

She chuckles. "Our pack's quite the mosaic."

"Wouldn't change a thing." I nip the corner of her mouth. "Ready to leave tomorrow? Liam and Sebastian want you to meet Evelyn and Seraphina. You'll adore them."

"Yes. I'll arrange someone to manage the computer setup while we're gone. Meals are planned, supplies stocked. With Leopold and Donovan here, everything's covered."

"Good." I squeeze her waist. "I'll digitize Leopold's paperwork nightmare."

Her laughter rings out as she pulls away. Unable to resist, I swat her perfect backside, grinning at her indignant gasp. With a wink, I head to the office, leaving her flushed and flustered.

###Chapter 0357

I'm relieved Victor had that conversation with Leopold. Lillian's distress was palpable - all because her mate refused to acknowledge her. While I don't know how things will unfold, at least they're finally talking.

Walking back into the kitchen, I clap my hands sharply. "Alright, who here has computer experience?" Only Gwendolyn raises her hand.

"Perfect. You're promoted!"

As I boot up the system, I question her about previous administrative work. Managing staff rotations for both the kitchens and pack house consumes hours I don't have. Gwendolyn's experience assisting her sister, a Lead Omega in their former pack, makes her ideal for this role.

I create scheduling templates and instruct her to coordinate with her sister, ensuring fair shifts and mandatory days off for all staff. We're finalizing the details when Leopold enters, cradling Lillian's infant daughter. His other arm encircles Lillian's waist.

"Luna, may we speak privately?" Leopold asks. Though Lillian bites her lip nervously, she leans into her mate's embrace.

The empty dining room provides perfect privacy. Leopold exhales before speaking. "As you've likely guessed, we needed to address our mate bond." His fingers tighten around Lillian's. "You know my... condition."

Lillian immediately presses closer, her grip on his arm speaking volumes. When Leopold kisses her forehead, my heart swells. She sees past what others might consider a flaw.

"However," Leopold continues, and I notice Lillian stiffen. He adjusts the baby to pull her closer. "The hunters... they experimented on her." His voice turns gravelly. "They impregnated her with some creature's seed. When she delivered, they tried taking the child for more experiments."

Lillian trembles as he recounts her escape - how she fought through beatings to save her baby.

"Did they reveal the father's species?" I ask carefully.

Leopold's jaw clenches. "You mean who fathered her, surely?"

I meet Lillian's terrified gaze. "Maia detected hybrid DNA. The sire wasn't wolf... possibly not even human."

Tears streak Lillian's face. "I don't know what they used," she whispers.

"Hey." I reach across the table. "This changes nothing. Your child is pack. We protect our own."

Lillian's relieved sob cracks something in my chest. "Thank you, Luna. Leopold swore you and Alpha Victor would accept us."

"Exclusion destroys packs," I say firmly. "Here, we celebrate differences. Though admittedly," I add with a wink, "we're still working out the kinks in that philosophy."

Drying her eyes, Lillian squares her shoulders. "I want to contribute. However I can."

###Chapter 0358

"Do you have any experience with kitchen operations or computer systems?" I tease, raising an eyebrow.

"Actually, yes," Lillian replies without hesitation. "I handled staff scheduling for our pack's kitchen before I left." The word left catches my attention—not taken, not captured. Another soul fleeing cruelty. Too many of those lately.

"Perfect," I say, grinning. "You just made my entire week. Ready to start?" I rise from my seat.

"Of course, Luna."

I lead her to the kitchens, where I introduce her to Gwendolyn and Rosalind. "Lillian will be managing the kitchen schedules and sharing computer duties with Gwendolyn."

She hesitates. "Luna, what should I do with the rest of my time?"

I exchange a glance with Gwendolyn, who shrugs. "What do you mean?"

"At my old pack, this only took half the day. What other tasks do you need handled?"

I sigh. "You don’t have to fill every waking hour here. Our pack values balance—time for family, for leisure, for simply living." I’ve had this talk too many times with omegas conditioned to believe their worth is tied to labor.

"But if I want to work more?" she presses.

I consider it. "We recently lost one of our gardeners. Any experience with plants? It’d be good for you and Felicity to get fresh air."

"I can garden."

"Great. I’ll introduce you to Seraphina and Cassandra. They’ll show you the ropes."

Leaving her with the kitchen staff, I head toward the gardens. Passing Leopold’s office, an idea strikes. I knock lightly on the doorframe before poking my head in.

"Leopold." He’s on his feet instantly.

"Is Lillian alright? The baby—"

"Both fine," I assure him. "But I had a thought. You mentioned a pack member skilled in woodworking. Could they craft a crib? Or maybe refurbish one?"

He blinks, then exhales. "I didn’t even consider that. I’ll arrange it immediately. Thank you, Luna."

I wink at my mate, leaving him smiling as I stride toward the gardens. Seraphina and Beatrice are among the blooms.

"Beatrice," I call, surprised. "Didn’t expect to see you here."

"Luna." She brushes soil from her hands. "Sebastian and I leave with you and Alpha Adrian tomorrow. I don’t know when I’ll return." Her voice wavers as she surveys the vibrant beds. "This garden... it’s part of me."

"Alpha Lucian and Luna Evelyn would treasure your skills at Blackthorn," I offer. "Or you could start your own garden wherever you and Sebastian settle."

She nods. "I’d love to visit, if that’s allowed?"

"Whenever you wish." I squeeze her hands before turning to Seraphina. "I’ve found you a new gardener—Lillian, Beta Leopold’s mate. She’ll manage kitchen scheduling but wants to help here too."

Seraphina’s eyes light up. "Having the Beta female involved in our food supply chain? That’s brilliant for the pack."

"Exactly. Catch me at lunch, and I’ll introduce you."

As I turn to leave, I smirk at Beatrice. "See you at dawn. And congratulations—from what I hear, Sebastian’s quite the catch."

Her grin mirrors mine. "Oh, he is, Luna. He is."

###Chapter 0359

The day dragged on, leaving me utterly drained by the time I finally made it back to our room. Leopold had tracked down the carpenter, who’d been so thrilled about building a crib that he’d offered to craft a bassinet too. At dinner, I’d watched with quiet satisfaction as Leopold grew more affectionate with Lillian, while Isolde introduced her to Seraphina, arranging for her to tour the gardens while we were gone.

When I stepped into our room, I spotted the packed bag waiting for me. My backpack sat on the bed, already stuffed with essentials. "Did you pack for me too?" I asked, raising a brow.

Isolde glanced up from the closet, pulling out a few more items. "I did. You looked exhausted at dinner, and I wanted you to relax. You’re still recovering from yesterday. Go shower—I’ll finish up here."

I moved behind her, wrapping my arms around her waist. "Or you could join me. Then we can just curl up and sleep."

She smirked, tilting her head. "Alpha, are you trying to get me wet and naked?"

A low growl rumbled in my chest as I pressed against her. "Absolutely." I tugged her toward the bathroom. "We did talk about experimenting. Wouldn’t want to miss out on shower sex."

Later, we lay tangled together, her warmth seeping into me. "We’re doing that again soon, Alpha," she murmured sleepily.

"Isolde," I warned. She knew exactly what that title did to me.

She laughed, the sound vibrating through her body. "Goodnight, Victor." A pause. Then, softer, "I love you."

"I love you too, my little Alpha."

Morning came too quickly. We grabbed breakfast before heading out, and I called Adrian to let him know we’d be leaving soon. Running was faster than driving—especially through the canyon—and neither of us owned a car anyway.

At breakfast, we met up with Sebastian and Beatrice. She’d have to return for her things later, but Sebastian would drive her. Once ready, we all headed into the forest, stripping and shifting before grabbing our bags.

The run took nearly two hours. But as we entered the canyon, Aurora suddenly halted, her golden eyes scanning the area.

Magnus turned back, and Sebastian’s wolf stopped beside her. I shifted, kneeling beside Aurora. "What’s wrong?"

Sebastian shifted too, his expression grim. "This is where Gregory died."

I ran my hands through Aurora’s fur as she sniffed the ground. "Baby, talk to me."

She lifted her head and let out a heart-wrenching howl. The sound echoed through the canyon, answered by distant wolves from both packs.

I cupped her face, pressing my forehead to hers. "I’m right here. Take your time."

"She remembers the fight," Isolde linked me. "She remembers Gregory and Evander dying here. The vampire. The pain."

As Aurora processed the memories, heavy paws approached. I stood, spotting Dorian—Sebastian’s wolf—carrying Seraphina.

When they reached us, Seraphina slid off Dorian’s back, her eyes shifting from gray to olive as her wolf surfaced. "Sister," she said, embracing Aurora. "I’ve waited so long to meet you. Valeria would love to greet you in wolf form, but I can’t shift right now."

Aurora began shifting, and I yanked a shirt from my bag, pulling it over her the second she was human again.

Isolde stepped forward, eyes locked on Seraphina. "Valeria?"

Seraphina’s smile was radiant. "You remember me?" She took Isolde’s hands.

"Yes," Isolde whispered, tears streaming. "I remember everything."

They embraced just as Theron—Adrian’s wolf—arrived, carrying Evelyn. He shifted instantly, scooping her back into his arms. "Told you I’d bring out the big guns if you couldn’t convince her," Adrian said dryly.

But when Isolde turned, Aurora’s golden glow overtook her eyes, her voice deepening. "Selene."

Evelyn’s emerald eyes flickered with gold. "I’d call you father, but that’s not quite right. You’re still my parent, aren’t you?"

Isolde moved to Evelyn, hugging her tightly despite Adrian’s hold.

"Yes," Aurora answered. "You are mine."

When Isolde pulled back, she swayed. I caught her instantly. "Baby?"

"I remember. All of it."

Adrian nodded toward his pack. "Let’s walk. This is too much for Isolde, and Evelyn shouldn’t overexert herself either."

He carried Evelyn ahead while I lifted Isolde into my arms.

"Victor, put me down," she protested weakly.

I kissed her nose. "Not a chance."

Sebastian and Seraphina fell into step beside us, each holding one of Isolde’s hands.

"We’re so glad you’re back," Evelyn said softly.

###Chapter 0360

The moment we step onto the grounds where Gregory and Evander fell, memories hit me like a tidal wave. But seeing Seraphina and Valeria unleashes something deeper. Then comes Evelyn and Selene—that's when the floodgates burst open.

There's something about Selene—maybe because she's the daughter of my Guardian spirit—that drags every buried emotion to the surface. The weight of it crushes me. Victor carries me without complaint, though I hate feeling this vulnerable. But right now, I couldn’t walk if I tried.

Blackthorn Pack territory feels different from both Victor's pack and my father's. Where my father ruled through fear, Adrian leads with patience and warmth. Pack members of all ages swarm him as we approach, their voices bright with affection. No fear. No hesitation. Just family.

Adrian and Evelyn know every single one by name, asking about their lives as we walk. Victor and I are introduced, but when the attention becomes too much, Adrian smoothly announces formal introductions will happen at dinner.

At the packhouse, a heavily pregnant woman waits by the back door.

"Welcome to Blackthorn." Her smile is warm as she gestures us inside. "I'm Genevieve, Beta female. Follow me—I'll show you to your room. Lunch is in an hour on the patio. Enough time to freshen up?"

"Perfect," I say. "Thank you."

The room is spacious, airy. Victor sets me down, and I turn in a slow circle. "Will our packhouse ever feel like this?"

His arms wrap around me from behind. "It'll be whatever you dream it to be. Just give it time."

I twist in his hold, looping my arms around his neck. "You're a good man, Victor Blackwood." The words come from somewhere raw and real.

He rests his forehead against mine. "I didn't always believe that. But when you say it? I do. And I'll spend every day making sure you never doubt it."

I slip free, grabbing his hand. "Shower. Now. I'm starving."

Downstairs, Evelyn is already seated, Adrian hovering protectively. She pats the chair beside her, eyes glistening.

"Having you here…" Her voice cracks. Adrian's hands tighten on her shoulders.

"Little Guardian, if this is too much—"

She cuts him off, gripping his hand. "No. It's good. Painful, but good. Seraphina and Valeria helped. And Adrian…" She gazes up at him, love shining through her tears. "But you? It's like finding a piece of our family we thought was lost forever."

Adrian looks torn between sweeping her away and letting her have this moment. Maybe she needs both.

"Forgive me," she laughs wetly. "Pregnancy hormones."

###Chapter 0361

Seraphina strides into the room with purpose. "They're real, and they're monsters." She bends to embrace Evelyn first, then me before settling into the chair opposite mine. Adrian takes the seat beside Evelyn while Victor and Sebastian flank me on either side.

The lunch menu offers multiple selections. I glance at Victor. "We should implement this in our packhouse," I mind-link.

"Absolutely," he responds, scanning the options.

Once orders are placed, Evelyn turns to me. "I don't want to overwhelm you, but Seraphina and I already share everything. You should have those memories now. My life was simple, but hers..." She trails off meaningfully.

I nod, the flood of their shared history vivid in my mind.

"We'd love to hear your story," Evelyn continues. "How did you come to bear Evander's Guardian spirit?"

I exchange a look with Victor before surveying the table. Though hesitant to revisit my past, the bond with Seraphina and Evelyn—and by extension, Adrian and Sebastian—feels instinctive. This space radiates safety and acceptance.

Victor's fingers intertwine with mine. "Only share what you're comfortable with, Isolde."

When our food arrives, I decide to proceed. If Seraphina survived her ordeal, so can I. "It's not a happy tale. Maybe better saved for after lunch?"

Agreement ripples around the table. The meal becomes unexpectedly lively. Watching pack members—especially omegas—interact freely with their Alpha and Luna fascinates me. Our pack's dynamics are so different, but Victor and I will change that.

I catch him observing the same interactions. Our shared glance confirms it: one day, our pack will mirror this warmth.

Post-lunch, we relax with full stomachs. Evelyn reaches for my hand. "Whenever you're ready."

So I begin at age ten, recounting my mother's slow decline, holding her as she took her last breath. I describe my solitary years before meeting Victor, our time fleeing danger. Lost in the narrative, I don't notice their reactions until I finish—both Seraphina and Evelyn now nestled in their mates' arms, tears glistening.

"I'm sorry," I murmur, regretting the distress.

"No, no," they chorus, then laugh in unison. "Pregnancy hormones." Their laughter proves contagious.

Sebastian leans forward. "Who's your father?"

"Edgar Winters." The name hangs heavily, familiar to any Alpha.

Adrian and Sebastian exchange a loaded glance.

"What?" Victor demands.

"When exactly did your mother pass?" Adrian asks carefully.

"Just over two years ago."

Their silent communication continues.

"Spit it out," Victor growls.

Sebastian meets my gaze. "You were right, Isolde. Your father took a new mate shortly after. They have a nearly two-year-old son."

The confirmation lands like a physical blow. I always suspected, but hearing it aloud—

My stomach plummets.

###Chapter 0362

The weight of Sebastian and Adrian's revelation hits Isolde like a physical blow. There's a stark difference between suspicion and cold, hard truth. I cup her face, pulling her close until our foreheads touch. "Talk to me, love."

A single tear escapes her lashes. My fierce mate has endured too much too soon. Though she carries herself like a warrior, moments like this remind me how young she still is beneath that steel.

I glance at our hosts. "We need some time alone. Thank you for the meal." Without waiting for responses, I scoop Isolde into my arms, ignoring her startled gasp as I carry her down the hallway.

"You didn't have to make a scene," she murmurs into my neck.

"Every fiber of my being disagrees." The bedroom door clicks shut behind us. "Being your mate means carrying you when your legs won't hold you. Especially when the truth cuts this deep."

I undress her methodically, tucking her between the sheets before joining her. She turns into my chest, silent sobs shaking her frame. My palms trace circles across her back as peppermint and vanilla scent pours from my pores, wrapping around her like armor.

"I loathe him." Her whisper cracks. "For what he did to her. For making me wish I'd never been born."

My lips find her temple. "The world is full of unworthy men in positions of power. But you?" I tilt her chin up. "You're the exception. The reason the Moon Goddess still believes in us."

Her fingers clutch my biceps. "If given the choice, I'd walk through hellfire again. Every scar, every betrayal led me to you."

The kiss she gives me tastes like salt and devotion. Slow. Deep. A vow etched in the slide of tongues.

When we break apart, she nuzzles my cheek. "Thank you."

"For what?"

Her smile is weary but real. "For being the ground beneath my feet when the world tries to swallow me whole."

What follows isn't frantic. It's reverence. The slide of skin on skin becomes a prayer as I worship every inch of her. When she shatters, my name on her lips is sweeter than any victory.

We emerge hours later, fingers intertwined. The fading sunlight paints the packhouse in gold as we find Seraphina and Evelyn on the veranda, teacups steaming between them.

Seraphina springs up immediately. "We didn't mean to—"

"It's not your fault," Isolde assures her, accepting the offered teacup. "Truth doesn't stop being true just because it hurts."

Evelyn's gaze flicks to me. "The others are in Adrian's study. They asked for you."

A young omega appears to guide me. I hesitate until Isolde nods, her fingers brushing my wrist in silent reassurance. The kiss I leave on her knuckles lingers as I follow the retreating footsteps down the hall.

###Chapter 0363

I arrived to find Adrian, Sebastian, and an unfamiliar Alpha waiting. Adrian rose instantly, motioning me inside. "How's Isolde? We never meant to hurt her."

"She's recovering. Stronger than she realizes, but that hit hard. What she didn't mention was her father marked his new mate on her sixteenth birthday."

"Always hated that bastard," the older Alpha growled.

"Victor, meet my father, Alpha Alistair," Adrian introduced.

I stood abruptly. "We haven't been properly introduced, sir. Victor Blackwood."

"I know exactly who you are, son. About time we met face to face." His handshake was firm.

"Whiskey?" Adrian lifted a crystal decanter.

"Please."

Sebastian turned to me, swirling his drink. "You mentioned having matters to discuss. We're all ears."

"The mate gatherings first - seems we're all in agreement." I accepted the amber liquid from Adrian. Its hue reminded me of Isolde's eyes when Aurora shimmered beneath the surface.

"I'll coordinate with Seraphina. With Evelyn on bedrest and your pack needing reconstruction, we'll host the initial gatherings."

"Appreciated. Which leads to my second issue." I swallowed my pride along with the smooth whiskey. "As you saw, my pack's in shambles. Everyone's helping, but we need funds. I require employment to support them. Hoped you might have suggestions."

Adrian and Sebastian exchanged that silent conversation again.

"Actually," Sebastian leaned forward, "we discussed this after visiting your territory. You aware I own Blackstone Enterprises?"

"No idea you had a company. What's your business?"

"Construction and security, coincidentally." His lips quirked.

"Construction?" This could solve our supply issues.

"We've got a proposal," Adrian interjected.

The whiskey burned pleasantly down my throat. "I'm listening."

"We want to finance your pack's reconstruction," Sebastian stated.

"And if you're willing, I'll employ you and any pack members through my company. We'll deduct loan payments from wages while ensuring everyone earns during rebuilding."

Speechless. The generosity was staggering - the perfect solution for rapid reconstruction.

"Why do this for me?" It seemed impossible.

Sebastian snorted, but Adrian answered. "You're family now. That's what we do."

Sebastian shrugged. "Told you he's obsessive about family. Warned you it'd be strange."

"Yes! Thank you! Though I can't guarantee how many will participate—"

"Numbers don't matter. We'll make it work," Sebastian assured.

"Anything else?" Adrian asked.

"One final matter. How do I make my pack official?"

Alpha Alistair stepped forward. "That I can assist with. Requires an application, endorsements from three Alphas, and elder approval. The three here will vouch, and as a council member, I'll expedite it. But you'll need a pack name. Any ideas?"

"I have one, but want Isolde's input first."

"We'll complete the paperwork and add the name later." Alistair moved to Adrian's desk, beckoning me to begin the process that would legitimize our pack.

###Chapter 0364

I realize instantly that Evelyn, Seraphina, and I would have been sisters even without the Guardian bond. Our personalities differ, but our core values align perfectly.

I share stories about our pack—how every member came from abusive backgrounds. Their eyes widen at the sheer number of refugees and the multiple packs they originated from.

"How could any Alpha and Luna neglect their pack like that?" Evelyn asks, fingers tracing circles over her rounded belly. "Protecting them is their sacred duty."

Seraphina nods sharply. "Exactly. I nearly lost control when I thought Sebastian was tolerating omega abuse. My aura forced the entire pack to their knees in pain before he restrained me." She exhales. "Leadership is a partnership. When emotions run high, the mate bond stabilizes everything—not just for us, but for the pack's survival."

"Honestly, I used to despise the mate bond," I admit. "Watching my mother suffer for years, chained to a man who didn't love her... I swore I'd never want it." My chest tightens. "Then I met Victor. The bond isn't the problem—it's the people in it. When both partners cherish it..." I smile, remembering Victor's hands framing my face. "It becomes something breathtaking."

Evelyn leans back, cradling her stomach. "My father always said the mate bond was life's greatest gift." Her voice softens. "He never took another mate. Not even considered it." She meets my gaze. "Now that I have Adrian... I understand. No one else could ever compare."

"Music to my ears, darling." Adrian's deep chuckle precedes his arrival. He scoops Evelyn onto his lap. "How are my girls?" He nuzzles her neck.

"Perfect," she murmurs as his palm glides over her bump.



"When are you due?" I ask just as Sebastian emerges, hauling Seraphina onto his lap despite her eye roll. He buries his nose in her dark curls.

"Six weeks," Evelyn answers.

Seraphina shifts under Sebastian's grip. "I'm a month behind her—midway through."

"Do you know the genders?" I already sense the answer through Aurora's enhanced perception.

Evelyn swats Adrian's arm playfully. "A girl. This one's insufferably proud he detected her scent first."

"A boy," Sebastian states. "And Adrian's right—I knew before the doctors confirmed."

My gaze flicks toward the house. "Where's Victor?"

"Filing paperwork to legitimize your pack," Adrian explains. "My father's assisting. They're leaving the name blank for your input."

###Chapter 0365

Another woman steps out onto the porch. She’s pregnant too, though not as far along as Evelyn and Seraphina, her belly still flat. “Oh, Lunas, Alphas. I didn’t mean to disturb you.” She murmurs, already turning to leave.

“Stay, Willow.” Evelyn says warmly.

I grin. “Twins, huh? Is there something special in the water around here?”

The moment the words leave my mouth, five pairs of eyes lock onto me. Willow spins back around, her expression unreadable. “What did you just say, Luna?”

“You’re carrying twins.” I reply, then hesitate as the weight of their stares sinks in. “You… did know you were pregnant, right? I’m sorry if I—”

Willow’s gaze darts between Adrian and Evelyn before settling on me. Adrian’s eyes burn with intensity. “I only found out this morning. No one else knows except my mate.”

Heat floods my cheeks. “I’m so sorry. I shouldn’t have—”

“Twins?” Her voice cracks on the word.

I glance at the others, who are watching me like I’ve grown a second head. Lifting my chin, I inhale deeply. The scent is unmistakable.

“Two boys.” I confirm.

Willow’s hands fly to her mouth, her eyes shimmering. “I—I need to tell my mate.” She bolts inside before another word can be spoken.

“When is Oberon returning?” Seraphina asks.

“In two weeks.” Evelyn answers.

Adrian’s voice is thoughtful. “You’ll need to visit again when he’s back. He’ll want to document this ability. It might be unprecedented.” His gaze bores into me. “First the hunter count, now this? The Fae King will have questions.”

“I’ll have him bring the chronicles of Aurora’s Guardian lineage too.” Evelyn adds. “My father valued those records.”

The mention triggers a flood of fragmented memories. “I remember now.” I murmur, nodding. “The chronicles—it just came back to me.”

The door swings open. Victor emerges with another Alpha trailing behind. I rise to greet them, but Adrian beats me to it. “Isolde, this is my father, Alpha Alistair. Father, meet Isolde Blackwood, Victor’s mate.”

“A pleasure.” I say, moving to sit—only for Victor to yank me onto his lap instead.

“Victor!” I hiss, mortified by the public display.

He merely smirks. “Seems to be the trend today.” His lips brush the corner of my mouth.

Sebastian chuckles. “If he’s anything like these two, you’ll forget what chairs feel like.”

Before dinner, Sebastian leans forward. “Since your pack will be official soon—have you thought about entering Luna’s Challenge this year?”

Luna’s Challenge. The werewolf world’s Olympics. Held every four years to rank pack strength and track populations. Each continent hosts its own due to the sheer number of participating packs—hundreds, just in this region alone. I’d attended once at ten with my father, cheering our pack on. Missed the next at fourteen, for obvious reasons. And now, here it was again.

I study Victor’s face for his reaction. He meets my gaze. “We’ll discuss it. When’s the event?”

“Three months from now.” Adrian says. “I can provide details, but your participation would legitimize your pack’s status.”

Victor’s fingers tighten around my waist. “We’ve got a lot to decide. This goes on the list.”

###Chapter 0366

The dining hall buzzed with energy as we gathered around the long oak table. Seated among us were Adrian, Evelyn, Sebastian, Seraphina, Adrian's Beta Donovan and his mate Genevieve, his Gamma Nathaniel and his pregnant mate Willow - carrying twins no less. It struck me that every ranked member of Adrian's pack was expecting simultaneously. Alpha Alistair and Luna Seraphina completed our dinner party.

Adrian formally introduced our group to his pack, announcing our intention to establish Sanctuary as an official pack. As he explained our origins, I noticed subtle glances exchanged between pack members - they clearly knew others who might seek refuge with us.

Over dessert, we planned to meet tomorrow and explore how the female Guardians could combine their abilities. Adrian hesitated when Evelyn suggested participating, but she shut him down swiftly. "It's not the Guardian gifts that exhaust me, love. I'll be fine." End of discussion. I smirked - glad to see I wasn't the only mate willing to push boundaries for their partner.

Later, we enjoyed the crisp night air on the terrace before retreating to our chambers.

Isolde turned to me as we settled into bed. "Adrian mentioned you had a name idea for our pack?" I pulled her close, her back molding perfectly against my chest as my arm encircled her waist.

"I wanted your opinion first. Most packs take names from geography or landmarks, but..."

"But?" She twisted to look at me over her shoulder, curiosity sparkling in her eyes.

"I was thinking...Sanctuary. I know it's unconventional-"

"I love it." She cut me off. "It's perfect. Exactly what we represent. The pack will embrace it."

"Really?"

"Absolutely." Her immediate approval eased my nerves. Who knew naming a pack could feel so daunting? It carried the same weight as naming a child - a permanent decision with lifelong consequences.

"I'll confirm with Alistair tomorrow and begin the formalities. Now," I nuzzled her neck, "tell me why the Luna's Challenge tournament spiked your anxiety earlier."

She tensed in my arms. I pressed a kiss to her shoulder, breathing in her scent as I waited.

"My father will attend." The whisper barely reached my ears.

The realization hit me like a physical blow. After all these years, facing her abuser... "You don't have to go. The pack can establish our ranking without you, love."

"Excuse me?" She whipped around in my arms, eyes flashing. "I'm a Guardian. Our pack won't compete for status without me. I'm our strongest fighter - possibly excepting you."

"Wow, one day with Evelyn and Seraphina and suddenly it's all 'I'm a Guardian' this and 'Guardian' that," I teased in a ridiculous falsetto.

She smacked my chest. "I do not sound like that!"

"How would you know? That's exactly your voice. 'I'm a Guardian and Alpha female, hear me roar!'" I continued the playful mockery.

In a flash, she pinned me beneath her, thighs straddling my hips, hands trapping my wrists. "Would you like to hear exactly how loud I can roar, Alpha?"

Thank the Moon we slept naked. My hands found her hips as I slid effortlessly into her welcoming heat. "Every damn day, darling," I growled before thrusting upward.

She arched beautifully, taking me deeper, hands roaming her own body with confident ownership. When her knowing gaze locked with mine, fingers teasing her nipples to stiff peaks, I nearly lost control. My growl of approval vibrated through us both as I guided her movements until she found her rhythm.

Then I took over, pinching and rolling her nipples while she rode me with Alpha female dominance - powerful, relentless. My mouth claimed one breast as my fingers found her clit, circling in perfect sync with her pace. When her walls began fluttering around me, her hands gripped my shoulders as she drove us both over the edge with primal cries of completion.

###Chapter 0367

We collapsed in a tangled heap, Isolde sprawled across my chest as we both struggled to catch our breath. My arms tightened around her as our breathing gradually steadied. "Honestly, I can't pick a favorite," my gorgeous mate murmured against my skin. Her lips brushed my collarbone before she tilted her head up to meet my gaze. "But I do love being in charge."

I barked out a laugh, rolling us onto our sides and tucking her against me. "No surprise there, little Alpha," I teased, pressing a kiss to her hair. Within moments, her breathing evened out into sleep.

Morning brought Sebastian and Leopold's insistence on evaluating Isolde's combat abilities. "Here's the thing," I interjected, knowing full well my mate had zero training. "She was raised human. No formal fighting skills."

Leopold crossed his arms. "True, but Aurora holds not just her own knowledge, but Gregory's as well. And he was one hell of a warrior. That instinct should be in her blood."

"Instinct isn't muscle memory," I countered. "Or physical strength. That takes time to develop."

Sebastian smirked. "You're underestimating Guardian genetics. She's an Alpha-blooded Guardian. Let's see what she can really do."

Isolde shrugged at me, eyes sparkling with mischief. "Worst case? I suck and confirm what we already know."

"Since you've got a talent for pissing off Guardians," Leopold told Sebastian with a grin, "why don't you handle this?" Behind me, Seraphina made a derisive noise.

Sebastian merely cracked his knuckles. "Fair point." He dropped into a defensive stance. "Show me what you've got, Isolde."

She blinked at him. "You... want me to hit you?"

"Hard as you can."

Her gaze darted to me uncertainly before returning to Sebastian. "But I don't want to hurt you."

Leopold's posture shifted, hands on hips as he watched intently. I recognized that look—he was waiting for the spark to ignite. My instincts prickled a warning just as Sebastian taunted, "Sure about that?"

"Positive."

"What if I told you I beat your mate bloody every day for six months?"

Isolde went rigid.

Sebastian circled her, voice dripping with provocation. "That I left him barely conscious after each session? That I enjoyed it?"

The growl building in Isolde's chest vibrated through the clearing.

"Sebastian," I warned. This was playing with fire.

He feinted closer, grinning. "Maybe I'll take him back for round two—"

Isolde moved like lightning.

Her fist connected with Sebastian's gut before he could react. A flurry of blows followed, each strike faster than anything I'd seen from an untrained fighter. Sebastian barely dodged a roundhouse kick, his eyes widening as he scrambled to block her onslaught.

"You touch him again," Isolde snarled, "and I'll rip you apart."

A shockwave of power erupted outward. Seraphina materialized between them, arms spread as the blast sent me skidding backward. Trees at the forest's edge shuddered violently, trunks groaning under the invisible force.

The clearing fell silent save for Isolde's ragged breathing, her eyes glowing with unleashed power.

###Chapter 0368

I rush to Isolde, pulling her into my embrace. "Easy, love. He was provoking you on purpose. I'm safe." Her chest rises and falls rapidly.

"Damn it, Seraphina! I warned you never to put yourself between me and danger again." Sebastian grabs her, his hands instinctively cradling her stomach to shield their unborn child.

"Her power can't harm me, Sebastian, but it could destroy you," she says, then turns to Isolde.

"Like Evelyn's power didn't nearly kill you?" Sebastian snaps at Seraphina.

"That was different—I wasn't prepared then. I am now." She meets his glare before refocusing on Isolde.

"Victor's right, Isolde. Sebastian didn't mean it. He did the same to me—pushed me to anger so I could access my Guardian strength." I can see Sebastian willing her to unleash it, but she holds back.

Isolde studies Sebastian. "We're family now," he says firmly. "I would never hurt my own. What I did to Victor was unforgivable, but you and he are part of my pack. I won't harm him again."

As Isolde relaxes against me, her breathing steadying, Seraphina finally lowers her arms and lets Sebastian pull her aside. "We'll discuss this later," he growls before facing Isolde again.

"Did you feel it? That surge of power—can you control it now?" he demands.

She steps away from me, rolling her shoulders. "I feel it." Turning to me, her eyes gleam. "And it's overwhelming."

Seraphina nods. "It is. But we'll help you master it—teach you how to channel it using our combined strengths." She gestures between herself and Evelyn.

"What exactly did you do just now?" I ask, intrigued by how she and Sebastian remained unaffected when both Adrian and I were thrown back. Thankfully, Evelyn had been seated.

"Evelyn can project raw force, like Isolde just did. I can direct it—shape its path. When we work together, I can guide her power too. So if I wanted to strike you without touching Isolde, even if she's right beside you, I could."

"Prove it," I challenge, fascinated by this ability I've never witnessed before.

Sebastian arches a brow. "You sure about that? My mate hits harder than you'd expect."

"Just a demonstration—and you're certain Isolde won't feel it?" I step closer to her.

"Absolutely. Ready?" Seraphina asks.

"Hit me."

The next second, I'm on the ground, gasping like I've been gut-punched.

"Damn. Impressive," I wheeze, noting Isolde stands completely unharmed.

She helps me up, then grins at Seraphina. "Alright. Let's begin."

###Chapter 0369

Hours pass as I train with Seraphina and Evelyn, learning to channel and control each other's Guardian powers. Then Adrian insists on physical training.

We head toward Gregory and Evelyn's former home. Adrian explains along the way.

"You've mastered your Guardian strength, but your human form needs work. Training both forms will help Aurora too. You might recall Gregory built an entire training facility for Evelyn."

The house comes into view, stirring mixed emotions—joy and sorrow, isolation and belonging. A complicated blend.

Gregory lived here after losing Ivy. Though he had Evelyn and loved her, and Alistair visited weekly, the void of his lost mate never faded. Aurora shares the memory with me.

Victor's brows lift as we approach the impressive outdoor setup. "What is this place?"

"Just the exterior training grounds. There's a full indoor facility too," Evelyn says.

"Gregory constructed it over the years to train Evelyn," I add, recalling Aurora's memories. My fingers trace the equipment. "He worked on it daily while she was at school. It kept him going after Ivy's death. Gave him purpose."

A tear slips down Evelyn's cheek. "Sorry, the memories—"

"Don't apologize." She wipes it away. "Like you said yesterday, knowing something and hearing it confirmed are different. Dad was incredible at training me, and later the pack warriors too."

"I just wish he'd started their training sooner," Alistair remarks, stepping out from the house.

"Hey Dad. We're here to train Isolde and Aurora today, if that's alright."

"Of course. I'll observe."

"You live here now?" I ask.

"Seraphina and I do." He glances at Evelyn. "She's pulling your favorite brownies from the oven in five minutes."

Evelyn's face lights up. "I do have an unstoppable craving for brownies." I catch Adrian's eyes darkening.

"Let's begin before this gets awkward," Sebastian interjects. When Adrian seats Evelyn beside his father, his kiss lingers a beat too long. Some mysteries are better left unsolved.

Sebastian explains the obstacle course while Evelyn chimes in about its unpredictable nature—designed to knock you off balance, forcing intense focus.

"Competition makes training more engaging, Isolde. Any preference who you face?" Sebastian asks.

"I'm training with my mate," Victor declares before I can respond.

Sebastian smirks at Adrian. "Then I guess it's you versus me." He rubs his hands together, eyes gleaming.

Adrian chuckles. "Why not rotate? Isolde needs extended training. We'll each run it three times."

"Isolde, do you remember the course, or should Adrian and Sebastian demonstrate first?" Evelyn asks.

"I remember, but Victor won't."

"I'll manage. Spent nearly two decades in the wild. Unexpected obstacles are nothing new," Victor says.

I shrug. "Alright. And if I recall, the goal is navigating the course and hitting the finish button first?"

"Exactly," the spectators chorus.

Victor and I take our positions. I smirk at him. "Think you can handle me, Alpha?"

His growl answers just as Alistair fires the starter pistol.

In Aurora's memories, Gregory never ran the course himself. He built it, trained on the strength sections, but never attempted the full obstacle run. Completing it now feels like honoring his legacy.

###Chapter 0370

Victor's muscular frame gives him an immediate advantage as he surges ahead using sheer upper body strength. While I'm strong, I lack his specialized training. But what I lack in raw power, I make up for in agility. The swinging logs meant to knock competitors off balance become my allies as I gain ground on him.

My competitive fire burns hotter facing Victor. I can see the same primal drive in his eyes. Each stride pushes us harder as the finish line approaches.

A massive log swings down without warning. I duck just in time, but Victor's bulk works against him. The impact sends him tumbling into the water below. Laughing, I leap to the platform and slam the stop button. He emerges shaking water from his hair like a wet dog, grinning up at me as he climbs out.

"Let's go again," he challenges, eyes sparkling with adrenaline.

Adrian and Sebastian take their positions. The starting gun triggers chaos. These two are relentless competitors, evenly matched in different ways - Adrian's brute strength versus Sebastian's feline grace. They cross the finish line simultaneously in a dead heat.

We spend the afternoon alternating between human and wolf forms on various courses. In human form, I only best the guys when they make mistakes - and even then, Sebastian matches my time effortlessly.

But in wolf form? Aurora dominates completely. She's not exactly sportsmanlike about it either, prancing around smacking the males with her tail while howling her victory. Seraphina and Evelyn cheer her on with enthusiastic praise. By sunset, I'm completely spent.

Luna Seraphina mercifully prepares dinner so we can eat outside. I blame the grueling workout for how easily I doze off against Victor's chest after the meal. He's clearly adopted this as his new favorite position - not that I'm complaining. One moment I'm nuzzling into his neck, the next I'm waking up in bed. He must have carried me miles back to the packhouse from the Sinclair-Grey residence.

The morning brings sore muscles, but we'd agreed on another session before returning to our pack. With Victor planning to leave after lunch, we train indoors this time. The different obstacle configuration proves no less brutal on my aching body. Evelyn gifts me muscle soak salts after confirming we have a working bathtub, instructing me to use water as hot as I can tolerate.

Sebastian and Seraphina accompany us to the canyon before branching off toward Nightshade Pack while Adrian bids us farewell. Despite the physical toll, it's been an incredible weekend. I've committed to continuing training, returning in two weeks when Oberon visits. After that, we'll coordinate schedules around Evelyn and Seraphina's pregnancies. One thing's certain - the bonds we've formed this weekend will only grow stronger with time.

###Chapter 0371

The moment we step onto Sanctuary territory, I can see Isolde swaying on her feet. The past few days have drained her completely.

I managed to accomplish everything on our agenda - submitted the official pack registration, enrolled us in Luna's Challenge, scheduled the first alliance meeting with Adrian and Sebastian's packs, and promised Sebastian workforce numbers within the week.

Not bad for a weekend's work.

Leopold stands waiting at the packhouse entrance, cradling Lillian's newborn. "Alpha, Luna. Welcome home." We shift quickly and dress before approaching.

"That's quite the mating mark you're sporting," I remark, nodding at his fresh scar.

He grins sheepishly. "Thank you, Alpha."

"Congratulations," Isolde murmurs, leaning against my side.

Leopold hesitates. "Before you settle in, Lillian and I have something to show you."

Lillian approaches, displaying an unusual mating mark of her own. My eyebrows shoot up. "You marked Lillian?"

Color floods his cheeks. "I lost control. Even without a wolf, the bond took hold." He pulls Lillian close, pride shining in his eyes.

"We're thrilled for you both. Was this what you wanted to share?"

"Actually," Leopold adjusts his hold on the baby, "we'd like you to meet our daughter. We chose a name that represents everything we've found here. Alpha, Luna, meet Felicity."

Isolde steps forward, letting Felicity grasp her finger before kissing the infant's forehead. "Welcome to Sanctuary, little one."

Over Isolde's bent head, Leopold meets my gaze. I nod. "Spread the word - I have announcements at dinner. Everyone should attend."

"Yes, Alpha!"

Isolde touches Lillian's arm. "A perfect name for such a beautiful child."

"Thank you, Luna."

"I should check on dinner preparations," Isolde says, turning to me.

"I'll assist you," Lillian offers, transferring Felicity to Leopold before following Isolde inside.

Leopold falls into step beside me. "It's done then?"

"Application submitted. We'll have confirmation soon." I move toward his office when he stops me.

"Alpha." He gestures to the adjacent door. "Donovan took your office assignment seriously."

The newly furnished space takes me by surprise - desk, bookshelves, meeting table. "Where did this come from?"

"Nathaniel, the carpenter working on Felicity's cradle, repurposed damaged pieces. Yours and Isolde's offices were first priority. Donovan's furniture is next, then spaces for Lillian and Seraphina - though she'll mostly be at the medical center."

Donovan appears in the doorway. "Alpha! What do you think?"

###Chapter 0372

"You've done remarkably well setting up my office so fast. Color me impressed."

Victor surveys the space with a critical eye. "It's basic for now, but we'll upgrade as furniture becomes available. The pack's been notified to report any spare furnishings to Nathaniel. He's set up a temporary workspace near the packhouse entrance."

"Since you're both here, shut the door. I'll brief you on this weekend's developments—plenty happened, with more to come. I also want your training reports." Victor's smirk and Donovan's snort tell me there's an entertaining story behind those grins.

After detailing the pack application, upcoming tournament, and mate gathering date, I reveal Sebastian and Adrian's construction loan offer—including their plan to employ our pack members at competitive wages.

"That's...unexpectedly generous," Leopold admits, with Donovan nodding vigorously. "This means we can achieve livable conditions before the tournament. How many positions will he offer?"

I explain Sebastian's open hiring policy—a golden opportunity for our pack. We debate salary deductions, unanimously agreeing on 50% as fair compensation considering the housing benefits and current unpaid labor situation.

The training report proves entertaining. Several warriors initially challenged Leopold's methods—until he paired them with his trained she-wolves. Every sparring match ended with the males tapping out. Now the entire pack trains at Leopold's intensity, though not without complaints about next-day soreness.

Before dinner, I collect Isolde for a much-needed shower.

"I've ordered extra desserts tonight—we have multiple victories to celebrate. The pack's reaction should be priceless." Her excitement thrums through our bond as we anticipate the announcements.

At dinner, we join Leopold, Lillian, Donovan and Seraphina at the head table—our soon-to-be-official ranked members. After the omegas serve and settle, I rise with Isolde beside me. The expectant silence confirms rumors have spread.

"Welcome home, everyone!" The pack responds with cheers and laughter. "As you know, your Luna and I visited Blackthorn Pack this weekend with significant outcomes."

I pause for effect. "First, I'm proud to announce your Luna has fully accessed her Guardian memories—along with their accompanying power." The room erupts in applause. Isolde's blush deepens—she hadn't expected public praise. The pack's enthusiastic response proves they recognize the value of a Guardian Luna.

When the noise subsides, I continue. "Second, our inaugural mate gathering occurs at Nightshade Pack in three weeks. All eligible unmated members may attend. Successful pairs may choose their residence pack freely." Another wave of cheers follows.

###Chapter 0373

"Next, I've submitted our application to become an official pack. Alphas Adrian, Sebastian, and Alistair have all endorsed our claim. We should receive confirmation within the next few days." The room explodes with cheers, howls, and stomping feet. "Once approved, we'll hold a formal ceremony to recognize all ranked members. After everyone pledges loyalty, we'll establish our pack link." More cheers erupt.

I wait for the noise to settle. "Isolde and I chose a name for our pack. It's not traditional, but it represents exactly who we are. From this day forward, we'll be known as Sanctuary." A stunned silence fills the room before it bursts into thunderous applause.

I smirk. "I'll take that as approval."

The laughter that follows is warm and bright.

"Now, for the next announcement. While I was away, I also registered our pack for Luna's Challenge this year. The tournament begins in three months. If you're interested in competing, Leopold and I will be holding extra training sessions." Murmurs ripple through the crowd.

"I know this might be intimidating. Many of you fled your old packs. But remember—once we're official, no one can take you from us." A low growl cuts through my words.

Isolde steps forward, her eyes flashing gold as Aurora's presence overlays her voice. "And if they try, they'll answer to me. We don't live in fear. The past doesn't define you. Don't let it stop you from claiming your future."

The shift in the room is instant—shoulders straighten, chins lift.

"Finally," I say, earning chuckles. "Alpha Sebastian and Alpha Adrian have offered to fund the reconstruction of our homes and buildings. Sebastian's company, Blackstone Enterprises, has a construction division. He's willing to hire as many of our pack members as want to work—and pay us to rebuild our own territory."

I glance at the omegas. "Even if you're not strong enough for heavy labor, there's painting, landscaping, and other tasks available. Everyone can contribute."

The room buzzes with excitement.

"Think it over. Let me, Beta Leopold, or Gamma Donovan know by Wednesday if you're interested."

A few questions follow, but most seem too overwhelmed to speak.

Isolde and I sit, listening to the hopeful chatter around us.

Sanctuary is about to become official.

And nothing will ever be the same.

###Chapter 0374

The dinner announcements went smoothly, just as we'd hoped. Later, I sank into a steaming bath, silently blessing Seraphina for the muscle-soothing salts she'd gifted me. The rest of the week became a blur of activity.

Mornings and afternoons were now spent training with Victor and Leopold. Our afternoon sessions stretched to three grueling hours—the first two mandatory for all pack warriors, the final hour reserved for tournament hopefuls. We learned each pack could only send their top twenty fighters, meaning our members would have to battle for the honor of representing Sanctuary. Victor and I exchanged proud glances at the overwhelming number of volunteers—our pack members were fiercely proud of their new home.

On Tuesday, we received the official word. Alpha Alistair verbally confirmed Sanctuary's recognition as an official pack. By Wednesday, Victor informed Sebastian that 250 of our nearly 300 members wanted paid work rebuilding our territory. The number stunned me—virtually every adult volunteered. Victor just smirked. "Our people started with nothing, Isolde. Most fled their old packs with only the clothes on their backs. They understand the value of building something lasting—especially when it provides for their families."

Sebastian agreed to bring his construction foreman Friday afternoon before staying for Saturday's ranked member ceremony. We'd also invited Adrian, Evelyn, Alistair and Seraphina to witness our official pack founding—they'd helped make this possible.

Hunters brought in three wild boars for Saturday's feast. The packhouse buzzed with excitement over hosting three visiting Alphas and Lunas. Isabelle ensured guest rooms were spotless with fresh linens, while Gwendolyn and Lillian reworked Monday's schedules—nearly every kitchen omega had requested rebuilding shifts.

The menu took shape: slow-roasted pork with potato salad (thanks to our surplus harvest) and macaroni salad (using the pasta I'd stocked). Baked beans simmered with boar bacon, accompanied by fresh-baked rolls.

Friday morning, I was finalizing details when two pack members approached. The kitchen fell silent as a woman stepped forward.

"Luna." Her voice made me turn. Every eye watched us.

"I'm Isabella, Nathaniel's mate."

"Pleasure to meet you." I kept my tone light, though the tension prickled my skin.

"Luna, you should know—I was a seamstress before joining Sanctuary. My husband and I restored a sewing machine we found."

"That's wonderful! Our pack desperately needs clothing we can't yet afford to buy."

She smiled, glancing at the others. "Which brings me here. The women of this pack want to thank you and Alpha Victor for giving us a home where we're valued. We know there's no budget for a ceremony gown..."

"The pack's founding matters more than my outfit," I interjected.

Isabella shook her head. "With respect, Luna, we disagree. When you stand before neighboring Alphas tomorrow, you should shine as our Luna deserves." She gestured, and another woman presented a rose gold gown—V-necked, with elbow-length flared sleeves and a thigh slit. Tiny sequins caught the light, elegant without ostentation.

My throat tightened. Fingertips brushed the delicate fabric. "I... don't know what to say."

"Say you'll wear it," someone called.

Tears threatened as women crowded around me. "It's breathtaking. Thank you—all of you."

"Isolde?" Victor's concerned voice cut through the chatter. He must've sensed my emotional spike through our bond.

"Look what they've made." I held up the dress, watching pride soften his features.

He pulled me close, lips brushing my temple. "Stunning. Thank you for honoring your Luna this way."

Isabella beamed. "We made dresses for Beta Lillian and Gamma Seraphina too, but wanted to surprise Luna before Alpha Sebastian arrived."

"Let me hang that for you," Isabelle offered.

"I'll take it." Cradling the gown, I addressed the room. "This means more than words can express."

In our bedroom, I hung the dress with reverent care. Studying the intricate handiwork—likely costing these women their last coins—my heart swelled until it ached.


###Chapter 0375

My heart swells with pride for my pack. Their thoughtful gifts to our ranked females reveal their deep loyalty to our growing community. This generosity strengthens our mission—to build a sanctuary for those with nowhere else to belong.

Sebastian, Seraphina, and his foreman, Donovan, arrive just before lunch. Isolde and I greet them at the entrance and guide them to a private table on the back patio, where we’ve prepared a meal. Donovan and Seraphina join us.

"Dr. Whitmore, how are you settling in?" Sebastian asks her.

"Please, call me Seraphina, Alpha. Everything is progressing wonderfully. The vision for this place excites me—I’m honored to contribute," she replies warmly.

Sebastian grins. "If you ever miss the comforts of Nightshade Pack, our doors remain open."

Seraphina smacks his arm playfully, and he feigns injury, rubbing his chest with an exaggerated wince.

"What are your plans for the pack hospital?" Seraphina asks, steering the conversation.

Seraphina launches into her detailed vision, sketching ideas in the air with her hands. Donovan listens intently, scribbling notes on his clipboard.

After lunch, Donovan and I lead Sebastian and Donovan on a tour of our territory. We start with the hospital site, and I can practically see the blueprints forming in Donovan’s mind. Next, we inspect the half-finished homes, the structures marked for demolition, and the piles of salvaged materials.

Donovan examines the reclaimed wood and bricks with a critical eye. "Impressive work. Reusing these will cut costs significantly," he remarks, jotting down more notes.

We regroup in Leopold’s office to discuss the budget. The projected cost tightens my stomach into knots.

Sebastian leans forward. "Remember, you’re rebuilding an entire pack. Break it down per house—including the hospital and packhouse—and it’s manageable. Your pack will repay this loan through their labor and loyalty."

I exhale. "Alright. What’s the timeline?"

Donovan taps his clipboard. "We start Monday. Two crews—one for demolition, one for construction. Once demolition wraps, both teams will focus on rebuilding. Priority goes to the partially finished homes." He hesitates. "May I suggest something?"

"Of course."

He flips a page. "Beyond essential structures, have you considered commercial spaces? Restaurants, shops—businesses that could sustain your pack long-term. You’re close enough to Blackthorn and Nightshade Packs to attract their members. It’s worth discussing with your people."

The idea strikes me like lightning. Neither Isolde nor I have lived in a functional pack in years—we overlooked this crucial aspect.

"I’ll bring it up at the next meeting. Thank you, Donovan."

###Chapter 0376

Perry left with a promise to return first thing Monday morning after finalizing the plans.

We found our mates outside watching the pups play in the garden. Jeremy was nearby, constructing something new.

"How did it go?" Seraphina asked as Adrian pulled Isolde into his arms.

"Good. Perry had some cost-saving ideas. He'll be back Monday to start." I nodded toward Jeremy. "What's he working on now? I thought he'd be focused on furniture or Felicity's crib."

"While we were out, Lillian found a farm selling egg-laying hens," Isolde explained. "Gwendolyn suggested raising hens of different ages. Lillian located a supplier. This way, we'll have a steady egg supply and eventually our own meat source. Jeremy's building the coop first. Said he could finish it in a day."

I stared at my mate. "Hens?"

Her lips curved. "Maybe a rooster too. We picked a spot far from shifting areas. Donovan's taking Gwendolyn and me Sunday to get them."

"You never cease to surprise me."

Adrian and Evelyn arrived before dinner. I introduced them to the pack. Alistair and Seraphina would come tomorrow—Alistair would officiate our ceremonies.

Nearly every pack member thanked Adrian and Sebastian for the reconstruction loan. As they discussed plans, I noted desired storefronts. Donovan would oversee construction with Perry, so I'd share my "main street" shop layout idea with him.

During dinner, Isolde, Evelyn and Lillian talked pregnancy and pups. Though Lillian's captivity robbed her of enjoying her pregnancy, she still laughed about hormonal changes.

I sensed melancholy in Isolde. We'd never discussed pups. With our financial struggles preventing contraception purchases, this conversation couldn't wait. If she wanted to delay, perhaps Seraphina had alternative solutions.

That night, curled around my mate, I asked, "We've never talked about pups. Do you want them?"

She hesitated. "I do. With you, with this life... I definitely do." She turned, cupping my face. "But would you mind waiting? I'm young. There's the tournament—I can't compete pregnant. Maybe after?"

I nuzzled her nose. "Perfect. I want pups with you, but now isn't right. Would you ask Seraphina about contraception options? At least until we can afford protection?"

She chuckled, pressing closer. Goddess, this woman.

"I'll talk to her this weekend."

###Chapter 0377

Chaos reigns supreme on inauguration day, just as I predicted. The entire packhouse is a whirlwind of activity.

Seraphina Grey and Alpha Alistair arrive shortly after breakfast, bearing formal suits for the men. Clearly, they'd heard about our dresses but knew the boys lacked proper attire. While the pants fit well, Victor's shirt and jacket strained against his muscular frame.

I called Isabella immediately. The talented seamstress found hidden seams to let out, ensuring my mate wouldn't rip through his clothes during the ceremony.

My short hair required minimal styling—just a sleek comb-back that complemented the elegance of my gown.

The back lawn has been transformed. A raised platform stands proudly behind the packhouse, with rows of chairs facing it. The front row remains reserved for Adrian, Evelyn, Sebastian, Angel, and Seraphina. Alistair will join us on stage to officiate.

Victor and I find Leopold, Lillian, Donovan, and Seraphina waiting on the patio. Lillian's teal gown flows to the floor, its delicate spaghetti straps and intricate bodice catching the light. Seraphina wears a muted rose dress with a high neckline and satin waist bow—similar to mine but without the shimmer.

The pack's excited murmurs create an electric atmosphere. Victor turns to me with that infuriatingly smug expression.

"Headcount, Luna?" he challenges, referencing my enhanced Guardian senses.

I inhale deeply. "Two hundred ninety-eight pack members. Six visiting Alphas and Lunas." My smirk matches his.

"What was that about?" Seraphina asks, glancing between us.

"Guardian perks," Victor says before striding toward the gathering.

We process in three pairs: Victor and I lead, followed by Leopold with Lillian, then Donovan and Seraphina bringing up the rear. Silence falls as we approach the stage.

Alistair steps forward. "Ready?" he murmurs.

"Ready," we chorus.

He addresses the crowd, his Alpha power resonating. "Sanctuary Pack, today marks your rebirth. We formalize your hierarchy as your ranked members swear allegiance. Afterward, each of you will pledge loyalty to them and this pack. Does anyone object to joining Sanctuary?"

The silence speaks volumes.

Alistair turns to Victor. "Then we begin."

"Alpha Victor, step forward. Do you swear by the Moon Goddess's power to love, defend, and sacrifice for your pack?"

Victor faces our people. "I, Alpha Victor Blackwood, so swear."

Alistair slices Victor's palm, letting his blood drip into a ceremonial chalice—far grander than anything we'd prepared.

When the ritual concludes, Victor takes my hand. As Alpha, he'll oversee the remaining oaths.

"Luna Isolde," he commands.

I step forward, our joined hands stained with his blood.

"Do you, Isolde Blackwood, swear by the Moon Goddess to cherish and protect this pack, even unto death?"

###Chapter 0378

I repeat the oath, my voice steady. Victor slices both our palms, pressing them together. The moment our blood drips into the chalice, power surges between us. No longer just ranked members in title—this ceremony cements our roles in the pack.

One by one, each member steps forward. They pledge unwavering loyalty, ready to lay down their lives for Sanctuary. With every cut, every joined hand, I feel our pack’s strength multiply. The mind link flares to life, binding us all—even Leopold, though he lacks a wolf. The connection hums between us, seamless.

Alpha Alistair raises his hands. "Now, swear your devotion to your ranked members and your pack. Drink from their blood, and the bond will seal you as one of us."

The process takes hours. Members approach, vows spilling from their lips before they sip from the chalice. Only the youngest, those without wolves, are exempt. Their time will come.

As the final link snaps into place, cheers erupt. Victor silences them with a raised hand. "Sanctuary," he declares, "we run tonight. Shift and claim these lands together. Those who can’t join, follow Leopold inside. The feast awaits with our allies from Blackthorn and Nightshade."

We chose Leopold for this role not just because he can’t shift, but because little Felicity needs watching. Seraphina and Valeria volunteered to help with the pups while their parents run.

I glance around. Parents kiss their children goodbye before turning toward the trees. Victor strips, poised to shift. I join him, shedding my clothes as we leap forward. Mid-air, our wolves take over.

Magnus throws back his head and howls. The pack answers, the ground trembling beneath their cries. Orion bolts ahead, Aurora close behind.

Yips and joyful howls fill the air as we race through our territory. By the time we return, the scent of roasting meat makes my stomach growl. I’d been too nervous to eat earlier.

We shift back, dressing quickly. Twilight has fallen, and the patio glows under strings of twinkling lights. The atmosphere is intimate, magical.

As the pack filters inside, laughter spilling through the doors, I tug Victor to a stop.

"Look," I whisper, pride swelling in my chest. "Look at what you’ve built."

His arms encircle me. "We built this, Isolde. None of it was possible without you. You gave this pack its heart." He kisses my temple. "I’ve never been prouder to call you my mate. My Luna."

Together, we watch our pack—our family—through the glass. Alive, united.

The pack is whole. Now, the real work begins.

###Chapter 0379

Sunday morning saw our friends depart after breakfast. Seraphina and Evelyn couldn't stop gushing about the garden, already placing orders for the upcoming harvest. The market idea was gaining traction - Victoria and Cassandra were sketching plans for an open-air stall on our developing main street.

The hens Grace, Lillian, and Donovan brought in seemed content in their new coop. We'd assigned some responsible teens to care for them daily. Thirty hens to start, but knowing Lillian, she'd already be calculating how many more we'd need. Any surplus eggs would become another revenue stream for the pack.

Monday brought Donovan and his construction crew. We'd restructured the pack into rotating six-hour shifts to maintain operations while rebuilding. Leopold and I spent Sunday afternoon reorganizing teams - construction crews alternating with patrols and pack duties. Even non-shifters had roles now.

Leopold insisted on patrol rotations despite being human. His Alpha instincts proved invaluable - he'd spotted three perimeter breaches already. Meanwhile, I'd put him in charge of training our non-shifting members in archery and knife-throwing. After the hunter attacks, we weren't taking any chances.

Donovan and I handled morning combat drills for the main pack, while Leopold joined me afternoons for advanced warrior training. By nightfall, I barely had energy to pull my mate close before collapsing into exhausted sleep.

Two weeks of relentless work saw progress. Five houses stood completed except for final touches. Using my first paycheck from Sebastian, I'd bought paint - letting each family choose their colors. Some purchased their own, personalizing their spaces further. The pack's exhaustion couldn't dampen the palpable excitement that had lingered since our inauguration.

With the demolition complete, Donovan's crew turned to the hospital. Seraphina oversaw every detail - designing treatment areas for everything from childbirth to long-term care. Her medical expertise shaped the entire layout.

I reviewed finances before our trip to Blackthorn to meet Oberon. The Fae King had been documenting Guardian history for centuries - yes, centuries. The ancient monarch's knowledge could prove invaluable.

Sebastian's payment plan worked perfectly. By staggering supply orders, we'd nearly repaid the loan already. More pack members proposed business ideas daily - a promising sign for our future.

On departure day, Isolde and I double-checked preparations. Our hunters supplemented Grace's grocery haul - eggs now a breakfast staple thanks to her hens. Rosalind had begun preserving harvested fruit into jams, while Seraphina stocked the hospital with her earnings.

Lillian used her wages to buy fabric - Isabella had sewn her, Felicity, and Leopold much-needed new clothes. Everywhere I looked, the pack was stitching itself together tighter than Isabella's finest quilts.

###Chapter 0380

I find Isolde already packed our luggage when I enter our room. These small thoughtful gestures from my mate never fail to warm my heart. With our hectic schedules, we cherish these quiet acts of love—like folding each other's clothes or preparing travel bags.

I've prepared a surprise for her too. Using my saved earnings, I bought proper training gear. She's been making do with old shorts and tees, but Guardian training demands more durable attire. I tuck the freshly laundered outfits (courtesy of Aurora) into her duffel, along with some new clothes for myself.

Victor and our pack have been generous—providing ceremonial knives, chalices, and formal wear for our initiation. But it's time we stand on our own paws financially.

Just as I'm zipping my bag, Isolde slips her arms around my waist from behind. "All set?" Her breath tickles my neck.

"Thanks to my incredibly thoughtful mate." I spin her into my embrace. "How are you feeling about Oberon's visit?"

She nuzzles my shoulder. "A bit nervous, but Seraphina and Evelyn seem to trust him. Aurora remembers fragments from Evander's memories—something about strength trials. If he can help unlock more Guardian potential, it'll be worth it."

We grab our bags and head downstairs for farewells before shifting for the two-hour run to Adrian's territory. Sebastian and Beatrice meet us at the border, escorting us to the packhouse.

Evelyn's noticeably larger belly surprises me—she's due in a month. "Afternoon," she greets from her armchair. "Seraphina and Sebastian just arrived. You're in your usual room. Oberon and Finnian will be here by dinner."

After settling in, we join the group on the patio. The women immediately dive into planning next weekend's mate gathering at Nightshade Pack.

"How many should we expect?" Seraphina asks.

Isolde glances at me. "Around fifty?"

Seraphina's brow furrows. "Only fifty? I thought you had over a hundred unmated wolves."

"We do," I explain. "Some prefer finishing their homes first. The omegas also wanted confirmation they're welcome."

"Of course they are!" Seraphina exclaims. "Mate gatherings are for everyone, regardless of rank."

Evelyn rubs her stomach. "Adrian's bringing about seventy-five. With your fifty, that's—"

"Two hundred potential matches," Seraphina finishes with a grin. "Excellent odds."

Adrian suddenly stands. "They're here." His nostrils flare. "Oberon and Finnian have arrived."

###Chapter 0381

King Oberon embodies everything I imagined fae royalty to be. Towering at nearly seven feet, his hair shines whiter than fresh snow—purer even than Seraphina's. His pale skin radiates an ethereal glow, making him appear vibrantly healthy. Every movement he makes flows with effortless grace, as if he's gliding rather than walking.

Prince Finnian is a miniature version of his father. At just ten years old, he already stands over five feet tall—far taller than any human child his age. Victor and I rise to greet them. Unsure whether to bow or curtsy, I mimic the others and simply shake the king's hand.

"Guardian," Oberon says, clasping my hand firmly. His touch carries an unusual warmth—not just body heat, but something soothing that instantly calms my nerves. "May I have your name?"

Aurora steps forward. "King Oberon, I remember you, though my memories are hazy. I am Aurora, and my human is Isolde."

"Welcome, both of you." Oberon's smile is warm. "Evelyn mentioned you recall Grant reading your Guardian lineage's chronicles. We've brought them in case you wish to review them during your stay."

Over dinner, Oberon explains our Guardian heritage, tracing back to Gideon. Our line possesses enhanced strength and the rare ability to mind-link across vast distances. We discuss Evelyn's inherited abilities—though strong in her, they originate from me and should be even more potent at their source.

"Evander's full potential remained untested due to Grant's paralysis," Oberon continues. "This weekend, I'd like to assess your abilities—including your newly discovered power, if you're willing."

"Absolutely," I agree. "Any insight into my Guardian strengths would help. I didn't bond with Aurora until I was eighteen, and we've had little opportunity to explore our powers."

Oberon nods. "With everyone's consent, I'd also like to continue the training Grant and Evander began—having you draw power from other Guardians to amplify your own."

He turns to Victor. "After evaluating your mate, I'd like to test your abilities as well."

"Finally!" Sebastian rubs his hands together. Victor just chuckles at his enthusiasm.

"We should include Sebastian too," Evelyn adds, glancing at Adrian, who nods. "You know how he loves sparring with Guardians."

After dinner, we arrange to meet at dawn. Relaxing outside, we watch Adrian's wolves dart through the forest. I notice Finnian positioning himself near Evelyn, who doesn't seem to mind—though Sebastian's watchful gaze doesn't miss the prince's proximity. Earlier, I'd also caught Sebastian subtly ensuring Oberon didn't linger too long when greeting Seraphina—the only one the king embraced. The tension between Guardians and fae is palpable.

Sebastian and Seraphina recount a recent supernatural encounter. "King Lucian pledged allegiance to Seraphina and Evelyn," Sebastian tells Oberon.

"The vampire king?" Oberon's eyebrows rise. Both Adrian and Sebastian confirm.

"Note this development," Oberon says gravely. "If vampire royalty swears fealty to Guardians, other supernaturals will likely follow. Keep me informed of any new alliances."

###Chapter 0382

Victor turned to face Isolde and me. His gaze was intense. "You should prepare yourselves. News of your awakening and the formation of your new pack will spread fast, Isolde. Other supernaturals will come."

I swallowed hard. The thought of unknown creatures lurking at our borders sent a chill down my spine.

The next morning, as I packed for training, I noticed unfamiliar fabric in my bag.

"What's this?" I held up the sleek black training gear, turning to Victor.

He closed the distance between us in two strides. "Something practical. Thought you could use it."

My heart swelled. Even in the smallest things, he showed his love. I threw my arms around his neck, pressing close. "Thank you." My lips found his in a searing kiss.

He pulled back just enough to murmur against my mouth, "Careful, little Alpha. Don't tease what you can't finish."

"Later," I promised breathlessly.

"Later," he agreed.

The training grounds buzzed with energy when we arrived. A group of Adrian's warriors lingered near the edge, their attention fixed on us.

I spotted Adrian setting up a chair for Evelyn. That woman defied all medical logic. "Shouldn't you be resting?" I asked, nodding toward the warriors exchanging what looked like cash.

Evelyn grinned. "That's Julian. Our resident gambler. They're placing bets on today's matches."

"Bets on what?"

"Julian!" Evelyn called. The warrior jogged over, clipboard in hand.

"What's today's lineup?" she asked.

He scanned his list. "Main event: Alpha Sebastian versus Alpha Victor. Current odds favor Alpha Sebastian. Then we've got whether Warrior Sebastian can withstand Luna Isolde's aura—odds slightly in your favor, Luna, though not by much since you're untested." He glanced up apologetically. "No offense meant."

His finger trailed down the page. "Wager on whether you and Alpha Victor can mind-link to your pack from here—odds say no. And finally, sparring match between Alpha Adrian and Alpha Sebastian—Adrian's the favorite." He looked up. "Interested in placing a bet, Lunas?"

I shook my head. As Julian retreated, I muttered to Evelyn, "Your pack has issues."

She laughed. "It's harmless fun. Julian knows when to involve Adrian if things get out of hand."

Oberon summoned me. "Let's begin with your aura control. You've mastered the basics?"

"Sebastian helped me find my strength," I confirmed.

"Good." Oberon turned to Adrian. "Who's our volunteer today?"

"Sebastian!" Adrian called.

The warrior bounded over, grinning like a kid on Christmas. "Another Guardian to test my mettle against? Hell yes." He bounced on his toes, radiating excitement. These Blackthorn wolves were something else.

Oberon instructed me to extend my aura gradually, increasing pressure until Sebastian yielded. I eyed the eager warrior.

"You're seriously okay with this?" Who volunteered to be mentally dominated?

"Are you kidding?" His eyes sparkled with challenge. "A chance to measure myself against a Guardian? I'd do this every damn day. Show me what you've got, Luna." He cracked his neck and widened his stance, beckoning me forward.

The air between us crackled with anticipation.

###Chapter 0383

"Alright. I apologize in advance if this gets too intense." I warn him.

Closing my eyes, I reach deep within myself, summoning my Alpha energy. Aurora merges her essence with mine, amplifying my power. Following Oberon's guidance, I carefully direct my aura toward Sebastian. I notice Oberon retreating several steps as my energy expands.

The moment my power touches Sebastian, I hear his sharp intake of breath. His resistance pushes back against my force. "Isolde, can you increase the intensity?" Oberon's voice cuts through my concentration. My eyes snap open to meet his gaze.

"I'm barely tapping into my strength. I'm being cautious not to overwhelm Sebastian."

"Good control. Now gradually amplify your output." He instructs. I turn my attention to Sebastian, watching as sweat beads form on his forehead, tracing paths down his strained face. His jaw clenches as his neck instinctively arches in submission.

"Seriously... this is minimal power?" He grits out between clenched teeth.

"Hardly anything." I reply. "Should I stop?"

"No. Keep going."

I increase the pressure slightly, but the instant his knees hit the ground, I immediately withdraw my energy. He remains kneeling for several heartbeats, catching his breath before rising.

"What would happen if you unleashed your full power?" Sebastian asks, his gaze shifting between Oberon and me. I turn to Oberon with the same question - I've never tested my limits before.

Oberon strokes his chin thoughtfully. "If I had to speculate, it would resemble what occurred with Evelyn when Gregory died. That explosive power surge likely originated from her Guardian lineage. At full strength, you'd probably send him flying across the compound."

"Let's find out." Sebastian's eyes spark with reckless excitement.

"I'm not comfortable potentially injuring Adrian's Lead Warrior and my newest pack member's mate. My control might not be precise enough."

"Then half strength. I'm dying to see your true capabilities." He challenges.

"No wonder Adrian made you Lead Warrior. You're utterly fearless - or reckless. I should speak with Beatrice while I'm here." I remark dryly.

He laughs off my concern. "Half power, Luna. I trust you not to kill me."

I glance at the others for guidance. Adrian and Evelyn simply shrug. Oberon meets my questioning look.

"We'll only understand your limits by testing them."

Turning back to Sebastian, I mentally reach for Aurora. 'Don't let me seriously hurt him.'

'Half strength.' She confirms, moving forward to help regulate the output.

"Ready?" I ask Sebastian. At his nod, I release a controlled burst of energy.

Sebastian rockets backward like a human projectile, barely missing a tree at the forest's edge. The impact zone wasn't limited to him - my undirected energy wave sends Oberon, Adrian, Victor, Nathaniel and Adrian's warriors sprawling hundreds of feet backward. Behind me, Seraphina stands protectively before Evelyn, her arms outstretched to shield them both.

As everyone rises unharmed, their stunned expressions tell the story better than words ever could.

"Holy hell."

###Chapter 0384

My breath catches as I witness the sheer force Isolde just unleashed. And she claims it was only half her strength. In one devastating blast, she sent three Alphas, a fae king, and an entire squad of warriors tumbling backward like bowling pins.

Genevieve starts applauding. "Damn, Isolde! That was insane!"

Nathaniel jogs toward Sebastian, who's limping but already shaking off the impact.

I move with Oberon and Adrian toward my mate. "You okay?" Her golden eyes scan me for injuries, hands already reaching to check for wounds.

"Fine. But holy hell, sweetheart. I had no idea you packed that kind of punch."

"I warned you," she says, flexing her fingers. "This power... it's overwhelming."

When Sebastian approaches, she immediately fusses over him. "Did I hurt you? I'm so sorry—"

"Relax, Luna." He grins, rubbing his shoulder. "I volunteered for this. Worth every bruise to see that display."

"Aurora?" Oberon addresses the wolf spirit directly rather than Isolde. "That was truly half strength?"

"Correct. I channeled my energy through Isolde's Alpha aura while regulating the output."

"Remarkable. We'll need alternative methods to gauge your full capabilities. Unleashing complete power here would level the territory."

"I think we're done testing limits today."

"Are you drained from the exertion?" Oberon's silver brows knit together.

I slide an arm around Isolde's waist. "She's worried about collateral damage to Blackthorn Pack. Let's shift focus." Through our bond, I feel her guilt over Sebastian's minor injuries, though he's healing rapidly.

"Agreed. Now I'd like to assess your enhancements." Oberon gestures toward the training grounds.

I guide Isolde to a bench, pressing a kiss to her temple before joining the others.

"Just to be clear—I can't do what she just did."

Oberon chuckles. "Nor should you. But mating a Guardian alters your physiology. Liam—forgive me—Sebastian has agreed to spar?"

"Hell yes!" The Nightshade Alpha springs up, cracking his knuckles. "Payback time for all those training sessions you skipped?"

I drop into a defensive stance. "You'll have to earn it."

The moment we engage, the differences become apparent. My reflexes are sharper, movements more fluid. Where I once struggled against Alpha speed, now I'm outpacing Sebastian.

His punches—which left me bruised for days during my recovery—now feel like love taps. Meanwhile, my strikes make him grunt.

After thirty minutes, Oberon calls time.

Sebastian massages his ribs where I landed a solid hit. "Since when do you hit like a freight train?"

"Pretty sure that's new." I smirk, nudging his shoulder. "Or maybe you're getting slow in your old age."

"Old? You've got a decade on me, grandpa." He shoves me back.

A year ago, if someone told me I'd be sparring with Sebastian Blackwood in Adrian Grey's backyard, joking with two of the most feared Alphas on the continent, I'd have called them delusional. Yet here we stand.

"Your turn, Adrian." Sebastian wipes sweat from his brow. "Think you can handle the old man?"

Adrian rolls his shoulders. "Doubtful. But I'll humor him."

Unlike Sebastian, I don't have years of experience with Adrian's fighting style. Yet even against his youth and agility, I'm dodging strikes with unnatural precision. He lands a few blows, but none carry their former brutality.

When Oberon ends the match, I confirm the pattern: enhanced speed, reduced susceptibility to Alpha strength.

The implications send a thrill down my spine.

###Chapter 0385

We pause for our midday meal, and I seize the chance to pull my mate onto my lap. The chaos in our pack has kept us apart too much recently, but here in the Fae realm, I intend to make up for lost time.

"Victor, really?" Isolde gives me that exasperated look I adore. I simply grin, pressing a kiss to the tip of her nose before sliding her plate closer so she can eat while nestled against me.

From across the clearing, Seraphina muffles a laugh in Sebastian's embrace. "Told you you'd never sit in an actual chair." Sebastian murmurs something that makes her cheeks flame crimson, his smug satisfaction evident.

Once we've eaten, Oberon proposes testing our mind-link capabilities. "As Guardians and their mates, your range should exceed normal werewolf limits," he explains, leading us back to the training area.

He begins with Isolde. "Try contacting someone in your pack. Focus on someone you share a strong bond with."

Her brow furrows in concentration before she shakes her head. "Nothing."

"Now channel Aurora's Guardian strength," Oberon instructs. "Let her power amplify your connection like before."

I watch as Isolde's eyes flutter closed. A minute later, she gasps. "Rosalind says they're serving lasagna tonight!" She turns to me, amazed. "We had a full conversation."

"Impressive," Oberon nods before turning to me. "Your turn, Victor."

"But I don't have a Guardian spirit."

"True, but Magnus can lend his strength. The mate bond grants you access to shared abilities."

I reach out to Magnus through our link. 'Think we can manage this?'

'Let's try. I'll push everything I have toward your connection. Start with Leopold, then Donovan if needed.'

Closing my eyes, I focus on Leopold's familiar presence. For a fleeting moment, I sense him before the connection fades.

'Switch to Donovan,' Magnus suggests.

This time, the link snaps into place with startling clarity. "Alpha? You're back?" Donovan's mental voice rings with surprise.

"Still in Blackthorn. Testing long-distance linking."

"That's... damn impressive. Anything urgent?"

"Just training. Oh, and I nearly reached Leopold. Is he nearby?"

"On perimeter patrol, Alpha."

"Good to know." I break the connection and grin at Isolde. "Medical supplies arrived for Seraphina."

Oberon's eyes gleam with satisfaction. "Now for the real test. Isolde, try reaching Leopold."

She succeeds effortlessly. "He's definitely on patrol," she confirms.

"Excellent. Now join hands. Isolde, have Aurora channel energy toward Magnus. Victor, attempt Leopold again."

Our fingers intertwine. Sweat beads on my brow as we strain against the limits of our connection. After several failed attempts, a throbbing headache forces us to stop.

"Perhaps this particular synergy isn't possible," Oberon muses. "We've confirmed you can amplify Guardian abilities, but enhancing a mate's innate gifts may have limits."

He dismisses us for the day. "Tomorrow we'll focus on Guardian enhancements before your departure. Finnian and I will document today's findings."

As the Fae king and prince retreat, I nuzzle Isolde's hair. "Think we should warn the kitchen about lasagna night?"

Her laughter is the sweetest sound in any realm.

###Chapter 0386

Victor and I retreated to our room early. Though emotionally draining, this weekend had been exactly what we needed. It was the first time in weeks we'd had uninterrupted time together. Once we returned to our pack, the grueling days would resume.

I kept my earlier promise, finishing what I'd started. Reconnecting with my mate felt electric—like shutting out the entire world until nothing existed but us for those precious hours.

Morning came with renewed energy. We joined the others downstairs for breakfast before gathering to test our combined Guardian abilities.

Adrian had objected to Evelyn participating, so Oberon paired me with Seraphina instead.

"Since you've worked with Evelyn before," Oberon said to Seraphina, "let's see if you can channel Isolde's power too."

Seraphina approached, offering her hand. "Ready?"

I nodded, eyeing the warriors who'd volunteered. Oberon instructed us to divide them—half under Seraphina's protection, half under my aura.

"Start by projecting outward like you did with Sebastian," Oberon directed. "Let Seraphina sense your energy first, then slowly extend it as before."

The sensation was bizarre—like having my essence molded by invisible hands. Oberon had us rotate through the group, selecting individuals at random while maintaining both abilities simultaneously.

During the break, we collapsed into our mates' laps. Oberon paced, deep in thought.

"We've successfully used one Guardian to manipulate another's power," he mused. "But now I want to see if a Guardian can temporarily borrow another's gift."

Confused glances darted around the circle.

"What exactly do you mean?" Adrian asked.

Oberon turned to Sebastian and Seraphina. "You both possess my lie detection ability, correct?" They nodded.

Then to me and Victor: "I want to see if Isolde can pull that skill from Valeria to identify falsehoods."

My eyes widened. "You can detect lies?"

Seraphina started to explain, "It tastes like—"

"Don't tell her," Oberon interrupted. "Let's see if she can discern it independently."

After resting, Seraphina and I faced each other, hands clasped.

I swallowed. "What now?"

"Focus on wanting to recognize deception," Oberon instructed. "Have Aurora reach for Valeria." He turned to Seraphina. "Push your gift toward her."

Our wolves surged forward as I closed my eyes, concentrating.

"My name is Oberon." Nothing.
"I am Fae royalty." Silence.
"I rejected my true mate."

A sudden metallic tang flooded my mouth, making me grimace. My eyes flew open to see Seraphina beaming.

"Metal?" I guessed, wiping my tongue.

"Yes! Lies taste like copper."

"Revolting," I muttered.

"Now that you recognize the sensation, let's continue."

We repeated the exercise until the metallic flavor became unmistakable.

"Before switching," Oberon said, "try drawing from Sebastian's ability too."

Sebastian replaced Seraphina, his large hands enveloping mine. Behind me, Victor growled.

"Hush," I murmured without opening my eyes. "You're my only wolf, love."

Aurora reached for Dorian. I tilted my head. "Sebastian's energy feels...different. Darker than Seraphina's. More Alpha power?"

Sebastian's eyebrows shot up when I peeked. "No idea."

"Describe the difference," Oberon pressed.

I closed my eyes again. "Seraphina's gift flows lightly, like silk. Sebastian's is heavier—thick like molten steel. Dorian's presence is...overwhelming."

+15 BONGS

Victor's hands tightened on my hips. I turned to find him glaring at Sebastian over my shoulder.

"I have my own mate, Victor," Sebastian said dryly. "Not stealing yours."

Victor didn't budge.

###Chapter 0387

Victor's voice cuts through the silence behind me. "This tastes absolutely revolting."

Every head in the room swivels toward him.

"You can taste it too?" Oberon asks, his piercing gaze locked on Victor.

"Unfortunately. Isolde's right—it's disgusting."

I turn back to Oberon. "What does this mean?"

The Fae king's eyes dart between us, his mind visibly racing. I swear I can see smoke curling from his ears.

"Let's attempt another experiment. Seraphina." He gestures for her to approach.

"Try linking with your pack using Aurora's abilities. Sebastian, I want you to touch Seraphina while she's drawing from Isolde. Once she establishes the connection, you attempt it as well."

Valeria reaches out first, tapping into Aurora's strength. Seraphina's eyes glaze over. "I've reached Genevieve. She says Nathaniel is with her."

Sebastian's eyes lose focus moments later, a grin spreading across his face. "Nathaniel says we have the worst timing imaginable."

He turns to the group. "We couldn't do this with Evelyn." His gaze lands on me. "It must be your power."

It actually worked. Evelyn jumps up immediately. "I want to try."

Adrian moves protectively behind her. "Not happening, Evelyn. We don't know how this could affect you or our little one."

Evelyn ignores him, addressing Seraphina instead. "Do you feel drained at all?"

"Quite the opposite. When Valeria was pulling from Aurora, it exhausted me. But Aurora drawing from Valeria? It gave me energy."

Evelyn turns back to Adrian with a determined set to her jaw. "We're doing this. If I feel even slightly fatigued—more than usual—I'll stop immediately."

Adrian's lips press into a tight line, but he steps forward to wrap his arms around her waist. "I'm not letting go. Just in case."

Evelyn leans into him before reaching for my hands. The connection between our wolves snaps into place instantly.

"Whoa." The ease of it shocks me.

"We're family," Aurora says aloud. "I'll always be able to connect to my child, just as Valeria can." I turn to see Valeria has stepped forward again.

"Always," she confirms.

"See what I mean? Bizarre," Sebastian mutters to Victor.

"Completely," Victor agrees under his breath.

"Evelyn, focus," Oberon instructs. "I know you can mind link over long distances normally, but with Aurora's strength, Selene should be able to reach pack members beyond your usual range."

Like Seraphina before her, Evelyn locks eyes with me. I feel the exact moment Selene taps into Aurora's power—Evelyn gasps sharply. Adrian tenses immediately. "Evelyn, should we stop?"

"No," she breathes. "Seraphina was right. Aurora's strength is... invigorating. I feel amazing."

We watch as she concentrates. After several minutes, her eyes glaze over. "Got them. Both of them."

Oberon nods at Adrian. "Your turn. Have Theron draw from Selene and attempt linking with your pack members."

Adrian's eyes lose focus. It takes longer, but suddenly his face lights up. "I've got them."

We break contact, all of us absorbing the magnitude of what just occurred.

"I believe we've severely underestimated the power of Gideon's bloodline," Oberon muses. "Or perhaps, like Valeria's line, it's grown stronger through reincarnation."

"This changes everything," Finnian murmurs.

"Indeed. Finnian and I have much to document." Oberon strokes his chin thoughtfully. "I don't believe the Guardians have ever collaborated like this before. With practice, you'll grow stronger—both individually and collectively. Let's reconvene in two weeks for further testing. In the meantime, practice with your mates to enhance your Guardian abilities."

We agree to meet again in fourteen days. Hopefully Evelyn won't deliver early and can participate. After farewells, we return to our respective packs.

The Guardians are evolving.

###Chapter 0388

The moment we stepped onto pack grounds, excited howls erupted from every direction. Sanctuary was alive with energy, but beneath the cheerful greetings, I sensed new scents.

Seraphina met us at the gates. "Three new groups arrived while you were gone." Her medical coat was stained with blood. "One family needs urgent care—rogues attacked them during their escape from a tyrannical Alpha."

Victor and I exchanged glances. "Where are they?"

"The temporary hospital wing." She wiped her hands on a towel. "It's not ideal, but we've sectioned off a clean area. The parents are in critical condition."

We found the other newcomers first—two sisters huddled together near the dining hall, and a pair of orphans clutching each other's hands. Rosalind and Aurora had already settled them with food and fresh clothes.

Lillian pulled me aside. "We need a proper orphanage. These children won't be the last." Her gaze drifted to the trembling siblings. "The boy hasn't spoken since they arrived."

She was right. Werewolf society discarded parentless pups like broken tools. I made a mental note to discuss converting the east wing with Victor later.

The hospital smelled of antiseptic and fear. Through the glass partition, I saw the injured parents—the father unconscious with a mangled leg, the mother barely awake with deep gashes across her face. Their children sat between them, the little girl clutching her brother's arm.

Seraphina lowered her voice. "The father might lose that leg if his wolf doesn't start healing by dawn. The mother's right eye is beyond saving." She nodded toward two medical students sterilizing instruments. "We're rotating shifts, but..."

I didn't need her to finish. The odds were grim.

Victor pushed the door open. The children startled like frightened rabbits. Seraphina knelt before them. "Remember what I told you about our Alpha and Luna?"

The boy swallowed hard. "Nathaniel and Genevieve," he whispered, pulling his sister closer.

I crouched beside Seraphina. "How old are you?"

"Seven." His chin trembled. "Genevieve's four."

Victor moved to the parents' bedside. The mother's single visible eye widened in terror. "W-we didn't mean to trespass—"

"You're safe here." I pressed my palm to her uninjured shoulder. "Sanctuary exists for wolves like you."

Victor's voice carried Alpha command. "My word as your Alpha—no harm will come to your family here. Rest. Heal."

The little girl burst into tears.

Seraphina immediately gathered both children against her. Over their heads, she mouthed two words to me: They're starving.

Victor's jaw tightened. He pulled the thin blanket higher over the mother's battered body.

Outside, the first stars appeared. Somewhere beyond our borders, more desperate souls were running toward our lights.

Sanctuary would need to grow faster.

###Chapter 0389

A single tear traced down her cheek before she closed her eyes. "Thank you," she whispered, voice thick with emotion. Victor placed a steadying hand on her shoulder. "We'll return tomorrow to see how you're doing. For now, focus on resting and regaining your strength."

Back at Blackthorn Manor, I headed straight for the kitchens to assess the day's progress. Several omegas kept glancing my way before quickly looking down at their tasks.

"Is there something on your minds?" I addressed the room.

Rosalind stepped forward, twisting her apron in nervous hands. "Luna, we were wondering... about the Nightshade Pack gathering. Did you confirm if omegas could attend?"

"Of course," I assured them. "Luna Seraphina was delighted at the prospect of more attendees. There's no need for concern." Yet their tense postures didn't relax.

Victor moved beside me, his presence commanding attention. "What's really troubling you?"

Isabelle answered when Rosalind hesitated. "We're afraid to visit another pack without ranked members present. What if... what if they refuse to let us leave?"

The entire kitchen staff nodded in agreement. I exchanged a glance with Victor before responding.

"That settles it then. I'll personally accompany you to Nightshade next weekend." The transformation was immediate - shoulders relaxed, eyes brightened with hope at the chance to find their destined mates.

Over the following week, Theodore and Rosalind made slow but steady recoveries. Theodore lost his leg in the attack, but Rosalind kept her eye despite the permanent scars marking her face. By week's end, we'd moved Rosalind and their children into the manor as construction freed up more rooms.

Rosalind had been her previous pack's smokehouse master. Victor wasted no time acquiring equipment to establish our own smokehouse, allowing more frequent hunting expeditions with proper meat preservation methods.

News of my attendance at Nightshade's gathering spread quickly. Thirty omegas signed up, bringing our delegation to eighty. Seraphina was thrilled about both the increased numbers and my participation, suggesting we practice enhancing our Guardian abilities beforehand.

Victor remained behind to oversee reconstruction while I led our group to Nightshade territory. The breathtaking waterfalls and panoramic views from the cliffs took my breath away - my first visit proved more stunning than described.

The gathering proved wildly successful with twenty-six mating pairs found - fifty-two wolves united. Fifteen were our omegas. Of the remaining matches, six were warriors and five workers, including our head gardener who mated with a Nightshade warrior. She decided to relocate, eager to establish gardens for her new pack. Surprisingly, most warriors chose to stay with Blackthorn, drawn by the opportunity to build new homes and lives. Their mates agreed readily.

As expected, our omegas were reluctant to leave Blackthorn. Five faced difficult decisions when mated to high-ranking Nightshade warriors. Similar conflicts arose for our workers matched with warriors from other packs.

Adrian, Evelyn, Sebastian, Seraphina, Victor and I convened to establish a solution: newly mated pairs would spend alternating weeks in each pack before deciding permanently.

I insisted both Alphas publicly guarantee no forced allegiances. Additionally, I reminded them Victor and I would return to Blackthorn in a week, offering transport back for any who chose to come. This assurance eased tensions, and all agreed to begin their trial period in their mates' packs.

###Chapter 0390

Isolde returned from the mate gathering with sixteen new pack members. Six warriors and ten omegas. Leopold immediately assigned quarters to the fighters and began their training regimen, evaluating each one's combat skills. The adjustment period was rough—our pack was still young and unpolished. But soon, they embraced the challenge, thriving under the purpose we gave them.

The omegas integrated seamlessly. With our rapid expansion, their skills were in high demand. Some chose to build homes while others explored business ventures. Their excitement was palpable—this was a fresh start.

Of the ten members who visited potential mates, all chose to stay in those packs. Once they saw how Adrian, Evelyn, Sebastian, and Seraphina led with fairness, their decision was easy. Having familiar faces in each pack made the transition smoother.

Construction progressed over the next month. After Theodore recovered, Donovan and Seraphina completed the hospital's framework. Now, with two new medical apprentices from the gathering, Seraphina worked on final details while teaching them.

As housing expanded, packhouse rooms freed up. Donovan repurposed the first-floor omega quarters into a nursery and orphanage. He also broke ground on Main Street, starting with an open-air marketplace.

Thirty hens proved insufficient. Isolde acquired 150 more, plus a rooster. She separated breeding hens from layers, ensuring controlled reproduction.

We held an initiation ceremony for new mates and sanctuary seekers. With increasing arrivals, Isolde and I instituted monthly rites.

Our Blackthorn visit showcased Isolde's growing power. Her synergy with Aurora and the other Guardians intensified. She carefully moderated energy draws from Evelyn and Seraphina to protect their pregnancies. I wondered how their dynamic would shift post-birth.

During training, Aurora channeled power to Magnus. I attempted another mind link with Leopold—and succeeded. We even reached distant patrols.

Isolde checked on former pack members thriving in Blackthorn. She invited them to share experiences at future gatherings, easing transitions for new mates.

Two weeks later, little Ivy arrived during a difficult delivery. Our presence proved fortuitous—Seraphina's healing saved both mother and child. Afterward, Isolde replenished Seraphina's energy.

We'd speculated about the fae-Guardian connection. Then Oberon recognized Ivy as Finnian's mate, explaining his earlier fascination with Evelyn. Fae mating worked differently than wolves'. Seraphina revealed Oberon had lost his Guardian mate a century prior, making Finnian's bond unsurprising.

Evelyn's melancholy vanished when cradling Ivy. Adrian simply looked relieved they'd survived childbirth. Finnian assisted somehow—though Seraphina and Sebastian remained tight-lipped about his exact role. When Finnian returned to Oberon, their silent communication preceded a swift departure.

Luna's Challenge approached. I selected our first ten competitors. Isolde and I would represent as pack alphas. Despite being wolfless, Leopold's strength earned him a spot. Lillian showed promise too. Other standouts included one of Adrian's former warriors, eager to best old packmates. Donovan wanted to compete, but Seraphina needed him to complete the hospital and handle medical emergencies. He'd manage the pack in our absence.



Sebastian and Seraphina hosted a second gathering a week before her due date. Twenty-five new pairs emerged, requiring another reshuffle. Isolde and I agreed to host the next event post-tournament. Our growing community was something to showcase.

As I finalized paperwork, a mind link interrupted.

"Alpha. Unidentified beings at the border," Leopold reported. "They're requesting Luna Isolde specifically."

"Not me?"

"Only her, Alpha."

"On our way."

I found Isolde searching for me. "You heard?"

She nodded. "Let's see who's asking for me." We sprinted toward the waiting strangers.

###Chapter 0391

Victor and I approach the border with growing curiosity. Over recent weeks, both Seraphina and Evelyn have received numerous pledges—mostly vampires, but other supernatural beings too—swearing loyalty to the Guardians of the Realm. News of Seraphina's imprisonment and our victory over the vampires has spread like wildfire.

But the moment we arrive, I understand why Leopold called them "creatures." These tiny, glowing beings are unlike anything I've ever seen. Five of them flit about on delicate wings, no taller than a foot. Their luminescent bodies shimmer as if lit from within, draped in flowing garments woven from leaves. Their translucent forms would be nearly invisible if not for the ethereal glow radiating from them.

"Oh, she's even more breathtaking up close," one of the males murmurs, staring at me with wide eyes.

"And he's so much more... imposing," the female beside him adds, as if we can't hear them discussing us.

"I've always had a soft spot for wolves. So untamed," the other male sighs dreamily.

Their voices are high-pitched, almost musical, reminding me of those tiny characters from that old human movie—what was it called? Munchkinland?

Victor and I step forward, joining Leopold. "I'm Alpha Victor, and this is my mate, Luna Isolde. You've already met my Beta, Leopold," Victor introduces us.

"Lord Alpha Victor," the first male says, executing an elaborate bow despite his wings. "I am Oberon, and this is my sister, Titania. That’s Puck, and the twins are Luna and Stella."

"I've seen this one naked," one twin stage-whispers, eyeing Leopold. "Trust me, he's no Beta with what he's packing."

"Definitely Alpha material," her sister agrees, shamelessly scanning Leopold as if he were already undressed.

"Lady Luna Isolde, the honor is ours," Oberon says to me, but before I can respond, the twins continue their scandalous commentary.

"And the way he makes Lady Beta Lillian siiiiiing," one trills, mimicking a bird's song, "when he takes her to the lake—"

"Or when he does that thing with his—"

"Enough!" Leopold snaps, his jaw clenched.

The twins gasp dramatically. "Was that his Alpha aura? It made me shiver."

"Me too. I'd agree with anything he says, just like Lady Beta Lillian does."

Leopold drops his head, torn between throttling them and laughing.

"Oberon, Titania," I interject, desperate to steer this conversation back on track. "Did you come here for a reason?"

Victor is barely containing his laughter, and the nearby patrol wolves inch closer, fascinated by these bizarre little creatures.

"Oh yes!" Oberon chirps. "We are the Sylvan Fae of these woods. King Oberon has commanded all under his rule to pledge ourselves to a Guardian."

"Our eternal devotion."

"Our unwavering loyalty."

They speak in rapid succession, finishing each other's thoughts as if sharing one mind.

"Sylvan Fae?" Victor asks.

"Indeed! There are many kinds—water fae, forest fae—"

"But we’re the best," Oberon cuts in smugly.

"So you serve King Oberon?" I press, struggling to maintain control of the conversation.

"Of course," Titania purrs, her gaze lingering on Victor like he’s a feast laid out before her.

"I thought King Oberon ruled only the elves," Victor frowns.

"Oh, he governs all fae—dwarves, fairies, the nice ones; faeries, the nasty ones; pixies—"

"Goblins, elves, leprechauns..."

"Those are real?" Leopold blurts.

"Very much so," Oberon says, fluttering closer to me while Titania remains fixated on Victor.

"You wolves are enormous..."

"Massive."

"Absolutely gigantic," the twins chorus, ogling our pack members still in wolf form.

"Yes, we’re small enough that you usually don’t notice us—unless we want you to," Titania explains.

"Like now."

"Or we hide so you don’t trample us."

One twin points to Alistair, who pads up beside me in his wolf form.

"He could trample me anytime," she sighs.

Alistair, ever the flirt, gives a wolfish smirk as the twins flit closer, openly admiring him.

###Chapter 0392

"Observe his coat."

"It appears incredibly plush."

"He carries the scent of pine and earth."

"I wonder if he'd taste like the wilderness." The twin sprites continue their examination of Alistair as he remains seated, basking in their attention.

His golden eyes gleam with amusement as one daringly flutters closer. In a swift motion, his tongue drags from her tiny feet to the crown of her head.

The sprite trembles violently, her wings fluttering at hyperspeed.

"Oh sister...this sensation...divine!"

Her twin gasps. "Me next! Now!"

Alistair obliges, this time savoring the motion. The second sprite collapses against his paw, shuddering with pleasure.

"Exquisite," they sigh in unison, voices dripping with satisfaction.

Funichio's beady eyes lock onto my backside. "Lady Isolde, might I sample your...ample assets?" His tongue flicks out comically.

Victor's warning growl sends Fanella into ecstatic convulsions against his leg.

"Bite me," I inform the sprite dryly, "and my mate will demonstrate proper biting technique on your neck."

Funichio's eyes light up. "Promise?" He stage-whispers, "I'm quite versatile. Sir Alpha could sink his fangs anywhere..."

Nathaniel chokes on laughter as Victor's face contorts in horror.

The twins have already swarmed Alistair, tiny hands buried in his fur. "So velvety!"

"Like sunlight made tangible!" They burrow deeper until—

Alistair's entire body jerks. A strangled growl escapes him.

Victor's nostrils flare. "Did you just climax in mixed company?"

Through our link, Alistair stammers. "I—that wasn't—their tiny hands—"

"Not his fault," one twin chirps, emerging flushed.

"We reciprocated the pleasure," the other adds smugly.

"Perhaps more licks later?"

"Frequent licks!"

Victor's patience visibly frays. I hastily intervene. "Your home is in these woods?"

"We observe."

"We listen."

"Wolves fascinate us."

"Yet they terrify us."

"You needn't fear our kind," I assure them. "King Oberon is our ally. But heed this—never toy with mated wolves."

"Never!"

"We revere true bonds."

One twin sighs mournfully. "We crave a wolf's devotion."

"To be cherished eternally," her sister echoes. Poor Alistair has no idea what he's awakened.

Victor changes tactics. "Have you seen other supernaturals?"

"Vampyres."

"Filthy leeches."

"Blood thieves."

"But they ignore us."

"Our essence isn't sanguine."

Their ping-pong dialogue sparks a migraine.

Nathaniel probes further. "Others?"

"Humans with weapons. Your pack scared them away."

Fanella nods gravely. "Hunters."

"Arrows. Blades."

"Murderous vermin."

"Would you alert us to future hunter activity?" I ask.

Funichio bows dramatically. "We shall guard the Guardian's domain!" Not precisely what I requested, but it'll suffice.

"And in return?" I brace myself.

His grin turns predatory. "Regular wolf visits."

Exactly what I dreaded.

###Chapter 0393

Damn woodland sprites. Never encountered them before, and I could've happily lived my whole life without this disaster. Now Isolde's invited them to hang out with our wolves. I'll have to double the patrols—make sure no one sneaks off for some quick fun with these creatures.

"Do you think wolves could actually mate with sprites?" Isolde asks as we walk back to the packhouse. Alistair had shifted—much to the delight of those sprite twins—and asked if they wanted to meet him at the pond after his shift. I’m surprised they managed to speak through all that drooling.

"No clue. Wouldn’t have guessed a ten-year-old fae prince would be mated to a Guardian’s daughter either, so what do I know?" I grumble, still irritated by the whole situation.

Isolde grabs my hand, stopping me. Her fingers slide into my hair, massaging my temples. "Let it go, love. They’re harmless. Like being stuck in a room full of toddlers—exhausting, but not dangerous."

I close my eyes, letting her touch soothe the headache threatening to split my skull. Leaning down, I press my forehead to hers before pulling her hips flush against mine. "Thanks, baby."

"So, Alpha." My eyes snap open, darkening at her tone. "Think you can make me shiver like those sprites did with just one lick?"

I laugh. "Sweetheart, when I lick you, I’m taking my time. I want to savor every bit of you." My nose brushes hers before I whisper in her ear, "But don’t worry, little Alpha. By the time I’m done, you’ll be trembling on my tongue." The goosebumps rising on her skin and the shiver down her spine are my reward.

We join the warriors for tournament training. I’ve narrowed the finalists to twenty, but half still need to be cut by week’s end. Every one of them is fighting hard for a spot. Leopold and I have been sparring with them daily, assessing their skills. Today, with Leopold on patrol, I’m pitting them against Isolde.

Sure, the training’s important, but I won’t lie—watching my mate take down every last warrior is pure entertainment. She’s every inch an Alpha female: strong, agile, ruthless.

Our mate is fire. Magnus purrs in my head.

Damn right. Look how easily she dropped that one. Didn’t even break a sweat.

She works through them one by one. A few stand out—lasting more than thirty seconds against her. They’re definitely in. The ones who didn’t last ten? Cut. By the end, I’m down to fifteen contestants for eight spots.

Dinner in the dining hall is lively. The space has been upgraded, with Nathaniel crafting longer, more elaborate tables. It’s coming together—another sign our pack is thriving.

Mid-meal, Theodore—the warrior who lost his leg—approaches. "Alpha, got a minute?"

"Of course. Want to join us, or is this private?"

He glances back at his family, his mate nodding. "Your family’s welcome too," Isolde tells him.

Hesitant, he motions them over. While Isolde and Lillian chat with the kids, I focus on Theodore and Rosalind. "What’s on your mind?"

"Well, Alpha… My mate mentioned you built her a smokehouse when you heard she knew how to cure meat. That it’d help the pack."

I nod. "Right. Something wrong with it?"

"No, it’s perfect. But if we’re staying—and we want to—I’d like to contribute too."

"What’re you thinking?"

He exchanges a look with Rosalind. "Hot sauce."

I blink. "Say again?"

"In my old pack, I made it. Sold well—not just to wolves, but humans too. We’ve got the garden space. Just need to plant peppers and a dedicated area to process them. Could bring in solid income for minimal upfront cost."

"You’ve done this before? Know what you’re doing?"

"He was the best," Rosalind cuts in. "Everyone said so."

"It’s a great idea, even if we only use it internally. But tell me—if you were so valuable to your last Alpha, why leave?"

They share another glance. "He taxed us into the ground. I was bringing in thousands for him monthly, but my family barely ate."

"We don’t think you’re like that, Alpha. Happy to pay our share, but we want to live off our work."

"Fair point. I’ll need to consider how to structure pack taxes." I’ll consult Adrian and Sebastian—see how their packs handle it. "What do you need to start?"

"Pepper plants."

"Easy."

After dinner, Isolde heads to the kitchens while I check on patrols. The report isn’t good—hunters have been spotted in the neighboring woods.

As I prepare to shift, a disheveled Alistair stumbles toward me, looking drunk. I rush over. "Alistair! You okay? What happened?" His hair’s a mess, clothes wrinkled, face smudged.

He grabs my shoulders, eyes wide. "Alpha! I think I’m in love!" Then he staggers off.

Damn sprites.

###Chapter 0394

The news came just days after our encounter with the Sylvan Fae. Seraphina had given birth—a strong, healthy boy named after her father and Gregory, who'd been like a second father to her.

Victor kept me busy sparring with tournament hopefuls until he finalized the roster. Two warriors from Adrian's pack, two from Sebastian's, and sixteen from ours made the cut. Victor was already preparing for our week-long absence. The Luna's Challenge spanned four days, plus travel time, concluding with an awards ceremony for the top five packs.

Through mind links, Victor coordinated with Adrian and Sebastian. Our packs would support each other if needed. Both Alphas were leaving their Gammas in charge. Though we hadn't appointed a Lead Warrior, Adrian was bringing Sebastian while Sebastian brought his newly promoted one.

Day one would feature warriors. Lead Warriors and Gammas fought on day two, Betas on day three, Alphas and Guardians on day four. Single elimination rounds each day culminated in final battles. Winners earned points determining pack rankings. Bonus points rewarded exceptional performances—fighting through injuries, instant knockouts. We'd sit out day two, but as first-time competitors, top five wasn't expected. Victor and I aimed for top three, knowing Adrian and Sebastian's packs would dominate. As Guardian, I needed to prove our pack's strength.

Nearing the event, anxiety coiled in my gut. How would I react seeing my father after all these years? Would he even recognize me? Did his new mate know about me or my mother? Maybe he wouldn't show. I could hope.

I was discussing Joel's pepper plants when twin streaks of light shot across our territory toward the packhouse. "Luna! Two fae breached our patrols!" the border guard mind-linked.

"I see them." I sprinted toward the commotion, hearing shrill cries for Alistair. The twins.

They crashed into me the moment I intercepted them. "Lady Luna Isolde! Hunters! In the woods! They took Elara!"

Alistair burst from the packhouse—he'd been meeting them daily. "Oberon's children!" He caught them as they dove at his neck. "What happened?"

"Metal men! They shook Elara! Tore her wing! Threw her in a cage!"

Their words chilled me. Sylvan Fae didn't lie. I tilted my head and unleashed a rallying howl before turning to Alistair. "Get them to the bunker."

Mid-leap, I shifted. Behind me, Alistair soothed the twins as warriors converged from all directions. Ninety-three panicked fae swarmed our border when we arrived. I shifted back, spotting Oberon.

"Oberon! Why is your entire court here?"

"Lady Luna!" The fae king trembled. "We sent Luna and Stella, fearing you'd attack us if we trespassed. The hunters have cages. They're torturing our kind!"

Magnus skidded to my side as I surveyed the terrified fae. "Do you need sanctuary?"

Relief washed over Oberon's face. "Yes, Lady Luna. They've taken so many already..."

###Chapter 0395

My voice cuts through the chaos. "All sprites seeking refuge are welcome on our lands. As Guardian of the Realm, I swear my pack and I will protect you. Head to the packhouse—someone will guide you to the bunkers. Now, move!"

Nearly a hundred sprites surge past our borders, their tiny forms darting toward safety.

Alistair's wolf, Orion, joins us, his golden eyes sharp. "Who is Elara?" he mind-links.

"A friend of theirs," I reply. "Another sprite."

My gaze sweeps the battlefield. "Listen up. We have sprites held captive—injured, caged. Alistair, Tobias, Reginald, you're on rescue. Find them and get them out. The rest of us? We're ending these hunters."

I leap, shifting midair. My paws hit the ground as Aurora, my wolf, flares her nostrils. The scents hit me instantly.

"Thirty-three hunters," I relay through the mind link, opening it to the pack. "Five sprites—separate cages, all wounded. Be careful."

Victor's voice is steel. "Flank them."

Our warriors split, encircling the enemy. A few stragglers linger outside the formation. Aurora and I move like shadows, silencing them before they can scream.

Then—chaos.

Magnus throws back his head in a howl just as bullets and arrows rain down. We charge.

Through the fray, I spot Alistair's team working frantically at the cages. One sprite—Elara—lies frighteningly still. No time to dwell. I refocus, tearing into the hunters with fang and claw.

Magnus and Aurora carve through them like a storm. Arrows laced with wolfsbane sting, and a bullet grazes my shoulder. Pain flares, but it's nothing. We fight harder.

Then I see it—a hunter taking aim at Alistair as he pries open a cage.

Aurora lunges. Her jaws clamp around the hunter's arm, wrenching it free with a sickening pop. Blood sprays. His scream is cut short as Magnus crushes his throat.

The battle ends as swiftly as it began.

Most hunters are dead. Alistair and Reginald sprint back toward pack lands, carrying the freed sprites—all but one.

Fenrir whines, nudging Elara's limp form. Her heartbeat is faint, fluttering like a dying ember. I shift, reaching into the cage.

Her injuries are severe. One wing is torn from her back. Her skin is ice-cold.

I lift her onto Fenrir's back, watching as she instinctively curls into his warmth.

"She's freezing, Luna," Tobias mind-links.

"Get her to Seraphina. Now. Go slow—don't let her fall."

As Fenrir lopes away, Victor appears beside me. "Alive?"

"Barely." I scan the carnage. "Are we clear?"

"Every last one." His eyes drop to my shoulder. "You're hit."

I glance at the wound. The bullet is still lodged there. "It can wait. Let's secure the perimeter and dispose of these bodies before more come sniffing."

Victor nods, but his gaze lingers. "Don't push it too long."

I don't plan to. But first—we clean up the mess.

###Chapter 0396

I shout for reinforcements.

Pack members rush to help the wounded.

Several wolves lie unconscious. Bullet wounds slow their healing. Only one appears critically injured—I order him transported back immediately.

Isolde concerns me, but she shows no distress from the shoulder wound. Still, I won't relax until it's removed.

We both took wolfsbane arrows, yet I feel no poison effects. Just slower healing.

Now I understand Adrian and Sebastian's awe when discussing Guardian mate advantages.

My strength has doubled. My recovery speed astonishes me. After such a battle, exhaustion should cripple me. Instead, energy surges through my veins.

The pack hospital descends into chaos upon our arrival.

Not just from the influx of wounded.

Fenrir, Tobias's wolf, stands guard over something—snarling at approaching medics. Isolde pushes forward as Seraphina pleads with the protective wolf.

"What's happening?" I demand, joining Isolde.

Fenrir stops growling but doesn't yield.

"Tobias brought in a severely injured sylvan fae," Isolde explains. "She panicked when our medics approached. Tobias shifted—Fenrir's been shielding her ever since."

The tiny fae clings to life. Fenrir positions himself so his tail brushes her hand—she grips it like a lifeline.

"Fenrir, stand down," Magnus commands.

The wolf whines, resisting the Alpha order.

Isolde cups Fenrir's muzzle. "You know I won't harm her. Let me through."

Another whine, but he relents.

The fae twins hover nearby, clutching each other anxiously.

This fae is the smallest I've seen—whether child or simply petite, I can't tell. Fenrir shadows Isolde, ready to intervene.

"Your name's Elara, yes?" Isolde strokes the fae's cheek gently.

A sniffle. "Yes," comes the whisper.

"You're hurt. Our Gamma, Lady Seraphina, needs to examine you." Isolde uses formal fae address.

"She can't fix me." The words barely reach my ears. "They tore off my wing."

A tear glistens down her face.

Other fae glow radiantly—Elara's light flickers like a dying ember. Is this how their kind perishes? When their inner light extinguishes?

I stride to the nearest office and dial an unfamiliar number.

A deep voice answers.

"This is Alpha Victor. I need King Oberon—it's life or death."

Silence stretches. Just as I think the call dropped, a familiar voice responds.

"Alpha Victor?"

Finnian.

"Yes. My father couldn't come, but our scout said this was urgent."

"Hunters attacked my pack today." I cut to the chase.

"Is Seraphina safe? Was she hurt?"

"No, they weren't present during the attack." His relieved exhale carries through the line.

"But a sylvan fae suffered grave injuries. A wing ripped off. Her light... it's fading. I believe she's dying."

"We're too distant to assist. Does she have a mate?"

"None have come forward."

A heavy sigh. "Then nothing can be done. Only a mate can heal such wounds."

###Chapter 0397

"What are you implying?"

"Woodland sprites are delicate beings. When they suffer such brutal injuries, their will to live shatters. Their light fades unless someone reignites their hope."

A realization strikes me. "What if it's a werewolf? Can they bond with our kind?"

"Not in recent times. The hostility between fae and wolves made it impossible. But centuries ago, such unions were common."

"How would it work now? She's too injured for a traditional marking."

"He'd have to tend her wounds with his tongue." Oh moon goddess. Alexander unknowingly bonded those twins.

"Once she recovers, he can mark her properly—if she consents. But right now, he must show acceptance of her broken state through gentle care."

"Thank you, Finnian."

"Alert me if we lose one of our fragile ones."

"I will." I turn to leave.

Back in the infirmary, Isolde has convinced Tobias to let Seraphina examine Elara. His wolf Fenrir remains pressed against the sprite, nudging her with desperate whimpers.

"Leopold. Private word. Now." I mind-link the warrior.

Tobias lifts his head. "Can this wait, Alpha?"

"I might save her. But you need full disclosure before acting."

Tobias shifts back. Leopold cradles Elara's face. "Stay with me. One minute." His kiss lingers on her forehead before he joins me.

In my office, I face him. "Finnian suggested a solution."

"Then let's—"

"It requires mating her." My gaze holds his.

He stiffens. "My mate?"

"Yes. Fae-wolf bonds were once common. Nearly a century has passed since the last." Except Alexander's secret union.

"Fenrir's protective instincts suggest willingness. But know this—she'll need lifelong care. Once healed, you may mark her traditionally if she agrees."

"Victor." Isolde's link crackles with urgency. "Her light's fading fast."

"Decide now, Leopold."

"Fenrir and I claim her." His growl vibrates through the room as he shifts mid-sprint.

When we return, Elara's glow barely flickers. Fenrir's mournful howl shakes the walls.

"Lick her wounds," I order.

The twins gasp, whispering about wolf bonds.

Fenrir's tongue traces the ravaged wing stump. No response. He whines, persisting with tender strokes.

Then—a twitch.

Her hand rises weakly to his muzzle as his tongue swipes her cheek. The faintest golden light pulses between them.

Tobias shifts back, gathering her against his chest as her glow strengthens. The twins' astonished chatter fills the healing chamber.

###Chapter 0398

The entire situation between Tobias and Elara was both tense and surreal. I'm grateful to my mate, who despite his general dislike for the Sylvan Fae, still contacted King Oberon to find a way to save Elara.

As Tobias leaves with Elara, taking her to his room in the packhouse to recover, I turn to Adrian. "Have I told you recently how incredible you are?" I murmur, pressing closer. "And how lucky I am to have you?"

He pulls me against his chest. "I love you too," he growls, "but you won’t feel so lucky when I tell you I want that damn silver bullet out of your shoulder—now. No more delays."

I laugh softly. "Still lucky." My gaze sweeps the room, searching for any available medics. While we were dealing with Elara, they’d been tending to the injured pack members.

Seraphina steps forward. "I can remove it." She leads us to a private room. I sit on the edge of the bed as she prepares her tools. Leopold enters just as she begins extracting the bullet.

"Fifteen injured wolves," he reports. "Twelve will be released tonight. Three need to stay—silver poisoning." His frown deepens as he watches Seraphina work. "How?"

The truth is, the longer the silver stayed in my flesh, the more it burned. Now that it's out, my healing should kick in fast, and the lingering fatigue from the wolfsbane will fade.

"Perks of being a Guardian," I say, echoing the phrase I’ve grown used to among my sisters.

"How are the other fae?" I ask.

"They’ll recover. Minor injuries. They’re already chattering excitedly about riding wolves." Leopold smirks. "The ones in the bunkers kept the pups entertained too."

"We should reassure them they can always seek refuge here," I say. "They may have offered to guard our lands, but honestly? It’s our duty to protect them. They’re not fighters—they’re watchers. Gentle souls."

I watch as Adrian absorbs this. Our lives have undeniably changed. And apparently, wolves and fae mating isn’t just possible—it was once common. Maybe we should invite them to our next pack gathering.

Wolves are dominant by nature, submitting only within pack hierarchy. The fae? No dominance in them at all. They seem to thrive under protective, possessive wolves—where other supernaturals might rebel.

The thought makes me reflect on my bond with Victor. We’re both Alphas, regardless of his Beta origins. We lead. We command. Yet somehow, we balance. Neither of us forces dominance where it doesn’t belong. When I take charge, he yields—and vice versa. Maybe it’s trust. I trust him to choose what’s best for us, for the pack. He trusts me the same way.

"What’s that look?" Adrian murmurs, closing the distance. His hands settle on my hips, pulling me flush against him. From the corner of my eye, I see Seraphina and Leopold slip out silently.

"I was thinking how perfectly we fit," I admit. "You never suppress my strength. For two Alphas, we’re surprisingly good at not clashing."

"We agree on almost everything—except the fae." His thumb brushes my jaw. "Our goals align. The Moon Goddess knew what she was doing when she led me to you. I never imagined building something this strong, this fast."

I rise onto my toes, capturing his lips. The kiss deepens instantly, his tongue sliding against mine. I let him take control, savoring the possessiveness in every stroke.

When my arousal perfumes the air, his chest vibrates with a low growl. "Little Alpha," he warns, "if we don’t stop now, I’ll take you right over this bed."

I drag my lips to his ear. "Do it."

In a flash, he spins me around, bending me forward. One hand pins me down while the other rucks up my shirt. His palm glides down my spine, slow and deliberate. I glance over my shoulder, watching his gaze darken as it follows his touch.

I arch, offering myself. His fingers trail lower, teasing. "So ready for me."

"Yes," I breathe.

"Can you stay quiet?"

I nod.

"Prove it." Two fingers sink into me, wrenching a whimper from my throat.

His eyes lock onto where his fingers move. "Beautiful. Mine." The growl in his voice makes me clench around him.

Realizing silence will be impossible with shifters just beyond the door, I grab my discarded shirt, biting down on the fabric.

I rock against his hand, demanding more. He obliges, driving me to the edge. Just as my climax hits, he withdraws, shoves down his shorts, and fills me in one thrust.

"Remember," he rasps, gripping my hips, "only I hear you."

His pace is relentless. I clutch the sheets, cresting again and again until I’m a trembling mess.

"Mine!" he snarls, sealing the claim with his teeth in my neck. Pleasure detonates as he spills inside me.

Panting, he licks the mark closed, his body heavy over mine.

"Yes," I sigh, bliss-drunk. "I’m yours. And you’re mine."

###Chapter 0399

The moment Evelyn and I step back into the packhouse, the sylvan fae swarm around us with overwhelming gratitude. Isolde assures them they’re always welcome, especially if they’re in danger or need help.

Before they vanish into the trees, I pull Oberon aside. "Keep watching for hunters. Alert us immediately if you see anything." He nods eagerly before darting off to rejoin his group. I spot the twin fae—Luna and Stella—hovering near the back of the packhouse until Alistair appears, joining them before they all disappear into the forest.

I’ll have to talk to him soon. He needs to understand the weight of his actions, what it means to those two. Fae might be infuriating, but they’re fragile. And as Alpha, it’s my duty to protect them, no matter how much they test my patience.

"Leopold. Donovan. My office. Now."

Our pack’s growth has brought improvements—including actual furniture. Jeremy’s new shop is flooded with orders, forcing him to hire three more workers. He still barely keeps up.

They settle into the cushioned chairs around my new table. "We need intel on these hunters. This is the second time they’ve trespassed. What do we know?"

Leaning forward, Leopold exhales. "Not much. They’re ghosts. Hard to track since we don’t live among humans. But whispers say they’re planning something big."

Donovan’s jaw tightens. "Rumors say they’ve taken wolves captive. Probably experimenting on them. Or worse."

"Dig deeper. I’ll check with Adrian and Sebastian. Sebastian’s company operates in the city—he might’ve heard something." Though I doubt it. If he had, he would’ve told us.

After updating them on the skirmish and confirming they know just as little, I shift the topic. "What’s your pack tax structure?"

Adrian crosses his arms. "Twenty percent. Most comes from businesses on our land. The funds go back into the pack—gatherings, food, orphans, improvements. I don’t overspend, and neither do my ranked members."

Sebastian’s approach differs. "My main income is the company. Since it’s human-run, we already pay taxes. I only take an extra ten percent from the pack. Still substantial, but like Adrian, I don’t waste it."

We finalize travel plans for Luna’s Challenge, agreeing to leave a day early and coordinate pack security in each other’s absence. Then I end the call.

Later, I corner Alistair. I relay Finnian’s warning—he must choose. Either claim the twins as mates or let them go. His calm reaction surprises me. Maybe his wolf is willing to accept them.

And it seems he’d have to take both. A package deal. Uncommon for wolves, but not unheard of—especially with twins.

As the week passes, I finalize construction plans with Donovan, authorizing him to handle finances in my absence. I also warn him about the hunters and fae. Some wolves built homes near the border; they’ll likely encounter the fae. If they become a nuisance, he’s to contact Alistair.

###Chapter 0400

Two days before our departure, I spot Theodore entering the dining hall with Elara nestled against his neck. It's his first appearance outside his quarters since the hunters' attack. Elara's glow has returned, though her wing may never fully heal.

"Isolde, you and Elara should join us," Seraphina suggests, gesturing to the empty seats beside us.

Theodore murmurs something to Elara, who nods before they approach.

"How are you feeling, Elara?" Seraphina asks as they settle. Theodore adjusts her to perch on his shoulder like a tiny bird—except she's sitting, her head barely reaching his jawline.

"Much better, Lady Luna Seraphina. Theodore has been so kind." She nuzzles his cheek. He presses a gentle kiss to her forehead before tensing.

"Alpha Victor, Luna Seraphina... As Elara is my mate, we wanted your permission for her to stay in the pack."

My brows knit together. "Why wouldn't she be welcome?"

Theodore glances between us, confused. "Because she's not a wolf."

"And?" I counter.

Seraphina answers, her gaze on Elara. "I am the Guardian of the Realm, am I not?"

"Yes, Lady Luna."

"What kind of Guardian would I be if I turned away those under my protection?"

Elara beams, and Theodore's shoulders relax.

"Do you truly wish to stay with us?" I ask. "I thought sprites feared werewolves."

She rubs her cheek against Theodore's stubble. "He promised we'd take it slow—starting with dinner tonight. He says wolves thrive in packs, so he'll help me adjust to being around his friends."

"That sounds perfect."

As Theodore rises to join his warriors, he adds, "Oh, Luna—Elara and all sprites are vegetarian. Will that be an issue?"

"Not at all. Just inform Rosalind in the kitchens, though I doubt her appetite will strain our supplies."

Later, as we prepare for bed, Seraphina's anxiety thrums through our bond. I embrace her from behind, lips brushing her shoulder. "What's troubling you, love? This nervousness isn't like you."

She exhales shakily, leaning into me. "We leave tomorrow. In days, I might face my father. The closer it gets... the more terrified I become."

I turn her to face me, arms locked around her waist. "Tell me what frightens you. He can't harm you—you're stronger now, and I'll kill him before he lays a finger on you. What's the real fear?"

Trembling lips. Glittering tears. "What if he makes me feel like that worthless girl again?"

Cradling her face, I say, "You are Seraphina Blackwood. Guardian of the Realm. Luna of Sanctuary Pack. My mate. There is no weakness in you. HE was the failure—as a father, as an Alpha. You're not that child anymore. You're a storm wrapped in skin." I crush her against my chest.

"Truthfully? I hope we do encounter him."

She jerks back. "Why?"

"Because I want him to see what his arrogance cost him. Don't mistake me—I'm grateful he never recognized your power. He'd have chained you to some brute to strengthen his pack. Instead, he discarded you. Forgot you and your mother. And look what he lost." My thumb traces her jaw. "He lost the most extraordinary woman I've ever known."

###Chapter 0401

The morning of our departure for Luna's Challenge arrives. We load up four SUVs—one owned by our pack, the other three rented in the city. Victor and I pooled our resources, but funds were tight.

The drive to northern Nebraska would take twelve hours nonstop. The Council had secured a state park, paying handsomely to keep humans away. With nearly 300 packs converging, secrecy was crucial. The central location minimized travel for most.

The journey dragged. To pass time, Victor and I practiced our mind-linking abilities with the pack. Distance weakened the connection, frustrating several members as we accidentally invaded their thoughts. By midday, the link snapped entirely.

We arrived at dusk. Check-in revealed all 298 packs were expected—nearly 5,100 warriors competing. That didn't include mates or pups spectating. Our pack brought Felicity, Amber and Leopold's baby. Evelyn carried Finnian, who insisted on accompanying baby Ivy. Sebastian and Seraphina brought Julian, while Nathaniel's human mate Genevieve volunteered to watch the children during battles.

Registration showed tomorrow's schedule would be brutal—3,300 warriors competing. Our pack fielded sixteen.

Evelyn, Adrian, and their pack arrived during sign-ups. Spotting Ivy, I immediately stole her from Evelyn's arms. Victor and I had discussed trying for a pup after the tournament, and holding her made my womb ache. Both my Guardian sisters had newborns recently, sharpening my longing.

Ivy studied me with Adrian's piercing blue eyes and Evelyn's chestnut curls. When her tiny hand patted my cheek, I kissed it—prompting fussy whimpers.

Evelyn sighed. "She's a daddy's girl. Has been since birth."

Adrian materialized, brushing Ivy's forehead with his lips. Instant calm.

"Must be frustrating," I remarked, marveling at his effortless soothing.

Evelyn laughed. "Actually? Lifesaver at 3 AM when only Daddy will do."

Adrian cradled Ivy against his chest. "Daddy doesn't mind, do I, princess?"

The domestic scene stabbed my heart. I blinked back sudden tears, forcing composure. "Where's your pack stationed?"

Evelyn checked her map. "Here."

"Close to us. How many warriors tomorrow?"

"Fourteen. Sebastian's bringing sixteen. You?"

"Sixteen, but none on day two. Without a Lead Warrior, we left Donovan and Seraphina in charge." I lowered my voice. "We've treated several injured from problematic packs. Can't wait to meet their Alphas in the arena."

###Chapter 0402

Evelyn rolls her eyes. "Don't hog all the fun. Save some for me and Seraphina. You know how much it stings those cocky Alphas to lose to a woman." A wicked grin spreads across both our faces.

"Ivy, your mom and Aunt Isolde are terrifying. Take notes—that's exactly the kind of woman I want you to become," Adrian coos to Ivy, making us all chuckle.

Victor approaches, greeting the group. "We're near where Evelyn and Adrian's pack will be staying. Hopefully Seraphina and Sebastian aren't too far."

As if summoned, her voice cuts through the air. "Need us somewhere specific?"

"Seraphina!" Evelyn and I rush toward her, pulling her into a tight embrace. It's been ages since I last saw her after she gave birth to Julian.

"Where's that little bundle of joy?" Evelyn demands as Sebastian appears behind Seraphina, balancing a car seat in one hand and a massive diaper bag slung over his shoulder.

Seraphina turns to take the carrier from Sebastian. "Evelyn, Isolde, meet Reginald Clint."

He's perfect. Soft peach fuzz covers his head, his eyes shut tight in peaceful sleep.

Evelyn and I melt instantly, cooing over him. The familiar ache returns—my longing for a child of my own. Seraphina mentioned it might take time after stopping the birth control I'd been on, but today marks the end of that.

"Did Valeria lose her mind when you could shift again?" Evelyn asks Seraphina.

"Oh goddess, yes. She nearly combusted from excitement. Ran circles around Dorian for hours like a hyperactive pup."

Sebastian nuzzles Seraphina's temple. "He adored every second of it."

Evelyn smiles fondly at them. "Theron was the same when Selene returned."

"Figured out your lodging yet?" I ask Sebastian as Adrian and Victor join us. Seraphina immediately scoops Ivy from Adrian's arms.

Sebastian unfolds the map, pointing to their marked location. Evelyn and I compare it with ours. "Looks like Blackthorn Pack is sandwiched between us, but we're all close. Either of you been here before?"

"Nope. The venue changes each time," Adrian says, scanning the area. "Last tournament was in the Sierra Nevadas. Epic terrain."

"Events kick off at dawn. We should head to our cabins and settle in, love," Victor murmurs to me.

Sebastian nods eagerly. "First day's brutal but crucial. Warriors can't earn as many individual points as other rounds, but there are more of them—easy to stack up wins." No surprise there. Nightshade Pack has dominated the last two tournaments, eight years running since Sebastian took Alpha at eighteen.

We exchange quick goodbyes, agreeing to meet for breakfast at 4:30 AM before the 6 AM start.

As I turn toward our SUV, a familiar figure freezes me mid-step. He's crossing the parking lot, oblivious, laughing with members of my former pack. A toddler perches on his hip.

My father.

Our eyes lock for a fleeting second before he looks away. No recognition. Nothing.

He didn't even know me.

###Chapter 0403

The cabin door clicks shut behind the last warrior, leaving us in blessed solitude. Isolde's emotions have been a turbulent storm since we arrived—waves of anxiety, flickers of fear, and something deeper I can't quite decipher.

I catch her wrist as she paces past me. "Talk to me, love." My thumb traces the rapid pulse at her wrist. "This isn't just about your father."

She collapses against my chest like a marionette with cut strings. I scoop her up, settling us on the bed's edge with her straddling my lap. Her face burrows into my throat, dampness seeping into my collar.

When the first sob shakes her shoulders, I tilt her chin up. Tears streak her cheeks, catching moonlight from the window. "Isolde?"

"Yes." The word shatters between us.

I wait.

Her fingers twist in my shirt. "I saw the way you held Julian today. How Ivy looked at him." A shuddering breath. "I want that, Victor. I want your child growing inside me."

Time fractures. My hands freeze on her waist.

She misreads my stillness. "We agreed to wait until after Luna's Challenge, but—" Her voice drops to a whisper. "I don't want to wait anymore."

Joy detonates in my chest. Louis howls in triumph through our bond. Since stabilizing Safe Haven, I've lain awake imagining this exact moment—my mate round with our pup, our bloodline secured.

I capture her mouth in a searing kiss. "Then we start tonight."

Her eyes widen. "Truly?"

"Nothing would honor me more." I nip her lower lip. "Though I should warn you—" My hands slide under her shirt. "I plan to be very thorough in my efforts."

Her laughter dies when she stiffens. "There's more."

"Mm?" I'm already mapping the fastest route to bare skin.

"I saw him." Her nails dig into my shoulders. "My father. At the parking lot earlier."

All arousal evaporates. "Did he approach you?"

She shakes her head. "He carried a little girl—must be the child Sebastian mentioned. But Victor..." Her voice cracks. "He looked right through me."

I stroke her spine. "You were twelve when he cast you out. You've changed."

"He should have known my scent."

"Or he's terrified of what you've become." I kiss her temple. "If you confront him tomorrow, I'll be your shadow. But tonight..." I stand with her in my arms. "Tonight, we make life, not war."

The shower runs cold before we stumble to bed, sated and smiling.

Dawn comes too soon. We groan at the alarm, but by breakfast, the lodge thrums with competitive energy. Warriors from a dozen packs jostle at the buffet, their scents sharp with anticipation.

The Elder's gavel cracks against the podium. "Welcome to Luna's Challenge!" His voice booms across the hall. "Four days shall determine the strongest pack through combat, strategy, and endurance."

He outlines the rules—human-form battles only, points awarded per victory, a live ranking board tracking each pack's standing. My fingers lace with Isolde's as he announces Leopold will fight for Safe Haven.

Her whisper ghosts across my skin: "Win or lose, we leave here with our future secured."

I kiss her knuckles, tasting promise.

###Chapter 0404

The morning battles commence after breakfast. These early rounds serve to weed out the weaker packs, a tedious but necessary process given the sheer number of participants.

By lunch, the arena clears as warriors regroup. We join Evelyn, Adrian, Sebastian, and Seraphina. Relief washes over me—all our fighters remain standing. The first two rounds have already cut the competition by nearly 2500 wolves. The afternoon will bring fewer but fiercer matches as the strongest advance.

As we load our trays, Seraphina freezes. "Tobias?"

An older man turns, brow furrowed. "Do we know each other?"

She abandons her food and approaches him. Sebastian tenses immediately, passing baby Julian to Isolde before following his mate.

"Tobias. It's Seraphina Bennis. Well, Seraphina Blackstone now."

"Seraphina? Goddess above." He pulls her into an embrace, only to recoil when Sebastian snarls.

"Alpha Sebastian. No disrespect intended." Tobias bares his throat. "I served with her father. We were warriors together."

Seraphina touches Sebastian's arm. "This is the man who protected my family. The only safety I knew after we fled."

Sebastian's posture shifts instantly. He extends a hand. "Then I owe you more than gratitude."

Tobias's voice cracks. "When we found your parents... We thought you..."

"That story requires time I'd gladly give you later."

"Name the hour."

A new Alpha strides over. "Tobias? What's happening here?"

"Alpha Dominic, may I present Sebastian and Seraphina Blackstone. Seraphina is Reginald and Eleanor Bennis's daughter." Tobias's shoulders stiffen—whether from Dominic's presence or the topic, I can't tell.

Dominic's gaze sharpens. "The couple who abandoned our pack? We found their bodies years later. Their daughter was presumed dead."

Seraphina mirrors Tobias's cautious tone. "As I told Tobias, it's a complicated history we can't unpack here."

Dominic stares too long. Sebastian moves closer, arm encircling Seraphina.

"I demand to know why your father betrayed us. Mine spent years searching for his Lead Warrior, only to find traitors' corpses."

"Her father didn't trust yours with her life," Sebastian counters.

"Lies! My father cherished every pack member. Whatever delusions drove your desertion—" Tobias's jaw clenches. Something dark lurks beneath his words.

"Feel that?" Isolde murmurs, bouncing Julian.

I nod. "That Alpha's aura is wrong. After everything we've witnessed, the signs scream at me."

She scans the room. "Agreed. Who are they?"

"Seraphina's birth pack. The one her parents fled." I leave the rest unsaid—this hall thrums with shifter ears, and Seraphina's secret isn't mine to reveal.

Sebastian kisses Seraphina's temple, eyes locked on Dominic. "Show him, my love."

The moment her irises shift to Guardian silver, Dominic's expression morphs from outrage to hunger. Now we understand why her parents ran.

"Guardian," he purrs, the word slithering across my skin.

"Well, the secret's out," Evelyn mutters. The room has gone silent, but the stares aren't just for Seraphina. They're assessing our clustered packs—and the other women standing with us.

###Chapter 0405

Isolde steps forward, addressing the gathered Alphas. A collective gasp ripples through the room as Aurora makes her presence known.

"All happily marked and mated," Adrian declares, his voice edged with defiance as he rises. I notice he’s handed Ivy back to Genevieve. He’s prepared for conflict.

Victor’s arm tightens around me possessively. When I glance up, I see Magnus gleaming in his eyes. Adrian’s and Sebastian’s gazes burn with the same warning—their wolves close to the surface. The message is clear: Touch what’s mine, and there will be consequences.

One of the tournament elders stands. "Alphas, no one here intends to challenge your claims. This is a friendly competition. Your mates are marked, and their scents bear your claim. Those paying attention have already noted the three females competing on Alpha Day. Some may have mistaken them for Alpha females, but we all know now—they’re Guardians here to fight. Let’s finish lunch and resume the tournament."

The tension eases. Sebastian guides Seraphina back to our table, though his gaze remains locked on the Alpha who’d eyed her. When they sit, I pass Julian back to Seraphina. It’s as if the entire room suddenly registers the two infants at our table—both belonging to Guardians. The unspoken truth settles over the gathering: We are claimed.

After lunch, packs with remaining warriors return to the arena. Some choose to spectate, while others take the afternoon to let their wolves run free. By 4 PM, only 100 warriors remain—all from our three packs still in contention. By 6 PM, that number dwindles to 50. A few of Adrian’s and Sebastian’s warriors fall to ours, along with a handful of skilled outsiders. By 8 PM, only 10 stand. Victor and I have five warriors fighting; Sebastian has three, Adrian two. The rest have been eliminated.

By 10 PM, it’s over. Our warrior, Gideon, takes first. Victor and I agree to offer him Lead Warrior when we return home. Sebastian’s warrior claims second, Adrian’s third. Both our packs earn extra points for decisive victories or fighting through injuries.

The final rankings flash on the leaderboard:
1st Place: Nightshade Pack – 230 points
2nd Place: Sanctuary Pack – 225 points
3rd Place: Blackthorn Pack – 140 points

Throughout the day, I’ve watched my father. The toddler with him is undeniably his son. His mate is young—early twenties, closer to Seraphina’s age. Old enough to be her father. It makes me wonder: Did she choose this, or was she forced?

I’ve noticed other things too. As a child, I admired my father’s dominance, mistaking brutality for strength. Now, as a Luna bonded to a true Alpha, I understand real power doesn’t demand constant proof. A respected Alpha leads without fear of challenge. His pack trusts him. My father’s doesn’t.

Is this new since my banishment? Or did I simply not see it before?

I’ve also spotted Silas, my father’s former Gamma—the one who let my mother and me escape. I owe him my life. I need to thank him.

Back at the cabins, our warriors celebrate today’s victories. Victor and I check on them, ensuring no harassment from former packmates. A few had been approached earlier, but after the Guardians’ presence became undeniable, the threats ceased.

###Chapter 0406

We allowed them their moment of victory. With no competitors from our pack tomorrow, though I wanted to support Nightshade and Blackthorn, our standings would remain unchanged. Victor expressed his pride through our mind link before seizing the opportunity to promote Gideon as Lead Warrior. His acceptance sparked renewed celebration as Victor and I retreated to our cabin, the festivities echoing through the trees until dawn.

Morning revealed only a handful of our pack at breakfast. Today's meal started later at 5:30am, with battles commencing at 7am sharp. The tournament's second day featured Lead Warriors and Gammas. Sebastian's newly appointed warrior would compete alongside Donovan and our own Beatrice. My loudest cheers would be for her - she'd risen through our ranks.

1,790 contestants remained - nearly half yesterday's number, but today's matches promised greater intensity. We watched two brutal rounds before lunch. Approaching the children's area to collect Genevieve and Finnian, we spotted an unfamiliar figure looming over them.

His sneering voice carried as we neared. "What self-respecting pack mingles with humans and - what even are you? Some kind of forest sprite?" The Beta's lip curled at our guests.

Finnian rose, positioning himself as a shield. "I'm a royal elf of Eldermere."

The Beta snorted. "Pathetic. Crawl back to whatever hole you came from before I send you home in pieces."

I tensed to intervene when Seraphina materialized behind him. "Beta. Are you insulting an Elven Prince and my honored guest?"

He spun, arrogance faltering when confronted by the Guardian's glowing silver eyes. "G-Guardian!" His throat bobbed visibly.

"Or perhaps you were threatening my Beta female," Valeria added, flanking him. His head whipped between them like a cornered animal.

"N-no! Just... joking..."

"Aren't you going to help them?" I asked Adrian and Sebastian.

Adrian smirked. "And insult our mates' capabilities?"

Sebastian didn't blink. "They'd skin us for interfering."

The Beta now pressed against a wall as both women advanced. "Your manners require correction, Beta," Seraphina emphasized his rank like a curse.

"Just harmless fun!" He glanced desperately at Finnian.

"Disgrace to Betas everywhere," Victor muttered beside me.

"I've always said you carry Alpha blood. More dominant than any Beta," I observed as the confrontation escalated.

Sebastian kept eyes locked on his mate. "Grace speaks truth. No ordinary Beta could have survived my dungeons as you did."

Adrian added without looking away, "Many Betas descend from Alpha lines. Second sons, forgotten over generations."

The Beta trembled visibly - possibly soiling himself beneath their combined wrath.

"Anyone else turned on right now?" Adrian breathed.

"Watching our women wield power? Fucking electrifying," Sebastian growled.

An Alpha suddenly intervened, pulling his cowering Beta away. Victor stiffened beside me as they approached our group.

"Time to put another pup in my mate," Sebastian declared, stalking toward Valeria with predatory intent.

"Seriously? Julian's barely two weeks old," Adrian called after him.

"Exactly. Too long since she carried my child."

We watched him sweep Valeria into a passionate kiss, carrying her toward the forest's edge.

As the Beta passed, Victor blocked his path. "Crimson Moon Pack?"

The Beta glanced between us. "Yeah?"

Victor's fist connected with his jaw. "From Leopold. He says hello."

###Chapter 0407

The moment I laid eyes on the Alpha of Crimson Moon Pack, his resemblance to Leopold was unmistakable. Though Leopold was the eldest, his lack of a wolf had cost him the Alpha position, which their father gave to his younger brother instead. When Rafael took over, he allowed Leopold to remain in the pack but chose that worthless excuse of a wolf as his Beta. From what Leopold had shared, this Beta had tormented him relentlessly while Rafael turned a blind eye. After witnessing their interaction firsthand, I realized Leopold hadn't been exaggerating.

"What the hell! If my brother has a problem with my Beta or any pack member, he answers to me." Rafael snarled, helping his Beta up from the ground.

"Rafael, isn't it?" I stepped closer, my voice dripping with contempt. "I'm Leopold's Alpha now, and I was simply giving this pathetic excuse for a wolf what he deserved. Your mistake in overlooking your brother was my gain."

"You made a wolf-less man your Beta?" Rafael scoffed. "What kind of joke of an Alpha are you?"

I closed the distance between us until we were nose to nose. "The kind who recognizes true strength. My Beta could outmaneuver yours blindfolded, with both hands tied behind his back."

Rafael smirked. "Maybe you'll get to test that theory tomorrow. If they're matched in the first round. No way your Beta lasts more than one round without a wolf. Doesn't matter that he's an Alpha."

A slow, dangerous smile spread across my face. "Funny you should mention that. I checked the tournament brackets before coming here. My Beta faces yours in the opening match. May the best wolf win."

"Oh, he will," Rafael sneered. "And it'll be my Beta standing victorious."

"Good luck with that fantasy." I turned away dismissively. "You'll need it."

Watching them retreat, I turned to Isolde. "Let's get some food before the afternoon battles. Beatrice is still competing."

"You know Leopold can fight his own battles, right?" Isolde arched an eyebrow.

"Absolutely. But that bastard had it coming. Seraphina and Evelyn showed restraint by not breaking his nose. Someone had to finish the job."

We entered the dining hall and loaded our plates. Just as we were about to sit, Leopold jogged up, his expression a mix of amusement and disbelief.

"Alpha, did you really punch Rafael's Beta?"

"Damn right I did." I took a bite, completely unfazed.

"Mind telling me why?"

I met his gaze steadily. "Besides the obvious? He was threatening Genevieve and Finnian, acting like a complete asshole. Seraphina and Evelyn handled him, but I thought he deserved something more... memorable. Might have mentioned you sent your regards."

Leopold dropped into a chair, shaking with silent laughter before it burst out uncontrollably. "I wish I'd seen that."

"You know you're facing him first thing tomorrow, right?"

His head snapped up, a predatory grin spreading across his face. "Is that so?"

"I expect you to wipe the floor with him, Leopold." Isolde said firmly.

"Consider it done, Luna."

Lillian joined us with two plates, handing one to Leopold before taking Felicity from Genevieve.

After lunch, we returned to the tournament grounds. Beatrice was dominating her matches, just as I'd expected. Though she'd always been skilled, Sebastian's training had taken her abilities to another level.

By day's end, Beatrice secured third place, earning cheers from our entire pack. Nightshade's Lead Warrior took second, while Sebastian claimed first - no surprise given how often he sparred with the Guardians.

The updated rankings flashed on the leaderboard:

1st Place: Nightshade Pack - 280 points
2nd Place: Blackthorn Pack - 240 points
3rd Place: Sanctuary Pack - 225 points

Adrian's pack had made impressive gains. Even without competing today, we maintained our top-three position.

While Isolde went to congratulate Beatrice, I spoke with other warriors. When I turned to find her, she was no longer with Beatrice. My pulse quickened as I scanned the crowd.

After yesterday's events and the way other Alphas had eyed our mates, Sebastian, Adrian and I had become hyper-vigilant.

"She's over there," Adrian said quietly, having noticed my search. "Talking to that Alpha." We'd all been silently watching out for each other's mates and pack members.

Following his gaze, my blood turned to ice. She was speaking with her father. I moved toward them immediately. The smug expression on his face set my teeth on edge.

As I approached, I caught Isolde's words: "You really don't recognize me, do you?"

"Oh darling," he said condescendingly, "everyone knows you're a Guardian. I'm well aware of who you are."

I stepped behind Isolde, placing a protective arm around her waist. "Do you now? You think you know my mate?" My touch reassured her of my support. His mate and son stood several paces back, observing.

He looked me up and down with obvious disdain - laughable considering I could end him with one blow. The man was decades past his prime.

"I was just explaining to your mate," he said smugly, "that while I'm flattered by her attention these past two days, I'm a happily mated man." Turning back to Isolde, he added, "If you're unhappy, my dear, my pack would gladly welcome a Guardian."

The irony was so thick I nearly choked. Isolde actually laughed in his face. "Is that so?"

He frowned as if she'd lost her mind. "Naturally. I'd be honored to have you as my Guardian, just not as my mate. You understand, of course."

"Oh, I understand perfectly." Isolde's voice turned glacial. "You have no idea who I really am. Father."

###Chapter 0408

The nerve of this man. This man I once idolized, the one I believed held all the answers. Now, I see the truth—a pathetic, washed-up Alpha clinging to his fading power.

His arrogance is staggering. To think I was staring at him out of desire? Disgusting.

I watch his face go rigid when I call him father.

"Twelve years old when you cast me out. Remember now?"

"That's impossible."

"Why, Dad?" I sneer. "Because you couldn’t wait to see if I’d get my wolf? Because you couldn’t love me unless I was worthy in your eyes? Well, surprise. It’s me—Isolde. The daughter you exiled. A future Guardian. Does that jog your memory?"

"How dare you—" His hand flies up to strike me.

I catch his wrist mid-air, my grip unyielding even as he struggles.

"Does your mate know?"

"Shut your mouth!"

"Guess not. Let’s enlighten her, shall we?" I turn to his mate, still holding his arm aloft. "I’m only alive because my mother ran with me when he banished us." Horror floods her eyes. She had no idea we existed.

I don’t want to hurt her, but his lies end today.

"For years, I watched my father betray the mate bond, slowly killing my mother." His mate clutches their son, tears streaming.

"Shut up, you little bitch!"

"Oh, Father. Your days of intimidating me are over."

"But you know what finally killed her? When you marked your new mate. You knew it would destroy her. And you did it anyway."

I yank him closer until our faces are inches apart. "On my sixteenth birthday. Tell me that wasn’t deliberate."

Shoving him back, I release him with a snarl.

"What do you want?" he spits.

"Glad you asked." Facing him isn’t terrifying—it’s liberating.

"I want my pack. I am the rightful heir. The true Alpha. And I. Want. My. Pack." Selene surges forward, lending her strength to my words.

Gasps ripple through the crowd.

"You’ll have to fight me for it."

"Gladly. And I’ll show you the same mercy you showed my mother. One week, Alpha." I turn to his mate, softening my tone. "You’re innocent in this. Stay out of my way, and you can remain in the pack. But think hard—do you really want this man as your mate when I come for him?"

I lock eyes with my father again. "Because I will kill you for what you did."

Another Alpha steps forward. "You think you can just waltz in and take our packs? Guardian or not, I’m not afraid of you."

Seraphina and Evelyn move to my sides.

"You don’t need to fear us," Seraphina says. "But you will respect us." Her aura slams into him, forcing him to his knees, neck bared in submission.

Evelyn scans the crowd. "Anyone else want to test us? We’d be happy to oblige." Selene’s growl echoes through the clearing.

My father finally understands—he’s outmatched.

"One week," I repeat. He turns and flees.

Victor wraps his arms around me from behind. "So, we’re assimilating another pack?"

I twist in his embrace. "I should’ve discussed it with you. But I didn’t realize it was what I wanted until I faced him."

He presses his forehead to mine. "Luckily, the elders are here. We’ll negotiate for the land between ours and Black Canyon. We can afford it now."

"If not, Sebastian and I will help," Adrian says, pulling Evelyn close.

"How many pack members are we talking?" Victor asks.

"One hundred seventy-five," a deep voice answers.

I turn. "Silas."

He shakes his head. "I owe you an apology. I should’ve done more. As his Gamma, I should’ve known."

"Will the pack follow me?"

He studies me. "They’ve suffered under him for years. They’ll accept you as their Alpha."

###Chapter 0409

The conversation with Silas lingers in my mind as Isolde and I return to our cabin. We've barely settled in when Seraphina and Sebastian knock on the door.

"Mind if we come in?" Seraphina asks, her voice carrying an uncharacteristic edge.

I step aside, motioning them inside. "Always."

Isolde starts brewing coffee while we gather in the cramped seating area. "You noticed my exchange with Tobias at lunch today?" Seraphina dives straight to the point.

I nod. "He was tense around his Alpha."

"Alpha Dominic," she clarifies as Isolde brings over the coffee tray. "He's the son of the Alpha who ruled when my family fled Whitewater Pack."

The rich aroma of coffee fills the air as Seraphina continues. "Tobias approached me afterward. He's heard of your pack. Wants out of Whitewater, but didn't know where to go."

She exchanges a glance with Sebastian, who gives a subtle nod. "He's terrified Dominic will track him down if he joins our pack."

"Wouldn't matter once he's officially one of us," Sebastian interjects.

"But he doesn't want to relive my family's nightmare—being hunted like prey." Seraphina's fingers tighten around her mug. "He's asking if your pack would take him in."

I look at Isolde. "Your pack, my pack—does it really matter? We'd welcome him and his family." A pause. "Does he understand we're still building? That it'll be hard work?"

Sebastian answers this time. "I made that crystal clear. Apparently, Dominic's taxing them into starvation. The chance to build their own home? That's hope they haven't had in years."

I drag my hands down my face. "This is exactly what I feared. Word's spreading about mistreated pack members finding refuge with us. Now that our location's known, we'll have more showing up at our borders."

Isolde's hand finds my arm, warm and steady. "We'll make room. Everyone deserves safety. You know that better than anyone."

Turning back to our guests, I confirm, "They're welcome. Any idea how they'll get from Colorado to Georgia? That's no short trip."

Sebastian and Seraphina share another look. "We'll handle transport," Sebastian says. "Just needed your confirmation first."

The conversation shifts to tomorrow's Beta battles, Sebastian and I trading playful jabs about whose Beta will dominate.

After they leave, I turn to Isolde. "Might need to buy all the land between us and Blackthorn Pack."

Her eyebrows shoot up. "You realize how much territory that is?"

"About six hundred acres. Rough terrain makes it feel larger." At her low whistle, I add, "The council might cut us a deal. No other pack wants that rocky stretch—but connecting our borders to Sebastian's and Adrian's would give us strategic protection."

I pull my mate toward bed. "We'll discuss it after Leopold humiliates that sorry excuse for a Beta tomorrow."

"Can't wait to see their faces," Isolde agrees before we drift off.

Morning arrives with nervous energy crackling under my skin. I'm itching to see Leopold claim vengeance for his past suffering.

At breakfast, Leopold appears unnervingly calm. His mate, however, looks ready to lose her breakfast.

"Lillian? You alright?" I ask.

She gives a tight nod, eyes glued to her plate.

Leopold pulls her close, pressing a kiss to her temple. "Just breathe, love. You've got this."

His quiet confidence does little to ease the tension coiling in my gut. Today's battles will change everything.

###Chapter 0410

"Lillian, you're one of our strongest warriors. Why are you trembling?" Isolde asks, and I don't miss the way Lillian's lips quiver. If this competition is causing her this much distress, I won't hesitate to pull her out.

Leopold steps in before she can respond. "She's terrified of disappointing you both."

Isolde takes Lillian's hands in hers. "Sweetheart, just being here makes us proud. You don’t have to prove anything to us."

Lillian lifts her gaze, eyes shimmering with unshed tears. "You’ve given me everything. I just... I want to show you it wasn’t wasted. But I’ve never fought like this before."

I step closer. "Lillian, I wouldn’t have chosen you if I didn’t believe in you. But if you’re not ready, I can withdraw your name."

Her spine straightens instantly. "No! I’m competing. I just—I need to do this right."

"Then relax. You already have."

After breakfast, we head to the arena where Leopold will fight. Only 448 contestants remain today—acting Betas, retired Betas, or anyone over eighteen with Beta blood. Some packs, like ours, have two fighters.

"I’ll go support Lillian. You stay with Leopold," Isolde says, knowing I need to be here for him. I kiss her before she leaves.

"Link me updates on her progress." She winks over her shoulder before disappearing into the crowd.

I turn back just as Leopold enters the ring. He stands motionless, radiating calm, but through our bond, I feel the nerves he’s suppressing. He’s always been like this—controlled, disciplined. He’d have made a phenomenal Alpha.

His opponent, Rafael’s Beta, is the exact opposite. The guy struts in like he’s in a human boxing match, bouncing on his toes, shadowboxing, riling up the crowd. It’s all flash, no substance.

When the fight starts, the Beta charges hard. Leopold ducks under his wild swing and drives a fist into his stomach. The Beta staggers, his cocky grin slipping.

He’s still dancing, but slower now, breathing harder. That first hit made him rethink his strategy. Leopold shifts into a defensive stance, waiting.

The Beta swings again. Leopold takes a hit to the ribs but uses the opening to smash his fist into the Beta’s face. The man crashes to his knees.

Rafael screams at him to get up. The Beta wipes blood from his mouth and lunges again. Leopold sidesteps, sweeps his legs out, and slams a fist into his solar plexus. The Beta wheezes, gasping for air.

Leopold steps back, waiting. Rafael snarls threats—lose now, lose your rank. The Beta staggers up, and Leopold finally speaks.

"You should’ve stayed down."

This time, Leopold doesn’t hold back. Punch after punch—gut, ribs, kidneys, head—until the Beta collapses at his feet.

"Do you yield?" Leopold’s voice is ice.

"Go to hell!" The Beta spits blood as he struggles up.

Leopold’s eyes darken. "I gave you a chance."

He strikes again—a brutal elbow to the knee. The audible pop is followed by a scream.

The referee calls it. Our pack erupts in cheers. Leopold walks away without glancing at Rafael or his fallen Beta.

###Chapter 0411

I trail behind Lillian as she heads to her match. The pack seems split between Leopold and Lillian, though unsurprisingly, most are gathered around Leopold. They're eager to see him defeat his brother's Beta.

Genevieve moves to stand beside me. "Nathaniel took his opponent down in two moves."

"Impressive!"

She nods toward Lillian. "Is she ready?"

"She will be. She just needs to trust her instincts."

The Beta facing her smirks, towering over her petite frame.

"You've got this, Lillian!" I shout.

"Size means nothing when you fight smart," Genevieve adds, clapping loudly.

Lillian holds her own, trading blows despite the size disadvantage. Victor and Leopold join us.

"How's she doing, Luna?"

"Strong," I say, raising my voice. "Now she just needs to stop holding back and show him what Sanctuary Pack is made of."

"Finish him, love. Just like we trained," Leopold calls.

His words ignite something in her. Her stance shifts—defensive to aggressive. She uses her agility to weave around the Beta, disrupting his balance.

"That's it! Just like last week!" Leopold cheers.

Lillian sprints forward, launching a roundhouse kick straight to his jaw. The Beta stumbles. She drops, pivots, and lands a clean strike to his inner thigh—just within the rules. Before he recovers, she sweeps his legs out from under him. Her fist slams into his stomach.

He gags, turning just in time to vomit onto the dirt. The referee calls the match.

Lillian wins.

"That's my mate!" Leopold roars, scooping her up in a victorious spin.

By noon, we’re down to the top fifty. By 2 PM, only twenty-five remain—including all five of our Betas. Genevieve and Donovan are still in the running.



Donovan secures third place, losing to Leopold. Nathaniel wins his match, advancing to face Leopold in the finals.

Their battle is the longest yet. Both are relentless, proving why they hold their ranks. In the end, Leopold defeats Nathaniel. All three packs erupt in applause.

The final rankings flash on the leaderboard:

1st Place: Nightshade Pack – 380 points
2nd Place: Sanctuary Pack – 375 points
3rd Place: Blackthorn Pack – 365 points

Tomorrow’s Alpha battles will decide everything. But I’m already proud. For our first tournament, top three is guaranteed.

Dinner is tense. Many Alphas are visibly irritated at the prospect of losing to a female. After witnessing Seraphina’s strength, they know they’re outmatched.

We rise early the next day. I eat lightly, wanting to be sharp for my first fight. Seraphina is up against an Alpha notorious for abusing his pack. She’s practically gleeful at the chance to humiliate him.

Victor kisses me before we separate for our matches. This time, the pack divides evenly—some following him, others staying with me.

My first opponent is the same Alpha who challenged us days ago, the one Seraphina forced to his knees. His arrogance hasn’t faded. He sneers, refusing to shake hands.

Fine. He’ll learn the hard way.

The whistle blows. He charges. I don’t bother with theatrics. Dodging his swing, I drop low and drive my palm into his chest with full force. He flies backward, crashing through the boundary ropes and into a tree.

A medic jogs over. "Out cold," he reports.

The referee shakes his head but awards me the win—plus bonus points for a one-hit knockout.

###Chapter 0412

"Why didn't you use a closed fist, Isolde?" One of my warriors questions me.

I glance at them, noticing their curious expressions. "You saw the force behind that strike?"

They nod in unison.

"A full punch would have shattered his ribs and killed him instantly." Their eyes widen as the realization sinks in. We move toward Victor's match, where several Alphas overhear our conversation. Their faces pale when they realize they'll be facing a Guardian in the next round.

Victor has his opponent pinned, expertly applying pressure just shy of dislocating the Alpha's shoulder until he taps out. We cheer before checking on the others. By the time we arrive, they've already finished their matches. We wait for the second round to begin.

My next opponent is an elder by Alpha standards. He approaches me before we enter the ring. "Guardian. I'm Alpha Alistair. It's an honor."

I recognize him—his pack respects him without fear. "Alpha Alistair, I'm Isolde. The pleasure is mine."

He chuckles warmly. "I don't expect to win today, but sparring with a Guardian will be the highlight of my life." His eyes gleam like a child on Christmas morning.

I can't help but smile. "Do you have a son, Alpha?"

"A daughter, actually. She hasn't found her mate yet, so I can't pass the pack to her. She didn't come—she's no warrior." His tone holds no disappointment, only acceptance.

I decide to make this memorable for him. We exchange blows, dancing around the ring. I point out gaps in his defense, and he adjusts instantly. He even offers me tips in return.

We're mid-spar when Victor's voice cuts through. "Isolde? This is a tournament, not a training session."

Alpha Alistair sighs dramatically. "Our time's up, then." He taps the ground with a grin. I help him up, and we exit together.

"That was exhilarating," he admits, ignoring Victor's frown.

"Alpha Alistair, meet my mate, Victor Blackwood. We lead Sanctuary Pack."

"Oh, everyone knows who you are by now." He shakes Victor's hand. "But it's good to finally meet you, Alpha."

I turn back to him. "We're hosting a mate gathering soon—Nightshade, Blackthorn, and our pack will all attend. Your daughter and any unmated wolves are welcome. Our territory's still expanding, but it's a chance for her to find her mate."

His eyes light up. "And if rumors are true, you'll be merging with another pack then? Even better odds."

I lean in conspiratorially. "You should come too, Alpha. Might get another shot at sparring with a Guardian." His delighted shudder makes me laugh.

###Chapter 0413

I can only shake my head at Isolde.

"What?"

"That wasn't a competition. You were toying with that Alpha."

She shrugs. "He knew he couldn't win, but he wanted to spar with a Guardian. Thought it might be his only chance, so I humored him. Now he'll get another shot if he brings his daughter to the mate gathering."

"Do you realize what you've just unleashed? Every unmated male will be flocking to our gathering hoping to claim an Alpha female."

"Why not?" She smirks. "Mates appear in unexpected places. More candidates mean better chances for everyone."

I grab her arm, spinning her to face me before pulling her close. "You're incredible."

Her arms loop around my neck as she rises on her toes. "I know." She claims my lips right there in front of everyone. Victor rumbles approvingly in my chest.

"Get a room!" Seraphina calls as she approaches with Sebastian.

I release Isolde with a chuckle. "Where are Adrian and Evelyn?"

"Checking on the pups." Sebastian eyes Isolde. "Adrian faced your father in the last round. Didn't go easy on him."

"Good." My mate's voice turns icy. "He deserves worse."

With only fifty Alphas remaining, the leaderboards will update after lunch. The six of us have breezed through our matches, but the afternoon battles promise to be tougher—especially for Sebastian, Adrian, and me. Our mates dispatch opponents effortlessly unless they choose to prolong the fight, like Isolde did with Alpha Alistair.

By dusk, we're the last six standing. Refusing to fight our mates, the organizers pit Seraphina against Adrian, Evelyn against me, and Isolde against Sebastian. These clashes stretch longest—not from reluctance to harm each other, but because mating with Guardians amplifies our strength.

Ultimately, our mates prevail. Isolde struggles most against Sebastian, the mightiest Alpha I've ever seen. But she's the strongest Guardian. Their duel ends with mutual respect.

Final standings flash before the last round:
1st: Nightshade Pack – 650 points
2nd: Blackthorn Pack – 640 points
3rd: Sanctuary Pack – 620 points

I grin. The Guardian battle will decide the winner, but with scores this tight, it's practically a three-way tie. Regardless, Sanctuary has announced its arrival—new, but formidable.

Approaching the judges' conference with Isolde, Seraphina and Evelyn, I spot Adrian and Sebastian already there, arms crossed. Their posture makes sense when I hear Evelyn's protest:

"Not happening."

"I won't fight my sisters," Seraphina states flatly.

"Current scores are fair," Isolde adds.

The elder judges shake their heads. "Rules demand a final battle."

"Says who?"

"We've proven our packs dominate," Seraphina counters. "Ranking us is pointless."

An explosion rocks the ground. I reach Isolde as another blast erupts, flames encircling the battlefield.

"HUNTERS!" The Guardians shout in unison as gunfire erupts.

Chaos erupts. Wolves shift and charge while Isolde spins, nostrils flaring.

"What are you doing?" Evelyn yells over the din.

"Over a thousand hunters surrounding us," Isolde growls.

We bolt toward Genevieve, Finnian and the pups. Hunters emerge, weapons raised. I shift mid-leap, crushing one's throat. Seraphina's aura picks off individuals, while Isolde and Evelyn hold back—their power could kill allies.

Ahead, Lillian sprints toward Felicity. A hunter draws his bow—Leopold pounces, snapping his spine.

The infants glow within Finnian's protective barrier. Genevieve isn't idle either, her flying knives finding hunter throats. We form a defensive ring, bolstered by Seraphina's aura reinforcing Finnian's shield. Arrows ricochet off the shimmering dome as the Guardians shift.

Smoke stings my eyes. The hunters' initial ambush felled many wolves, but their gas masks make them easy targets now.

Worse, they're forming a phalanx—shoulder-to-shoulder, advancing relentlessly to box us in.

Isolde, they're herding us. Can you wipe out a sector? I mind-link.

She shifts back, grabbing Evelyn's hand. "We need to breach that wall."

"Use my strength," Evelyn urges.

"I haven't practiced since the pregnancies. You take mine."

Evelyn nods. Power erupts from her fist, felling fifty hunters—but the blast draws every remaining gun toward us.

###Chapter 0414

Terror. Pure, unadulterated terror.

I’ve known fear before—when my mother’s mind fractured during her episodes, when death stole her from me and left me alone in this cruel world, when rogue Alphas hunted me like prey, desperate to force a bond.

But this? This isn’t fear for myself.

This is fear for Victor, my mate. Fear for Seraphina and Evelyn, my sisters standing beside me. Fear for my pack, for the innocent pups trembling behind us.

How dare they?

How dare these hunters think they can take what’s mine? How dare they threaten the life Victor and I have fought so hard to build?

As Evelyn unleashes our combined power and their attention snaps to us, my terror ignites into rage. A wildfire of fury.

They won’t take what’s mine. They won’t destroy the happiness my people have bled for.

Today, the thieves will become the robbed.

I seize Evelyn’s hand, drawing from her strength. She feels the shift and whips her head toward me.

They say auras have colors. Mine burns crimson. Evelyn’s flares orange, merging with mine into something fiercer.

Then a hand lands on my shoulder—Seraphina. Her energy is cool blue, but instead of dampening our fire, it bleeds into ours, forging violet power. Potent. Unbreakable.

I scan the battlefield, marking each hunter before closing my eyes. In my mind, they glow like beacons—dark stains against the light.

When my eyes snap open, Aurora’s power blazes through them.

The hunters open fire, their bullets and arrows aimed solely at us three.

"You will NOT take what’s mine!" My voice booms, layered with Aurora’s growl. I raise our linked hands—

And unleash hell.

The force that erupts from me is cataclysmic. I scream as it tears free, a freight train of raw power.

Then—collapse.

Seraphina drops behind me. Evelyn crumples beside me. The severed connection leaves me hollow, a shell. Bullets rip into my flesh as I stagger.

Victor catches me before I hit the ground.

"Isolde! Isolde!" His voice is distant. My body is lead. My mind floats away.

"Medic!" someone roars.

"Stay with me, Luna. You’re not dying today," Leopold grits out.

Victor cradles my face, his touch tethering me. "Listen to my voice. Stay with me."

"Get the silver out! They’re immune, but they won’t heal with bullets lodged in them!"

Chaos swirls—screams, sobbing pups, shouted orders.

"Are the children hurt?" Donovan demands.

"Finnian’s barrier held. They’re safe," Genevieve answers.

"And Finnian?"

"Exhausted, but alive."

Nearby, Sebastian and Donovan hover over Evelyn and Seraphina, murmuring the same pleas Victor whispers to me.

A stranger’s voice: "Where are her bullet wounds?"

I barely register the bullets being extracted. But when the last one’s gone, my healing kicks in.

"Isolde, open your eyes." I can’t.

Victor squeezes my hand. "Can you squeeze back?" I try. Nothing.

A sudden gasp. "Seraphina! Oh, gods—"

"I’m okay," she rasps. "Isolde drained me, but I’m recovering. Just needed a minute."

A pause. "They’re both still out?"

"Evelyn dropped right after you. Isolde last."

"They’ll wake. I could hear everything—I bet they can too. My healing just worked faster."

Victor’s thumb strokes my cheek. "If you can hear me, I’m right here."

"Did it work?" Seraphina asks. "Did Isolde’s attack land?"

Silence. Then—

"It worked." Victor’s voice is thick. "The Guardians saved us."

"Evelyn!" Donovan chokes out.

Her tired laugh is music. "You thought you’d get rid of me that easily, Alpha?"

Muffled sounds—probably Donovan burying his face in her neck.

"Seraphina’s right," Evelyn adds. "Isolde will wake. I’m weak, but I’m here."

Footsteps approach. "Alphas." A new voice. "Most hunters are dead. A few escaped, but..."

"But?" Victor growls.

"The ones who stayed... It’s like they were shredded. Never seen anything like it."

"She pulled too much power," Evelyn murmurs. "Drained us all."

Suddenly—light. Energy floods my veins, replacing numbness with aching weakness.

"Isolde!" Victor crushes me to his chest, his face buried in my neck. I cling to him.

"I heard you," I whisper. "I just couldn’t move." His scent, our bond—they stitch me back together.

I turn to my sisters. "Are you okay? I didn’t mean to take so much."

Seraphina, curled in Sebastian’s lap, smiles weakly. "We’ll train with Oberon. Learn control."

"Tired, but alive," Evelyn agrees from Donovan’s arms.

"Did it work?" I ask. "Did I protect our people?"

Victor kisses my temple. "It worked. The Guardians of the Realm won today."

###Chapter 0415

I'd always known Guardians were formidable. Every werewolf pup grows up hearing tales of their legendary strength. It's no wonder Alphas covet them so desperately. But knowing about their power and witnessing it firsthand? That's an entirely different beast.

Watching Isolde obliterate nearly a thousand hunters in one fell swoop left me speechless. The sheer magnitude of her power—channeled through Seraphina and Evelyn—made me wonder how she contained it all. Did it lie dormant inside her, waiting to be unleashed? Or did it simmer beneath the surface, restless and demanding release?

Questions for another time. Right now, my mate needed me.

"How are you feeling, love?"

"Like I've been trampled by a stampede."

"Let's get you back to the cabin."

"But the others—our pack members. Are they safe? Were any hurt?" Isolde insisted, ever the selfless Luna.

I opened my mouth to promise I'd handle it once she was resting, but Leopold and Lillian jogged up before I could respond.

"Luna, are you alright?" Lillian asked, breathless.

"I'm fine. What about our pack?"

"A few injuries, but no fatalities, thank the Moon Goddess," Leopold answered. His expression darkened as he scanned the battlefield. "Other packs weren't so lucky. Several lost Betas. Some even lost their Alphas." He ran a hand through his disheveled hair. "We had intel about an attack, but nothing this massive."

Sebastian stepped forward. "Were the elders harmed?"

"No, they were shielded. But the packs who lost Alphas will be in chaos—either establishing new leadership or being absorbed by others."

I scooped Isolde into my arms, cradling her against my chest. "I'm taking her to rest. Then I'll return to help with cleanup."

"Victor, I should stay—"

"You, Evelyn, and Seraphina just saved us all," I cut in gently. "Now let us handle the aftermath. We've got a long night ahead and a journey home tomorrow. Rest. Regain your strength."

Sebastian and Adrian clearly agreed, though they at least had their newborns as leverage to convince their mates to retreat. Reluctantly, I left Isolde after extracting a promise that she'd shower and sleep.

The cleanup was grueling. The elder's comparison to a woodchipper hadn't been exaggerated. We burned every trace, ensuring no evidence remained for human authorities. The elders would fabricate a cover story for the explosions and fires.

Sebastian, Adrian, and I focused on comforting the grieving packs—especially those now leaderless. Some had heirs ready to step up. Others would devolve into power struggles, vulnerable to hostile takeovers. At least Isolde's father and Alpha Alistair had survived. I'd make sure she knew.

By dawn, I finally collapsed beside Isolde, stealing a few hours of sleep before departure.

The elders summoned an Alpha meeting first. They wanted reports on hunter activity—this brazen tournament ambush marked a dangerous escalation. I mentioned the recent sprite attacks. Adrian volunteered to consult King Oberon about fae casualties. Sebastian proposed reaching out to supernaturals pledging allegiance to the Guardians for intel.

Then came the whispers of captured werewolves. Multiple Alphas suspected abductions but had no leads. We scheduled a video conference in two weeks to share findings.

The hunters had drawn first blood.

Now it was our turn.

###Chapter 0416

The journey home stretches endlessly, each mile heavier with the weight of the tournament's violent conclusion.

Relief floods me as Isolde regains her strength, with Seraphina and Evelyn confirming their recovery too. At least this burden lifts from my shoulders. Most of our injured warriors have healed overnight. Those still suffering will see Seraphina upon our return. I update Donovan briefly—just enough to assure him we're unharmed and heading back. The pack remains secure, which eases some tension.

Isolde senses my unease and rests her head against my chest. Our bond hums with her exhaustion. Though improved, yesterday's power surge lingers in her bones. I'm not sure what to call that explosive display of energy, but it left its mark. As she leans into me, I tighten my hold, adjusting so she can sleep. My own eyes drift shut.

Back at Blackthorn territory, I summon the ranked members—including Gideon, our newly appointed Lead Warrior—and dismiss Seraphina to tend to the wounded. After Donovan congratulates Gideon, we dive into grim realities.

"You all witnessed the hunter ambush at the tournament." My voice cuts through the room. "Isolde estimates over a thousand attacked us. But we know that's merely a fraction of their numbers nationwide. Adrian, Sebastian, and I discussed it. The Guardians are now targets. Those hunters who escaped will report what they saw. They'll come for them."

"No one touches our Luna." Leopold's growl echoes the room's defiance.

"Damn right they won't." My knuckles whiten. "But safety requires action. Border patrols will double. I'll speak with our Sylvan Fae allies—request daily updates on any threats."

Donovan clears his throat. "About that... you'll want to meet with Alistair at dawn."

I frown. "Why?"

"Are the Fae causing problems?" Isolde tenses beside me.

"Let's just say their situation has... evolved." Donovan shrugs. "Alistair will explain better."

"Fine. Next issue—our Luna has challenged her father for Laurel River Pack. Victory is certain, meaning we'll soon integrate a large number of wolves."

The room erupts in murmurs.

Lillian voices the obvious concern. "Where will we house them all?"

"I've consulted the elders." Isolde steps forward. "We're acquiring the land bridging our territory to Adrian and Sebastian's packs. This creates a unified border, with the canyon becoming shared grounds for gatherings."

Gideon rubs his jaw. "We can temporarily lodge them in the packhouse and volunteer homes. Construction moves fast—they'll have houses within months."

Donovan raises an eyebrow. "And the land cost?"

"The terrain makes it cheap," I explain. "But the elders proposed a trade: Grace's father's territory for this land. They gain fertile soil; we gain strategic space."

Leopold crosses his arms. "Luna, some wolves won't follow a female Alpha. How do we handle dissenters?"

Isolde's gaze hardens. "Intel from my father's Gamma suggests the pack is discontent. Most will welcome change."

I add coldly, "Those who refuse can go rogue or beg another pack's mercy."

"We'll announce everything tomorrow night." I dismiss the meeting. "Prepare for upheaval."

As we exit, Donovan smirks. "So technically, you'll both be Alphas now."

I pull Isolde against me, my hand possessive on her waist. "We already are."

###Chapter 0417

Morning light found me restored. When Victor and I descended for breakfast, the "sprite situation" became instantly clear. Luna and Stella stood nearly five feet tall now, their ethereal glow undiminished despite their new humanoid forms.

"Lady Isolde! Lady Isolde!" They chimed in unison before engulfing me in a radiant embrace.

I stiffened at the unexpected affection before awkwardly returning their hug. "Oh...hello."

"Give her space, little stars," Alistair chided gently. The twins immediately stepped back, flanking their mate like celestial bodyguards.

"Look!" Luna swept her silver hair aside to reveal the claiming mark. Stella mirrored the gesture with identical enthusiasm.

My lips curved. "You're mated!"

"Alistair and Orion chose us," Stella breathed, gazing at their mate with adoration.

Alistair kissed each twin's forehead in turn. The domestic scene would've been sweet if not for their bizarre height transformation.

"But how...?" I gestured at their elongated forms.

"When we find forever mates..." Luna began.

"We can shift like wolves do," Stella continued.

"Human forms are better for public outings..."

"And private moments," Luna finished with a giggle that made Orion purr audibly.

Victor's jaw tightened at their rapid-fire chatter. I squeezed his arm before addressing the twins. "Do you understand werewolf mating bonds?"

"Alistair is ours," Stella declared.

"We share our light only with him and Orion," Luna added.

Victor cleared his throat. "Have you considered living arrangements?"

Alistair straightened. "Actually, Alpha, we'd like to relocate nearer the forest. The girls want to be close to their kin. Tobias mentioned similar plans for Elara."

"We'll discuss it tomorrow," Victor said. "There are pack announcements tonight that may affect housing decisions."

As they departed, I murmured to Victor, "Well, that answers how interspecies mating works."

During breakfast, Victor mind-linked the pack about tonight's gathering. I confirmed provisions with Rosalind, who noted decreased communal dining as more homes became habitable.

In the gardens, the twins found me again, their movements still eerily weightless despite their height.

"Alistair said we should help the pack," Stella announced.

"What can you do?" I asked.

They exchanged glances.

"We fly."

"We glow."

"We nurture life." Luna brushed a tomato vine. Before our eyes, the plant surged upward, fruits swelling to double their size.

Victoria gaped. "You did that?"

Stella giggled. "It's what we are."

As they moved through the rows, plants straightened like soldiers at attention, leaves deepening to emerald, blossoms bursting forth in technicolor. The garden transformed under their touch, becoming a living tapestry of abundance.

Victoria gripped my arm. "Lady Isolde...this changes everything."

The twins turned, their smiles luminous. "Where next?"

###Chapter 0418

"What in the world—?" Seraphina gasped, her eyes wide with amazement.

I couldn't blame her. I knew they were Sylvan Fae, but I never imagined the plants would react to them like this.

When Luna and Stella returned to us, their faces glowed with satisfaction as they surveyed the garden.

"How did you do that?" Seraphina asked, still staring at the vibrant blooms.

"Plants have feelings too," Luna explained.

"They work tirelessly," Stella added.

"Growing, nourishing, giving life."

"But sometimes they grow weary."

"Or lonely."

"So we shared our light with them."

"And now they're happy again."

"You're hired," I declared without hesitation.

They turned to me, eyes sparkling. "Hired for what?" they asked in unison, practically bouncing with excitement.

"From now on, you're our official garden caretakers."

The twins squealed, clapping their hands and hopping in place.

"This is perfect!"

"We'll make sure every plant thrives!"

"Alistair will be so proud!"

"Maybe he'll give us belly rubs again!"

"Or do that thing with his—"

"ENOUGH!" I cut in loudly before their imaginations could run wild. "You can discuss that with Alistair later. Preferably in private."

"Thank you, Lady Isolde."

"Nice meeting you, Lady Seraphina."

+15 BONDS

"We'll return tomorrow to check on our plants," they announced before skipping away, presumably to find Alistair.

Once they were gone, Seraphina and I exchanged glances before bursting into laughter. "Life here is never dull," she remarked, peeling off her gardening gloves.

"Honestly? I've never seen a garden this lush. They might be eccentric, but their skills are undeniable," I admitted, turning toward the packhouse.

As I approached the flower beds near the back, I noticed something peculiar—a cluster of flowers that kept wilting and reviving in cycles. Peering closer, I spotted Elara crouched among the blossoms. With each quiet sniffle, the flowers drooped, only to perk up again when she touched them.

"Elara?"

She jumped at my voice. "Oh! Lady Isolde. Good morning." She hastily wiped her eyes before looking up.

"What are you doing out here?" I asked, settling onto the edge of the flower bed.

"Am I not allowed here?" She started to rise, her movements hesitant.

"No, of course not," I assured her. "Stay as long as you like. But why the tears?"

She sank back down, fingers brushing a wilting petal. "You saw Luna and Stella?"

"Yes. They've taken human forms since mating with Alistair."

She nodded, avoiding my gaze. "I'm happy for them. Truly. This is what we all dream of—being loved, being whole." Her voice cracked as she touched another fading flower.

"Did something happen between you and Theodore?" I kept my tone gentle.

"No. Theodore is wonderful. Kind, patient... perfect." Her fingers trembled against the blossom.

"Then what's wrong?"

"I'm broken," she whispered, and the flower in her hand withered completely.

+15 BONDS

"Oh, Elara." Without thinking, I gathered her into my arms, cradling her like a child. "Theodore knew about your wing before he claimed you. He chose you exactly as you are."

She buried her face in my shoulder, fingers clutching her unusual garments. "But now he's seen what it means to be complete."

Pulling back, her tear-filled eyes met mine. "I'm happy for my sisters, truly. I just wish I could be the mate Theodore deserves. He's been so good to me, but I'll never transform fully without my wing."

"Isolde! Have you seen—" Theodore's panicked voice cut through the garden. He skidded to a halt when he spotted Elara in my arms.

"Elara, I've searched everywhere for you," he murmured, carefully lifting her from my lap.

As fresh tears spilled down her cheeks, he pulled her close. "Sweetheart, I'm sorry. I didn't realize... Listen to me—I don't care about forms or wings. I only care about you."

"I'll leave you two to talk," I said, stroking Elara's hair. "But remember, Elara, wolves mate for life. To Theodore, nothing matters more than having you by his side."

She nodded against his shoulder as he mouthed "Thank you" over her head.

Walking away, I knew what I had to do.

I needed to speak with King Oberon. There had to be a way to heal Elara's wing.

###Chapter 0419

While Isolde checks on the packhouse, I take a deep breath and head toward the border. The patrols are running their usual routes, but today they have unusual company - a group of Sylvan Fae darting alongside them like playful fireflies. I can't tell if they're assisting or just amusing themselves.

I approach the tree line. "Oberon? Titania?" My voice carries through the woods. Though I'm not sure of the proper way to summon them, their curiosity about our kind should keep them nearby.

"Alpha Victor!" Their voices chime in unison as they materialize before me, eyes sparkling with excitement.

"Good day. I need to discuss some concerning developments and request your help."

After explaining the hunter situation, I receive their eager agreement to provide daily updates through one of our ranked members. With that settled, I return to the packhouse.

The elders have left the land contract waiting. I summon Leopold to review the property lines, ensuring the territory can accommodate both our current needs and Edgar Winter's incoming pack. By the time we've marked potential building sites, afternoon shadows stretch long across the grounds - pack meeting time approaches.

Upstairs, I find Isolde preparing. I pull her close for a brief kiss before moving to our closet. "How was your day?"

She shares her worries about Elara and wanting to consult Oberon. "You should continue training with him and your Guardian sisters. That last effort drained all three of you too much. Next time, let's have him come here - he can check on Elara while you train."

"I'll call him at dawn. What about you? Ready for tonight's meeting? We have much to share."

"I'm prepared. Our pack adapts well. I'm not concerned about welcoming your father's people. The hunters worry me more. I did speak with Oberon and Titania - they'll monitor the forest and report daily."

As we step outside toward the makeshift stage, savory aromas drift from the kitchen. "That smells incredible."

"Rosalind outdid herself again."

The gathering pack radiates calm energy - laughter and conversation filling the air. I take Isolde's hand as we ascend the platform.

"Good evening, everyone." My voice carries across the crowd.

A unified "Good evening, Alpha" echoes back.

"We have important matters to discuss tonight - some joyful, some concerning. Afterwards, our kitchen staff has prepared a feast, so please stay for dinner."

"First, as you know, twenty of us competed in Luna's Challenge. While final rankings aren't official, I'm proud to announce Sanctuary Pack placed in the top three." The clearing erupts in cheers and howls.

I gesture to Leopold. "Your Beta took first place in his division." More celebration erupts, warriors pounding his back.

"Additionally, Warrior Gideon defeated over 3300 competitors to win the warrior trials. For this achievement, he's been named our new Lead Warrior." The crowd shifts their enthusiasm toward Gideon with renewed vigor.

###Chapter 0420

"Your Luna and I couldn't be prouder of our pack's performance. No one will ever doubt our strength again."

A murmur ripples through the crowd.

"But some of you may not know—we were ambushed by hunters on the final day of the tournament." Gasps erupt. Not everyone had heard.

Over a thousand hunters launched a coordinated attack, targeting every ranked member of the North American packs.

What they didn’t expect?

Three Guardians stood in their way.

I pull Isolde closer, my arm around her.

"Your Luna and her sisters saved countless lives that day. But some hunters escaped. They’ll report back about the Guardians’ power—and they will come for her."

Snarls tear through the crowd. I raise a hand for silence.

"Gideon, our new Lead Warrior, has doubled patrols. We’ll also need to clear and restock the old bunkers. I know you’re all exhausted. But I’m asking you to keep pushing—for our pack’s survival."

No complaints. Just determined nods. These wolves have fought too hard to lose now.

"Questions?"

I answer a few—mostly about the bunker preparations, which Isolde and Aurora will oversee.

Then I drop the next bombshell.

"Your Luna was born an Alpha female. Her father banished her at twelve for not shifting. At the tournament, she challenged him for his pack."

Dead silence. Every eye locks onto Isolde.

"We expect her to win. That means absorbing 175 new members soon."

Murmurs of surprise.

"We’ve struck a deal with the elders—we’ll trade her old pack’s lands for territory bordering Blackthorn and Nightshade. More space for new homes."

+15 BONDS

More questions erupt—when’s the fight? What if her old pack rebels?

I hold up a hand.

"One last thing. The next mate gathering is in two weeks. It’s our chance to showcase our progress—and welcome new members."

A smirk tugs at my lips.

"Oh, and your Luna invited another pack. Their Alpha female is seeking a mate… and her father’s successor."

Excitement explodes through the room.

I clap once. "That’s all. Dinner’s ready in the hall. Enjoy your night."

###Chapter 0421

The moment we finished dinner, Victor pulled me upstairs to our private quarters. His hands tightened around my waist as he pressed his forehead against mine. "Isolde, we need to prepare for your father's challenge."

I frowned, tilting my head. "Why? He stands no chance against me."

Victor's grip tightened. "Every Alpha witnessed your power at the gathering. Your father knows he can't win fairly." His breath warmed my skin. "What would a desperate man do in his position?"

The realization hit me like a punch. My father would never fight honorably. "What's your plan?"

"We'll bring reinforcements from our pack." Victor's fingers traced my spine. "But more importantly, I've contacted Alistair Grey. As an elder, his presence would ensure fair play."

"Do you think he'll agree?"

Victor's lips curved. "We'll find out tomorrow."

At dawn, I met with Seraphina and Evelyn to arrange our next training session with King Oberon. "Perfect timing!" Seraphina clapped her hands. "We can visit your new marketplace!"

"If you come for the mate gathering next week," I said, excitement bubbling in my chest, "you'll see Isabella's boutique. She's creating custom designs, including something special for Ivy."

I'd walked through our developing marketplace yesterday. The scent of fresh coffee from the new bakery still lingered in my memory. Three more shops were nearly ready for opening.

"Julian needs new clothes too!" Evelyn chimed in.

I laughed. "Of course he does."

"We'll arrive early to shop," Seraphina decided. "Stay for dinner, then return the following week for the baby clothes."

Later, I called King Oberon about relocating our training session. My voice dropped when I mentioned Elara's injury. "There might be a solution," he mused, "but I'll need to examine her in person."

Summer and I reviewed housing arrangements. With new pack members arriving and another pack visiting for the gathering, we repurposed empty rooms on the Beta and Gamma floors. We assigned Alistair and his daughter Vivian to our private wing.

Pack members volunteered to host newcomers until their homes were built. Their generosity warmed my heart - we were truly becoming a family.

Victor secured Alistair Grey's support for the challenge. The elder agreed my father would likely cheat without oversight.

The week vanished in a blur of construction and preparations. Victor and I collapsed into bed each night, exhausted but fulfilled.

On the eve of the challenge, Victor forced me to rest early. "You're not invincible, love." He ordered dinner to our room, creating a rare moment of peace.

"How are you feeling?" His piercing gaze searched mine.

I sighed. "Conflicted. He's my father... but he chose this path when he banished me, hurt my mother, and took Vivian as his mate." My fists clenched. "Whenever I soften, I remember Mother clutching her chest, that final moment of realization before-" My voice broke. "This pack is my birthright. A true Alpha would have passed leadership to me willingly."

"Can you live with killing him?" Victor asked softly.

"Yes." The word came easier than I expected. "Beneath the pain, he's just a man who abused his power, his mate bond, and his role as a father."

Victor pulled me onto his lap. "Whatever happens tomorrow, I'm with you."

I curled against his chest, drawing strength from his steady heartbeat as I contemplated the coming dawn.

Alistair Grey arrived at first light. "Thank you for coming," I greeted him.

"Luna Isolde." He inclined his head. "This intervention is necessary, regrettably."

"Please, call me Isolde."

"Only if you call me Alistair."

By seven, our convoy rolled toward my father's territory. The three-hour journey felt like traveling through a ghost town. The once-vibrant homes now stood peeling and cracked, weeds choking the neglected gardens.

When we reached the pack house, the contrast stunned me. Immaculate lawns, freshly painted walls, blooming flowers everywhere. Victor met my gaze and shook his head in disgust.

###Chapter 0422

The moment our cars rolled to a stop, Vivian stood waiting with my half-brother cradled against her chest. A fading bruise marred her cheekbone—a sight I knew too well. My father's signature.

I approached cautiously, scanning the empty grounds. Where was the pack? Where were the warriors meant to intimidate us?

"Luna." I kept my voice soft. "I don't believe we were properly introduced last time."

"Vivian." Her fingers tightened around the sleeping toddler. "I renounced my title after... recent events."

A gentle touch on her arm. "Are you safe?"

Tears glistened in her eyes as she whispered, "I swear I didn't know what he was."

"I believe you." My gesture summoned Victor forward. "Our offer still stands. The Obsidian Moon Pack will shelter you."

Victor's voice carried quiet authority. "You'll have our full protection."

I studied the child's peaceful face. "What's his name?"

"Julian." Her smile flickered like candlelight before dying. "They're all waiting out back. Be warned—he's not fighting fair today."

I nodded toward Magnus. "We brought insurance."

Her gasp told me she recognized the elder.

The packhouse exterior lied. Inside looked like a tornado had torn through it—shattered furniture, splintered doorframes, walls gouged with claw marks.

"Alpha Edgar... hasn't been himself since your last meeting." Vivian led us through the wreckage toward the backyard.

The entire pack stood in tense silence, forming a hollow circle. The air tasted metallic with fear.

"Finally." My father's voice dripped venom as I stepped into the clearing. He swung twin swords with erratic fury, his pupils blown wide. Madness had claimed him—whether from my survival or his mate's rejection, I couldn't tell.

Victor flanked my right, Magnus my left. The elder's voice boomed. "Weapons nullify a challenge's legitimacy, Alpha Edgar. Shift or fight human—your choice."

My father's snarl twisted his face. "You brought a babysitter."

"I know how you cheat." My gaze swept over the malnourished pack members. Their sunken eyes widened at my appearance—proof my father had lied about my fate.

Dust swirled as I stepped forward. "By bloodright, I challenge you for leadership of Silverbrook Pack."

I wore only workout gear, barefoot for quick shifting. My father had armored himself like a human knight—a fatal miscalculation.

The first rush came predictably. His padded clothing hindered his swing. My counterpunch sent him sprawling.

"Bitch!" He tore off layers, spittle flying. "Just like your whore mother!"

My uppercut snapped his head back. "The only disgrace here is you."

His next attack was all animal rage—wide eyes, frothing mouth. When his leg sweep failed, my kick connected with his temple.

Blood sprayed as he spat out a broken tooth. "Mine!" He lunged again—then cold steel pierced my abdomen.

Victor's roar shook the trees.

I gripped my father's wrist, yanking him closer. "Silver can't kill a Guardian." My free hand plunged into his chest. Aurora's claws flexed around his pounding heart.

His gasp mirrored my mother's final breath.

"Feel that?" I whispered as his life pulsed in my palm. "This is how she felt every day."

The rip echoed through the silent clearing. His body collapsed like a marionette with cut strings.

###Chapter 0423

My breath catches as Alpha Dominic drives the blade into Isolde's abdomen. Even with her strength, a knife wound is no small matter. The madness in his eyes confirms what we already knew—he's lost all control. This rabid wolf would need to be put down regardless of the challenge.

When Isolde tears his heart from his chest, I rush forward, yanking the knife free. I brace to catch her, but she turns to face the pack instead. Though every instinct screams to tend to my mate, I know she must claim her victory. I step back, remaining close enough to intervene.

"Does anyone dare challenge my right as your Alpha?" Her voice rings with undeniable authority, pride swelling in my chest. No one would guess she's bleeding from a stomach wound as she crushes the heart in her fist and flings it to the dirt.

Not a single voice rises in protest. The entire Silverbrook Pack kneels, baring their throats in submission. "Those unwilling to follow me and my mate may leave. But these lands now belong to Sanctuary. The council has traded this territory to expand our existing pack. Anyone joining Sanctuary will receive transport, shelter, and food until you're self-sufficient."

Thank the Moon Goddess we brought Donovan and Seraphina, leaving Leopold and Lillian to manage the pack. The moment Isolde finishes speaking, I sweep her into my arms, carrying her to Seraphina for treatment.

"You were magnificent, love." I press my lips to her temple.

"These people are starving and poorly clothed." Isolde winces as Seraphina probes the wound. "Another project for us, Alpha."

Seraphina nods approvingly. "Your healing has already begun, Luna. That immunity of yours just saved your life."

"We'll speak with everyone today." Isolde meets my gaze. "How many can we transport?"

I assess our vehicles. "Forty-five at most. Priority goes to the injured, elderly, and pups."

The day passes in triage. Malnutrition runs rampant, especially among omegas. We load the critical cases first, sending them back with Seraphina. Subsequent trips carry the frail elders and starving pups. I dispatch Donovan and Alistair with the convoys—the latter came for the challenge, but his own duties await.

+15 RONDS

Isolde and I remain overnight to process more transfers, expecting fresh vehicles tomorrow. After settling the remaining pack members, we survey the ruined packhouse.

The kitchen is demolished, spoiled food rotting in broken appliances. I send warriors to hunt—they return with three deer. We build a fire, and with the pack's help, prepare a meager dinner. Isolde insists everyone eats before us. Tomorrow's convoy will bring proper supplies.

That night, we comb through the Alpha's quarters. Hidden stashes reveal over $100,000 in cash, hoarded food stores, and member files—all destined for Sanctuary.

"He could've used this to help his people." Isolde shakes her head. "It's incomprehensible."

"Your father wasn't in his right mind, love." I pull her close. "Now we can make things right."

Near dawn, I fashion a makeshift bed from salvaged linens. "Rest, my Luna. Tomorrow will be long."

She curls against me, head on my chest. "Is there anything here you want to keep?" I massage her shoulders.

"Nothing." Her sigh carries generations of pain. "No traces of my mother. No pieces of myself."

She trembles slightly. "Will it always be like this? One mountain after another?"

I tilt her chin up. "Look how far we've come. We built a thriving pack from nothing. Homes. Businesses. Found mates for our people. Did I expect sprites in our ranks? Or acquiring a second pack so soon? Never." My thumb brushes her cheekbone. "But together, we're rewriting destinies—for our pack, our future pups. The struggle now will birth a legacy."

When she smiles, I kiss her nose. "How are you so wise?"

I smirk. "According to my brilliant mate, I'm ancient. Wisdom comes with wrinkles."

Her laughter rings through the ruins, the sweetest victory of all.

###Chapter 0424

Morning light finds me aching in every muscle. The stab wound throbs, but it's the hard floor that really did a number on me. A few thin blankets and my mate's warmth were all that stood between me and complete misery. His scent wrapped around me like a healing balm, the mate bond stitching me back together while we slept.

The pack gathers for breakfast with the supplies we scavenged. I notice the absence immediately—my father's Beta is gone, along with a handful of others. Good riddance. If they can't accept Victor and me as their Alphas, they don't belong here. That Beta knew what my father did to my mother and me. He turned a blind eye. Cowards like that have no place in my pack.

Donovan returns with the caravan, ready to transport more of our people home. We planned for this—multiple trips, long hours, but by nightfall, everyone will have a roof over their heads and a hot meal.

We help families pack what they can carry. Furniture will have to wait. Victor arranged for a moving truck, but it won't arrive until afternoon. Anything salvageable goes to Nathaniel—he's got a knack for repurposing broken things.

The first van leaves with Donovan at the wheel. His eyes widen when he realizes the duffel bags at his feet are stuffed with cash. "Smaller amounts next time," I tell him. "Just in case."

By 9 AM, the first group is on their way to Sanctuary. The moving truck rolls in at noon, and we load it with beds, tables, whatever our new pack members couldn't bear to leave behind. When the vans return at 4 PM, we're still securing the last pieces. Victor and I wait until every person and every crate is accounted for before squeezing into the final vehicle.

Exhaustion hits hard. I'm asleep before we cross the territory line. Victor's gentle nudge wakes me as we pull up to the packhouse. Leopold and Lillian have everything under control—directing newcomers to temporary housing, assigning guides.

"I need to check on the wounded from yesterday," I tell Victor. "Meet you later. Rosalind needs a food inventory update too."

He pulls me close, his lips brushing mine. "I'll make sure everyone's settled. Let me know if you need anything."

The pack hospital hums with activity. Several rooms are occupied. I find Seraphina briefing a trainee near the entrance.

"Luna," she says, spotting me. "Didn't expect you back tonight."

"Wouldn't want to miss your charming company." I nod toward the rooms. "Status update?"

She walks me through each case. Most are kids recovering from malnutrition, elders regaining strength. The last room holds Vivian.

"Her rejection wasn't accepted before her mate died," Seraphina explains. "It's left her weak."

"And Julian?"

"Healthy as can be. We let her see him often, but she can't handle his energy for long. Honestly, I'm amazed she survived the trip. That woman's got a will of steel."

###Chapter 0425

I step into the dimly lit room, shutting the door with a soft click. The scent of antiseptic lingers in the air as I take the seat beside Vivian's bed, reaching for her trembling hand.

"Hello, Seraphina." Her voice cracks, raw with exhaustion.

"Vivian. I spoke with Gamma Seraphina. Tell me what you need."

She shakes her head weakly. "I thought... I hoped it wouldn't come to this."

My fingers brush against her frail arm. "Take all the time you need. The entire pack stands with you. That's who we are—we don't let anyone suffer alone."

A tear slips down her cheek. "Thank you, Luna." She hesitates, then meets my gaze. "You've experienced both sides of the mate bond. What you share with Alpha Victor... it's everything the legends promise. But what I had with your father..." Her voice trails off.

"He wasn't cruel. But he wasn't kind either. And now, knowing what he did to your mother... to you..." Her grip tightens. "How can I ever trust fate again?"

"When I met Victor, I swore I'd never take a mate." My throat tightens at the memory. "After watching my mother waste away in that marriage... I thought the bond was a curse."

I lean closer. "But Victor proved me wrong. It's not the bond that matters—it's the person. I know with absolute certainty he'd never hurt me the way my father did. We respect each other. We chose each other."

A small smile touches my lips. "Somewhere between midnight conversations and shared dreams, I fell for the man—not just the bond. His values mirror mine. His vision for the future aligns with my own. That's what makes it real."

Standing, I adjust her blanket. "Heal first. Focus on your son. The rest will come when it's meant to."

My arms wrap gently around her shoulders. "I'll check on you tomorrow. Levi's being cared for—just concentrate on getting stronger for him."

The hospital doors swing shut behind me as I stride toward the packhouse kitchens.

"Rosalind!"

The head cook whirls around, flour dusting her apron. Dark circles shadow her eyes.

"Luna." She attempts a tired smile.

"I know we're stretched thin. What do you need?"

"Three more hands and two extra ovens?" Her laugh holds no humor.

"If only." I mirror her weary chuckle. "Gamma Donovan secured extra supplies. Beta Lillian organized ration distribution."

"Thank the Moon Goddess." She rubs her temple. "It's chaos, but..."

"Chaos is our normal, isn't it?"

Her laughter rings genuine this time. "Ain't that the truth."

"Victor and I are meeting the new members tomorrow. You'll have more helpers soon."

"Bless you." She hesitates. "When things settle... there's something else I'd like to discuss."

"Name the time." I squeeze her flour-dusted hand.

My bedroom door closes with finality. The shower washes away the day's weight before I collapse into bed. Victor's arms encircle me the moment I settle against the sheets, his warmth seeping into my bones.

Tomorrow will bring fresh challenges. But tonight, wrapped in my mate's embrace, I let exhaustion claim me.

###Chapter 0426

After confirming with Leopold that all newcomers had been temporarily housed, I made my rounds through the packhouse. Every room was occupied, stocked with fresh linens and spare clothes. Satisfied, I stepped outside to survey the rest of Sanctuary.

I visited each home that had opened its doors to refugees, ensuring no conflicts had arisen. Most were adapting well, their relief palpable.

By the time I returned, Isolde was already asleep. A quick shower washed away the exhaustion of the past days before I slid into bed beside her.

Morning brought the scent of breakfast and the murmur of voices. Gathering both new members and ranked warriors—except Seraphina, who remained at the medical ward—I addressed the crowd.

"Welcome to Sanctuary." My voice carried over the dining hall. "I trust you've rested well and eaten your fill." A ripple of agreement followed. I introduced our leadership, then gestured toward the construction sites visible through the windows.

"Sanctuary is rising from the ground up. That means you'll build your own homes." I outlined the repayment system for materials and labor. "You'll also be assigned roles. If you have specialized skills, inform me or Beta Leopold—we're establishing storefronts on the new market street. Otherwise, there's no shortage of work here."

Over the next few days, they'd learn our borders while our warriors assessed their abilities. Questions arose about previous trades and wages—all answered before I yielded the floor to Lillian.

"Sanctuary lives by its name," she declared. "Respect is given and expected. Violence earns banishment. If these terms don't suit you, leave now. But if you stay, tomorrow's ceremony will bind you to this pack."

Dismissing them to explore, I noted the crowd's composition. Of the 150 survivors, many were parents who'd value safety for their pups. Several approached immediately—carpenters sent to Nathaniel, laborers assigned to Donovan's construction crews.

The omegas needed more recovery time, but their determination shone through. Lillian and Rosalind paired them with Isabella and Aurora for skill evaluations.

By dusk, thirty had departed—mostly lone males and elderly pairs unwilling to rebuild. The next evening, beneath torchlight, 105 wolves swore allegiance. Fourteen juveniles would pledge later. Music and feasting lasted till moonrise, celebrating our growing strength.

Before the festivities ended, I announced the upcoming mate gathering, drawing curious glances toward the sylvan fae—Elara perched on Theodore's shoulder, Luna and Stella flanking Alistair.

Later, I asked Alistair about his mating marks. Unlike wolves, the fae bore paired circles glowing above their hearts. "No beginning, no end," he explained, shirt pulled aside to reveal the intertwined symbols. "Eternal love, shared light." Even I, no admirer of fae, couldn't deny the beauty of such devotion.

As embers faded in the fire pits, I drew Lillian onto my lap. The pack's joy hummed around us, but in that moment, only her warmth mattered—a beacon in the gathering dark.

###Chapter 0427

The week had flown by, and everyone had adjusted to their new roles. All the omegas were medically cleared and assigned positions within the pack.

I met with Rosalind after Beatrice, the Lead Omega in my father’s pack kitchen, requested to split shifts with her.

"Rosalind," I said when we sat in my office, "I wanted to discuss Beatrice’s request. I don’t want you to feel like I’m undermining your role, but I thought this could give you more free time."

She hesitated before speaking. "Actually, Luna, I wanted to talk to you about something else. I’ve noticed others in the pack starting businesses, and I was wondering if I could do the same."

My brows lifted. "What kind of business?"

"A diner," she said, excitement flickering in her eyes. "I know how to manage kitchens and schedule staff. I’ve even been experimenting with new recipes. But I’d need help with the business side."

I grinned. "That’s a fantastic idea! Your food is already loved here. What do you need to get started?"

She bit her lip. "Well, I don’t have a business partner yet. Unless… you have someone in mind?"

A thought struck me. It had been months since I last spoke to Reginald. He’d mentioned selling his diner and retiring, but knowing him, he’d be bored within weeks.

"I might know someone," I said. "But I’ll need to check first. For now, let’s go see Alpha Victor and secure you a storefront."

Victor was just as enthusiastic about the idea. He added her to the waiting list, estimating three months until construction finished.

Once Rosalind left, I brought up Reginald.

"Call him," Victor said. "If he agrees, we’ll handle the rest."

"Thank you, Alpha." I winked before swaying toward the door, earning a low growl from my mate.

Later, Little Alpha. His voice echoed in my mind, followed by a vivid image of exactly what he planned to do to me. Heat pooled low in my stomach.

Keep that up, and the whole packhouse will know you’re turning me on.

Come back here, and I’ll take care of it. His growl sent shivers down my spine.

I turned, locking the door behind me.

Twenty minutes later, relaxed and satisfied, I called Reginald.

"Hello?"

"Reginald, it’s Isolde."

"Isolde! I’ve been worried sick. How are you?"

"Busy," I admitted. "How’s retirement?"

"Boring as hell," he grumbled.

I smirked. "What if I told you I have a way to fix that?"

"I’m listening."

I pitched the idea, and within minutes, he was on board. We agreed to meet in two weeks.

That evening, Alpha Alistair arrived with his daughter and several pack members for tomorrow’s gathering. Victor and I greeted them outside the packhouse.

"Alpha Alistair," I said warmly as he stepped out of his car. "It’s good to see you again."

He scanned the area before approaching, his daughter trailing behind him.

###Chapter 0428

"Alpha Victor, Luna Isolde, this is my daughter, Natalia."

The evening passed in pleasant conversation as we got acquainted with Natalia and Alpha Alistair. Victor gave him a tour of our pack's recent developments while I chatted with the Alpha's daughter. Natalia was charming—polished and refined in a way that made me acutely aware of my own rough edges. Maybe this was how proper Alpha females were supposed to be. Either way, I liked her and hoped she'd find her mate this weekend.

By morning, I was double-checking preparations with Rosalind and Beatrice. With nearly four hundred unmated wolves and sprites arriving tonight, we needed everything perfect. Just as I finalized the food arrangements, the front door swung open.

"Isolde! Your sisters are here!" Seraphina and Vivian's voices rang through the packhouse, already teasing and laughing. I rushed to greet them, the three of us colliding in a tight embrace.

"Give me a second to grab my bag," I said, pulling away. "Though I still can't drive, so unless you want to walk..."

"Let's walk," Seraphina decided. "I want to see what you've done with the place."

"Sebastian mentioned you've been building more than just houses," Vivian added.

So we toured the pack grounds—the new hospital, the residential area—before reaching Main Street. They raided the market first, filling bags with fresh produce. Then we stopped by Nathaniel's workshop, where he showcased his latest furniture pieces. Both sisters placed orders for desks and chairs, knowing there'd be a wait. Vivian even commissioned a crib.

"Won't Julian be too old for a crib by then?" I asked.

"Julian will be, but this one won't." She patted her stomach.

Seraphina and I shrieked, hugging her again. "Congratulations!"

"Thank you!"

"It happened when Sebastian carried you into the woods during the tournament, didn't it?" Seraphina narrowed her eyes.

Vivian shrugged. "Definitely at the tournament, but who knows which time? Either way, we're pretty sure it's a girl."

"How?"

"Sebastian scented Julian immediately. This one? Nothing. We think she takes after me." Aurora confirmed it—raspberries, subtle but unmistakable. A girl.

Next, we visited Isabella's boutique. "Good. Maybe this one will actually look like you," Seraphina teased. "If you hadn't birthed Julian, no one would believe he's yours."

"I love having a mini-Sebastian," Vivian laughed. "But as long as she's healthy, I don't care who she resembles."

Inside, the racks of handmade clothing captivated them. With new staff, Isabella's inventory had expanded. They ordered outfits for their kids, a set for Vivian's newborn, and something for themselves before we headed back.

Dinner brought everyone together—Adrian, Sebastian, Victor, Alpha Alistair, and Natalia. The packhouse courtyard had transformed: fairy lights, music, clusters of seating for mingling. Sprites drifted among the wolves, and within hours, several pairs had already sensed their bonds.

As predicted, Natalia drew attention—but by night's end, her mate hadn't appeared. She remained gracious, though disappointment shadowed her smile.

"Worth trying," Alpha Alistair sighed. "At least others found mates tonight."

"You're both welcome to every gathering we host," I offered. "We rotate locations. Her mate might not be of age yet or couldn't attend tonight."

He thanked me, though his smile didn't reach his eyes.

We said our goodnights, and Victor and I retreated to our room.

###Chapter 0429

The week following the gathering of mates flew by in a blur of activity. Our pack worked tirelessly while preparing to host King Oberon and Prince Finnian for the upcoming training session. Several disciplinary issues arose that required either my or Isolde's intervention. Some members had foolishly assumed we wouldn't enforce consequences for their aggressive behavior toward fellow packmates.

Fortunately, the holding cells stood freshly cleaned and ready. Those who tested our patience soon found themselves locked inside for a night of reflection - contemplating whether they truly wished to remain part of this pack.

Isolde organized teams of newer members to restock and prepare the underground bunkers. With our growing numbers - particularly the omegas who wouldn't participate in combat - we needed every available shelter space in case of another hunter attack.

Sebastian and Adrian gathered disturbing intelligence from various supernatural sources. The hunters' activities had escalated - abducting supernaturals for experimentation or execution. Alistair currently led a reconnaissance team attempting to locate hunter compounds. We'd hoped their defeat at Luna's Challenge would force retreat, but they'd simply shifted targets to other supernatural communities.

The Sylvan Fae maintained vigilant patrols through our expanded territory. Their numbers had grown since several found mates within Blackthorn and Nightshade packs, allowing their watch to extend across all three territories seamlessly.

For Oberon and Finnian's visit, Isolde arranged a special vegetarian feast. Like the fae, elves revered all forest life and abstained from consuming woodland creatures. Out of respect, we'd removed all venison and rabbit dishes from the menu during their stay.

At noon on their arrival day, Adrian, Evelyn, Sebastian and Seraphina joined us for lunch. The nursery construction had finished just in time, allowing us to leave the children in capable hands while we ate.

Sebastian wasted no time addressing concerns. "Last training was limited with both Evelyn and Seraphina pregnant." He kissed his mate's temple. "Now with Seraphina expecting again, and after witnessing the power surge during the tournament... I'm uncomfortable practicing energy transfers as planned. Not with Seraphina involved. I won't risk her or our child."

"Let's hear Oberon's training plan first," Seraphina suggested. "He may have alternative methods. If not, I can channel power outward instead of having Evelyn or Isolde pull it. That way I control the flow."

"And I can practice with Isolde," Evelyn added. "She's already drawn my power instinctively. With Oberon's guidance, she'll learn to regulate the intake."

"We'll proceed carefully," Isolde assured everyone. "Frequent breaks if necessary."

After lunch, we gathered in the shaded backyard while nursery staff brought the children out to play.

"The pack's transformation is remarkable," Adrian remarked as we watched our mates playing with the little ones.

"Still work ahead," I acknowledged, "but we're getting there. I've drafted expansion plans for the new territory. Several members have requested homesites and proposed a second marketplace closer to that area." I turned to Sebastian. "Donovan's been invaluable, by the way. His construction expertise and innovative planning have been game-changers for our development."

"He's among my best," Sebastian agreed. "I'd like to offer positions to some of your skilled members if you're amenable."

Our discussion about pack expansion continued until movement at the tree line caught our attention. Oberon and Finnian emerged on foot, as always. Their method of travel remained one of the fae's many mysteries.

###Chapter 0430

The air hums with energy as the woodland sprites flutter around their royal visitors. Their excited chirps and whispers carry across the clearing.

Isolde and I stand at attention, preparing to greet the fae nobility. Our pack members gather behind us - Alistair with his twin mates Luna and Stella, Tobias still cradling Elara in his palms.

"King Oberon, Prince Finnian. Sanctuary Pack welcomes you." My voice rings clear through the trees. The sprites immediately drop to their knees in reverence, wings fluttering nervously. Even Tobias bends down when Elara tugs insistently at his fingers.

Through our mind link, I question Alistair. "Why are you kneeling? He's not your ruler."

His response comes swiftly. "Luna and Stella show you and our Alpha the same respect I do. It's only fair I honor their king as they would."

Tobias follows suit without hesitation.

"Rise, my children." Oberon's voice carries an ancient weight. He spreads his arms in a grand gesture that would look theatrical on anyone else. But the fae king makes it seem regal.

The sprites' adoration for their monarch is palpable. Though overjoyed by his presence, they maintain an unusual quiet - probably afraid to disrupt the solemn moment. I doubt their restraint will last long.

Oberon steps forward, his golden eyes sweeping over Alistair and his twin mates. "I see some of my people have found wolf mates."

"Yes, King Oberon."

"He's ours."

"Our fated one."

"And he cherishes us."

The fae king studies Alistair intently. "You'll protect my children with your life?"

Alistair pulls Luna and Stella closer. "They're my heart. I'd die before letting harm come to them." The twins practically melt at his words.

"Good." Oberon nods approvingly before turning to Isolde. "Now, I was told one of mine requires healing. Where is she?"

Isolde moves toward Tobias and Elara. "Elara, show King Oberon your injury."

The tiny sprite keeps her head bowed, wings drooping in shame. Tobias murmurs reassurances as Oberon approaches.

"Elara." The king's voice is surprisingly gentle.

She peeks up through her lashes. "My king." Her whisper is barely audible.

"May I?" He gestures to her damaged wing. When she nods, Tobias carefully presents her back to the king.

"Hunters tore her wing off," Tobias explains, voice tight with remembered anger.

Oberon closes his eyes, hovering his palm above Elara's back. The air shimmers as golden light gathers around his fingers. The moment the magic touches her, Elara gasps, her tiny body going rigid.

"Elara?" Tobias tenses, ready to snatch her away if the healing causes pain.

Before our eyes, gossamer wings begin regenerating from the stump. Isolde presses against me, her silent tears soaking through my shirt. I feel her joy radiating through our bond.

The gathered sprites watch in hushed awe, their soft coos barely disturbing the sacred moment. Luna and Stella cling to Alistair, their glowing tears tracing silver paths down their cheeks.

When Oberon steps back, Elara tentatively flexes her new wing. Her delighted squeal echoes through the clearing as she lifts effortlessly from Tobias's palm.

"Elara!" Tobias's voice cracks with emotion as he watches his mate hover before him.

She turns to Oberon first. "Thank you, my king!" Planting a grateful kiss on his cheek before whirling back to Tobias. "I'm whole again!"

"My beautiful sprite," Tobias murmurs, eyes shining. "You were perfect before."

"But now we can complete the bond!" Her voice trills with excitement. "I can be like Luna and Stella! A proper mate to you!" She throws herself at Tobias, tiny arms wrapping around his neck.

As we watch, her form shimmers and expands. The transformation stretches her from six inches to nearly five feet - still petite against Tobias's towering frame, but now properly proportioned.

Tobias spins her around before crushing his lips to hers. I clear my throat loudly when their embrace grows too heated. "Perhaps take this somewhere private?"

Tobias breaks away, blinking as if remembering our audience. "Right. Of course." He starts toward the packhouse before turning back abruptly. "Thank you, King Oberon! Thank you!" Then he's sprinting toward privacy with his newly healed mate.

###Chapter 0431

I quickly wipe away my tears as Thomas and Elara disappear into the house. That little sprite has a way of tugging at my heartstrings like no other. They're all precious, but Elara...there's something special about her.

"You have our deepest gratitude, Oberon." I approach the Fae king, my voice thick with emotion.

He waves a dismissive hand. "No thanks necessary. As Luna of your pack, you'd move mountains for those under your protection. I'm no different—just my methods vary from yours, Isolde. Though perhaps not as much as you might think."

Turning to the remaining sprites, Oberon asks, "Does anyone else require my attention before I begin training with the Guardians?"

A chorus of tiny voices erupts:

"Your Majesty, might we have more time with you?"

"We just want to be near your presence!"

"We promise not to disturb you!"

"We could assist with your work!"

I sense Victor's patience thinning and quickly intervene. "Why don't you all join us for dinner tonight? We'll eat in the garden, and you can tell King Oberon about your experiences with our pack. Those who attended the mating ceremony can share those stories too."

The sprites erupt in delighted chatter:

"Thank you, Luna Isolde!"

"We'll return at sunset!"

"We'll bring our finest nectar!"

As they flutter away, Oberon gives me an approving look. "You manage them beautifully."

I shrug. "Their intentions are pure. I know they irritate some." My gaze flickers to Victor. "But they're gentle souls at heart."

"The sprites have always adored werewolves," Oberon explains when Seraphina asks about their connection.

He watches the retreating sprites with a thoughtful expression. "They're peaceful creatures with little means of defense. Historically, wolves protected sprites while sprites acted as lookouts. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement." His lips quirk. "And as you've witnessed, they make remarkable mates. Sprites cherish their partners in ways we wolves appreciate, while wolves provide the security sprites crave. They actually enjoy our possessive nature—makes them feel valued."

"Exactly right." Sebastian appears behind Seraphina, wrapping her in his arms. "A true mate is our most sacred treasure. Those who don't cherish that bond don't deserve it."

Oberon strokes his chin. "I've been wondering...perhaps this generation of Guardians is stronger because you've found your fated mates. Your mates empower you, but you yourselves seem more powerful too. Only time will tell."

"Time will tell for you," Adrian remarks dryly. "We won't be around to see it."

"Fair point," Oberon chuckles. "Shall we begin?"

Valeria steps forward. "What's our focus today?"

The Fae king turns to me. "I understand you channeled power from Valeria and Seraphina. Describe that experience."

I explain the color visualization—how their auras blended with mine. Oberon nods as if this confirms his suspicions.

"So Aurora's power manifests as red. As the progenitor, her energy dominated Valeria's orange aura. Evelyn's directing ability created yet another hue that merged with yours, forming something entirely new. And you harnessed all three simultaneously."

"Precisely."

"Healing energy presents as gold—like the glow when I treated Elara. I'm curious if you could locate Evelyn's healing abilities and draw from them."

+15 BONDS

I exchange a worried glance with Seraphina. "She's expecting, and last time the power drain knocked us unconscious. We can't risk the baby." I note Sebastian's relieved exhale.

Oberon studies me intently until I fidget under his gaze. "Then perhaps," he finally says, "you should practice with me instead."

"With you?" My voice cracks on the words.

###Chapter 0432

"I possess healing abilities as well." Oberon extends his palm toward me. "Try sensing my energy."

I glance at the others before stepping forward, placing my hand lightly over his. "Reach out with your strength. If you truly are a Guardian of the Realm, you should be able to draw from my power as easily as you do from your sisters."

Now I understand why Oberon studied me so intently earlier. He was weighing the risk—whether he could trust me with this level of control over him. If I learn to siphon his energy, I could drain him or twist it for my own purposes. This is a gamble, one that speaks volumes given the strained history between fae and werewolves. The weight of his trust settles heavily in my chest.

Closing my eyes, I focus on the warmth of his skin. Aurora surges forward, guiding me as we gently probe for his aura. "Yours is green," I murmur.

"The color of the earth, where my power originates," he replies. "Now seek the layer of yellow within it."

It feels like navigating through the hues of a rainbow—searching for the next shade. Red, orange, yellow, green... I shift my awareness until the green lightens, giving way to a golden glow. "Found it," I say, opening my eyes to find Oberon watching me with sharp interest.

"Fascinating. No one has ever maneuvered through an aura like that before. Now, take hold of the yellow."

I do, pulling it into myself just as Oberon gestures to Victor. He produces a silver knife and offers it to him.

"This will test your mate’s ability to channel my healing. Silver wounds heal slowly for your kind—let’s see if she can accelerate it."

Victor meets my gaze. "Ready?"

I nod.

The blade flashes, splitting his palm open. Blood wells up, and I press my hand over the wound.

"Direct the yellow into his injury," Oberon instructs.

With Aurora’s guidance, I push the energy forward. A faint golden light emanates from my fingers, knitting his flesh back together. The moment it’s done, exhaustion slams into me like a physical blow. My legs buckle, and Victor catches me before I hit the ground, cradling me against his chest.

"What’s wrong with her?" His voice is tight with concern.

"She’s drained herself. She needs food and something sweet to drink."

Victor barks an order to Rosalind, who rushes off.

"I’m fine," I mumble, though my limbs feel like lead. "Just... tired."

"Can’t you heal her?" Victor demands.

Oberon shakes his head. "This isn’t an injury. Her body needs to recover naturally—to learn its limits."

While I rest, Seraphina steps forward. "My turn?"

"I can’t see colors like she does," Seraphina admits. "When I draw power, it’s just raw energy. No blending."

Oberon turns to Isolde, but Sebastian cuts in before he can speak. "Don’t even think about it."

With a nod, Oberon refocuses on Seraphina. "Can you distinguish between strength and healing?"

"I’m not sure."

"Let’s find out."

Rosalind returns with a tray of food and a sugary drink for me. As I eat, we watch Seraphina attempt to isolate Oberon’s healing energy. Her breathing grows labored, her movements sluggish. Adrian moves behind her, bracing her with his hands on her shoulders.

"I think... I’ve got it," she pants.

Oberon withdraws his hand, and she sags. Adrian sweeps her up, carrying her back to the seating area.

"That’s enough for today," Oberon declares. "We’ll reconvene tomorrow to work on mind-linking. If energy permits, we’ll attempt this again."

Seraphina nibbles at her food, sipping her drink until color returns to her cheeks. By dinner, we’re both restored—but the lesson lingers. Power isn’t just about strength.

It’s about trust.

And control.

###Chapter 0433

Dinner turned into a lively spectacle. The woodland sprites had returned with their endless banter. I marveled at how Isolde could engage with them without getting a migraine, but my incredible mate effortlessly played hostess, weaving in and out of their rapid-fire conversations. Seraphina and Evelyn appeared equally comfortable with the sprites' antics. Sebastian, however, made my patience seem saintly by comparison - he had zero tolerance for their chatter. Adrian fell somewhere between us and our mates in terms of endurance.

My attention drifted to Finnian doting on Ivy. Though too young to properly interact, she giggled at his antics. "Does it feel strange knowing Ivy's mate already?" I asked Adrian.

He glanced at the fae prince playing with our daughter. "For now, it's fine. But as she grows, I'll need to establish firm boundaries. Here I was worried about fighting Sebastian over his son courting my little girl, only to discover her mate is fae royalty a decade her senior. Honestly, I can't decide which scenario is worse."

As evening faded, Isolde ensured everyone settled comfortably. King Oberon and Prince Finnian received rooms on our floor. After confirming their needs were met, I whisked my mate into the shower, showing her exactly how extraordinary I found her before wrapping myself around her in bed.

Morning came early as Isolde wanted everything prepared for breakfast. We'd barely reached the kitchen when Oberon appeared, looking unusually flustered.

"Isolde, has someone occupied my room recently? There's a scent..."

"Oh Oberon, my apologies! We did have guests last week. I thought the room had been thoroughly cleaned and aired, but I'll have it refreshed immediately today."

"No!" His sharp tone softened immediately. "You misunderstand. The scent... it's intoxicating." His eyes nearly rolled back in ecstasy. I recognized that look instantly - every mated werewolf knows it. That was the look of someone who'd just scented their mate.

"Rosalind?" I watched understanding dawn in Isolde's shining eyes. She already suspected who his mate might be.

Rosalind entered and pondered briefly. "Let me check... I believe that was Alpha Natalia's room."

"Thank you, Rosalind." Isolde's expression turned calculating - I knew that scheming look well. "King Oberon, allow me to make a call. I won't presume anything, but perhaps last weekend's guest could visit again this weekend. I'll inquire and we'll see. Meanwhile, please enjoy breakfast."

Isolde left to make her call while others joined us. They greeted former packmates who'd relocated to our pack, catching up on life changes. When Isolde returned, triumph shone on her face.

"I've informed Cassandra and Rosalind we'll have additional guests staying overnight."

"I hope this doesn't lead to another disappointment for them," I mind-linked.

"He's a king. Honestly, she's perfect for him. Though Alpha Alistair will need new pack arrangements," she responded.

After breakfast, we left the babies at the nursery and headed outside.

"Today's experiment is different," Oberon announced. "We know Isolde and Victor can mind-link over distance, and that Isolde can extend this ability to Victor. First, let's see if Evelyn and Seraphina can draw from Isolde's power to link with your respective packs."

Progress came slowly, but eventually Evelyn connected with Genevieve. Next, Seraphina attempted with Sebastian hovering protectively.

"Sebastian, I'm drawing energy from her, not the reverse. I'm fine," Seraphina insisted, though he remained planted. Rolling her eyes, she focused on Isolde. The connection took longer but succeeded.

"Excellent. Next, let's see if Evelyn can channel Isolde's power to let Adrian mind-link his pack."

This proved more challenging, but eventually Adrian connected with Donovan. They repeated the process with Seraphina and Sebastian, achieving success by lunchtime when everyone needed rest.

Lunch revealed a radiant Tobias and Elara - her neck bore a fresh mate mark, and Tobias proudly displayed the glowing circle over his heart. Isolde embraced Elara, who thanked Oberon again for healing her.

That afternoon, Oberon proposed linking Isolde, Evelyn and Seraphina directly. They exchanged puzzled glances before he explained: "Your bonds are unprecedented - two mated wolf spirits and one who's their spiritual daughter. Wolves in such relationships can mind-link, correct?"

"Correct," they agreed.

"Then try."

Almost instantly, laughter erupted as they discovered their new connection. "This is incredible!"

"Now include your mates," Oberon instructed. "Isolde with Adrian, Seraphina with Victor, Evelyn with Sebastian."

Focusing intently, Seraphina's gaze locked onto me. Isolde succeeded first - our bond being strongest - but soon I felt Seraphina's presence brush my mind. I smiled encouragingly.

"Hello Victor," her voice echoed in my mind.

"Well done, Seraphina."

We were celebrating our success when Isolde's eyes glazed over. "Excuse me momentarily," she murmured, heading inside as we discussed the implications of our new abilities.

When Isolde returned, Oberon's head snapped up. She stepped aside to reveal Natalia standing there. Their eyes met.

"Mate!"

###Chapter 0434

I had suspected it all along. Natalia and Oberon were destined mates. Now we'd witness how fate would unfold its plan.

In a blur of movement, Oberon closed the distance between them, sweeping Natalia into his embrace.

"King Oberon, allow me to present Alpha Natalia. Natalia, this is King Oberon of the fae."

"King?" Alistair's gaze darted between his daughter and the fae holding her, then back to me.

"Oberon rules the fae kingdom," I clarified.

His voice trembled with wonder. "How can this be? I believed one only received a single mate in their existence."

Natalia stiffened in his arms. "You're already mated?"

Oberon shook his head. "Not anymore. Centuries ago, my mate was stolen from me." His golden eyes swept across our group.

Adrian stepped forward. "By our reckoning, you've lived multiple lifetimes. Werewolves sometimes receive second-chance mates. Rare, but possible. Perhaps the fae share this blessing."

"Shall I find you a private space?" I gestured toward the manor. "You'll want time to acquaint yourselves properly."

Oberon hesitated. "But your training—"

"Can wait until dawn," Victor interrupted. "Go speak with your mate. Everyone here understands."

The fae king turned to Alistair. "I swear upon my crown, no harm shall befall your daughter in my care."

Alistair gave a stiff nod before addressing Natalia. "I'll remain here if you require me."

I led them to a secluded parlor on the ground floor. When I returned, Alistair had joined the others.

"A fae king? Truly?"

Seraphina nodded. "He's been instructing us in Guardian abilities. His efforts have helped bridge the divide between our kinds."

Alistair's brow furrowed. "He mentioned a lost mate?"

"That story belongs to Oberon alone," Evelyn said gently. "But know this - the she-wolf perished long ago. No rival claims his heart now."

"The woodland sprites adore him," I added. As if summoned by my words, Puck and Titania materialized before us.

"Lady Luna Isolde! Sir Alpha Victor! Blessings upon this day!"

"We seek audience with King Oberon."

"Has he departed already?"

I shook my head. "He's presently occupied. Might we assist you instead?"

"Puck, behold!" Titania's wings fluttered excitedly. "A new Alpha graces our presence!"

"What a magnificent specimen!"

"Do you suppose all Alphas possess such stature?"

Their unabashed admiration drew a smirk from Alistair as they continued their appraisal.

"I can hear every word, you realize," Alistair remarked dryly.

Titania gasped, pressing delicate hands to her chest. "Did you hear that resonance, brother?"

"Undoubtedly an Alpha."

"So... substantial."

"His warmth must be extraordinary."

Titania drifted closer. "What do they call you, magnificent one?"

"Alpha Alistair. And what might your name be, enchanting creature?"

"Puck! He called me enchanting!" Her wings shimmered with delight.

The male sprite scoffed. "An Alpha with questionable taste, clearly."

"How dare you!" Titania whirled on her brother.

Alistair chuckled. "I find you utterly captivating."

The sprite trembled violently, eyes fluttering closed. "Your voice... it vibrates through my essence most deliciously."

"Delicious?" Alistair shot us a bewildered look.

I shrugged. "Consider it high praise. But heed this warning - no licking. That's how they bond."

"Lady Luna!" Titania huffed, wounded. "Perhaps I wished to be tasted! You've spoiled my chances! I'd make an exceptional mate."

###Chapter 0435

Titania turns to Alpha Alistair with a mischievous glint in her eyes. "You're more than welcome to lick me if you'd like."

Alpha Alistair chuckles, shaking his head. "Perhaps we should get acquainted first before either of us starts licking the other." His tone is light but firm.

"Oh, I'd adore that!" She practically vibrates with excitement. "Do you have time now? I could give you a tour of the woods."

He glances at us for approval. We exchange shrugs.

"Seems I'm free," he tells her, a playful smirk forming. "Lead the way. And..." He leans closer, voice dropping. "Would you like to meet my wolf?"

Her breath hitches. "Oh! Yes. Absolutely."

Alpha Alistair throws us an amused look. "They're quite enthusiastic, aren't they?"

"You have no idea," Victor mutters, rubbing his temples. "Just a fair warning—they take licking very seriously."

Alpha Alistair blinks. "Why would I—?"

Victor cuts him off with a shrug. "Their fascination with wolves rivals ours. If you shift, keep control."

Alpha Alistair turns back to Titania. "Alright, little sprite. Lead on. Or are you finally going to tell me your name?"

She giggles and whispers it before darting toward the trees.

"Oberon," I call as he watches them disappear. "King Oberon might be occupied until dinner. Try again then?"

He hesitates, gaze lingering on the forest edge. "Maybe I'll assist Titania with the tour while I wait." With that, he vanishes after them.

"We tried," Victor sighs.

With hours until dinner, Seraphina, Evelyn, and I head to Main Street to collect their clothing orders. They're delighted with the pieces and immediately place more for their pack.

On our return, something feels off. The flowers lining the packhouse entrance glow unnaturally vibrant. I dismiss it as the sprites' doing—until we step inside and find the entire pack gathered, staring into the backyard.

Summer stands among them, wide-eyed.

"Luna, look."

I follow her finger. The entire landscape behind our packhouse has transformed. Flowers bloom in impossible hues, petals shimmering like jewels. The trees radiate emerald brilliance, their trunks polished bronze.

"What is this?" I breathe.

"No one knows."

I scan for the sprites. "Are they responsible?"

"Not us, Luna," Luna and Stella say in unison.

"We lack this kind of power," Stella adds.

Evelyn nudges me. "Then who?"

Victor appears beside me, jaw tight. "What in the goddess's name—?"

"Your guess is as good as mine."

The phenomenon intensifies. Plants grow lusher, colors deepening. The garden overflows with ripe produce, vines heavy with fruit.

"Whatever this is," Seraphina murmurs, "I want it for my pack."

Finnian rounds the corner then, cradling Ivy. "Finnian! Do you know what's happening?"

He pauses, taking in the scene as if noticing it for the first time. A slow, knowing smile spreads across his face.

"Father," he announces, "is exceptionally pleased."

###Chapter 0436

It's obvious Oberon and Natalia have completed their mating bond. Nothing else could make a fae king radiate such joy that the very landscape transforms around him. I want to be annoyed, but how can I? If I'd had that power when I claimed Isolde, the entire continent would have shifted.

Alpha Alistair emerges from the woods looking thoroughly disheveled. His silver-streaked hair sticks out in wild directions, leaves tangled in the strands. His clothes are rumpled like he's been wrestling his wolf in the dirt. Given what I know about sylvan fae magic, I'm probably not wrong.

"Isolde gasps. "Alpha Alistair! Are you alright?"

"By the moon," he rasps, running a hand through his messy hair. He turns as Titania appears at the treeline, waving coyly. When he faces us again, his eyes are glazed. "I've been alone since my mate died birthing Natalia. Swore I'd never take another. But that fae..." He shudders. "I'm an Alpha. Centuries of control, obliterated in an afternoon."

My mate tactfully suggests, "Perhaps you'd like to clean up before dinner? We're serving in thirty minutes."

Sebastian isn't so diplomatic. "You look like you got mauled by a horny bear. Go shower before you scare the pups."

Alistair blinks, finally noticing his state. "Right. Luna Isolde, would you show me to my room?"

I bite my lip watching Isolde lead him away, her shoulders shaking with suppressed laughter.

"Does your pack always operate like a supernatural soap opera?" Adrian asks dryly.

"Without fail," I deadpan. The resulting laughter is infectious. Chaotic? Absolutely. But it's our chaos.



Oberon and Natalia remain conspicuously absent all evening. Alistair barely manages to ask about his daughter before Titania arrives seeking the fae king. When we explain he's... occupied, Isolde invites her to stay. Neither Alistair nor Titania reappear after dinner.

"Training's clearly canceled," Isolde muses. "We could practice alone tomorrow."

Adrian shrugs. "Let's see what morning brings. At minimum, I'll mind-link with Blackthorn to check in."

Morning confirms no training. Oberon paces impatiently, waiting for the vanished Alpha. The fresh mating mark on his neck glows faintly—no doubt Natalia bears a matching sigil.

When Alistair finally returns, he announces Titania's agreed to return to Obsidian Moon with him. The now-humanoid fae woman smirks as Alistair confesses, "My wolf may have... licked her."

"I did warn you," I remind him.

His sheepish grin says it all. "Worth it."

Oberon secures Alistair's blessing for Natalia to relocate to Eldermere. They'll return in two weeks to resume Guardian training. The farewells are bittersweet—Natalia hugging her father, Titania embracing Finnian and the other fae.

"I'm ready to retire," Alistair admits afterward. "If my Beta's son assumes leadership, we'd like to settle here. Titania wants to be near her kin."

"You'll always have a home with us," I promise. "Pick any spot—we'll build to your liking."

By Monday, routine mercifully returns. Between pack duties and renovating the compound, Isolde arranges a meeting with Reginald. After consulting Rosalind, she's drafted plans for his potential integration into our pack.

The night before our trip, Isolde enters my office cradling files. "Proof," she declares, perching on my lap, "that your mate is always right."

I chuckle, accepting the folder labeled 'Blackwood.' The family lineage inside makes my breath catch. Six generations of Alpha-descended warriors. Even my mother carried Alpha blood.

Isolde turns, cupping my face. "Told you you're more Alpha than Beta, my love."

###Chapter 0437

Victor was born to lead. Even before he became Alpha, his natural authority shone brighter than any I'd ever known—including my own father. Seeing him finally embrace his true role filled me with pride. He wasn't some imposter. He was the real deal. Always had been.

The following morning, we drove two hours north to meet Theodore. Victor insisted we spare the elderly man the shock of encountering our pack territory if he reacted badly to our revelation. He'd scouted a tiny roadside diner in the middle of nowhere—perfect for private conversations.

We claimed a corner booth first. Watching Victor sprawl in his seat, I was hit with déjà vu.

"Something amusing, little wolf?" His eyebrow arched.

"You're sitting exactly like you did when those red wolves were hunting us." My fingers traced the chipped Formica table. "Even back then, when I was still pushing you away, you protected me like a true mate."

Magnus surged forward in Victor's gaze, turning his eyes molten gold. "You've been ours since the first second we saw you. To love. To protect. That never changes." My heart stuttered at the raw devotion in his voice.

Aurora pressed against my skin as I cradled his jaw. "We love you too," we whispered in unison.

The door's jingle interrupted us. Theodore stood frozen in the entryway, eyes darting between us.

"Theodore!" I launched myself at him. His gnarled hands gripped my shoulders as he stepped back, scanning me head to toe.

"Lord have mercy, girl. You were grown when I last saw you, but now you look..." He shook his head. "Different."

"Life's been... eventful." I gestured to Victor, who'd moved to stand beside me. "You remember Victor."

"Course I do." Theodore's calloused hand swallowed Victor's. "Good to see you treating our girl right."

As we settled into the booth, Theodore kept studying us. "Now what's this big secret y'all are sweating bullets over?"

Victor leaned forward. "How do you feel about wildlife?"

Theodore snorted. "Boy, I was raised knee-deep in rattlesnakes and coyotes."

"We don't just live near wildlife." I laced my fingers together. "We are wildlife."

The old man stilled. His fork clinked against the plate as he set it down with deliberate calm. "Spit it out then."

Victor didn't blink. "We're wolf shifters. Our entire pack can transform at will."

Silence. Theodore's gaze flicked between us, searching for any sign this was a joke. Finding none, he methodically cut into his pancakes and took a slow bite.
###Chapter 0438

"I always suspected your mother didn't have cancer. Couldn't pinpoint what it was, but cancer patients don't have those kinds of episodes. Was she a shifter too?" Theodore asked, taking a bite of his meal.

A weight lifted from my chest. I hadn't realized how badly I needed Theo to believe me—to agree to join our pack. This man who'd protected my mother and me when we had nothing. Who'd watched over me after she was gone. More of a father to me than my own ever was.

"She was."

He nodded. "That where you got it from?" Casual, like we were discussing my hair color instead of my ability to turn into a wolf.

"From both parents."

"You ever track down that worthless father of yours?" He knew the basics—how my father had thrown us out.

"Yeah. Handled it." His fork froze midway to his mouth as he studied me.

"Permanently?"

I nodded.

"Good." He finished his breakfast in one decisive bite. "Never deserved either of you."

"So, Theo," Victor cut in. "You ready to live with a pack of wolves in the woods? Help a young girl launch her diner business?"

Theo shrugged. "Packed up everything I own. Nothing left for me back there. Only way is forward with you folks. If you'll have me, I'm in. But fair warning—I don't shift. What you see is what you get."

During the drive home, Theo and I caught up. I gave him the full story of my confrontation with my father. "Alpha wolf, huh? That's the big boss?"

"Something like that."

"Nice to know the top dog."

He adapted to pack life faster than I'd imagined. Moved into the packhouse without blinking at living among hundreds of wolf shifters. Once assured no one would accidentally maul him in wolf form, he settled right in.

Within weeks, he'd befriended nearly everyone. No one batted an eye at having a human in the pack. He sat down with Rosalind, discussing her diner plans and adding his own expertise. They designed layouts for large group seating while ensuring proper kitchen and checkout space. He took her under his wing, just like he'd done for me.

Sometimes he joins the hunting parties. I've heard him arguing he's the better hunter—no claws or fangs, just a rifle and his own sharp senses.

Even the sprites adore him. After Titania left with Alpha Alistair, Oberon had been lonely. Now he and Theo spend afternoons chatting under the trees or walking through the forest.

He's picked a building site for his future house. Once the diner's up, I doubt I'll see much of him—he'll be holding court there, keeping an eye on everything.

Only complaint? "You folks may not be nudists, but there's an awful lot of nakedness around here."

I laughed. "Clothes don't survive shifting. Too expensive to keep replacing them."

He's adapted well.

All things considered, the transition's been smoother than I ever expected.

And I couldn't be happier.

"I always suspected your mother didn't have cancer. Didn't know what was wrong, but cancer patients don't have those kinds of episodes. Was she a shifter too?" Theodore asked, shoving a forkful of eggs into his mouth.

A weight lifted from my chest. I hadn't realized how badly I needed Reginald to believe me—to agree to join our pack. This man who'd protected my mother and me when we had nothing. Who'd watched over me after she was gone. More of a father to me than Gregory Sinclair ever was.

"She was."

He nodded. "That where you got it from?" Casual, like asking about my hair color instead of my ability to turn into a wolf.

"From both parents."

"You ever track down that worthless father of yours?" He knew enough about Gregory throwing us out.

"Yeah. Handled it." His fork froze mid-air as he studied me.

"Permanently?"

I nodded.

"Good." He finished his breakfast in one decisive bite. "Never deserved either of you."

"So, Reginald," Victor cut in. "You want to live with a pack of wolves in the woods? Help a young girl start a diner business?"

Theodore shrugged. "Packed up my whole life knowing there's nothing left for me back there. Only path forward is with you folks. If you'll have me, I'm coming. But fair warning—I don't shift. What you see is what you get."

During the drive home, I filled him in on everything—the battle with Gregory, claiming my birthright. "Alpha wolf, huh? Means you're top dog now?"

"Something like that."

"Always good to know the boss."

To my shock, he adapted faster than I'd imagined. Moved into the packhouse without blinking at living among hundreds of shifters. Once assured no one would mistake him for prey, he settled right in.

Within weeks, he'd charmed nearly everyone. No one batted an eye at having a human in the pack. He met with Rosalind, brainstorming diner layouts—spacious enough for large groups while accommodating kitchen, prep station, and checkout. Took her under his wing just like he'd done for me.

Sometimes he joins hunting parties just to argue he's the superior hunter. "You've got claws and fangs. I've got decades of experience and a damn good rifle."

Even befriended the fae. After Titania left with Alpha Alistair, Oberon had been lonely. Now I often find them beneath the oaks at dusk, talking or walking through the woods.

He's already picked a house site. Once the diner's built, I know where he'll be—holding court at a corner booth, keeping watch over everything.

Only complaint? "Not a nudist colony, but sure see a lot of bare asses around here."

I laughed. "Shifting destroys clothes. Too expensive to keep replacing them."

He's adjusted.

All things considered? Smoother transition than I ever expected.

And I couldn't be happier.

###Chapter 0439

Three months had passed since Theodore joined our pack. The progress was undeniable. Nearly all our members now had finished homes or ones nearing completion. The main marketplace stood fully operational, with construction already underway for additional shops in the outer territories - a convenience for those who preferred living farther from the packhouse.

Isolde and I instituted monthly gatherings. These meetings served multiple purposes: updating the pack, making announcements, and welcoming newcomers - whether young wolves coming of age or refugees seeking sanctuary.

Oberon arrived every fortnight for training sessions. He always brought Natalia to visit her father. After Alpha Alistair returned with Titania, he confronted his Beta. The subsequent Alpha challenge ended predictably with the Beta's son victorious. Alistair spent a month ensuring a smooth transition before officially relocating to our lands with Titania. Their new home stood near the woods, in the same community where Alistair and Tobias had built. This strategic placement kept the sprites close to loved ones while positioning warriors along our borders.

Hunter activity had resurged. Our sylvan allies spotted multiple intruders in the forest. We either drove them off or eliminated the threats. Alpha Alistair and his elder reconnaissance team located only one compound so far. Though I wasn't present for the raid, reports described horrific conditions - supernatural beings subjected to torture and experimentation, reminiscent of Lillian's ordeal. We knew more facilities existed, but their locations remained elusive. Whispers of impending danger circulated again, prompting increased patrols. Fortunately, our territory now bordered both Sebastian and Adrian's packs, creating a stronger defensive network.

Isolde's abilities grew exponentially. Her power absorption range now extended beyond Evelyn to Adrian. Somehow, establishing their mind link enabled this connection. Oberon experimented with having her draw power directly from Adrian versus through Evelyn. During our last session, Isolde accessed not just Evelyn and Adrian's strength, but briefly tapped into Adrian's pack members. Sebastian still prohibited Seraphina's participation - a decision I supported. Each training left Isolde utterly drained. After discovering she could channel Adrian's power through the mind link, Oberon insisted Sebastian observe. Now Isolde could simultaneously draw from Evelyn, Adrian, Sebastian, and myself. Her already formidable strength amplified exponentially when combining our powers.

Late at night in my study, preparing for another weekend training at Adrian and Evelyn's territory, my phone rang. The conference call connected me with Adrian and Sebastian simultaneously.

"Victor, Adrian. We've got trouble." Sebastian's voice carried urgency. "Just returned from my city office. A panther shifter I met last year showed up - in terrible condition. She'd been imprisoned in a hunter compound for six months. Overheard them discussing the Guardians. Escaped to warn us. They're coming for our mates."

Adrian and I both growled at the revelation, needing moments to compose ourselves. "You think this is the major threat we've been anticipating?"

"Almost certainly. Isolde overheard them referencing the tournament incident. The hunters who escaped that day clearly reported back. They've been experimenting on wolves too - likely rogues, explaining why no packs reported missing members."

"I'll send my father to debrief her, if permitted. He'll want to locate that compound." Adrian proposed.

"Bring him over. She's secured here at the pack - unhappy but safe." Sebastian confirmed.

"What did she learn about their wolf experiments?" I demanded.

###Chapter 0440

"No. I doubt she could tell us anything even if she knew. She's severely traumatized." Sebastian's voice is heavy with concern.

"Let my father talk to her. He's been handling interviews with the rescued supernaturals from that compound. He knows how to approach this carefully."

"Good idea. If he wants to come tonight, I'll arrange it, but I'd prefer he waits until tomorrow. She needs rest and food first." Sebastian exhales sharply. "How do you both feel about relocating our training session to my pack this weekend? I want to keep Seraphina close, but there's a chance Isolde might open up to our mates. She knows they're the hunters' real targets."

"I'm fine with that," I say, and Adrian nods in agreement.

"You realize we have to tell them," I add, glancing between them.

I hear their simultaneous sighs. "Yeah, we know," they mutter.

"They're Guardians. Strong, but they need to be prepared. They deserve a warning." My fingers tighten around my phone. "And Isolde, at least, will demand to know why I'm tripling patrols."

"Evelyn won't let it go either," Adrian admits. "She'll hound me until I explain. And honestly, I'll feel better knowing she's extra cautious when she's out with Ivy."

"Agreed. So, we tell them tonight since we'll all be together tomorrow?" Sebastian asks.

We murmur our assent before ending the call.

I follow my mate's scent to our room, finding her in the shower. Leaning against the doorframe, I watch the steam curl around her silhouette.

"Why are you staring like some creepy stalker?" She peeks out, water dripping from her hair.

"Just admiring the view."

She smirks, crooking a finger. "Join me."

I strip quickly, stepping into the spray behind her. My arms encircle her waist as she turns, mischief glinting in her eyes. Her fingers trail down my chest, lower—

"Do you have any idea how much I love you?" The words burn in my throat. No one will take her from me. I'd die before letting those hunters touch her.

I'll rip apart anyone who even thinks of harming her, Magnus growls in my mind.

Isolde's hands still. Her arms slide around me instead, pressing close. "What's wrong?"

The lump in my throat nearly chokes me. I kiss her nose, struggling to speak. "We confirmed it. The hunters are targeting Guardians. They're coming for you."

Her grip tightens. "Let them try. My sisters and I are ready. We'll show them what happens when they mess with us."

"If they're planning this, they think they can win. Sebastian said they've been experimenting on wolves—probably rogues—but they might have found a way to hurt you that we don't know about."

Her palms cradle my face. "I'm not going anywhere. No one's taking me or Aurora from you and Magnus. You promised me forever, Victor Blackwood. And I'm holding you to that."

I press my forehead to hers, eyes shut, wrestling with the fear clawing up my chest.

"Victor..." Her voice is soft, sensing my turmoil.

"Promise me." My voice cracks. "Promise you'll be careful. No unnecessary risks. I need to hear it, Isolde. I can't function if I'm constantly terrified something's happened to you."

"I promise you, Victor, I'll be okay."

I carry her to bed, making love with agonizing slowness. Every touch, every gasp, every shudder—I commit them to memory. She needs to know she's my everything. When release finally shatters me, I cling to her like she's the only thing keeping me grounded.

The Alpha's Forgotten Heir by S. Blackwood

###Chapter 0441

Victor became obsessive about tracking my every movement after the incident. When we're together, his touches linger longer, his kisses grow deeper. We've always had passion, but now there's a frantic edge to it—like he's trying to brand his love into my skin before time runs out. The fear of losing me clings to him like shadows at dusk.

I know why.

I'm the linchpin. The living conduit that binds the Guardians' power. Seraphina and Isolde can draw from me, but without my mental tether, their reach ends there. What I haven't confessed is the terrifying scope of my connection—I don't just link to my sisters and their mates. Every wolf across all three packs flickers to life in my mind like constellations igniting.

One thousand five hundred voices.

One thousand five hundred heartbeats.

The weight of it leaves me hollowed out after training sessions.

Without me, they're formidable. With me? We're unstoppable. That's why Victor's paranoia about the hunters chafes. I know we'll annihilate them. The certainty doesn't stop my rage—these humans think they can steal our futures because our existence frightens them? Because we're stronger? Faster? Better?

The timing couldn't be crueler. Our pack is blooming with new life. Lillian and Leopold will welcome their son within weeks, likely conceived during Luna's Challenge like Seraphina's daughter. Theodora gleefully informed me she and Donovan are expecting too, joining the growing list—Elara and Theodore just announced, followed by Luna and Stella days later.

Our compound has become a nursery overnight. Rosalind's kitchen staff preps jars of pureed vegetables. Nathaniel's workshop overflows with bassinets. Isabella's sewing circle churns out tiny garments for three packs worth of impending arrivals.

Victor senses my grief. He wants this as desperately as I do. But biology is a merciless judge—while every female around me swells with life, my womb stays stubbornly empty. Theodora claims stress and Guardian training are likely culprits, urges patience.

Patience is ash in my mouth when Donovan casually mentions his mate's morning sickness.

Victor swears my worth isn't tied to motherhood. I believe him. Mostly.

Yet when darkness falls, so do my defenses. What if my strength, my title, my very soul aren't enough? What if one day he looks at me and sees only a broken thing?

So I smile at swollen bellies. I cuddle newborns and breathe in their milky sweetness until my ribs ache. I play my part flawlessly.

And when the moon rises, I lie awake counting the beats between Victor's breaths, terrified he'll stop wanting to share them.

###Chapter 0442

The hunters are closing in.

Victor confessed that Sebastian is terrified they'll strike while Seraphina's pregnant. She carried their child during the vampire war, and he spent weeks wondering if she'd survive. Now, with their baby due any day, his fear for both his mate and daughter consumes him.

Then the miracle happens.

Sebastian's mind link comes through at dawn—mother and baby are perfect. Little Leana Estella enters the world screaming and healthy. I announce the birth to Sanctuary, only for Lillian to go into labor that same night. By morning, our Beta couple welcomes Dillon Ricardo, their son named for the hope he represents.

The sprites fascinate me.

Unlike human women, they adapt seamlessly to carrying wolf-shifter babies. Oberon was right—our species are compatible. The hybrid pregnancies progress without complications, despite the accelerated wolf gestation.

Three days later, news breaks that Titania and Alistair are expecting.

I'm heading to my quarters when nausea slams into me like a freight train. I barely reach the bathroom before losing my lunch. Gasping against the tiles, I wonder what poisoned me.

"Sweetheart?" Victor's concern floods our bond. "You okay?"

"Bad tacos, maybe. You feel fine?"

"Perfect. Want me to come home?"

"I'm good." Lie.

"Rest today. You've been pushing too hard." His tone turns playful. "We can practice baby-making hourly if you want."

My laugh sounds watery. "Titania's pregnant too."

"Damn, it's contagious."

"Sanctuary's drowning in baby fever." I try masking my grief. He catches it anyway.

"It'll happen, love." His voice softens. "I'll personally ensure it does. Repeatedly."

That earns a real smile.

"I adore you, Victor."

"You're my entire world, Isolde. Never forget that."

The sickness persists.

I hide it well as hunter activity escalates. We're fortifying bunkers, running evacuation drills. Every pregnant female, elder, and child must know their designated safe room.

Lillian and Seraphina will oversee two shelters, tracking arrivals and supply needs. We've placed late-term mothers with Seraphina—her medical skills are vital if deliveries begin during battle. Elara, Luna, and Stella volunteered as shelter leaders too. True to their nature, their rooms now bloom with enchanted flowers.

After one drill, I barely make it to the packhouse restroom before vomiting.

Seraphina catches me wiping my mouth.

"Hospital. Now."

"Stress," I croak.

"Don't bullshit your physician." She crosses her arms. "I've watched you puke for three days straight. Either walk with me, or I'm telling Victor."

My glare could melt steel. "He's overwhelmed."

"Exactly. So move."

At the clinic, she draws blood, takes urine samples, hooks me to monitors.

When she returns, her grin could power cities.

"Radiant health, Luna."

"So it's stress?"

Her eyes lock onto mine. "You're pregnant."

The world tilts.

My hands fly to my stomach. Joy detonates in my chest—for exactly two seconds. Then reality crashes down. The hunters are coming. Now.

"Don't tell Victor." I grasp her wrist. "I want to surprise him properly."

The unspoken truth hangs between us—if he knows, he'll bench me from the fight. And our pack needs their Luna.

I won't risk my mate.

I won't fail my people.

Three days later, the hunters attack.

###Chapter 0443

They're coming.

The hunters make no effort to conceal their approach. Each passing day tightens the knot of dread in my chest. The thought of losing Isolde terrifies me. She believes she's our key to victory, but I can't—I won't—let her fall.

When the mind link crackles to life with news of the hunters' proximity, we're already moving. Weeks of preparation have led to this moment. I'd never admit it to Isolde, but I'm relieved she isn't pregnant yet. The weight of protecting my pack and mate is crushing enough—adding an unborn child to that burden would shatter my focus. My fear for her has turned me into a hovering shadow, demanding constant updates on her whereabouts. It annoys her, but I can't help it.

The hunters have split their forces near our three borders, forcing us into an hour-long sprint to intercept them. Our patrols caught their scent thanks to the Sylvan Fae's warning. We maintain radio silence, letting the hunters believe they've caught us unaware. This deception buys time for our warriors to assemble while keeping our scouts safe.

"Isolde, I'm moving out with the warriors. Initiate evacuation protocols, then join us. Stay safe. I love you." I send the message through the mind link before shifting and rallying our fighters.

"Right behind you," she responds.

By the time my pack arrives, Adrian's warriors are already in position, and Sebastian's forces flank us moments later. Seraphina and Evelyn shift back, their eyes scanning the treeline. "Where's Isolde?" they demand through the link.

"On her way," I reply, though unease prickles at me. Aurora is swift—she should have caught up by now.

A thunderous rustling erupts from the forest. Five heads snap toward the sound. I inhale sharply, attempting to gauge numbers the way Isolde does. She's better at it, but even I can't miss the overwhelming stench of thousands.

"Isolde?"

Her voice floods the shared link, breathless. "Almost there. Five thousand and two hunters. We're outnumbered five to one."

She's right. Between recent pup booms and injured warriors, we barely field a thousand fighters. Five-to-one odds are brutal. Seasoned warriors might manage, but the younger ones won't last. Unless we thin their ranks fast, this battle turns dire.

"We can't engage head-on," Sebastian growls. "Flank them."

"My pack holds the center," Adrian decides. "You two take the sides. Hit them hard before they regroup."

"We'll wait for Isolde," Evelyn and Seraphina insist.

"Our front line needs the most protection anyway," Evelyn adds.

Orders ripple through the ranks. My pack ghosts left, closing the noose around the hunters. Hearing "five thousand" is one thing; seeing that sea of enemies is another. For a heartbeat, the scale of it staggers me. Then fury burns the fear away. These monsters came to slaughter my pack. To murder my mate. For that, they'll die.

We complete the encirclement, linking with Sebastian's forces on the opposite side. The trap is set.

Theron's howl splits the air—our signal to strike.

Hundreds fall before the hunters comprehend their predicament. Then chaos erupts as they shift, fangs bared, turning on us with vicious precision.

###Chapter 0444

Gunfire erupts around us.

I realize instantly what they've discovered from experimenting on rogues.

They've developed a way to kill us—not just weaken us.

A wolf beside me takes a bullet to the shoulder.

The silver liquefies on impact, seeping into his bloodstream.

He collapses from the initial wound, but I watch in horror as the poison spreads.

The moment it reaches his heart, his life extinguishes through our Alpha bond.

Magnus roars in fury.

We turn back to the fight with renewed rage.

Outnumbered. Outgunned. Every bullet is fatal.

The Guardians and their mates resist silver better, but it won't save us today.

We're all going to die here.

But I'll take down as many hunters as I can first.

The battlefield is carnage.

Hunters lie dead or dying everywhere.

Magnus shreds through them effortlessly, his claws slick with blood.

We've torn limbs from bodies, throats from necks.

His black fur glistens crimson under the moonlight.

Wolves howl in agony as bullets find them.

I feel my pack members dying one by one through our bonds.

Each loss weakens me further.

Magnus stumbles when a bullet strikes his hind leg.

Burning silver spreads through our shared body, forcing us to limp.

Three legs now. It'll take time for the poison to reach our heart.

Time to kill more hunters.

Then I spot Isolde.

She and her sisters are decimating hunters with their powers.

But for every one they eliminate, three more appear.

We're hopelessly outnumbered.

Magnus and I fight our way toward her.

The instinct to protect our mate overrides everything.

No one will touch her while we still draw breath.

The silver creeps closer to our heart with every beat.

Time is running out.

Another hunter falls beneath us.

Then a bullet punches through our lung.

Silver floods our chest. Breathing becomes agony.

Magnus coughs blood but leaps at another attacker.

Our numbers dwindle by the second.

Alistair's bond snaps first. Then Alexander's.

Donovan fell earlier, taking the first wave.

Leopold survives only because he's human now, but I feel him fading too.

My connection to Isolde weakens.

The mates' collective grief from the bunker nearly crushes me.

Across the battlefield, Isolde's eyes meet mine.

She knows.

Horror contorts her beautiful face.

Beside her, Elara kneels over someone—Adrian.

Dead in her arms.

Her grief shields the Guardians from harm.

At least my mate is safe.

Even if I can't protect her anymore.

A final bullet strikes true.

Liquid silver floods my heart.

With my last breath, I send one final thought: "I love you, Isolde."

Darkness swallows me.

The last thing I see is Isolde's scream.

###Chapter 0445

Relief floods through me when Victor announces he's heading to battle, instructing me to join after organizing evacuations. Pregnancy prevents me from shifting. I'll have to sprint there in human form. If Victor saw me now, he'd know something was off.

The battlefield feels miles away without Aurora's speed. Four legs always outpace two. The scent of blood and gunpowder hits me before the fighting comes into view. I'm mentally counting enemies when Victor's voice cuts through my thoughts. Opening the mind link, I update them on my position and the staggering number of hunters.

Their strategy shifts—spreading out means I won't fight beside Victor. My place is with my sisters. Only together can we turn this tide.

Kai's battle howl shatters the air before I arrive. Chaos erupts instantly. Pack bonds snap one after another like severed threads.

"Aurora, hurry. We're losing them."

Her grief mirrors mine, sharpened by Noah's death among the first. Sirona's anguish radiates through the pack link—her mate gone in an instant.

The scene confirms Victor's fears. It's not the numbers. Silver glints in fallen wolves, seeping from bullet wounds like poison. We're being slaughtered.

I crash into the fray, breaking my sisters' connection to grip their hands. As the conduit, I channel their strength—Seraphina and Valeria have been shielding Adrian's pack alone, exposed at the frontlines.

Our combined aura explodes outward, obliterating hunters by the hundreds. Yet they keep coming. Bullets outpace our kills. Every lost wolf reverberates through us.

Seraphina's aura feels foreign, her blue energy tangled with golden healing threads. Remembering Oberon's lessons, I seize both. The healing might be useless now, but I cling to it like a lifeline.

Purple energy swirls—the same force that won the Luna's Challenge. This time, it decimates even more hunters. But as we focus, Seraphina's protection over Valeria's pack wavers. Their bonds fracture. Tears streak Seraphina's face for each life lost.

No time for mourning. Our mates. Our packs. My child. All depend on this.

Another surge of power. Hundreds more hunters fall. Yet their numbers seem endless. We've killed thousands, but half our warriors litter the ground—dead or dying, their whimpers shredding my focus.

I'm drawing power again when the shot rings out. A hunter takes aim at Valeria. Theron lunges, intercepting the silver bullet meant for her heart.

###Chapter 0446

"NO!" Evelyn's scream tore through the battlefield as Theron shifted back to Adrian. I watched in horror as silver tendrils crept toward his heart. His hands cradled her face, whispering words lost in the chaos before his tether snapped.

Seraphina's raw grief erupted like a shockwave, her powerful aura shielding Valeria and me from the hunters while she clutched Adrian's lifeless body, pleading for his return.

My next defensive pulse faltered without Seraphina's strength. Then I spotted Victor across the bloodied field. Our eyes locked - his body riddled with wounds. The moment our bond flickered, icy terror seized me.

This wasn't supposed to happen! I was the Guardian, the one meant to save them all. But the hunters kept coming, their numbers overwhelming us. Each fallen pack member weakened our collective strength.

The gunshot echoed before I saw it - a bullet piercing Victor's chest. My heart stopped when Magnus's fading voice whispered his love through our bond. Victor collapsed, shifting back to human form as the life left his eyes.

Beside me, Valeria suddenly gasped, clutching her chest. "SEBASTIAN!" Her anguished cry shattered what remained of my composure.

The battlefield told the grim truth. We were losing. Our packs decimated. Our mates slaughtered. Numbness crept through me as the carnage unfolded in nightmarish slow motion.

My hand instinctively covered my stomach. My unborn child - the life I'd fought so hard to protect - would never draw breath. White-hot rage erupted through my grief.

These hunters wouldn't win. They wouldn't take everything from us.

Closing my eyes, I reached for Seraphina and Valeria's auras. Beyond them, I sensed every pack member like candles in my mind. Drawing their power would weaken them further, but I had no choice.

Separating Valeria's healing energy, I fused it with our collective strength. "Aurora," I whispered to my wolf spirit.

"I know," she responded. "Protect our pup. I'll handle the rest."

With a shuddering breath, I pulled from every living member of all three packs - their strength, their pain, their fury. The energy coalesced into two massive orbs - one for destruction, one for salvation.

As I released the power, Aurora curled protectively around our child. The energy tore through me like a supernova, shredding my body from within.

The violet death wave obliterated hunters where they stood, their bodies bursting like overripe fruit. It rolled across the battlefield in an unstoppable tide of vengeance.

The golden-purple healing light sought every wolf - even those whose candles had dimmed. It purged silver from their veins, knitting torn flesh and reigniting extinguished sparks of life.

On my knees, I pushed every ounce of remaining strength into the healing light. Only when I heard Seraphina's gasp, Valeria's relieved cry to Sebastian, and felt Victor's tether snap back into place did I know it was working.

One by one, the candles flared back to life.

Through our renewed bond, I sent Victor my final message: 'I love you too.' Then darkness claimed me.

###Chapter 0447

My lungs burn as I suck in a desperate breath.

Alive. How?

"Magnus?"

Silence. My limbs feel like lead. The last thing I remember—the battlefield. Victor's silver eyes. The bullet tearing through my chest.

Am I dead? The eerie quiet suggests so. No clashing steel. No screams. Just ragged breathing and muffled groans.

"I love you too, Victor." Isolde's voice flickers in my mind, weak as a dying ember.

"Isolde!" I scream internally, but her presence slips away like smoke through my fingers.

I force myself up. "Isolde!" My voice cracks.

There. Collapsed on the bloodied earth. Seraphina and Evelyn hover over her, shaking her shoulders. "Isolde!" Their cries slice through the haze.

I crawl. Every inch is agony.

"What happened?" I rasp. Nearby, Adrian stirs, his face ashen.

"We were losing. Everyone was—" Seraphina chokes. "You, Adrian, Sebastian... gone."

I drag Isolde into my arms. Her pulse flutters—barely there.

Sebastian staggers over, crushing Seraphina against him. "Explain," he demands, staring at Isolde's limp form.

Evelyn exhales. "She channeled our power. Mine to kill the hunters. Seraphina's healing to revive the packs." She touches her chest. "I feel them all now. Every broken tether... mended."

Theodore limps closer, blood crusted on his temple. "Not just you. She drained everyone. We couldn't move after. If the hunters had survived..."

"Everyone?" Adrian's shock mirrors mine.

"You knew she could do this?" He glares at the Guardians.

Seraphina shakes her head. "We felt the connection. Not this."

"Home. Now." I bark orders to Leopold. "Get our people back. Help the wounded."

Carrying Isolde slows me. Weakness claws at me. Magnus's absence is a gaping wound.

Tires screech. Seraphina Whitmore's car skids to a halt. "How?" Her hands tremble as she helps me load Isolde inside. "I felt Donovan die."

The car lurches forward. I cradle Isolde, bracing her against the jolts.

"We don't know," I admit. "She's alive, but fading. Save her." My throat tightens. I was ready to die. Living without her? Unthinkable.

Seraphina's gaze flicks to the rearview mirror. "The baby first. Aurora's protecting it—not healing Isolde."

The world tilts. "Baby?"

Her eyes widen. "She didn't tell you?" At my silence, she pales. "She wanted it to be... special."

Of course. I'd have locked her away if I'd known. But without her, we'd all be corpses.

Seraphina shudders—thinking of Donovan, no doubt. Too many understand that pain today.

As we reach the hospital, she asks, "The hunters?"

I step out, Isolde and our child pressed to my chest. "Slaughtered. Grace's work. No survivors."

The aftermath will be hell. Burning bodies. Hiding the carnage from humans.

But none of that matters now.

Only her.

###Chapter 0448

Victor and Sebastian will handle the aftermath. Because of my mate, their mates are unharmed. My sole purpose now is to bring my mate back to full strength.

One month later

“Any changes?” I ask as Seraphina reenters the hospital room. A full month has passed, and Isolde remains unconscious.

She shakes her head. “Physically, there’s nothing wrong with her that I can detect. Has your bond strengthened at all?”

“Barely. And now I can’t tell if it’s my connection to her or to our child.” Seraphina offered to reveal the baby’s gender, but I refused to know without Isolde. Deep down, I already suspect the answer. Isolde’s scent is cherry blossoms, but her stomach carries a distinctly masculine aroma—sandalwood, the same scent she once said I had.

Machines surround Isolde, wires snaking across her body. Intravenous feeding keeps our baby nourished, while fluids prevent dehydration. Monitors track both their heartbeats, and an oxygen tube assists her shallow breathing.

Every day, I stay as close as possible. I’d crawl into bed with her if not for the tangle of wires. Instead, I sit beside her, resting my head against her stomach, whispering to our child. When I need to move, I shift to her side, pressing my forehead to hers, pleading with her to wake up.

At first, Seraphina urged me to leave—to eat, to sleep at the packhouse. But I can’t. I shower here. Leopold or Donovan brings meals and updates on pack affairs.

The hunters’ bodies were burned. Authorities came sniffing around, demanding to search our lands. We lied smoothly—no way could that many humans have trespassed without our notice. Their trail ended at our borders, and without a warrant, Sebastian and Adrian denied them entry. Revealing the truth would have meant arrests, or worse.

Magnus returned to me days after the battle. Those poisoned by silver took up to a week to recover. When he came back, I sent him searching for Aurora. She was there, but unresponsive.

Theodore, Evelyn, and Seraphina visit nearly every day. Evelyn and Seraphina carry guilt—Isolde saved them, yet she’s the one suffering. Seraphina is even pregnant again. I use their visits to shower or collapse onto the cot I had brought in, listening to their voices fill the room.

Our pack’s baby boom hasn’t slowed. Elara, Luna, and Stella all gave birth while Isolde slept. Seraphina’s due any day now, but thankfully, her trained assistants can handle the delivery and Isolde’s care.

Tonight, it’s just us. I can’t take it anymore. Carefully, I shift the wires and slide into bed beside her, my arm draped over her, my palm resting on her stomach where our little one stirs.

“Isolde, please,” I beg, voice breaking. “It’s been too long. I’m losing my mind without you. You promised me you’d be okay. This isn’t okay. I’m not okay. Our baby needs you. I need you. Wake up. Let me hear your voice. Let me yell at you for your recklessness, then tell you how incredible you are for saving everyone. You’re the only good thing in my life. Everything I endured before you was worth it, just to have you. Don’t make me raise our son alone. He needs his mother.”

Tears streak my face as I press my forehead to her temple.

Then—

“How do you know it’s a boy?”

My head snaps up. Exhausted but awake, Isolde’s eyes meet mine.

“Isolde!” Her hand lifts to my face. I kiss her palm, then her cheeks, her forehead, anywhere I can reach.

“Oh, Isolde,” I choke out before crumbling, sobbing against her as my mate finally returns.

###Chapter 0449

Chaos. Pure, unfiltered chaos.

Voices crash against my skull like waves in a storm. A thousand whispers, shouts, murmurs - all blending into one unbearable cacophony. I try to scream for silence, but my voice disappears beneath the tidal wave of noise.

I reach for Aurora in my mind, but she's drowned out. If she's calling for me, I can't hear her over this madness. My knees hit the ground as I claw at my temples, desperate for relief that never comes.

At first, I thought I'd lose my mind. Then slowly, the noise became background static - loud but manageable. Memories flood back. The battle. Drawing power from nearly a thousand wolves. Channeling their strength through my aura to obliterate the hunters.

That's when I understand.

I connected to every member of three packs during that desperate moment. Now I'm trapped in this web of consciousness with no idea how to free myself.

With Aurora watching over our child, I'm alone in this mental labyrinth. If my plan worked, I'll need to untangle over 1500 voices before I can escape this nightmare.

My first attempts fail spectacularly. The sheer volume overwhelms me, forcing retreat. Then - a breakthrough. A single thread glows amidst the chaos. I see its path clearly now, weaving through the others. I pull gently, separating it from the tangle.

Victor. His voice comes through clear as crystal. I keep it close, using it as my anchor in the storm.

Seraphina, Valeria, Dorian and Reginald follow. Maybe our bond makes them easier to find. Or perhaps they're physically closer, their voices carrying better through the void.

Once I crack the code, I work methodically. My pack first. Lillian, Donovan, Leopold - I find each thread and carefully extract it from the mess. The work exhausts me, but when I can't continue, I curl around Victor's voice like a lifeline.

I hear him speaking to our child. To me. Begging me to return. "Soon, my love," I whisper back into the void. "I'm coming home."

Time means nothing here. No days. No nights. Just an endless tapestry of voices waiting to be sorted. After my pack, I move to familiar voices from the other packs - Sebastian, Adrian, their ranked members. Each unraveled thread brings me closer to freedom.

Victor's voice grows increasingly desperate. How long have I been gone? His pain mirrors what I'd feel in his place. I work faster, fueled by his anguish.



The end approaches. With practice comes speed - I'm plucking threads from the chaos like a skilled weaver. The noise diminishes, allowing Victor's voice to shine brighter.

When his light burns at its fiercest, I'm down to the final cluster. His broken sobs drive me forward. Our son needs me. My mate needs me. With one final pull, the last knot comes undone.

Silence. Blessed silence.

My eyes fly open. "How do you know it's a boy?" slips out before I can stop it.

Victor's face tells the real story. Deep lines of stress. Bloodshot eyes. He looks like he's aged a decade. How long was I out?

My hand reaches for him, but he collapses against me, his body shaking with sobs. As I hold him, I take stock. Pack hospital. Unpleasant body odor. And...a noticeable bump where our child grows.

Wait. I was barely pregnant when we fought the hunters. That bump means weeks have passed. Maybe months.

When Victor finally regains control, he wipes his face and presses trembling lips to mine. The familiar sparks dance across my skin, reassuring me. Despite everything, our bond remains unbroken.

###Chapter 0450

I break the embrace, searching Victor's weary gaze. "How long was I unconscious, my love?"

His calloused palm cradles my cheek, thumb tracing the curve of my face. "Thirty-two days, my heart."

A gasp escapes me. Thirty-two days! No wonder my mate looks like he hasn't slept in weeks.

"Victor, forgive me." My fingers clutch his shirt. "I'm here now. I won't leave you again."

The distance between us feels unbearable. I need to feel his heartbeat against mine, to confirm we're both alive. But these damned IV lines and monitor wires keep us apart.

With a frustrated growl, I yank the nasal cannula free. My fingers find the IV in my arm just as Victor catches my wrist.

"Easy, darling." His voice carries both warning and tenderness. "These tubes are keeping our son nourished."

"Then get rid of the rest," I demand, already reaching for another wire. "I need to be close to you."

Victor moves with practiced efficiency, disconnecting unnecessary monitors while preserving those tracking our baby's vitals. Our son?

"How are you certain it's a boy?" I ask as he settles beside me. The moment our bodies touch, warmth floods my veins - that familiar blend of safety and belonging only my mate can provide.

"I scent him." Victor nuzzles my hair. "I refused to let Seraphina reveal the gender. Wanted us to discover together. But Leopold and Donovan swore they could tell by scent alone, and now I understand. He carries my sandalwood musk, not your floral notes."

Joy blossoms in my chest. A little warrior to carry his father's legacy!

Seraphina insisted on keeping me hospitalized another week. Our son thrived, she confirmed, though I already knew. Maia's spirit had whispered reassurances, her celestial presence guarding our child.

The confinement should have maddened me, but our chambers became a revolving door of well-wishers. Seraphina herself delivered during my stay - a radiant girl with her mother's golden eyes. Then came Elara with her twins (both boys born simultaneously, that peculiar fae magic at work), followed by Luna and Stella presenting their newborns.

Theodora and Leopold brought their daughter, while Titania shared news of her impending son. Even Seraphina visited, glowing with another pregnancy. Vivian and I teased her mercilessly, though I spotted the longing in Vivian's eyes - Donovan remains resistant to expanding their family.

I drank in every birth story, every description of that first miraculous embrace. No bitterness tainted my joy now - only anticipation. Our time would come.

Vivian brought Julian during visiting hours. She's grown stronger, finally agreeing to attend the mate gatherings. More second-chance matings occur each moon cycle, though Reginald still refuses to participate, claiming he's "too long in the tooth for such nonsense."

Homecoming brought relief. After two nights of uninterrupted sleep in our den, routines resumed. With packhouse renovations nearly complete, Victor, Leopold, and Donovan returned to their brutal training regimens. We established school transports for the pups, while Rosalind stepped down as Lead Omega to manage her diner with Reginald's help. Beatrice assumed morning duties, hiring a promising young omega for evenings.

We converted the adjacent chamber into a nursery. Nathaniel crafted each piece - bassinet, crib, changing table - with exquisite care. Victor spent nights carving wolf motifs into the wood, then painted celestial patterns across the ceiling. I added silver constellations, our child's future night sky.

Isabella became my personal seamstress as my belly expanded alarmingly. That final month, our boy grew like spring wheat, requiring new garments weekly.

We'd chosen his name months ago - Sebastian Grey, honoring Victor's fallen father. And when the winter moon hung highest, four months after my awakening, we welcomed our son into the world.

Sebastian Grey Blackwood - heir to the Obsidian Moon legacy.

###Chapter 0451

One year had passed.

Life had transformed in ways I never imagined possible. After the hunter war, after resolving the missing humans crisis, and after my mate finally awoke from his injuries, everything started falling into place.

The birth of our son, Sebastian, had been the most breathtaking moment of my existence.

Until today.

Today, I held our newborn daughter for the first time.

Isla Seraphina.

She was exquisite—flawless, just like her mother. And though I loved my son beyond measure, there was something different about cradling my little girl. A primal protectiveness surged through me, fiercer than anything I'd ever felt. It wasn't that I didn't feel it for Sebastian, but this... this was sharper, more consuming.

The bond between a father and his daughter was sacred. And I swore then—no one would ever harm her.

I carefully placed her in my mate’s arms, watching as the two most precious women in my life curled together, drifting into peaceful sleep. Pressing a kiss to each of their foreheads, I left them to rest.

Back at the packhouse, I collected Sebastian from Leopold and Lillian. Our pack was experiencing a baby boom—Leopold and Lillian were expecting their third child any day now. Seraphina and Donovan had welcomed their children back-to-back—a girl, then a boy. Angel and Sebastian had two boys in the past year, and Evelyn had finally convinced Adrian to expand their family again—this time, a son.

The sprites were just as bad. At this rate, we’d have an entire generation of hybrids soon, especially with more sprites bonding with our wolves.

"How’s our Luna?" Lillian asked, rubbing her swollen belly in the same absent gesture Isolde often did.

"Exhausted. Isla took her time, but they’re both resting now. Come by later to meet her."

"We will," Leopold promised, wrapping his arms around Lillian and massaging the spot she’d been touching. I’d learned that trick from Isolde—our babies always calmed when they felt their father’s touch. Leopold had picked up on it too.

I carried Sebastian to my office, settling him into his push-walker. He could walk unaided now, but this kept him contained while he babbled and played with the attached toys.

I reviewed the pack finances, satisfaction warming my chest. We were thriving—completely debt-free, with enough funds to expand without borrowing.

Our nursery was overflowing. We’d repurposed space in the children’s home while constructing a new one. Nearly every pack member had employment—whether in our shops, the packhouse, or Sebastian’s company.

Theodore and Rosalind had opened a smoked meats and hot sauce shop. That damn hot sauce lived up to the hype. The moment they started marketing it, demand exploded. Humans couldn’t get enough. Theodore now had a full team handling production and distribution. Rosalind still smoked meats for the kitchens, but half her stock sold in their store.

Nathaniel had built us a greenhouse, allowing year-round cultivation. The sprites managed it brilliantly—even I had to admit their magic was invaluable. Our gardens flourished, supplying both our kitchens and the market. Packs from distant territories now sought our produce.

Lillian’s chicken initiative had been another success. Hundreds of egg-layers and meat birds now roamed our lands. It gave the younger pups responsibility, kept them busy, and saved us a fortune on eggs and poultry.

With the baby boom, one of our omegas had launched a baby food business, using our garden’s harvest. She could barely keep up with demand—her stock sold out daily.

Life was good.

Better than good.

It was everything we’d fought for.

###Chapter 0452

Newcomers still arrive at our borders, though not as often as before. We never turn away those in need. Our medical team stands ready to assist anyone injured or ill.

After wrapping up my duties, I scoop up Sebastian, and we head toward the pack hospital. I’m unsure if Seraphina will discharge my mate tonight or keep her until morning. Either way, we’re prepared. The bassinet waits in our room for Isla, while the nursery holds Sebastian’s crib. By the time Isla transitions to the crib, Sebastian will be ready for his toddler bed—delivering next week. His current obsession? Dinosaurs. His room reflects that.

When we enter, my mate is awake, nursing our daughter. Her gaze lifts to me, the love for Isla shifting to me before settling on our son.

"How’s my little warrior?" she asks Sebastian.

"Mama. Mama." He reaches for her, squirming in my arms.

"Hold on, champ. Mom’s feeding your sister. Want to meet her?"

"Yeth," he says, his toddler lisp adorable.

I settle him beside Isolde at Isla’s feet. "Remember what I told you, son?"

His intelligent eyes meet mine, wheels turning. "We protect Mom and Isla with our lives. Right?"

He grins, recalling our talk. "Yeth."

"That’s what strong Alphas do."

Isolde snorts. "Sebastian, meet your sister. But fair warning—she’s no delicate flower. She’s an Alpha female, just like me. Cross her, and she’ll knock you flat."

"Can you say ‘Isla’?" I prompt.

"Ih-la."

Isolde and I exchange amused glances. "Close enough," she murmurs as Isla finishes nursing.

She passes Isla to me for burping while adjusting her clothes. Sebastian stares, mesmerized by his sister.

Once Isla burps, I ask, "Want to hold her?"

Sebastian extends his arms. I carefully place Isla in them, her head tilted toward Isolde for support. Isolde steadies Sebastian’s hands.

"You’re already the best big brother," she praises. He beams.

Seraphina enters, clipboard in hand. "Afternoon, Alpha. Hey, Sebastian. What do you think of your sister?"

"Ih-la," he announces.

"Exactly. Isla. Clever little Alpha, aren’t you?"

"Yeth," he replies solemnly.

Seraphina smiles before addressing us. "Heard the news? Evelyn just went into labor." She’d conceived her third child around the same time Isolde did.

Isolde’s brows rise. "How many kids does that make for the three packs’ Alpha families now?"

"Let’s see," I tally. "Sebastian and Seraphina have four. Adrian and Evelyn will have three. Plus our two. That’s nine." I smirk. "We’re lagging. Time to catch up."

She laughs, eyes glinting. "Maybe give me a day or two, Alpha." Her tone sends a jolt straight to my groin. This woman—she knows exactly what she does to me.

Seraphina chuckles. "At least a day or two. Your Luna needs to heal. But if you promise to behave, she can go home tonight."

"I’ll promise anything if it means sleeping beside my mate," I say.

That night, I curl around Isolde, listening to Isla’s soft breaths in the bassinet and Sebastian’s snores through the baby monitor.

I soak in the sounds of my family—safe, together—before sleep claims me.

###Chapter 0453
Nine years later

The crisp autumn air carried the laughter of children across the playground. Golden sunlight filtered through the changing leaves as our pack's next generation played without a care in the world. Seraphina, Evelyn and I had our children in close succession, resulting in thirteen little ones being raised together like one big family.

Julian stood out among them - the ten-year-old insisted we call him "Jules" now that he's "mature." He's the oldest boy sandwiched between two inseparable girls.

Sebastian and Seraphina kept expanding their family, conveniently filling the age gaps between Evelyn's and my three children each. Everyone jokes about Felicity being their "surprise baby" - though we all know Seraphina schemed for that fourth child after nearly dying during the twins' birth. The moment Sebastian said no more babies, the countdown began. Three years later, she got her way.

Victor and I weren't about to be outdone. Six months after Isla was born, we welcomed Riley Paige. Naming her after my mother was Victor's idea - he knew I couldn't bear using Paige as a first name, but suggested we honor her memory this way.

Where Isla runs wild with Sebastian, Donovan and Leopold (all born within six months of her), Riley prefers tea parties with Seraphina's twins Luna and Stella. Those three are already giving us gray hairs.

Between our three packs, the sprites who challenged Seraphina and Sebastian's fertility, and general pack baby booms, our territory overflows with children. Alistair and the twins produced fourteen - seven per twin, always born simultaneously. Evelyn's pack started taking bets on it. Theodore and Elara have six, while Titania and Rafael proudly claim four. And that's not counting other wolf-sprite pairs still expanding their families every six months.

We transformed the land between our territories into a massive playground. Nathaniel and craftsmen from all three packs built climbing structures for older kids, swings and sandboxes for little ones - every imaginable amenity.

A special zone accommodates our young shifters. Watching Jules, Ivy and Tobias race around with Felicity never gets old. When she finally shifted last year, we discovered her unique heritage - a rare wolf-bear hybrid.

The hunters' experiments left their mark. Felicity's build leans bear-like, but with wolf markings. Whether from her bear bloodline or Alpha father's genes, her strength is extraordinary. Leopold trains her privately to prevent accidents - warrior sessions let her unleash power safely among adults who can handle it.

Personality-wise, she's beautifully balanced. Pack-oriented yet needing solitude - unlike wolves craving constant company. School bullies learn quickly not to mess with her when our entire pack stands behind her.

Fate delivered an unexpected gift when Reginald found love again. His second-chance mate arrived grieving but open-hearted, stopping at our diner during her cross-country healing journey. She never left. Now they run the place together.

Rosalind, Aurora and Gwendolyn all found mates at our gatherings. Rosalind and Aurora remained with us, while Gwendolyn joined Adrian and Evelyn's pack. Vivian remains hesitant about mating again after her trauma - whatever path she chooses, I hope it brings her peace.

###Chapter 0454

The Supernatural Council was our brainchild years ago. Following the hunter war, we became the mediators for supernatural disputes. At its inception, the Council consisted of two Guardians, a vampire, and a fae.

Now, Finnian represents the fae. King Lucian, the first vampire to step foot in Angel after the war, sends his son as their delegate. My sisters voted me onto the Council permanently—being an Alpha female has its perks. One of them rotates in as well.

When other supernaturals petitioned for representation, we compromised. Instead of permanent seats, we allow any unrepresented species to send a delegate when bringing cases before us.

This system has worked flawlessly—except for that one demon who thought he could intimidate us with his aura. Seraphina and I drained him dry before tossing him out. As punishment, we banned all demons from hearings for a year. The next one who appeared was remarkably polite.

These quiet moments at home mean everything. We've fought through blood and tears to earn this peace. Every scar tells a story of loss and resilience. But we persevered. Now we're building a brighter future—for our children and every member of our pack.

My sisters and I lounge beneath an umbrella, each curled in our mates' arms. Someone brilliant suggested building a convenience store here—no more hauling coolers across the territory. Now we grill fresh meat or grab snacks inside. A full-service bar keeps our cocktails chilled as we watch the children play.

Oberon was right. This was always the destiny of the Guardians—to unite with their fated mates. Every one of our daughters shows Guardian potential. According to Oberon, this is unprecedented in Guardian history. It began with Evelyn, born to two destined Guardians. Now we're raising an entire generation of them.

I wonder—will our Guardian spirits return after this life? It feels like we're fulfilling the Moon Goddess's design. These children will become warriors who defend the weak and uphold justice in this world.

Leaning into Adrian, I flood our bond with love—then start sending him very different images. His sharp inhale tells me I've succeeded. Tonight will be... eventful.

Evelyn suddenly points toward the tree line. "Do you see that?"

Seraphina and I nod, though the men seem confused.

"Is that a couple with... giant dogs?" Seraphina squints.

Evelyn's voice drops to a whisper. "It feels like my parents."

We extend our auras. She's right—I sense Gregory's presence. Seraphina's widened eyes confirm she feels Ivy's energy too.

"I think it's them," I murmur.

Evelyn stands, but the figures raise their hands in farewell before dissolving into the forest.

"Do you think—?"

Adrian answers her unfinished question. "If it were you—any of you—would death stop you from watching over your family?"

We exchange knowing smiles. Nothing—not even the grave—could keep us from protecting our loved ones. My heart swells with certainty—our families are safe. Always.

###Chapter 0456

I can’t pinpoint the exact moment I fell for Gregory Sinclair. For years, I dismissed him as an arrogant playboy who thought he was the Moon Goddess’s personal gift to she-wolves. And honestly? He wasn’t entirely wrong.

The man was sculpted perfection—dark, tousled hair, emerald eyes that burned like gemstones against his sun-kissed skin, and a body that looked carved from marble rather than built by nature. Not that I’d spent much time staring. Okay, maybe every she-wolf in Blackthorn Pack had. Gregory wasn’t exactly modest about his… assets.

If being the future Alpha’s best friend wasn’t impressive enough, he was also a Guardian. In all of werewolf history, only two Guardians existed at any given time. They were legends—powerful, coveted, the ultimate protectors.

Fate had twisted in Gregory’s favor. His wolf, Evander, was born male, and he’d grown up alongside Adrian Grey, our Alpha heir. That meant when Adrian took over, Gregory would stand as both his Beta and his Guardian—a living shield.

Female Guardians didn’t have it so easy. Whispers spread of them being forced into mate bonds with their Alphas, trapped by the strength they brought to the pack. An Alpha would never let a Guardian slip away to another pack, not when they could chain one to their side through a bond.

But none of that concerned me. From the moment I got my wolf, Valeria, at ten years old, I’d dreamed of being a warrior. My parents were unranked, but that didn’t matter. I trained harder, fought fiercer. I’d make myself undeniable—so when I found my mate, he’d be proud. So his pack would be stronger for having me.

I’d earned my place among Blackthorn’s warriors. Even neighboring packs had started to notice.

Then everything shattered.

I woke on an ordinary morning during my seventeenth year, and my eyes burned gold.

A Guardian had died.

And now, Valeria and I carried their reincarnated spirit.

My life would never be the same.

And I wasn’t sure I wanted it to be.

###Chapter 0457

"Morning, Ivy." My ride-or-die, Seraphina, falls into step beside me as we head toward school. Senior year is almost over, and the weight of that reality hits me every morning.

"Hey, Sera."

We've been neighbors since birth, born a month apart. Same schools, same homework sessions, same extracurriculars—our lives have always been intertwined. Our parents practically raised us together. Lucky for us, we clicked instantly. Otherwise, childhood would’ve been hell.

"How was training?" she asks. The one thing we don’t do together anymore. Two years ago, she bowed out after completing the mandatory five years. Me? I live for the fight. She’d rather paint sunsets.

"I took down Silas today." I can’t hide my grin.

Her jaw drops. "Silas? The future Lead Warrior?"

"Pinned him until he tapped out." I’m practically floating. Beating him is a big damn deal.

"Ivy, that’s insane! You’re incredible!"

"Thanks, Sera."

A car slows beside us, window rolling down. Alpha heir Alistair smirks from the driver’s seat, his shadow, Gregory, lounging in the passenger side with that infuriating smirk of his.

"Morning, ladies. Need a lift?"

Sera goes rigid. Alistair’s been chasing her for weeks, ever since she shot him down cold. The shock on his face that day? Priceless. No one says no to the future Alpha. Now it’s become some twisted game to him.

"Good morning, Alpha. Guardian." I step in before Sera can speak. "We’re good."

Alistair ignores me, eyes locked on Sera. "What about you, Seraphina?"

She flashes him a smile so fake it’s almost insulting. "Like Ivy said, we’re fine."

Gregory leans over, his emerald eyes glinting. "Heard about your win today, Ivy. Impressive."

"Thank you, Guardian."

"Gregory. Call me Gregory."

I blink. Outside of training, he’s never acknowledged my existence. Too busy charming his way through every she-wolf in the pack. But ever since Alistair fixated on Sera, Gregory’s suddenly noticed me. Convenient.

"Last chance," Alistair drawls. "Sure you don’t want a ride?"

"Perfect day for a walk," I say sweetly.

"Next time, then." He revs the engine. "See you in class, Sera."

The second they’re gone, Sera groans. "Ugh. Why won’t he stop?"

"Because Alphas hate losing," I mutter.

"He’s slept with half the pack. Who’d want a mate like that?"

I side-eye her. "Uh, everyone but us? Also, newsflash—most Alphas are like that."

She sighs. "I just want someone kind. Quiet."

I snort as we hit the school parking lot. "We’re werewolves, Sera. Quiet lives don’t exist unless you mate a human."

"Worth a shot." She nudges me. "What was that with Gregory? He’s never spoken to you before."

"Guess beating Silas earned me his precious attention." I air-quote dramatically.

"He’s hot."

"Hot? Try dangerously attractive. Also, he’s a bigger player than Alistair. Hard pass."

Inside, the duo holds court by the lockers, surrounded by admirers. I’m mid-eye-roll when Gregory’s gaze snaps to mine. He winks—actually winks—while some girl hangs on his every word.

I shake my head just enough for him to see my disbelief. His smirk deepens.

Game on.

###Chapter 0458

Seraphina nudged me as we approached our lockers. "Did Gregory just wink at you?"

"Seemed like it."

"You definitely caught his attention."

"Maybe. Doesn't matter." I shrugged just as a large hand slammed against my open locker door. Heat radiated against my back.

I turned to find Silas looming over me. "Rematch tomorrow, gorgeous."

"Ready to lose again, Silas?"

He leaned down, his 6'2" frame towering over my 5'6". His breath tickled my ear. "Winner buys dinner Friday."

"Is this your awkward attempt at asking me out?" I shut my locker and faced him. Movement caught my eye - Alistair and Gregory were heading straight for us.

"What if it is?" Silas challenged.

"Then work on your pickup lines." I grabbed Seraphina's arm. "We need to go. Now."

Her head snapped up. She spotted the approaching duo. Silas turned and chuckled. "Good luck with that."

We wove through the crowded hallway at a near-run, dodging students. Alistair's laughter followed us. "Running won't help, Seraphina."

He wasn't wrong - they shared two classes with her.

First period passed uneventfully. Then came Chemistry, where Gregory decided to make himself my new lab partner. "Nathaniel, switch with me."

I crossed my arms. "Excuse you? Nathaniel's perfectly adequate." That was generous - he was mediocre at best. But standing inches from Gregory all semester? Absolute torture. My wolf might react to his dominance, but I refused to acknowledge it.

'Have you seen his wolf?' Valeria purred.

'Evander's massive - bigger than Magnus.' Magnus was Alpha Alistair's wolf. 'Guardians have Alpha strength. I think he's stronger than Alistair.'

'I'd love to rub against that magnificent beast.'

'Control yourself. We need to get through this class without broadcasting our attraction.'

"Finished consulting your wolf?" Gregory asked. Nathaniel had already fled - no one challenged a Guardian.

"Yes." I grabbed my textbook, determined to ignore him.

He leaned closer. "I bet she likes me."

"Implying I don't, Guardian?"

A low growl vibrated his chest. "I told you to call me Gregory."

"Right. Well, my wolf appreciates strength - and Guardians have plenty. If you're fishing for compliments, consider yourself flattered." I turned back to my book.

His chuckle sent shivers down my spine. Warm breath brushed my neck. "Sweetheart, there's nothing fragile about me."

"Noted. Let's begin."

To my surprise, Gregory excelled at chemistry. Where I'd carried Nathaniel, Gregory anticipated each step. Our competitive spirits flared as we raced to outdo each other.

While cleaning up, he caught me off guard. "You're good at this. Didn't expect that."

I flashed a saccharine smile. "I have layers, Gregory. You surprised me too. Nice to know there's a brain behind those muscles girls drool over."

"You really don't like me, do you?" A hint of vulnerability colored his tone. Impossible - why would he care?

I met his gaze. "It's not dislike. I refuse to be another notch on your bedpost. I don't know why you're suddenly interested, but if this is about sex, walk away now."

Before he could respond, I spun on my heel and marched to my next class.

###Chapter 0459

I turned fifteen last weekend.

I'd been hoping to find my mate on my actual birthday, but fate had other plans. Alistair and I spent both Friday and Saturday nights searching every corner of our territory, convinced she had to be nearby. When that didn't work, I resigned myself to the idea we'd have to travel beyond our borders to locate her.

Alistair turns eighteen in a few months, but he's already convinced Seraphina Grey is his destined mate. The problem? She wants nothing to do with him.

It's driving him insane.

Women have always thrown themselves at us—age never mattered. We've both had partners old enough to be our mothers. Until now, rejection was a foreign concept.

I found the whole situation hilarious.

Until Monday morning.

The moment I stepped onto the training grounds, an intoxicating scent hit me—citrus and spice, warm ginger with a hint of orange blossom. My wolf Evander snarled in my head, demanding I follow it.

I found Ivy Sinclair pinning Silas to the mat.

Silas, Alistair's future Lead Warrior. The strongest fighter in our pack besides me. Or so I'd thought, until Ivy flipped him like he weighed nothing.

Evander didn't like seeing her atop another male. Not one bit.

Her chestnut curls were tied back, revealing striking sapphire eyes that gleamed with victory. I'd trained her for years alongside Alistair, but I'd never truly seen her until that moment.

Strong. Skilled. Breathtaking.

Pride surged through me—my mate was a warrior.

Then she looked at me with the same icy disdain Seraphina showed Alistair.

Suddenly, it wasn't funny anymore.

Worse? She genuinely disliked me.

Evander needed proximity, so I swapped partners in Chemistry. What I discovered unsettled me—she wasn't just strong and beautiful. She was brilliant.

Thankfully, I took the subject seriously. As a Guardian, chemical knowledge could mean life or death—whether countering supernatural poisons or hunter concoctions.

When she accused me of only wanting her in my bed, reality hit hard.

Yes, I'd been reckless with partners. But I'd never led anyone on—they knew it was temporary. I'd always wanted my mate; I just hadn't considered how my past might hurt her.

None of the others cared about my history.

Ivy did.

That's why she's mine.

Now I had damage control to do.

First step? Learn her birthday. Then, convince her to accept our bond before she turns eighteen and feels the pull.

Two classes later, I slumped in Literature, debating whether to nap through another lecture on dead poets. Then her scent flooded my senses.

My eyes snapped open as she passed my desk, taking a seat three rows ahead.

How had I never noticed her in this class before?

###Chapter 0460

"Because you're an absolute moron." Evander's voice echoes in my mind. "Get closer to her. Switch seats with that girl behind her."

I stand abruptly, grabbing my backpack. "Hey Isabella."

"Hey Grant." She looks up at me with that familiar, sultry smile. Damn it, I didn't think this through. Isabella and I have history, and unlike Ivy, she's never been shy about what she wants from me.

"Mind switching seats with me?" I flash her my most charming grin. Out of the corner of my eye, I notice Ivy's shoulders tense.

Isabella's expression shifts from eager to confused as she glances at the back of Ivy's head. "Oh...uh, sure."

She gathers her things and brushes past me, her fingers trailing deliberately along my waistband. What used to send heat rushing through me now only irritates me. The last thing I need is Ivy getting the wrong impression. "Maybe I'll see you later?" Isabella murmurs, her hand dipping dangerously low.

"Yeah. Maybe." My reply is stiff with discomfort.

Our instructor walks in just as Isabella takes my old seat. I settle into hers, my attention fixed on Ivy's rigid posture.

Mr. Whitmore launches into a discussion about whatever novel we're supposed to be analyzing. When he turns to write on the board, I lean forward. "Hey Ivy," I whisper. The entire class, including our teacher, is werewolf.

She ignores me. So I reach out and twirl a strand of her silky hair around my finger. It's impossibly soft, and suddenly all I can think about is fisting my hands in it while claiming her mouth.

Ivy snatches her hair back and shoots me a glare over her shoulder. I smirk and do it again.

"Mr. Sinclair, perhaps you could focus less on Miss Sinclair's hair and more on the lesson," Mr. Whitmore calls me out. The class snickers, but I couldn't care less.

"Sorry, sir. But Ivy's hair is...distracting."

"You're a Guardian, Mr. Sinclair. I'm sure you can manage some self-control." He turns back to the board without waiting for a response.

Ivy gathers her hair over one shoulder, shooting me another death glare before facing forward again. Her scent envelops me, making it impossible to concentrate on the lecture. Meanwhile, Ivy remains unaffected, actively participating in the discussion as if I don't exist.

When class ends, Ivy grabs her bag and tries to slip past me. I block her path. "What are you doing after school?"

"Going home." She tilts her chin up to glare at me, her blue eyes blazing. The height difference between us only makes her defiance more adorable.

As she tries to push past me, I remember my original intention. "Alistair and I can drive you and Seraphina home."

She steps back, eyes narrowing. "No thanks. Now move."

I lean down, invading her space. "What if I don't?"

In a heartbeat, the tables turn. One second I'm in control—the next, I'm at her mercy. Without hesitation, her hand snakes out and grips me painfully tight. "If you don't," she hisses, twisting just enough to make me wince, "I'll make sure you and Isabella have a very disappointing evening. MOVE."

I step aside instantly.

She storms out without a backward glance.

'Smooth, idiot. You just pissed off our mate. Fix this!' Evander growls in my head.

'Got any brilliant suggestions?' I snap back.

'Stop trying to force her and actually make her like you.'

Easier said than done.

###Chapter 0461

What a pompous jerk! If he thinks his size gives him the right to intimidate me, he’s in for a rude awakening. Do I regret threatening to make him regret his existence? Not one bit. Did I accidentally notice the impressive bulge in his pants? Absolutely. And damn—that’s all I can say. Just… damn.

At lunch, I find Seraphina, and we ditch the dining hall to escape the two relentless males who’ve decided we’re their newest obsession. We settle on the bleachers overlooking the track field, and she vents about Alistair’s behavior—mimicking Gregory’s tactics by invading her personal space, cornering her after class, and bombarding her with invitations. It’s infuriating. I tell her about Gregory’s antics in Chemistry and Literature.

"You think they’ve made some kind of bet?" she asks, staring pensively at the empty track.

"What do you mean?"

She turns to me, her expression grim. "We’re the last two holdouts in the pack. Do you think this is just a game to them? A race to see who can break us first?"

"That’s a disgusting thought, Sera." But the more I consider it, the more it makes sense. Competition fuels Alphas—and apparently Guardians too. What if this is all just some twisted challenge between them?

Now I’m furious all over again.

"Do you really believe they’d do that?" she whispers, her gentle nature making her voice soft.

I squeeze her hand. Seraphina is too kind for this world. It’s why she dropped out of warrior training—she hates causing pain, even when necessary. She’d make an incredible Luna, with her nurturing heart and unwavering loyalty. Me? I have no qualms about making someone regret their choices—like grabbing Gregory where it hurts. That’s why I’m better suited for the battlefield than the Luna’s throne.

At least I get to choose my path. Seraphina’s fate is tied to an Alpha, though she’s pouring everything into her medical studies—a field where she’ll excel.

"I honestly don’t know," I admit.

After lunch, we head to our next classes. I have Human History with Gregory, though I doubt he realizes it after our Literature showdown. Maybe I can slip in unnoticed and block him from sitting near me.

History is my least favorite subject. Learning human wars feels pointless when, in our world, battles are constant. Packs fight for territory, power, and dominance. Casualties are expected. That’s why strong leadership matters—our Alpha and Guardian give us an edge. Even if another pack challenges us, they won’t win.

When I arrive, Gregory isn’t there yet. I take my usual seat by the window, leaving only two spots he could invade—beside me or behind me. I’m strategizing how to keep him away when he drops into the seat next to me.

"That seat’s taken," I say flatly.

"We don’t have assigned seating, Evelyn."

"Don’t you prefer the back? I’ve seen you napping there before."

His smirk is infuriating. "So you have been watching me."

"Still fishing for validation? Don’t you have enough admirers stroking your ego—and other things?"

He flinches. Good.

"You’ve got me all wrong," he insists.

I turn, locking eyes with him. "Do I?"

His mouth opens, then shuts. No clever comeback.

I raise a brow and face forward. "Didn’t think so."

The teacher announces a movie day. The class cheers; I groan. The lights dim, and Gregory subtly scoots closer.

"I’m not fishing for compliments," he murmurs.

"Mm-hmm."

"You really don’t understand me."

I stay silent, letting him squirm.

"I just want to know you," he says finally.

"Really?"

"Is that so hard to believe?"

I turn. "Why?"

He frowns. "Why what?"

"Why the sudden interest?"

He hesitates. Has no one ever called him out before? Probably not.

Seraphina’s theory rushes back. This has to be a competition.

"After all these years, you just woke up and decided we should be friends?" I press.

"I—well—yes."

Pathetic. I scribble on a scrap of paper.

When class ends, I shove it into his hand and walk away without a glance.

###Chapter 0462

My name is Ivy Sinclair.

I'm 17 years old.

I stand at 5 foot 6 inches.

Brown hair, blue eyes.

I plan to become a warrior after graduation.

And no, I won't sleep with you, so back off.

That's what the note said when she shoved it into my hands before storming out of class. I read it twice, then stared at the empty doorway where she'd disappeared. This wasn't going to be easy.

Every time those ocean-blue eyes lock onto mine, my brain short-circuits. My name? Gone. Basic conversation skills? Nonexistent. At this point, she probably thinks I've got the IQ of a rock.

You are a rock. Evander, my ever-helpful wolf spirit, chimes in.

Now she thinks I'm just after one thing. When she demanded to know why I suddenly started pursuing her, I froze. I can't exactly blurt out "we're fated mates." First, I need to fix this mess I've created. Apparently, my stunned silence made her assume I only wanted her in my bed.

Which, let's be real—I absolutely do. But not as some casual fling. I want this woman beside me every night, every morning, for the rest of our lives.

Maybe let me take over. You're making it worse. Evander growls.

Fine. What's your brilliant plan? I ask as we head out to meet Alistair.

Tonight. We track her down. I'll introduce myself properly. Not the worst idea he's had.

Still better than anything you've come up with. He counters.

"Hey, how'd it go?" I clasp hands with Alistair, nodding toward Seraphina who's walking ahead of us.

"Disaster. You?"

"Same." I'd told him this morning about Ivy being my mate. When we spotted her and Seraphina walking to school, I thought it was perfect—I'd get to know my mate while he spent time with his. Instead, we both crashed and burned.

"We need strategy." He mutters.

"Evander wants to track Ivy tonight. Might as well try."

Alistair rubs his chin. "Too small. We need something bold. I'm thinking... grand gesture."

I snort. "You and your dramatic moves. Just tell me what you need."

His eyes light up. "That's it!"

"What?"

"Top Gun bar scene. Singing to win her over."

"Your voice could shatter glass, man."

"Exactly. I'll keep singing until she agrees to go out with me." A wicked grin spreads across his face.

I shake my head. "And how do we get them to the bar?"

His smile falters. "Still working on that part."

We drive back to the packhouse. My parents moved here after my first shift revealed Evander's Guardian spirit. Alistair's parents wanted me close—protected. Two years ago, my parents' plane vanished over the ocean. After that, I was given a room on the Alpha floor. Alistair and I might as well be brothers.

We split up to change for training. My pulse kicks up—I'll see Ivy again. Maybe this time I won't turn into a tongue-tied fool. Alistair and I run morning drills while his father, Alpha Dominic, handles afternoons with Beta Nathaniel.

I arrive early, hoping to catch Ivy. When she's not there yet, I start warming up. Warriors gather around me, but the moment she steps onto the field, I break away.

"Ivy."

She rolls her eyes. "Gregory. Didn't my note make things clear?"

It stings, how badly she wants me gone. My own mate can't stand me.

"Actually," I shove my hands in my pockets, "I was going to ask you to dinner Friday. Not what you're thinking."

Her frown deepens. Dating's never been my thing—why bother when I knew my mate was out there?

"Sorry," she says as Silas walks by. She grabs his arm. "Silas and I already have plans, right?"

The way her eyes plead tells me this is improvised. But Silas, the idiot, grins like he's won the lottery.

"Yep. Discussed it this morning."

"Right." Ivy drops his arm. "And we're battling over who pays."

A growl rips from my throat. This jerk gets a date with my mate and won't even cover her meal? And she prefers this over going out with me?

I turn to Silas. "You take her out but won't pay?" His face pales as I step closer. "Maybe you don't deserve to take someone like Ivy out."

She shoves between us. "I can pay my own way, thank you. None of your business."

I keep my glare on Silas. His throat bobs. "Just a joke. Of course I'm paying."

"Oh?" I focus on Ivy. "So if I beat you in sparring, you'll go out with me?"

She scoffs. "I'm not stupid enough to fight a Guardian."

This fire in her—it's intoxicating.

"Afraid you'll lose?" If she wants to be a warrior, she's got to be competitive.

"You're a Guardian." She gestures to the training field. "If any of us could take you down, you wouldn't deserve the title."

And just like that, she walks away. This time, I don't bother hiding my frustrated growl.

###Chapter 0463

The audacity of this man. I've made it crystal clear I'm not interested, yet here he is, still trying to intimidate Silas for merely speaking to me. Not that I planned to say yes to Silas—his approach was painfully awkward—but he provided the perfect excuse when he walked by.

I hear Gregory growling as I stride away. Take the hint, buddy. Maybe then you wouldn't keep getting rejected.

I join the others warming up, stretching my muscles for training. Alpha Alistair and Beta Leopold call us to order. First, a five-mile run, then the team obstacle course. I fall into rhythm immediately. Running is my sanctuary, my time to clear my mind—or it would be if someone didn't insist on ruining it with his incessant chatter.

"What'll it take, Ivy blossom?"

"Ivy blossom?"

He flashes that infuriatingly confident grin. "You need a proper pet name. How about Lady Ivy? Sweet Thorn? Poison Petal? Too dramatic? I think Ivy blossom suits you."

"Ivy is fine," I snap, irritation sharpening my tone.

"Then how about Ivy bud? Oh, that's perfect. Ivy bud it is."

I grit my teeth and pick up speed. Pointless—he matches my pace effortlessly.

"So, Ivy bud, what do I have to do to get you to say yes?"

"I thought my note was clear, Gregory. I'm not sleeping with you. Since we both know that's your only goal, drop it."

"You've got me all wrong. Sure, I want you—you're stunning, fierce, and brilliant. But that's not why I'm asking you out. I genuinely want to know you."

I stop dead, turning to face him as other warriors jog past. "Why?"

"Why not? You clearly dislike me, but I think you'd change your mind if you gave me a chance. I'm more than just some guy trying to get laid."

I raise my voice so everyone nearby can hear. "Does anyone here believe Gregory Sinclair wants more than a one-night stand?"

A chorus of "No!" and "Hell no!" answers me. I smirk and start running again.

"Okay, my reputation isn't helping, but how will you know unless you try?"

"Not my problem. If you figure it out, let me know."

We finish the run and move to the obstacle course. Two at a time, and of course, Gregory positions himself beside me. Within seconds, it's clear he's pushing to beat me. Challenge accepted. I'm a damn good warrior, and even if he should outmatch me, I won't back down. My muscles burn as I push harder.

Rope swings. Rock walls. Crawling under nets. Sprinting over unstable logs. We're neck and neck, the others clearing a path as we barrel toward the finish. Our hands clamp onto the pole simultaneously.

Gasping for air, we collapse onto the grass, laughing. Okay, that was exhilarating.

Gregory stands first, offering his hand. His emerald eyes gleam as he smiles down at me, and for one treacherous second, my pulse stutters. Now I see why women fall at his feet—that smile could melt glaciers. Heat pools low in my stomach despite myself.

I take his hand, but the moment shatters when one of his conquests slinks over.

"Hey, Titan," she purrs, trailing fingers down his arm before eyeing me. "You don't mind if I borrow him, do you, Ivy?"

"He's all yours, Cassandra," I say, yanking my hand free.

I feel his gaze searing into my back as I find another sparring partner. Part of me had looked forward to testing my skills against him, but no way am I rolling around with "Titan." I'd almost forgotten that ridiculous nickname. Titan the Terrible. Earned by defeating our Alpha, Beta, and even Alistair. Strongest warrior in the pack. No wonder she-wolves flock to him—biology demands the strongest mates.

My human side revolts, but my wolf? She doesn't care about reputation. Only strength. And Gregory Sinclair radiates it.

Hence the fangirls calling him Titan. Maybe it's his thing. Not my business, and I refuse to find out. I'll die before calling him that.

I take down my sparring partner easily. Alpha Alistair observes, offering my opponent pointers before addressing me.

"Ivy, you should be training with Alistair or Gregory."

I force a smile. "Thank you, Alpha."

"Tomorrow, you'll spar with Alistair. You won't improve without challenge." Relief floods me—at least it's not Gregory.

After training, I head home. Shower first, but first, Valeria needs a run. At the tree line, I strip and shift, dropping my clothes by the back porch before vanishing into the woods.

Let her run. Let me forget.

For now.

###Chapter 0464

I thought I'd finally made headway with Ivy, until Cassandra showed up calling me "Big Daddy." That nickname never bothered me before—it used to spark all sorts of playful moments. But now, with Ivy watching, it felt like salt rubbed in an open wound.

Cassandra wasn't even a challenge to spar with. Her focus wasn't on training—it was on finding excuses to get me pinned beneath her. After flipping her onto the mat for the second time, I realized her intentions. As I held her down, she arched against me with a smirk.

Even though my wolf Evander and I only had eyes for our mate, biology betrayed me. The friction stirred a reaction she mistook as interest.

She twisted under me, tracing my abs with her fingers. "I've been very naughty, Big Daddy," she purred, biting her lip. "Maybe you should teach me a lesson in your room." Her hand slid toward my waistband.

I caught her wrist just in time, pinning her arms above her head. She took it as encouragement, licking my neck.

I vaulted off her, scanning the training grounds. Relief flooded me when I spotted Alpha Alistair deep in conversation with Ivy and her partner.

"Find someone else for that lesson," I growled, jogging toward the treeline.

Through the mind link, Adrian's laughter echoed. "Rough day, Grant?"

"Peachy," I snapped. "Tell me you're dealing with this crap too."

"Every damn day. Guess this is our punishment for past...indiscretions."

"Indiscretions?" I scoffed. "Try idiocy. I can barely get Ivy to look at me. If she'd seen that—"

At the forest's edge, I stripped and let Evander take over. The shift burned through me, fur erupting as my bones realigned.

'Our mate didn't witness your stupidity. This time.' Evander's snarl vibrated through our shared consciousness. 'No one touches us but her.'

"I know. But first, we need her to actually want us."

'You should've listened when I said to wait for our true mate.'

"Fine! You were right!" I snapped back.

Evander suddenly went silent, his focus sharpening. Then I caught it too—not a scent, but her scent. Ivy.

Perfect timing. I'd planned to let Evander approach her tonight anyway. Now fate handed us the opportunity.

'She's mine to chase,' Evander corrected possessively.

He surged forward, muscles coiling with predatory grace. Ahead, a sleek silver wolf darted between the trees—Ivy's wolf Valeria, moving with effortless agility. The moonlight gilded her fur as she wove through the underbrush, clearly enjoying her midnight run.

Evander rumbled a greeting. Valeria's ears swiveled toward us, her pace quickening instantly. The challenge lit Evander up—he loved the chase.

'She's fast,' I noted as Valeria zigzagged, forcing Evander to work for every inch. 'Almost as quick as Magnus.'

'Alpha blood?' Evander mused between leaps.

"Would explain why she's our perfect match."

The implications gave me pause. If Ivy had alpha lineage, where would our loyalties fall—with Adrian, or with our mate?

Valeria burst into a moonlit clearing, giving Evander the advantage. He closed the distance in powerful strides, finally tackling her with a playful nip to her hindquarters.

She rolled with the impact, snapping half-heartedly at his muzzle. Evander simply pinned her, his teeth gently gripping her scruff until she stilled with a soft whine.

The second she submitted, his entire demeanor shifted. A deep, rumbling purr vibrated through them both as he nuzzled her neck. When Valeria licked his jaw in return, hope flared in my chest.

'See? She hates you, not me,' Evander taunted.

Then Valeria began to shift. Evander scrambled back as fur melted into smooth skin, revealing Ivy kneeling in the grass—glorious and furious.

She rose, hands on her hips, moonlight painting her bare skin silver. "Evander," she demanded, eyes flashing. "What the hell was that?"

What do you think of Evander's approach?
Updates every Monday, Wednesday & Friday.

###Chapter 0465

My wolf has no issue bowing to Evander, but I won't submit to Gregory. Before my shameless wolf decides she wants to mate with Evander, I seize control and force the shift.

'I wouldn't have let him claim us, not yet anyway.' She practically vibrates with excitement, and I roll my eyes.

'What? He caught us. We were sprinting full speed, and he still outpaced us. That’s strength.'

'Yes, you’ve made that abundantly clear. Stop fawning. He’s a Guardian—literally crafted by the Moon Goddess. Remember?'

'Exactly.' Her voice drips with satisfaction.

Shifting back hadn’t crossed my mind as a spectacle for Gregory, but it’s not like he hasn’t seen a naked woman before. Rumor claims he cycles through them nightly.

I wait for Evander to shift back into Gregory, but he doesn’t. He just sits there, golden eyes locked on me.

'Evander? I assumed Gregory wanted to talk?'

A headshake.

'He wanted to play with Valeria.' Gregory’s voice cuts through the mind link.

Of course, Valeria flips onto her back in my mind, belly exposed. 'Have some dignity,' I snap.

'Just because Gregory sleeps around doesn’t mean Evander does. I’ve never seen him with another she-wolf.'

Huh. My infatuated wolf has a point. Unlike some, whose wolves mirror their humans’ recklessness, Evander has never indulged, despite the attention he gets. That realization softens something in me.

'You wanted to play with Valeria?' I murmur, stepping closer to stroke his fur.

He leans into my touch with a soft chuff, and I can’t help but smile.

'See? Perfect.' Valeria sighs.

'Did her speed surprise you?'

Evander pulls back, studying me.

'We’ve been training. She’ll outrun you one day.'

The wolf equivalent of a scoff.

'We’d train with you,' Gregory offers through the link. 'Push Valeria to her limits.'

'Hard pass. The last thing I need is the pack thinking we’re just another conquest. We’re fine alone.'

'Thanks for the chase, Evander.' I kiss his head—only for him to swipe his tongue up my face.

'Ugh! Disgusting!' I scrub at my chin.

Turning toward home, I hear a growl. Evander vanishes into the trees and reemerges as Gregory, shirtless, holding out a tee. 'Put this on. No need to parade around naked.'

'We’re the only ones here, and even if we weren’t, shifters aren’t shy.'

Another growl. I ignore it, but Gregory falls into step beside me.

'Packhouse is that way.' I jerk my thumb behind us.

'Making sure you get home safe.'

I snort. 'On pack lands? Really?'

'So. Lucas. Friday.'

I don’t want the date, but if it keeps Gregory away, I’ll go. 'Yep.'

'Saturday?'

'Seraphina and I have plans.'

'Sunday?'

I whirl on him. 'What’s your deal? Why the sudden interest?'

No more games. 'Is this some bet between you and Alistair? See who can bag the last holdouts? Because if so, you’ll both lose. We’re onto you, and I’m not becoming another notch.'

I jab his chest for emphasis. He catches my finger.

'Is that what you believe?'

'Seraphina’s theory, and it fits. You and Alistair ignored us for years. Now you’re relentless. Why else?'

'I want to know you, Ivy. Not just the basics.' His gaze doesn’t waver. 'My word as a Guardian—this isn’t about sex.'

That—that throws me. Gregory only gives his Guardian’s oath to Alistair and Alpha Sebastian.

Valeria hums. 'He’s sincere.'

'Brunch. Sunday. Take it or leave it.'

'Done. I’ll pick you—'

'I’ll walk.'

A growl. 'I’m picking you up. And paying. But I still want to spar tomorrow.'

'Alpha Sebastian already assigned me to Alistair.'

'I’ll handle that. And Valeria needs a challenge if she wants to improve.'

It echoes Alpha Sebastian’s advice.

'Tell Evander if he tries anything with Valeria, I’ll neuter him.'

Gregory smirks. 'He just cringed. Message received.'

I stride off. 'Same goes for you, Gregory. One wrong move, and you’re getting snipped.'

'Deal, Ivy bud.'

I flip him off over my shoulder.

###Chapter 0466

Finally! Ivy said yes! She agreed to go out with me, but now I need to convince Alistair to let me spar with her. And I have to explain why Seraphina keeps rejecting him. My reputation has never felt like such a burden until now.

I wait until Ivy disappears into her house with her clothes before jogging back to the packhouse. Dinner is in full swing, but I duck upstairs for a quick shower first. By the time I reach the dining hall, most of the pack has gathered—warriors fresh from training, families sharing meals, the usual chaos.

Alistair sits with his parents and Benedict’s family. Benedict’s son, Nathaniel, has been training as Alistair’s future Beta since I received my Guardian spirit at ten. He’ll do well in the role.

I grab a plate and slide into the seat across from Alistair, nodding at everyone.

“So?” He raises a brow. “How’d escaping Jules go?”

“Better than expected.” I smirk. “Valeria was out running, which gave me the perfect chance to finally get Ivy to agree to a date.”

“About damn time.” Alistair grins. “Better make it good, or she’ll never give you a second chance.”

He’s right. This has to be unforgettable.

“I need a favor,” I say, already knowing what I’ll trade for it.

His eyes narrow. “What kind of favor?”

“Your dad scheduled you to spar with Ivy tomorrow. I want to take your place.”

Predictably, he smirks. “And what do I get?”

I lean in, and he mirrors me, Benedict’s son eavesdropping shamelessly. “I know why Seraphina won’t go out with you.”

“Deal.” He doesn’t hesitate. “Talk.”

“She and Ivy think we made a bet—who can get them into bed first.” I lean back, watching his face fall.

“Shit.” He exhales. “How’d you get Ivy to say yes, then?”

“I gave her my word as a Guardian.”

He blinks. “You’ve only done that for me and your dad.”

“And Ivy.” My tone leaves no room for questions. No one else knows she’s my mate, and I intend to keep it that way.

After dinner, I head straight to my room—uncharacteristically early. Normally, I’d be out with the pack or deciding whose company I’d keep tonight. But now? The only person I want in my bed is Ivy.

I pull up brunch spots on my laptop, scrolling through reviews before settling on a cozy mountain diner an hour away. Nearby hiking trails for humans, dense forests where Evander and Valeria can run freely. Perfect.

Then, for the first time in my life, I crack open our literature assignment and start from page one. If impressing my mate begins in the classroom, so be it.

The next morning, I meet Alistair for training, gritting my teeth as Silas pairs off with Ivy. At least I’ll spar with her this afternoon. Maybe I can convince her to run with me afterward.

After warm-ups, we demonstrate the moves we want them to practice. I circulate, correcting stances, ensuring everyone alternates offense and defense. Just as I’m about to head to Ivy and Silas, a loud thud cuts through the noise.

Ivy stands over Silas, who’s wheezing on the ground, clutching his chest.

“What happened?” I stride over.

Ivy offers him a hand, hauling him up. “She wiped the floor with me,” Silas gasps. “Since when are you this strong, Ivy?”

“Maybe you let her win to dodge paying for dinner Friday,” I mutter. Petty? Absolutely. But the thought of him taking my mate out still burns.

Silas glares, still catching his breath. “No. She’s just that good.” He straightens. “And I told you—I’m buying regardless of who wins.”

“I’ve been practicing, Silas. Keep up,” Ivy says, dusting off her hands.

“Practicing for what?” This isn’t the first time she’s mentioned extra training.

“The warrior trials at the end of the year. I plan to win.”

Silas scoffs. “You gunning for my spot as Lead Warrior?”

“It’s not yours until you earn it,” I say flatly. If he’s going to lead, he shouldn’t be losing to her.

Ivy shrugs. “Besides, once I find my mate, I’ll leave the pack. So relax.”

My chest tightens. “What makes you think your mate isn’t here already?”

She gives a half-smile. “I’d have felt something by now. My birthday’s in two months.”

Oh, Ivy. If only you knew.

Alistair claps, ending the session. Ivy heads home, and I fall into step beside her. “Need a ride to school? No ulterior motives—just offering.”

“We’re good, Grant. See you in class.” She jogs off, leaving me staring after her. Again.

“Grant?” A voice purrs behind me. Beatrice leans in, her whisper hot against my ear. “I was hoping we could… talk over breakfast.”

I open my mouth to deflect politely—then spot Ivy glancing back. She sees Beatrice’s proximity, the suggestive smirk, and shakes her head before walking away.

Dammit.

###Chapter 0467

Just when I start believing Grant might actually be sincere, he proves me wrong all over again. Why on earth did I agree to that Sunday brunch? Worst decision ever. I need to find a way out of this mess.

I get dressed for school and head outside to meet Seraphina. "Morning, Sera."

"Okay, don't kill me." That's how she greets me. Not exactly the best way to start the day.

"What did you do?"

She gives me that guilty puppy look. "I kind of agreed to let Alistair drive us to school."

"You WHAT?!" My voice cracks. "Why would you do that?"

"I didn’t have a choice! He showed up at my house last night unannounced. My parents practically tripped over themselves when they saw him. Then he asked if he could take me to school today, and before I could say no, my mom said yes!"

I groan, throwing my hands up. "That explains why Grant mentioned giving us a ride. Ugh, Sera! I do NOT want to be seen arriving with them. He was already hooking up with someone right after training this morning. If we show up together, everyone will assume I'm next on his list."

I glance down the street. "Let’s walk fast. Maybe if he’s running late, we’ll already be at school before they catch up."

"I can’t." She nods toward her house. "My parents are watching." Sure enough, I spot them peeking through the blinds like overexcited spies.

"Please don’t make me ride with them alone," she begs. How am I supposed to say no to my best friend?

"You owe me big time."

"You’re the best!" she squeals just as a car pulls up behind us.

Before I can react, Grant and Alistair are already out, holding the doors open like chauffeurs.

"Seraphina, you’re up front with me," Alistair says smoothly. "Grant can sit in the back with Ivy."

I grit my teeth and move toward the door Grant is holding open. As I try to slip past him, he blocks my path. "It wasn’t what you think."

"What you do—or who you do—is none of my business, Grant." I duck under his arm and slide into the car, crossing my arms defensively.

He sighs before shutting the door and climbing in beside me. Alistair immediately starts chatting with Seraphina, while Grant leans closer to me, his voice low.

"Nothing happened. I’m serious about our date. No expectations—just spending time together."

"Like I said, not my concern. But out of curiosity, why bother with me when half the pack is already throwing themselves at you?"

"I want to get to know you. Is that so hard to believe?"

"I already agreed, so we’ll go." I turn to stare out the window.

"Where are you going?" Seraphina asks, clearly trying to escape Alistair’s conversation.

"Brunch with Grant on Sunday," I mutter.

She whips around in her seat. "You agreed?"

"Well, Friday I’m going out with Silas, and Saturday is our girls' night." I shoot her a pointed look, hoping she catches my silent plea for backup. "Then he swore on his Guardian oath that he wouldn’t try anything. So, brunch it is."

"Where are you going?" she asks, and I can practically feel Alistair’s irritation at losing her attention.

"There’s this place in town—" I start, but Grant cuts me off.

"Not there. I found somewhere special."

"Where?" I demand.

"Surprise. But it’s off pack lands."

The second we reach school, I bolt out of the car. "Thanks for the ride, Alpha, Grant." I give them a stiff nod before dragging Seraphina toward our lockers.

"Please tell me this isn’t happening all week," I hiss as we grab our books.

She winces. "Might be."

I groan. "Seriously, Sera?"

"Not my fault!" she protests before we split for class.

The day is a repeat of yesterday—except in Literature. Out of nowhere, Grant has actually read the book. Not only does he answer questions correctly (shocking everyone, including the teacher), but he even challenges some of my interpretations. Who is this guy?

In History, the boring movie drags on, and Grant scoots his desk closer. "Talked to Alistair. You’re sparring with me today."

"Thrilling," I deadpan, not tearing my eyes from the screen. Sparring with Grant sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.

"You want to win the warrior battles at the end of the year, right?"

Now I look at him. "Yes."

"Then you’ll want me training you. Let Evander work with Donovan. Makes sense, doesn’t it?"

He’s not wrong—but I’m pretty sure this is just his way of forcing me to spend time with him.

After school, I’m at my locker when Seraphina joins me. "We’re walking home, right?"

Just then, Alistair appears behind her. "Everyone ready?"

I glare at Sera. She never mentioned this.

"Pleeeeease," she mouths.

I force a smile. "Ready."

Then Grant steps up behind me. "Actually, Ivy and I are walking. Good warm-up before training. See you there."

I spin around. "We are?"

He slings my bag over his shoulder and steers me toward the exit. "Yes, we are." I glance back at Seraphina, eyes wide. She looks just as stunned, but Alistair smirks like he’s won the lottery.

"You two planned this," I accuse.

"No idea what you mean," Grant says innocently.

As we leave, I feel dozens of female eyes burning into me.

Perfect.

###Chapter 0468

Alistair had asked me earlier to arrange alternate transportation for Ivy so he could have some private time with Seraphina. Since I didn’t drive here, a brisk walk back seemed like the perfect solution. Truthfully, I didn’t mind the chance to spend time alone with Ivy either.

I felt her tense as we stepped out of the school. Good. Let them all see. I wanted to make my intentions clear.

In a few months, the entire pack would know she was my mate. Until then, their opinions meant nothing to me.

I steered the conversation toward today’s training session. "Tell me—where do you think your strengths and weaknesses lie?" I already had my own assessment from yesterday’s obstacle course, but I wanted to hear her perspective.

As we walked, I realized something remarkable. Ivy wasn’t just aware of her abilities—she had a sharp, analytical mind when it came to her own growth. Most warriors could list their strengths but struggled to acknowledge their flaws, let alone strategize how to improve them.

Not Ivy. She had clear ideas about where she needed work and how to push herself further. What she lacked was a sparring partner who could truly challenge her. I’d assumed Silas would have filled that role, but now I saw how wrong I’d been—both Alistair and I had underestimated her.

When we reached the fork where our paths diverged, I handed her bag back. "See you soon, Ivy."

I jogged to the packhouse, dropped my things in my room, and changed quickly. Excitement thrummed through me—I hadn’t felt this eager for a fight since my last match with Alpha Sebastian. A plan was already forming in my mind, a way to test Ivy’s limits while incorporating her own strategies.

Downstairs, I sought out Alpha Sebastian. "I spoke with Alistair. I’ll be sparring with Ivy today—my way. She’s better than I realized, and she has solid ideas for improvement. I want to push her."

Alpha Sebastian studied me. "Anything I should know, Gregory?"

He wasn’t fooled. The man had an uncanny ability to sense every undercurrent in the pack. But I wasn’t ready to discuss Ivy being my mate with anyone except Alistair. "Just making sure she gets the training she needs."

His skeptical hum told me he didn’t buy it. Fine. As long as he gave me the green light.

After a long pause, he nodded. "Alright. But you’ll tell me what’s really going on when you’re ready."

"Deal, Alpha."

"And we agreed you’d call me Sebastian, Guardian."

"Thank you, Sebastian." I turned just as Ivy approached.

"Gregory will be training you today," Alpha Sebastian announced before walking away.

I grinned at her. "You’re stuck with me."

She rolled her eyes but listened attentively.

"Actually, Alpha Sebastian approved a private session. I want to see what you’re capable of." I motioned for her to follow me to a more secluded area.

She hesitated, glancing back to ensure we weren’t being summoned.

Once we were clear, I shifted into a defensive stance. "Show me what you’ve got."

Her brows shot up. "You want me to hit you?"

"Try to hit me," I corrected.

A mischievous glint lit her eyes. "What about kicking? Can I kick you?"

I smirked. "Like I said—you can try."

Confidence radiated from me. She was good, but I was a Guardian. The only ones who could defeat me were other Guardians—and the sole remaining one lived halfway across the country.

Let her try. This was going to be fun.

###Chapter 0469

Her piercing gaze assesses me for a heartbeat before she strikes. I deflect the first blow effortlessly. She shifts her weight, bouncing lightly before attacking again. A quick jab, then a spinning elbow aimed at my ribs. I block both, barely avoiding the second hit.

The way she retreats tells me everything. That spark in her eyes? Pure adrenaline. This is just the beginning.

Her skill astonishes me. After years of training her myself, how did I miss this level of proficiency? Either she's been hiding her true ability or putting in secret training sessions. Maybe both.

Speed favors me, but her agility surpasses mine, balancing our strengths. We fall into a rhythmic dance of attack and defense. Though I could end this anytime, I want her to learn from every opening she leaves. My strikes land softer than usual - teaching, not defeating. The exchange thrills me. Her style differs completely from Alistair, Sebastian, and Donovan's brute force approach. She fights with cunning and grace, adapting instantly. Every time I land a hit, she blocks that same move the next attempt.

The growing crowd snaps me from focus. Warriors encircle us, cheering wildly. Sweat drenches both our bodies after nearly two hours of continuous sparring. Time to conclude this session. I still need to give Valeria time with Evander.

I attempt a takedown maneuver from earlier. She anticipates it, dodging smoothly. Her leg sweeps toward mine, but I leap over it, rolling back to my feet as she does the same. Increasing my intensity, I try to overpower her. Her reflexes amaze me. With each successful dodge, the crowd's support for her grows louder.

Finally, an opening. I seize her leg. When pulling free fails, she launches her other leg toward my head - either aiming for a kick or neck wrap. I catch that limb too, slamming us both to the ground. My body pins hers, her arms trapped above her head.

"Got you," I whisper against her ear. Our heavy breaths mingle. The heat of her body, the citrus-ginger scent of her skin - it overwhelms my senses. Distracted, I lean in...

Pain explodes as her knee connects with brutal precision. Every male spectator winces in sympathy. Meanwhile, Ivy springs up effortlessly.

"Great match, Gregory. But don't mistake sparring for permission," she tosses over her shoulder, leaving me curled on the ground clutching my injured pride.

###Chapter 0470

He was actually going to kiss me. In front of the entire pack. Like I'd let that happen. My knee reacted before my brain did—maybe with a little more force than necessary. Serves him right. Guardians heal fast, anyway. His future mate won't have to worry about his ability to produce pups.

'Run with me, Evelyn? Evander might come looking for us again.'

'Yes. I need the practice. And I don't mind if he catches me. Maybe he'll pin me down and lick my muzzle again.' Valeria purred in my mind.

I rolled my eyes. At least Evander had more restraint than my wolf.

'I never said I wouldn't wait for our mate. I just enjoy being chased. There's a difference.' She huffed.

"Whatever," I muttered.

I was about to strip and shift when my father appeared behind me. "What was that with Gregory Sinclair at training? Looked like he was about to kiss you."

"I made sure he won't try that again. His balls are probably lodged in his throat by now." I smirked, expecting him to laugh.

He didn't. "Stay away from him, Evelyn. He's a Guardian. Nothing good comes from that."

"I know, Dad. Trust me, I'm not delusional enough to think he wants anything serious." Except Gregory had sworn on his Guardian oath not to push me. Now I had to figure out how to meet him Sunday without my parents finding out.

Once he left, I shifted and bolted into the forest. Valeria sprinted over rocks, leaped across gaps, pushing her limits.

Then Evander approached cautiously, unsure of his welcome after the Gregory incident. Valeria didn't hesitate—she bounded over, rubbing against him.

He nipped playfully, and they were off. I had to admit, Evander pushed her harder than anyone. Not as agile, but strong. Fast. After an hour, we called it. They raced back, Valeria yipping as Evander chased her.

At the treeline, I stopped. So did he, head tilted in question.

"My father doesn’t want me seen with you. Better if he doesn’t catch you walking me home."

"He doesn’t want you with the pack’s Guardian?"

"He doesn’t want me with Gregory Sinclair. Your reputation precedes you. And that almost-kiss didn’t help."

"Then how am I supposed to pick you up Sunday?" Irritation sharpened his tone.

###Chapter 0471

"I'll pick you up and we'll go together." I say, watching as Evander shifts back into Gregory's human form.

The moment the transformation completes, Gregory stands tall, hands planted firmly on his hips. "I'm not hiding from your parents, Ivy. We're both adults - you'll be eighteen soon. I have no issue speaking to them directly, but I refuse to sneak around like some hormone-driven pup. They should be honored that I'm pursuing their daughter."

Through our mind link while still in Valeria's wolf form, I tease, "Pretty sure Dad's not worried about the dating part. It's what you might try after the date that concerns him." Taking full advantage of my current form, I let my gaze roam over Gregory's sculpted physique - the broad shoulders tapering to that perfect V at his waist, the defined muscles that make my pulse quicken.

"Shift back so we can talk properly," Gregory demands. "I'm serious about this, Ivy. No sneaking, no hiding. I want everyone to know I'm courting you. You deserve to be shown off, not tucked away like some dirty secret."

Returning to human form, I mirror his stance, hands on my hips. "That's just it, Gregory. There is no 'us'. You made it clear you're searching for your mate, and I'm not old enough to find mine yet. Maybe Dad's right - we should cancel Sunday."

A deep growl rumbles from his chest as he grabs my arms, leaning down to meet my eyes. "No, Ivy. Why won't you believe I want more than just sex from you?"

"Maybe because that's all you've ever wanted from any female," I snap, instantly regretting the hurt that flashes across his face. Before I can make it worse, I pull away. "I need to go."

Gathering my clothes, I glance back to see him standing at the tree line, watching me intently. I enter the house without another word, shutting the door firmly behind me.

Later that evening while doing homework, the ringing phone interrupts my thoughts. Dad's tone shifts dramatically when he answers, making me pause to listen.

"Of course, Alpha Alistair." A tense silence follows.
"I meant no disrespect." More silence.
"No, I wouldn't interfere." Another pause.
"Yes, Alpha." The receiver clicks loudly.

Moments later, heavy footsteps approach my door. The knock is perfunctory before Dad barges in. "When exactly were you planning to tell me about your date with Gregory Sinclair?" he snarls.

"What?"

"That was Alpha Alistair. Apparently Gregory went straight to him, claiming I was preventing your date. Now he's demanding to know why I think his Guardian isn't good enough for my daughter." Dad's voice rises with each word. "So I'll ask again - when were you going to tell me?"

"Gregory did ask me out," I admit. "Valeria and I ran into Evander during training tonight. He helped us, then walked us home. I mentioned you didn't approve, but I never thought he'd go to Alpha Alistair about it."

"Well he did," Dad shouts, face reddening. "So congratulations - you're going out with Gregory whether I like it or not!" The door slams shut behind him with enough force to rattle the pictures on my wall.

###Chapter 0472

If Gregory Sinclair thinks he can keep me from my mate, he's dead wrong. He might not realize Ivy is my destined partner, but any other father in this pack would be overjoyed to have me courting their daughter.

I wait until the shower starts running before grabbing a pair of shorts I stashed in the trees for after shifts. Then I march straight to her front door and knock.

The door swings open—her father.

"Mr. Sinclair." He steps outside, shutting the door behind him.

"Grant Sinclair. What do you want?"

"I'd like your permission to take Ivy out."

"Stay away from my daughter." He turns and slams the door in my face.

What the hell?

Fuming, I head straight to Adrian's room. No pleasantries. "I need your help."

He stands immediately, taking in my agitation as I pace.

"Whatever you need, Grant." He grips my shoulder, steadying me.

"Gregory Sinclair won't let me near Ivy." His lips twitch, but I'm in no mood for humor. She's my damn mate. No one keeps me from her.

"Forget it. I'll handle this myself." I snarl, turning to leave.

He yanks me back. "I didn't say no. You're my brother. I'll fix this."

That's why Adrian will be a great Alpha. While I act first, he strategizes.

"Thanks."

He claps my shoulder. "That's what we do."

Over dinner, I explain everything. Adrian whistles. "I'll deal with her dad, but you need to handle Ivy. Sure you want me involved?"

"Do it."

"Fine. But if she kicks your ass, that's on you."

Back in his room, he calls Gregory.

"Gregory, it's Alpha Adrian. How are you?"

After the greeting, Adrian continues smoothly, "Need a favor. Heard you're blocking my Guardian from seeing Ivy?"

I scoff when Gregory claims no disrespect.

"So you won't interfere with Grant taking her out Sunday?"

Relief hits when he agrees—not that he'd defy his Alpha, but fathers have rights.

"If you have concerns about my Guardian, bring them to me."

After hanging up, Adrian eyes me. "Tell him she's your mate. Might change his mind."

I shake my head. "Not before she knows. Her parents would act differently, and Ivy's too sharp to miss that."

That night, I order a guitar online. I've got a plan for Ivy—even if I've never played a note in my life.

The next morning, we pick up Ivy and Seraphina outside her house. When I open the car door for Ivy, I spot her father watching from the window. I nod. He turns away.

Whatever. His daughter's the one who matters.

But Adrian was right—Ivy's furious. She barely speaks during the ride. At her locker, she drags me into an empty hallway.

"How dare you! Using Adrian to pressure my father!"

I cross my arms. "I told you I wouldn't sneak around, Ivy."

###Chapter 0473

If Gregory Sinclair thinks he can keep me from my mate, he's dead wrong. He might not realize Ivy is my destined partner, but any other father in this pack would be overjoyed to have me courting their daughter.

I wait until the shower starts running before grabbing a pair of shorts I stashed in the trees for post-shift. Then I march straight to her front door and knock.

The door swings open—her father.

"Mr. Sinclair." He steps outside, shutting the door behind him.

"Grant Sinclair. What brings you here?"

"I want your permission to take Ivy out."

"Stay away from my daughter." He turns and slams the door in my face.

What the hell?

Fuming, I head straight to Adrian's room. No pleasantries. "I need your help."

He stands immediately, reading my agitation as I pace.

"Whatever you need, Grant." He grips my shoulder, steadying me.

"Gregory Sinclair won't let me near Ivy." His lips twitch, fighting a smirk. I don't find it funny. She's my damn mate. No one keeps me from her.

"Forget it. I'll handle this myself." I snarl, turning to leave.

He yanks me back. "I didn't say no. You're my brother first. I'll fix this." His calm is infuriating—and exactly why he'll be a great Alpha. "Dinner first. Then I'll call him."

I nod. "Thanks."

He slings an arm around me. "That's what we do."

Over dinner, I lay it all out. Adrian whistles. "I can deal with her dad, but you need to handle Ivy. Sure you want me stepping in?"

"Do it."

"Fine. But if she kicks your ass, that's on you."

Back in his room, he dials. Gregory answers.

"Gregory, it's Alpha Adrian. How are you?"

After the greeting, Adrian continues smoothly, "Need a favor. I hear you're blocking my Guardian from seeing Ivy?"

I scoff when Gregory backpedals.

"So you won't interfere with Grant taking her out Sunday?"

Relief hits when he agrees—not that he'd defy Adrian, but fathers have rights.

"If you have concerns about my Guardian, bring them to me."

After hanging up, Adrian eyes me. "Tell him she's your mate. It might help."

I shake my head. "No one knows before she does. Her parents would act differently, and she'd figure it out."

That night, I order a guitar online. I’ve got a plan for Ivy—if I can learn to play the damn thing.

Next morning, we pick up Ivy and Seraphina. When I open the car door for Ivy, I spot Gregory watching from the window. I nod. He turns away.

Whatever. His daughter's approval matters. Her parents can come later.

But Adrian was right—Ivy's furious. She barely speaks during the ride. At her locker, she drags me into an empty hallway.

"How dare you!" she hisses. "Going to Adrian behind my back?"

I cross my arms. "I told you I wouldn't sneak around, Ivy."

###Chapter 0474

I probably shouldn't have found it so hilarious, but watching Grant Sinclair turn the shade of a ripe tomato was priceless. The mighty Guardian of Alphas, blushing like a schoolboy. His apology had been sincere, though. Too sincere. It was getting harder to ignore the way my pulse quickened around him.

Yesterday's training session had been a mess. I expected to spar with Grant again, but my father intervened, dragging me away as his partner instead. Grant didn't protest. Then Dad dropped another bomb—no more training with Valeria.

This morning, though, he couldn't stop me from riding with Grant and Alistair without making it obvious he was keeping us apart. Something was off. Dad had never been this overprotective before, not even when other warriors had asked me out.

And now this weekend trip. He insisted I accompany him to the Sapphire Moon Pack, leaving Saturday and returning early Sunday. I'd already made plans for Friday night, so we compromised.

Grant was nowhere to be seen for the rest of the day. Probably went home to shower. When I arrived at training, there he was—still flushed, deep in conversation with Alpha Nathaniel, who looked like he was fighting a smirk.

"Evelyn," Dad called sharply, just as Nathaniel spotted me. "You're with Grant today."

I glanced at my father. His jaw was clenched, but he couldn't argue. Nothing inappropriate would happen on the training grounds.

Grant's fists were tight, his gaze locked on my father with narrowed eyes.

"Grant." I touched his arm, waiting until he looked at me. "Ready to get your ass handed to you?"

He barked a laugh. "Bring it, little wolf."

We moved away from the others, and he took a defensive stance. "Show me what you remember."

I smirked. "Hard to take you seriously when you look like a lobster who forgot its sunscreen."

"You won't be laughing when you're eating dirt," he shot back, crooking his fingers in challenge.

Today's session was brutal. His strikes were sharper, his pushes harder. But I held my own. Two hours later, we were both drenched. He was careful now—no accidental knee-to-groin incidents.

Dad waited for me afterward, his expression stormy. I braced for another argument about Valeria, but Grant grabbed my hand and pulled me toward the forest.

"What are you doing?"

"Valeria needs her training." His tone left no room for argument.

I knew what this was—making sure Dad couldn't interfere. It was bizarre. Any parent would kill for a Guardian to personally train their child. Any parent except mine.

Mom wasn't a warrior, and she never crossed Dad. No help there.

In the woods, we stripped and shifted. Valeria practically vibrated with excitement when she saw Evander. He pushed her hard—speed, agility, navigating the rocky terrain. An hour later, we shifted back, dressing quickly before Grant walked me home.

"Still going out with Silas tomorrow?" he asked casually.

"Uh, yeah." I hadn't spoken to Silas since Tuesday.

"Where's he taking you?"

"No clue." I wasn't exactly thrilled about the date. I'd have to text him tomorrow for details.

"And Seraphina on Saturday?"

"Actually, no. Dad's dragging me to Sapphire Moon Pack. We leave Saturday, back in time for our Sunday date—since Dad promised Alpha Alistair he'd allow it."

Grant went still. "Sapphire Moon? Why?"

"No idea. But he's insisting."

The silence stretched too long. I stopped walking. "What?"

"Alpha Dominic is looking for a mate." His voice was tight.

I laughed. "I'm not even of age yet. My birthday's in two months."

"Right." But his jaw stayed tense. "You'll be back for our date?"

"That's the plan."

"Is your mother going?"

"Dad said it's just business with the Alpha."

###Chapter 0475

We halt near my house. "Ivy, promise me something." His tone turns deadly serious.

"Suuuure." I drawl, amused by his dramatics.

"If anything feels off this weekend, call me immediately. Do you have my number?"

"Is this your sneaky way of getting my digits, Grant?" I tease, hand on my hip.

"I already have yours, Ivy." A faint smirk plays on his lips. "But do you have mine?"

"Nope."

"Expect my text tonight. Save it. If trouble comes, I'll be there in minutes."

"You're not joking?" My brows furrow.

"Dead serious."

"Alright, Grant." I shake my head in disbelief.

"Now get inside before your dad starts wondering where you are."

I sprint to the door, pausing to glance back. This time, I give him a proper wave before entering.

Later, homework sprawled across my bed, my phone chimes.

Unknown: Ivy, it's Grant. Save this number.

Me: Yes, sir.

Unknown: Do I detect a hint of obedience kink?

Me: Don't you have enough girls swooning over your 'commanding Alpha' act?

Silverfang: None of them are you.

Me: There's a damn good reason for that.

Silverfang: Enlighten me.

Me: Self-preservation. Standards. Common sense.

Silverfang: Ouch. Tell me more about these... standards.

Me:

Silverfang: Sleep tight, gorgeous. See you at dawn.

Me: Night, Grant.

Morning comes too soon. Training pairs me with another female warrior - her fighting style refreshingly different from the males. We're an hour into drills when the alarm howl shatters the peace.

Rogues.

Every warrior shifts instantly, charging toward the border. Through my peripheral vision, I spot Alpha Alistair and Beta Nathaniel sprinting from the packhouse, fur erupting mid-stride. Grant and Adrian lead the vanguard.

The forest explodes with snarling rogues.

I dive into the fray without hesitation. This is why we train. Why we bleed. Why we push beyond limits.

The stench of rogues assaults my senses - rotting meat and infected wounds. Valeria clamps onto one's hind leg, shaking violently until bone snaps. Before the crippled rogue can retreat, she tears out its throat and whirls toward the next threat.

Reinforcements arrive, but we're still outnumbered. I'm engaging one rogue when another sinks teeth into Valeria's flank. Her pained yelp cuts off as she rakes claws across the attacker's face, shredding an eye.

The wounded rogue staggers back just as the first leaps onto Valeria's back, jaws snapping at her neck. I see the wounded one regrouping for another attack when suddenly -

The weight vanishes.

Valeria whips her head around to see Evander disemboweling the rogue, then ripping out its throat. He pivots and crushes the spine of my opponent before rejoining Adrian's side. No time to process that the Beta abandoned his post to save me - another rogue lunges.

When our numbers finally overwhelm them, the rogues flee. The victory howls ring hollow as I survey the wounded. Valeria moves to check the nearest fallen when Evander bounds over. He noses her wound, whining before shifting back.

Grant kneels beside me, examining the gash. "Shift back, Ivy. Rogue bites fester fast." His hands cradle Valeria's muzzle. "You fought well, little wolf." Evander's voice layers beneath his, golden eyes flashing. "But let the healers tend to this." His lips brush her forehead before he pulls away.

The shift burns like fire across the bite. Grant summons a healer the moment my human skin reforms. The wound sits high on my thigh, deep and angry.

Behind us, Alpha Alistair barks orders, summoning Grant among others.

"Stay with the healer." Grant squeezes my shoulder. "I'll check on you later."

"Grant!" He turns at my call. "Thank you."

That devastating wink flashes before he disappears into the packhouse chaos.

###Chapter 0476

My heart nearly stopped when I spotted Valeria pinned beneath a rogue wolf, with another lunging toward her. My Guardian instincts to protect Alistair were instantly overridden by the primal urge to protect my mate. At least I didn’t have to choose—Alistair was safe, but Ivy needed me.

Inside the packhouse, Gregory briefed us on the plan. We were hunting down the remaining rogues. Trackers were already on their trail, but he wanted them eliminated. The attack had been coordinated, and Beta Nathaniel would stay behind to interrogate the captured rogues.

Gregory warned we’d be gone all weekend. I wasn’t thrilled.

Something about this trip to Sapphire Moon Pack didn’t sit right with me. Alpha Dominic was actively seeking a chosen mate, and Ivy was more than worthy. But she was still underage—she wouldn’t recognize a mate bond yet. I should know, considering I was her mate.

Last night, I’d asked Alistair to dig into it. Why was Gregory so against me dating Ivy but perfectly fine parading her in front of another Alpha? Being mated to a Guardian carried just as much prestige as being mated to an Alpha. And while I doubted Dominic would force a mark, the thought of Ivy being alone there made my skin crawl.

If he so much as looks at her wrong, I’ll tear him apart, Evander growled in my mind. Most mates might make empty threats—but we could actually back ours up.

I packed my bag and shot Ivy a quick text.

Me: Let me know what the doctor says. Heading out with the team to track the rogues. I won’t have my phone on me the whole time, but I’ll check when I can. Stay safe.

Mate: I will. And thanks again for today. Doctor says I just need a couple days’ rest. Should be fine by our date.

Me: Good. But I might not be back in time. Don’t tell your dad—just in case we wrap this up early.

At least Silas was coming with us. That meant Ivy wouldn’t be going on any dates with him this weekend—or ever, if I had my way.

We ran for hours, closing in on the rogues’ trail. By nightfall, we set up camp. I stepped away from the group to check on Ivy.

Me: How are you feeling?

Mate: Sore, but healing. Any luck with the rogues?

Me: Getting closer. Where are you guys staying tomorrow?

Mate: Leaving at 6 AM. Dad wants a full day with Alpha Dominic. It’s a three-hour drive—we’ll be there by breakfast.

Me: Ivy, listen to me. If anything feels off, you call me. I don’t care if I’m in the middle of a fight.

Mate: Is that you or Evander talking?

Me: Both. We worry. Get some sleep. I’ll text you before you leave.

Mate: Goodnight, Grant. Goodnight, Evander.

How much longer until she turns eighteen and realizes she’s ours? Evander grumbled.

Not long enough.

###Chapter 0477

'Just under two months.'

'Feels like an eternity.' His words mirror my own thoughts exactly.

I return to the gathering, grabbing a plate of food while scanning for Alistair. Spotting him on the phone, isolated from the crowd, my stomach tightens at the grim expression he wears.

The moment he ends the call, his sharp nod summons me away from prying ears.

"What's wrong?" I demand, already striding toward him.

"Sit down." That tone never precedes good news.

"I'll stand. Spit it out."

"Discovered something about Aaron Sinclair's dealings with Alpha Dominic."

My jaw clenches. "And?"

"He's drowning in gambling debt to the Sapphire Moon Pack. Six figures."

A harsh exhale escapes me. "That's not debt—that's a death sentence. He can't possibly repay that."

"Correct." Alistair hesitates, then delivers the killing blow. "But we both know Dominic's actively seeking a mate."

Evander erupts in my skull, my snarl ripping through the clearing loud enough to halt nearby warriors mid-conversation.

"You think he'd sell his own daughter?" My voice drops to a lethal whisper that would make lesser men tremble. Alistair merely raises placating hands.

"I'm stating facts, not conclusions. Could be coincidence. But we need my father's counsel on this."

"Need me for what?" Alpha Patrick materializes from the shadows like a specter, his silent approach unnoticed until now.

I pace like a caged beast, claws elongating as Evander's fury threatens to surface. "Gregory." Alistair warns, but only Patrick's firm grip on my shoulder halts my frantic movements.

"Start from the beginning. We'll find a solution."

I meet the steady gaze of the man who raised me after my parents' deaths—who never treated me as anything less than his own blood. Drawing a shuddering breath, I lay out everything: discovering Ivy as my mate, her father's inexplicable hostility, this weekend's sudden trip to Sapphire Moon territory, the suspicious absence of her mother, and now this damning debt.

"Dominic operates with brutal efficiency when debts go unpaid. Why didn't Aaron come to me when this spiraled? I'd have disciplined him, but covered the debt to prevent this disaster." Patrick rubs his temple. "His behavior reeks of desperation. Though it's equally possible he's simply hoping Dominic will favor Ivy as a potential mate."

"She's MINE." Evander and I roar in unison.

"I know." Patrick remains unshaken. "But she doesn't. As of now, only we three hold that knowledge." His gesture encompasses our tight circle.

"Dominic wouldn't claim an underage mate—the scandal would tarnish his pack, and he knows I'd declare war. But that doesn't stop him from evaluating her future potential. Or prevent her father from... influencing her choice."

Evander's rage scorches through my veins, patches of fur erupting across my forearms as I battle for control.

"Can't we relocate her to the packhouse? Remove her from his influence until her birthday?"

Patrick's exhale carries the weight of centuries-old laws. "I won't abuse Alpha authority, Gregory. Unless Aaron directly endangers her or forces a mating, my hands are tied."

Evander's fury ignites my blood, my vision tinting red as claws pierce through my fingertips. The scent of my own blood fills the air.

###Chapter 0478

"But," Theron places his hands on my shoulders, "that doesn't mean I can't keep a closer watch on both her and Magnus. And I can make sure you still train with her daily."

It's the best I can hope for right now. Unless Ivy's father does something reckless, I'll have to wait until she turns eighteen.

I take several deep breaths, finally pulling Evander back. Restlessness keeps me awake all night. I just need this over with so I can get back to Ivy.

At dawn, I text her. She replies that she's still sore but improving. That's all I manage before we leave.

We catch up to the rogues by late afternoon. Evander and I are itching for a fight, needing to burn off our fury. The battle lasts less than an hour. Unfortunately, several are injured, and exhaustion weighs on everyone after running all day before the fight. They decide to camp in the forest again.

The moment I can, I check my phone. One text from Ivy, sent hours ago.

Mate: Hey Grant. Just checking in.

Me: Hey Ivy. How are you? What are you doing while your father finishes his business with Alpha Dominic?

I wait. And wait. And wait longer. No reply.

Alistair brings food, but I barely touch it. I need to know she's okay.

Hours pass before I finally get a response. Not what I hoped for, but at least she answered.

Mate: Hey Grant, sorry it's late. This whole trip has been weird. We'll talk more when you're back. Will you be back tomorrow for our date?

Me: Ivy, call or text me anytime. I'll always answer. Yes, we'll be back tomorrow, but late. Don't tell your dad. Are you still leaving early to go home?

Mate: Yes, that's the plan. I'm exhausted. Going to bed. See you tomorrow.

Me: Okay, Ivy. I'll check in first thing in the morning and let you know when I'm back.

Mate: Goodnight, Grant.

Me: Goodnight, Ivy.

Sleep evades me again. All I want is to get back to her. In the morning, I text her, but there's no reply before we head home.

I push the group to move faster, ignoring Theron and Alistair telling me to slow down. I don't care. I need to see her.

When we reach the packhouse, I don't shift back until I'm at my bedroom door. I storm in, dumping my bag on the bed, grabbing my phone before heading to the bathroom to turn on the shower.

Me: Hey Ivy. Just got back. Are you home?

No reply. I turn up my phone's volume in case she texts while I shower. I wash quickly, scrubbing off the dirt, then check my phone again—just in case. Nothing.

Towel around my waist, I step into my room when frantic knocking echoes at my door. Before I open it, her scent—orange and ginger—hits me. I smile as I pull the door open.

The smile dies instantly.

Despair paints her face.

I yank her inside, shutting the door. "Ivy? What's wrong? Did that Alpha hurt you?" My voice drops to a growl. Evander snarls, ready to tear Alpha Dominic apart if he touched her.

She keeps her back to me, head bowed.

"Grant." Her whisper cracks. "I need your help."

She turns.

My breath catches.

###Chapter 0479

The moment I realized my date with Silas was canceled because he joined the rogue hunt, I decided to stay in and rest. The bite mark on my leg throbbed, and Dr. Whitmore said it would take at least two days to heal fully.

I couldn't deny the warmth in my chest when Gregory texted to check on me. Sleep had been restless—every time I shifted, pain shot through my leg. But waking up to his message made me smile. I never expected him to be this thoughtful.

"Yes, he is," Valeria murmured sleepily in my mind, stretching like a lazy cat.

After packing an overnight bag, I met my father downstairs. We grabbed coffee before hitting the road. The drive was long, so I dozed for the first few hours. When I woke, the scenery had shifted dramatically.

At the pack borders, my father announced our names, and the guards let us through. He drove with purpose, pulling up to an extravagant packhouse buzzing with activity. The moment I stepped out, a man—clearly the Alpha—emerged from the entrance. His gaze swept over me, lingering too long, before he turned to my father without a word.

"That was unsettling," Valeria muttered. I agreed. Not even a greeting.

My father guided me forward. "Alpha Dominic, good to see you again. This is my daughter, Ivy."

I shot him a look. Obviously, I was the only daughter he had.

Alpha Dominic extended his hand. When I reached to shake it, he instead lifted my fingers to his lips, kissing them for several seconds too long. His eyes never left mine, watching for my reaction. I forced a polite smile.

"Pleasure to meet you," I said, though every instinct screamed to step back. Something about him felt... off. No wonder he hadn’t found his mate—or maybe she’d rejected him.

"My omegas will take your things," he said, and two figures hurried forward to grab our bags. "I’ve arranged a private breakfast for us."

Inside, the packhouse was all dark wood, crimson drapes, and black furniture. Heavy. Oppressive. Like something out of a vampire’s lair.

He led us upstairs to a room overlooking the forest—or it would have, if the blinds weren’t drawn shut. Only slivers of light seeped through. Despite the bustling activity outside, the interior was eerily silent.

The omegas setting the table didn’t speak. A thick black tablecloth muffled the clink of plates. My father seemed unfazed by the grim atmosphere.

Once seated, the omegas served us and vanished.

"So, Ivy," Alpha Dominic began, "your father mentioned you’ll be eighteen soon."

I glanced at my father, who nodded for me to answer. "Yes, in a couple of months."

"May, correct?"

I nodded.

"Ah, Ivy of May. Fitting." He smirked. "Is that the origin of your name?"

I turned to my father, who was shoveling food into his mouth like a starving man. "No idea," he said between bites. "Your mother named you. Probably liked flowers."

Helpful.

"And are you still in school?" Dominic pressed.

"Senior year. I’ll graduate right after my birthday."

"Are you intelligent?"

The bluntness threw me. Most people asked about grades. "I’d like to think so."

"Good. I prefer clever women."

I focused on my plate, unsure how to respond.

"Your father says you’re training for the warrior trials."

"Yes. I plan to outperform most in my pack."

"Strength and intelligence." His smile widened. "Excellent qualities in a mate, don’t you agree?"

My stomach twisted. Valeria, please tell me he’s not considering us.

"Goddess, I hope not. He’s unsettling."

Before I could reply, my father stood abruptly. "Well, Alpha, I should attend to that matter we discussed. You two get acquainted."

"Wait—" I started to rise.

"Stay," he said, leaning in as if to hug me but instead whispering, "Don’t embarrass me."

Then he was gone.

###Chapter 0480

My stomach churns as I meet Alpha Dominic's gaze, the food turning to ash in my mouth. Every instinct screams that something is terribly wrong here.

After breakfast, he insists on showing me around the packhouse, including his private quarters. Disgusting. The room is as suffocatingly dark as the rest of this gaudy mansion. My blood runs cold when I realize he's placed me directly across the hall from his suite. That door will be bolted shut tonight.

The tour of pack lands is worse. His hands keep finding excuses to linger—pressing against my lower back to "guide" me, fingers trailing along my spine when he points at landmarks. My skin crawls. I want to sprint into the woods and never look back.

I learn he's ruled for fifteen years since losing his fated mate. Part of me wants to sympathize, but nothing explains the predatory way he watches me.

Finally, he deposits me at my room, claiming work demands his attention before dinner in two hours. I wait until his footsteps fade before slamming the lock home. Sunlight floods in as I wrench open the blinds. My phone feels like a lifeline as I text Grant, though I know he's hunting rogues with the warriors.

No reply comes.

The shower scalds away his touch, but sleep brings no relief. The screech of metal jolts me awake—Dominic picking my lock like some twisted fairytale villain.

"You've slept long enough, Ivy." He strides inside without invitation. "Dinner awaits."

I vault off the bed. "Just need to freshen up!"

He blocks my path to the bathroom. "Wear this first." From the closet, he produces a scandalous red satin number with black lace that wouldn't cover a handkerchief. The lingerie-esque atrocity matches this place's vulgar aesthetic.

"It'll complement your lovely hair," he murmurs, tangling his fingers in my locks. I suppress a shudder as his eyes darken with misplaced desire.

He actually expects me to change in front of him. Not happening. I slam the bathroom door, listening for any movement.

The dress fits like a second skin. I'm adjusting the precarious bodice when the door swings open—no knock. His hungry appraisal makes my flesh prickle.

"Exquisite. Now these." He produces towering stiletto platforms that bring me eye-level with him.

A limo waits outside. He crowds beside me, close enough to smell his cloying cologne. "You've noticed my wealth, I'm sure. I deal in fortunes and fantasies."

Whatever that means.

The restaurant reeks of old money. Valets bow as we approach. "Alpha," the maître d' greets with obsequious deference. "Your table is prepared."

###Chapter 0481

The guards lead us to a private dining area with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a shimmering lake. Tiny golden lights dance across the water's surface, creating an atmosphere that would be romantic—if I weren't trapped here with this insufferable Alpha.

Alpha Dominic doesn’t bother consulting me before ordering for both of us. The moment the waiter leaves, his piercing gaze locks onto me.

"What do you know about me, Ivy?"

"Only what you've shared today," I reply sweetly. And that you have the personality of a stale cracker. But I keep that thought to myself.

He reaches across the table and seizes my hands, his grip uncomfortably tight. "I'm searching for a mate—someone who can stand beside me, managing the packhouse affairs. I don’t need a powerful Luna, just a competent one who can bear my heirs."

Before I can react, he brings my fingers to his lips, sucking on my knuckles like they’re some kind of delicacy. I suppress the urge to gag.

"Your father believes we’d make an excellent match," he continues, his voice dripping with arrogance. "You’d want for nothing under my care. Young, fertile—perfect for producing strong heirs."

This time, I nearly choke on my own disgust.

I force a tight smile as the food arrives, yanking my hands free the second I can. Once the servers leave, I speak carefully. "Alpha Dominic, your offer is... generous. I’m honored you’d consider me." Honored? More like horrified.

"My dream has always been to find my fated mate," I lie smoothly. "I’m not yet of age to sense them, but I’d prefer to explore that possibility before settling for a chosen mate."

He scoffs, leaning forward with a condescending smirk. "Youth always clings to such fantasies. Let me enlighten you—many never find their fates, and many more are rejected. Why gamble when you could have certainty? Your father and I know what’s best for you."

My nails dig into my palms. Oh, now he’s really pissing me off.

The food might as well be ash in my mouth with how my stomach churns. "You’ve given me much to consider, Alpha. But as I’m underage, no decision can be made yet." And by the time I am, I’ll be long gone.

"Wise girl," he purrs, just as the waiter returns to offer dessert.

"No dessert," Dominic declares without glancing at me. "My future Luna must watch her figure."

Excuse me? I train harder than half his warriors. If he weren’t an Alpha, I’d challenge him right here.

Back in the limo, he slides too close, his hand creeping up my thigh. "Care for a test ride?"

I stiffen. Oh, he did not just say that. Andra snarls in my mind, ready to tear his arm off. "I’m not sure I follow," I say icily.

###Chapter 0482

"Stop pretending. You know exactly what I mean." His breath is hot against my skin as he leans closer, lips brushing my neck before trailing up to my ear. "I can't wait to take you for a spin."

I jerk back, pressing myself against the car door. "Actually, I'm saving myself... for my mating night." Telling him I'm waiting for my true mate won't matter. He's already made it clear he doesn't care.

His eyes flash with something dark and hungry. "You're untouched?" The words slither out, thick with desire, making my stomach twist.

I force myself to nod. "Yes." My voice cracks. Goddess, get me out of here.

His grin turns predatory. "This just got more interesting. Your birthday night will be unforgettable when I claim that first taste."

The car finally stops at the packhouse. I bolt out before he can touch me again. "I'm exhausted. It's been a long day, and I need time to process everything. Goodnight, Alpha."

I don't wait for a response. I sprint to my room, barely making it to the bathroom before I empty my stomach.

Valeria, please tell me we won’t accept him. For the first time since she came to me, my wolf stays silent. The loneliness is suffocating.

I grab my phone and see a message from Grant. Instantly, my racing heart slows.

It's late, but I need to know he’s coming tomorrow. Somehow, he sensed something was wrong with this visit. I want to tell him everything—see if he has a plan to reject this Alpha without starting a war.

He won’t be back until evening. He warns me not to tell my father. Like that’s an option—I haven’t seen him all day.

I lock my door, knowing it won’t stop Alpha Dominic. Sleep won’t come tonight.

I change into pajamas—thankful for the full set instead of a flimsy nightgown—then wrap myself in a blanket and perch on the windowsill. The clock ticks mercilessly.

At some point, the doorknob rattles softly. He doesn’t use his key.

Then, deep in the night, Valeria surges forward with a jolt.

Ivy, go to the bathroom.

What? Why?

Just do it.

I flick on the light. "What’s happening?"

Look in the mirror.

My hands fly to my mouth. Valeria, why are your eyes gold?

We’ve been blessed. I’m a Guardian now.

Panic claws up my throat. No one can know. Not Alpha Dominic, not anyone. You know what they do to female Guardians. We’d never leave this pack alive. Don’t even tell Alpha Patrick. Stay hidden in my mind until we’re home. No matter what happens, don’t come forward.

Agreed. But there’s someone who can help us.

Grant and Evander.

We need to get home first. I pull her back before she can argue.

At dawn, I dress quickly, pack my bag, and head downstairs for coffee. My father stumbles in, looking wrecked.

"Ivy, have you heard from Grant? Is he coming back today?"

"Yes. He said they’re on their way." It’s not a lie—just not the whole truth.

###Chapter 0483

His fingers rake through his hair in frustration. "Fine." The word comes out clipped, laced with irritation.

"Good morning." Alpha Dominic strides into the room, his presence commanding. He takes my hands in his, his grip firm. "How did you sleep, darling? I wanted to check on you, but you locked your door." The way he says 'check' makes my skin crawl—I know exactly what he intended.

"I slept well. But we need to leave now." My gaze flicks to my father, who stands rigidly nearby.

His entire posture shifts as he watches the exchange between Alpha Dominic and me. "So, we have an agreement?" he asks, eyes locked on the Alpha.

"Absolutely." Dominic's smile is smug. "I've made it clear to your daughter that she should heed the wisdom of those more experienced. Waiting for a fated mate is a fool's errand. Isn't that right, darling?"

I force a tight-lipped smile, my stomach churning.

"We should go," I say to my father, my voice strained.

Alpha Dominic escorts us to the car. Then, without warning, he yanks me against him, his mouth crashing onto mine, his tongue invading before I can react. I shove him away, my eyes darting to my father—who just climbs into the car without a word.

"Until next time, darling," Dominic murmurs, his smirk making my blood boil.

I scramble into the car, my hands shaking.

The moment we're off pack lands, I explode. "What the actual hell, Dad!"

"Watch your tone, Ivy."

"Like hell I will! You just sold me off to some Alpha like I'm property! That's illegal, in case you forgot!"

"You should be grateful. Alpha Dominic is wealthy, powerful. He can provide for you."

"I don't care about his money! He's twice my age and treats me like a broodmare. He doesn’t want a partner—he wants a servant and an heir factory!"

"You're being ungrateful. I secured you a position as Luna, and this is how you repay me?"

"If he's such a prize, why is he still single?" I snap.

"You will be his mate, Ivy. End of discussion."

I turn away, tears burning my eyes. I can't believe this is happening. I don’t want power or status—I want love. A real mate. Someone who sees me, not just my womb.

Silence fills the car for the rest of the drive.

When we get home, I don’t step inside. I grab my bag and bolt for the trees. My father shouts after me, but I don’t stop. The second I'm hidden by the forest, I shift. Valeria snatches my bag in her jaws, and we sprint to the training grounds—our sanctuary.

I stay there all morning, lost in the rhythm of combat drills, until Grant's message pulls me back.

I'm home.

Relief floods me. I shift back, hurrying to his room. My knocks are frantic.

The door swings open, and there he is—Grant. His smile falters the second he sees my face. I want to collapse into his arms, to let him tell me it’ll be okay. But first, he needs to see.

When he growls, demanding to know if Dominic hurt me, I nearly break. Instead, I whisper, "I need your help," before turning and letting Valeria rise to the surface.

His sharp inhale cuts through the air. For a heartbeat, he just stares. Then his arms wrap around me, and I finally let go—sobbing into his chest as the weight of everything crashes down.

###Chapter 0484

Ivy is a Guardian. The realization hits me like a freight train. If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t have believed it. The moment I pull her into my arms, she shatters. Something happened while I was gone—something bad. And I’m going to find out exactly what.

She sobs against my chest, her body trembling. I hold her tight, letting her cry until she’s exhausted. Then I scoop her up and carry her to the chair by the window. Settling her in my lap, I stroke her hair, waiting for the storm to pass.

That’s when she notices.

Her breath hitches. Her muscles lock. I’m only wearing a towel, and she’s sitting right on top of me.

I loosen my grip, letting her pull back. Gently, I wipe her tears away with my thumbs. "Better?"

She nods, sniffling. "I waited all day for you to come home. I didn’t know what else to do—"

"Shh." I press a kiss to her forehead. "I’m here now. We’ll figure this out together."

For the past day and a half, she’s been all I could think about. Now that she’s in my arms, I can’t stop touching her. Tucking a strand of hair behind her ear, I let my fingers trail down her cheek. She leans into my touch.

"Start from the beginning," I murmur.

Then she tells me.

About Alpha Dominic. About her father leaving her alone with him. About the expectation that she would become his.

Evander roars in my head, claws scraping against my skull, demanding blood.

We protect our mate first, I snap at him. Then we deal with that bastard Alpha.

"I’m scared, Grant," Ivy whispers. "If my father or Dominic finds out I’m a Guardian… they’ll try to take me."

"That won’t happen." My voice is steel. "But we need to talk to Alistair."

She stiffens. "What if he tries to force a mate bond?"

Evander snarls.

"He won’t," I say firmly. "First, he’s not that kind of Alpha. Second, he already has me as a Guardian. He doesn’t need another." I try to lighten the mood, but her fear is a living thing between us.

"You’re right about one thing—other Alphas will come for you. We need to confirm the previous Guardian’s death. Then we make a plan to keep you safe." I tilt her chin up, forcing her to meet my eyes. "Do you trust me?"

She nods.

"Then trust that Alistair will help."

I mind-link him immediately. Since we’re on the same floor, it takes less than a minute before the knock comes.

Ivy scrambles off my lap just as the door swings open. The towel does nothing to hide what her closeness did to me.

Alistair freezes. "Apologies. I should’ve waited for you to answer." He starts to retreat.

"Wait."

Ivy has turned away, her embarrassment a tangible thing. But beneath it, I feel her fear vibrating through our bond. Alistair must sense it too.

His gaze flicks between us. "Everything alright?"

"Close the door," I say, giving Ivy a moment. I move to her side, rubbing her arms. "You need to show him."

She looks at Alistair, then back at me. I nod.

When she turns again, Valeria surges forward.

Alistair’s sharp inhale mirrors my own reaction the first time I saw those golden eyes.

"You’re a Guardian," he breathes. Then his gaze snaps to me.

A beat of silence. Then—

"Shit."

"Yeah," I agree. "Shit."

He paces, raking a hand through his hair. "I need to confirm the previous Guardian’s death. Their pack is across the country, but we heard rumors of border disputes. I didn’t think it had escalated this far."

He stops abruptly, pointing at Ivy. "And we need to figure out what to do with you."

She flinches.

I growl.

Alistair meets my glare head-on. "One Guardian in this pack already made us a target. Two? They’ll hunt her down. They won’t care that she’s underage—they’ll want her power." He turns to Ivy. "You were always strong. Now, with Valeria? You’ll be unstoppable."

His voice softens. "What do you want, Ivy?"

She looks at me.

"There’s more," I tell Alistair. "That situation we discussed? It’s happening."

His eyes narrow. "Alpha Dominic wants to claim you as his chosen mate?"

Ivy’s startled nod is all the confirmation he needs.

"And how do you feel about that?" Alistair asks.

Evander bristles, but I keep my reaction in check.

"I don’t want him," Ivy says, her voice breaking. "But my father is forcing it."

I pull her against me, letting her borrow my strength.

Alistair exhales. "I’ll verify the Guardian’s status. But Grant—" He gives me a meaningful look. "We need my father involved. Tonight."

I nod. The second Ivy mentioned her father’s demands, I knew we’d need Patrick. With her being a Guardian and targeted by Dominic? There’s no other way.

"I’ll send food up. Then I’ll contact the other pack and arrange a meeting with my father." He turns to Ivy. "Where’s your father now?"

"Home, I think. I ran into the woods after we got back this morning. I couldn’t face him."

Alistair nods. As he turns to leave, he pauses. "Oh, and Grant?"

"Yeah?"

"Put some damn clothes on."

The door clicks shut behind him.

###Chapter 0485

My cheeks burn with humiliation knowing Alpha Alistair saw me perched in Gregory's lap, even though nothing inappropriate occurred. But my embarrassment pales in comparison to the dread coiling in my stomach. Now two Alphas know my secret. If only I knew where to flee.

Gregory's warm hands slide down my arms from behind, sensing my distress. He turns me to face him. "You told me you trusted me, didn't you?" His voice is steady.

"I do," I whisper.

"Then believe me when I say I'll protect you. Neither Alistair nor Patrick will force a mating bond on you." His thumb brushes my cheek. "Not that I think they would, but I want you to feel safe. That will never happen while I'm breathing."

He leans in, pressing his lips to my forehead. The proximity makes my pulse stutter. Heat radiates from his bare chest through my clothes. The scent of cinnamon and baked apples clings to his skin - warm, comforting, like coming home after a long journey. My mouth waters involuntarily.

When he steps back, the world tilts. "I'll get dressed. Make yourself comfortable." He gestures to the chair where our compromising position occurred, reigniting my blush.

With a playful wink, he grabs his clothes and disappears into the bathroom. The door clicks shut just as knocking echoes through the room.

The aroma of roasted meat hits me as I approach. Opening the door reveals Beth from the kitchens, balancing a tray while striking what she must think is a seductive pose.

"Oh, Ivy. I thought Alpha Alistair was dining with Gregory tonight." Her tone drips with implication.

"Not tonight." My response comes out distracted as I step aside.

She sets the food on a small dining table with practiced ease, clearly familiar with Gregory's quarters. As she turns to leave, her parting shot lands like a slap: "Guess you're just like the rest of us she-wolves after all."

Gregory emerges from the bathroom, his voice cutting through the tension. "Actually, Ivy is unlike any she-wolf I've met, Beth. Intelligent. Compassionate. Fiercely dedicated to her training in ways that put most warriors to shame." He moves beside me. "Pity more females don't share her discipline."

Beth's gaze drops. "Yes, Guardian."

"Dismissed." He shuts the door firmly behind her.

For a moment, he just stands there. Then: "Ivy, about what she said-"

"It's fine." I wave him off, turning toward the food though my appetite has vanished. "She's only voicing what everyone will whisper once this spreads."

His hands settle on my shoulders from behind. "Let them whisper. Everything I said was truth." He circles to face me. "You were extraordinary before the Guardian spirit chose you. Now? I can't wait to see what you become."

His fingers lift my chin. "These past weeks... you've challenged me in ways I never expected. The more I discover about you, the more fascinated I become."

Taking my hand, he guides me to the table. As we sit, his expression grows serious. "Unfortunately, I suspect I'll have to start sharing your time more generously now."

"What do you mean?"

He spears a piece of meat thoughtfully. "Patrick will want you protected. When Evander chose me at ten, he moved my entire family into the packhouse. Don't be surprised if he suggests the same for you." His jaw tightens. "Though given your father's situation, that might prove... complicated."

###Chapter 0486

His gaze drifts momentarily before snapping back to focus. He checks his watch with a sharp movement. "We're expected in Alpha Alistair's office with Beta Nathaniel in fifty minutes."

His eyes drop to my untouched plate. "Ivy? You should eat something." That intense stare pins me in place until I reluctantly pick up my fork and push food around.

"What if Alpha Alistair can't help? He's still my father at the end of the day," I whisper, my voice barely carrying across the table.

"Pack law supersedes parental rights when a pup's safety is compromised. Let's hear what Alpha Alistair proposes before we panic." His tone leaves no room for argument.

"'We'?" The word slips out before I can stop it.

"Obviously. You're stuck with me, Guardian." A rough chuckle escapes him. "Only two of our kind exist. That's a lifetime commitment whether you like it or not."

My traitorous heart skips at his words. Stupid reaction - he only means our Guardian bond. Nothing more. So why does the idea of being bound to Gregory Sinclair forever suddenly seem... appealing?

"Ivy?" His voice pulls me from dangerous thoughts. I realize I've been staring blankly at my plate. "Eat. We'll handle this."

Doubtful, but I force down a few bites to quiet my protesting stomach. Gregory watches like a hawk until I push the plate away.

When he finishes, we head to Alpha Alistair's office. The knock echoes ominously. Inside, the air crackles with tension - Alpha Alistair, Beta Nathaniel, and Gamma Donovan all waiting.

"Gregory. Ivy." Alpha Alistair gestures to seats at the oval table. "My son shared both promising and concerning news. First, I need confirmation about Valeria."

I glance at Gregory before letting my wolf forward. Alpha Alistair nods solemnly. "Congratulations, Valeria, though celebrations must wait. You understand the danger of an unmated underage Guardian?"

"Yes, Alpha." My voice sounds steadier than I feel.

"We'll implement every protection possible. But there's another matter." His gaze darkens. "Alpha Dominic. I understand your father took you to visit him this weekend?"

"We left yesterday morning, returned today." My fingers twist in my lap.

"Walk us through everything that happened with Alpha Dominic."

I recount the events mechanically. Alpha Alistair interrupts twice - when my father left me alone with Dominic, and when the Alpha entered my room unannounced. Describing my father's disheveled state this morning makes my throat tighten.

"Did Alpha Dominic make any... physical advances?" Alpha Alistair's question drops like a stone.

Heat floods my face. I'd hoped to avoid this humiliation. Gregory's fists clench audibly beside me.

I stare at the table. "He asked if I wanted to 'take him for a test ride.'"

Gregory's snarl shakes the room. When I dare look up, murder burns in his eyes as he glares at Alpha Alistair.

"Control yourself, Gregory," Alpha Alistair warns sharply. "Or you'll wait outside."

###Chapter 0487

He turns to face me again. "Forgive the personal nature of these questions. I must grasp Alpha Dominic's intentions—and your father's. So, tell me. Did you accept Alpha Dominic's... proposal?"

Disgust coils in my stomach. "No. I told him I was saving myself for my mating night. Mentioning my fated mate seemed pointless—he'd already mocked that as childish fantasy."

Beta Calvin leans forward. "Did you fear he'd force himself on you without a valid reason to stop?"

My shoulders lift slightly. "Who knows? He'd already declared me his future Luna, ignoring my protests. My father was nowhere in sight, and we were alone in the back of that limo."

"You felt unsafe?" Alpha Alistair clarifies.

"Terrified."

"Was that the only incident?" Alpha Patrick presses.

"He tried my door at midnight. I didn't sleep, terrified he'd enter while I was vulnerable. Then this morning, he called me 'darling' and kissed me before we left."

Grant surges to his feet, pacing behind me like a caged predator. Alpha Patrick shoots him a warning glance before refocusing on me.

"This kiss—unwanted, I assume?"

"Completely."

"And your father's reaction?"

"He just slid into the car like it was normal."

A fragmented memory surfaces—one that still baffles me.

"My dad said something strange when he saw Dominic holding my hands. 'So we have a deal?' No idea what that meant."

Alpha Patrick exhales sharply, rubbing his jaw. "Unfortunately, I might. But first—when did Valeria manifest as your Guardian?"

"Past midnight. She'd been silent for hours, then—this electric surge through my veins. She guided me to the bathroom and revealed her true form."

Alpha Alistair's gaze flicks to Grant. "Your experience?"

Grant drops back into his seat, muscles taut. "Evander came to me already bonded to his Guardian. The power surge could've been his awakening or the Guardian bond itself."

Alpha Patrick returns to me. "Do they know you're a Guardian?"

"No. The second I realized, I ordered Valeria to stay hidden. If Dominic found out..." My voice cracks. "He'd never let me leave."

Alpha Patrick's smile is almost fatherly. "Grant said you were clever. As usual, his judgment proves sound."

I glance at Grant. His smile doesn't reach his stormy eyes as he grips my hand. "You should've told me."

"I couldn't. You were too far."

"Distance means nothing, Evelyn." His thumb brushes my knuckles. "If you need me, I'll tear through hell itself to reach you."

###Chapter 0488

Evander is roaring inside my skull with such intensity that the voices around me sound muffled. The sole reason he hasn't forced the shift is Alpha Alistair's threat to remove us from the room. I refuse to leave Ivy, not after learning the full story and discovering Alpha Dominic laid hands on what belongs to me.

It stings that she didn't trust me enough to confide in me sooner. The only consolation is that she waited for my return and came straight to me, certain I'd protect her.

I turn to Alistair. "What's our next move? Ivy's in danger not just from Alpha Dominic, but from any Alpha who discovers she's a Guardian."

He addresses Ivy directly. "Do you believe your father can keep you safe? Do you trust him to consider your feelings regarding a mate?"

I watch Ivy's internal struggle. She wants to believe in her father's protection, but his recent betrayal has shattered that trust.

"No," she whispers. My fingers tighten around hers. She meets my gaze before looking back at Alistair. "I don't understand why, but he's fixated on making me accept Alpha Dominic as my chosen mate."

"Ivy, do you know Alpha Dominic's profession?" Seraphina asks.

She shakes her head. "When I asked, he said something about dealing in luck and dreams. It made no sense."

"He owns casinos and underground gambling rings," Seraphina clarifies.

Ivy's brow furrows. "Then what business does my father have with him?" My mate is sharp but sheltered.

Nathaniel frowns at his phone, having been texting throughout our discussion.

"Your father has amassed significant gambling debts with Alpha Dominic," Alistair reveals.

Ivy's eyes shut. "So he's selling me to settle his debts." It's not a question—just confirmation of her worst suspicion.

"Appears so," Alistair confirms.

A bitter laugh escapes her. "What's my price tag?"

"Our intel suggests over a hundred thousand." Her shock is palpable. She had no idea her father gambled, let alone to this extent.

"Actually," Nathaniel interjects. "I just verified with my contact." His eyes dart to me before landing on Ivy. "Your father's debt doubled this weekend. He now owes nearly a quarter million."

A single tear tracks down her cheek. "At least I'm worth a small fortune," she quavers.

I'm before her in a flash, Evander snarling at our mate's pain. "Hey." I brush away her tear, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. "This is brutal, I know. But you're not facing it alone. I meant every word—you're stuck with me for life, Ivy. I'm not going anywhere, and I won't let your father sell you to Dominic or anyone else." Rising, I lock eyes with Alpha Alistair.

"I assume you concur, Alpha." I deliberately use his title, emphasizing my lethal seriousness. Ivy cannot remain in danger under her father's guardianship. The moment he learns she's a Guardian, he'll auction her off.

"As we've established," Alistair states, stressing the word, "I don't permit pack members to be sold or abused, Guardian." His tone warns me to stand down—to tread carefully and cease challenging his authority.

###Chapter 0489

"Ivy." Alistair's voice cuts through the tension in the room. "How would you feel about moving out of your parents' home and into the packhouse?"

She glances around at everyone before answering. I sit beside her, taking her hand in mine. "What about my parents? Especially my mother. I don't think she has any idea what my father's been planning."

"I'll confront your father personally. I'll inform him that I'm taking over as your guardian until you turn eighteen. Your mother can choose to stay with him or move here with you. Your father won't be allowed near you without my permission. As for his punishment—for trying to sell you to cover his gambling debts—that's between him and me."

Ivy nods, considering his words. "I want to move into the packhouse. Before becoming a Guardian, I might have hesitated, but now... I can't trust him anymore." She hesitates. "My mother won't leave him. Does that matter?"

Nathaniel smiles reassuringly. "No. Like I said, I'll be your legal guardian. You'll have a room on Beta Lucian's floor so he can keep an eye on you." He says this to Ivy, but his gaze flicks to me. The message is clear—stay out of her room, stay out of her bed.

She's made it obvious she's waiting for her mate. And since that's me, she's essentially saving herself for me. I give Nathaniel a firm nod of understanding.

"I'll speak to your parents tonight, Ivy. Tomorrow, you can gather your things, or I can send someone to do it for you."

"I'll need clothes for school tomorrow. Maybe my mother can pack a bag for me?"

"I'll make sure of it. For now, follow Beta Lucian. He'll show you to your room." She stands, ready to leave. "Oh, and Ivy—now that you're a Guardian, Donovan will oversee your training. I don't know why this pack has two Guardians, but I want you both in top condition. If trouble's coming, we'll be ready."

"Yes, Alpha." She follows Lucian out.

I rise to leave as well. "Grant." Nathaniel stops me.

"I know she's your mate. I know you're a Guardian, and you're like a son to me. But don't challenge me again."

I meet his gaze. "Keep her safe, and we won't have a problem, Alpha."

Adrian steps up behind me, resting a hand on my shoulder. "Grant, I get it. You and Evander are furious about what her father tried to do. And I can only imagine how angry you both are about Alpha Dominic's proposition. But you know my father. He always protects this pack—and that includes Ivy. Let him handle it."

Adrian has always been the voice of reason for me. "You're right." I turn back to Nathaniel. "My apologies, Alpha."

"Apology accepted, Grant. And stop calling me Alpha—you know it irritates me." His gruff tone makes me smirk.

"Yes, sir." I turn to find Ivy.

"And Grant." I pause, glancing back. "If I catch Ivy in your room or you in hers after hours, you'll answer to me. She's under my care now, and I'll treat her like my own daughter."

"Understood, Nathaniel." I leave with a lighter heart, reassured about Ivy's safety.


###Chapter 0490

Beta Gregory leads me to a guest room on his floor.

The space is elegant but impersonal. I perch on the edge of the bed, feeling utterly displaced. Nothing here belongs to me—no clothes, no belongings, not even a toothbrush. The weight of my situation crashes over me. My own father tried to sell me to an Alpha to settle his debts. The betrayal leaves me hollow, adrift in fear.

What will Father do when Alpha Sebastian confronts him? Rage, certainly. He’ll twist this into my fault, accuse me of ingratitude. And Mother? She obeys him without question. She’s always been kind, but never defiant. Now, torn between protecting me and submitting to her mate, I know which bond will win. Will she resent me for whatever punishment Father faces?

My chest tightens as panic spirals. Tears threaten when a knock interrupts.

The door swings open, and the scent of cinnamon and cedar floods in—Grant.

He doesn’t speak, just opens his arms. I crash into him. His embrace is steady, his lips brushing my hair before he murmurs, "Come here." He guides me inside.

"Door stays open, Grant," Beta Gregory warns from the hall.

A low growl rumbles in Grant’s chest, pulling a shaky laugh from me.

His fingers tuck a loose strand behind my ear. His gaze sweeps the barren room, understanding flickering—there’s nothing to distract me here except my thoughts.

"Want to run?" he asks.

"Yes." Desperately.

We slip out the back stairs, avoiding any chance encounters. Outside, we strip and shift. Valeria surges forward, elated to reunite with Evander. They race through the trees, not training but reveling in freedom. Evander lets Valeria lead, eventually steering us to a cliff overlooking the gorge.

The distant glow of human towns and the Nightshade Pack’s lights shimmer below. The full moon bathes everything in silver.

How are you holding up, Ivy? Grant’s voice filters through our link. Valeria curls against Evander, who rests his muzzle protectively over her, scanning the woods.

I don’t know, I admit. Terrified. Lost. If not for you and Evander, I’d be completely alone.

His response is firm. You’re not. And you never will be again.

Silence lingers before he adds, Since Sebastian put me in charge of your training, I’m moving us away from the warriors. No distractions. No… him.

I exhale. I’d love that. Will Alpha Sebastian agree?

I’ll talk to him tonight. He knows I don’t slack off. Might require progress checks, but that’s fine.

Thank the Moon for my wolf form hiding my blush. The gossip will explode—me in the packhouse, training alone with Grant. Let them whisper. They don’t know the truth.

It’s late, Grant says, standing. Time to head back.

We race home, shift, and dress.

Then—

"You treacherous little whore!"

I freeze. Father steps from the shadows like a specter. "After all I’ve done for you—"

Grant shields me instantly. "Back off, Aaron."

"Like hell!" Father spits Grant’s title like venom. "She’s my blood."

"You forfeited that right when you auctioned her off," Grant snarls.

"A misunderstanding," Father insists. "Once it’s cleared, she’s coming home."

My stomach churns. Lies.

"By then," Grant mocks, "she’ll be an adult. Until that day, Alpha Sebastian is her guardian. Take your complaints to him."

He hooks an arm around me, steering us inside while blocking Father’s path.

The parting strike comes as we cross the threshold: "Your mother wept because of you, Ivy."

The blow lands perfectly. I never wanted to hurt her.

Grant shoves the door shut and whirls on him. "You did this. Not her. Own it."

He escorts me to my room. "I’m sorry. I’ll talk to Sebastian."

I shake my head, tears brimming. "Don’t apologize. I just… need to be alone."

"Text me anytime." His thumb grazes my cheek. "I’ll check on you later."

The door closes.

Then I shatter.

###Chapter 0491

The door clicks shut behind Ivy, but not before I catch the sound of her muffled sobs. My hands curl into fists at my sides. I storm down the hallway, my boots pounding against the hardwood as I hunt for Gregory.

He's in his office. I don't bother knocking.

The Alpha glances up from his paperwork, then leans back in his chair, fingers steepled. "Grant. What's the problem?"

I don't sit. Can't. Not with this fire burning through my veins. "Took Ivy out for a run tonight. Thought she needed air after everything." I pause, waiting for some sarcastic remark, but he just watches me, silent.

"Her father ambushed us when we got back."

That gets a reaction. Gregory straightens, forearms braced on the desk. "Where?"

"Right outside the packhouse. Called her names. Blamed her for everything. Then had the nerve to claim it was all a misunderstanding—said she'd be moving back home soon." My jaw locks. "Thought you were handling him. Not letting him terrorize her with lies."

A heavy sigh. "Sit down, Grant."

"I'm fine standing."

"Wasn't asking." His Alpha tone brooks no argument.

I drop into the chair, muscles coiled.

Gregory scrubs a hand over his face. "Didn't expect Seraphina Raines to break down in my office, begging on her knees for mercy for her mate. I granted it for her sake."

That... wasn't what I anticipated. Never met Ivy's mother, but I assumed she'd be as strong as her daughter. Clearly, Ivy forged her own strength.

Another reason our mate is extraordinary. Evander murmurs in my mind.

"So what now?" My voice is rough. "He gets to harass her whenever he wants?"

"Of course not. He'll spend tonight in the cells for that stunt. Banned from leaving pack lands. And I'll issue an Alpha command—he doesn't go near Ivy without my direct permission."

Good. He wouldn't be able to disobey that.

"Did she get her things for school tomorrow?"

"They're in her room. Her mother wanted to see her—that's how I realized you'd taken her out."

My gaze drifts to the window behind Gregory's desk. "She looked... shattered."

He gives me a moment before prompting, "Anything else?"

"Yeah. I want to train Ivy and Valeria separately from the warriors. Especially now. Don't need distractions after what happened."

Gregory studies me long enough to make most wolves squirm. But Guardians don't fidget. I meet his stare head-on.

"Demonstrations every other day. And Grant? I expect rapid progress."

A smirk tugs at my lips. "Already knew you'd say that."

When I leave, I head straight back to Ivy's room. Pressing my ear to the door, I hear quiet sniffles. As I turn to leave, I find Benedict leaning against his doorframe, arms crossed.

"Grant?" One eyebrow arches.

"Checking on her. We ran into her father earlier." I keep my voice low, glancing at her closed door. "She's still upset."

His arms drop as he steps closer. "What kind of run-in?"

I relay the encounter. His lips press into a thin line. "Worried Seraphina cared more about her mate's punishment than he did. You talked to Gregory?"

After I summarize our conversation, Benedict nods. "The Alpha command will keep him away. But I'll keep an eye on her too."

"Appreciate it." I move to step past him when a chuckle stops me.

"Don't. The more I watch her, the harder it'll be for you to sneak around."

His grin fades as he sobers. "She's strong, Grant. But even the strongest need someone at their back."

I nod once. That, I already knew.

###Chapter 0492

I spin around to face him. "She's my mate. I won't do anything to hurt her or keep us apart. And when she's ready to accept our bond, she'll be mine." Evander's deep growl vibrates through me, reinforcing my words.

He shakes his head and retreats into his room without another word.

Back in my own space, I grab the guitar and pull up an online tutorial. My fingers fumble over the chords for an hour before I finally set it aside and reach for my phone.

Me: How are you holding up, Ivy?

Mate: I'm okay. Thanks for asking.

Me: Need anything? Warm milk? Cookies? Maybe some soap?

I grin, hoping to tease a smile out of her.

Mate: Are you saying I smell bad?

Good. She's playing along.

Me: Not at all. I love how you smell. Just making sure you're taken care of.

Mate: What do I smell like to you?

Me: Like vanilla and cinnamon.

Mate: And that's... good?

Me: Perfect.

Mate: Has anyone ever told you you're strange?

Me: Strange in a good way or bad way?

Mate: So far, good.

Me: Try to get some rest, Ivy. Patrick approved our training session. Tomorrow morning, I own your time.

Mate: Looking forward to it.

Me: Sleep well. But if you need me, just text.

I wait, but no reply comes. After a quick shower, I climb into bed, leaving my phone volume up just in case. My last thought before drifting off is of her.

A ping jolts me awake in the dead of night. I've always been a light sleeper. The screen lights up with her name.

Mate: Are you awake?

I knew she'd struggle to sleep. Instead of texting back, I pull on sweatpants and a hoodie, then slip out my window.

Her blinds rustle when I tap lightly on the glass. Her eyes widen as she yanks the window open. "What are you doing here?" she whispers.

"You texted. I wanted to see you."

"You didn't have to climb up here." She glances down at the three-story drop, biting her lip.

"Trouble sleeping?" I brush my thumb under her eye, tracing the faint shadows.

She shakes her head.

"Come on." I offer my hand.

"Where?"

"Trust me."

After a heartbeat, her fingers curl around mine. I help her out, and we shuffle carefully along the ledge until the roof slopes upward. Once we reach the flat section, I grab the blanket I keep stashed here and spread it out.

"How many girls have you brought up here, Grant?" Her voice is tight.

I cup her face, forcing her to meet my gaze. "Just you, Ivy. This is my escape. No one else comes here."

I guide her down, tapping my chest. She hesitates before resting her head against me. Evander rumbles contentedly.

She laughs softly. "Evander, you're such a flirt."

"He can't help it. You're special to both of us."

I feel her exhale against me as I thread my fingers through her hair. Above us, the stars glitter. Evander's purring vibrates through my chest, and soon, her breathing evens out.

When I'm sure she's asleep, I let myself drift off too, her warmth anchoring me.

###Chapter 0493

A sudden jolt shakes me from peaceful slumber.

"Evelyn, wake up. We need to get you back to your room before sunrise."

My eyes fly open. The rooftop. Gregory. I'd texted him in the middle of the night when sleep refused to come. He'd brought me up here, and just as I was about to storm off, he'd whispered that no one else had ever seen this secret spot. Then exhaustion won. With Evander's rumbling purr and Gregory's fingers tracing patterns through my hair, resistance was impossible.

Gregory stands, offering his hand. "Now, Evelyn. Before the warriors start morning drills."

"What time is it?" I scramble off the blanket as he folds it with military precision.

"Dawn's close. We overslept." He slides down the sloped roof, then signals for silence—one finger pressed to his lips. His grip steadies me as we creep along the ledge. My window squeaks when he pushes it open.

"Fifteen minutes. Meet me downstairs," he murmurs as bootsteps echo from the training yard below. I nod, shutting the pane just as a gruff voice shouts orders.

I'm a whirlwind—jeans, sweater, teeth brushed, hair yanked into a ponytail. The stairs creak under my hurried steps when Gregory materializes behind me.

"Morning, Evelyn. Sleep well?" His grin is all innocence, as if we hadn't been tangled together minutes ago.

"Eventually. Once I crashed, it was... solid." My cheeks warm.

"Patrick's got the warriors running drills, so we're hitting the obstacle course."

For ninety relentless minutes, he pushes me harder than ever. My punches land faster. My sprints leave dust swirling. When he gestures toward a ten-foot gap between platforms, my stomach drops.

Valeria could clear that blindfolded. Me? I've face-planted trying to jump puddles.

Gregory demonstrates—the coiled spring of his thighs, the explosive push-off. After a dozen attempts, I'm matching his distance.

"Good. Now you're starting to feel your Guardian strength." He helps me down the cargo net. "We'll keep testing your limits."

Alpha Alistair waits at the base, arms crossed. "Impressive display, Evelyn. Gregory wasn't holding back."

I wipe sweat from my brow. "It's... exhilarating. I'm stronger every day."

"Glad to hear it." His gaze flicks to Gregory. "Did he mention I'll be evaluating your progress regularly?"

Gregory had hinted, but the confirmation tightens my throat. "What exactly would that involve?"

Alistair's smile is all teeth. "Sparring. With me or Nathaniel."

Gregory chuckles at my deer-in-headlights expression. "Relax. We'll train this afternoon—you won't be unprepared."

Alistair blocks our path. "One more thing, Evelyn." His stare makes Gregory step closer, his palm a steady weight between my shoulder blades.

"Gregory told me about your father's visit last night."

The memory hits like a sucker punch. My nod is jerky. Gregory's fingers press harder, silent solidarity against the storm inside me.

###Chapter 0494

"I need you to understand how deeply Theron regrets his actions." His voice carried the weight of authority. "I never intended to issue an Alpha command to keep him away from you, but since he refused to listen, I had no choice. If he ever approaches you again, I expect you to inform me immediately, Ivy."

"Yes, Alpha. Thank you."

"Given the circumstances, I'm sending someone to collect your belongings from your parents' house today. Everything will be waiting in your room when you return from school." He paused. "Did you receive the clothing and essentials we left for you yesterday?"

"I did. Thank you." Relief washed over me at the thought of avoiding another confrontation with my father. My mother's silence spoke volumes—if she hadn't reached out by now, she likely never would.

"If you require anything at all, don't hesitate to ask me or Luna Seraphina."

We entered the dining hall for breakfast before preparing for school. Grant checked his watch. "Meet us back here in forty-five minutes?"

I blinked in confusion. Why would I need to meet him?

He arched a brow. "You're riding to school with me and Alistair. We'll pick up Seraphina on the way."

My stomach lurched. "Oh goddess. Sera. She doesn't know anything about what's happened." The thought of explaining everything to my best friend made my breakfast churn dangerously.

Grant's hands settled on my shoulders, steadying me. "She's your closest friend. She'll stand by you no matter what."

I nodded, then surprised us both by hugging him tightly. Even if his kindness stemmed from my new Guardian status, he'd been my anchor through this nightmare. "Thank you, Grant. I never expected you to become such an important person in my life."

His chuckle rumbled against me. "Told you, you're stuck with me now, little bud. Whatever you need, I'm here."

"Right now, I need a shower." The mischievous glint in his eyes made me roll mine. "Alone, Grant. Very much alone."

"Your loss," he teased as I turned toward my room. His laughter followed me up the stairs.

Forty-three minutes later (because I refused to be late), I joined Grant and Alistair in the foyer. When we pulled up to Seraphina's house, Grant actually opened the car door for her—a first.

"Sit with Ivy today," he suggested, proving he understood I needed my best friend's comfort more than ever.

Seraphina's gaze darted between the three of us. "What's going on? Why are you already in the car?"

I swallowed hard, praying for her support. "I moved into the pack house yesterday."

Her fingers tightened around mine. "What? Why?"

I glanced at Alistair watching us in the rearview mirror, acutely aware of Grant listening. "I'm about to tell you something almost no one knows, Sera. This stays between us."

"You know I'd never betray your trust." Hurt laced her words—she couldn't understand why the others knew before her.

"Remember when I left with my father this weekend?"

"You were supposed to be home yesterday. I guess this explains why I didn't see you."

"Not exactly." My throat constricted. "My father's trying to force a mating bond between me and Alpha Dominic. He's drowning in gambling debts and sees me as his payment method."

Seraphina crushed me against her in a protective embrace before I finished speaking. "Goddess, Ivy. What can I do?"

I clung to her. "This. Just this."

###Chapter 0495

I knew Seraphina would stand by Ivy, but hearing it out loud still warmed my heart. As much as I crave being Ivy's first choice when she's troubled, we're not there yet. She needs her childhood best friend right now.

The car rolled into the school parking lot when Seraphina asked, "So Alpha Sebastian knows everything. But who's legally responsible for you? You're still underage."

"Alpha Sebastian became my guardian. My mother could've stayed with me, but I wanted her with my father."

Seraphina slung an arm around Ivy as we exited the vehicle. "Guess I'll be doing homework at the packhouse then."

I watched them walk toward the school entrance, Seraphina's protective grip never loosening. Alistair and I fell into step behind them like twin bodyguards. Whatever expression we wore must've been effective—nobody dared approach.

At the lockers, Ivy and Seraphina were still whispering, though Ivy's shoulders had lost some tension. Alistair closed his locker beside me. "She'd make an incredible Luna, don't you think?"

My growl erupted before I could stop it. I whirled on my friend, ready to throw punches if necessary. Ivy had specifically worried about forced mate bonds, and here he was fueling those fears.

To his credit, Alistair didn't flinch. "I meant Seraphina, obviously."

The tension drained from my muscles. "Yeah, she would." My gaze followed the girls heading to class. "She handled that situation perfectly."

Ivy glanced back at me then. I gave her an encouraging nod. We'd see each other in chemistry soon. Hopefully the rest of her day would go smoothly.

"She'll be fine," Alistair said with unusual conviction. We started walking toward our classes. "You really believe she's your mate, don't you?"

His eyes never left Seraphina. "Magnus has never reacted this way to anyone before. It's like he wants to bare his throat to her."

I snorted. "Evander's the same with Ivy and Valeria. He'd move mountains to see them happy."

'Because she's our mate. No sacrifice is too great,' Evander murmured in my mind.

Chemistry class proved far more productive today. Working alongside Ivy felt effortless—our experiment succeeded where others failed miserably. Something had shifted between us. Maybe it was newfound trust, or perhaps our shared Guardian bond made her more comfortable around me. If this was a preview of our future as mates, we'd be unstoppable together.

Literature remained my Achilles' heel, but I'd improve. With Seraphina joining our study sessions at the packhouse, Alistair and I would tag along. More time with them, plus the chance to debate these so-called classics Ivy adored. The books weren't terrible—someone clearly considered them masterpieces—but they'd never mattered to me before. Now they did, because they mattered to her.

"When are you telling Seraphina the rest?" I asked as we headed to our lockers after school.

Ivy shrugged. "Not sure. I already dropped one bombshell today. Don't want to overload her."

"If it helps, I think she was hurt you waited so long to confide in her. She's tougher than people realize."

"Of course she is," Ivy defended instantly. "I just..."

I stopped walking, forcing her to meet my gaze. "You just what?"

"What if knowing endangers her? Maybe ignorance is safer."

"Want my advice?"

She nodded.

"If you trust her, tell her everything."

We resumed walking. "Did you tell Alistair immediately?"

"Instantly. I was ten, he was my best friend, and I was thrilled it meant we'd never be separated."

Another nod. "I'll tell her."

After dropping Seraphina home with promises of a study session later, I gave Ivy thirty minutes to prepare for training. With warriors using the obstacle course, I led her toward the forest for privacy—fewer witnesses to her Guardian abilities.

"Offense or defense today?"

"Offense."

I assumed a defensive stance. Her initial attacks mirrored last week's strength. After several minutes of her holding back, I escalated the intensity, forcing her into defensive maneuvers.

When she hit the ground, I offered a hand up. "You're fighting like your old self. You're stronger now. Again."

The second round showed improvement, but frustration lined her face after another takedown.

"My turn to attack. Stop overthinking—let Valeria's power flow through you."

Her defensive stance wavered as I launched my hardest assault yet—Alpha-level intensity. Then it happened: gold flashed in her eyes as her reflexes sharpened. Block after block, her speed matched mine perfectly. When she finally landed a counterstrike, I called it.

"Nice!" We both gasped for air, hands on knees.

I met her gaze. "Feel the difference?"

Her nod sent satisfaction through me.

"Good. That's the strength you need against Sebastian, Nathaniel, and Alistair." I guided her back toward the packhouse. Time for food, then homework with our mates-to-be.

###Chapter 0496

Dinner felt surreal.

Normally, I ate at my parents' house. But Gregory insisted I join him and Alistair at the packhouse tonight. Which meant I was now seated at the ranked wolves' table. If anyone hadn’t noticed my move to the packhouse before, they definitely would now.

The moment I sat, Luna Penelope and Beta Beatrice turned toward me. "Ivy, darling," Luna Penelope began, "how are you settling into your room? Do you need anything?"

"Alpha Sebastian had my belongings delivered earlier," I replied. "I haven’t checked everything yet, but I should be fine. Thank you."

"If you need anything, let me or Beatrice know. Her room is closer if it's urgent."

"Thank you both. I don’t want to cause any trouble."

Beta Beatrice leaned in, whispering just loud enough for us to hear. "Honestly, it’s refreshing to have another she-wolf at this table. Too much testosterone otherwise." I stifled a laugh. Their kindness was unexpected but welcome.

"What’s so amusing down there?" Alpha Sebastian’s voice cut through our quiet moment. Of course, he’d notice—especially when his mate was involved.

Luna Penelope smiled. "Just discussing how lovely it is to have Ivy join us tonight." She winked at me, and I quickly focused on my plate to hide my grin.

Conversation resumed, but when I glanced up, Gregory was watching me. He smirked before taking another bite.

"Sebastian," Gregory announced, "Alistair and I are joining Ivy and Seraphina for their study session tonight. We’ll use the small meeting room."

Silence fell over the table.

"You two… are studying with Ivy and Seraphina?" Sebastian repeated slowly, as if the words didn’t make sense. Every pair of eyes locked onto Gregory and Alistair.

Alistair shrugged. "Ivy and Seraphina always study together. Now that Ivy’s here, Seraphina will be coming to the packhouse. We figured we’d join them. So, the meeting room, Dad?"

Beta Leopold narrowed his eyes. "And what, exactly, will you be studying?"

"Literature," Gregory said smoothly.

"Anatomy and physiology," Alistair added.

Their expressions were so convincingly innocent that I almost believed them. Around the table, the others looked torn between disbelief and exasperation.

"Door stays open," Sebastian finally said before returning to his meal.

Alistair rolled his eyes. "Obviously. What did you think we were going to do?"

Then it hit me—what everyone had assumed. My face burned.

Luna Penelope turned back to me. "You’re close with Seraphina, aren’t you?"

"Yes, ma’am. We’ve been best friends since we were kids."

"I don’t know her well. Tell me about her."

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Alistair tense.

"She’s brilliant," I said. "Kind, loyal—unlike me, she doesn’t want to be a warrior. She’s training to be a doctor."

"She sounds wonderful," Beta Beatrice remarked.

"She is."

Luna Penelope exchanged a glance with Beta Beatrice. "We should invite her to dinner tomorrow." She smiled at me. "Would she like that?"

"I think so. I’ll ask her when she comes tonight."

Alistair looked increasingly uncomfortable, while Gregory was clearly fighting a laugh.

Beta Beatrice nodded. "Introduce us when she arrives. We’ll extend the invitation ourselves."

"Of course. That’ll make her more comfortable about coming."

Alistair exhaled sharply, and Gregory’s smirk widened.

This was going to be interesting.

###Chapter 0497

After finishing dinner, I retreat to my room for a quick shower and change of clothes before Seraphina arrives. I gather my study materials and head downstairs just as she steps through the packhouse doors.

"Hey, Sera."

"Evelyn!" We embrace like we haven't seen each other in weeks, though it's only been hours.

"Did your parents mention anything about you coming here tonight?" I ask.

She shakes her head. "No. They saw the warrior Alpha Gregory sent to your house for your belongings, but they haven't spoken to your parents at all."

"What did you tell them?"

"That you're staying at the packhouse now, but I didn't know the details."

"Thanks. Listen, Luna Penelope and Beta Beatrice want to meet you. They've invited you to dinner here tomorrow night."

"Me? Why?"

I shrug. "No idea. Maybe so I won't feel so out of place." I lower my voice. "Sitting at the ranked table was... awkward."

We're giggling when we turn the corner and nearly collide with Luna Penelope.

"Luna Penelope, this is my best friend, Seraphina Grey."

"Oh, Seraphina." The Luna takes both her hands. "You're absolutely stunning. We'd love for you to join us for dinner tomorrow. I'm happy to speak with your parents if needed."

I watch Sera's cheeks flush the same way mine did earlier. "I'm sure they won't mind, Luna. Thank you for inviting me."

"Before you study—" Luna Penelope turns, "Beatrice!"

Beta Beatrice emerges from another room, her face lighting up. "Is this Seraphina?"

"Yes, isn't she lovely?"

"Absolutely breathtaking. It's wonderful to meet you. You'll be joining us tomorrow evening?"

"Y-yes, Beta."

"Perfect. We'll have more time to chat then. Enjoy your studies."

As we walk away, Sera grips my arm. "What just happened?"

"Your guess is as good as mine."

The study session proves interesting. When we arrive, Donovan and Alistair have arranged separate tables—forcing us to split up.

"Why don't we combine the tables?" I suggest.

Alistair answers too quickly. "We set it up this way to focus on our shared classes without distractions. Sera, you can work with me on the anatomy exam."

I shoot her a look before we separate.

"Did you tell her?" Donovan's voice echoes in my mind, asking if I've revealed my Guardian status. I shake my head subtly.

Studying with Donovan surprises me. When he actually applies himself, his intelligence rivals his physical prowess. While I appreciate a sculpted physique as much as any she-wolf, a sharp mind excites me more. Maybe because muscles can be built with dedication, but intellect is harder to fake. I find myself anticipating tomorrow's session.

As we finish, I notice Sera packing up. "I'll walk you home," Alistair offers.

"That's not necessary," she replies.

He places his hand over hers, waiting until she meets his gaze. "Maybe not, but I'll sleep better knowing you're safe." He holds eye contact until she nods.

"Now's your chance," Donovan murmurs, giving me a look that says the choice is mine.

I exhale. "Before you go, Sera, there's something you should see."

I close the study room door—against protocol, but necessary. When I turn, Sera's frowning. "Evelyn?"

"There's another reason I'm living here now. Something even fewer people know about."

Her eyes dart between Donovan and Alistair before settling on me. "Okay."

I let Valeria surface, my eyes shifting to gold.

Sera's hands fly to her mouth. "Moon Goddess," she breathes.

"You're a Guardian."

###Chapter 0498

Ivy takes a deep breath, glancing between Seraphina and me. "So this is the reason. This explains all the time you've been spending together."

"Exactly." Ivy confirms with a nod.

I step closer to Ivy, positioning myself protectively beside her. "I'll be training Ivy and ensuring her safety. But you understand what this means, Seraphina, especially considering what we know about her father."

Her gaze shifts from me to Ivy, concern flashing in her eyes. "You must have been absolutely petrified this entire weekend."

Ivy moves toward Seraphina just as the door bursts open. Instinctively, I shield her—Valeria's glow still visible in her eyes.

"I thought I made it clear that doors stay open." Alpha Alistair's voice cuts through the room as he enters.

"My apologies, Alpha. It's my fault." Ivy says without turning around. "I needed to show Seraphina something private." She finally faces him, revealing Valeria's presence.

Alistair swiftly closes the door behind him. "Seraphina, this is highly sensitive information. If it gets out, Ivy could be in grave danger. What you've witnessed here stays within these walls." His Alpha tone leaves no room for argument.

"Seraphina knows how to keep secrets, Dad. She's loyal—she'd never betray Ivy." Adrian jumps in immediately, defending her.

Alistair scans the room, his expression unreadable. "I strongly advise keeping this conversation confined to those present. At least until I've established proper safeguards for Ivy once this becomes public knowledge."

"Can't we just keep it hidden until she turns eighteen? It's only a couple of months away." Seraphina suggests.

"It's not that simple." I interject. "When we train, Valeria surfaces. It's not something we can suppress easily. Our wolves are fighters—their strength manifests through us, often visible in our eyes."

"Well, count me in. Whatever you need, I've got your back." Seraphina pulls Ivy into a tight embrace. "You're my best friend. I love you. Just say the word."

"Thanks, Sera. Love you too." Ivy murmurs, returning the hug.

"I'm walking Seraphina home, Dad. I'll come find you when I get back." Adrian grabs her bag, slinging it over his shoulder.



I gather Ivy's books, stacking them with mine before guiding her out. I nod at Alistair as we pass. "See you tomorrow, Sera." Ivy calls over her shoulder as we head upstairs.

At her door, I hand her the books and wait while she unlocks it. I scan her room quickly, ensuring everything's secure. "Text me if you can't sleep tonight."

She sets her books down and returns to the doorway. "Thanks, Grant. Really—I appreciate everything."

I'm just leaning in when a deliberate throat-clearing interrupts us. "It's past curfew, Grant." Calvin's voice rings out from behind me.

I glance over my shoulder. He's leaning against his doorframe, arms crossed—same as last night. "Just escorting Ivy back from our study session, Calvin." I roll my eyes at Ivy, earning a quiet giggle.

"Goodnight, Ivy." I say before retreating to my room.

Guitar in hand, I'm still practicing when Adrian strolls in and collapses onto the chair. "That sounds like a cat being strangled."

"How would you know what that sounds like?" I ask, continuing to play.

"Because I've been subjected to this torture nightly for weeks!"

I strum another chord. "How was the walk?" I already know he's been itching for alone time with Seraphina.

A slow grin spreads across his face. "Perfect."

Another chord. "Did she finally agree to go out with you?"

"Not yet. But she did admit she enjoys studying with me more than she expected."

I snort. "So she thought you were just another muscle-headed Alpha until she discovered you actually have a brain?"

"Her exact words were, 'It's refreshing to see you use the head above your shoulders almost as much as the one below.'"

I burst out laughing. "I like her more every day."

"What about you? You walked Ivy to her room."



"Yeah, and got cockblocked by Calvin again. That bastard knows exactly what he's doing. Starting to think he's got the hallway under surveillance."

"At least Mom didn't scare Seraphina off with that painfully obvious dinner invitation."

"Ugh, could she have been any less subtle?" Adrian groans. "Honestly, I'm shocked Ivy didn't pick up on it."

###Chapter 0499

"Keep in mind, she hasn't bonded with your parents like we have. I just hope Seraphina and Ivy don't scare Evelyn away tomorrow. I think she'd enjoy joining us for dinner more often now that she's staying here."

I placed the guitar down. "Are you seriously planning to serenade her with that thing?" Alistair raised an eyebrow.

"Absolutely. Found the perfect song—just need more practice and the right moment."

"How do we convince them to go to Prom with us?"

"That, my friend, is the million-dollar question."

After Alistair retreated to his room, I showered and climbed into bed, making sure my phone volume was maxed out. The notification came at 12:30 sharp.

Mate: You up?

Perfect. I grabbed a thick blanket, tossed it onto the roof, and slipped through her window. She was already waiting, perched beside the open frame.

"Expecting me?" I whispered, settling on the windowsill.

A shy smile curled her lips. "Maybe."

"Come on." I took her hand, helping her close the window before leading her to the roof.

The extra blankets were already spread out. "Thought you might want to stargaze again. Made it cozier." I gestured for her to join me, draping another blanket over us as she nestled against my chest.

"Why'd you start coming up here? The view's incredible, but you mentioned it was an escape." Her fingers absently traced circles over my heart.

She glanced up. "You don’t have to answer if it’s too personal."

I kissed her forehead. "Ask me anything, Ivy." My gaze drifted to the stars. "Found this spot after my parents died. Struggled hard—lost my whole family. Alistair and his parents are family, but..."

"It’s not the same," she finished softly.

"Yeah." I studied her, savoring her touch. "How’d you cope? I might never fix things with my parents, and I’m an only child."

My hand moved in slow circles on her back. "Time. It’s the brutal, simple answer. Time to grieve, to adjust. But having people who care? That helps."

Silence settled between us, broken only by Evander’s purring. Her sigh signaled she’d drifted off.

She loves my purr, Evander preened.

It soothes her.

Andra’s responding too.

"Hope we’ll be up here often. Purr away," I murmured, lacing my fingers through hers before sleep took me.

Wake up! Evander’s shout jolted me.

Dawn light streaked the sky. Damn, even on a roof, I slept better with her beside me.

"Ivy, time to go." I kissed her knuckles, rousing her.

She blinked up. "We did it again?"

"Yep. Let’s get you back before anyone notices."

We folded the blankets and crept to her window. After scanning her room, I helped her inside.

"Ivy." She turned, and I stole a quick kiss. The second our lips met, hunger roared—but not now. Pulling back, I grinned at her dazed expression. "See you downstairs in fifteen."

A wink, and I left her staring as I vanished into the morning shadows.

###Chapter 0500

His lips met mine.

I stood frozen as Evander retreated from my window. My fingertips rose to brush against my tingling lips. That single electrifying contact had sent shockwaves through my entire body. Even now, the sensation lingered like static dancing across my skin.

Shaking myself from the daze, I hurriedly changed for training. My pulse raced at the thought of facing Gregory again. Yet when we crossed paths on the staircase, he acted as if nothing had happened between us - no rooftop intimacy, no stolen kiss.

I'd debated texting him last night but ultimately sent the message. Alone in bed, my mind had spiraled with thoughts of my father, my absent mother, and what might have happened if Alpha Dominic had discovered my Guardian secret. Evander's comforting purrs had eventually lulled me to sleep, leaving me surprisingly refreshed.

"Today we're training in wolf form," Gregory announced as we entered the forest. "Your human strength enhances your wolf, but Valeria hasn't properly tested her limits since bonding with the Guardian spirit. Evander will push her today." He turned to my wolf. "Ready?"

Valeria stepped forward eagerly. "I'm prepared."

Evander moved beside her. "You're stronger than you know. Trust me - I'll never ask more than you can give. Let the Guardian power flow through you."

For ninety intense minutes, Evander challenged Valeria beyond anything she'd attempted before. Leaps and maneuvers that once felt impossible now came effortlessly. When we finished, Evander nuzzled against Valeria before affectionately licking her muzzle.

After shifting back and dressing, Gregory nodded approvingly. "Excellent work. Valeria, how did that feel?"

"Liberating," she admitted. "You were right - I'm capable of far more than I imagined."

"We'll continue these sessions," Gregory decided. "Ivy, you used to train Valeria each evening?"

"Yes, after regular training."

"Then we'll extend our afternoon sessions for wolf-form practice instead of sparring," Gregory said as we entered the dining hall.

Whispers and hostile glares followed us inside. Normally I'd ignore the petty drama, but with everything else weighing on me, I couldn't muster the energy to deal with jealous pack females.

Grabbing a plate, I told Gregory, "I'll eat in my room and get ready for school."

His frown deepened. "Because of them?"

My gaze darted across the room. "No, I just need extra time this morning." The lie tasted bitter on my tongue.

Gregory scanned the hall and growled low in his throat. The sound instantly silenced the room. "Stay. Ignore them." When I hesitated, he leaned closer. "You'll have to face this eventually. From now on, we're training and eating together twice daily."

He was right, and I knew it. With a resigned sigh, I nodded.

"And if anyone bothers you-"

"I can handle myself," I interrupted.

"But you don't have to," he countered softly. "Not anymore."

The school day passed uneventfully. When we dropped Seraphina off, she caught my arm. "I've got an idea - we'll talk at dinner."

"Sounds good," I agreed.

As Gregory and I headed toward the training grounds, Beta Calvin blocked our path. "Today's show and tell day, Ivy."
