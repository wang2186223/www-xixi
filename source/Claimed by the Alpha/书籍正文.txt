###Chapter 0001
Athena

“Where the hell is she?” Beta Marcus’s furious shout echoes through the halls. I already know he’s referring to me, the only servant in this entire house. I let out a quiet groan and push myself up, grabbing the cleaning basket as I go.

The moment Beta Marcus spots me, he storms over. His hand strikes my cheek with brutal force. I don’t make a sound. Years of conditioning have taught me to stay silent unless spoken to—even when it hurts.

“Alpha Dominic and I are expecting an important guest, and you still haven’t cleaned the office like you were ordered.” He spits the words at me.

I nod, my grip tightening around the cleaning basket. For a second, I imagine swinging it at his head. The thought alone lifts my mood. But I resist. He’s stronger than me, and I can’t afford another week locked up without food. My stomach already aches with emptiness.

“We’re trying to make a good impression on Alpha Alexander. Do you even understand how crucial this alliance is for our pack?!”

I stay quiet. It’s a trap—anything I say will give him an excuse to punish me. I keep my gaze lowered, refusing to meet his eyes.

Alpha Alexander. I’ve only heard rumors about him. Whispers among pack members when they thought I wasn’t listening. From what I gathered, he’s ruthless. A wolf feared by many. He leads the largest pack in the world and doesn’t tolerate fools.

“He’s the Alpha of Obsidian Howl. The strongest pack there is. We need him!” Beta Marcus continues, though he doesn’t explain why.

We’ve never been attacked. We’ve never attacked others. So why do we need another pack’s protection?

He digs his nails into my shoulders, his grip bruising my thin skin. He spins me around and shoves me toward the office, kicking me hard as I stumble forward. “Worthless fucking wolf,” he mutters as he walks away.

I close the door quietly and lean against it, scanning the office. It’s already clean. Nothing is out of place. It’s more than ready for a meeting with some powerful Alpha.

I slide down to the floor, closing my eyes. I hate this house. I thought when I turned eighteen, I’d finally escape. But four years later, I’m still here. A slave in my own home. Doing every dirty task for my brother, Alpha Dominic, and this pack. While my ex-mate, Beta Marcus, parades around, reminding me how useless I am.

Someone clears their throat.

I freeze. I thought I was alone.

I lean forward slowly and see a man sitting in a chair just around the corner. One foot propped on his knee, he holds a glass of amber liquid. His hair is dark, his eyes a deep, unsettling crimson. They shift toward me.

I scramble back against the door, heart hammering.

“Is this how you greet all Alphas?” His voice is deep, rumbling through the room. There’s a hint of amusement in his tone.

“I’m sorry,” I whisper, getting to my feet. “I… thought I was alone.” I have no idea who he is, but power radiates from him. Even without my wolf, I can feel it.

“Come here.” It’s an order. A lump forms in my throat. Alpha Dominic will kill me for this.

I step around the corner, doing as I’m told. I let him see me fully. I close my eyes, bracing for the worst.

“You smell strange. Yet you’re a wolf, aren’t you?”

I nod, though I have no idea how he’ll react. Most people laugh when they find out about me.

“I prefer verbal responses,” he growls. “I’m not in the mood for games.”

“Yes,” I whisper. My mind races through all the punishments waiting for me. A whipping? Another week of starvation?

“Why do you smell like that? And how did you not sense me in the room? You should have scented me the moment you walked in.”

“I…” I hate this question.

“Spit it out. I don’t have all day.” He takes a slow drink.

I know why I couldn’t scent him. I know why I didn’t sense his presence. But explaining it is something I never want to do. People never let me finish. They just laugh. They mock.

“You should open your eyes when speaking to someone. It’s rude not to look at them. Has your Alpha taught you nothing?” His voice sends a shiver through me.

Slowly, I open my eyes but keep them lowered. No way am I making eye contact. “My wolf abilities were bound,” I mutter. Twice, I want to add. But he probably doesn’t care.

He leans forward, placing his glass carefully on the side table. I feel his stare burning into me. “Why would someone do that?”

If this is the Alpha my brother is meeting, I could ruin everything by saying too much. “It was a punishment,” I whisper. It’s not the whole truth, but it’s the simplest answer.

There’s a twitch in his cheek. Is he angry? Or amused, like the others? I can’t tell.

The door swings open. My brother screeches, “Athena, what the hell are you doing in my office?!” He turns to the crimson-eyed man. “I apologize deeply, Alpha Alexander. My sister is bothersome.”

Crap. It’s him.

My brother spins, his hand rising to strike me. I close my eyes, bracing for the impact.

“I wouldn’t do that if I were you.” Alpha Alexander’s voice rumbles through the room.

I peek through my eyelids. Alpha Alexander is on his feet, his hand wrapped around my brother’s wrist. He’s taller. More muscular.

“Athena,” he says, my name rolling off his tongue, “was kindly showing me to your office, Alpha Dominic. Since you failed to meet me at the front as requested. Luckily, someone here understands the importance of this deal.”

What? I have no idea what he’s talking about. And he has no reason to lie for me.

My brother glares, jaw clenched tight. I’ll pay for this later. I’ll have to try to steal some food tonight.

“Go get Beta Marcus,” Alpha Dominic seethes. “Tell him our guest has arrived.”

I nod and hurry out. The last thing I want is to be caught between arguing Alphas.

“Beta Marcus,” I whisper as I enter the dining hall. His dark eyes snap to me. I spoke without permission. “Alpha Dominic is in the office with Alpha Alexander. I was sent to inform you.”

He slams his newspaper down and glares as he passes. “You’re lucky the Alpha sent you. Otherwise, you wouldn’t see sunlight for days.”

He pauses behind me, yanking my head back by my hair. His fingers dig in. He leans close, his hot breath on my neck. He doesn’t speak. It’s his way of reminding me he owns me.

I try to stay busy, keeping far from the office. But my peace doesn’t last. My brother calls for me again.

Quietly, I pad toward the office and force a smile as I open the door.

“Athena, bring champagne and glasses. We’re celebrating.”

I bow my head and hurry to the drinks cabinet. I find what he asked for quickly. As I re-enter, I feel Alpha Alexander watching my every move. The hairs on my neck stand up. No one ever watches me this closely.

I approach the table by his chair and start filling the glasses. He takes the bottle from me. “I can pour my own,” he says.

My cheeks flush. Not from embarrassment, but dread. I’ll be punished for this. I should’ve been faster. I should’ve filled the glasses before entering. I should’ve—

My thoughts freeze when I see my brother glaring. He’s furious.

“Athena is your sister, correct?” Alpha Alexander questions.

“She is,” Alpha Dominic mutters with disgust. He looks away from me, focusing on the other Alpha.

“Why do you treat her like shit?” Straight to the point. My brother won’t like that.

No one has ever challenged my brother about how he treats me. Everyone enjoys beating me. I don’t know what to do. I can’t move, but I know I need to leave. If this deal falls apart because of me, it’ll be my fault.

“Athena was responsible for our parents’ death,” Alpha Dominic spits.

I close my eyes, fighting back tears.

“Responsible how?” Alpha Alexander’s voice rumbles through me. He sounds angry.

“She served them Wolfsbane.”
###Chapter 0002

Athena, stay silent. Not a single sound.

I felt Alpha Alexander's gaze burning into me. Everyone stared. No one could comprehend how someone would commit such a horrific act—poisoning their own parents. My head remained lowered, wishing the floor would crack open and devour me whole.

Movement stirred around me. He stood directly before me. A calloused finger lifted my chin, forcing my eyes to meet his. His hand closed around my throat, but he didn't apply pressure. “You poisoned your parents?”

“I was six,” I choked out. “I only made them lemonade.” My voice came out strained and weak as I tried to explain. My parents were a blur, but the guilt they forced on me since that day remained sharp and clear.

His crimson eyes shifted to my brothers. “Blaming a six-year-old seems unjust.”

“A six-year-old should know which plants are safe,” Alpha Dominic snapped.

“Seems to me like she was framed,” Alpha Alexander shrugged, releasing my throat. “We all know common wolfsbane doesn’t affect us anymore. Our kind evolved past that poison centuries ago.”

What? What did he mean? Wolfsbane wasn’t deadly. That had been drilled into me since childhood.

“Which only leaves Wolfsbane Toxin,” Alpha Alexander muttered.

“You weren’t there, Alpha Alexander,” my brother growled through clenched teeth, his eyes narrowing. “It was wolfsbane.”

He gave a slow nod. “You are correct. I was not present.”

Perfect. Now another person could remind me of a childhood mistake.

“But answer this—where would a six-year-old get Wolfsbane Toxin?”

“I didn’t invite you here to discuss my slave!” Alpha Dominic spat. “Or my parents’ deaths."

Alpha Alexander grabbed his leather jacket from the chair. Unlike other alphas, he dressed simply—a black tee and jeans covering his muscular frame. No tattoos marked his skin; not a single trace of ink anywhere.

“You’re right. Now I have matters to consider.”

“I thought we had an agreement,” my brother protested.

“Nothing is signed. I’ll see myself out.”

The moment he left the office, both my brother and Beta Marcus turned on me. “What did you say to him?” my brother demanded, striking my stomach.

“N-nothing. He only asked why I smelled unusual.”

“Did you tell him?” Beta Marcus snarled, spraying spit in my face. I despised him. I vowed someday to make him pay.

“WELL?” my brother shouted when I didn’t answer immediately, slapping the side of my head.

I nodded involuntarily. “But I didn’t say it was you.” I tried to sound firm, but it came out a whisper. If they weren’t wolves, they might not have heard.

My brother seized my black hair, yanking my head back. Pain shot through my skull. “If you ruined this, you’ll never see daylight again.”

He dragged me by my hair out of the office and down the hall toward the basement. “Please…” I begged. “He was an alpha… I had to answer.” Tears scorched my cheeks as he flung the door open.

Alpha Alexander stood on the other side, leaning against the wall with folded arms, watching us. My brother released my hair, easing the pressure on my skull.

“Alpha Alexander, I thought you left,” Alpha Dominic said through gritted teeth.

“I said I’d show myself out. I found a basement instead, saturated with your sister’s strange scent. Is this how you treat family?”

“As I said,” my brother stood his ground, “she killed my parents. This is what she deserves.”

“You should stay out of other packs’ affairs!” Beta Marcus added.

Alpha Alexander laughed. “If I agree to this deal, everything about your pack becomes my business. So tell me, what’s her punishment? No food? Locked up for a week? Beatings?”

“We don’t—”

“Really?” He raised a brow. “You expect me to believe you’d just let her sleep? I already stopped you from hitting her once.” His eyes scanned me. “She’s underfed. Dark circles shadow her tired blue eyes. For an alpha’s sister, she’s not treated like one. Regardless of what she allegedly did as a child.”

“She did do it!” Alpha Dominic seethed. “And she has nothing to do with our deal.”

“That’s for me to decide.” His crimson eyes scanned the hallway. “Where’s your mate? I’d like to know how she feels about this.” I closed my eyes, silently pleading my brother wouldn’t call his Luna. Luna Victoria was worse than Beta Marcus and Alpha Dominic combined.

“On second thought, don’t bother her. I’m sure she’s just as vile as you.” He sneered.

I peeked through my eyelids to find his crimson eyes fixed on me. He had no reason to defend me, yet he did. I was a nobody. A traitor. Instead of a death sentence, my brother chose to make me suffer for life.

“I have a proposition, Alpha Dominic.” Alpha Alexander smirked at my brother.

“We already agreed on terms.”

“I’m adding one. If you refuse, you won’t get my help. Instead, you’ll become my enemy. And we both know you don’t want that.”

“I assume your new terms involve her?” Alpha Dominic muttered through clenched teeth.

“Correct. Let me take her to my pack. Then we have a deal.”

Me? Why would he want me?

As my brother and his beta discussed me, Alpha Alexander kept studying me. His intense stare made me nervous. What could someone like him want with me?

“Deal.” Alpha Dominic extended his hand. Alpha Alexander ignored it. His crimson eyes moved from me to my brother.

“I’ll have paperwork drawn up and return tomorrow.” He cupped my face. “Make sure you pack everything.” He dragged his thumb across my bottom lip and strode down the hall to the front door. He knew exactly where it was—so what was he really doing?

He paused at the door. “If I find out any of you laid a hand on her, the contract will be the least of your worries.” He walked out, slamming the door behind him.

“Get out of my sight!” my brother snapped at me.

I hurried upstairs to my tiny bedroom. It was nearly empty—just a few changes of clothes. Packing would take less than a minute.

By morning, I hadn’t slept. Alpha Alexander’s questions replayed in my mind. Why was I interesting to a wolf like him? His pack was the largest, known for their fighting skills. That’s why my brother wanted to ally Silver Creek with Alpha Alexander’s pack. But where did I fit in? And what was Wolfsbane Toxin?

Luc

Indy let Amy lead her through the crumbling hallways. I stayed close, ready to pull Indy away if anything shifted. Amy’s soul was shattered. I knew she was helping, but I still didn’t trust her.

Cracks and holes riddled what remained of her soul. She was broken beyond repair—the worst I’d seen in years. That she was still alive was impressive, but Athena taught me that Harrison blood was strong. No matter how close to the edge she got, she always found her way back. But that was Athena.

It didn’t make Amy trustworthy.

Amy hummed to herself as she shuffled down another hallway, oblivious to our desperation to escape this hellhole.

She stopped. Indy watched her, wide-eyed. “We need to keep moving,” Indy whispered, urging her forward.

“Baby girl, we’re here,” Amy murmured, smiling at a stone wall. She released Indy’s hand and dragged her thin fingers across the wall, searching for something.

“Secret door,” Theodore muttered to the white Wolf. “Like the other one.”

Amy’s humming grew louder as she crouched. Her fingers traced the grooves between stones, as if counting.

She pressed a stone. It sank into the wall with a click. A ridge appeared, outlining a door. Stone ground against stone as it slid open. Amy laughed softly as she stood. She spun, focusing solely on Indy. “Your home, baby girl.”

Theodore glanced at me. I shrugged. Amy believed Indy was Evelyn, though she’d given Evelyn up at birth. Did Amy not remember her daughter’s eye color?

I knew Charlotte’s mother would have recognized our daughters. I’d watched my first mate memorize every detail of our little girl. If only she could see her now.

Or maybe Amy was too far gone. Unlike Athena, she couldn’t find her way back. Trapped between life and death.

Indy slipped through the narrow door first. Amy followed, humming again.

“Guys, you need to see this!” Indy called out.

One by one, we squeezed through the narrow door into a tighter passage. My shoulders brushed both walls as I shuffled forward. I pushed through hanging clothes and stumbled into a bright bedroom. Indy spun around, amazed, taking it all in. It was airy and spacious compared to her home.

“This is beautiful!” she chirped.

High ceilings. Colorful stained glass windows covered the walls. I hadn’t seen this from the outside. A hidden part of the castle, perhaps by design. Who knew how Serkan and Thalia operated?

The room clearly hadn’t been used in years. Cobwebs filled every corner. Dust coated every surface. It made sense if this was Amy’s room.

“Is this your room?” Theodore asked Amy as Orion barricaded the main door with furniture.

Amy patted her chest and smiled at Theodore. “Mine.”

In this light, her skin had a grayish tint. She squinted as sunlight hit her face. Years trapped deep in the castle would do that to anyone. “Does Thalia know about this passage?” I asked.

“Witch!” Amy snapped, curling her lip in anger.

Indy took Amy’s hands. “We know. Does she know about the secret entrance?”

Amy cupped Indy’s face. “No.” She pulled Indy close. “Baby girl, leave. You have to leave. She will kill you all.”

“It’s okay.” Indy smiled and gestured to us. “My friends will help.”

I moved to the windows to determine our position in the castle.

The sea crashed against the rocks below with violent force. Dangerous, yet mesmerizing. Hannah would love it.

“We’re at the back of the castle,” I mumbled to Theodore. “The only advantage is the Witch can’t send her minions around to attack us.” I glanced at Xavi, still focused entirely on Indy. He needed to stop.

“There has to be a way out,” Theodore frowned, “or a way to lure Thalia away from the others.”

“You’re the Witch Hunter.” I tutted.

He rolled his eyes. “Xavi has been hunting Witches longer than I have, and look what she did to him.”

“Well, what does he suggest? All he wants is to kill Indy and slaughter Thalia. That doesn’t help.”

“He won’t kill Indy.” He muttered.

“You guarantee that?”

“No, but he won’t hurt her if I ask him not to.”

Xavi approached us. He sat, wrapping his tail around his feet. His amber eyes fixed on me.

“What’s the asshole saying?” I knew he was communicating. He liked me as much as I liked him.

“He agrees not to attack her unless she does something that endangers the rest of us.”

“Does it not count that she’s already tried to help?” I challenged.

Theodore sighed and rolled his eyes. “Witches only act for themselves.” He hated being the messenger.

I looked over at Indy and Amy. Indy pulled out clothes for Amy. Amy smiled and clapped like a child. Years locked up had destroyed her.

Indy glared at us, holding up a finger and swirling it. We turned away, giving Amy privacy to change.

“Does that look like she’s acting for herself?” I snapped at Xavi. “She could have let me drown or let the river take me over the cliff, but she didn’t. She tried to stop you from going up the tower. Every chance she’s had, she’s helped. She’s answered questions. She provided a hideout, food, and water.” I paused, looking at my hand. I’d never defended anyone this much. Blood ties were strong. “Can’t you give her a break?”

“That’s why he hasn’t acted.” Theodore smiled. “I told him you see more than most.”

“I want it to stay that way.” I turned back to Xavi. “You may kill Witches for a living, and we know how rare they are, but I’ve put more bullets in creatures than you’ve had hot dinners. I’m watching you.” Theodore sighed and shook his head. “He says he’s watching you too.”

“Good. At least we understand each other.”

“When you’re done arguing about me,” Indy tutted, “you can turn around. Amy says there’s another way out.”

“Where?”

She took a deep breath. “We have to jump.”
###Chapter 0003
Luc

I raise an eyebrow at her. "Did you see the rocks down there?"

"Yes." She turns to Orion, who stands by another window. "That's what she claimed. The tide isn't normally this low and..."

"If our timing isn't perfect, we die regardless." I click my tongue in disapproval.

"I realize how insane her plan sounds." Her eyes widen as she stares at me. "But do we truly have alternatives? The entire castle is surrounded by Silver Streams Pack members. I don't know what Thalia might convince them to do, and I'd rather not find out. We all understand that walking out the front door means certain death."

"If we allow her to live..."

"She makes a valid point," Theodore interrupts. "Any exit that leads to land will leave us vastly outnumbered. You said so yourself, Luc." He moves to the window and cautiously opens it. The roar of crashing waves fills the chamber. I notice the faint spark of recognition in Amelia's eyes at the sound. It was familiar to her, something she'd heard constantly while sleeping in this room.

"If we survive this, we could return to Obsidian Howl." Theodore continues, "We'd have numbers on our side. Athena is there. We have the Lycans and Wolves. We could devise a better strategy than hiding in this castle, waiting to die."

"If we pursue that option, would Orion and I be welcomed?" Indy asks softly. "I understand we're not from your pack. I don't know what it takes to become part of it. I just..." Her voice trails off as she glances at Orion. "We want a home. And that's where Julian is."

That wasn't a question I could answer. The decision wasn't mine to make, and I couldn't promise that Alexander or Athena would permit her to stay simply because I vouched for her. Theodore also hesitates to respond after the whole Jasmine situation.

Jasmine. I hadn't thought about her in some time. She claimed to be from Silver Streams, though she didn't know Julian. How was that possible, given Julian's position within the pack?

"What's that expression?" Indy asks. "Do you believe we won't be permitted to stay?"

"We can address that later," Theodore tells her.

"Different line of thinking," I murmur when she continues staring at me.

"Just say it! Athena won't want us there, will she?"

I lock eyes with her golden ones. She had similar eyes to Jasmine, but that was their only common feature. Surely they couldn't be another set of secret siblings? "Jasmine." Indy frowns. "It's Indy!" she snaps, tapping her chest. "Are you deliberately trying to provoke me?"

"No," I scowl. "There was another young woman named Jasmine who claimed to be from Silver Streams." The only truth she ever told, confirmed only by Zachary's rejection.

"I don't know any Jasmine." Indy turns to Orion, who shakes his head. "Are you certain?"

I nod.

"But no one ever escapes unless they're permitted to leave. No one. You've witnessed it. Orion and I have attempted countless times. You must be mistaken."

"Jump, jump, jump," Amelia mutters to herself.

"She didn't know Julian, but she was definitely from Silver Streams," I confirm.

"Everyone here knows Julian." Indy releases a heavy sigh. "If only he remembered everyone." "Levi held her captive. He told her stories about an Alpha Julian." Theodore mutters.

Indy snorts. "Julian is about as Alpha as my little finger. Don't misunderstand—sometimes you can sense power around him, but that was never his ambition. You must be wrong about this Jasmine person."

"She jumped. She jumped. Big waves." Amelia sings to herself while fiddling with trinkets on a shelf.

"Amelia," Theodore captures her attention. "Did you know a Jasmine?"

She smiles and nods. "Trapped and escaped." She points toward the windows. "I said jump."

If Jasmine had been imprisoned like Amelia, it would explain her strange behavior. She should have told us—she might still be alive today. Being held captive by Thalia and Serkan would also clarify why she didn't know Julian. Perhaps that's why she was with Levi. He got lucky when she appeared nearby, but being his prisoner was preferable to being with the Witches.

“Tenth bride’s the charm.” Julian mocked as the limousine halted before Silver Creek’s packhouse.

“Shut your mouth!” Sebastian snapped.

“Both of you, silence. Now.” Alexander’s voice cut through the tension. “Before you utter something unforgivable.”

‘He never learns.’ Titan, his wolf, grumbled internally.

The driver opened the door. “A moment. I need to speak with my men.” The door shut, sealing them in heavy silence.

“She’s different. Don’t address her. Don’t even look at her. And Julian—keep your hands to yourself. Or you’ll lose them.”

Alexander felt unusually unsettled. Athena wasn’t like the others. He couldn’t pinpoint why. Perhaps it was her lack of the arrogance he was accustomed to. But something about her called to him. Titan approved, more than he ever had with anyone else. He had to claim her.

“I mean it.” Alexander glared at Julian’s smug expression. “Being my brother won’t save you.”

Julian mimed zipping his lips shut.

They exited the vehicle. The three of them stood before the decaying packhouse, staring up at its imposing facade. Until a month ago, Alexander knew nothing of this pack. His single visit taught him one thing: Alpha Dominic was a fool.

His knuckles rapped sharply on the heavy door. It creaked open an inch before he shoved his way inside, forcing Beta Marcus to stumble back.

He spotted her immediately. Huddled behind a corner. “Are you ready?” he called out.

“If you’d like to—” Marcus began.

“I wasn’t speaking to you. I was addressing Athena.”

Beta Marcus’s face was a mask of shock. His jaw hung slack, eyes wide. Clearly, he was unused to being commanded, even by his own Alpha.

Athena emerged from her hiding spot. She clutched a nearly empty bag. Her teeth worried her bottom lip before she gave a slight nod.

“Where is the rest? I said pack everything.”

“That’s all she owns.” Dominic snorted, appearing from the shadows.

“This is it?” Alexander’s gaze swept over him. “These are her possessions? She’s in her twenties. This is all?”

“What more could she possibly need?” His Beta sneered.

Kill him. Let me tear out his throat. He’ll regret crossing us.

“What is the holdup?” A shrill voice echoed through the hall.

Alexander turned. A woman clung to a garish statue of herself at the foot of the stairs. Blonde waves framed her face. Her green eyes assessed him coldly as she swayed toward Dominic.

He’d seen Athena’s reaction yesterday when he asked about Dominic’s mate. Fear had radiated from her. She was terrified of this woman. He intended to discover why.

“Take her, Alpha Alexander. I’m sure she’ll be as useful a slave to you as she was here.” Her voice grated on his nerves. “Look at the stupid girl. She’s about to faint.” The blonde laughed cruelly.

“You will not speak of her that way again.” Alexander’s glare was icy. “She is not your toy. She is not your slave. Alpha Dominic, control your mate. My tolerance for disobedience is limited.”

“Disobedience!” the woman shrieked just as Athena collapsed to the floor. “How dare you! The only disobedient one here is that rat in the corner!”

Who does she think she’s calling a rat?

“Familiarize yourself with our agreement.” Alexander’s tone was sharp. “It seems your mate has been kept in the dark.”

He gestured to Sebastian, who produced a thick contract from a folder.

“All that for your help?” Dominic’s mate gasped.

“I don’t deal in half-measures.” Alexander took the contract and thrust it against Dominic’s chest. “Shall we proceed to the office?”

Dominic led the way, his mate clinging to his arm, Beta Marcus trailing. His men followed. Alexander stayed behind with his new mate.

“You may join us. You are part of this arrangement. Or wait in my car. Your choice.”

“Are those my only options?” she whispered, eyes downcast.

“For now. I suggest you join. I’d enjoy watching that woman’s frustration.”

Her blue eyes remained lowered, fingers tight around her bag. This close, her poor health was evident. Her heartbeat was faint, a struggling rhythm.

“Your decision?”

“I…” Her gaze flickered between the door and the office. “The office.”

“Wise choice.” He offered his hand. She ignored it, pushing herself up unsteadily.

He followed a step behind, noting the hostile glares from Dominic and the others as she entered the office.

“Sit.” He whispered, his hand brushing her lower back. She flinched, freezing in place.

Her eyes darted nervously. She shook her head.

“Sit.” He commanded, louder.

“She doesn’t have that privilege here!” the blonde snapped, amused.

“Sitting is not a privilege.” He growled, wondering what other cruelties they’d inflicted. He saw no bruises. A small relief.

It better stay that way.

The blonde recoiled, stunned into silence. “And I suggest,” Alexander locked eyes with Dominic, “you instruct your mate to remain quiet. Or I will silence her.”

“Alpha Alexander, you are in my home.”

“And you require my assistance, correct?”

The trio seethed. No one enjoys being commanded in their own domain, yet they subjected Athena to exactly that. He pointed to the empty chair between Sebastian and Julian. She finally sat.

“Let’s conclude this.” Dominic snapped. “The sooner she’s gone, the better.”

“Read the contract.”

“I agreed you could take her. That’s the deal.”

“Idiot.” Sebastian murmured. He knew better than to sign blindly.

They signed without reading, shoving the contract back. “Done.” Dominic muttered.

“Excellent. Remove her from my sight.” Dominic’s mate screeched.

Alexander would have preferred to simply take her and leave. But the contract ensured they could never reclaim her. Even if they begged.

He stood, offering his hand to Athena. “Come. We’re leaving this wretched place.”

Her warm fingers slipped into his. She rose, clutching her bag to her chest. She didn’t look back. Not once. It confirmed everything. Her hatred for them matched theirs for her.

She paused at the open door, her hand slipping from his. Her blue eyes widened at the sight of the limousine.

“Come.” He instructed.

Sebastian and Julian watched her curiously from behind.

Is she alright? Sebastian linked.

“Athena?” Alexander stepped in front of her. She was unresponsive, staring through him. “It’s time.”

“Okay.” Her lips barely moved.

She took a slow, deliberate step. Her hands gripped the doorframe, knuckles white. Her heartbeat accelerated. Her lips parted slightly. Her hand fell. Her eyes rolled back.

“I have you.” He caught her just before she hit the ground. Her body went rigid as he lifted her. She was shockingly light, weighing little more than a child.

Julian and Sebastian entered the car first. Julian raised a brow, a smirk playing on his lips as Alexander slid in with Athena on his lap.

“Not a word, Julian.”

He held her close, listening to her shallow breathing and slowing heart. He combed his fingers through her dark hair until she began to stir.

She jolted upright, pulling away, making herself small.

He didn’t force her. He focused on his Beta and brother, discussing pack matters, while stealing glances to ensure she was okay.

“Come.” The limousine stopped. He exited without waiting for the driver, offering his hand.

“I’m fine.” She finally spoke, avoiding his gaze. She shuffled toward the open door.

She stared up at his home, a small gasp escaping her. It was triple the size of Silver Creek. He hoped she could be happy here. That he could give her a better life.

“A tour.” He suggested, noting her tight grip on the bag.

She followed silently. He wasn’t sure if she heard a word he said.

“The omegas rotate. Teaches the young responsibility.” He showed her the dining hall with its long table.

They moved to the kitchen. He pointed to a board on the wall. “Add anything you need here. It will be ordered.”

Her brow furrowed. Still, she said nothing.

He picked up a pen. Perhaps he intimidated her. “Tell me what you need. You can’t live here with just that bag.”

Her stunning blue eyes scanned the room.

“Well?”

“I need nothing.” She whispered.

He sighed, scribbling a list. Underwear. Jeans. Workout clothes. Dresses. Shoes. Everything for the coming days.

He held the pen between his teeth, placing his hands on her waist. His thumbs met above her navel, his fingers touching her spine. She was far too thin. How had she survived?
###Chapter 0004
Alexander

I wrote down her measurements.
She looked like a frightened animal trapped in blinding light.
She was even smaller than I had anticipated.
Just skin and bones.
If my hands had moved any higher, I would have felt every protruding rib.
It disgusted me.
She should be strong.
Powerful.
Alpha blood flows through her veins.

I noticed how her face tightened when I measured her.
It wasn't fear.
It was pain.
She was hiding something beneath that loose maid's dress.

"Speak your mind," I said. "I don't care about whatever nonsense Dominic drilled into you. You don't need permission to talk. Say what you want. Are you hurt?"

"No."

She was lying. I could sense it.

She shook her head as if to emphasize her answer.
A strand of her dark hair slipped free from its restraint.
Athena would be difficult to reach.
A life of starvation had taught her to protect herself fiercely.
I will make Dominic pay for what he did to her.

"You must speak, Athena. I can't read your thoughts. When I mark you, at least then I'll know what you feel."

"Mark me?"

Her eyes widened impossibly further.

"Yes. I will mark you."

She seemed utterly shocked by this idea.
Her pink lips parted slightly as she stared at me.

I assumed she knew.
I thought that was why she came so willingly.
My Beta kept questioning my choice of bride.
There was no doubt.
Her scent was unusual, but something about her drew me in.
I couldn't look away when I first saw her.
My wolf Titan was equally obsessed.
Though he hadn't spoken a word about her.
He was furious with me for not bringing her home yesterday.

"You... brought me here to mark me." She stepped backward, bumping into the kitchen island. She flinched slightly, then quickly masked her pain, smoothing her expression.

"If Dominic had bothered to read the contract, he would have learned you are to be my bride, not a slave. He would also have discovered that if he or his foolish mate harm you again, their pack becomes mine. Or rather, yours. I never purchased you, Athena. You were always meant to be mine."

"I'm a killer," she gasped. "Why would someone like you want me as your bride?"

Blood. Titan growled, cutting through my thoughts.

I looked down at her loose dress.
A blood stain had appeared exactly where my hands had been.

"What is that? Are you injured?" I demanded. I had barely touched her.

She covered the stain with her hand. "It's nothing. Just a cut I keep reopening. I forget it's there."

Forget? How could anyone forget a wound?

Why isn't she healing? I felt Titan's panic. She's been here less than two hours and already she's hurt. His protective instincts surged.

It hadn't occurred to me that her lack of abilities included being unable to heal.
I need to find someone who can reverse the binding. Soon.

"Show me."

"It's fine," she mumbled.

I was already tired of hearing that phrase.

"It's not a request," I stated. "If you won't show me, I'll find a way to see it myself."

Her heart skipped a beat.
She glanced around the kitchen. "Can we go somewhere more private?"

"Private?" I wasn't accustomed to privacy. What wolf was?

She nodded but avoided direct eye contact, still too afraid to look straight at me.

Office, Titan muttered.

I was about to suggest that! I snapped back at my wolf. I felt him retreat into the shadows of my mind.

"This way." I gestured toward the door.

Athena waited for me and followed closely.
The scent of blood grew stronger.
This was more than a simple cut. I already knew that.

In the office, I used the remote to lower the blinds, blocking out the sunlight.
Athena hesitated, then slowly began undoing the buttons of her dress only where the large blood stain was.
She kept everything else concealed from me.

She pulled the fabric aside.
The wound was about four inches long and clearly infected.

"See? It's fine," she whispered.

"Stop saying that."

She closed her mouth and started rebuttoning her dress.

"No." I grabbed her hands, having spotted another bruise. "Show me the rest."

It wasn't optional.

She gasped as my fingers tore open the remaining buttons.

Her sports bra and panties were worn out.
But the bruising concerned me most.
Bruise upon bruise.
Scars from whips.
Her hip bones and ribs protruded sharply.

I turned her around and pulled the dress away from Titan.
Her back was just as damaged.
Yet interestingly, there were no marks above her chest or below her thighs.
Her arms were completely untouched.

There was only one reason for this pattern.
To hide the abuse from others, or to maintain appearances.
They didn't want guests to see.
More importantly, they didn't want me to see, especially since the meeting was arranged over a month ago.

She fumbled with her dress, pulling it tightly around her thin frame.

"You need a doctor."

"It always heals... eventually," she trailed off when she saw my anger.

"Did Dominic do this?" I asked through gritted teeth, gesturing to her body.

She lowered her blue eyes.

"Victoria?"

She remained silent.

"That idiot who follows Dominic around? All three of them?"

She pulled her dress tighter and nodded silently.
She brought her hand to her face, brushing her cheek, wiping away a stray tear.

"Anyone else?"

"The pack," she whispered.

I'm going to kill them all, Titan growled.

He'll have to wait his turn.

"Because of what they say you did to your parents."

She nodded.

"I don't believe you were responsible."

She looked up at me, her brow furrowed as her eyes finally met mine. "Because of the Wolfsbane Toxin?"

Theodore shook his head at me, a silent warning not to push any further.

I stared out at the vicious sea. "She jumped?"

Sophia's grey eyes gleamed as she nodded. "I told her, jump."

"Then it looks like we're jumping too. If Jasmine could do it, so can we."

We took turns watching the water, waiting for the tides to shift, timing their movements. This sea didn't behave like any other I'd ever seen. Thalia must have placed some kind of spell on it.

As the water level dropped, bare jagged rocks emerged. It became clear there was only one specific landing spot. That was if we were lucky enough not to be dragged out to sea or smashed against the rocks by the waves. Another problem: there were six of us. We couldn't jump all at once, making everything even riskier.

"Can everyone swim?" Natalie asked. Everyone nodded, but all eyes turned to Sophia. No one knew anything about her. She didn't give a clear answer, just smiled and muttered, "big jump."

Natalie grinned at Sophia, repeating the phrase reassuringly. I turned toward the barricaded door. The smell of burning wood and smoke seeped through the tiny gap underneath. Gabriel pressed his hand against the door and yanked it back immediately. "Fire," Natalie muttered, confirming what I already knew.

Thalia knew we would come here. Was this her plan? Did she want Sophia to lead us here? Or was this exactly what she expected? So she could trap us inside with no escape.

"We have to go now!"

"But the tide," Natalie protested as Theodore shattered a window.

"It doesn't matter. We either burn or die from the impact. I know which I'd prefer. At least this way, there's a small chance of survival."

I watched Theodore press his forehead to Ethan's. "See you on the other side."

He climbed through the window, kicking out the remaining shards of glass. With one final glance back, he jumped. Ethan leaped up into the window, frantically searching for Theodore. "There!" Natalie pointed at a dark object in the water.

Ethan dove out after his mate as Natalie tried to keep Sophia calm.

"Go," I urged both women. "Go now!"

"Gabriel." Natalie whispered, "Please."

He shook his head at her.

"I won't go without you," Natalie told him firmly.

He watched her, but she refused to move. I reached out to my daughter, telling her I loved her and to be good for Zachary. I wasn't sure if she could hear me, but I had to try.

"Natalie, listen. You need to go now. Theodore and Ethan will be waiting." I pushed her toward the window, and she released Sophia's hand. "Gabriel will be right behind you." "Jump, baby girl, jump. I will see you again." Sophia told her with a wide smile.

Natalie trembled as Gabriel helped her up into the window. Her eyes scanned the thrashing sea before closing. She pursed her lips, exhaling slowly. Somehow, the crashing waves stilled, gently lapping against the cliffside. They became the calmest they'd been since we started watching.

Gabriel nudged me.

"I see it." But I also saw how Sophia looked at her and the waves. Her eyes hardened, filling with pure disgust.

"Not my baby girl!" Sophia screamed with raw hatred. She shoved Natalie off the window ledge. A terrified scream ripped through me. I watched her flail helplessly as she plummeted toward the water, completely powerless.

Natalie was heading straight for the rocks.

I whirled on Sophia. "What the fuck did you do?"

"Witch!"
###Chapter 0005
Theodore

I pulled Xavi from the churning water, my heart hammering against my ribs. We were alive. For now.

His white fur was plastered to his lean frame as he scrambled into the dry, sheltered cove. He shook violently, sending a spray of salty ocean water over me before collapsing, his sides heaving.

I kept my eyes on the waves behind him. Something was shifting. The furious, intelligent chaos was fading, the water becoming… normal.

"Magic?" I whispered, searching the sky for any trace of cloud or energy. There was nothing.

The sea grew unnervingly calm just as a piercing scream tore through the air.

"What was that?"

I stepped back into the now-placid water, my gaze snapping upward. Indy was twisting in the air, a frantic silhouette against the sky.

'What is she doing?' Xavi's voice was a tired murmur in my mind.

"Falling," I answered flatly.

The sharp rocks below were vanishing, swallowed by water that rose smoothly to meet her. It was a deliberate cushion.

"Is this her?" I asked Xavi as he paddled closer.

He just stared, as bewildered as I was. 'I've never felt magic like this. Only the dark kind.'

Indy's body hit the surface with a tremendous splash. The water barely rippled. I swam out immediately, grabbing her limp form and dragging her back to the shallow rocks.

'Is she breathing?' Xavi asked, his worry palpable.

I checked her pulse. "Yes. She's in shock. Her mind shut down. I've seen it before when the body can't handle the trauma."

Two more splashes sounded. Brax and Orion were swimming toward us, their faces grim.

"Amelia?" I asked as Brax immediately went to Indy.

"That bitch pushed her!" Brax's voice was pure venom.

"Thalia?" I was confused. She hadn't been there.

"Amelia!" Brax spat the name. "Indy somehow calmed the sea. Amelia lost it. Shoved her over the edge and screamed 'Witch'."

Brax lifted Indy carefully and carried her deeper into the cove, Orion following. This spot was safe for the moment, but it was a temporary reprieve. When the ocean's rage returned, we'd be trapped.

"She can command earth and water?" I muttered, mostly to myself.

"I don't fucking know!" Brax snapped, his patience gone.

"What about Amelia? We can't just leave her up there to die."

"I think leading us to that bedroom was always the plan," Brax growled, gently brushing wet hair from Indy's unconscious face.

I opened my mouth to argue, but he cut me off with a sharp shake of his head. "Her soul…" He frowned, a deep sadness in his eyes. "It's the most damaged thing I've ever felt."

"Worse than Athena's?" I remembered his fascination with her fractured spirit.

"Athena's was different. Cracks that healed over time as she accepted her Lycan. That's rare. Amelia's…" He glanced up at the cliffs. "Hers is shattered. Full of holes. Held together by the thinnest threads. She isn't who she used to be. She shouldn't even be alive with a soul that broken."

"You think Thalia's controlling her?"

He kicked off his waterlogged boots. "You said the bitch walked away when she couldn't hurt you. I think she knew Amelia would lead us into a trap." He passed Indy's care to Orion.

"You couldn't have mentioned this sooner?" I asked, frustration bubbling up.

"When they're that broken, there's barely anything left to read. I can't be the only one who didn't trust her." His gaze swept over all of us.

'He's saying she's beyond saving. That she's going to die.' Xavi's voice was quiet in my mind.

'Do you believe that? She has Harrison blood. Athena always found a way back.'

'From what you've told me, Athena has a family now. People who love her. Amelia hasn't had that in years. And I've never felt Brax's certainty like this before.'

"You think we should abandon her?" The words felt wrong.

"Do you really think we're getting back inside that death trap?" Brax's tone shifted back to its usual sarcasm, a defense mechanism.

She was a prisoner. A victim. She didn't deserve to be left to Thalia.

'You tried to help her,' Xavi reminded me. 'Some things are beyond our control.'

It still felt like a betrayal. I could only hope she found her own way out.

As night fell, we took turns. One watched the sea, another slept, someone always stayed with Indy. Exhaustion weighed on everyone. The cove was our only sanctuary.

A low groan broke the quiet. Indy was stirring. She shot upright, panic in her eyes as she scanned the darkness. "I'm alive?" Her hands patted her own body, disbelieving. She groaned again.

"Yes," I said, moving closer so I wouldn't wake the others. "How do you feel? Do you remember what happened?"

"She pushed me!" Her eyes darted around, looking for the others. "Where is she?"

"She didn't jump."

Her brows furrowed. "Is she dead?"

"We don't know. Brax thinks it was all part of Thalia's plan. The more I think about it, the more I believe he's right."

"Like mind control? Thalia does that to people."

"Possibly."

"Then we have to help her." She pleaded with me. "That's what we do. We help people."

I managed a small smile. This was the woman who didn't want Brax to slaughter an entire pack under a spell. Now she wanted to save the person who betrayed us. She had no malice in her.

"Right now, we can't help anyone. But you can help us get out of here. We reach Obsidian Howl, we make a plan."

She let out a disbelieving snort. "Theodore, we're trapped by an ocean. A sentient ocean that wants to smash us into pieces."

"You stopped it. You calmed the waves. They slowed to catch you."

She snorted again, slapping a hand over her mouth to stifle a laugh. "No. I can't do that. If I could control water, don't you think I would have stopped the river from sweeping us away?"

"You didn't know you could shatter rock until you did it."

"You're a Hunter. Shouldn't you be trying to stop me from doing things like this?"

Athena

“I… don’t know what Wolfsbane Toxin is?” I whispered.

His expression darkened. “Your brother claimed you understood plant differences.”

“I…” Words failed me. My memory felt fractured, incomplete.

“Wolfsbane Toxin is Wolfsbane nourished by our blood. Its leaves develop a crimson tint. It’s not common knowledge—especially not for a child. Your brother’s story has inconsistencies.”

“Oh.”

“I will uncover the truth, Athena.” His crimson eyes narrowed intensely. “Whoever did this will pay for your suffering.” He perched on his desk edge, studying me. “Right now, that infection needs immediate attention.”

I stayed silent, grappling with his revelation. Why had my brother never suspected foul play?

“Come. I’ll show you our bedroom. Clean up before we visit the pack physician.”

I froze. Did he say our bedroom? As in, shared space? The implication sank in—as his contract bride, he likely expected unrestricted access. A cold shudder raced down my spine.

I glanced up, finding his gaze fixed on me. He stood by the open door, waiting. Adjusting my dress for coverage, I stepped into the deserted hallway.

As we walked, Alpha Alexander briefly identified rooms, but his focus remained on reaching the bedroom.

His chamber was expansive, dominated by massive windows like the rest of the estate. The bed sat against the wall, encircled by sheer drapes tied to bedposts.

Most startling was the open bathroom layout—only the toilet had separate enclosure. Zero privacy. He seemed unconcerned.

I jumped at the warmth of his breath near my skin. “You have nothing to fear.”

Though I couldn’t scent him, he’d detect my emotional shifts.

He crossed to the shower, turning it on. Steam fogged the glass within seconds. Fear coiled inside me. His expectations remained unspoken.

“Hey.” His calloused fingers lifted my chin. “It’s just us. For now, shower undisturbed.”

He retrieved his phone, set a timer, and placed it on the nightstand. “Ten minutes. I’ll return with clothes. Wait in a towel. Understood?”

His stare demanded response. I nodded. A ten-minute shower? At home, I was lucky to get one minute in cold water.

At the door, he paused, hand on the knob. “I wish you’d speak more, Athena.”

He left, and I dashed to the shower like this was a dream. Maybe it was. Maybe I’d wake in that basement.

The soaps and shampoos smelled divine. My hair had never felt cleaner. Hot water stung my stomach wound, but I didn’t care—it was worth it.

A throat cleared in the room. I froze, grateful for the concealing steam.

“Athena, finished? The alarm rang five minutes ago.” Alpha Alexander’s voice echoed.

I’d been so lost in the shower’s freedom, I’d missed both the alarm and his return.

“Coming,” I muttered, shutting off the water and wrapping a towel around myself.

Exiting, I noticed my torn dress, underwear, and sandals were gone. Alpha Alexander sat on the bed, holding folded clothes and sneakers.

“It’s temporary—no one here has your petite frame.” He offered a navy sweatsuit. “Underwear arrives tomorrow.”

He watched, eyebrow raised, as I pulled on the joggers and sweatshirt before ditching the towel. Perhaps he expected women to flaunt themselves for his power. I wasn’t one of them.

“Let’s go.” He stood, and this time I followed. Instinct warned that neglecting this wound would sour his mood.

The pack doctor was young, unlike my pack’s aging, territorial physician.

She smiled as we entered, re-securing her dark bun. “Isabella, this is Athena.” Alpha Alexander introduced me with a grin.

I kept my eyes down as Isabella remarked, “Alpha Alexander, what’s the issue besides her unusual scent?”

It didn’t sound malicious—more curious.

“She’ll explain when she finds her voice.”

“I have a wound,” I whispered.

“And you’re not healing?” Isabella sounded puzzled.

“I don’t have my Wolf.” I hated admitting it—a constant reminder I didn’t belong.

“Her Wolf was bound in childhood,” Alpha Alexander stated. “That’s why her scent is off. Her Wolf is trapped, waiting release.”

My eyes shot up, meeting his gaze. I’d always believed my Wolf was gone—not imprisoned.

Isabella’s dark eyes lingered on me. “Wow, okay.” She took my hand. “Let’s examine that wound.”

She led me to a room, had me lie down, and asked to see the injury.

Lifting my sweatshirt just enough, her eyes widened. Fury flickered as she noted the infection and surrounding bruises.

Her fingers probed gently. “How long ago?”

“A few days,” I mumbled, though timing blurred. Beatings merged into endless pain. Unbruised days were rare.

Isabella shook her head. “This is over a week old. Infection set in days ago.”

“Athena, tell the truth,” Alpha Alexander ordered.

“I don’t know.”

“ATHENA!” His voice vibrated through me. I shut my eyes, fearing anger—always a prelude to punishment and pain.

“I swear, I don’t know. The beatings… they blend. I’m never without bruises.”

Silence followed. I was too scared to open my eyes. Dominic had threatened endlessly—exposure meant worse suffering. Now, here I was, in another pack’s hospital, truth spilling.

“Heal her!” Alpha Alexander shouted after an eternity. He stormed out, phone in hand.

“Forgive my brother. His temper flares over injustices.” Isabella murmured, inspecting my wound.

“Your brother?” I whispered, opening my eyes.

“Ah, he told you. Guess he omitted that Julian is our brother too?”

I shook my head. Julian must’ve been at my brother’s house.

She chuckled. “Julian is our brother’s Gamma.”

“Gamma?” I didn’t know the term.

“Yes. Alpha Alexander has mixed feelings about me working here. Wants family representation but acknowledges my skills.” She grabbed a cream jar. “Apply this thrice daily. Should clear the infection. If no improvement in two days, return. My brother waits outside.”

“Thanks,” I mumbled, taking the jar. I couldn’t read the label—I’d never learned.

She nodded as I hurried out. Alpha Alexander was on his phone, snapping at someone. He hung up upon seeing me, demanding Isabella’s instructions.

“Cream, three times daily.” I showed him the jar; he took it.

“Good, come.” He strode off, and I struggled to keep pace. We returned to his office.

“Show me,” he ordered, uncapping the jar.

Resistance was futile—his tone echoed when he’d torn my dress earlier.

Slowly lifting my sweatshirt, he knelt before me. His hands were warm as he applied the cool cream. “Don’t lie to me, Athena. Ever. If you can’t remember, say so. Clear? I won’t decipher half-truths.”

“Okay.” I focused on his touch—one hand steadying my lower back, the other tending my wound. This was the first gentle contact I’d had from a man—not violence.

“Breathe,” he commanded, rising. “I won’t harm you.”

Given my past, belief felt impossible. His actions, his words—they felt surreal.
###Chapter 0006
Alexander

She held no trust in me.
Not an ounce.
It only fueled my curiosity about her past.
I needed to know everything.
I craved to understand her completely.
I had to uncover who turned her life upside down years ago.
And why they framed a child.

While Isabella tended to her, I called my Beta, Sebastian.
He was monitoring Silver Creek pack.
I needed to know if he found anything unusual.

So far, nothing.
Which made me question how much they concealed.
How deep did their secrets go?

Until Dominic contacted me, I never heard of Silver Creek.
A pack living less than fifty miles away.
I wondered if Athena knew that.

I instructed him to return.
The pack run was tonight.
He needed to be present.

I noticed Athena hadn't smiled since we met.
Not once did her unique scent shift to indicate happiness.
Something I intended to change.
Especially if she was to be my mate.

I ran my hand across her stomach.
She held her breath.
Her eyes avoided mine, searching for anything else to focus on.

"Are you afraid of me?" I asked directly as her sweatshirt fell back down.

Of course she is. Just look at her. Titan muttered, pacing in my mind.

I watched her bite the inside of her cheek, thinking of a response. "Everyone is," she whispered breathlessly.

I raised an eyebrow.

"You lead the largest pack. You've waged wars and absorbed others. You've killed multiple Alphas. People seek your help; you never ask for theirs. It would be foolish not to fear you."

I smiled, feeling Titan's satisfaction.
We worked hard to become the Alpha we are.

Athena was smarter than her brother portrayed. "That's not what I meant. I know my standing. I'm asking about you. Are you, Athena, afraid of me?"

Her eyes quickly dropped to the floor.
I wished she wouldn't do that.
I could lose myself in them all day.

"I am not them," I declared when her silence lingered. I would never sink to their level. I would never harm a woman for my gain.

"Were there others like you?" Usually, where there was one, there were more, hidden from sight.

She shook her head. "Only me."

It made it infinitely worse knowing they solely targeted her.
That everyone else was deemed superior while she carried Alpha blood.

"You are one person who never needs to fear me. I want you to know that."

She pulled the sleeves over her hands, hiding more of herself from me.

By nightfall, she still hadn't initiated conversation.
Every exchange started with me, ending with nods or head shakes.
She was nearly impossible to read, but I loved a challenge.

"You need to sleep," I murmured, guiding her toward the stairs.
She lacked a Wolf and couldn't join the pack run.

Her blue eyes glanced at the large wall clock.
Still, she kept her mouth shut, guarding her thoughts.

She followed me through the house back to my bedroom.
She allowed me to apply the cream on her stomach again.
Like before, she held her breath.
But this time, she seemed less afraid, watching me instead of closing her eyes.

"Goodnight," I muttered.
As I leaned in to kiss her cheek, she tensed, her heart racing.
I expected her to flee, but she remained rooted, eyes squeezed shut.

She gasped softly as I stepped back toward the door. "You're leaving?" she whispered, surprised.

"It's a full moon tonight. I lead the pack run. I'll return in a few hours, but you'll likely be asleep."

"Pack run?" she mumbled, brow furrowing.

"You know, when the pack hunts together." Her eyes widened as I spoke. "Silver Creek doesn't do pack runs?" As far as I knew, everyone did.

She shook her head.

I gave her a reassuring smile. "You'll get used to them. Get some sleep. Because when you have your Wolf back, you'll join us."

As I closed the door, she stood in the same spot, staring at me, confused.

Downstairs, I found Sebastian and Julian waiting.

"How's it going with the new girl?" Julian asked, unbuttoning his shirt.

"Athena is staying, and Silver Creek doesn't do pack runs," I muttered, pondering her words.

"Are you serious?" Sebastian questioned. "I thought that was standard everywhere. All Wolves are empowered on a full moon; it's the best time to hunt."

I frowned at Sebastian. "You sure you didn't see anything unusual?"

"From my position, they acted like everyone else. Some went to work, some trained, others harvested crops." He raised a brow. "Why? What do you think they're hiding?"

"For starters, who really killed Athena's parents."

"Dominic?" Sebastian suggested.

"I don't think Dominic is smart enough for that. The idiot didn't even read the contract," Julian muttered.

"I think we should pay them a visit tomorrow," Julian suggested.

"Surprise them?" I muttered.

"Sometimes it's better when they don't know we're coming!"

"True. Dominic was furious about my arrival."

After the hunt, I confirmed with Sebastian and Julian our departure time before heading upstairs to shower.

Quietly slipping through the bedroom door, I was relieved to find Athena fast asleep.
I half expected her to have run, to have used the chance to escape.
Instead, she was curled up in a small ball, hugging a pillow, still in the sweats I gave her earlier.

She didn't wake during my shower.
She didn't stir when I turned on the light.
Almost as if she was accustomed to sleeping in confined spaces, at any time.

Drying off, I climbed into bed with her.
Pulling her tiny, weak frame against me.
She made soft noises as she began to wake but quickly fell back asleep.

Waking before her, I couldn't help but watch her sleep.
Sometime during the night, she had rolled over, facing me.
In the early morning light, a faint sprinkling of freckles across her nose was visible.

She gasped, suddenly sitting upright and rubbing her eyes. "Where am I?"

"Athena, you're in my pack, remember."

Her blue eyes locked on mine before drifting downward, to my bare chest, then to the sheet barely covering me.

"Are you... Are you naked?!" A rosiness touched her cheeks, making her look less fragile.

"I prefer it that way, especially in my own bed," I smirked.

She patted herself down, checking she was still clothed, and sighed with relief upon realizing she was fully dressed.

We could strip her. Titan muttered. We could show her what we truly want.

We need to take it slower. I replied. She isn't like the others.

Titan sulked at my comment, retreating to the back of my mind.
Thankfully, with age, I had gained better control over him.

Athena crossed the room, shutting herself in the bathroom.
I could hear her muttering about keeping it together.

"When you're done," I called out, "we need to apply your cream."

Ten minutes later, she reappeared.
She eyed me as I pulled on a black tee.

"Sebastian, Julian, and I have an errand. You'll be staying here." I grabbed the cream and gestured for her to lift her top.

"Alone?" she asked, her voice trembling as she rolled up her top.

"Alone," I confirmed. "Well, others will be here, so not completely alone." My hand lingered on her stomach a moment longer.

She's right here. Titan growled.

Dropping my hand, Titan sulked.
He wanted to make a statement.
To claim her as ours, to finally silence the rumors surrounding us.

Athena

Alexander guided me into the new office space. A second desk now stood beside his own. He maneuvered the pram through the doorway, checking on the twins before coming up behind me. His arms circled my waist. "Every Alpha requires a proper desk." He murmured the words against my skin before pressing a warm kiss to my neck. "Though you needn't use it for paperwork. I can devise far more interesting uses for it."

My gaze swept the freshly arranged room. Stark white walls were adorned with black and white portraits of our children. The furniture, crafted from black painted wood, created a sharp contrast against the bright walls. Massive windows flooded the space with natural light, making it feel both airy and inviting. If this single room was any indication, I was eager to see the remainder of the renovations.

Zachary and Evelyn's scents reached me moments before his voice called out. "Athena? Alexander?"

"Office," Alexander answered, his lips brushing the mark he had given me.

Zachary entered first, offering an approving nod at the new space. Evelyn followed silently behind him, her gaze uncertain and darting around the room.

"You asked for me," she mumbled softly.

I remained silent as Zachary settled comfortably into one of the chairs. He shot a knowing wink in my direction. He was fully aware of my reason for summoning her. Clearly, he had kept it a secret from Evelyn.

"How are you settling in?" Alexander asked Evelyn. I recognized his attempt to ease into the conversation, giving me time to find the right words.

She nodded quickly. "I'm incredibly grateful." The words tumbled out as she glanced toward Zachary, who merely shrugged. "I'll do anything you require. I want to be here. I wish to stay with Zachary. Whatever it is, I can make it right." She added the last part when Zachary offered no reassurance. "You've done nothing wrong," Alexander told her.

The twins began cooing from their pram. Evelyn straightened her posture. "Your pups are here?"

"Would you like to meet them?" I finally spoke. Why was this so difficult? I simply needed to ask her to become my Beta.

'Because nearly everyone has betrayed us in some form!' Nyx snapped internally. 'Caution is justified.'

Evelyn moved quietly to the pram and peered inside. I noticed Zachary watching her with keen interest. He adored Charlotte, but he clearly desired children of his own.

"They're beautiful, Athena." She smiled down at them. "You're truly blessed."

"We are," Alexander confirmed.

Evelyn turned to face me fully. "Was that why you called me here? To meet your daughters?"

"I want you as my Beta." I held her gaze, surprised by my own bluntness. It had come out far more aggressively than intended.

Her lips parted slightly before her jaw went slack. Her grey eyes locked with mine as she began shaking her head in disbelief. Silence enveloped the room, broken only by the soft sounds from the pram.

"But..." Evelyn closed her eyes, her forehead creasing in confusion. "You made it perfectly clear... I... Our beginning was less than ideal. You have Zachary." She gestured toward him. "And Sebastian, or your friend Brianna? She's your close friend." "Zachary and Sebastian are Alexander's Betas, not mine." I offered a small smile to Zachary. "I know he would give his life for me, but he was never chosen to be my Beta. You were."

I turned to Alexander, who smiled and nodded in support. "Perhaps there was a purpose for your arrival in my life."

"Right." She looked down at her feet. "Dakota once mentioned we were preselected. But why now? Why offer this role to me now? I appreciate the offer, but it doesn't logically follow. There are far better candidates than me." "Every Alpha requires a Beta." Alexander mused, echoing his earlier sentiment about my desk.

"What are your thoughts?" Zachary asked Evelyn as he stood.

She closed her eyes. "Dakota says yes, that this is our destined position. But what if I fail? I'm still new to having my Lycan. I haven't shifted since I tore Levi's head off. I don't know how effective I can be." "Do you believe I was born knowing?" Zachary countered.

"Evelyn, for some, the ability is innate," Alexander explained. He glanced at me with a small smile playing on his lips. "Sometimes it requires guidance to draw it out, but the capability always exists." His smile widened as he lifted a fussy Willa from the pram. I loved how he immediately attended to the children at the slightest sign of distress.

"What would you expect me to do?"

"Help me dismantle Silver Streams."

"You wish to destroy your birthright?" she scoffed.

'It ceases to be a birthright when the man wants us dead!' Nyx retorted.

"It was never truly mine." I sighed as Alexander passed Willa to me before retrieving Aderyn from the pram. "It's merely an idea perpetuated over decades, perhaps centuries. A forgotten hope. A Witch and a deranged Harrison are driving it into ruin, destroying lives, and I refuse to allow that. This is my home. This is my children's home, not some place I was never part of."

"Aldous Harrison would be horrified to learn a Witch holds power," she sighed, her shoulders slumping as her face contorted. "I wouldn't even know where to begin. I've told you Dakota confirms this is my identity, but I question my usefulness to you. What about the others? Those who cannot tolerate my presence. They won't heed me."

"I know precisely who you mean," I muttered. "But Seraphina holds no relevance here."

"She already despises me. I can do nothing right despite repeated apologies. If I accept, she'll want me dead more than ever. I'd have to sleep with one eye open. I refuse to return to that existence. You must understand that."

She was correct. I knew that life intimately. I had spent years fearing the same, and even now, I sometimes jolt awake at night expecting an attack. The fear only dissipates when Alexander sleepily pulls me against him.

"You'll possess the authority to order her silence." Zachary smirked. "What could she possibly do then?"

"May I have time to consider?" she asked quietly.

"Certainly," I replied, surprised. I had been certain Evelyn would accept immediately.

She turned on her heel and exited. Zachary shot me a puzzled look before hurrying after her.

"That was unexpected." Alexander frowned. "I anticipated she would seize the opportunity."

I nodded, staring at the empty doorway. If anything, her hesitation made her more desirable as a Beta. She wasn't rushing in blindly; she needed to contemplate, to ensure it was the correct decision.
###Chapter 0007
Zachary

"Evelyn?" I call out, following her quickening pace. She was clearly heading home, refusing to even glance back at me. She moved desperately, trying to escape any watching eyes.

She burst through the front door, slamming it shut behind her. This reaction was completely unexpected. When Alexander explained why Athena wanted to see her, I assumed keeping it quiet would be a pleasant surprise. I thought she would be thrilled. This was not the response I anticipated.

I found her curled on the sofa. Her knees were drawn to her chest, forehead resting against them. She wasn't crying. There were no hidden sniffles or attempts to conceal tears.

"We are not doing this." I tell her firmly, lifting her face until her grey eyes meet mine. "Whatever this is, it stops now. I am right here. Silence is not an option. I allowed that to happen once before. I won't make that mistake again."

She takes a deep breath, her chest rising steadily. "It's too risky." Her brow furrows into a slight frown. "So many pack members don't want me here, Zachary. It's not just Seraphina. They want me dead. The only reason I'm alive is because of you. They know crossing that line would end their lives. It's exhausting, Zachary. Dakota tells me daily that this is my destiny. That this is who I'm meant to be. Do you know how often she reminds me?"

"Too much?"

She rolls her eyes at my comment. "What if they blame Athena for this decision? What if it turns everyone against her?" "They won't."

"Of course they will. The only reason they stay quiet now is fear of punishment. Why can't they see me the way you do?" "Because if they did, I might have to intervene."

Her lips curve slightly, but the smile fades quickly.

"Evelyn, you've kept yourself completely clean. More than most can claim. Even Luc trusts you with his daughter. That speaks volumes."

"He's just one man." She glides her tongue along her lips. "Dakota wants me to accept. She says it's our calling. I know I won't let Athena down. But everyone outside that door will see it as the world's biggest mistake. All because they can't move past errors I had no control over."

"You don't give yourself enough credit."

"How can I? I'm one of the two most hated people in this pack. Even Brianna won't speak to you because of me. I know she came by."

"I knew you weren't napping." I muse. She had claimed she was lying down seconds before Brianna knocked. Brianna stared at me for several moments before stomping off without a word.

"Before you say anything, this isn't a pity party. I'm just trying to make sense of it all. I'm not wrong about Seraphina. You know she's a constant thorn in my side. She already uses our relationship as an excuse. She tells everyone you're the reason Athena lets me live. Maybe that's true. But this? This feels like rubbing salt in the wound."

I've been monitoring Seraphina from a distance. She does her job and keeps her head down—unless Evelyn is near. It's like she can't control her anger around my mate. Not enough to shift or physically attack. But I'm waiting for her to cross that line.

I drop onto the sofa beside her. My weight shifts her body against mine. "If you don't want to be Athena's Beta, that's fine. She won't hold it against you." I tell her, wrapping my arms around her. She rests her head against my chest and sighs. "She won't"

"No."

She frowns deeply. "I wish the answer were a simple yes or no."

Athena

“My brother seems genuinely fond of you.” Isabella grins, shoving a pastry into her mouth.

My gaze snaps to hers across the breakfast table. Alpha Alexander assigned her to watch me while he handled his mysterious errands. My earlier comment about being alone must have made him reconsider.

He didn’t share his destination, and I didn’t ask. It wasn’t my place to know.

“You’re much prettier than the last one.” Isabella mumbles, pulling me from my thoughts.

“Last one?” I nearly choke on my juice.

“You’re his contracted mate, right?”

I nod slowly.

“Did you honestly believe you were the first?”

The possibility never crossed my mind. My focus remained on what Alpha Alexander might do to me. He hadn’t made any advances beyond holding me while we slept. No wandering hands. No demands to sleep naked. Nothing. The waiting felt worse than knowing. He didn’t strike me as a patient man.

“Hopefully, you’ll stick around.” She reaches for another pastry.

“Stick around?” These casual phrases and her informal tone feel foreign. I’m accustomed to orders and abuse, not conversation.

“I probably shouldn’t tell you this, but it’s better if you’re prepared.” She takes a deep breath. “My brother has searched for his true mate for years. He’s twenty-eight. Still no heir. The others never last more than a few weeks. Some run. Some get killed.” She shrugs like it’s the most normal thing in the world.

“Because they won’t give him an heir?”

She shakes her head. “Because he loses interest.”

“Why are you telling me this?” I whisper. I’d rather not know if my death is imminent.

“There’s something different about you. He looks at you differently. I noticed it at the hospital.”

Her words don’t comfort me. Everyone looks at me differently because of my strange scent.

“Your real problem will be if he finds his true mate.” She mutters.

Marcus had been my true mate. He rejected me the second I turned eighteen. He burst into the basement in the middle of the night, screaming his rejection. He beat me until I accepted it.

"You have a mate, don't you? I can see it in your eyes."

"Had." I whisper. "He rejected me." I remember the agony, not just from the beating. It felt like my heart was ripped from my chest. Because I felt the bond, my brother had me bound again. That’s when I stopped healing like everyone else.

"I understand. Mine rejected me too." She sighs. "The moment he learned which pack I belonged to and who my brother is, he wanted nothing to do with me. Anyway, like I said, my brother seems to like you more than the others."

Is that supposed to make me feel better? Knowing I might last a bit longer than the others. That he might keep me like some prized possession because he likes me.

Isabella takes me to the hospital with her. She has work to do, and apparently Alpha Alexander ordered her not to let me out of her sight except for bathroom breaks. Maybe he thought I’d run like his other brides. As if I have the energy for that.

No one comes into the hospital. Isabella spends most of her time doing inventory. It seems pointless to have a pack hospital when everyone can heal.

"Hey." She smiles as she approaches me. "I'll be here a while longer, so I brought you some magazines to read."

She drops them on the table in front of me. I stare blankly at the pages. I don’t recognize the people in the photos, and I can’t understand the words written about them.

"Not your thing?" she asks curiously.

I shake my head, not wanting to admit the truth.

She stares at me from across the counter, her eyes narrowing slightly. "You can't read, can you?"

How did she guess? I shake my head, my cheeks burning with embarrassment.

"I'm guessing you never went to school?"

"No." Admitting it feels humiliating. What twenty-two-year-old can’t read or write?

"Does my brother know?"

"No."

"Well, at least now I have something to do besides counting." She smiles and sits beside me.

Hours pass, and I still struggle to grasp it. But she remains patient, continuing to teach me. Suddenly, she gathers the papers, shuffles them into a pile, and shoves them into a drawer.

"My brother is back."

"How do you know?"

"Pack thing."

Seconds later, the doors swing open. Alpha Alexander storms toward us. He looks furious. His crimson eyes darken. His brow furrows, and his focus zeroes in on me.

"I need a word with my mate!" He snaps at Isabella.

"Sure." she mutters, quickly escaping and leaving me alone with him.

He waits until she’s out of sight before turning to me. My eyes drop to the floor as his voice echoes through the hospital. "Where has Dominic gone?"

"Huh?"

"Do I need to repeat myself?"

I open my mouth to say I don’t understand.

"There was no one there, Athena. No one." I feel his glare burning into me.

That doesn’t make sense. How could there be no one?

"Homes empty. The packhouse, empty. Where have they gone, Athena?"

I shake my head, confused. "You... you went to see my brother?" I whisper, refusing to meet his gaze.

"Was this all a lie?" He gestures at me. "A setup to gather information on me?" He’s seething. "What does Dominic want?"

I close my eyes like I always do. It’s easier if I don’t see the blow coming.

"ATHENA!" His hand grabs my chin. "I said you would never have to fear me. But that was when I believed I was helping you. Open your fucking eyes and look at me!"

Tears escape my closed eyes. Isabella was wrong. This is the end for me.

I open my eyes. His crimson ones stare into mine. Slowly, his expression softens. "You don’t know what I’m talking about, do you?"

"No." I mumble.

He releases my chin. "The pack is empty!"

"Abandoned?" I whisper.

"No, nothing is gone. Everything is still there, but there were no people anywhere. It’s like they vanished. Trust me, we searched. You said they don’t do pack runs, but they clearly do something."

"I don’t know." I gulp. "I never left the pack until yesterday. I... I never went further than the gardens." I frown. "But sometimes, the house would be empty. If I wasn’t locked away, I would steal food."

"How often?" He questions.

"Every couple of months, I think."

If it weren’t for those times when the house was empty, allowing me to steal food, I would have starved to death years ago.

"No one talks about it?"

I shake my head.

"Are you sure, Athena?"

"They might, just not when I’m around."

Suddenly, he extends his hand to me. "Come, we’re going home."

His large hand envelops mine as he pulls me from the chair and against his chest. His arms lock tightly around me, squeezing the air from my lungs.

"You better not be lying to me, Athena. I don’t tolerate liars."

"I promise." I whisper, trying to ignore the pain from my wound. Instead of looking away, I find myself staring at him. Even without my Wolf, I can feel his power. It’s overwhelmingly intoxicating.
###Chapter 0008
Alexander

I saw it in her eyes.
She was just as confused as I was.
Maybe even more.
She walked beside me, nearly jogging to keep up as we headed back to the house.
Her gaze remained lowered, fixed on her feet as we moved.

"Sit down." I guided her into the office.
She didn't hesitate like she had at Silver Creek.
She took one of the empty chairs immediately.
She sat with her legs pressed tightly together.
Her sleeves were pulled down over her hands.
Her face was turned downward in submission.

"Athena?"

Her back straightened when I said her name.
Her heart began to race.
The last time it did that, she nearly passed out.

"I swear I don't know anything." The words tumbled from her mouth as if she were fighting for her life. "If I knew, I would tell you."
She spoke as though those words were her only lifeline.
Something I hadn't felt in years flooded my veins.
Guilt.
She shouldn't feel that way around me.

'You're upsetting her!' Titan growled.

"I shouldn't have shouted at you." I murmured, sitting on the edge of my desk. "You didn't deserve that." I paused, frustrated by what else she had told me. "You stole food?"

"I had to." she whispered.

The more I learned about that pack and what they did to her, the more I hated them.
When the time came, every single one of them would be eliminated.

'Finally something we agree on.' Titan murmured.

Athena's eyes flicked up to meet mine.
She bit her bottom lip.
I would erase her entire past.

Contracts were simple.
Every contract I had ever drawn up always favored me.
The other side was always too arrogant to read it or negotiate.
They always lost.
This time, it would be Dominic and his pathetic pack losing everything.

"Tell me about Victoria." I spoke softly, aware that my Alpha tone made her nervous.

A flicker of rage crossed her face.
It vanished as quickly as it appeared.
I had seen it before when that stupid bitch called my bride a rat.

"What do you want to know?"

"Everything. And no lies. How long has she been with Dominic?"

She shrugged. "She's been around as long as I can remember. Dominic is twelve years older than me. They went to school together."

"She's his true mate?"

Athena nodded. "She was nice once. Before I... before my parents died. She used to bring me presents, mostly toys. Everything changed after she became Luna and I became nothing."

"You didn't kill your parents." When would she accept it was a lie? "And you are not nothing. Not anymore."

She puffed out her cheeks.
Her brow furrowed.

"Talk to me." I muttered, ignoring Titan's rumblings.

"I will be nothing when you cast me aside for a new bride."

I rolled my eyes. "Isabella?"

She nodded.

"Isabella needs to learn to keep her mouth shut." Grinding my teeth, I stared at her. I had asked for her truth, so it was only fair I gave her mine. "Isabella isn't wrong. There have been other brides, but none that I truly wanted by my side."

"You killed them?"

Isabella really needed to learn to keep quiet.
She was the one who had terrified my other brides by telling them the same stories she told Athena.
She was the reason some of them ran.

"Some of them."

She nodded, keeping her eyes down.

"I didn't kill them because I was bored. Some were passing information back to their old packs. Others were just after money, or desperate to be on my arm at all times. If I had to go somewhere, they would whine about not getting enough attention."

"Oh."

"Isabella likes to do this. She tests my brides. But do you know what they all had in common?"

She shook her head.

"I never marked them. I could never bring myself to do it. Something always held me back." Athena was the only one I had considered marking.
I still couldn't figure out what drew me to her.

'She's perfect.' Titan sounded smitten.

She grabbed the pot of cream.
She automatically stood and lifted her top to show me her wound.

She let out a soft gasp as my fingers brushed against her skin.
Her heart skipped a beat.
She closed her eyes.
She had a habit of doing that.
Afraid to witness what was happening.
Or maybe afraid to look me in the eye.
I couldn't tell.

My fingers paused over her stomach.
She held her breath.

"Breathe, Athena." I whispered.
Her heart skipped again.

She let her lungs expand.
Tears crept from the corners of her eyes.
"I don't want to die." Her eyes flashed open, locking onto mine.
It was the first time since meeting her that she truly looked at me.
Her breathing hitched.
Her lips parted slightly.

A growing need surged inside me.
The need to make her mine.
So that no one else could claim her.
How could she make me feel this way?

'Mate!' Titan growled.

'Not possible. Her Wolf isn't present.' I told him.

'Mate!' he repeated louder, growing more agitated.

'You're wrong!'

Athena's blue eyes remained locked on mine.
The tears had stopped.
Her brow dipped slightly as she stared.

"I have to..." I muttered, turning away.
Her gaze had completely thrown me off.
I stormed out of the office.

'Go back!' Titan demanded. 'Go back, we need to mark her!'

I could feel him pushing forward.
Trying to break free from my control.
The more he pushed, the more I fought back.
Keeping him contained.
I had to get out of the house.

Striding across the grounds, I headed toward the pack hospital.
I needed to know what else Isabella had told her.

She was asleep at the desk.
She startled when I woke her.

"What the hell did you say to her?"

She rolled her eyes. "She needs to know the truth. It's not fair if she doesn't know what's coming." She rubbed her eyes and yawned. "Why? Did she run?"

"No. She's in my office."

"Then no harm done." She shrugged. "If you want my opinion, she's nice. Different from the others."

"I'm well aware. Why do you think I chose her?"

'Because she's our mate.' Titan muttered gleefully.

I tried to ignore his comment.
He had to be wrong.
Her Wolf wasn't present.
It would be impossible to know.

Isabella walked around the desk.
She leaned on it and smiled at me. "I was right. You really like this one, don't you?"

"She has a name." I snapped.
Turning on my heel, I walked away.

'Why are you fighting it?' Titan asked as I stopped in front of the house.

'How do you know?' I muttered.

'When she looked us in the eye. Her Wolf is buried deep, but it's strong. I can feel it. Maybe even stronger than us.'

Pushing open the door, I could still smell her unique scent.
I had given her another chance to run, but she was still here.

In the office, she sat in a chair, hugging her legs to her chest.
Titan practically screamed at me to claim her.
Instead, I asked her why she was still here.

"You didn't tell me to go anywhere." She kept her eyes low.
I wondered if she knew. "And I have nowhere to go."

"Have you looked through my stuff?" I muttered, glancing at the paperwork on my desk.
It didn't look disturbed, but that didn't mean it hadn't been.

She shook her head.
Her hair fell around her face.

"I don't tolerate lies." I reminded her. "I don't do scheming women."

She frowned. "I didn't look because..." She dragged her teeth across her bottom lip.
Her cheeks flushed. "I... I can't read."

It was completely unexpected.
The others would have made up some elaborate lie.

"School?"

She shook her head.
I should have guessed she never went.
Not if she had been a slave since she was six.

"Isabella tried teaching me a bit. But I didn't understand."

Why hadn't Isabella told me?
Was it because she actually liked Athena too?
She had never shown interest in any of my other brides.
In fact, she had hated every single one.

"I get it." She muttered. "You regret choosing me. But please don't kill me. I can work. I can clean. I can do anything you need. Just please don't kill me."

I pulled her from the chair.
I planted my lips on hers.

"I get it now. You want to help Athena, but you don't want a permanent position in the pack." I'd wrestled with similar doubts when Alexander offered me the Beta role, so I understood her hesitation completely. "That's part of it. I just... why now? Do you think she was planning this when she questioned me yesterday?"

"Possibly." Athena hadn't confirmed or denied anything when I asked her. "What are your thoughts on taking down Silver Streams?"

"Do you believe she truly wants that?"

"One thing I've learned about Athena is that she never speaks without purpose. You share a grandfather who attempted to have her kidnapped. How does that make you feel?"

"He was wrong to do it. Families shouldn't act that way."

"A Witch is collaborating with your grandfather. They sent Julian to retrieve her. Athena hasn't said it directly, but she clearly wants both the Witch and your grandfather eliminated. Perhaps she simply wants your assistance with that."

She sat up and frowned at me. "A temporary Beta arrangement? Do you think she'd agree to those terms?"

"I'm certain you can negotiate the conditions."

She nodded slowly. "But what if... what if I become Rogue?"

"Is that what frightens you?"

"Many things frighten me. Levi always called me a monster. Bloodthirsty and every pack's worst nightmare." "Levi enjoyed preying on people's weaknesses. That doesn't make his words true. Besides, I won't let that happen to you."

"You can't possibly..."

I pulled her onto my lap. "I returned from that darkness. Several of us prevented Athena from going down that path. I'll do everything in my power to keep you from crossing into that territory."

She wrapped her arms around my neck, pressing herself tightly against my chest. "I wish I'd met you years ago. You help me see things more clearly." Her soft lips met mine, her back arching as she pushed her breasts against me. Our kiss intensified just as the front door swung open.

"Assholes!" Julian tutted, stopping abruptly when he saw us. "My apologies. I'll leave."

"Don't bother. You've ruined the moment." Evelyn snapped as she climbed off me. She pressed her lips to my cheek. "I'm going to speak with Athena."

"Should I come with you?"

"No. I can handle this alone."

"You really should use the bedroom," Julian commented as Evelyn closed the door. "Anyone could walk in here."

I muttered under my breath, adjusting my position. "Who were you calling assholes?"

"I offered to help guard the gates."

"They refused you?" I asked, already knowing why they'd declined.

He dipped his chin at me. "From your tone, I take it this doesn't surprise you?"

"I hate to be the one to say this, but did you truly believe they'd allow that? You're still under a spell that hasn't been completely broken—one that tampered with your memory. You were sent to collect Athena and return her to Silver Streams. You're Alexander's twin. Don't call them assholes when they're protecting their pack."

He dropped into a chair with a scowl. "Is it true?"

"Is what true?"

"Athena and Alexander. They have four children? Not just the one she was carrying?"

He would have discovered the truth eventually. I was just surprised it took him this long. "Yes."

"Two sets of twins?"

"Yes. Who told you?"

"The one who dislikes Evelyn. I believe her name is Seraphina."

"Seraphina?" What an unpleasant surprise.

Julian nodded. "Athena's half-sister, correct?"

"I wouldn't call her that if I were you."

He frowned. "Why didn't you tell me? Because of Thalia?"

I nodded. "And for the same reason they won't let you help at the gates."

"It would have been nice for my boys..." His voice trailed off as he shook his head, frowning and closing his eyes. "My boys aren't real."

"And that's precisely why no one will let you help. You might believe you're ready, but you're far from it. Now, if you'll excuse me, Lottie's teacher is linking me."
###Chapter 0009
Zachary

I release a heavy sigh as I step out of the house.
My feet carry me across the pack grounds, bracing for whatever awaits.
I haven't been summoned since the incident involving Liam.

Children are already streaming out of the small schoolhouse as I approach.
The session shouldn't have ended yet.

The teacher meets me at the door, her face tight with worry.
She silently gestures for me to follow.
I spot Lottie's small trainers peeking out from beneath a desk before the teacher even points.
"I can't reach her," the teacher whispers urgently. "She won't stop crying."

I hear Lottie's quiet whimpers and sniffles.
Her nose sounds completely stuffed.
"How long has she been like this?"

"The tears started and stopped all morning since she arrived."
"I'll be right outside if you need anything."

"Lottie, come out now."

Her little toes twitch slightly, but she doesn't move.

"Lottie, I can move this desk myself, but I want you to come out and talk to me."
The sniffles continue, but she remains silent.

I squat down to floor level and see her clutching her teddy bear desperately.
Her bright green eyes swim with tears.
Her cheeks shine red and puffy from constant rubbing.
"Lottie?"

"Daddy's in big trouble!" she croaks, fresh tears breaking free.

"Luc?"

Her eyes drop to study her shoes.
"A fire...and scary water."

"Come here," I urge, pulling her out and wrapping her in my arms.
I can't promise her that Luc will be fine when I don't know what's happening.

"I think...I think Daddy might die." She chokes out the words while clinging to me.

"How do you know this?"

She shrugs and scrunches her face miserably.
"He told me he loved me and to be good."

"You heard him say this?" I feel confused by her words.
She's so young, but then again, he is her birth father.
Hunters possess abilities others don't understand.

"Uh-huh."

I can't link with Luc mentally.
He refused pack bonds, making him unreachable except by phone.
"Have you tried talking to him?"

She nods.

"He hasn't said anything else?"

She shakes her head slowly.

"He told you about the fire?"

"No." She whimpers, her eyes locking with mine. "I felt it."

What does that mean?
How can she feel something happening hundreds of miles away?

"When did you hear him?"

"During breakfast." That explains why she suddenly lost her appetite and asked to walk to school alone.
"Is he with Theodore?"

She just shrugs.

"Let's go see Athena and Alexander at the new packhouse." I force a smile for her.

"Am I in trouble?"

"No, of course not. I just want you to tell them what you told me. Can you do that?"
"Yes, Daddy."

We walk across the grounds toward the pack house.
Lottie clings to me the entire way, refusing to be put down.
I can feel her fear and worry radiating from her small body.
It's more intense than what you normally sense from other children.
I'm certain she hasn't discovered her full range of abilities yet.
She still has a long way to go before she gains her Wolf.

I step into the packhouse, and Lottie finally relaxes enough to look around.
"Wow!"

Evrin and Logan come charging out from a side door, crashing into my legs just as Alexander appears.
"Boys, try not to knock him over." He pulls Logan from my leg and swings him up onto his shoulders.
"If you're looking for Evelyn, she's in there with Athena." He nods toward the office.

"Actually, we need to talk to both of you."

His eyes shift to Lottie. "She might be a while. Can you tell me?"

Lottie nods as I lower her to her feet.
"Daddy's in trouble. I think he might die."

"Luc," I add when Alexander cocks a brow at me.

"Let's get some ice cream." Alexander winks at her.
Lottie and Evrin immediately chase after him toward the kitchen.
I glance at the office door, hoping they were working things out inside.

Athena

His lips were rough yet soft against mine.
I pulled away abruptly.
He looked annoyed. Frustrated. Possibly even angry as he studied my face.
I couldn't be certain.
His hands dropped from my upper arms as he stepped back.
I had rejected an Alpha.
An Alpha who likely had never been rejected before.
What had I just done?

His crimson eyes lingered on my face until I lowered my gaze.
Mortification washed over me.
This wasn't how I imagined my first kiss would happen.

"Go!" he snapped, turning away toward his desk.
"Go where?" I whispered, fully expecting banishment from his pack.
"Out of my office!"

I paused at the door, wondering if I should apologize.
Glancing back, I found him focused on paperwork.
He flicked his hand dismissively, shooing me away.

Stepping into the hallway, I felt my cheeks burn with embarrassment.
"Are you alright?" a deep, curious voice asked.

Looking up, I recognized one of the men who had come to my brother's house with Alpha Alexander.
The more I studied him, the more I saw his resemblance to Isabella.
Same dark hair. Same dark eyes.

"We haven't properly met. I'm Julian." He smiled warmly.
"Alpha Alexander's brother?" I whispered as he approached.
He nodded. "And I believe you've met my twin as well."
"Isabella?" I hadn't realized they were twins, though it didn't really matter.

He leaned against the wall beside me. "That's her. Everything okay? You seem... flustered."
"Just tired," I lied, uncertain who to trust here.
I definitely wasn't sharing details with Alpha Alexander's brother.
"Trying to remember the way back to my room."

"I can show you." His dark eyes drifted down past my face before snapping back up.
I'd seen that look many times before, but never here. Only back home.

"You will do no such thing!" Alpha Alexander ripped the office door open.
"Shouldn't you be training right now?"

Julian frowned, raising his hands in surrender. "Just being friendly."
He mumbled the words but wore a smirk as he turned and walked away.

Alpha Alexander's crimson eyes settled on me.
"I love my brother, but I'd prefer you never be alone with him."
His tone had changed completely from earlier in his office.

I stared at him, confused.
He was the one who sent me away.
Was this some kind of test?
My brother and Beta Marcus used to test me constantly.
I should be used to it, but it always caught me off guard.

"Athena, if you have something to say, say it." Alpha Alexander pressed.

Hold your tongue. Don't say anything. It's a trick.
I shook my head, keeping my eyes lowered.

"You're tired?" He asked, not pushing for more information.
I nodded. Easiest answer.

"This way."

He walked ahead of me again, leading through the maze of hallways.
We climbed a flight of stairs before stopping at a familiar door.

"I shouldn't have kissed you. You were clearly surprised."
He moved into the bedroom as he spoke.
"Though I have control, Titan has a tendency to break through occasionally."

Who the hell is Titan?

"You're lucky I stopped him before he went further. I'm patient. He isn't."

"Titan?" I muttered.

"My wolf."

Now he made no sense at all.
How could his wolf be someone completely different?
###Chapter 0010

"Dominic's wolf had a name too, right?" He muttered under his breath as he stepped into the bedroom.

"No." I frowned, confusion clouding my thoughts as I tried to understand his question. "He never mentioned it... not once."

Alpha Alexander's crimson eyes locked onto mine. He believed I was lying—I could sense it in his intense gaze. I desperately wanted to look away but found myself trapped, unable to break eye contact. It felt as if he were compelling me to hold his stare without even touching me.

Could all Alphas do that, or was this unique to him?

My voice dropped to a hushed whisper. "I swear." I didn't know what else to say. "I'm... I'm telling the truth." I stammered while he continued piercing me with his stare.

"Okay." He muttered, though his tone suggested he didn't believe me.

"And I suppose, because of your binding, you never got to meet your Wolf?"

I shook my head. "They emerge when we turn thirteen. I know that much."

He frowned but remained silent. As he finally broke his gaze and looked away, my body relaxed momentarily—only to be hit by a searing, radiating pain from my stomach.

Ignoring the agony, I stayed still, watching Alpha Alexander pace around the bedroom. He seemed to be having a silent conversation with someone. Perhaps this Titan?

So many questions flooded my mind. Did Titan reside within him? What happened when he shifted? He mentioned control. Did Titan take over completely during the shift? From what I understood, shifters simply transformed—they didn't become entirely different beings.

As Alpha Alexander continued tracing a figure-eight pattern across the room, I pressed my hand against my stomach. Even through the fabric of my top, my skin burned as if on fire.

My heart raced wildly in my chest, reminiscent of when I first left Silver Creek. My palms grew clammy, and my mouth turned dry. I reached out to grip the bedpost, steadying myself to prevent my legs from buckling.

"It hurts." I whispered as the pain intensified.

"Athena?" He spun around to face me just as my legs gave out.

He caught me before I hit the floor, concern etched across his face as he lifted my top.

"Shit!"

I had never experienced such pain. All the beatings, all the punishments—they were nothing compared to this.

Alpha Alexander lifted me from the floor, cradling me with one arm under my knees and the other supporting my back. He rushed through the house and out into the cool evening air.

His feet pounded the ground as he moved with urgency. He slammed his back against the pack hospital door, nearly tearing it from its hinges as he forced his way inside.

"It's not what we initially thought." He shouted to Isabella as he laid me on a bed. "You need to examine this!"

He tugged up my top, ignoring my writhing in pain, and held me down so Isabella could get a clearer view.

He cupped my face with one large hand. "Look at me, Athena. Look at me and breathe."

Everything burned. My entire body felt like it was tearing itself apart.

"Is this what I think it is?" Isabella questioned.

"Yes." Alpha Alexander muttered, pinning my shoulders down.

"I'm sorry, Athena. This is going to hurt." Isabella called out.

"I can help." Another man spoke as another wave of pain shot through me.

"Hold her legs." Alpha Alexander instructed.

Something hot and sharp pressed into my stomach. I screamed, thrashing against the men restraining me. They were going to kill me.

Moments before darkness consumed me from the pain, I heard Alpha Alexander say, "A fucking blood tie."

Dottie repeated her words to Dane in the kitchen while waiting for her ice cream.

She closed her eyes as her long lashes brushed her cheeks. "It's dark. He needs a light. I think... Daddy is hiding." She shook her head and pressed her hands to her temples. "It hurts."

"You sense his soul?" Dane asked, confused. "From this distance?"

She shrugged. "Just a feeling."

Dane's gaze shifted to me. I had no answers. This was new, though she'd had bad feelings about Raven before.

"Is he still with Klaus?" I asked Dane. "You said they were together. I'll link him."

He raised a hand as his crimson eyes glazed over. Concern, annoyance, and anger flashed across his face.

"He's angry," Dottie whispered to me. She ate a spoonful of ice cream while watching Dane.

"They're alive," Dane finally said. "They escaped before the fire spread. Brax, Klaus and his mate, Xavi." His eyes met mine. "Silas's mate, Indy and her friend."

"Really?" Dottie asked. "They found Silas's friend?"

Dane nodded. "They fled into the sea."

"Deepwater," Dottie murmured.

Dane smiled. "They're hiding in a cove, waiting for the sea to calm. We must prepare for what follows them."

"What about her?" I avoided saying the name in front of Dottie. As Athena requested, I hadn't told Samara about her mother. I needed more information first, and didn't want Dottie accidentally revealing it. "I don't know. Klaus mentioned an incident but shared no details."

"Daddy will be okay?" Dottie asked.

"I can't promise that, Dorothy," Dane told her gently. "He's safe for now. He'll return home when possible."

She nodded and ate more melted ice cream. "I'm sorry school ended early."

"It's fine." I kissed her head, and she smiled.

"Can I play with the boys?" she asked hopefully.

"Of course," Dane said, helping the boys down from their chairs. They followed Dottie out, giggling as they chased her.

"What aren't you telling me?" I asked when we were alone.

"Indy is a half-breed. Half Wolf, half Witch, as Silas said. But she and Brax are blood-tied."

"Blood tie? What about Maddie? You said Indy is Silas's true mate."

He frowned. "I don't know. Maddie doesn't deserve this, but there must be a reason."

"It makes no sense. Why would he blood-tie himself to a Witch? After everything with Cooper and now Thalia."

"Your guess is as good as mine. Brax always operates on his own terms."

I glanced at the door where Dottie had left with the boys. "What did she mean about Brax turning on a light? Is this woman a threat?"

"She's not like Thalia. It sounds like she's helping them." He shook his head. "Dottie said something similar to Silas. She might mean something else, but we must prepare. This could be what draws Serkan out of hiding."
###Chapter 0011
Luc

We watch Athena as she stands at the edge of the cove. Water laps around her ankles while she takes a deep breath.

"I can't do this. I wasn't made for this."

"Try to focus," Theodore mutters, frowning at Xavi.

"I know you mean well, but telling someone to focus doesn't actually help them focus." She curls her hands into fists and stares out at the water. "Are you even sure it was me?"

"It only slowed when you were standing in the window. It didn't do that for anyone else."

"And it rose to catch you," Theodore adds.

"It did?" She sounds skeptical.

"Athena, you can do this. Just like when the walls were going to crush us."

"No pressure." She blows out her cheeks. "You want the sea to retreat, right?"

"Just enough so we can get around the side of the cliff."

She holds out a hand and gestures for me to come forward. 'Maybe the bond will help.' She links me.

Stepping into the water, I grab her outstretched hand. She takes a deep breath and closes her eyes. Nothing happens at first. As minutes pass, I wonder if I was wrong; maybe she hadn't stopped the crashing waves, but that would mean someone else had. I'm about to drop her hand when the sea begins to retreat from around my ankles, pulling back on itself as if being sucked out.

Looking at Athena, I see her golden eyes are wide with a slight glaze. Her brow is furrowed in concentration. Her soul is incredibly bright to look at, like someone just switched on their Christmas lights.

Souls were becoming more and more unpredictable.

The water continues to pull back until there is a gap of a couple of meters around the edge of the cliff.

"We need to move," Theodore mutters as he steps onto the wet sand.

Xavi glances at Athena as he trots past. Orion stares at her in frustration but follows the others.

'Keep doing what you are doing.' I mutter to Athena, 'I will guide you out of here.'

Tugging her forward, her footsteps are heavy, and she sways a little as if drunk.

We hurry along the sand, keeping as close to the cliff as possible. Looking back, I already see the water starting to break free, smashing against the cliff as if angrier than before. "Athena, we have to move."

She doesn't respond and appears completely zoned out.

The water was coming in faster and faster. If we didn't move, we were going to be stranded. Pulling her over my shoulder, she hangs there like a rag doll as I quicken my pace. Finally, I see our way out. Climbing up the sand bank, I put Athena on her feet, steadying her just as the waves completely break free, crashing around the edge of the cliffs and sending a spray over us.

"I did it?" Athena asks as she rubs her eyes. "We are free?"

"Not yet. We still need to make it to Obsidian Howl."

She nods and looks around. "Where are the others?"

"Good question."

We were alone, standing at the bottom of the cliff that leads up to the Witch. Madame Zora must be pissed, or she was confident we didn't survive. I can't wait to see her face when she sees we are fine. Athena's hand tightens around my wrist as a van approaches.

"It's okay, Theodore is driving."

Her grip on me loosens as she sighs. "Good, because I'm not going back to that Witch ever again."

"You may not, but she is coming for us."

"Are you certain?"

"We just royally fucked her off. The moment she realises that we are alive, she is going to come looking for us."

She glances up at the cliff top. "I wish we could have helped Sophia."

I cock a brow at her, "She pushed you, and you still want to help her?"

"She was confused and angry. We don't know when she last got to see someone that wasn't Madame Zora. You saw what Madame Zora did to all those people. You've seen what she has done to Julian. All the crap has probably made Sophia be like this." "How can you be so forgiving?"

"If I believed everyone was as bad as you make them out to be, it wouldn't be worth living. I have to have some hope." She gives me a smile as the van stops a few meters from us. "Otherwise, the world is just dark."

Orion slides back the door and holds a hand out for Athena. He hadn't looked at her the same since he had learned what she was capable of. She thanks him and takes a seat, "Coming?"

I climb in after her, and she shuffles over, making room for me.

"Let's go." Theodore snaps, turning the van around and speeding us away from the madhouse.

Athena sleeps a lot on the way to Obsidian Howl while Orion, Theodore and I take turns driving. Xavi watches Athena with interest. It wasn't quite the same look as before. He was more relaxed, and now, it appeared he was curious. "He's confused," Theodore tells me when Xavi finally switches off.

"Because of the Witch thing?"

"He's a lot like you. Act first, think later." He smirks, "But he was also raised like you. He is a Witch Hunter his job is to snuff out Witches. Every single one he has come across has been like Madame Zora, and Athena is different from what he is used to."

"I get it. It's the equivalent of me accepting some Lycans."

"Exactly. Give him a break. He has been stuck in Wolf form for a long time. His hatred has grown over that time."

"What about you? You haven't exactly had good experiences with Witches." I ask

"I grew up not knowing what I was, never understanding why I didn't fit in. But I guess that helped me look at the good and bad in people.

People like Madame Zora and Levi Bennett are just dark all the way through.

However, there are others that fight between doing the right thing for others or the right thing for themselves."

"Point taken."

"And Athena has done the right thing over and over."

I glance over my shoulder at her. She has curled herself up into a ball as Orion drapes a blanket over her.

"Her soul is bright. Like the brightest I have seen in a long time. But when she was focussed, the brightness became like nothing I have ever seen." I tell Luc. "There were no clouds." He mutters

"What?"

"Magic leaves behind a trail, well, that's what Xavi told me. I learned to see it. The river outside Silver Streams could be crossed, but you had to find the remnants of magic. Sophia's prison cell was cloaked in it. Above Silver Streams, it was dark."

"Okay."

"Athena doesn't have that. There were no traces of magic left with the sea. There were no traces when she ripped a hole in the stone wall."

"What does that mean?"

He shrugs at me. "I'm still trying to figure it out."

"Maybe now that we are all in one place. We can figure it out together. We are here."

"Where?" Athena mumbles sleepily.

"Obsidian Howl."

Alexander

“Did anyone know?” I demand, watching my unconscious mate. She was completely out, likely for hours. Isabella had stitched her up after confirming the blood tie was severed and Athena’s system was flooded with medication.

Someone will pay for this. Titan growls.

“No,” Sebastian replies. “If Athena had a mate, she wouldn’t have left Silver Creek so easily.”

“But she didn’t leave, did she? She collapsed right at the door.”

“I thought that was because she’d never been outside. You said it was fear and sickness.”

I turn to see him leaning against the wall, studying me. He was the only one I trusted with the truth about Titan sensing Athena as our mate.

“Maybe he was close by.” He shrugs as my gaze shifts to my sister.

She was staring into her coffee, trying to stay unnoticed. But the silence told me she knew something. That girl could never stay quiet for long.

“Out with it!” I snap.

‘Why does it always have to be Isabella?’ Titan prowls in my mind. He wanted to confront her wolf, Midnight.

“I don’t know anything.” Isabella keeps her eyes down.

“Isabella! I almost killed her by kissing her because of that damned blood tie! A blood tie only exists if her mate is still alive.”

“Alright, alright. No need to go full Alpha on me. She had a mate. All I know is he rejected her.”

“Are you sure?”

She nods.

“Did she accept?”

“I don’t know. I’m sorry, talking about it made me think of Gabriel, okay? I started venting about why he rejected me! If I had known this was the reason, I would’ve asked more.”

“Come on, Alexander, you know she’s telling the truth.” Sebastian mutters. He moves beside me and looks through the window at Athena. “I’m more curious how she knew she was mated.”

“What?”

“You said she was bound, right?” Sebastian frowns.

I hadn’t considered that. I was too focused on the blood tie. “She shouldn’t have been able to scent him.” I mutter. “How did she know?”

Sitting by Athena’s bedside, I watch her silently, choosing my words carefully. There was much to unravel, though I knew it would be too much for her to handle all at once.

Under the hospital lights, she looked better. Her skin was less pale, her eyes less hollow.

Isabella comes in regularly to check on her and the fresh stitches. Each time, she apologizes, saying she never meant to keep it secret. She hadn’t thought it important.

In her words, who creates a blood tie after rejecting their mate? That just adds to my questions for Athena.

It’s nearly one in the morning when her eyes open.

She groans, trying to sit up, then freezes when she sees me. “I’m sorry.”

“What for?”

Her blue eyes dart around the room. “I caused trouble. I didn’t mean to… Ow.” She holds her stomach and lies back down.

“Isabella stitched you up. It’ll be sore for a while.”

Tears well in her eyes. “Am I in trouble?”

“Why didn’t you tell me?”

“The pain came on so fast.”

“No, Athena. I mean about your mate. Why didn’t you tell me you were already mated?”

She bites her lip, closing her eyes. “He rejected me. He forced me to accept it. He…” She hesitates, peering at me through slitted eyes.
###Chapter 0012

“He hurt you?” I finish her thought.

She gives a slight nod, confirming it.

“Who did this?”

“Beta Marcus.” Her voice is barely a whisper.

‘But she belongs to us now, right?’ Titan panics internally.

‘Let me handle this!’ I snap back at him.

“How did you know that bastard was your mate?” I watch her expression closely.

“I’m not sure. I could smell him.” She grimaces. “He was the first person I’d scented since childhood. I don’t understand how or why. But he was furious. Disgusted.” Athena hugs herself, staring at the ceiling lights. “He despised me, and I suffered for it.”

‘She could scent him?’ Titan mutters. ‘How is that possible if she was bound?’

‘I’m getting to that if you’d just shut up for five minutes.’

“How old were you then?”

“It was my eighteenth birthday.” Her voice remains quiet, followed by a sigh.

“And he was the one who did this to you?”

She glances at her stomach and shakes her head. “Luna Victoria... I think.” She pauses, pressing her lips into a thin line. “Was it badly infected?”

“Don’t worry about that now. It’s been taken care of. It’ll heal properly this time.”

I stand up, about to tell her to rest, but curiosity gets the better of me. “Why could you scent him?”

“I don’t know. I swear.” She shakes her head. “They bound me again after that incident. I haven’t been able to heal properly since.”

I want to push for more answers, but she looks exhausted despite all the rest she’s had.

“Get some sleep. I’ll be back in the morning.”

Leaving the hospital, I find Sebastian waiting outside, just as I asked.

“Is she awake?”

I nod. “She answered some questions. But I’m letting her rest until morning. Sebastian, she’s been bound not once, but twice.”

“Twice? Are you certain?” He looks puzzled.

“She told me herself.”

“She must carry powerful Alpha blood if they bound her twice.”

“She might be even more powerful than Dominic. What other reason would they have to treat her this way besides fear? Why else would they frame her for her parents’ deaths?”

I don’t sleep. Athena had only spent one night in my bed, but it already feels strange without her here. By six in the morning, I’m back at her bedside in the hospital. Watching. Waiting for her to wake up.

She groans first, stretching slightly before opening her eyes. I see the panic flash across her face before she remembers where she is.

“Hospital?” she whispers, seeking confirmation.

“Yes.” I watch as she pushes herself up, ignoring the pain. I wonder how many times she’s had to do that while living in Silver Creek. If Dominic and the others ever gave her a break. If they ever left her alone for even a single night.

Athena lifts her top, studying her stitches with a frown. “She made the wound bigger.” She mumbles.

“Isabella had to. Sometime between Victoria injuring you and me bringing you here. Marcus blood-tied himself to you.”

“He what?” she asks, confused. She really doesn’t know much about our kind.

“Blood tie. It can be a mate thing. But it doesn’t have to be.”

“I... I accepted. H...he wanted me to accept the rejection. I did.” She stutters.

“I think because you were still bound to some degree, the rejection didn’t work properly. Or at least not how it should have.”

‘She’s our mate!’ Titan roars in my head. ‘He’s not having her. I won’t allow it. I’ll destroy the entire Silver Creek pack if it means she stays with us!’

‘Trust me, she’s not going back to them.’

Athena

"Are they back?" I ask as the boys scramble off me. "Did they arrive safely?"

Alexander nods with a brief smile that vanishes quickly. "Theodore reported an uneventful journey. No complications."

"That worries you, doesn't it?" I observe him closely.

He leans down, pressing his lips to my cheek. "After everything we've endured, simplicity feels suspicious."

"Any signs of being followed?"

He shakes his head. "Only time will reveal that. Now, are you going to share what you and Evelyn discussed, or must I delve into that mind of yours?" He pulls me up from the chair. "I'll explain later."

The boys circle us excitedly as Alexander maneuvers the pram. He keeps shooting me sideways glances, clearly struggling. "You find this amusing? They should design these for taller men."

He's hunched over, his large frame making the pram look like a child's toy.

I shake my head, smiling. "Should we have left the girls with someone? You mentioned Theodore and Luc weren't alone."

"Would Luc risk bringing anyone here if he sensed danger?"

"I suppose not..." My words trail off as van headlights approach the gates. I'd missed Theodore. Despite his frequent pack duties, his absence always felt noticeable. Besides Alexander, he was among the first to earn my trust.

The van stops abruptly. Theodore jumps out with a radiant smile. His eyes meet mine, and I immediately sense a change. His long hair is gone, but his entire presence feels... different.

Luc exits next, sliding the van door open. A white Wolf leaps out, followed by a man with intense blue eyes. Luc turns back, offering his hand to someone else. The woman—Silas's true mate—emerges with her face lowered. Her hair is whiter than paper, something I've never seen on a Wolf.

"Congratulations," Luc mutters, eyeing the girls as the boys tackle Theodore. "Those two will keep you occupied."

The three strangers hang back, watching us with visible anxiety. The white-haired woman especially can't tear her eyes from Alexander.

"Athena, this is Xavi. My mate." Theodore gestures to the white Wolf. "Thalia cursed him years ago. He's trapped in this form."

"He's also a Witch Hunter," Luc adds.

"This is Orion. He can't speak. Thalia removed his tongue." Theodore continues, ignoring Luc. "And this—"

'The half-Witch.' Nyx whispers.

"It seems Thalia has managed to anger everyone in some way." Alexander frowns.

Indy continues staring intensely at Alexander.

"He's his twin," Luc murmurs, moving toward her.

"I know." Her voice drops to a whisper. "It's startling how identical they look." She keeps staring. "I see you're not Silas." She scans the area. "Is he here?"

"Yes," Alexander confirms. "Though he's under some kind of enchantment."

"I know." She sighs heavily. "I'd hoped distance from Silver Streams might break it."

"He's trying. He knows the truth now, but he keeps forgetting."

Her golden eyes suddenly brighten as she looks past us. "Silas!" she shrieks, charging across the grounds. She hurls herself at an approaching Silas, wrapping her arms around him tightly. "Oh, I've missed you so much!"

'Alexander didn't tell her Silas doesn't remember her.' Nyx mutters.

Silas looks at us with confusion, keeping his arms wide as if afraid to touch her.

"Silas, it's me, it's Indy." She pleads with him.

"You're the half-breed from Silver Streams," he states blankly. "You're just a teenager. How did you get here?"

'That memory charm is incredibly potent.' Nyx sighs.

Like me, Nyx had hoped Indy might break through whatever hold Thalia had on him. But whatever magic she'd used, it was powerful.

"Do you see it?" Theodore whispers to his mate, Xavi.

"See what?" Alexander asks.

Theodore sighs deeply. "The curse on him is powerful. A dark cloud hovers above him."
###Chapter 0013

My gaze remains fixed on Silas.

He stands motionless as Indy clings to him desperately.

But I detect no dark cloud surrounding him.

"A dark cloud? You mean like the darkness that consumes some Lycans?"

Theodore shakes his head slowly.

"This is different. It stems from dark magic. Xavi carries one." He gestures above his own head.

"Leaving helped you, didn't it?" I ask softly.

He looks toward his new mate, a smile gradually forming.

"It was the best decision I ever made." His hand strokes the white fur absently.

Xavi nudges his head against Theodore's leg.

"Now we just need to eliminate the Witch to break the curse."

"What about them?" Alexander points toward Indy and Silas.

She still hasn't released him.

"I'll handle this," Luc scowls.

He starts toward them but pauses abruptly.

"Where's Hannah?"

"Probably with Seraphina in the gardens," I inform him.

"Hannah seems to keep Seraphina out of trouble."

He nods and turns back to the pair.

"Will you remain here?" I ask Theodore.

He glances at Xavi.

"For now. This curse must be broken."

"She deserves to die," Alexander growls.

Theodore rolls his eyes.

"Xavi agrees, in the most dramatic way possible."

"That can be arranged." Alexander smiles and winks at me.

"Indy, release him." Luc commands sharply.

"If I let go, I might never hug him again." Indy sobs.

"What happens when he recognizes you? You're blood-tied to me now. Nothing can happen until we resolve that."

"What?!"

I spin around to see Hannah and Seraphina.

Pain etches across Hannah's face.

Her eyes widen.

Her bottom lip trembles.

A single tear traces down her cheek.

"You blood-tied yourself to someone else?" Her voice cracks.

Seraphina wraps a protective arm around Hannah's shoulders.

"Hannah, can we discuss this privately?"

"You won't even mark me, yet you willingly blood-tied yourself to another. Why, Luc? I thought... I thought we were rebuilding. Is it because she's a Wolf? Is she better than me?"

"I haven't slept with her." Luc snaps. "You weren't there, Hannah. It was life or death."

She opens her mouth to speak but stops.

She shakes her head slowly.

She backs away.

"Hannah!"

Seraphina leaves with her.

Luc hurries after them.

"Whenever Luc is involved, drama follows," Theodore mutters to Xavi.

"At least he's not killing anyone," Alexander mutters with a smirk.

I watch as Orion pulls Indy away from Silas.

"Twins," Theodore confirms, nodding at Xavi.

I dislike hearing only one side of their conversation.

It must be difficult for Xavi to communicate solely through Theodore.

"Lycans," I add, assuming Xavi inquired about the boys.

I glance at my sons.

They're casually attempting to reach Alexander's pockets, likely searching for snacks.

Evrin has grown significantly this past week.

He now stands several inches taller than his brother.

He's developing at an accelerated rate.

He even appears older.

His round baby face has vanished.

Yet Logan shows no signs of shifting.

It shouldn't concern me, but it does.

Especially when I watch Evrin shift almost every night.

Why can one twin shift now while the other cannot?

Must Logan wait until he turns thirteen?

"Theodore, why don't you take our guests to your place?" Alexander suggests.

Alexander waits until they depart before wrapping his arms around me.

"Stop worrying. You told me it's normal for Lycans to shift at thirteen. Look at them. Evrin is your miniature copy. He shifted early, following his mother's path."

"I know, but..."

"If Logan reaches thirteen and it doesn't happen, then we'll investigate." He presses his lips to my cheek.

Confident and unphased.

I can't pinpoint it, but something feels off regarding the boys.

Brianna calls it 'mother's intuition.'

My mind reeled from the overload of information.
First the Wolfsbane Toxin and the pack runs.
Now a blood tie and still being partially mated to Beta Marcus.

I flicked my gaze up to Alpha Alexander.
He was staring directly at me.
I immediately lowered my eyes.

“I swear,” I whispered again. “I swear I don’t understand what you mean.”

“That’s the most infuriating part, Athena. I know you have no idea what I’m talking about.”

I wanted to ask why he was so angry.
I kept the question to myself.

“I never want to be near Beta Marcus again,” I mumbled.
From my peripheral vision, I saw his expression soften.
The corners of his lips almost hinted at a smile.

“Good. I have no plans to return you to him.” He stood from his chair. “Isabella says you’re cleared to leave the hospital. Can you walk, or should I carry you?”

“I can walk,” I muttered.

I slid out of the bed and straightened up.
A sharp, searing pain instantly tore through my abdomen.

“Are you certain?” Alpha Alexander asked.

I nodded.
I had endured worse.
I had worked through worse.
But he looked almost disappointed that I was creating distance between us.

He allowed me to set the pace.
He didn’t speak even when I stopped from the intense pain.
They said healing would take time.
How much time was that?

I paused again and glanced back.
I was only fifteen meters from the hospital entrance.
The pack house still seemed miles away.

Alpha Alexander stepped in front of me. “Let me assist you.”

“It’s… I can manage.”

“Athena.” His calloused fingers gently lifted my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze. “Your pain is evident. Please, allow me to help.”

He used that tone.
The one that left no room for argument.
Reluctantly, I nodded.
He immediately swept me into his arms.

He carried me through the house and into the bedroom.
He seemed pleased with himself.
He didn’t set me on my feet.
He placed me directly into the bed.

“As I mentioned, healing will take time. Blood ties are difficult to break. The pain you feel will likely intensify.”
“Intensify?” It couldn’t possibly get worse.

He sat beside me.
His crimson eyes locked onto mine.
A shiver raced down my spine.
“Typically, yes. But given your unawareness of the tie and your ongoing connection… I’m unsure how it will impact you.”

“Why would he do this? Why would Marcus create a blood tie after forcing his rejection on me?”

“That is what I am still determining. And stop calling him Beta. He has forfeited that title. Your brother never deserved to be an Alpha either.”

I was a nobody.
Using their titles was my duty.
Addressing them by name was disrespectful.

“Tell me something. When you discovered he was your mate… did you hope it would improve your situation?”

I shook my head, vividly recalling the hatred in Marcus’s eyes. “It was a living nightmare.”

“Did your brother know?”

I shook my head again. “I don’t believe so.”

Alpha Alexander simply nodded.
He suddenly reached a hand toward me.
I flinched.
I hadn’t flinched in years.
I had learned to control it.
Flinching always resulted in a worse beating.

Alpha Alexander paused.
He slowly reached into my hair and plucked something out.
He showed me a small feather.

“Get some rest. I will check on you later.” He activated a screen on the wall opposite the bed and handed me the remote. “I’m sure you can find something to watch.”

I lacked the energy to tell him I had never watched television.
It would only make my life sound more pitiful.

Alone, I slowly got out of bed.
I moved to one of the large windows.
I sat in the big, comfortable chair, trying to ignore the pain in my stomach.

I sat there, turning over everything I had been told.
None of it made sense.
Why would Marcus continue to beat me if he knew we were still connected?
Unless that was precisely why.
Was he so revolted by our bond?
Then why force a blood tie?
What did he hope to gain from it?

I watched as Alpha Alexander appeared outside.
He walked with a sense of purpose.
Moments later, Julian and Sebastian approached from another direction.
They met Alpha Alexander almost directly in front of my window.

The three of them had a brief, intense conversation.
Then they vanished into the trees, disappearing from sight.
I wondered where they were going.
I kept watching, waiting for them to return.
###Chapter 0014

"You should be resting in bed, not slumped in that chair." Alpha Alexander's voice was low as he lifted me effortlessly. He carried me back to the mattress and tucked the blanket around me. I struggled to sit up again.

"Sleep is what you need to heal." His hands pressed gently on my shoulders, urging me back down.

"No." I resisted, pushing against his firm hold. "Something isn't right."

"I already told you the pain from your injury will linger."

"Not that." My words were slurred with exhaustion. My thoughts felt tangled and slow. "It's a trick." I mumbled, fighting to stay conscious. "I think it's all a trick."

"A trick?"

I managed a weak nod, my eyelids heavy. I was battling sleep just to share my suspicion with him.

"Rest now. We can discuss this when you're stronger." His tone left no room for argument.

When I woke later, I forced myself out of bed immediately. I wouldn't let drowsiness claim me before I could explain.

I splashed cold water on my face and studied my reflection. My blue eyes seemed clearer now. My skin had lost its sickly pallor.

"You're awake." Alpha Alexander's voice made me jump. I hadn't heard him enter.

He moved behind me, his crimson eyes locking onto mine in the mirror. I could feel the heat radiating from his body.

"How are you feeling?" His hands settled on my hips.

My temperature spiked instantly. A flush crept up my neck and warmed my cheeks. His fingers slid under my top, dipping inside the waistband of my pants. They edged lower, brushing the line of my panties. His lips found my neck, and a soft moan escaped me. "Athena?"

My eyes flew open. Alpha Alexander was standing over me, not touching me at all.

"You really should be sleeping in the bed, not the chair." he stated flatly.

It was just a dream. Only a dream. But the dream couldn't mask the scent of my arousal now hanging in the air. I squeezed my thighs together tightly.

"Do you need help?" he asked.

"No!" My reply was too sharp, too loud. He raised an eyebrow.

"I was merely offering to help you back to the bed." A faint smirk played on his lips. He could definitely smell it.

I dropped my gaze. "I prefer it here. I like to watch." I muttered, desperate to change the subject. "It's different."

"Different?"

"You don't demand anything from me. You let me sleep as long as I need. The food... Everything. It's just different." I couldn't find better words, but he nodded anyway. "Not every Alpha is a monster." He said this while pulling a red shirt over his head, replacing his black tee.

He turned back to face me, fastening the buttons. My initial observation was correct. No ink. Not a single tattoo marred his skin. It was unusual. Every wolf in Silver Creek was covered in them. "Yes?" he prompted.

"Nothing."

"Athena, I haven't known you long, but I know when you have a question. Ask it."

"You have no tattoos."

"That's not a question." "Why?"

"They're not for me. Others use them to show dominance or pack loyalty. But I'm certain you'll agree I don't need them." He pointed to his own intense crimson eyes. "These are enough to show my place in this world." He was right. I'd never seen another wolf with eyes like his. Though I'd initially thought it was some kind of trick—contacts or magic.

"Trick." I said the word louder this time.

"I can assure you these are my real eyes."

"No." I shook my head. "No, I was thinking about everything you told me before I fell asleep. The blood tie. The fact that I'm still partly mated."

His eyes narrowed slightly at the term 'partly mated.'

"What if it is a trick? You said a blood tie lets a mate move freely in another's pack. Isabella told me no one has heard of Silver Creek. You said the blood tie is new."

He just stared, listening.

"You told me your other brides were snooping. I haven't." I added, meeting his gaze. "Could they get in undetected because of the blood tie with me?"

It was the most I'd said at once since arriving.

"It's a good theory, but no. You would need to be an official member of my pack for that to work."

"Official? You mean if you mark me?" I asked quietly. He'd mentioned it before but never elaborated.

"If I mark you." Alpha Alexander confirmed. "But I can't do that while you have a mate out there. You think the blood tie pain is bad? It's nothing compared to being marked by one Alpha while mated to another. It would kill you."

Luc

"Hannah, wait!"

Seraphina shoots me a venomous glare. She places both hands on Hannah's shoulders, physically preventing her from turning around as she pushes her forward. "Hannah!"

"Back off, traitor." Seraphina snaps as I quickly close the distance between us.

"You're one to talk. This," I gesture sharply between myself and Hannah, "is none of your business."

"She's my friend. How could you be so heartless?"

"You're questioning my cruelty? That's a fucking joke, Lone Wolf?" I deliberately throw her old nickname back at her.

Her eyes lock onto mine with fierce intensity. "Don't call me that."

"Isn't that what everyone called you?" I retort with a sneer.

"Let's just go," Seraphina mutters to Hannah.

Hannah keeps her gaze averted until I step directly into her path. Her chestnut eyes briefly meet mine before darting to something behind me. Her face is already flushed and blotchy from trying to hold back tears. I expected this reaction. No one wants to discover their mate has bound themselves to someone else.

"Seraphina, get lost. Let us talk privately."

"Not happening. She needs a friend right now," Seraphina snaps back.

I'm certain she wouldn't be so bold if I had a gun pressed to her temple. Apparently, she's grown too comfortable during my absence.

Bare hands can be just as effective as a weapon.

"Should I remind you that playing happy families here doesn't erase what you did to mine?"

"Athena isn't-"

"Athena isn't here." I stare her down coldly. "Don't try pulling the sibling card either. I already know whose side she'd take." Her expression hardens. "You wouldn't dare."

"Are you certain you want to test that theory?" I muse darkly.

"Stop. Please just stop," Hannah whispers pleadingly. "Seraphina, it's alright. You can go. I'll catch up with you later."

"Are you sure about this?"

"Yes, she is." I snap impatiently.

Hannah gives a slight nod. "I'll be okay."

"I'll be watching. The front door to Caleb's place is right there."

Hannah takes a deep breath as Seraphina stomps away, arms swinging angrily. It's strange seeing her care about someone other than herself.

"You didn't have to be so harsh with her. She's trying."

"Trying with everyone else." I shake my head in frustration. "You need to understand I can never forgive what she did to my family or the danger she put my child in. I only tolerate her because I was asked to. But if she crosses that line, nothing will stop me." She crosses her arms over her chest, staring at me for a long moment before dropping her gaze. Her red waves cascade around her face as she bends to retie her shoelace. "Why did you bind yourself to that woman?"

"It was a life or death situation."

She straightens up, nodding slowly. "You said that already. It doesn't explain why. Couldn't she heal? Were you trying to keep her alive?"

"We were trapped with walls closing in. We were being watched and couldn't discuss anything. The only solution was to link minds, which required the blood tie. We would have been crushed if I hadn't calmed her. It helped her access her abilities."

She nods, her eyes narrowing as she looks directly at me. "Do you like her?"

"She's been helpful, and her soul is-"

"That's not what I asked, Luc. Do you, Lucas Adler, like her?"

"She's mated to Julian. You're mated to me."

"Yet you refuse to mark me. I know you hesitate because I'm Lycan. You think you shouldn't be with me."

"I haven't believed that for a long time."

She rolls her eyes dismissively. "I don't think that's true. You never considered a blood tie with me, but you did it with her without hesitation. I don't understand why. Did I do something wrong? Are you that angry about my Lycan side? I can't even shift." Her eyes glisten with unshed tears.

"It's not... it was the only option. You've done nothing wrong, I promise."

She shakes her head. "I know you, Luc. You can talk your way out of anything. You have this way with words that either infuriates people or makes perfect sense. But you're avoiding the one question I need answered. Like you can't answer it. Or won't."

I frown deeply. "I don't know anymore."

Her eyes widen. "What does that mean?"

"The blood tie does strange things. I can't fully explain it. I just know I need to keep Indy safe and unharmed. I feel compelled to protect her from Xavi. I want to understand her unusual bright soul, but if you're asking if I want to sleep with her, the answer is no. That thought never crossed my mind. She isn't mine. You are."

"From what I understand, the blood tie didn't work that way for Athena. So why is it affecting you like this?"

"Athena came from darkness. It was never going to work the same for her. My tie with Indy was consensual."

She hunches her shoulders. "Are you going to break the tie?"

"That's the plan."

"Then will you mark me?"

When I don't respond immediately, she punches my chest and stomps off toward Seraphina, who smirks at me triumphantly.

"That looked productive," Zachary comments as he emerges from the trees.

"She's angry about the blood tie with Julian's mate."

"Caleb mentioned it. Knowing you, I assume it was your only survival option. Though I'm curious what you would've done if you'd already marked Hannah?"

"I guess we'll never know."

"She has every right to be angry."

"I know that." I tut in frustration. "I see her soul. I know she's hurt and frustrated, but she'd be more devastated if those walls had crushed us. Seraphina isn't helping the situation." I watch Seraphina embrace Hannah. They disappear into the house without a backward glance.

"While I agree Seraphina has issues, she didn't create Hannah's feelings. Those existed before her."

I shake my head. This wasn't a discussion for anyone but Hannah. "What were you doing in the forest?"

"Setting traps. If you go in there, don't venture more than a mile out. You might not return."

"Things are getting serious."

"Things have been serious for a long time."
###Chapter 0015
Zachary

"Need a drink?" I ask, noticing Luc's attention fixed on Caleb's property.

"Sure," he sighs heavily. "She won't talk to me for a while anyway."

He trails me inside and perches on the kitchen counter.

I slide a glass toward him. "Lottie is changing. She's maturing faster than expected. Where is she now?"

"At a friend's house. She'll be back soon." I study him carefully. "It's more than just growing up, Luc. I know you're a Hunter, and that's what's awakening in her. But she constantly surprises me. Lottie perceives things differently than we do. She feels things on another level. Significant events occurred during your absence."

He raises an eyebrow. "Has she mentioned souls? Can she actually see them clearly?"

"Not exactly," I shake my head. "It seems deeper than that. She was the one who realized Julian had another mate besides Genevieve. She sensed his mind was clouded." I hesitate, considering whether to continue. "And?"

"She heard you! Lottie knew you were trapped by fire. She knew you were in the ocean. She mentioned something about turning on a light."

"A light?"

"She said something similar to Julian. Is she referring to the darkness inside us?"

He shakes his head slowly, forehead creasing. "Unlikely, but I did tell her I loved her and to behave for you." His frown deepens, matching what Lottie described. "Our survival odds were slim. I wasn't sure she'd hear me, but I had to say it anyway."

"Did you mention the fire or water?"

He shakes his head.

"Then how did she know?"

"It's her nature."

"That's your explanation? The entire episode threw her into full panic mode. The school called me while other children were sent home."

He jumps off the counter, pulls out a chair, and collapses into it. His fingers drum nervously on the wooden table as he stares into space.

"You anticipated this, didn't you?" I press.

"I wasn't certain what to expect. Not long ago, I believed I'd never see my daughter again, and I'm not referring to Silver Streams. But this was inevitable eventually. Being around all these Lycans probably triggered it. Similar to how it triggered me when I was younger."

"Yet she doesn't have issues with most of us. Is this related to her mother? You said Lottie's mother was a Hunter like you, but you never discuss her. Was she like you? A Rogue Hunter? Could she see souls like you, or was she more like Lottie? Or something entirely different?"

"It's complicated."

"Right. And I suppose you won't share that information either?"

His lips press into a tight line, making his silence unmistakable.

"Luc, I don't even know your first mate's name. Lottie has questions I can't answer. Questions only you can address."

His hazel eyes flash up to mine. I've struck a nerve, perhaps more than one.

"You can't ignore this forever. She isn't a Lycan, and she isn't an ordinary Wolf. You're the only one in this pack who can explain her unique nature. You can't keep avoiding this."

"Don't you think I know that?" he frowns deeply.

"You don't act like it."

He rolls his eyes dismissively. "You don't get to lecture me."

"I do when she calls me Daddy!" I snap impatiently. "I invited you here to clear the air and find ways to help that little girl. But for some reason, when it comes to her, you bury your head in the sand."

"I do not!"

"Oh really?"

"I know what I'm doing," he insists.

"Is she broken? Is that why you keep your distance? You're afraid of losing her."

He glares at me with intense hostility.

"She had a terrible start in life, Luc. She's witnessed things most don't see until their teenage years. It makes sense that her soul might be damaged."

"Our souls don't break."

"What?" I scoff incredulously. "What are you talking about? You've made it clear they do. You've said too many fractures can tear someone apart, like what nearly happened to Athena."

Alexander

She had spoken more than usual.
Athena was normally quiet, rarely saying more than a few words.
Perhaps she was finally starting to feel comfortable around me.

‘You still haven’t told her we can sense her desire.’ Titan murmured.

I don’t need to. She’s smart enough to figure it out herself. Her flushed skin gave her away.’ I could feel his desperation to claim her, to make her ours.
But we faced a new obstacle. Marcus.

If I marked her now, I would have to watch her die.
Her body would burn from the inside out.
The pain would be unbearable for her.
I may be ruthless, but the Moon Goddess’s laws were truly merciless.

Her eyes lingered on my face, slightly unfocused.
I knew she was fighting back tears as my words replayed in her mind.

Out of all my chosen brides, she was the only one who truly surprised me.

‘Because she isn’t brainwashed like the others.’ Titan observed.

No, but her knowledge of our world is limited.’ I replied silently as Athena wiped away a stray tear.

“Are you sending me back?” She whispered.

“Why would I do that?”

“Y-you said you couldn’t mark me.”

“Not yet. I can’t mark you yet.” I stood up and turned away. “Get more rest, Athena. It will help you heal faster.”

“Are you leaving?”

“I need to consult someone about removing your bindings. You won’t be alone. Sebastian and Isabella will be here if you need anything.”

I met my brother in the foyer.
He raised an eyebrow at me. “A bit dressed up for a witch meeting.”

“She insisted on a public location.” I glanced at his casual attire. “I don’t want unnecessary attention. You should change.”

He returned ten minutes later in a grey shirt and dark jeans.
“Better.” I muttered.

Our driver stood waiting by the limousine.
I gave him the restaurant name and he nodded.

“Do you really think she can help us?” Julian asked as the door closed.

“It’s worth trying. Even if she can’t, she might know someone who can help Athena.”

“You really care about this one, don’t you?”

My gaze sharpened.
He knew better than to comment on my interests.

He mimed zipping his lips and throwing away the key.

The restaurant was lively and crowded.
We were led to a table where an older woman already sat, sipping a martini.
Her gold bracelets jingled with every movement.
A purple scarf covered her hair, matching her long dress.

“Alpha Alexander.” She smiled. “It’s been too long.”

“Madame Zora. Thank you for meeting us.” I noticed her empty glass and offered another drink.

“No need, but tell your brother to sit. He’s drawing too much attention.”

JULIAN! I mind-linked him.
He quickly slid into the booth.

“Now tell me about this girl.” Madame Zora requested.

“She’s my chosen bride, as I mentioned.”

“Yes, but why consult me? Did you choose a human?”

“No, she’s definitely a Wolf. Her abilities have been bound.”

“Twice.” Julian added.

“Twice?” Madame Zora leaned back. “Do you think I’m involved?”

“Not at all. I hoped you might know how to unbind her.”

“There is a way, but it’s difficult. Why was she bound?”

I lowered my voice. “Accused of killing her parents at age six. Bound again when they discovered she could scent her mate.”

She tapped her long nails on the table.
Then she smiled. “Strong Alpha blood must run in her veins. You want her to have her wolf to break the mate bond?”

“It’s more complicated, but yes.”

She studied me intently. “It can be done, but it won’t be free.”

“Name your price.”

She leaned forward, rubbing her knuckles. “One million.”

Julian choked on his drink, spraying the table. “Bro, you can’t be serious! Not for some girl. You can find another mate.”

“Silence!” I snapped.

Locking eyes with Madame Zora, I nodded. “Done. Unbind her and you’ll get your money.”

She nodded and stood. “One more thing, Alpha Alexander. Which pack is she from?”

“Silver Creek.”

She froze.
Color drained from her tanned face. “The deal is off, Alpha Alexander. I wish you luck, but I can’t help you.” She retreated into the crowd and vanished.
###Chapter 0016

"Damn witches. They don't even have a scent to track." Julian muttered under his breath.

"That's your main concern right now?" I snapped. "Thank the moon you weren't born first. Did you see her reaction when I mentioned Silver Creek? Something's deeply wrong with that pack."

"What's our move then?"

"I need to speak with Sebastian." I tossed cash onto the table for our drinks and strode toward the car. "Take us home," I commanded the driver.

"Relax." Julian flashed me an amused grin. "Don't take it out on him because you're pissed off."

He moved to enter the limo but I grabbed him, slamming him against the vehicle's side. "Shut the fuck up!"

"Why are you so triggered by this one? What makes her different?"

He slid into his seat while I took mine. His eyes locked with mine. "She's the one, isn't she? You finally found your mate."

I remained silent. Right now, I couldn't predict when I'd be able to claim her as mine. If her pack never returned home, how would we eliminate Marcus and sever their bond?

Back at the pack house, I found Isabella and Sebastian in the office.

"How did it go? Is she willing to help?" Sebastian rose from my chair and moved around the desk.

"She was going to help." Julian informed him.

"Was?" Isabella's eyes narrowed. "Julian, what did you do?"

"Hey!" He raised his hands defensively. "I didn't do anything."

"He didn't." I confirmed. "Madame Zora heard Silver Creek's name and walked away."

"She just walked away? Seriously?" Isabella asked.

"Yes." I massaged my temples. "How's Athena?"

"In and out of sleep. Several pain-induced screams. What's our plan? We've never been undermined by another pack. Is that what they're doing? Trying to destroy us?"

"We'll figure it out." Sebastian assured Isabella. "We always do."

Athena's scream echoed through the house.

"I'll go." Isabella murmured.

I stopped her. "None of us can help. There's no medicine for this. She must endure it."

'We can't abandon her.' Titan growled internally. 'She needs us.'

I looked at Isabella and saw the guilt in her eyes. She felt responsible, having nearly completed her own blood bond with her mate. "I'll go."

Athena thrashed violently in bed. She'd changed out of her previous clothes and now wore one of my t-shirts. Sweat glistened on her skin as she convulsed, yet her eyes remained tightly shut.

Approaching her, I felt intense heat radiating from her body. She stilled momentarily before unleashing another piercing scream.

Four agonizing days passed. Each day brought less sleep and more screaming. No one in the house rested. Sebastian, Julian, Isabella, and most omegas left at nightfall just to get some sleep.

On the fifth morning, the house fell silent. I'd taken to morning runs to clear my mind with Titan. Returning inside, I heard no screams.

"Shit!" I charged upstairs, expecting to find Athena gone. Instead, she lay sprawled on her stomach like a starfish. Sweaty black hair covered her face as she slept peacefully.

'Is it over?' Titan whispered cautiously.

'We won't know until she wakes.'

Turning the chair around, I watched her sleep. Her breathing sounded even, her heartbeat steady—the slowest rhythm in days. I hoped this signaled recovery.

After an hour, she began stretching. She swept hair from her face and met my gaze.

"I'm naked." she murmured.

"You are." I smirked, relieved to see her improved condition.

"Can you look away? Please."

"You've been naked for days. You overheated. Isabella put you in a tee but even that was too much. I removed it."

Blush spread from her cheeks down her neck. "Please." She repeated, searching for nonexistent covers.

Rising, I grabbed the blanket from the chair and tossed it to her. "No need for embarrassment."

"You...you didn't take advantage?"

"You were ill and not in your right mind. I'm not my brother." I turned my back, watching her reflection in the window as she stood and wrapped the blanket around herself.

"You didn't let Titan do anything?"

"No, he was too worried about helping you."

In the window's reflection, I saw her press a hand against her chest and sigh deeply in relief.

"Trust me." I added while observing her reflection. "You'd know if I had claimed you."

"Hunters." He exhales slowly. "A Hunter's soul remains unbroken."

"How is that even possible?"

"It's our nature from birth. Perhaps that's why I perceive souls with such clarity." He gives a slight shrug. "When our own soul is complete, our perception shifts."

My gaze drifts to his glass. He's only taken a small sip of brandy, gently swirling the remaining liquid.

"You didn't consider telling me this earlier?" I ask.

"Would it have changed anything? You care for my daughter. Though it pains me to admit, I'm grateful. You were the father she needed when I couldn't be there." He downs the rest of his drink in one go.

"Even with your gratitude, what happens if Serkan or Thalia discover her existence? I sense Lottie possesses greater potential. I feel it deeply. She has her own power, making her valuable to them. We already know Cooper reached Kade. We can't let the same happen to Lottie."

"They won't touch her if they value their lives. Besides, their focus is on Athena."

"What better way to target someone than through the children she holds dear?"

"Let them try." He sneers, tapping his empty glass on the table, lost in thought.

"Is it Lottie's mother?" I press, desperate for answers. "Just give me a yes or no. I'll find out the rest myself."

He gives a slight nod.

"And I suppose Lottie's mother is why you refuse to mark Hannah! It has nothing to do with her being a Lycan, does it?" I push further.

Annoyance flashes in his eyes.

"You told me to release Isabella, to find happiness with Evelyn. Why can't you do the same?"

"It's not that simple." He speaks through clenched teeth. "She was a significant part of my life and gave me a beautiful daughter. I vowed to love her until my dying day."

"You can't move forward because you haven't allowed yourself to grieve." I stare at him, surprised. He always emphasized accepting death. He encouraged others to grieve, yet he hasn't, and years have passed since her death.

He rises to his feet. "Thanks for the drink."

"You're not going to discuss her or Lottie, are you? It could be crucial given the current situation."

"What do you think? Now tell me, where can I find my daughter?"

I inform him of her location. He nods and strides out of the kitchen, slamming the door behind him.

The Hunter, so attuned to others' souls, remained blind to how this was hindering him.

"Hey?" Silas murmurs as he cautiously opens the door. "Can I come in?"

I gesture for him to enter.

"I didn't want to interrupt anything again." He mutters, hesitating.

"You're in luck. I'm alone."

"Good." He takes the chair Luc had occupied and lets out a groan.

"Indy?" I murmur. I had seen the white-haired woman embracing him but kept my distance.

"Alexander asked me to meet him at the gates. The one with white hair launched herself at me. She wouldn't let go, clinging to me tightly while repeatedly saying how happy she was to see her mate." He frowns deeply.

"That's because she is your true mate."

He doesn't respond, just stares. Slowly, he closes his eyes. "Not Thalia."

"No. That was Indy, the half-Wolf, half-Witch you mentioned."

"She's a teenager."

"Is that how you see her?" From my viewpoint, she appeared to be in her mid-twenties.

"She looks fourteen or fifteen." He shakes his head in disgust. "Why would I be mated to a minor?"

"She's not that young. I believe this is part of the spell. Designed to prevent you from wanting to go to her."

He props his elbows on the table and buries his face in his hands.

He mumbles incoherently.

Content bohat < she was hurt by That

"She lost you. So yes, she was hurt. She likely had to watch you two together, knowing you were right there, within reach, completely unaware of who she truly was."
###Chapter 0017
Athena

His words make my stomach twist into knots.
He remains facing away, yet his intent is palpable.
His patience is clearly thinning.
The others likely slept with him their first night.
He admitted he had to restrain Titan himself.

He moves to the grand bathtub and starts the water.
He pours colored liquids into the stream.
“You need a bath,” he states without turning.
I sniff my armpits. He’s right. I smell awful.

He fills the tub until bubbles nearly spill over.
“Get in.”
“I… I can just shower,” I say weakly. At least I could hide myself somewhat.
He crosses the room and yanks the blanket off me.
His eyes lock onto mine as he lifts me effortlessly.
He carries me to the tub and lowers me into the hot water.

His gaze never wavers from my eyes.
It doesn’t roam my face or body like his brothers’ did.
It feels like he’s making a point.
“You bathe. I need to change the bedding.”
He returns to the bed and strips the sheets—a task my brother would call mine.

I stay silent and motionless, just watching him.
He moves around the bed and fetches fresh sheets from the closet.
He pays me no mind.
He doesn’t ask questions. His eyes don’t even flicker my way.

Once done, he goes back to the closet.
He rummages through the clothes ordered for me.
“I assume you feel the cold.”
“Sometimes,” I murmur.

He pulls out jeans and another sweatshirt.
He places them on the bed.
“I’ll be in the office when you’re ready.”
He doesn’t wait for a reply, slamming the door as he leaves.
His sudden anger makes me nervous. I dread meeting him in the office.

I don’t linger. I wash quickly, dress, and hurry downstairs.
Julian blocks the hallway.
“Someone’s feeling better,” he grins.
I nod, trying to stay respectful.

“How’s the wound?”
“Better. I have to meet Alpha Alexander,” I murmur, attempting to slip past him.
“Alexander won’t mind us talking. If you’re marrying my brother, we should know each other. You’ll be family.”
What can I say? Alexander didn’t want me alone with him. But escape seems impossible.

“Hey, no need to panic,” he says, draping an arm over my shoulder.
My whole body tenses at his touch.
“Seriously, Julian!” Isabella shrieks from down the hall. “What is it with you and our brother’s brides?!”
She strides over and pulls me from his grip.

“I’m just being friendly,” he mutters, annoyed.
“A little too friendly. You’re always like this!” She glares, growling as she guides me away.
“Where are you going?” she asks once we’re away from her twin.
“Alpha Alexander wants me in the office.”
“Funny, he asked for me too,” she says with a small smile as we stop at the office door.

Beta Sebastian is with Alpha Alexander.
They halt their conversation when Isabella opens the door.
Alpha Alexander’s eyes go to my wet, tied-up hair, but he says nothing.
His look almost makes me want to let it down.

“How are you feeling?” Beta Sebastian asks softly.
He always uses a kind tone, never invasive like Julian.
I nod.
“Isabella, check her wound,” Alpha Alexander orders.

I turn to her before she can speak and lift my top just enough.
Her fingers press gently around the forming scar.
She smiles. “It looks really good. I’d say the blood tie is definitely broken.”
“Good,” Alpha Alexander says, still sounding annoyed.
What did I do? Did I say something while I was out?
###Chapter 0018

“Athena, we’re heading back to Silver Creek tonight.”

My stomach plummeted.

He was sending me back.

He finally realized I wasn’t worth keeping.

My eyes squeezed shut. My breath hitched.

I should’ve acted like the others Isabella told me about.

I should’ve thrown myself at him.

I should’ve tried harder.

I never should’ve accused him.

Rough fingers lifted my chin. “Athena, look at me.”

I kept my eyes closed tight.

“Athena, I’m not returning you.”

I didn’t believe him. I knew it was inevitable.

“I’ll do better,” I pleaded. I still didn’t know my future here, but anything was better than going back to my brother.

“You’re not listening. I am not sending you back.”

I peeked through my lashes.

“We,” Alpha Alexander pointed to Beta Sebastian and himself, “are going back tonight.”

“Is that wise?” Isabella muttered. She glanced my way and sighed. “What if it’s a trap?”

“Raven, I can handle myself. That pack barely has a hundred members. I could take them in my sleep.”

“Are you taking Julian?” Isabella asked.

“Hadn’t planned on it.” Alpha Alexander’s gaze returned to me. “But now I think I will.”

“And if they’re not there? Like last time?”

“Then we burn it to the ground.” He shrugged. “Might do that anyway.”

He watched me, waiting for a reaction.

“If you see Marcus, rip his guts out through his throat.”

Isabella’s jaw dropped. Beta Sebastian stared too.

But Alpha Alexander, a slow smile spread across his lips.

“Gladly,” he murmured.

He turned to Beta Sebastian. “We leave at nightfall.”

Beta Sebastian gave a sharp nod and left. He pulled a protesting Isabella with him.

Now it was just Alpha Alexander and me.

“You’ve thought about his death?” he asked, curious.

“Marcus—”

“Don’t call him Beta. Twat. Prick. Spunk bubble. Call him anything but Beta. He lost that title.”

“Okay.”

“I have more questions. But first, why do I smell my brother on you? Is that why Isabella asked if I was taking him?”

“He said he wanted to get to know me.” I didn’t want to cause trouble.

“Let me guess. Because you’ll be family someday.”

I nodded. He frowned.

I wanted to curl into a ball and disappear. I didn’t need more problems.

His head snapped toward the window. “Athena, stay here. Lock the door behind me.”

He rushed out before I could ask why.

I saw Julian, Sebastian, and other men catapult out the door. Some were already shifting.

I quickly closed the door and slid the lock.

I had no idea what was happening.

They sensed something I couldn’t.

Panicked, I shoved chairs in front of the doors.

I sat under the window, hugging my knees.

Silver Creek had never been attacked. Our pack never attacked anyone. I was lost.

Peering over the window frame, I saw a huge beast being dragged from the trees by the wolves.

It was tall and muscular with strange tufts of dark fur. A human-like body, but its head was a giant wolf’s.

I’d never seen anything like it.

It dug its back feet into the ground as the wolves tried to pull it into the clearing.

Large claws swung at the wolves as it fought to break free.

Then someone grabbed its neck.

They ripped its head from its shoulders.
###Chapter 0019
Athena

I dropped to the floor instantly.
What in the world was that thing?

My body refused to look again.
A sudden knock on the door made me jump.

“Athena. It’s me. You can open up.” Alpha Alexander’s voice came from the hallway.

I stayed silent, staring at the door as the handle jiggled.
I didn't want to move.
I didn't want to leave my corner.
Thank goddess for the bolt lock.

“Athena, I know you saw. The creature has been handled. It's dead. There's no reason to be afraid.”

Pushing up from the floor, I glanced out the window.
All the Wolves were gone.
So was the monster.
I began moving chairs out of the way.
Slowly, I slid the lock back.

Alexander pushed through the gap.
He forced the remaining chairs aside effortlessly.
His crimson eyes scanned the office.
He didn’t mention the barricade.
I was starting to understand—those chairs were like pillows to him.

He’d pulled on a pair of grey shorts after shifting back.
They hung low on his hips, accentuating every muscle.
I looked away, heat rushing to my cheeks.

“What… what was that?” I muttered, desperate to change the subject.

“We don’t know.”

“Y—you don’t?” It shocked me that Alpha Alexander didn’t have an answer.

He shook his head. “I’ve seen many things. Nothing like that.”

“You killed it?”

“It attacked pack members. We had no choice.”

“It had a head… like a Wolf,” I mumbled.

“I know.”

“But the body… it looked almost human. Except for the hair. The size.”

“I know. But it’s over. You don’t need to worry.”

Not worry? That thing would haunt my thoughts until it had a name.
But I could tell he was done discussing it.

“Moonshine will have to wait,” he said, repositioning the chairs.
“Did you really think these would stop someone?”

I shrugged. At that moment, yes, I really did.

“It might be time to enroll you in training.”

“Training?”

“Most kids learn combat in school. You didn’t. I’d feel better if you could defend yourself.”

“You want me to train with the pack?”

He turned to face me. “Not with the pack. Not yet. Their senses are sharper. They’re faster. It wouldn’t be fair. You’ll train with me.”

“With you?” I stammered. He was a powerful Alpha. I stood no chance.

“I have better control than anyone here. If you land a hit, I won’t retaliate.”

My stomach twisted.
I’d spent years flinching at raised hands.
How did he expect to train me?

“Now?” I asked.

“In a few days. I want that scar fully healed first. I won’t send you back to the hospital.”

My hand drifted to my stomach, feeling the raised line beneath the fabric.

“Does it hurt?” He was watching me closely.
###Chapter 0020

“No.”

“Don’t lie to me. The last time you held it like that, you collapsed.”

“It doesn’t hurt, I swear.”

“Then why are you holding it?”

“It’s… It’s nothing.” I didn’t want to tell him the scar reminded me of my own weakness. It would be permanent. Bruises fade. Small wounds heal. But this mark would remain forever. A constant reminder that even with the blood tie broken, I was still mated to Beta Marcus. Even after his death, it would linger. A testament to the horrible life I endured.

His crimson eyes narrow. His brow creases into a deep frown. He leans back in his chair, studying me intently. I offer no explanation.

“Scars fade with time. It won’t always look so prominent.”

How did he know my thoughts? Was I that transparent?

“You should see it as a survivor’s wound,” he continues.

“A survivor’s wound?” That concept had never crossed my mind.

He gives a slow nod. “It caused you immense pain and suffering. But look at you now. Standing before me. Probably the healthiest you’ve been in years. You survived, Athena. You might not believe it, but deep down, you’re a fighter.”

He had such faith. Time would reveal how mistaken he was. The only person I ever truly wanted dead was Beta Marcus. Beyond that, I was no fighter.

When reports confirmed no more beasts in the forest, Alpha Alexander dismissed me from his office. He said I was free to explore.

I stood at the open front door, watching the snow begin to fall. Delicate white flakes swirled in the air. Children were already outside, running and trying to catch them on their tongues.

I took one step outside. Then immediately stepped back across the threshold. I had never been outside alone.

“Are you going to do that all night?” I turned to see Isabella sitting on the bottom stair. Her elbows rested on her knees, chin propped on her hands. She watched me with an amused smile. I hated that I couldn’t scent them.

“It’s snow. You’ve seen snow, right? I mean, Silver Creek isn’t that far.”

“I’ve seen snow,” I muttered, looking out at the falling flakes. The snow was getting heavier now. Starting to settle on the grass.

“Then what’s the problem? I’ve been watching you for twenty minutes. I can’t figure it out. Is it because of that beast? We have the all-clear. It’s dead.”

I hadn’t realized I’d been standing there so long.

I heard her footsteps as she approached. She stopped beside me and linked her arm with mine. “You’re not alone here. There’s always someone to help. Or talk to.” She froze suddenly and ripped her arm away. “You’re not thinking of running, are you?”

“No. I’ve just… I’ve never been outside on my own.”

She grabbed my arm again, beaming at me. “Like I said, Athena, we are never alone here.” She pulled me out into the snow. She seemed completely unphased by the cold, spinning around in just jeans and a vest.

She stopped and smiled at me. “Everyone thinks we’re some horrible, raging pack that just wants to kill. But what we believe in is loyalty. Here, everyone protects each other. If you’re outside and someone attacks, everyone will come to your side.”

“Because I am Alpha Alexander’s bride?” I asked quietly.

“Partly. But mostly because that’s who we are. We protect our own.”

But technically, I still wasn’t part of this pack.
###Chapter 0021
Alexander

Centuries of documented research provided no answers about the creature that attacked my pack. I slammed the laptop shut just as Julian entered the office.

"Have you seen your mate?" He asked with an amused expression, dropping into a chair and propping his feet on my desk.

"Yes." Isabella had already informed me about Athena's breakdown at the front door, but I chose to keep my distance. Some things she needed to figure out alone. "Why?"

"Just surprised you're leaving her unsupervised."

"She's not unsupervised." I shoved his feet off my desk. "What do you want, Julian?"

"I thought we were going to Silver Creek tonight."

"Plans changed."

"Thanks for the update!" He rolled his eyes dramatically.

'Does everything always have to be about him?' Titan grumbled in my mind.

"I've been preoccupied. As you should be." I snapped at my brother.

"The forest is clear. No signs of anything else. What now?" He shrugged, completely unbothered. "We're trained professionals. We've handled other threats before. If more of those things show up, we'll deal with them."

His optimism was typical. That was just how he operated. Even when I'd caught him with my first contracted bride, he'd remained utterly unfazed. Strangely, that made him the perfect Gamma. He maintained clarity where others saw chaos.

"If it makes you feel better, I'll increase patrol numbers." He offered when I remained silent.

"Do you think it came for her?" The suspicion had been growing since the blood tie broke. Madame Zora's warnings, now this attack—it couldn't be coincidence. Nothing in my life ever was.

"Athena? No offense, but she's not exactly special, is she? Just another contract bride like the others."

"She is not just another contract!" Titan snarled in my head. "She's our mate. Tell him if he touches her again, I'll bite his hand off." I smiled at Titan's threat.

"Is he saying something?" Julian asked. "Is Titan talking about me?"

"He reminds you to keep your hands to yourself."

A flicker of grey appeared in my brother's dark eyes—Aspen was close to the surface.

Aspen had been desperate to challenge Titan for years, knowing he stood no chance. Yet he never stopped trying. The grey faded as Julian stared at me. "If we're not going tonight, what should I do?"

Tell him to shove his head up his own ass? Titan suggested.

"Try to locate Madame Zora."

"Seriously? That's like finding a needle in a haystack."

I rolled my eyes. "You saw her reaction. She knows something. Dig up whatever you can."

"Fine."

He left as I stood at the window, watching Isabella and Athena throwing snowballs. Their laughter echoed across the grounds as they chased each other. My heart skipped seeing my mate so happy.

Suddenly, Athena collapsed, clutching her chest.

I was through the window and sprinting toward them before conscious thought.

"Athena! What happened?!"

"You need to chill." Isabella snorted. "She's just winded. Without her wolf back, she can't keep up with us. Talk about overreacting!"

"She's right." Athena gasped breathlessly. "I'm fine."

"Enough for today." I helped her up. "You need to change. You're soaked."

Athena nodded and headed inside.

"I was trying to let her have fun." Isabella crossed her arms.

"I see that now."

"You're worried about her." My sister observed. "She won't always be injured. If she wasn't allowed activity at Silver Creek, she won't have our fitness level. It takes time."

Her dark eyes studied me. "But something else is bothering you."

She was my only sister, and the only pack member who could read me so well. "This isn't about her being winded, is it?"

"No."

"Want to talk about it?" She offered a small smile.

"Not until I know more." I returned her smile, hoping to reassure her. "Nothing to worry about."

"I may be younger, and you raised Julian and me after our parents died. But I'm not a child anymore. Maybe I can help."

"Just watch over Athena when I'm not here."

She nodded before turning toward the medical wing.

'Now you!' I snapped at Titan. 'Don't ever do that again!'

'I panicked. You'd be furious if we did nothing.' He moaned. 'I had to know she was okay.'

My control over him usually held firm, but seeing her collapse shattered my restraint.

I found Athena in the bedroom wrapped in a blanket, changed into gray joggers. The blanket concealed her top, though I assumed she'd changed that too.

"I'm okay. Really." She murmured when she saw me.

"Good."

"Are you angry?"

"No. Yes, but not at you." Her big blue eyes held mine steadily. She was growing more comfortable with direct eye contact, and I welcomed it.

She sat on the bed, the blanket slipping to reveal one of my t-shirts. "I was trying to go outside alone. I... wasn't trying to run." She stammered.

"I know. Isabella told me."

She pressed her lips together and nodded. Taking the chair, I watched her adjust the blanket. She shifted further onto the bed, crossing her legs.

I wanted to tear the clothes and blanket away and lose myself in her. These thoughts grew harder to ignore, undoubtedly influenced by Titan. Only the fear of harming her held me back.

'The sooner we kill Marcus, the better.' Titan's voice rumbled through my mind.
###Chapter 0022
Alexander

Athena lowered her gaze, her fingers nervously twisting the edge of the blanket as she waited for me to speak.

She's like a forbidden fruit. Titan murmured. So close, yet completely untouchable. Are you certain it would harm her?

I could hear the raw desperation in his voice. I understood exactly how he felt because I battled my own urges every time her blue eyes met mine. It wasn't just Titan who wanted her. I craved the deep satisfaction of claiming her as ours.

Until her matebond with Marcus is truly severed, we must wait. I told Titan firmly.

This wasn't what Titan wanted to hear, and it certainly wasn't what I wanted to acknowledge.

Do you truly believe she is our destined mate? Meant for us and no one else? I questioned.

I feel it in my very soul. Titan responded with absolute certainty.

"You... haven't said anything?" Athena whispered, her eyes still downcast.

Even her slight stutter sent heat rushing through me.

"I have some matters to attend to," I stated as I stood up.

She nodded silently, offering no questions as usual. Yet I distinctly felt her gaze following me as I exited the room.

Moving through the house, I could hear my brother arguing with Sebastian.

"You can't be serious, Sebastian!" Julian shouted.

"I am completely serious," Sebastian snapped back. "You think being Alexander's brother gives you special privileges? Not this time. It doesn't matter who you are - I outrank you!"

"Come on, Sebastian, I'll make it up to you."

I felt my frown deepen.

What has he done now? Titan groaned.

You know Julian - he probably seduced Sebastian's partner.

I pushed the door open and fixed my brother with a hard glare. "What the hell have you done now?"

"Go ahead," Sebastian snarled. "Tell him!"

"It happened months ago," Julian pleaded. "We had too much to drink, okay? Just one night. It never happened again." His dark eyes shifted toward me, and I immediately knew I had guessed correctly.

"Seriously? You slept with Natalie? What the fuck is wrong with you?" I snapped.

Sebastian and Natalie had been together since they were thirteen, with two children between them. Maybe it wasn't just his hands that needed severing.

Titan laughed darkly at the thought.

Sebastian was furious, though he masked it well. His eyes flashed toward me. "Tell me you're not letting him get away with this?!"

I loved my brother, but he was completely out of control.

"Julian." My voice turned icy cold.

"I know, I'm temporarily grounded. I won't leave the house without you or Sebastian."

"No, not this time. You've had warning after warning, and you never change. To you, it's all just fun and games." I kept all emotion from my tone. "So I'm giving you a choice."

He stared at me with wide, dark eyes.

"Banishment or..."

My eyes shifted to Sebastian's. He knew what was coming next, and even he looked surprised.

"Or what?" Julian asked nervously.

"Death." I stated clearly.

His jaw dropped open. "Are you actually serious? I'm your brother! You raised me and Isabella! I'll change, I won't do it again!"

"Clearly, I didn't raise you well enough!"

"All because I slept with his mate?" Julian scowled.

"But it's not just Natalie, is it? What about all the brides you've seduced? What about all the women you've taken who belonged to others? It's like a challenge for you - to claim women who are already taken. Enough is enough, Julian. As I said, you've had warning after warning, and you still tried to pursue my bride."

"Bullshit!" He jumped to his feet, his eyes turning stormy gray. If he wanted a fight, Titan was right here and ready for him.

"Really? What about that comment you made about Athena being family? Implying she was to be shared! Isabella tells me everything, Julian. If you want to chase women who don't belong to you, go elsewhere and do it. Mess with the humans for all I care."

"Better yet, leave and take Natalie with you." Sebastian snapped.

"You want me to take your boys?" Julian asked with a raised eyebrow.

"No, just her." Sebastian growled.

"Bro, you can't do this!" Julian pleaded with me.

"Sebastian isn't the first to bring this to me. I have a list as long as my arm. Your time is up. What do you choose?"
###Chapter 0023

Julian shook his head, his dark eyes wide with disbelief. “I’ll go.” He muttered the words, voice barely audible. “Just… I need a few hours to pack my things.” He sounded dazed, almost disoriented.

“Supervise him.” I instructed Sebastian.

“No problem.”

Sebastian followed Julian out of the office as I reached out to Isabella through the mind-link.

‘Are you free right now?’ This news needed to come from me.

‘Sure, where do you want to meet?’

‘My office.’

‘On my way.’ She responded cheerfully.

‘She won’t take this well.’ Titan stated the obvious.

‘Which is exactly why we’re telling her ourselves.’

Isabella arrived quickly. She was in her usual bright mood, which meant Julian hadn’t contacted her yet.

“Is this about Athena?”

“No. It’s about your brother. He’s been up to his old games again.”

“You said it wasn’t about Athena.”

“It’s not. We just found out Julian slept with Natalie.”

“Are you serious?” Her dark eyes went wide with shock. “Why would he do something like that?”

“It happened a while back, but it just came to light. Isabella, he chose banishment.”

“You’re exiling our brother? My twin?”

“It’s gone on long enough. He’s had warning after warning and still refuses to change. Do you have any idea how many complaints cross my desk because of his behavior? I can’t deny he’s a skilled Gamma, but his talents no longer excuse his actions.”

She crossed her arms tightly. “Crap. Where is he going to go?”

“I don’t know.”

“You mean you don’t care!”

“Of course I care about my brother, Isabella. But there’s a limit to how many chances I can give him. If this were anyone else, they’d have been gone long ago. You know he’s been exploiting his status as my brother.”

She nodded slowly, releasing a heavy sigh. “I understand.”

‘She’s handling this much better than I expected.’ Titan mumbled. I had to agree, though it wasn’t entirely surprising—despite being twins, they were never particularly close.

“You can keep in touch if you feel you need to. You’re his twin; I won’t hold that against you. But from today onward, he is no longer a member of this pack. That means no sharing information, no revealing my location or anyone else’s. No updates on attacks. You tell him nothing. Understood?”

She nodded.

“Isabella, I need to hear you say it.”

“I understand. Under no circumstances will I give him any information.”

“Good. I believe he’s in his room packing if you want to say goodbye.”

She left without another word.

‘She’ll get over it.’ Titan muttered. ‘We did what was right for the pack.’

I wasn’t completely heartless. I gave him keys to a car and enough money to last a few months while he figured things out. But essentially, he was on his own—no other pack would take him in.

“You made the right call.” Sebastian told me as we watched the black car vanish from sight.

“I know. It was a long time coming.”

“Would you have killed him if he’d chosen death?”

“I don’t know.” If it were anyone else, the answer would’ve been yes. But could I have actually ended my own brother’s life? Who knows. “What about Natalie? She didn’t leave with him.”

“She’s trying to use our sons as leverage to keep us together. Fifteen years together, and she throws it all away for a fling with Julian.”

He looked up at the house where we could both see Athena sitting in the chair by the bedroom window. “Good thing you got him out before he got to her.” In that moment, I knew without a doubt that would’ve been enough to make me kill Julian—discovering he’d laid a hand on my mate.

“Have you told her yet?” Sebastian asked.

“Told her what?”

“That she’s your mate, obviously.”

“It’s complicated.” I sighed.

“It’s a little unfair not to tell her, especially since you made her part of the contract.”

“She’s still mated to someone else.”

“You do want her, right? I mean, you wouldn’t have brought her here if you didn’t.”

“I want her. But I need her to want me too—not just because of some damn mate bond.”
###Chapter 0024
Athena

I found Isabella in the kitchen.
She was shoveling food into her mouth.
Her dark eyes were watery.
Her face was blotchy from holding back tears.

"Aren't you supposed to be in your room?" she snapped at me.

I flinched at her tone.
Isabella had never been short-tempered with me before.
"I was... I'm hungry," I stammered. "Alpha Alexander said I could help myself if I ever needed to."

"Are you okay?" I asked quietly.

"Julian has been banished," she spluttered.
Tears finally broke free and streamed down her face.

"Oh," I breathed out, puffing my cheeks.
I tried to think of something reassuring to say.
All I could manage was an apology.

Her dark eyes studied my face.
"It's not because of you. It's because he's an idiot. I warned him so many times that Alexander would only tolerate it for so long. I'm trying not to cry, but Midnight is grieving for her twin. I can't control it."

"Your wolf?" I asked.
I couldn't remember if she or Alpha Alexander had told me her wolf's name.

"Yes," she confirmed. "Not only are Julian and I twins, but the wolves gifted to us by the Moon Goddess are twins too. Midnight knows it was his own fault, but she still sobs."

I slipped into the seat opposite her, frowning.
I didn't understand the separate wolf concept.
None of the Silver Creek members had them, at least not that I knew of.
Then again, they never told me anything.

"Can I ask you something?" I ventured.

"As long as it's not about Julian."

"Is it normal to have another voice, your wolf, living inside your head?"

She tilted her head, staring at me intently.
"We all have one. Well, not you, but we all do. When we shift, they take over, and we become a voice to them. It's a spiritual thing. Surely you know that."

I had mentioned it briefly to Alexander.
But so much was happening that I never brought it up again.

"It's just... all of you here talk about them. My brother never did. In fact, I never heard anyone at Silver Creek refer to their wolf. Is that weird?"

"Super fucking weird," Isabella stated bluntly. "If they had a wolf like Midnight, who never stops talking, you'd know about it. Have you told Alexander?"

"Sort of. I haven't discussed it because..." I glanced down at my stomach. "Then there was an attack, and now he seems to be avoiding me."

"I'm telling you, Athena. That is really weird. Midnight wants to know if you've ever seen their wolves."

I shook my head.

"You saw us shift and take down that beast. Are you really saying you've never seen anything like that at Silver Creek?"

"My brother had a rule. Shifting was to be kept in the woods."

"You need to tell Alexander." She shoved more food into her mouth.

Isabella saw my hesitation and offered to come with me.
"It's better that he knows everything you know. And I'm sorry I snapped at you." She gave me a small smile.

She linked Alpha Alexander for me.
She asked him to meet us in his office.

We waited almost thirty minutes before he appeared.
The waiting made me panic more.
It reminded me of some of the abuse I received from Silver Creek.
Sometimes, when I knew it was coming, they would make me wait, tormenting me further.

"Even I can smell your panic. And I'm not an Alpha," Isabella muttered.

"I thought my scent was weird."

"It is, which means your panic levels are stupidly high. You need to relax."

The door swung open.
Alpha Alexander strode in.
"You wanted to talk." His voice was still cold.
Normally he would be watching me, but instead his eyes were fixed on Isabella.
###Chapter 0025

Isabella smirks at him. "Athena has something to tell you."

He gives a dismissive look. "Then why are you here?"

"Support."

He scoffs at the word.

I inhale deeply. "I told you my brother never mentioned his Wolf."

"You lied to me?" he cuts in.

"No. Not like that. I didn't know every Wolf has another person inside."

His gaze sharpens on me, one brow lifting.

"When you spoke about Titan, I thought it was an Alpha thing." I glance at Isabella, who motions for me to continue. "I didn't realize it applied to everyone."

"And now you do?!"

"I never witnessed it at Silver Creek."

"Never?" He sounds genuinely curious.

I shake my head, repeating what I told Isabella.

"Nobody discussed their Wolf? Nobody ever shifted near you?"

Another head shake. I knew how absurd it sounded. Raised in a Wolf pack yet never saw a shift until the attack here.

"Strange, right?" Isabella comments.

"Never?" he presses.

"It never crossed my mind. I had other concerns. My role was to clean and endure beatings." The last part slipped out unintentionally.

Anger flashes across his face. "Enduring beatings is not a role."

Silence fills the room. I can hear my own heartbeat pounding.

"My brother enforced a rule. Shifting was permitted only beyond the trees." I shrug. "I never entered the trees."

Alpha Alexander closes his crimson eyes. "They never shifted, even when they... harmed you?"

"No."

His eyes snap open. "Then it seems we're heading to Silver Creek after all. Isabella, locate Sebastian. Tell him to gather our best."

"We're attacking?" she murmurs.

"Possibly." His eyes lock on me. "You're coming too, Athena."

Alpha Alexander instructs me to change out of joggers and a tee. I pull on black jeans and combat boots. He enters the bedroom as I tug a sweatshirt over my head.

He doesn't comment on my outfit, grabbing his jacket from the closet. The same one he wore when we first met.

"Ready?"

"...I think so."

"Good. The cars are waiting."

"What about the snow?"

He pauses to look at me. "The snow isn't deep. But that's not your real concern, is it?"

I shake my head.

"I'm not returning you. I'm taking you to provoke them." He offers a cold smile.

I open my mouth to speak, then close it. I take a deep breath and return a faint smile.

"Do you believe you'll find the answers you seek?"

"I'm not leaving until I do!"

I follow him out of the house. Several large vehicles are lined up, with people boarding. The front vehicle is the limo I rode in before. The driver stands beside it, holding the door open.

"They'll follow us to a point, then hang back. Close enough to attack if your brother isn't cooperative." Alpha Alexander mutters. "We don't want to appear hostile."

I watch Beta Sebastian enter the limo first.

"And you won't be left alone with anyone," Alpha Alexander adds.

I sit in silence while the men discuss plans openly. I feel occasional glances but no questions are directed at me.

"Well, it's not abandoned," Beta Sebastian remarks, gazing out the window.

I look through my window and see the people who took pleasure in beating me.
###Chapter 0026

The vehicle halts right before the pack house. It appears significantly smaller compared to Alpha Alexander's estate.

The door swings open. Alpha Alexander steps out and extends his hand toward me. I take it without hesitation this time. He had already emphasized the need to irritate Marcus.

His touch radiates warmth. It feels unexpectedly comforting.

Luna Victoria stands on the steps, draped in a long white gown. Her blonde hair is styled in tight ringlets that frame her face.

"Alpha Alexander." Her piercing voice makes me flinch. My grip on Alpha Alexander's hand instinctively tightens. "We did not anticipate your arrival so soon. The contract specified your return after thirty days."

So they had indeed read it.

"It also states I may return within fourteen days if unsatisfied." Alpha Alexander mutters, giving my hand a reassuring squeeze.

"You got exactly what you requested!" Luna Victoria directs a sharp glare at me. "We have committed no wrongdoing."

"Certain questions remain unresolved." A dark edge laces Alpha Alexander's tone, filling me with immediate dread. I would not want to be in Luna Victoria's position facing that.

"You are most welcome to enter. My husband and our Beta are currently out hunting. I can attempt to address your inquiries while we await their return." She shows no reaction to his ominous tone.

Entering the house makes my heart race. Alpha Alexander had repeatedly assured me of my safety. Yet, the flood of traumatic memories is relentless.

We follow Luna Victoria into the office. Her green eyes lock onto mine as she shuts the door. "Please, sit." The words are forced through clenched teeth. The effort it must cost her is almost tangible.

"How may I assist you, Alpha Alexander?" Her tone is deceptively calm.

"Who bound Athena?"

The question surprises me. It wasn't what I expected.

"Regrettably, that is information I do not possess, Alpha Alexander."

"But she was bound on two separate occasions, correct?"

Her green eyes flicker briefly toward me. "Correct."

"Because she was mated to your Beta."

She sucks in her cheeks. "Was. He rejected her. Who would desire a worthless creature like that as a mate?!" A derisive chuckle escapes her.

"Have you concluded she is worthless, Alpha Alexander? Are you attempting to return her?"

"No. As I stated, I am merely seeking answers."

"I am uncertain what you wish me to say, Alpha Alexander. The first binding was punitive. The second occurred upon her eighteenth birthday. The initial witch's work was evidently inadequate."

"You employed a witch? I was under the impression you claimed ignorance of the perpetrator."

A faint blush colors her cheeks. "I do not know her identity. We are both aware only a witch could perform such magic."

It was a plausible recovery, yet it sounded rehearsed.

"Then I shall await Dominic to provide the necessary answers."

"Very well. May I offer you refreshments during your wait?"

"Water is sufficient." Alpha Alexander replies flatly.

She exits the office. Minutes later, she returns carrying a jug of water and glasses. She sets them on a small central table.

Alpha Alexander moves with blinding speed. He pins Luna Victoria against the wall, lifting her inches off the ground. His hands coil tightly around her neck.

"Do you take me for a fool?" He snarls. "I detected the scent before you finished pouring."

"You... you shouldn't be able to..." Luna Victoria chokes out, struggling against his grip.

"Wolfsbane Toxin." Beta Sebastian states grimly, dumping the jug's contents onto the floor.
###Chapter 0027
Alexander

My fingers squeezed Victoria's throat tighter.
She choked, gasping for air.
Her hands clawed desperately at my grip.
I loosened my hold just enough.
"Are you growing it?" I demanded.

"No," she rasped, voice strained.
"Then how did you get it? Was it Dominic? Or that fool Marcus?"
"I found it!" she croaked out.
"Lies!"
"It's true!" she insisted, coughing.

"Who were you targeting? Me or her?"
Movement caught my attention.
Athena stepped forward from behind me.
"Was it you?" she whispered softly.

"Don't speak to me, traitor!"
"Answer her!" I ordered.
I slammed Victoria against the wall.
A sickening crack echoed through the room.
She cried out in sharp pain.

"I don't understand her question," she gasped.
"Let me make it clear. Her parents were murdered with Wolfsbane Toxin. The blame was placed on a six-year-old. Your mate claimed she should have known plants. You know this already. So I'll ask again. Did you kill them?"

"GET AWAY FROM MY MATE!"
Dominic charged into the room.
He crashed into me, sending us both stumbling.
I landed heavily on top of Athena.
Our eyes locked instantly.

Her blue gaze held mine.
A soft gasp escaped her lips.
My chest pressed against hers.
In that moment, I knew.
Titan was right all along.
She was my true mate.

'Told you so!' Titan murmured smugly.
But it still didn't make sense.
How could she have two mates?

I rose to my feet quickly.
Dominic was already raging.
He checked the marks on Victoria's neck.
His eyes burned with fury.

"How dare you attack my mate in my own home!"
"Can't you smell the Wolfsbane Toxin?" I snapped.
His jaw tightened visibly.
"She was alone! She was defending herself!"

"I came for answers, not a war. But if you want war, I'll give it to you."
He raised his hands suddenly.
Realization dawned on his face.
He knew I meant every word.

"It was a mistake. She shouldn't have done it. But you must understand, Alpha Alexander. My mate felt threatened."
"The contract states if you harm Athena again, this pack becomes mine."

"But she didn't harm her. You discovered the poison in time. No damage was done." His eyes flicked to Victoria. She still sat on the floor, rubbing her neck. "Technically, she broke no rules."

'He found a loophole,' Titan growled.
Indeed he had. Dominic was the first to ever find a loophole in my contracts.

"Surely we can discuss this misunderstanding," Dominic said. He turned to his mate. "Leave us."
"I'm staying," she insisted.
"Let her remain," I said. "Let her stay and reveal all your secrets."

I sat back down, watching them both.
My eyes moved to Athena.
I raised a finger to my lips.
She nodded in understanding.
She knew to stay silent and listen.
To hear the lies she'd been fed for years.

"Where's the other one?" I asked.
Victoria said Marcus and Dominic were hunting together.
Yet Dominic arrived alone.

"He's coming," Dominic muttered, jaw clenched.
"Good. While we wait, tell me the truth. Who really killed your parents, Dominic?"

His eyes shifted to my mate.
"I already told you."
"But it's not the truth, is it? Your mate tried to poison us with the same substance. It makes me think it was her. Or perhaps both of you?"

"It was Athena! Why does it matter? You took her as your bride. You clearly don't care about her past actions."
"Because it's not true. Deny it all you want. I know it was one of you." I looked directly at Victoria. "Or maybe both of you were involved."

Victoria dropped her gaze immediately.
"Did you plan it together?" I asked bluntly. "Were you so desperate for power that you killed your own parents?"

I saw his jaw tighten.
His cheeks pulsed with tension.
"If you did, that's your burden. But to blame a child? To punish her so cruelly? That's unforgivable. If the pack discovered the truth, they'd see you as a traitor. You'd have no place here."

"What do you want?" he snarled.
"The truth."
"Don't!" Victoria cried out.
"Silence!" I growled at her.

Dominic turned to look at Athena.
"You did kill them. But it wasn't supposed to be them. You were too young to remember. You were supposed to take the poisoned lemonade to Victoria's parents. But you took the jug and served our parents first."

I watched Athena closely.
She blinked back tears.
Her hands balled into fists.
She slid them under her legs.
She sat on them, hiding her turmoil.

"So you punished her for your mistake?"
"I had to. She served them. There were too many witnesses." He sank into a chair. "I couldn't let it go unpunished."

"And yet you allowed everyone to beat her. You beat her yourself. Was binding her not enough?"
"Then the foolish girl should have followed directions!" Victoria snapped.

Everything fell into place.
Athena had told me about Victoria's changing attitude.
She had tried to befriend Athena.
She wanted Athena to do her dirty work.
It was all a calculated plan.

"Let me understand this. If she had killed your parents, you would never have tormented my bride?"
Neither answered.
"I thought so."

I waited for Titan to speak.
But he just paced in my mind.
He was holding back, waiting for more information.
"You may be angry, Alpha Alexander. But it's in the past. We want to move forward. We want a strong alliance with your pack. I know there's bad history with my sister. But we can move past it. Can't we?"

"Bad history?" I snorted. "You made her life a living hell."
I looked at my mate.
She stared down at her lap.
A fierce need for revenge burned within me.
For everything they had done to her.
They would all pay.
Every last wolf of Silver Creek would feel my wrath.
###Chapter 0028
Athena

A fragmented memory surfaced abruptly.

Luna Victoria's cheerful voice echoed in my mind.

"It's so warm today, isn't it, Athena?" Her tone was light and pleasant as she guided me through making lemonade. She had allowed me to stand on a chair at the kitchen counter, assisting her. A second jug waited on the counter, its bottom lined with unfamiliar leaves.

"What's that, Victoria?"

"I thought we could prepare extra. Everyone enjoys lemonade on days like this."

The memory shifted abruptly.

I saw myself offering the jug to my parents. I watched intently as they poured themselves drinks and toasted to something. Then chaos erupted.

Screams filled the air as someone grabbed my arms and dragged me away. Before I lost sight of them, I saw blood pouring from my parents' eyes, noses, and mouths. They clawed desperately at their faces.

"Athena, what did you do?!"

"I don't know." My young voice trembled with fear.

"Victoria, I didn't mean to. I'm sorry, will they be okay?"

Her face hardened, green eyes narrowing to slits. "My name is Cassandra, and you, you foolish girl, just murdered your parents."

I blinked several times, returning to reality. Just as I looked up, Marcus entered through the door.

"Apologies. I had matters to attend to." His dark eyes found me. "Decided to bring her back then? Too much trouble?" He mused.

"Just sit down!" My brother snapped.

This was unlike Dominic. He never spoke sharply to his mate or his Beta.

"We've told them the truth about our parents." Dominic continued. "It was time for the truth to emerge."

"If it even is the truth." Alpha Alexander snapped.

I followed instructions and remained silent. I would tell him about my flashback later, hoping he wouldn't be too angry.

'I'm also here to ensure you reject her properly." Alpha Alexander told Marcus.

Everyone stared at him. Even Luna Victoria showed surprise, but not my brother. Dominic still knew we were connected.

"You told me you rejected her." Luna Victoria shrieked. I covered my ears. Her voice always caused me physical pain.

"I did, and she accepted."

"Lies." Alpha Alexander snapped. "All fucking lies. If you had truly rejected her, how could you force a blood tie on her?"

"You did what?" My brother's chocolate eyes widened in shock.

Either Dominic was an excellent liar, or he genuinely didn't know about the blood tie. It was impossible for me to tell. I could probably sense it if I had my Wolf.

Alpha Alexander's crimson eyes searched my face. "Say it."

What did he want me to say?

"Fucking speak the words and reject her." Alpha Alexander roared. I felt my body tense.

"Marcus, reject her. Reject her right now." Dominic uttered.

"No." Marcus's lips curved into a smirk.

Alpha Alexander turned away from me, squaring up to Marcus. Alpha Alexander was noticeably taller, yet Marcus held his ground, refusing to back down.

I felt frozen. If I were in his position, I would probably be preparing for death.

"Marcus, do as you're told." My brother shouted.

"Fine." He moved around Alpha Alexander and stood directly before me. I dropped my gaze, unwilling to look at him directly.

"Look at me, whore!"

My body trembled. Slowly, I forced myself to meet his eyes. Pure hatred burned in his gaze.

"I, Marcus Souls, Beta of the Silver Creek pack, reject you, Athena Harrison." He paused dramatically. "As my mate, now and forever."

"I accept!" I muttered quickly, wanting this to end. "I accept your rejection, Marcus Souls."

While I felt nothing, his face contorted as if in severe pain.

"And now," Alpha Alexander smiled coldly. "I can kill you!"

He pulled a dagger from his jeans and drove it straight through Marcus's back and into his heart.
###Chapter 0029

Marcus stumbled forward, clutching his chest.

Beta Sebastian quickly pulled me from my seat just before Marcus collapsed.

He made low, guttural sounds before going completely still.

Both Luna Victoria and my brother Dominic shot to their feet.

“You…you killed him!” Luna Victoria cried out.

“He got exactly what he deserved. I just needed to make sure he properly rejected Athena.”

“You murdered my brother!” Victoria shrieked, rushing to Marcus’s side.

I hadn’t known they were siblings.

For a split second, I felt a pang of sympathy for her.

Then I remembered all the hell she had put me through.

“You better watch your back, Alpha Alexander.” She growled at him.

“You don’t scare me.” He mused calmly.

“Maybe I don’t. But when you see what’s coming, you’ll wish I was the least of your problems.”

“What are you talking about?” Alexander demanded. “Is that a threat?”

“You’ll see.” She muttered as Dominic pulled her arm, helping her up from the floor.

They both bolted from the room.

Alpha Alexander sent Beta Sebastian after them.

I stared at Marcus’s dead body, half hunched over the chair I’d been sitting in.

I had wished for his death for so long.

Now that it had happened, I felt… relieved.

“Are you okay? Did it hurt when he rejected you?” Alexander’s voice was soft.

He used his fingers to gently turn my face toward his.

“No. But it hurt him. I saw the pain on his face.” I whispered. “He… he said it differently this time.”

“I thought that might be the case.”

“I…I didn’t know they were brother and sister.”

“Does it matter? You’re Dominic’s sister, and they treated you horrendously.”

“But it was me. I did kill my parents.” I muttered quietly. “I saw myself giving them the jug.”

“What did you remember?”

I told him about the flashback.

He didn’t interrupt me once as I recalled the smaller details.

Only when I finished did he tell me he still believed I was set up.

It was the same thing he had been saying all along.

“Victoria said she wanted you to kill her parents. I think that was an excuse. I believe the plan was always for you to give the poison to your own parents. She wanted to be Luna, and your brother wanted to be Alpha.”

“They’ll never know, though. They died believing their daughter killed them.” I groaned.

He sighed at my words.

Before he could speak, Beta Sebastian returned.

“They’re gone. Everyone has gone. The pack has cleared out.”

“What the hell are you talking about?”

“I followed Dominic and Victoria into the trees and quickly lost their scent. It’s like they vanished into thin air.”

“That’s not possible. Wolves don’t just vanish. Where the fuck did they go?”

“I’m assuming they have some kind of safe space.” Sebastian shrugged.

“Set up a search party and hunt them down. I’m taking Athena home.”

Back in the car, I felt his eyes on me.

I kept my gaze lowered.

I knew he had questions, but I couldn’t answer them.

I knew nothing when it came to my own pack.

It turned out I didn’t actually know much about Wolves at all.

“You don’t have to see them ever again, if you don’t want to.” His voice was low. “As far as I’m concerned, the contract is void. The one thing that was tying you to the pack is dead.”

I lay down on the seat, turning away to face the back.

I could still feel his gaze burning into the back of my head.

He wanted me to talk.

But there was nothing I could say.

I was too busy remembering the last time I saw my parents.

And how they had looked at me.
###Chapter 0030
Alexander

Athena had fallen asleep during the drive back. I watched her shoulders tremble with silent sobs, her back turned to me the entire time. I remained quiet, unsure how to comfort her. Even Titan seemed lost for words.

I carried her inside, cradling her carefully. She didn't stir as I laid her on the bed. Her face was flushed and tear-streaked even in sleep.

'Do you think she's mourning him?' Titan wondered.

I don't know. She claimed to feel nothing. Perhaps it's a delayed reaction from the binding breaking.

'We should tell her she's our mate. We can claim her now that she's free of that bastard.'

No. That's the last thing she needs to hear right now.

I removed her boots gently. She instinctively curled into a fetal position, emitting that soft snuffling sound she always makes in her sleep.

I watched over her for several minutes until Sebastian's link came through. 'We need to talk immediately!'

His urgency suggested the hunting party had found something significant.

'My office,' I linked back.

'Meet me outside. We'll arrive in ten minutes.'

'What's that about?' Titan questioned when Sebastian ended the link.

'We'll find out soon enough,' I snapped back.

After one final check on Athena, I descended the stairs and exited the house. A convoy of vehicles arrived moments later, forming a protective barrier that blocked the view from the rest of the pack.

Sebastian jumped from the lead vehicle that stopped directly before me.

"Did you locate them?" I demanded. He shook his head.

"Not exactly." Sebastian scanned our surroundings. "Where's Athena?"

"Asleep."

He nodded sharply and yanked open the rear door of his SUV. He dragged out a naked man by his ankles, dumping him unceremoniously onto the snow-covered ground. The man's wrists and legs were bound with thick ropes. A heavy metal chain coiled around his neck. He appeared only half-conscious, covered in blood and mud that obscured his features.

"You brought me a naked man?" I remarked dryly. "He's not really my type."

Sebastian shook his head and grabbed the chain's end. He kicked the prone figure. "Show him!"

Other pack members stepped forward, all holding similar chains. Was this naked man some powerful wolf I didn't recognize? That seemed impossible.

The man simply lay there, staring dazedly at the starry sky. After several seconds, we heard his bones cracking. We watched his limbs elongate, snapping the ropes that restrained him. Patches of fur sprouted across his body. But he didn't shift into a wolf. He transformed into the same type of beast that had attacked my men.

Sebastian signaled his men forward. They quickly secured chains around the beast's legs.

"Where did you find it?" I demanded, studying the creature with my crimson gaze. It matched the description of our previous attacker exactly.

"During the hunt for Dominic and Victoria. This one was hiding in a tree."

The beast remained sprawled in the snow, still somewhat disoriented.

"In a tree?" Titan murmured.

I shared his surprise. Wolves don't climb trees.

"Haven't you noticed the other thing?" Sebastian asked.

I examined the beast more closely and realized it had no scent whatsoever. Not even the faintest trace of body odor.

"How is that possible?"

Sebastian delivered another kick to the creature. "This one either fell from the tree, or the branch couldn't support its weight. It landed right in front of us. If it hadn't, we would never have detected its presence, Alexander. When shifted, these things can literally hide in plain sight."
###Chapter 0031

"Did he talk?"

"Nothing useful yet." Sebastian sighs, his gaze shifting to me. "I believe this is the true form of a Silver Creek wolf."

"Lock him in the dungeons. Maximum security. We'll interrogate later. And this stays between us!" I command sharply.

"What about Athena?" Sebastian asks.

"What about her?" I glare at him.

He immediately falls silent, choosing not to press further.

"Take the beast to the dungeons." I repeat.

Sebastian nods and they load the creature back into the vehicle, driving toward the secure facility.

She can't be one of them.' Titan protests in my mind. 'It's impossible.'

Why are you so quiet?' Titan demands as I walk back through the mansion.

Pieces were finally connecting. My lack of knowledge about Silver Creek until recently. Their extreme secrecy. How they kept vanishing without trace. How Athena had never seen their wolf forms. How the beast hid in the trees. Athena's comments about gaining their wolves at thirteen.

What if that was the key? They didn't disappear—they ascended. Hiding high in the canopy where we'd never think to search.

I settle into the chair in our bedroom, watching my mate sleep. Was she one of them without realizing it? If I unbind her, will this become her fate?

She's ours!' Titan insists, as if that explained everything.

I wake to the sound of running water.

The bed lies empty.

Athena's clothes are discarded at the foot of the bed.

I glance toward the bathroom.

She sits on the shower floor, water streaming over her small frame as she leans against the glass.

"Athena?"

She doesn't respond.

I wrench the shower door open.

She hugs her knees to her chest.

"I... I don't really remember my parents." she whispers. "But I see their faces. I... I see blood flowing from their noses and eyes. I see them clawing at their throats while choking on blood. I remember their eyes locking with mine as they took their final breaths."

I had feared she felt the bond break with Marcus.

Instead, she was reliving her parents' dying moments.

No amount of reassurance would erase that haunting final image.

I strip off my shirt and step under the water.

Sliding down the cool tiles, I sit beside her.

In one swift motion, I pull her naked body onto my lap.

I lock my arms around her, holding her tightly against me.

Hoping it would provide some comfort.

Hoping she would understand she isn't alone.

She rests her cheek against my chest, taking deep breaths.

Her racing heart gradually slows to a steady rhythm.

I desperately wanted her.

I could feel myself hardening beneath her.

"Let's get you dressed." I murmur, ignoring Titan's frustration.

My needs could wait.

My self-control continued to surprise me.

Athena remains still as I wrap a towel around her.

She sits on the bed while I find fresh clothes for her.

"The contract is void, right?" She asks quietly. "You're finished with my brother?"

"Yes."

"So I'm free to leave without you killing me?"
###Chapter 0032
Alexander

I turned back to face her.
She was staring at me with those wide blue eyes.
Her bottom lip trembled slightly as she awaited my response.
I didn't want her to leave.
But what if she truly was one of those creatures?
What kind of danger would I be inviting?

"Are you... going to kill me?" she repeated, her voice barely a whisper.

"No." The answer came instantly.
It didn't matter what she might be.

She clutched the towel wrapped around her body.
It was hitched up around her thighs, offering barely any coverage.

"Put these on." I handed her the sweatshirt and joggers from the cupboard.
I would have preferred her wearing less, but keeping her covered made things easier.

'That won't stop you!' Titan mocked.

I turned away to let her dress. "Why do you assume I want you gone?"

"I'm part of the contract." This time she didn't stutter.
She seemed to find it easier to speak when I wasn't looking directly at her.

"You were," I agreed, keeping my back turned. "But I have no intention of killing an innocent woman."

'Don't you dare!' Titan growled.

"If you wish to leave, you may. I'll ensure you're settled and provide everything you need."

'You fucking idiot!' Titan yelled.
He wasn't concerned at all that Athena might not be a true Wolf.

'I have to give her a choice,' I snapped at him. 'Let her make her own decisions.'

"Where would I go?" Athena asked softly.

"Anywhere you want." I sighed.
It sounded like she'd already made up her mind. "There are neutral zones where no packs hold control."

'Stop telling her the good parts!' Titan paced in frustration.
As much as I didn't want her to leave, I felt obligated to present all options. 'Tell her she'll be unprotected! That there are more monsters like Dominic! Tell her to stay!'

I heard her footsteps pad across the carpet.
She settled into the chair.
I turned to look at her.
The soft blue sweatshirt made her eyes appear even more vibrant.

"Can I think about it?" she asked quietly.

"Of course."

She brushed through her hair.
I caught a new scent mixed with her unusual fragrance.
Lavender.
The more I considered it, the more I realized her strange scent wasn't as potent as before.

'Matebond!' Titan chuckled. 'Finally you believe it!'

Sometimes I truly wished Titan and I were separate beings.
Just so I could punch him.

'Hey!' he complained. 'I'm not the one pretending. Just claim her already.'

"I need to go check on something," I muttered, feeling like a foolish schoolboy. "If you need me, someone can link me. Don't worry, I won't leave the pack grounds."

She nodded silently while Titan continued calling me an idiot.

'Whatever, we have a beast to interrogate!' I told him as I hurried from the bedroom and down the stairs.

Before I even descended into the dungeon, I could hear Sebastian demanding answers.
He wasn't getting far.
The creature wasn't responding.

"What the fuck are you?!" Sebastian shouted just as I appeared.

The man was in human form.
Sebastian or someone had given him basic clothing.
He huddled in the corner.
Without the blood and smeared mud, I could see he wasn't much more than a boy.
Perhaps eighteen at most.

"What's your name?" I asked, keeping my tone even.

"He won't answer," Sebastian muttered. "I've been trying all night. He refuses to speak."

I turned to study the young man in the corner.
They had chained his legs down, allowing him almost no movement.

"Are you injured?" I asked.

The boy still refused to look at me.

"Does Dominic know we have you?"

He remained silent.

"Do you know Athena?"

His eyes flashed toward me.
They were blue, exactly like Athena's. "Is she alright?"

"You're locked in a dungeon and your concern is whether Athena is alright?"

"Please tell me you got her away? That you got her out of that house?"

Sebastian raised an eyebrow at me.

"Who are you?" I asked, giving no information about Athena. "And what are you?"

"She doesn't know me, or at least I don't think she does. My name is Caleb. I'm her true brother, and I'm what's called a Lycan, the same as Athena."
###Chapter 0033

“What the hell is a Lycan?” Sebastian demanded sharply.

“Exactly what you witnessed. Half wolf, half human.” His blue eyes locked onto mine. “Did you get her out safely?”

“What do you mean, true brother?” I pressed.

“Athena only has one brother, and Dominic isn’t him.”

“Stop lying to me!”

“I’ll explain everything.” He extended his arms in a placating gesture.

“You’d be the first.” I snapped, my patience thinning.

“I’m not loyal to Silver Creek. I’m a Rogue.” Devon stated calmly.

‘He’s completely insane!’ Sebastian linked me.

“Rogue?” That term wasn’t used among wolves. You either belonged to a pack or you didn’t.

“Rejected by my pack.” Devon muttered, completely unfazed.

“Assuming you’re telling the truth. How does Athena not recognize you?”

“The same way she believes Dominic is her older brother.”

‘I can’t tell if he’s lying.’ Titan murmured.

Devon pointed to his eyes. “Our eyes. They’re identical, inherited from our mother and her lineage.”

“Anyone can have similar eyes.” I countered.

“You’re right, they can. But what color were Dominic’s eyes?” He smirked. “Why would I bother telling you this?”

“To buy yourself time!” I snapped.

‘I’m locked in a dungeon. I’m not going anywhere.’ He said sarcastically.

“Let me get this straight. You’re something called a Lycan. A man who claims to be Athena’s younger brother. Someone she doesn’t know. And Dominic isn’t related to her?”

“Almost correct. I didn’t say he wasn’t related. I said he wasn’t her brother!”

“Then who is he?”

“Our uncle!”

‘So she is an Alpha.’ Titan murmured in shock. ‘Being bound twice wasn’t just because she carries powerful blood. She’s an Alpha by birthright. The firstborn.’

‘If this is even true.’

“He didn’t believe the Alpha role should go to a female.” Devon continued. “He posed as an older brother due to the significant age gap with our father. The pack supported him.”

“How do you know all this?”

“I had an insider.”

“Had?”

“They came here to verify Athena arrived alive. I believe you killed him.”

“He shouldn’t have attacked my wolves.”

“I know. I told him to remain silent and unseen. Clearly, he failed both.”

“How old are you?”

“Nineteen.”

Three years younger than Athena. If her memories were indeed altered, she wouldn’t remember.

“I know you don’t believe me, but you saw me. You saw my Lycan form. My adoptive parents were horrified when I turned thirteen.” He smiled faintly. “Bless them.” His blue eyes returned to me. “She doesn’t know what she is, does she?”

He inspected his nails, picking at dried blood.

“Why didn’t you stop him?”

“Dominic? I tried, multiple times. They became more cunning. I couldn’t even approach the house.”

“They didn’t kill you?”

“Oh, they tried.” He exhaled heavily. “Please tell me she’s alive. I don’t need to see her. I don’t need to speak to her. I just need to know my sister finally escaped Dominic’s control and is safe.”

“She escaped.” I confirmed.

“Is she safe?”

“Yes.”

“Can we talk?” Sebastian asked, nodding toward the stairs.

“Do you think he’s telling the truth?” Sebastian asked as soon as we were outside.

“I’m not sure.”

“He wouldn’t say two words to me, but the moment you arrived, he told you everything.”

“Keep questioning him.” I muttered. “I need to research this Lycan information. No violence.” I warned. “If he truly is her brother, I don’t want her discovering you beat him to a pulp.”

“No violence.” He confirmed. “As always.”

In my office, Athena was slowly spinning in my desk chair. She didn’t hear me enter and quickly planted her feet on the carpet when she noticed me, stopping the chair.

“Looking for something?” I asked. The urge to tear her clothes off was becoming overwhelming.

She nodded. “You.”

“You should have had someone link me.”

“I could wait. I’m used to waiting.” She gave me a tight-lipped smile.

“How can I help you?”

“If I give you your heir, does that mean I can stay?”
###Chapter 0034
Athena

His expression shifted to a mix of shock and bewilderment. A flicker of irritation might have been there too. But I needed clarity about my position with him.

Life at Silver Creek had been predictable despite its cruelty. I knew my daily routines. I expected the nightly visits from those who came to hurt me. I survived on leftover scraps when available. Here, everything felt uncertain and unexpected. They spoke to me as if I truly belonged.

I had spent hours alone analyzing every word from Alpha Alexander. He claimed I was the only one he ever wished to mark. Perhaps now that Dominic's contract had ended, he might consider a new agreement with me.

"Is that your desire? To provide an heir and nothing more?" His voice now carried clear annoyance.

I lowered my gaze. "It's what you want, isn't it? Someone to give you an heir. Weren't these contracts with female Wolves designed for that purpose? Draft a new contract with me, just me!" I surprised myself with this sudden boldness.

"You require no contract. I've already granted you permission to remain."

I nodded, but I understood how Wolves operated, especially Silver Creek males. I heard their conversations every night. I needed guarantees for my safety here.

"I understand," he murmured. "You seek a contract for protection."

"Y...yes." I knew I was testing my luck. He was an Alpha, and I had no right to make demands.

I felt his intense gaze upon me. I kept my eyes down and remained silent. I had stated my terms. The next move was his.

"No."

"Oh."

"It's unjust to expect you to sign a contract when you cannot read."

My shoulders slumped in disappointment. I had been certain this was the right approach.

"I shall offer a verbal agreement. One year. You remain by my side for three hundred sixty-five days. If we are both content by then, you will carry my heir."

"W...What's the catch?"

"No catch, Athena. It's precisely that simple."

"What if you discover your true mate?" A year felt like an eternity. I would willingly bear his heir immediately if it stopped these persistent fantasies.

"I won't."

"You...you cannot be certain."

"I've searched for ten years, Athena. I would have found her by now. Do we have an agreement?"

I glanced up to find him watching me, awaiting my response.

"Was this not your purpose for meeting me? To negotiate terms?" he pressed.

"Why one year?" I whispered.

"A year serves its purpose. Many question my ability to maintain a relationship. You know what occurred with the others."

"Who determines when the year concludes? What if something terrible happens? What if... what if I make mistakes or remain unbound forever?"

He smiled faintly. "You ask considerably more questions than Dominic ever did."

"I just..."

"You seek certainty." His smile widened. "You may lack reading skills, Athena, but you possess intelligence. You should acknowledge your own capabilities. Let us proceed this way. You act as my mate or bride, whichever term you prefer, for one full year. During this time, the entire pack will protect you. I will teach you self-defense. I will seek someone to unbind you. I will provide the life you deserve. I will arrange tutoring for reading and writing. I will supply anything you require."

A life I deserved. It sounded impossible. "Okay," I muttered in agreement.

Alpha Alexander maintained his smile, evidently pleased with our new arrangement.
###Chapter 0035

"Good. That's settled." He extended his hand, waiting patiently as I took it. "Now you come with me."

"Where are we going?" I muttered, a sudden wave of panic rushing through me.

"I told you training would begin once you healed."

He kept his hand firmly around mine as we walked across the grounds. I wasn't sure if he was making a point, but I didn't care. His touch was warm. Comforting.

As we moved, I spotted Beta Sebastian standing near a small windowless building with a single door. I wondered where it led.

Alpha Alexander pushed open a set of double doors leading into a gym. It was already full of sweaty men and women training.

"Everyone out!" His voice echoed through the space.

One by one, they grabbed their belongings and filed out until we were alone.

"Right." He guided me toward the mats and turned me to face him. "Make a fist."

I balled my hand. He shook his head.

"Give me a thumbs up." I obeyed. "Now wrap your thumb around the outside." He took my newly formed fist. "If you punch someone with your thumb inside, you'll break it. Since you can't heal, I'd prefer to avoid another hospital visit."

After watching me hit the punching bag a few times, Alpha Alexander suggested we start with blocking. I would've been more frustrated if I didn't agree. The bag had barely moved.

He spent time showing me how to defend against frontal attacks. But when he moved behind me, locking his arms around my body, I froze. Lost in the warmth surrounding me.

"Athena, are you going to try anything?" His minty breath brushed my skin as he whispered in my ear. One hand pressed flat against my stomach. The other held my shoulders firmly.

"Earth to Athena?" He loosened his grip slightly.

"I... I need to use the bathroom," I stammered, flustered.

He released me and pointed toward the end of the gym.

I ran without looking back. Burst into the women's bathroom and locked myself in a stall.

I had never felt this way around any man. Ever. It made me question if something was wrong with me. Why did he affect me like this?

"You don't have to be embarrassed." His deep voice came from the other side of the door. "I can help you with your... needs."

Amusement tinged his words.

"After all, you're mine for the year."

He pushed the unlocked door open.

His crimson eyes seemed darker than usual. They focused heavily on me. Only me.

I thought I was ready. I thought I was certain when I agreed to carry his heir.

But as he stared at me with growing hunger, I knew I couldn't just give myself to him.

"I can help you release that frustration." He smiled. "Or I can teach you how to release it yourself."

I pushed the door closed in his face. "I'm not... I'm not ready."

"You're only going to suffer. It will get worse. You'll grow more restless. Maybe even angry." Was he talking about himself?

I ripped the door open and glared at him. "What does that mean? Are you just saying that to get into my pants?"

"You're part animal. It's a natural instinct. You might ignore it now, but it will consume you. I'll become part of your everyday thoughts. Even now, I can still smell your arousal. It's only growing stronger."

I clamped my thighs together. His eyes dropped to them.

"Your underwear is soaked. You feel a dull throb deep inside. An ache. A longing."
###Chapter 0036
Athena

He leans in close, his body caging me against the wall.
His gaze locks with mine before dropping to my lips.
He moves without warning, capturing my mouth with his.
This time, I don’t pull away.

Alexander draws back slightly. “Do you trust me?” His voice is soft, almost a whisper.
“Yes.” The word escapes me breathlessly.
“We can take this slow.” he murmurs, and I nod quickly, my heart hammering.
His lips find mine again, more insistent now.
His hands settle firmly on my hips, pulling me closer.

He breaks the kiss once more, and I give another small nod, craving more.
His mouth trails down my neck, leaving a path of fire along my skin.
Every kiss sends electric shocks straight through me.

He steps back, guiding me from the cubicle toward the shower area.
Pinning me against the wall, he tugs my sweatshirt up and off, taking my vest with it.
My breasts are exposed, and he doesn’t hesitate.
He takes one nipple into his mouth, teasing it with his teeth while his hand kneads the other.
I gasp, arching into his touch.

His lips continue their descent, stopping at the waistband of my joggers.
Slowly, he lowers them, planting open-mouthed kisses on every newly revealed inch of skin.
I moan, my fingers tangling in his hair.

“Earth to Athena! Are you okay?”

I’m jerked back to reality.
Alexander’s arm is still draped over my shoulders from behind, poised for a mock attack.
“I’m fine,” I mumble, hoping my daydream wasn’t audible.
His arm drops, allowing me to turn and face him.
“You sure? You spaced out for a minute.”
I wonder if he can scent my arousal. He says nothing, just like before. “Just… thinking,” I murmur.
His eyebrows lift slightly, a faint smile playing on his lips. “Anything I can help with?”
“No… no, I don’t think so.”
He cocks an eyebrow. “Then I think we’re done for today.”
“Okay.” My face feels like it’s on fire. “Are you coming back to the house?” I ask, avoiding his eyes.
“I have some pack business to handle first. Isabella should be at the house. She’ll keep you company.”

I hurry out of the gym, nearly sprinting across the grounds.
I just want to get inside before anyone sees my flushed face.
“Are you okay?” Isabella is leaning against a chair in the lounge, watching me.
“Why does everyone keep asking me that?” I snap, then dash up the stairs.
What is wrong with me?

Hours pass before I see Alexander again.
“There you are!” he says, as if I’d been the one hiding. “What’s wrong?” He closes the bedroom door behind him.
“You could smell me, couldn’t you?” I’d been obsessing over it for hours.
“Are we talking about the gym, or when you fell asleep in the chair?”
He knew. He definitely knew.
“You didn’t do anything!”
“Is that a question or an accusation?” he murmurs.
I don’t answer. I’m not even sure what I’m trying to say.
“You’re wondering why I didn’t pounce on you just because I scented your arousal.” He smiles.
“That’s what male Wolves do, isn’t it?”
“Not in this pack. Haven’t we had this conversation already?”
“Your brother—”
“My brother doesn’t count.” He cuts me off sharply.
“I… I’ve never…”
“I know.”
“You know?” I try to hide my shock. It’s not something I advertise.
He nods. “You didn’t go to school. You never left the pack grounds. Dominic never let anyone touch you like that. It wasn’t hard to figure out, Athena.”
“You didn’t say anything.”
“Why would I? It wasn’t my secret to tell. Unless you’re planning to sleep with every man in my pack?”
“No. I… I made a deal with you.”
“You did. But that deal didn’t include sexual encounters.”
“Is this a trick?”
“You tell me. You agreed to be my bride for a year. How do you think I’d react if someone else took your virginity?”
I just stare. Just when I start to see his kinder side, he reminds me of what he’s capable of in the most subtle way.

By nightfall, I’ve withdrawn completely.
I speak only when spoken to, keeping my eyes downcast.
Alexander keeps asking if I’m alright, and I respond with a simple nod.
At dinner, the silence is heavy. The others are clearly mind-linking, trying to figure out why I’m so quiet.
“Is this about earlier?” Isabella asks when we’re alone. “You seemed pretty flustered when you ran in.”
“I’m fine.”
“What did he do?”
“Who?”
“My brother?”
I shake my head. She narrows her eyes at me.
“Whatever it is, I’m sure he didn’t mean it. Alexander’s track record with women isn’t great. But I promise, he likes you. Just give him a chance.”
“I’m going to bed.” I mutter, making a quick escape.

I relish the alone time, taking a long, hot shower and changing into fresh clothes before climbing into bed.
When Alexander comes in, I shut my eyes and pretend to be asleep.
I listen to him move around the room.
He pauses by my side of the bed before getting in on the other.
Suddenly, he pulls me against him.
“I know you’re awake. You can pretend all you want.”
I stay still and silent.
“You’re mad about what I said, but you came to me with that deal. You agreed to the terms. You didn’t have to.”
He sighs. “I said it because it’s true. I don’t want another man’s hands on your body.”
His fingers thread through my hair, brushing it back from my face.
A calloused finger traces my cheekbone. He leans in, pressing his lips to the same spot.
It feels strangely familiar, as if he’s done it a thousand times before.
###Chapter 0037
Alexander

She retreated into her shell again.
Hardly speaking.
When she did, it was only single words.
Yes.
No.
Or that infuriating phrase.
I'm fine.
She shut down completely.
I couldn't understand why.
I had only told her the truth.
Was the truth too painful for her?

In my office, Isabella stared me down.
"Are you certain you did nothing wrong?" she demanded.
"She was talking to me earlier. Now, nothing."
"I simply stated facts. I reminded her she sought this arrangement. She came to me. I told her I allow no one else to touch her."
"Why make a deal if she's already your mate?"
"She doesn't know that."
"You're an idiot!" She dropped into the chair angrily.
"Out of all your brides, why push away the one I actually like? Scratch that—the one who is literally your mate?"
"Enough, Isabella!"
I agree with her. Titan growled.
"I'm not trying to push her away," I snapped.
"You're doing an excellent job of it then!"
"You don't know why she's upset either," I reminded her.
"And watch your tone."
"I'm speaking to you as your sister, not your Alpha!" Isabella scowled.
"I bet even Titan thinks you're being foolish."

I gave her a warning look to back off.
"She isn't like us," Isabella said.
"She wasn't raised in our world. You're missing the point entirely."
"What point?"
"She wants to feel desired. She's not just upset. She's terrified."
"I would scent that level of fear."
"What if she's always afraid? Since before you met. What if that's why her scent seems unusual?"
"Thank you for your input. I'll handle it."

She rolled her eyes and left the office.
Just claim her. Titan muttered.
She is our mate. Claim her. Let her know you only agreed because she's ours.

Ignoring him, I went upstairs to check on Athena.
She pretended to sleep for so long last night, I expected her to still be in bed.
Instead, the shower was running.
I pushed the door open, keeping my eyes away from the shower to respect her privacy.
"Athena, I'll be out most of the day. You can stay here or go to the hospital with Isabella."

No answer.
I glanced over.
She wasn't in the shower.
She sat on the floor behind the bathtub.
Her bare knees pulled to her chest.
Head resting on them.
Eyes closed.
Lips slightly parted.
Asleep, genuinely this time.
She hadn't undressed fully before deciding to nap there.

Quietly, I turned off the shower.
I squeezed behind the tub and lifted her from the floor.
Her head fell back over my arm, exposing her neck.
The urge to mark her surged through me.
Claim her.
But I pushed it aside.
I laid her in bed.
It wouldn't be fair to do that while she slept.

As I moved away, Athena suddenly grabbed my hand.
"Stay," she whispered sleepily, tugging me toward her.
I kicked off my shoes and slid into bed behind her.
Pulling her back against my chest.
Trying to ignore how her naked body pressed against me.

After a moment, she shifted away.
I rolled onto my back, sighing.
Grateful for my self-control.
I left her to sleep.
Outside, I found Sebastian kicking a ball with his sons.
He took one look at my face and sent them to their grandparents.
###Chapter 0038

“Did you tell her?” Sebastian’s voice was low as his sons chased each other across the field.

“No.”

“I take it she’s still not speaking to you?”

“No.”

He nodded slowly. “Remind me again—why keep it from her? That bastard is gone. She’s free. She’s yours to claim.”

“It’s not that simple,” I muttered.

“I get it, but…” He paused. “You wouldn’t have been able to hide it if she wasn’t bound. Is this because of the Lycan rumors? Wolves have done worse and still ended up with humans.”

“Speaking of which,” I said, steering the topic away from Athena. “Has Caleb said anything else?”

Sebastian shook his head. “I told you—he won’t talk to me. No idea why.”

“I’ve searched every database. There’s nothing. How can something like this exist without a trace?”

“Maybe it’s because Silver Creek hid so well. And those rules Athena mentioned.”

“I need to speak with him,” I said firmly.

We headed down to the dungeon. Sebastian banged on the bars, jolting the man who called himself Caleb awake.

“You said they removed you.”

“Good morning to you too,” he yawned, running a hand through his dark hair. The resemblance to Athena was undeniable.

“Yes, I was put up for adoption.”

“Then how did you locate the pack? You were three. No way you remembered.”

“It’s a Lycan thing.”

“You’re saying you can track them?” Sebastian cut in. “Even after being exiled.”

“Yes.”

“How?”

“We’re… connected. Like how you all link minds. Right?”

“How did you find them?”

He shrugged. “Can’t explain it. If there were other Lycan packs out there, they’d find Silver Creek too.”

“Are there others?”

“No. Why do you think Dominic is so desperate to keep them hidden? Our kind is dying. Those you saw are the last. My sister is the last Alpha.” His blue eyes locked onto mine. “You still haven’t told her.”

“Not your concern.”

“She’s my sister,” he argued.

“You don’t even know her.”

“Do you?” he shot back sarcastically. “You’re in love with her but won’t admit it.”

“Enough!” I growled.

He’s not wrong, Titan murmured. I noticed Sebastian raising a brow.

Caleb held up his hands. “Just saying—how do you think she’ll react when she finds out you’ve been hiding this? A secret kept from her entire life?”

“You’re lucky to be breathing.”

“I know. But so is Athena. Haven’t you wondered why Dominic kept her alive?”

“Why?”

“That… I don’t know. I’ve been trying to figure it out for years. Binding her powers makes no sense. If he raised her differently, she’d be just like them.”

“You said he didn’t believe in a female Alpha.”

“I did. But then why let her live? You have to admit, Alpha Alexander, something isn’t adding up.”

“You could be making all this up to save your own skin.”

“Maybe. But even you can see there’s truth in what I’m saying.”

Do you believe him? I asked Titan.

Not sure, he replied. He has no reason to lie. But also every reason.

If I kill him and Athena finds out… she’ll never forgive me. If he’s lying and plotting with Dominic… ignoring it would be foolish.

There was only one path forward.

I had to tell Athena the truth.

But would she be able to handle it?
###Chapter 0039
Athena

I jolted upright in bed, disoriented. My mind was a foggy mess. I distinctly remembered heading toward the shower.

It took a moment to register my state of undress. I wore only my sweatshirt, my legs bare. My gaze darted across the room, landing on my discarded joggers and underwear draped over a chair. A wave of nausea hit me. Had Alexander done something while I was unconscious?

My eyes frantically scanned the room, searching for any sign of him.

“Stop overreacting, Athena,” I muttered under my breath, scrambling out of bed. I hurried to the closet, grabbing fresh underwear and a pair of jeans.

There was no blood on the sheets. Everything seemed normal. Alexander had promised he would never cross that line. But what if I’d given involuntary consent while lost in a daydream?

I dressed quickly and slipped out of the room. On the stairs, I nearly collided with Alexander. His brow was furrowed deeply.

“I was coming to check on you,” he said, his voice tense. “We need to talk.”

A hard lump formed in my throat. Was he going to end our contract already? Or remind me yet again that I had insisted on it?

“Please, come to the office. There’s a lot we need to discuss.”

“Okay.”

“Athena, I need you to engage with me. This is serious. I know you’re upset, maybe even angry. But if this is going to be a one-sided conversation, I can’t help you understand.”

I scowled. What was there to understand? I simply nodded.

Alexander rolled his eyes and stepped back against the railing, allowing me to pass. He followed a few steps behind, maintaining a careful distance.

In his office, he gestured for me to sit. He closed the door and slid the lock into place. My heart began to race. I’d never seen him lock this door before.

He remained behind me for a few seconds, doing something I couldn’t see. Then he moved around the desk and took his seat. The deep frown still etched his features.

“Athena, we’re holding a man in the dungeon. He claims to be your brother.”

“Dominic?” I asked, confused.

“No. He says he’s your younger brother. His name is Caleb.”

“I… I don’t… There was only Dominic.”

“I know that’s what you believe.”

Believe? Dominic was my only brother. Alexander had met him. He should know.

“But the prisoner insists Dominic isn’t your brother. Biologically, he’s your uncle. I have to admit, the family resemblance between this prisoner and you is striking. You and Dominic share no similar features.”

I looked everywhere but at him. I’d called Dominic brother until I was forced to address him as Alpha. There had never been anyone else.

“Are you… Are you saying one of my parents had an affair?”

“No. He believes when you were bound the first time, he was erased from your memory. He didn’t grow up in Silver Creek. He was rejected by the pack and eventually adopted by humans.”

His crimson eyes held mine as I struggled to process this. It sounded absurd.

“You are actually the eldest child of the Alpha. There’s a reason you required a second binding,” Alexander stated. “When you turned eighteen, you were of age to assume the Alpha role. The Alpha gene surged within you.”

“I’m not an Alpha. Just look at me.”

“You may not believe it, but your blood tells a different story.”

I leaned my head back against the chair and closed my eyes. “It’s a lie.”

“Is it? You were bound twice, Athena. Twice. I disagree with binding on principle, but twice? You would have to possess significant power. I think there’s truth in his story.”

“You believe him?” I was shocked he’d accept such a wild tale so readily.

“He isn’t holding anything back.”

“Are you going to kill him?”

“Not at this time. Athena, look at me.” I opened my eyes to find his focus entirely on me. The frown had finally vanished. “Do you want to meet him?”

I shook my head.

“I’ll respect your decision. But may I ask why?”

I shrugged. I had no specific reason. I just didn’t want to.

“Okay,” he muttered. He didn’t press for an answer.

“Where did you find him?” I asked softly.

“Sebastian found him while searching for Dominic and Victoria. The guy fell out of a tree.”

“So he’s from Silver Creek?” Curiosity got the better of me.

“Yes and no. Dominic expelled him. Apparently, he’s been trying to help you.”

“Me?”

“The only thing he kept asking was if you were safe. If I had gotten you out. He hasn’t demanded to see you. He just wants confirmation of your safety. And for me to tell you the truth.”

“That he’s my brother?”

He clenched his jaw. “Unfortunately, there’s more. He wasn’t in human form when he fell.”

“He was a Wolf in a tree?” Wolves can’t climb trees, not in wolf form.

“No.”

“I… I don’t understand.”

“He resembled the creature that attacked my men.” He studied my face closely. “He calls himself a Lycan.”

“Ly… Lycan.” What in the world was a Lycan?

I pulled my knees to my chest, wrapping my arms around them.

“I… I don’t know what that is.”

“You’re not alone. I’ve been searching for information and found nothing. The prisoner claims the Silver Creek pack are the last of their kind. That they’re a dying race.”

It didn’t sink in immediately. “Are you… Am I… Are you saying I’m one of them?”

“Yes.”

“No,” I whimpered. The beast that had attacked was hideous, a monster straight from a nightmare.

“We can’t be certain, not until you’re unbound.”

My whole life, I’d wondered what it would be like to shift. To run as fast as possible through the trees. I wondered if others truly enjoyed it. If they liked becoming an animal and feeling that total freedom. But I didn’t want to become a monster.

“Don’t.”

He raised an eyebrow. “Don’t what?”

“Don’t find someone who can unbind me. Please!” I whispered.

He looked shocked. His eyes widened, eyebrows raised as he stared. “You don’t want to be unbound?”

I shook my head. “Not if I’m going to become a monster.”

“Is that truly what you want? You’ve been bound for nearly your entire life.”

“Then it won’t make a difference, will it?” I shrugged.

“You won’t be able to heal. You won’t be able to protect yourself. You won’t—”

“I understand,” I whispered, lowering my head so he couldn’t see the tears welling in my eyes.

He stood and moved to the window. I seized the opportunity to wipe my tears on my sleeve.

“Are you sure?” he asked quietly.

“Yes… I don’t want to be a monster.”
###Chapter 0040
Alexander

Isabella had been right about the constant fear.
Now I was paying closer attention.
I could hear it in Athena's voice.
But her scent remained exactly the same.
That strange scent she carried from our first encounter until now.
The only difference was the lavender essence that accompanied her.

I could see her reflection in the window.
I watched how she used her sleeves to wipe away escaped tears.
Barely making a sound.

"For what it's worth." I muttered. "Caleb doesn't sound like a monster."
"His priority appears to be you and nothing more."
"As I said, he is very forthcoming with information."

"You mean you haven't had to torture him." She spoke the words slowly as though talking about herself.
I saw how she fidgeted on the seat.
Her head turned over her shoulder to look at the locked door.
Mentioning torture had triggered something.

"No, it wasn't necessary." I wanted to redirect her thoughts.
Turning around to look at her, I saw how tears made her blue eyes brighter.

'Just tell her.' Titan groaned.

Do you really think now is the time? She just asked me to stop looking for someone to help her.
To discover her mate is right here and she can't even sense me—what do you think that will do to her?!

He rolled his eyes at me and fell silent.

Another tear rolled down her face.
I hated seeing her like this.

Moving toward her, I crouched down in front of the chair and cupped her face.
With my thumb, I wiped away the escaped tear.
Her eyes closed and she leaned into my hand, as if seeking comfort.

The words tumbled from my mouth. "Athena, I am your true mate."

A small wrinkle appeared above her eyebrows as they knit together.
Slowly, her eyes opened.
She kept her face resting against my hand and just stared at me.
Staring properly into my eyes like she had when I landed on top of her at Silver Creek.

My heart thudded and I felt a pull toward her.
I barely held myself together, stopping from doing something reckless.

"My... my mate?" she whispered while still frowning.

"Yes, Athena."

"I was mated to Marcus."

"And yet you are mated to me too." It definitely wasn't the reaction I expected.
I thought she would be happy.
Or at least feel some relief.

She pushed herself back as far as she could in the chair, away from me.
"Mated... to you?"

"Yes."

"Are you sure?"

"Trust me. I know, and so does Titan."

"How... how long?"

"A while." Something told me that if I said from day one, she would freak out.

She pressed her pink lips into a thin line and once again looked over her shoulder at the locked door.

"No." she muttered again. "You... you made a deal with me. Why?"
"Is this what you say to all your brides?"
"Is this... supposed to make me feel better?"

The more panicked she became, the more she stuttered.
It would be cute if it were happening for any reason other than panic.
She really was nothing like any of the other brides or any woman I would typically pursue.

Moving to the door, I slid the lock back and held it open.
"If you need to leave, go."
"I know I've sprung a lot of information on you and you probably need time to think."

I watched her nod, but she didn't move from the seat.
"You... you didn't answer my questions."

I left the door open and sat on the desk directly in front of her.
"I have never said it to any of the others."
"I told you I've been searching for my mate for a long time."
"Did I expect it to be you? No."
"Am I happy it's you? Yes."
"I don't care if you're a Lycan or whatever. That isn't important to me."

She bit her nails, not quite looking at me.

"Is that why you were so angry when you found out what they were doing to me? Because of the mate bond?"
She didn't stutter this time.
"You're the only one who didn't join in."
"And you lied to Dominic too."
"You said you met me at the front door."
"You said I was the one who showed you to his office."

"If I hadn't lied to him, he would have beaten you."
"My priority was getting you out of there."

I sighed. This wasn't going at all how I wanted.
"You can't sense the bond, Athena, so I understand if you don't believe me."
"I promise you it's there."
"Think of the smaller things."
"Think of how you feel comfort when I'm holding you."
"Or how you curl up against me in your sleep."
"I know you feel safe when I'm around."
"You can't deny that."

Titan was oddly quiet too.
Because this hadn't gone the way he had hoped.
###Chapter 0041

"You killed Marcus so you could claim me?" Athena's voice trembled.

"Yes."

"I'm... I'm nobody special. You're an Alpha. A powerful one. And I'm not..."

"You're an Alpha too."

She fell silent after that.

She asked to be left alone.

To think.

It frustrated me deeply.

This wasn't how it was supposed to happen.

She should have been happy.

Not fearful.

Not angry.

She should have wanted my claim.

Not tried to run and hide.

'This is your fault.' I snarled at Titan. 'You couldn't let it go. You had to push and push. Look at the mess we've made.'

'In my defense, I thought she'd be thrilled to be mated to the strongest Alpha. Maybe lead with that next time instead of the prisoner!' He shot back.

I headed to the kitchen for food.

Isabella was there, eating. Again.

"Do you ever stop eating?" I snapped.

"I was hungry." She shrugged. "And someone's clearly pissed."

I slammed a mug down.

The handle broke clean off.

Isabella stood and added 'Mugs' to the shopping list.

"We'll have none left at this rate." She muttered, sitting back down. "So. What happened?"

"I told her."

Isabella's dark eyes fixed on me. "You told Athena she's your mate?"

"What else would I be talking about?!"

"Whoa, okay. I'm guessing it didn't go well."

"Do you see her here?" I gestured angrily around the empty room.

She wiped a crumb from her lip. "I'd be mad too."

"Thanks for the support."

"I'm just saying. Not everyone is like Genevieve. Or the others."

"That's enough."

"Sometimes I wonder if you know anything about women." She shook her head, taking another bite of her sandwich.

I waited.

She said nothing.

"What?" I snapped. "You're dying to tell me. So say it. Since you think you know her so well."

"I didn't say that. I said you don't know women. And that, I understand."

She dumped her plate in the sink.

Immediately, she started searching the cupboards for more food.

"Do you think she ever expected to find a mate? For most of us, it's everything. For you, it's everything. I doubt it ever crossed her mind. And you just dropped it on her."

"She can't sense the bond. How else was I supposed to tell her?"

"Doesn't matter now. You can't change it. But you should be with her. Not down here talking to me."

"Alright, smartass. I'm going."

Athena's eyes were wide when I entered the bedroom.

That pull hit me again.

She was perched on the edge of the bed.

Legs dangling.

Like she'd been waiting.

I would never admit to Isabella that she was right. Her ego was big enough.

"It makes sense." Athena whispered. "You wanted me in here. You didn't want me alone with Julian. You said you didn't want anyone else touching me. That was never about the contract, was it?"

"No."

"Because you knew?" She didn't sound angry. Just thoughtful. Putting pieces together.

"Yes." Very few people were allowed to question me like this. To second-guess my decisions. "I thought about telling you. So many times. I thought about just claiming you. Never revealing the truth. I didn't want you to feel obligated because of the bond."

"So you used a contract instead?" She frowned slightly.

"When you say it like that, it sounds ridiculous." I muttered.

I scratched the back of my head.

Nothing I thought to say sounded right.

Nothing would make my poor choices better.

She got off the bed.

She pulled her sweatshirt off.

Underneath, a white fitted tee.

I could clearly see her erect nipples.

I watched her walk to the laundry basket.

She dumped the sweatshirt inside.

She turned back.

Hands on her hips.

"If... if you claim me, will you sense my needs? Will you know if I need help?"

"I will know everything about you. I will feel your every need. I will know all your desires. I will know when you need me."

She loosely tied her hair back.

She closed her eyes.

"Claim me then."
###Chapter 0042
Athena

His strong hands hold my slender waist firmly.
His crimson gaze locks intensely with mine.
“Are you absolutely certain this is what you desire?”

I give a silent nod.

“Athena, I need to hear you say it. Yes or no.”

A tight knot forms in my throat.
My stomach twists with nervous anticipation.
Was this truly my choice?

“Will it cause pain?” My voice comes out barely audible.
I understood he needed to bite my neck.
I knew his canines must penetrate deep.
I knew he would taste my blood and replace it with his Wolf venom.
This would create our permanent bond.
There was one condition to finalize our connection.
We had to consummate our union.

“There might be some discomfort.” He responds honestly.

“What...what will become of me?”

“Immediately? You'll feel deeply satisfied.”
“Within two days, you'll enter your heat cycle.”
“Are you prepared for that experience?”

“You mean I'll desire intimacy?” I whisper softly.

“You'll crave it, require it, become utterly consumed by it.”

“But I don't have my...inner beast.”

“That changes nothing.”
“This is what happens when a female is marked by a male Wolf.”
“Even if you were human, this would still occur.”

He cups my face with his large hand.
“I give you my word, I'll be gentle this first time.”
“So is your answer yes or no?”

“Yes.”

His lips crash against mine with fierce intensity.
He pulls me tightly against his solid frame.
Our bodies press together without any space between.
His lips quickly trail down my neck.
Electric sparks shoot through every place his lips touch.
He pauses just above my collarbone.
His teeth gently scrape across my skin.
He searches for the perfect marking spot.

His tongue flicks over my skin.
As his teeth begin to penetrate, I release a soft whimper.

Alpha Alexander holds me firmly in place.
His teeth sink deeper into my flesh.
After several seconds, he begins to suck gently.
I feel the warm trickle of my blood running down my skin.

When his teeth retract, he carefully licks the wound.
He cleans every escaped drop of blood.
He covers my neck with soft, lingering kisses.
His lips work their way back to mine.

As we kiss, that familiar ache builds within me.
He removes the band from my hair, letting it flow free.
His fingers comb through my locks.
Suddenly his hands fist in my hair as his kiss deepens.

Am I dreaming again?

“No, you're fully awake.” He murmurs breathlessly.

He could hear my thoughts?

“I can.” He smiles against my lips.
“How many times have you imagined this moment, Athena?”

“I haven't.” The lie tastes bitter on my tongue.

“Is that so?” His hot breath whispers against my neck.
His lips trail downward, making my skin tingle.

“So you never imagined me slipping my fingers into your throbbing core?”
“You definitely never fantasized about my tongue tasting you.”
I can hear the amusement in his voice.

The dull throb intensifies into a deep ache.
When his hands slide under my white tee, I don't resist.

His fingers quickly find my nipples.
He kneads them between his thumb and forefinger.
His eyes remain locked with mine.
“You have blood on your top. Remove it.”

I obey without breaking eye contact.
His hands move to my jeans.
He slowly unfastens them.
His fingers skim across my skin, sending more electric shocks through me.

He pushes my jeans down just enough.
His hand slips inside to cup my mound.
Over my panties, he strokes directly over my center.
The internal ache grows stronger.
I desperately want to feel him inside me.

He pushes his hand inside my panties.
His finger sweeps just inside my entrance.
“Is this what you truly want?” He murmurs with a smile.
Amused that he can read my mind so clearly.

I nod eagerly.
He pushes his finger deeper, making me groan aloud.

“But it's not just one finger you want, is it?”
He grins as he pushes in a second finger.
I gasp and clutch onto him tightly.

He moves his fingers in and out of me.
I enjoy the quiet moans escaping my lips.
Suddenly he picks me up and lays me on the bed.
He falls on top of me.
I can feel his hardened length pressing against me.
But he moves away, removing his fingers.
He buries his face between my thighs.

His tongue flicks over my clit.
He licks up my juices until he pushes his tongue inside me.

A long, quiet moan escapes my lips.
My back arches instinctively.
My thighs wrap around his head.
He repeats the process again and again.
Even when my body judders against his tongue.
His movements become more urgent.

Intense pleasure rolls through me in powerful waves.
As I still, he positions himself between my thighs.
The tip of his hard length pushes against my swollen core.
###Chapter 0043

"This might sting a little." His whisper brushes against my skin as he presses forward.

A soft whimper escapes me at the sharp sensation. His lips find mine in a gentle kiss. "Just for this first time."

He moves slowly, inch by inch, giving my body time to accommodate his. When he's fully sheathed within me, he begins a gentle rhythm, watching my every reaction.

As my lips part to moan his name, his thrusts grow more urgent. He drives into me with increasing force.

My moans seem to fuel his passion. He slams into me repeatedly until my body convulses with release. He follows moments later, collapsing atop me.

His lips trace patterns across my skin while he continues moving, emptying himself inside me.

"Was that what you needed?" he murmurs softly.

My fingers brush the fresh mark on my neck as I nod.

"Next time, don't hold back your sounds. I want to hear you let go completely." He tucks a stray strand of hair behind my ear. "Come, you need to clean up."

He crosses the room and starts the shower. Alexander extends his hand toward me. "Now."

I catch my reflection in the mirror, noticing the dried blood on my neck and shoulder.

He pulls me into the shower, pressing me against the cool tiles as he parts my thighs with his knee. His passionate kiss meets mine under the streaming water as I wrap my arms around him.

"I'm far from finished with you." He lifts my legs around his waist.

He suddenly stills, his grip keeping me upright as dizziness washes over me. The world turns hazy, sounds amplifying unnaturally. Water droplets hit the floor like gunshots. Even Alexander's breathing echoes around us.

A strange scent fills the steam—woody and earthy, like ancient forests.

"ATHENA?"

My hands fly to my ears. Why is he shouting?

"ATHENA?"

His voice rings in my ears as he continues calling my name. He finally stops and cuts the water. Wrapping a towel around me first, he frowns thoughtfully rather than angrily. The silence feels like a blessing.

He guides me back to bed before dressing himself and selecting clothes for me.

He signals me to wait before hurrying out. Returning minutes later, he gestures for me to follow without speaking.

He leads me to his office where Isabella waits. The strange woody scent from upstairs lingers here too, mixed with something else.

"Why is everyone so quiet?" My own voice sounds unnaturally loud.

Alexander and Isabella communicate through their mind link. I watch Isabella nod and frown.

"Will someone—" I cover my ears again, unable to modulate my volume despite speaking normally.

'I believe I've discovered why Marcus never properly rejected you.' Alexander's lips don't move, but his mental voice wraps around my mind, calm and reassuring despite the sensory overload. 'To break the binding, you needed to be claimed properly. That couldn't happen while he still held sway over you.'

Isabella approaches with orange foam earplugs. 'These will help until you adjust.'

She gently inserts them. "Better?"

"Thank you," I mumble.

"Everything looks and smells different too, doesn't it?" Alexander asks aloud.

I nod.

"That woody scent is likely my natural aroma to you now. The other scent belongs to Isabella. Everyone has unique scents, though mine will be strongest since I've marked you."

"I'm... free from the bond?" I whisper.

'It appears my mark shattered the binding. The sensory overload comes from never having experienced the full spectrum of our abilities. It will take time, but you'll adapt.'

"I'm truly free?" I need absolute confirmation.

"Yes. But now I think you should meet Caleb."
###Chapter 0044

Alexander's Drama

"Who?" Isabella sputtered.

"Our prisoner." I had given her some information, but not all of it. I might have neglected to tell her exactly what he was.

"Right. And why does Athena need to meet him?"

"Because he claims to be Athena's brother." My mate stood completely still, frozen in time. She hadn't wanted to meet him, and I didn't blame her. But now, he might be the only one who could answer questions about herself. "Athena?"

"No." She shook her head at me. "No, I... I don't want to. You said... you said it was up to me."

"I did. But now I think it will be beneficial. I can't prepare you."

"Prepare me for what?"

"For your first shift."

Her mouth dropped open.

'She has somehow forgotten that part of being unbound,' Titan mumbled.

"It will happen, Athena. You won't be able to stop it. The least I can do is make sure you are prepared."

She looked pained. Instead of lowering her eyes, she stared up at the ceiling as she shook her head.

Her thoughts were just jumbled words that made no sense. She couldn't even form complete sentences. Except for one glaring statement. 'He did this!'

She blamed me.

"Isabella, leave!" I ordered.

Hearing my tone, she didn't question me. She hurried out the door, slamming it shut behind her. Leaving me alone with my mate.

I took a seat. I stared at my newly marked mate as she fought with her own thoughts.

'She blames us?' Titan sighed. 'We only claimed her.'

'And that's the problem. Claiming her unbound her, after she just told me she wanted to stay bound.'

"You blame me?" I asked after a few moments.

Her blue eyes left the ceiling, settling on me. Her fingers went directly to the mark on her neck. Tears pricked at the corners of her eyes.

"You think that I made you a 'monster'?"

She still didn't speak to me.

"Have you ever considered there might be more to why you were bound? I believe that Dominic did it because he feared what you would be capable of."

"I'm... I'm not an Alpha." She shook her head again. "You keep trying to make this out to be a good thing. But if it's true, and... and you really believe that's why Dominic had me bound, then tell me how bad of a monster could I be?"

I walked around the desk and cupped her face. I let her feel our connection, hoping it would be enough to calm her overthinking mind. She leaned into me, closing her eyes. I felt her fear. A fear of the unknown.

Linking Sebastian, I asked him to bring Caleb to my office. If I couldn't get Athena to go to him, then I would have to bring him to her.

After a few minutes of watching Athena internally beat herself up, Sebastian shoved Caleb through the door.

"Ah, Alpha Alexander." Caleb looked back over his shoulder at Sebastian. "You could have at least told me this was where we were going. There was no need to be all mysterious about it."

He turned to look at Athena. "It's been so long."

Athena didn't answer. She sat in the chair in the corner of the room in complete silence. She may not be physically saying anything horrible, but she was definitely thinking it.

"You don't know who I am, do you?" Caleb asked her.

Athena silently shook her head.

"Can you sense her?" I demanded.

"Yes." Caleb muttered without taking his eyes off of her. "And I see you have claimed her. Finally caved to your feelings?"

I saw how Athena pulled her knees to her chest. She yanked her shirt collar up around her neck, hiding my mark. She felt exposed.

"I assume you haven't brought me here so your Beta can have his way with me." He shot Sebastian a suggestive wink.

'Does this guy ever stop talking?' Titan muttered. 'He is just like Julian!'

Sebastian smacked Caleb across the back of the head, telling him to sit.
###Chapter 0045

"Alright, fine." Caleb mutters, raising his hands and sinking into the vacant chair.

"This is the deal. You tell us everything you know about Dominic and his little crew. You tell me and Athena everything about being a Lycan. If you cooperate, I might just let you live."

"That seems a bit unfair. You 'might' let me live." Caleb replies. "After I've given up all my secrets. I've only ever been willing to share information." He grins at me. "Surely you can at least guarantee my safety?"

"It won't be my decision." I mutter.

He turns to look at Athena. "You're letting my sister decide my fate?"

My gaze shifts to my mate, who hasn't moved. She was intently watching Caleb.

"You won't know who makes the final decision." I tell Caleb. "That way you can't try to manipulate or bribe them."

"Well played, Alpha Alexander. Seems you already know my methods. So what do you want to know?"

"Everything. You claim Silver Creek is the only remaining Lycan pack. Where did they originate?"

"Same as Wolves, I suppose. Packs develop over time, created from multiple different..."

Stop. Where did the Lycans originally come from? We are children of the Moon Goddess.

"We are too. There's a story, maybe truth, maybe myth. It goes something like this: a Wolf claimed a human. When they marked the human during a full moon, the human began to change. Shifting into what we now know as a Lycan. Part human, part Wolf. As more were created, they began to procreate. More were born. Neither Wolf nor human, but something in between."

'A Wolf claimed a human?' Titan mutters.

But that wasn't my concern.

"We share many characteristics with you, Alpha Alexander." Caleb continues. "We can shift at will. Females go into heat exactly like Wolves, though I believe our females tend to stay in heat much longer. I can't be certain about that one. Females aren't my preferred choice. We hunt. We feed. We mate. We mark our claimed ones. We are strong. We can heal. The only real difference is our bloodlines started differently." He shrugs like it's common knowledge.

It's impossible to tell if he's lying. Titan tells me.

"You know a lot for someone who grew up adopted." I mutter.

I told you I had someone on the inside. But you killed him. He looks over at Athena. "I'm truly sorry I couldn't protect you."

"Were you there?" Athena asks quietly. "Were you there the day I killed my parents?"

Caleb shakes his head. "Though I was informed about it much later. Victoria should never have put you through that."

"Victoria?" I ask.

Remember what they said about the poison being meant for Victoria's parents?! Titan mutters.

It's no secret she wanted to become Luna. Apparently all the Lycans knew and supported her takeover. She couldn't do that while our parents were still around. She framed Athena, who was next in line to become Alpha.

"They knew? They all knew what Victoria wanted?" Athena asks.

Caleb goes quiet. "I can't say for certain."

"They... they all knew I was set up and they still..." Her voice trails off. Her blue eyes fill with tears.

"I'm sorry... I thought..." Caleb looks back at me. "I thought you had figured it out?"

"There were still some gaps." I mutter. I could hear my mate's heart racing.

"Claim it back." Caleb mutters to Athena.

"I'm not an Alpha." Athena mumbles.

"You may feel that way now, but I promise you, the blood running through your veins says otherwise!"

Caleb gives her a small smile.

Athena keeps her face unreadable.

Only I knew all the thoughts racing through her mind.
###Chapter 0046
Athena

“Enough!” Alpha Alexander’s voice cuts through the tension. His crimson gaze burns into me, even as he addresses Caleb.

“Don’t you want justice?” Caleb’s question hangs in the air. “For everything they did to you?”

“I said that’s enough.” Alpha Alexander’s eyes shift, pinning Caleb in place. “Not another word. Athena has made her choice.”

“I’m only stating facts. The pack is rightfully hers. She could claim it. Take her place as Alpha of the Lycans.”

“And I’m ordering you to stop talking. Now. You will answer questions only. You will not push your agenda on her. Are we clear?”

Caleb’s brow furrows slightly. He obeys, closing his mouth.

Apart from the eyes, he bore a faint resemblance to my father. At least, the fragments I could recall. My memories of him were hazy, fractured.

Except for one. The haunting image of blood streaking down his face as they dragged me away.

“You claimed they all knew.” Alpha Alexander steps closer to Caleb. Was this intimidation? “How?”

“My informant told me.”

“Your informant?”

“You could’ve asked him yourself if you hadn’t killed him.”

I was certain Alpha Alexander would strike. Instead, he just loomed over him. It reminded me of Marcus and the others.

Hovering above me. Whispering all the vile things they planned to do.

Alpha Alexander keeps his fists at his sides. “Dominic had no idea about your spy?”

“No.” Caleb’s eyes flick toward me. “He was the only one who never laid a hand on you. He despised what they were doing. He wanted to beg them to stop, but it would’ve made him look weak. Like a traitor.”

“He should have helped her anyway.”

“He was one Lycan. He couldn’t do anything except feed me information. Otherwise, Dominic would have known.”

“What about you? You stood back and let them brutalize her because you feared death?” Alpha Alexander’s tone is icy.

Caleb looks directly at me. “If it had been Isabella, I would’ve died trying to save her. I wouldn’t have stopped. I wouldn’t have sat back gathering intel from the inside. I would’ve gone in and torn heads from necks to save my sister.”

“It wasn’t that simple.” Caleb protests. “I told you, I tried getting near the house. Once Dominic realized who I was, he made it impossible. I tried.”

Caleb’s blue eyes lock with mine. “I truly tried.”

“Not enough!” Alpha Alexander snaps. He gives a sharp nod to Beta Sebastian.

“Let’s go!” Beta Sebastian grabs Caleb’s arm and hauls him out.

“That did not go as planned.” Alpha Alexander sighs, moving in front of me. “I wanted him to reassure you. To tell you that whatever you become doesn’t matter. Instead, he gave you more reasons to hate yourself.”

“He looks like my father.” I mumble, barely processing his words. “I… I don’t want to believe it. But his eyes… they’re like mine. Like my mother’s.”

“Could you sense him?”

“He smelled… familiar.” I shake my head. “There’s nothing up here.” I touch my temple. “I don’t remember a baby in that house.”

“He says he’s nineteen. That makes him three years younger. You don’t recall a toddler?”

“No. Nothing.” No memory of a baby. Or a small child. I never heard talk of an attack. Never heard Dominic mention increasing security.

But I remember every face that ever hurt me.

“And I will hunt every single one of them down.” Alpha Alexander murmurs, stepping closer to me.
###Chapter 0047

“You can read my thoughts?” I whisper, the concept still unsettling.

“I simply pay close attention.” He moves closer, his lips almost meeting mine when the door violently bursts open.

“What the hell, Isabella?!” Alpha Alexander snarls.

Isabella stands breathless, her dark hair disheveled. “We have a major situation!”

Alpha Alexander turns from me with an eye roll. “What now?”

“She’s here!”

I glance between them. “Who?”

“Are you absolutely sure?” Alpha Alexander questions Isabella.

“One hundred percent. She’s at the hospital right now. And she’s absolutely furious.”

“Who?” I repeat, noticing Isabella’s concern while Alpha Alexander’s face darkens with pure rage. His crimson eyes seem deeper than usual. Perhaps Titan was communicating with him?

They continue talking as if I’m invisible.

“I told her you were hunting to buy time.”

“Did you mention Athena?”

“I enjoy testing your brides, but I’d rather walk into fire than deal with that one.”

Another bride?

Alpha Alexander spins toward me. “Former bride. I absorbed her parents’ pack years ago.”

“The only one who survived.” Isabella mutters. “Genevieve.”

“Stay with Athena. I’ll send Sebastian too.” He gives my cheek a quick kiss and exits, leaving the door wide open.

“Who is she?” I ask.

“He told you, ex-bride.” Isabella smiles weakly, trying to downplay the urgency despite her dramatic entrance.

“I know but… you seemed…”

“It’s nothing. Alexander will handle it. She’s shown up before.”

“What does she want?”

“Uh… she probably heard about you.” She tidies Alpha Alexander’s desk, straightening papers.

“Me?” Why would she come because of me?

“If I tell you, please stay calm.”

I snort. Everything makes me panic lately.

“Genevieve was around the third or fourth bride, I can’t recall exactly. She was obsessively in love with my brother to the point of betraying her own family. Not that he asked her to. But when the contract ended, Alexander chose not to mark her. He didn’t believe she was the one.”

“So he let her live?”

“The only one besides you.” She smiles as if that’s a good thing.

“Why is she here?” My instincts scream to hate her. I’ve never met her, but I despise the thought of Alpha Alexander alone with her.

“She appears shortly after a new bride arrives. Reminding Alexander why he pursued her years ago. She desperately wants him back. She killed her own true mate to be with him.”

“Killed her true mate?” I need confirmation.

Isabella reties her dark hair and nods. “She brought him here. Then, to prove her love, she stabbed her mate through the heart. Believing it would please Alexander.”

“It didn’t?”

“He admired her courage, but no.”

“And he allows her to come here?”

“Technically, since he absorbed her parents’ pack, she belongs to Obsidian Howl.”

“What should I do?”

“We wait.” Beta Sebastian enters, handing me a juice bottle. “And hope she’s just passing through.”

“What if she demands to meet her?” Isabella asks.

Beta Sebastian smirks at me. “It’s different now. Alexander has claimed Athena. We do everything to prevent Genevieve from touching her.”

Touching me??

“You mean… she’s here to kill me?”
###Chapter 0048
Alexander

“That was quick. Your sister lied about you hunting. How disappointing.” Genevieve’s grey eyes scanned me. She ran fingers through her long blonde hair, pulling it back to expose her neck. The unmarked skin was a deliberate display. A reminder of her purpose.

Why is she here? The stupid bitch! Titan snarled.

You know exactly why. Same as always. I sighed.

“Changed your mind, Alexander?” She beamed. “I’m here whenever you need me. Ready for your claim.”

“Took you long enough. Athena’s been here almost a month.”

She frowned. “That’s no way to greet your lover.”

“You stopped being that years ago. Why are you back? My answer never changes. You should know that by now.”

“Don’t be like that. We were amazing together. We still can be. I’m just reminding you. This new one won’t last. I haven’t even heard of her.”

I rolled my eyes. Titan snorted.

“You say that about every woman after you.”

“And I’ve always been right, Alexander.” Her smile turned smug.

“Sorry to break it to you, Genevieve. You’re wrong this time.”

Her eyes narrowed into slits. “I killed my mate for you.”

“You mean for yourself.”

She frowned and slid off the nurses station. “It was for us. You know that.” She stepped closer. “Still denying how much you enjoyed it? I remember your smile when he dropped to his knees. Begging you for help.”

“Desperation doesn’t suit you, Genevieve.”

“Desperation?” She scoffed, eyes wide. “I’m not desperate.”

“You do this every time I take a bride. Hoping I’ll cast them aside. That’s pathetic. You should move on.”

“You can’t speak to me like that.”

“I’m the Alpha here. You’re the outsider. The one who betrayed her family. Leave.”

Her grey eyes narrowed again. “This is my home. I’m back for good.” She grabbed my hands. “Come on, Alexander. We were great together.”

“That was a long time ago. I’ve moved on.” I pulled my hands free. “Get a grip. I already banished my brother. Want to join him?”

“Seriously?” She gasped. “You kicked Julian out?”

“I did. So I’ll ask again. Want to join him?”

“No. I’m grateful you let me come and go. I don’t want to be packless. That’s torture.”

“Then behave. If you try anything with Athena, I won’t banish you. I’ll rip your throat out.”

“What? You wouldn’t.”

“Want to test me?” My tone stayed hollow. Empty. No more games.

“What’s so special about her?” she demanded.

This should be good. Titan chuckled.

“I marked her.”

“You what? You actually marked someone? Claimed her as yours?”

“Yes.”

“You’ve never done that. You rejected all of us. You only almost marked me.”

“No, Genevieve. I was never going to mark you. You were just the only one I let live.”

Her mouth fell open. She folded her arms under her large breasts, pushing her cleavage forward. “You made a mistake, Alexander.”
###Chapter 0049

"I agree."

She flashes a smile. "Oh, so you regret marking her?"

"No. I regret letting you live." I turn my back and walk away. "Keep your distance, Genevieve."

"You can't just walk away, Alexander!" she whines, rushing to keep up with me.

"I do what I want, Genevieve."

"Why are you acting like this? You cared about me once."

"That was then. Like you said, it was a long time ago. There have been others since you. Not once did I come back. Why would now be any different?"

"Because it's me."

Has she not come up with anything new? Titan groans. It's the same old story every time. Please, we were good together, you let me live, blah blah blah. She really needs to get over herself.

"Did she sleep with Julian? Is that why you banished him?"

"No. Stop digging for information."

She pouts her red lips, matching my pace as I head toward the house.

"Genevieve, go away."

"I want to meet the woman who captured your heart."

I stop and glare at her. "You want to meet my mate?"

"Yes. I want to meet your bride."

"She's my mate, Genevieve. Not just a bride. My true mate."

"You found her?" Her voice drops to a whisper. Her eyes widen.

"Yes."

"NO!"

I smile at the disappointment in her voice. It sounds just like the day I ended things.

"Yes. I didn't mark her on a whim. I marked her because she is my mate. The one I've spent years searching for."

"Where did you find her?"

"None of your business."

"I bet she can't even satisfy you, can she?!" she mocks, trying to provoke me.

The last few days of our contract, I had already distanced myself.

She was a good shag. In the end, that's all I enjoyed about her.

The memories amuse me. Genevieve seemed blind to what was happening.

My brother knew. He kept joking about sleeping with her.

But he never did.

Genevieve was the only one he never touched. That said everything.

"I would like to meet her." Genevieve's tone shifts. Her words lighten, as if suddenly pleased.

She's up to something, Titan mutters.

"No," I tell her.

"You can't hide her forever, Alexander. I told you, I'm home. It's time to put down roots. Stop spending all your money on travel." She flutters her eyelashes again.

I'm tempted to kick her out. But so far, she's only made a few comments.

"Did you get a job?" I ask.

"I did. Nothing major. A personal assistant to someone in the city." She digs into her pocket and pulls out the credit card I gave her. "Here." She smiles and hands it over. "Guess I don't need this anymore."

"What game are you playing, Genevieve?"

"No game. Like I said, it's time to stop exploring. Time to settle down. I am a Wolf, after all. We're useless without a pack."

She's done something, Titan mutters.

"What did you do, Genevieve?"

"Nothing." She raises her hands. "I swear I'm telling the truth."

Bullshit! Titan snaps. I agree. The longest Genevieve stayed in one place was when we were together. Even then, she was desperate to travel to far-off countries. She never cared about belonging to a pack. That was one thing I liked about her.

"Why did you go to the hospital instead of coming straight to the pack house? Are you in trouble?"
###Chapter 0050

“You know how much I enjoy provoking your sister. She never changes. I’m sure it infuriates Gabriel.”

She had no idea. She wasn’t there to learn that Isabella and Gabriel were over.

“She’s content.” I lie.

Genevieve stays silent. She’s staring up at the house. I glance over my shoulder. Athena stands on the doorstep. Isabella and Sebastian flank her.

“Is that her?” Genevieve whispers.

“Yes.”

She grabs my upper arm. “She’s not much to look at, is she!”

“Release me.”

“Do you think she can defeat me?” She wonders aloud.

That wasn’t my concern. I could feel Athena’s jealousy from here. If she shifts, I can’t stop it. Isabella and Sebastian can’t stop it. None of us know what Athena is truly capable of.

I seize Genevieve’s hand, bending it back toward her wrist. She whimpers in pain as her arm twists.

“Leave my sight!” I snarl.

“I’m going. I’m going.” She glares toward Athena before stomping off, cradling her arm.

My eyes lock with Athena’s as I approach the house.

“Is she leaving?” Isabella asks.

“No.” I mutter without turning. “She’s decided to stay.”

Athena doesn’t react. She stands completely still, her gaze fixed on mine. She didn’t seem angry, just confused by the jealousy she felt.

“You’re allowing her to stay?” Isabella challenges me. “After everything she’s done. She’s insane.”

“Yes, I agree her choices have been poor. But none of us are entirely innocent. Well, almost none. If she tries anything, she’s gone. I warned her.”

Still, Athena says nothing.

Isabella brushes past me. “I hope you know what you’re doing, Alexander. Don’t let her destroy this.”

“Go inside.” I tell Athena. “I need to speak with Sebastian.”

Athena’s blue eyes shift to my Beta before returning to me. She nods slowly and retreats into the house.

“How much did Isabella tell her?”

“Everything.” Sebastian murmurs. “Once she started talking, she couldn’t stop.”

“And what did Athena say?”

“That’s just it. She didn’t say anything.”

“Nothing?”

“Her last question was whether Genevieve came here to kill her. That’s when Isabella told her everything.”

“Any sign of her shifting?”

“No. I watched her closely.”

I find Athena sitting in the kitchen. Her legs are tucked beneath her as she studies a half-empty juice bottle.

She doesn’t react or acknowledge me as I sit opposite. Her mind was clouded, scolding herself.

“You’ve never felt jealousy before.”

I tell her. “It feels strange, right? Having this urge to attack someone?”

She stops spinning the bottle. Her blue eyes flash up at me. “Why?”

“Because of that.” I point to the mark on her neck. “It will make you feel many things you’ve likely never experienced. Sebastian told me Isabella explained everything about Genevieve.”

“She told me… a lot.” She stutters, a small crease forming on her forehead. “She’s… very beautiful.”

She is furious. Titan mutters.

“She’s not you.” I tell her.

“Did you… did you tell her about me?”

“I told her I claimed you. I told her you’re my true mate.”

She frowns at me. “There’s something I don’t understand. Isabella didn’t say.”

“You want to know why I let her live.”
###Chapter 0051
Athena

“You… you said you killed them.” I knew I shouldn’t question him. But he clearly let her live. If she was here to kill me, I needed to understand why she was the only survivor.

“I did.”

“But not her?” I frowned, completely lost. He was drawing this out on purpose.

“There was never a reason to kill her. I told you—some brides ran. Others tried digging up information on me. She wasn’t clingy. She didn’t beg for my attention. Though that’s clearly changed now. Genevieve did nothing wrong. In fact, she agreed to the arrangement willingly. I was the one who grew tired of her.”

“She killed her true mate.”

“He wasn’t part of this pack.”

“She betrayed her own family.”

“I see Isabella told you everything she knew.” His eyes pinned me from across the table.

“Yes.”

“Genevieve’s family had an agenda. Just like Dominic, they traded her for the contract. The only difference is, they made it look like a tragedy. All along, they planned to hand her over. They wanted me dead. They needed inside information to pull it off. Genevieve found out. So yes, you could say she betrayed them. But she brought the truth to light. It takes a lot for someone to turn on their own blood.”

“You let her live because she helped you survive.”

“It was the least I could do.”

The ugly jealousy inside me faded as I watched him. He had this dark, mysterious edge, but every now and then, he truly surprised me.

“I’m not saying she’s a great person. Or even a good one.”

He continued, “She’s grown bitter over the years. In some ways, I believe the Moon Goddess is punishing her for killing her true mate. Genevieve knew that once she met him and their bond formed, she wouldn’t be able to go through with anything involving me. Much like you when you were still tied to Marcus. I nearly killed you with one kiss.”

“She loved you,” I whispered.

“More than I could ever return.” He frowned.

“Isabella didn’t know?”

“None of them do. It’s not something I share. As far as they’re concerned, Genevieve angered me.”

“And she left?”

He nodded. “I told her she could go wherever she wanted. That I would never let her struggle financially. She returns every time I take a new bride. She tries to convince me she’s still here. Still available. Part of me thinks she’s sizing up the new bride. But I told her we are mated. I’ve warned her.” His voice deepened, eyes locking on mine. “If she tries anything, she won’t leave this pack alive.”

It was a lot to process. Alpha Alexander sat there, watching me, waiting for a response. But what could I say? I had Dominic and Victoria, who set me up. Someone in the dungeon claiming to be my brother. And now this. A woman desperate to have Alpha Alexander as her mate. How far would she go?

“I…” I didn’t know what to say. My fingers traced the raised mark he’d given me. He had marked me. I was the only one.

“I chose you, Athena. I was meant to find you.” He glanced up at the wall clock. “We need to go. You’re going to be late.”

“Late?”

“I found you a tutor. Like I promised.” He rose from his chair, sounding proud. He held his hand out to me. “Come.”
###Chapter 0052

I had more questions.
But I sensed this was his way of ending the conversation.
I almost wished he could read my mind.
Just so he’d know how frustrated I felt.

His gaze flickered toward me.
He stayed silent as we moved through the house and out the back.
He led me across the grounds.
He nodded at various pack members.
Still, he said nothing.

We stopped in front of a house.
It looked run-down compared to the others.
Run-down wasn’t quite right.
It just wasn’t as perfect.

Thick vines covered the building.
They snaked around the windows.
Tall weeds crowded the front.
The path to the door was cracked and uneven.

Alpha Alexander knocked once.
Then he pushed the door open without waiting.
He pulled me into the dim interior.
His hand gave mine a brief, reassuring squeeze.

“Ah, Alexander.”
A man around Alpha’s age stepped out from another room.
He knocked over a stack of books.
They crashed loudly to the floor.

His dark hair was tied in a bun on top of his head.
He peered at me with intense green eyes.
“You must be Athena. And right on time.” He smiled warmly.
He extended his hand. “I’m Theodore, your tutor!”
He beamed, his hand still hanging in the air.

His eyes dropped to the bright orange earbuds in my ears.
“Ah, the memories.”

‘He’s safe.’ Alexander’s voice echoed in my head.

I took Theodore’s hand.
He shook it enthusiastically.
“This way.” He guided me past the fallen books.
He sat me at a small wooden table.

“Alexander tells me you can’t read or write.”
I shook my head slowly.
My eyes darted toward Alpha.

‘You will be fine. I’m right here,’ his voice reassured me again.

Theodore moved around the room.
He pulled random books from teetering stacks.

“Theodore graduated younger than most,” Alexander began telling me. “He even finished before I did. Skipped several grades. If anyone can teach you to read, it’s him.”

Hours passed.
I was making progress, but slowly.
I felt foolish, sounding out each letter.

“Keep going,” Theodore encouraged regularly.
He didn’t rush me.
He was patient.
Far more patient than Isabella had been.

But something felt off about him.
A strange feeling I couldn’t shake.

Alpha Alexander suddenly stood.
“There’s something I need to handle. Stay with Theodore. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”
He kissed my cheek and hurried out.
Crap. He definitely wasn’t reading my mind.

I sat in silence, staring at the closed door.
I didn’t know this man I was left with.
And I wasn’t in the packhouse.

“Athena? Are you okay?” Theodore asked with a smile.
I nodded and returned to the letters.
At least I didn’t have to talk.

“You’re not much of a talker, are you?” He leaned over my shoulder from behind.
His closeness felt trapping.

“Could I... get some water?” I asked quietly.
I just wanted him to move away.

“Sure.” He chirped and stepped back.
I used the moment to stand up.
I needed to avoid feeling cornered.

“He’ll be back soon. No need to worry.” He handed me a glass of water with a smile.
Then he held his hands up. “I’m not going to do anything.”

My eyes darted back to the chair.
###Chapter 0053

I flinched back.
He raised his hands in a placating gesture.
“Sorry. I invaded your space. You clearly don’t like that. My bad. Personal boundaries aren’t exactly my forte.”
Theodore moved to sit on the faded sofa beneath the window.
His intense green eyes flicked to the glass I was clutching.
“Planning to use that as a weapon?”
“No... I wasn’t...” The thought hadn't occurred to me until now. Maybe it wasn't a terrible idea.
“Relax, it’s not poison. I’m not an idiot. I have no desire to have Alexander disembowel me. It’s just water. From the dispenser.” He gestured toward what I assumed was a kitchen.
I still didn’t take a sip.
“When were you unbound?” Theodore asked out of the blue.
“What?”
He pointed to his own ears. “Those are a dead giveaway.”
“Not long ago,” I mumbled.
“It’s a nightmare, right? The hearing is the worst part. Feels like your skull might split open. Do those help?” He nodded at my earplugs.
“A little. It’s... still overwhelmingly loud.”
“Took me a solid year to adjust.”
“You were bound?” I couldn’t hide the shock in my voice.
He nodded.
“Alpha Alexander did that?” I knew his feelings about my binding. I couldn’t picture him doing it to someone else.
“God, no. I was born into a different pack. I wasn't what they wanted. ‘Too clever for your own good.’ That’s what they always told me. When school started, Alexander and Sebastian were the only ones who didn’t torment me. They stood up for me. Brought me back here. Alexander let me stay.”
Alpha Alexander had saved him. Given him a new life.
“They bound you for being smart?”
“Ridiculous, isn’t it? Why were you bound?”
“I...” I wasn’t sure if Alpha Alexander wanted me sharing this. “I was framed for my parents’ murder.” I stuck to that story, avoiding the whole firstborn monster mess.
“Damn. People are seriously messed up.”
“You... you don’t have a mark.” His neck was completely bare.
“Not every binding is broken the same way. For me, Alexander found someone who could undo it. The hearing... it does get better, eventually.” He offered me a grin. “Now, come on. You need to practice.”

I settled into the chair while he remained on the old sofa, respecting the space between us.

When Alexander returned, he entered without knocking.
He asked how I was progressing.
“She’s getting there,” Theodore answered.
I saw him wink. “But like I said, she won’t be a master reader by morning. It’ll take time. Daily practice.”
“That’s enough for today. She’ll return tomorrow. Same time?”
“Sure. Maybe just bring your own water bottle next time. I’d prefer Athena not suspect me of attempted poisoning.”
Alexander raised an eyebrow at me as Theodore laughed.
I was utterly mortified.

We walked back across the grounds.
Alexander’s hand was wrapped tightly around mine.
“Did... did you take me to him because... he was bound once?” I whispered as his pace quickened.
“Did it help?”
“No... I...” I pulled my hand free and stopped walking. My feelings were a jumbled mess.
His rough fingers gently lifted my chin, forcing me to meet his gaze.
“I thought it might help, knowing you aren’t alone in this. And Theodore is a good man. I’d prefer you didn’t accuse him of poisoning you.”
“I didn’t accuse him.”
“You considered it.”
“I... You were reading my mind and you still left me there.” Annoyance began to simmer inside me.
“I was right outside. If Theodore had tried anything, I would have known.”
My scowl deepened. “You were testing me?”
###Chapter 0054
Alexander

“That wasn’t a test,” I say softly.

She tilts her head. “Then what was it?”

“He’s the best tutor I could find for you. The only one I trust not to lay a hand on you. I need to know you can handle sessions alone with him. As much as I enjoy watching you learn, I have a pack to lead. I still need to track down Dominic and Victoria.”

Her frown slowly fades.

“Not everyone wants to hurt you, Athena.”

She hesitates. “He... he asked why I was bound.”

“I heard.”

“Was it okay that I told him? Should I have said more?”

“You didn’t lie.” I offer a small smile. “But it’s time I address the pack. Tell them everything. If you shift, Athena, and I’m not there...” I trail off, holding her gaze. Fear lives in those blue eyes. Fear of their judgment.

“I won’t shift.”

“You can’t promise that. Caleb mentioned the signs. The first shift is often uncontrollable. It happens when you least expect it. Honestly, I thought it might happen when you saw Genevieve.”

Her eyes glisten with unshed tears.

She rarely asks about shifting. It’s clear she hopes to suppress it entirely.

“Come. You must be hungry,” I murmur before panic fully takes hold.

She nods silently and takes my hand, following me toward the house.

“Go ahead to the kitchen. I need to check on something.” Genevieve’s scent lingers in my office. I won’t let Athena near her.

‘What does she want now? We were clear,’ Titan grumbles. He wants to stay with Athena. So do I. Her heat could start any moment.

Reluctantly, Athena releases my hand and heads toward the kitchen.

I push open the office door. “What do you want?”

Genevieve beams from my chair. “Hey, Alexander. I was thinking we could grab a meal? Catch up, like old times.”

‘Is she insane?’ Titan snaps.

“No.”

“Come on, just as friends,” she pleads. “I won’t try anything.”

‘She doesn’t know the meaning of friendship,’ Titan scoffs. I fight back a laugh.

“No. Get out of my chair.”

She spins once before standing. “I’m not trying anything, Alexander. It’s just... I don’t have friends here. I could use one. You know me better than anyone.”

“You should’ve tried harder back then. I have a pack to run, Genevieve. I can’t just disappear for dinner to ‘catch up’.”

“We went out all the time when we were together.”

“The pack was smaller then. It’s grown tenfold since.”

Light catches her grey eyes as she grins. “I’ve noticed. I always knew you’d be a great Alpha. You just need the right Luna beside you. Are you sure she’s the one?” She twirls a strand of blonde hair.

“Don’t judge someone you don’t know.”

She rolls her eyes. “I saw her, Alexander. She’s weak. Full of fear. Not fearless like me. A fearful Luna is a useless Luna.”

“Like I said, you don’t know her. Now, unless it’s important, you can leave.”

Frowning, she heads to the door. “She won’t make you happy, Alexander.”

I watch until she’s completely left the house.

‘She’s never going to give up,’ Titan mutters. ‘We’d be better off killing her.’

‘When the time comes, I won’t hesitate. But right now, she’s not a threat.’

I find Isabella in the kitchen with Athena. They’re sharing a tub of ice cream.
###Chapter 0055

"I know you don't want to hear this, but Julian is doing alright." Isabella murmured around her spoon.

"You've spoken to him?"

She shook her head. "He called me."

"I know you miss him Isabella, but you understand my reasons, don't you?"

"Of course. The more I think about it, the more surprised I am that you waited this long. You did what was necessary."

My gaze shifted to my mate. She had turned away from me, her hair tied up. Her scent was subtly changing, beads of sweat forming on her neck. I watched her jam the spoon into the ice cream tub and quickly into her mouth, as if that would solve everything.

'Her heat is starting.' Titan murmured.

'She's resisting it.' I observed, watching her take another frantic bite.

My sister's eyes suddenly widened as she recognized Athena's changing scent. "I should go." She dropped her spoon in the sink and hurried from the kitchen.

"Are you alright?" I smiled at my mate as I took Isabella's vacant seat.

"Yep." Her voice came out higher than usual.

"I am your mate. If you need satisfaction, I'm more than willing to help." When her full heat hit, I wouldn't be able to control myself around her either.

"Is this...my heat?" She whispered, pulling at her t-shirt collar.

"Yes." I turned her chair to face me, locking my knees on either side of hers, forcing her thighs together. "You're in the early stages. It will intensify. Fighting it will only..."

"I know. I just..."

She didn't know how to tell me she wanted to be taken.

In one swift motion, I pulled her from the chair onto my lap. She gasped as her chest pressed against mine. Her heart raced wildly beneath my touch. Her legs dangled on either side of mine, barely reaching the floor as I gripped her hips.

"Here?" She whispered as I pulled her t-shirt over her head.

"It's my house."

Her skin flushed, more sweat beading on her brow. Her blue eyes locked with mine as I took a nipple between my teeth. I loved that she rarely wore bras.

As she shifted on my lap, she could feel my hardening length beneath her.

I dragged my teeth over her nipple. She released a low moan and pushed her hips down, squeezing her thighs against mine.

She pulled my face to hers. Her lips met mine with desperate hunger, a deep need I'd never experienced with anyone else.

Lifting her slightly, I ripped her jeans from her body. A fresh wave of her arousal filled the room. My cock strained against my jeans, desperate to be free, to fill her tight wetness.

Pulling her damp panties aside, I slid a finger inside her. She groaned against my lips.

"More." she whispered.

I was happy to oblige. Her mouth fell open as I added a second finger. Her back arched, and my cock throbbed with need.

I quickly moved her onto the table, pulling her panties off and freeing myself. I pressed against her entrance.

"Is this what you want?" I mused, pushing the tip inside.

"Yes." she gasped, trying to pull me closer.

"Turn around."

She looked confused but slowly turned, leaning over the table. Reaching around to cup her, I spread her open and slid into her from behind. She moaned deeply as I held her tight, letting her adjust.

Her hands gripped the table's edge as I thrust deep. Her moans made my cock spasm. Her muscles clenched around me, tightening with every movement.

I could hear her thoughts. I knew exactly what she needed as I drove into her harder. She wanted more, and I knew this was just the beginning of her heat.
###Chapter 0056
Alexander

Four endless days.
Four days consumed by primal need.
I handed pack responsibilities to Sebastian.
I informed Theodore that Athena’s lessons must wait.
For four days, my world narrowed to her.
Her heat dictated everything.

She lies sprawled on her stomach now.
Deeply asleep.
Her usual lavender scent finally permeates the room.
The overwhelming arousal has faded.
I press my palm to her bare back.
Her skin is cooler.
The fever has broken.
Her heat is over.
She can rest properly.

Finally.’ Titan grumbles.

You enjoyed every moment.’ I retort.

Not the tears.’

She was overwhelmed.’ I snap. ‘She’s sore. Exhausted. Try enduring a four-day heat after only one prior experience.’

He falls silent.

She doesn’t stir as I shower.
She shifts slightly in her sleep.
Soft snores escape her.
I kiss her cheek.
I leave her to rest and head to my office.

Being disconnected from my pack grated on me.
But I trusted Sebastian.

He’s already in my office.
His head is in his hands.
His knee jiggles, repeatedly tapping the desk.

“Report.” I say.

“Is it over?” He looks up, desperate. “Please tell me it’s finished.”

“Yes. Four days. She’s finally free. Now, what’s wrong?”

“Four days is… a long time.” He avoids the question.

“Caleb said it would be prolonged. She’s asleep. She’ll be out for hours. What is the problem?”

He won’t meet my eyes. “We have a visitor.”

“Who?”

“Madame Zora.”

My jaw tightens.
“The last time we met, she wanted no part of this.”
I stride across the grounds, Sebastian following.
“Now she appears offering help?”

“She claims to possess vital information.”

“It’s too late. Athena is already unbound.”

“I told her that.”

“And she still insists her information is valuable? I assume she demands payment. She always does.”

“She didn’t state a price. But she’s been a constant stress since arriving.” Sebastian mutters. “Although my sons adore her.”

“Why is she at your house?”

“Would you prefer her in the pack house? You weren’t exactly confined to one room.” A smirk plays on his lips.

“I recall you getting caught with Natalie in the school janitor’s closet. Privacy has never been your concern.”

“Anyway,” he continues, “I informed Madame Zora we already know about Athena. The truth is out. But she insists there is more.”

We halt outside his house.
Laughter echoes from within.

“Alpha Alexander.” Madame Zora opens the door. “I’m pleased you came. I know you’ve been… preoccupied.” She glances back at the boys, then at me. “This discussion is not for young ears.”

“Boys,” Sebastian commands. “Go to your grandparents.”

They complain but eventually leave.
Sebastian watches until they enter the neighboring house.

“You fled last time we met.” I take a seat at the small kitchen table.

“Yes. I apologize for my abrupt departure, Alpha Alexander. I was unprepared to discuss Silver Creek then.”

“And you are now? I already freed Athena.”

“So I’ve heard. But what you do not know is that Athena has been bound more than twice.”
###Chapter 0057

Sebastian frowned at her. "You never mentioned that."

"Athena's past holds many buried secrets."

"Let me guess, another million?" Alexander scoffed.

"Not this time. This time, you truly need to know."

"What the hell are you talking about?" Alexander's patience wore thin.

"Athena has been bound at least four times. Possibly more. It wasn't until I heard her pack's name that I realized who you spoke of. The newborn I bound myself."

"Four times?" Titan muttered, sounding alarmed.

"You bound her as a baby?" Disgust laced Alexander's words.

Madame Zora tapped her long nails on the table. "You claim to know she's a Lycan."

"Yes, though my knowledge is limited."

"They shift at thirteen." She smiled as if sharing vital information.

"I was made aware. What does that have to do with you binding her?"

"She shifted on the day she was born."

Alexander and Sebastian exchanged glances, speaking together. "That's impossible."

"I witnessed it myself, Alpha Alexander. Until recently, you didn't even know her kind existed."

"Bullshit." Alexander snapped, rising from his chair.

"She was different. She is different." Madame Zora sighed.

"You said four times. Her eighteenth birthday, age six, as a newborn, and when else?"

"Shortly after turning one."

"One? What could a one-year-old possibly do?"

"She began shifting again. Her father was desperate. He called me again. This time, she was strong. Powerful. I watched her shift in and out of her beast form like it was a game. Almost as if she knew why I was there."

"How could a one-year-old understand your intentions?" Sebastian asked.

"You tell me. To seal the binding, she needed to be in human form. Otherwise, she'd be trapped as a Lycan. We waited days. She fought sleep, forcing herself to stay awake. Like she knew what was coming."

It sounded nothing like his shy, stuttering mate. Years of abuse had perhaps hollowed her out, leaving a shell of her former self.

"You bound her twice. Who bound her at six and eighteen?"

"I don't know. But I tried to warn you, Alpha Alexander. I told you she had strong Alpha blood. I was right. I am right."

"Why come now? Why wait so long to tell me? What do you want from this?"

"Nothing."

"Nothing?" Sebastian questioned. "You've been pestering me for days just to say this?"

"She's not just your bride, is she, Alpha Alexander? She's your mate. Destined to be at your side."

Alexander remained silent.

"Hmm. The Moon Goddess works in mysterious ways."

"What the hell is that supposed to mean?" Alexander snapped.

"You are a powerful man, Alpha Alexander. You are either being tested or you have met your match. She will either break you or make you." Madame Zora stood. "Now I must go."

"That's it? You drop this bombshell and just leave?"

"There is only so much I can reveal, Alpha Alexander. I don't know what that girl is capable of. I only know what I felt around her as a baby. I felt it the moment I entered your pack."

"Felt what?"

"Her power." She locked eyes with him. "That is what drew you to her, long before you scented the mate bond."
###Chapter 0058
Athena

I woke up alone.
Every muscle in my body ached.
A dull throb pulsed between my thighs.
The memories of last night flooded back.
The sex had been incredible.
My intense urges were finally satisfied.
I could think clearly again.
But my body was paying the price.

I tiptoed across the room, wincing with each step.
I turned on the bath faucet.
I didn't wait for the tub to fill completely.
I stepped into the warm water immediately.
I slowly lowered my sore body into the soothing heat.

The door opened.
I recognized Alexander's woody scent before I saw him.
His crimson eyes scanned the empty bed first.
Then they found me in the bath.

"Sore?" He smirked as he walked toward me.
I nodded and sank deeper into the water.
The water rose to my chin.

"It won't always feel like this." He smiled softly.
He leaned over the tub and kissed my forehead.
Then he moved to the large chair by the window.
He turned it to face me and sat down.

"You don't remember much from your childhood, do you?"
I shook my head silently.
He was watching me intently again.
Just like he had in Dominic's office.
That same curious expression.

"Has Caleb... Has he said something?" I asked quietly.
"No." His voice sounded distant. "I haven't spoken to him."
"Did I do it wrong?" He was my first and only.
I wasn't sure if I had performed well.

He laughed and shook his head. "No, you were perfect."
I soaked in silence, waiting for him to continue.
But he remained quiet, just watching me.

I finally got out and began drying myself.
He went to the closet and picked out clothes for me.
I was slowly getting used to him doing that.

"Are we going somewhere?" I asked as he handed me trainers.
I had hoped to stay here and rest.
"We need to speak to your brother. I have questions. I want you there to hear his answers."

He said he hadn't spoken to Caleb.
What happened while I was asleep?

Walking through the snow toward the dungeons made me uneasy.
Something had definitely occurred.
I wasn't sure I wanted to know what it was.

Alexander pulled the heavy door open.
He stepped into the darkness first.
He flicked the lights on as he descended the steps.

"Caleb?" Alexander called out. "Are you awake?"
"You brought me a visitor. How could I sleep through my sister's arrival?"
He yawned as I stepped in front of his cell.
He looked well-rested.
Someone had given him a small bed, water, and fresh clothes.
He had better treatment than I received under Dominic and Marcus.

"You look comfortable." Alexander's voice was quiet.
"Your gorgeous Beta was kind enough to bring me some comforts. He thought it might make me more talkative. He seemed annoyed that I would only speak to you."
Caleb grinned. "Tell me, is he seeing anyone?"

"He isn't into men. I believe he made that very clear." Alexander's tone was low.
"Such a pity. Anyway, how can I help you?" Caleb stood up and stretched.

"Witches." Alexander stated simply.
"Witches? Any particular witch? Not that I've met any."
"You said you had inside information. Was there talk about witches visiting? Specifically concerning Athena."

My head snapped toward Alexander.
But his focus remained entirely on Caleb.
###Chapter 0059

“I don’t know their names. But I believe it was a Witch, or perhaps several, who bound her. No one else possesses that kind of power.”

“That is precisely why I am asking you.”

Caleb shakes his head slowly. “I don’t know what you want me to say, Alpha Alexander. There was no mention of any Witch. Dominic worked tirelessly to keep Silver Creek hidden from other kinds. He didn’t allow outsiders in easily.”

“What exactly do you mean by that?” Alexander demands.

“Whoever bound her as a child… would be the same one who bound her again as an adult.”

“Do… do you know who he’s talking about?” I ask Alpha Alexander quietly. Maybe that’s why he’s been acting so distant.

“Not yet,” he mutters. He turns toward the stairs and holds out his hand. “Come. It’s time for your lesson with Theodore.”

“Lesson? Ooh, what are you practicing? Fighting?” Caleb asks, his fingers curling around the bars. “Is this Theodore handsome too? It gets a bit boring seeing the same faces down here all day.”

“Reading lesson,” I murmur without thinking.

“It’s about time someone taught you to read and write.”

“What… what did you just say?” I’ve kept it a secret for so long. Isabella figured it out. I accidentally told Alpha Alexander. But I never told anyone else.

Caleb says nothing. He retreats back against the wall.

“Answer her,” Alpha Alexander growls.

“It’s nothing.”

“How… how did you know that?”

“My person on the inside told me.”

Alpha Alexander knew I hated talking about it. He knew I would never willingly tell another soul. Even Dominic thought I could read. The truth was, I just learned to recognize things without reading labels.

“Your story is falling apart, Caleb.” Alpha Alexander paces in front of the cell. “I knew there was something off about you.”

“Honestly, that’s what he told me.”

“His name?”

“He never gave me a name.” Caleb looks directly at me. “He was blonde. At least six feet tall. Almost black eyes. Always seemed happy.”

“You trusted someone from the pack who wouldn’t even give you their name.”

“They didn’t want to be caught.”

“Bullshit!” Alpha Alexander snaps. “I’ve heard lies before, but this is ridiculous.”

“He’s… telling… the truth,” I mutter, vaguely remembering someone who matched Caleb’s description.

“This guy wouldn’t know the truth if it bit him,” Alexander says sharply.

“He didn’t come to the house often.” It was like an old memory scratching at the back of my mind. Little pieces flickered through. “He dropped off a list that Marcus had given him. He made a joke about me not reading it… and then read it out loud for me.”

Alpha Alexander is staring at me intently. “Are you sure?”

“My memory is bad. It’s like… most of the good stuff from when I was little is gone. I only remember the worst parts.” The blood-soaked faces of my parents flash before my eyes.

“That’s what Dominic wanted, Athena. If you remembered all the good things, you would’ve been a threat. He had to make you weak,” Caleb mutters.

“Again, you know a lot for someone who was never in the house,” Alpha Alexander growls. He grabs my hand and tugs me back up the stairs and out into the cool air.

“I don’t like him!” he states firmly. “There’s just something about him that rubs me the wrong way.” He grabs my shoulders and turns me around. “Partial truths don’t mean he’s telling the whole truth.”

“You mean like how you’re not telling me why you’re being so weird?”
###Chapter 0060
Alexander

Occasionally, sharp little remarks would slip through, catching both of us off guard.

“I’m not acting strange. There’s just a lot happening right now.”

“You’re being foolish again!” Titan grumbled.

“What should I say? ‘By the way, you were bound more than twice because they were terrified of you.’ Or maybe, ‘Don’t worry about shifting—you’ve already done it!’ Do you think she wants to hear that, Titan? She’s terrified of shifting!”

“Fine,” he sulked. “Handle it your way.”

“You…you still haven’t said anything,” Athena murmured. “Is Titan…is he saying something to you? Is he talking about me?”

“Titan cares about you as much as I do. We just have different opinions on how to handle certain situations.”

Her brow furrowed slightly. “He wants you to…tell me something?” Her frown deepened.

“Not here,” I muttered, glancing around at my pack members moving nearby. I took her hand and led her back toward the house, shutting us inside my office.

She dropped into a chair and immediately pulled her knees to her chest. It took me some time to realize this was her way of protecting herself—a defense against Dominic and his followers targeting her ribs and stomach. Now, it had become a habit whenever she felt vulnerable.

“It’s bad, isn’t it?” she whispered. “Genevieve is back, and now you and Titan have decided…”

“This has nothing to do with Genevieve.”

“I don’t…I don’t understand.”

“Over the past few days, we’ve spent a lot of time in the bedroom. During that time, we had a visitor.”

“Dominic?” she asked, alarmed.

“No. A Witch.”

“Oh.”

“The same Witch who bound your abilities.” I delivered the news slowly, like peeling off a bandage. “When you were a newborn pup.”

Her forehead wrinkled, eyes widening. “No…I was six.”

I held back the rest for now and explained that this was the same Witch I had met to discuss unbinding her. The same Witch who had fled when I mentioned the name of Athena’s pack. Now I understood why.

“She helped Dominic?”

“No, Athena.” I sighed. “She helped your father.”

Her eyes dropped from mine. Her hands gripped the armrests, knuckles turning white as she squeezed the wood. I felt her anger surge.

“My…my father?”

“Yes.”

“My father…he wanted me bound?” She spat out the words.

Her anger faded quickly, replaced by tears welling in her eyes.

“I know this isn’t what you want to hear, Athena, but from what she told me, I don’t think it was only Dominic and Victoria responsible. I believe it goes back further.”

She sat there, staring at me with her blue eyes. My heart ached for her. I had never encountered a pack like this—secrets thicker than blood, all centered around her.

“W…why?”

“They feared you.”

She let out a nervous laugh. “Me?”

I had to tell her the truth.

“You were able to shift at birth, Athena. They had you bound, and then when you were one, you started shifting again. Your Lycan side was fighting it. You, at one year old, understood why the Witch was there. You purposely kept shifting into a Lycan, hoping she wouldn’t be able to bind you. Athena, that’s unheard of.”

“For Wolves,” Titan muttered.

Athena stared at me as if I were insane. Pure disbelief that I would suggest she had already shifted. Her mind refused to accept it.

“You’re…you’re wrong. I would know. I…”

“You wouldn’t remember. No pup would or could remember that.”

“I… That can’t be. You’re wrong.”

“I’m only repeating what the Witch told me.”

“You believe her.”

“Madame Zora can be elusive at times, but she has always eventually told me the truth. Even if it’s like drawing blood from a stone. Sometimes cash makes her more cooperative. But this time, she didn’t even want money.”

“She’s not listening,” Titan muttered.

I glanced back at Athena. Her eyes were closed, nose wrinkled as she frowned.

“Are you okay?”

“I think I’ve heard that name.”

“Madame Zora?” I asked curiously.

Her jaw clenched as she nodded.

“From someone here?”

“No, it’s just…something up here.” She tapped her head. “It feels familiar.”

“Like I said, they feared you, Athena. That’s why the Witch was involved. They fear a female Alpha.”

“I’m not—”

“You are a rare female Alpha of a dying breed.”

She stood and moved around the desk to the window. “I’m not powerful, Alpha Alexander. I’m just me…the girl who was made a slave. I’m not…I’m not anything powerful. And I wish…please stop saying it.”

I felt her sadness. She refused to believe it was possible.

“If they are dying, let them die out,” she muttered, still gazing out the window.

“Let them die out?” Her comment surprised me, and I needed to confirm what I had heard.

She turned to me slowly. A tear traced its way down her cheek, but her expression was filled with anger. “They did horrible things to me. They don’t deserve to live.”
###Chapter 0061

A dark thought flickered in her mind. It was a hidden part of her, buried deep beneath the persona she'd built over the years. Most would find it disturbing. I found it electrifying. It called to me. I needed to draw it out.

A sharp knock interrupted us. Isabella’s familiar scent drifted through the door. The conversation halted. From Athena’s thoughts, I sensed her relief.

“Enter,” I called.

My sister stepped inside. Her eyes darted between Athena and me, assessing. “Can I take Athena shopping?”

“Shopping?”

“A few of us are heading into the city. I thought she might like to come. Unless I’m interrupting something important again?”

“That’s her decision.” I watched my mate, listening to her silent worries.

She shook her head. “I’m not… I’m not ready.” Her gaze shifted to me. “It might not be safe.”

“Nothing will happen,” Isabella insisted. “The city is neutral territory. Fighting is forbidden there. I’ll be with her. We’ll keep her safe.”

“Who is ‘we’?” I asked.

“Me, Theodore…” She listed a few others.

“Theodore is going?” Shopping was hardly his style.

“He wants more books. You know how he is. Won’t have them delivered in case the pages get bent.” She rolled her eyes. “I figured you’d want a chaperone.”

“So you recruited him?”

“Exactly.”

I turned back to Athena. “She’s right. The city is safe. I trust Theodore.”

“What about Dominic?” she whispered.

“I doubt he’d go there.” I locked eyes with Isabella. “If there’s any trouble—”

“We’ll get her out immediately.”

I moved closer to Athena, turning her to face me. “Isabella has gone to the city weekly since childhood. She knows it better than anyone. If you don’t want to go, that’s fine too.”

“You don’t… you don’t want me to go.” She kept her eyes down. “I can feel it.”

“I’d prefer you where I can reach you instantly. But hiding won’t help you conquer your fears. I trust my sister. I trust Theodore. They won’t let anything happen to you. Anyone who tries would be incredibly stupid.”

“Every Wolf knows who my brother is,” Isabella added. “Gabriel made sure of that.”

She claimed she didn’t blame me for Gabriel’s rejection. But her words sometimes suggested otherwise. I ignored the comment, focusing on my mate. “It’s your choice, Athena.”

“What if I…”

“We’ll have to trust that you won’t.”

I felt Isabella’s stare burning into me. I still hadn’t told her about Athena being Lycan.

“Wait, what?” Isabella’s eyes shot to Athena when I finally revealed it. “You’re telling me she looks like that thing you killed?”

“Yes.”

“So she’s not a Wolf?” She glared, demanding answers.

“Technically, from what I understand, they are part Wolf.”

“Technically?” she sputtered.

“Yes.”

‘This is going great,’ Titan groaned.

“Okay, so the guy in the dungeon, claiming to be her brother. He’s one too?” Isabella asked.

“Yes.”

“And you’re letting him live?”

“For now. Are you questioning my decision?” My tone was a clear warning.

She turned to Athena, her expression softening. She likely realized her words applied to my mate too. “Are you okay?”

Athena shook her head.

“Then you definitely need to come. Escape this madness for a few hours. Clear your head. Spend a fortune on my brother’s credit.”

Athena’s blue eyes found mine.

“Your choice,” I repeated.

Reluctantly, she agreed. She spent the next hour seeking reassurance.

She asked me one last time before getting in the car.

“Just try to enjoy yourself,” I told her.

Isabella pulled her into the vehicle. “I’ll watch her. If it’s too much, we’ll return immediately.”

“You don’t usually like the clingy ones,” Sebastian remarked as the car drove away.

“This is different.”

“Because she’s your mate? Because you marked her?” He raised a brow.

“She’s clingy out of fear, not possession. She needs time.”

“How did Isabella take the news?”

“She focused more on me sparing Caleb. It took her a moment to realize wanting him dead would make her a hypocrite regarding Athena.”

“Isabella doesn’t usually make friends easily. She must like Athena. Especially to invite her shopping. She’s never done that with anyone else.”

I nodded. My sister preferred the hospital to social events.

“I need you to do something for me,” I said as the car disappeared.

“You want me to watch her?”

“Just as a precaution.”
###Chapter 0062
Athena

Theodore gives me a warm smile as I slide into the car. Isabella introduces the other two women, but she thankfully doesn’t reveal my secret. I had hoped she would keep it to herself, even if just for a little while.

“You’ll be okay.” Isabella keeps her arm linked with mine when I start to fidget. “We’re all here with you.”

“I’ve never…” I could feel the other women staring.

“I know, that’s exactly why I suggested this. You can’t stay hidden in the pack forever. It’s good to meet new people. To learn there’s more out there than just us.”

“Though Obsidian Howl is definitely the superior pack.” Theodore winks at me.

Isabella pulls a small black card from her pocket and hands it to me. “This is from Alexander. He thought you wouldn’t take it directly from him, so he asked me to give it to you.”

“What is it?”

The other women giggle, amused by my ignorance, and Isabella shoots them a sharp look with her dark eyes.

“It’s a credit card.”

“Right.” I take the black card from her, turning it over in my fingers. I had never held one before. I never had any use for money.

“I’ll show you how to use it when you buy something.”

“I don’t need his money.”

Isabella snorts. “You should enjoy it. It’s not like he’s short on cash.”

For a moment, I wondered how he made his money. It wasn’t like he had a regular job.

"Taxes." Theodore mutters as he opens a book to read.

"Taxes?"

"From contracts." He confirms.

"Plus Alexander owns several businesses in the city." Isabella adds. "He has very deep pockets."

The other women in the car giggle again, and I see Theodore roll his eyes.

By the time we reached the city, the scents were overwhelming. Traffic, Wolves, food, others I couldn't identify. I wrinkled my nose.

"Like I said, it'll take some time to adjust." Theodore climbs out and stands beside me, scanning the area.

People were everywhere. Some moved quickly while others strolled slowly. "Welcome to the city." Isabella mutters, linking her arm with mine.

I could already feel my body trembling. "Get it together." I whisper to myself, hoping no one hears.

Theodore stays a few steps behind as Isabella drags me from store to store. She insists I pick out a few things and tells me I can't return empty-handed.

She was enjoying herself, but I hated every moment. I wanted to return to the safety of the pack. I wanted to escape the noise and the smells. I silently begged to go back to the car.

A hand closes around my wrist as Isabella rummages through a clothing rack. I look up and see Theodore.

He releases me immediately. "I know, personal space, but you're not enjoying this, are you?"

I shake my head.

"Come to the bookstore with me. It's usually quiet there."

I nod, and he tells Isabella, who pouts for a moment but makes Theodore swear not to let me out of his sight.

"I'm not stupid. Isn't that the whole reason I'm here?"

Isabella gives him a location to meet in one hour. "If you're not back..."

"You'll call Alexander." Theodore finishes her sentence. "I wouldn't expect anything less."

Following Theodore out of the store, he leads me through several streets and down a side alley to a small bookshop. Hidden away from the city's hustle.

He quickly moves through the shelves, searching for something as I trail behind, admiring the beautiful book covers. It made me wish I could read. So many stories here, and I could barely pronounce any of the words.
###Chapter 0063

"What sort of book are you searching for?" I ask, hoping he might describe the cover so I could assist.

Silence answers me.

I turn around.

He's gone.

My heart stutters.

"Theodore?"

Still nothing.

I rush between the shelves, calling his name.

No response.

The library feels empty. Abandoned.

"Theodore?" My voice trembles.

Panic sets in. My pulse races. Breath catches.

I turn the final corner.

And freeze.

Victoria stands perfectly still.

A smug smile twists her lips.

Arms crossed beneath her chest. She grins at me.

"The little rat found her voice."

Behind her, a boot lies visible.

Large. Worn. Theodore's boot.

The metallic scent of blood slowly taints the air.

"Did... did you kill him?"

She turns and kicks the motionless form.

No sound.

"The Alpha released you." Her eyes fix on my neck mark.

"I'm not... not alone." I stammer.

"Oh, I know. But they aren't here now, are they? It's just us." She runs fingers through her long blonde hair. "Where is the mighty Alpha Alexander? If you're his contract bride, I'm shocked he let you wander with these fools."

"Where's... where's Dominic?"

"That is Alpha Dominic to you!" She spits. "None of your concern."

"This is neutral ground. They won't tolerate you here." I glance at Theodore's foot. It twitches. "They have rules."

"You think I care? You killed my brother!"

"You killed my parents!" The words burst out, shocking us both.

Victoria's eyes narrow.

Theodore rolls onto his back. Relief floods me. He's alive.

"Why are you here?" I demand, forcing strength into my voice.

"Dominic wants to see you."

"Why?"

She smirks. "He wants to remind you."

Theodore rises silently behind her.

His hands clamp around her throat. "Remind her of what?"

Before she answers, Beta Sebastian charges in.

He grabs me, pulling me behind him.

"Answer!" Theodore demands.

Victoria struggles.

Her manicured nails dig deep into his wrists.

Theodore doesn't flinch.

Blood trickles down his skin.

Dripping onto the floor.

"Release her, Theodore," Sebastian orders.

"She tried to kill me."

Tried. The word echoes. She only ever tries. Others do her dirty work.

Theodore smiles coldly. "Alexander will have a field day when I drag you to our dungeons. What will he remove first? A finger? A toe? Perhaps your tongue."

"As much as you want her dead, Theodore," Sebastian says calmly. "Alexander will handle it. She targeted his mate."

"Bride," Victoria scoffs.

She saw my mark. Does she doubt it?

"Mate," Sebastian corrects. "You've crossed into forbidden territory, Victoria. You didn't just play with fire. You signed your death warrant."

"Dominic will come for you!" Victoria screeches.

I cover my ears.

"I don't doubt it. I look forward to it." Sebastian glances at Theodore. "My van is out back. Take her. Lock her inside."

"Go to hell, you stupid Wolves!" Theodore snarls.

"Go on then. Shift." Sebastian challenges. "I dare you."
###Chapter 0064
Athena

Victoria glares at him. “You don’t want that.”

Marcus looks confused. He was the only one in the room who didn’t know what I was. What Victoria and I both were.

I had no clue what Beta Sebastian was trying to accomplish. She would show everyone my true form. She would reveal the monster I am.

Victoria’s eyes lock on me. It hit me then—she didn’t know. She had no idea that Alpha Alexander’s mark had shattered my binding.

That’s why she hesitated.

Everything Caleb said about keeping it hidden from me started to make sense. They didn’t want me to discover the truth.

“I’ll come willingly,” she mutters.

“Good,” Beta Sebastian and Marcus say at the same time.

“Marcus, I’m taking Athena with me. Clean this mess up. If word gets out, we’ll have even bigger problems.”

He nods, grabbing hold of Victoria. The smell of iron is still heavy in the air, but I can’t locate the source.

“She killed the shop assistant,” Beta Sebastian whispers to me, as if reading my thoughts. “What you smell is a lot of blood.”

Victoria giggles as Beta Sebastian pushes her forward. The van is parked at the end of the alley, away from the busy main street.

She gets in without resistance. Something feels off.

Beta Sebastian slams the doors shut, locking her inside.

“Come on, you can ride up front with me.”

“Something’s… something’s wrong.”

He raises an eyebrow and scans the area. “What do you mean?”

I look up and down the alley, trying to understand the dread coiling in my gut. Beta Sebastian follows my gaze. “There’s no one else here.”

“Are you… sure?” My stomach twists into knots. Victoria didn’t try to hit me—a first for her. “They never leave the pack without each other.”

“What are you talking about? Victoria was alone when she tried to poison us.”

“At the packhouse, yes. But when they left, it was always together.”

Caleb had fallen from a tree. I glance up at the rooftops. Nothing.

The bookshop door swings open. Dominic drags Marcus by his hair along the ground toward us.

“I’ll trade him for my mate,” he growls, his eyes locking on me.

Beta Sebastian’s hand tightens around my wrist, pulling me to his side. “Is he even alive?”

“Barely. But if you take him now, he might recover.”

“Why?” I whisper, staring at the blood trail behind them.

He sneers at my question and turns back to Beta Sebastian. “You have a decision to make. I suggest you make it fast.”

“Get in the van, Athena.” Beta Sebastian doesn’t look at me.

I obey, hearing Dominic mutter about me actually following orders. I want to say something but hesitate before opening the door.

“Van!” Beta Sebastian shouts.

Reluctantly, I climb in and shut the door, wishing I had more courage.

The van rocks slightly. Moments later, Beta Sebastian gets in with a sigh.

“Did you hand her over?” I ask quietly.

“I had to. We don’t abandon our own.”

“And Marcus… is he alive?”

“Yes. Just barely.”

“I’m sorry. This is… my fault.”

“No, you don’t need to apologize. None of us expected Dominic to be here. Alexander thought it would be too public for him, especially in a neutral zone.”

“Why did you come?” I ask as moans echo from the back.

“Why do you think?”

I wasn’t sure whether to feel relieved or irritated. But if he hadn’t shown up when he did, this might have ended differently. I might not be returning to Alpha Alexander.

Beta Sebastian stays silent for the rest of the drive, only confirming that Isabella already knows what happened.

Alpha Alexander is waiting at the packhouse when we arrive. He waits for me to get out, then grabs my face, forcing me to look at him.

“Are you hurt?” he demands.

“No.”

“Don’t lie to me, Athena.”

“She… she didn’t touch me.”

He pulls me against his chest, his arms locking around me. “I should have trusted my instincts not to let you go.”

“You said… it was up to me.”

“It was. I should have known better with both of them still roaming free.”

“I don’t think she knew,” I mumble into his chest.

“What do you mean?”

“Beta Sebastian challenged her to shift. She looked at me. I don’t think she knew your mark broke my binding.”

“She should have scented you. Or maybe she was confused. It’s been a long time since you were first bound. Maybe she mistook your scent for Marcus’s.”

“Make sure Marcus gets medical attention too,” he calls to Beta Sebastian. “Isabella won’t be back for a while, but there will be someone else at the hospital.”
###Chapter 0065

“Come with me.” His voice was low as he released me.

I trailed him into his office.

Something about this room always put me on edge.

It felt like impending doom.

Like everything was about to fall apart.

“Sebastian mentioned you had a strange feeling.”

I nodded. “Right before Dominic showed up. I just... I can’t describe it.”

“You can’t explain it.” He sat behind his desk, leaving me standing.

“No. It just felt wrong.”

“What did she say to you?”

“That Dominic wanted to see me. That...” I frowned, her words still confusing. “He wanted to remind me.”

“Remind you of what?”

“She didn’t get to finish. Theodore interrupted.”

I shook my head. “Beta Sebastian. He was protecting me. Just like Theodore.”

He ignored my mention of Theodore.

“I should have killed Dominic when I had the chance.” He scowled, scribbling on a notepad.

I sank into the chair opposite him.

What was he writing?

“Alpha Alexander, how did they know where I was?”

“A question for Theodore once he’s healed.”

“Theodore?”

“I’m not accusing him. But he saw Victoria first. I need to know what happened right before she attacked him.”

He looked up. “You’re sure you’re not hurt?”

“Just confused.” I mumbled, trying to piece it together.

“I’ll handle it.” He changed the subject. “Did you buy anything nice?”

“A few things. Isabella has them.” I pulled the credit card from my pocket and slid it across the desk.

He picked it up and smiled. “I told you to buy whatever you wanted. You barely spent anything.”

His crimson eyes locked on mine. “The city overwhelmed your senses, didn’t it?”

“The bookstore was the first quiet place. Theodore said it took him almost a year to adjust.”

“It did. Especially his hearing. That’s why he lives on the outskirts. Fewer people. Less noise. Unfortunately, you don’t have that option.”

“Because I can’t protect myself?”

“Because I want you in my bed every night. Not hiding in some remote house.”

Alpha Alexander took me with him when he got word that Theodore was fully healed.

Theodore was sitting on the edge of the same bed I’d thought I was dying in.

His hair was down, loose around his shoulders.

Alexander drummed his fingers quietly on the bed frame.

Theodore’s eyes found me first. He jumped up. “Are you okay?”

I nodded as Alpha Alexander gave my shoulder a reassuring squeeze. “Are you?”

“That bastard came out of nowhere.”

“Which one?” Alpha Alexander asked.

“What do you mean?”

“The blonde, Victoria. She knocked you out first, right?”

“She asked me to reach a book for her. When I stretched up, she hit me from behind with something heavy.”

“Ever met her before?” Alpha Alexander pressed.

“Never.”

“And the other one? When they left, he came from above. Sliced down my spine.” He glanced at me. “Don’t worry. I’m healed. I heal fast.”

“You’ve never spoken to them? Interacted before?”

“Are you asking if I set this up? Alexander, why would I risk my life? You know I’m smarter than that. He nearly missed my heart. I’d be an idiot to cross you. I’ve seen what you do to your enemies. I’d rather be on your side.”

My eyes flicked to Alpha Alexander, but he didn’t notice. I’d only seen him kill Marcus. How dark could he get?

“Right.” Alpha Alexander murmured, turning away.

“Am I free to go?”

“Sure.”

“Are we still having a tutoring session tonight?” Theodore asked me.

“No. Not tonight.” Alpha Alexander answered before I could speak.

He didn’t sound angry. But he didn’t sound happy either. It made me nervous. He was unpredictable.

Theodore left without another word.

Alpha Dane just stood there, expression unreadable.

“Are we going back to the house?” I asked after a long silence.

My question seemed to snap him out of it. He smiled and nodded.

For the rest of the evening, he barely spoke.

But he watched my every move.

It made me nervous.

It was only when I was getting into bed that he finally spoke.

“Were you accidentally linking them?”
###Chapter 0066
Alexander

She glares at me. "Is that... even possible?"

"Right now, everything seems possible."

"Because I'm a monster?"

"Stop calling yourself that."

She rolls onto her back, staring at the ceiling. She sighs and rests her hands on her flat stomach.

"They'll all react that way." She mumbles, puffing her cheeks. "You... you're the only one who doesn't seem..."

"I don't care what you are. All I care about is that you're mine." I pull her against me. "And why are you still wearing clothes to bed?"

My hand slips under her oversized t-shirt and grazes her lower back. She gasps softly.

Unexpectedly, she pushes me away.

"I can't." she whispers, tugging the t-shirt back down over her hips.

She was fighting hard to keep certain thoughts at bay. Trying to maintain a clear mind so I wouldn't discover her inner turmoil.

I pin her to the bed, dropping my weight on top of her. "What's wrong?"

"You're... crushing my... lungs."

I ease my weight slightly but keep her trapped beneath me.

"Are you still tender?"

She closes her eyes.

"Embarrassed?" I drive my leg between hers, forcing her thighs apart.

She shakes her head slightly. "Uncomfortable." she whispers.

I kiss the mark on her neck. I tell her I'll let her be tonight. Only then does she relax. She falls asleep before I do, curled against my side.

'We need to stop Dominic and Victoria.' Titan growls. 'They nearly started a war in the neutral zone.'

'I know.'

'There are others desperate to knock us down.'

'I know.' I mutter, running my fingers through my mate's dark hair.

'You know how angry I've been, Alexander. I wish we had been there. I wish she had never gone. But I can't change what happened. I can only ensure it never happens again.'

I look down at Athena. Her eyelashes flutter against her cheeks as she sleeps peacefully. She seems unaware of the rage building inside me.

'I need to run.' I tell Titan, slipping from Athena's grasp.

'We should speak to Caleb again.' He suggests.

'He didn't know Athena was going into the city.'

'No, but he might understand their current plans. Or at least predict their next move.'

I pull on a pair of shorts and move through the house. I step into the falling snow. The cold beneath my bare feet offers relief from my constant body heat.

I walk through the snow to the dungeon. A guard leans against the door, bored out of his mind.

"Any problems?" I ask.

"No, he keeps to himself." The guard mumbles, stepping aside to let me through.

The guard closes the door behind me as I turn on the lights.

"Really, it's the middle of the night?" Caleb mutters. He apologizes when he sees me. "I'm not great without sleep. What can I do for you Alpha Alexander?"

He stretches his limbs and yawns.

"Athena." I mutter.

"You'll need to give me more than that." He rubs his eyes.

"You keep talking about Athena being an Alpha."

"She is."

"Right. What is she capable of?"

"No one knows for certain. I've researched, but the most I found is that someone in her position possesses great power. They just need to learn how to access it."

"Are you talking magic? Like a Witch?"

"Honestly Alpha Alexander, I don't know. I just know she can restore us to our rightful status in the world."

"And that's why they fear her?"
###Chapter 0067

“I believe their fear isn’t directed at her personally. They fear what she might become.”

“Especially Dominic and Victoria?”

“They’re the only leaders left standing. What do you think?”

“What would Dominic want Athena to remember?”

He stood up, moving close until only the bars separated us. “What are you implying?”

“What does Athena need to be reminded of?”

He raised an eyebrow. “I don’t understand your question, Alpha Alexander. Is she in danger again? You must release me. I need to help her.”

“She is my mate.”

“I’m aware. But she’s surrounded by Wolves. She needs someone of her own kind. Someone who understands what it means to be like us.”

“We’ve discussed this. It’s her decision.”

“She doesn’t know you’re here, does she, Alpha Alexander? All these late-night visits while she remains unaware as you try to unravel her past.”

“Late-night visits? I’ve only been down here a few times since your arrival.”

“Your friend Sebastian visits often. I think he’s having relationship troubles.”

“Why would Sebastian discuss his mate with you?”

“Sometimes an outside perspective helps.” He shrugged.

“Do you talk about Athena?”

“No.”

“What do you discuss?”

“Like I said, his problems. In return for listening, he brings me things.” He gestured toward the cell, now stocked with soda, clothes, and books. I needed to speak with Sebastian. He never mentioned any of this.

Caleb gripped the bars. “I swear to you, Alpha Alexander, I mean her no harm. You have the authority to release me. You don’t need to wait for my sister’s approval.”

I still don’t trust him. Titan growled.

“Why would Dominic and Victoria go into the city?” I ignored both Titan and Caleb’s pleas.

“I’m not following.”

“They’ve always kept to themselves. Hidden from other packs. None of us knew your kind existed. Now they’re venturing into neutral territory. Why would they do that?”

“Probably for the same reason anyone goes there. They’re searching for something. Or someone. Athena encountered them, didn’t she?”

“Sebastian got her out.”

Caleb grinned. “The hero. I knew he was a good man.”

“He’s not interested in men,” I repeated.

“Anyone can be swayed, Alpha Alexander. They just need the right… incentive.” He winked.

“Anyway, for Dominic and that woman to enter the city, there must be a significant reason. Some kind of plan.”

“Could they find her?”

“Not Victoria, but possibly Dominic.”

“Because of their blood connection?”

He nodded. “But they would’ve needed to be nearby already to sense her presence. Same as how I found Silver Creek. I told you I could feel it. The sensation grew stronger as I approached. That’s how I knew I was heading the right way.”

He paced his cell, muttering to himself. Suddenly he stopped, his blue eyes locking onto mine. “Who knew she was going?”

“My sister, her tutor, and a few other females. Obviously, Sebastian and myself.”

“All Wolves, correct? You don’t have any other Lycans hidden here?”

“Besides Athena. Is it possible she could’ve accidentally alerted him? Opened a link between them?”

“Unlikely. The only other explanation is they were already there for another reason and Athena walked right into them. They won’t come here. You have the numbers.”

I studied him, recalling his explanation about Lycan origins. He called it a story, but what if it was true?

“Caleb, can they create more?”
###Chapter 0068
Alexander

‘What’s our next move?’ Titan demands sharply.

I need to speak with my Beta immediately.

This situation is critical. We must regain control now.

My fist pounds against Sebastian’s door.

“Hey, take it easy!” He yanks the door open before even seeing me. “Trying to wake the whole house?” He freezes when he recognizes me. “What’s happened?”

“Caleb!”

“Damn, he told you. Look, I just needed to vent to someone. I know you’ve been dealing with…”

“That’s not why I’m here. Whatever strange dynamic you have with him is your business. I’m not concerned about that. They can make more.”

He rubs sleep from his eyes. “What did you say?”

“They can create more Lycans.”

“Well, that makes sense. Same as us creating more Wolves.”

“Sebastian.” He wasn’t grasping the severity.

“Shit.” He mutters, finally understanding. “Are you certain? This information came from Caleb.”

“He mentioned it was an unspoken rule forbidding them from doing it. Dominic likely enforced it to maintain pack secrecy. A larger pack would have drawn more attention.”

I recount everything Caleb shared, including their inability to track Athena unless nearby.

“Do you believe they were recruiting?” He questions.

‘The city isn’t exclusively Wolves. Many humans work there, completely unaware of our existence. So yes, that’s a distinct possibility.’

“We should have investigated them more thoroughly.”

“How could we have known? They smelled like Wolves. They acted like Wolves. It seemed straightforward. But their proposed contract was never about needing support or Athena. I think they’re seeking a way to dismantle my authority. And it all connects back to the very system I established.”

“They wouldn’t be the first, Alexander. Over the years, many have tried, including your own brides attempting to escape contracts or gather intelligence. If Dominic and his followers start turning humans, we both know we still hold the numerical advantage. Our fighters are the most skilled. Your brother ensured that.”

He frowns. “How is Athena handling this news?”

“She’s unaware. She was sound asleep when I left.”

A noise echoes from upstairs.

We both pause, waiting to see if one of his sons appears.

Several minutes pass in silence.

We decide to continue the conversation outside.

“Is she alright?” Sebastian asks. “She was unusually quiet on the drive back from the city. Different from that first night we brought her here.”

“I believe it’s a form of shock. She seems to genuinely like Theodore. Seeing someone she cares about that close to death has unsettled her.” I couldn’t describe it as panic; that wasn’t the emotion I sensed from her.

“Thank you for getting her out of there.”

He raises an eyebrow. “You never need to thank me. I am your Beta. Protecting your mate is my duty. I will always prioritize her safety.”

“You never showed much interest in protecting the previous brides.”

He shrugs with a slight smirk. “You never claimed them.”

We spend hours in his garden, strategizing.

Eventually, the sun rises.

His boys appear within minutes, loudly complaining of ‘starving stomachs’ and demanding food.

Sebastian looks at me. “She needs to be part of our next move. It won’t succeed without her.”

‘She needs a tremendous amount of confidence.’ Titan mutters internally.

“Then we’ll help her find it.”

‘So much for our run.’ Titan grumbles.

“The pack run is tomorrow night. We’ll have to wait until then.”

Athena is already awake when I return to the packhouse.

She sits in the kitchen, nibbling on a piece of toast.

She has braided her hair away from her face today.

I notice she has removed the ear plugs.

“How are your ears?” I keep my voice soft.

“Trying… trying to get used to it.” She mumbles, grimacing slightly. “You were up early.”

“I didn’t sleep.”

“Oh.”

“Titan wanted more answers from Caleb. After that, I went to see Sebastian.”

She takes another bite of her toast but remains silent.

She often did this.

Keeping her questions to herself.
###Chapter 0069

I discovered something crucial about Lycans last night.

She remains silent, simply watching me while she eats her breakfast.

“It’s believed that Lycans can create more of their kind. By biting humans.”

Her toast slips from her fingers. Blue eyes widen. Her jaw goes slack. “Is that...true?”

“I can’t say for sure. But the possibility is strong. That’s how the first ones were made.”

“Why would...why would Dominic want more?”

“Numbers. Right now, he doesn’t have enough. But if he succeeds,” I pause, watching her closely. I already know how she’ll react. “They’ll need their true Alpha. Not some impostor.”

“I’m not—”

“But you are, Athena. It’s in your blood. Whether you accept it or not. If Dominic creates a new wave, many will despise what he’s done. They’ll hate what they’ve become. They’ll hate being Lycan.”

“Like me,” she whispers, dropping her gaze to the fallen toast.

“Exactly. Imagine their strength if they had a leader who understood that hatred.”

“I’m not... Alpha Alexander, look at me. I’m...the furthest thing from a leader.”

“It’s in your blood.”

“Stop saying that. My father had me bound. He didn’t want this. He raised Dominic as my older brother.”

“Fathers don’t always know what they want.”

I lean back in my chair with a sigh. She watches me carefully.

“I’m a bastard. The son of an Alpha and an Omega. My father grew desperate for an heir. He convinced an Omega to carry me.”

“I thought—”

“Isabella and Julian had a different mother. She took me in. Raised me no differently than her own children. Our fathers make poor choices. But sometimes, those choices put us exactly where we need to be.”

Her blue eyes lift to meet mine.

“Your father set your life on a downward path long before Dominic came along. He rejected you instead of embracing you. Then Victoria entered the picture. Yet you survived, Athena. For twenty-two years, you survived everything thrown at you.”

Her heart is racing wildly.

‘You blew it,’ Titan mutters. ‘Too intense. You scared her.’

She screws her eyes shut and shakes her head. “I’m not...I’m sorry...I have to go.”

I don’t stop her as she flees. Titan was right. I ruined any chance of making her feel powerful.

‘Told you,’ he mumbles, fading into the back of my mind.

Athena keeps her distance most of the day. Every time I catch a glimpse of her, she’s muttering to herself.

Late afternoon, a scream echoes through the house. I race to the kitchen and find her surrounded by broken glass. A deep cut on her hand drips blood onto the floor.

I pull her away and remove the glass shard. The wound heals instantly. It vanishes within seconds, leaving no mark. As if it was never there. Another sign of her Alpha blood.

Her blue eyes flash up to mine. “Sorry,” she whispers.

“It’s fine.” I murmur, turning her hand over in mine. “Before your binding at eighteen, did you always heal this fast?”

She nods. “They hit me,” she frowns. “Over and over. The bruises faded in seconds. Why?”

“I keep saying it, Athena. Healing this quickly...it’s because of Alpha blood.”

She pulls her hand back and shakes her head.

I pick up another piece of glass and slice my own palm. The wound disappears in seconds. “If this were Sebastian, it would take much longer. Theodore’s injury took hours to heal.” I grab her hand again, holding it up between us. “This is who you are.”
###Chapter 0070
Athena

I stared at my hand.
My thumb traced the smooth skin of my palm.
Not a single mark remained.
It had been years since I healed this fast.

Dominic and the pack used to take pleasure in making my bruises last.
They hit harder each time.
Sometimes they broke bones.
Then they’d hit me again as soon as the fractures sealed.

After the final binding, the beatings didn’t stop.
They just changed.
Their satisfaction came from seeing me permanently wounded.

“It’s the Alpha in you,” Alexander murmured. “The bindings were the only reason it ever took so long before.”

I curled my hand into a tight fist.
My own nails bit into my skin.
Tiny beads of blood surfaced.
The moment I released, the small wounds vanished.
Only droplets of red remained, staining my skin.

“This is what Dominic wanted, Athena. To break you. To strip your power. To make you nothing.” He tipped my chin up with one finger. “But you are not nothing. I need you to see that.”

His hands settled on my hips as he held my gaze. “We’re telling the pack today.”

“No.” I shook my head. I wasn’t ready. I didn’t want to see the monster I would become.

“Athena, it’s time. I’ve delayed as long as I can. They need to know.”

“I don’t have a choice, do I?” I whispered, dropping my eyes.

“Not this time.”

Maybe it was better this way.
If they rejected me, better to know now.

“They will want you here.”

I looked back at Alexander.
His crimson eyes watched me steadily.
He didn’t seem worried at all.

I closed my eyes and gave a slow nod.
I still couldn’t believe I was agreeing.

“Good. The meeting starts in thirty minutes.”

“Thirty minutes?” I thought I’d have more time to prepare myself.

“I’ll be right beside you. Sebastian will be on your other side. But there’s something else you need to do.”

“I can’t… I haven’t even shifted yet.”

“I’m not asking you to shift. I’m asking you to decide about Caleb.”

“Oh. Do you… do you think he’s a risk?”

“Titan still doesn’t trust him.”

“What about you?” I asked quietly.

“I’m still undecided. But ultimately, he’s your family.”

I snorted involuntarily. “Technically, so is Dominic.”

“You have a point. Talk to Sebastian. He’s had more conversations with Caleb than I have.”

“What do you mean?”

“It’s a long story.” He picked up the earplugs from the table and handed them to me. “You’ll probably need these.”

I quietly pushed them back into my ears.
My eyes scanned the room for a dustpan to clean up the broken glass.

“Someone will clean it up,” Alexander said, guiding me toward the door. “It’s time to go.”

We walked across the snowy ground.
We passed the training hall.
We moved further south than I had ever been.

We ducked into the trees.
We followed a well-trodden path.
We moved deeper into the forest.
Alexander kept his fingers locked with mine the entire time.

My nerves built with every step.
The knot in my stomach tightened.
We had to stop multiple times so I could vomit.

We were surrounded by pack members.
Some had shifted.
Others remained in human form.
There were so many of them.
More than I had ever seen.
It made everything scarier.
If they attacked, I didn’t stand a chance.
###Chapter 0071

Beta Sebastian appeared suddenly, taking a position on my left side. Alpha Alexander still held my right hand firmly. His fingers remained tightly interlaced with mine. He stood slightly in front of me, shielding me from the crowd.

Alpha Alexander formally introduced me as his mate. He declared to everyone that he had marked me. Cheers and applause erupted throughout the gathering. I knew this celebration would be short-lived. The moment they discovered what I truly was, they would turn against me. They would turn against their Alpha too.

"Relax." Beta Sebastian leaned in close, his voice a low whisper meant only for me. "Their reactions might surprise you."

"As you all know, we've had ongoing issues with the Silver Creek pack." Alpha Alexander's voice boomed across the clearing. I felt grateful he had suggested I keep the earplugs in. "They failed to uphold their side of the treaty. In fact, it was all a deliberate plot to destroy Obsidian Howl."

"Kill them all!" someone shouted from the crowd.

"In due time, yes." Alpha Alexander responded calmly. "Right now, it's crucial for you to learn some information about my mate."

My heart hammered violently against my ribs. Black spots began dancing at the edges of my vision.

'Is it true?'

I recognized Isabella's voice cutting through the mental chatter.

'That Silver Creek isn't like us?'

"Yes, it's true." Alpha Alexander responded, and I noticed the slight curve of his lips. "They are what's known as Lycans. Part wolf, part human. Like the one killed during the attack on our pack. He belonged to Silver Creek."

A collective gasp rippled through the crowd.

"What about our new Luna?" another voice called out. I could feel numerous eyes burning into me.

"She isn't a Luna." Alpha Alexander grinned widely. "She is an Alpha."

Whispers immediately spread through the assembled wolves. They shifted positions, murmuring to each other. After several minutes, Alpha Alexander raised his hand for silence.

"Yes, she is a Lycan. One who was torn from her rightful position within her family. Forced into slavery. Beaten daily until her body barely clung to life. A Lycan who had her abilities bound. Not once, not twice, but four separate times."

Tears welled in my eyes instantly. I desperately wanted him to stop speaking.

Theodore stepped forward from the crowd.

"Four times?" He sounded genuinely shocked. His deep green eyes found mine. I couldn't determine if he felt disappointed that I hadn't confided in him after he'd shared his own past.

"Are you certain, Alpha Alexander?" he asked.

The rest of the pack remained completely silent, awaiting Alpha Alexander's response.

"What do you know, Theodore?"

"Stories." he muttered back, his intense gaze still fixed on me. "There's nothing formally recorded about Lycans. I can't recall specifics immediately, but I have books. Storytellers' accounts based on myths and legends about wolves." He paused briefly. "And other creatures. Particularly those who had been bound."

"Go look now." Beta Sebastian snapped. Theodore quickly disappeared between the dense trees.

Mutterings continued among the pack members. I felt their stares and the unspoken questions hanging heavily in the air.

"Is she a threat?"

"Will she shift and kill us?"

"Will she pass information back to Silver Creek?"

"Will she turn against us?"

The questions seemed endless. Alpha Alexander appeared to be deliberately letting them voice everything before he responded.

"Any more questions?" he finally demanded when the inquiries began spacing further apart.

I shouldn't be standing here. I should be far away, hidden from all these judging eyes.

Complete silence fell as Alpha Alexander waited for someone to speak. No one dared. They remained quiet, waiting. They probably knew better than to challenge him now.

"Do you truly believe I would bring a mate into our pack who would attack us? Others have attempted it. They were all dealt with severely. Athena isn't like the others. If anyone here questions my decision, remember this: I will not be kind. I will not hesitate."
###Chapter 0072

Beta Sebastian winks at me. "He knows exactly what he's doing."

I understood his meaning perfectly. It was a veiled threat. I'd heard plenty of those over the years.

"Everyone meet back here tomorrow at sunset for the pack run!" Alpha Alexander announces.

There are nods and quiet murmurs. They all begin dispersing, fading into the trees.

"We need to go find Theodore." Beta Sebastian mutters, already moving ahead of us.

"Don't do that." I say quietly when it's just me and Alpha Alexander.

"Don't do what?"

"Don't choose me over them. You've worked too hard for this pack. Don't throw it all away because of me."

"You're right. I have worked hard to build this pack. And you, Athena, are part of it now."

He drapes his arm over my shoulders. "Now let's go see what Theodore was talking about."

Alpha Alexander keeps me close as we walk back through the forest. We enter the main pack territory where Genevieve stands waiting with her arms crossed.

"Well, well. What an unpleasant surprise!" She mutters.

"Watch your tone, Genevieve!" Alpha Alexander snarls.

"She doesn't even belong here!" She speaks directly to Alpha Alexander, completely ignoring my presence. Her hands move to her hips. "I don't understand this."

"Then you better figure it out quickly!" He snaps at her and turns me away, guiding me toward Theodore's home.

The door to Theodore's house stands wide open. Beta Sebastian leans against a wall inside while Theodore frantically searches through books, randomly tossing them onto the table.

"Any news?" Alpha Alexander asks.

"Not yet." Beta Sebastian murmurs with a raised eyebrow. He seems to find the whole situation amusing.

Theodore suddenly starts flipping through pages rapidly. He fans books out across the table.

"There's no mention of Lycans." He murmurs, gesturing to the books. "But there are references to a creature matching your description. Half human, half wolf."

"Why do you even have this?" Beta Sebastian asks.

"I was bound, remember? I was trying to figure out how to break the binding. The only information I found about binding involved these creatures."

"Why didn't you say anything?" Alpha Alexander asks.

"Because I'm a Wolf. It never seemed relevant." His deep green eyes focus on me. "I never thought Athena would be anything other than a Wolf." He taps the book pages. "This information is centuries old. All of it is. You couldn't find anything, Alpha Alexander, because they were never called Lycans. They were known as Wolf-human."

"Wolf-human?" I whisper.

"They don't transition into full Wolves. They become something in between." He sighs. "There's very little information about them. It's practically a secret."

"What do we know?" Beta Sebastian questions. "Besides the basics." He glances at me. "Caleb talks quite a bit."

I see Alpha Alexander frown, but as usual, he keeps his thoughts to himself.

"You've been bound multiple times." Theodore continues. "Correct?"

"At least four times that we've pieced together. But what does that matter?" Alpha Alexander asks.

Theodore picks up one book and hands it to Alpha Alexander, already open to the right page. "This here states that the only Wolf-human bound more than once was bound three times."

"Okay."

"The third binding killed them." He looks at me with heavy sorrow in his eyes. "In theory, you should be dead."
###Chapter 0073
Athena

“Dead?” I whisper.

Theodore rubs his chin thoughtfully. “From my understanding, that side of you shouldn’t survive the bindings.” He glances at Alpha Alexander. “We all know bindings are the worst fate for a Wolf. It traps their other half. It’s the most severe punishment—I would know. I’m living proof. But according to these ancient texts, she shouldn’t have lived through it.”

“Well, she’s clearly standing right here,” Beta Sebastian snaps. “And she’s stronger now than the day we brought her home.”

“Maybe the bindings weren’t done correctly?” Theodore suggests with a shrug.

“You really believe the Witches messed it up—four separate times?” Sebastian questions sharply.

“It’s a possibility.”

Alpha Alexander frowns but doesn’t look at me. Maybe he can’t bear to see the panic written all over my face. I want him to say something—to acknowledge what Theodore is implying. Or maybe he’s finally realizing I’m not worthy of being his mate.

“Or maybe marking her saved her,” Sebastian mumbles under his breath.

“Perhaps,” Theodore replies.

I look up at Alpha Alexander. He’s reading the book Theodore handed him, his fingers tracing the words as his eyes move rapidly across the page. Absorbing every detail.

“Alpha Alexander?” I whisper.

He doesn’t respond. Instead, he slams the book shut.

“This isn’t helpful right now.” He shoves it back toward Theodore. “She can’t be the only one. And why didn’t you tell me you had information on Lycans—or whatever they’re called?”

“These books are ancient, Alexander. I thought they were myths—just stories. I never expected to meet a living one. I’ve been here twelve years, and nothing like this has ever crossed our path. How was I supposed to know it would become relevant?”

“You weren’t,” Sebastian cuts in before Alpha Alexander can speak.

“Am I… am I going to die?”

All three of them turn to look at me. Yet no one answers. Tears prick at my eyes, and I force them back.

For years, I believed death would be better than living as a slave. But that was before Alpha Alexander came into my life.

“Preferably not,” Alpha Alexander says, offering a tight-lipped smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. Is he already expecting the worst?

“I need… I need some air.” I turn away from them and hurry outside.

None of them try to stop me. It’s as if all three are already waiting for my impending death.

I lean against the wall, focusing on my racing heart. I will it to slow down, just for a moment.

I hurry across the grounds. People ignore me, and I’m grateful. No one tries to speak to me—not until I reach the back door of the house.

“Finally. Just you and me.”

My eyes lock with strange gray ones.

“I assume you know who I am?” she spits.

“G-Genevieve.”

She laughs mockingly at my stutter. “Do you always do that? You sound like a child.”

I keep my mouth shut. I can’t help the stutter—it happens when I’m nervous. She reminds me so much of Victoria.

“How the hell are you his mate?” She plants her hands on her hips. I decide it’s better not to speak.

“Cat got your tongue?” she taunts. “So tell me, what is a Lycan? The others say you become part Wolf. Is that true?”

“I d-don’t know.”

“You don’t know? What, have you never shifted?”

When I don’t answer, she laughs coldly.

“You won’t last long here. Alexander will see what a mistake you are. He’ll reject you, just like he did with the others. Only I get to survive. Only I deserve to be by his side.”
###Chapter 0074

"You don't know anything about me."

She scoffs. "Why would I want to? Just look at you."

"GENEVIEVE!" Isabella rushes toward us. "Stay the hell away from my brother's mate!"

"Isabella," she sneers, "I was merely introducing myself."

"Weren't you ordered to keep your distance?" Isabella snarls.

"I simply wanted to meet our Alpha's chosen mate."

"You mean you wanted to size her up. Alexander doesn't want you. How many times must you be told?"

Genevieve clenches her jaw and glares at Isabella. "You don't frighten me. You tried that before, remember how that ended? Perhaps Alexander needs reminding how troublesome his little sister can be."

"Ladies?" Beta Sebastian approaches us. "Is there a problem here?"

"No." Isabella snaps. "Genevieve was just leaving!"

"For now." Genevieve smiles sweetly at Beta Sebastian. As she turns, she tells him she's sorry to hear about him and his mate.

"Just go." He dismisses her as I search for Alpha Alexander. He must have felt my panic. Why hadn't he come? Did he send Beta Sebastian instead?

"Genevieve started it." Isabella mutters while glaring at Beta Sebastian.

"I don't doubt that." He shrugs as I scan the area for any sign of Alpha Alexander. "Alexander is with Theodore, doing research."

"Okay." I whisper softly.

"Shall we go inside?"

Isabella grabs my arm before I can answer. She pulls me through the back door, muttering about how Genevieve is a piece of work and that Alpha Alexander should have dealt with her years ago.

"Are you alright?" Beta Sebastian asks as he fills a glass with water and sets it before me.

"That stupid cow needs to learn her place!" Isabella grumbles as she collapses into a chair.

"I agree, but perhaps you should rise above it, Isabella. Alexander has made her position clear. And you know she won't be the last to throw herself at him. Learn to ignore it." He tells Isabella. "You're better than this."

"She was mocking Athena."

"Haven't you noticed she does that when she's jealous? She has to, otherwise she'd sound desperate. As much as I despise her, she's digging her own grave. Let her continue."

"What do you mean?" Isabella asks.

Beta Sebastian's eyes lock on me. "He has made his decision quite clear."

It was supposed to be easier here. Simpler. That's what Alpha Alexander had promised. But everywhere I turned lately, there was another problem.

"Why don't you go," I hear Beta Sebastian tell Isabella. "I can sit with Athena for a while, keep her company."

"Are you sure?"

"The boys are with their grandparents tonight. I have nowhere else to be."

"I can stay if you need me to." Isabella whispers to me.

"I'm okay." I whisper back, offering a small smile.

"If you need me, I'll be at the hospital."

She leaves as Beta Sebastian takes her seat. "You're a terrible liar."

"I know." I mumble quietly.

"Why didn't you tell her you weren't okay?"

"Too many people are already involved in this mess."

"If Alexander had an issue with you being a Lycan, you wouldn't be sitting here talking to me."

"Am I dying?"

"Hopefully not." He winks. "Caleb has mentioned multiple times that there's something different about you. An anomaly."

"You believe him?"

"I believe what I see. When I first met you, I wondered how you were even alive. You were nothing but skin and bones. Your face was gaunt, like someone in their final days. Your arms were like twigs, looking ready to snap at any moment. Even your heartbeat was so slow, barely there, like you were hanging on by the thinnest thread."
###Chapter 0075

He gives me a gentle smile. “But look at you now.”

“I’m still small,” I whisper. Compared to the other women in the pack, I felt tiny.

“What I’m saying, Athena, is that you shouldn’t have survived the journey here. Yet somehow, you did.”

“Because I’m a Lycan?”

“Maybe. Maybe it’s because you were traveling with your true mate. Maybe it’s because you have a stronger will to live than you realize. Maybe you survived because the world still needs you.”

“Caleb got in your head!” I mutter.

“Maybe he just opened my eyes a little.”

“What… what does that mean?”

“It’s no secret there are more than just humans and Wolves in this world. Looking at it that way, we shouldn’t be surprised when something new appears.”

“Me?”

He nods. “We messed up. We entered this agreement blindly. We should’ve done more research. We should’ve questioned Dominic more. Alexander probably would have, if he hadn’t been so drawn to you.”

“You blame me?”

“Not at all. I enjoy a good war, no matter how it starts.”

A war was the last thing I wanted.

“Would you like to speak to Caleb? I can take you to him if you want.”

“Alpha Alexander won’t like that.”

“Then why did he suggest it?”

Beta Sebastian makes me eat a sandwich first. He says he won’t let me pass out from hunger.

Alpha Alexander still hadn’t returned by the time we walked across the snow-covered grass. It made me nervous. After forcing our closeness earlier, he was now keeping his distance.

“You came.” Caleb smiles as I step in front of his cell. “I didn’t think you’d come back after last time.” His blue eyes shift to Beta Sebastian. “Good to see you, too.” He glances toward the steps. “No Alpha Alexander?”

“Not right now,” Beta Sebastian tells him.

I just stare at Caleb. I didn’t know what to say or ask. I didn’t even fully understand why I had agreed to come with Beta Sebastian.

He smiles at me. “I know you’re not just here to stare. You have questions.”

“I was… bound four times.”

“That’s not really a question.”

“Should…” I glance at Beta Sebastian. “Should I be dead?”

I see him swallow. He shifts his gaze to Beta Sebastian and sighs. “In theory, yes.” He sits back on his small bed. “You were last bound when you were eighteen, right?”

I nod.

“Dominic, Victoria, whoever did it probably hoped it would kill you. And yet, you survived.”

“If they wanted her dead, why not just kill her?” Beta Sebastian asks.

“I don’t know. I’ve been trying to figure that out for years. If it were anyone else, they would’ve just killed their problem, right? That’s what Alpha Alexander would do here, right? And other packs, too. So there must have been some benefit to keeping you alive.”

“It can’t be because Athena is an Alpha,” Beta Sebastian murmurs.

Beta Sebastian’s eyes flicker up behind me just as Alpha Alexander’s strong, woody scent washes over me.

“You’re right.” His crimson eyes lock onto mine. “It’s because you are able to carry the next Alpha.”
###Chapter 0076
Athena

"That's absolutely disgusting." Caleb makes a gagging sound. "Our uncle wants to breed her like some animal?"

I feel sick to my stomach. The idea is horrifying. We're family.

"Not necessarily him." Alexander's voice drops low. He moves closer to me. "You mentioned Dominic and Victoria have been together for years."

I nod slowly. "Since I was very young."

"Yet they have no children of their own. Strange, isn't it?"

I never considered that before. I was too focused on surviving each day without getting beaten.

"Athena carries Alpha blood." Sebastian murmurs thoughtfully.

"Our kind is dying out." Caleb adds grimly.

"Exactly." Alexander studies me intently. "It's the only explanation that makes sense. The plan was to have someone impregnate you. Probably multiple times. To produce another Alpha."

"No." I shake my head violently. "Dominic never-"

"He never allowed anyone near you like that, I know." Alexander finishes my sentence, making it sound even worse.

"You think he wanted to raise the children as his own?" Caleb mutters darkly.

Alexander gives a grim nod.

"What about all the bindings?" Caleb asks.

"Theodore is trying to figure that out." Alexander keeps his voice low. "Dominic had to know."

"He bound me because of Marcus." My voice barely comes out as a whisper. "Because I could scent Marcus." My throat tightens.

"That's what confuses me." Sebastian frowns. "He must have believed there was a reason you were breaking through the bindings."

"Maybe he thought the same as us. That her bindings were failing." Alexander suggests.

Caleb lets out a frustrated groan. "Dominic isn't the sharpest tool in the shed. Victoria definitely controls him. This has her fingerprints all over it."

"What do you mean?" Sebastian asks as I try to process their theories.

"I didn't grow up in a pack, but I know how they operate." Caleb's expression darkens. "An Alpha usually has a Luna. The Luna seeks equal power. Normally, she secures her position by providing an heir. Victoria hasn't done that." He runs a hand through his dark hair. "Fucking monsters!"

This is the angriest I've ever seen Caleb. He's usually so calm, especially considering his imprisonment.

"If he turns more people, he'll have a larger pack anyway." Sebastian points out.

"What good is a pack without an heir to continue the bloodline?" Alexander's frown deepens.

"If they had killed you, which they nearly did, the Alpha line would end anyway." Caleb's blue eyes meet mine. "I'm so sorry I didn't get you out sooner."

If the situation weren't so dire, I might have laughed. He sounds like the protective brother Dominic should have been. Maybe it's time to free him.

"The blood tie." Alexander's hands grip my waist firmly. "The blood tie kept you alive. You were weakening. They knew you were fading. Victoria knew they messed up."

Caleb's eyes fill with sorrow. His jaw clenches as he shakes his head. "I should have done more."

"You're right, you should have." Alexander's voice is low and intense. "But we can't change the past. We can only stop what's happening now."

"This...this is too much." I mumble weakly.

"Look at me." Alexander commands.

Hesitantly, I raise my eyes to meet his. His hand cups my cheek gently. His thumb traces my bottom lip. "You are not alone."

"If I'm...if they need an heir. Won't they come for me?"

"I'd love to see them try." Alexander's lips meet mine in a fierce kiss.

"Guys, guys." Caleb groans loudly. "What you do in private is your business. But I don't want to see it."

Alexander winks at me before turning to Caleb. "If you're staying in the packhouse, you better get used to locking your door."
###Chapter 0077

“You’re releasing him.” Beta Sebastian’s voice cut through the tension. I noticed the faint pink flush on his fair skin.

“It’s your decision,” Alpha Alexander murmured to me. “If you choose to, there will be conditions he must follow.”

“Anything!” Caleb beamed, his eyes bright with desperation. “I’ll do absolutely anything. I need to feel the sun on my skin.”

Doubt clawed at me. What if this was a mistake? What if everything he said was a lie? What if the moment he’s free, he leads Dominic straight to us? I’ve never been good with choices.

Stepping into the snow, Alpha Alexander took my hand. Just then, Caleb muttered about how glorious the sunlight felt.

“I am never going back into a cell,” Caleb declared, his hand catching mine. “Thank you. I swear I’ll be the brother you’ve always deserved.” He straightened up and faced Alpha Alexander, clearing his throat to sound more serious.

“Alpha Alexander, don’t mess with my sister.”

I saw the slight twitch at the corner of Alexander’s lips. He wasn’t a man who took orders. He made his own rules.

“Oh come on,” Caleb grinned. “I had to do the brotherly thing.”

“I’ll allow it this once,” Alexander replied coolly. “But remember—although Athena released you, I can easily put you back. And next time, there will be no privileges.”

“Sure, sure,” Caleb puffed out his cheeks and turned. “Someone’s on a mission.”

I followed his gaze and saw Genevieve storming toward us. Could I just have one day without her drama?

“Alexander, I’ve been looking for you,” she said, though her eyes were locked on Caleb.

“Not now, Genevieve.”

“I’ve been talking to some of the others,” she continued, ignoring him.

“Of course you have.”

“They’re worried about her shifting.” She pointed directly at me.

Caleb snorted.

“I’m sorry, I don’t believe we’ve met,” Genevieve said with a fake smile, using her arms to push her chest up. She pretended to trip, bumping into me. Caleb caught her.

“You can call me Caleb.”

As she stood, I thought I saw something glint in her hand. But no one reacted. Maybe I imagined it.

“Are you a guest here?” She twirled her hair like a schoolgirl.

“You could say that.”

She giggled. Could she not see we looked alike? Or was this some twisted revenge because Alexander rejected her? Was she trying to make him jealous?

Her grey eyes flicked to me. A sinister smile touched her lips before she turned back to Caleb.

“How about you and I get something to eat?” She batted her eyelashes.

“I’m sorry, but you can’t give me what I want.”

Her mouth fell open. “You don’t even know me.”

“It’s obvious who you are. The bitter ex, right? You saw a chance to annoy Athena, and it failed.”

“You have no idea what you’re missing!” Genevieve snapped, fists clenched.

“Oh, I do. And it’s not worth it.”

“BASTARD!”

“Genevieve.” Alpha Alexander stepped between them. “You said you spoke to others.”

Her eyes narrowed at me. “We want to know when she’s going to shift. We want to know if you’re putting us all in danger!”

“Who is ‘we’?”

“You mean just you, Genevieve.”

Alexander sighed. He pulled me against him, his arm draped over my shoulders. “Genevieve, you may have saved my life once, but you’re running out of favors.”

“I’m only asking a question!” she spluttered.

His voice dropped to a commanding tone. “You are questioning my authority.”

“No!” She was furious, not getting her way. It made me wonder how much she’d been allowed to get away with all these years.

For a second, I wished she could live the life I had. Maybe then she wouldn’t be such a bitch.
###Chapter 0078
Alexander

Genevieve storms away, her anger and frustration palpable.
She never gets what she wants.
After all this time, I thought she would have learned.
But she remains stubborn, always searching for a way back in.

I hide my amusement at Athena’s dark thoughts.
Once again, her inner darkness surfaces.
Only I can hear it.

“She’s something else,” Caleb mutters.

I agree,’ Titan growls.

“Why not just tell her you’re gay?” I ask, ignoring Titan’s rambling.

“Where’s the fun in that?” Caleb smirks, watching Genevieve stomp across the snow.
“Besides, she’s too dense to understand anything I say.
So what’s the story with her?”

“It’s a long story.
And none of your business,” I tell him.
His eyes flicker toward Athena, but he stays silent.
He knows better than to question my decisions as Alpha.

Inside the house, I have one of the Omegas show Caleb to his room.
I insist he gets one far from mine.

Athena, Sebastian, and I head to the office.
We need a plan.
Dominic and Victoria must be hunted down and eliminated.
I won’t let them find my mate or force someone to impregnate her.

Athena sighs and rubs her eyes.
She sits quietly, regretting her dark thoughts.
Questioning how cruel she can be.

To me, she isn’t cruel.
She wants revenge—a revenge she deserves.
But I wonder if she can actually go through with killing them.

“Take some warriors into the city.
See what you can find,” I tell Sebastian.
I want time alone with Athena.

“Should I take Caleb?
He might sense them.
It could make things easier.”

“Don’t let him out of your sight.”

“No chance.”

As he stands to leave, I order him to kill them on sight.
I notice Athena’s lips curve into a faint smile.
It vanishes when she catches me looking.
She lowers her face, embarrassed.

“We’ve wasted enough time,” I tell her.
“I’m done with their games.
They deserve a swift death.”

“I always thought they wanted me dead, but I never understood why they didn’t just kill me.”
She pulls her knees to her chest.
“I begged for death.
There were nights I prayed to the Moon Goddess not to let me wake up.
I even thought about throwing myself down the stairs.”

“But you kept fighting.”

She lets out a heavy sigh.
“I didn’t want to.”

“If you hadn’t, our paths would never have crossed.
You wouldn’t be here with me, claimed.
Instead, you’d likely be knocked up, raped by one of the men in Silver Creek.”
I’m not trying to scare her.
I want her to see that everything led her to me.

“If they find me…”

I cut her off, locking eyes with her.
“I will burn everything to the ground to find you.
But they’d have to kill me first.
Otherwise, it would kill you anyway.”

Damn right.
Let the whole world burn for all I care!’ Titan declares.
Finally, we agree on something.

She sits quietly, hugging her legs.

“It would be easier if you just spoke to me.
As much as I enjoy reading your mind, you make it difficult when your thoughts jump around.
I’ve told you before.
You don’t have to stay quiet here.
If you have something to say, say it.”

She shakes her head.

“Athena?”

She scowls.
“W…why would they agree to bind me so many times?”
###Chapter 0079

“We said no.”
“No, the… the witches?”
“Madame Zora claimed you were powerful. She said she’d never encountered anything like it. She bound you twice and refused to do it again. That deceitful witch!” My fist slammed against the desk, making Athena flinch.

Athena hugged her knees tighter, her wide blue eyes fixed on me.
“She knew the risks. She wouldn’t bind you a third time. That’s what she meant when she refused.” Rage simmered inside me.
“I thought…” Athena whispered, “I thought she told you everything.”
“She usually does. Sooner or later.”

‘Too many are testing us.’ Titan growled. ‘It’s time we reminded them who leads this pack!’

I glanced over at Athena. Her face was resting on her knees, eyes closed.
Is she asleep? Titan asked.
“Athena?” I had just been speaking to her.

She didn’t stir when I tried to rouse her.
She’s been sleeping too much lately. Titan noted. ‘Have you seen how tired she gets?’
She’s still adjusting. She was exhausted. Her body is recovering.
‘Stop lying to yourself. You’ve asked her daily if she’s feeling alright!’

I pressed the back of my hand to her forehead. Heat radiated from her skin. It was new. I hadn’t felt it when I held her earlier.
“Athena?” She didn’t respond.
“Athena?” I shook her shoulders gently. Her legs slipped down, her head lolled back. Her heartbeat was steady. It made no sense. Why wouldn’t she wake?

ISABELLA! I linked my sister, demanding her immediate presence. She arrived within minutes and rushed to Athena’s side.

After a quick examination, she found nothing wrong.
“Then explain why my mate is burning up?”
“I don’t know.” She frantically rolled up Athena’s sleeves, inspecting her arms.
“What are you looking for?”
“I’m not sure. An injection site, a bite mark, maybe an allergic reaction?”
“She can heal herself.”

Athena coughed in her unconscious state. A trickle of bright red blood appeared at the corner of her mouth.

I forced her mouth open. I smelled the blood before I saw it. Her mouth began filling with it. If I hadn’t leaned her forward, she would have choked.
“Shit, shit, shit. What did she eat?” Isabella muttered as she continued searching Athena’s arms.
“I don’t know. She hasn’t had anything since we entered the office.”

I scanned the room. I looked for anything she might have touched, anything out of place. Nothing seemed unusual.
“I need her at the hospital, Alexander. I can’t handle this here.”

I lifted Athena, keeping her on her side to prevent choking. There were many things we could heal from. Suffocation wasn’t one of them.

By the time we reached the hospital, Athena’s heart was racing. The constant hum made it difficult to distinguish individual beats.
“We need to undress her.” Isabella said urgently. “Something must have happened.”
“He wouldn’t be that foolish.” I muttered, helping remove Athena’s top.
“Who?”
“Caleb. Athena released him. He grabbed her wrist. Then he threatened her.”
“Whoa. That’s a lot to unpack at once.” Isabella murmured as she tugged off Athena’s jeans.
“Where did he grab her?”
“Her wrist.”

Isabella checked her wrists again. There was nothing. No marks. No signs of anything unusual.

Then I saw it. A small raised bump near her shoulder. As I looked at Athena, blood seeped from her ears. I knew instantly what she’d been injected with. This shouldn’t be happening.

Isabella quickly extracted fluid from the bump. Clear liquid mixed with a small amount of blood. “Is that what I think it is?”
“Wolfsbane Toxin.”
###Chapter 0080
Alexander

“Damn it, damn it, damn it!” Isabella panics, desperately rummaging through cabinets, pulling out various small containers, searching frantically.

“Athena, breathe.” I plead. Her agony was palpable. I could feel her fading away from me.

She releases a terrifying gasp. Blood sprays across me as more begins to drip from her nose.

‘I can’t find it! Where is it?” Isabella cries out desperately.

“Isabella,” My voice drops to a whisper. “Isabella, we’re out of options.”

“I know it’s here, where did I put it?” Isabella sobs while tearing through another cabinet.

It had been years since I witnessed Isabella break down like this. The raw fear, the panic, the terrifying unknown. She hadn’t reacted this severely when Gabriel rejected her. In truth, she hadn’t been this distraught since our parents’ tragic deaths.

“Isabella, stop this!”

“No, it’s here somewhere, we still have time!”

Athena’s racing heartbeat had slowed dramatically. It was barely detectable now, her breaths becoming dangerously shallow. She was suffering excruciating pain, blood now seeping from the corners of her eyes.

“FOUND IT!” Isabella spins around and plunges a large syringe directly into Athena’s heart.

Her heart stops completely.

“What the hell did you just do?” I snarl at my sister.

‘It’s the antidote!

“There is no antidote for Wolfsbane Toxin!

“I paid a Witch in the city to help me develop it.” Heavy tears stream down her cheeks. “After you both were nearly poisoned, I had to find a solution. It has to work. It must work!”

I stare at my sister in disbelief. An antidote was unheard of, especially for Wolfsbane Toxin. If such a thing existed, every Wolf pack would keep it stocked.

‘Listen.’ Titan murmurs.

Her heart gradually begins beating again. Faint, but undoubtedly beating. Athena’s lungs start filling properly as she draws in oxygen. She coughs weakly, bringing up less blood than before.

Isabella maintains her distance, too afraid to approach closer. “She needs complete rest now.” She mumbles, avoiding eye contact.

“Why would he do this? He spent all his time educating us about Lycans, begging me to protect his sister. Why would he betray us like this?” I mutter, more to myself than Isabella.

“Where is he now?

“With Sebastian, they’re heading to the city to track Dominic and that treacherous female.

‘I don’t know him well, but hasn’t he been imprisoned for ages? He wouldn’t have access to any of this. Caleb mentioned he grabbed her wrist, but she wasn’t injected there.” Isabella moves to another cabinet, retrieving cleaning wipes. She approaches Athena cautiously, “May I?”

I nod permission and she begins wiping blood from Athena’s face as it finally stops flowing. “That was pure Wolfsbane Toxin, not leaves that had been marinating. That came fresh from the stem, I’m certain you told me it has limited potency this way. It must be used immediately.”

She was absolutely right, I had told her that.

“This doesn’t make sense. Who else has she encountered recently?” Isabella questions.

“Sebastian, Theodore. Damn!

“What?”

“Genevieve, she saw us leaving the dungeons. She deliberately collided with Athena.

“No, surely she wouldn’t go this far. Surely.....Actually, I don’t know why I’m even attempting to defend her.

“Does anyone else know about the antidote?” I ask.

“No, well, only you now.” She gently combs Athena’s hair back, carefully wiping away the blood.

“Keep it that way.”

Isabella glares at me, her eyes widening in realization. “You’re going to let Genevieve believe she succeeded?”

“Well that was her intention, wasn’t it? I might as well let her think her plan worked.”

“I assume you’re....”

“Absolutely. She won’t survive another night.”

Placing my hand against Athena’s forehead, I feel her fever subsiding. I desperately want to stay with her, but this cannot wait.

“Don’t allow anyone inside and absolutely do not speak to anyone.” I instruct Isabella.

Exiting the hospital, I mentally link several pack members as I cross the grounds to where Genevieve had conveniently intercepted us. There was nothing on the ground, nothing concealed in the snow, but she already knew dropping evidence would be a fatal mistake.
###Chapter 0081

I mind-link her to meet me.

She hesitates at first, which is unusual for her. But she appears moments later. She seems pleased by the blood stains on my shirt.

“You wanted to see me?”

“I’ve been thinking about what you said.”

“Oh?” She flutters her eyelashes. “Have you realized she isn’t the one for you?”

“I’ve thought about many things since you returned.”

Her fingers immediately go to her hair, twisting a strand as she focuses on me. “I knew it, Alexander. I knew she wouldn’t be enough. I knew you only pitied her.”

“But that’s the problem, isn’t it? I’m mated to her. I can’t do anything with you while bound to her. I can’t kiss you. I can’t taste your skin. I can’t claim you. And I definitely can’t fuck you.”

Her brow furrows slightly. “Isn’t she dead?”

“How would you know that, Genevieve?”

“LOL.”

“So it’s acceptable for you to stutter, but not for Athena?” I had heard Athena’s thoughts during their encounter.

Her eyes widen as she tries to retreat.

“Not this time.” I seize her shoulders, holding her firmly. “I warned you. Desperation doesn’t suit you. I told you to stay away from Athena.”

“You owe me!”

“No. Not anymore.”

I lift her off the ground. She kicks and screams, struggling against my grip. “Alexander, please. I did this for us.”

“There is no us. If you had stayed away, I wouldn’t be taking you to fight for your life.”

“Please, no. We protect our own—she isn’t one of us!” she shrieks.

“Like you said, Genevieve. You needed a pack. We didn’t need you.”

I drop her at the forest’s edge. Many of my people have already shifted into wolves. They wait eagerly.

“No, please, Alexander.”

“You made Athena suffer. It’s only fair you suffer too.”

Tears stream down her face. “I’m sorry. I won’t do it again. I’ll leave. Please!”

“Run!”

I step back, removing my shirt. I watch her turn slowly toward the forest. “You have thirty seconds.”

“I’m sorry.”

The others growl at her. They dig their paws into the soil, crouching low, ready to attack.

She backs into the forest.

She runs as fast as she can. I hear her gasping as she moves. She doesn’t shift. She stays on two feet. She likely knows there’s no hope of escape.

I shift into my wolf. I pace before the others. They were chosen for this hunt because they’ll be on duty during the pack run, guarding Athena.

I give the signal.

They charge ahead of me, quickly picking up Genevieve’s scent. Their powerful legs cover the uneven ground. They turn swiftly when her scent changes direction.

I can still hear her. I already know she won’t get far.

I’m quickly linked—she’s surrounded.

I hear her begging them as I approach.

Piece by piece. Titan growls.

Genevieve’s face is stained with tears. Mud clings to her blonde hair, suggesting she fell. Her eyes dart between us as she pleads for her life. It changes nothing. Her fate is sealed.

I give the wolves the signal.

They lunge at her like she’s prey. Her screams fill the forest as they tear flesh from bone. Her cries soon fall silent. Her heart stops. Her eyes remain wide open as they continue tearing her apart.

I hope in her final moments, she felt the pain she inflicted on Athena.
###Chapter 0082
Alexander

I remain at her bedside.

Every slight movement of her muscles holds my complete focus.

I silently urge Athena to awaken.

She was not dead.

I would have sensed her soul departing.

The antidote had functioned, to some degree.

But what lasting harm had the Wolfsbane Toxin inflicted?

We would have no answers until she woke.

Sebastian still hadn't linked me.

My patience was thinning.

It was unlike him to remain silent for so long.

Each attempt to mindlink him was met with a blunt, wordless severance.

“You need to rest.” Isabella murmurs from the doorway. “The pack run is at dawn.”

“I am not leaving her.”

“I can stay with her.”

“My answer remains unchanged.”

She enters, handing me a clean, folded shirt. “Change your top. You’re still covered in her blood.”

I look down at the stained fabric.

Athena would not wish to see this upon waking.

“You haven’t spoken of Genevieve.” Isabella says quietly.

“She is dead. That is all you need to know.”

“You hunted her.”

“Did you believe I would grant her a peaceful end?”

She gives me a final, lingering look before retreating from the room.

I despise this.’ Titan growls.

The feeling is mutual.’

We have controlled everything for so long.

Yet crucial things keep slipping past us, Alexander. Vital things.’

Are you claiming you foresaw this?’ I snap at my Wolf.

No. Of course not.’

Then we should have. Her past was filled with darkness. I should have known she would find a way to harm Athena. Especially after I ended her hopes.

Wolfsbane Toxin?’ He mutters. ‘That was unforeseeable.’

Isabella did! She recognized the potential threat.

Titan falls silent.

He knows I am drowning in self-blame.

That will not change soon.

I change into the black shirt.

Athena’s fingers twitch.

I immediately grasp her hand.

I speak to her, hoping my voice can guide her back.

Isabella is replaced by Theodore.

He knocks lightly, his expression grim as he observes Athena.

“Did you find it?” I ask, not looking away from her.

“Yes. And there was an abundance of it.”

“Explain.”

“She possessed an entire room of them. Forty or fifty individual plants. She was prepared. Not just the plants. She had protective gear. Waders. A thick jacket. Gloves. A beekeeper's hat. She knew precisely what she was doing. She was planning something significant. She had enough to cause severe damage to the entire pack.”

“And?”

“We incinerated the room. Nothing remains. Not even Genevieve's bones.” He moves closer to Athena, sighing heavily.

“What is it?”

“Athena has accumulated more enemies than you, Alexander. For someone unaware of her own history, how has she provoked so many?”

“Her enemies are mine.” I state flatly.

Theodore takes the only vacant chair. “I assume her brother remains unaware.”

“He and Sebastian have not returned.”

“I am certain they are fine. Perhaps they discovered a lead and are pursuing it.”

“You sound confident.”

“I must choose hope.” Theodore offers a faint smile.

“Hope?”

“Consider it. She is a miracle. Who else has survived this many bindings? And now, poisoned by a substance lethal to our kind.” He frowns at my mate. “Any progress?”

“None. Her heart rhythm is steady. Isabella says her vitals are normal.”

“Perhaps her mind requires time to process the trauma. The shock may have triggered a shutdown.”

“Her mind is chaos.” I sigh. “Nothing is clear. I cannot discern if she is reliving memories or trapped in nightmares. I only know she is lost.”

“Then speak to her. Use your voice to anchor her.”

“You believe in that?”

“I have witnessed stranger occurrences. If you are uncomfortable, I can read to her.” He produces a small book from inside his jacket.
###Chapter 0083

“Go on,” I whisper softly. “It might help.”

Theodore reads to her. I watch for any reaction, any sign she hears him. There’s only the slightest twitch of her fingers now and then. But it seems to calm her. Her mind feels less chaotic.

Footsteps pound down the hallway, rushing toward us. Theodore and I shift quickly to the foot of Athena’s bed, shielding her just as Caleb bursts through the door.

“Is she alright? Tell me she’s okay!”

I step aside so he can see her.

“Who did this? Was it that blonde witch?”

“Yes,” Theodore answers when I can’t form the words. Caleb’s reaction is fierce, much like how I would defend my own sister.

“Alexander will end her!”

“You’re late. Alexander already had her executed,” Theodore informs him.

Caleb moves past me to Athena’s side, taking her hand gently. “Why won’t she wake up?”

“We don’t know,” Theodore murmurs, his eyes flicking to me. “She received the antidote. All her vitals are stable. I believe after years of trauma, her mind has shut down temporarily to heal.”

“Where’s Sebastian?” I ask quietly.

“He went to check on his men. Today… changed his perspective.”

I narrow my eyes. “Why didn’t he answer my link?”

“We ran into some trouble.”

“In the city?”

“Seems you were right. He’s creating more Lycans. They were waiting for us.”

As the light shifts, I notice dried blood smudged on his skin that wasn’t properly cleaned.

None of my contacts reported any issues.

“Where in the city?”

“Sebastian called it Riverside. Down by the river. We were ambushed. We took down as many as we could. No trace of Dominic or Victoria.”

“You couldn’t sense them?” Theodore asks.

“Yes and no.”

“What does that mean?”

“It means Dominic is the one turning them, binding them to himself. He knows what he’s doing. He’s making it hard for me to pinpoint him in a crowded area. I never thought the fool was clever. Makes me think this is Victoria’s plan too.”

He leans close to Athena.

“Wake up. You’re safe now. You’re protected. You are loved.”

Still, nothing. If not for her steady heartbeat, she’d seem gone.

When Theodore leaves, Caleb takes the empty seat across from me. He holds her left hand while I hold her right.

Unlike the others, he doesn’t tell me to leave or rest. He sits in silence, which is unusual for him. He’s playing the devoted brother well, but Titan still doesn’t trust him.

Hours after sunrise, Isabella returns, checking all of Athena’s vitals again. “I don’t understand,” she murmurs.

“What’s wrong?” Caleb demands.

“That’s just it. Nothing’s wrong. She should be awake.”

“Are you sure you didn’t miss anything?”

She frowns at him and turns a monitor around, pointing at the readings. “Heartbeat is strong. Oxygen levels are excellent. Blood pressure is perfect.”

Isabella leans over Athena, shining a small light into her eyes. “Pupils are reactive.”

“Isabella?”

“There’s nothing more I can do, Alexander. She just needs time.”

“That’s not what I was going to ask. Who was the Witch you saw?”

“For the antidote? My usual source. Madame Zora.”

“Madame Zora?”

“Yes. She was very helpful,” Isabella smiles. “Told me it wouldn’t be easy to make, but it was possible.”

“Madame Zora is the one who bound Athena originally. Why would she help?”

“I never said it was for Athena. I asked if it was possible. I told her it was for the pack’s safety, and she agreed.”

“She agreed?”

“Yes. Just like that.”
###Chapter 0084
Athena

Their voices cut through the heavy fog in my mind.
Isabella and Alpha Alexander were arguing.
They were fighting about the Witch who bound me.

Isabella defended Madame Zora.
She wasn't defending the past actions.
She was defending what the Witch did now.

“She knew exactly who I was, Alexander!” Isabella snapped. “She knows you're my brother. She didn't need a degree to figure out why I asked for the antidote.”

“Guys, guys.” Caleb tried to intervene.

“I still can't believe you went to her.” Alpha Alexander's voice was sharp.

“If I hadn't, Athena would be dead!” Isabella shot back.

Death.
Maybe that was my purpose.
Maybe I was created for death.

“Will you both shut up!" Caleb snapped. “Take this outside. She doesn't need to hear your arguing.”

‘I'm sorry, Alexander. I did what was best for this pack. I did it to protect us. Why can't you understand?’ Isabella's voice softened. “I did this for Obsidian Howl.”

“How much did it cost?”

“It was nothing.”

“She always has a price. Tell me how much.”

“I'll pay you back.”

“Isabella!”

I didn't hear her response.
I was glad I didn't.
The collective gasps told me it was more than anyone should pay.

“I have the antidote now. She gave me a list of ingredients and instructions to make it myself.”

Silence fell.
I felt myself slipping back into the fog.
It wrapped around me like a blanket.

“She moved!” Caleb's voice pulled me from the darkness.

“She's been twitching since yesterday.” Alpha Alexander muttered.

“No, she actually moved. Her hand opened and closed.”

Alpha Alexander grabbed my hand.
Little spikes of electricity shot up my arm.
My heart jolted.

“Did you see that?” Isabella asked. “There was a spike in her heart rate.”

“Athena? Athena?" Alpha Alexander called my name.

Had he felt it too?

I tried to speak.
No sound came out.

“Take your time. I'm right here.” Alpha Alexander murmured.
He squeezed my hand.
Sparks flew again.

My eyes crept open.
The bright hospital lights forced them shut.

“Turn the lights off.” Alpha Alexander ordered.

My eyes opened again.
The room was dimly lit now.
I didn't recoil.

“Hey,” Alpha Alexander cradled my head. “How are you feeling?”

A raspy sound escaped my throat as I looked at him.

“It's okay, take your time.” Isabella said softly.

“You scared the crap out of all of us.” Caleb mumbled.

I didn't turn to look at him.
I kept my focus on Alpha Alexander.
His strange crimson eyes were a relief to see.
For a moment, I thought it had all been a dream.

Who?
I wanted to ask.
Who did this?
My last memory was Alpha Alexander sending Sebastian and Caleb into the city.

“Genevieve.” Alpha Alexander muttered, reading my thoughts. “She injected you with Wolfsbane Toxin. Isabella had an antidote.”

I knew that bitch would try to kill me.

Alpha Dane smiled.
I forgot how easily he could read my mind.

“She's dead. You don't need to worry about her anymore.” He confirmed.

“Good thing too. Otherwise I would've killed her myself.” Caleb muttered.

Now there was just Dominic and Victoria to deal with.

Alpha Alexander stayed silent.
I knew he was listening to my thoughts.
What wasn't he telling me?

“Can we have a minute alone?” Alpha Alexander asked the others.

They left, though clearly unhappy about it.

He shut the door behind them.
He rolled down the blind.
This was serious.

“Sebastian and Caleb went into the city.” He told me. “Just as we predicted, Dominic is creating more Lycans. He might be doing it to attack us, but it will also piss off other Wolf packs.”

My voice sounded like scraping metal when I asked why.

He frowned. “Talk to me through your thoughts.”

I nodded.

He continued explaining how packs would feel threatened by Dominic's ability to turn humans.

‘It's like Vampires turning many humans at once. They do it to invade an area and then kill the ones they turned.’

‘Vampires?’

“Sorry,” he mumbled, “There are many other species in the world. Though you'll never see them here.”

‘I don't know what a Vampire is.’
###Chapter 0085

His gaze narrows sharply.

I shrug, my shoulders throbbing with a dull ache.

“Blood feeders. That’s the only term you need to remember.”

His clipped tone tells me everything. I’m certain I never want to encounter them.

Alpha Alexander adjusts himself on the edge of the bed. He presses a button. The bed whirs to life, tilting upward until I’m sitting, forced to meet his intense stare.

His expression is grave. Lips pressed thin. A faint crease forms between his brows.

“You must inform me the moment something feels off.”

“I… thought it was just exhaustion. My mind was foggy. It still is.”

He leans in abruptly, planting his fists on the mattress on either side of my hips. His face is dangerously close. His scent wraps around me, wild and intoxicating.

“I cannot lose you.” The words are a low, rough murmur. “I will not.”

His crimson eyes lock onto mine. My thighs squeeze together instinctively under his gaze. He has a way of making obedience feel inevitable.

I nod slowly.

He cups my face and kisses me. His tongue brushes mine, quick and possessive, before he pulls back.

“You need rest.”

He sounds frustrated. Annoyed. My eyes drop to the prominent bulge straining against his pants. I wonder how much restraint it’s costing him.

“If you were here for any other reason,” he whispers, voice thick, “I would take you right now. In this bed.”

He moves away, dropping into the chair beside the bed. His eyes never leave me. He doesn’t speak, but his gaze promises one thing: once I’m cleared, I won’t be leaving our room.

Hours pass before Isabella finally finishes. She runs endless tests. Asks my full name. The date. Where I am. Then come the physical challenges. With each question and task, Alpha Alexander’s impatience grows.

“Isabella, surely you have enough,” he snaps. He hasn’t left except for a brief moment.

“I’m being thorough. I won’t have you blaming me later for missing something.”

He waves a hand irritably, signaling for her to continue.

I comply with everything she asks. Still, she insists on complete rest once we return to the packhouse.

“I’m fine,” I whisper.

“I’m taking no risks.” She turns to her brother, crossing her arms. “No physical exertion for the next few days.”

His crimson eyes find mine. A slow, knowing smile curves his lips. He’s already planning how to bypass her orders. The thought sends a thrill of fear—and anticipation—through me. Our last time together flashes in my mind.

We walk back to the house slowly. Like the first time I left the pack hospital, I refuse to be carried. I need to move. To feel my own strength.

Caleb shadows us closely. They both act as if I might collapse or be drugged again at any second.

Alpha Alexander glances at me. He’s still listening to my thoughts.

“Take your time,” he murmurs. “I’m not going anywhere. I know you’re in pain.”

Dominic and the others would never have cared. They’d have forced me to work through the agony, ensuring I suffered more.

“And I will make them suffer, too,” he adds.

“You’ll have to beat me to it,” Caleb mutters from behind me. “Even that Genevieve. I’d have made her suffer far more than just being fed to the wolves.”

I freeze. Fed to the wolves? Real wolves? Or the pack?

“Don’t think about it,” Alpha Alexander says quietly, shooting a dark look at Caleb.

“Sorry. I’ll shut up.” Caleb sucks in his cheeks, avoiding my eyes.

I should have expected her fate to be brutal. I knew Alpha Alexander had a ruthless side. I should have realized his punishments are never simple. Marcus’s death was likely the cleanest kill he’s ever carried out. It makes me wonder about the other women. How they died.

Alpha Alexander says nothing. I decide not to ask. He hears my thoughts anyway. The look he gives me confirms it. They died the same way.
###Chapter 0086
Alexander

Caleb leaves us at my office door. Athena lowers herself into a chair with such painful slowness it makes me ache. She lied to Isabella about feeling fine. She knows I can read her thoughts, though I say nothing. I understood her need to return here. This house makes her feel safer somehow.

“Do you need anything?” I ask as she pulls her knees to her chest.

She shakes her head, dark hair falling around her face.

She hasn’t mentioned the hunt again. She hasn’t asked if the others died the same way. She doesn’t need to. She’s already figured it out. Yet she still doesn’t question my decisions. Her mind is somewhere else entirely.

“Athena, I know you’re not okay.”

She picks at a loose thread on her black jeans. “I’m alive.”

‘Is she having a breakdown?’ Titan asks.

“Yes, you are,” I mutter, ignoring my wolf.

“I shouldn’t be. I should be dead.” She grips her stomach, face contorting in pain.

“What’s wrong?”

“It’s just... uncomfortable.”

“Let me see.”

She lowers her legs and lifts her shirt. “There’s nothing there,” she whispers, tensing again. Her hand grabs my arm. Nails dig into my skin, leaving half-moon marks.

I catch the scent of blood. “Athena, is it your period?”

Her nails sink deeper. “I’ve never had one,” she gasps.

It hits me then. She hasn’t had a period since arriving here. Her body had been too shut down. Too frail. Basic functions weren’t working. Now everything is resetting itself. Returning to how it should be.

“Is it...” She squeezes my arm. “Is it always this bad?”

“Come on. I can help with the pain.”

I don’t let her walk. Lifting her from the chair, I turn her quickly so she doesn’t see the blood staining her jeans.

I stand her in the shower and turn on the water. It soaks us both as I strip off her clothes. Her nails dig into me with each new cramp.

“Take your time,” I murmur, lips grazing hers.

Stepping out, I run a bath. Hot water helps ease cramps. If it doesn’t, my fingers will. A good orgasm usually does the trick.

I hear her weeping as I turn off the water. Her hand presses against the glass door. Blood trickles from between her legs.

I move her from the shower to the bath. Her skin sizzles as it hits the water. She gasps.

“Move forward,” I say, pulling off my wet clothes.

“It’s blood.”

“You think blood scares me?”

She stares at me, then slides forward. Making room for me behind her.

She sits between my thighs, her back against my chest.

My hand rests on her stomach, pressing down, massaging. She’s so thin I can feel the cramps beneath her skin. Coming in waves. One after another.

Her hands grip my thighs. Nails pierce my skin as her body tenses. She whimpers. I slide my hand down to cup her mound.

She grabs my arm with both hands. “What are you doing?”

“Easing the pain.”

She doesn’t let go. “But...”

My finger dips between her folds, moving back and forth. “It doesn’t have to be bad,” I whisper in her ear. “Pain can become pleasure.”

Her hands stay on my arm, preventing me from going further. She considers my words.

“Do you trust me?” I ask, flicking my tongue over her neck mark.

She doesn’t answer. But her hands retreat into the water, resting on my thighs. She parts her legs a little more.

I push two fingers deep inside her, curving them to press against her clit. Her body tenses again. But not from pain.

She pushes her hips up, thrusting against my hand as I stroke her swollen clit.

“Slow,” I tell her. “It will help more.”

Her back arches against my chest. Soft moans escape her lips as I take my time. Sometimes it’s not about my needs. It’s about watching her. Knowing only I can satisfy her.

She throws her head back as I push a third finger in. She’s tight, but responsive. Her thighs clamp around my hand.

My name rolls off her tongue as she rocks her hips. Water splashes over the tub as she spasms around my fingers. Her juices and blood trickle over my hand.

She stills. Breathing heavy. Heartbeat wild.

“Better?”

“Uh huh,” she mutters, voice strange.

A pink blush spreads from her chest up her neck.

I smile, listening to her thoughts. “If you want me to fuck you, just ask.”

We rinse off in the shower. I press her against the cool tiles, lips crushing hers. She parts her lips, letting my tongue taste her.

My hard cock presses against her leg. Her fingers wrap around it, moving in a steady rhythm. Paying attention to the tip.

“You,” I mutter between kisses, “are supposed to be resting.”

“Uh huh,” she says, pushing her breasts against me.

We end up on the shower floor. Athena straddles my legs. My cock presses against her pussy.

Her blue eyes lock on mine as she adjusts herself. She slides down my dick, mouth wide as she takes my full length. She lets out a little growl as she adjusts to me. A sound I’ve never heard from her before.

I guide her hips, encouraging her to move up and down. Slow and steady. Letting her have control.

She was beautiful. And she was mine.
###Chapter 0087
Athena

He dedicated hours to ensuring my comfort.
Snacks were arranged.
Drinks were chilled.
Blankets were fluffed.
Sometimes, he simply lay beside me.
His presence was a constant, soothing balm.
His fingers traced light patterns on my skin.
It was both calming and intensely intimate.

The cramps vanished completely after my climax.
I still couldn't comprehend what had come over me.
Taking control in the shower was so unlike me.
In that moment, it felt like another force guided my actions.
Something primal and powerful had taken hold.

“Athena?” His murmur pulled me from the edge of sleep.
“I must leave. The pack run begins soon.”
“Okay,” I yawned, reluctantly releasing my hold on him.
“Guards will remain stationed around the house. Caleb has also agreed to stay.”
I nodded, pulling a pillow tightly to my chest.
The pack run was a sacred event here.
I would never ask him to miss it.

“Are you certain you’ll be alright?” His lips brushed my cheek softly.
“I’ll probably just sleep.”
“I’ll inform Caleb.”
A faint frown touched his features, but he said nothing more.
He promised to return by morning.

Midnight found me completely alert.
The full moon glowed brightly outside.
Yet a deep, unsettling dread coiled within me.
A heavy, sinking sensation I couldn't explain.
I just knew, with absolute certainty, that something was wrong.

A frantic knock shattered the silence.
“Athena! Turn your lights off! Now! Let me in!” Caleb’s hissed whisper came through the door.
“What’s happening?” I muttered, opening the door to find a completely naked Caleb.
I instantly covered my eyes.
The image of my brother like this was not something I ever wanted seared into my memory.

He slammed the door shut and killed the lights, plunging us into darkness.
His hand found mine in the blackness. “You can see me, right?” he whispered urgently.
I nodded, still adjusting to my new ability to see so clearly at night.
“Why are you naked?” I whispered back, matching his tense tone.

“They’re here, Athena. They’ve used the full moon to make their move. I had to shift to mask my scent. They know I’m here. They probably know you’re here too. They’ve come for you.”
My stomach plummeted, a new depth of fear opening inside me.
“You need to shift.”
“I… can’t. I don’t know how.” My eyes darted around the dark room, tears welling. “The guards…”

He shook his head grimly. “Gone.”

We both froze at the sound of movement outside.
Caleb’s eyes scanned the room desperately, searching for cover.
There was none. The room was too exposed.

I watched, transfixed, as his body began to change.
His limbs elongated.
His frame expanded.
Dark, coarse hair sprouted across his thickening skin.
His head morphed into that of a massive wolf.
I instinctively tried to recoil, but he seized me.
He pulled me tightly against him, his enormous form enveloping mine.
A potent mix of male pheromones, sweat, and a wild, musky scent filled the air.

‘I’m masking your scent.’ His voice echoed in my mind, just like Alexander’s did.
He rubbed his long, furred arms all over me, coating me in his strong, animal odor.
It seemed a desperate, flimsy disguise.

Footsteps moved past the bedroom door without stopping.
Caleb held me firmly, refusing to release his grip.
For a terrifying second, I feared this was a trap.

‘Come with me.’ His command came through the link after several tense minutes.
His arms finally released me.
He moved silently to the window, sliding it open without a sound.
His blue eyes flashed at me in the dark.
He held out a large, clawed hand.

From the window, I could see scattered bodies on the ground below.
Some in wolf form, some human.
No Lycans were among them.

“W…where are we going?”
“Up.”

I was confused. There was nothing above us but the roof.
“Alexander instructed me. If there was ever trouble and he wasn’t here, I was to take you up.”
What choice did I have?
Stay and be captured, or trust his word.

Caleb crouched low, gesturing for me to climb onto his back.
I wrapped my arms around his thick, muscular neck.
I sent a silent prayer to the Moon Goddess that I could hold on.
I was either heading into greater danger, or Caleb was truly keeping his promise.

He scaled the side of the house with astonishing speed, pausing only when we reached the flat roof.
He scanned the area carefully.
He did a quick circuit, checking all sides.
The roof was empty, save for a single, small duffle bag.
###Chapter 0088

He shifted back into human form.
His voice was quiet as he asked if I was alright.
He pulled clothes from the bag.

“Why are we up here?”
“Like I told you. Alpha Alexander ordered me to bring you here if your safety was ever at risk.”

Why hadn’t Alpha Alexander mentioned this place to me?
“When did he tell you that?”

“Hmm?” He wasn’t looking at me.
His attention remained fixed on the grounds below.
I hadn’t heard anything except those footsteps outside my door.
I hadn’t seen any other Lycans.
A sickening dread began churning deep inside my stomach.

“When…when exactly did he tell you?”
“Yesterday. While you were still in the hospital.”

I didn’t know whether he was lying.
Everything about this felt wrong.
Being up here felt wrong.
Where was Alpha Alexander?
He should be sensing my panic by now.
I desperately wished I could link him.

“Are you hungry?” Caleb asked.
I slowly lowered myself to the floor.
“No.”

“You sure? You barely left your room all afternoon.”
He had been watching me.

“I’m fine,” I murmured.
My eyes drifted toward the forest.
I hoped someone would return soon.
Alpha Alexander. Theodore. Beta Sebastian. Anyone.

“Suit yourself,” he muttered.
I could feel his gaze heavy on me.
He was waiting for me to make a move.
If I didn’t fight, maybe I could buy some time.
Maybe he would eventually leave me alone.

“You gave me a real scare,” he said, biting into an apple.
“That bitch drugging you…that wasn’t part of the plan.”

“Plan?” I pulled my knees tight against my chest.
I kept my eyes lowered.

“Alpha Dominic’s plans were almost ruined.”
He took another loud bite of the apple.

Alpha Dominic.
He had been working for him this whole time.

“Are you…are you even my brother?”
“No. I just bear a strong resemblance to your family. Alpha Dominic made sure of it. He knew it was the only way you’d trust me.”

“I could sense you.”
“Of course you could, you stupid girl. You have Alpha blood running through your veins. Honestly, Athena, I expected more from you.”

“You…you linked me.”
“And you still haven’t figured it out.” He tossed the apple core off the roof.
He pointed at me. “Alpha blood.” As if that explained everything.

“It was all a game!” Rage boiled inside me.
It was hotter and fiercer than anything I had ever felt.
“Just a fucking game!”

He took a step back, laughing.
“Is that all you think this is? That’s all you think I’m worth? I believed you. I…” I shook my head, too furious to form words.

“So did everyone else. Sebastian. Theodore. But you…you were the easiest to fool. Did you really think I’d hide in a forest all day? Watch Alpha Dominic’s house for years? No. My job was far more important.”

I had been so incredibly stupid.
“You’re just going to hand me over to him?”

“Kicking and screaming if I have to.” He shrugged.
“You’re a fucking asshole!” I pushed myself up onto my feet.
“I should have let Alpha Alexander tear you apart.”

“But you didn’t. Because you felt sorry for your poor little brother.” He mocked my voice.

A sharp pain shot through my skull as I stared at him.
White-hot fury ignited within me.
My entire life, I had been nothing but a pawn.
A punching bag for whenever they needed to vent.

“You don’t get to do this!” I snapped.
“And what are you going to do to stop me? Alpha Dominic will be here the second I call him.”

I refused to be pulled back into that life.
I wouldn’t let it happen.
My eyes scanned the rooftop.
There was nothing here I could use to defend myself. Nothing.

Another wave of agony ripped through my head.
It nearly brought me to my knees.
I fought with everything I had to stay standing.
I would not show him any weakness.

“There’s nothing you can do, Athena,” he mused.
“Your life has already been decided. And you are completely alone.”

I’m here.
A female voice echoed inside my mind.
Excruciating pain shot through my entire body.

My body launched itself at Caleb.
Large claws erupted from my fingertips.
They plunged straight into his chest.

When I pulled my hand back, fragments of his heart were clinging to my claws.

He choked, staring at me in shock.
The claws retracted.
Pieces of his heart remained in my palm.

Push him.
The voice whispered inside my head.
Push him over.
###Chapter 0089
Athena

His gaze was locked on my hand.
A strange, hollow gurgling sound escaped his lips.
Blood seeped down the front of his shirt, spreading in a dark, wet stain.

He looked down slowly.
It was as if time itself had paused to let him comprehend the event.
His hands trembled violently as they touched his chest.
He choked out a broken croak.
His entire body swayed unsteadily.

Without a single conscious thought, I shoved him off the roof.
I remained completely still.
The sound of his body hitting the ground echoed up—a sickening, final crack.

I sat down heavily.
Pulling my knees tight to my chest, I let the cold night air whip through my hair.
I had just ended a life.

Turning my hand over, I examined it.
It had partially shifted.
Dried specks of blood still clung to the skin.
I ran my thumb over my fingertips.
I felt nothing.
No pain.
No sharp edges hiding beneath the surface.
The claws had vanished as quickly as they appeared.

‘Sorry about the mess, but that bastard had it coming.’ The voice rumbled in my mind, utterly unconcerned.

The rooftop was empty except for me.
It definitely wasn't Alpha Alexander speaking.

‘You are correct. I am nothing like a man.’ I could hear the clear amusement in her tone.

“Who...who are you?”

‘I am Nyx. Your Lycan. It appears we found each other at a most opportune moment.’

“We don't... You are not supposed to be inside my head.”

‘It is amusing what a bit of Alpha blood and some powerful bindings can achieve.’

Annoyance flared in me. If I had a Lycan, why had she remained hidden for so long? ‘Where have you been all this time?’

‘I have always been right here. But those monsters had me completely suppressed.’

It was a bizarre sensation, feeling her presence moving through my consciousness. ‘My cycle?’ I whispered the question.

‘Precisely!’

Stunned into silence, I kept my arms wrapped tightly around my legs.
Was this what Alpha Alexander and the others experienced when their wolves communicated with them?

‘You will grow accustomed to me, Athena. My purpose is to ensure our survival.’

I let out a derisive snort.
I had managed just fine on my own until now.
Mostly.

‘From this moment forward, that changes.’ She added firmly.

By the time the sun began to rise, my entire body was shaking uncontrollably.
I only wore the thin tee and joggers I had slept in.
My feet were bare.
Even though my body could generate significant heat, it wasn't enough to fight the bitter cold of the night.
I refused to let her come forward to help us climb down.
I was still too terrified of becoming a monster.
I would rather freeze.

“Athena? Athena, are you alright?” Alpha Alexander's voice rushed through my mind urgently.

Looking over the roof's edge, I could still see Caleb's broken body among the others he had murdered.
There were no other people.
The grounds were silent.
What about the children?
What about those too old or too young for the pack run?
Where were they?
How many had Caleb actually killed?

“I'm on the roof.” I mumbled the reply through our link.

“Why couldn't he sense my fear? My panic?” I asked the empty air aloud.

‘I blocked him. It was necessary for you to stand on your own. As attractive as he is, he cannot shield us constantly.’

“You blocked him?” I shouted, my annoyance flaring again.

She offered no answer.
She fell completely silent.

Alpha Alexander and the others emerged from the forest line.
They halted abruptly at the sight of the dead bodies surrounding the packhouse.
Very slowly, Alpha Alexander's eyes scanned the rooftop, searching for me.
The moment his gaze found me, he simply stared.
He believed I had killed them all.

‘I'm coming up.’ He muttered through our link.

He scaled the side of the house with expert ease, as if he'd done it countless times.
His feet and fingers found ledges and holds without hesitation.
As he climbed over the top, his eyes remained fixed on me.

“It...it wasn't me! Well, only Caleb.” I whispered, my voice weak.

“Did you shift?”

“No. A little... She talks so much. What happened to the children? Where are the others?”
###Chapter 0090

His gaze sharpens on me. “Sebastian is verifying. Who exactly are you referring to?”

“Nyx.” The name slips out in a whisper. “Inside my mind. A Lycan.” It was difficult to form coherent sentences. Her voice in my head, dictating my words, clashed with my own frantic thoughts. Everything was turning into a jumbled mess.

His hands grip my shoulders firmly. His eyes dart down to my bare feet, and a low groan escapes him. “How long have you been up here?”

“Since midnight.” I murmur softly. I had checked the time just moments before Caleb forced his way into my room.

I cling to Alpha Alexander desperately as he lowers us both back through his bedroom window. Inside, he immediately wraps a thick blanket around my trembling form and secures the window shut.

“Explain what occurred. Leave nothing out.” He settles into the large armchair, his crimson eyes fixed intently on me.

My words come out fragmented and hesitant. I struggle to relay the entire sequence of events. He remains silent, simply nodding, allowing me to pour everything out.

“And then… claws emerged.” I mutter, the memory vivid and unsettling. “I… I tore pieces of his heart out.” A wave of nausea hits me as I recall the sensation of tissue clinging to the tips of those claws. It still felt like a horrific dream.

“You achieved a partial shift?” He questions when I fall silent.

I close my eyes and give a slow nod. The disbelief was clear in his tone. He thought I was fabricating this.

“And you claim a Lycan is communicating with you? Similar to how Titan speaks with me?”

I nod again. It contradicted everything I understood about myself. Dominic never mentioned a Lycan spirit. Caleb insisted it was impossible. Yet, Nyx’s whispers were undeniably real.

“Is she speaking to you at this moment?”

I exhale slowly and bob my head in affirmation.

“What is she saying?”

“That you doubt my account. But… you can read my thoughts, Alpha Alexander. You must know I’m telling the truth.”

“Correct?”

“It’s not merely disbelief, though. You find it impossible that I could eliminate someone like Caleb. Even with your ability to verify my thoughts.”

His crimson eyes scrutinize me deeply. “Partial shifting is not a documented phenomenon. Then again, nothing seems predictable anymore.”

I had hoped to avoid this, but he gave me no alternative.

‘Do it?’ I whisper internally to Nyx. ‘Exactly like before.’

I feel her exasperation, an odd sensation rolling through my mind. I withdraw my hand from the blanket’s warmth and extend it. A sharp, searing pain instantly shoots through my entire body. My hand begins its transformation, enlarging, as thick, dark claws slowly protrude from my fingertips.

The shift itself wasn’t painful; the moment preceding it was the strange part.

“Describe the sensation.”

I turn my clawed hand over, examining it. Patches of dark fur spread up my wrist but dissipated upon meeting my human skin.

“I’m uncertain.” I murmur quietly. I had always dreaded the idea of shifting. Loathed the concept of becoming something else entirely. Resented this secret kept from me since childhood. Yet, this partial shift… it saved me.

‘See,’ Nyx comments dryly. ‘It’s not entirely terrible.’

“Uncertain?” Alpha Alexander repeats.

I shake my head, and my claws retract as my hand returns to its normal size.

“I’m sorry about your warriors.” I whisper, still staring at my now-human hand. “I trusted him. When he claimed Dominic was attacking, I believed him.”

“You had no reason for suspicion. You fear Dominic. If someone warns you of his approach, believing them is logical. I would expect no different.”

I frown, feeling foolish.

“He deceived us all. We fell for his lies.”

“The blame is also mine. I should have recognized the risk of taking too many on a pack run was a strategic error. I placed my trust in the wrong individual. That error in judgment will not be repeated.”
###Chapter 0091
Alexander

The bastard had slaughtered eight of my men.
Each one had a family.
Some were older, with children waiting at home.
Some were young, fresh from training, eager to prove their worth as warriors.
It should have been a simple mission: protect my mate.

None of us saw it coming.
That’s the danger of shifting under a full moon.
We are at our peak strength, yet consumed by the hunt.
Everything else fades—everything but the prey.

I watch her now.
She turns her hand over slowly.
Her wide blue eyes trace the faint marks, puzzling over where the claws emerged and vanished.
I feel a surge of frustration.
Yes, she defended herself.
That’s what I wanted from the start.
But this nagging feeling won’t leave me.

And she… she doesn’t seem disturbed.

Isabella confirmed the men had been dead for hours.
Athena’s blue-tinged toes showed she’d been out in the cold too long.
Maybe she’s made peace with it.
Maybe Nyx guided her through it.
But her calm is unusual for a first kill.

'The bodies are handled,' Theodore links me. 'Sebastian checked on all the children and elders. No one was harmed. Only the guards at the house were targeted.’

'My office. Both of you. Ten minutes,’ I command.

Athena rubs her feet with the blanket, seeking warmth.

“What triggered Nyx’s emergence?” I ask.

“My period,” she answers instantly, without a hint of hesitation. “She said it was necessary. She should have appeared when I turned thirteen, but my body was too weak. I never fully matured.”

She pushes tangled hair from her face.
I grab her brush from the cabinet and hand it to her.
She works through the knots, smoothing her dark hair.

She sighs, dropping the brush beside her.
She adjusts the blanket, wrapping it tightly around herself.

“I know you’re angry, Alpha Alexander.”

“Not at you.”

“I know,” she murmurs.
She opens her mouth to speak again, but hesitates and closes it.

'She’s talking to Nyx,’ Titan murmurs. 'Look at her eyes.’

'I noticed,’ I reply.
But as I focus, I see something new—a dark ring circling the blue of her irises.

“Athena?”

Her eyes snap up to mine.
The ring vanishes.

“Come with me.”

“Where? Am I in trouble?”

“Just to the office. I’d leave you here, but I don’t want you alone right now.”

She follows me through the house, blanket clutched tightly.
She settles into her usual chair, pulling her knees to her chest, hiding beneath the fabric.

Theodore and Sebastian enter, mid-argument.

“We all fell for it,” Theodore snaps. “And from what I heard, you were meeting him nightly.”

They stop when they see Athena.
Sebastian crosses his arms.
Theodore studies her curiously.

“Enough,” I growl. “He fooled us all. Maintained this charade for months.”

“Then why help me kill Lycans if it was a setup?” Sebastian scowls.

“To maintain his cover. He had to make us believe he was loyal—that he was on Athena’s side. Otherwise, he would’ve been caught sooner.”

“He said he was calling Dominic,” Athena whispers. “That he needed to tell them I was ready for collection. The devoted brother… it was all lies.”

Her voice is flat, devoid of emotion.

“He deserved it,” she murmurs, not meeting our eyes.
That subtle darkness surfaces again.

“You killed him?” Theodore asks, surprised.

“I did. I tore pieces of his heart out. Then I pushed him over the edge,” she states, unapologetic.

“You?” Sebastian is stunned.
I understand why.
She seems small. Fragile.
You wouldn’t expect it from her.
But they don’t see the darkness simmering beneath the surface like I do.

“I don’t get it,” Theodore mutters. “He looked just like you. Same dark hair. Same blue eyes. Even your smiles were similar.”

That last comment strikes me as odd.
Is he interested in my mate?

“It was all a setup!” I snap, drawing their attention back. “And we fell for something this obvious.”
Like Athena said, I’m not angry with her.
I’m furious with myself.
I’ve seen every trick.
Heard every scheme.
Yet I still fell for it.

'You should’ve trusted my instincts,’ Titan grumbles.

He’s right.
I should have.
I messed up.
I lost good men tonight.
But she is still here.
She is still alive.

My fist slams onto the desk.
The men jump.
But Athena just watches me.
It’s the longest she’s held eye contact with anyone.

“I’m recalling Julian.”

Both men raise their eyebrows.
Neither speaks.
Athena’s gaze remains fixed on me.

“I know what you’re thinking. I exiled him. But you both know he’s a master strategist. He would’ve seen this coming. This is his expertise. And we need it.”

I have ultimate control.
My pack trusts me.
But we all have our strengths.
And right now, we need his.

I look at Athena. “He won’t come near you.”
I meant to be reassuring.
It came out as an order.
She nods.

“Nyx said she’ll kill him if he tries anything,” she says flatly.
Both men stare at her, eyebrows raised.

“Who the hell is Nyx?” Sebastian demands.

“Nyx,” I mutter, “is Athena’s Lycan.”

“No. Caleb said that wasn’t possible,” he sputters.

“Caleb also fed us a lot of lies. All that crap about Athena not remembering him—it makes sense now. There was nothing to remember. He didn’t exist!” I shout.
Whatever issue Sebastian had with that guy, he needs to let it go.
Caleb screwed us.
That’s the end of it.
###Chapter 0092
Athena

Alexander’s fingers were laced tightly with mine as we stood outside the house.
Four days had passed since the attack.
He hadn’t let me out of his sight since.
All training and lessons were canceled.
He refused to discuss it.

I knew he was silently questioning my every move.
The rest of the pack bore the full force of his rage.
It had been years since they lost a member to anything but old age or Alpha Alexander himself.
The entire pack was on edge.

Meetings were constant.
New security measures were being implemented.
No one except Julian would be granted entry to the territory.
Not for now.

“Are you okay?” Alexander asked without turning.
“Mhm.” I kept my eyes on the grounds.
The snow had finally stopped.
Spring was approaching.

He asked me that multiple times a day.
As if he expected me to shatter at any moment.

Alexander glanced at me from the corner of his eye.
A look I was growing accustomed to.
It wasn’t just him.
Everyone I encountered these days gave me the same look.

It wasn’t blame.
I knew that look well from my time at Silver Creek.
This was different.
I couldn’t decipher it.
Nyx didn’t help, challenging anyone whose gaze she disliked.

She would surge forward, seizing control for just a second.
I hadn’t figured out how to stop her.
She wouldn’t tell me either.
Like it was some great secret.

A luxury car approached.
Not the one Alexander had sent Julian away in.
I looked up at him.
His frown deepened.
He didn’t want his brother back.
But the events of four days ago left him no choice.

Julian stepped out, slinging a bag over his shoulder.
His dark hair had grown out since I last saw him.
It nearly reached his shoulders now.

He stopped less than a meter away, dropping his bag.
His dark eyes fixed on me.
“Well, you’ve caused quite the problem, haven’t you.”

He didn’t know everything.

Alexander suddenly slid his hand into my hair.
He pulled it back, exposing my neck.
Revealing the mark he had given me.
A silent warning.

“Interesting.” Julian grinned at me.
“Big brother has finally settled down.”
His dark eyes remained locked on mine.

‘Fucking douche!’ Nyx muttered.

“Office.” Alexander said to his brother.
“We have much to discuss.”
The ice in his voice sent a shiver down my spine.
Not the good kind.

I sat quietly in the corner of the office.
Alexander revealed my ancestry to Julian.
He didn’t mention I was supposed to be an Alpha.

Julian’s response surprised us both.
“So they do exist?”

“You’ve heard of them? Why didn’t you tell me?” Alexander demanded.

“Heard a comment in the city, ages ago. Thought I had too much to drink at the time.”

“When?” Alexander pressed.

“A year, maybe eighteen months. Wrote it off as drunken nonsense.”

Alexander’s crimson eyes flashed to me.
I knew exactly what he was thinking.
The same thing I was.
They had been recruiting much longer than we thought.
Perhaps Caleb was one of the early recruits.
Perhaps he had been changed long ago.
Long enough to learn everything about me.

“They are surprisingly skilled. Compared to the first one, anyway.” Alexander scratched the stubble on his chin.
“One took out eight of my men.”

Julian turned to look at me.
“Eight?”

“It was a trap... He... he was going to hand me over to Dominic.” I mumbled.

“I see you haven’t lost your stutter yet.” He winked.
“Some things never change.”

“Focus on something else.” Alexander growled.
“I didn’t bring you back to hit on my mate. This is your chance to prove yourself, Julian.”

Julian turned away from me.
“You mean if I help, you’ll let me come home.”

“That’s the deal.”

“Going to write me a contract too?” His sarcasm was thick.
Nyx called him a douche again.

“That can be arranged. But I’d prefer you do something for your family for once instead of just yourself!”

“I said I’d help.” He muttered.
“But I get the feeling you’re not telling me everything. I can’t work with half the information.”

Alexander looked at me.
Julian followed his gaze.

“They want me... they want to put a pup in me.” I muttered in disgust.
The thought still made me feel gross.

Julian’s eyes narrowed.
“But you’re marked. It would kill you if they tried.”

“They don’t know that. At least, we believe they don’t. I’m not sure what they know.”
“There’s still a lot of missing information. It depends if the traitor shared any of what we learned.” Alexander murmured.
###Chapter 0093

"Fine. Show them the mark then." He says it like it's that simple.

I thought it would be, too.

But Alpha Alexander explained it isn't.

If they find a way to kill him first, I would be free.

Just like when he killed Marcus.

Alpha Alexander tells him exactly that.

"For argument's sake, let's say they do manage to kill you." He mutters to Alpha Alexander. "Why are they so obsessed with getting a pup in her? There are other females in the pack."

"She doesn't just carry Alpha blood. She is an Alpha."

Julian's dark eyes find me again.

They linger longer this time.

I shift in my seat.

My gaze drops.

Prick! Nyx snarls inside my head.

"I'll help." He mutters finally. "Like you said, Alexander. This is my home, too."

He sweeps out of the office.

He's muttering about taking his old room back.

"You didn't tell him." I whisper.

"About Nyx? No. I thought it would be more interesting to see how you handle him. Now that you have another spirit sharing your mind."

"You want Nyx to surprise him?"

He smiles.

It's the first real smile I've seen in days. "It might remind him to stay in his own lane."

"Someone will tell him. It's not a secret."

"Perhaps. Or maybe they'll assume he already knows. What did she think of him?"

"She called him a prick."

Alpha Alexander laughs. "Finally. A female who sees right through him."

He leans back in his chair.

He folds his arms across his chest. "I know I haven't been easy to live with these past few days. But something like this... it doesn't happen to my pack."

"I know. And I'm so—"

He holds up a hand, stopping me.

"You have to stop apologizing, Athena. I know you're sorry. But you can't feel guilt for something out of your control. I was the one who put you in that situation. I left you with only a few guards. And the man who claimed to be your brother. Stop blaming yourself."

I don't think I can.

Years of conditioned guilt don't just wash away.

Someone could stub their toe.

I'd probably find a way to blame myself.

I look up at the ceiling.

I try to blink back the tears.

I expect Nyx to comment on my weakness.

But she is silent, too.

She told me she sees everything.

Every little memory I have.

She hates that she wasn't there to protect me.

She claims she would have slit their throats while they slept.

Sometimes, I'm almost jealous I didn't have the courage to do it myself.

"Hey." Alpha Alexander is suddenly in front of me.

He moved around his desk without a sound.

"I won't stop until he is dead. I won't stop until all of them are dead."

He cups my chin.

His thumb runs along my bottom lip, freeing it from my teeth.

"Let me handle this."

I nod.

His hand moves from my chin to my throat.

He crushes his lips against mine.

He suddenly pauses.

His forehead rests against mine.

His eyes close.

A low growl rumbles in his chest.

"What... what's wrong?"

"I'm being summoned. We'll finish this later."

He takes my hand.

He leads me from the office and out of the house.

We head straight for the forest.

Not to someone's house like I expected.

"Where are we going?" I ask quietly.

He glances at me with his crimson eyes.

He doesn't speak.

Dread fills my body.

Nyx is growing restless, too.

"Where are you taking me?!" I snap.

Instant regret follows.

Nyx pushing forward will get me into serious trouble.

A curious glint shines in his eyes, one I rarely see. "I just want you with me. A Lycan has been found in my forest. Theodore called me to check it out. Don't worry. He's dead." He pauses, studying me. "I told you, I don't want you out of my sight. But it is nice to see you showing your spine."

We move deeper into the thick trees.

Voices reach us.

Theodore's voice, snapping at someone.

A half-shifted man is sprawled on the forest floor.

A man I recognize.

A man who came to beat me regularly.

A man who liked to use the metal of his belt for his own twisted drama.

I never knew his name.

But I never forgot his face.

"He wandered in," Theodore mutters. "Claimed he was human. Said he was lost. As you can see, he was killed mid-shift."

I can't look away from him.

Someone tore out his throat.

All I can think is that I wish it had been me.
###Chapter 0094

Alexander.

Athena couldn't look away from the dead Lycan. A faint smile touched her lips. Each day, her darkness seemed to bleed through a little more.

"Did you know him?" I asked.

"He was one of them." Her gaze lingered on the belt buckle around his waist. His pants had begun to tear during the shift. But he'd been killed before completing it. The buckle remained intact. She stared at it with recognition.

"He used to hit me with that." Her voice was low, her focus entirely on the corpse. I wondered if she'd looked at Caleb the same way when she ended him.

"Do you know his name?"

She shook her head. Her eyes barely flickered toward me. I saw how dark they'd become. The blue was almost gone. Nyx was right there, straining at the edges. "Just his face," Athena murmured.

"Any others?" I asked Theodore.

"No. He appears to have come alone." Theodore muttered. "A reckless move."

"Unless it was deliberate. Maybe Dominic thought one could slip through." Caleb had been alone when we found him.

"He just wandered in?" Athena whispered. She knew the guards were posted. But concern still tightened her features.

Theodore pointed toward the trees marking the pack's boundary. Less than two meters from where we stood. "He didn't get far, Athena. That's our territory line."

Her shoulders relaxed slightly at his words.

It made me question if we were being watched. Of all the forest, this spot was closest to the house. And something Athena had said about Caleb. That he would call for Dominic, meaning he must be nearby. I tried to keep my worries hidden, but she was starting to notice.

"Dispose of the body," I ordered. "I don't care how. Just make it disappear."

The two men with Theodore dragged the Lycan toward the boundary line. I turned Athena away, guiding her back toward the house.

"It feels satisfying, doesn't it?" I murmured.

"What do you mean?" She asked, carefully stepping over a fallen log. Her balance was improving.

"Seeing someone who hurt you... dead."

She didn't answer, pretending to focus on the uneven ground.

"You judge me when I kill. But I see the pleasure on your face. You try to hide it. But the curve of your lips gives you away."

She remained silent. I didn't need to read her mind to sense her embarrassment. The pink flush on her cheeks betrayed her. It made me want to take her right there in the open forest.

"They creep in," she muttered, staring at her feet. "I don't... I don't always think like that."

"I know. We all have a part that craves revenge for the past."

"I'm not..." She tried to deny it.

"I saw the look when we first met. The glance at Marcus. The flash of rage on your face. Like I said, you hide it well. But now, your Lycan makes it harder to conceal. How deep does the darkness go, Athena?" I pulled her hips against mine. I wanted her.

She stared at me, her eyes completely pure blue. Her lips parted slightly.

"Or have you just needed someone to tell you it's okay?" I brushed the back of my fingers down her cheek.

Her lavender scent mixed quickly with her arousal. A soft gasp escaped her as I ran a finger along her waistband. Her eyes darted around the forest. This was too exposed for her. The risk of being seen or heard was intimidating.

I leaned close to her ear, my voice dropping to a husky whisper. "I want you more than I've ever wanted anything. I want you here. Now."

The air caught in her throat. She gasped as I pushed my hand down the front of her jeans. Just as I expected, she was already wet and dripping for me.
###Chapter 0095

“Stay silent if you don’t want to get caught,” I challenge her. She’s used to making all the noise she wants. This will test her control.

I slide a finger into her wet heat. Her eyes stay locked on mine, fighting the urge to cry out. She grabs me, pulling my face to hers. She kisses me hard, gasping into my mouth.

“You’ll have to try harder than that.” My voice is low as I push her back against a tree.

Her struggle to stay quiet only makes it more intense. Soaked and throbbing, she grinds down on my hand. She squeezes her eyes shut like it will help.

She’s desperate to come, but I want to draw this out. I want to watch her shatter again and again.

Her lips form a silent ‘o’ as her muscles tighten. A choked gasp escapes as she rides my hand. When her body stills, she opens her eyes. She thinks she’s won.

“We’re only getting started.” I spin her around, her back pressed to my chest.

My fingers find her swollen clit again. This time I give her what she craves. My tongue traces her neck, flicking over her mark. She moans when my teeth scrape it. Sometimes it’s as sensitive as her clit, and she can’t get enough.

“Quiet,” I whisper. “You’ll draw attention.”

I pull her top up, freeing her breasts. Her hard nipples beg for my touch. I skim my fingers over them. Her back arches, pressing into my palm.

Just as she’s about to break, I pull my fingers away. She gasps in shock.

“You made a mess.” I hold my hand up, her juices glistening on my skin.

To my surprise, her tongue darts out. She licks my fingers clean, tasting herself. I was already hard, but her boldness pushes me over the edge. I need to be inside her, and she knows it. This is her way of teasing me.

“You’re playing with fire.”

She says nothing, pressing her ass against my cock.

“This is what you want, isn’t it?” Her voice is barely a whisper. “You tease me until I can’t take it. You make me wait, make me suffer. You know I’m desperate. Then you fuck me right here to prove your point.”

“And what point is that?” I kiss along her jaw, sending electric sparks through her. She shivers, fighting the sensation.

“To show you’re in control.”

“Then bend over and let me fuck you.”

She leans forward, bracing against the tree. I lower her jeans and wet panties. She’s still slick and ready for me. She rises on her toes as I enter her.

I’m thicker than usual, fueled by her defiance and this game we’re playing.

A muffled sound escapes her as I slide deep. I grip her hair, pulling her head back to watch her face.

I’ll make her come, then finish in her mouth.

She fights to stay quiet, but eventually she breaks. She growls my name as she climaxes.

“Turn around.” I stroke my own cock. “On your knees.”

She knows what I want. She takes me into her mouth, her tongue swirling around me. Her sultry eyes lock on mine with the same heat as before.

It doesn’t take long. I release down her throat. She sits back, licking the last drops from my tip.

I pull her to her feet and crush my lips to hers. My hands tangle in her hair. We are perfectly matched. We fit together in every way.
###Chapter 0096
Athena.

Three more days passed.
Each day brought new Lycans.
Sometimes one appeared.
Sometimes two.
They never came from the same direction.
But their goal remained identical.
Break through the boundaries.
None succeeded.
They managed a meter.
Maybe two.
Then they were torn apart.
Some approached in human form.
Others had already shifted.
I didn’t recognize the ones who stayed human.
When their bodies were searched, bite marks confirmed it.
They weren’t pure Lycans.

Alpha Alexander grew more agitated.
He paced constantly.
He muttered to himself.
Or rather, to Titan.
Trying to plan the next move.
When he wasn’t talking to Titan, he snapped at everyone.
It worried me.
These Wolves were nearing burnout.
Julian worked them relentlessly.
They got only a few hours of rest.
If they collapsed, we were doomed.

I had to stay by Alpha Alexander’s side.
He never said it aloud.
But I knew.
He would blame himself if I were captured.

“He’s doing it again.” Nyx murmured.

I looked up from the children’s book.
I was attempting to read it.
Alpha Alexander circled his desk.
He strode around it, scowling deeply.
His feet almost wore through the plush gray carpet.

“It doesn’t make any sense.”

I wasn’t sure if he spoke to me or Titan.
I dropped my gaze back to the book.
Sounding out the letters silently in my head.
This wasn’t my area of expertise.
Even if I wanted to contribute, I had little to say.

From the corner of my eye, I watched him.
He snatched the odd paperweight from his desk.
He hurled it at the wall.
I flinched and cowered.
Memories surged forward.
This wasn’t the first time he’d thrown something.
Guilt swelled inside me.
These Lycans were here because of me.

“Sorry.” He muttered. “I didn’t mean to scare you.”

“Has there been another?” I asked softly.
His expression told me the answer.

He nodded.
His crimson eyes avoided mine.

“Julian believes they’re searching for a weak spot.” He said. “A less guarded area. But my pack is exhausted. We have too much territory to cover.”

“They need rest.” I murmured absently.

“I’m well aware.” He scowled.
I hadn’t meant to irritate him.
I quickly changed the subject.

“Why send only one or two at a time?”

“Losing one or two is easier than losing thirty.” He explained. “They lose one, they can always make another.”

I hoped Nyx would have input.
But she just watched him.
She did that often.

“All because of me.” I whispered.
All because my uncle had a twisted plan.
He wanted me to carry a child for him and Victoria.
Disgust twisted my stomach.
I stared down at the book in my lap.
“Why now?”

“What do you mean?”

“Why create more Lycans now? Why not years ago when numbers were dropping? Caleb always said we were a dying breed. They could have made more sooner.”

“They probably never expected to be in this situation.”

“You mean, they never thought they’d lose me.”

He nodded.
“If our roles were reversed, I’d do the same.”

‘He’s right.’ Nyx murmured. ‘It’s a strategic move.’

‘Strategic for Dominic.’ I shot back.
It was one of the few truths Caleb had told.
None of this was Dominic’s doing.
It was all Victoria.
I couldn’t wait to end her.

Alpha Alexander and I hadn’t discussed it.
Not since we had sex in the forest.
It felt like a forbidden topic.
Speaking of the joy I felt seeing that dead Lycan.
That Lycan wasn’t the first.
Each time, Alpha Alexander took me to them.
Asking me to try and identify them.
Each time, I stared at the lifeless body.
The torn-out throat.
A smile touched my lips.
He was right.
I had a dark side.
Or maybe years of trauma were finally boiling over.

I looked up.
Alpha Alexander was prying the paperweight from the wall.
His shoulders were tense.
His crimson eyes darker.
He placed the paperweight back on the desk.
I knew it was only a matter of time before it was embedded in the wall again.
###Chapter 0097

The office door slammed open without warning.

Julian stormed inside, his expression grim.

He ignored me completely, bracing his hands on Alexander's desk.

The two men locked eyes, communicating through their mind link.

I felt a chill run down my spine. This couldn't be good.

Alexander's gaze flickered toward me for a split second.

It was so brief I almost missed it.

"What's happening?" I whispered, dread coiling in my stomach.

Julian turned to face me, his features tight with tension. "The Lycan we just captured asked for you."

"Me?"

'Stay calm!' Nyx commanded. 'Ask why.'

"Why would they want to see me?"

"That's what we need to find out. And it's not a he."

My breath caught. "A woman? Was she bitten?"

He gave a sharp nod. "We think you should talk to her."

"She's alive?" Shock rippled through me. They'd killed all the others without hesitation.

Alexander moved around his desk. "Athena, she's just a child. There are lines I won't cross."

"A child?"

"Fifteen years old." Julian sighed heavily. "She claims a blonde woman dropped her off. Told her to walk through the forest and not look back. Then ask for someone named Athena."

"Victoria?"

"No name given, but likely. She's terrified and exhausted. Keeps begging to go home to her parents."

'She's a kid, Athena. We can't ignore this.' Nyx murmured softly.

"Where is she?" Tears welled in my eyes inexplicably. This stranger's suffering felt personal.

"With Sebastian." Julian informed us.

"Are you certain you want to do this?" Alexander studied me carefully.

I nodded, biting my lower lip.

Julian led us across the pack grounds toward Beta Sebastian's residence.

"He took her to his home?"

"Easier to contain and monitor her there." Julian explained.

Sebastian answered the door, looking as weary as the rest of us. "She cried herself to sleep."

He gestured us inside. A young redhead lay curled on the sofa, much like I used to sleep at Silver Creek.

"Did she say anything?" Alexander asked.

"Her name is Sophia. Last thing she remembers is shopping with friends before waking in some fancy woman's car. Then the tears started. She crashed out about five minutes ago."

'Why turn a child?' Nyx wondered.

"This is despicable." Sebastian murmured, draping a blanket over the sleeping girl.

"We know they have no boundaries." Julian muttered darkly.

We let her sleep for thirty minutes before Sebastian gently woke her.

Tears immediately welled in her eyes as she saw us watching her.

She sat up, brushing her shoulder-length hair behind her ears.

The fresh bite mark on her neck stood out starkly.

"Sophia?" I asked softly, remembering how intimidating these men could feel.

"Sophie." She whispered, her blue eyes darting nervously around the room.

"Sophie, I'm Athena."

"What's wrong with me? I feel so hot... and sick... I want my mom. I promised I'd be home for dinner." Fat tears rolled down her cheeks, which she swiped away angrily.

'She doesn't know.' Nyx realized. 'She has no idea what's been done to her.'

"Can someone take me home?" She continued weeping.

"Not possible right now." Sebastian said gently. "It isn't safe for you."

She whimpered as Alexander gestured for me to follow him outside.

"What do you want to do?" He asked.

"Me?"

He nodded. "The girl has no idea what she is or where she is."

"Why would they do this? Why would Victoria do this?"

"They're targeting your compassion. The men didn't work, so they're trying a different approach."

"I hate them." My hands clenched into fists as I closed my eyes. "They ruined my life, and now they've destroyed this girl's too. She'll never go home again. Never see her family or friends."

"Do you believe her story?"

"I can smell her fear."
###Chapter 0098
Alexander

Fury burned deep within her soul.
Athena had endured so much, yet this level of rage was new.
It was strange, yet captivating, to witness the fire blazing in her eyes, all ignited by this one girl.

She leaned heavily against the wall of Sebastian's house.
Her head tilted back, staring blankly at the clear blue sky.
Her body slid down the rough surface until she landed on the grass.
So much anger consumed her, and she had no outlet for it.
No idea how to direct it.

“Sophia will be fine.” I muttered softly.
I would never throw a child onto the streets.
A child who has no concept of what she will become.
Returning her to her family was not an option.
Her first shift will be pure terror.
It would be a fucking miracle if she didn’t kill them all.

“Right.” Athena murmured, her voice low.
Her eyes were nearly solid black.

“Someone within the pack will take her in. I won’t abandon her.”

“This won’t be the last. Will it?” She looked up at me, her gaze intense.
“He will change more kids. He will send them all our way.”
She shook her head slowly.
“I knew he was evil. But this? This is sick. This is...” Her words faded, thoughts too jumbled to continue.

“What he did to you was monstrous too, Athena.”

She quickly brushed her cheeks, wiping away tears that hadn't even fully formed.

“I want him dead, Alpha Alexander. I want every single one of them dead.”

“I know. And I am working on it.”

‘His death must be slow.’ Titan mused darkly. ‘He must feel every ounce of pain he has inflicted. Athena deserves her vengeance.’

The door swung open suddenly.
“Guys. I really need your help in here.”

I offered my hand to Athena.
She hesitated for a moment before finally taking it and pulling herself up.
I noticed her eyes were shifting back to their usual blue.

Inside, Sophia was sobbing uncontrollably.
Her fingers clawed at her own skin, tracing the fresh mark on her neck.
“What... what did they do to me?”

Athena froze.
Sophia's words were likely an echo of her own past, spoken repeatedly in her mind.
Hearing them from someone else must have triggered painful memories.

“Sophia, come sit down. We need to talk.” I kept my tone gentle and warm.
Her soft blue eyes met mine, and I saw her swallow hard.

“Please, sir, I just want to go home. To my mum and dad. To my little sister. Please? I won’t tell them anything. I won’t...” Her fingers dug harder into her neck.

“We can explain everything to you.” I offered, maintaining my calm to avoid frightening her further.

Her eyes searched my face desperately.
More tears streamed down her cheeks.
Sebastian handed her a tissue, but she just stood there, staring, making no attempt to dry her tears.
“I’m not... I’m not going home, am I?”

“I’m afraid it’s not that simple.”

She wiped sweat from her hairline with a trembling hand.
Sebastian quietly gestured toward an empty chair at the table.
She moved slowly, tucking strands of her red hair behind her ears.
“Please, please don’t hurt me.”

“I’m going to tell you something you probably won’t believe. All I ask is that you try to keep an open mind.”

“Your eyes are so weird.” She wiped her nose, trying to steady her racing heart.

Crimson eyes would indeed be strange to a human.

“The bite on your neck was from a Lycan.” There was no point in avoiding the truth.

She closed her eyes, shaking her head in denial.
“Like... like the stories.”

“Stories?”

She took the glass of water Sebastian offered and drank it slowly, draining it completely.
“Stories in the library,” she murmured, placing the empty glass back down.

How was it possible that a human library held more tales about Lycans than we did?

“Was I hunted? Was I chosen? Why me? I’m nobody. I barely get by at school. They all hate me because... well, just because.”

Fifteen-year-old girls were complicated.
She had completely missed the point I was trying to make.
I definitely did not miss being fifteen.

"I don't have all the answers right now. But I am searching for them."

"So," she sighed heavily. "what you're telling me is that you are a Lycan?”

“I am not a Lycan.”

“OMG you’re a fucking Vampire.” Her chair screeched as she jumped to her feet.
She held her fingers in a cross, as if that would save her.
“The eyes. I should have known.” She screeched in pure panic.
###Chapter 0099

I see Athena trying to hold back a laugh.

“I am not a Vampire,” I mutter, annoyed. “I am a Wolf, and you are a Lycan.”

Her mouth falls open. She shakes her head slowly.

“No… that can’t be right.” Her soft blue eyes dart toward Athena. “Please help me.”

Her voice comes out high and shaky.

“I’m a Lycan too,” Athena whispers, holding Sophia’s gaze.

“Your name is Athena, isn’t it?” Sophia asks, sinking back into her seat. “You’re the one they sent me to.”

“Yes.”

“Did you do this to me?” The girl doesn’t hesitate to ask.

“No. But I can help you.” Athena glances at me, sadness clouding her features. “The people who did this to you… they hurt me too. The only difference is, I was born like this. They forced this life onto you. That’s why you can’t go back to your family, Sophia. You might hurt them in ways you can’t even imagine. And trust me—you can’t control it. It happens when you least expect it.”

She’s talking about Caleb. How she killed him.

“But…”

Athena reaches across the table and takes Sophia’s hands. “This is something I know for sure, Sophia. We can keep you safe here. We’ll figure it out together. And I will personally make them pay for what they did to you.”

Sophia pulls her hands back and runs them through her red hair. “I’ll never see my family again?”

Athena looks at me. Her brow furrows. She sighs before turning back to Sophia. “No.”

Tears stream down faster now. Sobs shake her shoulders. I feel for her. Fifteen years old, thrown into a world she never knew existed. Victoria and Dominic are twisted. Far more than I am, and that’s saying something.

Sophia stays with Sebastian. It’s the first house she was brought to, and we think it makes her feel somewhat safe. Plus, his boys will be home soon. Knowing Sebastian is a father might comfort her even more.

“Is this what’s going to keep happening?” Athena asks as we walk across the grounds. “Young, innocent kids.”

“Probably.”

“I hate them,” she mutters.

“I know. What is Nyx saying about all this?”

Athena bites the inside of her cheek. Her eyes avoid mine.

“Athena?”

“She isn’t talking much.”

“But she’s been close to the surface. I saw it tonight, when anger took over.”

I try not to read her mind, but when she bends down to untie her shoelaces just to buy time, I give in.

“Can you really do that?” I snap, frustrated she kept something this important from me.

She looks up, a pink blush spreading across her skin. “I don’t know. Nyx thinks I can, but…”

“It would mean accepting your Alpha position,” I finish for her.

She frowns. No matter how many times it comes up, she always tries to change the subject.

“Even if I can, do you really think it will change anything? Victoria and Dominic have a whole pack behind them.”

“There’s only one way to find out. You have to accept who you are. Then we’ll see if you can link them all.”

Her eyes widen. She nibbles on her bottom lip. “I don’t want to be an Alpha.” It’s the one thing she’s always been sure of. She’s made that clear.

“What if it’s temporary?”

“I don’t follow.”

“Once they’re all dead, you won’t need to be an Alpha. You can exist just as you are now. As my mate. One day, as the mother of my pups. You can leave that world behind. Let the breed end with you, if that’s what you want.”

“And Sophia? You won’t kill her?” she whispers, warming to the idea.

“You and Sophia,” I confirm. “And any other children.”

She puffs out her cheeks. “What… what do I need to do?”
###Chapter 0100
Athena

His fingers closed around my elbow, pulling me inside the house.
Those crimson eyes searched mine, probing for any sign of hesitation.
I wasn't even sure myself if I was prepared for this.
But action had to be taken.
The situation had escalated beyond control.
Everything was spiraling, and now children were being turned.

"Beta Sebastian needs to warn Sophia." I mumbled as Alpha Alexander guided me toward the office.
"If this works, she'll be able to hear me too. It'll terrify her."
I'm twenty-two years old and still get unnerved hearing Alpha Alexander's voice in my head.
Nyx's presence is even more unsettling.

"I've already informed him. He's speaking with her right now."
I still couldn't see how this would help.
If anything, it seemed like it would only provoke them further.

He directed me to the chair, his voice firm but calm.
I could see the doubt in his eyes now.
He knew there was a strong possibility this might fail.

'Accept the role.' Nyx whispered in my mind.

'Will it actually work?'

'We won't know until you try.'

'Fine! I accept it!' I just wanted this over with.
I wanted their heads on spikes.
I wanted... My thoughts trailed off as I realized how dark they'd become.

'You'll need to do better than that.' Nyx's laughter echoed in my mind.

I looked up at Alpha Alexander.
He was watching me intently.
He once told me he could always tell when I was communicating with Nyx.

"You can do this. I'm right here with you." He gave me an encouraging smile.

"I accept." I muttered aloud.

Alpha Alexander shook his head slightly.
I understood what he meant - I needed to phrase it properly.

"I, Athena Harrison, accept the role of..." My voice faltered.
Could I truly go through with this?

'It's in our blood.' Nyx murmured softly.

I slumped back in the chair.
Caleb had been pushing relentlessly for me to reclaim my Alpha position.
To take control and lead Silver Creek.
He had insisted it was what they all needed.
Yet they all believed a woman shouldn't hold power.

"Continue." Alpha Alexander urged. "You have the strength for this."

"It's a trick." I whispered.

"Athena, you're panicking." His voice remained calm and steady.

"It was Caleb who revealed my identity to you.
He begged me to lead the Lycans.
To take command.
He claimed they needed me.
But he was working for Dominic all along."

I had been so foolish.
I never saw through his deception.

"You think this is what they want you to do?"

I swallowed the lump forming in my throat.
"They never wanted me to lead.
This is a trap.
This is exactly why Caleb was sent here."
Tears threatened to fall, but I blinked them back.
I felt incredibly stupid.

'Damn it!' Nyx snapped. 'That's been their plan all along.'
She was furious for not realizing it sooner.
Her restless pacing in my mind wasn't helping.
She hadn't been present until the very end.
She missed many of our conversations.

"His strategy is more sophisticated than we anticipated." Alpha Alexander muttered.
He circled the desk, scratching thoughtfully at his stubble.
He paused, leaning heavily on the table with his knuckles.
"What if you accept the role anyway?"

"I don't... I don't understand."

"As an Alpha, I can block out my pack's voices.
I choose who to listen to, who to link with.
The plan was for you to connect with all of them.
What if you start isolating them instead?
One at a time.
Getting inside their minds to gather the intelligence we need?"

"And what if it fails?"

'He's right.' Nyx murmured. 'I can assist with the blocking.'

Alpha Alexander stared at me, waiting for my response.

I sighed deeply, knowing neither of them would like my answer.
"We find another solution."

"Athena..." Alpha Alexander began.

"I never wanted this, Alpha Alexander.
Maybe if I'd been raised differently, things would be different.
But this... I don't want to lead them.
I don't want them using this as leverage to drag me back.
And I absolutely refuse to let them plant their damned seed in me!"
I was practically shouting by the end, which is something I rarely do.

"A..."

"Don't!" I snapped, storming out of the office.
Fury coursed through me, and thankfully Nyx remained silent.

I trudged toward the hospital, hoping Isabella would be there.
I needed someone else to talk to, or perhaps just some silence.

"Hey." She muttered without looking up from her work.
"Alexander mentioned you might come this way.
What did he do? He was being very cryptic in the link."

"He wants me to accept my role."

"As Luna?"

I hadn't even considered that possibility.
"No. As Alpha."

Her dark eyes snapped up, locking with mine.

She pressed her lips together and moved around the station she'd been leaning against.
"There must be a reason for this."

I filled her in on the conversation with Alpha Alexander and told her about the girl.

"I heard about the girl.
Sebastian is bringing her by later.
Thought it would be good for me to examine her."
###Chapter 0101

“What now?” I whispered, still accustomed to others having the solutions.

Isabella chuckled softly. “Athena, since your arrival, I’ve watched your confidence grow day by day. You couldn’t even step into the snow back then.”

She reminded me of the man I’d killed recently.

Then she pointed out I’d journeyed alone from the pack house to here.

Her gaze held mine. “You don’t need my answers. You already know what to do.”

My shoulders slumped. “Can we really solve this?”

“My brother has never been stopped by anything.” Her voice was firm. “If your mind is set, he’ll find a way. And Julian… he’s a master of strategy. His advice could be valuable.”

I hesitated. “Alpha Alexander forbade me from being alone with him.”

She smiled, gesturing around the empty hospital. “I’ll accompany you.”

She quickly located his whereabouts and scribbled a note, instructing others to link her if needed, then stuck it to the table.

“Where is he?” I asked, recalling he’d left during our meeting at Beta Sebastian’s home with Sophia.

“On duty.”

Venturing into the forest without Alpha Alexander’s permission was definitely against the rules.

We moved silently into the woods. Isabella ensured we avoided the boundaries, guiding us deep into the darkest parts. I’d asked Nyx to block Alpha Alexander from my thoughts temporarily, just so I could think clearly.

Scents mingled among the trees, making it hard to distinguish individuals. The guards rotated constantly to stay alert and confuse any intruders.

“Does Alexander know you’re this far out?” Julian’s voice came from above as he dropped from a tree, landing before us.

“Why were you up there?” Isabella snapped.

“Taking a page from Caleb’s book, if that was even his real name.” His dark eyes fixed on me, sending a shiver down my spine. I was relieved not to be alone with him. “You wanted to speak to me?” He scanned the area quickly.

“Have you… found a way to handle them?”

“Almost. Do you have information that could help?”

Nyx whispered a warning in my mind.

“I just want this to end.” I noticed Isabella giving me a strange look, but she remained silent.

“You came all this way to ask that?” He raised an eyebrow. “My people are exhausted, working tirelessly to keep everyone safe. They’re starting to make mistakes.”

“Mistakes?” Isabella questioned.

“It’s been dealt with.” His glance at me suggested punishments had been carried out.

“I never asked for any of this.”

He placed his hands on my shoulders, and every muscle in my body tensed. “Are you seeking trouble, Athena?”

He turned me toward the direction we’d come from. “Return to the house.”

“If I accept my Alpha position, will that help?” The words spilled out.

His hands dropped, and he moved in front of me, frowning deeply. “I thought you didn’t want that?”

“I told Alpha Alexander I believe it’s what they expect.” I sighed, glancing at Isabella, who nodded encouragement. “I think it’s a trap. Caleb was supposed to persuade me to accept. I think…” I groaned. “Alpha Alexander believes I should link them one by one.”

“No.”

His immediate, firm response startled me.

“No, that’s not what they expect? Or no, Alexander is wrong?” Isabella asked.

“Both.” He winked at me.

“I don’t understand.”

“Caleb got inside your head, Athena. He was testing how far you’d go to ignore your Alpha blood. It was a game. I’ve seen it before. You’re unique. They know it, and we know it too.”

“You think she should accept her role?” Isabella pressed.

“That’s not my decision. But if she does, it could work to our advantage.”

“You want me to link them?”

“No. That would enrage Victoria. It’ll draw her and the others out. Like it or not, they’ll recognize who the true Alpha is. That’s what counts. No linking necessary.”

“Plan B,” Isabella murmured.

“Plan B,” Julian confirmed.

He’d been hoping for this all along. “What… what is Plan B?”

Julian smiled at me. “You.”

###Chapter 0103
Athena

My gaze darted between Julian and Isabella.

They had been anticipating this moment.

Waiting specifically for me.

Was Alpha Alexander part of this scheme?

“This… this was your strategy from the beginning?”

“A contingency plan. Alexander made it clear you were resistant, so it became our secondary option.” Julian remarked casually. “And don’t jump to conclusions. We aren’t literally using you as live bait.”

“It’s about the perception of your control.” Isabella added quietly. “We understand you don’t desire it. We know you want no connection to them. But they remain unaware. From their perspective, you embracing your position implies you welcome it.”

“Right!” It irritated me that Julian and Isabella had already debated this as a viable tactic.

Isabella seized my wrists, her dark eyes locking onto mine. “They aren’t solely coming for you. They will eliminate us to reach you. Our pack, as fierce as we are, isn’t prepared to die.”

“Isabella!” Julian snapped sharply.

She released my wrists, turning toward her brother. “I’m merely stating we’ve sacrificed greatly for her. She could at least do this for us.”

“That isn’t your decision to make!” Julian warned his sister, his tone severe. “Alexander will execute whatever is necessary to protect her. We can only present her with choices.”

Isabella frowned, and I suddenly understood her outburst wasn’t born from anger. It was pure panic, a deep fear that the Lycans would devastate the pack she cherished.

A rustle sounded from the trees. All three of us instantly turned toward the noise.

A massive Lycan burst through the bushes, charging directly at us. It was the largest we had encountered, standing well over eight feet tall. Its heavily muscled arms stretched out as it lunged forward.

Its focus was entirely on me. Drool dripped from its razor-sharp teeth. Claws were raised, poised to strike. It showed no concern for the others present. Each footfall hit the ground with such force the earth vibrated beneath me.

White-hot rage surged through my veins.

Julian shoved me backward, shifting instantly into a powerful black wolf. He launched himself at the Lycan.

The Lycan swatted him aside effortlessly, sending Julian crashing into a tree trunk as if he were weightless.

“Shift!” I screamed at Nyx. I was defenseless in this form. I knew shifting was the only way to protect both myself and Isabella.

Nyx reacted without delay. She forced the transformation forward.

The pain was excruciating, but thankfully brief. My bones stretched and my body reconfigured. My clothing tore away, falling to the ground in shreds.

The Lycan skidded to a halt directly in front of me.

At that exact moment, my claws plunged deep into its chest.

It glanced down at the claws embedded in its body. Unlike when I killed Caleb, I could distinctly feel the heart pulsating against my grasp. I felt my claws slide into the organ smoothly, steadily.

The heart raced frantically, fighting to continue beating.

I did not retract my claws.

I watched life fade from the beast’s eyes, like a light slowly dimming to darkness.

A thrill of satisfaction fluttered through me.

One by one, I withdrew my claws from the Lycan’s chest.

It collapsed backward, hitting the forest floor with a heavy, final thud.

No pieces of heart remained on my claws this time. I felt a flicker of disappointment.

“Athena? Athena, are you okay?” Isabella stood staring up at me. The height difference almost made me laugh; she was usually taller.

I nodded, feeling the familiar surge of pain return. My claws retracted. My limbs shortened until I stood completely naked amidst the trees.

“Crap.” Isabella swiftly removed her jacket and wrapped it around me. It covered very little, but at least I wasn’t fully exposed.

She hurried over to Julian, who hadn’t moved since impacting the tree.

“Is he… is he dead?” I whispered, dread filling me.

“No, but his back might be broken. That’s why he’s still unconscious. It takes hours to heal. I need to link Alexander immediately.”

I nodded, my attention returning to the dead Lycan. Aside from the five small red marks on its chest, it appeared to be merely sleeping.

‘He will not wake.’ Nyx murmured. ‘The heart is pierced. Blood is slowly leaking into the cavity.’ She let out a soft, dark laugh. I fought hard not to laugh with her.
###Chapter 0104

I was terrified of shifting.
Scared of becoming that monster who attacked the pack.
But standing here over the dead Lycan, I realized something.
It felt liberating.

Footsteps rushed toward us.
Alpha Alexander appeared with Theodore.
Their eyes instantly landed on the dead Lycan.
Neither spoke as their gazes shifted to me, taking in the fact I wore only a jacket.

“You shifted?” Theodore asked softly. “Completely?”
I remained motionless.

“She did,” Isabella exclaimed. “She shifted and killed him without a second thought.”

“Julian?” Alpha Alexander asked, his eyes briefly leaving mine to check on his unconscious brother.
Isabella repeated everything she had told me.

“Theodore, help Isabella get him to the hospital.”
Once they were gone, he removed his own shirt and replaced the jacket Isabella had given me.
His was longer, reaching mid-thigh.

His finger lifted my chin, tilting my face toward his. “You enjoyed it, didn’t you?”

I didn’t want to admit it.
I didn’t want to tell him how powerful I had felt.
I didn’t want to confess that I’d kill that Lycan a thousand times over if it brought me that same rush.
I didn’t want to speak the truth.

His lips brushed my cheek, his warm minty breath grazing my skin. “You don’t have to say it. I can read your thoughts.”

He stepped back and grabbed the Lycan by its ankles, dragging it across the ground into the trees.

“Where... where are you taking him?”
“I need to dispose of him. I won’t allow them to litter my territory.”

I followed him to a clearing where Alpha Alexander quickly set the body ablaze.
It burned fast.
The smell of burning flesh saturated the air.

Alpha Alexander moved away from the flames and stood behind me.
His arms wrapped around my waist, his lips finding the mark on my neck.

“How many more will come, Alpha Alexander?” I whispered as thick smoke darkened the sky.

“I think it’s time you stopped calling me that, don’t you? You’ve more than earned your place here.”

Dropping the ‘Alpha’ felt wrong.
For years, I was conditioned to respect those in power.
Disrespect meant punishment.
I only stopped using titles for Dominic and Marcus because I was ordered to.

“You are my equal,” he murmured near my ear. “You are an Alpha.”

He turned me to face him, his hand pressing against the small of my back as he held me close.
His crimson eyes searched mine.

“You... you didn’t answer my question,” I said, avoiding his name intentionally. He noticed.

His lips curved. “Because there is no answer.”

“You’re... waiting for me?” I sighed, wrinkling my nose as the stench of burning flesh intensified.

“Yes.”

“Why didn’t you tell me I was part of the plan? That you’re relying on me?”

‘Because he thinks we can’t handle it!’ Nyx snapped.

“I wanted you to be ready,” Alpha Alexander murmured.
He tucked a strand of my hair behind my ear. “As much as I adore this darkness in you, you must be prepared. We don’t know what they’ll throw at us.”

I stared at him, feeling the heat of the fire behind me.
Maybe this was the only way.

‘I will always have your back,’ Nyx whispered.

I pushed Alpha Alexander back as I stepped away. “I, Athena Harrison, accept my position as Alpha of the Lycans of Silver Creek.”

A current shot through my body.
It surged from my toes to my fingertips.
It wasn’t painful like shifting used to be.
It felt electric, coursing through my veins.
It felt powerful.
For one brief moment, I felt unstoppable.
It belongs to me.

My heart beat so loudly it made my body vibrate.
Voices echoed in my head.
Sounds of anger and annoyance, all shouting at me.
Nyx worked hard to shut them down, blocking each one until I heard a familiar voice.

It belongs to me.

“We are coming for you.”
###Chapter 0105
Athena

Dominic's voice hadn't echoed in my mind since we returned to Silver Creek.
Hearing it now sent an icy tremor down my spine.
My body shook involuntarily.
His words had always been instruments of fear.

"You hear them?" Alpha Alexander asked softly.
I nodded.
"Alp—" I stopped when he raised an eyebrow.
"Equals," he murmured. "You can't keep addressing everyone as Alpha or Beta anymore." His lips curved into a slight smile. "You've surpassed that. You're an Alpha now."

"D... Alexander," I stammered.
It felt strange and wrong to say his name without the title.
"Nyx is blocking them out. But Dominic broke through. They're coming."
I turned back toward the body consumed by flames.
The bones were nearly bare.
A dark thought crept into my mind—doing the same to Dominic and Victoria.
I wanted them to feel every ounce of pain I had endured.
Burning them alive seemed fitting.

I wasn’t that timid girl anymore.

Alexander was listening to my thoughts, as he always did when I grew quiet.
His hand caught mine.
His fingers interlaced with mine, locking us together.
He leaned close. "As much as I want to take you right now, we need to go prepare."

He seemed drawn to this new, darker side of me.

Alexander pulled me swiftly through the forest.
His eyes scanned constantly, ensuring we avoided danger.

We broke through the trees into the main pack area.
Theodore was striding toward us.
His arms swung forcefully at his sides.

"Julian broke his back in two places. He'll be down for the rest of the day," he told Alexander as he halted.
His deep green eyes flickered toward me.
Did he know?

"Two places?" Alexander confirmed.
Theodore nodded.
His usual bun was undone, dark hair framing his face, making him look fierce.
"He'll be out for a while."

His gaze dropped to our joined hands.
"What's happening? Did you handle the body?"

Alexander nodded.
"They're coming. We don't know when, but it's imminent. Julian was right."

Theodore's green eyes fixed on me.
"You've accepted, haven't you? That's how you know they're coming."

I nodded slowly.
He didn't sound pleased. It felt almost like an accusation.

"What's wrong, Theodore?" Alexander questioned.

"Nothing. I'm just surprised, that's all."

"Surprised?"

"After everything that's happened, I didn't expect... this." He frowned. "I didn't expect it to happen."

'He's hiding something,' Nyx murmured.

I agreed. His shifting eyes gave him away.

"Just tell us!" Alexander snapped, losing patience.

Theodore sighed.
"The reason I came to find you before we were called to the forest... I managed to uncover more about the one who died during her third binding."

"And?"

"Maybe we should discuss this inside."

"Here is fine," Alexander snapped, annoyed by the delay.

Theodore glanced around, checking if we were alone.
I found myself doing the same.
His nervousness was contagious.

"They tried binding her after she became Alpha. That's what killed her. If they get their hands on you..."

"You think they'll bind me and it'll kill me?" I muttered.

'Nothing is ever simple, is it?' Nyx groaned.

Theodore let out a heavy sigh and nodded.

"That's not going to happen," Alexander stated, staring at Theodore. "Do you really think I'd let her out of my sight long enough for them to take her?"

Did he forget I left the house alone?
Or that Isabella and I went into the forest without him?
I kept my mouth shut. Now wasn't the time for stupid remarks.

"Well, no. It's just... There's talk about how foolish this Dominic is. What if it's an act? Caleb kept saying Dominic was stupid, that Victoria was pulling the strings. If you think about it, it's probably both of them. What if they want us to believe one is weaker than the other?"
###Chapter 0106

Alexander’s expression is dark, a scowl etched into his features. A dull ache begins to pulse behind my eyes.

“It makes you uneasy?” Alexander mutters, his voice low.

“Obviously it does.”

I glance at Theodore. He was tall and broad-shouldered, like most men here. Yet he was different. He preferred solitude, buried in books and research. I couldn’t recall ever seeing him train with the others.

There was a time I questioned Alexander about Theodore truly being a Wolf. He assured me Theodore joined every pack run. He had done so since joining Obsidian Howl.

“You were bullied.” The memory of what I’d been told surfaces. “You never knew when an attack was coming. That’s why this situation makes you nervous.”

His deep green eyes lock onto mine. I knew my words had struck a chord.

“I care about you, Athena. I don’t want to see any harm come to you.”

Tell him it won’t.’ Nyx whispers softly.

I repeat her assurance. Theodore sighs, as if he doesn’t believe it. His green eyes shift upward to Alexander. “What do you need me to do?”

News of my acceptance spreads rapidly. Alexander is flooded with questions. He spends the entire afternoon and late evening in discussions with his pack.

He recalled everyone from the forest. He insisted they all get proper rest. He told them to eat while they could.

We didn’t know when the attack would come. We just knew it would. So Alexander ordered them to sleep while possible. He was anticipating a long night.

It’s nearly midnight when I’m jolted awake. Panic surges through me. This is it. It’s happening.

“Julian is awake.” Alexander says to me. He flicks on the light, blinding my tired eyes. “He demands to speak with you.”

“I thought we were under attack.” My hand presses against my chest.

“Come!” Alexander grabs my hands, pulling me upright. He’s already moving to the closet, fetching clothes for me.

We trek across the grounds toward the hospital. I notice how many Wolves are awake and moving at this hour.

“What are they doing?”

“Preparing the pups.”

“You’re letting the pups fight?” I ask, horrified.

‘No, it won’t be safe for them here. I must preserve my pack. The elder Wolves are relocating them to a secure location. They’ll return when it’s safe.’

I release a sigh of relief. “Sophia too?”

“That’s Sophia’s choice. She remains emotionally fragile. And technically, she isn’t part of this pack.”

His answer isn’t what I wanted. I needed to know she would be protected. She was thrust into a life she never deserved.

His hand presses against the small of my back, guiding me into the hospital.

I hear Julian arguing before we even open the doors. He’s demanding Isabella release him.

“You aren’t fully healed!” Isabella snaps as we enter. “Besides, you asked for Athena. She’s here.”

The moment I step into his room, Julian’s dark eyes find mine.

He says nothing. Have they told him? Does he know I accepted my position?

He knows.’ Nyx murmurs.

Seconds stretch into what feels like hours. No one speaks. His dark eyes remain fixed on me, as if he’s solving a puzzle.

“What’s on your mind?” Alexander asks him.

“That depends. How close are you willing to let them get?”

The plan of using me as bait is shifting. I know he’s talking about me. I’m what they want.

Alexander studies my face before turning back to his brother. “If they get close enough to lay a hand on her, be prepared for the consequences.”

That warning tone returns. Low and laced with danger. A personal threat to Julian. If his plan fails, Alexander will end him.

It almost frightens me, how far he’s willing to go to keep me safe.

Almost.
###Chapter 0107
Alexander

“No.”

“This isn’t up for debate!” I snap at my brother. I would never send my mate straight into a death trap.

“Alexander, you brought me back for my strategic mind!”

“There has to be another option.”

I was relieved that Isabella had persuaded Athena to take a walk with her. She didn’t need to hear Julian and me fighting. Knowing her, she’d likely agree to his reckless plan.

“They’ll know, Julian. They aren’t foolish enough to believe I’d abandon her. They’ll wait. They’ll expect some of us to stay behind. They know I would never leave her unguarded.”

“That’s exactly why it will work.”

If he weren’t lying injured in that bed, my fist would have met his face.

‘You insisted on bringing him back!’ Titan grumbled.

“Sometimes the simplest plans are the most effective.” Julian sighed, still avoiding my gaze.

“We’ll find another damn way!”

I collapsed into the chair beside his bed. I expected more from my own brother. He should understand I won’t gamble with Athena’s life.

“Just hear me out, will you?” he shot back.

I gestured for him to continue, though my answer would still be no.

“You can mind-link her, correct?” he asked.

“Obviously.”

“Then she won’t be alone. We send her into the forest as bait while the pack picks off the Lycans one by one.”

“No. I am not sending her out there alone!” We were going in circles. My patience was fraying. Why couldn’t he grasp this was not an option?

“Then I’m out of ideas, Alexander. You rejected the first plan too. These bastards won’t go down easy. We don’t know what tricks they have. We have no clue how many they’ve turned. For all we know, thousands could be marching toward us right now.” He rubbed his temples. “Some might be as young as that kid at Sebastian’s house. They can shift at thirteen, right?”

He winced as he adjusted himself in the bed.

“You’re right,” I muttered. “We don’t know their numbers. Look at you. One big Lycan took you out.”

He bared his teeth at me. “I was protecting your mate.”

“Clearly!” I snorted. “She was the one who killed it.”

The color drained from his face. “Isabella said it was you and Theodore.”

I shook my head. “Athena has fully embraced her Alpha nature. She completed her shift. Killed it the same way she killed the other one. All I did was burn the corpse.”

“She went for the heart again, didn’t she?”

“There’s no coming back from a pierced heart,” I mused. Twice now, her first and only target was the heart. Most Wolves aim for the throat. It was almost instinctual, deeply ingrained in her.

I stood up. “If they capture her, she won’t survive.”

“Don’t they want her for an heir?”

“It’s different now. She is exactly what she was meant to be. If they find a way to bind her power again, she will die. Every path leads to her death. Titan and I refuse to let that happen.”

He looked me dead in the eye. “So put a fucking pup in her!”

“We’ve had this conversation,” I said, exhausted. It was like talking to a wall.

I’ve told you repeatedly. Your brother is an idiot.’ Titan shook his head.

“No.” Julian pushed himself up higher, grimacing in pain. “You’re not listening. They just need to believe she is carrying your heir. So does everyone else.”

“You want to win this war with a lie?”

“I’m saying all is fair in war. It’s not the worst thing we’ve ever done.” His dark eyes scanned the room for eavesdroppers. “Play them at their own game. Isn’t that what they’ve always done? They made her believe she was one of us. We can call in every single pack bound by loyalty to you. Because the Lycans won’t just be coming for her. They’ll be coming for your pup.” He emphasized the last word. “She doesn’t need to be near the fight. They just need to believe it.”
###Chapter 0108

My gaze darted to the wall clock. “What if they attack within hours?”

He followed my line of sight. “They’d be idiots to strike now. You did exactly as I said. If they have any intel, they won’t risk hitting us when everyone’s alert and rested.”

“I have to talk to her first,” I muttered. Athena was a terrible liar. If I saw through it, Dominic or Victoria definitely would.

“Listen. If you want her safe and out of whatever’s coming, this is the only way.” He watched me rise. “If you see my twin, send her in?”

I rolled my eyes. “She won’t release you until you’re fully healed.”

“A Wolf’s gotta try.”

Outside, Isabella and Athena were deep in conversation on a small bench. They fell silent as I approached. “He wants to see you,” I told Isabella.

“Already said no. I know him—he’ll just run straight back out.” She shook her head and stormed inside, ready to lay down the law with Julian.

Athena stayed quiet. She picked nervously at the wooden bench, avoiding my eyes.

“You’re doing it again,” I murmured, taking Isabella’s vacated seat.

“Isabella told me.”

“Did she now? She certainly has a habit of that.” I frowned. She hadn’t been inside when Julian and I discussed the plan. “What exactly did she say?”

“That I’d be in the forest—”

“No.” I cut her off and pulled her against me. “Not happening. But Julian had another idea. I need to know if you’re okay with it.”

She tilted her head. Moonlight glinted in her blue eyes, reminding me of a crystal-clear lake my father took us to once. That was the last time I saw him and my stepmother.

“Not here.” I had no idea how she’d react. I didn’t want an audience.

‘She won’t agree,’ Titan mumbled.

‘I have to try.’

We headed back to the house, barely acknowledging anyone around us.

She took her usual spot in the office, drawing her knees to her chest. Messy dark hair fell around her face. She quickly tucked it behind her ears.

Her eyes widened as I laid out Julian’s idea. By the time I finished, she blinked several times, staring at me like I’d lost my mind.

“You…want to put your pup in me? I thought we agreed to wait a year?”

“That was the contract you wanted. We’re way past that now.” I raised a brow, amused, but she didn’t see it that way.

She snorted, blinking again. Her blue eyes steadily darkened. Nyx was close to the surface.

“I can’t,” she muttered, keeping her gaze low. “I’m not ready. I’m twenty-two. The only places I’ve ever been are here, Silver Creek, and the city—and I only went there once. I still can’t read properly. I definitely can’t write. What kind of mother would that make me?” She shook her head. “I’m sorry. I can’t.”

“Then you’ll have to lie.” I kept my focus on her, trying to read her reaction.

“Huh? I can’t lie about something like that.” Her eyes met mine, scowling deeply.

When I didn’t respond, she leaned back, tilting her head over the rest. Her eyes fixed on the ceiling. “He thinks it’s the only other way?”

“Yes. Other packs that owe me will join the cause.”

“Because they’ll think I’m carrying your heir.”

I nodded.

“I can’t make a decision like that, Alpha…Alexander.”

‘Told you,’ Titan mused. He loved being right.

“Look at me,” I ordered. Her face slowly turned to mine. “This way, you live.”
###Chapter 0109

Athena

He's telling us we're going to die.

Nyx murmurs the words. I can't tell if she's angry or amused. Either way, she sounds...strangely content.

"I might be naive in some ways, but I understand him perfectly!" I snap back at her.

She sighs deeply. 'We will have pups one day. He is our mate. The bond is permanent. We should accept it.'

Her words don't comfort me as I walk back to the bedroom. They only make my anxiety worse. "Exactly," I hiss. "One day! Not now!"

Then lie!

I'm terrible at lying!

Nyx falls silent immediately. She's learned when to retreat, recognizing when I won't listen. It's easier to think without her voice in my head. Easier to get lost in my own thoughts as I try to process everything.

A bitter laugh escapes me as I collapse onto the bed, still fully dressed. If it weren't for Alexander, I would have believed the voice was a sign of madness.

My eyes drift to the clock. It's nearly four in the morning. Exhaustion weighs me down, and a feeling tells me today will be long. My eyelids grow heavy as I roll onto my stomach. I just need a few hours of sleep. That's all.

Screams fill the air around me. People run and shout for help while I stand frozen, watching the chaos unfold.

As figures move, blood-covered faces become visible. My parents. My stomach drops and my lungs constrict. My heartbeat thunders in my ears, loud and overwhelming.

I want to reach them, but my feet are rooted to the ground. Their names die on my lips as I try to call out.

Pure chaos surrounds me. Tears burn my eyes until I see him. Dominic, lurking in the shadows. His smile is so wide it looks terrifying.

He watches them, hidden from view. He had been waiting for this. Fingers suddenly wrap around my wrist, dragging me away.

"She poisoned them!"

"Get her out of here!"

"Athena! What did you do?"

I stare into Victoria's eyes. They hold no emotion as she pulls me from the nightmare. I look up at her, not as a child, but as the woman I am now.

"Stupid girl!" Her hand strikes my face. She says something else, but I hear Alexander calling my name. How is he here?

I turn my head, searching for him. Victoria's sharp nails dig into my face, squeezing my chin and forcing me to look at her.

"Athena, wake up! You're having a nightmare!"

I gasp as I'm torn from the memory. My lungs struggle against the oxygen trying to fill them. My heart races, and sweat trickles down my face.

"You're okay. You're safe." Alexander whispers.

It...It wasn't a nightmare. It was...a...memory? I can't be certain. What if I'm only seeing what I want to see? What if my own mind is deceiving me?

"Your parents?" He asks softly.

I nod, pulling off my sweat-soaked top. "I think...I think Dominic was there that night. But I can't be sure."

Alexander pulls me against him, asking me to recount everything. His fingers comb through my damp hair, and he doesn't interrupt once.

"Is it just my imagination, or do you think it's a real memory?"

"You said it felt like you were seeing it through adult eyes? There's a good chance the memory is accurate. As children, we often see only what we can handle, blocking out what we deem unimportant. But the memory remains, still present."

They were the reason I never had loving parents. And why? All for a position of power neither of them deserved.

"I want them dead, Alexander." I want to see blood pour from their eyes like it did from my parents. I want to be the last thing they see as their lives fade. But it means I must lie, or I must let him put a pup in me.

Both choices feel wrong.

It will keep us alive. Nyx whispers.

"They will be dead soon enough." Alexander murmurs in my ear.

He kisses my cheek, slowly moving down to my neck. His teeth graze my skin as he nips at my flesh, and a soft groan escapes me.

He moves down the bed, his lips leaving trails of electricity over my skin, making my nipples harden.

He takes one in his mouth, his tongue flicking over the tip, making it impossibly harder. Suddenly he bites down, sending a strange new wave of pleasure through me.

His eyes flash up to mine, locking onto them. I know exactly what he's doing. He's taking the choice away from me, and I don't want to stop him.

I feel warm blood trickle down the side of my breast. His tongue quickly captures every drop before he repeats the process with my other nipple.

The second bite is harder, his teeth sinking deeper, like when he marked me. I gasp, which seems to make him suck harder.

My hands tangle in his dark hair as I arch my back, pushing my nipple deeper into his mouth. My panties grow wetter with each passing moment.
###Chapter 0110

His palm cups my damp heat through the fabric.

A single finger slides back and forth, teasing the ache building deep within me.

His mouth crashes against mine, forcing me to taste the metallic hint of my own blood.

I grind myself against his hand, desperate for more than just this touch.

I feel the curve of his smile against my lips.

His fingers hook into the waistband of my joggers.

He lifts my hips from the mattress.

In one swift motion, he strips away the joggers and my soaked panties.

His lips blaze a trail up my inner thigh.

His tongue finds my clit with unerring accuracy.

My head falls back as a long, low moan tears from my throat.

His teeth clamp down on my swollen flesh, sending a shockwave through me.

I grind against his face, knowing he will be drenched in my release.

The spasms begin to take over, my body trembling.

He doesn’t stop.

His tongue works in tandem with his fingers.

He drives me straight into an explosive, shattering orgasm.

Before I can even catch my breath, he flips me over.

He pulls my legs over his shoulders, burying his face in me once more.

“Oh, Alexander.” I moan as his tongue flicks against me from this new angle.

My thighs clamp around his head, holding him there.

I never want him to stop as my body convulses around him.

“I want you to sit on my cock.” He mutters into my skin as the aftershocks still rock me.

I turn to face him.

He’s already freed himself, his hand stroking his hardened length.

It looks bigger. Thicker.

Alexander pulls me toward him until I’m straddling his lap.

The tip of him presses insistently against my entrance.

He grabs my chin, forcing my eyes to his. “Slow.”

I lower myself onto him.

It’s tight. Unbelievably tight.

“Slower!” He grits out, pulling my face closer to his. “I want to make sure I put a pup in you.”

The moment I take him to the hilt, he seems to swell, locking us together.

I can’t move even if I wanted to.

He’s buried so deep, I swear I can feel him in my stomach.

His lips trail across my jaw.

A hand fists in my hair, yanking my head back.

His tongue flicks over the mark he gave me.

Then I feel his teeth again, sinking deep into my flesh.

A moan escapes my throat.

Hearing it, he bites down harder.

He thrusts up into me.

A brutal mix of pain and pleasure tears through my body, catapulting me into pure ecstasy.

As his teeth retract, I collapse forward against his chest, utterly spent.

He quickly flips us over, bracing his weight on his elbows.

His eyes lock with mine.

He thrusts into me again.

“Again?” I whisper, my insides already throbbing.

“I told you. I need to be certain.”

Hours passed before he finally let me out of that bedroom.

His determination was fierce, as if he were the one in heat.

I would feel the results of this for days.

“I don’t need to hear about you having sex with my brother!” Isabella whines, covering one ear as she hands me an ice pack.

I slide it between my thighs, grateful for the relief as I sit down. “I’m not giving you details. I just need to know if it worked.”

“It’s too early to tell. Just be grateful that Dominic and his crew haven’t attacked. It means there’s more of a chance of him getting you pregnant.” She peers at me over her coffee. “What made you change your mind?”

“It wasn’t a change of mind. I just…” It sounded foolish even to me. “I couldn’t choose between lying and just getting pregnant. I let Alexander take control.”

“Hmm, well, it would have happened eventually, right?”

“That’s what Nyx said. But what if it doesn’t work?”

“Never in the history of Wolves has it failed.”

My heart plummets. “I’m not a Wolf. And Lycans are a dying breed.”

A heavy silence falls.

Isabella is lost for words. Every time she opens her mouth, nothing comes out.

“I’m not… I’m not trying to be negative. But we need to look at the facts.”

Nyx is uncomfortably silent too, which isn’t helping.

“There are signs before it will even show on a scan.” Isabella mutters. “Your scent. It will alter slightly to compensate for the extra hormones. Your mood might change.”

I almost snort. She hasn’t heard the dark thoughts that pop up to surprise me.

“You’ll pee more. Some women complain of sore breasts. And then the obvious one. No period. It’s just a waiting game.”

“A waiting game.” I murmur.

Knowing Alexander would never settle for that.

He was already growing antsy about Dominic’s silence.

The quiet was more unnerving than any attack.

It set me on edge more than anything.
###Chapter 0111
Alexander

“It’s your decision now.” Julian mutters. “All the vulnerable members have been moved out.”

“It’s been a full week!” I snap. I anticipated an attack from Dominic by now. But there was nothing. No rogue Lycans. No threats. Silence. It made me uneasy.

“We can organize another forest sweep.” Julian suggests.

“Are they checking the trees this time?”

He scoffs. “Obviously. We won’t repeat that error.”

My gaze shifts to the wall calendar. The next full moon was approaching fast.

“You believe they’ll strike then?” Sebastian murmurs. He had been quiet, listening to my heated exchange with my brother.

“When are we most likely to be absent?” I sigh. “It’s precisely what Caleb did. He waited until we were gone. He eliminated the guards I posted. He nearly took Athena.” The memory of almost losing her that night churned my stomach.

“Reinforcements should be here by then.” Julian informs me. “The call for aid has been sent.”

“They will need to flee as well.”

“Then I’ll remain with her.” Julian offers.

Sebastian and I stare at him. I still disliked the idea of him being alone with my mate. Now, I was confident Athena could defend herself, but that didn’t mean I wanted her to kill my brother.

“You need to run too. The moonlight strengthens us.”

He gives a slow nod. “But I don’t require it like you do. You’re the Alpha. You must lead the pack. I am a capable fighter.”

“A single Lycan overpowered you.” Sebastian muses.

Titan’s laugh echoes in my mind at Sebastian's remark. ‘It happens every single time.’

“Hey! I was protecting Athena and my sister!” Julian glares at Sebastian. “After you,” he points at me, “I am the next best option.”

“Is that so?” Sebastian raises an eyebrow. “Shall we test that theory?”

“OUTSIDE!” Julian shouts.

This occurs at least once a year.

Each time, I allow it. Julian needs reminding. He is skilled in war tactics, but not in direct combat.

Still, Julian never accepts it. He always feels the need to prove himself.

I follow them out of the house. I watch them square off. I roll my eyes as they begin circling each other. Sebastian has his hands in his pockets, moving with utter boredom. Julian is crouched, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.

“If I win, I get to guard the Luna!” Julian snaps.

“Alpha.” Sebastian corrects flatly. “If you win, you get to PROTECT the Alpha.”

I see my brother roll his eyes. I know that will irritate Sebastian further.

Julian charges. Sebastian simply sidesteps. Julian skids on the grass and quickly turns, lunging again. It resembles a cartoon where the smaller one never succeeds.

They end up wrestling on the grass. I catch my mate’s lavender scent. She stops beside me. “What… what are they doing?”

“Deciding who will watch over you during the next full moon.”

I feel her blue eyes on me.

“Don’t worry. It will be Sebastian.”

“Then why are you letting them fight?” I hear the alarm in her voice.

“Julian does this constantly. He challenges Sebastian or me. He never wins.” I mutter just as Sebastian lands a punch on my brother’s nose. “It’s simpler to let them settle it.”

I pull Athena back against my chest. I lock my arms around her. I rest my hands on her stomach.

Every day I’ve taken her, filling her with my seed. Still, her scent shows no change. No sign she carries my pup. Isabella said the same thing she told Athena. It’s still too early to know.

“How are you feeling?” I whisper in her ear as she watches the fight.

“Sore.” Her tone holds a warning. A clear warning not to try anything today. She tilts her head back to look up at me. Her eyes are nearly pitch black. It’s more than a warning. It’s a threat.

I suppress a chuckle and kiss her forehead. If Nyx believes she can threaten me on Athena’s behalf, she is mistaken. I kiss her again, staying silent. My eyes likely tell her everything. I do not respond well to threats.

Her attention returns to the men still wrestling. Julian is a little bloody. The blood on Sebastian is also Julian’s. Not a single bruise marks Sebastian’s skin.

“Guys, that’s enough. You’ve been at this long enough.”
###Chapter 0112

Sebastian pinned Julian down.

He sat on Julian's chest, knees digging hard into his shoulders.

"Do you give up?"

Julian bared his teeth.

"Never."

Sebastian pressed his knees deeper.

Julian winced but kept struggling.

I had to admit, he never backed down from a fight.

"I'm sorry Julian. You lost." I called out.

He thumped the ground with his fist and finally relaxed.

"Fine."

"Happy?" I whispered to Athena.

She nodded.

"I need to talk to you."

Her hand linked with mine.

She pulled me toward the house and into my office.

She released my hand and sat in her usual spot.

This time, she didn't curl her legs to her chest.

"Is everything okay?"

"There's a flaw in your plan." She didn't hesitate. "You and Isabella both said my scent would change. That you'd be able to tell I'm pregnant."

"I did say that."

"What about the guests? They'll know I'm not."

"We still have a couple of days."

"And if I'm still not?"

"Then we tell them your Lycan half is masking it." I leaned against my desk, watching her. "Who would have thought you'd be worried about not carrying my heir?"

Exactly two days later, I noticed the subtle shift in her lavender scent.

Athena was curled up asleep, hugging a pillow while I showered.

The moment I turned off the water, I detected the change.

I walked over to her, tempted to wake her and share the news.

Instead, I slid my hand between her and the pillow.

I rested it on her flat stomach, savoring being the first to know.

'Well, it finally happened.' Titan mused. 'Years we've waited for this.'

I agreed, but sighed internally. 'It was a pregnancy of convenience.'

'Doesn't matter. It's still our pup. Athena will be a great mother. Her past trauma will ensure that.'

'I hope you're right.'

I pulled the blanket up around her and quickly dressed.

Isabella would be the first I told. She was both pack doctor and my baby sister.

"You have to tell him." I heard Isabella say as I pushed the door open.

"He's your brother!" Theodore's words came out in a rushed whisper.

"And he's our Alpha. It doesn't matter who tells him. He needs to know."

"I need to know what?"

They both jumped, which infuriated me. They wouldn't have noticed if one of Dominic's men had crept up.

"Well?"

"You need to see for yourself." Isabella muttered, scurrying around the station.

She grabbed my hand and led me to the room at the far end. "I don't know how to help her."

"Her?"

She pushed open the heavy door.

The smell of iron hit me.

Blood was splattered across the walls, the floor, the door, the cupboards.

In the corner, a naked Sophia sat rocking.

Deep wounds covered her arms, face, and body.

They were healing slowly, likely because her body was exhausted.

"Sebastian left her with me last night." Theodore muttered. "She cut her finger opening a tin. She watched it heal and just lost it."

"She keeps shifting, ripping into herself with her claws." Isabella whispered. "As soon as she heals, she does it again. I can't get near enough to sedate her. Putting her in here was all I could do."

"Why didn't you tell me sooner?"

Isabella's eyes shifted to Theodore. "Well, uh, you've been a little preoccupied."

She meant me trying to get Athena pregnant.

"You should have told me! Both of you! Get me a blanket!"

Isabella ran into the hallway and returned with several blankets.

"What are you going to do?"

"Leave me."

"But Alexander....."

"Leave me."

The door closed behind me.

I moved quietly toward Sophia.

Crouching down, I wrapped the blanket around her.

"Hey, it's okay. You're safe."

She continued rocking, seemingly unaware of me.

I grabbed a cloth and began cleaning the blood from her face.

She stilled.

Her hands clutched the blanket tightly.

"I'm a monster." she whispered.

"No." I stated it simply and clearly. "You're a kid thrown into the unknown. Why didn't you leave with the others?"

"I don't want to run."

"But you want to hurt yourself?"

I felt immense gratitude that Athena hadn't taken this path.

Something told me she would have done far more than claw at her skin.

She had a habit of aiming for the heart.

"Death would be better."

"Yours? Or the people who did this to you?"
###Chapter 0113
Alexander.

“Why is this happening to me?” Sophia asks quietly. Her blue eyes are wide as she stares at me. “Why me?”

“As much as I hate to say it, you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

"Right." Her voice is hollow and she blinks back tears.

"We can help you."

“Why do you even care?” I hear the resentment in her question.

“Because my mate was just like you. She wasn’t changed, but she was lied to and made to believe she was something else her entire life. When Athena found out the truth, she called herself a monster too.”

“Right.” She didn't believe me.

“You should spend more time with her. Come stay in the packhouse. Sebastian is there most of the time anyway, especially now his boys have left with their grandparents.”

Her eyebrows knit together, and thankfully the tears have stopped. “You...you won't hurt me?”

I smile, I had no intention of hurting a kid. “No.”

“Can you find out if my family are okay?”

“Of course.”

She sighs. “What will happen to me?”

“What do you mean?”

“You said that I wouldn’t be able to see my family again. You said you were a Wolf even though you look like a Vampire from the tv shows. You said I'm a Lycan, so where do I go?”

“I suggest that you stay here, become a permanent member of the pack. You will be safe, you will be protected. You will have to learn what it's like to live here. We have expectations.”

She nods her head at me, her red hair swaying around her face.

“One of those being that you don't intentionally hurt yourself.”

She hadn't just been covered in claw wounds. Her arms were covered in old scars too. Ones that happened before she was turned. A pink tinge creeps up her cheeks and she nods her head at me.

“Follow me.” I mutter, rising to my feet. She follows me from the blood splattered room, keeping her eyes low.

“Sophia,” I murmur, stopping by my sister and Theodore. “You already know Theodore, but this is my younger sister, Isabella.”

“Are you okay?” Isabella asks.

Sophia nods her head and continues to keep her eyes low and her lips pressed together.

“I’m taking her to the packhouse.”

“Are you sure?” I could hear my sisters concern.

“Yes. Athena is the only one who can give her the advice she needs.”

Isabella doesn't answer, her dark eyes remain on Sophia. She didn’t trust her, not in the slightest. I don't blame her after the Caleb incident.

In the packhouse, I show Sophia around just like I had done with Isabella. Her eyes are like saucers as she takes everything in.

“You are not the only pack?” She asks as we move up the stairs.

“No."

“Are all the main houses like this?"

“I guess so."

“Are you like a millionaire? Like how deep are your pockets?”

I cock an eyebrow at her. She really wasn't afraid of asking questions.

“Right. Too personal, sorry.”

I led her down to the end of the hallway. “This will be your room. I called ahead already, there should be some clothes for you on the bed.”

“Thanks,” she whispers. She gasps as she steps into the bedroom. “This....this is bigger than the ground floor of my home. Thank you.”

“Sure,” I glance back down the hallway, towards my bedroom. Athena was stirring but something wasn’t right. “I just need to go check on Athena, will you be alright?”

Sophia nods her head at me as her eyes dart quickly around the room.

Heading to my bedroom, I find Athena sitting on the edge of the bed.

One hand gripped around one of the posts.

Sweat dripped down her face and I see she is fighting the urge to vomit.

"I don't feel good." she croaks.

"I think I've caught..." she gags and runs to the door where the toilet is.

Pulling her hair back from her face, I gently rub her back, waiting for her to be done.

She sits back against my legs and lets out a tired sigh.

“You are not sick. Besides, we heal from standard illnesses.”

She pauses for a second, taking in my words and slowly tips her head back to look at me. “You're saying...”

‘I am, I scented it this morning when you were still sleeping.”

Her eyebrows raise. “It worked?”

“Are you doubting my abilities?”

“No....my own. Isabella didn't say anything about throwing my guts up!”

Helping her to her feet, I guide her to the large chair by the window. “I’ve moved Sophia into the house.” I hoped it would take her mind off of how bad she was feeling.

“Oh...okay? She didn't leave.”

“No. I went to find Isabella. Her and Theodore had Sophia in one of the rooms at the hospital.”
###Chapter 0114

"Is she all right?"

"No. She shifted." I watch Athena's eyes widen. "Multiple times. She tried to harm herself. This isn't the first incident."

"What are you implying?"

"Her body is covered in scars. Old ones. From before her turning. Her arms and shoulders are marked with thin, silvery lines. She conceals them well, but her past holds more than she reveals. I intend to keep close watch. Perhaps you should spend time with her as well."

"Me?"

"She referred to herself as a monster."

I wait for Athena's response. She only gives a slow, understanding nod.

"She needs guidance. A role model. You could be like an older sister to her. Show her that our existence isn't entirely terrible."

"Not so heartless after all?" she murmurs while I move to fetch her a glass of water.

"Is that your perception?" I raise an eyebrow, handing her the glass.

She doesn't answer. Instead, she presses her lips to the rim. I catch the faint curve at the corners of her mouth, which she struggles to hide as she drinks.

"New arrivals are coming today." I remind her.

"At least I don't have to lie anymore." Her smile is tight, not reaching her eyes.

"No. But you should know—many won't want to be here."

"They're bound by contract?" Athena asks.

"Yes. And they won't hesitate to express their displeasure."

"Right." She sighs. "What exactly do the contracts stipulate?"

"They must protect any heir of mine. At any cost."

"And if they refuse?"

"Do you truly want that answer?"

Wrinkles form on her forehead. She opens her mouth to speak, but the words vanish as she bolts for the toilet. She shoves the glass into my stomach on her way.

I wait until she finishes. When she looks at me, her skin has taken on that same grey pallor from our first meeting. "Nyx suspects something is wrong."

"It's hormonal. I've witnessed it before." The grey tint concerns me, but I won't voice that. "If it eases your mind, we can visit Isabella."

"You're still here?" I mutter to Theodore as we enter the pack hospital.

"Assisting Isabella with the cleanup. Sophia left quite a mess." He flips through a cheap magazine Isabella insisted on buying.

"Where is Isabella?"

"Changing. She'll return shortly. Is everything alright?" His gaze settles on Athena. "You don't look—"

He stops when I shake my head. Before Athena can speak, Isabella bursts into the room.

"Theodore, head to the house. Sophia is in the end room down the hall. Keep an eye on her." I instruct.

"Of course."

"You're pregnant?" Isabella asks the moment Theodore leaves. "You must be. Otherwise, you wouldn't be here. Though I can't detect the changes yet."

"Just examine her."

"I've told you, Alexander. Nothing will appear until she's several weeks along. Even then, it'll be a tiny speck." She turns to Athena with a smile. "All I can advise is to increase your fluid intake if nausea persists."

"This isn't normal for a Wolf." The words slip out, fueled by Titan's urgency. I barely have time to think or push him back.

"She isn't a Wolf." Isabella snaps, crossing her arms. "I can perform a scan, but that's all for now. And I assure you, it will reveal nothing."

She guides Athena to a bed and retrieves a small machine. She moves the wand absently over Athena's abdomen. "Honestly, Alexander, I'm surprised you can detect anything. Most mates don't sense it until at least a month."

She halts abruptly, holding the wand in place. "Huh."

Panic flashes in my mate's eyes. "What does 'huh' mean?" Athena cries out.

Isabella adjusts a setting on the monitor. A heartbeat echoes through the room, followed by a second, distinct beat.

"Athena, you're further along. Approximately six weeks."

"I am?"

"You weren't aware?"

"No."

"What's wrong with the heartbeat?" I demand.

"Nothing. It's exactly what it sounds like when a mother is carrying twins."
###Chapter 0115

Athena

"Twins?"

"Yes." Isabella smiles. "Definitely." She presses the ultrasound wand firmly against my abdomen as I stare at the ceiling.

Alexander's fingers tighten around mine. His happiness radiates through our bond, vibrating against my skin.

Twins? I whisper to Nyx, hoping she understands my terror. I can barely care for myself, let alone two pups.

Look at him! She murmurs.

My gaze shifts to Alexander. He holds the monitor in his free hand while Isabella points out our developing pups. The widest grin spreads across his face, his crimson eyes glowing with pure joy.

He's thrilled. Nyx whispers. We have help.

How? My body has endured too much. I can't be six weeks. I try calculating dates, but everything blurs together since my first cycle.

Nyx remains silent.

Did you know?

No response.

Nyx?

The forest. She finally answers. Our pups develop faster.

Lycans? I'm carrying Lycans? Despite my own nature, I never wanted this connection.

It's too early to confirm. But there's every possibility—

"NO!" I scramble off the bed, yanking my hand from Alexander's grasp. Both Isabella and Alexander stare at me like I've lost my mind.

"Athena?" He reaches for my wrist but I pull away sharply.

"I need space!" My voice comes out harsher than intended as I push past them.

Nyx tries speaking to me.

"Quiet!"

Isabella's dark eyes widen as she glances between me and Alexander.

"Just... give me a moment." I mutter, backing out of the room.

"Athena?" Isabella calls after me. I hear Alexander telling her to let me go. To honor my request.

"Hey, everything alright?" Theodore asks as I burst through the doors onto the grounds.

"I need solitude. And I... thought you were with Sophia?"

"Sebastian's at the house."

"Right." I exhale sharply.

"Is solitude truly what you need?" He offers a gentle smile. "Perhaps you need someone to talk to? Or vent against? Someone who isn't your mate."

I narrow my eyes momentarily. "Have you uncovered more research?"

"About you, specifically?"

I nod.

"I have materials at the house. But I assume you're referring to the pregnancy?"

"You know?"

He shrugs. "It wasn't difficult to deduce. You arrived at the hospital without visible injuries. You merely seemed disoriented and Alexander maintained his composure."

"What do the texts say?"

"Honestly, very little."

I sigh internally, disappointed by the lack of information.

"What does your Lycan say about it?" He probes.

"That the pups develop quicker."

"You're concerned the pup might be Lycan?"

"Worse, that both will be."

He pauses, processing my revelation about twins. His eyes widen with understanding.

"I have Dominic and Victoria hunting me with unknown numbers of Lycans. Alexander will have guests arriving and... and..."

"It's overwhelming?"

I nod, closing my eyes against threatening tears.

"After everything those monsters did to me, they deserve death. But now I might bring more of their kind into this world."

"That frightens you?"

I nod again.

"They'll be raised by you." He offers another small smile. "That means everything."

His words should comfort me, but they only plant more doubt.

Raised by me? It feels like a cruel joke.

I spot Sebastian emerging from the pack house, his hands firmly on Sophia's shoulders. He scans the area briefly before pushing her toward us upon spotting me.

Her eyes remain downcast as they stop before us. I'm too focused on Sophia's butchered hair to hear the men's conversation. She'd taken scissors to it, hacking it unevenly.

Her eyes meet mine. "I couldn't wash the blood out."

I start to offer to fix it—I'd learned to cut my own hair over the years—but Sebastian interrupts to announce Alexander's guests have arrived.

Alexander bursts from the hospital with explosive force. The door slams against the brick wall, making Sophia jump. Her hand grabs mine instantly. I can hear her heart pounding so violently it creates a humming vibration.
###Chapter 0116

“Take her to the house.” Alexander commands.

Every gaze locks onto me, waiting for me to obey and lead Sophia back to the house. But something fierce and defiant flared within me, a raw need to disregard his instructions. I wanted to hear what these visitors truly thought of me. I needed to see the disgust in their eyes. I refused to be hidden away like some shameful secret.

“No.” The word slips from my lips before I can stop it. Alexander simply stares, his expression unreadable. Could he hear my thoughts?

“Sophia, go to the house.”

Her grip on my arm tightens, her nails biting into my skin. She was terrified of being left alone.

“No!” I don’t know where this sudden boldness came from. Surely it wasn't the hormones already?

His crimson eyes darken dangerously. A soft whimper escapes Sophia as she shrinks further behind me.

“If we delay this, they’ll only grow more suspicious. You did.”

“This is different.”

“Is it?”

“It’s too late now anyway.” Theodore murmurs softly.

I look up to see a group of Alexander’s men leading six other Alphas toward us. Julian is at the front, speaking quietly with one of them.

They were all massive, just like the men here. Each radiated a powerful aura. Not as overwhelming as Alexander’s, but potent enough. It makes Sophia tremble. I immediately regret not sending her away. She wasn't ready for this.

“Well Alexander, we’ve arrived!” the first one states. His dark grey eyes find me, and if I weren't fighting the urge to vomit, I’d meet his stare head-on.

“Ethan.” I hear Alexander greet him just as my stomach rebels again.

“Some of us doubted your claim. Especially given how long you’ve been trying for an heir. But now, it’s rather obvious.”

I already despised his tone. There was no friendship here, only a business arrangement. Contracts were the sole reason for their presence.

“Well,” I snap, cutting him off. “Then you’ll be thrilled to hear he’s having twins.”

Definitely the hormones. Nyx muses internally at my bluntness. I catch Julian’s smirk.

“You must be the mate.” Ethan raises an eyebrow at me. I notice the others remain silent. Why was he the only one speaking?

“This is Athena.” Alexander introduces me.

Ethan extends a hand. I don’t take it. He laughs, a deep, grating sound that makes me tense. I feel Sophia flinch. She was probably regretting not leaving the pack with the others when she had the chance.

“Suspicious. A refreshing change.” His tongue flicks over a sharp canine as he studies me.

What did that mean?

“This one hasn’t tried running yet?”

He knew about the others. How long had he known Alexander?

“No. And she won’t.” Alexander replies, his voice firm.

“We shall see.” Ethan smirks directly at me.

“It would be far easier to protect you if you refrain from running off.” He shifts his gaze back to Alexander. “Now, explain the situation. Your message was cryptic. We all have the same question.”

We move into the house, gathering around the large dining table that had gone unused since my arrival. Alexander takes the head seat and mentally directs me to sit at his left. The men settle in. I notice Sophia seize the moment to slip away to her bedroom. Perhaps that was for the best.

Alexander begins to speak. He tells them nearly everything, omitting only the truth of what I am and how they are turning people.

“Why the fuck would you need our help?” Ethan pushes his chair back from the table abruptly. “Your pack is enormous compared to ours.”

Alexander looks at me and gives a slight nod.

‘I’m… I’m not a Wolf.’ The words stumble out.

Every eye in the room instantly focuses on me.

The only blonde-haired man among them, whom Alexander had called Nathan, speaks. “You smell like a Wolf.”

I meet his gaze. “I know.” I whisper.

“What are you?” Ethan demands, his voice sharp.

“The last Lycan Alpha.”
###Chapter 0117
Alexander

Hearing her finally declare her identity was deeply satisfying.
I couldn't tell if her growing confidence came from the pups or if Ethan had simply pushed her too far.
Either way, it no longer mattered.

“A Lycan Alpha?” Nathan questioned, his expression baffled. “What in hell is a Lycan?”
He glanced around at the other men, who looked equally confused.
Except for Ethan.
Ethan’s gaze was locked on my mate.
He watched her with the same predatory hunger Julian once had.
A hunger to consume her entirely.

He can try.’ Titan growled low in my mind.
I remained silent, much to Titan’s irritation.
I wanted to drive Ethan into the ground, but that could wait.

“I am a monster.” A dark smile touched Athena’s lips.
Her eyes had darkened, the blue nearly swallowed by black.
Nyx was hovering close to the surface.

“And you’re running from your pack?” Ethan directed his question at my mate.

“As I’ve already explained, no, she is not.” I cut in sharply.
I had expected more questions about her being a Lycan.

He gave a slow nod. “So you’re the reason humans are turning up with bite marks.”
Ethan rubbed a hand over the stubble on his chin.

“What are you talking about, Ethan?” Nathan asked, frowning.

Before Ethan could answer, my mate snapped. “I am not biting anyone!”

I held a hand up to Athena, turning fully toward Ethan. “You’ve seen this?”

“Yes.”

“You’ve seen them shift?”

“That, I haven’t witnessed. When they started appearing in the city, we handled them before the situation escalated.”

“Your pack is in the city?” Athena asked, sounding confused.

“Next city over. Crestwood City.” Ethan muttered, as if she should have known. “My pack is more urban than you forest dwellers in Obsidian Howl.”

I rolled my eyes. His way wasn't everyone's way.

“When you say you ‘handle’ them, you mean…?” Athena’s voice was quiet.
The black in her eyes receded, blue returning.

“We kill them.”

“You didn’t think to tell me, Ethan?” Nathan snapped at his brother.

“You weren’t anywhere near the situation. You married and took a pack hundreds of miles away. We may be brothers, but we haven’t been close in over a decade.”

My fist slammed onto the table. “Whatever history you two have, set it aside. You all signed a contract with me. I held up my end when you needed me.”
The wood splintered under my hand.
“Now it’s your turn.”

“There’s nothing about Lycans in that contract.” Nathan murmured.

“You’re right, there isn’t. But it does state that you will protect my heirs with your lives if they are threatened.”

“They aren’t even born yet!” Nathan grumbled.

“From the day of conception,” Ethan rolled his eyes at his brother. “We are contractually bound. Or are you prepared to tell your wife you just handed your pack over?” Ethan challenged.

All eyes turned to my mate.
Her head was bowed.
I saw her taking slow, deep breaths, fighting back another wave of nausea.

I don't like how pale she looks.’ Titan warned me.

“Athena, go rest.” I told her firmly.

“I have questions!” Ethan snapped.

“And if all my attention is on my mate, I cannot answer them!”

Athena practically fled the room.
Whether to escape the meeting or to be sick, I wasn’t sure.
But this way, Ethan couldn't keep ogling her.

Every eye in the room was on me.

“Go on, ask!” I challenged, knowing the one question burning on all their tongues.

“What are they?” Nathan asked.

“It’s too early to tell.” I answered casually.

“What if they are like her?” another Alpha asked.

“They are still my heirs.” I knew it was likely.
She was developing faster than any Wolf.
But I also knew the fear of them being Lycans plagued my mate’s thoughts.
She hated the idea.
She wanted the Lycan line to end.

Julian and Sebastian were quiet, listening intently to every word.
Until Julian finally spoke.

“We didn’t call you here to debate the pups' heritage. You are here to uphold your end of the contract. Nothing more.”

“And when this is over, the contract is complete?” Ethan asked. “We are free?”

Their lives won't be worth living if anything happens to our pups!’ Titan snarled.

I was doing this to keep my mate and my heirs safe.

“Yes.” I agreed. “The contract will be completed.”

The Alphas exchanged looks.
Finally, they all nodded in agreement.
They all wanted the same thing—to be free of their debt to me.
###Chapter 0118

“Explain it to me.” Ethan demanded, his gaze fixed on Athena. “You’re the true Alpha of Silver Creek. So why won’t they submit? I can feel your power. It’s immense.”

The allied Alphas had been here two days, and this topic kept resurfacing. Especially with Ethan. He was fascinated by the concept of a female Alpha. He always found a way to linger nearby, asking the same questions, hoping for new answers.

“They don’t believe a female can lead.” Athena replied, her patience thinning.

“Yet they’re desperate to claim you.” He leaned against the wall, studying her. “They’re creating unstable, arrogant pups who can’t control themselves, just to get to you.”

She rested her forehead on the desk, exhausted. “They want me because I can produce more Lycan Alphas for them.”

“The two leading this campaign—the male is her uncle.” I interjected. “The female is his mate. We believe they’re infertile. That’s why they kept Athena alive.”

“So you decided to get her pregnant?” Ethan raised an eyebrow at me.

“I did.”

“That’s reckless. What if they try to keep one of the twins? You must see the flaw in that plan. I know you, Alexander. I know you have one of the best strategists in your pack. Was this his idea or yours?”

“Does it matter? You’re here to protect them.”

“You’re playing a dangerous game. You’re risking all our packs.”

‘Fool.’ Titan growled inwardly. He despised how Athena was being interrogated. He hated that our word wasn’t enough for these Alphas. He was growing desperate to take control.

I straightened, my voice dropping to a warning tone. “It’s the least you can do, Ethan. Especially after what we did for you.”

He caught the threat in my words.

“Are you trying to lure them out? Is that the plan?”

“Yes. Though it’s been quiet since she killed one.”

He glanced at Athena. “She doesn’t look like much. She really killed one?”

“Two.” I said with a faint smile. “She used her claws to rip out the first one’s heart. The second, she pierced its heart.”

I followed his gaze. Athena’s eyes were closed, her cheek resting on my desk. Worry gnawed at me. She hadn’t eaten in days. Even water was hard to keep down. Others had noticed too. I shut down their questions immediately.

I decided to give her a few more hours. If she didn’t improve, I was taking her back to the hospital.

“Insane.” Ethan muttered, for what felt like the hundredth time. “They’d have a better chance if they just accepted their true Alpha.”

“I know. You know. But they think they know better.”

“That’s why they’re dying out.”

Ethan chuckled. “No offense.” He smiled at Athena, then frowned. “Is she asleep? You know that’s not normal, right?”

I checked on her. I moved her from the desk chair to the sofa. She didn’t stir. Completely unconscious.

“You should have her examined.”

“Isabella says it’s normal early pregnancy symptoms.”

“We both know this isn’t normal.” Ethan raised an eyebrow.

“She’s a Lycan. None of us know what’s normal for them. They lied to her her whole life. She doesn’t even know.”

“What about that witch you consult? Maybe she has some insight.”

“Madame Zora? She hasn’t been seen lately. No one has left pack grounds.”

“She’s in my city.”

“What? Why?”

“Long story. I can call her. But we both know she doesn’t come cheap.”

“Call her.”

He pulled a phone from his pocket and held it to his ear. I heard her the moment she answered. “Alpha Ethan?”

“Your presence is requested at Obsidian Howl.”

A pause. A long sigh echoed through the phone before she agreed to come.

“She answers to you?” I asked curiously after he hung up.

“I caught her in a bind.” He smirked. “Let’s just say I learned a thing or two from you over the years.”

He stood and looked at my sleeping mate. His eyes lingered on her a moment too long before turning back to me. “I never thought I’d see the day you found a mate.”

“Neither did I. If anything happens to her…”

He smiled. “Oh, I know. I’ve already made that mistake once. This world will never be the same. It’s better to be on your side than against you.”
###Chapter 0119
Athena

“It’s been nearly four days.” Alexander paces in front of me, his voice low.

“At least the vomiting stopped.” I attempt a smile, but his worried expression doesn’t fade.

“You need to see Isabella. I should’ve taken you last night, after the pack run.”

“I’m fine.” I wasn’t. The constant attention was grating. Everyone watched my every move.

The other Alphas put me on edge. Around them, I either went silent or snapped. No middle ground.

“You might feel fine, but you haven’t eaten.” He pulls me up, hands settling on my hips. His thumbs trace my frame. “You’re losing weight.”

Nyx said the same thing. But I felt okay.

“I’ve gone longer without food. When I was a slave.”

His hands move to my stomach. “You need nourishment. For you and them. You have everything you need here.”

“You should worry about Dominic and Victoria.” I snap. “There’s still no sign of them. The other Alphas are getting restless.”

“Screw them. It’s you I’m worried about.”

“I’m fine.”

“Stop saying that.” His gaze intensifies. “I hear your thoughts, Athena. I smell your distress. But you won’t talk to me. Are you scared they might be Lycans? Or are you starving yourself hoping the pregnancy fails?” He raises a brow.

‘You were supposed to block him!’ I hiss at Nyx.

‘They are my pups too!’ she retorts.

“Well?” Alexander demands.

“It’s… not like that. I…” I bite my lip. “It terrifies me.”

“If they’re Lycans, then that’s their destiny. Madame Zora should arrive today. Maybe she’ll have answers.”

Dread pools in my stomach. The witch who bound me was coming. My stomach growls loudly. Alexander smirks.

“Stop worrying about them. They will be loved. Cared for. No matter what they are.”

He kisses my forehead. “Now go eat. Make my pups happy.”

As I head for the door, he calls out that Theodore will stop by later to check on my reading progress.

Downstairs, I hear Julian in the kitchen explaining mate bonds to someone.

“I’m fifteen!” Sophia shrieks.

I burst into the kitchen. Julian leans against the cabinets, arms crossed, staring at Sophia.

I immediately jump to her defense. I knew Julian’s reputation. No way was I letting him near a fifteen-year-old.

“What’s going on?” I glare at him.

“Want to tell her, or should I?” Julian presses his lips together, annoyed.

“What’s happening?”

Sophia’s eyes are downcast. Her face is bright red.

“Did you try something?” I snap at Julian.

“I like women, but I draw the line at underage ones.” He sighs.

‘They are mated.’ Nyx murmurs as I process his words.

‘And to make it worse, you were human.’ His dark eyes fix on Sophia, not kindly. Sophia runs from the room crying. Julian rolls his eyes.
###Chapter 0120

"How long have you known?"

Silence.

I pressed him again. "How long?"

"Since the day she appeared. She's just a kid. Started following me around a few days ago. I figure her wolf is beginning to settle into her body." His gaze sharpened. "I'm rejecting her. I won't wait until she's eighteen. I could be dead by then."

"That's why you were explaining the bond. Preparing her."

He gave a single nod. "You think I'm an asshole, but I do care about some things. That girl has suffered enough. A rejection might shatter her."

Hearing this side of him was strange. Softer. It proved he wasn't a complete idiot.

"You walked in right as I was about to do it."

"Make sure she has someone with her when you reject her. She'll need the support."

"Fine."

"Alexander!" Ethan's voice echoed through the house. Julian rolled his eyes dramatically. He leaned out the door. "My brother is busy. What do you want?"

"Madame Zora is here."

My spine went rigid. Nyx was already whispering curses inside my mind. She hadn't even met the witch, yet she hated her for binding my powers.

Madame Zora glided in, a small bag in hand. A slow smile spread across her tanned face the moment she saw me.

"How are you feeling, Alpha Athena?"

I hated it. I hated the title from her lips.

Her eyes dropped to my stomach. Her grin widened. "Twins. How wonderful."

"You know?" Ethan frowned at her.

"I see what is necessary." She did a slow turn. "I believe Alpha Alexander wishes to see me."

"He's occupied at the moment," Julian informed her. "You can wait in his office."

"Very well." She turned her attention back to me. "I would enjoy your company."

Julian caught my wrist. "You don't have to if you're uncomfortable."

I stared at the witch. She knew about the twins. Maybe she knew more. "I'm fine," I muttered, pulling my arm free. If she tried anything, I would end her.

The men watched me lead the way to the office. Madame Zora followed too closely. I made a point of sitting in Alexander's chair, behind the desk, facing her and the door. This was my territory now.

"How are you feeling?" she asked, settling herself comfortably.

I ignored her question. "You said you see what's necessary. Where are Dominic and Victoria?"

"Waiting."

"Where?"

"That, I'm afraid, is something I cannot be certain of."

Annoyance flared within me.

"I believe I am here to check on you," she said, studying my face.

"That isn't needed."

"I know. You have it all handled." She smiled faintly. "You know, when I first met you, I knew you were different. A special little pup. Just like the ones growing inside you."

"Are they Lycans?"

She smiled again. "Lycans are a dying breed. Even those who were turned cannot produce Lycan offspring."

"Are they Wolves, like Alexander?"

"Is that what you want, Alpha Athena?"

"I want you to answer my questions."

"As much as I would like to give you the answers you seek, I cannot."

"You mean you won't." I sighed and shook my head. "Why did you even come here?"

"I owe Alpha Ethan. And I wanted one last look at you as the Lycan Alpha."
###Chapter 0121
Alexander

I stepped into a heavy silence.
Athena looked pale and shaken.
She was clutching her stomach tightly.
Tears welled in her eyes.

“What…what does that mean?” she whispered to Madame Zora.

“Exactly as I said.” Madame Zora’s gaze shifted to me. “I cannot provide the answers you seek.”

“Name your price.” I knew her methods well.

She shook her head slowly. “If I accepted payment for this, the answers would be worthless.”

She turned back to Athena. “I regret my role in your upbringing.”

“Twice!” I snapped sharply.

“And I wish I could give you the information you need.” She sighed deeply.

“You said you wanted one last look at me, the Lycan Alpha. Does that mean I’m dying?” Athena demanded.

“Everyone is.” She offered a sad smile.

I shook my head in disbelief. I had known Madame Zora for decades. “Athena, she’s referring to herself.”

“You were always the cleverest Alpha, Alpha Alexander.” Madame Zora winked at me before focusing on my mate. “Yes, he’s correct. Alpha Athena. My time has finally come.”

“Oh.”

“What I can tell you is that your boys will thrive. You simply have a journey ahead.”

“That’s all?” I asked, watching my mate closely.

“That is all I possess.” She rose to her feet. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I wish to enjoy my remaining days.”

She turned to leave, then paused. “One more thing. Your mother experienced the same sickness. For Lycans, it’s common. Likely due to the human essence within. Try ginger biscuits. Your appetite will return soon.”

As she departed, I heard Ethan shouting after her, demanding to know her destination.

“She made it sound like I was dying?” Athena whispered with a frown.

“Madame Zora speaks in riddles. You should have waited for me. I could have interpreted for you.”

“I still don’t understand.” She whispered. “I still don’t know what they are.”

“Perhaps we should take each day as it comes. When you feel them, your perspective will change.”

She nodded, then suddenly looked up. “There’s something I need to tell you.”

“He already did. For once, Julian is actually doing the right thing.”

“It will shatter her.” Athena murmured.

I knew they had spoken, just as I hoped. Sophia had confided in her when Athena fixed her hair.

Athena hadn’t shared details with me.
She said it wasn’t her place to tell.
Sophia had asked for confidentiality.
I respected her choice.

“Just be there for her. Be the person you needed growing up.” I told her.

A sharp knock interrupted us.
Ethan entered without waiting. “What did you say to my witch?”

“First: It’s none of your concern. Second: You don’t own her. Third: You’re in my house. Watch your tone!” I growled.

“I brought her here to help with whatever this is.” He gestured toward my mate. “You wanted answers, and now she’s walked away without looking back. What did you say? Or did she tell you we’re all doomed?”

“She’s dying.” Athena muttered. “She can’t help you anymore.”

“What the hell are you talking about?”

“If you keep speaking to my mate like that, I’ll break your neck!” I snarled. “Madame Zora is dying. She has days left. She doesn’t care about you ‘owning’ her.”
###Chapter 0122

“Once this Lycan mess is over, we’re finished, Alexander. I owe you nothing. I want no part of your pack ever again.”

LYCANS! Sebastian shouts through the mind link.

“They’re here,” I tell Ethan.

He charges out without hesitation, setting aside his issues with me for now.

“Find Sophia,” I tell Athena, guiding her toward the door. “Stay with her. Do not leave the house.” I press my lips to hers and silently beg the Moon Goddess to let me return to my mate alive. None of us truly knew what we were facing.

My pack had formed a defensive wall three rows deep, standing shoulder to shoulder. I could see the Lycans, all shifted, lining the edge of the trees, waiting. It was impossible to tell how many there were.

They didn’t move. They watched us just as we watched them. Everyone listening for the slightest sound.

Was Dominic here? Was Victoria? I had no idea what they looked like in Lycan form.

‘What are they doing?’ Sebastian links me. He stood in the front row, eyes locked on the massive Lycan directly across from him.

‘Scouting. They’re trying to see if this is all we have.’

Faint clapping started somewhere within the trees. One by one, the Lycans joined in, slamming their large clawed hands together. The sound was deafening.

‘Something’s wrong,’ Julian mutters. ‘It’s a distraction.’

We scanned the area. Nothing had changed. My thoughts immediately flew to Sophia. Had I been tricked by a child?

‘Athena? Is Sophia with you?’ I linked her, my heart pounding.

‘She’s hiding in her closet.’

‘Keep her there!’

I scanned the clapping Lycans again. That’s when I noticed them parting, making way for the blonde woman. Victoria was still in human form. As she moved through the crowd, she stepped to the front and raised her hands. The clapping ceased.

“Where is she, Alpha Alexander?” Her voice grated like nails on a chalkboard.

“Not here. Where’s that coward husband of yours?”

“Hiding her in the house, are you?” She smirked. “I suggest you bring her out. This could get very ugly.”

“For who? Not a single one of your creatures made it through. We killed every last one.”

A slow smile spread across her face. “Except one.”

“The one you never should have turned,” I growled.

“Are you certain?” Her eyes closed, and a twisted grin took over. When they reopened, she stared directly at me. “You see, Alpha Alexander, no matter how much little Sophia wants to fight it, she cannot resist the commands of her maker. Athena will have two choices: come willingly, or kill Jessica.”

I already knew what Athena would choose. She would never harm Sophia.

My eyes shut as I heard the packhouse front door open.

“I’m so sorry… I’m so, so sorry.” Sophia couldn’t even look at me. When I refocused on Athena, her eyes were solid black.

‘Don’t shift,’ I linked her. It wouldn’t be safe for her or the pups.

She didn’t respond. She stepped onto the grass, walking calmly beside Sophia. Athena’s expression was cold and detached.

A wall of wolves still stood between Athena and the Lycans. There was no way they were taking her.

The Lycans began cheering as if they’d already won the battle.

“Bring her to me!” Victoria shrieked as Sophia stopped behind Julian.

Sophia’s head snapped up. Her eyes were as black as Athena’s. She held her hand out to my mate. As their fingers intertwined, Sophia growled, “You may be my maker, but you are not my Alpha!”
###Chapter 0123

My heart hammered against my ribs.
Adrenaline surged through my veins, a slow-building inferno.
It ignited something primal deep inside me.
Power thrummed beneath my skin.
And it was all because of Sophia.

I found her trying to hide in a closet.
Her panicked words blurred together as my own fear spiked.
Tears streamed down her face faster than she could wipe them away.

I did what Alexander asked.
I kept her here.
But I couldn't stop myself from glancing out the window.
I had to see.

The Lycans were clapping.
A bizarre, jarring sound.
They slammed their clawed hands together, staring down the Wolves.
This was utterly insane.

'What are they doing?' I asked Nyx.
She just shrugged.

I desperately wanted to link Alexander.
I needed to hear his voice, to understand.
But all I heard was Sophia's muffled sobs from the closet.

I pulled the door open.
I offered her a weak, reassuring smile.
"They aren't here for you, Sophia. They're here for me."

She was curled into a ball, arms wrapped tightly around her knees.
Just like I used to do.
It was strange how we both tried to make ourselves smaller when danger came.

"That woman... Cassandra... the one who brought me here," she stammered. "She wants me to bring you to them."
She refused to meet my gaze.

"Is that why you're hiding?" I asked, fighting to keep my voice calm.
Sophia shook her head.
Then she tapped her temple.
"In here. I hear her. It was a whisper before. Now..." Her soft blue eyes finally lifted to mine. "Now it's a command."

"A command?"
She nodded vigorously. "She keeps saying, 'I am your maker. You will obey me!'"
Control. Of course. That was all Victoria ever wanted.

"Are you going to try and hand me over?" I asked quietly, understanding dawning.
This was why they changed a child.

"I... I don't want to," she whispered.
I sighed. "You can't fight a direct order. Obedience is ingrained in us. We must obey those above us."

Sophia uncurled slightly. "You make me feel like I can fight it. Being near you, I feel safer. If you told me not to, I'd have to listen, right? Because you're the Alpha. My Alpha. You're more powerful than she is."

"Alexander is—"
"No. You are the Lycans' Alpha. If I understand it right, they have to answer to you. Sebastian told me that." She glanced toward the window but squeezed her eyes shut. "Her demands are getting louder. It actually hurts my chest now. That's bad, right?"

"It's because you're resisting her command."
"Can you make it stop?"
Would it work? Alexander mentioned linking them all. But could I do this?
'Only one way to find out,' Nyx murmured.

"I order you not to take me to Victoria."
Sophia threw her arms around me in a sudden, fierce hug. "Thank you."
'I think the kid is onto something,' Nyx mused. 'Let's go take down the whole pack.'
I smiled at Sophia. "I think you might be right. And now, I need your help."

My bare feet touched the cool grass.
Sophia walked slightly behind me, as if presenting me.
She was trying so hard to hold herself together, just like I was.
It wouldn't be for long.
Just long enough to make Victoria believe she had won.

I was desperate to look for Alexander, but I knew I'd break if our eyes met.
I asked Nyx to block him from my mind, just temporarily.
Just until I ended this.

Two words broke through the barrier anyway. "Don't shift."
Shifting was not part of the plan.

Cheers erupted from the Lycans.
If you could call them cheers.
It was a cacophony of roars and howls of satisfaction.
They didn't even have me yet, and they were already celebrating.

As the noise died down, Victoria yelled, "You will bring her to me!"
Sophia stared through the rows of Wolves.
Like me, she was almost too short to see.
Slowly, she reached out and locked her hand with mine.
Her grip was surprisingly strong.

"You may be my maker," she declared, her voice shaking but clear. "But you are not my Alpha."
My heart raced. I could hardly believe her courage.

"You are a stupid little girl!" Victoria shrieked. "You know nothing of our world!"
"I know enough to know who is wrong!" Sophia squeezed my hand tighter, staring straight ahead.
Her eyes darkened, just like Alexander said mine do.
She was close to shifting.

"Bring her to me!" Victoria yelled, stomping her foot in a furious rage.
###Chapter 0124

The Wolves remain still.

But the Lycans inch forward.

They are ready for a fight.

I am ready when you are. Nyx whispers.

I draw a deep breath.

The Lycans creep closer.

If this fails, we are finished.

Drop the block.

My mind floods with whispers.

Lycans' voices blend into a constant hum.

I AM YOUR ALPHA. BRING VICTORIA AND DOMINIC TO ME!

My own tone shocks me. It rings with authority.

The Lycans freeze.

They exchange uncertain glances.

They were fed lies about me.

But if they feel what Sophia felt, they cannot refuse.

NO! Victoria shrieks. You have no power! You are nobody! Dominic, tell them!

Her hands clench into fists.

She is used to getting her way.

Now hundreds of Lycans stare at her. With hostility.

Her eyes show pure shock.

Stupid bitch. Nyx murmurs.

Screams pierce the air.

Victoria's shrill voice makes many cover their ears.

She backs away.

But there is no escape.

Lycans block the trees behind her.

A wall of Wolves stands before her.

DOMINIC! DOMINIC! Help me!

A single black Lycan retreats into the woods.

Large claws seize Victoria.

They ignore her screams.

Bring him to me! I command through the link.

Several Lycans sprint after Dominic.

I glance at Alexander.

He smiles at me.

He waited for this. For me to embrace my destiny.

Lycans turn on each other.

Desperate to deliver the screaming woman to me.

They likely hope for mercy.

They will receive none.

I will not lead traitors.

I reject those who believed Dominic and Victoria so easily.

Sophia's hand remains in mine.

I smile at her.

She is young. That was Victoria's mistake.

She changed a girl like me. A girl content with herself.

The Wolves part.

Two Lycans drag Victoria toward me.

Alexander joins us.

He takes my hand and kisses my cheek.

Then he focuses on Victoria. Well Victoria, how does it feel?

Bastard. You have no idea. Dominic will avenge me if you touch me!

She turns to Sophia. And you! You stupid, foolish girl! I should have let you die!

I pull my hand from Alexander's.

Claws extend from my fingertips.

I drive them into her stomach.

The Lycans release her.

She screams.

Her hands lock around my arm. Trapping my claws.

You destroyed me! I growl.

You made me believe you were special. Then you ruined me. Now I ruin you.

I release Sophia's hand.

My claws lengthen.

I slowly pierce Victoria's skin.

They sink into her kidneys before tearing across her abdomen.

I hate her. She took everything from me.

I look at Alexander.

Evil glints in his eyes.

Kill them all. I whisper.

The two Lycans backing away are attacked by Ethan and others.

Chaos erupts as Alexander orders the attack.

Blood trickles from Victoria's lips.

Her wide, fearful eyes remain fixed on me.

I want to see her bleed. Like she made my parents bleed.

You deserve this. And more. I whisper as my claws retract.

She drops to her knees.

Tears stream down her face.

I have never seen her cry before.

You are a monster! she croaks.

I am what you made me!

My claws plunge into her chest.

They curl around her heart as she chokes.

With one tug, I rip it free.

It beats in my hand for a moment.

Her body sways.

Then collapses to the ground.

I look up.

Ethan stares at me.

His expression is unreadable.
###Chapter 0125
Alexander

Three days passed while the dead burned.
For three days, Dominic remained in my dungeons, still breathing.
For three days, Athena had not spoken a single word about that night.

She sits in her usual chair in my office, quietly nibbling a ginger biscuit.
Madame Zora had been right about them.
They finally settled her stomach enough to eat properly.
Today, instead of curling her legs against her chest, she sits with them crossed beneath her.

Her dark hair curtains her face.
She appears calm, but I have endless questions about the bastard in my cells.

"I can kill him." I mutter without glancing up. "If that's the problem, I'll handle it."

She stays silent.

"Athena, why did you let him live? You killed his mate."

She releases a heavy sigh. "He deserves to suffer. Why couldn't they refuse my command?"

Her question surprises me. I assumed she understood.

"You were their Alpha. That's why they obeyed. It's different with Wolves. As you know, a Blood bond can mean answering to two Alphas. Sometimes Wolves seek refuge in another pack and pledge loyalty to that Alpha. You are the last living Lycan Alpha. They had no other choice. They couldn't disobey."

"Right." she murmurs, reaching for another biscuit.

"The sooner we execute Dominic, the sooner the other Alphas can leave."

She lifts her gaze, frowning.

"They were summoned to protect you and the pups under their contract obligations. Dominic remains alive, meaning the threat persists. They won't depart until it's resolved."

"I'm not ready."

Those were not the words I anticipated.

I study her, unable to read her thoughts. Nyx still blocks me, making it impossible to sense her properly.

"You're not ready?" I ask gently as her frown deepens.

"You'll think I'm insane."

"He's your last connection to Silver Creek. Or more precisely, to your parents." I've been trying to decipher why she keeps him alive, especially since she hasn't even visited him. This was the only logical explanation.

"See? Stupid." she mutters.

"They destroyed you. They beat you, starved you, let the pack abuse you."

"I know!" She snaps sharply.

"You're struggling to release the fantasy of the life you might have had. The life you have here now. Where you are loved. Where you have friends. Where you've gained a sister who adores you."

The corners of her lips lift slightly. "My life is complicated."

"And I wouldn't have met you otherwise. But perhaps it's time to shut the door on your chaotic past and focus on the future. On the pups you're carrying."

She nods slowly. "Will you come with me? I'm still not prepared to face him alone." We descend into the dungeons as Dominic groans, his stomach growling with hunger.

"Look who decided to show up." He sneers, struggling to stand. His hands grip the bars, keeping himself upright. Fading bruises mark his face, and I scent my brother's recent presence.

"Here to throw more punches?" He snarls at me.

Athena remains silent. Her fingers stay tightly interlaced with mine. Her blue eyes are wide as she stares at Dominic. All the confidence she displayed days ago has vanished.

This man instills more fear in her than she ever revealed.

"Cat got your tongue." Dominic mocks her. "You always struggled with words. Stuttering over the simplest things. And now, absolutely nothing."

"Shut your fucking mouth!" I snap. "You hold no power over her."

He smirks. "Her trembling body suggests otherwise."

"You were there!" Athena whispers breathlessly. "You stood in the shadows. You watched me place that lemonade before them. You did nothing as they bled out."

I realize it's not about letting go. She's still searching for answers.

"You're correct." Dominic smirks.

A small crease forms on Athena's forehead as she closes her eyes. "They all knew, didn't they? The chaos, everyone running. They screamed for help, yet no one tried to save them. They all knew, right?"

"Yes."

A single tear escapes her closed eyes. "You planned this for a long time."

"Since the day you were born." Dominic shrugs. "You were meant to produce more Lycans. More carriers of the Alpha blood. They saw something special in you, but I understood what it meant for our kind. There was hope for us."

"So you lied to her." I snap.

"We did what was necessary!"

"Why the contract?" I demand.

"It wasn't a lie. We needed protection. A Wolf pack discovered us and moved to eliminate us. I admit, it was strange seeing him beside you recently. But we never anticipated her being mated to you. A Lycan and a Wolf," He scoffs, "that's unheard of."

"Who? Who already knew about you?"

"I don't know his name. And I don't care either."

"Another trick? Buying more time, Dominic? That only leads to more torture."

"Do what you want. I've accepted my fate."

"Which Alpha are you referring to?" I demand.

"He watches me." Athena interrupts softly. "He wasn't surprised when we told him. The others had questions, but he already knew." Her eyes meet mine. "Ethan."
###Chapter 0126
Athena

It never seemed to end.

One secret after another, spilling out like some twisted game.

The dungeon echoes with choked gasps. I look up to see Alexander, his arms thrust through the bars. His hands are locked around Dominic’s throat. Squeezing until Dominic’s lips start turning blue.

His body convulses. His hands slip from the bars. His mouth opens and closes like a fish out of water. No sound escapes.

His eyes bulge from their sockets as Alexander crushes his windpipe.

‘Now.’ Nyx whispers. ‘Finish him. For good.’

I step forward. My hand stretches through the bars. Long, sharp claws sprout from my fingertips.

My palm presses against his chest. Slowly, my claws pierce his flesh. They slide through skin and muscle with ease. Until they brush against his beating heart.

I pause. Staring into the eyes of the man who caused me so much pain.

He never apologized. Not once. Even now, seconds from death, he stares back. Ignoring the Wolf crushing his throat.

His voice echoes in my mind. ‘Do it. I’ve been waiting. I knew this day would arrive.’

‘What do you mean?’ I murmur through the link.

‘I knew I would die once you found yourself. Once you realized your true power.’

He gurgles as my claws sink deeper. Piercing the edges of his heart.

“Goodbye, Dominic.” I whisper.

My claws plunge into his heart.

I keep them there. Watching the light fade from his eyes. Feeling his heart struggle around my claws. Blood leaks out.

Alexander releases him. Dominic takes a hollow, rasping breath. It sounds like an ancient door creaking open.

I don’t expect him to grab my wrist. Forcing my claws deeper.

His eyes close. More empty gasps escape his throat. Then silence.

His heart stops fighting. His lungs stop demanding air. The only thing holding him up are my claws.

I pull my hand free. His body hits the cement floor with a sickening crack. Blood pools around him instantly.

A single tear escapes my eye. I’ve finally closed the door on my past.

Alexander carries Dominic’s body outside. He dumps it on the grass. Theodore appears with a box of matches and a small can of fuel.

I watch silently as Theodore douses the body. He lights a match. He glances at me for confirmation. I nod.

The flame ignites Dominic the second the match touches him. Huge orange flames race along his body. Drowning out the scent of blood.

Now the air fills with the nauseating smell of burning flesh.

Alexander slips his arms around my waist. He presses his chest against my back as we watch the body burn. “They’re all gone.” he whispers.

I nod. Words escape me.

“You won, Athena.”

“Is… Is Sophia okay?” I ask softly. I want to ask about Ethan, but I’m not ready for that yet.

“She’s inside with Sebastian and Isabella.” Theodore informs me.

I can feel their eyes on me. They expect me to talk about what happened. But there’s nothing to say. I killed them. End of story.

“Has Julian rejected her yet? Is that why they’re with her?”

“It’s more complicated than that.” Theodore shakes his head. “She’s refusing to accept the rejection.”

“Why?” My voice comes out higher than usual.

“What do you mean, she’s refusing?” Alexander demands.

“She flat-out told him she refuses it. She didn’t say no. She said she refuses.”

“Can she do that?” I frown. “I mean, I was still mated to Marcus after he tried to reject me.”

“That’s because you didn’t accept the rejection properly.” Alexander mutters. “I’ve never heard of someone refusing a rejection outright.”

“She could die!” Panic flutters in my chest. We all know what Julian is like. If he sleeps with another female, it will kill her.

“Where’s my brother?” Alexander questions.

“He left.” Theodore avoids his gaze.

“He left? Where the hell did he go?”

Theodore shrugs. “We tried to stop him. He was too angry.”

“At Sophia?”

Theodore shakes his head. “At the Moon Goddess. She’s the one who paired him with Sophia. He’s furious.”

“I need to find Sophia.” I murmur.

They let me go alone. With all the Lycans gone, Alexander isn’t worried about me going anywhere by myself.
###Chapter 0127

Ethan startles me as I enter the packhouse.
He's seated right outside the office door.
He stands immediately when our eyes meet.
His dark grey gaze drops to my blood-stained hand.

“You finished him?” His voice is flat, devoid of emotion.
Yet he watches me with that same intense stare from our first meeting.
This man irritates me just by breathing the same air.

“Yes. He's dead.” My tone is sharp.
I don't understand why he gets under my skin so easily.

“That leaves you as the last one. Well, you and Sophia.”
His eyes linger on my stomach in a way that makes me uncomfortable.
“Do we understand what they are?”

“Alexander's heirs.” I mutter the words.

“You know that's not my question.”

“And yet that's what they are!” My voice rises.
“Unborn members of this pack. Let me ask you something.”

“Go ahead.”

“The bitten ones. The changed. However you label them. How did they reach your city?”

“Same way they reached every other city nearby.”

“How long have you known about Lycans existing?”

He stares silently, pressing his lips together.

“You knew. You knew before they appeared in your streets. When you were informed, you showed no surprise. How long?”

He merely shrugs.

He's a complete asshole! Nyx growls internally.

“You didn't come just for the contract, did you?”

“Partly, yes. I honor my commitments. Though I was intrigued to hear the great Alpha Alexander had finally settled down. My curiosity peaked when I learned your name. Athena Harrison. It's not a name one forgets.” He rises from the chair.

I step back, frowning. “We've never met.”

“But we have. Long ago. You were just an infant, mere months old. I was ten, perhaps eleven. Your parents visited my family's city. They abandoned you there.”

“No. That's a lie.” A growl rumbles deep within me.

“It's truth. I watched them leave you in a basket down some alley. Wrapped tightly in a blanket. Fools made the mistake of stitching your name onto it.” He rolls his eyes and turns away with a sigh.

“I brought you home to my parents. By then, you'd already shifted. Multiple times.” He smirks, checking his reflection. “A strange little monster, but I couldn't leave you there.”

I shake my head. It can't be true. I was bound. I couldn't shift.

“My parents spent a week tracking your family down.”

“You're inventing this.”

His dark grey eyes lock onto mine.

“Silver Creek sits in the middle of nowhere. Isolated from any other civilization. So remote other packs struggle to find it. The house is large, but not like most packhouses. Gardens spread out back.” He describes my childhood home in perfect detail.

My heart hammers against my ribs.

“Your parents claimed you were kidnapped, but you carried no foreign scents. Only theirs. Honestly, they didn't even seem pleased to have you returned. I begged my parents to keep you. They refused. Said you were a powerful being.”

“My parents loved me!”

“Are you certain? Wasn't Dominic raised as your older brother to become the next Alpha? Weren't they the ones who bound you twice before he did it again?” He rubs his jaw. “The impression I got was that no matter what they did, you kept surviving. As if you were meant to. Perhaps to lead you to this exact moment.” He points at my stomach.

“You intended to kill Dominic and Victoria?” I whisper.

“Not until recent years, when the bitten started appearing in my city. Initially we suspected Vampires, but then they began shifting. I recognized what they were. I'd seen it before. And it had to connect to that pack you came from.”

“Two years?”

“Perhaps longer. Their plan was long in motion, Athena. It intensified after you met Alexander. They likely planned to breed you until you died.”

“All the bitten are dead now, aren't they!” I snap.

“Not entirely!”

I notice the unusual quietness of the house. My heart plummets. “Where's Sophia?”

He smiles coldly.

“What the hell have you done to her?”

“She's safe. For now.”
###Chapter 0128
Athena

“Where is she?” My blood runs hot. She can’t be far. Theodore said she was with Sebastian and Isabella. Where are they? He couldn’t have taken them all.

But if he was wounded, he’d be healed by now.

I turn from him. I rush through every room on the ground floor. Ethan follows close behind me. He laughs each time I find an empty room.

“The contract ended the moment Dominic died.” His voice is low behind me.

Just kill him! Nyx urges.

We can’t. We don’t know where Sophia is. He knows that.

“Don’t listen to that beast inside you.” He smirks.

“Sophia is just a child.” I snarl.

“I know. That’s why she’s safe. For now.”

“She is part of this pack!” I snap. “You’re breaking your deal with Alexander.”

“The deal ended when you killed Dominic. Alexander said it himself. The threat is gone. The contract is over. I’m not threatening your pups.”

“So this is revenge? You asked for his help. Is this how you repay him?”

“I did repay him. I helped kill the Lycans for both of you. She’s not in his pack. She’s in yours. Tell your beast to stand down.”

My eyes betray me, turning black as Nyx pushes forward. Shifting now won’t help. Where is Alexander? He must feel my panic.

I close my eyes. What does he want with Sophia?

“It’s about me, isn’t it.” I mutter. “You said you were fascinated by my shift. You can’t have me because of Alexander. So you’re trying with Sophia. It’s disgusting. You’re twenty years older. She’s fifteen. A child.”

He doesn’t know. Nyx whispers. He doesn’t know she has a mate. If he tries anything, it will kill her.

Ethan shrugs. “Do you think age matters to me?”

“What do you want? Pups? Lycan heirs?”

He smiles. I feel sick.

“She can’t give you pups.”

I see Alexander in the window behind Ethan. He puts a finger to his lips. Keep him talking. His voice echoes in my mind.

“The witch told you that?” Ethan asks.

“Yes. We’re a dying breed. I’m the last true Lycan. That’s why only one pack remained. They’re dying out.”

“Yet you carry twins.” He mocks.

“There’s a good chance they’re Wolves.” I snap back. Part of me hopes they are. The thought of bringing more Lycans into this world terrifies me. Everything I learned about myself happened here. In this pack. I can’t raise Lycans without knowing how.

“Maybe. Only time will tell. I need to prepare.”

“By making your own? What’s your plan, Ethan? Attack Alexander for revenge?”

“What’s happening here?” Theodore enters from the back. I get no answers.

“Nothing.” Ethan mutters. “I was just telling Athena I’m leaving.”

I frown. Him leaving now is bad. I need to find Sophia.

“So soon? Don’t you want to stay for Athena’s birthday celebration?”

I hide my surprise. No one mentioned a party. This must be Alexander’s doing.

What is Theodore up to? Nyx murmurs.

“It’s tomorrow.” Theodore continues, avoiding my eyes. “After everything, we need a celebration. Alexander wants a party. A joint event. Athena’s birthday and victory in the war.”

“A party?” Ethan raises a brow.

Theodore nods. “Interested? You helped take down many Lycans.”

Ethan’s eyes narrow at me. “Sure. It’s been a while since I celebrated.”

“Great.” Theodore smiles. “Where’s your brother? I need to ask him too. Making a list.”

“He left earlier. Heading home to his wife.”

“I see.” Theodore mutters. “That’s a shame. More drinks for us.” He laughs. It sounds forced.

His brother has her. Nyx tells me.

They live hundreds of miles away. I panic.

“I thought you traveled together. Since you live that way.” Theodore presses. He thinks the same as me.

“I had things to settle. I wanted a written letter from Alexander. Confirming the contract is over. I don’t need him finding loopholes.”

“He said it’s over. Multiple times.” I mutter.

“Still. Best to have it in writing.”

Ethan smirks at me. He’s too dumb to see Theodore digging for info. “I’ll stay for the party. It could be fun.”

He turns and leaves.

“Aren’t you going after him?” I whisper to Theodore.

“No. Alexander is already on it.”

I look at the window. He’s gone.
###Chapter 0129

“What about Isabella and Sebastian?”

“We located them. They were unconscious in the pantry. They’re both okay, just heavily sedated.”

“But Sophia…”

“We’ll find her. Everyone knows how much she means to you.” He offered a smile, but it didn’t reach his deep green eyes. He was worried, too. He just wouldn’t say it out loud.

‘Someone should inform Julian.’ Nyx murmured.

‘He doesn’t want her. That’s probably for the best.’ I replied.

‘He is still her mate.’

‘Do you think he’ll go after her?’

‘If we tell him, we might finally learn how he truly feels about being mated to her.’

‘She’s just a kid,’ I muttered.

‘I know. So why do you think he really left?’

‘Because she refused his rejection.’

She shook her head. ‘Guess again,’ Nyx said, a hint of amusement in her tone.

‘To wait until she turns eighteen?’

She nodded. ‘She blocked his rejection. He can’t force it without risking her life. Creating distance was the simplest solution. He’s waiting for her to come of age.’

“Talking to Nyx?” Theodore asked.

I nodded.

“Alexander will find Sophia,” he said, trying to reassure me.

“I hope so. Can you do something for me?”

“Of course.”

“Mind-link Julian. Tell him what happened.”

“But he wanted to reject her—” He stopped when he saw my expression. “You have a theory?”

“Please, just link him.”

He gave a curt nod. His eyes glazed over, signaling he was deep in conversation. I watched his face shift through a spectrum of emotions before he refocused on me. “He’s on his way to meet Alexander. It seems Alexander had the same idea. He already told him.”

“We need to alert the pack to keep watch on Ethan,” I said to Sebastian, pacing relentlessly in front of the office window.

Since regaining consciousness, he had remained with me in the office along with Isabella and Theodore. My restlessness was growing.

Sebastian shook his head. “I understand your concern, but Alexander doesn’t want to draw attention to him. It might push him to flee. As far as the pack is aware, Ethan is here for the party. Nothing more.”

“But Sophia—”

“I know. But you must stay calm,” Sebastian said firmly. “If he suspects anything, it could ruin the entire plan.”

Isabella took my hands in hers. “Sophia is like a little sister to you. If I were missing, my brother would be acting just like you are. He’d want to organize a search party immediately.”

“He actually had to do that once,” Sebastian muttered. Isabella shot him a sharp look.

“So I get it,” Isabella continued. “Ethan told you himself she’s safe for now. Alexander and Julian know what they’re doing. They’ll bring her back soon. Right now, you need to stay calm. Protect those nephews of mine.”

“Boys?” Theodore asked, curiosity piqued.

“We’re not certain, but Madame Zora suggested they’re boys,” I told him.

“Like I said,” Isabella smiled gently. “Try to stay calm. Stress isn’t good for you or for them.”

“We also need to maintain normalcy,” Sebastian advised. “Hiding in this office will only attract suspicion. You should stay with one of us. We can keep you updated on Sophia, and it gives you a valid reason to be with each of us.”

“I’m fine on my own.”

He locked eyes with me. “Alexander’s orders.”

“He’s right,” Theodore added. “You can continue your tutoring sessions with me. Spend time with Isabella because of the pregnancy. Sebastian is your designated guard when Alexander isn’t around.”

I nodded silently.

Hours dragged by with no news. Sitting in the hospital with Isabella made me restless. I needed to be doing something, not just waiting.

“Here,” Isabella said, sliding a pack of ginger biscuits toward me. “Alexander had these placed all over the pack grounds for you. Just in case.”

“I’m not hungry.”

“No, but you look like you’re about to be sick.”

I’d felt off for a while. Something was wrong, but I couldn’t pinpoint it.

Rubbing my eyes, I sighed and took the biscuits. “Any news?”

She shook her head. “He’s fine. You’d know if something was wrong. We all would.”

“I thought it was over,” I mumbled. “When I killed Victoria and Dominic, and the other Lycans were eliminated… I thought it was finished. But there’s always something.”

“Unfortunately, that’s part of being a Wolf. Or in your case, a Lycan. Trouble finds us no matter where we are. It’s why Alexander has worked so hard to build our pack the way he has. To minimize the chaos.”

“And I’ve brought more of it,” I groaned.

“Alexander knew what he was getting into. Out of all the women he tried to bond with, none came close to what he shares with you. He could have killed you the moment he discovered the truth about you. But he didn’t. He isn’t concerned about what the pups might be. He’s just happy to be a father.” She smiled warmly. “You make him happy.”

I returned her smile, but a sharp, sudden pain pierced my heart. At the same moment, the color drained from Isabella’s face.

Alexander was in trouble.
###Chapter 0130
Alexander

“Damn it! Alexander, can you hear me? Wake the hell up!” My brother’s voice cuts through the fog in my mind. He sounds panicked, distant.

“ALEXANDER!”

“Shut the fuck up!” My eyes snap open. I’m hanging upside down. Blood trickles down my arms and face. I struggle to process the scene.

‘What the hell happened?’ Titan’s voice echoes in my head, groggy.

I ignore him, focusing on my surroundings.

The car is overturned, roof crushed against the ground. The windshield is completely shattered. Shards of glass lie beneath my head. A searing pain shoots through my chest, making each breath a struggle. The sharp scent of gasoline fills the air. This car could explode any second.

“Shit!” Julian mutters. He’s fighting against the dashboard pinning him down. He pushes it back slowly, inch by inch, using all his strength. If we were human, we’d be dead already.

I reach for the seatbelt release. Then I feel it. A large piece of glass lodged deep in my chest, dangerously close to my heart. It might have already pierced the organ keeping me alive. I never imagined I’d die like this.

“Julian, look at me.”

“Hold on, I’m almost free.”

“Julian.”

He stops fighting the dashboard and turns to me. The cuts on his face from the glass are already healing. His eyes widen in horror when he sees the glass protruding from my chest. The same terrifying thought flashes through his mind.

“No… no, no, no, this isn’t happening. You’re going to be a father! You can’t leave Athena. She needs you. We all need you.”

“Julian, you know the pack already senses something’s wrong. That’s why you didn’t want to look at me—you felt my distress. Athena will feel it too.”

‘Alexander!’ Isabella’s voice screams through the mind link. ‘What happened?’

‘Car accident,’ I reply, half-chuckling despite the pain. ‘Some idiot came out of nowhere.’

‘But you’re okay, right? Please tell me you’re okay!’

I glance at the glass in my chest. Julian uses one foot to kick the dashboard off his other leg.

‘Promise me you’ll protect Athena,’ I murmur through the link. ‘If I die, promise me you won’t abandon her.’

‘No.’ She begins to cry. ‘She’s carrying your children.’

‘Until they’re old enough, I need you and Sebastian to help her lead the pack.’

Julian presses his hands against my chest. The fear in his eyes is unmistakable.

He carefully unbuckles the seatbelt holding me upside down. He catches me before my body shifts too much and dislodges the glass. Slowly, he drags me out of the wreckage, pulling me across the road just as the car erupts into a massive fireball.

“Go!” I gasp. “The human cops will be here soon.”

“I’m not leaving you.” Julian rips my shirt open, applying pressure around the wound with all his strength. “It might not have hit your heart.”

‘If it did and you remove it, I die.’

‘If I don’t, you’ll die anyway from blood loss and failed healing. What about Athena? What about the twins? You know Ethan will take her if you’re gone! You know she’ll never be the same if she loses you.’

I turn my head and spit out the blood filling my throat. I try to link Athena, but Nyx has blocked her off.

“Are you trying to piss off a dying man?”

“You’re not dying.” He wraps something around the glass and yanks it out, tossing it aside. He presses his hands firmly against the wound. His eyes glaze over.

“Who are you linking?” I cough up more blood.

“My sister. If anyone can help, it’s her!”

Sirens wail in the distance. No one had passed us or stopped, meaning someone else alerted them. The other car that hit us is long gone.

“You have to go!” I snap.

“Not a chance. I made the mistake of following your orders before.” He prods at my wound and smiles. “It missed your heart.”

“Are you sure?”

“Isabella said you’d be dead by now if it had. And you’re healing. The cuts on your face are already gone.”

I look down. The wound is knitting itself together. A thick pink line forms, gradually thinning until it looks like I was never injured.
###Chapter 0131

“You’re not going to like what I have to say.” He muttered, avoiding my gaze.

“Athena ran?”

“Sebastian and a few others are searching for her. They’re trying to find her before Ethan does.”

I sat up coughing, the sound of sirens growing louder.

“We need to leave.” I said as he helped me stand.

“You want to go home? What about Sophia?”

I shook my head. “We just need to go. I can’t deal with humans right now. I need somewhere to think.”

We moved quickly. When I glanced down, the wound had vanished completely, as if it never existed. Relief washed over me. Death had never frightened me before. But now it wasn’t just about me. I had a mate. And twins on the way.

We found an abandoned house and collapsed on the dusty floor.

“I hate humans.” I muttered.

“That guy who hit us?” Julian asked quietly.

“Who else?”

“It wasn’t a human.” Julian murmured. “You were knocked out. The driver stopped, got out, and looked in at us. Then he laughed and drove off.”

“You’re saying it was a Wolf?”

He nodded. “Whose territory are we in?”

“It’s neutral ground.” I closed my eyes and tried linking Athena again.

“Are you sure?”

“I know every pack from here to Nathan’s territory. This is neutral.”

“I think you might be wrong.”

When I looked at him, he was staring past me.

I turned. A large black shadow crouched at the top of the stairs. Beady eyes fixed on us. It slowly rose to its full height, moving into the light. A Lycan.

It growled, drool dripping from bared teeth.

“Another fucking one!” Julian snapped. I glared at him.

‘I thought we killed them all.’ Titan muttered. ‘How did one escape?’

I focused on the Lycan. “We’re looking for someone. A girl with red hair. She’s like you. Taken from her home. From her family.”

It growled again.

“My mate is a female Lycan Alpha.” I tried, hoping for some reaction.

It moved away from the stairs, disappearing around the corner. Minutes later, a blonde female took its place.

“A young girl?” The blonde asked.

“She’s fifteen.”

“Why are you looking for her? You’re Wolves.”

“Like I said, my mate is a Lycan Alpha. The girl is like a little sister to her.”

“I had one of those once.” Her brown eyes remained fixed on me.

“I’m sorry.”

She snorted, folding her arms.

“Did you kill her?” Julian asked.

Her face hardened. She pulled her collar aside, revealing a bite mark on her collarbone, just like Sophia’s. “What do you think?!”

“How long ago were you bitten?” I asked.

“Why does it matter, Wolf?!”

Titan laughed. Normally I would have too. But maybe we could use her help.

“We were attacked back in my pack. The ones leading it had bitten humans. Changed them forever.”

She leaped the entire staircase, landing inches from me. “Was her name Victoria?”

“Yes.”

She smiled. “I can’t wait to kill her.”

“You’re too late. His mate killed her.” Julian muttered.

The blonde frowned, then smiled. It made her look dangerous. As she smiled, I noticed an old scar above her lip.

“Good.” she muttered.

“You got away?” I asked. I wanted to know how she’d survived without a pack.

She rolled her eyes as if it were obvious. Turning away, she headed back toward the stairs. “I haven’t seen the girl you described.”

“Please,” Julian muttered.

The blonde looked back at him. “You care for her?”

He didn’t answer, but I saw it in his eyes.

“The man who had her kidnapped isn’t a good man.”

“Who is?!” she snarled.

“They want her to produce pups.”

Her eyes narrowed to slits. “Didn’t you say she’s fifteen?”

“Yes.”

She sucked in her cheeks, staring at us. “I’ll help you, Wolf. But I want something in return.”

“What?”

“Money.”

“Seriously?” Julian interrupted. “She’s one of you.”

“I named my price. Take it or leave it!”

“Deal.” I muttered, holding out my blood-covered hand.

She shook it. “You can call me Brianna.”
###Chapter 0132

Trigger Warning- Talks of miscarriage

Athena

I ran.

My feet moved on their own.

The pack's voices echoed behind me.

They called out promises.

They said they could help.

They said Alexander would be fine.

He wasn't.

I felt it.

The pain intensified.

It clawed at my heart with every step.

'What's the plan?' Nyx's voice was tense.

I have to find him!

Tears threatened to fall.

'Athena, he left hours ago. We can't find him on foot.'

I have to try.

I burst through the final line of trees.

The boundary lay before me.

I had never crossed it alone.

The old panic returned.

The fear of the snow.

The fear of the unknown.

"ATHENA, STOP!" Sebastian's shout came from behind.

I turned.

He moved carefully through the trees.

His eyes were downcast.

His frown was deep.

The pain shifted.

It moved from my heart.

It sank deep into my abdomen.

"You're lying." A single tear escaped.

It traced a path down my cheek.

"I feel it." My hand pressed against my chest. "He's gone, isn't he?"

'Something's wrong.' Nyx's murmur was laced with fear.

"Alexander is alive." Sebastian's voice was firm. "You were right, he wasn't. There was a car accident. Glass impaled him. It missed his heart. Julian saved him." He took a slow step toward me. "I swear it, Athena. Our Alpha lives. But right now, you need a hospital."

"For Alexander?" My voice was a whisper.

"No. For you."

"I need to see him."

"I know. But he's miles away. You are the priority."

The pain spread.

It shot into my hips.

It burned down my thighs.

That's when I smelled it.

The metallic scent of blood.

My eyes dropped to the ground.

Spots of red stained the grass.

Drops marked the fallen leaves.

A trail led right to me.

"Let me help." Sebastian held out his hand.

He caught me as my knees buckled.

He swept me into his arms.

He ran.

The forest blurred around us.

Pain radiated through my core.

"Am I losing them?"

Sebastian didn't answer.

I felt Nyx pacing in my mind.

Her worry mirrored my own.

'I killed my pups, didn't I?' I whispered to him.

He held me tighter.

He pulled me close to his chest.

Just like Alexander would.

My tears fell freely.

Sebastian crashed through the hospital doors.

"In here!" Isabella's voice was sharp.

He laid me on the bed.

Isabella immediately lifted my top.

She ran a scanner over my stomach.

"Well?" Sebastian demanded.

"Two heartbeats." Isabella's tone was focused. "Two strong heartbeats."

"Then why is she bleeding?" he pressed.

"If I knew, I wouldn't be running tests, would I!"

"Are they really okay?" I asked, too afraid to look at the screen.

She offered a small smile. "They seem perfect."

More tests followed.

No cause for the bleeding was found.

She ordered bed rest for several days.

She promised to recheck me then.

"I can't. Sophia is missing. Alexander is hurt. I still have Ethan to deal with. And that ridiculous party tomorrow?"

"Not a fan of parties?" Isabella tried to lighten the mood.

I glared.

She knew I'd never been to one.

"Just take it easy until then. If the pain worsens, tell me immediately. I'll be at your side during the party. If anything happens, I'm there."

"What's wrong with Sebastian?" I nodded toward the door.

He paced outside.

His arms were crossed tightly.

His eyes were distant.

He was linking someone.

"He's updating Alexander." Isabella gave a weak smile.

"He said he was okay?"

"Oh, he is... Maybe Sebastian should explain. He's my brother's Beta. He'll have more details."

"Tell me."

"Not my place." She turned away.

Sebastian reentered.

His smile was strained.

It didn't reach his eyes.

"Alexander's okay?"

"He's fine. They found a safe place to recover." His gaze flicked to Isabella, who suddenly found the wall fascinating.

"And?"

"They found another Lycan."

"Another?"

"She says she was turned years ago. One of the first."

"Did they kill her?" I already knew the answer.

"No. She's going to help them."

"Help?"

"It seems this Brianna was also bitten by Victoria."

"Brianna?" A cold dread washed over me.

My body began to tremble.

It couldn't be her.

"No. No, no. You heard the name wrong."

"Athena, what is it?" Isabella asked.

"I know her."

"How? That's not possible. They're miles away." Sebastian frowned.

"She was at Silver Creek. Not for long. A few months."

"A slave?" Isabella questioned.

I shook my head. "She was their pet."

"Brianna?" Sebastian sank into the chair by my bed.

"She appeared one day. Victoria brought her to the house. She was all smiles and laughter. Then, after a few days, something changed. A darkness took over her." I paused. It reminded me of myself. The girl who became happy to rip out hearts.

"What do you mean?" Isabella's voice was soft.

"She joined them."

"You mean she hurt you?" Sebastian leaned forward.

I nodded.

The memory was brutal.

It was just before my final binding.

"She grabbed my shoulders. She smashed my head into the concrete basement wall. Over and over. Blood sprayed the walls. The floor. I lost consciousness. I never saw her again after that."

Sebastian and Isabella exchanged a long look.

"Surely it's not the same one?" Sebastian muttered to her.

"How long ago?" Isabella asked.

"When I was seventeen. Almost eighteen."

"Five years. It can't be her."

Sebastian sighed. "What did she look like? I can have Alexander confirm."

"Blonde. Brown eyes. A scar." I touched my face. "Right above her lip."

"I'll be right back." Sebastian strode out.

"Alexander can handle himself." Isabella gave a weak smile. "If it is her, people change. Five years is a long time."

"Or she's filled with so much rage she'll kill him the first chance she gets."
###Chapter 0133
Alexander

Are you completely certain she's alright? I mind-link Sebastian.

Isabella has examined her thoroughly. The twins are unharmed. Your sister believes it's stress-induced and has ordered complete bed rest. Athena believed you were dying. She didn't even realize she was bleeding until I located her. I still don't understand what she was thinking when she fled.

She wasn't thinking. Her only thought was reaching me. I respond silently. Keep her protected. We will monitor this Brianna situation.

You're allowing her to live?

Currently, she might be our only lead to finding Sophia.

Will you return tonight?

I'll try. No promises. If I don't, you know the protocol.

Of course. Alexander, be careful around that woman. She sounds completely unhinged. Everyone is tense.

I still couldn't believe we encountered another one of my mate's past tormentors. We were hundreds of miles from home. In a completely different territory.

I glance at my brother dozing nearby. We agreed to alternate watching our Lycan housemate.

Finished communicating with your pack? Brianna asks from the staircase.

Just checking on my mate. I had mentioned my mate was a female Alpha. Did she know I meant Athena? She must.

I think she knows. Titan grumbles.

Is she alright? She sounds genuine. But she might be practiced at faking concern.

Resting. I offer a brief smile. I would share minimal details for now.

A long conversation for someone who is resting. Her brown eyes fix on me.

She's suspicious. Titan mutters.

I would be too in her position. I tell him.

I give Brianna a reassuring look. I also checked in with my Beta. Leading a pack doesn't pause just because I'm absent.

She nods slowly.

Do you live alone? I ask, surveying the dilapidated house.

Brianna raises an eyebrow. She puffs her cheeks, considering her response.

Mostly.

My brother mentioned another during the crash. Are there more of you?

We're playing with fire. Titan warns.

A few. Brianna states.

All bitten?

She nods and stands. Probably Zachary that crashed into you. He dislikes Wolves. Honestly, he dislikes everyone.

This is neutral territory.

Her eyes lock on mine as she descends the final steps. You all say that. Everyone passing through says that. No Alpha here doesn't make it neutral.

Her temper flares as she approaches. Wolves think they know everything.

You're right. My error. Have you claimed it?

We did! We made it safe for our kind.

I only learned of your kind this year. I say, attempting to divert her.

Because of your mate?

I nod.

And she's a female Alpha?

Yes. I couldn't lie after already telling her.

She stares directly into my eyes. The girl in the basement. Her harsh expression softens. She's alive?

I remain silent under her gaze.

I thought I killed her. Is she... truly alive? You must tell me!

Yes.

Brianna steps back. She leans against the wall, a faint smile forming. She's really alive?

Yes. I repeat.

She sighs deeply. You know what I did, don't you?

I've been told.

By the basement girl? Your mate?

Yes.

Then you don't know everything.

She slides down the wall, landing heavily on the floor. She scowls and picks at a hole in her worn jeans. I was told she was a thief. That they were holding her prisoner until deciding her fate.

She snorts bitterly. And I was foolish enough to believe them. I'd seen her a few times before. Always working in the house. I thought she was hired help. I didn't even know her name. Then I was bitten.

She runs hands through her dirty blonde hair, sighing. They put her in the basement the day before I was bitten. Told me she stole family heirlooms. I was stupid enough to believe it. Stupid enough to trust Victoria.

She shakes her head, leaning back against the wall. When that bitch bit me, something took over. I was so angry. I couldn't control it. I couldn't bury it deep like I usually did.

She sent me down into that basement. Told me to have fun. They said the female needed punishment.

A single tear escapes, tracing down her cheek. She wipes it away quickly, pretending it never happened. Her screams still haunt me.
###Chapter 0134

“What did you do to her?” Julian demands.

I hadn’t even realized he was awake. I wondered how much he had heard.

“She begged me. Tried to convince me the people upstairs were deceiving me. Claimed it was her home. That her parents owned the house.” She paused, voice dropping. “Only looking back do I understand—I didn’t see how sick she was. How frail. The shadows under her eyes. All I saw was the ‘liar’ Victoria had warned me about. And I believed every word.”

Brianna lowered her head. “She didn’t fight back. She was too weak.”

Listening to her was horrifying. It also revealed how much Athena had kept from me about her past. Or perhaps it was a memory she had forced herself to forget.

“Even now, I still hear the sound—her skull cracking against the wall.”

“You shifted?” Julian asked.

“No.” She shook her head. “I was just furious. And suddenly, I had the strength of a Lycan.” Her eyes locked on me. “Is she truly alive? You’re not lying to make me talk?”

“She’s alive.”

“But how? She shouldn’t have survived that.”

“The Moon Goddess wills it,” I murmured.

“How did you know she was an Alpha?” Julian pressed.

“I overheard them talking. I didn’t know what ‘Alpha’ meant. Not until I escaped. Not until I met others.”

“Victoria kicked you out after?” Julian continued, skeptical.

“No. I was so disgusted with myself, I ran. I didn’t stop until her voice—Victoria’s demands—faded from my mind.”

“What about the others?” Julian’s tone was doubtful. “If you were the first, how are there more in this area?”

“We found each other. Or rather, they found me.”

That’s bullshit! Titan snapped.

“Were they all bitten by Victoria?” I asked.

She nodded. “For someone who rarely shifted, she loved creating us.” She glanced toward the broken window. “The sun’s rising. We should get ready to move.”

Brianna headed upstairs. She didn’t seem worried about leaving us alone. Maybe there was truth in her story after all.

I don’t buy it. Julian’s voice echoed in my head. She’s playing the victim card. I don’t trust her.

You don’t have to. She said she’d help us find Sophia. All she wants is money. I can provide that.

Julian frowned. I thought you’d want her dead after what she confessed.

I do. But that won’t help us find your mate, will it?

“Don’t call her that!” he snapped.

Brianna reappeared, eyeing us suspiciously. “What are you arguing about?”

“Sophia,” I muttered.

She nodded slowly, but her eyes narrowed. “Right.” Her tone made it clear she didn’t believe us.

She dragged a heavy bag down the stairs. It thumped loudly with each step.

“What’s in there?” Julian asked.

“Weapons.” Her gaze shifted to me. “Where do you think they took this girl?”

“Somewhere called Shadow Peaks.”

She laughed. “Shadow Peaks? You packs need better naming skills. But I know the place.”

“What do you call yourselves? The ones who got away?”

“Rogues. And we are not a pack.”

“Rogues?” Julian repeated.

“We don’t belong. And we don’t want to.” She spat the words out.

“But you’ll help us?”

“As long as you don’t do anything stupid.” She smirked.

She led us almost a mile from the house to a beat-up car. Tossing her bag into the back, she ordered, “Get in!”

Brianna slid into the driver’s seat, gripping the wheel tightly.

“We don’t have all day!” she snapped. “The sun’s up. Don’t you want to find your mate?”

“Get in,” I told Julian.

He took the back. I sat up front beside her.

She hit the gas, driving like the road was hers alone.

“Will you chill? We don’t need cops chasing us!” I warned.

She grinned, eyes on the road. “No police out here.”

“Stop the car!” Julian shouted after thirty minutes.

“But we need to—” Brianna began.

“I can smell her.”

She pulled over. Julian burst out, scanning the area.

“Tire tracks,” he muttered, crouching down.

“That could be anyone’s,” Brianna said.

He inhaled deeply. “She got out. She ran!”

Julian stared at the cornfield ahead. He moved toward the fence, plucking a stem.

“What is it?”

“Dried blood,” he growled.
###Chapter 0135
Alexander

Julian begins scaling the wooden fence.
I seize his shoulder. "Wait. We have no idea what's inside."
"Does it matter? She needs help. I can track her."
"Alexander is right." Brianna whispers. "You don't know what else is in there."
'What is she talking about?' Titan questions.
"Rogue Lycans?" Julian laughs. "I've killed plenty. A few more won't change anything."
Brianna meets my gaze. "I wasn't completely honest earlier. When you asked how many, I said a few."
"Is this about that Zachary guy you keep bringing up?"
"No." Her eyes scan the cornfield nervously.
"They hide here, is that what you're saying?"
"It's worse than that! Look around, Alexander. There aren't many places to hide out here. But you should know some stay in Lycan form permanently. Like they've lost their humanity." She glances around. "How many humans have you seen since coming to this town? And no police anywhere."
"They killed the humans?"
"They feast on them."
'Disgusting!' Titan gags.
"That's why Zachary tried to eliminate us?"
She nods, her dirty blonde hair framing her face. "Zachary contains the Rogues here. He brings them bad people. Criminals. Child abusers. That sort."
"How many are there?" Julian asks, still staring into the corn.
"A dozen."
"Zachary's the only one like you?" I ask. "The only one who can still shift forms?"
She confirms with a nod.
"Screw this!" Julian charges into the cornfield.
"Don't!" Brianna grabs my arm. "You have a mate to return to. I can't be responsible for her getting hurt again."
"Julian is my brother!" I pull my arm free. "And Sophia is her family."
Rushing into the corn, I realize I'm practically blind. The tall stalks block everything. Wherever Julian went, the corn has already sprung back. I'll have to rely entirely on my nose. And that's the problem. Lycans don't have a scent when they shift.
Brianna appears beside me. "I'll help."
We move forward slowly, following Julian's scent.
After minutes, Brianna stops me. A new scent hits me. One I've never encountered before.
"Zachary, I know you're watching! Show yourself." Brianna demands.
The corn moves nearby. Dark eyes appear, though the stalks hide most of his face. He was taller than me.
"You shouldn't be here, Brianna." His deep voice rumbles.
Brianna crosses her arms, rolling her eyes. "Have you seen a red-haired girl? She's being chased by a Wolf."
"You know I see everything."
"She's one of us, Zachary. Victoria turned her."
He steps through the corn toward us. I understand why he was chosen to be turned. He's enormous.
'Enormous is putting it mildly.' Titan observes.
"Then why are Wolves after her?" Zachary demands.
"It's complicated." I mutter.
His dark eyes lock on mine, his lip twitching. "Interesting eye color for a Wolf."
I ignore his comment. "One Wolf kidnapped her as a favor. The other is her mate trying to save her."
"Right. A Wolf mated to a turned Lycan. Now I've heard everything." He shakes his head dismissively.
"It's true." Brianna says. She frowns. "Remember why I ended up here?"
Zachary nods but keeps eye contact with me. "What does that have to do with anything?"
"She's alive and sees the redhead as a sister."
"You told me you killed her, Brianna."
"I thought I did, but she... survived. Helping her sister is the least I can do to make amends."
I glance at Brianna and see more emotion than ever. The guilt. The sadness over her actions. The years of living with what she'd done.
"Why isn't she here herself?" Zachary asks.
"She's on bed rest." I stop myself from saying more.
Zachary narrows his eyes but doesn't press further. "You're lucky. The Rogues are sleeping a few fields over."
He leads us through the corn to where Nathan and Julian lie bound, gagged, and unconscious.
"Where's Sophia?" I ask.
"Sophia, you can come out." Zachary calls, standing over the unconscious men.
Seconds later, she bursts through the corn and locks her arms around my waist. "I thought I'd never see you again!"
"Which one is the kidnapper?" Zachary asks me.
###Chapter 0136

I gesture toward Nathan.

Zachary moves swiftly, yanking him upright from the ground. His teeth sink deep into Nathan’s throat, tearing it out effortlessly. He tosses the body aside like trash, spitting out the flesh. “The Rogues will collect him later.”

Zachary’s gaze lands on Sophia, who’s clinging to me. “Victoria turned someone this young?”

I nod. “Old enough to shift, though.”

“She deserved a bullet.”

“She’s already dead,” I reply.

“You killed her?”

“No. My mate. She ripped her heart out.”

He lets out a dark chuckle. “Smart woman.”

“She’s the Alpha,” Sophia whispers against my chest.

Zachary’s head snaps up, eyes scanning the cornfield. “You need to go. They’ve caught the scent of blood.” His attention shifts to Brianna. “Take them to the house. I’ll meet you.” He presses a kiss to her forehead before vanishing into the stalks.

“Sophia, go with Brianna. I’ve got Julian.”

I haul my brother over my shoulder. Zachary must have hit him hard to keep him unconscious this long.

By the time we reach the car, he’s starting to stir. “Sophia,” he slurs.

“She’s safe. You’ll see her soon,” I mutter just as he passes out again.

“Hurry!” Brianna shouts. “If they pick up your scent, I can’t hold them back.”

The car peels away the second I shut the door. Instead of turning back, Brianna drives farther north.

“He said take us to the house!” I snap.

“I heard him. He didn’t mean that dump you were hiding in.”

Sophia twists in her seat to look at me. Her blue eyes are wide with fear. “He kidnapped me! Alpha Nathan took me!”

“I know. I’m sorry. We were so focused on protecting Athena… I never thought you’d be targeted.”

“Why me? I didn’t do anything.”

“He took you for his brother.”

“Alpha Ethan?”

I nod.

Her gaze falls on Julian. “He really came for me?”

“Yes.”

“I’m still not accepting his rejection.”

“Then don’t. Maybe it’s time he learns he can’t always have his way. But these past two days showed me something—he does care. And he’ll wait.”

A small smile touches her lips. She turns back around, settling into her seat.

Brianna pulls up to a neat, well-kept house—nothing like the last place. Flower boxes line the windowsills. A white picket fence borders the garden.

“This is where you actually live?”

“The other spot was a base. This is home. Just because I’m a beast doesn’t mean I can’t appreciate nice things. Make yourselves comfortable. I need a shower.”

Sophia beelines for the fridge, muttering about starvation. I dump Julian on the sofa. His bruises have healed, but he’s still out.

The front door swings open. Zachary strides inside. He laughs when he sees Julian. “He needs to learn to take a hit. Where’s Brianna?”

“Shower,” Sophia mumbles through a mouthful of food.

“Right.” He shrugs off his jacket, revealing intricate tattoos crawling up his neck. “The Rogues know you’re here.” He sits across from me. “Once he wakes, you’re leaving.”

His eyes dart toward the stairs. He lowers his voice. “Take Brianna with you.”

“She doesn’t want that. She doesn’t want pack life.”

“He’s right!” Brianna descends the stairs, fresh clothes on, blonde hair tied back. “This is my home. And I’m not leaving without you, Zachary.”

“I have to stay. Keep the other Rogues in line. You don’t belong here anymore.”

“This is my home!” Rage flashes in her eyes, but it softens under his steady gaze. “They’re getting restless, aren’t they?”

He nods grimly. “Food is scarce. That one wolf won’t feed them all. They’re turning on each other. Three died last week.”

“Really?” Brianna whispers, sinking onto the couch. “Why didn’t you tell me?”

“Didn’t want to worry you. They’re close to turning on us.”

“You’re going to kill them?” I ask.

Zachary nods. “It has to be done.”

“This was supposed to be their safe haven. After what she did to us,” Brianna says bitterly.

“It was, once.” He moves to her side. “Go with the Wolf. See the female Lycan. Apologize. If I survive, I’ll find you. If not, you’ll need help stopping the Rogues.”
###Chapter 0137
Athena

“Are you absolutely certain I can’t assist with anything?” I ask Isabella, my voice tight with frustration. “Sitting here idle is driving me insane.”

“No. You need to remain exactly where you are. Sebastian has everything under control.” She hands me a glass of orange juice and settles onto the bed beside me. “Any word from Alexander?”

I shake my head slowly. This was the longest stretch of time we had gone without speaking. It felt profoundly strange. I knew he was safe now. I could sense it through our bond, but that knowledge did nothing to quiet my restless thoughts.

‘I’m positive everything is fine. Who knows? He might even make it back for the celebration.” Isabella offers the words with a hopeful tone.

“Sebastian already said that’s highly improbable. And we still have no strategy for dealing with Ethan.”

“Stop worrying about that. Sebastian and Theodore will handle it.”

I groan softly, taking a sip of the juice just as a sharp knock echoes from the door.

“Enter!” Isabella calls out.

Sebastian steps into the room, his gaze lowered. “Alexander is on his way back.”

“He found Sophia?” I blurt out, thrusting the glass toward Isabella.

“Yes. She is unharmed. She is secure.”

“Why does it feel like you’re withholding information, Sebastian?” Isabella fixes him with an intense stare. “I’ve known you my whole life. I can always tell when there’s more you aren’t saying. Julian is fine, Alexander is fine, and you just confirmed Sophia is safe. So what is it?”

His eyes shift to me. “You must remain calm.”

Isabella scrambles off the bed and shoves him hard in the arm. “Are you serious? You should know by now that telling a woman to stay calm has the exact opposite effect!”

He releases a heavy sigh. “Alexander is bringing Brianna here.”

My heart seemed to freeze solid in my chest. “Why… Why would he do that? You told him. You told him what she did to me. You said he verified it was the same woman. That she bore the same scar.”

“Athena, breathe!” Isabella urges as I slide from the bed and begin to pace the room.

“He’s bringing her here?!” My voice cracks, threatening tears.

Let me think! Nyx snaps, her agitation mirroring my own. ‘Perhaps… perhaps he is bringing her here so we can end her.’

“Athena, talk to me.” Isabella pleads.

Maybe he wants you to have closure.’ Nyx suggests.

A wave of nausea washed over me. Since hearing that name, the memory of what she had done had unlocked completely. Now, just like the bloody images of my parents, it replayed on a relentless loop in my mind. The searing pain, the sickening crack of my skull, my desperate pleas fading into nothingness before the darkness consumed me.

“Athena!” Isabella calls my name again, more forcefully.

“She cannot come here.” I whisper, my voice trembling.

“Okay. But please, get back into bed.” She turns her furious glare back to Sebastian. “Why in the goddess’s name would he bring her here?”

“He said he would explain everything upon his arrival.”

“I don’t understand.” I mutter, moving numbly as Isabella guides me. “He always swore he would kill anyone who ever hurt me. And now… he’s bringing her here. To my home. I’m pregnant!”

“And that is precisely why you need to rest. We will handle this.” She grinds her teeth, her eyes burning into Sebastian. “Won’t we!”

“Without question, you and the heirs are our top priority.” Sebastian states firmly.

I feel my stomach lurch violently. I knew what was coming and barely managed to stumble into the adjoining bathroom.

“Just go and keep watch on Ethan.” Isabella snaps at Sebastian as she follows to rub my back.

“This is a joke, right?” I gasp out when she helps me back to the bed.

“Alexander always has his reasons. I’m certain he wouldn’t do anything that would intentionally endanger you. Focus on the positives. Sophia is safe. Alexander and Julian are bringing her home. No matter what has been thrown at you, you have always found a way to rise above it. If you have to kill her, then kill her.”

“You’re right. I need to keep my pups safe.”

She nods and turns on the television. “Now, can we please watch this film I’ve been telling you about?”

“Why are we still proceeding with this?” I mutter as Isabella carefully walks with me toward the training grounds.

Music had been blaring for most of the afternoon. The entire pack already seemed to be in a festive mood, even though the celebration wasn't scheduled to start until sunset.

“As I’ve said, the pack needs this. It was Alexander’s idea. It kept Ethan here a little longer and it gave my brothers the chance to locate Sophia.”

And bring that bitch here.’ Nyx growls low in my mind.

“Ladies!” Ethan’s voice comes from behind us. Did he hear Isabella? “How are you feeling, Athena?”

“Exhausted.” I reply flatly. He was still playing the charming guest.

“It must be difficult carrying twin Lycans.”

“We don’t yet know if they are Lycans!” Isabella tells him sharply.

“Right. Yes, Athena did mention that. Out of curiosity, when will you find out?”

“Not for several months.” Isabella declares.

His dark grey eyes linger on me. “Several months is a considerable amount of time.”

“There is nothing I can do to change that!” I snap at him. Knowing what he had planned for Sophia made my blood boil. But his excessive interest was solely focused on the twins. More specifically, my unborn children.

“Hey, there you are!” Theodore jogs toward us. “Happy Birthday.”

“I was under the impression this was a celebration for winning the war.” Ethan states.

“It is, but we also celebrate our pack leader’s birthday. It’s a joint celebration.” Theodore informs him.

“No one mentioned it was your birthday.” Ethan grins at me. “Happy birthday, Athena.”

“It’s not an occasion I typically celebrate.” I mutter.

He watches me intently as Isabella and Theodore converse. He doesn’t utter another word, and a cold shiver traces its way down my spine. Sophia was a distraction. It was the twins he truly wanted. I could feel it deep in my bones. That was the real reason he was still here.

“Come on, Ethan.” Theodore calls out. “Come tell me about Crestwood city. I’ve always been curious what it was like for your kind. Do you still conduct pack runs?”

I release a breath I didn’t realize I was holding as Ethan follows Theodore, answering his rapid-fire questions.

“His brother is dead, correct?” I ask Isabella quietly.

“That’s what Alexander told Sebastian.”

“He hasn’t said a word about it. Not a single word. He would feel it, right? He would know his brother was killed.”

“Possibly. The bond is different when they belong to separate packs. There’s a chance he felt something. But there’s an equally strong chance he felt nothing at all. Why?”

“I believe it was a setup.” My eyes dart around to ensure we are alone. “He hasn’t mentioned his brother once. And his questions… He is utterly desperate to know if the twins are Lycans.”
###Chapter 0138
Athena

Isabella persuades me to remain at the party.
She somehow gets me to sit still and do nothing.
To let Alexander and Theodore watch Ethan while I relaxed.

I couldn’t relax.
Not even a little.
Staying calm was the last thing on my mind.

“I should just end him now!” I whisper for what feels like the hundredth time. “Just get it over with.”

‘I agree!’ Nyx murmurs inside me.

“Shifting won’t help your situation. You said it yourself—you feel pain right before shifting. And if you were a Wolf, you wouldn’t be able to shift anyway! Think of the babies.”

“I am thinking of them!” I snap back.

“I know you want him gone. Honestly, I do too. But just do this for me, okay? Let the men handle it.”

“If something happens—”

“Nothing will happen! There are too many people here. It would be suicide.”

‘I don’t think Ethan cares about that.’

My instincts screamed at me, and so did Nyx.
She hated sitting here, doing nothing.
She hated waiting when she knew we could end him in seconds and be done with it.

“Besides, what do you think his pack will do when they find out you killed him?” Isabella whisper-shouts.

“I…I don’t know.”

“Exactly. We don’t need another war. At least not yet.”

I glance toward the bar.
Ethan is seated there.
Alexander and Theodore flank him as he downs drink after drink.

“He’s going to be too drunk to do anything anyway!” Isabella says with a smile.

After a few more rounds, Ethan leaves his seat.
The other two stay at the bar, avoiding suspicion as Ethan stumbles toward the dance floor.

He lasts about three seconds there.
The moment he sees me, he wobbles in my direction.
A wide, sloppy grin spreads across his face.

“Athena.” His words slur as he stops before me. “Care to dance?”

“Resting!” I mutter.

“Ah,” he smiles, placing his hands on my stomach.
I want to vomit.
Who does that?
“The pups. One little spin won’t hurt them!”

“She’s on rest. Doctor’s orders,” Isabella says, standing.

“Pfft!” He grabs me and yanks me into the air.
He holds me against him, just high enough that my feet can’t touch the ground.

“Let her go!” Isabella snaps.

He glares at her and spins me away. “We need to talk.”

Each twirl makes me nauseous.
With my feet off the floor, I can’t break free from his iron grip.

He presses my stomach against his.
His arms coil around me.
His face comes dangerously close to mine.

“I think you’re lying to me about your precious Alpha.” The slurring vanishes completely.
It’s as if I hadn’t watched him drink nonstop.
He spins us again, moving me toward a dark corner.
I see Alexander and Theodore heading my way.
If Ethan tries anything, they’ll be too far to save me.
They need to move faster.

“Please put me down,” I say, digging my nails into his arms.

“Not until you tell me where your mate is.” His dark grey eyes narrow as he waits.

He leans in close.
His foul breath fans my face.
“You see, I know, Athena. I know my brother didn’t make it home. I know Sophia didn’t either. So I’ll ask one more time—where is your mate?”

“I already told you, he’s working in the city,” I whisper.

He spins faster, impossibly so.
His hands slide to my lower back and dig into my skin.

“Don’t lie to me, Athena. I know he killed my brother. I know it’s your birthday—he wouldn’t miss that unless something serious happened.”

“I’m not lying.”

“Spoken like a true liar,” he murmurs, smiling coldly. “Takes one to know one.”

“Let her go, Ethan.” Sebastian appears beside us, halting Ethan’s spinning.
###Chapter 0139

“Tell me where he is!” Ethan demanded sharply.

Alexander’s distinct woody scent filled the air just as he spoke. “I’m right here. And I suggest you release my mate.”

Hearing his voice sent overwhelming relief through me. He was home.

Ethan dropped me instantly, whirling to face Alexander. Julian stood tall beside him, along with Sophia. And then there was Brianna—the girl who had nearly beaten me to death.

“You murdered my brother!” Ethan shrieked.

“No, I didn’t,” Alexander replied calmly, shrugging.

“I felt him die! Don’t lie to me.”

“Yet it wasn’t me. It was a Lycan.” Alexander’s tone remained steady, though I sensed his irritation.

“Don’t bullshit me!” Ethan yelled, grabbing me and yanking me back against him. His hand closed around my throat, squeezing tightly.

I stared at Alexander, struggling for air.

The music cut off abruptly. All eyes were on us.

“It wasn’t Alexander,” Brianna said, stepping forward with her hands raised. “There are Lycans who crave flesh. It was them.”

“Bullshit!” Ethan tightened his grip. “They’re all dead.”

“Do you really believe that? I understand Dark Ridge was your brother’s pack, correct? Just before that territory, there’s a town claimed by Rogue Lycans. Your brother passed through with one of our kind as his prisoner.” She gestured toward Sophia. “He was never leaving that town alive.”

Her brown eyes locked on mine as Ethan’s hold restricted my breathing. My vision began to darken. She was the last person I wanted to see.

“So you killed him?” Ethan growled.

“No.”

‘Nyx,’ I whispered inwardly, gasping for air.

‘What about the pups?’ she whispered back.

‘There will be no pups if I’m dead. Just the claws.’

Excruciating pain tore through my body. I felt my claws extending from my fingertips as Brianna continued speaking.

Reaching behind me, I drove my claws deep into Ethan’s stomach.

He cried out in pain, releasing my throat immediately.

My feet hit the ground. I tried to run but stumbled, falling face-first into the dirt.

‘GET UP!’ Nyx screamed inside my head.

I couldn’t move.

‘ATHENA, GET THE FUCK UP NOW!’ she yelled again.

Shouts erupted around me. Warm hands slipped under my shoulders, helping me to my feet.

Brianna’s face came back into view.

“I know,” she muttered. “I’m the last person you expected to see.”

I was speechless. I had rehearsed this conversation countless times since learning she was coming. So much anger. So many words. Yet now, staring at her, nothing came out.

All my confidence vanished.

“You need to move,” Brianna urged.

“I’ll take it from here.” Isabella appeared at my side, looping her arm through mine and glaring at Brianna.

“I was only trying to help!” Brianna frowned.

“Let’s go,” Isabella said, steering me away from the crowd and the woman who had almost killed me once.

“Ethan,” I muttered once we were away from the party.

“Alexander is handling it,” Isabella snapped. She seemed annoyed, but not about the attack. Something else was bothering her.

She began inspecting my neck, though we both knew it had already healed.

“Are you okay?” I asked softly.

“Yes!” she snapped again, avoiding my gaze. “You shouldn’t have shifted.”

“It was just my claws,” I grumbled. Studying her face, I knew something was wrong. “What’s going on?”

She sighed, turning her back to me. “This is going to sound insane.”

“Insane like a pack man targeting my twins?”

“The woman with Alexander…”

“Brianna?” I spat the name.

She nodded. “She carries someone else’s scent.”

“Okay.”

“My mate’s.”

“Gabriel?” I asked, confused.

She shook her head, frowning deeply. “My new mate.”
###Chapter 0140
Athena

“What do you mean, Isabella?” I mumble as she pulls me inside.

She shakes her head, avoiding my eyes. “It’s not her scent. It’s on her. Someone she’s been close to.”

“Another Lycan?”

“I can’t tell. There’s no way to know for sure. When you first arrived, you smelled like a wolf too. But you had that strange scent from the binding. She mentioned Rogues? What if it’s one of them?”

I just shrug. I have no idea what a Rogue even is.

“I never thought… not after Gabriel.” Her eyes hold a trace of sadness.

“You loved him.”

“Part of me still does.” She lets out a soft sigh. “He was everything to me. And he threw it all away because of my brother. Because of my pack.”

“Are you worried this new mate won’t measure up?” I’m grateful for the change of subject, even if it’s brief.

“I don’t know. All I know is he’ll have to be pretty incredible for me to even think about accepting him.”

“I’d trade problems with you.” I offer a weak smile.

“Your problems are mine.” She nudges my shoulder gently. “And one of them is coming right now.”

Through the open door, we see Brianna walking toward us. Her hands are stuffed in her jeans pockets. A deep frown marks her face.

Who does she think she is, being angry? She’s lucky we let her live.

She stops just outside. Her eyes lock on me. “Can we talk?”

The nerve! Nyx snarls inwardly.

“I have nothing to say to you.” My tone leaves no room for discussion.

She nods, a faint smile touching her lips. “You don’t stutter anymore.”

I narrow my eyes. “Why are you here? Why did my brother bring you?”

“He was asked to.”

“By who?” Isabella demands.

“My best friend. Look, I didn’t want to come. I wanted to stay in my town. But the Rogues are getting out of hand. Zachary says they’re turning feral. Impossible to control.”

Isabella’s dark gaze flicks to me before returning to Brianna. “And where is this Zachary?”

“He stayed behind. He’s trying to eliminate the Rogues. He said if he succeeds, he’ll meet me here.”

“This mate of yours… is he Lycan too?”

“He’s not my mate. But yes, he was bitten like the rest of us.” She shows us the mark on her skin. “Well, almost like all of us.” Her brown eyes settle on me, and she takes a step closer. “I think you might be the only purebred left.”

“That’s close enough.” Isabella holds up a hand, stepping between us.

“I still can’t believe you’re alive.” Brianna shakes her blonde hair loose. “You should be dead. I thought I killed you.”

“Is that why you came? To finish what you started?” Isabella snaps.

“No. Of course not.”

“Then why didn’t you lead with an apology?” Isabella’s voice is sharp.

“Can anyone even apologize for something like that?” Brianna frowns. “It’s unforgivable. Words wouldn’t mean anything. I know if our roles were reversed, Athena wouldn’t be apologizing to me.”

No, Nyx murmurs. We would’ve made sure the job was done.

“You need to leave!” Isabella orders.

“I haven’t killed anyone since that day.” Brianna mumbles, ignoring Isabella. “I couldn’t. I only shift to scare people. To make them back off. I make threats, but I rarely follow through. That day changed me.”

“And that’s supposed to make me feel sorry for you?” I snap.

“No, that’s not what I’m saying. They used me too. Victoria did. She fed me lies about you. Lies I believed because I thought she was amazing. I wanted to make her happy. I wanted her to think I was worthy.”

“By hurting someone defenseless? What the hell is wrong with you?” Isabella growls.

She shrugs. “Everything.”

Brianna’s eyes shift between us. “I helped him find Sophia.”

“I can’t listen to this.” I whisper to Isabella.

She nods and tells me to go rest.

I leave them talking and head upstairs. Dominic and Victoria are dead. I thought I was done with people from my past.

I was drifting in and out of sleep when Alexander appeared. He carried the stench of blood.

“Is Ethan dead?” I murmur drowsily.

“Not yet.” He leans over and presses his lips to mine. “We’re having some fun first.”

He pulls away, and moments later the shower starts. I wait until he’s inside before sitting up. “Why did you bring her here?”

He pauses, looking at me through the glass door. “I was asked to bring her.”
###Chapter 0141

“By this Zachary guy?”

“Yes.”

“After what she did to me?”

“What she did was horrendous, I am not disputing that. And I am thankful that she didn’t kill you. But just like you are haunted by your parents death, she is haunted by what she did to you.”

“Good!” I lie back and glare at the ceiling. “She deserves to be haunted.”

He stays silent and finishes his shower while I simmer in the quiet. Soon, he slips into bed and pulls me close. “I am not asking you to forgive her. I am not asking you to become friends with her.”

“I don’t understand why she is here.” I whisper, holding back tears.

“She didn't have to help me find Sophia, but she did anyway. Without her, Sophia might not be here.”

“That doesn't answer my question.”

His hands settle on my stomach as he sighs. "I don’t have an answer right now. Or at least nothing that will make you feel better.”

I sit up and stare at him. “You always have an answer.”

He says nothing. In the dim light, I watch his chest rise and fall. This wasn't like him. He always had answers. His silence unnerved me as much as Brianna's presence.

At the breakfast table, I bury my face in my hands. I felt awful.

“Come on.” Theodore speaks gently. “You’re almost done.” He points to the book before me.

“Sorry,” I mumble.

“Alexander mentioned you weren't feeling well this morning.” He offers a kind smile.

“No one warned me about this part of pregnancy. And I'm so sick of ginger biscuits!”

He chuckles and taps the book again. “Try to focus.”

I read a few lines and look up. “Has he said anything to you?”

“About Brianna? No.”

“But he's with her right now.” I glance toward the window.

“He said he’s giving her a tour.”

“Why?”

“I didn’t get to ask. But I assume it’s so she knows her way around.”

“Do you think he’s mated to her? Is that why he’s so welcoming?”

“What?!” Theodore chokes on his drink, spilling it across the table and my book.

“It's just... I was mated to Marcus and Alexander at the same time. He could have another mate.”

“That explains why you look exhausted. Were you up all night worrying about that?”

I avoid his gaze.

“Athena, I don’t know if it’s your hormones or you’re genuinely overthinking, but there’s no way. Alexander is honest. You know how long he searched for you.” He shuts the book. “Let’s go for a walk.”

‘I’m supposed to be resting.”

“What good is rest if you’re just lying there stressing?”

Stepping into the warm morning sun, I spot Alexander standing alone. His arms are crossed as he watches the pack.

“You should be in bed if you’re not studying!” He grumbles as we approach.

“Where's Brianna?” I demand, and he raises a brow.

“Getting settled in her temporary quarters.” His crimson eyes shift to Theodore. "Give us a moment?”

Theodore says he’ll catch up later and winks as he leaves.

I take a deep breath and ask the question that haunted me all night. “Is there something between you two?”

‘I've been waiting for you to ask since I read your thoughts last night.” He smiles, trying to ease the tension.

“And?”

“No.” He pulls me into his arms. “You are my only mate. You are the one I love. You are the one carrying my children.”

“Then help me understand because I feel like I’m going crazy!” I fight back tears.

“I think she can help you.”

I open my mouth to respond, but only shake my head in confusion.

“Athena, if you’re carrying Lycans, we need someone with more experience. It’s new to you, new to most of us here. She’s not the person she was. But she’s lived as one much longer than you have.”

Images flash in my mind. Her hands gripping my face, her thumbs inches from my eyes as she slammed my head back repeatedly. Pain shoots through my skull as if it’s happening now.

“The others who hurt you kept hurting you. She left because she couldn’t live with what she did, and she’s carried that guilt ever since.”

“She told me the same thing.” I mutter.

“You don’t believe her, or you choose not to?”
###Chapter 0142

Shit, shit, shit, shit.

My feet pace relentlessly along the sterile hospital corridor. The usual silence amplifies my frantic thoughts.

‘Would you just calm down?’ My Wolf, Midnight, rolls her eyes internally.

I’m mated to a Lycan! How am I supposed to stay calm about that?’

Athena is a Lycan.’

She’s different. I actually like her. This guy… he’s friends with Brianna. That’s a major red flag. And look at the others in his group—they’re all complete jerks! We’re stuck right in the middle of some twisted Moon Goddess scheme!”

Midnight laughs at my panic. I rarely let my inner turmoil show. Thankfully, Midnight’s composure always masks my anxiety.

‘We could talk to her?’ Midnight suggests.

Brianna? We can’t do that. It would seem like we’re betraying Athena. I made it very clear to Brianna that she isn’t welcome here.’

It might be the only way to meet our second chance mate.’

What if he’s nothing like Gabriel? What if he’s horrible? What if he despises us?”

We’ll face that when it happens. The hospital is quiet as always. Go find her!’

Stepping outside, I spot Athena and my brother engaged in a heated argument. Alexander should know better. Athena is supposed to be resting.

She’s definitely grown more confident since the pregnancy.’ Midnight observes.

Hormones and past trauma.’ I mutter in response. ‘I just hope Alexander is ready for it to get worse.”

Hey?”

Sebastian startles me. I really need to stop zoning out during internal conversations with Midnight.

“Hey Sebastian, what’s up?”

“Have you seen Theodore?”

“No. He was tutoring Athena, so…” I gesture toward the arguing couple, “I assume he went home.”

“Sure.”

“Have you seen Brianna?”

He raises an eyebrow. “She was near her house earlier.”

“Her house?”

He nods. “Alexander arranged it for her.”

That surprises me. Bringing her here after what she did to Athena was unlike him.

Sebastian walks with me to show me the house. He leaves me standing a few meters away as he goes to find Theodore.

Three times I approach the door to knock.

Three times I turn around and nearly walk away.

Just as I prepare for a fourth attempt, she yanks the door open forcefully and glares at me.

“What?” She scowls. “I’ve been watching you through the window since you arrived. You made it perfectly clear you don’t want me here. So what do you want? Did you come to insult me? Call me every name imaginable?”

I could no longer smell his scent on her. She had clearly showered, washing his scent away.

“The guy. The scent that was on you. Have you heard from him?”

“Now it makes sense.” She smirks. “The questions about him. You’re mated to him. You smelled him on me, and that’s why you’re here.”

“Apparently!” I huff.

“Last I heard, yes. He’s still alive.”

“He was killing the Lycans?”

Brianna nods. “The Rogues. Do you want to come in? I’m cooking and don’t want it to burn.”

My dark eyes scan the area for observers. I didn’t want Athena to think I’m betraying her. I just needed information about my mate.

“Sure.”

I follow her inside, and she gestures toward the small kitchen table.

“Zachary is my best friend.” Brianna tells me. “We found each other a few months after he was turned. By then, I’d been a Lycan for almost a year. A very lonely year.”

“He was bitten too?”

“By the same bitch that bit me!” Brianna pours me a coffee and slides it across the table.
###Chapter 0143

"Zachary is a decent man. He carries darkness within him, just like all of us Lycans. It's almost amusing how it seems we could only become Lycans if we had traumatic pasts." She offers a half-smile. "Messed up, isn't it?"

"You truly believe that?"

"I saw the girl's arms. What's her name again? Sophia? Kids don't cut themselves like that without some serious trauma happening."

"What about you?"

"I witnessed my father stabbing my mother repeatedly in a frenzied rage. After I attacked your friend, all I could see was my father in myself. I had become exactly like him. That's precisely what Victoria wanted, what she hoped to achieve."

She runs fingers through her blonde hair. "Victoria never selected normal, happy individuals. She always targeted people with deep issues. Those who would commit the most cruel acts."

My stomach dropped. What was Zachary's past? Why had she chosen him?

"And Zachary?" I asked, almost afraid of the answer.

"It's something he never discusses."

"Never?"

"Never. I'm sorry, that's not the answer you wanted."

I stood to leave and glanced back at her. "You should tell Alexander and Athena what you just told me."

She snorted. "You think that would make Athena view me differently?"

"She has a dark past too. The only difference is she's a pure blood. The last living one. She struggles to trust people after her history was built on lies."

'Well that was unexpected!' Midnight commented as we walked toward the pack house.

Athena and Alexander were no longer arguing outside and were probably making up when she should be resting, but Julian sat out front. Perhaps he could offer some advice.

"What were you doing at Brianna's?" he asked as I dropped into the seat beside him.

"I'm mated to a Lycan too."

I didn't need to look at him to know he was staring.

"Brianna? I didn't think you were into girls?"

"No, not Brianna. Some guy called Zachary. His scent was all over her. You met him, right?"

He nodded.

"And?"

'I don't know what you want me to say, Sis. He's tall, maybe taller than Alexander. Covered in tattoos. A bit abrupt, but he seems to care about Brianna. Are you sure you're mated to him? I could have sworn those two were together."

"Yes."

"Then I feel sorry for you. To know about your mate but never get to meet him."

"Thanks for the vote of confidence!" I snapped. "How's Sophia?"

He glared back at me.

"Don't pretend you don't care about her. The moment you heard she was missing, you went after her."

"She's okay, locked herself in her bedroom. Do you think the Moon Goddess is playing some joke on us?"

"On you, maybe." I laughed.

"It's weird, right? All three of us being mated to Lycans?" He continued, ignoring my comment.

"The funny thing is, I said the same thing to Athena. If Sophia and Zachary had never been turned, we would never have been mated to them. Does that mean we were destined to be mateless forever? Were we always meant to be mated to Lycans?"

Julian shrugged. "You know me, I would have been perfectly happy without a mate."

I rolled my eyes at my brother. "How you're still alive is beyond me!"

He rose to his feet, patting my back. "Love you too, sis!"

Julian strolled off, leaving me sitting alone. Sometimes I envied my twin's carefree attitude. Rarely did anything bother him. Even when he got kicked out, he took it all in stride.

I sat watching the pack move around for some time. They were completely oblivious to my presence. I was fairly certain that if Alexander wasn't my brother, they probably wouldn't even know I existed.
###Chapter 0144
Alexander

Athena rests curled in my arms, her cheek pressed against my chest.
My fingers trace slow patterns down her spine.
The air still carries the scent of our lovemaking.

No matter how fiercely we argued, she always yielded when I focused on the mark on her neck.
Her mind goes quiet for a precious moment.
It felt like an eternity since her thoughts weren't racing at lightning speed.
Overthinking.
Overanalyzing.

I feel her eyelashes brush my skin as her arms tighten around me.
For a second, I believed she had drifted to sleep.

"When will you execute Ethan?" she whispers softly.

"Soon. He'll face trial after we finish extracting information."

My hand drifts down to her stomach, where a gentle curve is already visible.
Her slim frame makes the pregnancy more apparent.

She tilts her head back and kisses me, guiding my hand to cup her warmth.
Her kiss deepens as my finger slips between her folds, feeling how ready she still is.

I press my thumb against her clit, and her hips jerk against my hand.
A low moan escapes her as my fingers move faster.

Her back arches just as a knock echoes through the door.
Athena lets out a startled gasp and freezes, yanking the blankets up around us.

I keep my hand in place, slowing my movements to tease her.
She glares at me as I call out that I'm occupied.

She tries to remain still, terrified of being discovered.
Soft moans escape her as I push two fingers inside her roughly.
Her hips move against my hand as she grabs my wrist, trying to stop me.
She shakes her head frantically.

"Alexander, there's a man here. Claims he knows you!" a deep voice announces from behind the door while I watch my mate fight her climax.

"Did he give a name?" I respond while kneading her hardened nipples.

"He says it's Zachary."

Athena arches her back, her hips rocking against my hand as she grabs my growing length.
She bites her bottom lip, squeezing her eyes shut.

"Keep him at the entrance. I'll be there shortly."

As footsteps retreat, Athena's lips part in a long, shuddering groan she'd been suppressing.
Her muscles clench around my fingers.

"He's here," she mutters, attempting to pull away.

"He can wait. I need to finish what I started."

I throw the blankets off and bury my face between her thighs.

She gasps as my mouth finds her.
My tongue flicks over her swollen clit as I spread her legs wider.

I love that she belongs to me.
I love that I'm the only one who will ever taste her sweetness.

As she begins to arch again, I thrust my cock into her deeply.

"Alexander," she breathes out helplessly.
Her eyes close as her muscles clamp around me, leaving little room to move.

I pull her upright against my chest.
Our lips hover centimeters apart as I thrust into her.

"Let me see those beautiful blue eyes," I growl.

Her eyes lock with mine as I push deeper.
Her nails dig into my shoulders as her moans fill the room.
With one final cry, she grips my cock tightly as her body shudders around me.
I fill her with my release.

She remains seated on me, arms looped around my neck, head resting on my shoulder.
Her breathing is heavy, her heart pounding loudly.

"You need a shower," I murmur, running my fingers through her hair.

"Are you saying I smell?"

I laugh. "Like our passion."

Her legs wrap around my hips as I carry her to the shower, her lips tracing my jawline.
Pregnancy has definitely made her more passionate.

It was nearly two hours before I finally left the bedroom and headed to the pack entrance to meet Zachary.
He was arguing intensely with several of my guards.

"Where the hell have you been?" he snaps upon seeing me.

"My mate had needs."
###Chapter 0145

He rolled his eyes at me.

“I’m guessing since you’re here, the Rogues are all dead.”

His dark gaze remained fixed on me.

“It’s alright,” I told the guard. “He’s with Brianna.”

“So the female Alpha hasn’t killed her yet?” Zachary asked, curiosity in his tone.

“Not yet. But there’s still a decent chance.”

Zachary sighed. “Did she apologize like I told her to?”

“From what I heard, she said an apology would be worthless.”

“Brianna!” he muttered under his breath.

He came to a sudden halt, nostrils flaring. His eyes scanned the area. I thought he was searching for Brianna and was about to tell him where she was when I realized he was staring at my sister.

Isabella was carrying something in her arms and dropped it the moment she noticed his attention. She spun around quickly and marched away at a brisk pace.

“Wolf, right?” Zachary murmured.

“Yes, that’s Isabella, my sister. She’s not your biggest fan.”

“Who is?” He shrugged.

“There are only four Lycans here. My mate, Sophia. Brianna. And now you. Isabella is close with my mate. She likes Sophia well enough, but every other Lycan she’s met has been a complete pain. Everyone else here is Wolf.”

“Right.” His dark eyes continued scanning the area as we walked toward the house where I’d placed Brianna.

Before Zachary could knock, Brianna threw the door open and launched herself at him. “I’m so glad you’re alive! But you shouldn’t have come. Now that you’re here, we can leave.”

“I haven’t met the female Alpha yet,” Zachary muttered, setting her back on her feet. He looked at me, waiting.

“She’s resting right now.”

“I see. Maybe a tour, then?” he asked hopefully. I saw Brianna frown.

“Are you up to something? Because I don’t have the time or the patience for games right now,” I warned.

Zachary smiled. “If I were, I would’ve taken out those two guards holding me at the border. In fact, I probably could’ve taken out most of your people in the time you were busy with your mate. That’s the only reason you kept me waiting so long, right?”

“Zachary!” Brianna snapped. “You can’t speak to him like that. He’s the Pack Alpha.”

Zachary glanced at her and reluctantly apologized. “Packs aren’t how I was raised. We didn’t have hierarchies.”

“You didn’t, but it sounds like you were the one in charge,” I muttered. He’d taken control of everything during our short time together.

“I suppose.”

“Why do you want to meet Athena?” I pressed as Brianna retreated inside.

“You said it yourself, Alexander. She’s a female Lycan Alpha. The last one. She needs all the protection she can get.”

“She has the pack.”

“Yes, but they aren’t Lycans.” Zachary frowned.

What he was implying hit me. “The Rogues are still alive, aren’t they?”

“One got away.”

“We can handle it.” I wasn’t afraid of any beast.

“You’ve fought Lycans before, correct?” Zachary asked.

“Yes.”

“But you haven’t battled Rogues. They’re darker. Far more dangerous than those who shift between human and beast. They don’t fight to win. They fight for food. They won’t just rip out throats or kill. They’ll tear a body apart, drag bones and organs from flesh while the prey is still alive. Feasting on them as they beg for death.”

“How did you kill them?”

“Luck. But I’ve studied them for years. I’ve provided them food. They don’t care about Wolves or other Lycans. They don’t follow commands. The only thing they care about is a full stomach.”

“You killed them in their sleep?”

“I did what had to be done.”
###Chapter 0146
Athena

Isabella practically smashes through the bedroom door as she bursts inside.
I had never seen her in such a state of panic.
Her eyes were wide, her breathing ragged like she'd just sprinted a full mile.

She flapped her hands wildly, trying to steady herself.
“I’m guessing you’re not okay?” I murmured.

“He’s here.”
She could only be talking about Zachary. “You saw him?”

“Yes, wait, you already knew?” She froze, staring at me in shock.
“One of the guards interrupted us to tell Alexander. What’s he like?”

“I didn’t speak to him.”
“Okay.”

“But he looked right at me.”
“Do you think he knows?”

“Of course he knows, Athena! I panicked. I dropped everything and ran straight here.”

She shook her head vigorously. “With Gabriel, we were both drawn to each other instantly. When I first caught his scent, I followed it, and he was doing the same. But this guy... he just stood there, staring at me while talking to Alexander. Acting like he couldn’t even smell me! Or maybe he was disgusted. Whatever it was, he did not look happy!”

“Maybe he was just surprised. You’ve known he was your mate without ever seeing him. This is the first time he’s realized it.”

“That doesn’t help.”
I couldn’t hold back a laugh.

Isabella pointed a sharp finger at me. “Don’t! This isn’t funny, Athena. Do you think it’s because I’m a Wolf?”

“I don’t know.”
“It is, isn’t it? He’s probably revolted.”

“Where is he now?”
“I don’t know. I told you, I came straight here. I thought you’d be the only one who gets this.”

“What does he look like?” I asked calmly, hoping to soothe her.

She stopped pacing and turned. “Like a God.” She collapsed onto the bed beside me, giggling as the panic finally melted away. “Do you think he’ll like me?”

“I’m sure he will.” I couldn’t imagine anyone not liking Isabella.

She rolled onto her side, a deep frown on her face. “He’s Brianna’s best friend.”

“You talked to her, didn’t you?” I muttered, avoiding her gaze.

“I was curious about Zachary, but yes.”
“Do you believe she’s sorry?” I whispered, staring at the ceiling.

“I really want to say no, Athena. But when she spoke about what she did, her voice was full of genuine sorrow.”

“You think I should talk to her?”
“Maybe hear her out first. Then decide.” She shrugged. “If you still think she’s lying, do what you need to do.”

Isabella stayed with me for a few more hours.
She turned on the television, but her conversation kept circling back to Zachary.

“Isabella, just go talk to him.”
“I can’t. I’ve been here for hours, and he hasn’t even tried to find me.”

“You’re in my bedroom. Inside the packhouse. Do you really think he’s going to barge in here?”

“You’re right!” She jumped off the bed and hurried to the mirror, checking her reflection. “I can do this. I can seek him out. Women are just as powerful as men.” She turned to me, eyes wide again. “What if he rejects me?”

“Do what Sophia did!”
“Refuse him?”
“Why not? It worked for Sophia.”

She nodded and rushed out of the room.

‘You should have told her.’ Nyx muttered.
‘I’m fine.’ I shot back.
‘Ignoring the pain doesn’t mean you’re fine!’

‘I’m carrying twins. It’s just discomfort.’
‘Isabella’s a doctor!’ Nyx argued.

‘I know. But she’s wrapped up in all this new mate bond stuff. I’ll be okay. I’ll get something to eat.’
###Chapter 0147

I swung my legs off the bed and pushed myself up. The effort was greater than I anticipated. Once upright, I moved into the hallway. The thought of food had taken root, and I realized I was absolutely starving.

I headed for the stairs. My legs suddenly buckled beneath me. I plummeted down each step. My head struck something hard. Everything went completely dark.

"Ow!" I muttered, stretching out my limbs. My hand instinctively went between my thighs. No blood. Thank the gods. These pups were proving to be incredibly strong.

A sharp knock echoed from the front door.

"Come in," I called out from my spot on the floor.

"Shit. Are you alright?"

Unfamiliar dark eyes appeared above me. A hand slid into mine, pulling me up to my feet.

"You must be Zachary?" I asked, rubbing the back of my head while noticing the intricate tattoos on his neck. Any wound would have likely healed already.

"I am. Though this isn't exactly how I planned our introduction. You should get checked out."

"I'm fine."

"You're pregnant. I can scent it."

"I will be fine," I stated firmly, spitting out the last word.

He gave a slow nod as I sat on the bottom step. "You may believe that, but you should still be examined. You are the female Alpha."

I rolled my eyes at him. "Is that why you're here? Looking for someone to lead you?"

"I'm seeking the only one capable of leading us." His dark gaze was intensely focused. If I didn't know better, I'd say he learned it from Alexander. But something told me this was his natural way of observing the world, even before his transformation. "And I wish to offer you my protection."

Nyx snorted internally. I almost did aloud. His expression remained deadly serious. "Protection from what?"

"Whatever is coming."

"What is coming?" I pressed.

He just stared. Dark. Mysterious. Exactly how Alexander was when we first met.

"And what about Isabella?"

"What about her?"

"She's your mate," I muttered.

"I am aware of that."

"Are you going to reject her?"

"I don't know her well enough to make that decision."

She hadn't gone to him like I suggested. Perhaps I could force them together. "Actually, can you take me to the hospital? Maybe I should get checked out after all."

He walked beside me, halting just outside the hospital doors. "Is something wrong with Isabella?" He frowned.

"No. She's the pack physician."

His face was an unreadable mask, but he followed me inside.

"Ath…" Isabella's voice faded into a squeak as her eyes locked on the man who was her destined mate.

"I fell down the stairs," I explained quickly, detailing the sudden pain. She beckoned me into a room for a scan. Zachary followed, positioning himself in the doorway to watch. His dark eyes kept drifting to Isabella. She tried desperately not to look his way, beads of sweat forming on her brow.

The strong heartbeats of the twins filled the room. Alexander charged in at that moment. He pushed past Zachary with a frown and pressed his lips to mine. "Sorry, we were dealing with Ethan. Are you okay?"

I nodded.

"Tell Nyx to stop blocking the bond."

"She needs rest," Isabella snapped at him, her professional tone returning. "Both boys' heartbeats are strong. But you must rest. It remains a high-risk pregnancy." She turned her warning to me. "And I don't want to confine you to bed rest just yet."

"Out of curiosity, can you tell what they are?" It was Zachary's first direct question to her. His voice was low. "Wolves or Lycans?"

"No." Her answer was far more abrupt than her usual tone. Was she irritated with him?
###Chapter 0148
Zachary

She was stunning from the very first moment I saw her. My destined mate. A Wolf. Far too good for someone like me.

I observe her interacting with the Alpha. She’s sharp and reacts swiftly.

Her dark hair is tied back loosely with a band, a few strands falling free near her neck. When her dark eyes meet mine, I catch a speck of light brown beneath her left pupil. She quickly turns away, focusing entirely on the Alpha again, smiling as the steady heartbeats echo around the room.

Her joy amplifies her strawberry scent. For a fleeting moment, I wonder if she would taste like strawberries too.

I barely register Alexander pushing past me. I just watch her lips move as she scolds both of them.

Once everything is calm, I finally ask the question that’s been on my mind since I first detected Athena’s pregnancy.

Isabella glares at me as if I’ve committed some terrible offense. She snaps a sharp “No!”

Alexander’s unusual red eyes lock onto mine, and I recall what he told me earlier. Isabella doesn’t like us. Maybe she despises the idea of being mated to one of us.

I step outside the room, leaving the three of them alone. But I don’t go far. I stand guard outside her door instead. I will protect the Alpha whether she wants me to or not.

Alexander steps out, closing the door behind him. “That question… it’s been asked repeatedly by the bastard in my dungeon. That’s why she’s short with you.”

“Sorry.” I don’t usually apologize, but he needs to know it was genuine curiosity, nothing more. In theory, if I don’t reject Isabella, they become my nephews too. They become my family.

“The man in the dungeon, he’s the one who wants the pups?” I ask.

He nods. “He was also the one who had Sophia removed from the house. His brother was the one you left for the Rogues.”

“Right.”

“Thanks for convincing her to get checked.” Alexander mutters. “Just give my sister time. She was rejected by her first mate.”

“You know?” I ask, surprised. I intended to keep it quiet until I figured out if we were compatible.

“She’s my sister. Of course I know.” He slaps my back. “Like I said, give her time.”

Her first mate was a fool for rejecting her.

He heads back into the room, and Isabella takes his place. She stares at me with those beautiful dark eyes, and I can’t help but glance over the rest of her. The blue shirt hides her frame, but the skinny black jeans show off her legs and ass.

“You want to protect Athena?” she asks quietly.

“Yes.”

“Why?” She raises a brow, pressing her lips together. “She has Alexander. She has the entire pack.”

“She is our lifeline. The only pure blood left.”

“Right.” Her brow furrows as she folds her arms over her chest. She sighs. “If you’re going to reject me, just get it over with. I have things to do.”

I stay silent, just watching her. I can see the anger simmering in her eyes. The longer I don’t speak, the more irritated she becomes.

“Fucking Lycans!” she growls, storming off.

After a quick glance back at the Alpha, I follow Isabella. She marches across the grounds and into the forest. Is this what they do here? Just leave without telling anyone?

I trail after her, keeping my distance. She weaves through the trees, dragging her hands along each trunk. It takes me a moment to realize she’s marking them with her scent in case something happens.

“He’s an asshole!” she mutters to herself.

“No.” she says under her breath.

Who is she talking to? There’s no one else here.

She reaches a stream.

She pulls off her boots and socks, rolls up her jeans, and wades into the water. Her eyes are glazed over as she continues talking to herself, mostly complaining about me.

I listen to her one-sided argument with amusement. She couldn’t be linking the Alpha. Only her mate and other Lycans could do that. Yet it sounds like she’s talking to someone who knows we’re mated. So who is it?

With her eyes glazed, she’s oblivious to me watching. Even when I step out from the trees into full view, she doesn’t notice me or the creature hunting her.

I had been so focused on protecting the Alpha when Isabella seemed like she needed it more.

The crack of a twig snaps her attention back. Her glazed eyes focus on me, but I hadn’t moved. I wasn’t the one who made the sound.

“What do you want?!” she snaps.

I hold up a hand, listening to the forest sounds. It takes me a second to hear the erratic heartbeat. Shit, it must have tracked me here.

“Isabella, get out of the water and come toward me.”

She doesn’t move, just glares.

“Isabella. Move. Now!”

She turns to look behind her. The leaves of the bushes begin to rustle. Isabella starts backing out of the stream toward me.

I spin her around to face me, seeing the panic on her face.

“Run. Find Alexander.”

She takes off running as the Rogue Lycan reveals itself. It’s on all fours, creeping forward. The Rogues found it easier to move that way, using four limbs to propel themselves faster.

Drool hangs from its bared teeth. Its snout wrinkles as it growls at me. Its claws dig into the dirt as it slowly approaches the stream.

It sniffs the air. “A whole place full of Wolves.”

It was something I should have told Alexander. Not only had they become feral to the point of no return, but they had learned to speak.

“You are not welcome here,” I growl back. “Leave before you end up like the others!”

It laughs at my words but backs into the bushes where it came from. The erratic heartbeat fades until I can no longer hear it.

“FUCK.”

The surviving Rogue was the worst of them all. It had a hunger unlike the others. I had seen it make its food last for days, enjoying the screams of its victims, torturing them as it ate piece by piece.

But I was partly responsible for that. I brought them food when they couldn’t find any.

I hear footsteps moving quickly through the forest. I smell Isabella, but she’s accompanied by others. Alexander appears first, followed closely by a couple of other men and Isabella.

Her dark eyes scan me, checking for wounds.

“Where is it?” Alexander demands.

“It backed off,” I mutter.

“You brought it here? It followed you?” he presses.

“Apparently.”

“Why didn’t you kill it?” a man with long dark hair asks.

I sigh. Only Brianna knew the truth, but I had to tell them. “He was my younger brother.”
###Chapter 0149
Isabella

Two days had passed since Zachary revealed the Rogue was his brother.
He offered no further explanation.
He constantly followed Athena around.
Whether she approved or not.

His presence made it impossible for me to spend time with her.
His scent distracted me constantly.
He barely spoke to me.
He watched me whenever I was near.
He kept his distance as if expecting an attack.

The moment Sebastian or Alexander appeared, he vanished to Brianna’s home.

‘He’s being an idiot.’ Midnight grumbled as I entered the packhouse.
‘Tell me about it!’ Midnight’s frustration surpassed my own.

“She’s getting dressed.” Alexander muttered with a frown, striding toward the front door. “Zachary is outside her bedroom.”
“Are you seriously allowing this? Letting him guard her? We know nothing about him!”

He stopped and rolled his eyes at me.
It was the same dismissive gesture he’d used for years whenever he thought I was overreacting.
I wished he understood how irritating it felt.

He turned fully and placed his hands on my shoulders. “Isabella, talk to him. He is your mate.”
“I don’t understand your attitude. I thought you, of all people, would oppose this. Especially after everything our pack has endured.”

“Circumstances change. He isn’t here for me. He wants to protect Athena.” He sighed, running a hand through his short hair.
“What if he’s like Caleb? What if this is a trap? And you’re just walking away, leaving him alone with her.”

“Just because he hasn’t explained things to you doesn’t mean he hasn’t explained himself to me.” Alexander tutted.
“Oh. He told you?” I asked, surprised.
“Out of respect for my position, yes. Now go spend some much-needed time with my mate before her next hormone surge.”

I frowned, but he shook his head and walked out.

Zachary stood like a soldier outside her bedroom door.
His hands were clasped, his gaze fixed straight ahead.
I tried to move silently, but his head turned slowly toward me.
He remained silent.

“I’m here to see Athena.” I whispered.
It felt like I’d been caught attempting to steal.

His stare made it seem like I’d just confessed to carrying a bomb.
He stepped aside, watching me approach.

With one hand on the door handle, I turned to him. “Why are you treating me this way?”
“What way would that be?”
“Like I’m trash you tossed out your car window? It’s not my fault we’re paired! I already told you—just reject me and be done with it!”

One side of his lips tugged up, but the smirk vanished quickly.
“Is this a joke to you?” I snapped. “Do you have any idea how maddening this is? Your scent follows me everywhere, yet you’ve made no move. I don’t know whether I’m coming or going with you! Do you even want me as a mate?”

My heart pounded as I ranted.

“You hate Lycans?” he stated after a prolonged silence.
My cheeks flushed. Who told him that?
“Athena is a Lycan.” My defense sounded weak. “She’s my closest friend.”
“You should hate us.” He stepped closer, leaning over me. “We are not like you. We are dark. We are cold. We are monsters.”

His face was inches from mine.
I should have been frightened by his warning.
But this was the closest he’d been since his arrival.
I couldn’t tell if he wanted to kiss me or kill me.
But I knew what I wanted.

“I’m not scared of you.” I whispered, refusing to retreat.
“You should be.”
I shook my head slightly.

Suddenly, he slammed me against the wall, pressing his body against mine.
His lips met mine with forceful longing.
A deep growl rumbled within him as his hands slipped under my top, gripping my waist.
He forced a knee between my thighs, pressing himself harder against me.
###Chapter 0150

Athena’s sharp cry made Zachary pull away instantly.

He left me standing there, breathless and forgotten, as if nothing had just happened between us.

My heart hammered violently against my ribs.

He walked straight into her room, leaving me half-aroused in the damn hallway, the taste of him still burning on my lips.

‘What the hell was that?’ Midnight snarled, her voice tight with fury.

‘I need to leave. Now.’

I backed away slowly, reaching the top of the staircase. Tears pricked at the corners of my eyes.

“No. Absolutely not,” I whispered fiercely to myself, dashing down the steps and wiping my face. I don’t cry. I wasn’t going to start now.

I hurried across the pack grounds, my safe haven coming into view—the hospital. This was my domain. Where I was in charge. Where every member of Obsidian Howl relied on me.

I sank down behind the main station, sitting quietly on the cool floor, letting Midnight’s presence soothe my racing thoughts. Why did I let myself get pulled in like that? Why did I let the mate bond fog my judgment?

‘We couldn’t help it,’ Midnight murmured softly. ‘He awakens feelings we haven’t felt in years.’

‘He’s not Gabriel.’

‘No, he’s not. Gabriel betrayed us.’ I felt her simmering anger, though she’d never say it out loud.

Frustrated, I slapped my palm hard against the tiled floor.

“Angry about something?” A low, gravelly voice spoke from the other side of the station.

I froze. I thought I was alone.

I hadn’t smelled anything. I hadn’t sensed another wolf. That could mean only one thing.

‘Alexander,’ I linked my brother urgently. ‘It’s here. Inside my hospital.’

‘What are you talking about?’

‘The Rogue,’ I whispered, fear lacing my thoughts.

‘We’re on our way!’

“I’d prefer if you came out,” the voice rumbled, deep and unnatural. “I only wish to talk.” The beast was speaking.

‘We should shift,’ Midnight urged.

‘No. It’ll attack immediately.’

Keeping my back to it, I slowly rose to my feet. I had no weapons. Nothing within reach that could be used to defend myself.

I turned.

My breath caught in my throat.

I hadn’t gotten a clear look at it in the forest, but what stood before me now was far worse than any Lycan we had ever fought. Zachary was right. They were monsters.

It held my gaze, unblinking. Its nostrils flared as it tilted its massive, distorted head. Dried blood coated its sharp teeth and snout. Had it killed someone to get in here?

“You carry the traitor’s scent,” it growled.

I stared back, refusing to blink, ready for any sudden movement. A part of me had doubted Zachary when he said they could speak.

“How… how did you get in?” I always locked up before leaving.

“Is that your final worry before death, Isabella?”

“You know my name?” My voice came out as a squeak. My eyes flickered toward the door. Where was Alexander? Where was anyone?

“Who do you wait for?” It sounded like it was attempting a laugh. “Your new mate? Your powerful brother? Or perhaps the female Alpha? None can save you now, Isabella.”

‘Keep it talking,’ Midnight whispered. ‘Buy time.’

“You’ve been watching me?” I followed her instruction. Maybe I could stall long enough.

“Call it that if it comforts you.”

It hadn’t moved an inch since I started speaking. Was it trying to unnerve me?

“Your eyes keep drifting to the door. I assume you’ve linked one of them.” It rose onto its hind legs, a terrifying sight. “Our time for talk is over.”

It leaped over the counter directly at me.

Clawed hands locked around my body before I could even react.

It pressed something firmly over my mouth.

I fought hard, thrashing and kicking, but the more I struggled, the more of the substance I inhaled.

My body grew weaker by the second.

My arms and legs became heavy, barely responsive.

This wasn’t like fighting one of the bitten ones, whose only goal was a messy kill. This thing anticipated my every move. As if it knew me.

I couldn’t fight anymore.

My head fell back against a solid, muscular chest.

“Time to sleep.”
###Chapter 0151

I leaned against the wall outside the bedroom door after checking on Athena. Isabella was already gone.

I shouldn't have kissed her. Her taste was intoxicating, but I shouldn't have lost control like that. I couldn't bring myself to push her away, not yet.

Maybe I didn't truly want to. She would come to hate me eventually anyway.

Brianna crept up the stairs toward me. Her lips were pressed into a thin line that gradually curved into a smile as she approached. "Do you think she'll talk to me if you're here?" She glanced hopefully at the door.

"Brianna, we've been through this."

"Zachary, I have to try."

"Nothing's changed." I muttered. I wanted Athena to listen to Brianna, but it had to be on her terms. I'd already learned that about her. "And she's definitely not in the mood right now. If you go in there, she'll probably kill you on sight."

"Oh." She leaned against the wall beside me. "How am I supposed to get her to listen to me?"

"You don't. You keep your head down. You do everything that's asked of you. You show respect to everyone here. Then, just maybe, she'll see you're trying and be willing to speak to you. But for now, she's pregnant. If she feels threatened, it's game over for you."

She sighed heavily.

"I told you it wouldn't be easy. I thought I had trust issues, but the Alpha's ability to trust is on another level entirely."

She frowned at me. "She trusts you."

"No, she doesn't."

"Then why are you guarding her?"

"To show her I mean what I say."

Brianna rolled her eyes at me. We had very different belief systems. She expected everyone to accept her as she was. Whereas I'd always had to work for it. Human or not.

"You know as well as I do that her abuse didn't end after you nearly killed her." I added.

"Right." Brianna nodded slowly. "I still can't believe you told the others the truth about him being your brother." She changed the subject because it was still hard for her to talk openly about her past.

"If I want to live here, I need to be honest with them."

"But you wouldn't have told them if he'd never shown up here, would you? And you haven't told them everything. You can't keep that secret forever. They'll figure it out!"

She knew me too well. But I also knew she wouldn't blab.

I hadn't liked Brianna when we first met. But when there are just two of you going through the same hell, it's hard not to form a bond. Now, I couldn't imagine my world without her. She'd helped me through some of the worst moments of my life and had done more than her fair share with the other Rogues.

She gave me a sad smile. "You've settled right in here. Who would've thought you'd like pack life?"

"You just need time. Isn't that what you first told me when I found you?"

Brianna nodded. "True."

"Go back to the house. There's no point in you standing here with me."

"I'll see you later?" She asked.

"Sure."

"At least you and Sophia like me." She muttered as she turned away.

I watched Brianna hurry back down the stairs until I was alone again.

My thoughts drifted to Isabella and how she hadn't backed away from me. Not a single ounce of fear in her eyes. Anger and annoyance, yes. But no fear, even when I pushed her against the wall. Almost as if she were expecting it.

A man's voice bellowed my name from downstairs. "Alexander needs you!" Sebastian, Alexander's Beta, spluttered when he saw me.

"Why?"

He glanced at the bedroom door and dropped his voice to a whisper. "It's here. It's in the hospital with Isabella."
###Chapter 0152

My veins turn to ice at the sound of her name.
He’s targeting her again.

“Alexander is already heading there with Theodore. But you know the layout better than we do.”
“Alpha Athena?” I whisper.
I’m torn.
Stay and protect her?
Or go to protect my mate?
This could all be a diversion.
A trick to pull us away from what my brother truly wants.

“I’ll handle Athena. Go.” Sebastian insists.
“If anything shows up here, link Alexander. I’ll be with him.” I snap.
I bolt down the stairs and out the door.

The hospital isn’t far.
But it’s far enough.
He could have already hurt her.

Alexander and Theodore are searching when I arrive.
“She’s gone.” Alexander growls. “Whatever he did, she’s unconscious. I can’t reach her through the link.”
“We’ve turned the whole place upside down. Nothing.” Theodore reports. “Not a strand of hair. No blood. Even Isabella’s scent just… vanishes.”

“I can smell him.” I mutter.
I move around the small desk in the center of the room.
The air hits me.
Strawberries.
Mixed with pure, sharp fear.
She was here.
Hiding beneath this desk.

“How long?” I ask.
“For what?” Alexander snarls.
“Between her linking you and you getting here. How long?”
“A couple of minutes. I came straight here. Why?”
Did she know he was inside?
Is that why she hid?

I circle the desk.
He stood right here.
Probably taunting her.
“He didn’t take her out the front. Too risky.” I tell them.
“The back door’s been locked since the last Lycan incident.” Theodore says. “It leads straight into the woods. No other way in or out.”
“There’s always a way.”

“I’ll link my men. We’ll sweep the forest.” Alexander offers.
“No.” I command.
“She’s my sister.”
“If you want her breathing, don’t send anyone else. He’s luring me out. More men, and he’ll kill her. Then everyone else. They play with their food. But too many options? They just slaughter everything. You said it yourself, Alexander. You can’t scent him.”

I move through the halls.
I find the back door quickly.
Just as Theodore said.
No signs of forced entry.

A curtain near a closed window flutters.
Then I see them.
Claw marks around the edges.
A small gap where the window was poorly refitted.
Letting in a draft.

He removed the entire window.
Slipped inside unseen.
Left the same way.
“He dragged her through the window.” I tell them.
“She would have fought him.” Alexander glares. “She’s a good fighter.”
“You said it. She’s out cold. Can’t fight if you’re unconscious.”

I slam my shoulder into the back door.
It takes two hits.
The door splinters off its hinges.

I rip off my shirt.
My body cracks, preparing to shift.
It’s been too long.

“We’re coming too.” Alexander says, tearing his own shirt off. “This is my pack. He has my sister. You don’t get to order me around!” His crimson eyes narrow at me.

I remove my belt and boots.
I just stare.
He won’t like this.
I thought I could keep the secret longer.

“You can’t track them. I can.” I shift fully into my Lycan form.
My muscles stretch and groan.

I drop to all fours.
I run my snout along the ground.
I suck in his scent.
I catch a trace of Isabella.
Faint.
But enough.
I can find her.

“We can help! Just lead the way!” Alexander insists. “You can’t do this alone. That’s not how we operate!”

I growl at him, low and deep.
“I can. Because I was once like him.”
###Chapter 0153
Zachary

They shift regardless of my command. Alexander keeps his hostile glare fixed on me. Questions will come later. I’ll handle them then.

They match my pace for only minutes. They’re fast. I’m faster. I glide effortlessly between the trees.

I race through the forest. Tracking his scent. Hope flares when I catch traces of strawberries. It means he didn’t ditch her. He didn’t hide her like he normally does. This is a game to him. A game he will lose.

The canopy grows dense. It darkens the woods despite the high sun. He could be anywhere here. The Wolves would never find him. Hiding in the shadows. Watching. Waiting. Picking his moment like the predator he is.

“I know you’re here,” I shout. “I smell you. I smell her.”

No answer. I didn’t expect one. This is how he operates. Silent. Observant. Choosing his moment like his life depends on it. Today, it might. Can I finally end my brother?

“Why her?” My voice echoes in the dark forest. “Because she’s my mate? Is this payback for the others? That’s pathetic!”

More silence. He’s watching me. Deciding whether to reveal himself. Part of the fun is the victim never knowing where you are.

“Did you hurt her?” I demand. Only forest sounds answer. Creatures going about their day. Unaware of the coming fight. I smell no blood. That doesn’t mean he hasn’t harmed her.

“She doesn’t deserve this,” I tell the trees. “She’s innocent.”

My eyes scan the shadows. Searching for anything out of place. Like at the hospital, everything seems normal. He blends in perfectly. Too perfectly.

A whimper pulls my attention behind me. I lunge forward. They’re already gone. Vanishing deeper into the woods.

He’ll punish her for giving him away.

“Stop this, little brother!” I growl.

“We stopped being brothers long ago!” His voice rasps from somewhere ahead. “I could snap her pretty neck. But where’s the fun in that?”

I charge forward. Laughter echoes above me.

I look up. He’s twenty feet up a tree. Isabella dangles from his claws like a ragdoll. Her eyes are closed. She seems unharmed, just asleep. Thank the moon.

“What did you do to her?”

“A little nitrous oxide.” He garbles a laugh. “Remember, Zachary? You used it on me when I became a risk. I never forgot. People leave such useful things lying around.”

“You killed for it!”

“Haven’t you done worse?” He glares at me. Then his gaze shifts to the sedated Isabella. “Did you tell her? Did you explain your cruelty? How her Alpha is nothing compared to you?”

“What do you want? These people did nothing to you. I kept you safe. I fed you. I gave you a home where you wouldn’t be hunted. I taught you to survive!”

“Look where that got us!”

“Whose fault is that? You made me this way.” He growls. He drops Isabella a few inches. Catches her by the foot. He swings her like a pendulum.

“That’s your excuse for taking her? Why wait, huh?”

“I’ve waited years for this, Zachary. You took everything from me! Now I take something of yours.”

“Everything? You blame me for what you became? You wanted this. Tired of your pathetic human life, you asked for it. You knew what she turned me into. You still went to her. Did you think it would magically fix your problems?”

He growls. He always hated the truth, even as a human.

“You didn’t have to become this. You chose this path. Blame me all you want. She doesn’t deserve it.”

“Never thought I’d see you soft over a girl.” He mocks, still swinging her.

“What if I mark her?” He pulls Isabella up. Holds her neck near his sharp teeth. “That would be more interesting.”

“We both know you can’t mark her.”

“A pity. I could rip her throat out. What do you think?” He licks her bare neck. “Delicious!”

A feral growl rips from my chest. He ignores it. Bad enough he has her. Violating her in front of me is too far.

He spins her around. “Or maybe a chunk of her thigh? Would you still want her then?”

“Let her go!” I snarl.

“No.” He leaps to another tree. Tightens his grip on my mate. “Want her? Come get her!”

I charge up the nearest tree. Close behind him. He laughs. Leaps through the branches like a giant monkey. His claws grip Isabella tightly so she won’t fall. His weight cracks branches underfoot. Making it harder to track him.

He stops suddenly. Spins to face me. “Enough games. You took what was mine. Now I take something of yours. You like to suffer. Let’s see how you cope without her, brother.”

Isabella’s eyes flutter open. He sinks his teeth into her leg. A blood-curdling scream tears from her as he rips flesh from bone. Blood sprays from the wound. He laughs.

He stares at me. Slowly chews her flesh.

“I will fucking kill you, Gabriel!”
###Chapter 0154

Athena.

"Hi Sebastian." I whisper as he enters my room. "Is everything alright?"

"It's fine." He murmurs, securing the lock. "Alexander just wants you to remain here for now."

"Why?"

"No specific reason."

He's lying. Nyx whispers.

I know. I retort silently.

Sebastian avoids my eyes as he moves through the room, inspecting each window.

"You realize if someone truly wants inside, they'll just shatter the glass."

He continues avoiding my gaze.

"It's returned, hasn't it? The Rogue Lycan. That's why you're here and Zachary left."

He offers a weak smile. "Not long ago, you kept your thoughts to yourself. You avoided hard truths."

"Alexander went after it, didn't he?"

"He's with Zachary and Theodore, yes."

"Alexander told me what Zachary said about Rogues. How they enjoy games? If you're checking every lock, you believe it's coming here. You think it's coming for me?"

"Just a precaution. We don't know its intentions."

"Where?"

Sebastian stays silent.

"Sebastian, tell me."

"It was at the hospital. It took Isabella."

"What? Why?" I stare, frustrated he withheld this.

He's not stupid. He knows you'll want to help. Nyx murmurs.

"I don't know. It was at the hospital when Isabella linked Alexander."

"And?

"It took her into the forest. Athena, Alexander insists you stay."

"It's a Lycan." I state.

"A Rogue Lycan." Sebastian replies. "You can't reason with it. It answers to no one."

"But Zachary believes he can help?" I frown.

Sebastian's shoulders slump.

"You're hiding something. What is it?"

"The Rogue is Zachary's brother." He finally meets my eyes. "I don't know details. But this isn't his first time targeting Isabella."

I stumble back, sitting on the bed. Annoyance flares through me. Why keep this from me? Why didn't Zachary say anything? Or my own mate? Isabella is my friend.

I march to the closet, yanking out boots.

"Athena, you can't. Think of the twins."

"I'm not abandoning her!"

"Consider the twins!"

"I am! Do you think it stops with Isabella? What about every pack child? They become easy targets while I stand aside and allow it!"

He blocks the door. "I can't let you leave. Alexander's orders!"

"Move, Sebastian!"

"My duty is to protect you."

"Then come with me." I glare.

"Alexander will kill me." He mutters, stepping aside.

"Then ensure nothing happens to me." I snap, striding out.

Sebastian follows, insisting this is a mistake.

I whirl to face him. "Perhaps it is. But Isabella doesn't deserve this. They were turned because of me. Now—because one took it too far, she might die? I can't allow that, Sebastian. Without her when Genevieve drugged me, I wouldn't be here. So please, stand with me. Help me find her."

He nods reluctantly. We hurry toward the forest.

I step quietly into the trees, asking Nyx to block Alexander. He asked me not to, but he shouldn't worry about me with his sister missing. Only Sebastian knows I'm here.

My legs carry me swiftly, instinctively knowing the direction.

We haven't traveled far when a scream pierces the air. A scream that sounds like Isabella.
###Chapter 0155

“Are you certain about this?” Sebastian’s whisper is urgent as his fingers wrap around my arm.

I give a sharp nod. “I have to try.”

Without another word, I surge forward, leaving him behind.

Zachary’s voice echoes through the trees. It takes me a moment to spot him perched high in a tree. He’s in full Lycan form. He can speak while shifted?

‘There’s so much we still don’t know,’ Nyx murmurs as I drop into a crouch behind a thick bush.

Isabella screams again. In another tree, a second Lycan dangles her effortlessly. She’s putting up little fight. Blood drips steadily onto the forest floor beneath her.

“GABRIEL! This isn’t a fucking game!” Zachary’s roar shakes the leaves.

Gabriel. Did he just say Gabriel?

‘As in her first mate?’ Nyx sounds intrigued.

‘But he was a Wolf.’

‘Has she ever mentioned that?’ she murmurs.

‘Are you suggesting she knew and kept it secret?’

‘No. Think. You said she told you he rejected her after learning which pack she belonged to. What if someone from Silver Creek warned him to stay away?’

Another scream rips from Isabella. The Rogue Lycan sinks his teeth deep into her waist. He’s killing her right in front of Zachary. I can’t just watch.

I step out from the bushes. “Release her.”

The Rogue pulls his teeth from her flesh to stare at me.

“Let her go!” I command again.

“Gladly.” He drops her.

A blur of movement. Zachary dives from his tree, trying to catch her before she hits the ground.

The Rogue lands directly in front of me. He rises to his full height, towering over my small frame.

“You are the female Alpha.” He snorts derisively. “What makes you so special?”

“Nothing.”

A guttural laugh escapes him. His beady eyes lock onto mine. “You protect Wolves? How noble.”

“You’re Gabriel?” I ask. Strangely, I feel no fear staring death in the face.

“I am.”

“You were mated to her? You were Isabella’s mate?”

“WHAT?!” The shout comes from behind me.

I don’t flinch. If I turn to see what Zachary is doing, it would be a fatal mistake. Alexander had warned me never to look away if I faced one.

“Once upon a time,” the Rogue growls.

“You rejected her.”

“I did. Wolves and Lycans don’t mix.”

He snarls, bloody drool dripping from his jaws. “Though Wolves do taste delicious.” He runs his tongue over his sharp teeth.

“Was it your choice, or were you ordered to reject her?”

“Like I said, wolves and Lycans don’t mix.”

“You won’t touch them.” My gaze doesn’t waver.

He lets out that choked laugh again. “You believe you can stop me?”

“I’ve killed Lycans.” My eyes darken as I hold his stare.

He laughs again, but this time it sounds more skeptical.

“Because you’re some almighty Alpha? That means nothing to Rogues.”

‘Tell him. He hasn’t realized it yet,’ Nyx mutters with glee.

I stare straight into his beady eyes. “I am your Alpha, whether you accept it or not, Gabriel.”

He growls, taking a step back. “I don’t use that name anymore. You will never be my Alpha.”

“You are a product of a Silver Creek Lycan. That makes me your Alpha.”

I hate using that connection, but it’s necessary. Without Nyx, I wouldn’t still be standing.

“You can’t deny it. You feel it. You know I outrank you, whether you want me to or not.”

“I am a Rogue.”

“Keep telling yourself that.”

“I will kill you.”

I don’t respond. Zachary moves silently behind him.

He drives his claws deep into Gabriel’s back, tearing through skin and muscle.
###Chapter 0156
Isabella

“Easy now.” Theodore’s voice was soft as I attempted to sit up.

My head spun violently, as if I’d been tossed inside a cyclone.

I shut my eyes and laid back, fighting the dizziness. Even Nyx was silent, which felt deeply unsettling.

I shot upright, scanning for the Rogue when a sharp, blinding pain tore through my leg.

“Gabriel?” I whispered. I was sure I’d heard his name. But everything felt foggy.

“What do you remember?” Theodore asked gently.

“I…um…” I rubbed my temples. Is this what humans felt after trauma? Why wasn’t I healing?

“He was here,” I mumbled. “He covered my mouth. Then I heard screaming. Was it me?”

I glanced around, recognizing the pack clinic. Another jolt of pain shot through my leg.

I yanked the blanket aside. Thick bandages wrapped around my thigh.

“Take them off!” I demanded.

“Isabella, you know that’s not wise.”

“Please, take them off!” I insisted. It couldn’t be real. But deep down, I already knew.

Theodore sighed and slowly unwound the bandages and gauze.

A massive chunk of my thigh was missing. Dried blood coated the skin. Ugly red wounds remained where they’d tried to stitch me back together. It had finally started healing, but it would never be the same.

“I’m sorry, Isabella. We heal, but we can’t regenerate muscle or flesh that’s gone.”

“He bit me? But he was my mate?” Shock rattled me. Gabriel had always been kind. Caring. Attentive. “What happened to him?”

Theodore carefully rebandaged my leg, choosing his words. “He was your mate, a long time ago. But he isn’t that man anymore, Isabella. Or maybe he never was. He was never a Wolf. Doing this… it means he feels nothing for you.”

“What turned him into this?”

“I don’t know.”

I wanted to cry. I wanted to let the tears fall. But they wouldn’t come. Instead, anger surged through me. How could someone be so cruel?

“When you started stirring, I called Zachary.” He gave me a small smile. “Maybe he can make you feel better.”

Zachary. Maybe now he would finally say the words.

“Did you do this?” I asked quietly, gesturing to my bandaged leg.

“I did what I could. Recovery will be long.”

“It’s okay, Theodore. I understand. It’ll be a while before I can walk properly, even after it heals.”

He nodded with a sad smile.

“Thank you, Theodore.”

When Zachary arrived, he stood in the doorway. His hands braced above the frame as he leaned in, gauging whether I wanted him here.

His dark eyes studied me. My heart skipped as his sweet vanilla scent filled the room.

Theodore winked at him and slipped out.

“How are you feeling?” Zachary asked.

“Like crap.”

He nodded and stepped inside. “So you were mated to my little brother.”

“Is that all you have to say? My whole body hurts, Zachary. I just found out my ex-mate did this to me. That he’s your brother. I thought he was a Wolf. I didn’t know he was Lycan. I never saw his Wolf form. We barely even talked about his pack or family.”

“Alexander said you probably didn’t know,” he murmured. “He filled me in. Now it all makes sense.”
###Chapter 0157

"He refused me." I choked out.

"I know. And it's a good thing he did." He settled into the chair beside my bed, his gaze fixed on me. "It would have complicated my search for you."

"Is he dead?" I exhaled, frustrated. Why did this man provoke such intense, irrational feelings in me so effortlessly?

"No. He's in the dungeons. Alpha Athena is interrogating him, trying to extract information or break his will. I'm not entirely sure. She's forbidden me from going down there."

"She shouldn't be alone with him. And she dislikes being called Alpha." I muttered.

He raised an eyebrow. "She is perfectly capable of handling herself. She took a piece of his leg as payment for what he did to you."

That information provided a small measure of satisfaction.

"You can't kill him, can you? You want to. I can see the desire in your eyes. But you can't bring yourself to do it because he's your brother."

Zachary didn't answer. He just snorted and shook his head.

"You spoke." I muttered, recalling hearing his voice as a Lycan.

"Yes."

"How? You're not like him."

"I was once." My hands clenched the blankets. His eyes dropped to them. "I won't hurt you."

"I'm not scared. I'm frustrated." I sighed. "I don't... Alexander said you told him there was no return from being like that."

"I found a way." He offered no further explanation.

"You don't want to tell me, do you?" I winced as another sharp pain shot through my thigh. This healing process was going to be long and arduous.

"You tried to warn me." I sighed. He had told me I should be afraid of him. That I should fear him.

"I did."

I nodded slowly. "I give you permission to reject me."

He scowled at me.

"You clearly couldn't decide before. But now, I'm damaged. I'm giving you a free pass. I won't fight it. I won't refuse your rejection like Sophia refused Julian's."

"Aren't we all damaged in some way?" He stood and moved closer, cupping my face. "I've been waiting days to taste you again." He leaned down, pressing his lips to mine. Softer. Gentler than last time, as if savoring the moment.

My arms looped around his neck, pulling him closer. I felt him smile against my lips. Little sparks of electricity burned through me as the kiss deepened. But he was careful not to press against me this time.

He pulled away at the sound of a knock on the door. "There will be more than enough time." He muttered, noting my frustration. "But I am not rejecting you, mate."

My heart skipped a beat.

Athena opened the door. She shot Zachary a look of pure disgust before smiling at me. I noticed her rubbing her small bump. Something she didn't have the last time I saw her. How long had I been unconscious?

"She thinks I put you in danger." Zachary made sure Athena heard him before stepping outside. I saw he didn't leave, instead standing guard as she closed the door.

"He didn't know." I muttered, unsure what I was even defending. "He didn't know it would come for me. I didn't know Gabriel was a... a Lycan!"

"He should have told us. He should have explained what he is."

"Was." I corrected. "But that's not what's really bothering you, is it?"

Athena sat in the chair. "Sebastian wasn't going to tell me." She saw my confusion. "When the Rogue took you, Sebastian was guarding me. Alexander wanted me to stay put. If I hadn't gone, you could be dead right now."

"But I'm alive."
###Chapter 0158
Athena

“What do you want?” I demand, glaring at the Rogue chained to the dungeon wall.

It responds with a low, guttural growl. I’ve been asking the same question for days. It still refuses to speak.

This is a terrible idea. We should have waited for Alexander. Nyx whispers nervously. She hates me being down here alone. Especially while pregnant.

They’re locked up. They can’t hurt us. I reply silently. Both Ethan and the Rogue are securely restrained. There’s nothing they can do.

“He won’t answer you.” Ethan calls out from his cell. “Shouldn’t you be protecting those precious twins instead of bothering us?”

The Rogue’s eyes drop to my stomach at the word ‘twins’. Its snout wrinkles tightly, baring its teeth. Every time Ethan says it, the creature focuses intensely on my belly. He’s clearly trying to provoke it.

“Growl all you want.” I snap at the Rogue. “You’re chained. You’ve only got one and a half legs. I’ll kill you before you even touch me.”

It tugs violently against its restraints.

I made sure the Rogue paid for what it did to Isabella. Nyx made certain of that.

Ethan chuckles behind me. I ignore him for now. He’ll be dead tomorrow. Finally.

The Rogue’s growling deepens. Ethan laughs louder.

I spin around to face the bastard in the cell. He always interferes. Always says things he shouldn’t. “Shut up.”

“Aren’t you worried about being down here alone?” Ethan asks.

“Your trial is tomorrow.” I spit back.

“Oh, sweet Athena.” His dark grey eyes lock onto mine.

“Don’t call me that.” I snap, cutting him off. “You don’t get to speak to me like that. Not after what you did to Sophia. Not after what you planned to do to my unborn pups.”

He grins, revealing missing teeth. “You think these chains can hold me?” He pulls against them, moving closer to the bars. “Do you think I’m the only one who wants those pups?”

The Rogue begins chuckling too. My confidence falters. I’m missing something. They’re both chained. There’s no way out.

My hands instinctively move to my small bump.

“What do you want?” I growl again, directing the question at both of them.

Alexander shouldn’t have put them so close together. They can talk. They can plan. They can plot. Two different enemies working together.

The Rogue’s beady eyes leave my stomach and meet mine. Another deep growl rumbles in its throat. For a moment, I don’t feel safe.

I know it can’t go anywhere. I know they can’t break free. But the unease doesn’t fade. It feels like I’m back in front of Victoria’s fist. Unable to understand what’s wrong. Unable to defend myself when it comes.

Shaking my head, I turn and leave the dungeon.

I press my back against the dungeon door and look up. The midday sun warms my skin.

It only lasts two seconds before I feel his crimson eyes on me.

“Again?” He mutters. “I told you not to go down there. Especially alone. You’re supposed to be resting. Especially while Isabella can’t check on you.”

“I wasn’t alone.” I protest, ignoring his comment about resting.

“Nyx doesn’t count. If something happens to you, it happens to her too.”

He holds out his hand and pulls me against his chest. His arms lock tightly around me. He whispers in my ear. “I don’t like you going down there.”

“I’m fine.”

“Really? Because I see that frown. I feel your frustration. What did Ethan say this time?”
###Chapter 0159

My frown deepens. “He said I should believe that he would be the only one who ever wants our pups. What if he’s right? Have you heard anything from his pack? Crestwood City?”

“He’s messing with your head, Athena. Ethan will be executed publicly tomorrow. Nothing he says matters.” He presses a soft kiss against my cheek. “But yes, I’ve received word from Crestwood. It seems Ethan grew too power-hungry. The Beta has taken over as Alpha. He assured me the pack is relieved to see him gone.”

I furrow my brows. It took me time to understand the bond between an Alpha and Beta. I always assumed they were unshakable. But my only references were Dominic and Marcus, and Alexander and Sebastian.

“So they won’t retaliate?”

“It doesn’t appear so.”

“What about the Rogue, Gabriel? Will his sentence be carried out tomorrow?”

“Isabella requested to speak with him first.”

I jolt in surprise. “What?”

“She asked. I agreed. Maybe she can get him to talk. He hasn’t said a word to you, no matter how many times you’ve tried.”

I’m shocked Alexander allowed it. Especially after what Gabriel did to her.

“Are you certain that’s safe?” I whisper.

“Zachary and I will be with her. She won’t be alone.”

Later that evening, the three of them headed toward the dungeons. Isabella hobbled on crutches, much to Zachary’s visible frustration.

“She’ll be alright,” Sebastian murmurs beside me.

“You can’t know that.”

“You’re right, I don’t. But neither of them will let any harm come to her.”

I watch until they disappear from view, then turn back inside.

“What answers were you hoping to get from him?” Sebastian asks, following me.

“I’m not sure.”

“Really? You’ve been sneaking down to that dungeon for days. You must have wanted something specific.”

“I wanted to understand how he became like that. But he refuses to answer anything.”

“You wanted to know how he turned Rogue?”

I nod, a lump forming in my throat.

He studies me for a moment. “That won’t happen to you.”

“You can’t know that.”

“Do you crave the taste of flesh?” I hear the hint of amusement in his voice.

“No. But what if I break? Or lose control? What if I’m tempted into it? What if something so terrible happens that I let Nyx take over completely? What if—”

“Athena, that’s too many ‘what ifs’.” He grins. “You’ve only fully shifted a few times, and only briefly. It would take a catastrophic event for you to become permanently like them. You have Alexander. You have the entire pack behind you. You aren’t a lone Lycan. Right now, you don’t need to worry about them. We have it handled. I promise.”

Maybe I was overthinking it. Maybe I’d let the silent Rogue get inside my head.

I nod as we walk toward the kitchen.

“Do you think there are more?” I ask quietly.

“Rogues? According to Theodore, it’s highly likely. We don’t know how many they marked. Brianna said the others found her over two years. So yes, there are probably more out there.”

“And in the forest,” I continue. “It was like my body knew where to go. Like Nyx could sense them, but I couldn’t. How is that possible?”

“Did Nyx know?”

“No, I didn’t!” she snaps.

“She says no. How, Sebastian? How was I able to track him without ever seeing him?”

He smiles. “You’re an Alpha, Athena. It’s in your blood.”
###Chapter 0160
Isabella

The crutches were a pain.
Not for me.
But for them.

Alexander and Zachary flanked me like I might collapse at any moment.
Every slight misstep made them tense.
I could practically hear their unspoken thoughts.
One of them would suggest carrying me soon.
Alexander had done that for Athena when she first arrived.

I caught a subtle head shake from Alexander directed at Zachary.

"I've got this." I muttered. "You might not remember, Alexander, but I've used crutches before."

"When you were seven." My brother shot back as we reached the dungeon entrance. "And only for a few hours."

"Then this should be easy." I grumbled.

Alexander unlocked the heavy door and pulled it open.

The stench hit me immediately.
Dried blood.
Urine.
Feces.
I fought back the urge to gag.

Why are we doing this? Midnight groaned inside me.

Because it's Gabriel.

She knew the real reason.
I wasn't entirely sure why I needed to see him.
Closure?
To understand his rejection?
To face the man who had ruined my physical capabilities for weeks?
Maybe all of it.
I just knew I had to look him in the eyes.
I needed to see the cruelty for myself.

'Well, more visitors.' Ethan's voice echoed from his cell as Alexander stepped inside ahead of me.

"Shut your mouth!" Alexander snapped at him.

"You shut up!" Ethan retorted weakly.
Before I could process it, Alexander unlocked Ethan's cell and delivered a sharp punch to his face.
His death couldn't come soon enough.

Then I saw him.
Gabriel.
Chained to the wall.
Zachary hadn't been exaggerating about Athena taking part of his leg.
The remaining limb hung at a sickening angle from his hip.
Bone still visible.

Zachary stood watching him.
Arms crossed over his chest.
His expression was unreadable.
No anger.
No frustration.
Just cold neutrality.
Athena had described that look to me before.
I finally understood what she meant.

Gabriel's eyes locked onto mine.
His snout curled into a silent warning.
His gaze flickered to my crutches before returning to my face.
I expected to feel something.
Anything.
But this emptiness was worse.

"Ask him whatever you need to." Zachary whispered to me. "Don't hold back because of what he was."

"You hurt me." The words came out flat. "Why me? I loved you. You loved me. I thought you rejected me because of my brother?"

"I did." He tugged at his chains uselessly.
They had been shortened until he was pressed against the wall.

"Just because of him? Not because you were Lycan?"

"Both."

"He wanted you, but Victoria was afraid he'd reveal the truth. Wasn't she?" Alexander asked as he locked Ethan's cell again.

"And you found out anyway." Gabriel snapped. "Do you even know why she wanted that contract with you?"

"You weren't there when the contract was made."

"Years, you idiot. She planned that contract for years."

"It's true." Zachary confirmed. "A Wolf discovered the pack. They didn't have enough numbers to defend themselves."

"Ethan." Alexander answered, glancing back at the cell. "Ethan found Silver Creek. He was moving in to kill you all. He admitted it to Athena."

Alexander explained how Athena had met Ethan as a child.
She didn't remember.
But he became obsessed with her and their kind.

"Are you serious?" I asked, stunned.

Alexander kept his eyes on Gabriel. He pointed toward Ethan's cell. "Did he forget to mention that during your planning sessions? If he had attacked Silver Creek earlier, you wouldn't exist."

"You don't know that!" Gabriel growled. "They were strong. They manipulated an Alpha."

"You mean a child?" I snapped, immediately defending Athena. "Your current Alpha?"

"She is not my Alpha!"

"Why are you defending them, Gabriel?" Zachary demanded. "Can't you see Victoria played you? She promised you everything and gave you nothing but the desire to be a predator!"

Gabriel yanked at his chains, growling uselessly.
I didn't know what he hoped to achieve.
He wasn't going anywhere.
Alexander had made sure of that.
This dungeon would be the last thing Gabriel ever saw.

After Gabriel rejected me and shattered my heart, I questioned the Moon Goddess and her plans.
I questioned fate itself.
Wondering if it was just a concept invented to make people feel better about themselves and their future.
To give them false hope.
###Chapter 0161

I stood there, surrounded by them all.

Each man was tied to this mess.

We were all connected because of Athena.

Every single one of us.

My gaze fell on the beast that used to be Gabriel.

I didn't recognize his voice.

His scent was gone.

All I saw was rage and fury.

Was I always meant to be rejected by him?

Was this my destiny?

Was Zachary always supposed to enter my life?

I looked from Gabriel to Zachary.

“Are you okay?” Zachary whispered, frowning.

“Yes,” I muttered. “The smell is overwhelming. I need air.”

Liar, Midnight murmured.

Zachary moved to follow me.

I shook my head. “Stay. Help Alexander get answers. I’ve heard enough. I’ll be outside.”

His frown deepened, but he let me go.

I felt his eyes on my back as I hobbled away on the crutches.

I dropped onto the grass outside.

Rubbing my bandaged thigh, I lay back under the warm evening sun.

I had been angry at Gabriel for so long.

But standing in front of him now, I felt nothing for the man I once loved.

I had spent so much time trying to move on.

In reality, there was nothing to get over.

He had made his choice.

Someone dropped onto the grass beside me.

“Are you okay?” Theodore asked.

“Just questioning some things.”

“The Moon Goddess?” he asked curiously.

I propped myself up on my elbows and tilted my head. “How did you know?”

“I would too, in your position. And because I did.”

“Silver Creek wanted a contract long before they asked. They had already started turning humans. All because Ethan discovered Athena when she was a pup,” I told him.

He nodded. “I suspected as much. Have you considered that this might be the Moon Goddess’s plan? To right a wrong done to Athena’s family? To give her a better life?” He paused, putting his hands behind his head, staring at the sky. “I’ve had the same questions, Isabella. The Moon Goddess can’t control our lives—that’s free will. But she can alter our paths. Test us. Look at me. My parents bound me. If Alexander hadn’t brought me here, I’d still be living that miserable life. She put him in my path, and I’ve never regretted it.”

“Thanks, Theodore.” I smiled. “You’ve always been good at calming my mind when Midnight can’t.”

He winked and got to his feet. “Glad I could help. Need a hand up?”

“No. I’ll lie here and enjoy the evening sun a bit longer.”

Soon, Zachary’s scent hit me.

His frame blocked the sun as he stood over me.

“Did you fall?”

“No.”

“Need help?”

“No.”

“Give her a minute,” Julian shouted from nearby. “She’s weird like that.”

“I’m not weird,” I shouted back, remembering how Gabriel always called me a weirdo before roughly kissing me.

Zachary kept looking down at me with his dark eyes.

For a moment, I was glad he hadn’t marked me yet.

I didn’t need him hearing my thoughts.

He held out a hand as I sat up.

Pulling me to my feet easily, his large hands found my waist, holding me against him.

We hadn’t had much time alone since I woke up in the hospital.

The tension between us was palpable.

“Did he say anything else?” I asked quietly, bathing in his sweet vanilla scent.

“He’s going in circles. In some ways, he’s too far gone to have a coherent conversation. We’re only getting snippets of his thoughts.”

“Are you going to kill him?”

“No. Alexander wants him alive a bit longer. He wants Brianna to talk to Gabriel.”

“Brianna?”

“She was the one who helped me.”

I stumbled back, almost out of his grip, forgetting I needed crutches.

He kept his hands on my hips, stopping me from falling.

I don’t know why I didn’t see it sooner. “You fed on Wolves?”

“It’s not something I’m proud of,” he said, his voice low, dark eyes fixed on me.

“How? How were you able to turn back?”

“Desire.”
###Chapter 0162
Zachary

“Desire?” Her voice is a soft whisper, her gaze locked with mine.
“Yes.”

Her palms press against my chest, a small frown forming between her brows. “Desire for what?”
“To live.”

She glances down at her hand resting over my heart. It beats steadily beneath her touch. Yet her own pulse quickens. The wind catches her hair, scattering her scent around us.

“You were going to die?” A note of concern colors her voice.
“We all die eventually, Isabella. I mean I was tired of the same empty existence. Eat, sleep, hunt. Repeat. I craved something more.”

Her eyes lift back to mine. “And Brianna helped you?”
“She did. She offered me a home. Became a friend. Now she’s like a sister. She reminded me that becoming a beast didn’t mean I had to live like one. She still reminds me.”

“And you just changed?”
“No. It was a long process. Like a human breaking a drug addiction. It wasn’t easy.”

Her lips part slightly as she searches for words. “Oh.”
“Not what you expected?”
“I didn’t know what to expect,” she murmurs. “This whole year has been one surprise after another.”
“Are you afraid?” She hasn’t pushed away from me yet. Probably because her crutches lie in the grass several feet away.

She shakes her head and leans closer. “You need to stop assuming I am.”

I cup the back of her head, tilting her face up to mine. I breathe in her intoxicating scent. I could claim her right here. But something tells me she’d prefer privacy. Away from watching eyes. I settle for a kiss. My lips mold to hers. I savor her taste. Her subtle arousal fills the air.

I will make her mine permanently soon enough.

I slide a hand under her thighs and lift her. Ready to take her back to my place. But she lets out a sharp cry of pain. She nearly bites my lip. Her fingers dig into my sides as she squeezes her eyes shut.

“Sorry,” she mumbles when the pain subsides.
I frown. She shouldn’t apologize for something my brother did to her.
“Maybe I should just go lie down,” she mutters, scowling. Her frustration is palpable. “Spend some time with Athena.”
“Are you sure?”

She nods and waits for me to retrieve her crutches. I watch her hobble toward the packhouse.
Looking up, I see Brianna hovering nearby. Her arms are crossed. She stares at everything but me.

“Brianna? Do you need something?”
“That looked intense,” she mutters, catching up to me.
“Did it?” I reply, unamused.
“Come on, Zachary! You know it was. What’s it like having a mate?”
“Brianna, if you’re after gossip, I have nothing for you.” I know it won’t satisfy her. In the past, she admitted missing human gossip. Our way of life cost her that part of her humanity.

“Fine. What about Gabriel? How did it go with him?”
“Has Alexander not been to see you?”
“No. Why would he want to see me?”

I frown. He left the dungeons when I did. I thought he was heading to Brianna’s house to ask her to speak with him. Like we discussed.

“Maybe he got sidetracked.” I scan the grounds. No sign of him. But our pack is large. Any member could have distracted him.
###Chapter 0163

“What did he want? Did Alexander say anything about me? Was that the topic?” Her voice held a fragile hope.

“No. And you need to let this go regarding the Alpha. I’ve told you repeatedly. You have to step back.”

She moved directly in front of me, halting my progress. Her gaze was intense. “I can’t keep doing this, Zachary. It feels meaningless for me to be here. Perhaps I’m not suited for this life. Maybe it’s time we went our separate ways.”

“You are staying right here. I need you where I can protect you.”

A faint smile touched her lips. “I am not your mate, Zachary. You’ve found her.”

“You are my family.”

“Thirty days,” she whispered. “I’ll give it one more month. If she still refuses to speak with me, then I’m leaving.”

“Thirty days,” I agreed. A month was a long time. Anything could happen.

Isabella sat across the dining table, her eyes fixed on me. Periodically, she would catch her bottom lip between her teeth, her gaze drifting away. Her fingers tapped lightly on the wood as Alexander detailed the plans for my brother and the other traitor in the dungeons.

Theodore and Sebastian nodded along with his words.

“Both prisoners are scheduled for execution tomorrow at noon.” There would be no appeals. Alexander wanted them dealt with swiftly. Personally, I didn’t understand the delay. They weren’t going to be freed, regardless of any information they might give.

“Is everyone in agreement?” Alexander asked the group, but his focus remained on me.

“This is your pack, Alexander. The decision is yours. I won’t question your judgment.” I wouldn’t defend my brother. He lost that right the moment he sank his teeth into Isabella’s leg.

Theodore and Sebastian stared at me before voicing their agreement. They seemed surprised by my response. But what was the alternative? Save my brother and lose my mate forever? Leave the Alpha without my protection? That wasn’t an option. Especially not now.

“Could Brianna get anything from him?” It was the first time Athena had voluntarily asked about her. Perhaps there was still hope for them.

“No. She tried,” I replied. “Like I told Alexander, Gabriel is too far gone. There’s no humanity left in him. If he cared at all, he wouldn’t have attacked his former mate.”

Alpha Athena glanced down at her stomach, a frown forming.

“They won’t be like my brother,” I assured her. “I’ll make certain of that.”

“You believe they are Lycans?” Theodore asked me.

“What do you mean?” Isabella scowled. “We don’t know what they are yet. We probably won’t until they’re born. You can’t just assume.”

“I’m not assuming. I can tell you what they are right now.” My attention stayed on the Alpha.

Every eye in the room was on me, waiting.

“You… you can smell them?” Alpha Athena asked softly.

“Yes. For a few days now.”

“I can’t.” She looked at Alexander, who was still frowning, then back at me. “How… how is that possible?”

“The same way I tracked my brother through the forest. The same way I always located the other Rogues. I can smell Lycans.”
###Chapter 0164
Isabella

“Wait.” That was too much information all at once. “I have so many questions. So it wasn’t just because he was your brother?”

“It was both.” Zachary’s voice is low. “Even if he wasn’t my brother, I would’ve tracked him.”

“I didn’t think Lycans left a scent when they shifted.” I glance at Athena, who’s still staring down, a deep frown carved into her forehead. “I thought you found me because of me?”

The moment the words leave my mouth, I regret how needy they sound. Especially in front of everyone. Titan chuckles, which doesn’t help.

Zachary’s dark eyes lock on mine. I fight the heat rising up my neck.

“Of course we have a scent. It’s faint, but it’s there.” Zachary replies.

“Faint?” Alexander cuts in.

“What else do you want me to say, Alexander? Would you have preferred I couldn’t scent my own brother?”

“That’s not what I’m saying.” Alexander snaps back.

“Alpha Athena, tell them. Confirm that Lycans carry a scent even in shifted form.” Zachary looks to her for backup, but Athena is just staring at her stomach.

He nudges her gently. She looks up, blinking slowly as if pulling herself back into the conversation. “I can’t smell them. Why didn’t anyone tell me I was carrying Lycans?”

Zachary tilts his head. “I assumed you knew.”

Athena opens her mouth to speak, but no words come out. Instead, she stands abruptly and rushes from the room. Alexander is right behind her.

“To us, they smell like Wolves, but only in human form.” Sebastian explains. “When they shift, the scent vanishes.”

“And the Alpha? Is what she said true?”

“Yes.” Theodore confirms.

“She tracked me through the forest better than you or Alexander.” Zachary gestures toward Theodore. “She had to have known.”

Sebastian shakes his head. “She described it as a feeling—her legs carrying her without conscious thought. Not scent. Though she can scent you now, since you’ve pledged loyalty to her.”

‘We really need to ask him about that.’ Titan murmurs inside me.

“And Sophia.” Theodore adds. “She can scent Sophia, too.”

“I tried researching it.” Theodore says quietly. “There’s very little documented about your kind. We’re learning as we go.”

“Could it be related to her past… being bound?” I ask.

“Possibly.” Theodore replies. “Maybe not all of her abilities have fully surfaced yet.”

“Abilities?” Zachary’s interest sharpens.

“She can partially shift.” Sebastian tells him.

I watch Zachary’s eyes widen in surprise. “That’s new.”

“It did take a while for Nyx to show herself.” I add.

“Who is Nyx?” Zachary looks between us, clearly missing context.

“Athena’s Lycan spirit.” I frown. I thought he would’ve known this already. But then again, he was turned. Everything he knows, he learned. Just like Athena.

Sebastian explains it to him. Zachary nods slowly, absorbing the information.

“So all Alphas have this?” He asks.

“No. Only those born directly into the bloodline. So Alexander, me, and Julian in this pack.” I tell him. “And Athena, obviously.”

“That explains who you were speaking with in the forest. What about the traitor in the dungeon? Does he have an inner spirit?”

“No. His father took over as Alpha years ago but wasn’t blood-related to the original Alpha.”

“But you won’t become an Alpha? Neither will Julian?”

“Julian and I have a different mother than Alexander. The gene still passed to us. And I’m glad I won’t be Alpha. I don’t want that responsibility.”

“Everyone, as fascinating as this is, we’re getting off track.” Sebastian interjects sharply.

Zachary leans back in his chair. His dark eyes haven’t left me, a faint smile playing on his lips. Why is it that every time he learns something new about me, we’re surrounded by other people? He could say how he truly feels. But he doesn’t. It’s as if his words are meant for my ears only.
###Chapter 0165

“The purpose of this meeting was to determine my brother’s future. Am I right?” Zachary says quietly. “It’s been settled. So we’re finished here?”

“Yes,” Sebastian replies.

“Good. If you’ll excuse me, I have matters to attend to.”

Zachary moves around the table and picks up my crutches. He holds them out without a word. He simply waits.

I rise slowly and take them from him. With a slight tilt of his head, he signals toward the door.

He walks ahead but slows his pace, letting me catch up. “Where are we going?”

“Someplace private. Just you and me.” His voice is deep and full of intention.

He leads me to the hospital. It isn’t exactly the location I would have chosen, but at least we’ll be alone.

As we approach, I notice his expression shift. The desire in his eyes vanishes completely. “Wait here.”

“Why? I thought we—”

“The girl. She’s inside the hospital.”

“Sophia?” I call out as he rushes forward. Why would she be here? She hasn’t had any episodes since she first arrived.

He stops outside the doors and glances back at me before going in. A moment later, a rush of air nearly knocks me over as my twin charges past me into the building.

I make my way inside. The metallic scent of blood hits me. My brother is screaming at Zachary. “What the hell did you do to her?!”

“She was already like this when I found her.”

“You’re a fucking liar. I told my brother we shouldn’t trust you.” Julian is pointing a scalpel at Zachary.

“Julian, he was with me,” I shout.

“Don’t defend this bastard just because he’s your mate!”

“You can confirm it with Sebastian and Theodore. We were in a meeting with Alexander. We just left the house.” I try to reason with him.

“Bullshit. We should have killed you along with your bitch.”

Alexander, hospital! I link my brother, hoping he arrives quickly.

I step forward enough to see Sophia around the corner. Her body is sprawled on the floor. There was no chance of saving her. Not when her heart had been ripped from her chest.

Alexander arrives with Theodore. I watch Alexander’s eyes move between all of us before landing on Sophia.

“Check the dungeon,” Zachary mutters, still squared off against Julian. “I smell him.”

“That’s impossible. He can’t escape.”

“I’m telling you, Alexander. He was here. If you tell your brother to stand down, I can examine the girl and confirm whether it was him.”

“He’s lying! He admitted he used to be a Rogue. He’s playing us!” Julian thrusts the scalpel toward Zachary. Zachary moves out of the way with ease.

“He’s going to ruin everything, and you’re letting him near Athena.”

I knew Julian would be upset. Probably too upset to think straight. But what did he hope to accomplish with a scalpel? Especially since Zachary could heal instantly.

“Go!” Alexander snaps at Theodore. He turns to Julian. “Let him examine her.”

“You’re taking his side?” Julian spits.

“I’m on the side of finding the truth.” Alexander remains calm as Julian tries to swing at Zachary again.

“Julian, stand down. That’s an order.”

He throws the scalpel to the floor and steps back, but his eyes remain locked on my mate. “I will fucking kill you!”

Zachary ignores him as he carefully moves around Sophia. He crouches and leans over her. Without touching her, he breathes in the scents around her.

He frowns and shakes his head as he straightens up. “I don’t understand.”

“What? What is it?” Alexander demands.

“I think he shifted.”
###Chapter 0166
Alexander

“You said—”

“I know, Alexander. I know exactly what I said.” Zachary’s voice cuts through the air, sharp and impatient. His face is a mask of tension, deep lines of frustration carved into his brow. “He never wanted to shift back. I didn’t even think it was possible. Do you have any idea how difficult it was for me?”

“What are you talking about?” Isabella demands, her voice tight.

“I told you it wasn’t easy. The process took time. I would wake up in Lycan form in the middle of a cornfield, having shifted in my sleep. It’s not something you can just undo. Not when you’ve started to see yourself as a monster.”

“Just full of secrets, aren’t you!” Julian mutters, shoving Zachary aside.

He drops to his knees, gathering Sophia’s lifeless body into his arms. The devastation on his face is unmistakable. This is the deepest loss he’s felt since our parents. Nothing else has ever cut this deep.

‘We need to watch him closely.’ Titan’s voice rumbles in my mind.

‘Agreed,’ I reply silently.

‘Maybe this is what he needs,’ Titan adds.

‘What are you talking about?’

‘He’s spent his whole life only caring about himself.’

‘That’s harsh. How would you feel if Athena—’ Shit. Athena.

I quickly mindlink several guards, ordering them to secure the perimeter of the house.

“Let’s assume he’s escaped.” Though walking out shouldn’t have been possible. “How did he shift?” I ask Zachary.

“I don’t know. He hasn’t been human in over a year. And like I said, he never wanted to change back. Trust me, I tried to help him. Brianna did too. He never wanted it. The only explanation is that he’s been shifting for a while now. He must have kept it hidden.”

‘Alexander.’ Theodore’s voice echoes in my head. ‘He’s gone.’

‘What?’

‘He isn’t here. According to Ethan, he did shift back to human form.’

‘How the hell did he get out?’ I snap.

The Rogue had been chained to a wall.

If he shifted, he could have slipped the chains. That much I understand.

But the cell was still locked.

The only way out was if someone physically let him out.

Not to mention, he wouldn’t have been able to just walk away. I saw what Athena did to his leg.

If we believe Ethan, he’s also claiming that Sophia was the one who helped Gabriel escape.

I glance at Julian, sitting silently on the floor. He’s gently stroking Sophia’s red hair.

Why would she help Gabriel? It makes no sense. She loved Athena. She stood against the woman who changed her, all to protect Athena.

“I’m right, aren’t I?” Zachary asks. “I can see it on your face. And I know what I scent. I am right.”

“Is he?” Isabella presses. “Has Gabriel escaped? Has he shifted? Is he out there, moving through the pack like he belongs here?”

“Yes.”

“No.” Zachary cuts me off. “He wouldn’t be that stupid. He’ll hunker down somewhere. Somewhere he can hide in plain sight. Watching. Waiting. He’ll work carefully, spreading his scent throughout the entire pack.”

“This is your fault!” Julian snarls from the floor. “You! He came here because of you. You’d better sleep with one eye open, Lycan.”

Zachary doesn’t respond. He’s quiet, deep in thought, completely unbothered by my brother’s threat.

‘You’re hiding something.’ Isabella’s voice whispers through our mindlink.

I look over at her. Her arms are crossed tightly over her chest as she stares at me. ‘I know you, Alexander. There’s something you’re not saying.’

‘According to Ethan, Sophia let him out.’

“WHAT?!” she shouts aloud, forgetting to keep the conversation private.

Everyone turns to look at her. She quickly drops her gaze.

“What’s going on?” Zachary asks, stepping closer to my sister.

“Sorry,” Isabella mumbles.

“Look, I don’t know if it’s true. All we have is Ethan’s word, and he’s not exactly known for his honesty.”

“He saw him shift?” Zachary frowns.

“And he saw who let him out. Which I’m taking with a grain of salt!”

“Let me guess. She did.” He points at Sophia. “I can’t scent anyone else on her.”
###Chapter 0167

“No!” Julian snaps. “She wouldn’t do that. She would never risk her own life! She just turned sixteen.”

“Maybe, maybe not. She could have been tricked into freeing him.” Zachary shrugs.

“Are you saying he has some kind of power to attract people?” I ask.

“How else do you think they killed so easily in that town? No humans escaped. Bodies appeared everywhere. Most would flee if that happened, but they stayed. They walked right to their deaths. I only started bringing them food after the town was empty.” Zachary shakes his head, his gaze fixed on my sister. “But she would’ve had to be down there already.”

“Stop talking about her! Just stop!” Julian shouts. “She’s still here.”

Isabella hobbles over on her crutches. “Julian. I’m so sorry, but she’s gone. We can’t bring her back.”

Julian growls and shoves her backward. He sweeps up Sophia’s bloody body and holds her tight against his chest. He storms out of the hospital as Zachary helps Isabella back up.

“We should go after him.” She whimpers, her face tight with pain.

“He needs space. He just lost his mate.”

“But he—”

“Isabella, give him space.”

“You can’t help him right now.” Zachary speaks softly. “This is something he has to face alone.”

She nods slowly as he tries to put an arm around her. I watch her shrug him off with a frown.

“What does he look like in human form?” I ask. I never got to meet Gabriel before he rejected my sister.

“I’m not sure now. He used to have chestnut eyes, but the ones I saw were like black holes.” Isabella whispers. “His hair matched his eyes.” A faint smile touches her lips.

“He had a tattoo on his neck.” Zachary adds.

“Like yours?”

He nods. “A family trait.”

“About six feet tall. He had a wide smile.”

Zachary growls as she continues describing him. Again, she moves away when he tries to touch her shoulder. The news about luring humans to their death clearly disturbed her.

I send a mental link to the whole pack. I remind them that our only guests are Zachary and Brianna. Anyone else is to be eliminated on sight.

“Stay in the house, Isabella.”

“You think he’ll come for me again?”

“I don’t know, but this way I’ll know where you are.”

She nods, glancing back at the pool of blood where Sophia had been. “Do you want me to tell Athena?”

“No. That should come from me.”

Isabella hobbles out of the hospital.

Zachary follows closely behind.

She’s already snapping at him to stay away.

Their bond is off to a much rockier start than mine and Athena’s.

I hang back, not wanting to get involved.

I clean up the blood, trying to figure out how to break the news to Athena.

The twins are already taking a toll on her.

This might push her over the edge.

By the time I return to the packhouse, Zachary and Isabella are having a full-blown argument in the foyer.

I sidestep around them and follow my mate’s scent to the kitchen.

She rolls her beautiful blue eyes at me as she eats toast.

When she sees my face, she lowers the toast and scowls. “Why is there blood on you?”

“He got out.”

“Ethan?”

I shake my head.

“How?”

I explain our theory. Still not mentioning Sophia.

“I can find him.” She mutters, brushing crumbs from her hands.

“No. He’ll be smarter this time. Zachary is sure of it.”

She shifts on the chair, her brow furrowed. “How did he get out? He could barely walk, if he could walk at all.”

“We have reason to believe Sophia let him out.”

“No. She wouldn’t... she...” Her voice trails off as her blue eyes meet mine. “She’s dead, isn’t she?”
###Chapter 0168
Isabella

“Don’t you dare tell me how to feel.” I thrust one crutch toward Zachary.

“Isabella, I stopped doing that. It’s been a long time.”

“What if a deer isn’t enough? What if what we hunt isn’t satisfying? Will you disappear into the city again? Will you lure some human to their death? I can’t handle that. I won’t.”

“My brother might be losing his mind over his dead mate. My pregnant friend just got terrible news. And my ex is still out there, probably coming to finish what he started with my leg. So don’t tell me how to feel!”

My chest heaved. My heart pounded under his stare. It was all too much. The secrets. The half-truths. Was this my life now?

“Isabella…”

“Stop. Just stop.” I slammed a crutch down, nearly stumbling.

I’m furious too! Midnight snarled.

Zachary’s eyes narrowed.

I dropped my shoulders. “There’s nothing you can say. I just…can’t do this right now.”

I turned to hobble away. He grabbed me, spinning me back as the crutches clattered to the floor. “You don’t walk away. We fix this now. Before either of us leaves.”

“You don’t decide that.” I pushed against his chest, but he held firm.

His dark eyes scanned my face. His grip didn’t loosen. After a long moment, he spoke. “Fine. Walk away.”

I couldn’t move. Maybe I didn’t want to.

“Not so easy, is it?” His whisper brushed my ear.

“Promise me. Swear you’ll never lure a human. Swear you’ll never feed on one again.”

“You didn’t need to ask. But I give you my word.” His lips touched the corner of mine.

I closed my eyes, breathing in his scent. Letting my doubts fade. Losing myself as his kiss deepened. His hands slid under my shirt. Rough fingertips grazed my skin, pulling me closer.

He broke away, his face inches from mine. “There’s only one thing I’m hungry for, Isabella.”

My name on his tongue sent shivers down my spine.

His lips pressed against my neck, moving slowly to my ear. Each kiss sparked through me. When his teeth grazed my ear, I gasped.

It had been so long since I’d felt anything. Zachary made me feel everything with just a touch.

I could be angry. It didn’t faze him.

“I need you safe, Isabella.” He murmured between kisses. “I need to know where you are. Always.”

His teeth grazed my skin as he moved to my collarbone.

“You want to claim me?” I whispered.

“I want you to be mine. Now and forever.”

His teeth sank into my flesh. Primal energy took over. His grip tightened. I knew there would be bruises.

One hand left my back, tangling in my hair. He pulled my head back, sinking his teeth deeper.

I winced, but the pain faded into longing. A deep craving for more. It even overshadowed the pain in my leg.

“You want more?” He mused, pulling back to cup me through my shorts.

He could feel how wet I was. The thin fabric hid nothing.

A quick flick of his finger made my legs buckle. If not for the shorts, he would’ve been inside me.

“My room is upstairs and—”
###Chapter 0169

“I’m aware.” His teeth graze my earlobe once more before he lifts me effortlessly, draping me over his shoulder. He snatches my crutches with his free hand.

Zachary takes the stairs two at a time, his palm cupping my rear, fingertips pressing firmly against my aching core.

“Alone at last.” He sets me down gently, his hand immediately tangling in my hair. He pulls me into a searing kiss. A low growl vibrates from his chest.

He releases my hair, yanking my tee over my head and tossing it aside. His gaze sweeps over my black lace bra, lingering on the jagged scar running from my right shoulder down to my breast.

“How did this happen?” His voice is hushed.

“A long time ago. I barely recall.”

He traces the scar with a feather-light touch. “You have Alpha blood. Your healing is swift.”

“It was before I had Nyx. I fell on glass, I think. I was five or six.”

He doesn’t answer. Instead, his lips follow the path of the scar, leaving trails of fire in their wake.

His fingers brush over my nipples through the lace. They harden instantly. He leans down, sucking each one through the fabric. The heat of his tongue makes them ache.

A moan escapes me. He tugs the bra down, taking a bare nipple into his mouth, teasing it with his teeth.

I ache for his touch lower, between my thighs, but he denies me. He draws out the tension until I’m dripping with need.

He pulls off his own shirt, revealing sculpted muscle and intricate tribal tattoos that cascade over his shoulders and chest, vanishing beneath his jeans.

He presses against me, his hard length straining against his jeans, nudging my thigh.

His hand finally slips into my shorts, but he only circles two fingers above my entrance.

“Zachary.” I whisper, arching back in frustration. I need him inside me. I need release.

He slows his movements. “Patience.” He nips my jaw, sending shivers through me.

A deep moan escapes as I grind against his hand. He stills, cupping me firmly. I wish I wore nothing.

His lips return to the fresh mark on my neck, teeth scraping gently. As another moan slips out, he shifts my thong aside and drives one finger in, then a second, a third.

Zachary holds me tight as my body convulses against him. Waves of pleasure crash over me.

As my hips slow to a gentle rock, he strips off my shorts and thong.

He lifts me, carrying me to the ottoman at the foot of my bed. Sitting, he pulls me onto his lap, facing away.

Spreading his legs, he carefully places mine over his, leaving me exposed.

We’re positioned before the full-length mirror. I watch my own slickness glistening between my thighs.

His hand glides over me, a finger tracing my folds before plunging deep. He growls as my wetness coats his hand, his thumb circling my clit.

“So fucking wet.” He murmurs in my ear, biting my lobe.

My head falls back against his shoulder.

“Watch.” He commands, forcing my head up.

In the mirror, his fingers are buried inside me. His other hand pinches my nipples, squeezing roughly as he thrusts relentlessly, thumb pressed firmly on my clit.

I can’t keep my head from rolling back. My back arches away from his chest as my climax crashes over me. He stills, letting me ride the most intense orgasm I’ve ever experienced until I collapse against him, completely spent.

“Oh, I’m just getting started, love.”
###Chapter 0170
Athena

“Where did he take her?” I demand, stepping out into the pitch-black night.

Adrenaline surged through me, sharp and urgent.

I had no idea what time it was.

Several guards moved closer, their attention fixed on the surrounding shadows.

“I don’t know,” Alexander muttered, grabbing my wrist to stop me. “Just let him be. There’s nothing you can do.”

“Maybe I can save her.”

“Athena, she isn't dying. She isn't hanging on by a thread. She’s dead. Gabriel tore her heart out.”

My stomach dropped.

A part of me had hoped he was wrong. That Julian had taken Sophia to find a way to help her.

“He took… He took her heart?”

“Among slicing her up pretty badly.”

I felt Nyx’s sorrow merge with my own.

Sophia was just a kid.

She was family.

She was like me.

She had helped me understand what I could do.

“Why?” A single tear rolled down my cheek.

I didn’t try to stop the flood that followed.

I was so angry.

“Why would he do that to her?”

“I don’t know. I thought his end game was to get at Zachary, but he has nothing to do with Sophia.”

“You said she let him out.”

“According to Ethan.”

‘We can speak to him!’ Nyx murmured. ‘We need to know why Sophia was down there!’

I nodded in agreement and repeated the words to Alexander.

“No. I need you to stay in the house.” He tried to tug me back inside.

I slapped his hand away.

“Athena, we don’t know where he is. We don't know if his plan is to come after you next, or Zachary, even Isabella.”

“Or Brianna,” I muttered, watching her stumble toward us.

Her arms clung tightly against her stomach.

Blood spilled profusely over her hands.

She couldn’t walk straight, almost like she was drunk.

“Shit. Don’t move.” He charged over to her and lifted her from the ground.

‘It’s Gabriel,’ I heard her mutter.

As Alexander brought her closer, I saw her dirty blonde hair was stained with blood.

Parts of her intestines hung loosely from her body.

My stomach flipped.

I fought the urge to gag.

Apparently, I could handle holding a heart, but intestines were just too much.

Alexander brought her inside.

His eyes glazed over as he dropped her onto the table.

I just stood there, watching.

She was probably on the verge of death.

Not a single part of me cared.

She should have died instead of Sophia.

“Let me see,” I heard Alexander tell her.

She removed her arms.

If she were upright, all the organs of her abdomen would have fallen out.

Zachary was right behind her.

He grabbed Brianna’s hand, holding it against his own chest.

“Hold on. Just hold on.” His dark eyes flickered to me. “Don’t let her die. She doesn’t deserve this.”

It took me far too long to realize Isabella was waiting for me to say something.

To give her the go-ahead to save another Lycan.

Because technically, Alexander wasn’t their leader.

I was.

But was I cruel enough to say no after what she did to me?

Was I cruel enough to let her suffer a long and painful death?

Nyx was oddly quiet, too.

“Save her,” Alexander muttered before I could make my decision. “Athena is my mate. We both lead this pack, and she is my guest. Save her, Isabella.”

“I need supplies from the hospital,” Isabella murmured as she inspected Brianna’s open wound.
###Chapter 0171

“What do you need?” Alexander and Zachary ask at the same time.

Isabella starts writing a list as I watch Brianna fade out of consciousness.

“Hurry. But stay alert—we don’t know where Gabriel is.” She murmurs as the men vanish through the back door.

Isabella cleans Brianna’s stomach carefully, preparing for whatever comes next. I can’t move. I was this close to getting my revenge for what she did to me. And yet, I couldn’t say the words.

“Alexander will never forgive me if she dies.” Isabella whispers, carefully pushing intestines back into the open wound.

My eyes lift toward her, but she isn’t looking at me. She’s completely focused on saving Brianna.

If I stop her from helping Brianna, it could break her matebond with Alexander. She would hate me for destroying her chance at happiness. I couldn’t lose my only friend.

“Can you save her?” I ask quietly.

“I think so.” She gives me a tense smile. “The upper wound has already healed—that’s a good sign. But her stomach might be like my leg. I won’t know until I can see properly inside.”

She sighs. “I know you have history with her, Athena. I know a thousand thoughts are racing through your mind right now. But this is what I chose. Saving lives has always been my dream. Please don’t make me abandon her.”

It's your choice. I will stand by you no matter what you decide. Nyx murmurs softly.

“Is there anything I can do to help?” Forcing the words out was harder than I expected.

Isabella offers a faint smile. “Give me your hand.”

She takes my hand and places it gently on Brianna’s neck. “Normally I would listen for her pulse, but it’s unclear. Her body is under extreme trauma—you have to trust what you feel. Do you feel it?”

I nod.

“Tell me if anything changes. Even the slightest flutter.”

The men return after what feels like an eternity. They’re accompanied by Sebastian, Theodore, and Sebastian’s boys. The boys’ eyes go wide when they see Brianna, but Sebastian guides them quickly past and into another part of the house. I hear one of them ask if the woman on the table is dead.

I watch Isabella work. She is patient. Calm. Completely in her element. The only sounds come from her movements.

“Now it’s up to her.” She steps back, examining her work. Brianna was lucky. There was enough tissue that once everything was back in place, it began knitting itself together.

I stumble out of the kitchen, still in disbelief that I let her live.

Alexander’s hand catches mine, stopping me. “Talk to me, Athena.”

“There’s nothing to say.”

“You were going to let her die.”

“But I didn’t, did I?” The words come out sharp. “I… I helped.”

His hands move to my shoulders. “I wish you would talk to me more.”

“I do talk to you.”

“Not lately. You’ve been short-tempered. When you’re not, it only lasts five minutes before you snap. No matter how many times I ask, Nyx keeps blocking me from reading your mind. I can’t help if you shut me out.”

His crimson eyes hold mine, making me feel small and exposed.

I open my mouth to speak, but the words vanish before they can be heard.
###Chapter 0172
Alexander

"Athena?"

She goes quiet. Her mouth hangs slightly open as she stares back at me. "Can we please find Sophia and Julian? I know she's gone. I just... I need to say goodbye."

"You're avoiding this." I murmur.

"I have to handle one thing at a time." She frowns, her voice barely audible. "Please?" The word seems to catch in her throat as tears well in her blue eyes.

I reach out to my brother through our link. He doesn't respond right away. But I can feel his agony radiating through our connection.

Julian, where are you?' I try again.

Leave me alone!'

Julian!' I snap through the mental bond.

Go to hell!'

Don't you dare speak to me like that! Where are you?'

You let them come here. You invited them into our home.' His fury through the link intensifies to levels I've never experienced before.

Julian, where are you?'

Far away from you.' He snaps back. 'You put her in danger and I'll never forgive you for that!" He takes a sharp breath. "I, Julian Black, former Gamma of Obsidian Howl pack, sever all ties with Obsidian Howl effective immediately."

BASTARD! Titan roars within me.

I feel our connection shatter just as Isabella screams out in pain. She would feel it too - he was rejecting her as his twin as well.

Athena's eyes widen as she watches me, waiting for an explanation.

"He's rejected the pack. He's gone. And he took Sophia's body with him." I say, frustration evident in my voice.

She fights back tears. "What does that mean? Why would he abandon the pack?"

"He blames me for Sophia's death."

"Where would he go?"

"I don't know." My expression hardens. "But he made his choice. He'll have to live with it."

"You're giving up on him just like that?" She asks, shocked.

"He doesn't want my help, Athena. He doesn't want his sister's help either."

Athena glances toward the kitchen door where we can both hear Isabella sobbing. Tears she hasn't shed in years are probably streaming down her face.

"Go to her." Athena whispers gently. "She's your sister."

I extend my hand to her. "Are you coming with me?"

She looks up at me, a small smile touching her lips. "Maybe today doesn't have to be completely terrible." She takes my hand and places it on her slight bump. I can feel movement beneath my palm. Subtle, like gentle flutters, but definitely movement. It's enough to keep me focused as I prepare to comfort Isabella.

Isabella, as expected, is crying uncontrollably. She's on the floor, clinging to Zachary as if her life depends on it. He's speaking to her, but even I can tell his words aren't getting through.

"Will someone please tell me what's happening?!" Theodore demands.

"Julian has rejected the pack. He's severed all ties with us." I explain.

"Are you serious?"

"He blames me." I mutter.

"He should blame himself." Theodore retorts. "He was the one who insisted you bring in other Alphas. If Ethan had never come here, Sophia wouldn't have been kidnapped. You wouldn't have had to go after her. You wouldn't have..." He gestures toward Zachary and an unconscious Brianna.

It's unusual for Theodore to sound so irritated.

"I'm just saying, we're all in this together. It's not his battle alone."

"Did he say something to you?" I ask, narrowing my eyes.

He looks away.

"Theodore?!"

"He's been making his displeasure known since the Rogue first appeared."

"To whom?"

"Mostly me." He crosses his arms over his chest. "I tried, Alexander. I tried to make him see that he started this. That if he really looked for someone to blame, he could find fault anywhere."

"Why didn't you come to me?"

"I honestly thought I had it under control. He stopped bringing it up. I thought maybe he was finally understanding that some things are beyond our control. Then Sophia... I'm sorry. I messed up."

I raise a hand to stop him, focusing on my distraught sister. "Has she said anything?"

Zachary shakes his head.

"Isabella, I know you're hurting. Julian made his choice. You couldn't have changed his mind. No one could have." I glance back at Theodore, who sighs.

She remains silent. Her eyes are glazed over as she stares at a spot on Zachary's shirt, unmoving, unblinking, while large tears roll down her cheeks. Maybe Midnight was trying to offer comfort, but then again, Midnight had lost her twin too.

"I'll take her upstairs." Zachary murmurs, rising to his feet with Isabella cradled in his arms.

"I think I'll rest too." Athena murmurs, her eyes shifting to Brianna though she says nothing more.

I stop her before she leaves. "Tell Nyx to drop the block."

She nods, and her eyes briefly darken. I can feel all her emotions flooding back in. I never thought the day would come when I wouldn't feel normal because I couldn't feel my mate's emotions. Somehow, after all these years of searching, she was the only one who made me feel complete.

In that moment, I understood Julian's reaction. He had gone from woman to woman until he found a mate who made him rethink everything because she was too young for him to act on it. Grief had hit him like a physical blow.

"Is she okay?" I ask Theodore about Brianna as Athena leaves.

"It was close according to Isabella. He sliced her stomach up pretty badly but somehow, she didn't lose much tissue. Isabella was able to repair the damage. It might just take a while for her to wake up." He pauses. "I'm sorry, Alexander."

"If I had known it would come to this, I would have told you." He adds.

"I know. It's in the past. What we have now is a Rogue on the loose. And I have no idea who its next target will be. Did Ethan say anything about the Rogues' plans?"

He shakes his head. "I would say Lycans, but it went after Isabella first." He shrugs. "Maybe it's targeting anyone who's vulnerable because it doesn't seem like it's here just to anger Zachary anymore."

"No, but what else do the first two victims have in common?"

"Athena, but that doesn't explain Brianna." He gestures to the unconscious woman on the kitchen table.

"Death." Brianna mutters hoarsely, her eyes still closed. "He wants to bring death to everyone."
###Chapter 0173
Zachary

Her fingers stay locked with mine as I place her gently on the mattress. Isabella doesn’t utter a word. Tears still stream down her cheeks in heavy, silent waves.

The agony she’s feeling is brutal. Until now, I hadn’t realized that losing a twin could cut as deep as losing a mate.

It didn’t matter that he was still breathing. He had turned his back on the pack. That meant turning his back on her, too.

And it shattered her completely.

Did he feel this same emptiness? Or was he too lost in his own grief over an unclaimed mate? Either way, I don’t think I can ever forgive him for what he’s done to Isabella.

She cries until exhaustion pulls her under. Dried blood from helping Brianna still marks her skin. Even in sleep, she whimpers softly before finally going still.

I clean her carefully. She doesn’t stir. I hope my touch offers some comfort. She’s been through hell these past few days. She didn’t need this on top of everything.

I slip out of her room and head for the stairs. I pause outside the Alpha’s door when I catch her scent. I can hear her pacing softly inside.

“I know you’re out there,” she says. “Come in.”

She doesn’t stop moving when I enter. Her hands are on her hips. A deep frown marks her face.

“Athena, you should be resting. Especially after tonight,” I say quietly, my gaze drifting to her rounded stomach. Those twins had to survive. They were vital to our future.

“Zachary, stop calling me Alpha. I’m fine. How is Isabella?”

“Asleep.”

“You’ve marked her. Tell me how she really feels.”

“Like her heart’s been torn out. She’s in deep pain.”

She nods, still pacing. “I’m going to kill him, Zachary.”

“Julian?”

“You know I’m not talking about Julian.” She stops and pins me with a look. “Are you going to try and stop me?”

“No.” There was a time I might have. When packs and Alphas meant nothing to me.

“Good.” She grabs a jacket from the closet. “Let’s go.”

“Right now? Even I know that’s reckless.”

“You said you wouldn’t stop me.”

“I’m not stopping you. I’m suggesting we pick a better time. When emotions aren’t running the show. I’ve seen people make huge mistakes when they let feelings take over.”

She rolls her eyes and drops onto the bed.

“He’s causing chaos. You almost lost your friend. Your mate. How are you so calm?”

“Practice. You wouldn’t believe what I was like before I became Lycan.”

She smirks lightly. “What, some kind of mass murderer?”

“For those who deserved it.”

Color drains from her face, but her blue eyes gleam with curiosity. “That’s why she turned you.”

I nod. “She thought I’d be a good asset to her little club.”

“Humans, I assume? Before you were turned?”

“Yes.”

“How many?”

“I lost count.” I shrug. The number of monsters I ended meant nothing compared to the lives I saved.

“Fifty?”

“No.”

“A hundred?”

“That’s when I stopped counting.”

“What do you mean, ‘those who deserved it’?”

“Those who hurt children. Young women. If I had known what Victoria and Dominic were doing to you, I would have torn them apart myself.”

“Is that why you’re loyal to me now? Because you feel you owe me?”

“Yes.”

“Have you told Isabella about your past?”

“No. Nobody wants to hear that.”

“You should tell her. You’ve claimed her. How do you think she’ll feel if she finds out you kept a secret like that? Trust me, I know what it’s like to have your whole life built on lies.”
###Chapter 0174

Athena bites her lower lip, her eyes narrowing into slits. "You could have ended him. But you held back. You deliberately avoided his heart even after what he did to Isabella."

"That was an emotional decision."

"Because some part of you still believed your old brother existed beneath it all?"

I remain silent. No answer was necessary. The topic needed changing. "Why do you refuse to be called Alpha?"

"It's not just you. I hate when anyone uses that title."

"But you use it when required. Like when you confronted Gabriel. And I heard you used it to stop the other Lycans from attacking Obsidian Howl."

A faint crease forms on her forehead. "I was forced to address people by status my entire life. Disobedience meant punishment. Even with Alexander, I kept doing it for too long. I won't force that on others. It makes me sound..."

"More powerful than the rest of us? Because we all know you are."

Her gaze lifts to meet mine. "It makes me sound like a power-hungry asshole."

I can't help but laugh.

"Alexander mentioned you resisted your Alpha position at first. Maybe it's time you reclaim everything taken from you."

She lets out an involuntary snort.

"Is that it, Zachary? Is that why you're really here? To convince me to become something I'm not?"

"No. I can't convince you of something you're already questioning. And I don't need to convince you of your power. You already know it."

"I haven't been questioning anything."

"Right." I mutter, knowing she's lying. I've seen it in her actions. Her need to fix what's broken.

"Let's test your theory." she says quietly. "How exactly am I supposed to lead two bitten Lycans and a Rogue?"

"You're not seeing it."

"What?"

"Those are signs our kind will thrive again." I gesture toward her stomach. "What if there are more? What if they're all in hiding?"

She laughs and shakes her head. "That's insane."

"You didn't know we existed until Alexander and Julian found us. You didn't know you were Lycan. What if there are others? What if some escaped Victoria and Dominic?"

"Just stop." Athena snaps, raising her hand. Her eyes close. When they reopen, the blue has vanished, replaced by near-black darkness. Isabella mentioned this happens when Athena communes with her inner Lycan.

"You want to find more?" she asks after a long pause.

"Wouldn't it be better for the twins to have more of their kind to help raise them?"

"You need to leave." she whispers.

I don't argue. I turn and leave immediately when she asks.

Downstairs, Brianna recounts her ordeal to the others. Her eyes meet mine as I enter, and she offers a bright smile.

"I'm alive."

"Why did that bastard come after you?"

"I was telling them he showed up at my house. I was so shocked to see him in human form that I reacted too slowly. He shifted and..." She gestures to the deep, bleeding wound on her stomach.

"Did he say anything?"

"That he wants us all dead. I know I said he's crazy. But he's in full demon mode now. Talking about making everything his. That we'll bow to him."

Alexander laughs. "If he wants to kill us all, how exactly are we supposed to bow to him?!"

"It's a choice." Theodore mutters with a frown. "He's saying bow down or die."

"Then he picked the wrong pack to attack." Alexander snarls.
###Chapter 0175
Isabella

I knew instantly I was alone.
Zachary had brought me upstairs but he was gone.
Maybe he regretted claiming me after seeing me break down like a child.

My chest felt shattered.
Each breath grew more difficult, as if my lungs were collapsing under an invisible weight.

'Our twin bond is breaking.' Midnight whispers.
She was suffering just as much as I was.
Being a twin was agony at times.
This pain surpassed my injured leg.
It hurt more than being rejected.

'He's truly gone.' I murmur to Midnight.

'Yes.' she whimpers as another tear escapes.
I quickly wipe it away.
He had made his choice.
He hadn't hesitated for even a moment.

Zachary had left my crutches near the bed.
Grabbing them, I hobble to the windows and pull back the curtain.

I freeze.
The curtain slips from my hand, concealing what I'd just seen.
Slowly, I pull it back again.
A bloody handprint stained the outside glass.
How?
I didn't have a balcony, and it was a straight drop to the ground.

My eyes scan the grounds below.
Nothing moved.
Everything was quiet.
I assume Alexander has ordered everyone indoors.
But that handprint looked fresh.

'Don't open the window.' Midnight warns.

'I wasn't planning to.'

'Really? Since when do you leave things alone?' She snaps.
She was angry.
We both were.
But taking it out on me wasn't helping.

"Aspen should have tried to stop him! I'm hurting too! You lost your twin, I lost mine. We can't change that. Now can we please focus on this?" I was desperately trying to bury the pain.
Maybe if one of us stayed strong, it would help us feel somewhat normal.

'Check the other window.' she mutters reluctantly.

There's only a partial print on the other window.
"Do you think he was trying to break in?"

'If he wanted to break in, he would have. Like at the hospital. Call Alexander.'

I nod but sink onto the bed.
'Why does he keep coming after me?'

'I don't know. But sitting here waiting like an idiot won't help either of us.'

I'm relieved when Zachary's sweet vanilla scent fills the room.
It means he's nearby.
He doesn't bother knocking.
He pushes the door open, his dark eyes meeting mine before shifting to the bloody handprints.

He frowns and strides toward the windows.
His expression darkens into a scowl.
He yanks one window open, leaning out to examine the wall between them.
"Bastard!"

Zachary slams the window shut with such force I fear the glass will shatter.
He turns to me.
"Did you see him?"

"No. I just opened the curtains and they were there. Why me?"

"Brianna shared some intel last night. I thought you'd be safe here. No fire escape. No balcony. I wouldn't have left you alone if I thought he could reach you."

"He didn't," I murmur. "But I wish you hadn't left."

He closes the distance between us.
His lips crash against mine with fierce intensity.
His hand locks behind my head.
His tongue explores my mouth as his weight pushes me backward onto the bed until he's pressed fully against me.

He forces himself between my thighs, ignoring my small whimper of pain.
His kiss grows more urgent.
I feel him hardening against me.
He rocks his hips, ensuring his demanding cock presses right where I need it.

His lips travel to my jaw, then my neck.
His teeth scrape along my skin, pulling soft moans from me.
My underwear dampens with my own arousal.

He lifts my top.
His tongue circles each nipple, nipping as they harden.

A burning heat ignites deep inside me, spreading outward.
I try to ignore it, but Zachary's bites drive me wild.
The heat continues to grow, an insistent itch demanding to be scratched.

"I think..." I mutter as he pulls down my sweatpants and underwear.

"I know. Good thing I'm here, then." He leans down and runs his tongue along my slit.

Stars explode behind my eyelids.
His tongue delves deeper.
Every time he flicks my clit, I thrust against his face, begging for more.

He takes my hand, guiding it to my throbbing core.
"Make yourself cum. I want to watch."

With two fingers, I start making small, firm circles.
I press my thumb against my slit, imagining his tongue lapping up my juices.
As I moan, he pulls out his own large, hardened cock.
His hand glides up and down its thickness as he watches me pleasure myself.

"I need you." I moan as the heat completely consumes my body.
Touching myself isn't enough.
I need him to fill me.
I need him to fuck me like his life depends on it.

Zachary leans over me, his lips crushing mine.
The tip of his cock rubs against my entrance.

He pushes into me, filling the space.
Or so I think, until he pushes deeper, his balls slamming against me.
He isn't gentle.
His thrusts are hard and deep, making me scream his name as my body spasms around him.

He fucks me for what feels like hours.
Mind-blowing orgasms wash over me one after another.
But it's never enough.
Minutes after climaxing, I crave more.
I can't stop it, even if I wanted to.
I'm burning up, desperate with need.

Thankfully, Zachary never stops, pleasing me in every way possible.

"It's subsiding." He presses his lips to mine.

"Do we have to get out of bed?" I mutter.
Leaving the bed means facing the problems outside.
I'm not ready for that yet.
"Can't we just stay here? In our own little bubble."

"As much as I love hearing you moan my name, we still have a Rogue on the loose. Hiding somewhere. A Rogue who apparently learned to scale walls."

I nod and sigh, sinking back into my pillows.
I glance at the bloody handprints.
"What about when I'm alone in here again?"

"Do you really think I'll let you sleep alone again?"
###Chapter 0176
Athena

My forehead pressed against the cool wood of the desk.
Alexander, Sebastian, and Theodore were discussing strategies.
Every plan they proposed felt useless.
Gabriel was cunning.
He had outsmarted Isabella, Sophia, even his own brother.

I turned my head slightly, glancing at Brianna asleep on the sofa.
Theodore had argued she shouldn’t be alone during her recovery.
My mate had agreed to let him bring her here.

Her eyes were shut, one arm dangling off the edge.
But I had a strong feeling she wasn’t truly asleep.
She just wanted to listen.

Should we say something? Nyx murmured.

Not yet, I replied.
I still didn’t trust Brianna.
Saving her life didn’t make her trustworthy.

Everything about her seemed too perfect.
The others insisted she was trying.
But they would see the truth eventually.
It was only a matter of time.

Zachary had shared more about his past than she ever did.
All she talked about was what she’d done to me.
It made me suspicious.

I saw her eyelashes flutter.
She rolled over, facing the back of the sofa.
Now I couldn’t tell if she was faking.

“Are you okay?” Alexander moved around the desk toward me.
He blocked my view of Brianna.

“Tired,” I muttered.
It wasn’t a lie.
The twins had been moving all night.
I’d barely slept.

“Do you want to lie down?”

I noticed Brianna tense, waiting for my answer.
“No.”

He leaned down and kissed my cheek.
A knock at the door pulled my attention away.

Theodore opened it to reveal Zachary and Isabella.
Her cheeks were flushed.
She’d probably been in heat.
They’d been in her room most of the day.

“What’s the problem now?” Alexander muttered.

“Gabriel has been trying to watch Isabella.”

“What do you mean?” I sat up.

“Bloody handprints on her window. His scent,” Zachary replied.

“How?” I asked, surprised. “Your room doesn’t even—”

“I know. We haven’t figured it out yet.”

“Please tell me I get to kill someone today!” Zachary said.

Alexander had promised him Ethan.

“You’re in luck. Today’s the day,” Alexander smiled. “We need him gone.”

About damn time, Nyx muttered.

Theodore woke Brianna.
She sprang up the moment he touched her.
Just as I suspected—she hadn’t been asleep.

The seven of us headed to the dungeon.
Ethan’s execution was supposed to be public.
But given the circumstances, Alexander decided to do it privately.

Ethan laughed as we stood before his cell.
His eyes scanned each of our faces.
As if memorizing who to haunt after death.

“Go on, then! Do it!” he gloated.

Alexander cleared his throat.
His crimson eyes locked on the man in the cell.
“I sentence you to death for crimes against Alpha and Luna Athena Harrison.”

Ethan laughed again.
His smile stretched wide.
He’d lost weight in captivity, looking even creepier.

“I assume the girl is dead,” Ethan said as Alexander unlocked the cell.

“Why would you assume that?”

“When she was down here, he said he’d kill her. She still opened his cell. But not mine.” He spat on the floor. “She deserves to be dead.”

“Deserves? After you had her kidnapped by your brother? You think she deserved to have her heart ripped out?” I was furious.

“Careful, Athena. You’re carrying precious cargo. We wouldn’t want anything to happen to the twins.”

“You’ll be dead soon. Those twins mean nothing to you,” Zachary growled.

“Rather invested, aren’t you, Lycan?” Ethan’s grin widened. “My pack is coming for me.”

Alexander burst out laughing.
“No. They’re not. Your Beta has taken over Crestwood City. Your pack wants nothing to do with you. In fact, your Beta wants to be called when your heart stops beating.”

Alexander unlocked the cell and stepped inside with Sebastian.

“You’re a liar, Alexander. They will avenge me. They won’t rest until you suffer.”

Alexander and Sebastian held him still as Zachary unlocked his chains.
Isabella slipped an arm around mine, steadying herself.

“Go on, kill me. You’ll never learn the truth about the young redhead.”

Athena, Alexander linked me. He’s trying to get in your head. Buying time.

“The truth,” I muttered, removing Isabella’s arm.
I stepped into the cell, locking eyes with the gaunt man.
“The truth is that she was just a girl whose life was destroyed. You don’t know what that’s like. But maybe if I rearrange your organs, you’ll feel it for a few seconds. Zachary, move.”

Zachary glanced at my hand, already shifting into claws.
He stepped aside.
One by one, my claws pierced Ethan’s chest, like slicing soft cheese.

He fought back screams.
Sweat poured down his body as he struggled.
It only made my claws sink deeper.

I sliced his flesh open.
He fought against Alexander and Sebastian, but they held him upright.

“Isn’t this what you want, Ethan?” I heard the darkness in my words.
Rage surged through me.

“Please, stop. Or kill me quickly,” he begged.

“You don’t deserve a quick death,” I muttered, pulling my claws free.
The wounds partially healed, just for me to slash again.

I repeated it three more times.
Pouring all my anger into his slow, painful death.

His head dropped as he coughed up blood.
My claws had pierced his lungs this time.
A strange whistle came from his mouth.

I forced my claws deep, squeezing his lungs.
Tearing parts of them from his chest.

His whole body trembled.
Then Alexander and Sebastian released him.
He fell face-first into a pool of blood and piss.

I left the cell.
Isabella had her head buried in Zachary’s chest.
But his eyes were on me.
So were Brianna’s.
I hoped they both saw.
It wasn’t worth fucking with me.
Not anymore.

I didn’t stop.
I walked straight out of the dungeon.
If Gabriel wanted to attack, I was ready to rip him apart.
###Chapter 0177
Zachary

Normally, I would have been impressed by Athena’s kill.
But right now, worry was all I felt.

Brianna nudged me.
Her expression mirrored my own concern.
I knew exactly what she was thinking.
I gave a slow shake of my head.
We needed to be extremely careful.

Isabella kept her face buried against my chest.
She was still grossed out by how Athena had killed Ethan.
Athena had made him suffer repeatedly.
She only stopped when she decided it was enough.
Or more accurately, when she grew bored of toying with her prey.

“Isabella, go with Brianna. I need to speak to Alexander.”

Her dark eyes lifted to meet mine.
“Why? What’s wrong?”

“I just need to confirm a few things. That’s all.”
I hoped that vague answer would satisfy her.
I didn’t want to keep secrets.
But Alexander was her mate.
He deserved to hear this from me first.

“Come on,” Brianna smiled at her.
“You’re mated to my best friend. We should get to know each other.”

Alexander watched me suspiciously.
But Isabella followed Brianna anyway.
After a moment, he ordered Sebastian and Theodore to go with them.
Just in case Gabriel decided to show up.

Gabriel wouldn’t reveal himself yet.
Whatever he was planning, he was drawing it out.
Much like how Athena had tortured Ethan.
I wondered if she even realized she had spent hours on him.

“What?” Alexander snapped once the dungeon door closed.
It was just us and Ethan’s dismembered body.

“You once told me her Lycan was a separate spirit.”

“And? I said you could kill Ethan. Is that what this is about?”

“No. It’s just… since I’ve been here, I’ve noticed something.”
“When her Lycan pushes forward, her eyes turn dark. Almost black.”
“It’s her Lycan that gives her the courage to kill.”

“Yes.”

“They weren’t black, Alexander. They were her usual blue.”
“She had no help from her Lycan.”
“She wanted to kill him. She wanted to torture him.”

His strange crimson eyes locked with mine.
“She has deep-seated anger. None of us are angels. Not from what she’s told me.”

I nodded, a half-smirk forming.
“She told you about my past.”

He continued staring.
I could see why he intimidated so many people.
But he didn’t scare me.
I’d dealt with far worse.

“We all have a past, Alexander. Every single one of us.”
“But I’m talking about the present.”
“The one where you’re at risk of losing your mate.”

He slammed me against the wall.
His arm pressed hard against my chest, pinning me.
“I suggest you take that back.”

“I would never lay a finger on her.”

I shoved him back and straightened my shirt.
“I made a promise to protect her.”
“I’m telling you that you need to stop her from killing anyone else.”
“No matter how much you agree with it.”

“I won’t stop her from seeking justice. It’s her right to hurt those who hurt her.”

“Then listen to me, Alexander. You will lose her, and it won’t be to death.”

His brows furrowed as he glared.

He shook his head. “You’re wrong.”

“Brianna saw it too.”

“She was just getting revenge for Sophia,” he defended, but I heard the skepticism he tried to hide.
Deep down, he saw it too.

“Think about it, Alexander.”
“You grew up knowing how to punish people. Making them pay for their sins.”
“Most Rogues didn’t.”
“The ability to kill with ease became a new adventure for them.”
“And I see that in Athena.”
“You said it yourself.”
“For sixteen years, she was a slave.”
“Her abilities were bound. Her true life was kept from her.”
“And she regained everything in less than a year.”
###Chapter 0178

He denies it with a sharp shake of his head.

“It’s comparable to how long a bitten Lycan has before turning fully Rogue without control.”

“She wasn’t bitten. Yet you still turned.”

“Maybe it’s the binding. I don’t have all the answers. But I recognize the signs. She’s following the same destructive path I once walked.”

“Her anger fuels her. Her hate consumes her.”

I turn away, pressing my palms flat against the cold stone wall. My head drops low.

This wasn’t part of the new beginning I envisioned.

We were supposed to leave the past behind. Not resurrect its ghosts.

“She is your mate, Alexander. Your love for her is undeniable. We all see it. But if we don’t act now, Gabriel will be the least of your concerns.”

I turn back to see his deep frown.

“It’s Athena,” he mutters through a clenched jaw. My words were striking a nerve.

“Theoretically, since she was bound, I’ve been Lycan longer. Trust me, I know what I’m seeing. Brianna pulled me back from the edge long after I’d lost myself.”

Alexander scoffs. “When we first discovered her true nature, do you know what she feared most?”

I shake my head.

“Becoming a monster. Ironic, isn’t it?” He folds his arms tightly across his chest. “You came back from being Rogue. Can you help her?”

“I can try. But honestly, Brianna is her best chance. She’s the one who saved me.”

“Athena doesn’t trust Brianna. That won’t change overnight.”

“Then we must find a way for Athena to accept her.”

His gaze drifts back to Ethan’s unconscious form. “Do you truly believe I’m losing her?”

I nod grimly. “The worst part is, she won’t even realize it until it’s too late.”

When we return to the house, Isabella and Brianna are in the kitchen. Despite everything, they’re laughing and sharing a tub of ice cream.

“Where is Athena?” Alexander asks.

“She went upstairs. She didn’t want to see me.” Brianna sighs heavily. Her desperation to win Athena over was growing more palpable each day. Yet Athena continued to reject every effort.

Alexander nods and leaves, hopefully to have a crucial conversation with his mate.

“Did you talk to him?” Brianna asks around a mouthful of ice cream.

“Yes.”

“What am I missing?” Isabella frowns. “We were having a good time until Zachary showed up. Now you both look like you’re carrying the world’s weight.”

“It’s fine,” I tell Brianna. “Alexander knows. You can tell her.”

Isabella’s eyes go wide as Brianna explains. Her lips part in shock. She was terrible at hiding her feelings, a trait I found oddly endearing.

“Does she know?” Brianna asks.

“Not yet. Alexander forbade anyone from telling her. It’s a messed-up decision, but she is his mate.”

“He wants to protect her,” Isabella sighs. “She fought for survival her whole life. Now she must fight again.”

“This is different.”

“How?” Isabella’s dark eyes lift to meet mine. “Explain how it’s different.”

“That old life was forced upon her. This… this darkness, she’s choosing it. Slowly. She just doesn’t see it yet.”

“Why?” Isabella whispers.

“It makes her feel powerful. It gives her a deep, violent satisfaction.”

“The tragedy is, if she’d been raised as a Lycan, she might never have developed this inner void,” Brianna offers Isabella a sad smile.

“That’s speculation. Neither of us can know what her life should have been,” I snap.

“I can’t lose her too, Zachary.” Isabella’s plea is raw. “I can’t. It would destroy me.”

As she holds my gaze, I feel it. Every emotion she struggles to contain, shimmering just beneath the surface.

Brianna reaches across the table, placing her hand over Isabella’s. “Athena must want the help. It’s the only way this works.”
###Chapter 0179
Isabella

Zachary paces my room, his movements tight with tension. He checked every window twice before drawing the curtains. At least there were no more bloody handprints tonight.

He looks exhausted. Midnight whispers.

A lot is happening. I murmur back.

Asking if he’s okay would be pointless. It’s written all over him. I’ve never been good at comfort. I tried with Athena when she first arrived, and ended up mentioning Alexander’s past brides. That was supposed to be a warning, but it came out all wrong.

Julian once told me I’m too honest for my own good. That it would cause trouble someday.

You’ve always been a terrible liar. Midnight snorts. It’s the only thing she ever agreed with him about.

Zachary checks the hallway again. He even inspects the bathroom, though the window is too small for anyone to squeeze through. He acts like Gabriel might leap out and attack us any second. I half expected him to look under the bed.

He’s just trying to regain some control.

“If he’s in human form, we’d catch his scent. If he’s Lycan, you’d definitely smell him.” I remind him.

“You’re right.” He stops in front of me and leans down to kiss me.

When he pulls back, he rests his forehead against mine.

“You think it’s too late, don’t you?” I’ve been desperate to ask. I kept the thought buried so he wouldn’t pick it up.

“No.” His voice is heavy. He doesn’t sound convinced.

“Don’t lie. I see it in your eyes. You warned Alexander, but you believe it’s too late.”

“There’s no way to know for sure. None of us are exactly alike. You and Julian are twins. Your wolves are twins. But you’re nothing like each other. We don’t know if we can bring her back once she crosses over. If she doesn’t want to…” He shakes his head, trailing off.

“I know Athena is your friend, Isabella. But there’s only so much we can do. Only so much anyone can do.”

He sits beside me on the bed.

“You’ll still try?” I ask.

“I won’t stop trying.”

“What about the pups?”

He avoids my eyes.

“Will they survive?” I press. Maybe if Athena knows what could happen, it might stop her from changing.

Zachary’s jaw tightens.

“Tell me. I can handle it.”

“There was a female in our Rogue group. She was pregnant when she turned full Lycan.”

“The pup died during birth?”

“She ate it.” His eyes flick to my shocked expression. “It’s not black and white, Isabella. Everything is food to them. Unless…”

I cut in, putting it together. “Unless the pup is born in Lycan form. Hers was human. So she ate her own child.”

He nods. “I warned you, Isabella. We are dark. Everything about being Rogue is food and games. Nothing else matters. The world could be ending, but if you have food, you don’t care.”

“It took me a long time to understand why we become obsessed with food. The simple answer is the same reason you eat so much after shifting. It makes you ravenous. But for a Rogue, the hunger never goes away. Ever.”

“You have to tell her.” I whisper. “Those pups mean everything to her. To this pack. To Alexander. To me. And to you, too. Maybe it will stop her from killing anyone else. Maybe it will prevent the change.” I hear the pleading in my own voice. I’m terrified of losing her. And in that moment, I understand there’s more to what Zachary is saying.
###Chapter 0180

The warnings never stop.
They tell me he's dangerous.
That I should fear him.
That one day I'll despise him.
The way he speaks of Athena's transformation.

I release his arm. "You believe you'll return to that darkness?"

I hold my breath, waiting.

"Every day was a battle. I fought it constantly."

"Not anymore?" My voice drops to a whisper.

"Not since you came into my life."

My heart stutters in my chest.
Only one other person claimed I changed them.
Gabriel.
He wanted a blood bond.
To tie himself to my pack.
But he wasn't a Wolf.
How would that even work?
Lycans could blood-bond with each other.
Athena proved that with her first mate.
But between a Wolf and a Lycan?
Was such a thing possible?

I step back from Alexander.
My hands find the dresser for support.

"Seriously? You're thinking about my brother now?" He reads my thoughts effortlessly.

"He wanted a blood bond. We nearly completed it. Then... he discovered you." I shake my head. "I would've bowed to Dominic and Victoria. They ruined everything for us."

"Then you escaped fate. For that, I'm eternally grateful."

His eyes burn with possessive desire.
The need to prove I belong only to him.

"Let me remind you why."

His lips brush mine.
His hands grip my waist.
He lifts me onto the dresser.
He nuzzles against my neck, positioning himself between my thighs.

"You smell incredible." He murmurs against my skin before nipping gently. "But you'll have to wait."

"For what?" I gasp in frustration.

A thunderous knock shakes the door.
My brother's scent fills the air.
His timing couldn't be worse.

"I know you're in there, Zachary!"

Zachary gives me a quick kiss.
He moves to the door, letting Sebastian inside. "What do you need?" Zachary glances back at me.
I clamp my thighs together, willing my arousal to fade.

"You need to speak with Athena."

"The conversation went poorly?" Zachary asks.

"She's hormonal. Furious. She thinks I'm lying. Or rather, Nyx does. She always trusted me before. Accepted my word without question. But this... she refuses to believe."

I watch Zachary's expression harden.
It's subtle, but unmistakable.
I can't read his mind yet, but I know his thoughts.
This was his greatest fear.
That we were too late.

"Where is she?"

"Down the hall. In our room."

Zachary moves toward her when Sebastian shouts from downstairs, calling for assistance.

"I'll go to Athena." I murmur, sliding off the dresser and reaching for my crutches. "See what's wrong with Sebastian."

The men rush toward the stairs.
I make my way to Athena's room.
She's curled in the large chair by the window, cradling her small bump.
She offers a weak smile.

"Did you hear Sebastian?"

She shakes her head.
Her blue eyes hold the same sadness I saw when she first arrived at Obsidian Howl.

"Alexander told you?"

"He's wrong, right? He has to be wrong. I wasn't bitten. I..." She sighs heavily.

"Zachary mentioned some of it." I whisper, pulling the stool from her dresser. "He's worried."

She frowns. "Alexander said I sliced Ethan open repeatedly."

"You... you did." I was confused.
We were all there.
We all saw what she did to him.
No one stopped her.
It became too much.
I buried my face in Zachary's arm so I wouldn't have to watch.

"No. It was only three times."

"Athena, we were down there for hours."

She shifts in the chair to face me properly. "Hours?"

"You don't remember?"
###Chapter 0181
Athena

"How could I possibly forget, Isabella? That doesn't make any sense at all."

"Maybe you were confused. Perhaps you lost track of time."

"You don't believe that. Zachary must have told you something." I muttered. I rose from the chair and began pacing. Somehow, moving around helped me think more clearly.

"What does Nyx say?" Isabella asked quietly. Her eyes followed my movements around the room.

"She thinks you're all lying to me. But you can't all be lying, can you? This isn't like Silver Creek where they kept secrets from me. You would tell me the truth, wouldn't you?"

Isabella nodded slowly.

I lowered myself onto the edge of the bed. "There's a darkness inside me, Isabella. In the moment, I can't control it. It takes over completely. Once whatever needs to be done is finished, the darkness fades away like it was never there. Does that make any sense?"

"I think so. How long has this been happening?"

"Since Caleb. Maybe even before, I'm not sure."

She rocked gently on the stool. "Have you told my brother? Does he know?"

"He's aware. But he never had a problem with it before. He actually enjoyed it. Until now."

"Alexander does enjoy the darker side of life. I think that's why he gets along so well with Zachary." I saw her smile and felt genuinely happy for her, but Alexander and Zachary's friendship wasn't the issue right now.

"Isabella, I'm scared. What if they're right? What if I'm too far gone? What if it's too late?" I glanced down at my bump. "What about them?"

"That's a lot of questions to answer." She was deflecting.

"What else has Zachary told you?"

Her shoulders dropped as she frowned. "According to Zachary, if you... you know... become Rogue, they won't survive."

"The twins will die?" I scoffed.

She nodded solemnly.

I felt tears welling up in my eyes.

"Then I just won't turn." It sounded simple enough. "And no more killing."

That's what Alexander had said: Content belongs to noveldrama.com.

Isabella lowered her dark eyes.

"It's not that simple, is it?"

"Not from what I understand."

Why couldn't I just go back to the days when the hardest part of my day was learning to read and write!

"I could still turn?" I never wanted to be a monster, but here I was, slowly becoming one.

Her heavy sigh seemed to echo through the room as she nodded.

"But the good news is, we have Zachary who transitioned back and Brianna who helped him. She can help you too. If you let her."

"Brianna is bad news."

"Does it matter if she's the one who can help you and the twins?" Isabella offered. "At least then, you'll be able to keep a closer eye on her."

Nyx remained quiet but angry. She doesn't want to be shut away. She wants to be free - and I was fighting every inch of my being to keep her from taking control.

"Do you trust Brianna?" I asked Isabella.

"I believe her when she says she regrets hurting you. But if you don't want to be alone with her, I can stay with you. Maybe that way, I can stop you from killing her." She gave me a small smile.

It wasn't hard to find Brianna. Alexander had set her up in one of the guest bedrooms, but she seemed surprised to see me at her door.

"Is... is everything okay?"

I gritted my teeth, annoyance already building within me. "I need your help."

Her lips parted slightly as she tucked a strand of dirty blonde hair behind her ear. Taking a step back, she invited us both inside.

"How can I help?" She asked, looking between both of us.

"You helped Zachary, right?" Isabella muttered.
###Chapter 0182

"You're already aware of that."

"You can assist Athena, can't you?"

"Ah, so they've spoken with you." She turns away, rearranging the bed blankets meticulously while searching for words. "This isn't an instant solution." Brianna glances toward Isabella. "I'm certain Zachary has explained it's a continuous struggle."

Isabella nods, and instinctively, I sense she's been withholding information from me.

"You need to stop that." Brianna snaps sharply, making me jolt.

"What are you referring to?" I frown back at her.

"That expression. You must cease searching for negativity in every scenario."

"I didn't utter a word." I protest.

"Your face conveyed it all."

Isabella glances between us. "I won't even inquire about what just transpired."

"I recognize everything is exponentially more challenging for you." Brianna speaks gently, "Your upbringing has intensified it. The trauma you endured means you instinctively perceive the worst. And I don't hold that against you."

"You mean like when you nearly ended my life?"

She doesn't flinch at my question. Instead, she remains composed. "Precisely."

'Just eliminate her and be done with it.' Nyx growls.

'Quiet, I can't handle you right now!' I retort sharply to my Lycan.

"I wish to help you, Athena, if you'll permit me. Ultimately, you are my Alpha." Her forehead creases into a frown. "But if you desire to kill me, then proceed."

"Don't!" Isabella seizes my arm, though I hadn't moved.

"Release her Isabella, this must be her decision."

"Is this a test?" I murmur. "Because if I kill you, there's a strong possibility I'll transform?"

Neither responds.

'Kill her, we'll manage.' Nyx muses. Was it her? Was she the cause of my monstrous transformation?

I shut my eyes. "I desire your assistance. I want to witness my children mature. I want to be with Alexander. I want to survive."

"Good, that's a beginning."

As Isabella stated, I didn't need to trust her, I merely needed to accept her help, for now.

Brianna signals for me to sit, but I remain standing, and she raises an eyebrow. "Typically, I'd insist on rigorous exercise..."

"Rigorous exercise?" Isabella interrupts.

"Why do you think Zachary is built that way?" She laughs, "but Athena, given your pregnancy and required rest, this will be more complicated."

"And considering Gabriel is still out there somewhere." Isabella adds.

"That too. Hmmm" Brianna turns to Isabella, "Is she cleared for sexual activity?"

"I am present!" I snap, irritated.

"It doesn't deter them." Isabella shrugs. "Wait, did you advise Zachary similarly? Who was he involved with?"

Brianna ignores her and addresses me. "A crucial part is maintaining mental engagement and physical activity."

Nyx rolls her eyes but remains silent.

"That's your counsel?" I sputter, "Sex and staying occupied?"

"That's merely the commencement. It's a prolonged process, Athena. It's not an overnight remedy, and you must prepare for that."

"How long did it take Zachary?" Isabella inquires.

"Has he disclosed that?"

"No."

"There's your response."

"I don't... I don't comprehend." I mutter.

"It will perpetually be a conflict. Some prevail, some succumb." Brianna's brown eyes lock onto mine.

"You've aided others, besides Zachary?" Isabella asks.

She nods.

"Others, so there are more?" I ask.

"Zachary is the sole individual who has entirely resisted the Rogue existence and continues to combat it."

"You attempted to help others but failed." Isabella clarifies.

My odds of overcoming this were not favorable.
###Chapter 0183
Isabella

Who could it possibly be?
Midnight whispers as we trail Athena out of Brianna's room.
She got overly excited learning that intimacy could help Athena's condition.
Her desperation to uncover Zachary's past partners started affecting me too.

We should return and demand answers!
She pouts.

Athena's wellbeing comes first.
I respond, though curiosity gnawed at me.
They were isolated back then.
Only a female Rogue and Brianna were present.
It couldn't be the Rogue.
Did that mean he was with his best friend?

No.
That was before my time.
I shouldn't dwell on his history.

Isabella.
Alexander's voice cuts through my thoughts.
Keep Athena upstairs.
What's happening?
I mind-link back.

Explanations later.
She must not witness this.

Athena had reached the staircase when I stopped her.
"Could you assist me with something?"

"Isabella, I'm starving."
She groans softly.
"These two need satisfaction if I'm to endure this."
She gestures to her stomach.

"Perfect timing.
I have candy bars in my room.
This won't take long."

She sighs heavily but follows me to my room.
"What do you need help with?"

"..."
Crap.
I hadn't prepared an excuse.

Ask her to check your wound for infection.
You can't see the back of your leg.
Midnight suggests urgently.

I repeat Midnight's words to Athena.
She nods and enters my room.

My gaze darts to the window.
Half-expecting another handprint.
This time, nothing.
Being watched never concerned me until recently.
Now everywhere felt like eyes were tracking me.

Athena finishes examining my leg quickly.
"I'm no expert, but it looks unchanged."
She settles on my bed's edge.
"You're hiding something.
Zachary could've checked your leg.
That huge mirror would've shown your reflection too."

My cheeks flush.
I turn away quickly.
That mirror witnessed plenty recently.

"It's because of my darkness, right?"
She pauses.
"Isabella, just tell me.
You know I despise secrets."

"I don't know details.
Alexander asked me to keep you upstairs."

She jumps up immediately.
Cheeks puffing out.

"Remember what Brianna said.
You need distraction."
I pull candy bars from my drawer.
"Let them handle it.
Everyone wants what's best for you.
No one intends to keep secrets."

Something smacks the window.
We both scream.
Blood streaks down the glass like something slid through it.

"What was that?"
We speak together, rushing to the window.

I freeze seeing him.
Exactly as remembered.
Our eyes lock moments before men charge toward him.
He vanishes into the forest.

"Was... was that him?"
Athena whispers as Zachary bursts into the room.

"In human form."
My stomach twists.

Zachary's arms encircle me.
He pulls me firmly against his chest.
Reassuring me of his presence.
"They'll get him.
But why are you only in a tee and panties?"

"He was right in the open grounds.
Broad daylight.
He threw something at the window.
I'm his target."
Panic surges through me.

"He won't reach you."
Zachary states firmly.
"I'll kill him myself."

"What did he throw?"
Athena asks.
"I can't see clearly."

Zachary hesitates.
"Better discuss that with Alexander."
He closes the curtain.
"Tell me!"
Athena demands.

"Athena, he's right.
Wait for Alexander."

I witness my worst fear.
Her eyes darkening slowly.
Only a faint blue ring remains.
What if Zachary was correct?
What if time ran out?

"Zachary, don't."
I murmur.
Knowing Athena's next words would be an unrefusable command.

"Tell..."

"Alexander's coming."
Zachary interrupts.
"He'll explain everything.
Probably more than I can."

She stares at him.
Very slowly, the black recedes from her eyes.
Thank the Goddess.

"Athena?"
Alexander's soft voice fills the room.
He only used that tone with her.
Sometimes seeming afraid of breaking her.
Or knowing it helped reason with her.
He never spoke to others that way.

Her eyes flash to him.
Briefly, I expect darkness to return.

She's terrifying like this.
Midnight murmurs.
I agree.
Sometimes feeling like I barely know her.
###Chapter 0184

“Come with me.” He extends his hand toward her.

Her gaze darts back to Zachary and me.

“Now.” His tone sharpens, leaving no room for argument. She moves to him. His eyes lock onto Zachary. “Do not let my sister leave your sight.”

“I have no intention of it.”

Alexander shuts the door just as Zachary’s warm breath ghosts across my cheek. His palms cup my backside. “Care to explain why you’re missing your pants?”

“It was the only strategy I could devise to keep Athena upstairs.”

“Is that so?” He sounds amused.

“Not for the reason you’re thinking. I needed her to examine my leg.”

“This leg.” His fingertips trace the perimeter of the wound. Sharp pricks of pain radiate outward, quickly replaced by electric jolts as his teeth gently scrape my earlobe.

“Zachary.” I whisper his name as his mouth travels down my neck. This was a terrible time for this, yet he made everything else vanish. It felt like only the two of us existed, nothing else held any importance.

His hands slide beneath my shirt. He palms my breasts firmly, his fingers teasing my nipples into hard peaks. He pinches them, drawing another moan from my throat.

He pulls the shirt over my head and turns me to face him. “On your knees.”

I drop immediately, ignoring the throb in my leg. He swiftly undoes his jeans, freeing his hardening length. He grips himself, rubbing the tip across my lips. I can’t resist flicking my tongue against it.

He growls, his cock twitching at the contact.

I look up at him, parting my lips wider. I take the head of his cock into my mouth.

He rocks his hips, sliding himself back and forth over my lips. My eyes remain locked on his.

He pushes a little deeper. My tongue swirls around his solid length.

“Fuck, Isabella.” He growls, his hand tangling in my hair. He thrusts into my mouth.

Drops of cum hit my tongue. I taste his saltiness, which carries a surprising hint of sweetness as it slides down my throat. When I don’t gag, it spurs him on. He fucks my mouth harder, hitting the back of my throat repeatedly until he fills it with his release.

His hand still in my hair, he pulls my head back. He wipes away any trace that escaped my lips.

“Open.” he commands. His dark eyes drop to my open, empty mouth. A smirk plays on his lips as he pulls me to my feet. His hand cups my sex before I’m fully standing. His fingers stroke over my soaked panties, pressing against the damp fabric.

“You’re drenched.” he murmurs against my ear. He pushes the fabric aside and slides a finger inside me. I fight back a moan until his lips crash onto mine. A second finger joins the first.

“Ohhh.”

His thumb circles my clit as his lips leave mine. He watches intently as my climax builds. Sweat trickles down my spine. I struggle to hold on.

My hands grip his shoulders, nails digging into his skin. Finally, the orgasm shatters through me.

Of all my past partners, none have ever made me come this hard except Zachary.

His fingers withdraw but continue to circle my throbbing clit.

“Tired?” he asks, amused, as I slump against him. “Because I’m far from finished.”

His cock is already hard against my leg. He pulls me onto the bed, positioning himself between my thighs.

His lips and teeth alternate between gentle bites and kisses, working their way down to my breasts.

He pauses just above my navel. “Are you still thinking about him?”

“What?” I push up on my elbows to stare at him. What was he talking about? Then it hits me. He felt what I felt when I saw Gabriel in human form.

I try to shove him off, but it’s useless. He doesn’t budge.

“I am your mate. I’m the one who makes you come so hard you drip all over me.”

“This was a test?!” I snap.

“You passed.” he mutters. I grab a pillow and smack him. He still doesn’t move.

“Get off me!” I snarl.

He stands up, glowering down at me.

“If you had bothered to ask, you’d know I felt pity for him. Not desire!”

“He was your mate once.”

“And he rejected me. He did this to me!” I jab a finger at my leg before limping across the room. I slam the bathroom door shut. Fury burns through me that he could ever think I’d want Gabriel.

~

~

“Isabella?” His voice comes from the other side of the door.

“Just because you can read my mind doesn’t mean you understand anything. So fuck off.” My blood boils. I can’t believe he’d accuse me of that.

“I’m not leaving you alone.”

“Then stop fucking talking to me!”

###Chapter 0186
Zachary

I messed up badly.

Her furious breathing echoed from behind the door. She was absolutely livid with me. It might have been amusing if I hadn't understood exactly what those thoughts meant.

I was such a fool.

I pushed gently against the door. It didn't move an inch. From the shadow beneath it, I could tell she was leaning against it to block my entry. Though I could force my way in if I wanted to. It wouldn't take much to make her slide across the tiles.

"Isabella."

"I have nothing to say to you." Her reply was sharp and bitter. Her words dripped with venom. She was so enraged that there weren't even any tears.

"I..." Would she believe me if I told her the truth?

Jealousy wasn't an emotion I was familiar with. Every time her mind drifted to him, I just wanted to remind her that I was her mate. That the bastard who rejected her had done exactly that.

It wasn't even him I was jealous of. It was the fact she was thinking about another man, if you could even call him that.

"I'm sorry." I muttered through the door. I already knew simple words wouldn't be enough to fix this.

She shuffled away from the door. I watched the handle turn. She pulled it open just an inch. Peering through the narrow gap at me. "You're terrible at apologies."

"I don't usually have to make them."

I wanted to push the door open and pull her into my arms. But the way she blocked the entrance told me she might either appreciate it or punch my eyes out. It was impossible to predict.

"I don't want him. You need to understand that. He's in my thoughts because he's messing with my head. The blood on the windows and seeing him... He's not the man I remember, which makes it even more confusing. And that definitely doesn't mean I want to sleep with him!"

"I know that now."

"How could you even think I would want him?" Her voice broke. "He damaged me in more ways than just my leg."

"Just come out of the bathroom."

She opened the door a little wider. I saw she had wrapped herself in a robe, concealing her beautiful body. Her arms folded under her chest as she hugged herself tightly. Her dark eyes met mine.

"I am yours Zachary. Not his, not anyone else's, yours forever."

I seized the moment to pull her against me. She didn't resist. Resting her cheek against my chest as our heartbeats slowly synchronized.

"What didn't you want to tell Athena?" she asked quietly once her anger subsided.

"Maybe you should sit down for this."

"Why?" She leaned back in my arms, her brow furrowing into a frown. "I've seen some pretty horrible things."

"It was a box of dismembered body parts."

She grimaced. "Someone from the pack?"

"That's just it, it was human. And I'm guessing what was thrown at your window was part of that same body."

She pulled away from me and limped to the bed. Slowly sinking onto the mattress. I watched her trying to compose herself. "He would have had to leave the grounds to find a human."

"Unless they wandered into the forest."

"No, that doesn't happen. We're too far..." she trailed off, studying my face. "I've lived here my entire life and humans don't just wander in. Has Alexander told you that's happened?"

I nodded.

"Did he kill them?"

"No, at least I don't think so. He said he tells them it's private property and they'll be sued for trespassing if they don't leave."
###Chapter 0187

She sticks her tongue out, deep in thought. I was just relieved she wasn't angry with me anymore.

"Do you have any idea why he's doing this?"

"Right now, I think his only goal is to torment everyone. He told Brianna he wanted to bring death and destruction. But the one thing I know about him is that he loves games. This has to be part of his game."

"Could he be working with someone else?"

"The other Rogues are dead."

"Alexander has enemies everywhere. With the contracts completed with other packs, who's to say someone else isn't helping him."

"Rogues don't work together. They wouldn't even team up for a hunt."

She puffs out her cheeks. "It must be difficult for you. Living here, in a pack."

"Actually, no." I sit beside her on the bed. "I spent years working alone as a hired assassin. Being a Rogue was freeing, but I always felt like something was missing. Then I found Brianna. She helped free me from that life. But being welcomed into this pack and finding you—it felt like coming home."

She smiles at me and starts to speak, but we're interrupted by Brianna opening the door.

She's half-hidden behind the door frame, visibly shaking. This wasn't like her at all. She was usually fearless.

She holds up her trembling hands, blood dripping from both. "I...I'm...I'm sorry."

"Brianna?"

"I...went downstairs." She turns slowly, looking back down the hallway. "I was...I was too late."

She steps into the room. I see her shirt isn't just red—it's soaked with dripping blood. "I tried," she whispers.

"Who, Brianna? Who's dead?"

"The office." She mutters, completely lost in shock.

"No... No. No. No, please tell me it's not." Isabella whispers.

"Who was in..." Sebastian's boys had been placed in the office.

I charge out of the room, slamming my hand on Alexander's door as I race past.

I sprint down the stairs to the office.

I find Sebastian on his knees, frozen like a statue with his boys in his arms.

Blood coated almost everything, even the curtains blowing in the breeze.

Alexander crashes into me from behind.

"Sebastian?" Alexander mutters quietly, his eyes scanning the room. He moves around me and crouches beside his Beta. "Sebastian, we will make him pay for this."

I move over and close the window, finding the tip of a finger. He had been in inhuman form. The boys had probably gone to let him in, thinking he was in danger.

I look back at the boys in Sebastian's arms. Both had all ten fingers, which meant the one left behind belonged to Gabriel.

The boys weren't even old enough to have their Wolves. They had been completely defenseless. They never stood a chance.

Isabella, Brianna, and Athena appear. All three turn their faces away from the horrific scene.

I walk to Isabella and kiss her forehead. "Stay here with Brianna and the others."

"Where are you going? You can't leave—we don't know where he is."

"I'm going to find him and kill him."

"He's dangerous."

"I'm worse."

Every part of me regrets not killing him that day. Causing just enough damage to bring him to the dungeon was my mistake. I won't make that mistake again. Even if it takes days, weeks, or months. I won't stop until I know he's dead.
###Chapter 0188
Isabella

Two weeks without him. Pure agony. He wasn't dead, I felt certain of that. If Zachary were gone, I would have sensed it. And Gabriel would have surely returned by now.

He must be hunting Gabriel. That was the only explanation. No trace of Gabriel had been found here, though Brianna and I shared a room most nights just for safety.

Sebastian was completely shattered, and who could blame him? Theodore had stepped up, supporting my brother however possible while Sebastian remained at his parents' home, consumed by grief.

Thankfully, without Gabriel's dark presence, Athena had found some calm... relatively speaking. She burst into tears yesterday over a cracked egg. An egg she intentionally broke to make breakfast. I had to exit the kitchen to stop myself from laughing. Zachary would mock me endlessly if I acted that emotional when carrying his pups someday. Someday. I sighed heavily.

"Please come back to me."

'He will,' Midnight murmured. 'He has to.'

I dropped my empty cereal bowl into the sink, leaning forward to watch the pack members below carrying on as if nothing was wrong.

After less than two days without incident, Alexander had them all back on duty. It felt wrong. First, we still had no confirmed location for Gabriel. Second, many were still mourning Sebastian's boys, yet Alexander insisted routine would help them heal. Since when was children being murdered normal?

I argued with him. Asked if he'd return to duty so quickly if his own twins were harmed. He didn't answer, but the rage in his eyes was unmistakable.

'He's just trying to keep the pack distracted.'

"I know," I muttered back to Midnight. "Doesn't mean I have to agree with it."

My fingers brushed the mating mark on my neck. Zachary hadn't linked me once. Not a single mental whisper. Maybe he believed silence was safer. Keeping me unaware until he had concrete news. Perhaps he worried I'd become a distraction.

"He'll be okay." Brianna's voice cut through my thoughts as she entered the kitchen. She'd repeated those same words multiple times daily for the past two weeks. They provided little comfort.

"How can you be so sure?"

"It's Zachary." She offered a tight-lipped smile, her lips paling like the scar above them. Even she seemed to be doubting it now. "He survives everything."

Survival wasn't my only concern.

I turned as she poured cereal. She'd practically moved in permanently. I didn't mind. Having another female around was nice after being constantly surrounded by males.

She shoveled cereal into her mouth like it was her last meal. "Sorry," she sputtered, spraying half-chewed flakes across the table. "Alexander wants me in training today."

"Seriously?" She'd asked repeatedly before, but he always refused. Why change now?

She nodded vigorously while swallowing another spoonful. "With Zachary chasing Gabriel, Alexander wants me helping guard Athena."

I hid my surprise. He'd been very clear about keeping Athena close to him personally. "How does Athena feel about that?" She'd accepted Brianna's help before but barely tolerated her presence.

Brianna shrugged. "Probably hates it."

"I could join..." Her eyes dropped to my injured leg before I finished speaking. I'd stopped using crutches but still hobbled everywhere, unable to straighten my leg properly without sharp pain shooting through my bones.

Meanwhile Gabriel had walked with half his thigh missing. He'd even run. That day I saw him, he vanished into the trees at incredible speed. As if the injury meant nothing. But I'd seen the wound myself. Maybe pain meant nothing to him. Maybe that's why he enjoyed playing with his victims, listening to their screams. Perhaps he found their suffering hilarious.

Brianna washed her bowl rapidly and hurried out without saying goodbye.

'We could visit Athena,' Midnight suggested.

As much as I loved Athena, I couldn't face her right now.

Instead I found Theodore in the freshly redecorated office. It had to be completely renovated after the bloodbath that occurred here.
###Chapter 0189

Theodore was surrounded by books. He offered me a gentle smile as I dropped into the chair opposite him. His dark hair framed his face like a curtain. He swiftly tucked it behind his ear, his deep green eyes locking onto mine. “Everything alright?”

“Frustrated,” I mumbled.

“We both know if something was wrong with Zachary, you would have sensed it.”

“It’s not that.”

He tilted his head, a knowing smirk playing on his lips. “Really?”

“I just have this… bad feeling.”

“About what?”

“That’s the issue. I don’t actually know.”

“So you’re in a mood, but you don’t know the reason?”

“Exactly.” I slumped against the backrest, sighing. “Did you know Alexander asked Brianna to join the training session today?”

Theodore nodded slowly. “It was actually my suggestion.”

“Yours?” I sputtered, caught off guard.

“Look, she’s in the house constantly. Even though Athena has accepted her help with that other issue, she feels suffocated by Brianna’s presence. Alexander wants Athena to have some space. This seemed like the best solution.”

“So you’re sending her to training and telling her it’s to protect Athena.”

“We never said that.” He frowned at me. “Perhaps she misinterpreted the request.” He paused, thinking. “Maybe she made an assumption. Maybe she heard it wrong.”

He was probably right, though he sounded like he was trying to convince himself. Brianna had spent many nights telling me how grateful she was that Athena was finally speaking to her. Maybe she just misunderstood.

“You miss him?”

“Of course I do,” I muttered, surprised by his sudden question.

“I wasn’t talking about Zachary.”

No one had spoken to me about Julian. If I even mentioned his name in front of Alexander, he would either roll his crimson eyes or simply walk out. As far as he was concerned, our brother was dead. But I never stopped wondering. He was still my brother.

“He made his choice,” I sighed. I didn’t want Theodore to think otherwise.

He rocked gently in his chair, studying me intently.

“Do you know something? Has he contacted you? Does he regret leaving the pack?” The questions spilled out before I could stop them.

He shook his head, and my stomach dropped. For a brief moment, I had felt a flicker of hope—something to focus on besides being trapped here, waiting.

I wasn’t even sure what I was hoping for. Julian had made it perfectly clear that he blames Alexander for Sophia’s death. That wasn’t going to change.

Theodore went back to his books, unbothered by my presence. He was content with or without company. I never understood how he did it.

“Do you think you’ll ever find your mate?” I prodded, trying to keep the conversation going.

“Huh?” He didn’t even look up. I repeated the question. He just shrugged. “Who knows?”

“Don’t you wonder if they’re out there? Wondering where you are?”

“He won’t tell us,” Midnight mused, already predicting how this would end.

“No.” He closed his book slowly and met my gaze. “Not all of us see life the same way, Isabella.”

And that was the end of that conversation. I had tried so many times over the years to get information from him. It always ended the same. I didn’t even know if he preferred men, women, or both. He kept everything close to his chest. I didn’t even know if there was anyone in the pack he liked.

I fidgeted with my thumbs before finally pushing myself up to leave. As I reached the door, Theodore spoke again. He said he was sure Zachary would be back soon. As if he knew why I was really asking all those questions. A distraction from my own thoughts.

But what if something terrible happened? What if that control he has—the one stopping him from turning Rogue—shatters? What if he’s so enraged with Gabriel that I lose him forever?

I limped to the bottom of the staircase. Instead of climbing up, I sat on the steps. Waiting. Hoping. Willing him to walk right back through that front door.
###Chapter 0190
Athena

"Enough!" I snap, glaring down at my swollen stomach. The twins were developing rapidly, and their favorite pastime seemed to be kicking each other—or my bladder—relentlessly. It was driving me insane.

Alexander raises a brow, a faint smile playing on his lips as Brianna jogs toward us. I sigh inwardly, having forgotten she was participating in today's training session.

She halts before us, her gaze immediately narrowing at my belly. "Should you even be out here while pregnant?"

"I'm not training. This is my only escape from being confined indoors!" I retort sharply, causing her to drop her eyes.

For years, Victoria and Dominic had kept me imprisoned within four walls. My world had shrunk to the backyard, until I finally tasted near-complete freedom.

Now, I would give anything to feel real grass under my bare feet. To bask in sunlight without constant surveillance. But until Zachary sends word, I'm forbidden from leaving Alexander's sight. The artificial turf of the training grounds would have to suffice.

I understood it was for my protection. For the twins' safety. But every fiber of my being screamed to break free, to escape this suffocating... entrapment.

Alexander knew. He would reassure me in that calm, steady tone, reminding me this was temporary. Necessary. Promising I could still do most things—as long as he could see me. But to me, this "best thing" felt like losing my sanity piece by piece. If I had any left at this point.

It wasn't just about safety. It was about monitoring me. Ensuring I didn't become the monster I feared most.

"Where would you like me, Alpha?" Brianna beams at Alexander. I desperately want to wipe that artificial smile off her face. It reeks of forced pleasantry. I'd bet anything she possesses a spectacular resting bitch face behind closed doors. I haven't seen it yet, but my instincts scream it's there.

Alexander directs her toward a group of seasoned guards. He'd already mentioned wanting to assess her capabilities. I questioned why—I was living proof of what she could do. I'd felt her power firsthand when she set her mind to it, and that was right after her turning.

What could she achieve with years of training?

"It's prudent to know everyone's capabilities. We may need to utilize them. Or prepare against them." Alexander winks at me.

I glance up, but his crimson eyes remain fixed on the sparring groups. Does he secretly distrust Brianna too?

Nyx murmurs, beginning to voice her opinion. I tell her to be silent. It's easier without her commentary; this way, I can focus on restraining the monster within.

I lower myself onto the grass, observing the combatants. Training had been off-limits since my pregnancy was confirmed. Not that formal training ever mattered when I was fighting for survival. I simply shifted and obliterated threats within seconds. Tearing out hearts, just as Gabriel did to Sophia.

Was that a Rogue trait? Targeting the heart? Or was it simply the most efficient method? Then again, Rogues often toy with their prey. The heart wouldn't be their first target.

In those moments, it was just pure instinct. I never consciously aimed. My claws simply found their mark. Except with Ethan. Him, I tortured.

A smile threatens to surface, and I force it down as Alexander clears his throat. His crimson eyes lock onto mine.

"You've been listening?" I whisper.

"Difficult not to." His voice drops low as he crouches before me. "Brianna warned you about allowing dark thoughts to fester."
###Chapter 0191

It felt like a scolding. My mind instinctively sought solutions. That's just how I functioned. I couldn't help it.

"You enjoyed it when I embraced my killer instinct," I mumbled quietly. We had sex in the woods that day.

"I did," he admitted. "But losing you because of it..." His voice trailed off as he shook his head. "I can't lose you. Or the twins. Understand?"

I nodded, trying to clear my thoughts as he straightened to his full height. His attention returned to the training session.

Lying back on the artificial turf, I gazed up at the clear blue sky. Alexander was maximizing this morning's training session. A storm was forecasted for tonight.

I despised storms. The sharp crack of lightning always brought back memories of being struck. Especially the whip. Sleep would likely evade me later.

Brianna bounded over after training concluded. Her skin glistened with sweat. She wiped her forehead, flicking beads of perspiration onto the grass.

"So? How did I perform?"

"Exactly as I anticipated."

She smiled at him. "So I got the position, right?"

Alexander raised an eyebrow in confusion.

"Protecting Athena, correct?"

"I don't require protection!" I snapped. Alexander's hand immediately wrapped around my wrist. His warning glare silently commanded me to calm down.

"What Athena means is that she currently doesn't need protection. She has me," he told Brianna with a smile.

"I thought that was why you wanted me to train? To test my abilities so you'd know I could guard her."

"I believe you misunderstood, Brianna. I said to test you while I watch Athena," Alexander clarified. "I appreciate your offer of service, but Athena isn't leaving my side at present."

Annoyance flashed in her brown eyes. I wasn't sure if Alexander noticed. If he did, his expression remained unreadable.

"Oh," she sighed. "I only wanted to help. You allowed Zachary to assist."

"Zachary didn't give me much choice," Alexander murmured without looking at her. His eyes continued scanning the remaining trainees.

"What does that mean?" Brianna pressed.

"It's unimportant."

But curiosity stirred within me too. What did he mean? As far as I knew, Zachary had simply started positioning himself near me. I would have to ask Alexander later when we were alone.

Brianna turned her attention to me. "I was only trying to help."

I remained silent. The words ready to leave my mouth would only worry Alexander. Instead, I forced them down and asked if he had any more snacks.

"Not on me. We're finished here anyway. Let's go."

We turned away from Brianna. Alexander draped his arm around my shoulders. "What are you planning?" I murmured as we left the training grounds.

"Just working through something. Until I know more, your only focus should be growing my sons."

"No secrets," I muttered as a kick landed against my bladder.

"It's not a secret. It's a theory."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

He stopped me and spun me around to face him. His hands enveloped mine. "I'm developing several ideas. For now, it's best that only I know them. If the time comes when you need to know, I'll tell you."

"Does anyone else know?"

He shook his head. A strange glint appeared in his crimson eyes. The same look he had given me that first day at Silver Creek. A knowing look. A plan simmered beneath the surface.

Once, I might have been frightened. I might have tried to hide. But whatever he was orchestrating, he was doing it for us. I had to trust that.
###Chapter 0192
Isabella

Day after day, I sat waiting.
Thirty days passed without a word.
Total silence.
No mental link, nothing.
Yet I knew he was still alive.

I leaned back against the cold staircase.
The wooden edge pressed into my spine.
Closing my eyes, I tried desperately to force a connection between us.
Nothing responded.

"Why won't this work?!" I snapped at Midnight.
My patience had worn dangerously thin.

"You know exactly why," she murmured back, her voice equally frustrated.

"Well that's a completely ridiculous reason."
I shouldn't need to mark him to establish a link.
He had already claimed me as his mate.

She nodded in agreement.
It didn't comfort me.
Instead, it emphasized our differences.
A Lycan and a Wolf.
Our parents would be horrified.
All three of their children, mated to Lycans.
And I had been bonded to two.

I wish they could see you now," Midnight whispered gently.
"They would be proud of you."

I knew my mother would approve.
She inspired me to become a pack physician.

Sighing, I pushed myself up from the steps.
My leg didn't cramp this time, which felt like progress.
The healing continued, though slowly.
I still walked with a noticeable limp.
The pain came and went unpredictably.
Perhaps I would walk normally by the time Zachary returned.

Just as I stood, Sebastian stumbled through the front door.
A half-empty whisky bottle dangled from his hand.
The amber liquid sloshed as he fought to maintain balance.
He scowled when some spilled onto the floor.

His drinking began two weeks ago.
Even his parents didn't know how to help him anymore.
They mourned their lost grandchildren.
Now they seemed to be losing their son too.

Alexander had tried reasoning with him.
So had other pack members.
But Sebastian's grief weighed too heavily.
He couldn't see beyond his pain.
I wondered about his former mate.
She left some time ago.
I expected her to return, but she never did.
Almost as if she didn't care about her own children.

I never understood how a mother could abandon her children.

"Sebastian," I said softly, limping toward him.
When I reached for the bottle, he released it without resistance.
That itself was progress.

"Where is he?" he slurred, wobbling before collapsing against the doorframe.

"Who are you looking for?"

"Big brother..." he laughed bitterly, sliding down the frame until he hit the floor.
His chin dropped to his chest.
Within seconds, loud snores echoed through the foyer.
Drool trickled from the corner of his mouth.

He smelled terrible and hadn't shaved in days.
Groaning, I tried to lift him.
His dead weight slipped through my arms.

"Alexander!"
The office door opened instantly.
Alexander's eyes fell on Sebastian, and his shoulders slumped in defeat.

He felt just as helpless.
They had been best friends since childhood.
Yet he couldn't help Sebastian either.
None of us could.
How do you help a grieving parent?

"Vodka?" Alexander muttered as he crouched before Sebastian.

"Whisky," I corrected, placing the bottle on the small table near his office.
Through the doorway, I saw Athena curled asleep.
Stacks of books similar to those Theodore had been reading covered Alexander's desk.
Research wasn't typical for Alexander - he usually delegated such tasks.

"Isabella, help me please."

I turned back to find Alexander lifting Sebastian from the floor.

Limping forward, I draped Sebastian's other arm over my shoulders.
"Where are we taking him?"

"Just to the lounge. Let him sleep it off."

"You must find a way to help him, Alexander. He can't continue like this."

"You know he'll metabolize the alcohol within an hour."

"And then he'll start again. This isn't healthy for him."

"Just like sitting on these stairs every day waiting for Zachary isn't healthy for you."

"I'm not hurting anyone," I snapped back.

"You're hurting yourself."

We dropped Sebastian onto the sofa.
He groaned as he sank into the cushions while Alexander and I glared at each other.

"What would you do if it were Athena?" I crossed my arms, already knowing the answer.
He would tear the world apart searching for her.
He should be grateful I simply sit here waiting, hoping, praying to the Moon Goddess for Zachary's safe return.

"You have a point," he muttered.

I studied his tired crimson eyes as he straightened his posture.
"Are you leading the pack run tonight?"
###Chapter 0193

I wasn't strong enough to go anywhere yet, but he needed the full moon's power.

'I have to watch Athena.'

'I can handle that. Alexander, you missed the last one because of Gabriel. You need to go this time. Athena will be fine. We'll probably eat ice cream and she can listen to me complain about Zachary.'

He snorts and raises an eyebrow. 'I'll consider it.'

Glancing at Sebastian, he tells me to let him sleep it off. 'We can only help him when he's ready.'

As Alexander leaves, I settle on the sofa across from Sebastian. He barely spoke when awake, and when he did, his words were either slurred or sounded like he'd developed a lisp. None of it made sense. I wanted to tell him everything would be alright, that... But it wouldn't be, would it? He had lost his entire world.

How could one beast destroy so much of our pack alone?

Alexander had worked tirelessly for years, building our strength and power. We always had the upper hand, and now one creature was tearing us apart piece by piece. Even all the turned Lycans with Victoria and Dominic hadn't caused this much damage. He had to have help, but who?

Midnight is quiet but panicking. I knew why - she shared my same terrifying thought. What if Zachary left because he was helping his brother and didn't want to get caught?

It couldn't be. That was a ridiculous idea. He wouldn't have bothered marking me if that were true.

'Brianna?' Midnight mutters.

'I don't think so,' I whisper back. Though we no longer shared quarters since she returned to her own home. 'She's trying too hard to prove her worth to the pack. If she were causing trouble, she would have given up by now.'

Maybe I was just exhausted and overthinking everything. Maybe Gabriel was simply a monster with no other goal than to slaughter us all.

Leaning forward, I rest my elbows on my knees and cup my chin, watching the drunken man sleep. There had to be something I was missing.

I hadn't moved when Sebastian began to wake. He rubs his eyes and stares at me, his gaze drifting around the room. 'How did I get here?'

'You practically broke down the front door. I think you were looking for Alexander.'

He runs his hands through his already messy blonde hair and yawns, stretching his limbs. 'Got any whiskey?'

'No.' I glare at him. If I had to follow him to ensure he doesn't touch another drop, that's exactly what I'll do. 'Why did you want to speak to my brother?'

'It doesn't matter.' He gets up and starts searching through the cabinets.

'Alexander had it all removed days ago,' I snap.

'Just forget it.' He storms out and I hurry after him as fast as I can, ignoring the spasming pain tearing through my leg.

Skidding across the floor, I slam myself against the front door, blocking his exit.

'Isabella, move.'

'No.'

He reaches for me and I deliver a swift punch to his groin. He howls and clutches himself. 'What the hell, Isabella!'

'I'm sorry, but you can't keep doing this. You're practically my brother, and I won't watch you drink yourself into oblivion. I'm sorry Gabriel killed your children. I'm sorry he targeted them. I'm sorry I can't bring your sons back-'

'They weren't mine.'

'What? What are you talking about?'

'They weren't my sons.'

'That makes no sense. I helped deliver your second son. I was there.'

'But you weren't there for conception, and it turns out, I wasn't either.' His fist slams into the wall. 'I found Brianna with them. If they were mine, I would have felt their deaths, and I didn't.'

I felt my mouth hanging open and struggled to tighten my muscles so I wouldn't look so shocked.

'You raised them. I watched you raise them. Your bond with them was-' They couldn't shift yet, which also meant he couldn't mind-link with them. He would have discovered the truth when they got their wolves. Instead, he found out because they were slaughtered.

'Who... who...' I struggled to form the words.

'I think you already know the answer to that.'

My eyes flicker to the open office door. Alexander stood there, his face rigid as he watched us. 'Is it true?'

'I had my suspicions,' Alexander sighs heavily.

'They were Julian's children?!'

He nods at me. 'We would have known for certain when they got their wolves.'

That's why he had been letting Sebastian drink himself into stupidity. Sebastian had lost everything.
###Chapter 0194
Zachary

Each day brought me nearer to him, yet he always found a way to derail my pursuit.

He shifted forms constantly, alternating between Lycan and human, leading me farther from Obsidian Howl and my destined mate. But I wouldn't halt, not until he drew his last breath, even if the chase took me to the edge of the world.

We'd encountered each other several times. Not closely, but we'd locked eyes across open fields, busy train platforms, and long bridges.

With every passing day, my fury intensified. All I desired was to reunite with my mate, yet if I didn't stop Gabriel, he'd forever find ways to torment that pack and the woman I loved.

I followed his scent into a bar, my eyes swiftly adapting to the low light. The air was thick with the stench of stale alcohol, urine, and blood. He'd been here hours ago. Even before stepping inside, I understood why he'd chosen this location.

He'd always enjoyed a challenge, long before his Lycan transformation. Taunting and torturing people. There was so much Isabella didn't know about the man she'd once been mated to. She'd had a fortunate escape.

Bodies were scattered across the floor as the jukebox played. Half a dozen had their throats torn out before they could even process the attack. The other dozen had attempted to fight back, but lost against the beast that assaulted them.

Since going on the run, he'd been feeding every few days. This time, I was sure he hadn't eaten in a week. He knew I was closing in. He must have been starving to target a place like this.

I moved through the carnage, verifying each body was deceased.

"Bastard!"

I turned to leave when a faint whimper froze me in place. A child was hidden somewhere here. Amid the overpowering odors of booze, piss, and blood, I'd missed the scent of a child.

"It's alright, you can come out. I won't harm you."

I waited, but nothing stirred and the child fell silent. Why had Gabriel left a child alive? He'd killed Sebastian's children without hesitation.

"Pinky promise?" a small voice called out.

It had been years since I'd heard that phrase. A smile touched my lips. "Pinky promise."

A little girl crawled from behind a curtain. Blood stained her face. Fading bruises marked her plump cheeks alongside dried tear tracks. A floral dress that might have been yellow or white was now filthy and torn. It hung loosely on her, indicating she'd been here for some time.

She stepped toward me, trembling. Tears welled in her bright green eyes as she struggled not to look at the devastation around us. She halted meters away, a chain attached to her ankle preventing further movement.

Not only was she imprisoned, she was a Wolf pup. Either Gabriel had been too preoccupied to notice her, or he'd left her for me, knowing it would buy him time.

"What's your name?"

She squeezed her eyes shut, chewing her bottom lip. "Charlotte."

"How old are you, Charlotte?" Dark circles shadowed her eyes.

"Six."

"Do you know how long you've been here?"

She shook her head, matted brown hair falling around her face. "You smell strange."

"So do you."

She smiled, opening her vivid green eyes. "Are you like me?"

"No, but I know many who are." She knew she was a Wolf, which was promising.

I had two choices. One, take her to the police, but that would raise questions I couldn't answer. Or two, turn back and take her to Obsidian Howl, letting my brother escape.

"Let's get you out of that, shall we?" I smiled, crouching to examine the chain.

She froze when my hand touched her leg, and my stomach turned at what these monsters might have done to her. Perhaps Gabriel's choice of bar wasn't entirely bad.

The ankle cuff broke easily in my hands, clearly designed for Charlotte's strength.

"Are you chasing the bad man?" she asked as I lifted her over the corpses.

"I am."

"He smelled strange too." She wrapped her arms around my neck, sensing my safety. Children her age were resilient compared to adults. They saw things in simple terms, which made them easy targets.

I found keys on the bar. Grabbing them, I carried Charlotte outside and pressed the fob, waiting for car lights to flash.

I settled her into the blue BMW, noticing a blanket on the back seat. I draped it over her. She remained quiet as I secured her seatbelt. When I told her I was taking her somewhere safe, she smiled and relaxed into the seat.

Charlotte was asleep by the time I reached the police station. Her head tilted against the seatbelt, long eyelashes resting on her cheeks.

I gazed at the bustling police station.

She would be safer here than at Obsidian Howl. They could find her a good home, likely with humans, but she'd be protected. If I took her to Obsidian Howl, Gabriel might return, though she'd be among her own kind.
###Chapter 0195

"Damn it!"

I slammed my foot on the accelerator.

The car surged forward.

I hoped this was the right choice for the child.

The drive back to Obsidian Howl took nearly a week.

Each night, I stopped at a motel.

We both needed proper rest.

I made sure we were fed.

Not once did she ask for food.

My guess was they starved her.

Or only fed her when they felt like it.

She had learned to wait.

To ignore the hunger pains.

The first day, she ate like an animal.

Lapping up food with her mouth.

She couldn't hold a cup without spilling.

She had no idea how to use utensils.

She had been their pet.

The age tag in her dress said 2-3 years.

She'd likely been the bar's property for years.

Charlotte was thrilled when I bought her clothes.

But she didn't understand changing daily.

She insisted the pink dress was her favorite.

She wanted to wear it constantly.

So I bought several identical ones.

She could have a fresh one each day.

A hotel staff member gave her a teddy bear.

She carried it everywhere after that.

How could people be so cruel?

Desiring to lock up a child was sickening.

Approaching Obsidian Howl, two Wolves stopped me.

They smiled when they recognized me.

"Is he dead?" one asked.

"Not yet."

I glanced at sleeping Charlotte.

The man nodded understandingly.

He waved me through.

I parked before the pack house.

Isabella's furious shouts reached me before I exited the car.

She was clearly enraged about something.

Probably equally angry with me.

I hadn't spoken to her since leaving.

I circled the car.

Lifting a drowsy Charlotte from the passenger seat.

She peered at me with one eye.

"Are we there yet?"

It had become her favorite question.

Asked multiple times daily.

"We are."

She straightened her spine.

Her bright green eyes widened at the massive house.

"Home?" she mumbled.

"Home."

Technically, it wasn't my decision.

But I knew Athena wouldn't reject her.

Especially upon learning Charlotte's origins.

I pushed the door open.

Sebastian, Isabella, and Alexander stood inside.

All glaring at each other.

Alexander's crimson eyes found me first.

Isabella slowly turned toward me.

Her emotions flooded through our bond.

Her hands clasped to her chest.

"You're... you're here." She breathed out.

Her dark eyes shifted to Charlotte.

She frowned momentarily before softening.

Likely realizing Charlotte was a wolf.

"This is Isabella." I told the child. "The one I mentioned."

"Your girlfriend?" Charlotte smiled at my mate.

"Yes. And this is Alexander. He's in charge."

"The Al...pha?"

She'd picked up terms quickly during our lessons.

"And that man is Sebastian, he's Alexander's..."

"Beta." She finished for me.

I felt like a proud parent.

She'd learned so much in such short time.

"I'm Charlotte." She muttered shyly.

Isabella stared at me.

I expected more words.

But she stepped forward with a slight limp.

"Hey Charlotte, come with me. Let the men talk."

She reached for the child I carried.

Charlotte looked to me first.

"She's good." I assured her. "She's a doctor."

I set her down.

She took Isabella's hand.

As they walked away, I heard her telling my mate about her pink dress and teddy bear.

"I assume he's dead." Alexander muttered once the office door closed.

"No. I encountered a problem."

"So you brought her here?"

"She's a Wolf."

"Why not take her to her pack?"

"She was held hostage. Likely for years. Doesn't know her parents' names. Only aware she's different from the men who kept her as a pet."

Understanding dawned in his eyes.

"He killed her captors?"

"Yes. Either too frenzied to notice her hiding. Or he knew I'd help her and used her to escape."

I looked toward Sebastian.

His face was thunderous.

He hadn't spoken a word.

I smelled alcohol on his clothes.

Now Isabella's shouting made sense.

"You take responsibility for her." Alexander's strange eyes darkened. "You brought her here, you care for her."

"Of course."

"That means no more solo missions. We work together, not alone."
###Chapter 0196
Athena

A strange scent filled my senses before I even opened my eyes.
An unfamiliar Wolf.
I kept my eyes shut, pretending to sleep.
Alexander had to be nearby.
He wouldn't leave me alone yet.
This Wolf couldn't be a threat.

"Let her sleep, Charlotte."
Who was Charlotte?
"She has babies in her tummy." Isabella told this Charlotte person.
"It makes her tired."

"She's very pretty."
A small voice whispered.
I opened my eyes to find a young girl inches from my face.
Wide bright green eyes stared back at me.
Dimples appeared on each cheek as she smiled.
"Hi."

"Hi." I muttered, confused.
Where had she come from?

She hurried back to the desk and plopped into Alexander's chair.
She clutched a small teddy bear to her chest while doodling on paper.

Isabella smiled at me as I swung my legs off the bed.
"Zachary is back and he brought us a friend. This is Charlotte."

Charlotte ignored us completely.
Her tongue stuck out as she concentrated on her drawing.

"Does that mean...?"
"No." Isabella cut me off before I could finish.
"He is out there," she pointed to the door, "with Alexander, discussing it."
A shiver went down her spine.
She visibly shook it off.

"What are you not telling me?"

She glanced at Charlotte, choosing her words carefully.
"The boys weren't Sebastian's. We think they were... Julian's. Remember everything about him and Natalie. It seems it was going on much longer than he led us to believe."

"Are you serious?"

"Are they dead?" Charlotte asked without looking up.
Neither of us realized she was listening.

"You don't need to worry about that." Isabella muttered.

"Was it the monster? The monster killed lots of people." She still didn't look up. "Then my new Daddy found me."

I watched the color drain from Isabella's face.
She turned whiter than the paper Charlotte was drawing on.

"Your new Daddy?" I asked.
I still didn't understand why he brought her here.
I had only been asleep a few hours.
Yet I had missed so much.

"He broke my bracelet and carried me to a car. He got me the best food. He told me who you all are." Her bright green eyes caught mine as she looked up. "Alpha Athena." She put her pen down and held up a paper covered in squiggles. "Do you like my picture?"

She drew like a two-year-old.
Like me when I couldn't hold a pen properly.

The door swung open.
Alexander, Zachary and Sebastian strolled in.
Zachary went straight to Charlotte.
"What are you drawing, Lottie?"

"The monster, Daddy."

"Lottie, we talked about this. I'm not your Daddy. Call me Uncle Zachary."

Her face scrunched up as she thought.
I saw relief on Isabella's face.
Motherhood wasn't something she was ready for.
Especially not to someone who wasn't her child.
I wasn't even sure if I was ready.
The only difference was, I was already a mother.
My boys would be here soon.

"Everyone needs a Daddy." Charlotte grinned.

My eyes flickered around the room.
Only Sebastian and my sons had a father.

"Please?" I saw tears building in her bright green eyes.

Zachary squatted next to the chair.
Before he could speak, she threw her arms around his neck.
She sobbed into him.

Looking at Isabella, she seemed stunned by the whole situation.

Zachary lifted Charlotte from the chair.
He held her against him as she continued to cry.
His dark eyes looked pained.
I wondered how often he had helped other little kids.
His human past slowly creeping up on him with one little Wolf.

Charlotte's sobbing stopped.
An arm fell from Zachary's neck.
She had cried herself to sleep.

"Do you want to set her up in the room next to Isabella's?" Alexander offered. "I assume you'll sleep there tonight and want her close by."

Zachary shook his head.
"Holding her is the only way to stop the nightmares." He swayed back and forth with her against his chest.

Nightmares.
I had lived with them for years.
Fought against them every night.
Eventually, my mind became so used to them, they became a comfort.
They stopped a few years before Alexander came into my life.

"Where did you find her?" I asked when I heard her subtle snores.

Zachary told us everything.
The bracelet Charlotte mentioned was a chain.
It kept her locked up as a pet.
###Chapter 0197

The thought made my stomach churn. “Did they… touch her?”

“Not in that way, I believe.” Zachary’s voice was low. “I questioned her carefully. They made her crawl. Drink from a bowl like an animal. Threw scraps at her. Forced her to sleep on cold floors. She has some bruises, but nothing more.”

“Her parents?”

“All humans. No other wolves. Gabriel killed every one of them.” He sighed. “She’s six. Spent most of her life in chains. It’s a miracle she isn’t completely wild.”

I was six when my world fell apart. She was even younger. Didn’t understand why any of this was happening.

“You brought her here because of me,” I whispered, watching the sleeping child in his arms.

“Yes.” His answer was immediate.

“What about Gabriel?” Isabella’s voice was tense. “He’ll come straight for her.”

“She’s safer here among wolves and Lycans. At least she can learn what she is. Imagine if she shifted among humans with no control.”

His words dragged Caleb back into my mind. I shoved the memory away. How much of what he said was even true?

“Alright,” I murmured.

“Thank you, Athena. You won’t regret this.”

Zachary’s gaze shifted to Isabella. She had been quiet. “Alexander, would you mind holding Lottie? I need to speak with my mate.”

“She’s your responsibility, Zachary,” Alexander warned.

“He will.” I cut in.

Alexander shot me a look but held out his arms. Charlotte snuggled against his chest. The sight of him holding her made my heart swell.

He noticed my expression. “Are you okay?”

I smiled and nodded. Maybe things would be alright.

Alexander set up a small fold-out bed in our room for Charlotte. Zachary and Isabella were still talking outside. It was getting late.

He had skipped the pack run again. Tonight’s events made it necessary.

Charlotte was still asleep when he laid her down. He tucked the blanket around her and made sure her teddy bear was close. I didn’t know how long I’d been asleep when the whimpering started.

I sat up and turned on the lamp. Alexander was already moving toward her. He wasn’t happy about wearing shorts to bed.

She lashed out as he tried to calm her. Her nails scratched his cheek. The marks vanished instantly.

“She doesn’t know it’s you,” I said softly. Her eyes were squeezed shut. Sweat beaded on her forehead. She began to cry, calling out for “Daddy.”

“Charlotte,” I whispered. “It’s Athena. You’re safe.”

“Daddy!” she screamed.

Our door nearly splintered as Zachary burst in.

Her cries softened into sobs as he gathered her into his arms. He murmured soothing words to her.

“Say what you want, Zachary,” Alexander smirked. “But you’re a dad now.”

Isabella paced my room. Her limp was less noticeable now. “What am I supposed to do, Athena? He was gone for a month. Comes back with another female.”

“A child,” I corrected. It was too early for this.

“I’m not ready to be a mother. I thought we’d have amazing sex. Instead, he brings someone else.”

“A six-year-old.”

“How am I supposed to compete with that?”

“He doesn’t want you to compete. You’re his mate.”

“She calls him Daddy.”

“I know.”

“It’s insane.”

“It’s not. He saved her from a nightmare. It would’ve gotten worse as she grew. He protected her. Like a father should.” Unlike my own.

“I’m jealous of a six-year-old!” She groaned and dropped into the chair by the window.

“Basically. But she’s more like you than him. She’ll need guidance. Help understanding she’s a wolf. Zachary can’t do that alone. Give her time to adjust.”

She nodded. “Look at you. So understanding.”

“I know what it’s like to live in fear.”
###Chapter 0198
Unknown POV

"Yes?" I murmur, swirling the wine in my glass before taking a large gulp. It had been an exhausting day, and the last thing I needed was another fool wasting my time.

He approaches me like a lost puppy. His dark hair is disheveled, and he looks and smells like he hasn't seen a shower in weeks.

"You better start talking if you're going to invade my space with that stench."

"I'm looking for a favor." He says quietly.

"I don't do favors." I sneer, setting my empty glass down on the circular table.

He slides into my booth anyway. "You're the Lone Wolf, right?"

I smirk. I hadn't heard that term in ages. "Oh honey, I'm the furthest thing from a Lone Wolf."

"Right. Because you're not a Wolf, are you."

The nerve of this guy. "You think you know everything." I signal the bartender who brings me a fresh drink. His eyes dart to the trash sitting across from me, and he quickly looks away.

It was a rule here that I am not to be disturbed. Especially not when I still had blood on my fingers.

"I know enough. One of your kind killed my mate." He seethes. I couldn't suppress my laugh. "And I want revenge."

"Did you piss it off?"

He glares at me. If he weren't so filthy, he might actually be handsome. Maybe then I wouldn't mind the interruption.

"No. My brother brought their kind into our pack. A Rogue followed. The Rogue was the one who murdered her."

"So let me guess, you blame big brother and now you want revenge." I let the merlot slide down my throat. I preferred something much fuller-bodied, but this was the best the bar offered.

"I didn't say big brother."

"You didn't need to. If your brother brought them into the pack, my guess is he's the Alpha, which makes you the poor little brother."

I hit a soft spot. I can see it in his dark eyes.

"Ah, was the dream to be an Alpha?"

Fucking alphas and their need for control.

"And now what? You want to claim it back. I can't help you." Nor did I want to help. He was focusing on the wrong person to begin with.

"Our pack was fine until they arrived. And it all started with one." He clenches his fist and slams it into the table, nearly knocking my wine glass over. If that had spilled on me, I might have just stabbed him in the neck with the glass.

"That's not my problem."

"Rumor has it that you accept jobs for a decent amount of cash."

"And that's what you have, is it? Look at the state of you, you might as well have slept in a hole in the ground."

"I've been a little busy."

"Mourning your dead mate."

He nods, lowering his head as he rolls his neck.

"Right." I get to my feet. "I can't give you the help you're looking for. Correct that, I won't."

"I think you'll change your mind." He calls out after me as I stride away.

He catches up to me, standing far too close for my liking. His breath, the only clean thing about him, fans across my skin. "You're a Harrison, right."

I spin around to glare at him, my hand locking against his throat while pressing my stiletto heel into the toe of his boots. "Where the fuck did you hear that name?"

"My brother's mate is a Lycan."

"Impossible. Wolves are not mated to Lycans."

"That's just it, all three of us were. And my brother is mated to the most powerful one. The female Alpha."

My hand moves from his throat to his grubby jacket as I drag him to the ladies' room.

He laughs as I slam the door shut and push him back against the pink tiles.

"You better start talking. Because I am seconds away from ripping your throat out."
###Chapter 0199
“Or what?” He laughs darkly.

“You won’t be my first kill tonight. What’s your name?”

“Julian.” He answers without hesitation. Definitely his real name.

“Your brother’s pack?”

“Obsidian Howl.”

A cold laugh escapes me. “So Alexander is your brother.”

Disappointment flashes across his dirty face. “You know him?”

“I know of him. Only a fool wouldn’t know his reputation.” And I had made sure to stay far away from him. It wasn’t like I advertised what I was. “You’re telling me he’s mated to the last female Lycan Alpha.”

He nods. He just made my entire fucking week. Maybe my year.

“What are you to her?” He asks softly.

“Why does that matter?” I study him a moment longer. “Are you ready to do whatever I ask?”

He nods.

“It will tear your pack apart.”

His mouth opens and closes like a fish. He’s finally understanding what I mean.

“What is it?”

“My twin. I don’t want to hurt her, but she’s also mated to a Lycan. The bastard who killed my mate hurt her too.”

I lean back against the ugly pink tiles. “Then you have a choice to make. Either way, you’ve already given me what I need.”

“This is wrong. I shouldn’t… I shouldn’t be here. I shouldn’t have said anything.” He tries to push past me. I lift my leg, blocking the door with my foot. His eyes linger on it too long.

“You should’ve thought of that earlier. You clearly know who I am.”

“It wasn’t easy to find someone like you. I thought there were no more of your kind left. Just Athena and the ones who were turned.”

Hearing her name sends a sharp thrill through me. Does she even know I exist? I don’t care. I’m taking what’s mine.

“Oh honey, there are thousands of us. You just need to know where to look.”

“Thousands?” His dark eyes go wide.

“Thousands.”

He looks like he just stepped in shit.

“Packs?”

“No. Where’s the fun in that?” I look him over. “Come with me. We have a lot to discuss.”

I lead him to my Porsche. I watch him carefully before letting him sit on the clean leather.

“How long have you known Athena?” I’m curious. How long has she been happy with her mate?

“Almost a year. I don’t want her to suffer.” He mutters. “She’s been through enough. And she’s pregnant.”

Perfect.

“Julian, you came to the wrong person if you just want to scare them. I don’t do half-measures. And now you’ve handed me my target. Besides, if we go after Alexander, she will get hurt.”

I reach over and grip his thigh. Maybe he deserves a reward for this.

“Did you know Dominic?” He asks as I pull into my driveway.

“Doesn’t ring a bell. Another problem?”

“No. Athena handled that.” I know what he’s doing. He’s trying to figure out my connection.

I send him to shower. I don’t want his stench in my house. When he comes back, he’s wearing the smallest towel. It barely covers him. He looks much better clean.

“Do you have anything bigger?” He asks. Water drips from his hair onto the carpet. I watch one droplet trail down his chest and abs, vanishing into the towel.

It isn’t right. I know. But it’ll have to do.

It’s been too long since I’ve had a good time. This wasn’t the plan, but I can’t help imagining him pressed against me.

He smirks at me. Then he turns around and walks away, giving me a full view of his firm ass.
###Chapter 0200
Alexander

I settled into the large chair, scanning the shadows across the grounds. A full week had passed since Zachary's return. Still no trace of Gabriel. Perhaps that was for the best. Maybe he finally understood he couldn't get what he wanted from us. Until I had more information, the grounds would remain heavily guarded.

Glancing over my shoulder, I saw Athena still deep in sleep. She was curled into a ball, hands cradling her bump. Completely undisturbed by my absence beside her.

She looks so peaceful. Titan murmured.

She's breathtaking. I whispered back to my Wolf.

With Gabriel gone, she had become significantly calmer. Isabella insisted it was just a phase in her pregnancy where she gained temporary clarity. Even if it was fleeting.

I was immensely relieved. There was a moment I truly believed the darkness would claim her forever.

The same darkness I had once found intriguing in her.

Her heart rate shifted. She stretched out slowly. You're watching me again. She mumbled, still half-asleep, eyes remaining closed.

I will never stop watching you.

She didn't respond. The steady rhythm of her heart told me she had drifted back into slumber.

My eyes flicked to the clock. It was nearly four in the morning. The guard shift change was imminent.

Movement caught my eye on the far side of the grounds. A figure emerged from the shadows. Theodore was heading this way, arms laden with books, his pace quick and urgent.

I groaned softly, pushing myself up. I moved to the bed, pressing a gentle kiss to Athena's cheek. She didn't stir, but a faint smile touched her lips. A kiss was all she permitted these days. She claimed pregnancy made sex too uncomfortable. Once the twins arrived, I would remind her of all she'd been missing.

Slipping out the door, I descended the stairs. I found Theodore poised to knock on my office door.

"Theodore, it's four in the morning."

"I apologize, Alexander, but this couldn't wait." He was practically beaming.

I gestured for him to enter. He hurriedly dropped the stack of books onto my desk. "You recall how difficult it was to find information on Athena and other Lycans. How everything was ancient history, mere fragments."

"I remember, Theodore." I stifled a yawn.

"Remember what Sophia said? About the humans having stories?"

"Get to the point." I snapped, my exhaustion evident.

"I've been scouring libraries and bookstores in the city and nearby towns. If these books hold even a grain of truth, I believe there are more Lycans out there."

"What are you talking about?"

He eagerly opened one of the books. "This one." He was visibly excited. "It discusses how Lycans revealed themselves to humans roughly five centuries ago. It mentions a war between them. Massive casualties on both sides, but ultimately, the humans claimed victory."

"Okay."

"There's no mention of Lycans being wiped out, Alexander. Just that the humans won. Don't you see? They survived."

"We can't assume that. I've never encountered any." I had treaties with numerous packs. None had secrets as deep as Silver Creek's.

He shook his head, opening another book. "This one also discusses the war, but it claims the Lycans were victorious."

"If Lycans won the war, humans likely wouldn't exist."

"That was my thought. But there's more. This text says the Lycans won, but their numbers were too depleted to conquer the world after such heavy losses." He smiled, then frowned. "They needed time to repopulate. They couldn't do that with humans aware of them. They went into hiding. They let the humans believe they had won."

Hiding? Where? Titan muttered. I repeated the question to Theodore.

"It's not specified. I've searched the entire book. No location is mentioned. It only stresses the importance of keeping Lycan existence a secret."

"Why were we never taught about this war in school?"

"Think about it. If they wanted to hide, the last thing they needed was humans or Wolves uncovering this information years later." His deep green eyes met mine. "We were taught about a war, Alexander. Recall your history."

"The Great Wolf War."

He nodded. "It was known as that. But what if that was just a cover? I feel like a complete fool. Of course the Lycans worked to erase all information. But then why would someone write a book?"

I raised an eyebrow. "It probably wasn't meant to be found. It was likely intended to stay within the Lycan community."

"You're probably right." He tapped the book, more excited than ever. "The author was a leader in that war. He constantly emphasized the importance of a bloodline. His bloodline, to be precise."

He closed the very old book and handed it to me. The title was etched on the cover: "The War." By Aldous Harrison.
###Chapter 0201

Harrison. It was an unusual surname. Among all the Wolves and the scarce Lycans I had encountered, Athena was the sole bearer of that name remaining.

"An ancestor?" I whispered, turning the aged brown book in my hands.

"Most likely, judging by how he discusses bloodlines. Athena is a female Alpha. Her genetics had to originate from somewhere."

"Are the Lycans a threat?"

"I'm uncertain." He muttered. "It mentions their resurgence, but that was centuries ago, Alexander. Any from that era would be long deceased. We're dealing with descendants now."

"Zachary has always maintained there are more out there. Are you implying my mate wasn't merely leading Moonshine but leads all Lycans in existence?"

He gave a slow nod.

"Has anyone else been informed?"

"No, I came directly to you."

"Good. Maintain that silence. I must determine my next course of action."

More Lycans. Could they endanger our kind? What if others like Gabriel exist? Too wild, too uncontrollable.

"She couldn't control Gabriel." I murmured. "Not entirely."

"Zachary mentioned something related to that. It connects to the rejection. Similar to Julian. Julian rejected you as his Alpha and renounced the pack. Salem likely did the same, probably long before encountering her. I'm no longer certain. New details are emerging constantly."

"You genuinely believe that?"

He sucked in his cheeks. "I only trust what I read and what I witness personally."

"I need to speak with Zachary."

Theodore trailed me upstairs. I knocked on Isabella's door, calling for Zachary, only to find him emerging from the adjacent room where Charlotte now slept.

He yawned, checking his watch. "A bit early, isn't it?"

I gestured to the door he was closing. "Is she alright?"

"Still some nightmares. She's improving gradually."

Zachary settled into the chair in my office, legs apart, leaning forward with elbows on his knees. "So I was correct."

"It appears so, yes. Why did you suspect there were more?"

"Shortly before I was bitten, Victoria would speak to me. She lamented that I wasn't a true Lycan. Muttered about how I would have been a valuable specimen in the Lycan pool, but as a bitten Lycan, I could never match the genuine article." He chuckled. "If only she could see me now."

"That doesn't confirm more exist."

"You're right. But when I questioned her, she never provided a clear answer. To me, that implies there was, and is, far more than I knew. Far more than any of us know."

"But you've traveled extensively. You've never encountered any?"

"Other than Brianna and the Rogues, no. Even during my hunt for Gabriel, I never detected any Lycan scents."

"So it might be entirely false."

"Come on, Alexander. We both know you don't believe that." Zachary shook his head. "What if they've discovered a method to conceal themselves?"

"You mean masking their scents?"

"Exactly."

I glanced at Theodore. "What's your opinion?"

"Perhaps there is some truth to his words." He shrugged.

"So there could be hundreds more?"

"It's a vast country. They could be hiding anywhere. Didn't you mention Silver Creek hid in trees?" Zachary pressed.

I nodded.

"What if they chose the opposite? What if they went underground?"

Both fell silent. Waiting for my response.

"We will take no action." I stated after consulting with Titan.

They both raised their eyebrows in surprise.

"Athena will give birth in approximately a month. We already have enough trouble with Gabriel and his potential return. Plus, you have Charlotte. I cannot handle additional complications now."

"But..." Zachary began.

"No. I am constantly monitoring my mate for any changes. What do you think discovering more Lycans would do to her? She doesn't need that stress. And I certainly don't need it either."

"They are her kind. The kind of your soon-to-be-born pups."

"I am doing what is best for my mate. And you will remain silent. I mean it, Zachary. If a single word of this reaches her, you will regret it."

He snorted.

"You haven't witnessed what I am capable of. I will do whatever is necessary to protect my mate."

My eyes flicked to Theodore, who had already lowered his head in submission to my tone. But Zachary held my gaze.

"Fine." He snapped. "But I'm warning you, this will backfire. If I've learned anything about your mate, my Alpha, she absolutely despises secrets. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to check on Lottie."

He slammed my office door shut behind him.

Under different circumstances, I might have pursued answers for Athena. They had remained hidden for centuries. A little longer wouldn't cause any harm.
###Chapter 0202
Zachary

Convincing Isabella to come into the city with me was surprisingly quick. I had a whole speech prepared, ready to persuade her. She still wasn't comfortable with Lottie calling me Daddy, but she understood the child needed more than the few clothes I'd bought.

"So a family outing?" She asks with a raised eyebrow.

"I just need to get more things for Lottie. I thought you could ensure I don't miss anything."

"Is Charlotte coming with us?" She pulls a blue shirt over her head.

"No, Athena said she'll watch her. I think she's hoping it'll prepare her for what's coming." I chuckle.

"You know it's still not safe out there."

"I'll be with you the entire time."

"I'm not worried about that. I know you'll protect me as best you can. But can you separate yourself from Charlotte? She's your shadow when she's awake."

I understood what she left unspoken. We hadn't had much time alone together. If Lottie wasn't following me around during the day, I was spending nights comforting her through night terrors.

I step closer, capturing her lips with mine. She gasps at my sudden movement.

"Is this what you've been missing?" My hand cups her pussy, the thin fabric of her panties the only barrier between my fingers and her arousal.

Her chest rises and falls against mine.

"You." she whispers, rolling her hips against my hand while keeping her dark eyes locked on mine.

Her panties are soaked. A deep growl rumbles through my chest as I pull the wet fabric away, letting it drop to the floor.

My fingertips graze her wetness and she moans softly, pushing herself further into my hand.

"Take off your shirt."

She keeps her dark eyes on mine as she lifts the shirt over her head. Before it's completely off, I take a hardened nipple into my mouth, swirling my tongue over the tip, enjoying her involuntary groans.

She struggles between moaning and unfastening my shirt buttons. She pauses when my fingers find that sweet spot.

Her head tips back slowly. "Zachary." she gasps as her juices coat my hand.

She bites her bottom lip, the way she always does when she's about to climax. Holding it in before letting it consume her entirely.

I push her back onto the bed. A flash of shock and disappointment crosses her face until I position myself between her thighs, the tip of my cock poised at her entrance.

She lifts her hips, trying to bring me closer. Her wet folds graze the tip of my cock, making it jerk in response.

She surprises me, pulling me onto the bed so she's straddling my hips. A growl rumbles low inside me as she hovers that sweet pussy above my cock, letting her juices drip onto it.

"You think you're in control?" I mutter, gripping her hips, knowing my fingers are probably already bruising her soft skin.

She leans forward and plants a soft kiss on the corner of my lips. "I know I am."

I flip her over, pushing her body into the bed and sinking myself into her. Her lips part slightly and she lets out a groan at the sudden invasion.

Hooking her good leg around my hip, she smiles. "See."

I had played right into her hands and I fucking loved it.

Our hips rock together as my cock slides in and out of her wetness. She pushes her breasts against me. I can feel our hearts beating as one as she finds her euphoria.

I slam into her repeatedly, watching her mouth open as my name tears from her lips.

My thumb quickly finds her swollen clit, circling it as I continue to fuck her. I was far from finished, and so was she. She just didn't know it yet.

I pull her back on top. My cock still buried deep inside her. "Ride it."
###Chapter 0203

“I’m not sure I can,” she whispered, her gaze falling to her injured leg.

I gripped her hips firmly, shifting her as I thrust deeper. Her lips parted softly as another wave of pleasure began to build.

She braced her hands against my chest, riding me with slow, deliberate movements. A soft groan escaped her each time she sank all the way down.

“Oh, Zachary.” Her eyes squeezed shut, head tilting back as her inner muscles clenched around me, drawing my release until I spilled into her.

She collapsed against my chest, our ragged breaths mingling. She looked up at me through her lashes, a silent question in her eyes.

I already knew what she wanted to ask. She wished we could stay like this, hidden away from everything, if only for a little while.

But the words never left her lips. She swallowed them back, knowing the answer before she even spoke. The small voice calling for me from outside shattered the moment.

“Is it always going to be like this? Interrupted by your child?” She gave a weak smile.

I winked. “She’s your child now, too.”

Instead of frowning, she slid off me and moved carefully toward the bathroom. Her limp was barely noticeable, though the pain lingered. She would always carry the scar, the missing muscle—a permanent reminder. Yet my chest swelled with pride at how fiercely she’d adapted.

“Lottie,” I called out, grateful I’d locked the door when I heard the handle jiggle. “Go find Athena or Alexander. I’ll be down soon.”

Her small footsteps pattered down the hall, likely dragging that worn teddy bear along with her.

I found my mate already under the shower spray, water sluicing down her curves. Her nipples pebbled under the heat. My cock throbbed as I watched her hand glide over her wet skin, down to her core.

She traced slow circles over her clit, fingers dipping into her folds as she leaned back into the water.

“I know you’re watching me, Zachary.” Her voice was husky, and my length twitched in response.

She directed the shower head between her legs, a moan tearing from her throat. I couldn’t hold back any longer.

I yanked the door open. She dropped the shower head as I lifted her, her legs locking around my waist. I pinned her against the cool tiles, consumed by raw hunger.

Her arms wound around my neck, lips crashing against mine. Our tongues tangled as she rocked against me, teasing my erection.

I gripped her ass, hoisting her higher, folding her almost in half as I brought her knees over my shoulders and pressed her firmly against the wall.

“Zachary!” Her eyes flew wide as I entered her. She thought she’d taken me deep before—this was something else entirely.

I thrust once. Her mouth fell open in a soundless gasp.

I captured her lips, molding them to mine.

Withdrawing slightly, I drove into her again. Her body shuddered against mine, her teeth grazing my lip. She was already clenching around me by the time I thrust a third time. Fuck, she felt incredible.

She tried to buck against me, but this angle left her powerless. All she could do was dig her nails into my skin as orgasm after orgasm ripped through her. She screamed my name.

My pace slowed as her tightness pulled me over the edge once more.

She lowered her legs but kept them wrapped around my hips. Her heart hammered against her ribs as she stared at me, dazed.

She seemed stunned by the intensity of her release.

Isabella’s feet touched the shower floor. I steadied her as she swayed, legs weak from how thoroughly I’d taken her. Clearly, she’d never been fucked like that—not even during her heat with me.
###Chapter 0204

She remains silent as I lift the shower head back into place. I take the shower gel, working it into a lather across her skin while she leans heavily against me.

She still hadn't uttered a word by the time I finished washing her hair. I started to worry I’d pushed her too far.

“Isabella?”

“Yeah?” Her voice comes out unusually high. I suppress a laugh rising in my throat. She was still floating.

It takes a solid thirty minutes for her to seem grounded again. Her dark eyes meet mine, then drop to the outfit she wore. A simple blue tee and matching jeans. I’m surprised she managed to dress herself, given how dazed she’d been.

“What did you do to me?”

“Gave you exactly what you asked for.” I smirk. “I think you were in a sort of mid-heat cycle from my extended absence.”

“Right.” She moves to the closet, pulling out combat boots and slowly lacing them up.

She stands, a soft smile gracing her features as she looks at me. “No one has ever made me feel like that.”

We’re nearly finished in the city. Isabella had spent a significant portion of my money ensuring Charlotte was equipped for what seemed like the next decade.

We’re loading the last bags into the car when she freezes. I know why. I caught his scent, too.

I glance up. She’s standing rigid, staring past me, all color drained from her face as if she’s seen a ghost.

I turn, following her line of sight to Julian. He isn’t looking our way initially, too engrossed in a phone conversation.

Seconds tick by before his eyes lock onto us. I see his lips form the word ‘shit!’

He shoves the phone into his pocket and spins on his heel.

“What is he doing?” Isabella mutters as he retreats. “I thought he’d at least be happy to see me.”

“Whoever he was talking to must be important.” I slam the car door shut.

“Zachary, don’t.” Isabella grabs my arm. “He clearly doesn’t want to see us.”

“I just need to ask him what he did with Sophia. For Athena.” I add when she shakes her head in protest.

She hesitates but releases my arm. She tells me she’s staying behind, waiting in the car.

I keep my distance, tracking his scent through the winding streets until I spot him with a woman. A Lycan woman.

I knew I was right. I knew there were more. But why would Julian seek out another Lycan after what happened to Sophia?

Julian looks panicked, his hands gesturing wildly. She stands perfectly still, her back to me, hiding her identity. Her arms are crossed. Dark hair falls just below her shoulders.

Her feet are wedged into ridiculously high heels. One foot taps impatiently on the concrete.

Her hand snaps out, gripping his chin, forcing his face toward hers. Seriously, Julian? You just lost your mate and you’re already with another Lycan.

She releases him. He circles a Porsche, sliding into the passenger seat. As the female Lycan turns, I get a clear look at her face just before she gets into the driver’s side.

She looked like Athena. Same dark hair, same sharp facial structure. Except for the eyes. While Athena’s are a striking blue, this woman’s are a deep brown. That was the only discernible difference.

The car speeds past. I press myself flat against the brick wall. The moment it’s out of sight, I sprint back to Isabella and leap into the driver’s seat.

“We have to go. Now.”

“What did you see?” Her voice is laced with panic.

“Isabella, I…” My foot slams the accelerator. The car lurches forward as I speed out of the city toward home.

“Zachary, you’re scaring me!” Her hands clutch the edges of her seat as the car races down the road.

“Julian was with another woman.”

“Seriously?” she snaps, irritation flashing in her eyes.

“A Lycan woman.”
###Chapter 0205
Alexander

"Tell me this is a joke." I growl at Zachary standing in my office. He was only supposed to get supplies for Charlotte.

It has to be. Titan mutters. Julian would be an idiot to stay this close. Surely Aspen wouldn't agree to this.

I sigh. "He probably is. Aspen lost Sophia too."

I know what I saw, Alexander. Zachary cuts into my conversation with my Wolf. I knew I was right. I knew there were more out there. He mumbles. I didn't need a damn book to prove it.

I raise my hands to silence him while processing Julian's actions. "Alright, so he's involved with another Lycan. Why is that our problem?"

You won't like what I'm about to say. He mutters.

Say it anyway. I snap.

You told me everything Athena endured growing up. You explained how it shaped who she is.

Yes, but—

He interrupts me. Does she have any siblings?

I glare at him, surprised by the question. No. What does that—

Are you completely sure?

I'm ready to punch him for cutting me off again.

No, she doesn't. I told you about the man who claimed to be her brother.

Dominic, yes, but you discovered he was actually her uncle.

I nod. Then there was Caleb who also claimed to be her brother. That was a lie too. He was bitten by Victoria or maybe Dominic, I can't recall exactly. Athena killed him. But what does that have to do with this?

His dark eyes lock with mine. He runs a hand through his stubble, thinking. The woman, she looked just like her.

That means nothing. Titan shrugs.

That doesn't make them siblings. I tell Zachary.

Normally, I'd agree. But the only difference I noticed was her eye color. Alexander, aside from that, they looked identical.

I shake my head. You must be imagining things.

I know what I saw.

Did Isabella see her?

No. He sighs. She didn't want to speak to him, so she waited in the car while I followed. Alexander, I'm telling you, I know what I saw. He went to her, panicking because he knew we spotted him, then they got in a car and drove off.

What were they saying?

I don't know. He shakes his head. I was too focused on figuring out who she was. When I saw her face, I was stunned.

Older or younger?

Impossible to tell. Why does that matter?

Are we believing this? Titan asks.

I don't know. He has no reason to lie.

Well, if this woman is older, Athena would surely remember her. Plus, it would prove they aren't siblings because otherwise, that woman would be the female Alpha, not Athena. And we all know she's the Alpha. You can't deny that.

And what if the woman is younger?

I pause, because I have no answer. Athena was bound. Caleb used that, telling her it erased parts of her memory, which was why she couldn't recall him before his adoption.

What if that was partially true? What if he was hinting at another part of her life and just used that information to get close to Athena?

What if one of her parents had an affair? That would explain why they look so similar. Zachary suggests.

Athena's memories of her parents aren't great. They're overshadowed by their deaths and the revelation that they were the ones who first had her bound. It's a sensitive topic, and I'm not sure she can handle discussing it right now.

I hate keeping so much from her, but for now, it's crucial to keep her calm.

I doubt they were like that. Besides, wouldn't it have killed his mate?

Not if he hadn't met her yet. Zachary mutters.

It seems unlikely.

Were they aware of you? I press, scanning the paperwork on my desk. There's a million things needing attention in the pack.

Not while I was watching. It seemed your brother was more focused on escaping and sleeping with the Lycan.

What a damn surprise! Titan scoffs.

I chuckle, and Zachary raises an eyebrow at me.

He tried his luck with Athena. Several times, actually.

He nods. Isabella told me.

It makes sense he'd sleep with someone who resembles her. Athena was the one he never had a chance with. I lean back in my chair. Julian has sunk to a new low.

That might be your concern, but I'm more interested in how he found her. Lycans don't just wander around. If they did, news of their existence wouldn't be such a shock, right?

I shrug. As long as he stays away from here, I don't give a damn.

He's a pissed-off man, Alexander. Everything I saw suggests he has plans. He's involved in something dangerous, and there's only one reason most people do that. Revenge.

By sleeping with someone who looks like Athena? That's hardly revenge, Zachary. Athena is still my mate. She's still carrying my pups. If he wants to sleep with someone who resembles her, that's his business. It doesn't cause me any issues.

You're missing the point.

Really? And what's that? I narrow my eyes, annoyed by his controlling attitude.

He can't get revenge alone, not against a pack your size. He needs support. Help. His dark eyes lock with mine. It's unlikely Wolves will help him, given your reputation and your ability to twist things in your favor. It's possible he went searching for something and found what none of us have.

It was a Lycan who killed Sophia. I snap.

But he blames you, Alexander. He blames you for bringing us here.

So what do you suggest I do, Zachary? Because it feels like sticking my nose into something that's none of my business. Julian made his choice by rejecting the pack. If he wants to run around sleeping with this Lycan, it's no concern of mine.

She had control. He mutters.

I tilt my head. What are you talking about?

He was panicking. Zachary's frown deepens. Like he was worried we had seen him. He shakes his head. She was the one reassuring him, like she knew what she was doing. She pulled his face to hers and told him to get in the car.

He sighs, straightening his back until it cracks. He's screwed up.

I understand what he's saying. He went to her for help, and now he's trapped helping her?

What the hell have you done, Julian?
###Chapter 0206
Unknown

"Are you finished? You're behaving like a child, not the man I thought I knew. So what if someone saw you?" I refill my wine glass, watching Julian squirm. If this was his usual demeanor, I understood why his brother grew impatient with him.

I tolerated it only because of his skills in bed. He knew exactly how to please me, unlike so many others.

He drifts toward the balcony, peeking through the curtains.

"Trust me, I'd know if we were followed. My guess is he's already run back to the pack to report to your dear older brother."

"What if he saw you? Doesn't that bother you?"

"Oh, he did." I shrug, completely unfazed. He was truly overreacting.

He whips around, dark eyes wide as they lock onto me. "What are you talking about?"

"He was watching you when you told me he'd spotted you. Right before I ordered you into my car."

"You didn't do anything."

"I didn't consider him a threat. Weren't you trying to protect that precious sister of yours?"

"Does he know what you are?" he asks cautiously, sidestepping my question. His assumptions were beginning to shift.

"Depends. Can he distinguish between Lycan and Wolf scents?"

He nods, hair falling into his eyes. He brushes it away impatiently. He desperately needed a haircut. New clothes, too. Perhaps I could mold him into my right-hand man. But not while he looked like a homeless vagrant. That had to change.

"Then he knows."

"That's not good." Julian looks alarmed.

"Relax," I snap. "They don't know my identity, and they won't until it's too late."

"They'll figure it out."

"Unlikely." I take another sip of wine and extend my glass for a refill.

He takes the glass, and I observe his body language shift. His shoulders tense. His jaw clenches, cheek pulsing with irritation.

"Is there something you're not telling me, Julian? You know I value information."

He freezes as wine pours from the bottle.

"I asked about your connection to Athena," he mumbles. "You refused to answer."

"And you've asked repeatedly since then." I run my tongue over my teeth, warning him not to push further. I had no intention of revealing anything yet.

"You look like her."

"WHAT?!" I spring to my feet, glaring at him. My hands curl into fists at my sides.

I shake my head, both amused and astonished. "That's how you found me. You noticed I resembled her."

He remains silent, his grip tightening on the wine bottle. He might consider throwing it at me, but I was faster. He'd be dead before the bottle left his hand.

"What about the name, Lone Wolf? Where did you hear it?"

"I heard it mentioned in another bar. I took a chance. You were sitting alone. Others seemed afraid of you. I noticed blood on your fingers."

He was smarter than he appeared. "And you used the name Harrison."

"Another gamble."

I laugh, a rare occurrence. I had to give him credit. It was a bold move that could have gotten him killed.

I sink back onto the sofa, propping my stilettos on the coffee table. He visibly relaxes, lowering the wine bottle and handing me the glass.

"What was your actual role in Obsidian Howl, besides being the Alpha's little brother?"

"I was the Gamma."

This kept getting better.

"So you have strategic military knowledge?" I was starting to understand why he couldn't attack the pack alone. He knew he'd lose without assistance.

He nods.

I take another drink. "How much do I resemble her?" I'd never seen her. I only knew she stole my chance at a better life.

He kept insisting her life wasn't what I imagined, but I didn't buy that. Our father chose her and her mother over us. All because her mother carried Alpha blood—the same blood that ran through Athena's veins.

"Well?" I demand.

His eyes scan me. "You don't dress like her, that's certain." He pauses at my cleavage. "And your breasts are larger. But aside from the eyes, you're identical. Anyone from Obsidian Howl glancing quickly would mistake you for her."
###Chapter 0207

“Is that the woman you were picturing when you took me last night?” I ask, slowly undoing a button of my shirt.

His voice is a low rumble. “Why would I want her when I’m with you?”

His mouth finds my jaw. He tears open the rest of my shirt, buttons scattering.

“You’re strong,” he whispers into my ear. His breath is hot on my skin. His fingers trace my hardened nipples, sending shivers through me. “You take what you desire.”

His lips brush mine. One hand wraps around my throat. He lifts me from the sofa. A growl escapes me, and he smiles darkly.

“So what is it you want?” I whisper. I’ve asked him before. Choices have consequences. People get hurt.

“Tell me.”

His other hand slips inside my leather pants. Past the thong. He cups me, stroking my clit.

“I want what belongs to me.”

“Are you certain?” My eyes lock with his. Something new flickers there. Hunger. Desire. I’ve reached him.

He pushes two fingers inside me. I bite back a moan. A third stretches me further. I won’t give him the satisfaction. Not until he answers.

His fingers move expertly. Fire builds deep within. It’s getting harder to hold back. He knows my body. Perfectly.

His grip on my throat tightens. Oxygen fades. My body clenches.

“Show me it’s what you want,” I choke out.

He crashes his lips to mine. Muffled sounds escape. A dark smile plays on his lips as he hits that spot. Again and again. “Then scream my name!”

My pussy tightens around his fingers as he releases my throat. “Julian!” I gasp, collapsing toward him.

He holds me up. I ride the waves of pleasure. My hips grind against his hand.

“Take your clothes off,” he orders. No time to recover.

I slowly peel off the leather pants. The thong follows. He strips quickly. His cock is hard. A thick vein runs along its length. I lick my lips. The taste of him is addicting.

He unhooks my bra. His hands roam my breasts. His lips trail my neck. “What if I claimed you?” he murmurs.

“I’d say you need to face your grief first.” I never wanted to be claimed. Especially not by a Wolf.

He drags his teeth along my neck. I freeze. I’m not usually this vulnerable. But now, I’m putty in his hands.

He grabs my hair. Forces me over the arm of the sofa. Slaps my ass. Spreads my legs.

He rubs the tip of his cock against my wetness. “You want this as much as I want revenge.”

I push back. He enters me slightly. Another slap. Pain and pleasure mix.

He reaches around. Circles my swollen clit.

“I could do this every day if you let me claim you.”

I moan as he brings his hand up. Circles my nipples with my own slick.

He thrusts into me. Holds me tight. I buck against him. He’s big. Filling me completely.

“So fucking good,” he grunts from behind. He rocks slowly. Then faster. Driving into me.

Moans escape my lips. Breathless. The fire grows. I tighten around him. He pounds harder. My nipples rub against the sofa. His nails dig into my hips. His desperation matches mine.

“Fuck, Julian!” I growl, begging for release.

One more thrust. My back arches. I scream his name. He fills me with his release.

He collapses on my back. Plants slow, tantalizing kisses on my neck.

“Oh, I more than want it, Seraphina Harrison.”
###Chapter 0208
Athena

"My Daddy said you're different from me." Charlotte mumbled, her face scrunched in concentration as she scribbled on her drawing.

Zachary had returned and was now in the office with Alexander. Isabella had come to find us but kept pacing nervously, chewing on a hangnail.

I watched her with suspicion while Charlotte continued her questioning.

"No, Charlotte. I'm not like you. I'm like Zachary."

"Daddy?"

I nodded as she wrinkled her nose. As far as I knew, Zachary hadn't told her he was a Lycan.

"Isabella."

She froze and met my gaze. "I can't discuss it," she whispered.

"Did you...see Gabriel?" It still troubled me that no one had found him. Maybe someone had killed him and I wouldn't have to deal with that nightmare anymore. That would be a true blessing.

"No." Her answer came too quickly.

"Who's Gabriel?" Charlotte asked from the kitchen table.

She kept drawing but was clearly listening.

"You don't need to worry about that." I forced a smile.

Isabella glared at me, but what did she expect? Tell a six-year-old that the monster who slaughtered her captors was named Gabriel?

"Grown-up things." I added. She shrugged and scribbled more aggressively.

"Okay...okay...I can't do this anymore." She ran hands through her dark hair, chewing her lip while staring at me. "I saw Julian."

"Oh? Is...is he alright?"

"I don't know. We didn't speak."

I almost hugged her. I knew how much she struggled with losing her twin. She still suffered, even if she'd never admit it.

"Alexander followed him. He was with another woman."

I snorted. "Well that didn't take long." He couldn't do anything with Sophia due to her age and the mate bond. Yet everyone knew he couldn't keep his pants on. "Who? Do I know her?"

"I'm not supposed to tell you."

"Isabella, you're scaring me. I hate secrets, you know that."

"Alexander said she looked exactly like you." The words tumbled out as if burning her lips. They came out hushed and rapid.

"That's not difficult. Many people have hair like mine."

She shook her head. "Maybe Alexander should explain this."

"Isabella, please." I murmured. I despised being kept in the dark.

"Perhaps..." Nyx began.

"Not you." I shut her down. My Lycan and I still weren't on speaking terms, and I preferred it that way.

Isabella's dark eyes locked with mine. "He said she was practically your twin."

"What are you saying? That I have another relative out there? Another Lycan?"

"You really should talk to Alexander and Zachary. I'll stay with Charlotte."

I paused with my hand on the door, glancing back at her. She mouthed 'I'm sorry.'

I was sorry too. I'd been dragged through enough lies and secrets. I hated every moment. Yet Alexander still insisted on keeping things from me.

Waddling down the hallway toward the office, I heard Alexander and Zachary's heated argument. They were debating when to tell me.

"It's not fair to keep her in the dark." Zachary snapped.

"She's my mate. I'm protecting her." Alexander retorted.

"Wouldn't she be safer if she knew what she's facing?" Zachary countered. "She's the only female Alpha, and now there's someone who looks just like her roaming the streets. Do you know how many scenarios I've imagined?"

"Look. We still don't know who she is." I imagined Alexander standing, glaring at Zachary. He was so engrossed in the argument he hadn't detected my scent outside the door.

"Julian probably went to her because she resembles Athena." Alexander sighed. "He's like a child, always wanting what he can't have. He's tried fighting me for Alpha multiple times. He challenged Sebastian for Beta. Instead of winning, he chose to sleep with Sebastian's wife. Was he even sorry his children are dead?"
###Chapter 0209
Silence hangs heavy in the air. I can almost picture Alexander shaking his head.

Julian only truly cares about a handful of things. His status within the pack. Getting laid. Stirring up unnecessary drama. And, finally, his sister. How two siblings could be so vastly different was a mystery to me.

My hand hovers at the door, moments from knocking, when it swings open. Alexander stands there, his stunning crimson eyes filled with deep concern as they lock onto mine.

“Is it true?” I whisper, a dull throb beginning to form deep in my stomach.

He frowns. “We don’t know who she is. We don’t know if her connection to Julian is significant. We don’t know if she is even aware of your existence.”

I nod, the pain now radiating down into my lower spine. I grit my teeth, trying to push through it. I knew Alexander could feel it this time. He turns me gently, pulling my back against his warm, solid chest. His large hands cup the underside of my bump, lifting slightly. The relief is instant and immense, a welcome reprieve from the constant ache.

Then I feel it. A sudden gush, soaking through my underwear and trickling down my leg.

“Alexander.” My voice is a soft murmur. “They’re coming.”

A mix of panic and excitement flashes across his face as he helps me into his office. He was the excited one. I couldn’t be. Isabella had said I had over a month left.

“It’s too early.” My words are choked, tears welling in my eyes.

“Rumor has it Lycan babies develop faster,” Alexander mutters, already calling for Isabella.

She appears with little Charlotte in tow. Alexander immediately scoops the child into his arms. “You are not old enough to see this.”

“Is she having a baby?” Charlotte asks, her eyes wide.

“She’s having two,” he tells her firmly, quickly carrying her out of sight.

I stare in pure wonder at my two sons. They are swaddled tightly in soft blankets, propped carefully on a pillow resting on my lap.

The firstborn is a perfect, miniature Alexander, complete with those striking crimson eyes. The second has my blue eyes. But what truly overwhelms me is the fierce, all-consuming love that crashes over me. My heart feels like it might actually burst. Why hadn’t my own parents felt this? Instead, they felt the need to bind me. Alexander remains seated behind me, his legs framing mine from where he supported me during the birth. He kisses my sweaty cheek, completely unfazed by my state. “You were absolutely brilliant.”

“Are you happy?” I whisper. I knew how desperately he wanted an heir. Now he had two.

He runs a finger with breathtaking softness over each boy’s face, marveling at his sons. “They’re perfect.”

I can feel his grin without even looking. His own happiness is practically radiating from him.

Isabella checks each boy over, giving them a full clean bill of health. “Zachary was right. They do appear to be fully developed pups.” She hands the eldest back to me. He stirs slightly but remains asleep.

“Do you have names?”

My eyes widen as I look at Alexander. Names. I hadn’t even thought about names. Why hadn’t I considered our pups would need names?

He kisses me again, his voice soothing. “We have plenty of time.”

Everyone wanted to meet them. The first few days passed in an exhausting blur as pack members filed in one by one to pay their respects. Alexander assured me this was common practice. There were new heirs. Heirs that had been long awaited. Everyone was eager to see the future of the pack.

I glance over at Alexander as Zachary escorts another member out of the office. He was cradling our eldest, Logan. “Please tell me that’s everyone.” I was beyond exhausted. Twins were not easy.

Alexander kept offering to hire a nanny, but I refused. I wasn’t going to have children only to let someone else raise them.

My gaze drifts down to a wriggling Evrin. He was already trying to position himself for a feed.

Alexander loves watching me feed the twins, telling me he finds it mesmerizing. I knew what it really was. He was desperate to have me after I had refused him for so long.

I smile at him, soaking in a happiness I hadn’t felt in what felt like forever. Correction. I don’t think I had ever felt happiness like this. It was a world away from the life I had left behind.
###Chapter 0210

Six months later

Athena

My eyes dart to the clock as cries pierce the quiet bedroom. I nudge Alexander, but he doesn’t move. He’s completely out, not even stirring when the twins’ wails grow louder.

I drag myself from the warmth of our bed and tiptoe toward their cribs. There’s no point in being quiet—they’re already awake. Only Alexander was still asleep.

The moment I lift them into my arms, their tears stop. I sink into the large armchair by the window, both boys snuggling against me. These cuddles make every sleepless night worth it.

But I still watch.

Every night I’m awake alone with the boys, I find myself scanning the grounds. Waiting.

It’s been nearly nine months since we last saw Gabriel, and six months since we learned there’s another woman who looks just like me.

Zachary and Isabella often return to the city to search for Julian and the lookalike, but they’ve found nothing.

I should feel relieved. Instead, I’m on edge. What are they planning? Will they show up here with an army? Are they coming for my sons?

I will protect us, Nyx whispers softly.

I know, I murmur back.

It took my Lycan a long time to relent. To let me find my own way instead of filling my head with fears. To keep me from that looming darkness.

Now we’re more like we were when she first emerged. She speaks to me. She respects my choices.

I don’t turn when I hear Alexander rise. He always feels guilty when he sleeps through the crying, but I let it slide tonight. He’d been on a pack run.

“Sorry,” he murmurs near my ear, lifting Evrin from my chest with a sleepy yawn. “You’re watching again?”

I nod. “Gut feeling.”

“There’s been nothing for months. Everything is calm.” He means to reassure me, but the feeling never fades. It’s the same around Brianna. She still makes me feel… off.

“I like to watch,” I mutter.

“And I’d like my mate in bed with me all night,” he says with a smile. He knows it wouldn’t happen even if I weren’t watching. The twins rarely sleep more than a few hours.

“How was the run?” I ask, shifting topics.

Every full moon these past months, I’ve wrestled with going or staying with the twins. My need to be with them always wins. Mostly because I’m afraid to shift.

He knows, but he doesn’t push. He thinks shifting would help me regain control.

Maybe I will when I’m sure the darkness won’t pull me under.

He smiles. “No change.”

His way of saying all is normal in the forest. But his words only deepen my unease. I hold Logan tighter, and he sighs contentedly.

Alexander moves to the crib, gently laying a sleeping Evrin down. Then he takes Logan from me and does the same.

“Come back to bed,” he whispers, guiding me from the chair.

“Something isn’t right,” I murmur.

“Your mind is playing tricks again,” he says softly, leading me to bed and sliding in beside me.

His arm wraps around my waist, pulling me close. He leaves a lingering kiss on my lips. “You need sleep.”

“The twins—”

“Are asleep.”

“But what if—”

“We have it covered.” He runs his fingers through my hair, then suddenly freezes. His eyes glaze over.

“Now?” he snaps, annoyed.

What’s happening? Nyx asks.

I don’t know.

Alexander gets up, pulling on shorts. “Stay with the twins. I’ll wake Zachary to guard you.”

“What’s going on?”

“Not sure yet.”

He rushes out. Minutes later, a drowsy Zachary appears. “Any idea why I’m on guard duty?”

“He got a mind link and left.”

“That’s all he said?”

“Yep.” I pop the ‘p’ in frustration. After everything, we agreed sharing information was key. It helps keep my mind from spiraling.

Isabella enters and immediately leans over the cribs, admiring the boys. She adores her nephews and makes sure everyone knows it.

“Aren’t they just precious when they sleep?” she whispers joyfully. I’ve heard that exact phrase every day since they arrived.

“Isabella, let them rest,” Zachary mutters, sensing my tension. He pulls her away from the cribs.

He turns toward the open door, frowning.

“What is it?” Isabella demands.

“Lycan, I think,” he says, still frowning.

I bolt for the door, but he grabs me, pulling me back into the room.

“It’s not Gabriel,” he says, as if reading my thoughts. “But the scent is familiar.”

“If it’s not Gabriel, how did they get through?” Alexander has guards everywhere.

I glance at my sleeping children. The urge to protect them is overwhelming. I would die for them. I would kill for them.
###Chapter 0211

I snatched the diaper bag and hurled it at Zachary.

Darting past him, I flew out of the bedroom and down the staircase.

I froze on the bottom step.

There, in the doorway, stood a mirror image of myself—except for the eyes.

Hers were a deep, unsettling brown.

She smiled, thrusting her hand out as Alexander stepped back. “You must be Athena. I’m Seraphina.”

I kept my mouth shut.

Six months she had taken to show up, but she sounded nothing like what Zachary had described.

He said she was clad in leather.

Heels like a stripper.

I’d even looked that up because I hadn’t understood what he meant.

Yet here she stood before me, wearing trainers and baggy jeans.

An oversized sweatshirt swallowed her frame.

It was almost as if she were trying to mimic my style.

“I don’t know you,” I muttered, refusing to shake her hand.

“Father never mentioned me? How rude.” Her brows furrowed in clear frustration. “I’m your half-sister. We share the same father.”

I couldn’t sense her aura.

But that was the one thing Alexander and Zachary had warned me about—that it might be true.

Still, one of my fondest memories was how deeply in love my parents had been.

“No,” I stated firmly. “I’m an only child.”

Her shoulders slumped. “Mother warned me he might have kept me a secret. I just never really believed it.” She rolled her eyes and moved forward—though she still hadn’t been invited inside.

She opened her mouth to speak.

“How did you get past security? And where is Julian?” I demanded, cutting off whatever lie she was preparing.

She shrugged. “I suppose they thought I was you.” She gestured between us. “And I haven’t seen Julian in months.”

“Liar.”

“I only want to talk. Will you at least hear me out?”

Brianna had used those exact words.

I glanced at Alexander, hoping he’d say no, but I already knew his stance—it was my decision.

“Outside,” I snapped.

“Afraid I’ll hurt those twins of yours?” She smirked.

Rage exploded through me.

How dare she mention my sons.

Every fiber of my being screamed to tear her heart out.

Alexander’s hand slipped into mine.

I knew what he was doing—his warmth spread through me, trying to calm the fury coursing in my veins.

She grinned, but the smile didn’t reach her eyes.

They were the one thing that set us apart; at least mine weren’t completely dead.

I took a deep breath and glared. “Julian told you about them.” He’d learned they were Lycans right before he left. “What else did he say?”

She’s luring you in, Nyx whispered softly.

Seraphina laughed and turned away. “You coming?” she called over her shoulder.

Alexander and I followed her out, keeping our distance.

“Daddy was with my mother first.” She spun around, gazing up at the night sky. “It’s stunning here. It would make a lovely home.”

“He fell in love… but on the day my mother found out she was pregnant with me, he found his mate. You see, he never bothered to claim my mother.”

“No matter how much she begged. No matter how many promises he made to return. He never did.”

“And how is that my fault?” I snapped, itching to get back to my babies.

“I’m just telling you the truth. He led her on. Said he needed to find the right moment. Then he put you in your mother’s womb.”

“That’s when the empty promises started. The only way he could’ve stayed with my mother was by rejecting his mate. But in the end… he chose you.”

I snorted.

“You find that funny?” she scoffed.

“Hilarious,” I growled.

I could feel the darkness spreading through my veins.

“Athena,” Alexander murmured. I knew he felt it too.

“So what—you’re jealous? Is that it? You missed out on having a dad?”

“You have no idea how I watched my mother suffer.”

“Have you ever been bound?” I snapped.

My eyes had to be black by now; Alexander’s grip on my hand tightened.

Seraphina’s eyes narrowed.

“Let’s see. My parents bound me when I was a newborn.” Sarcasm laced my words; shifting always made me sharper. “Then again a few years later.”

“You’ve been bound… twice?” Her spine stiffened. So Julian hadn’t told her everything.

“Yes,” I said, pain prickling at my fingertips. My claws were ready to break through.

“More… but you’re—”

“I think the word you’re searching for is ‘alive’.”

“Athena!” Alexander’s voice was firmer this time.

I followed his gaze down to our joined hands.

Claws were slowly emerging from my fingertips.

For months I’d been afraid to shift again.

But I would do it for them.

I would do anything to protect my boys.

Alexander flashed his crimson eyes at Seraphina. “I suggest you leave. And don’t come back.”
###Chapter 0212
Seraphina

He was a complete bastard.
He never told me she could control her shift.
He never mentioned she’d been bound multiple times.
I watched thick claws push out from her fingertips.
Her eyes shifted from soft blue to solid black.
I’d never seen anything like it.

How was I supposed to handle this without all the facts?
These cheap clothes didn’t help.
The fabric scratched my skin raw.
I was supposed to play innocent.
Mentioning her pups ruined that.
Too eager. I had to reset.

I stepped back and raised my hands.
“I’m sorry.” The word burned like acid.
I never apologize.
“Talking about what he did… it sets me off.” Not a lie.
Our father’s actions enraged me beyond anything.
I wanted to fix his mistakes.

“Leave!” Alexander ordered.
He held my half-sister tightly.
“I’m going… I’m going.” I reached into the awful jeans.
I pulled out a small card.
Tossed it between us.
“If you want answers, meet me here.”

I turned away.
This wasn’t part of the plan.
But seeing her made my resentment boil.
It took everything to keep it buried.
To hide what I felt.

Alexander sent someone to follow me out.
He kept his distance. Didn’t speak.
His long dark hair blew in the wind.
I hate men with long hair.

I didn’t look back after the gates.
That would seem confrontational.
Right now, they needed to be the villains.

A mile down the road, Julian leaned against my Porsche.
He looked powerful in a black suit.
So much more in control than when we first met.

“That was fast.” He straightened up.
“You left out a lot of details.” I stopped in front of him.
He avoided my eyes. Eyes I’d grown to love.
“I need to know everything if we’re doing this.”

“The plan was to get to know her.”
“You should’ve told me everything.”
“Would it have changed anything?”

I pressed my lips tight.
“How is she alive after being bound?” I snapped.
“I don’t know,” he muttered. “We know of four times.”
“Four? No one survives that twice.”
That bitch is stronger than I thought.

“And she controls her shift?”
“She shifted?” He sounded surprised.
“She started to.”

He nodded, sucking in his cheeks.
I grabbed his face, forcing him to look at me.
He may control things in the bedroom.
But when it comes to my life, I call the shots.

“I have Aspen,” he mumbled.
“Wolf Alpha blood.” I released him.
He rubbed his cheeks. “Same for her. She has a Lycan spirit. Nyx.”

“Are you serious? Why didn’t you tell me?”
“I didn’t know it mattered.”
“Everything matters! Do you want this to fail?”

He always said this is what he wanted.
But in my experience, secrets mean doubt.

“No.”
“Then tell me everything. Every detail. Get in the car.”

I drove to the new apartment.
It’s farther from the city but closer to Obsidian Howl.
“You got in okay,” he said as we hit the main road.
“You were right about one thing.” I kept my eyes ahead.
“They thought I was her. But I’m never wearing these again.”
Athena needed to get her act together.

“What did you think?” he asked softly.
“Of Athena? Our father’s genes are strong.” That’s all I shared.
My mind raced through next steps.

“Inside.” I pulled under the porch.
He rolled his eyes before getting out.

I sat alone for a few minutes.
Why did Alexander stop her shift?
He held her, whispering as she stared at me.
###Chapter 0213

I stepped inside to find Julian already holding a glass of wine for me.
I kicked off the uncomfortable flats.
My feet ached from the lack of support.
I’d take heels over those any day.

I sank onto the sofa while he poured himself a whiskey.
“Tell me everything. I don’t care if it takes all night. I need to know it all. She has killed, hasn’t she? That part is true?”
He gave a slow nod. “She goes straight for the heart. She only shifts to kill. At least, that’s how it used to be. She never shifted just to run or for any other reason.”

“So her plan was to kill me.” I smiled faintly.
He frowned. “She doesn’t trust easily.”
“Well, that’s one more thing we have in common.” I took a large sip of wine and started unbuttoning my jeans.
He raised an eyebrow.
“Oh no, honey. You’re not getting any of this until I hear every detail. These are coming off because I can’t stand them another second.”

I settled back on the couch, letting the cool air soothe my irritated skin.
Sure, I would’ve preferred his head between my thighs, but that could wait.
First, I needed to know everything about my dear half-sister.

I spent the next few hours pulling every piece of information from him.
I asked questions he might not even have answers to.
“She had a terrible life too. If Alexander hadn’t found her, she probably would’ve died months ago. She was barely hanging on when he brought her home.”

A normal person would feel pity.
Maybe she deserved it after stealing my life.
But strangely, I didn’t wish her dead.
I just wanted her to see that everything rightfully belonged to me.

“I always thought the Alpha blood came from her father—your father,” he muttered before taking a drink.
I shook my head. “He wasn’t a true Alpha. Mother said he was a Beta by birth. He only took over as Alpha after he marked Athena’s mother. She was the one with pure Alpha blood. Mother didn’t learn the truth until after I was born.”

He tilted his head curiously.
“She believed I had Alpha blood. She tried to remind him that I was his first heir. The true heir. Turns out, I am his heir—but I’m not an Alpha.”

“Do you want to be Alpha?” he asked softly.
I shook my head. That was his dream, not mine. “I want her to lose everything.”

“Daddy dearest didn’t help Mother at all. No money, no clothes for me, no help with food—nothing. He knew about me and let us suffer while he raised his precious Alpha daughter. The last of her kind.”

I knew I had daddy issues.
It’s what happens when you spend years watching your mother desperately pine for a man who doesn’t care about you or his own daughter.
I watched her fade away for a man who was never truly hers—because she was foolish enough to let him get her pregnant.

Then the blame shifted to me.
I was the reason he never claimed her.
I was the reason he never returned.
I was the inconvenience.
I was the bastard child who trapped her.
I was the one who ruined her life.
Not him and his precious fucking daughter.

Tears welled in my eyes, and I was mortified.
“I need a shower!” I snapped, standing abruptly.
“Can I join you?”
“No.”

He watched me leave.
One thing about him—he always respected when I said no.
I rarely refused him, but it was one of his better qualities.

The hot water sprayed against my skin, and the tears finally fell, tracing paths down my cheeks.
Why was I even crying?
Today wasn’t a complete failure.
I had all the information I needed to move forward.
Yet the tears kept coming.

I heard the bathroom door open and turned my face toward the tiles so he wouldn’t see.
“Julian, I said no!”
“I’m staying here,” he murmured. “Could you sense her?”

“No. I don’t think she sensed me either.”
As siblings, looking alike and sharing the same father was where it ended.
Maybe it was better that I couldn’t sense her.

“I want to take down Alexander. I want the pack to be mine. I deserve it. But Athena…” He hesitated, struggling to finish.
“Her history makes you feel sorry for her.”
“And you don’t? Now that you know everything?” he asked.
“No.”
“Not even a little?”
“No.”

She had been beaten, abused, blood-tied, and poisoned.
Bound multiple times, and yet she survived.
It made me despise her even more.
Because no one should have that kind of power.
###Chapter 0214
Athena

“Breathe.” Isabella whispers.

I snap back instantly. “I’m not dead, am I? So obviously I’m breathing!”

I freeze mid-step, realizing how harsh I sounded.

Glancing over my shoulder, I see the hurt flash in her eyes. She was only trying to help.

The darkness had such a fierce grip on my heart it clouded everything—except thoughts of my sons.

“I’m sorry,” I murmur, hoping she feels the sincerity.

“It’s happening, isn’t it? You’re slipping.”

“I… I’m trying not to.”

My gaze drops to my hands. I carefully run my fingers over the tips. The emerging claws felt terrible and wonderful all at once. Like releasing pent-up pressure. Is this how Gabriel felt?

“You need to talk it out. Remember what Brianna said—look at the bigger picture. See beyond the moment. Make it all make sense.”

I roll my eyes. Brianna and her theories. Though I have to admit, they helped a little. Even if I still didn’t trust her.

“Tell me again what the lookalike said.”

“Isabella…”

She raises a brow and crosses her arms. “She told me we share the same father,” I repeat.

“But you don’t believe that?”

“I believed Caleb more. And look how that turned out.”

“Bigger picture,” she mutters.

“No, I don’t believe it. I couldn’t feel her. I couldn’t sense her, only what she is. It’s hard to explain.”

“Try.” She offers a small smile.

“With Sophia, I felt her presence. Same with Zachary and… Brianna. The other turned ones—I felt their fear when they realized they couldn’t defy me. There was even a flicker of recognition from Gabriel. But with her—nothing. She looked at me with those big brown puppy eyes, but you know what it reminded me of?”

Isabella shakes her head.

“The way Dominic used to look at me. It wasn’t hate. It was more. Like I was something he stepped in and scraped off on the grass. That’s exactly what I felt when she looked at me.”

“What did she say about your parents?”

“She claimed our father chose my mother over hers when he found his mate. But it makes no sense. The one thing I remember from my childhood is how deeply they loved each other.”

“Like how Alexander loves you?”

“More,” I whisper. I couldn’t describe it. I just remembered the feeling. Or maybe I saw what I wanted to see as a child.

“So she’s older than you, but you’re the Alpha?”

I nod. “I don’t think she’s much older. Alexander believes the Alpha blood comes from my mother’s side. But they didn’t care enough to tell me before they died. Before I was set up.” I hear the bitterness in my own voice and close my eyes, taking a deep breath.

We were set up. Nyx adds quietly. She wasn’t sure what to make of this Seraphina woman either. I was glad she kept her thoughts to herself.

“Why did you start shifting?” Isabella prods, tying her hair into a bun. She was trying to keep it casual, like we were discussing movies. But I saw it now—she was testing me. Searching for a trigger.

“I didn’t realize at first. Alexander noticed before I did.”

The claws retracted the moment she walked away. Alexander made me let her go. Then he ordered everyone: if I show up at the gates or anywhere along the border, check my eyes. If they’re anything but blue, call him immediately.

“Isabella, what if I’m meant to let this darkness take over?”

Her dark eyes widen as she searches for an answer. Finally, she says, “I don’t believe that.”

“Zachary came back from that place,” she adds with a faint smile. I knew she secretly worried about him slipping back every single day. Even when she didn’t say it, I knew—because Zachary would appear minutes later, wrapping her in his arms without a word.

“But the others didn’t.” I wasn’t looking for an excuse to turn—I wanted to understand if this was my future. I’d rather be prepared.

She puffs out her cheeks. She has no answer. I steer the conversation back to what happened with Seraphina.

“I think it was because she mentioned the twins. That’s what triggered the shift.”

Nyx?

Not me, Nyx murmurs. That was all you.

I shake my head and slump into the large armchair.

“Ah, so you went mama Lycan on her.”

I grimace. “That’s a horrible term.”

“I probably would’ve killed her if Alexander hadn’t stopped me.”
###Chapter 0215

“He stopped you to protect you. I still don’t get why she came.” Isabella frowned deeply. “She showed up alone. Claimed she hadn’t seen my brother in months.”

“Alexander doesn’t believe her?”

She raised an eyebrow. “He doesn’t?”

I shook my head and sighed. I hadn’t meant to tell her that. “He’s sure he could smell him on her.” Once again, I’d been too consumed by the creeping darkness to notice anything except my supposed half-sister.

The whole world could have been collapsing around me and I wouldn’t have noticed.

She paused, letting my words sink in, then continued as if I’d never mentioned him. “Showing up just to tell you your father supposedly had an affair? That’s bullshit. Zachary saw her about six months ago. She was in the city. It wouldn’t have been hard to find us, even with my idiot brother helping her. So why wait until now?”

“Your guess is as good as mine.”

Charlotte was playing peek-a-boo with the boys. Their giggles erupted into hysterical laughter as she popped up from under their high chairs. She had a natural talent with them and loved making them laugh. Zachary said she needed to feel wanted. Something I understood all too well.

She never spoke about what happened to her with anyone except Zachary. If someone walked in while she was talking, she’d stop immediately. I was glad she had someone safe. Sometimes I wondered if I would have ended up like her if I’d been saved after my parents died instead of being forced into hell until I met Alexander.

“Lottie.” Zachary murmured. “Please eat your breakfast.”

“I’m just playing, Daddy.”

“You can play all you want after you’ve eaten.”

She kept making faces at the twins as she settled into a chair at the table.

“How are you?” Zachary asked while putting pancakes on Charlotte’s plate.

I nodded, afraid that if I expressed how I really felt, there would be no turning back.

After breakfast, Isabella took the kids to get cleaned up and dressed for the day.

I sat there, watching Zachary move around the kitchen cleaning up. “How did it feel?”

He paused and slowly turned back to me. “I assume you’re asking what it felt like to turn Rogue.”

My shoulders slumped as I nodded. He put down his plates and sat back at the table across from me. A crease formed between his brows.

“At first it felt right.”

I snorted. That was the last thing I expected him to say.

“I’ll be straight with you, Athena. No point in lying. You talk about the darkness—that’s exactly what happens. It creeps in, clinging to your insides like a cancer without you realizing. You’ll get little flashes of it, and it’s always there, coiling tightly around your insides until no goodness remains.”

He leaned forward to grab the juice and poured himself another glass. I was sure that with this conversation, he’d prefer something much stronger.

“Your decisions will get darker, and you won’t realize it until it’s too late. When it finally happens, you feel free. Everything becomes easier. Life makes more sense.”

“But eventually, you end up trapped. A vicious cycle, destined for one goal. That life that once felt freeing becomes the bane of your existence. You have to fight it, Athena. You have to be the Alpha you’re meant to be, and you can’t do that if you turn Rogue.”

“Do you think my past caused this?”

“Probably, yes. There’s something inside you searching for freedom, and you feel like you haven’t found it yet. Look around you, Athena. Everyone here cares about you. No one wants to harm you. You’re not beaten or starved. You have a mate who adores you. You have everything going for you. Don’t let one scorned woman destroy who you’re meant to be.”

“It doesn’t stop.”

“It never will.” He frowned. “The darkness will always be there. It won’t fade. You need to learn to channel it. But don’t let it become you.”

“You still fight it, even now?”

“I will for the rest of my life.” He smiled, his eyes lighting up. “Isabella helps, but she doesn’t know how much. She’s a beacon of light in the darkness, and when I feel the darkness slipping in, I seek her out. Brianna and I can help you as much as we can, but until you find your own light, it’ll be a battle.”

The question burned, and I should have suppressed it, but it tumbled out of my mouth as if it needed to be heard. “What if I can’t? What if… What if it’s too deeply embedded in me?”

“Do you really believe that?”
###Chapter 0216
Seraphina

“Where did you go?” Julian demands the moment I step into my apartment. “I expected you back hours ago.”

“Since when are you my keeper?” I snap irritably.

My mood was already foul. The slippery bastard I’d been tracking for days had given me the slip. Again.

He rolls his eyes as I shrug off my jacket and hang it by the door. “I’m trying to do you a favor. Getting rid of him means he won’t interfere with our plans. Isn’t that what you want?”

That Rogue had been lurking too close to Obsidian Howl. I didn’t need the complication.

All focus should be on me.

Julian presses his lips together, a frown creasing his brow.

“This is for us. Hunting Lycans and Wolves isn’t some new pastime for me, Julian. I’ve been doing this since I was a teen. This Rogue isn’t the first I’ve encountered. Though he is proving more clever than most.” I pull the knives and gun from my waistband, dropping them onto the coffee table.

His expression softens slightly. I close the distance and press my lips to his. No man has ever gotten this deep under my skin. It’s almost charming.

His dark gaze drops to my weapons. He’s looking for blood, but they’re still clean. “He’s still alive?”

“For now. The bastard knows exactly what he’s doing. Maybe I should just let him be. He’s clearly targeting someone in Obsidian Howl. But he’ll just kill them. He won’t break them first.”

“You should have told me. I would have helped.”

My eyes lock with his. “Some things I need to handle alone, Julian.”

He still struggles with that part of me. Even though he called me ‘Lone wolf’ when we met. He doesn’t fully grasp my need for independence. Athena and Alexander are different; that plan requires both of us.

Every second spent on this Rogue is a second longer until I sink my claws into my dear half-sister.

I press my body against his, letting him feel every curve. He grinds his hips into me, his hands roaming my sides. I can already feel him hardening against me. I thought my drive was high, but his is on another level.

He nuzzles into my neck, drawing a soft moan from me. He sucks and nips at my skin. Then his teeth begin to press deeper.

I shove him back, glaring. “What the hell do you think you’re doing?” I storm to the mirror. Small punctures mark where his teeth were about to claim me. Thankfully, they’re already healing. I stopped him just in time.

“We could link,” he argues.

“That’s your excuse? How dare you! I said I’ll tell you when—and if—I’m ever ready for that.” I stride back to him, eyes narrowed. I snatch a knife from the coffee table.

He backs against the window. I press the blade under his chin, the tip breaking skin. A bead of blood wells up.

He raises his hands. Sometimes he forgets. I’m the one who allowed him into my life. I make the decisions. I let him stay.

“Don’t you ever try that again!” I snarl. “I swear, I will gut you and hang you by your own intestines for the entire world to see.”
###Chapter 0217

His hand closed around mine, shocking me. He pressed the blade deeper into his own skin.

“Then kill me now. I want you as mine in every way possible.”

My breath caught. I struggled to hide my reaction. He had shifted from being useful, to attractive, to now… desirable. There was still a long road ahead. But his willingness to die for me? That scored him major points.

The blood dribble became a steady trickle. It ran over the blade and onto our joined hands. He didn’t flinch. His stunning dark eyes remained locked on mine.

Only when my grip on the knife loosened did he release me. The blade clattered to the floor. I was silently thankful for the dark carpet. A cream one stained with blood would have sent me over the edge. That stuff is a nightmare to remove.

I watched his wound seal shut, leaving a bloody smear on his neck. Damn, he looked incredibly hot.

But no. I wouldn’t yield. Not tonight. Not after that stunt he pulled.

I sipped my coffee, making myself invisible among the passersby on the bustling street. I hadn't planned to return to the city, but it was a prime spot for observation. I needed intel on any disturbances linked to the Rogue. He had undoubtedly killed again. Rogues can't last long without feeding.

So far, nothing. Julian sighed as he took the empty seat beside me. One look from me silenced him, allowing me to focus.

It didn't take long. Faint whispers came from a group of Wolves a few tables over.

“They just vanished,” a teenager muttered, fiddling with her gold nose ring.

“And the Alpha isn’t doing anything?” the blonde girl across from her whispered.

They glanced around but didn't notice me. Perfect.

The girl with the nose ring shifted nervously. “I don’t feel safe there anymore. Two girls, our age… all they found was…” She looked around again. “Their bodies, hearts missing.”

I saw Julian’s face pale instantly.

“Get a grip,” I whispered harshly. “I know it reminds you of her, but falling apart won’t help.” It sounded cold, but it was the truth. I couldn’t afford a liability.

The girl with the nose ring continued. “My dad is speaking to your Alpha today. To see if we can relocate. I have three younger sisters. My parents are terrified for them.”

“That explains why you wanted to meet here,” the second girl said. “It must be pure chaos in Crestwood.”

Crestwood City. The next city over. Julian had mentioned Alexander was holding the Alpha hostage. But they spoke of an Alpha. Perhaps the Beta had taken charge? Honestly, I didn’t care who was in charge.

“Let’s go,” I muttered, standing up.

“Crestwood City?” Julian asked as we reached the car.

I nodded. “Seems your Rogue problem has found a new hunting ground.”

Crestwood City barely qualified as a city. More like an overgrown town. Unlike packs hidden in forests, they lived openly among humans. Not a bad strategy. Each way of life has its pros and cons. But a city layout made it easy for a Rogue to pick off victims.

They weren’t isolated from the human world either. Anyone could wander through. Someone could walk right up to the packhouse front door without a single guard stopping them.

And that’s exactly what we did.

I knocked briskly and firmly. Julian hovered nearby. He’d already told me the new Alpha would recognize him. That wasn’t an issue. The Alpha didn’t need to know about Julian’s history with Obsidian Howl. He just needed to know I was here to solve his Rogue problem.
###Chapter 0218

The heavy door swung open.

A young woman, likely my age, greeted us with a warm smile.

“How can I help you?”

“I’m here to see the Alpha,” I said, keeping my tone light.

“He’s currently in a meeting.” She glanced at her simple wristwatch. “It should be wrapping up soon, if you don’t mind waiting.”

“Of course.” I returned her smile, though mine was as fake as the designer blouse she wore. She didn’t notice.

We waited less than ten minutes before someone exited the office.

A few more minutes passed.

Then a large man stepped out.

He wore a navy blue suit, tailored to perfection.

Loose blonde curls sat atop his head.

His green eyes shone like bright emeralds.

“Hello, I’m Alpha Ryan,” he said, friendly and welcoming. Unlike many other Alphas I’d met. It felt unusual. Almost off-putting.

“I believe you know Julian.” I gestured to the man beside me.

The Alpha smiled, looking him up and down. “You’ve certainly landed on your feet. How’s your brother?”

“Good. He’s a father now.”

I was impressed by Julian’s ability to mask his hatred. Normally, he couldn’t hide a single drop.

“Really?” Ryan turned to the woman who had let us in. “Please send my congratulations to Alexander and his mate.”

She quickly scribbled something down.

“I know Ethan and Alexander had their issues, but I don’t plan on following in his footsteps.” He turned back to me. “Sorry, I didn’t catch your name.”

“Seraphina.”

“Please, come in.”

He waited for us to sit before asking how he could help.

No point dragging it out. “I hear you have a little problem.”

His eyes flashed to me. His friendly demeanor vanished. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” His gaze shifted to Julian. “If this is some shitty plot to force me into a new contract, you need to leave. I just said I want no problems with Alexander.”

“Nothing to do with contracts.” I paused. “We are aware that a couple of girls have gone missing. Only to turn up dead.”

His face hardened. “How do you know that?”

“I have my resources.” I had no intention of getting two young girls into trouble.

“You’re not the first pack to have trouble,” Julian added. “It killed my mate. Then tried to kill my sister.” His composure held firm, making my heart flutter. I was proud of how far he’d come, even with a long way still to go.

“It’s a beast,” Alpha Ryan muttered.

I nodded and gave him a crash course on Rogues. I knew it was a lot to take in. Learning that more than just Wolves could shift.

“You think you can deal with it?” he asked.

“I’ve killed several others like him.”

“And what do you want in return?”

“Nothing. Well, nothing other than food, hot water, and somewhere to rest.”

If he had come to me, I would’ve asked for much more. But since I went to him, it wasn’t fair to charge.
###Chapter 0219
Seraphina

He appeared within twenty-four hours of our arrival.

The bastard was in human form.

I had never seen his human face before.

Julian couldn't help me identify him either. He had only ever seen the beast.

Rogues who shift at will are extremely rare. Most who turn Rogue can never return to normal Lycan life. But it's not entirely impossible.

Julian mentioned that guy from Obsidian Howl managed it. But this one was different.

He pushed all boundaries. He embraced his nature completely, granting him unusual freedom.

What I've learned about Rogues is their constant struggle between desire and control. That internal war is what destroys them. That's what prevents their return.

Heart versus mind. But this one had solved that puzzle. A smirk spread across my face without my permission.

"Do you see him?" Julian asked, noticing my expression.

“No.”

I felt his presence strongly, but couldn't pinpoint his location. He moved through the crowds seamlessly, blending with humans going about their daily routines.

He would know I was here too. He wasn't stupid. If I could smell him, he could definitely smell me.

Rogues develop enhanced senses. Their smell, hearing, everything amplifies to extraordinary levels. That's why they're harder to kill unless you catch them sleeping.

Where's the fun in that?

"Keep watching.” I murmured.

One man stood out. Tattoos covered his neck, identical to the guy who saw Julian speaking with me. Many people have tattoos, but identical patterns in identical spots? That suggested family markings.

If this was him, he looked nothing like his brother. Leaner build. Chestnut brown hair and eyes compared to Zachary's darkness.

Maybe they shared only one parent, like me and my dear half-sister.

He scanned the area. Probably searching for me. But I wasn't stupid. I had spread my scent throughout this entire town. It would be stronger here because of my current position. He had already figured that out.

He looked away when he didn't spot me. His attention shifted to a woman younger than me standing outside the library.

He approached her, commenting on the books she carried. Too much traffic and noise to hear his words. But I watched her giggle. A flush of red colored her pale cheeks.

I knew why he targeted her. She looked easy to manipulate. Perhaps naive.

He leaned closer, showing interest through subtle touches on her arm, tucking her curly hair behind her ear. She appeared flattered, probably unused to such attention.

It might have seemed sweet if I didn't know his true intentions.

She giggled again as his hand caught hers. I watched her nod and follow him. She glanced around as if expecting a trick.

She didn't realize that's exactly what this was.

“Time to end his little game.” I snarled.

I stepped from the shadows into full view, but he remained focused on charming her with lies. Her giggles grew louder, eyes wide as she hung on his every word.

Silly girl. Had Alpha Ryan taught them nothing?

"Now? In broad daylight?” Julian muttered in my ear.

"We must. Before he takes another victim. I want him gone permanently."

"Ironic how you and Athena share the same problem."

I ignored his comment and turned the corner, following the Rogue and the girl. They had disappeared from sight. “Fuck.” I growled, scanning the entire street.

Then I saw a foot protruding from a narrow alley between buildings. It twitched. I knew I was too late. She hadn't even made a sound.

By the time Julian and I reached the spot, the Rogue had vanished. He left the girl's heart behind.

Her eyes remained wide open, but life had departed. Her rosy cheeks paled rapidly from blood loss. Blood trailed down the alley, over the small fence at the end.

"Stay here. Call the Alpha. Tell him I'm hunting."

"Alone?"

"Always alone." I had my knives and gun. That's all I needed. No one else to watch over.

A small field lay behind the fence, leading to scattered trees and then woods. The blood trail continued, thinning as the beast healed. Occasional crimson droplets marked the path until they disappeared completely.
###Chapter 0220

His scent hung thick in the air. He was close. Julian had mentioned the Rogue favored trees.

My gaze lifted but found nothing.

“Why hide?” My voice cut through the silent woods. “Is the beast scared?”

I kept my hands empty. A knife would only make him hesitate. Timing was everything.

“I know what you are. You know what I am.” I called out again. “Stop wasting my time.”

I felt him above me but didn’t look. He wanted the element of surprise. I would play his game.

I stepped forward, eyes ahead. He was studying me, they always did. I’d climbed the fence and crossed the field in my Louboutins. A price paid for beauty and death.

The rustling above was deliberate. He’d hidden well. He wanted me to look up just as he jumped. Instead I moved deeper into the woods. A grunt of annoyance followed.

He lured others to their deaths. Two could play.

“Talk.” I snapped. “I know you can.”

“Why follow me?” He growled from the tree. I inspected my nails.

“You’re causing problems I don’t need.”

“You’re the problem.” He growled.

I rolled my eyes. “Coming down so I can kill you?”

He laughed, a choked gurgle. “You look like her but don’t smell like her.” He dropped before me. His beast towered, bloody drool on sharp teeth. “You smell weak. Delicious.”

He dragged a tongue over his teeth.

“That supposed to scare me?” I raised a brow. “I’ve handled worse than fools who play with food. I’m not weak.”

He growled, stretching taller. I stood unfazed. Size wasn’t always advantage. Being smaller meant I was quicker. I could escape tight spots. Move in unexpected ways.

His claws reached for my shoulders. I stepped back, just out of reach. Simple but effective.

“Why target those girls?”

No answer. At full height, he circled me, trying to intimidate. Predictable. I wondered how Alexander and the others struggled to kill him.

He halted before me. “You want them. Want her for yourself?”

“I can help. Get in unseen. Lycan and Lycan taking over the pathetic Wolves.”

I held up a hand, pointing at myself. “Lycan.” I turned my hand to point at him. “Rogue. Don’t confuse us.”

That deep gurgle rippled the air. “Better if I shift?”

He changed to the chestnut-haired man who’d lured the girl away. Unashamed of his naked body. A massive chunk missing from his leg. He shouldn’t be walking.

“Oh.” In one move, I pulled a knife and stabbed his stomach. Surprise filled his eyes. A cry of anger as I ripped the blade upward to his ribs.

They took too long with games. Drawing it out. With Rogues, be quick. No time for plotting. Always be unsuspecting.

His hands grabbed the knife handle. He pulled it out, spraying deep red over me.

He started healing before my eyes. I hadn’t gone deep enough.

I pulled another knife, sank it into his bad leg as he tried to knock me down. He went to pull it out. I fired the gun. The bullet vanished into his forehead, blowing out the back of his head.

“One down.”

###Chapter 0222
Zachary

My fists slammed into the punching bag repeatedly.

Isabella refuses to let me touch her during her period.
She calls it disgusting.
She says if I try, she’ll cut my dick off without hesitation.

I’d rather keep my cock.
So I take my frustration out on the training equipment.

I stop when stuffing bursts from the torn seams.
I unhook the bag and carry it toward the pile of others I’ve destroyed.
The woman who repairs them is going to curse my name.

As I lift another bag onto my shoulder, a sharp pain shoots through my chest.
It doubles me over.
I gasp for air.

“Isabella!”

I drop the bag and sprint across the training grounds.
I ignore the concerned looks from other pack members.

“ISABELLA?” I shout, bursting through the back door into the packhouse.

She stares at me, wide-eyed.
A spoonful of ice cream is halfway to her lips.
The stabbing pain continues to pierce my heart, but my mate is right there.
She looks perfectly fine. And confused.

Her brows furrow.
“Are you okay?”

“Are you?” I snap back, fighting to control the anger surging inside me.
My heart hammers against my ribs.

She nods slowly, still watching me.

The pain vibrates deeply in my chest but doesn’t spread.

It couldn’t be.

“Zachary?” Her voice is laced with worry.
But if she was unharmed, only one possibility remained.

I rub my sternum.
“I think… I think Gabriel is dead.”

Her spoon clatters onto the table.
“He’s… dead? But you’re still here?”

“I felt pain. I thought it was you. But you’re fine. It has to be him.”
I wanted to pull her into my arms and never let go.

She blinks several times, as if not processing.
“Who… who would have killed him?”

“Could’ve been anyone. That bar where I found Lottie wasn’t his only hunting spot.” I press my palm against my chest again. The sensation was unexpected. I didn’t think any connection to my brother remained. “The fool must’ve gotten himself into more trouble.”

“Are you okay?” she asks softly. “I know you wanted to be the one to end him. For what he did.”

It was true.
I wanted to be the last thing he ever saw.
I wanted to watch the life leave his eyes.
I nod. He was dead. One less threat to worry about. “What about you?”

She may not say it aloud, but I feel her questions.
She wonders how he became so hateful.
She keeps those thoughts to herself.
Sometimes she forgets I can hear them.
After last time, I won’t force them out of her.

“He deserved it,” she whispers, biting her bottom lip.

“It’s fine,” I assure her. “I just want you to tell me the truth when you’re ready.”

I choose my words carefully.
I watch her subtle reactions.
I make sure not to push too hard.
She isn’t afraid to shut me out if I do.

“I cared for him once. You know that.” She releases a heavy sigh. “He seemed like a good man at first. He filled my head with lies. Told me what I wanted to hear. Made promises he never intended to keep. He did horrible, horrible things.” She glances down at her leg. It’s nearly healed, but she still refuses to join pack runs or shift. Just in case.
###Chapter 0223

"What if we had completed the blood bond?" Her voice was quiet, hesitant. "What would have become of me then?"

She'd been holding onto that question for days. I could see it weighing on her.

"He would have shattered you." I kept my tone even, controlled. I deliberately stripped any emotion from my words. He likely would have ended her life too, but that detail wasn't necessary. Not now.

Her frown deepened. Her gaze drifted toward the closed kitchen door, toward the hallway beyond. "I hope whoever ended him... made it quick."

She still held onto an idealized version of him. A ghost from her past. The urge to shatter that illusion was strong. I wanted to tell her everything. About the monster he truly was, long before he ever convinced Victoria to change him. About the darkness he willingly embraced.

But I swallowed the truth. Let her keep the few faint, good memories. The fault was mine for allowing him to exist as long as I did.

A small, sad smile touched her lips. Jealousy should have flared, but it didn't. I couldn't begrudge her the love she once felt, even if it was built on a foundation of deceit.

"You should..." She picked up her spoon, digging it back into the soupy remains of her ice cream. "You should tell the others. Alexander and Athena will be thrilled."

I moved around the table to embrace her. She immediately pointed the spoon at me like a weapon. "Don't you dare touch me. I'll stab you. I swear it."

"I just want to hold you."

"I hate being touched during my cycle. You know this! It happens every single month without fail!"

"If you let me put a pup in you, it would stop."

I left her sputtering in the kitchen.

My knuckles rapped sharply on the office door.

"Enter." Alexander's voice was a low command.

Inside, Sebastian was slumped in a chair. His eyes were glazed, struggling to focus. A powerful scent of whiskey clung to him.

Sebastian still hadn't resumed his Beta duties. Theodore had effectively taken over, though no official announcement had been made. It was for the best. A pack couldn't function with a drunkard as its second.

"Sebastian, leave." Alexander's order was flat.

"Sure thing, Alpha." He stood, swayed dangerously, and collapsed back into the seat.

"Drunk. Again." I kept my tone neutral, but disgust churned in my gut. He was a disgrace to his rank. Alexander needed to formally strip him of it. Their old friendship shouldn't matter. The title belonged to someone who deserved it. Like Theodore.

"What's it to you?" Sebastian snarled, his words slurring.

He was a functioning alcoholic. That was the human term for it. He could hold a conversation, but his motor skills were failing. He fit the definition perfectly.

"Sebastian. Go home. Sleep it off." Alexander's growl rumbled through the room.

Sebastian stumbled out. Alexander immediately called for an Omega to follow him, ensuring he made it home safely.

"You need to get a handle on that situation," I stated.

"I discovered someone is supplying him. I've issued a warning. Anyone caught bringing him alcohol will be torn apart by the pack."

My eyebrow rose in surprise. He had let this slide for months. Something had shifted. I didn't ask for details. It wasn't my place to question my Alpha.
###Chapter 0224

“I assume you wished to speak with me.” His tone was icy.

“I believe Gabriel is dead.”

He froze. His crimson eyes lifted from the documents to meet mine. That shade still unsettled me, though it no longer shocked me each time I saw him. Isabella had mentioned that Alexander always attributed it to his Alpha status. I’d encountered enough Alphas to know crimson eyes were rare. In fact, I’d never seen another Wolf with them.

“I was in the training hall. A terrible pain spiraled through my heart. As if my life was being drained away.”

He leaned back in his chair, giving me a knowing look. “That’s the pain of losing a sibling. It’s what Isabella and I felt when Julian severed our bond. But you’re here, so you didn’t kill him?”

“No. Like I said, I was training.”

“I hope he suffered for what he did to Sebastian’s children and Isabella.”

“You mean Julian’s children?”

“Sebastian raised them. You should have told him. Perhaps it would have helped… though I doubt it now. I think he’s beyond reason.”

“Words won’t help him, Alexander. We both know that. Be grateful he isn’t a Lycan.”

He didn’t need to ask for clarification. He understood perfectly.

“Are you making Theodore your Beta?” I pressed.

His lips pressed into a thin line, jaw tightening. “I should. But no.”

“You can’t wait for that drunk to get his act together!”

“Athena wants you to be my Beta.”

“What? I can’t do that. I’m not a Wolf.”

“That’s what I told her. But she pointed out that Obsidian Howl is hardly just a Wolf pack anymore. She is a Lycan. A female Alpha who now serves as my Luna. My sons, heirs to the Wolf pack, are also Lycans. Plus, we have two additional Lycans living among us.” He snorted. “She’s right. Things are changing.”

“I’m her guard.”

“Exactly what a Beta is meant to do. I know we don’t always see eye to eye, Zachary. Perhaps that’s a good thing.”

I raised a brow at him.

“Just consider it.”

He asked if I had spoken to Isabella.

“At first, I thought the pain was connected to her. I feared something had happened. But she’s in the kitchen, eating ice cream.”

“Ah, no need to say more.” He nodded knowingly. Isabella had told me Alexander essentially raised her and her twin brother through their teenage years. He took them in as his own when he became Alpha. No doubt she gave him a hard time during puberty. Both probably did. I was glad I missed that.

Becoming Alpha young had mostly worked in Alexander’s favor. He definitely knew how to pressure people into helping him. I wondered if he had managed to get someone on the outside to kill my brother. I didn’t care if he had. I just wanted to know who so I could thank them.

“Who do you think killed him?” Gabriel had evaded capture for years. He always stayed one step ahead of us. Now, suddenly, he was dead. I didn’t buy it. It sounded like someone else was hunting him.

He shrugged. “Does it matter if he’s dead?”

“It shouldn’t. But I prefer to know who.”
###Chapter 0225
Alexander

He's completely serious.
I see it in his gaze, those impossibly dark eyes fixed on me.
If he were a Wolf, I would have put him in his place already.

"They weren't interested in Gabriel. Not even remotely."
I roll my eyes.
Honestly, I was just relieved Gabriel was dead.
I didn't care who did it, as long as I never had to deal with his twisted ways again.

"Remember, Gabriel killed Sophia. I've watched Julian. I know how his mind operates. He manipulates others into doing his dirty work." Zachary mutters.

"No, he doesn't—"

Zachary raises an eyebrow. "You really don't see it, Alexander? He was head of war tactics. Those types don't get their hands dirty. They control from the shadows. They assess the situation, determine the best outcome, and make everyone else fight their battles so they maintain control."

'Why is he always right?' Titan grumbles.

Zachary leans back in his chair, wrinkling his nose at Sebastian's lingering scent. "He'd actually fit in well with the Rogues. Maybe that's why he sought out that Lycan who looks like Athena. He wanted a pawn to do his bidding."

"Zachary!" I growl a warning. He's pushing too far.

"Weren't you the one who told me Julian always coveted what you had? Your position, your power, your mate?"

"You're on very thin ice!"

"You just said it might be good that I don't always agree with you. I didn't come here to be your yes-man. I came to protect Athena. If that means pointing out things you're blind to or just refusing to see, then I'll speak the truth."

"I know you care for your brother, Alexander. Somewhere deep down. Because I cared for mine too, right up until he crossed the line. But you're letting that cloud your judgment, even now. I will protect Athena. If that means eliminating this woman who resembles her…"

"Seraphina." I seethe.

"And your brother. Then I will." He continues.

His seriousness was undeniable.

"Your theories are all hypothetical. We don't know for sure if she killed Gabriel."

"What are the odds it wasn't her or them?" Zachary challenges. "Like I said, Julian rarely does anything himself."

'He has a point.' Titan mumbles. 'Julian wants your spot. He finds someone who just happens to be Athena's half-sister and now….' He trails off.

'What?' I snap.

'He wants the pack.'

I was about to respond to my Wolf when the phone in the corner of my office rang.

My eyes snapped to it.
The last time it rang was when I received the request from Silver Creek.
This phone was for other packs to contact me in desperate need of help.
But since nearly all my contracts were severed after the battle, it had fallen silent.

Contacting me always came with a steep price.

I held a hand up to Zachary, signaling him to stay.

I picked up the phone without a word.

"Alexander, this is Ryan, the Alpha of Crestwood City." He blurted out before I could even greet him.
I almost laughed at his awkward self-introduction. He still hadn't mastered projecting Alpha dominance.

"I hope you don't think I want a contract. I never contacted you. They came to me." He rushed out, stumbling over his words. "I told them the same thing. And though I'm grateful for their actions, I was hoping for another way to repay you."

They?
So Seraphina had lied when she claimed she hadn't seen my brother for months.
###Chapter 0226

I had no idea Crestwood City was dealing with any issues. My words needed to be chosen with precision. “My brother discovered a solution for you?”

“Yes! And like I mentioned, I’m grateful they eliminated the Rogue. It means the young girls in our pack are safe. The parents have finally stopped panicking.” His voice trembled slightly. It sounded like he was searching for an excuse to stay uninvolved. To avoid falling under my command. He didn’t want to end up like Ethan, and I understood that.

“Did my brother deliver the final blow?” I asked, careful not to reveal my ignorance about Julian’s activities.

“Uh, no. I believe it was his female companion, Seraphina.”

“I’m not requesting anything from you.” I cut the conversation short. “No contract this time.” I muttered it low so he wouldn’t question further. “I’m glad they could assist you.”

He fell silent, but I could hear his breath through the phone. “Are there more?” he finally asked after what felt like forever.

“The last time we spoke, I informed you about the Lycans. I even mentioned my mate was one. We believed their numbers were very limited. But now,” I paused. He deserved clarity. “There’s a possibility. What I didn’t tell you is that my mate is the Lycan Alpha.”

I noticed Zachary raise an eyebrow at me, a smirk forming on his lips.

Ryan went quiet again. I could only imagine the questions swirling in his mind. “Can she control them?”

I wasn’t sure how to answer. She had exerted control over those who attacked us, but Gabriel had resisted. I wondered if others could do the same. I didn’t even know if she had any influence over Zachary or Brianna.

“Time will tell,” I murmured into the receiver.

“What about Rogues? Are there more? Julian and Seraphina left without another word. I didn’t get to ask anything else. Should I bury the Rogue?”

I glanced at Zachary, knowing he could hear both sides. He silently mouthed the word ‘burn’.

“Burn the Rogue. As for whether there are more, the truth is I don’t know.”

“So what should I do?”

“Train your guards to be stronger.”

“Right.” I heard the doubt in his tone. The same hesitation I’d heard from so many others. It wouldn’t be long before he asked for my help. It had been years since I’d forced anyone into a new contract. But if it benefited me, I would never refuse.

“Thank you for calling, Ryan. I hope you’re settling into your Alpha duties. If you need assistance, don’t hesitate to reach out.” I ended the call before he could respond.

“So I was right,” Zachary muttered.

“It seems so.”

“She does,” he said quietly.

“What?”

“His question about Athena. She does have a hold over us. She’s never used it, but just like your Wolves feel your power over the pack, she has that same influence over us.”

I had sensed it. I felt that lingering power the first time I saw her. When I watched her slender, fragile form slide down that door until she collapsed on the floor. The energy radiating from her was one of the things that drew me in. Well, that and the fact she was my mate.

“If the power is there, how did Gabriel resist it?”

He scowled. “What was her demeanor when she forced the others to obey?”

“Confident. She had been hiding upstairs with Sophia. They came out when Victoria forced Sophia to bring Athena to her. But it was all a setup.” I smiled. “I could feel her power, but… it’s not always present now. It’s strongest when she’s near our sons.”
###Chapter 0227

He flashes me a wide, idiotic grin. “She’s found her beacon.”

‘Beacon?’ Titan questions sharply inside my head.

“What does that mean?” I demand out loud.

Zachary shakes his head slowly. “She is constantly battling a deep darkness that surrounds her. It’s a weight that crushes you slowly. It invades every part of you when your guard is down.”

“Athena fights it, but that struggle leaves no room for her to embrace her full strength as an Alpha. We can shield her. We can offer her tools to maintain control. But we cannot fight this battle for her. That is her journey alone. She can only truly conquer it when she discovers what gives her hope. And it seems she has. She just hasn’t realized it yet.”

‘We weren’t her hope?’ Titan’s voice is heavy with defeat. ‘We are her mate.’

‘I don’t believe that’s his point,’ I reply silently.

“There must be something more I can do for her. What is it?” I ask the Lycan watching me.

His dark eyes hold mine as he gives a slow, negative shake of his head.

With Athena, I often felt completely powerless. It was a terrible feeling. Watching my mate suffer and being unable to fix it. She was having more good days than bad recently. But the darkness was always there. Lurking. Seeping into her thoughts when she least expected it.

Sometimes I would find her just staring into nothing. Her mind trapped in a cycle of heavy, dark thoughts.

“So you’re saying the twins will save her?” I press him for clarity.

“They will save her. They will give her strength. They will make her truly understand her own power. Isabella is my light, just as those pups are hers.” He rises to his feet. “This could be her turning point, Alexander. This could be what finally secures her power. She just needs to hold tightly to that light.”

I had questions about Isabella being his light. From what I knew, he had escaped the rogue life long before meeting her. But those questions weren't important right now.

He reaches the door and glances back over his shoulder. “I will be your Beta, Alexander. But my main priority will always be protecting Athena. And you can be the one to tell her the news. Also, I won’t be calling you Alpha.” He smirks before walking out.

I take a moment to tidy the office. It gives me time to think. To decide what to say. I finally choose the truth. Lying could lead to a much worse outcome. I want to grow old with her. Surrounded by our children and our grandchildren.

I find her in our bedroom. She’s sitting in the large armchair by the window. A twin is cuddled into each of her sides. She is reading them a story. I recognize the book. It was one of the first ones Theodore had given her to help her learn to read.

A children's book about animals. She had thrown it across the room countless times in frustration during those early lessons.

Her eyes flick up to meet mine. But she continues reading smoothly. As if she had never struggled with a single word.

Both boys are asleep by the time she finishes. She closes the book and smiles at me, hugging them tighter. But her smile slowly fades. “What’s wrong?”

“Gabriel is dead.”

“That’s good news, isn’t it?”

“Seraphina killed him.”
###Chapter 0228
Seraphina

Alpha Ryan will contact Alpha Alexander to inform him the Rogue is dead. He might have already made the call before we even departed Crestwood City.

It would completely expose my and Julian’s cover. I specifically told him and Athena that I hadn’t seen Julian for months. But it will be worth the risk. His death should throw them into confusion.

Perhaps I could spin this. Make Athena and her mate believe I did it for them. Convince them it was a gesture to earn their trust. They would be absolute fools to fall for it. Yet sometimes, the simplest plans work best. I just need to get close enough to completely shatter her world.

“I still can’t believe you just shot him.” Julian is muttering, more to himself than to me. His dark eyes fix on me. “He can’t heal from that? Come back?”

“No one comes back when their brains are blown out the back of their skull.” I smile. The thought always brings me immense satisfaction.

He sets my dinner down in front of me and slides into the chair opposite. “Do you always use a gun? It’s just… firearms are rarely used within packs.”

“I don’t belong to a pack. The gun is a last resort.” I add. “I prefer to slice them apart. Tear them to pieces. But Rogues anticipate that.”

He falls silent, shoving roast chicken into his mouth. We truly came from different worlds. Yet he had reached a point where I simply couldn’t let him go. What the hell was wrong with me?

“Can I ask you something?” He mutters through a mouthful.

“You don’t usually hold back.”

“Why didn’t you shift? Do you ever shift? I’ve never seen your Lycan form. You’ve seen my Wolf. You know about Aspen. But I still know very little about you. Other than your impressive skill with my cock.”

“That’s more than one question.” I smirk. “But I’ll play along. There was no need for me to shift. There rarely is. I maintain better control in human form.”

“You lose control?”

“Eat your dinner.”

He pauses over his potatoes, eyeing me carefully. He chooses not to press further. He doesn’t bring it up again for the rest of the evening.

In bed, he lies with his hand resting just above my pussy. Deep snores vibrate against my neck where his face is buried.

I had never allowed anyone this close. The mere idea of having a lifelong partner always seemed like a distant dream. Or perhaps a nightmare. His questions at dinner made me realize he was getting too close. Uncovering things I never discussed. A past long buried. A past I wanted to remain buried.

Would he even understand, given what happened to his first mate? Maybe it was time to let him go.

His lips graze my neck. His hand moves further south, cupping my pussy. “Why are you still awake?” He whispers into the darkness, his breath warm on my skin. “Did I not fuck you thoroughly enough earlier?”

He slides the tip of his finger across my folds. My wetness answers for me. I part my legs slightly to give him better access. But he continues at an agonizingly slow, steady pace, stroking back and forth.

I push my hips up toward his hand. The rhythm doesn’t change.

“I want more, Seraphina.” He mutters against my neck, leaving tantalizing kisses.

“More?” I whisper back, thrown by his demand.

“I want you to be mine.” His teeth scrape my skin. I freeze. Claiming me means more than just partnership. It means a lifelong bond. Him knowing my every thought. Including my past. A past far deeper than my father abandoning my mother and me.

I slide out from under his hand. As much as I craved a good fuck, I couldn’t let him mark me.
###Chapter 0229

“Is that so?” Julian’s eyebrow arched sharply. He brought his fingers to his lips, tasting the lingering evidence of my arousal.

“You’ve made your intentions perfectly clear. You want me as your mate.” I muttered, yanking on a pair of training leggings. “I’m not prepared.”

Damn. Poor word choice.

“Every day you delay my claim, we gamble with fate. We risk encountering our true destined mates. Then it’s over. When will you be ready, Seraphina? Six months? A year? Five? You know we are good together.”

“Back off!” I snarled, my teeth clenched. “And I’ve searched the entire world! My true mate doesn’t exist!”

“Are you frightened? Is that it?”

I froze mid-motion, pulling my workout top over my head. “Frightened? You think I’m scared?”

“Something is holding you back!” His voice snapped like a whip. “Every time I believe this is real. That I’ve finally found someone I can be with. You throw it all back in my face.”

“Alright, let’s say you mark me. What happens when I die? My work doesn’t guarantee my survival, Julian. You could mark me tonight, and I could be dead tomorrow. Do you truly want to lose another mate?”

I knew I was deflecting. But he wasn’t ready for the raw truth. I snatched my yoga mat and strode purposefully toward the door.

“Where are you going?” he demanded.

“To fucking work out. Is that acceptable to you?!” My anger was a live wire. Why did he always push? Why did I constantly let him cross every line?

Any other man would be in a grave if he tried half the things Julian did.

I unfurled the mat with a sharp flick. He appeared instantly. Leaning naked against the doorframe, his muscular arms crossed over his broad chest.

“I make you feel something you’ve never felt before. Don’t I?”

I jabbed my headphones toward him and yanked them over my head, cutting him off. But he didn’t leave.

Ten minutes into my yoga flow, I ripped the headphones off. “You think you know everything, Julian.”

“I never said I did.” He frowned deeply. “I don’t understand your resistance. We want the same things. We are good together. I know the mere thought of me with someone else puts you in a dark mood. That’s why you walk away.”

“No, it’s not.”

“Then what aren’t you telling me? I can handle it. I’m sure I can. Is it related to Athena and your father?”

“No.”

His brow furrowed as he searched for another logical explanation. The tragic part was, he’d missed every clue. Clues I hadn’t deliberately shared, but ones that had slipped out during other conversations.

He stepped closer, taking my hands in his. “I can handle it. Whatever it is. We can solve it together, if it means you are finally mine and I am yours.”

I stepped back, my stomach twisting into familiar, painful knots—a feeling I hadn’t known since childhood. He was the only one who could evoke this in me. The only person who saw past my hardened shell.

“You should probably put some clothes on,” I sighed. Someone would find out eventually. It might as well be him.

“I’m fine.” He moved to sit his bare ass on my sofa.

“You’ll probably want to leave after this. So you might as well be prepared.”

He started to speak, then stopped himself. He retreated to the bedroom. He returned wearing a white tee and grey sweatpants. He settled onto the sofa with an eager smile, like a child waiting for Santa.

“Julian, haven’t you ever wondered how I know it’s so easy to kill Rogues?”

“I assumed it was from years of intense training and practice.”

I tried a different approach. “You asked me why I never shift.”

“You mentioned control.”

Could he truly be this blind to what I was implying?

“Julian, I was a Rogue.”
###Chapter 0230
Seraphina

I anticipated his dark eyes would widen at my revelation.
He simply stared at me as if I'd asked about the weather.
"Aren't you going to say anything?" I demanded sharply.

"What would you like me to say?"
"This isn't some situation where you wait for my commands! I just explained everything! Why I refuse to shift! Why I mentioned losing control! Why killing Rogues comes so easily to me! And now you're just staring!"

He continued watching me without reaction.

"There were clues for months! You were too blind to see them!" I snapped, sudden fury boiling through my veins. This was exactly why I never let anyone close. I never wanted them to discover the truth, but Julian had been here for months without figuring it out.

"Blind?" He raised an eyebrow at me.

"Forget it. Just pack your things and leave." I concealed every emotion raging inside me. I knew this would happen eventually. I had prepared for this moment since he wormed his way into my heart.

He stood up but didn't move further. He shoved his hands into his pockets. I expected his heart to be pounding violently. A Rogue had killed his mate. That's what brought him to me.

"I knew the moment you detected Zachary. I've been waiting for you to tell me yourself."

"What? That was months ago!"

"Zachary once mentioned being Rogue heightens your senses. It lets you detect other Lycans, distinguishing them from regular Wolves. You sniffed him out when he followed me. You knew he was there when I didn't. I realized then that you'd been a Rogue at some point."

It takes much to surprise me, but he left my jaw hanging open.

"If I hadn't known about Lycans and lacked information about Rogues, I wouldn't have connected the dots. But you're right about one thing. Little hints slipped through. That probably wouldn't have happened if I hadn't fallen for you and stayed. I've been waiting for you to tell me, Seraphina. For you to feel safe enough with me to finally confess it."

My own heart rampaged as I clutched the rolled yoga mat to my chest. He had known all along. He hadn't said a word. He let me keep my secret. He let me decide when to share.

"You...you still want to claim me?" I felt certain that if the window were open, a passing breeze would knock me over. No one had ever wanted anything from me except killing. They showed no interest in my life whatsoever.

"I'm still here, aren't I?"
"Why?" I sputtered, still in complete shock.
"You're the first person I've ever loved."
"But we're not mated."
"So? Why should that stop us? If I claim you, you're mine and I'm yours. I don't care about your past as a Rogue."

I turned away because he clearly didn't understand the severity of what being a Rogue meant.

"That's why I don't shift, Julian. I told you I lose control. You thought that bastard was bad? When I was Rogue, I was a hundred times worse. That's why I made it my mission to hunt them down and eliminate them. Not shifting helps me maintain control."

"Okay."
"A Rogue killed your mate." I didn't even know why I was pushing him away. He was probably the best thing that ever happened to me. Even if he annoyed me half the time.

"You didn't. Maybe that's a sign. If he hadn't, I never would've met you."

It was too much. I walked to the hooks by the door and grabbed my keys. His hand seized mine, spinning me around and pressing me against the wall. His warm body flush against mine. "Don't run away."

"I'm not. I just..." I didn't know what I needed anymore. To kill, to drown in wine, a good fuck. I didn't know. I just needed to clear my head.
###Chapter 0231

He takes the keys from my grasp. “I’m driving.”

I don’t argue. I let him have them.

While I slide into my wedges, he asks where we’re headed.

“Just drive,” I murmur, following him outside.

He stays silent as he navigates the back roads. He gives me space. Lets my mind race.

He’s waiting for me to speak.

I don’t know how far we’ve gone when he pulls over beneath some trees. The sun is beginning to rise in the distance.

“Keep driving.”

“I’ve been driving for hours. We’ll need gas soon.” His voice is low.

It’s time. I have to tell him.

“All my life, I’ve been searching for my half-sister. Trying to fix what was broken. What happened to me and my mother. She was impossible to find. Until recently. All I had was a name. When our kind hides in the shadows, do you have any idea how difficult that is?”

He stays quiet. His eyes don’t leave me.

“I discovered I had a talent for killing when I was a teenager. I was damn good at it. It felt natural. People paid me to solve their problems. It was a convenient way to make money while doing what I loved. Do you know how rare that is? Of course you don’t. I’m sure big brother gave you everything you ever wanted.”

It was a cheap shot. I knew it. The anger was talking.

“Did Zachary ever seem evil to you?”

He shakes his head. “Honestly, I didn’t know him that well.”

“Shifting and killing… it does something to Lycans.” I shake my head. “It turns us into worse monsters than we already are. Sometimes, you can’t stop it.” I let out a heavy breath. I’ve never told anyone that. It’s exhausting just thinking about it.

“You came back from that,” he says, his dark eyes holding mine.

“And one day, I might lose that fight all over again.” He deserves the truth now that he’s hearing my secrets.

“How long has it been?”

“Four years.”

“And you still think it could happen again?”

I nod, watching the sun climb over the hills.

“Why?”

My eyes snap to his. “What do you mean, ‘why’?”

“Why would you go back? If you don’t want that life, just don’t go back.”

“If only it were that simple. The best way I can explain it is… it has a grip on you. Lycans weren’t meant to live like humans. Or even like Wolves. We were designed to control the population.”

“Human numbers keep growing. They’re slowly destroying the world. So we… thin them out. But some Rogues take it too far.” I add.

“You’re talking about that town. Where Gabriel was from.”

I nod. “They should have moved on. Their mistake.”

“You’ve never talked about this, have you? You’ve kept it bottled up for years.”

“If you haven’t noticed, I don’t exactly have friends.”

He pulls the lever and slides his seat back. He reaches over and unclips my belt. In one motion, he pulls me onto his lap. His hands frame my face, drawing me close.

“You have me.”

His lips crash into mine. Rough. Urgent. His tongue demands entry.

I gave him the worst parts of me. And he didn’t flinch. He didn’t pull away. He let me pour it all out without pushing for more.

I twist my body, straddling his thighs. My arms lock around his neck. I kiss him back with the same ferocity.

He understands me more than anyone ever has. I’ve let him in deeper than anyone else.

I break the kiss. My chest heaves as I stare at him. Maybe he is my salvation.

“Okay,” I whisper. I tilt my head back, offering my neck. “Do it.”
###Chapter 0232
Athena

Isabella crawls into my bed beside me.
The twins were finally asleep.
I had been enjoying the quiet until she burst into my room.

“It’s good, right? That he’s dead?” she asks.

I shrug slightly.
“I don’t know.”

She eyes me with suspicion.
“Because Seraphina supposedly killed him?”

“Doesn’t it feel too easy for her?” I counter. “Zachary tracked him for a full month and still couldn’t finish him. When Gabriel was here, none of us could even touch him. Yet he destroyed so many lives.”

“Okay, you have a point,” she mutters.
I still don’t understand any of it.
Or what Seraphina truly wants.
Everyone seems to have a different theory.

Isabella opens a chocolate bar and nibbles on it.
She’s thinking hard, searching for the right words.
“Maybe she was helping Julian get revenge… but you’re right. It does seem too straightforward.”

“He’s definitely dead, Athena. I saw the color drain from Zachary’s face. He tried to act tough, but the pain was visible.”

“Could they have faked it? Maybe Gabriel is working with them, too.”

She shakes her head firmly.
“Gabriel killed Sophia. There’s no way Julian would ever work with him. And you can’t fake the pain of losing a sibling.”

“But no one expected him to work with a Lycan either. Not after he blamed Alexander for bringing Zachary and Brianna here.”

“Hmm.” She frowns and offers me a piece of chocolate.
I decline with a shake of my head.
“Zachary has a theory,” she says, popping the chocolate into her mouth.
I don’t know how she stays so slim—she’s always eating.

“Tell me.”

“He thinks it’s an attempt to get closer to you.”

I snort. “To me?”

“Like some twisted, messed-up plan. He doesn’t know the details, but he’s sure it’s something.”

“I think we all agree on that. I might not have seen through things when I was younger, but I’ve learned. Everyone has an agenda.”

“And she’s still with Julian. Knowing my brother, he’s probably told her everything about our pack—how it works, all our secrets. He wasn’t supposed to, but that was before he cut himself off from us.” Her shoulders slump.
She won’t admit it, but she misses him.
Even though he’s become a problem.

“I wish he could see that he’s lost his way,” she adds, staring down at her hands. “Alexander would forgive him. He’s family.”

I don’t tell her what Alexander really said about him.
Forgiveness is the last thing on my mate’s mind.
In fact, he’s mentioned multiple times that he’d let the others tear Julian apart for endangering the pack and our family.

“I don’t think he cares about that anymore, Isabella. It’s been months.”

“Maybe she has some kind of hold over him.” She sounds like she’s trying to convince herself.
Or maybe Midnight.

I keep my thoughts to myself, shrugging.

‘You should tell her,’ Nyx murmurs.

‘No. Deep down, she already knows,’ I snap back.

I watch Isabella’s shoulders sink even lower.
“We’ve lost him for good, haven’t we?”

“I don’t know. What I do know is that it’s been a long time since we heard anything from him. And the first news we get isn’t even from him—it’s from the Alpha of Crestwood City. He didn’t even acknowledge the death of his own children.”

She falls back against my pillows, staring up at the ceiling.
The remainder of her chocolate bar drops to the floor.
A single tear escapes the corner of her eye, tracing a path down to the pillow.
###Chapter 0233

A sharp knock came at the door seconds later. Zachary didn’t wait for an invitation to enter.

His dark gaze fixed on her as fresh tears escaped the corners of her eyes.

He crossed the room swiftly, sliding his arms beneath her despite her weak protests against being touched.

He drew her firmly against his chest until she yielded, allowing him to lift her and carry her from the room.

As they departed, Alexander entered, pressing a warm kiss to my cheek. “What was that about?”

“She misses him.”

He nodded, understanding exactly who I meant.

“Do you think there’s a chan—”

“No.” He cut me off before I could finish. “Julian made his position painfully clear. He doesn’t want this. I won’t cater to his whims!”

Occasionally, he used words or phrases unfamiliar to me. I think he sometimes forgot my past. The only language I knew was what I’d heard around the house. I’d learned more since arriving, but gaps remained.

He saw my expression and softened his tone. “I won’t give him what he wants just because he’s throwing a tantrum. My duty is to our family and the pack. I must do what’s best for them.”

“I want to help her. But I don’t know how.”

“You can’t.” His eyes drifted to our sleeping twins. “It’s more than a sibling missing a sibling. Their connection is profound. Alpha-blood twins. Blessed with twin Wolves. That bond, forged since conception, can’t be severed just because he left the pack.”

“Can she still mind-link him?”

“No.”

“But you said their bond is stronger. What about her Wolf, Midnight? Could she connect with his?”

“Aspen? Honestly, I haven’t considered it. If you haven’t noticed, she avoids talking about Julian with me. Or Zachary.” He added with a sigh. “She did this after our parents died. She partially shuts down. It’s hard to see because she functions, but she buries the pain. She won’t discuss what truly weighs on her.”

“She talks to me. Not extensively, but she does.”

“And for that, I am immensely grateful.” He kissed my cheek again, his lips moving down to find mine.

The electricity of his touch ignited my senses as the kiss deepened. His tongue explored my mouth while his hand tangled in my hair, holding me close.

“The boys,” I murmured, pulling back slightly.

He growled in frustration when I resisted. “They are sleeping in their own room tonight.”

“But…” I started to protest. I’d kept them near me every night since their birth. Their safety was my responsibility. Protecting them from the world’s chaos was my duty.

“They’re nearly seven months old. Their nursery has been ready for months. They’ll be right next door. I’ll post a guard if it eases your mind. I need time alone with my mate. Even if it’s just for a few hours.”

He nuzzled the mark on my neck, well aware it was my weak spot. His warm breath made my skin tingle.

“Two guards,” I whispered.

“If it means I get you to myself, you can have a dozen guards.” He kissed me again, just as Evrin began to cry. He muttered something about that being the reason he wanted me alone as he climbed off the bed.

Logan woke moments later. It was definitely a twin thing.
###Chapter 0234
Athena

The cribs were being moved when Alexander received a link.
Someone matching my description was spotted at the pack gates.

My entire body stiffened instantly.
Why in hell would she show up here?
It was strange she hadn't attempted to sneak in this time.

“Stay with Isabella and the boys.” Alexander kissed me quickly. “Zachary, you’re coming with me.”

“No.” I snapped.

Both men froze mid-motion.

“She’s clearly here for me. That’s why she came the first time—to tell me about my father.”

“Athena….”

“I can handle this.” I muttered.
I understood his real reason for wanting me to stay.
He wanted to keep me calm.
To prevent the growing darkness from consuming my heart.
But Zachary had been right about one thing.
Our sons helped keep that darkness at bay.

“I don’t….”

“I’ll go with her.” Zachary cut him off. “The boys need one parent here. I swear on my life, nothing will happen to her.”

Alexander had a complicated relationship with Zachary.
He appreciated Zachary’s unwavering loyalty to me.
But he hated how Zachary sometimes challenged his authority, even after accepting the Beta position.

“If anything….” Alexander began.

“Nothing will happen. I’d let her kill me before allowing harm to come to Athena.”

My eyes widened. “Don’t let Isabella hear you say that!”
She would be devastated hearing him prioritize another woman over his own life.

The two men stared each other down.
They couldn’t link privately, but a silent argument clearly passed between them.

One thing I’d learned in this pack: men were worse than women when arguing.
Always trying to assert dominance.
Nobody challenged Alexander except Zachary.

“Zachary!” I snapped. “Are you coming?”

I turned away before Alexander’s crimson eyes could lock with mine.
I didn’t need reminders of the risks.
My body reminded me every second of every day.

‘What’s the plan?’ Nyx whispered as I descended the stairs.
Zachary’s large frame followed closely behind.

‘I don’t know.’ I muttered back. ‘But stay quiet. Don’t interrupt me or make me miss half the conversation because I’m distracted talking to you!’

She fell silent.
We rounded the final corner.

‘And no shifting.’ I added.
I didn’t need to add more fuel to this fire.
Not yet.

‘That wasn’t me last time.’ She scowled. ‘I told you—that was all you.’

Zachary remained quiet behind me.
For some reason, his presence felt more reassuring than Alexander’s.
Maybe because he didn’t question me.
Or because he wanted me to become the Alpha I was meant to be.
Whatever the reason, I felt less tense.

Seraphina stood at the open gates.
Guards watched her every move.
She looked completely different from last time.
Instead of baggy clothes, she wore skin-tight leather.
A cropped jacket showed off her torso.
She wore the tallest heels I’d ever seen.
Red-painted nails peeked from their tips.

“You like taking your time, don’t you?” Her eyes scanned my plain black leggings and sweatshirt but she made no comment.
Her brown eyes shifted to Zachary. “You must be the other Lycan.”

“You know exactly who I am.” Zachary kept his voice level, devoid of anger.
He waved the guards back. “I’m sure Julian told you everything. How is he, by the way?”

“You don’t need to concern yourself with him.”

Zachary snorted, making me wonder what he really thought of Julian.
Did he stay quiet because he knew it would hurt Isabella?

“Why are you here?” I asked, pulling her focus back to me.

She unzipped her jacket and pulled out a large tan envelope.
She flung it onto the ground between us.
Zachary stepped around me to pick it up. “What’s this?”

“That’s for my half-sister.”

He sniffed it first, making Seraphina cackle. “It’s not poison. I thought it might clarify some things.”

Zachary handed it to me.
Inside was a photo of my father with a woman who wasn’t my mother.
Suddenly, images of my parents’ blood-coated bodies flickered before my eyes.
Their screams of pain filled my ears.
Like an energy burst, I felt the darkness flood through me.
###Chapter 0235

I shove thoughts of Logan and Evrin aside.

“That’s our father, with my mother. Look closely—she’s pregnant. With me.” Seraphina says. “I don’t blame you for doubting me. But how else do you explain how much we look alike?”

“Is that why Julian sought you out?” Zachary challenges. “Because you were the closest thing to Athena?”

She snarls at him. “Julian has claimed me as his.” She pulls her jacket aside and reveals the mark above her collarbone.

Zachary bursts into laughter. “So he marked you because he couldn’t have Athena?!”

Seraphina glares as his laughter fades. I don’t need to look to know he’s still smirking.

Her dark eyes lock on me. “Last time I came, I didn’t handle things well. I made you feel threatened.”

‘Lies.’ Nyx whispers.

“I only wanted you to know the truth about our father. You deserved that much.”

“You’ve told me. Now you can leave.”

“I thought we could talk. Sister to sister.” She insists. “Just the two of us. Alone.”

“Do you really think she’s that stupid?” Brianna’s sharp voice cuts through the air as she drops from a nearby tree. I’d been so focused on holding back the darkness I hadn’t sensed her presence. Had Zachary? He never missed anything.

“Brianna?” Seraphina spits out the name like it’s poison.

“You must be the lying bitch.”

What the hell was happening? They sounded like they knew each other, yet didn’t.

“Julian told me all about you. How you almost killed my half-sister?” Seraphina’s eyes return to me. “Why did you let her live?”

“I don’t owe you an explanation.” I snap.

She steps toward me and Zachary moves with her. “Listen carefully, little sister. It’s dangerous to surround yourself with former Rogues.”

“Takes one to know one.” Brianna growls from my other side.

Seraphina steps back. She looks stunned, as if Brianna just revealed a dark secret she never wanted shared—especially with me.

She rocks on her heels, cheeks hollowed as she searches for a response. Instead, she turns to leave, then glances over her shoulder. “Protection means nothing when it comes from the wrong people, Athena.”

She struts down the lane and slips into a luxury car. As it turns around, I catch sight of Julian inside—he looks angrier than ever.

“Brianna, what were you doing in that tree?” I demand.

“I saw her, okay? I was up there watching, like I have been since her last visit. I didn’t believe Zachary when he said she looked like you. I had to see for myself.”

“What did you mean, ‘takes one to know one’?”

Her eyes dart to Zachary. “He had his suspicions.”

I spin toward him. “Why?”

“That day I saw them drive off together. She was the only Lycan around.”

“So?”

“Lycans who prefer solitude are usually ones who’ve gone Rogue.”

“I wasn’t going to accuse her outright.” Brianna adds. “But her reaction confirmed it. It’s not something she wants known.”

“So she’s felt this?” I murmur, pressing a hand to my heart. “This darkness.”

They both sigh.

“I’m not saying I feel sorry for her.” I snap. “She clearly wants something from me.”

‘She’s lying to you.’ Nyx murmurs. ‘Last time and now, she acts like a different person each time. Don’t fall for it.’

I glance down at the half-crumpled photo in my hand. My father had loved another, but gave it all up for his true mate—and Seraphina hated me for it.
###Chapter 0236
Brianna

“What a complete bitch!” I mutter under my breath, seething with frustration. How could two people share the same father yet be so entirely different?

Zachary swings the front door open forcefully. He had waited until Athena was safely back with Alexander before coming to find me.

“What the hell were you thinking?” he demands sharply. “I had to tell Athena it was my idea for you to be hiding in the damn trees.”

“Why would you say that?”

“Because she questions everything you do. You’re lucky she bought it. Are you trying to get yourself killed?”

“No, I just… I thought I could help by keeping watch. Nobody lets me join guard duty, so I took matters into my own hands. We all know Rogues and Lycans favor tree cover.”

“Why didn’t you just tell me your plan?”

“Because you would’ve said no. You seem to forget I used to watch over the Rogues before you. I kept an eye on anyone passing through town. And it’s a good thing I was in those trees. Neither of you spotted the gun tucked into the back of her ridiculous leather leggings!”

“A gun?” His surprise mirrors my own when I first saw it.

“Yes! Not exactly a Lycan’s weapon of choice, right? But I know what I saw!”

I lift the coffee pot and gesture if he wants a cup. He nods, slowly sinking into a chair as he processes my words.

“You think she was going to kill Athena?”

“I don’t know. All I know is the moment she asked to speak to Athena alone, I had to act. Athena might still hate me, but if I can prevent her death, I will.” I shrug wearily. I’m tired of constantly proving myself, but I’ll keep trying as long as I’m here and breathing.

“I appreciate what you did.”

“But she doesn’t, does she?” I sigh deeply. “I don’t know what else to do, Zachary. If I just sit around, I feel like I’m waiting for the day Athena decides she’s had enough and orders my execution. If I act, it’s wrong. If I don’t act, it’s wrong. I’ve told you many times - maybe now is the time I leave for good.”

“No.” His response is blunt and final. No explanation. Just that single word.

“Zachary, you know as well as I do that everyone who’s hurt her is dead. She keeps very few people in her inner circle because of it. You, Isabella, Theodore, Sebastian and Alexander. That’s it. I’m literally waiting for her to say ‘enough’ and have me hanged in front of everyone.”

“She won’t hang you.”

“You won’t be able to stop her. She’ll just order you to stand down.”

“No, I mean she won’t hang you. She’ll have you torn apart or rip your heart from your chest.”

“Thanks for the vote of confidence!” I snap sarcastically.

He groans. “Forgiveness doesn’t come easily for some people.”

My shoulders slump. “I know, but you’re the only one here who tolerates me. Everyone else only sees what I did years ago. Nobody lets me train with them. Nobody wants to be my friend except you.”

“I’ve seen you talking to Isabella and Theodore.”

“Okay, maybe Isabella. But I think Theodore only talks to me because he’s an oddball.”

“It’s not like you to sound so whiny.” Zachary raises an eyebrow at me.

“This isn’t whining. This is me reaching the end of my patience. Unlike other situations, I can’t just take her forgiveness. It’s not a physical object! I have to earn it, and I genuinely don’t know how.” I slam his mug down harder than intended, coffee sloshing onto the table.

I angrily wipe up the spill, feeling his dark eyes burning into the side of my face.

“Have you considered this might not actually be about you?” His tone holds no frustration, unlike mine.

“What are you talking about?”

“The whole time we’ve been here, what have we learned?”

“That I’m the bitch?!”

He snorts and shakes his head. “She comes from trauma. Not once has she had it easy. And I still believe we don’t know everything. Darkness clings to every part of her being, feeding on that trauma, manipulating her thoughts and feelings in ways she probably doesn’t even recognize. You know this.”

“Then there’s also the possibility she doesn’t know how to handle genuine apologies. Or maybe she’s never heard one from someone who truly means it. We both know sometimes it’s easier to stay angry at the world than to forgive. And it’s ten times harder for her because she’s fighting battles only she can fight.”
###Chapter 0237

I sip my coffee, studying him. "You're absolutely certain you weren't a therapist in your human life?" He possesses this uncanny ability to perceive things others completely miss.

"Quite certain. My point is, you shouldn't surrender. Not now."

"While you pursued Gabriel, I shared quarters with Isabella. I hoped it might bridge a gap between us. Instead, it only seemed to intensify her resentment toward me."

"Isabella is her closest friend."

"I'm aware."

"It's plausible she feared losing her friend to you."

I roll my eyes dramatically. "That sounds like ridiculous high school drama."

He chuckles softly. "And that is precisely where you misunderstand."

I frown, exhaling heavily. His infuriating accuracy was sometimes too much. "Could you arrange a meeting with her? You could be present too."

"I can ask. But I promise nothing."

I offer a small, grateful smile. At least he was willing to try.

After finishing his coffee, he leaves to check on Charlotte. I'm alone again. How was it possible to feel more isolated in a pack full of Wolves than I ever did in that derelict town?

I refill my mug and step outside. I settle on the cool stones of my small porch.

Pack members pass by. I raise my hand in greeting. They ignore me completely, acting as if I'm invisible. I do this most days. Each time, a little more hope dies that I'll ever find a place here.

Theodore suddenly leans into my view, waving a hand. "You alright?"

"I'll manage," I mutter.

He walks over anyway. His large frame casts a shadow over me, blocking the fading evening sun.

"Care for a walk?" His deep green eyes are wide and hopeful.

"Don't pity me."

He looks surprised, almost offended. "I don't. My services aren't critically needed right now. I have free time." I roll my eyes as he adjusts his man bun. "If you don't want to walk, I'll just keep you company."

He doesn't wait for an answer. He simply plops down on the stone beside me. "I heard you were watching from the trees."

"Word travels fast," I mutter, finishing my coffee.

"It's a pack. That's what happens."

"Is that why you keep to yourself?" I ask, not really caring about his answer.

"Yes."

"If I kept to myself, they'd probably show up at my door with pitchforks."

He nods in agreement.

"You're not supposed to agree," I snap.

"I can't disagree when I agree." He smirks, his green eyes brightening. "I know how they are."

"Did you actually want to be Beta?" I ask curiously. He'd stepped up when Sebastian was drowning in alcohol. But since Zachary accepted the role, Theodore just seemed to wander the grounds.

"Yes and no. Zachary is perfect for it. He has Athena's best interests at heart." He smiles to himself. "He challenges Alexander when no one else dares. His human past is a valuable asset. If I were permanent Beta, I'd never have time for my research."

"What are you researching?"

He scrunches his face. "Lycans."

"You know there are two right here you could ask."

"No offense, but I'm researching bloodline Lycans." He adds. "And Athena can't answer my questions. I was the one who discovered she's a Lycan, after all."

"You?"

"No need to sound so shocked."

"Sorry," I mumble. "It's just... even before I was bitten, I knew what Victoria and the others were. How did she not?"

"She believed she was a Wolf. It was only when she started sharing information that Alexander realized things didn't add up."

I sigh, the familiar weight of guilt settling in my heart.

They were cruel to her. I stood back and let it happen. Right up until I attacked her myself. Betrayed by the family meant to protect her. It really shouldn't be a surprise she can't forgive me.

"She didn't trust me initially, either," he adds, as if reading my thoughts.

"She didn't?"

He smiles again. "Alexander brought her to my house for her first tutoring session. She panicked because I stood behind her, helping with her words. Fear of being hit. Fear of the unknown. It put her on edge."

"What did you do?"

"I gave her space. I talked to her. Told her how I ended up in the pack. We have something in common. I was bound as a child, too."

"You were?"

"A long story, but yes. I think that shared experience helped her relax."

"I don't have anything in common with her."

"Are you certain about that?"

###Chapter 0239
Athena

I stood over the empty cribs in the nursery.
My heart ached knowing the twins would sleep here tonight.
It was for their safety, but the separation felt wrong.

“I knew I’d find you here.”
Zachary’s deep voice echoed through the quiet room.
His presence made the space feel even more hollow.

I turned to face him, my eyes wide. “You are?”
“Alexander thought you’d prefer it if I took watch tonight.” He gave a firm nod. “You know I’d die before letting anything happen to them.”

“Thank you,” I whispered.

“Plus, I can keep an eye on Lottie.”
“Her nightmares are getting worse again, aren’t they?” I’d heard her whimpers last night. Desperate sounds she couldn’t explain.

He sighed heavily. “Yeah.”

“She’s just a child. She has a father who loves her.” He rolled his eyes slightly. Even after seven months, he still struggled with the title. “She’ll grow up surrounded by love. These bad dreams… they’ll fade.”

Zachary leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed. “She has the childhood you never got.”

I offered a sad smile. Lottie was lucky Zachary found her—not someone cruel. We still didn’t know if Gabriel had known she was in that bar.

“You said you were looking for me?” I asked.

“I was.”

“Why?”

He frowned, choosing his words. “Seraphina had a gun.”

“I didn’t see one.”

“Brianna said it was tucked in the back of her leggings. That’s why she jumped down from the tree. She thought you were about to get shot.”

“She told you that?”

He nodded, waiting. When I stayed silent, he added, “She was trying to protect you.”

“Like she ‘protected’ Victoria?” Bitterness sharpened my tone.

“She’s never forgiven herself for that. She’s killed before, but what happened to you… it haunts her.”

“Good.”

“She can’t change the past, Athena. None of us can.”

His words pierced me. Alexander had said the same thing. That we could only build a better future. “You think I should forgive her?”

“I think you should hear her out. If you still want her gone after that, she’ll leave.” I saw the pain in his eyes at the thought. “I can be there with you, if that helps.”

“No.”

“Athena, she’s trying—”

“I’ll go. But I want to do it alone.”

He raised a brow. “You sure?”

“I’ll talk to her tomorrow.”

‘Then she can leave,’ Nyx murmured inside me. I didn’t repeat it as Zachary walked away with a faint smile.

Relaxing felt impossible. Like I didn’t deserve to. The boys hadn’t stirred, sleeping soundly while Zachary and another guard stood watch outside.

“They’re safe,” Alexander murmured, pulling me toward the bathroom. His lips traced my jaw, moving slowly toward the mark on my neck. “You need to relax.” His breath fanned across my skin, sparking every nerve. He stepped back, gaze intense. “Now take off your clothes.”

I pulled the sweatshirt over my head. His smile widened, crimson eyes burning with hunger.

I held his stare as I slowly pushed down my leggings and panties, stepping out of them.

“Get in,” he ordered.

I stepped into the hot water and gasped. The heat soothed me, washing away the tension.

I hugged my knees to my chest and closed my eyes. Everything faded when he stepped in behind me. His legs slid around mine, pulling me against his solid chest. I felt his hardened length press against my lower back.

His teeth caught my earlobe, sucking gently. His hands cupped my breasts, thumbs brushing over my stiffened nipples before giving a light pinch. His lips moved from my ear to my neck, sucking on his mark until a soft moan escaped me.

I tipped my head back onto his shoulder. His lips found mine, rough and demanding. He sucked my bottom lip, grazing it with his teeth before letting go.
###Chapter 0240

His hand cups my jaw, forcing my gaze to remain locked with his. The other hand slips beneath the water’s surface, fingers trailing down until they find the sensitive heat between my thighs.

“Alexander,” I whisper as he strokes my folds, awakening a deep, throbbing need.

A smirk plays on his lips as his palm presses firmly against me. “Tell me what you want.”

“You,” I murmur, voice trembling.

He gives one slow, deliberate stroke that sends shivers through my entire body. My hips lift instinctively, seeking more. Water sloshes over the edge of the tub. His grip tightens, holding me still.

I stare into his crimson eyes. “More.”

His finger pushes deeper, but still too slowly. Agonizing. He knows exactly what he’s doing.

“Please,” I breathe.

His gaze doesn’t waver. He flicks his finger once, teasing.

Impatient, I slide my own hand into the water, pushing his aside. I circle my clit myself.

His eyes narrow. He loves watching me touch myself. But he prefers having full control.

A low groan escapes me as he adds a second finger.

“Oh, Alexander.” My hips buck, but he keeps his rhythm steady, stretching me slowly.

Then a third finger drives into me. My core clenches, trying to hold back the building climax. It’s useless. I shatter around his fingers, hips rocking wildly as pleasure takes over.

He turns me abruptly, ignoring the water splashing everywhere. His cock presses against my entrance as he pulls me into a fierce kiss. Tangling his hands in my dark hair, his tongue explores my mouth.

Lifting my hips, I slide my wetness along his hard length, coating him before positioning him at my entrance.

He grips my hips and slams me down onto him. A cry of pleasure-pain escapes me as he fills me completely.

“So fucking sexy,” he growls, fingers digging into my skin as he thrusts upward. My jaw drops.

I hold onto his shoulders, moving up and down slowly. I feel him twitch inside me every time I sink down. He tortured me with slowness earlier. Now it’s my turn.

He tries to thrust faster, but I resist, staying seated longer each time.

“Should I bend you over?” he mutters darkly.

“You had your fun. Now it’s mine,” I reply.

A dark grin spreads across his face. He pulls my hands from his shoulders, pinning my wrists behind my back with one large hand. His other hand finds my clit, thumb circling my swollen bud as I bounce on him.

My eyes roll back. The ache inside me intensifies. We’re both holding on, waiting.

“Fuck, Athena,” he snarls as I ride him hard. I bite my lip, teetering on the edge.

He releases my wrists, hands settling on my hips as he slams me down harder. “Alexander!” I cry out, head falling back.

“Look at me,” he demands. I turn my face toward him, but my vision blurs as euphoria crashes over me.

He thrusts up, filling me with his release as he pulls me tightly against him.

We breathe heavily, matched in rhythm. He runs his fingers through my wet hair as I relax against him.

A smile lingers on my lips. Not just from the pleasure. He makes me feel like everything is truly okay.
###Chapter 0241
Athena

The twins slept through the entire night.
Not a single cry or whimper.
It should have been a relief, but part of me wished their first night alone hadn’t been so flawless.
While they slept, Alexander made up for every moment we’d lost since their birth.
I could still feel the effects this morning.

“Good thing they slept,” Isabella murmured, bouncing Evrin gently.
“I know. I’m just being…” I sighed.
“You’re being a mom.” Her dark eyes lifted to meet mine, and I knew what was coming. “You’re really meeting with her?”
“Yes.”
“Are you nervous?”
“Worried I might shift and kill her,” I joked, but she stared back, alarmed. “Kidding. I’m kidding. I stayed calm when Seraphina visited. I can do it again.”

“Zachary said he would—”
“I know, and I appreciate it. But this is something I need to do alone.” I sighed heavily. “I’ve been torn over this for too long.”
I hadn’t spoken about it to anyone.
Most believed I despised Brianna.
But that wasn’t entirely true.
I didn’t trust her. Or her motives.

“You never said anything.”
“I felt like I was supposed to hate her. And I did. She almost killed me. She thought she had.” I shook my head, lifting Logan from his high chair. “I could’ve ended her life multiple times. But I didn’t. She’s Zachary’s closest friend. He sees something in her that I don’t. Or maybe it’s just history.” I shrugged. “I’m giving her this one chance. To clear the air.”

“If you need backup,” Isabella said softly, “you know where I am.”
I set Logan down on the rug surrounded by toys and kissed his head. Then I kissed Evrin. “You’re sure you’re okay watching them?”
“Absolutely.”

I took a deep breath and stepped out the back door.
I walked toward Brianna’s house.

She flung the door open before I could knock.
A wide smile stretched across her face.
Her dirty blonde hair was half-up, half-down.
She wore dungarees over a white tank top.
A cleaning rag was clutched in one hand.

“You actually came,” she said, sounding genuinely surprised.
She tossed the rag out of sight.
I nodded.
She moved aside to let me enter.
I’d avoided her small home until now.

Her eyes darted behind me. “Zachary’s not with you?”
“No.”
“Oh.” She sucked in her cheeks.
“I wanted to come alone.”
“Right.” She gestured toward a small wooden table.
A steaming teapot sat in the center, surrounded by cups and biscuits.

“Wasn’t sure what you preferred. I have coffee too.” She motioned toward the kitchen counter.
She seemed nervous. A far cry from the arrogant woman she used to be.

“Please sit,” she whispered, chewing her bottom lip. “Ask me anything. I’ll tell you everything. I promise.”

I chose the chair facing the front door.
She slid quietly into the one across from me.
Her brown eyes avoided mine at first, as if she was deciding how to begin.

“You ran,” I stated. “After you thought you killed me, you fled.”
She nodded. “I always swore I wouldn’t become my father. But I did. When I stood over you, watching you bleed, I knew my life was over. I had become him. I hated myself.”

“We have that in common,” she added quietly. “Neither of us wanted to be like our parents.”
I swallowed hard, fighting the irritation that flared at her comparing us. “You killed your father?”
“I had to.”
“After me?”
She nodded, cheeks hollow. “I became the thing I feared most. At the time, that mattered more than turning into a Lycan. Becoming Lycan was supposed to be my fresh start. A chance to belong to a pack that valued me.”

I scoffed, but she continued.
“Instead, I became even more like what I hated. So I hunted him. I killed him. Then I ran.”
“You watched your father murder your mother?”
“I saw worse growing up. He raped her. He beat her.” Her voice grew darker. Tears welled in her eyes. “He put cigarettes out on her skin. Once, she dropped his plate. He made her lick the food off the floor. The list goes on.”

My stomach dropped.
That was degradation I had never experienced.
‘Fucker,’ Nyx muttered inside my head.
###Chapter 0242

“He ended her miserable life when he killed her. Perhaps that was the only good thing to come from their marriage.” Her shoulders slump as she pours tea, hands trembling slightly. “I certainly wasn’t a blessing.”

It takes me a moment to process her words. “You… you were conceived from rape?”

She draws a sharp breath, nodding silently.

“Did he ever… try to…”

“No. There was one instance where I feared he might turn on me, but he targeted my mother instead. Do you understand now why I thought Cassandra offered salvation? She made promises. She made me feel valued. She made me feel protected.”

Exactly how she made me feel before she and Dominic betrayed me.

“I know now she was cruel to you. But back then, she gave me a chance at a better life. An escape from waiting for the day my father decided I was old enough to assault. I took that chance. And that’s when everything shattered.”

I could feel Nyx’s sorrow echoing my own as we listened.

“I believed every word she fed me. Every lie about you. I should have known better. After my childhood, I should have understood that trust isn’t bought with empty promises. I see why you don’t trust me, Athena. I see why you hesitate. I wouldn’t trust me either. But I swear I’ll never stop trying to make amends. You can keep hating me. You can treat me like dirt. But I won’t give up.”

“I don’t hate you.”

Her hand stills on the table, surprised. “You… you don’t?”

“I used to wish you had killed me that day. That you ended my pain permanently.”

“I’m sorry.” She reaches for my hand instinctively. I pull back, and her expression fractures. “Having you here is a constant reminder that you could have ended my suffering but didn’t.” I shake my head, a faint smile forming. “Sounds ridiculous, right? Especially since my mate is the Alpha here. If you had killed me, my sons wouldn’t exist.”

“No.” Her brows furrow. “It’s not stupid. You were seeking an escape. Even if death was the only way out.”

Silence hangs between us. Brianna nibbles a biscuit while I search for words.

‘We should give her a chance.’ Nyx whispers.

“Was killing your father what turned you Rogue?” I blurt out.

“No, it was what I did to you. I had already turned when I killed him.” A dark smile touches her lips. “He tried to repent as I tore him apart. The bastard thought praying to his god would absolve him.”

She shoves the rest of the biscuit into her mouth, savoring the memory. I don’t judge her satisfaction. There’s justice in ending someone who deserves none.

“Something doesn’t add up. You said Zachary was the only one you helped turn back successfully. Who helped you?”

She grimaces. “Rogues embrace the lifestyle. It’s simple. Zachary must have told you that. The darkness consumes you. For me, it felt… wrong. Like my darkness was forced. Like I was pretending to be something I’m not. If you ask Zachary, he’ll tell you I’m more human than Lycan, aside from shifting.”

“I don’t follow.”

“Victoria turned me because I told her what she wanted to hear. I ensured she wouldn’t reject me. I pretended to be someone I wasn’t. When I hurt you, something else took over. I was trying to prove myself to her. How stupid is that?”

‘Sounds like brainwashing.’ Nyx murmurs. ‘Victoria exploited her desperation.’

I understood that. For years, I believed Dominic was my brother. For years, I blamed myself for my parents’ deaths.

Her brown eyes lift to meet mine. “You wish I had killed you back then. I wish I had never met Victoria.”

“You wouldn’t be a Lycan.”

“I know.” She shrugs again, surprising me. “Hurting you and letting Victoria bite me are the two worst decisions I’ve ever made. I can’t change them. But I can use one to help you now, if you let me. Starting with that bitch who claims to be your half-sister.”
###Chapter 0243
Brianna

Athena hasn't spoken for nearly five minutes.
Her silence unnerves me far more than her words ever could.

I pour another cup of tea.
My hand trembles slightly as I select a biscuit from the plate.
Slow movements.
That's my safest approach.
Perhaps she didn't believe anything I confessed.
I desperately hope that isn't true.
Revealing my past demanded everything I had.
Only Zachary knew the full truth of what I shared.

I nibble the edge of the biscuit while studying her.
Her eyes haven't turned black.
A promising sign, I hope.
Then again, they hadn't changed color when she tortured Ethan either.

Several more minutes crawl by.
Panic truly begins to set in.
This is it.
I'm going to die.

"Okay."

"Huh?"

"One chance." The words drip slowly from her tongue, utterly unexpected.
I had been more certain than I realized that she would actually kill me.

"Sure." I nod frantically.
For years I believed I controlled my own life.
That illusion shattered when I arrived here.
My past has always wreaked havoc in my mind, denying me true control.

"I can't promise I'll find your presence easy." She furrows her brow, seemingly unsure of her own decision. "But I will try, provided you don't fuck me over."

"Yes Alpha."

A sudden darkness flashes in her beautiful blue eyes.
A warning from her Lycan, I hope.
Rather than a sign that the darkness is advancing.

"I will do anything." I had vehemently opposed Zachary sending me here with Alexander and his brother.
This was the absolute last place on Earth I wanted to be.
But deep down, I knew what needed to be done.
She is the Alpha.
She would have found me eventually anyway.
Then everything could have been so much worse.

She rises from her seat.
Yet she still carries the weight of the world on her shoulders.

"I can track her down." I murmur softly. "I saw the car. The registration plate. I can find her. My bet is she hasn't gone far outside the pack."

Her brows knit together tightly.
She sucks in her cheeks thoughtfully.

"You don't have to do anything, but knowing her hiding place could be beneficial. Perhaps I can dig up more information about her for you."

"She might shoot you." Athena mumbles.

"We both know you're not worried about that."

She hesitates, lifting her eyes to meet mine. "You can't tell anyone. Including Zachary."

"Of course." Though I'm fairly certain if Zachary catches even a whiff, he'll be onto me.
Sometimes, he understands me better than I understand myself.

Athena moves to the door, pausing with her hand over the handle. "Thank you for answering my questions." She leaves without looking back.
Unexpected tears well in my eyes.
Maybe there truly is a chance for us.

In the afternoon, I take my mug and step outside to sit on the stone porch.
My heart feels less constricted now, but caution remains necessary.
Athena could still decide I'm not worth the trouble.

Zachary approaches with Charlotte skipping happily beside him.
She's a wonderful child, but like the rest of us, she carries her own burdens.

She throws her arms around my hips as she reaches me. "Brianna." She beams up at me with her bright green eyes.

"How did it go?" Zachary studies me as if expecting the worst.

"Okay."

He cocks a brow skeptically.

"Seriously Zachary. We talked for hours. She asked questions and I told her everything I could."

"Everything?"

I nod. "I couldn't risk hiding anything. She would have seen through it anyway."

"Time makes a difference." He mumbles.

I shake my head. "Actually, Theodore gave me some good advice."

"Theodore?" He mutters in surprise.

I nod. "Besides you, he's the only person who seems to like having me around."

"I do too." Charlotte yells as she picks flowers from the small garden patch.

Zachary narrows his dark eyes at me. "Are you and him... mates?"

I shake my head, almost laughing. "No. No he is not my mate. I'm just saying he isn't as annoying as I first thought."

Charlotte brings me the bunch of daisies she picked.
I begin weaving them into a daisy chain.
She watches in amazement, telling me I'm so clever.

"Did you really come to check on me?" I ask Zachary as Charlotte dances around with the daisy chain crowning her head.

"I had to verify you were still alive." He bumps his shoulder into mine, laughing. "So she's accepted you?"
###Chapter 0244

“She’s offering me a chance to redeem myself.” I shrug lightly. “It’s more than I expected.”

Zachary and Charlotte remain for a short time. It’s almost surreal to see how much he’s changed from the feral creature I first encountered. I never imagined we would build a life like this. And I refuse to lose it—not when Athena is finally giving me an opportunity.

I wait until nightfall before slipping away. Climbing high into the forest canopy, staying out of sight. From above, it’s easy to move branch to branch toward the edge of the pack territory.

Guards patrol below, but the moment they turn away, searching for my scent, I leap and run. The faster I gather information for Athena, the better. But I’m doing this the old-fashioned way. No technology. I need to see things with my own eyes.

Breaking into a parked car is child’s play. It’s an older red Nissan. Inconspicuous. Exactly what I need.

I drive toward the city. That’s where Zachary last saw her. Though she’s likely smart enough not to stay in one place too long. Her clothing suggested she wasn’t hiding in some rundown building or cave. She has a home. Somewhere to store expensive clothes and reapply makeup.

I’m about to return to Obsidian Howl when I spot her car partially hidden behind dumpsters. They tried concealing it on a driveway beside a quaint house.

Quietly, I move closer and check the license plate. It’s definitely hers. For now, that’s all I need.

I turn to head back to the stolen car when a familiar scent hits me.

Julian steps out from the shadows near the parked vehicle. His arms are crossed over his broad chest. He’s wearing a crisp black suit—something I never expected from him.

“Brianna.” He says my name like it’s poison, rolling the syllables slowly. “What are you doing here, Brianna?”

I narrow my eyes. He tuts, shaking his head slightly as he moves closer, looming over me. Though I could easily overpower him if I shifted.

“I see she has you wrapped around her finger.”

“Why are you here, Brianna? Did your lover send you?” He chuckles darkly. Some things never change.

When did he become so twisted? Alexander was right about one thing—Julian would have fit in perfectly with the Rogues. Maybe that’s what Seraphina sees in him.

“I came alone.” I have no idea if he’s linked with her yet. My best option is to keep him talking. “I was curious.”

“About what?”

“Seraphina. She looks just like Athena. Are they twins?” I lie. He saw how short-tempered Athena was with me. Even the other day when Seraphina showed up and he was in the car, he witnessed Athena’s anger toward me.

“None of your business.” He curls his lip in annoyance.

“You’re right. It’s my weakness. Curiosity always gets the better of me.” I keep lying. I can lie to anyone—as long as it’s not my Alpha.

He presses his lips into a thin line and glances at the old red car.

“I stole it,” I blurt out. “Alexander would never let me take a car to look for you.”

He nods, seeming to believe me.

“You were stupid to come alone, Brianna.”

“It’s not like I have anyone on my side anymore.” I shrug. “Zachary has Isabella. The pack hates me. I wanted to find somewhere I’d feel welcome.” Each lie burns inside me.

“Then why did you stop Seraphina?”

“I was still trying to help. I’ve spent so long trying, but it’s time to give up.” I slump my shoulders, feigning defeat. “Is Seraphina here?”

“She’s working.”

“Oh.” I let myself deflate further, burying my surprise. What kind of work does she do? And why is her car still here?

“Get in the car and go home.”

“It’s not my home,” I mutter. “But I’ll go.”

He watches me slide into the car and start the engine. He only steps back onto the pavement as I begin to move. I got what I needed for now.
###Chapter 0245
Seraphina

I down another gulp of wine, my blood boiling. “You want to bring in someone else to assist me?” Julian’s dark eyes remain fixed on me. He still hadn’t grasped the simple fact that aside from him, no one else worked for me. Or with me.

“Athena despises her. You witnessed it yourself when Brianna leaped from that tree. The fury in Athena’s eyes was unmistakable.”

“Then why is the girl still breathing?” I refill my glass as he searches for a response. “According to your intel, how long have they been in the pack? A year?”

“Approximately.” He shrugs, as if the timeline is irrelevant. “Perhaps my brother is preventing it.”

I let out a derisive snort, suppressing the hysterical laugh threatening to escape. “That never stopped her before.” Julian had detailed all the others my dear sister had eliminated. So what made this Brianna so exceptionally special?

“Wouldn’t an inside contact be advantageous?” he presses.

“And you believe she is that contact. How do you expect her to gather intel if Athena loathes her?”

“She’s Damien’s closest friend.”

“And?” I counter. “That means nothing if they aren’t sharing secrets. I will admit, I’m impressed she located my home. She’s the first to ever manage that.” I pinch the bridge of my nose, a headache forming. “Repeat everything she told you. Now.”

He rolls his eyes but complies, recounting Brianna’s words. “Why didn’t you just mind-link me?” I demand when he finishes.

“I’m not a complete fool. That’s precisely what she wanted. I needed to interrogate her first. Gauge her true allegiance.”

I roll my eyes right back at him and take another large swallow of wine. “My point is, hearing it firsthand allows me to detect lies. Secondhand information is unreliable.”

“She wasn’t lying.” His tone is utterly confident, but confidence doesn’t equate to correctness. I’ve spent decades surrounded by liars. Very few are ever convincing. “If Alexander had sent her, he would have provided a pack vehicle. Not some beat-up rust bucket she hotwired. I know how Alexander operates. He always flaunts his power.”

“Unless Alexander wasn’t the one who sent her,” I suggest.

Now it’s his turn to roll his eyes. “Must you challenge everything I say?”

“Oh, honey,” I purr, a cold smile touching my lips. “I’ve been playing this game far longer than you. You may be older, but your tactics are all pack-learned. You see only the immediate threat. You solve only the obvious problem. You consistently miss the larger chessboard. You were merely surviving on your own before I found you.”

I pause, watching him huff in irritation. Why do men always resist the truth? Why must they always assume control and believe their plans are infallible?

“If she shows up again—and she undoubtedly will—you call for me immediately.”

He gives a curt nod of acknowledgment. I’m already calculating, trying to discern if her curiosity was genuine or a clever ruse to gather information for Alexander and Athena.

Brianna returns the very next evening. Her dirty blonde hair is tied in a loose, messy bun atop her head. Strands frame her pretty face. She checks her reflection in the rearview mirror before stepping out of the old red car.

“Hello, Brianna,” I murmur, emerging from the shadows.

She doesn’t startle at my voice like most would. “I wasn’t expecting you.”

“You were hoping for my mate?”

“Yes,” she replies, folding her arms across her chest. “Since he was here yesterday, I assumed it would be him. Besides, he made it clear he wouldn’t let me speak to you.” Her chocolate-brown eyes drop to my hands. “I see no gun. I hope that means you’re not going to shoot me.”
###Chapter 0246

Fear wasn't present in her demeanor.

She radiated pure confidence.

Boldness suited her, and I found myself appreciating it.

"Wasn't I the one you requested to meet?"

"Indeed. But I also anticipated Julian wouldn't inform you. He isn't—or rather, wasn't—typically forthcoming with details."

"People evolve. Circumstances shift."

She nodded in agreement.

"Who sent you, Brianna?"

"No one. I clarified that to Julian yesterday. Didn't he mention it?" She paused, her gaze intensifying. "Apologies, it's just... you bear such a striking resemblance to her. Anyone would assume you were full sisters, not half."

"Flattery won't work on me."

"That wasn't my intention. I merely meant it's astonishing, given your different mothers."

"I suppose our dear father possessed dominant genes." I mused, acknowledging her accuracy. When Julian noted the similarity between Athena and me, I assumed shared features like eyes or lips. The mirror-image shock upon meeting her was undeniable.

Brianna nodded, tucking a stray hair behind her ear. She was undeniably pretty, even with the scar above her full lips. I'd noticed that when she descended from the tree.

She remained a turned Lycan, implying her biter saw potential. Potential I had yet to witness.

"Why are you here, Brianna?"

A frown creased her brow as her eyebrows dipped lower. "I'm searching for my place in this world," she murmured. Her tone remained steady, her heartbeat rhythm unchanged. That's where lies truly revealed themselves.

"Athena despises me," she continued. "Zachary forbids me from leaving Obsidian Howl." Her chocolate brown eyes lifted to the darkening sky. "Sometimes I feel utterly trapped."

"Then simply leave."

"It's not that straightforward."

"Of course it is. You're not a Wolf. You hold no official pack status. You're a Lycan, and not even a pure one. You could depart whenever you wished. The real question is, why haven't you?"

She scowled. "My mate is within the pack."

Still, her heartbeat remained consistent. Either it was truth, or she was a master liar whose body believed the deception. Her gaze held steady.

"Has he claimed you?"

"No." She laughed softly to herself. "The entire pack barely tolerates me, him included, because of what I did to Athena years ago." She paused. "I'm certain Julian already briefed you on that."

He hadn't mentioned a mate, but he did explain her lack of welcome and the reasons behind it.

"Yet you remain alive."

"Only due to their fear of Zachary. And since Zachary is Isabella's mate, he maintains a presence at the pack house." She rocked on her heels. "I'm fairly certain that's my sole reason for survival. What about you? You've survived."

"Skills," I muttered.

"Once a Rogue," she retorted without hesitation. She nodded toward my house where Julian stood with his face pressed against the window.

"I was skilled long before turning Rogue. The pack—" Shit! I'd just made a colossal mistake. My desperation to uncover her lies made me careless with my own cover.

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

Think! I screamed internally.

"The last pack I resided with trained me. Probably similar to how Alexander trains everyone."

She nodded, and I draped an arm over her shoulders. She knew too much now. I would have to eliminate her.

"Why don't you come inside?"

"I would, but I'm scheduled for dinner with Zachary tonight. If I'm absent..."

"I understand. But five minutes won't cause any harm, will it?" I offered a reassuring smile.

I guided Brianna away from the dilapidated car and toward my home. Her shoulders tensed slightly, as if she sensed what was coming.

"Deep breaths, Brianna. I just want to talk further."
###Chapter 0247
Brianna

“Let’s talk outside. It’s nicer out here.” I dug my heels into the ground, trying to slow her down as she dragged me forward with an arm hooked around my shoulders. Her plan was obvious. She had messed up by mentioning her pack, and now I had to die for her mistake. It must be eating her alive if killing me is her only solution.

But she would not be the one to end me.

Her grip tightened, forcing me to move. “I’d rather have this conversation over some wine.”

“Sorry, I don’t drink.” I muttered, hooking my foot around the car tire. If she wanted to kill me, she could do it right here. Alexander said this was neutral ground. Killing me in the open would get her torn apart.

“Are you always this difficult?” She snarled, yanking me forward.

“I get it from my father.” I winked at her.

She snorted, completely missing the point. Or maybe Julian hadn’t told her that part.

“JULIAN!” She screamed at the top of her lungs, nearly deafening me. So much rage filled her voice. Was she angry at me? Herself? Or furious that Julian had been watching from the window without lifting a finger to help? Whatever it was, she was close to exploding. Or shifting.

Julian pulled the side door open. His dark eyes flickered between us as he tried to figure out what she wanted. Though it seemed pretty obvious. Or maybe, just maybe, he was stalling.

Maybe I could get through to Julian. It was a long shot, but I had to try.

“Idiot, grab her legs.”

Seriously? That’s how she talks to the man who claimed her.

He bent down to grab my legs, but my knee slammed into his eye. He yelled and stumbled back, making Seraphina scream at him again.

He wrestled with my legs, taking several hits to the groin and face before finally locking my legs under his arm.

They carried me inside and threw me onto a wooden chair, quickly tying my hands behind my back and my feet to the chair’s front legs. Child’s play. I expected more from Seraphina. Maybe she’d never held anyone hostage before. Maybe she was a kill-on-sight type. If that was the case, what was her real plan?

“I was wrong.” I muttered.

“Shut the fuck up!” She screeched at me.

“Athena doesn’t scream like a banshee.” I spat at her.

A hand struck my cheek. If I looked in a mirror, I’d probably see a perfect red handprint right before it faded as I healed.

“I’m going to slice you open, you little brat.”

“No, you can’t do that!” Julian stepped between us. There was hope.

“Get out of my way, Julian!”

“If you kill her, you’ll bring them all down on us. You may be an expert killer, but you can’t take on that many and survive. You’ll never get what you want. We’ll never get what we want.”

"They don't care about her."

"But one does. The one who is mated to my sister. That means she’ll say something to Alexander, and he’ll send the whole damn pack!"

She growled and shoved him aside anyway. The sharp edge of a knife sliced across my other cheek. Warm blood trickled from the cut down to my chin. She watched it heal before doing it again.

“You’re right.” She turned to Julian and pressed her lips against his. “For once, you’re right. I won’t kill her… Not yet.”

I laughed, and she pressed a stiletto between my thighs against the chair, pushing it back like she thought it would scare me. I’ve been in far scarier situations than this. It seemed to annoy her when I didn’t react, so she slammed a knife into my thigh, pinning it to the chair underneath as she laughed.

Okay. That hurt. But it was nothing I couldn’t heal from.

I stared into her shitty brown eyes. “Is that all you’ve got, Rogue?!”

She glared at me exactly like she did when I called her a Rogue at Obsidian Howl. She hated it. It was a reminder of a past she wanted to forget. A past that haunted her, just like it haunted the rest of us.

Spinning around, she grabbed a longer knife from the nearby table. This time Julian grabbed her, turning her away from me moments before she could plunge it into my other leg. “She won’t help us if you keep torturing her.”
###Chapter 0248

As if I would ever help them.

My loyalty belonged to my Alpha.

That vow would remain unbroken until my last breath.

“Let me speak to her.” He muttered lowly. “Take your wine. Go shower. She can listen to me fucking you all night.” His glare was pure venom.

Seriously?

It had been ages since I’d been intimate.

Now they wanted me to endure their twisted performance.

Total assholes!

Blair strutted away, snatching a bottle of wine from the shelf.

“She’s unhinged.” I whispered under my breath.

“What do you expect when you’re acting like a bitch!”

“You’re not the one held hostage here.”

His hand closed around the knife handle protruding from my left leg.

He yanked it out violently.

Blood sprayed across both of us.

The wound sealed quickly.

He repeated the process with the knife in my right leg.

“That’s going to piss her off.” I muttered.

“Enough!” He growled.

“Why? Why her?”

“Does it matter?” He shrugged.

“I think I deserve to know if you plan to kill me.”

He dragged a chair over and sat directly in front of me.

“No, you don’t.” He said flatly.

“What happened to you?” I kept my voice low.

Blair was probably listening.

I needed to choose my words with care.

“Did you choose her because of Athena? I’m sorry your life didn’t turn out as you hoped. I’m sorry a Rogue killed your mate.”

“Your kind is the reason she died.”

“And now you’re fucking one of us. An ex-Rogue, to be exact. That doesn’t bother you? Quite a twist, don’t you think?”

“Sometimes you can’t control who you fall for.”

“Because she looks like Athena.” He could deny it all he wanted. I’d never believe him. “She will destroy you, Julian.”

He rolled his dark eyes.

“Let me guess.” I looked him over. The sharp haircut. The expensive clothes. “She made you promises.”

“I know what she wants.”

“Do you, Julian? From what I see, she’s playing a game. A game like all the other Rogues. Only hers doesn’t end in a feast of flesh.” I had to make him see reason. “Or maybe it will.”

“She won’t kill me. She loves me.”

He called that love? She treated him like garbage. “Julian, I’ve seen a Rogue kill its own pup. You think claiming her will stop her from turning on you?”

He smirked. “Why are you really here, Brianna? To play games? What was it you said? ‘Takes one to know one.’” He stood and moved to the window. He peeked around the curtain, scanning the street. “Is he coming?”

“Scared?” I snorted.

He stormed toward me. His hand wrapped around my throat. “Is he fucking coming?!”

I shrugged. It only made him squeeze tighter.

I could see how far she’d dragged him down. He was beyond helping me.

“How would I know?!” I croaked out.

He sent my chair flying backward. Someone had developed a short temper.

I used those seconds on my back, hidden from his view, to link Athena.

We’d practiced all morning after I relayed last night’s intel.

My ability to hold a link with her was weak. Neither of us knew why.

I had to try. I was in over my head.

‘379 Oak street.’

That was all I managed before my chair was jerked upright.

I prayed she heard it.

His face was inches from mine. “Why haven’t you shifted?”

“I could ask you the same thing.”

“I know you can.” He continued. “I’ve seen it myself.”

“Do I need to? From what I recall, you freaked the fuck out when you saw me. Have you seen Blair’s Lycan?” They’d been together forever. He must have.

But he glanced away.

“You haven’t?” I was confused. She wasn’t living like a Rogue anymore. I knew she struggled with the darkness like Zachary and Athena. But to not shift at all? Something was wrong.

“Shut up!” He growled.

The perfect makeup. The flawless hair. Expensive clothes and shoes that would be ruined by shifting. She killed Gabriel with a gun, not her bare hands.

“She can’t, can she?”
###Chapter 0249
I shut off the shower.

Water drips from my hair as I squeeze it out.

I grab a towel and wrap it around my sore body.

That brat was fast.

She slipped out of my hold more than once before we finally got her pinned down.

The bitch was even more unpredictable than I thought.

She’s had practice escaping, whether as a Rogue or human.

I don’t care.

She will die.

It pissed me off that Julian stopped me from killing her.

But deep down, I knew he was right.

I don’t need Alexander and his Wolves showing up at my door.

I just want Daddy’s favorite.

I pour myself another glass of wine.

Pulling the door open, I’m ready with more questions.

But I’m met with silence.

A beautiful, perfect silence that makes me smile.

It lasts only a few seconds.

Then my feet move faster across the carpet.

A tiny panic echoes in my chest.

Did I miss Julian killing her?

No talking. No arguing.

I smile. He actually shut her up.

Sometimes Julian really gets what I need.

Too bad I missed it.

As I reach the main room door, my heart drops.

Silence was great until there’s no sound at all.

The happiness vanishes into a black hole.

Nothing.

No rustling of him cleaning up blood.

No movements.

No damn heartbeat I’d grown so used to.

“Julian?!”

I push the door open.

The chair Brianna was tied to lies on its back on the floor.

The ropes binding her legs are sliced open.

Sprays of blood splatter the floor and walls.

He helped her.

Why?

What did she say to him?

Does she know something I don’t?

‘Julian.’ I call through our link.

Nothing.

Empty.

The bastard is blocking me.

I follow their scents outside.

I don’t care that I’m only in a towel.

The rusty red car she called hers is gone.

Their scents end there.

My mate abandoned me.

No one abandons me.

My body trembles as rage tears through me.

A rage I haven’t felt in years.

It brings me to my knees.

Angry tears stream down my cheeks.

Why would he do this to me?

I let him claim me.

I let him into my life until I felt comfortable.

I gave him everything!

I will kill him.

My bones start to crack.

Shit, no, no, this can’t be happening.

I can’t stop it.

I never could.

Shooting pain rips through my spine.

I cry out as it spreads along my ribs and limbs.

The towel falls.

My body lengthens.

My skin blackens.

Claws form at the ends of my changing hands and feet.

A dark cloud drops over my mind as I rise.

Like it’s been waiting for this.

The life I knew disappears.

Fading into a distant memory.

I stare toward Alexander’s pack.

A growl rumbles deep inside me.

No one screws me over.

A gasp sounds behind me.

Then the click of a phone.

I turn my head over my shoulder.

A plump older woman walks a tiny dog.

The dog yaps and lunges.

The woman scoops it up, backing away.

She begs me not to hurt her.

She’s not my target.

I gesture with my head for her to run.

She spins in her flat shoes.

Half running, half wobbling, she tears down the path.

She doesn’t look back.

I watch her disappear.

My stomach rages at the thought of her juicy flesh.
###Chapter 0250

I ran my tongue over my teeth, tasting the lingering scent of blood in the air.

My focus narrowed on the direction of Obsidian Howl.

I started running.

Cars screeched to a halt as I flew past them.

Humans should hide from me.

But maybe it was time they learned about the monsters living among them.

Camera flashes lit up the night.

Screams echoed through the streets.

I should care about the exposure.

Knowledge of me meant knowledge of others.

That would give her more power.

My heart hammered against my ribs.

I refused to slow down.

I refused to stop.

Killing Rogues and other scum never gave me this feeling.

This was different.

A raw sense of freedom.

A deep desire awakening from within my core.

A hunger.

A hunger I hadn't felt in years.

An abandoned red car made me skid to a halt.

Miles away from Obsidian Howl.

The doors hung open.

One swung loosely, barely attached.

A flat tire slanted the vehicle awkwardly.

Smoke seeped from under the crumpled hood.

A massive dent suggested a violent collision.

The smell of blood made me drool.

I was so damn hungry.

It took less than a second to locate the source.

They had hit a deer.

I couldn't resist any longer.

My teeth tore into the flesh.

I buried my snout deep, ripping it apart effortlessly.

The meat slid down my throat perfectly.

The blood.

Oh, the blood.

I could bathe in it.

"Are you done?"

My eyes snapped up, another strip of meat hanging from my jaws.

Zachary stood there, arms folded across his broad chest.

Brianna hovered behind him.

My mate was nowhere.

Where the hell was Alexander?

I rose to my full height.

Zachary didn't flinch.

He didn't run screaming like the humans.

He stared, completely unafraid.

Why should he be?

He was just like me.

Another set of eyes peered from the dark trees to my left.

More to the right.

By the smell, even more behind me.

I still couldn't scent Alexander.

But I knew he wasn't dead.

That bastard had screwed me over.

I would gladly shove a knife through his heart for this betrayal.

"I asked you a question!" he snapped.

A deep, gargled laugh rumbled through me.

Why did they always think they could win?

I win.

I always win.

My stomach growled, demanding more.

The deer was delicious but insufficient.

It would never be enough.

"He's alive," Brianna muttered.

My eyes locked onto her.

"I had to knock him out, but he's breathing." Her gaze flicked to Zachary. "Probably not for much longer."

I was wrong.

He hadn't abandoned me.

She had gained the upper hand.

"I will kill you." I seethed, my focus entirely on her.

I bet she tasted good.

I would drain her dry.

Drink her blood like fine wine.

But I stood no chance now.

Too many surrounded me.

My time would come.

I would rip them apart.

Devour their flesh.

Take what should have been mine years ago.

I stepped back, eyes scanning the visible threats.

My ears and nose pinpointed the others' locations.

I needed to escape untouched.

There was a gap.

I moved fast.

My large frame slipped through before they could react.

Zachary called out to let me go.

Unexpected words from a Rogue.

It told me he had something far more sinister planned.


###Chapter 0252
Athena

I paced relentlessly outside the house after Alexander and Zachary left to find Brianna.
My stomach was in knots.
Alexander had been furious when I told him Brianna needed help.
Thankfully, the twins were fast asleep when Zachary returned.
He was dragging an unconscious Julian across the ground.
They were alone.
Which only made my anxiety spike.
He was heading toward the dungeons.

I ran to him.
"What happened?" I demanded.

"Brianna escaped," Zachary said, his voice tense. "There wasn't enough time for her to explain. I had to get him away."
He gestured toward Julian.
"The others stayed behind to see if she turned up."

"What did you do to him?"
"Nothing. He's been unconscious since we found Brianna dragging him into the forest. She crashed a car."

I followed him into the dungeon.
He didn't hesitate.
He tossed Julian into a cell.
Julian's body rolled across the stone floor.
It hit the back wall with a heavy thud.
It reminded me of when the same thing happened to Caleb.

Zachary turned to look at me.
His crimson eyes locked onto mine as he approached.
"You shouldn't have let her go alone."

"She already left. Yesterday. I didn't know until this morning."
"As soon as you found out, you should have told me, Athena. Maybe we could have planned for it. Handled it better than Brianna taking everything into her own hands."

He was annoyed.
I found myself nodding like a scolded child.
Certain things still triggered memories of my awful childhood.

"Is Seraphina alive?" I asked quietly, watching Julian.

"Yes, from what I've heard. She turned up in Lycan form."
His eyes glazed over.
"And they are back."
Zachary slammed the cell door shut.
He locked it with a deep frown etched on his face.

Alexander and Brianna were already inside the house when we returned.
"That was a fucking stupid idea, Brianna!" Alexander snapped at her. "Of all the reckless stunts you've pulled over the years, you just walked straight into the lion's den without backup!"

"I was just getting answers!" Brianna growled back. "And I'm alive. Aren't you grateful for that?!"

"Thanks to Athena." Alexander was glaring at Brianna when we entered the office.

"Really? It was alright for you to hunt your brother for a whole month with no word if you were okay? You couldn't even get off your high horse to contact anyone. Double fucking standards!"

"This has nothing to do with me!" Alexander snapped. "This is you trying to prove something. If you hadn't been able to link Athena, you would be dead."

"No, I wouldn't."

"And you know that for certain?"

Brianna rolled her eyes at him. "Yes, I do! Stop treating me like a child, Alexander. I've been doing this shit a lot longer than you have. Is it because I'm a woman? Is that it? You feel the need to save the fucking day."

"You know that's not what I mean." He shook his head at her.

"That's enough!" Zachary snapped over both of them. "Can we just be grateful that everyone is alive? Brianna, what happened?"

Brianna told us everything except how she escaped.

"Did he let you go?" Alexander quizzed.

She shook her head and puffed out her cheeks. "I had help."

"Who?"

"My mate."

We all looked at each other.
As far as we were aware, she had no mate.
She had no mark on her neck, so she hadn't been claimed either.

"Your mate?" Alexander pressed.

She quietly nodded but kept her eyes lowered. "He's a Wolf." She muttered. "But he isn't ready to tell anyone. Because… well, because everyone in the pack hates me."

"He's from my pack?" Zachary asked, glaring at Alexander.

She bobbed her head again. "When I linked Athena, it turned out I linked him too, but he was closer by. He was the one who knocked out Julian."

"Who?" Alexander snapped.

"I won't give you a name, Alexander. I respect his decision."

"You would only be able to link him if he claimed you," I muttered.

"I know." She lifted her top, showing us a mark on her stomach.
A really random place to have a mark.
Had he marked her there to keep his identity a secret?
None of us would have known if she hadn't told us.

"How long?" Alexander growled.

"A couple of weeks."

"You never said anything." Alexander was so irritated that Brianna had kept something from him. "And it still doesn't excuse the shit you pulled tonight."

"Okay, but can you just hear me out? When she was attempting to torture me, I kept pushing and pushing. She wouldn't shift, so I assumed that she couldn't. I pushed and pushed, expecting it to happen. When I questioned Julian for information, he spilled that Seraphina is afraid to shift."
###Chapter 0253

“Afraid?” Alexander’s gaze flickers toward me.

“Because she loses all control when she shifts.” Her eyes shift to Zachary. “We both know everyone battles their inner darkness differently.” She sighs. “But she did it anyway. We saw it. She consumed that deer I hit. Devoured it like it was some kind of drug.”

“And you still let her go.” Alexander shakes his head, annoyed.

“Because she will come for Julian.” Zachary tells him. “She’ll come here searching for him. He’s her mate. We can trap her. Hold her hostage. Discover what her plan is.”

“Or we could just kill her.” Alexander mutters. “What use is a plan if she’s already dead?”

Zachary nods in agreement. But I still needed answers. Answers I’d never get if they killed her.

“I need her alive.” I blurt out. Everyone’s eyes turn to me.

“Are you sure?” Alexander asks.

I nod. “She can’t be doing all this just because we share a father. That isn’t my fault. I believe there’s more to her story.”

“We can see what Julian knows.” Brianna suggests. “Where did you put him?”

“Dungeon.” Alexander answers sharply. He walks out of the office.

I follow him to the kitchen. He starts filling a bucket with cold water. Pure anger is etched on his face. He moves to the ice machine. He dumps ice into the cold water.

“Alexander….”

“We agreed no more secrets, Athena. I seem to be the only one honoring that.”

My heart drops. “I know… This wasn’t supposed to happen.” I already felt enough guilt without his reminder.

“I won’t lose you, Athena. The boys can’t lose you either.”

“I know.” I really hadn’t thought it through. “I just… I finally feel like I have some control over my choices. This isn’t how I thought tonight would go.”

He sighs and pulls me into his arms. He holds me tightly. “Come with me. Let’s try to get some answers from the bastard in my dungeons.”

He grabs the bucket of water. He hauls it out of the sink effortlessly.

“Why do you need that?”

“Something to help him wake up.”

Back in the dungeons, Julian is still unconscious. Alexander unlocks the cell. He steps in with the huge bucket of ice-cold water. He flings it all over him.

“FUUUUCCCCKKKK!!!” Julian jolts upright as Alexander steps out. He locks the door.

“Where the fuck am I?” Julian demands. His eyes struggle to focus. “Where is that bitch? Where’s Seraphina?”

“I don’t think you’re in any position to demand answers.” Alexander tells him. “What are you up to, Julian?!”

Julian bares his teeth at Alexander. As if that would scare him.

“You’ve tried to beat me multiple times. Believing you should be Alpha. You tried taking Sebastian out for the Beta position. You keep losing. So what do you want?”

“I did take Sebastian out the moment I fucked his girl!”

Alexander smirks and shakes his head. “Did you know the kids were yours?”

Julian’s eyes narrow. “Of course I did.”

“Gabriel killed them.”

He shrugs his shoulders at Alexander. Unbothered. Unphased.

“Seriously? They were yours and you don’t even care?” It bothered me. When I look at my boys, my heart swells with love. How can someone just not care?

“Natalie didn’t want me involved in their lives. She insisted your Beta believed they were his own. I thought he might have figured it out sooner.” He laughs to himself. “Idiot.”

“Bastard.” Alexander mutters.

Julian ignores him. He looks me up and down. “Was the Lycan right? Did your kids turn out to be Lycans too?”

Alexander sticks a hand out in front of me. A warning not to give him any information. Instead, I ask, “What are you and Seraphina up to?”

“You’ll find out soon enough.”

“Does it change things now that she’s shifted?” I ask. I want to annoy him as much as he annoys me.

A glimmer of fear flashes in his dark eyes. That fear quickly turns to anger before they glaze over.

“You can try linking her all you want, little brother. She’s too wrapped up in finding food to eat.”

“You’re wrong. She will burn this fucking place to the ground to find me.”
###Chapter 0254
Isabella

“Maybe I can get through to him.” I whisper to Midnight.

‘It won’t work. Julian is completely shutting me out.’

“You can link him?” I ask, surprised. She hadn’t mentioned anything.

‘Only since he arrived at the pack. It temporarily unlocked our connection. But he’s giving me nothing.’ She lets out a frustrated sigh. ‘Though facing him directly might force a response.’

Two days had passed since they brought him here. Alexander and Zachary took turns interrogating him, but neither got any answers. Alexander said it was like trying to squeeze water from a stone. The only reason they hadn’t resorted to torture was because I begged them not to.

A part of me still believed the kind brother I loved was trapped inside, buried under his grief for Sophia. I wondered if he had ever truly moved on.

I had been pleading to speak with him, just for a few minutes. But both my brother and my mate refused.

“They won’t allow it.” I tell Midnight. “There’s no way Alexander or Zachary will let me go down there.”

‘They aren’t the only ones in charge.’

“Midnight?!” Her response shocks me. She usually insists on following rules and obeying our Alpha. But her desperation to see her twin was consuming her.

“Talking to your Wolf again?” Zachary’s voice makes me jump as he enters our bedroom.

I need to be more careful when communicating with Midnight.

“Yes. She’s my Wolf.”

He moves behind me, wrapping his arms around my waist and pressing his face against my neck. His warm breath fans over my skin, igniting a fire within me. “You do realize I know you’re trying to find a way to see Julian.”

My cheeks flush with heat.

“We’re already avoiding torture because you asked. I know you think your brother is still in there, but…”

“But what?”

“He made his choice, Isabella. He chose to pair with someone instead of dealing with his grief.”

“You think he made a mistake? Claiming Seraphina.”

“I think he was in over his head. Seraphina offered him something he couldn’t refuse. And I know you think that too.”

“Maybe I can uncover the truth. Maybe seeing me will help. We’re twins, we have twin Wolves. He can’t ignore me.”

“I’ll speak with Alexander.”

“Thank you, that’s all I’m asking.”

“If he approves, you don’t go alone. I mean it Isabella.”

“I won’t be alone. I have Midnight.”

“What is it with you two?”

I raise an eyebrow, confused.

“Athena used the same phrase. But mentioned her Lycan.”

“Because it’s true.” I step out of his embrace and turn to face him. “Have you spoken to Brianna?”

Anger immediately flashes across his face.

“I know you’re angry, Zachary. But she followed Athena’s orders. You can’t stay mad at her for that.”

“She could have been killed.”

They hadn’t spoken since their argument. But he wasn’t truly angry about her following orders. It was the mate secret. He wanted to verify the details. Though it didn’t matter anymore – from what I heard, the guy had already claimed her. And since he was from our pack, it couldn’t be that bad.

“Should I be jealous that you’re so upset about her having a mate?” I wasn’t jealous. I knew he was just worried about his best friend.
###Chapter 0255

“Never.” He draws me against his solid frame. His mouth captures mine in a searing kiss. It’s desperate. Hungry. When he pulls back, my lips feel swollen. Aching for more. “It’s only you, Isabella. Always you.”

His gaze holds mine. It feels like he’s seeing straight into my soul. My heart hammers against my ribs. A deep, throbbing need coils tight low in my belly. His palm cups me through my shorts. His fingers move in a slow, deliberate circle. He can definitely feel how soaked I am.

“DADDY! Where are you?” Charlotte’s high-pitched shout cuts through the moment.

“Sorry.” His murmur is rough against my skin. “If that was an adult, I’d make them wait. I’d bend you over this sink and take you right now.”

“It’s fine. Go. I can handle this myself.” I give him a wicked grin.

His lips brush the sensitive spot just below my ear. “Don’t even think about it.” His teeth graze my earlobe in a warning.

But I make no promises. His idea of punishment is usually multiple, shattering orgasms until I’m completely spent. I’m not exactly going to protest that.

Zachary shuts the door behind him. My hand slips into my panties. My fingers trace slow circles above my clit. I imagine it’s his tongue.

A soft moan escapes me as I slide a finger between my slick folds. His voice instantly fills my mind. ‘I said don’t.’

It only makes the ache worse. ‘Then come and stop me.’ I shoot back through our link.

Silence.

Less than sixty seconds later, the door flies open. It nearly rips from its hinges.

He slams it shut with equal force. His eyes lock on me. The hard line of his cock strains against his jeans.

“What did I say?” His voice is a low growl. My own moans grow louder.

I try to maintain eye contact.

“Let me see.” It’s a command. His fingers hook into the waistband of my shorts and underwear. He yanks them down to my ankles. A deep, possessive sound rumbles in his chest at the sight of my glistening fingers.

“On the bed. Now.” He orders. “Don’t stop.”

I sit on the edge. He drops to his knees before me. He spreads my legs wide. His fingers skim the outer edges of my clit. A shudder of pure pleasure wracks my body.

He unzips his jeans. His freed cock stands thick and hard. He wraps a hand around himself, stroking slowly. His eyes never leave my working fingers.

“Oh, Zachary.” I mumble, biting back a scream.

His eyes flick up to mine. Then his tongue is on me. It flicks my clit with rapid, expert strokes. I keep fingering myself.

“Zachary!” My head falls back. My eyes roll. He suddenly pulls my fingers away. He drives his tongue deep inside me.

I fist my hands in his hair. I ride his face as my climax crashes over me.

I collapse back onto the bed with a breathless laugh. It turns into a sharp squeal. He sheathes his cock fully inside me in one brutal thrust.

He rocks his hips. He pulls my legs up over his shoulders. He leans forward. I’m curled so tightly I can watch him. I can see his slick length plunging in and out of me. My own juices glisten on him with every movement. It makes him drive into me harder.

“Fuck.” The word is a strangled gasp. It feels like he’s reaching my throat. Each thrust wrings a cry from my lips.

I begin to clench around him. He suddenly pulls out. He flips me onto my stomach before I can process it.

He slams back into me. Just as deep. Just as rough. My juices coat him. My pussy grips him tightly.

He leans over me, thrusting in short, sharp movements. Then he lifts me. He sits on the edge of the bed. He pulls me back onto his lap until I’m facing the large mirror.

His chest is against my back. His throbbing cock fills me completely. His hands play with my nipples. I let my head fall back against his shoulder. He thrusts up into me.
###Chapter 0256

“Oh.”

His fingers pinched my nipples with every thrust.

I started bouncing on his cock, taking control from him.

He groaned, his hands sliding up my thighs and stomach.

His dark eyes flickered between my body and our reflection in the mirror.

“So fucking tight!” he growled as I slammed down hard.

Zachary gritted his teeth, squeezing my breasts tightly.

I felt him swell even more inside me as my muscles clenched around him.

I threw my head back against his shoulder, riding out my orgasm.

He filled me completely with his release.

“You will get me into trouble,” he muttered, his lips grazing my ear.

“Then tell them we’re trying for a pup,” I whispered.

He gripped my face, turning me toward him.

Excitement and hesitation warred in his dark eyes. “I don’t want to lie.”

“It doesn’t have to be a lie,” I murmured before kissing him.

“Even with everything going on right now?”

I nodded. I’d been considering this for months.

Waiting for the perfect moment.

But there would never be a perfect time.

If Athena and Alexander could do it while being at the center of chaos, why couldn’t we?

I’d already seen how amazing he was with Charlotte.

He kissed me deeply. “Then no more playing with yourself unless I’m there.”

He winked and led me toward the shower. “Better go for round two.”

“I haven’t stopped birth control yet.”

He grinned mischievously. “There’s nothing wrong with a little practice.”

“One condition,” Alexander snapped at me. “You take me or your mate.”

I groaned. Zachary had warned me, but I didn’t think they’d actually enforce it.

“Why can’t I take Athena?” I protested.

“Athena is with the twins. She… needs to be with them.”

“Oh. Well, Brianna can come with me. Julian can’t reach us, and you have the key. We can’t get to him either. If that’s what you’re worried about.”

“Why does everything have to be a battle with you?”

“It’s not.” I shrugged.

Alexander propped his elbows on his desk, resting his chin on clasped hands.

His crimson eyes fixed on Zachary. “Fine. Take Brianna.”

“Seriously?” Zachary scoffed.

“She’s right. He can’t get out. They can’t get in.”

“Do I need to remind you that Gabriel escaped!”

“The bars have been narrowed since then. Besides, the idiot keeps shifting in and out of wolf form like a madman. Maybe his twin can get through to him. We’ve been trying for two days.”

I did a small fist pump in victory. I rarely won anything against Alexander.

He called Brianna to meet me.

She smiled at me but refused to look at my mate.

I didn’t understand why they were still arguing over who her mate was. It wasn’t any of our business.

“You want me to help?” Brianna asked in surprise when Alexander explained.

“You don’t have to do anything. Just ‘supervise.’” I made air quotes, ensuring both men saw.

I loved them both, but their lack of trust was frustrating.

“Sure. I can do that.”

Brianna followed me across to the dungeons.

We slipped down the stairs quietly.

Julian quickly became aware of my presence.

“Well, it’s about time, sis!”
###Chapter 0257
Isabella

His voice was so familiar.
Midnight lowered her guard instantly.
It sounded exactly like the Julian I knew.
My brother.
Not the insane monster everyone described.

I hadn't seen him since Sophia's death.
When Zachary spotted him on the street, the thought of facing him overwhelmed me.
I had fled to the car immediately.

I still didn't comprehend why he abandoned the pack.
I definitely didn't understand why he chose her.
The very thing he claimed to despise.

"Don't." I whispered, feeling my heart shatter anew.

"Don't what?" He spoke from the shadows of his cell. "Call you sister?"

I frowned, studying his weary, gaunt face.
He had been handsome once.
All the women adored him, hanging on his every word.
But now he looked drained and hollow.
Nothing like I imagined.
A mate bond should provide strength, yet his seemed to have drained him completely.

I glanced back at Brianna.
She remained silent, just as I requested.

"Why did you bring her? That stupid bitch is why I'm here." Julian growled.

Brianna rolled her eyes.
I turned back to my brother. "You're alive because of her and Alexander. Alexander brought you back."

"And threw me in the dungeons. Though he's made some improvements since I was last here." He laughed, his thin shoulders shaking with the sound.

Surely Alexander saw what I did.
Julian wasn't thinking clearly.
Something was terribly wrong.

'Aspen is weak.' Midnight murmured. 'The constant shifting has weakened him. Julian isn't allowing time for his bones to heal. It's like he's punishing himself.'

"What has she turned you into?" I asked, overwhelmed by sadness.

He spread his arms wide. "This is me, sis. I don't know who you're talking about."

"This isn't you. This isn't even a shell of you. You're not the brother I know and love."

He chuckled again. "Maybe my mate just showed me who I'm supposed to be."

"She's not your mate, Julian. She's just some whore you attached yourself to, and she's using you."

"Jealous?"

"Of you? How could anyone be jealous of you, Julian. I'll always care about you because you're my twin. But jealousy? You're on another planet if you think I'm jealous! Don't you care about me, Alexander, the pack?"

"No."

One word.
One single word that shattered everything around me.
He didn't hesitate.
He didn't pause to consider his answer.
It just tumbled out, final and absolute.

"She really means that much to you?"

"She's my mate."

"No she isn't. A mate isn't someone we choose. A mate isn't someone who forces us to do things we disagree with. A mate is chosen for us because they make us complete."

"Why would you think I disagree with her? I went to her, and she agreed to help me."

"With what?" Brianna muttered.

I glared at her, and she pretended to zip her lips shut.

"It's insane that you act like she belongs in the pack." Julian mused. "It's insane that you let them infiltrate our way of life."

"You marked a Lycan! Why is it okay for you but not for us?"

He rolled his dark eyes. "Oh Isabella!"

'He's completely lost it.' Midnight murmured.

"I'm guessing she wants to kill Athena, and you want to destroy our pack because you blame us for your stupid moves! But if you don't believe in pack life, what's the fucking point?"

"What did you hope for, Isabella? That you'd come down here and find a way to save me? You're the one who needs your eyes opened."

I moved to the wooden chair and sat down.
Brianna leaned against the wall.
She picked at her fingernails, pretending to lose interest in Julian's words.

"Do you have something to say?" I muttered.

She frowned, raising her eyes to meet mine.
The look clearly said I had told her to be quiet, so that's what she was doing.

I gestured for her to speak.

Brianna straightened her back.
She stepped forward into Julian's direct line of sight.
He growled immediately, but it didn't stop her.

"I'm confused." She shrugged. "I heard you tell Seraphina that you could use me. That you could gain information from me. Isn't that why you kept me alive? She was ready to kill me, and you stopped her. Why?"

"Fuck off!" Julian growled.

"Anyone would think you had a soft spot for me. Yet here you are, acting like I'm the world's worst villain."
###Chapter 0258

“You deceitful creature!”

“So this was your game? Lure me into your pathetic little group?”

“Get lost, you filthy Lycan.”

“That’s what confuses me.” Brianna grips the bars, staring him down. “You were involved with a Lycan too. Sophia was a Lycan. Your actual fated mate. Did you call her filthy? If I recall correctly, she was turned, just like me!”

He remains silent.

“Exactly!” Brianna mutters. “Athena’s double convinced you we’re tainted because we’re not purebloods.”

“Shut your mouth, you impure wretch!” Julian snarls.

His bones begin to crack.

We watch him transform into his Wolf.

He paces the cramped cell, inching closer to the bars. Brianna pulls her hands away just as he swipes at them.

She laughs, mirroring his pacing.

She moves back and forth outside his cell, matching his rhythm perfectly.

It infuriates my brother. He always hated being mimicked. Some things never change.

“She’s poisoned your mind, Julian.” I say from the chair. “She made promises she can’t keep. Women like her only care about themselves.”

I was running out of options. This wasn’t going as planned.

‘He’s destroying Aspen.’ Midnight whispers, her voice filled with pain. ‘He’s forcing the shift to crush Aspen’s will.’

‘What? Is that even possible?’

‘It’s his last connection to us. If Aspen breaks, it’s over.’

“Julian, please explain why?” I try to hide my sorrow, but my expression betrays me. I feel like I’m losing him all over again.

The Wolf paces relentlessly.

Every few seconds, he slams against the bars, hoping they’ll give way.

He shifts back to human form, tying his shirt around his waist. His ribs are visible. His collarbone protrudes sharply. His skin looks stretched too tight. I’m certain his spine would be clearly visible if he turned. He’s painfully thin. Even Brianna steps back, realizing how ill he appears.

The tailored suit had hidden it well.

“Is she starving you?” I ask, shocked. Julian always had a huge appetite, just like me.

“Don’t be ridiculous. I love her. You’ll all pay for holding me captive.”

Brianna turns to me. Her brows furrow. “I think she’s been holding him hostage.”

“That can’t be. He marked her.”

“Maybe that’s when things changed.” She signals for us to leave the dungeon.

“The first night I went there, he was outside the house. He questioned why I was there. Claimed Seraphina wasn’t home, but her car was there. The other night, he was watching from a window. She had to call him to help with me because he wouldn’t come out. Even then, he seemed unsure what to do.”

She frowns. “For someone who leads wars, he sure struggled to restrain me.” Her mind works faster than mine, piecing things together.

“What?”

“Isabella, humans lose their minds for various reasons. Trust me, I’ve seen it with my father and everyone he encountered. Rogues do the same.”

“He’s not a Rogue!” I mutter.

“Not him. Her. She called him degrading names, and he obeyed her every command.”

“That doesn’t sound like him.”

“You saw what I saw. He hasn’t eaten properly in weeks. When she arrived here, Julian was in the car. Honestly, he looked terrified. He didn’t want to be here.”

“That doesn’t explain why he’s being so hostile now.” I mutter.

“Doesn’t it? What if he knows she’s listening?” She shakes her head. “There was a moment before… before my mate arrived, where I thought Julian might let me go. He removed the knives she used to pin me to the chair. He sent her away to shower.”

“Slow torture. We’ve seen Athena do it.”

“He didn’t hurt me again, Isabella. He’s called me many names, but ‘filthy’ is new.”

“He’s angry. He can be cruel when he’s angry. As his sister, I apologize.”

She dismisses my apology. “I think he might be trapped and in way over his head.”
###Chapter 0259

Alexander.

“You see it too, don’t you? You have to. You’re his brother. His Alpha.” Isabella leans heavily on my desk, dark eyes burning into mine. Zachary stands behind her, hands resting on her hips in a calming gesture.

“Which is it? It can’t be both. He can’t be trapped and trying to kill his own Wolf’s spirit.”

“What if it is both?” Brianna speaks up from the corner chair. She rises, tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear. Her brow furrows deeply. “Like some twisted cry for help. He knows his Wolf and Isabella’s are twins. Maybe this is his way of asking. Maybe he’s doing it so Seraphina remains unaware.”

“Yes!” Isabella jabs a finger toward Brianna while glaring at me. “That’s exactly what I mean.”

“Isabella…” Zachary begins.

“No. I love you, Zachary, but I’m not giving up on him. My gut says this is wrong. He’s skin and bones. His speech is off, yet he uses familiar phrases. Even his laugh is different.” She turns her pleading eyes back to me.

“Julian chose to mark her.”

“It’s not like you’ve never made a mistake. Remember all those women you dragged into contracts before Athena came along?” She slams her palm on the desk. “What if things changed after that?”

I see Zachary raise an eyebrow in my direction.

I lean back in my chair, studying her. She’s begged me for many things over the years. But never like this.

“You’re the Alpha.” Zachary mutters. “Your call.”

My brother has caused endless problems. I’ve bailed him out countless times. For years I tolerated his excuses. I let them slide until my mate entered my life. Even now, he’s still digging himself into holes. He’s learned nothing.

“He’s hurt too many people.”

Tears stream down Isabella’s face. “You promised. You promised to look after us. You promised mum and dad.”

“Isabella, he’s not a child anymore. He hasn’t been one for a long time. Some decisions haunt us forever.”

“So you’re giving up?”

I sigh, crossing my arms over my chest.

“She’s killing him. I don’t know how, but she’s killing him.” She shakes off Zachary’s hands and storms out. He follows as she stomps up the stairs. Multiple doors slam shut above us.

“She loves him.” Brianna murmurs.

“I know. He’s her brother.”

“He’s more than that.” She frowns. “I know it’s complicated. I know you’ll probably tell me to stay out of it. But you must see it. He should have woken long before you threw him in the dungeon. Wolves heal fast. Those with Alpha blood heal even faster. But he didn’t. That’s weird on its own.”

She blows out a breath. “I’m a watcher, Alexander. I observe people. I learn how they operate, how they hide things. It’s what I’m good at. Most of the time.”

“Most of the time?”

“Yeah. Though trying to read Athena is like searching for a needle in a haystack.”

I laugh. That much is true.

“Something doesn’t add up.”

“You took her mate. That’s why she shifted.”

She raises a brow. “I don’t think so.”

“Zachary said you pushed her.”

“She had already shifted long before that. Probably the moment she realized that I… That I put Julian in the car.”

I cock a brow at her. She’s trying hard to keep her mate’s identity secret. Though I’m fairly certain I know who it is.

“I already know you had help, Brianna. Honestly, I don’t care who you’re mated to as long as you don’t try to kill him.”

“What if he tries to kill me?”

“Has he?”

She scrunches her face like she’s said too much.

“Is that how you ended up with the mark on your stomach and not your neck?”

She nods. “He ignored it for a while. Then he snapped. He attacked. Somewhere in the struggle, he claimed me.”
###Chapter 0260

“What’s your take on this?” She wouldn’t be the first unwillingly marked.

Brianna just shrugs.
“We’re handling it. Either way, I know it’s not my place to ask.
But just… hold off on killing Julian for a bit. Let me figure things out. If I can’t find anything, do what you must.”

“You’re right. It isn’t your place.” Truth is, I didn’t want him dead either.
“Forty-eight hours, Brianna. That’s all you get.”

“Forty-eight hours,” she repeats, turning toward the door.

“Give my regards to Sebastian.”

She spins back, eyes wide. “I didn’t say a word.”

“Didn’t have to. He was supposed to be at your rescue. Turns out he’d already left the pack.
Thank the moon he wasn’t off buying more liquor.”

“I told you I wouldn’t talk.” Her words come out rushed.

“And you didn’t. Just answer me this—is he still drinking?”

She shakes her head.

“Good. Forty-eight hours,” I mutter.
She hurries out.

I sigh, swiveling my chair toward the window.
How did it come to this with Julian?
Father would’ve been furious.
I feel like I’ve failed him.
Failed my parents.

Julian and Isabella were raised the same.
Same rules, same expectations.
Isabella followed them. He never did.
Always causing trouble.
But this time… this time he went too far.
He might have cost me my family.

Athena slips into the office.
Her scent washes over me, erasing all others.
She stays quiet. Waiting. Sensing my rage.

“You heard everything?”

“I was on the stairs. Zachary and Isabella are arguing. Brianna ran out—didn’t even see me.”
She pauses. Her heartbeat is barely audible.
“Forty-eight hours isn’t long, Alexander. You gave me more time.”

“You were terrified. You needed to adjust. You weren’t plotting to kill us.”

She moves in front of me, blocking the window, and settles on my lap.
Her arms wrap around my waist. She rests her head on my chest.
“You know your brother better than anyone. He’s stood by you in wars. Helped you secure alliances.
Brianna said something’s off. Did he really give you nothing during interrogation?”

“All he mentioned was me bringing the Lycans here.
I can’t force answers—I’m not his Alpha anymore.
I’ll give Brianna the forty-eight hours. Then I decide.”

She nods slowly. “And if Seraphina shows up?”

“Seraphina can be killed. Honestly, I’m surprised she hasn’t appeared yet.
It’s been days. No reports from the guards.”

“Like Isabella says—no news is good news.”

“Usually, yes. But not when we’re waiting for her to attack. Where are the boys?”

“Asleep. It’s late.” She gestures toward the dark sky.

“Stay here. I need to question my brother again.”

She nods and slides off.
I leave her in the office and head back to the dungeon.

Julian is in wolf form.
Lying on his side, struggling to breathe.
Brianna was right. He’s trying to kill his wolf spirit.

“Look at me,” I command.

He doesn’t move.

“Look at me, Julian!”

His body begins shifting back.
It’s slow. Agonizing. As if it’s draining his last ounce of strength.
A bloodcurdling scream tears from him as his spine snaps into place.
He collapses on the floor. Panting. Screaming with every breaking bone.

I’ve inflicted pain. Delivered cruel punishments.
But this is horrific. And it’s not even by my hand.

“She’s coming,” he mutters before passing out.
###Chapter 0261
Alexander

I grab a bottle of water and splash it over his motionless form. Julian groans weakly but doesn't stir.

"Get up now." I command.

Another groan escapes him, followed by slight movement. He lifts his hand and flips me off. Whether it was for the water or my presence, I couldn't tell.

"What do you mean she's coming?" I snap. My patience had worn dangerously thin.

"She's coming for me." His voice comes out as a ragged croak.

"Is that what you want?"

He remains silent.

I was accustomed to silent treatment from my sister. But not from Julian. He wouldn't recognize silence if it slapped him across the face.

Even during interrogations, he never gave us useful information about them. But that never stopped him from making every possible sarcastic remark.

His eyes flutter open, staring up at me from the cold floor. "I... messed up, Alexander." He breathes the words out painfully.

His breathing sounds hollow and strained. I had a feeling he wasn't just killing his wolf.

Our wolves are part of our very essence. Created from the Alpha blood that flows through our veins. Trying to kill Aspen's spirit was like trying to destroy himself.

"What does she want?"

His gaunt face stares back at me. Isabella was right - I had been too focused on punishing him to notice how ill he looked. He appeared to have one foot already in death's door.

"I can help you Julian, but you need to give me the information I require."

He rolls onto his back, eyes fixed on the ceiling as he presses a hand to his chest. "It's fading. Aspen is gone."

His chest barely rises when he attempts to take a deep breath. The effort sends him into a coughing fit.

"Athena." He chokes out.

"I know, but what does she want from Athena?"

He turns his face toward me. "Everything. Her life... her power... her family."

His lips still. His chest stops moving.

I won't let this happen. I quickly unlock his cell, linking Isabella to come immediately as I slam my fist over his heart. I hear his ribs crack, but that doesn't matter now.

Pressing my ear to his chest, I hear nothing and begin compressions.

Isabella and Zachary burst through the door just as Julian's heart begins beating again. But it remains weak, barely holding on.

Theodore arrives moments later with medical supplies from the hospital. Isabella nearly snatches them from his hands. She orders everyone back while she works, only allowing Theodore to pass her specific items.

We watch her inject Julian with multiple medications. She forces a tube down his throat attached to a bag, instructing Theodore to squeeze it at a steady pace. She might be scattered sometimes, but when it comes to medical emergencies, she knows exactly what she's doing.

"He needs hospital care." She mutters. "Immediately."

Zachary and Theodore move him as she stands. Her dark eyes meet mine. "You didn't let him die." She whispers as the men disappear.

"No, but Aspen..." I had to tell her.

"I know. Midnight is struggling. Can he survive this?"

I didn't have an answer for her.

"Go, keep him alive." I tell her. She throws her arms around me briefly. "Don't worry, Alexander. This is what I do best." She heads toward the steps. "I'll let you know when you can visit."

"I'll be at home, making preparations."

"Preparations?"

"Before he lost consciousness, he said she was coming." I see her hesitation. The last Rogue she dealt with was Gabriel, and he left her with lifelong scars. She's a healer, not a fighter. "Keep Zachary and Theodore close."

"Zachary is your Beta." She says nervously.

"It's fine. He's also your mate."

She nods and hurries up the remaining steps.

In the office, I find Sebastian. He stands before my desk, hands in his pockets.

"Sebastian." I say, surprised.

"Alexander." He dips his head in acknowledgment.

When I take my seat, he moves to the door and closes it with a sigh. "You figured it out." He murmurs, avoiding eye contact. "She told me."

"Secrets rarely stay hidden from me. Besides, there were obvious signs. You marked her."

"It wasn't planned. I was drunk. She made some comments and mentioned she might leave the pack."

"Because of Athena?"

He nods. "I lost control. I still don't know what came over me."

"That's exactly how I feel when something threatens Athena. What about Natalie?"

"She was never my true mate, was she? We got together as children, long before we could even shift. We stayed together because of the boys. Boys who weren't even mine. If she had been my true mate, she would have died from what she did with Julian. Just like you almost killed Athena by kissing her."
###Chapter 0262

He shook his head. “Honestly, I despised the idea of Brianna being my mate. I fought it every step of the way. Yet I could never bring myself to reject her. She kept showing up, making sure I wasn’t drinking. Even when I told her to get lost, she came back. Eventually, I found myself watching her. I can see her front door from my kitchen window. Every evening, she does the same thing. Sits outside with a mug of tea. Just watches.”

Now I understood what Brianna meant when she said she liked to watch.

“A few nights ago, she broke her routine. I followed her scent into the forest. I overheard her mind-link—it wasn’t meant for me. My heart dropped when I realized she was in danger.”

“The mate bond does that to you. You knocked Julian out?”

“Yes. But he wasn’t himself. He didn’t wake up like I expected.”

“He’s in the hospital. Fighting for his life,” I muttered.

“It’s that serious?”

“Yes.”

“Brianna filled me in. I know I’m not your Beta anymore, but she kept me updated. I want to help if I can.”

“Where is she now?”

“I think Athena is letting her see the twins.”

That surprised me more than anything. Athena had outright refused to let Brianna near them until now.

“Have you really quit drinking?”

I couldn’t smell a drop on him. “A couple of weeks.” That matched what Brianna had told me. “I’m in a much better place now.”

I imagined Brianna had a lot to do with that.

“Good. I need a second Beta.” He raised an eyebrow. “Zachary is a great Beta, but he hasn’t taken the blood oath yet. It makes sharing information with the pack difficult. You could do that, just like before. But you’ll be working alongside Zachary.”

“Of course. Where do you need me?”

I filled him in on the little Julian had said before he collapsed.

Sebastian smiled slightly. “Brianna is smart.”

“Much wiser than any of us gave her credit for.”

He nodded. “I’ll speak to the guards. Set up a new rotation. Upgrade training again, I suppose.”

“Include weapons training. From what I’ve heard, Seraphina is well-trained. It might throw her off.”

He left, and I headed upstairs to the nursery. Logan and Evrin were staring at Brianna in amazement as she played peekaboo with them. They giggled every time she ‘reappeared’.

Charlotte was sitting on Athena’s lap, whispering something almost directly into her ear.

“You know where the snack box is,” Athena murmured back with a smile.

Charlotte had been with us for a while, but she still asked permission for almost everything. Still afraid of being told ‘no’ or going hungry. It tugged at Athena’s heart because of her own past. She always kept the snack box stocked with Charlotte’s favorites and never said no.

She skipped past me toward the stairs, but Athena’s eyes were on me. “What happened?”

“Julian is in the hospital.”

“Wait,” Brianna muttered. “You were going to give me forty-eight hours.”

“Turns out he didn’t have that left,” I sighed. “The forced shift killed his wolf. Julian died with him. We restarted his heart, but it doesn’t look good.”

“Can he survive that? I thought only Alpha blood carries an extra spirit?”

“I don’t know. But you were right, Brianna. He said he messed up. His stubbornness to ask for help means we might be too late. Isabella is doing what she can.”

The twins were oblivious to our conversation, tugging on Brianna’s sleeves to keep playing. She forced a smile and continued playing as she asked what we were going to do.

I repeated the same plan I had told Sebastian.

“Is she really coming?” Athena asked quietly.

“I don’t know. But it felt like a warning.”

“Don’t let the darkness in now, Athena,” Brianna warned. “That might be exactly what she’s looking for.” She turned to me. “We need to find more Lycans.”
###Chapter 0263
Athena

“We’re aware there are more out there, but time isn’t on our side!” Alexander snaps at Brianna. “She could already be here. Watching us.”

The twins have gone quiet, staring up at their father. Since they became aware of their surroundings, they’ve always sensed his anger. It never made them cry. It fascinated them.

“WE don’t need to do anything.” Brianna mutters, turning her gaze to me. “You do.”

“Right.” I let out a bitter laugh. “Last time I tried speaking to Lycans, they were the bitten ones. The marked. And you struggled to link with me.”

“Something is holding you back.” She shrugs.

“I know. The darkness inside me.” My tone drips with sarcasm.

“No. You.” She points directly at me. “I thought it was Nyx blocking me.”

‘Not me.’ Nyx grumbles, annoyed.

“Now I believe it’s you. You’ve been so focused on fighting the darkness that you’re shutting out your natural bloodborn gift.”

“It didn’t work with Gabriel or Seraphina.”

“Neither was present when Victoria targeted you. But what began then is what you battle daily. I think it’s connected, but it’s not the barrier.”

“I’ve accepted who I am.” I say defensively.

“Much has changed since then.” Alexander’s eyes lock on mine.

“Athena, you are the last female Alpha. A descendant of Aldous Harrison. Every Lycan in this world belongs to you. Rogue or not. If it’s true there are more, you must find a way to link them. To bring them here.”

“What if I bring more trouble to our pack? What if they hate me? What if they reject having an Alpha? I understand what you’re saying, Brianna, but the twins.” I glance at Alexander, who is now making funny faces at the boys in his arms. "I can't risk their safety."

“You would be doing this for them. And if anyone tries to cross us, we will unleash hell.”

I study her. Less than a week ago, she claimed she’d gladly give up being a Lycan. Perhaps the chance to belong has changed her mind.

My eyes meet familiar crimson ones. He stays silent, just watching me. His look says the decision is mine. Sometimes, I prefer when he makes the choice. The last time I decided, Brianna almost died.

I look at my sons, safe in his arms. They are oblivious to our world. Unaware of what they were born into. My only goal is to give them the best life possible. Because as much as I am the last female Alpha, they are future Lycan Alphas. Destined to rule both Lycans and Wolves.

“If I figure this out, Seraphina will likely seek the others out. Try to sway them to her side. What if she succeeds?”

“I have an idea, but it’s extreme. We’ll need Isabella’s agreement.” Brianna tells us.

“What is it?”

“We ask them if they would die for you.”

“How does that prove anything? They could lie.” Alexander questions.

“We administer Wolfsbane Toxin.”

“WHAT?” I nearly died from that poison. Isabella barely saved me. Without the antidote from the Witch, I wouldn’t be here. I still see my parents’ blood-soaked faces in my nightmares.

“Because Isabella knows how to make the antidote.” Alexander nods, ignoring my reaction.

Brianna agrees.

“Am I the only one who sees a flaw? Suppose we do it. Then word gets out we have the antidote. That it’s just a test.”

“You order them not to tell anyone. Athena, I think you sometimes forget the power of an Alpha’s command.” Alexander states firmly.

“I won’t poison them. I’m sorry. There has to be another way.”

Silence falls as Charlotte skips back into the room, holding a bag of popcorn. “Do you know where Daddy is?”
###Chapter 0264

"He's busy, but he'll return shortly." Alexander grins at her and snatches a piece of her popcorn.

"Is it because he's a very important man?" Charlotte asks, pouting.

"He is. When you're older, you'll understand why."

"Okay." She scrambles up onto the window seat and presses her face against the glass, searching for Zachary.

She frowns when she can't spot him.

"Brianna, can you stay with the children while I speak with my mate?" Alexander requests.

"Of course. I adore kids."

I wince when she refers to herself as Auntie Brianna and informs them she'll be staying longer. But I don't have time to correct her because Alexander is already pulling me out of the room.

"I know you hate this idea, but I believe she's onto something. I also understand it's triggering awful memories. However, it will be the fastest method to eliminate the threats. To identify who is truly loyal to you."

"I can't do it." Even discussing killing so many people made me restless. I needed to find a way to purge this darkness. I couldn't continue living like this, constantly fearing its resurgence.

"You can't cultivate it anyway. At least, I don't believe you can. It requires wolf blood."

He begins outlining a plan. Talking about growing it in a secure location inaccessible to children.

Part of me despised the idea, but something deep within me stirred with pleasure at the thought of more deaths. I loathed this encroaching darkness.

While Alexander checks on Julian, Brianna sits on the floor across from me. We had been communicating through mind link, each connection growing clearer and stronger.

'Explain how you linked everyone before?' Her high-pitched voice echoes inside my head.

'I'm uncertain. I was hiding with Sophia. She made me feel capable, and it just occurred.'

'No, there's more to it. Linking that many simultaneously requires immense power and strength. Qualities you already possess. But something is currently blocking you.'

'I suppose I wanted to protect those I care about. Sophia was like a younger sister. We were navigating our new realities together. She was newly bitten, I was newly unbound. But I didn't harbor this darkness then. And the twins help maintain my mental clarity."

"I'm not suggesting you need to shift. You've accepted your position, correct? Now it's time to truly believe in it. Believe that you are an exceptionally powerful female Alpha. You've survived being bound four times. That alone proves you're more than just any Alpha. So tap into that strength!"

"Stop commanding me! Stop talking. I need to think!" The words emerge in a strange, distorted tone. A voice that doesn't belong to Nyx.

Brianna stares at me with wide brown eyes, frantically patting her throat. "What's wrong? Are you having breathing difficulties?" I panic as she continues pointing at me, then at her own throat. Her mouth moves but produces no sound.

Footsteps approach rapidly. The last person I expected to see was Sebastian. "You've ordered her to remain silent." He informs me.

"What? No, I didn't. How would you know that? You weren't even present."

"She linked me."

"I don't understand how I did it. How did she link you? She's a Lycan. Wait, you're her mate?"

"Yes," he turns his head toward Brianna, then back to me. Frowning, he adds, "Mal mentioned it happens when you're agitated."

"You were agitated about ensuring Sophia's safety." I know he's merely repeating her words, but it feels peculiar.

"You were agitated because she was analyzing you. You're agitated about making decisions."

"So how do I reverse it?" Alexander needed to provide more explanation about the Alpha command.

"Simply tell her she can speak again."

"Just like that?"

"Just like that." He winks at me. I had missed Sebastian; he was完全不同 when he drank.

"You can speak." I mutter to Brianna.

"And I've just solved your problem." She smiles at me.
###Chapter 0265
Brianna

“She isn’t angry,” Sebastian says as he escorts me home. “Remember, she hasn’t been a Lycan for long. Everything is still new to her.”

“I know. They lied and told her she was a Wolf.” They made sure I never forgot that. But she also needed to understand her past doesn’t control her future.

“It’s deeper than that. Imagine being deceived your whole life. Thrown into a world you know nothing about. Having everything stripped away. From my perspective, she’s handling it incredibly well.”

I smirk. “Theodore said something similar.”

“He’s not wrong. She’s completely different from who she used to be.”

“You think she’s frustrated?”

He nods with a sad smile. “Frustrated with herself. Trust me, you’d know if she was truly angry. Everything’s a learning process. Not everyone adapts quickly. I’ve seen her command hundreds of Lycans—bitten and pureblood—to bring her their leader. She’s capable.”

“Okay, but time isn’t on our side.”

“You don’t know that. Seraphina showed up once and then vanished for months.”

I frown. My gut tells me we don’t have months. “Why were you at the house earlier?”

“I was speaking with Alexander.”

“And?”

“He asked me to serve as a second Beta.”

“Alongside Zachary?”

“Yes. I agreed. I need some normalcy back.”

We stop outside my house. The light catches his eyes. They’re beautiful, shifting color with the sun. Right now they’re aquamarine. If he turns, they glow like honey. Strange and captivating.

“Not tonight. I have to work.”

“Right.” I try to hide my disappointment. He can feel it. But he stays silent, and that irritates me.

He kisses my forehead and turns to leave, saying he’ll see me in the morning.

We slept together the day he marked me. And again during my heat. That was when Athena thought I was avoiding her. In reality, I was in bed with Sebastian, experiencing the most intense orgasms of my life. The mate bond must amplify everything.

Since then, only a few kisses. My body aches to pin him down. Our time together is limited. One moment he wants me close, the next he tells me to go.

Now, only two reasons keep me here. At least that’s double from last time.

I make tea and step outside, settling on the stones of my small porch. Tonight, I’m not people-watching.

Theodore lent me an old laptop. I’m determined to find something about other Lycans.

I’m not sure what I’m looking for. Maybe strange sightings. Animal-related deaths. I might as well use my mind since my body’s not getting any action tonight.

The pack grounds grow quieter. Darkness falls. I’ve refilled my cup three times and found nothing. I should’ve expected it. We hid our location while protecting the Rogues. Theodore mentioned Lycans going into hiding because of this Aldous Harrison.

Humans are naive about what happens around them. Those war stories are just myths to them. Unless someone pulls you in, like Victoria.

Just as I’m about to give up, I find a story from twenty years ago. A teenager saving a woman from a monstrous beast.
###Chapter 0266

It was enormous. Possibly seven feet tall. But it appeared partly wolf and partly man. The details were sparse but sufficient for our purposes.

The brief text mentioned the woman survived after six weeks in the hospital recovering from severe traumatic injuries.

"That's all?" I snap, frustrated by the lack of information. Nothing about claw marks or peeled skin.

I scroll down the page only to find conspiracy theory comments or suggestions that the couple were high on drugs. But I know you never forget witnessing something like that.

I needed to show Theodore. He was skilled at uncovering such information.

Unplugging the laptop, I rush over to his house, relieved to see lights still on inside. "You can track people down, right?" I blurt out when he opens the door.

"That depends on how much information you have."

I push past him and set the laptop on his table harder than intended, cursing myself since it wasn't mine.

"I've been searching for Lycan signs."

He smirks and moves to his new laptop at the table's end. He spins it around to face me. It's on the exact same page I was viewing. Only he had a map beside him with circles drawn all over it.

"Do you know why this one stands out?" He points at the screen.

I shake my head.

"It's an unusual first name for a human. But common among wolves."

I hadn't even noticed the name. 'Lucas Adler.' He was right, I'd never encountered that name among humans, and there were six in this pack alone.

"You think he's a Wolf?"

He nods at me. "Maybe he can provide more information."

I consider that if I leave the pack without informing Alexander, he'll explode again, especially with Seraphina lurking out there.

My eyes return to the image on the screen. He's smiling but it doesn't reach his hazel eyes. What if Theodore is onto something and we miss this opportunity?

"Do you think he's in a pack?" I ask.

"No. There are no packs located where this article originated. It's human territory which means if he is a Wolf, he was likely exiled from his pack."

"Exiled as a teenager?"

"Or abandoned." Theodore mutters.

"And that's if he's still there, the article is twenty years old. There's no guarantee we'll find him."

He hands me a blue post-it note. "He's there. Up for a road trip?"

"I'm already in trouble over the Seraphina incident." I protest. He nods and takes the post-it back. "You're going alone?"

"Someone needs to gather more intel, even if it's a dead end."

He moves around, stuffing snacks and water bottles into a duffle bag. But no clothes.

"How long will you be gone?"

"It's a two hour drive. I'll be back before sunrise." He slings the bag over his shoulder and grabs his laptop and map. "No need to cover for me."

I follow Theodore outside to a running car, only to find Sebastian in the driver's seat. Sebastian's eyes lock with mine. "Get in."

"You knew." I mutter, climbing into the back. "Is that why you blew me off again?" I yank the seatbelt around me, jamming the buckle into its lock with too much force. "Alexander is going to be furious that we're doing this!"

"Already cleared." He mutters back, watching me in the rearview mirror.

Theodore gets in the passenger seat and quickly programs the satnav with the details.

The journey was tedious. I hated not being the one driving. I hated that they were having a conversation that excluded me.

"Athena," Sebastian says as he stares straight ahead. If anyone else called me that, I'd tear their throat out, but it had become his thing and I liked how it sounded in his voice. "You might have to shift."
###Chapter 0267

"Is that wise, given his alleged sighting?"

"We may have to persuade him that his vision was real." Theodore murmurs.

"Alternatively, if he's truly a Wolf," Sebastian adds, "He ought to understand the world holds greater mysteries."

"Fine."

We eventually stopped before a sizable house. It required some minor repairs in places, but overall, it was far from what I had anticipated. I checked the dashboard clock. It was nearly midnight. Crucially, the house was completely dark.

Movement flickered in my peripheral vision. A black Wolf emerged cautiously at the front of the house. Its shoulders were hunched, head held low, scrutinizing us. It sniffed the air and retreated the way it came.

I didn't wait for the men. I followed the Wolf.

Rounding the corner to the back of the house, I froze. A shotgun was pressed firmly against my forehead.

Holding it was a man around thirty-five. He was barefoot, wearing only low-slung shorts. His eyes were familiar from the article. Curly black hair fell over his forehead, while the sides were shaved clean. His torso displayed perfectly defined abs. A low growl sounded behind me. I knew it was Sebastian, warning me to control my thoughts.

"Just looking," I muttered.

"What do you want?!" Lucas Adler growled.

"Hopefully not to get shot," I muttered back. "We just have questions about the night you saved that woman."

"Which one?"

"There's more than one?" Theodore asked.

Lucas kept his eyes and the gun fixed on me. "Hundreds. I remember every single one."

"The first one," I tried. "Twenty years ago."

"Why?" He growled, pressing the gun harder. The pressure was pointless; it wouldn't matter if he decided to shoot.

"We are Wolves," Sebastian stated.

"Yeah, you lot are. She isn't!"

I raised my hands, realizing why he'd singled me out. He could smell the difference. That only happened with Rogues. Regular Wolves couldn't tell us apart. So how could he?

"I'm safe," I whispered. "The blonde guy. He's my mate."

"Bull fucking shit."

"My mark is on my stomach."

He stepped forward, increasing the gun's pressure, and yanked my sweatshirt up.

"You claimed a Lycan?" He sneered, releasing my top.

"It's complicated, but yes. She is my mate." Sebastian spoke calmly. "And I'd prefer it if you lowered your fucking gun."

"Tell me why you're here. Then I'll decide."

I signaled Sebastian and Theodore to wait. "The women you save from Lycans. Why do they need saving?"

"Because the beasts try to eat them. I'll be damned if that happens in my town."

"Why is it your responsibility?"

I watched his finger twitch on the trigger.

"Please don't!" I whispered. This wasn't like provoking Seraphina. One wrong word, and a bullet would be in my head.

Lucas tilted his head. "Can't say any of you have begged me not to shoot before. Your kind usually likes the challenge. But you can't survive with your brains scattered on the lawn."

"How do you know that?" My voice was croaky.

"You learn fast what works and what doesn't." He curled his lip in disgust.

"How long have you lived here?" Theodore asked.

"Born and bred."

"No pack?"

"No."

"What happened to your family?" Theodore pressed.

"Her kind."

A lump formed in my throat.

"Where are you fuckers from?" Lucas demanded.

"Obsidian Howl," Sebastian told him. "We came seeking your help."

"You ain't getting it. Though I can eliminate your problem."

"I'm not the problem. Seraphina Harrison is."
###Chapter 0268
Athena

His hazel eyes narrowed sharply.
He knew exactly who I meant.
Yet the gun remained firmly aimed.

“That treacherous snake is still breathing?” He snarled, his jaw tight.
“Yes. Hopefully not for long.” I offered a tentative smile, hoping to diffuse the situation.
He didn’t return it. “We require assistance.”

“Is she speaking the truth?” He demanded, looking at Theodore and Sebastian.
“Seraphina is the reason we’re here,” Sebastian stated coldly. “Now lower the damn weapon.”

“No. You trespass on my land. I make the rules. If you want her to keep her pretty head intact, start talking. Now.”

“Here?” Theodore questioned. “We’ll draw human attention.”

“Look around! It’s the dead of night. No other houses for miles. Why do you think I led you here, you fool?” A cruel smile finally twisted his lips. “Fucking pack morons.” He spat on the ground.

They told him the story. Almost all of it.
I felt the gun’s pressure lessen at times, only to be jammed back against my skin moments later.
I could heal, but the pain was real.
I remained perfectly still. I wouldn’t give him another reason to pull the trigger.

“You expect me to believe that fairy tale?” Lucas Adler growled, his gaze never leaving me.
“Seems too elaborate to be a lie, don’t you think?” I muttered.
“I’ve known expert liars. That serpent is one of them.”
“Seraphina?” What had she lied to him about?
“The very one.”
“Can we discuss this properly?” Theodore asked. “Wolf to Wolf?”
“You have more to say?” He sounded amused.
“So much more,” Theodore muttered. “If you’re willing to listen.”

Lucas seized my wrist, spinning me around.
He locked his arm across my chest, pulling me backward.
“You have five minutes,” he told them.

Sebastian’s expression was unreadable as he and Theodore followed.
Lucas dragged me into a dimly lit kitchen.
Black and white striped tiles covered the floor.
Black cabinets with black marble countertops lined the walls.
The interior was nothing like the dilapidated exterior.
I shouldn’t have judged the book by its cover. Or the house by its outside.

Sebastian and Theodore entered, moving to opposite sides of the room.
“Split up or stay together. I don’t care. One wrong move, and she dies. Now, convince me why I should let her live.”

“What do you want?” Theodore asked.
“Seraphina,” Lucas muttered.
“Many want her. Both Alphas. Another Lycan. Her.” Sebastian pointed at me. “She causes problems. You’ll have to get in line.”
“I’m certain she ruined my life first,” Lucas snarled. “Take me to her, and this one lives.”

This was not why we came.
“What did she do to you?” I asked.
“She murdered my parents.”
“Why?”
“Because they were Hunters. They destroyed your kind.”

I had walked into another hostage situation.
This one felt far more lethal.

“But you haven’t told me everything. Why is a Lycan Alpha mated to a Wolf Alpha?”
“They are mates,” Sebastian stated.
I wondered if that was the worst thing to say.

Lucas burst into laughter.
A deep, roaring laugh that echoed through the kitchen.
He shoved me away.
Sebastian caught me, pulling me close with a protective arm around me.
Lucas was truly unhinged.

“You people are completely insane!”
He thought we were the crazy ones.

“You pack Wolves are so predictable.” He pointed between the men. “I assume one of you is the Beta, since the Alpha isn’t here.”

Neither Theodore nor Sebastian spoke.
They seemed as confused as I was.
Theodore had been quiet for a while.

“Anyone want a beer?” Lucas asked, opening the fridge.
“What is happening?” I was used to unpredictability, but this was extreme.
From gunpoint to a beer offer, like a casual social call.
This guy had to be on something. “You just held a gun to my head!”

“Precautions.” He straightened, muscles tensing.
I reminded myself why we were here.

“A few things you should know about me, Lycan.” He popped the cap off his beer and took a swig. “I know when I’m not getting the full story. I know she,” he pointed at me, “was Rogue once. I know exactly what a Rogue is. I’ve hunted them for twenty years. You told me little I didn’t already know. I’m certain there’s more. So, what’s the catch?”

“We seek Lycans. The female Lycan Alpha requires support,” Sebastian told him.
“Then why doesn’t she link them? She’s the last one, right? Powerful? She can call them in.”
"Uh..."
"Like I said. I know my shit."
###Chapter 0269

“It’s not that simple. But she’s handling it.”

He leans on the counter, and my thoughts instantly drift somewhere inappropriate. I didn’t mean to—I blame Sebastian for leaving me so deprived.

A low growl rumbles behind me. That warning again. Sebastian’s hand presses firmly against my stomach, reminding me who I belong to. Lucas ignores it completely, hoisting himself up to sit on the counter.

“Packs always complicate things. Life’s easier when you only have to worry about yourself.”

“This is pointless,” Sebastian mutters. “He won’t help us, and we can’t give him what he wants. Let’s go.” He turns me toward the door.

“You sure about that, Blondie?”

I glance back. Lucas is grinning. “Plenty of people are willing to deal if there’s something in it for them. Me included. I can help you track your Lycans. I’ll point out which ones are still Rogue—and I get to kill those. You get your intel. I get my fun.”

“What if we don’t need to hunt?” I say softly. If he can really tell the difference, we might not need the Wolfsbane Toxin.

“Where’s the fucking fun in that?” He looks genuinely disappointed.

“Come back to the pack with us. I’ll explain everything on the way.”

“I’m nobody’s pack dog.”

“I thought you wanted to kill Rogues?” Sometimes it’s better to keep a madman close rather than let him roam free with information about us.

Surprisingly, he agrees faster than I expected. That might be a bad sign. Or maybe the chance to slaughter Rogues was too tempting to refuse.

Theodore and I wait in the kitchen while Sebastian follows Lucas around the house as he gathers weapons.

“Did you link Alexander?” I ask Theodore as another duffel bag hits the floor. Seven bags already. This guy is packing serious firepower.

“Done.” Lucas drops a fifteenth bag. He’s changed into jeans and a clean white tee. “Let’s roll. But the girl rides with me. Just in case.”

“If you touch her—” Sebastian starts.

“What’re you gonna do, Blondie? She’ll be dead before you even step out of your car. Simple. Don’t cross me, she lives.”

Despite Sebastian’s clear frustration, I agree.

We help Lucas load his truck. Before I climb in, Sebastian pulls me close. His lips meet mine. “Don’t do anything reckless. I don’t trust him.”

I nod and slip into the passenger seat. Sebastian shoots Lucas one last glare.

Lucas doesn’t ask me anything during the drive. He adjusts the music a few times but mostly stews in silence.

Shit. He hates Seraphina.

“There’s something you should know,” I blurt out.

“Knew it.” He pulls a handgun from his belt and aims it at me.

“It’s not what you think. You were right—we didn’t tell you everything. But not to hide it.” The words rush out. “The female Alpha looks exactly like Seraphina. The only difference is Athena has blue eyes.”

“Is this a joke? Did Seraphina feed you this crap?”

“I swear, I’ve seen them together.” I have maybe one second to convince him. And no proof. Think!

“Do you have a phone?”

I memorized the pack office number. Alexander made me do it when I first joined Obsidian Howl—in case of emergencies.

“Why?”

“So you can hear her voice. She sounds nothing like Seraphina.”

For a moment, he lowers the gun and pulls out his phone. I dial the number. Alexander answers.

I put it on speaker. “Alexander, is Athena awake?”

“Brianna, is everything alright?”

“I need to speak to Athena. It’s urgent. We’re almost at the pack.” All hell will break loose if Lucas thinks they’re the same person. He has enough weapons to take down half the pack. Maybe more.

“Hello? Brianna, is that you? Why didn’t you just link me?” Athena’s voice comes through the phone.

The car ahead with Sebastian and Theodore slows. Alexander must be linking them. Sebastian will know my heart is racing again.

“Ask her something,” I whisper to Lucas.

He reaches over and ends the call.

“Why did you do that? I was trying to prove who she is.”

“I heard exactly who she is.”

“You can tell, just like that?”

“Just like that,” he repeats.

“But how?”

“It’s a gift.”

“She only said ten words.”

“It was enough.”

Why do I feel like all my organs just dropped through the floor?

###Chapter 0271
Alexander

Zachary and I stood by the gates. Dawn hadn't broken yet, but the sky was beginning to lighten. This Lucas Adler made me wary. His quick agreement to come here felt suspicious.

The call with Brianna was even stranger. The man stayed silent, yet she told him to ask a specific question to Athena. I still didn't understand why. The line cut abruptly, and a drowsy Athena stared at me like I'd played some childish prank.

Headlights approached from beyond the gates. Theodore stepped out of the lead car first. Sebastian followed, visibly furious.

"I told you not to point a fucking gun at her face!" Sebastian shouted, turning toward the second vehicle.

"Can't be too careful." An unfamiliar voice replied flatly. "I warned you all—no surprises. Relax, she's still breathing."

"It's fine, Sebastian. My mistake." Brianna murmured. "He despises Seraphina, so I had to explain about Athena. Didn't want him shooting her by accident since they look identical."

‘What the hell went down out there?’ Titan asked me.

‘Trying to figure that out myself,’ I muttered back.

The four of them approached. Sebastian and Brianna trailed behind Lucas, while Theodore stayed close to him. Lucas seemed indifferent. He strolled forward casually, a bag over his shoulder, hands tucked in his denim pockets.

He stopped before the gates, his hazel eyes locking onto mine. "Alexander."

"Outsiders call me Alpha."

"Not doing that. Not when you harbor filth in your pack." His gaze flicked to Zachary, and he spat on the ground. If not for the gates, Zachary would've had his hands around the man's throat.

"Show some fucking respect," Zachary growled.

"Respect is earned," Lucas snarled back. "And I have zero for your kind, Rogue."

"I am not a Rogue!" Zachary's nostrils flared as he gripped the iron bars.

"But you were. And you still feel the pull." Lucas grinned. "How long until you snap, Zachary? A week? A few months? Either way, I'll gladly end your miserable existence."

"You told him?" Zachary demanded, glaring at Brianna.

"No, I swear," Brianna insisted. "Like I said, he just... knows things."

‘Sounds like a complete psycho,’ Titan rumbled.

Lucas kept his eyes on me but pointed at Sebastian. "Why don't you tell him, Blondie!"

"My name is Sebastian!" he snapped, stepping forward with a frown. "The guy says he can tell Lycans from Rogues. Calls himself a Hunter."

"It's not a claim, Blondie. It's a fact. Centuries old."

"Whatever. Stay away from my mate, or I'll put a bullet in you."

Lucas laughed like it was a challenge. "Now, are you letting me in? You're the ones who asked me here."

"Why agree so easily?" I pressed.

"She made a deal." He pointed at Brianna. "If that deal falls through, I'll go on a killing spree. Starting with her."

Brianna puffed her cheeks out. Whatever she promised, it was to save her own skin. I didn't blame her. But the final call wasn't hers.

"I'm the only one here who makes deals," I growled.

"Is that so?" he mocked.

"He can tell the difference," Brianna blurted. "I said he could kill the bad Lycans. It's easier than brewing Wolfsbane Toxin. No one will find out."

"Is that true?"

"It's what makes me a Hunter."

"Long as I get to kill something, I'm happy. So it's your call, Alexander." Lucas smirked, his lips peeling back from his teeth.
###Chapter 0272

Saying yes meant inviting a madman onto our territory. Saying no meant a madman knew exactly where we were.

"Tell me more about being a Hunter."

"The name says it all. What else is there to know?" Lucas smirks at me.

"Do you kill Wolves?"

"It happens." He shrugs.

"Your priority is Rogues?"

He gives a single nod.

"You won't touch my mate or my sons."

"Are they Rogues?"

"No. They're Lycans."

His lip curls. "You got Lycan kids? That's some shitty luck."

I step closer. The gate bars are the only thing between us. My eyes lock onto his. "You don't touch them. You don't harm them."

"Have they started training yet?"

"They're infants."

He raises an eyebrow and looks down. "So much for the breed dying out." His hazel eyes snap back to mine. "I won't touch them."

"Or harm them."

He rolls his eyes. "Fine."

I pull the gates open, allowing him and the others inside. "When do I get to meet this female Alpha?"

"In a few hours." No way was I waking her again.

"I'm not waiting hours."

"If you want to kill Rogues, you'll wait." I snap. This was my pack. I wasn't letting some psycho dictate how I ran it.

Lucas sits in the corner of my office. He takes apart his gun, cleaning it meticulously. The others recount what happened. Occasionally, he chips in to confirm their statements but never offers anything new.

"Hey," Athena's voice carries down the stairs. "I smell a..." She trails off as she enters the office, her gaze fixed on Lucas.

Lucas is on his feet instantly. "You weren't kidding about the resemblance." He stares at her far too long for my comfort.

"Who are you?" Athena's defenses go up immediately. She crosses her arms, glaring at him.

"Your knight in shining armor." He muses, bowing dramatically. "And a Rogue's worst nightmare."

"I don't need a knight. This isn't some fairytale where you slay the dragon." She stares him down, her entire body tense.

"Seraphina." He mutters her name and sits back down, returning to his gun.

"You've dealt with Seraphina?" Athena asks with a slight frown.

"I have unfinished business with her. But I hear many of you do." He shrugs and chuckles. "I'd like to be the one to kill her, but I heard there's a queue."

"What did she do to you?" Athena questions.

"More than enough. She needs to pay for that. You see Athena, I want to put a bullet right in the center of that pretty little head. I want her to pay for everything she did to me. Every single thing. I want my eyes to be the last thing she sees."

"She did more than kill your parents, didn't she?" Brianna steps toward him. I watch Sebastian reach out to grab her, just missing her arm.

"You don't need to concern yourself with that. As long as she dies, my day is made." Lucas tells her.

There was clearly something he wasn't sharing. Something he wasn't ready to reveal. Yet I couldn't help wondering what else Seraphina had done to him.

They ask him more questions. Most he avoids, deflecting with his own inquiries. Other answers are short and abrupt. But I also notice him watching Athena. His eyes follow her every move. He isn't just curious about her. He seems fascinated.

Was it because she looked like Seraphina? Or was there another reason he hadn't disclosed?
###Chapter 0273
Lucas Adler

The resemblance to Seraphina was unsettling.
I knew it wasn't her.
Her eyes were different.
Her soul gave her away completely.

Darkness clung to her essence.
But she hadn't turned Rogue yet.
She was fighting it.
She had been fighting for a long time.

No other Lycan had resisted this long.
Most succumb within weeks.
Some hold out for months.
Athena had fought for over a year.
Perhaps her entire life.
She didn't even know the battle raged within.

A Hunter's instinct demands action.
Eliminate the threat.
Prevent future devastation.
Yet I saw something different in her.

Her soul's edges were stained black.
But its core remained brilliantly bright.
This shouldn't be possible.
Yet here I was witnessing it firsthand.

She was locked in constant combat.
She hadn't achieved victory.
But she continued trying.

They pressed for more answers about Seraphina.
Brianna revealed she killed my parents.
There was far more to the story.
Those details remained mine alone.

They pushed relentlessly for information.
Except Athena.
She stayed silent.

They didn't need to know about me.
I came here for a job.
That was all that mattered.

Athena stood suddenly.
I found myself rising as well.
I secured my gun at my waistband.
Alexander leaned down to kiss her cheek.
The gesture reminded me of mates.

I needed to speak with her alone.
I needed to observe her soul's colors.
"Can we talk?"

"Why?" Her defenses snapped into place.
Those blue eyes assessed me.
They tried deciphering my intentions.

"I work alone usually."
"I hunt in specific ways."
"If we're partnering up, I need your methods."
"I require your plans and intentions."
The words were lies.
I already understood her approach.

Act first.
Think later.
Common among trauma survivors.
Perhaps that's when the darkness began.

"Not a good idea." Alexander muttered.
His crimson eyes narrowed.

"Can't she decide for herself?" I challenged.
She was his mate.
A Luna of his pack.
An Alpha in her own right.
She was far from helpless.

"It's not her judgment I doubt." He countered.

"I won't harm her."
"Unlike predictable Wolves, I control myself."

My gaze returned to Athena.
She hovered near the office door.
Her hand rested on the handle.
Yet she hadn't left.

I drew my gun again.
Her eyes tracked the weapon.
I placed it on Alexander's desk.
I could still kill her if desired.
This gesture might reassure her.

Instead I witnessed transformation.
Her soul's light dimmed to grey.
Her eyes darkened instantly.
It happened faster than expected.

Did she understand what caused this?
Or had she blamed something else?

Her hands clenched into fists.
She shook her head sharply.
Her cheeks puffed out.
Minutes passed before her soul brightened again.
She exerted more control than her Lycan preferred.

Her Lycan was the darkness.
It fed on her pain.
It consumed her anger.
It pushed violent thoughts into her mind.

"Go see your boys." I murmured.
Her soul ignited with brilliance.
It pushed back the edges until too bright to observe.
I had to look away from her.
###Chapter 0274

I can see the confusion in her eyes. She never told me about having sons.

"What the hell was that?" Zachary snaps at me as Athena walks out.

"Watch your tone. I'm not here to assist you." I snap back. His gaze drops to the gun on the desk. "Go ahead, try something. You think that's my only weapon?"

"ENOUGH!" Alexander commands.

"You noticed something when you were observing Athena, didn't you?" Brianna asks, her eyebrows furrowed. "Just like how you didn't shoot me."

I ignore her question and focus on their leader.

"She was bound, correct?" My estimate was two or three times, which should have been fatal.

"Four." Alexander reveals. "How did you know that?"

"Hunter." I mutter, trying to process how she survived four bindings. It revealed one undeniable truth - her incredible power. "Does she shift?"

"Not anymore. Why?"

"Her Lycan is pushing the darkness onto her."

"That makes no sense. We don't have Lycan spirits." Zachary shakes his head at me. "If that causes turning Rogue, it's illogical."

"You might not, but I know what I witnessed."

They stare at me like I'm insane. A familiar look that almost makes me laugh. So predictable.

"I'm not playing games." Alexander states, his eyes locked on me.

"Yet you let those monsters into your lives. You know that's what Rogues do, right? They manipulate to get what they want."

I see Zachary clench his jaw. His anger is almost amusing. "I'm not a Rogue anymore." He seethes.

"So you claim. Doesn't mean I believe you. I trust what I see."

"What does that mean?"

"Exactly what it sounds like."

"Zachary, check on Isabella." Alexander orders.

"Another Lycan?" I muse. How many were hidden here?

"No. My sister."

"I'd want someone more reliable watching my sister."

"They're mates."

"Another one? What's happening here?" Wolves and Lycans don't just pair up. I've studied Lycans and Rogues for years. Wolves were never part of the equation, certainly not as mates. "Who was mated first?"

"Athena and myself. Why?"

"You know that's not normal."

"World is changing." Brianna murmurs.

"Yet some things remain constant." I stand and move to the window, processing their words. "What's the connection?"

"What?" Blondie mutters.

"Athena and Alexander. Zachary and Isabella. Blondie and Brianna. Who else?"

"It was Julian and Sophia. Julian is Isabella's twin. Sophia died." Alexander presses his lips together and glances at Blondie. "Now Julian is mated to Seraphina."

I raise an eyebrow. That was unexpected.

"It's not what you think." Brianna tells me. "He got involved in some strange business with her and now he's dying in the hospital. They aren't fated mates. He claimed her."

"Did he now?"

"He was angry with me." Alexander groans.

"I can end his suffering." I offer.

"I can handle that myself." He snaps back.

Fucking Wolves. So protective of their pack members. Nothing worse than prolonged suffering. Dragging out death hoping for recovery.

"Can he communicate with her?"

"He's in a coma."

It takes tremendous force to put a Wolf in a coma. Something else must be happening. I know he won't wake up. They never do. Yet looking at Alexander, I see he still hopes for recovery. If he survives, it would be a fucking miracle.
###Chapter 0275
Zachary

I don’t trust him.
Something’s off about that guy.
He says he knows things about Lycans and Rogues.
Total bullshit.
I mutter under my breath, but Isabella isn’t listening.
Her focus is entirely on Julian.

He’s connected to every machine imaginable.
She stays by his side all day, watching for the smallest sign.
Hoping for something that isn’t there.

The machines are the only thing keeping him alive.
Turn off the ventilator, stop the heart monitor, and it would be over.
But she can’t accept that.
Not with all her medical knowledge.
Maybe she just won’t let herself believe it.

Dark circles shadow her eyes from lack of sleep.
Her lips are dry and cracked.
She hasn’t touched any food I bring her.
Not even her favorite ice cream.

“This wasn’t supposed to happen,” she whispers, clutching Julian’s lifeless hand.
“We promised to stick together.
To protect each other.
And you had to go and ruin everything.”

A tear traces a path down her cheek.
“Why couldn’t you just accept it?”

“Isabella, he can’t hear you.”

“You don’t know that!” she snaps, her voice sharp.
“He might still wake up.”

Even Alexander knows it’s hopeless.

“You need rest,” I insist.
I have to get her out of this room, even for a little while.

“I can’t leave him.”

“He won’t be alone.
I asked Theodore to sit with him.”

“It has to be me.
If anything changes—”

“Theodore will link you immediately.
This isn’t healthy.
You need sleep.
Food.
You’re no use to him if you make yourself sick.”
I press harder, hoping she finally understands.

Her dark eyes meet mine.
“I can’t, Zachary.”

“You’ll just be in the packhouse.
You’re not abandoning him.”

She sighs and slowly pulls her hand from Julian’s as Theodore enters.

“Promise me, Theodore,” she pleads.
“If anything happens—a twitch, a change in the machines—you’ll tell me.
Please.”

“Of course,” he nods.
He takes her seat beside Julian, and I still have to gently pull her away.

Alone with me, she finally lets the tears fall freely.
In bed, she allows me to hold her, curling against my body.
I hope my presence can ease her pain, even just a little.

She cries into the pillow, sobbing like I’ve never seen before.

As someone like me, you learn that death is inevitable.
It’s the one certainty in life.
We’re born, and we die.
What happens in between is up to us.
My own death doesn’t scare me, but the thought of losing my mate does.
The worst part is feeling everything she feels and not being able to fix it.
Only one person could, and he’s being kept alive by machines.

She finally cries herself to sleep.
Her eyes are puffy, her cheeks flushed from wiping away tears.
But she’s asleep, and I want to keep her that way, at least for a while.

I carefully slip away, watching her for a moment to make sure she doesn’t wake.
A soft snore escapes her lips.
She’s out, and she won’t wake for hours.

The house is quiet.
I find Athena sitting on the front steps, a deep frown on her face as she watches Lucas practice some form of martial arts.

“Alexander?”

“He took the boys and Charlotte to Sebastian’s parents.”

“Is that safe?”

“They miss their grandsons—the ones they thought were theirs.
Alexander thought the kids might cheer them up.”

“And he left him here alone?” I gesture toward Lucas.

“That’s all he’s been doing for the past hour.”

“You volunteered to watch him?”
###Chapter 0276

She gives a slow nod. “Alexander ordered him to remain within my line of sight. He has complied.”

I notice several pack members pausing to watch him. Lucas pays them no mind, as if existing in his own private universe. His motions are fluid and exact, likely executing combat drills perfected over many years.

“I don’t trust him.”

“You don’t trust anyone.” A faint smirk touches her lips as she drinks from her water bottle. “But I understand. There’s something off about him. His demeanor, the things he says. How could anyone know the things he claims to know?”

“They can’t. It’s usually gathered from surveillance or paid informants.”

“Hmm.”

“You suspect something more.”

“I don’t know what to believe.” She worries her lower lip between her teeth. “Alexander wouldn’t have left him here if he sensed a threat.”

“Maybe this is another one of his tests.”

Her wide blue eyes shift to me, nodding slowly. From what I’d gathered, Alexander did enjoy testing people, often in unconventional ways. It also likely means Athena isn’t the only one keeping tabs on this lunatic as he battles invisible opponents.

I assume he tested me at some point too. But I’m still here, chosen as Beta. I must have passed.

Lucas begins moving toward us.

Athena observes him with keen interest as he retrieves a towel and wipes the sweat from his skin.

“You train… differently.” She comments.

“Training is training.” He arches a brow, his gaze flicking toward me. “Not everyone requires a sparring partner to gauge their strength. And I certainly don’t need to pummel a bag to feel accomplished.”

His arrogance was truly something else. I was more than ready to introduce my fist to his face.

“No, you just take the coward’s way out and shove a gun in their face.”

He smirks, a dark glint in his eyes. “You have no idea what you’re talking about, Rogue.”

I rise with a low growl. “Call me a Rogue one more time!”

His smirk widens into a full grin. A deep laugh rumbles from his chest as he turns away.

“Arrogant bastard!” I snarl.

The asshole halts, keeping his back to me. He cants his head slightly over his shoulder, not fully looking back, but enough to convey a clear challenge.

Athena grips my ankle firmly. “ENOUGH!”

It was a command. One I couldn’t refuse. If I weren't so furious, I’d be impressed by her authority.

“I’m not a Rogue, Athena. I swear on my life, I never want to return to that existence.”

“I know.”

“Then let me rearrange his face.”

“No.”

“Do you actually believe the nonsense he spews?”

“I didn’t say that.” She murmurs, frowning.

I wasn’t sure how to respond. Was it mere curiosity driving her? Or did he also want Seraphina dead? Either way, I decide to stay by her side until Alexander returns.

The guy trains with unnerving intensity. His speed is remarkable, his movements flawless, superior to anything I’ve witnessed within this pack.

I spot Alexander returning with the twins and Lottie. She’s skipping beside him, clutching that bear from the hotel, when she freezes, staring at Lucas. I watch her small arm wrap around Alexander’s leg as she hides behind him.

When I look back at Lucas, he has also stopped and is staring intently at my little girl. I rush over, and Lottie practically scrambles up into my arms. She loops her arms around my neck, burying her face against my shoulder.

She isn’t crying or visibly terrified, but her heart hammers wildly against her small chest. “Who is he, Daddy?” she whispers.

“Don’t worry about him.”

I start moving toward the house to get her inside, only to find Lucas closing the distance between us.

“Charlotte?” He mutters.

I didn’t care how he knew her name. He wouldn’t lay a finger on her. “Stay away from my daughter!” I growl, shielding her.

“Your daughter?”

“Yes. Now back the hell off.”

“She’s not yours. She’s mine.”
###Chapter 0277
Athena

This was bad.

I arrived just as Lucas demanded Zachary hand over Charlotte.

"You lying bastard. I knew something was off about you. Is this your game? Stealing children from their homes?" Zachary snapped.

His arms were locked tightly around the little girl.

Alexander positioned himself and our sons between the arguing men.

My boys.

My stomach twisted into painful knots.

How could he forget he was holding them? How could he place them in danger like this?

"I'm not the one stealing them. She's my daughter!"

"Right. And I'm the King of England," Zachary shot back.

Lucas moved fast.

I didn't even see where he pulled it from.

A gun was now pointed directly at me.

"Hand her over, or I kill the person I'm supposed to be helping." His hazel eyes locked onto mine.

I couldn't tell if it was just a threat. Not until his finger moved over the trigger.

Pure rage flooded my veins.

How dare he threaten me!

'Kill him,' Nyx growled.

'Quiet!'

"Lower your weapon," Alexander commanded.

Lucas laughed. "That tone doesn't work on me. I'm not from your pack. I don't bow to Alpha status. So maybe rethink your demand. Your mate is about a minute from shifting. I won't hesitate to put her down." He winked at me.

I closed my eyes.

If I shifted, he would shoot me.

If I moved, he would shoot me.

I couldn't let the darkness win.

I took a deep, steadying breath and opened my eyes.

He was staring at me, one eyebrow cocked.

"How do you know she's yours?" I asked, forcing my voice to remain level.

"I thought I smelled her in the house. Thought my mind was playing tricks. How did she end up here?"

"Zachary saved her," I muttered.

His eyes flicked to Zachary for a second. "I want to know what she did to her."

"Who?"

"Seraphina."

"She wasn't with Seraphina," I whispered, confused. "She was found chained in a bar. Full of humans. About a year ago. Zachary brought her here. We took her in because she's a Wolf and..." My voice trailed off.

I wasn't ready to tell another stranger about my past. Or how I felt compelled to save Charlotte because no one had saved me.

"A Hunter," he muttered. But he kept watching me, like he knew there was more I wasn't saying.

"Seraphina took her?" Alexander asked, struggling to keep the wriggling twins in his arms.

Lucas lowered the gun slightly, but his finger stayed on the trigger. "Charlotte and my pregnant mate were with my parents while I was on a hunt. She killed all of them. Except Charlotte." He let out a bitter laugh. "The fucking whore took her. Guess she got bored of looking after a toddler and pawned her off."

'You should still kill him,' Nyx growled. 'Just for pointing that thing at us.'

"That proves nothing," Zachary snapped. I tried to ignore my Lycan.

I watched as Lucas slipped two fingers into his jeans pocket.

He pulled out a small, worn photograph and handed it to me.

A pregnant woman stared back. She had bright green eyes and a smile that could light up a room.

A small girl leaned over the woman's shoulder, beaming at the camera.

Charlotte got all her looks from her mother. Including the dimples when she smiled.

A deep sadness filled me.

His mate looked near her due date in the photo. That meant she was killed shortly after.

Lucas had lost everyone in the blink of an eye.

Including the only survivor of Seraphina's attack on his family.

Alexander moved closer to me.

Both boys reached out for me as I showed him the photo.

He saw it just like I did.

There was no mistake.

The young girl in the photo was Charlotte.
###Chapter 0278

“You’re actually buying this?” Zachary’s voice was sharp, disbelieving.

“Put her down, Zachary.” Alexander commanded.

“You’ve got to be joking. Look at her.” He gestured to the small girl clinging tightly to him.

I had looked. She hadn’t made a single sound. No tears fell. There was no panic. She had simply listened, absorbing every word, while holding onto the one person she trusted completely.

“Zachary!” I didn’t want to pull rank, but I would. I was getting better at it.

He stared at me for a long moment, his jaw tight. “She’s my kid.”

“She’s his, too.”

Reluctantly, he lowered her until her small shoes touched the grass. Charlotte gripped his hand, her wide eyes fixed on Lucas. Time seemed to slow as she finally let go. She ran straight into Lucas’s waiting arms.

“I’m here, sweetheart. I found you.” His voice was a soft, reassuring murmur.

Zachary turned to leave. A small voice stopped him. “Daddy, don’t go.”

He glanced over his shoulder. “I’m not going far, Lottie. Just checking on Isabella.”

Once Zachary was gone, Lucas turned his sharp gaze on us. His question was an accusation. Why had we let a Rogue near his daughter?

“You called her a Hunter,” Alexander reminded him, a cool smile on his lips. “She chose him. He’s her safe person. The only one she’ll talk to about what happened. Like it or not, he’s part of her life now.”

Alexander stepped closer. He gently placed his hands over Charlotte’s ears, blocking the next words.

“Point a gun at my mate again,” he said, his voice dangerously low. “I will pull your organs out through your ass and make you eat them.”

“Fair warning. But you’d need to be faster than a bullet,” Lucas shot back, a smirk playing on his lips.

“Then I suggest you never sleep soundly again.”

Alexander led the boys toward the house. He wanted me to follow. My feet felt rooted to the ground. I couldn’t look away from the strange Hunter.

“Charlotte, could you go help Alexander?” I asked softly. I hated to separate them so soon. But the way Lucas was staring at me… it felt like he knew a secret.

Sebastian appeared twenty meters away. Alexander must have linked him when I didn’t follow.

“Blondie has been watching for a while,” Lucas noted, not taking his eyes off me.

“He dislikes that name.”

“I’m not here to make friends.”

“Would you have really shot me?” The question left my lips before I could stop it.

“The instant your beast broke free.” He gave a single, firm nod.

“In front of Charlotte?”

“She’s a Hunter.” His answer was simple, cold.

I paused. I remembered what Zachary had said. Charlotte hadn’t reacted to the slaughtered humans in the bar. Her nightmares weren’t about them. They were about what was done to her.

“Thank you for keeping her safe.” His words shocked me. Minutes ago, death felt imminent.

“How did you know?” I asked.

“That you were close to shifting? I see it. I see the darkness circling you. My question is, how do you hold it back?”

‘What does that mean?’ Nyx pressed, her annoyance palpable. She was always angry, but Lucas provoked something deeper in her.

“Why do you want to know?” I countered.

“Never seen anyone do it like you. I’m curious.”

“I was given advice.”

“From the other Rogues? I’d take that with a grain of salt. There’s a difference between them and you. They’ve already fallen.”

“They shifted back. Brianna did it easier than Zachary. They’ve been fine.”

“In my experience, it never lasts.”

“They’re different.”

“Keep telling yourself that. Something will trigger them one day. Something will push them over the edge. They won’t come back from it.”

“You don’t know them.”

“I’ve been doing this a long time. Right now, I’m more concerned about the Rogue who’s attached himself to my daughter.”
###Chapter 0279
Lucas Adler

“She adores him.” Athena tells me.
I saw that clearly myself.
Dorothy—Charlotte—was too young to access her Hunter abilities yet.
To her, he was just the man who rescued her.
But to me, he remained a walking time bomb.
I refused to let her anywhere near that threat.

“Would you let your own boys near someone you considered dangerous?” I countered. “I saw your reaction when Alexander stood between me and the Rogue. He was holding your two squirming infants. He placed them directly in harm’way.”

“Of course I wasn’t happy about it.”
“Yet you kept your composure.”

She frowned at me.
It was a frown of confusion, not anger.
If it were anger, that subtle crease between her brows would have reappeared.
I was surprised it hadn’t shown earlier when I pointed a gun at her.
Even Brianna had reacted as if tasered.

“I’m sorry she did that to you.”
An apology was the last thing I expected from her.
She was proving more unpredictable than I initially thought.
Perhaps she was exactly what the Lycans needed.
Maybe she could be the one to maintain order among them.

“You have no reason to apologize. You might resemble her, but you weren’t the one who slit my family’s throats while they slept. You didn’t take my baby girl and hand her over to damn humans.”

She nodded, her gaze flicking toward Sebastian in the distance.
She gave him a slight, almost imperceptible shake of her head.
“You knew he was watching, didn’t you?” she asked quietly.

“Yes. And he’s not the only one. Two more are hiding in the trees over there. An older woman is observing me from her bedroom window. That couple down there pretending to be on their phones. Plus several others.”

Her eyes widened as I smiled.
“I wouldn’t be much of a Hunter if I couldn’t identify potential threats,” I mused.

“Are you part Witch?”
“Hell no.” Why did everyone jump to that conclusion?
It wasn’t magic.
It was a gift honed and developed over generations of Hunters.
We came preloaded with instinct, and everything we learned was passed down.

She nodded, a small smile touching her lips.
Her soul seemed to glow brighter as well.
She turned away from me. “I need to go check on something.”

I watched her walk away.
She was an odd one.
So different from other Lycans.
Powerful, too, but only if her Lycan side didn’t sabotage it.

“Alright then, Blondie, let’s hear it. You’ve been staring at me for the past hour.” He had been inching closer even after Athena signaled him to stop. “See anything interesting?”

“You really think you’re something special, don’t you?”
“Nah,” I brushed past him and winked. “I know I am.”

I ducked before his fist could connect, easily evading the subsequent punches.
They always led with a punch, always aimed at the face.
Why were pack Wolves so predictable?
I yawned as he threw another wild swing at my head.
This time when I ducked, his fist accidentally connected with his mate’s forehead.

He really should pay more attention to his surroundings.

Her feet flew up higher than her head as the impact sent her stumbling backward.
Her brown eyes widened in shock from the sudden blow.
Her body hit the ground with a sickening crack, the sound of something breaking.

“Mal—Brianna! Brianna, talk to me! Are you okay?” Sebastian dropped to his knees beside her, flustered and horrified that he’d hurt his own mate.

She groaned as a bruise rapidly bloomed on her forehead before beginning to heal.
I watched her leg snap audibly back into place.

“You made me hit my fucking mate!” Sebastian growled, lurching back to his feet and leaving Brianna moaning on the grass.

“Can’t say I’d ever hit a woman. But then again, it wasn’t me who clocked her in the forehead, was it?”

He snarled at me, fury radiating from him.
“Maybe you should use your eyes and ears more, Blondie. Pay attention to what’s happening around you. And maybe tell her it’s not smart to stand right behind people. You never know what might come flying your way.”

“Wanker!” he snapped, helping Brianna sit up.

I shrugged. I’d been called far worse, especially by those staring down the barrel of my gun.

Did I intend for him to hit her? No.
Did I enjoy it? Maybe a little.

“Go tell your leader,” I mused. “I didn’t lay a hand on either of you. Sounds like a you problem.” I spat on the grass and turned toward the packhouse.
I had already missed years with my baby girl.
I wasn’t about to miss another moment.
###Chapter 0280

Her laughter echoes through the halls.
It’s light and musical.
A sound I haven’t heard in years.
My chest tightens with raw emotion.
Pure joy.
If only her mother were here to witness this.

I remember coming back from hunts.
Finding my little girl still awake.
Playing quietly with her mother.
She’d always light up when I walked in.
My mate would smile and say the same thing every night.
“Charlotte can’t sleep without your kiss.”
That final night… I never got to tuck her in.

My heart didn’t just break.
It vanished.
There was no trace of her anywhere.
Just a damn note from Seraphina.
Two words: “I win.”
She hid them perfectly.
Vanished into thin air.

I follow the sound of giggles to the kitchen.
Charlotte is on the floor.
Two little Lycan pups are climbing over her.
She’s laughing, pure and bright.
The sound fills the whole house.

I study the twins.
One looks just like Alexander.
The other has Athena’s features.
Their souls are still pure.
Tiny balls of light.
No darkness.
Not yet.

“She adores them,” Alexander says.
I stiffen. “They’re Lycans.”
“You were taught they’re all evil. But take it from your own daughter—they’re not.”
“They’re just pups. They haven’t become anything yet.”
“I’m not talking about them.” He gestures toward Charlotte. “I mean Zachary and Brianna. She loves them.”

“Is Daddy upset?” Charlotte asks softly.
“No, sweetheart. I’m not mad.” I smile and crouch down to her level.
She doesn’t smile back. Just watches me. Her eyes are exactly like her mother’s.
“Not you. My other daddy.”
My heart clenches. Hard.
“He’s not your daddy, baby girl.”
“Yes, he is. He saved me. Daddies save people.”

My daughter loves a Lycan like family.
It makes my blood boil.

“Daddy Zachary isn’t mad,” Alexander tells her gently. “He went to check on Isabella.”
“Is Isabella sad?” Her small voice is full of concern.
“Yes.”
“Because Julian is dying?” She hugs a teddy bear tightly.
Alexander goes completely still. He stares.
I know that look.
It’s the same one I get when I know things I shouldn’t.

“She’s never met him, has she?” I ask as the boys distract her.
“No. She shouldn’t know that.”
“Hunter genes,” I murmur with a faint smile. “And judging by your face… this isn’t the first time she’s surprised you, is it?”

Alexander signals for an omega to take the pups away.
Once they’re gone, he motions me to the table.
“She says things sometimes. Little comments. We started keeping her out of certain conversations. Just in case she understands more than we thought.”
“You can’t hide anything from her. Be glad she’s young. Just wait until she can read souls.”

His crimson eyes give nothing away, but his posture shifts. “You can read souls?”
“How do you think I know things I shouldn’t? Got any beer?”
He gets up and grabs two bottles from the fridge.
“Is that why you don’t like Zachary? Because of what you see?”
“Bingo.”
“Then why provoke Sebastian?”
“Because it’s easy. Speaking of… you might want to check on him. He hit his mate pretty hard.”
“She’s fine,” I add when he looks at me sharply.

I take a long drink.
He’s choosing his words when I hit him with my own question.
“How long has she been using the name Harrison?”
“Athena has always been a Harrison.”
“Not her. The other one. Harrison doesn’t come from her father’s side. It’s from her mother’s. Passed down like her special blood. They shared the same father, right?”
He nods slowly. “What did you know her as?”
“Seraphina Blackwood. Funny, isn’t it?”
“What is?”
“Changing her last name to one tied to a powerful Lycan bloodline. Almost like she’s trying to convince everyone she’s the lost female Lycan they’ve been waiting for.”
###Chapter 0281
Alexander

‘Silverwood.’ Titan murmurs. ‘That name rings a bell.’

‘There was a pack named Silverwood decades ago. Far south. Long before my time. They were completely destroyed.’ My Alpha training included studying fallen packs.

Silverwood wasn’t eliminated by war. It was a natural catastrophe. Massive floods triggered a devastating landslide. My father said they were either drowned or buried alive. Our healing abilities mean nothing against such raw, destructive force.

“Silverwood was a Wolf pack.” I mutter to Lucas with a frown.

He smirks and shakes his head.

“Lycans?”

He takes another drink of beer and nods. “Many packs pretended to be Wolves. Easier to hide their true nature. Wolves can’t tell the difference, as you well know.”

Silver Creek had done exactly that. They made Athena believe she was a Wolf her entire life.

“You’ve eliminated packs?” I press.

“I eliminate Rogues. My ancestors wiped out packs. I chose to focus on the real threats.”

“Are you claiming Seraphina is from this Silverwood pack? That’s impossible.”

He grins. “My grandparents blew up a dam near their territory. Made it look like a structural failure. Then… everything was just gone.”

It was brutally efficient. One act erasing an entire pack. It made me wonder how many Lycan packs I’d unknowingly encountered.

“You think Seraphina’s mother escaped?”

“Perhaps. Or she wasn’t there when it happened.”

“That’s why Seraphina came for your family when she was old enough. Revenge.”

“In my line of work, every action has consequences. My grandparents should have ensured no survivors. Their mistake became my problem to solve.”

“But why take Charlotte from you? What was the point?”

“You can mourn a death. You never recover from knowing your child is alive somewhere out there. You always wonder if they remember you. If they ever think of you.”

I couldn’t imagine that pain. If someone tried taking one of my boys, nowhere would be safe for them. I would hunt them to the ends of the earth.

“Brianna had an encounter with Seraphina.”

“I heard.”

“Seraphina mentioned a pack. Said she was trained before going Rogue. She caught herself and reacted violently. If Silverwood was destroyed, which pack was she referring to?”

“That’s what I haven’t figured out. Several Lycan packs remain in this country. Others moved overseas when Wolf numbers increased. I’ve watched them. Never seen her with any. I considered she might be deceiving Wolves into believing she’s one of them.”

It wasn’t a far-fetched idea.

“Did you know about Silver Creek?” I challenge.

He looks directly at me. “No. Not at the time you’re referring to. They were recorded as wiped out.” He sees my annoyed expression. “Being a Hunter doesn’t grant omniscience. I can tell the difference. I can smell their distinct scent. Training and knowledge are passed down. We record pack information. I assure you, there’s only one record for a Silver Creek pack. It says deceased.”

He taps his empty bottle on the table. “Why did you accept her? Even after learning what she was, you let her stay. Let her thrive.”

“I searched for my mate for years. When I found her, I knew I could never let her go.”

“She’s a Lycan.” He stares intently with his hazel eyes.

“Sometimes the heart doesn’t care about origins.”

“Did you pity her? You did save her from a horrific situation.”

“She told you about that?” I ask, surprised. She rarely volunteers that information. Details slip out occasionally, but she mostly keeps it buried.

“She didn’t need to tell me. I see it in her soul.”
###Chapter 0282

‘There he goes with that soul nonsense again.’ Titan grumbles. ‘I still don’t get how anyone can actually see a soul.’

“Are you telling me her soul is corrupted?” I question Lucas Adler.
I didn’t know what to make of his claim.
Once, I wouldn’t have believed someone could survive four bondings either.
I’ve seen too much these past few years to dismiss anything outright.

“Not corrupted. Cracked.”

“Cracked?” Titan and I say at the same time.

“Every soul begins as a tiny sphere of light. It expands as the person grows, slowly forming their shape. Some souls stop growing when the person becomes trapped in a cycle. Others, those who endure trauma, develop fractures. When these cracks connect, the soul shatters. And so does the person.”

“How severe are hers?”

“She should have broken apart already.”

“Is that how the darkness entered?”

“No.”

“How can you be certain?”

“It was always there. Waiting.” He lets out a low chuckle. “You know, I’ve never actually spoken to Lycans or Rogues before. Only hunted them. Listened to them beg. I must admit, Athena is nothing like I expected.”

“If her soul is fractured, what’s holding her together?”

“Still working that out. Got another beer?”

“We’re limited.”

“Because of the blonde’s problems. Understood.” He smirks, one eyebrow raised. “You don’t believe me, do you Alexander?”

He stands and tosses the empty bottle into the trash. “But you believe in Witch magic, don’t you?”

“Assuming you’re being truthful… You said her darkness was waiting. You’re talking about her Lycan, aren’t you?”

“Exactly. But you’ve suspected that for a while.” He sits back down across from me. “Athena has astonishing control over her Lycan. I watched her force the darkness back. Something I’ve never witnessed.”

“Never?”

“Not once.”

His fascination with her was obvious.
I couldn’t tell if it was good or bad.
Given his hatred for Lycans and Rogues, it likely wasn’t positive.
I needed to ensure he stayed on her side.

“How do I help her control her Lycan if Nyx is the problem?”

“Who knows.” He shrugs. “Her cracks indicate she shouldn’t be alive. She’s constantly battling her Lycan. Survived four bondings.” He keeps muttering to himself. Listing facts I already knew.

He looks directly at me. “Maybe binding her is what saved her.”

“You’re insane if you think I’d bind her.” How dare he suggest that.

“You’re not hearing me, Alexander. You asked what’s holding her together.” He drums his fingers on the table, thinking. “Humans are full of cracks. Tiny ones that weave through their souls. Rarely connecting.”

He grabs Charlotte’s coloring book from the table and flips to a blank page. Quickly sketching a human form.

“Humans crack under pressure, stress, financial worry. But their cracks become part of them. They learn. Like applying a bandage. Some end up in psych wards when their fractures collapse.”

“Athena isn’t human.”

“I’m aware. But she nearly was. Her body learned to defend itself. To survive. A cracked soul isn’t something we heal from, Alexander. Yet she’s managed to stop the cracks from spreading.”

His lips curl into a smile. “Fascinating.”

“Fascinating?”

“Just when I thought I knew everything about Rogues and Lycans, something new appears.” His hazel eyes gleam with delight, giving him a sinister look. One I disliked intensely.

“You won’t touch her.” I warn.

“I won’t touch her. Can’t promise the same for the other two.” He winks. I assume he means Zachary and Brianna, not the twins. But I have no intention of letting him harm any of them.
###Chapter 0283
Zachary

Isabella wasn't in our bed when I got back.
The rest she desperately needed had slipped through her fingers once more.
I already knew exactly where to find her.
Back at Julian's bedside.
Praying for a miracle.

I didn't pause when I heard Alexander and Lucas talking in the kitchen.
Lucas was spouting nonsense about seeing souls like he was some kind of deity.
Maybe that was the heart of it.
He just had a God complex.
Bringing him here was a colossal mistake.
And I was going to prove it.

I found Isabella right where I knew she'd be.
In the hospital room.
Hunched over Julian.
Fighting off exhaustion.
Gripping his hand like a lifeline.

"You should be resting."

"Couldn't sleep," she whispered.

"Theodore was watching him," I reminded her.

"I know."

She clung to Julian's hand.
Her thumb traced circles on his skin as if that simple motion could rouse him.

"Did something happen? Did Theodore mind-link you?"

She shook her head.
A single tear traced a path down her cheek.

I stood there.
Watching her.
Searching for words.
Then I heard his voice.
Why the hell was he here?

I yanked the door open.
Alexander and Lucas stood there.

"You have got to be kidding me!"

"Good to see you too, Rogue!" He flashed me a grin.
Alexander rolled his eyes.

"Why are you here, asshole?" I shot back.
If he kept calling me Rogue, I had plenty of names for him too.

"I asked him to come," Alexander cut in.

"So he can examine Julian's soul?" I said, dripping sarcasm.

"Exactly."

I stared at Alexander.
He couldn't possibly believe this garbage.

"His soul?" Isabella whispered behind me.

"Isabella, this is Lucas. Lucas, this is my sister Isabella, and the man in the bed is my brother, Julian."

The asshole stared at me.
Waiting for me to move.
I positioned myself beside Isabella.
The idiot smirked at me.
Once we were alone, I'd make sure he never smirked again.

He took a seat on the other side of Julian.
Propped an ankle on his knee.
Studied my mate's brother.

"He's a Wolf?"

"I thought you could tell the difference?" I sneered.

"That's not why I asked, Rogue. I'm questioning how he can be a Wolf."

"I don't understand," Alexander frowned.

"You told me what he did to himself. That he nearly killed himself to sever his Wolf. To break his bond with Seraphina."

"Yes."

"Hmm." He stared at my mate the same strange way he'd looked at Athena.

"What?" Isabella murmured. "What is it?"

The asshole frowned.
His eyes dropped to my mate's hand holding Julian's. "Humour me. Let go."

"Why?" she muttered.

"Curiosity."

He said that word too often.
It was infuriating how he never explained himself.
Not unless he felt like it.

"I can't," Isabella whispered. "I'm not ready."

"He's not going anywhere," the asshole told her.

She nodded.
Her hand slowly withdrew.
Why did everyone obey him like he was some kind of prophet?
Why was I the only one who didn't trust him?

After several minutes of silence, a smile touched his lips. "Okay, you can hold him again." He muttered and left.

"I'll be right back," I told my mate.
I followed Alexander and Lucas out. "What the hell was that about?"

"He's not dead," the asshole muttered.

"The machines—" Alexander started.

"The machines are letting him heal. Very, very slowly." He ran a hand over the stubble on his cheeks. "Twin Wolves. In essence and spirit. Much like mates, they connect on multiple levels. Surely you know this."

"I know their bond is unique," Alexander replied.

"You should prepare yourself. Your sons share the same bond."

"Really? Do you get off on spouting this crap? Those machines are keeping him alive."

"Nah."

I stepped toward him.
He laughed. "You never should have come here, asshole."

"Neither should you, Rogue."

He moved fast.
A gun pressed against my temple.

"Lucas!" Alexander growled.

"I promised not to hurt your mate." He smiled, staring dead into my eyes. "I didn't promise I wouldn't kill the Rogue." His eyes narrowed. "Your brain will make a lovely piece of art. Smeared against that wall. I might even frame it."

"Son of a bitch."

"You shouldn't talk about someone else's mother like that. Not with your own family problems." He pushed the gun harder against my temple.

"You two are worse than squabbling children!" Alexander snapped. "Lucas, put the gun down. Zachary, go to Isabella."

"Looks like it's your lucky day." The asshole grinned. "I was looking forward to hanging that frame. I was going to add a plaque. ‘Here lies the remnants of a Rogue. He thought he knew what he was doing, but the darkness took him instead.’ Has a nice ring, doesn't it?"

A low growl rumbled in my chest.
He laughed.
Tapped the gun against my temple twice.

"Remember. I'm always prepared, Rogue." He winked.
Turned away.
Acting like he chose not to shoot me.
###Chapter 0284

“Are you going to explain what just happened?” Isabella’s voice is low as I shut the door hard. She doesn’t turn toward me. Her focus remains entirely on her brother.

“That jerk says he’s a Hunter.”

“I thought he was a Wolf.”

“A Hunter who targets Rogues and Lycans.”

She blows out a breath and finally tears her dark gaze from Julian to look at me. “Why would my brother bring someone like that here? With you and Athena here… Brianna and the boys…”

“He also has history with Seraphina.” I let out a frustrated sound. “And Brianna convinced him to help Athena.”

“He’s Charlotte’s father?” Her eyes lock on mine as I deliver the news. It’s the most attention she’s given me since Julian was brought in. A small victory, distracting her exhausted mind even for a moment.

“So it seems.”

“You’re certain?”

“I saw his expression when he looked at her. It mirrored the way Alexander and Athena look at their sons.”

“How is Charlotte handling it?”

“Better than expected. She almost seemed to recognize him.” I frown, remembering how she hugged me. I mistook her fear for overwhelm. “She ran straight into his arms.”

“She won’t stop loving you.” Isabella offers a faint, tired smile.

“But I’m not her actual father, am I?” The thought felt like a physical tear in my chest.

“Don’t assume the worst yet. Charlotte adores you. You’re the only one she lets call her Lottie. She won’t just disappear from your life.”

“She will if he takes her. This is her home, Isabella. She loves her pack. She’s a pack Wolf.”

“If he’s helping Athena, he’ll be staying awhile. Seraphina hasn’t been seen since your last encounter. Charlotte isn’t leaving you that easily.” She glares at me. “And you can’t kill him. That would destroy her.”

Her gaze drops back to her brother. I’d lost her attention again. In the silence, I replayed the Hunter’s words. ‘Twins in essence and spirit.’ He claimed the machines weren’t sustaining Julian.

Isabella had said their Wolves were twins too. Could he possibly mean Midnight was keeping Julian alive?

I hated the bastard, but I needed answers.

Alexander and the Hunter were still outside the hospital.

“What did you mean about the machines not keeping him alive?” I demanded.

He smirked. My fingers itched to wrap around his throat.

“He was suggesting it’s Isabella,” Alexander stated calmly.

“Alright, enlighten me with your brilliant theory.”

“Do you genuinely want to know, or are you just being difficult?”

Alexander’s crimson eyes held mine. A silent warning to tread carefully.

“I want to hear it,” I gritted out.

“He lives because of her. Twin Wolves shared by twins are as rare as Athena. You know that, right?”

“I’m aware.”

“Their souls are linked.” He laced his fingers together. “Intertwined.”

“How does that work? He left the pack.”

“They leave a piece of themselves behind. When I say she’s keeping him alive, it’s because…”

“Part of her soul resides in him,” Alexander finished. “She isn’t dead, so he can’t move on.”

“Exactly!” The Hunter clapped his hands together, winking at Alexander. “And that’s why you, Alexander, felt his death and continued. She can’t. She’s trapped.”

“Does he still possess a soul?” Alexander asked, his brow furrowed.

“I believe you already know the answer to that.”

“Okay, oh wise one,” I muttered, sarcasm dripping from my tone. “What do we do if my mate is the one sustaining him?”

“There’s nothing you can do. It’s in the hands of a higher power. The machines aid his healing. But no one survives long without a soul. Perhaps if it’s deemed he deserves it, he’ll be granted a new one. You should pray for that outcome.”

“Total lunatic,” I muttered, turning away. I’d never heard such nonsense.

“You love my little girl,” he shouted after me. “She’ll grow up to be just like me. If I somehow decide to let you live, will you make her think she’s losing her mind?”

“You can’t guarantee she’ll be like you.”

“It’s in her genetics. I’ve already seen the signs.”

I was ready to retort when Athena’s voice echoed in my mind. ‘This is your Alpha. Your presence is required in Obsidian Howl.’

I looked up, confused. I was already in Obsidian Howl. I turned to ask Alexander what was happening just as Brianna sprinted toward us, a huge grin on her face.

“She did it! She linked everyone.”
###Chapter 0285
Lucas Adler

“She actually succeeded?” Alexander asks, his voice filled with surprise. He turns toward the pack house, his expression shifting.

“How did she manage it?”

Brianna simply shrugs. “I wasn’t with her when it happened.”

Alexander scowls, not because he disapproved, but because Athena had accomplished this without any guidance.

“I saw Zachary here with you both and just…” She pauses, her brown eyes lifting toward the hospital doors with a frown. She doesn’t question why we’re here, though her curiosity is evident.

“We need to prepare.” Zachary stares directly at me. “But I suspect you’re already prepared for what’s coming.”

“This is exactly why I was summoned here. To deal with the Rogues.” I give him a knowing wink.

He rolls his eyes dramatically before turning to Brianna. “You’re coming with me where I can keep you safe.”

“What about Isabella?” she questions. “That’s why you’re here, isn’t it? Is Julian still alive?”

“Isabella will be fine.” I assure them, earning another irritated glare from Zachary. He was so easy to provoke. I just needed him to lose control, to give me a legitimate reason to end him without anyone questioning my actions.

He gives me one final heated look before walking away, pulling Brianna along with him. Alexander and I are left standing alone.

“You need to stop provoking him.” Alexander warns me. “He’s my Beta. He’s done nothing but help this pack and Athena. He spent the last year raising your daughter. You owe him at least some respect for that.”

“There’s a reason Wolves and Lycans don’t coexist, Alexander. Lycans live on the edge, constantly risking descent into Rogue madness. Wolves don’t face that danger. It’s that simple.”

“Is it?” He challenges me. “If you haven’t noticed, several of us are now mated to Lycans. A bond specifically created for us. If we weren’t meant to live together, why do these bonds exist at all?”

I open my mouth to respond, but he continues passionately.

“You’re telling me you have centuries of knowledge passed down, yet you’re still trapped in the past. Living by these insane, outdated rules created gods know how long ago. Have you ever actually tried to understand a Lycan?”

I remain silent, seeing the absolute conviction in his eyes.

He shakes his head in disappointment. “For someone who can read souls, you’re blind to so many things.”

“I was born a Hunter. It’s my birthright.”

“You were also born a Wolf. Don’t forget that. Now come with me. We need to see my mate.”

I follow slightly behind him as we head toward the packhouse, his words echoing in my mind. I was born to be a Hunter. It flowed through my veins. I couldn’t change that truth, nor did I desire to.

Athena paces nervously in the office, her eyes downcast as she moves back and forth. She only stops when Alexander clears his throat.

“I did it. I sent out the link.” She murmurs, uncertainty coloring her voice.

“So I’ve heard.” Alexander smiles warmly at her. I watch as their souls ignite with mutual love and devotion. Their union defied nature, yet their souls were perfectly matched. What were the higher powers playing at?

“It was the right decision, wasn’t it? This is what we agreed needed to be done?” She seeks his reassurance.

“Yes.” He pulls her close against him. “How did you manage to accomplish it?”

She smiles softly. “Charlotte.”

Alexander raises an eyebrow, glancing back at me. “Charlotte helped you?”

She nods enthusiastically. Part of me feels sickened yet proud that she’s already tapping into her Hunter abilities. Though my Hunter daughter had aided a Lycan. An involuntary shiver runs down my spine.
###Chapter 0286

I hadn't told her the full extent of our plan. She sat with me while I changed the twins. She simply reminded me that I had the power to do this. Then it just happened. No one has replied yet.

They don't need to reply. They will come. I frown deeply. Some will come out of annoyance. Others will come from curiosity. But they will come. Seraphina will probably show up too. I watch her carefully.

Her wide blue eyes lift to meet Alexander's crimson gaze. The last time we had many people here, terrible things happened.

The difference is we expect trouble this time. Alexander tells her firmly. That's what he is here for. He gestures toward me.

Right. Her voice wavers with uncertainty. He doesn't help ease her fears.

Their bond was stronger than any I had ever witnessed. Stronger than the connection I shared with my own mate. It shouldn't work between them. Yet somehow it does.

I needed to observe bonded pairs more closely. Especially those with Lycan mates.

Athena begins to panic more visibly. She thinks she made a huge mistake. What if I shift?

Then we handle it when it happens. His tone softens when he speaks to her. It never softens for me or anyone else.

Promise you'll protect the twins. She whispers urgently. If I...

You won't shift.

They both look at me suddenly. They had forgotten I was still in the room.

I won't let you go Rogue. The words leave my mouth before I can stop them.

Stopping Lycans from turning Rogue never interested me before. I only cared about ending their miserable lives. But something about Athena made me hesitate. Perhaps I was too fascinated by her fractured soul. Perhaps it was just part of the job. I also knew I couldn't learn anything from her if she went Rogue and died.

Two days passed. A handful of Lycans appeared.

Every single one ended up lying before me. Each had a bullet buried in their skull.

They hated her. They despised that she led them. They loathed that she mated a Wolf. They were furious she had children with him. They were enraged she summoned them.

I watched their souls darken while Athena spoke to them. They became threats. I put them down before they could do anything stupid. Nobody questioned me. Not even Zachary.

I took the bodies to the pack's edge. I planned to bury them. Instead I built a fire. I tossed their bodies onto the flames. I watched them burn.

The smell of burning Lycans is putrid. It becomes worse when the bodies swell from gas. The stench invades your senses for days. Just when you think it's gone, a tiny reminder drifts back. Even after all this time, I never adjusted to that odor.

Done. I mutter upon returning to the house. Zachary, Blondie and Alexander stand outside.

You burned them? Blondie asks.

Too many to bury. This way we only deal with bones. I shrug casually.

Bet you enjoyed that, didn't you? Zachary crosses his arms. He glares at me intensely.

I'm doing my job. I mutter back. I wouldn't tell him I felt sorry for Athena. The first ones to come wanted nothing to do with her. Feeling pity for a Lycan was new for me. Any sign of others?

Alexander shakes his head. Not yet.

They've lived without a leader too long. Even her mother lacked her power. She must understand many won't like this. Many will resist. Especially after freedom lasted this long.
###Chapter 0287

"She knows." Alexander's voice was a low, menacing growl.

"What about the other packs?" Sebastian questioned. "We know Silver Creek had a leader."

"No packs have a true leader unless they are Wolves. They choose someone, and if they don't like it, they kill them and replace them. Isn't that what Silver Creek did to Athena's parents?"

"It is."

"Then this will be different."

"I thought you don't believe in Alphas?" Sebastian tutted.

"I don't, but I believe in power."

Alexander frowned at my words but remained silent. His intense gaze fixed on the direction of the pack's main entrance. They all seemed to be expecting more arrivals. Believing that people would jump at the chance to have a leader.

"Incoming." Alexander muttered as Brianna strode up the drive with two new people. A Lycan and a Wolf, walking hand in hand. The Lycan female had a fresh mark on her neck. Her hand was gripped a little too tightly around the man's. There was no darkness to her soul, but there was palpable fear.

Brianna stopped just in front of us. I watched the girl's fingers grow impossibly tighter around the guy's hand. Or so I initially thought. Looking closer, I saw that he was actually holding onto her. His knuckles were white from the strain. The skin on her hand appeared sunken from the excessive pressure.

"This is Hannah and Nathan." Brianna smiled. "Hannah is a Lycan mated to a Wolf." She was clearly saying it for my benefit, smiling smugly in my direction.

"Hannah." The girl whispered. Her chestnut eyes briefly settled on me before she gave a sort of bow. The movement made her red waves fall over her face.

The gesture was subtle, but enough for me to see that Nathan was the one forcing her into that bow. She gulped audibly but didn't make another sound as she slowly straightened. She had probably convinced him to come here because of Athena's instructions. But in reality, she was using it as a way to ask for help.

"Hannah." Alexander stepped forward. His tone told me he had seen the same things I had. Perhaps it reminded him of how he met Athena. "Brianna will take you through to meet Athena. Nathan, you will stay with us."

"If it's all the same, Alpha Alexander, I would like to meet the Lycan Alpha that dragged me and my mate from our holiday."

"You will." Alexander stepped closer. "Meetings are done individually so everyone can be properly verified."

"There are other Lycans here?" His eyes flickered between us.

Zachary stepped forward and gestured to himself. "Yes."

"I would still prefer to attend the meeting with Hannah. I want to know what this Alpha wants. And she wants me by her side."

Nathan glared at Hannah until she whispered that she was afraid to be alone with a stranger.

"Nothing will happen to her." I smiled at him, though I already had ideas about what was about to happen to him.

"Can you guarantee that?" He cocked his head to one side and stared directly at Alexander.

"I can guarantee nothing will happen to her." Alexander stated the same assurance I had given. He knew exactly what was coming.

Nathan frowned but finally released the pretty redhead. "Two minutes." He muttered to Hannah, pulling her in roughly. He planted his lips on the corner of hers. Her soul pulsated with raw fear.

"Brianna." Alexander gave her a nod. Brianna smiled and linked arms with Hannah, gently encouraging her to go into the house.

Nathan's brain ruptured out the back of his skull just as the door closed behind the women.
###Chapter 0288
Seraphina

My gaze locks onto the children playing in the front yard.

They're perfect copies of their father.

They laughed while kicking a ball between them.

Giggles filled the air until the younger boy slipped on the ball.

He landed hard with a heavy thud.

Their joyful sounds instantly turned to cries.

The older boy started screaming for his mother.

She rushed out of the house immediately.

An apron was tied around her waist.

A small dish towel draped over her shoulder.

Her jet black hair was pulled into a high bun.

She dropped to her knees beside the boy.

Pulling him against her chest, she rocked him gently.

She promised everything would be fine.

She's raising them to be weak.

There wasn't even any blood visible.

If I had fallen from a tree at their age...

She would have told me to get up immediately.

'You're stronger than this. Toughen up! Do better!'

They were all smiles again quickly.

The tears stopped when she promised cake and ice cream.

I rolled my eyes at the indulgence.

I would have been lucky to get dinner at that age.

But here I was now.

I needed a place to hide temporarily.

Somewhere to think clearly.

I returned to my mother's home hoping for shelter.

Maybe just for a night or two while figuring things out.

Forcing myself from my new blue BMW, I straightened up.

My bones cracked from the movement.

I had barely managed to shift back yesterday.

It took tremendous effort.

But I was in human form again.

I needed to maintain it now.

Stepping toward the house, I scanned the small cul-de-sac.

Every house here contained Lycans.

The remnants of what was once a great Lycan pack.

The white gate creaked as I pushed it open.

I noticed the curtains twitch immediately.

The front door was ripped open moments later.

My mother's husband stood there glaring.

His deep blue eyes burned with anger.

"What the hell do you want?" Caleb demanded.

"Not you, that's clear." I retorted sharply.

"I came to see my mother and brothers."

"She's not here." He stated firmly.

"The boys don't even know who you are."

He started shutting the door quickly.

I stuck my toe in the door to stop him.

He glared at me with pure hatred.

"You're stupid if you think I believe that."

"I just saw her outside." I hated him intensely.

Almost as much as I hated Athena and her friends.

"What do you want, Seraphina?" He stepped outside.

He made me back up as he folded his arms.

His defensive stance was unmistakable.

"You're not welcome here at all."

"Don't give me bullshit about wanting to see your mother."

"You haven't been here in five years."

"I bet you can't even remember your brothers' names."

I took a deep breath slowly.

He wasn't wrong about that.

The youngest was just born when I left.

"Maybe it's time I get to know my brothers." I offered.

"So you can warp their minds too?" He snarled angrily.

I could kill him right now.

I've thought about it countless times.

But for some messed up reason, I couldn't do it.

He made my mum happy after years of sadness.

I didn't want to take that away from her.

"I know I haven't been around." I admitted.

I cast a nervous glance up and down the street.

I really didn't want others to see me.

"Thank god for that." He snapped.

"You almost led that Hunter bastard to our door."

He ran a hand over his shaved head.

"I killed his family." I stated.

"But you didn't kill him." He countered.

"Big fucking mistake that was."

"I..."

"Seraphina, this isn't a good time."

A baby started crying from inside suddenly.

"You had another pup?" I asked.

"Yes." He confirmed. "You have a sister now."

"Mum shouldn't be having pups at her age." I retorted.

He didn't answer me directly.

His deep blue eyes remained fixed on me.

He seemed to be waiting for something else.

My mother appeared holding a newborn pup.

"Seraphina." She whispered when seeing me.

She didn't smile at my presence.

"Why...why did you come here?" She asked.

I watched her hands tighten around the baby.

She took a step back nervously.

She was clearly scared of me.

"Well?" Caleb demanded. "Your mother asked you a question."

"I already told you." I said.

"I want to know my brothers...and meet my sister."

I forced a smile that felt unnatural.

"You mean you're on the run." He muttered.

"You need somewhere to hide temporarily."

His blue eyes moved to my neck.

"You have a mate now. Where is he?"

"Why isn't he protecting you?"

"Doesn't matter." I muttered in annoyance.

I was furious with Julian.

I didn't know what he had done.

Or what had happened to him.

But I knew he was dying.

I could feel it intensely.

I couldn't link him anymore.

I couldn't read his thoughts either.

"What did you do, Seraphina?" Mum asked.

Her eyebrows shot up in concern.

"I fell in love with the wrong fucking man." I admitted.

Her eyes narrowed at my words.

I had hit a nerve clearly.

History has a habit of repeating itself.

"Watch your fucking tone." Caleb growled.

"This is our home now."

"You don't bring that attitude to our doorstep."
###Chapter 0289

I glare at him before turning to my mother. “I located her.”

“Who?” She frowns, confused.

“Dad’s precious little favorite.”

Her brown eyes widen slightly. She shakes her head. “That was years ago, Seraphina. You have to release the past.”

I knew she only said that because Caleb was standing right there. If we were alone, she’d be grinning. We both craved it. Deep down, I knew she still wanted payback for what my father did to her. What he did to us.

Caleb points a finger at me. “You’re completely insane. You know exactly who she is, right?”

“Yes. Everything I was supposed to become.”

He laughs. White-hot fury burns through my veins.

“You were never going to be an Alpha, Seraphina. Your father wasn’t an Alpha. It was all a lie, you foolish girl.” He jabs a thick finger against my temple. “Why can’t you get that through your thick skull?”

“He deceived you, Seraphina.” My mother whispers sadly. Where was her fury? Where was her rage?

“Are you truly that dumb?” Caleb shakes his head. “You’re a Blackwood. You could have led this small pack. But you ruined it with this wild obsession.”

I laugh, glancing at the surrounding houses. “There’s barely thirty people in this so-called pack. And my name is Seraphina Harrison.”

He laughs loudly. My mother just stares at me with profound sadness.

“You’d rather take your half-sister’s name than be proud of your own pack?”

“If it secures my rightful place.”

Caleb scoffs. “You’re utterly delusional. The apple didn’t fall far from the tree. And I’m not talking about your mother.”

“You’re saying I’m like my father.”

“Exactly like him. Why do you think your mother resented you for so long?!” He mocks.

“Mum?”

She turns away without a word. She retreats deeper into the house. Caleb glances over his shoulder. Then he glares at me. “You had an opportunity here, Seraphina. A fresh start. I was ready to accept you as my own. To give you a loving family. To provide everything you missed as a child. But you threw it all away over this foolish obsession. Now leave. You’re trespassing.” He slams the door in my face. My heart plummets. I truly believed my mother would welcome me back.

I retreat to my car. I watch the house for a long time. Caleb’s words echo in my mind. Occasionally, I see one of my brothers in the window. They never look at me. But they look so happy. A world apart from my own childhood.

My mother changed. She got everything she ever wanted. A happy, loving family. And I wasn’t part of it. A tear escapes. I quickly wipe it away. No crying. She moved on without me. Speeding down the road, Athena’s voice vibrates in my head. She calls all Lycans to Obsidian Howl. “Damn it!” My hands slam the steering wheel. I knew this day would arrive. Why did she wait until now?

I turn the car around. I head back to my mother’s house. I need to see if they will go. Athena’s request isn’t an order. But that could change. Then I’d be forced to go as well.

Would she have them killed because of me?

I stop at the end of the road. They are already loading bags into their car. My mother cradles the baby in her arms. Caleb moves back and forth. He slots things into the car like a game of tetris.

They aren’t the only ones. Every house has people loading cars. They are all going. They are all incredibly stupid.

I slam on my brakes. I block their car. My mother stares at me with wide eyes. She backs toward the house. My sister starts crying. “You’re making a huge mistake.” I mutter.

“It’s our decision.” He snaps back. He slams the car door shut with the boys inside. He starts to speak. Instead, he shakes his head in disbelief. “What the hell have you done, Seraphina?”

I’ve fought Wolves, Lycans, and Rogues for years. I’ve thrived on my own. Yet he always makes me feel like a powerless child. A child who did something terribly wrong. My usual strength and confidence evaporate completely.

“SERAPHINA!” Caleb growls. “What danger have you brought upon this pack?”

“I…”

“You didn’t just find her, did you?” He snarls.

“Let me speak to whoever is in charge.”

“You’re looking at him.”

“You’re in charge?” I ask with disgust.

“As voted by the pack. Now I must speak to the Lycan Alpha about the mess you created.”

“She will likely kill you.”

“Then our deaths will rest solely on your shoulders.”
###Chapter 0290
Athena

Brianna guided a sobbing woman into the office. The redhead clutched her chest, gasping for air as wide-eyed Brianna settled her into a chair.

"He can't hurt you now." Brianna reassured her.

The gunshot finally made sense. Lucas had killed another person. Someone he considered unworthy to even approach me. The mark on this woman's neck suggested the victim was her mate.

"I'm sorry." I murmured, knowing no words could ease the pain of losing one's mate. She must be in absolute agony.

"He's really dead?" She choked out between tears.

"Yes." Brianna gave her a gentle smile.

"Good!" The woman looked immensely relieved by the confirmation. Now I felt even more confused. "That bastard marked me when I received your link."

"You weren't his mate?" I asked as more questions flooded my mind.

'It's a trap.' Nyx muttered.

'You think everything is a trap.' I snapped back.

"No." The redhead mumbled. "I was sold to him."

Now I understood why Lucas had shot him. "You were sold?"

She lowered her gaze, her long red hair cascading over her face. "It's not the first time."

"You've been sold more than once?" Brianna muttered with clear disgust.

The woman nodded. "When I received your link, I saw an opportunity. I told him I had to come. That you had sent an order."

"He was a Wolf." Brianna added, explaining why the man hadn't heard my link.

"It was the only thing I could think of. But he marked me. Said he needed to keep tabs on me." She traced the mark on her neck with her fingers.

"Why didn't you just shift and kill him, Hannah?" Brianna pressed.

The woman's brows furrowed and she pressed her lips into a thin line. "I can't shift."

'Lies!' Nyx snapped.

"You can't?" I asked while trying to ignore my Lycan. I was beginning to feel something was seriously wrong with Nyx. Her moods swung wildly. She made me question myself constantly. She always tried to make me see the worst in everything. Sometimes it felt like I wasn't just fighting the darkness but her too.

Especially when she started hating my idea of linking everyone. Something she initially supported but suddenly changed her mind about.

Hannah shook her head and fidgeted with her waist-length hair. "I knew you would ask me that. I don't know the answer."

"Were you bound?" Her tears had finally stopped.

"No, I was just their plaything. I can do everything else. I heal fast, I'm quick. I have excellent smell and hearing. Obviously you can link me. I've just never been able to shift. I can prove the other things if you want. Do you have a knife?"

'Bullshit. She has to have been bound.' Nyx growled.

"You said you've been sold multiple times. Did any of them drug you?" I pressed.

She shook her head. "They didn't need to."

"What do you mean?"

"A long time ago, I learned that if I just did what they asked, they wouldn't hurt me."

I couldn't follow her logic at all. They bought her but didn't hurt her? Dominic, Victoria had found excuses to hit me for any reason, even when I complied.

"You had sex with them?" Brianna interrupted my thoughts. She looked horrified by the idea.

Hannah nodded. "It might sound crazy to you. But as long as I did that, they didn't hurt me. None of them did until...."

"Until Nathan?" Brianna asked.

Hannah's eyes dropped to the floor again. She had figured out how to survive. It sounded strangely like she had accepted what happened to her.

"How old were you when you were first sold?"

"A week short of fourteen. They gave me a year thinking maybe my ability to shift was late. When it didn't come...." She shrugged. "Your parents sold you?" Brianna frowned.

"Yep." She was surprisingly open with information. Not what I expected from someone who had endured that. It had taken me forever to share anything with Alexander. "I wasn't worthy of being their child."

She stood up and tossed her red hair over her shoulder. "Thank you for getting me out of that situation. You have no idea how much it means to me."

"More than you will ever realize." I muttered.

She gave me a smile while Nyx muttered something about reminding Hannah whose presence she was in.

"Can I ask why you wanted us to come here?"

"Have you heard of a Lycan called Seraphina?" Brianna asked.

She shook her head. "Not a name I know. But then I've spent the last ten years mostly around men."

"How did you know where Obsidian Howl was?" I asked. We weren't the easiest pack to find, especially for outsiders. "Nathan said he knew the Alpha here."

Brianna stood behind Hannah and shook her head at me. 'Alexander didn't act like he knew him' She linked me.
###Chapter 0291

‘You’re lying.’ Nyx presses.

‘If you don’t stop, I’ll find a way to shut you out,’ I snap at my Lycan.

“Can you get Alexander and Lucas?” I ask Brianna.

“Of course.”

Hannah’s eyes widen. Her heart starts racing again. “Are you going to let them shoot me?”

“Just need to check something.” I give her a small smile.

She sits quietly, twisting the ends of her hair while we wait.

Alexander is the first to arrive. He walks over and kisses my forehead. Hannah’s chestnut eyes follow the movement. A faint smile touches her lips.

“Where’s Lucas?”

“On his way. He was cleaning up.” Alexander tells me.

Hannah shudders, running her fingers through her hair. “He’s really dead?”

“Yes. Are you okay?”

“It hurts, but that’s because he marked me, right?”

I explain to Alexander that this Nathan guy wasn’t her true mate. He was keeping her like property. It made me furious. I’m a little disappointed she didn’t get to kill him herself. There’s nothing like watching the life fade from someone you despise.

I shake my head, closing my eyes. I focus on my sons, pushing the dark thoughts away. Then I catch Lucas’s scent.

“Blondie and the surfer are on guard,” he mutters. He watches me with an amused look. He’s always watching me.

“You mean Sebastian and Theodore,” Alexander corrects him.

“Right. They’ll signal when more Lycans arrive.” His hazel eyes shift to Hannah. “You told Athena you can’t shift?”

Her head whips around to glare at him. “How did you know that?”

Lucas smiles. “I know many things.” His gaze returns to me. “You wanted to see me?”

“What else do you know?” I’m still not entirely sure I believe everything he says. But he does know a lot.

He glances at her. “She’s clean.”

“What’s going on?” Hannah asks, her voice rising.

“Can you shift?” I repeat, keeping my eyes on Lucas.

“No, I swear.”

Lucas yawns. “She’s telling the truth.”

“Are you some kind of psychic?” Hannah mutters.

Lucas laughs. “No. I’m a Hunter.”

Hannah nearly falls off her chair scrambling backward. “You brought us here to be killed by a Hunter?” She demands, edging behind the desk toward me.

“You should fear me,” Lucas tells her. “But right now, you’re not on my list.” He winks at her.

She turns to me. “I know you’re the Alpha, but what are you thinking?”

Alexander growls. I hold up a hand to stop him.

“You know about Hunters?”

“Most Lycans do. So why is he here?”

“Lucas wants Seraphina dead. So do I. So do others,” I tell Hannah.

“Hunters kill our kind,” she sputters, her eyes darting between us. “You’re making a mistake. He’ll turn on you.”

Lucas laughs again. “Don’t make me reconsider, gingernut.”

“Luc!” Alexander snaps.

“I’ll be outside if you need me.”

“It’s fine.” I take a deep breath, watching Lucas leave with a grin. “Hannah, you don’t have to help us. You don’t even have to stay. But if you want to, you’re welcome.” I decided not to force anyone to help. Alexander and I disagree on that.

For so long, I wished Lycans would die out. Especially when I was told they were a dying breed. Then I got pregnant with my own Lycan sons.

“With him here?” Hannah’s voice climbs higher.

“You can stay with me,” Brianna offers.

Hannah slumps, looking around the office. She probably has nowhere to go. Not after being sold and passed around.

“Lucas wanted me to give you this,” Alexander mutters, dropping a wallet on the desk. “He took it from Nathan before burning the body. After all you’ve been through, he thinks you should have access to his money.”

“Why would he do that?” Her eyebrows shoot up. “He’s a Hunter. I’m a Lycan. He kills our kind. Is this a trick?”

“No one knows how his mind works,” Brianna mutters.

“I shouldn’t take it, should I?” Hannah asks quietly.

“Yes, you should. Think of it as compensation for what he did to you,” Brianna says happily.

Hannah slowly picks up the wallet. “He has millions.”

“I’ll have Theodore set up an account and transfer the funds,” Alexander smiles at her. “Welcome to Obsidian Howl.”
###Chapter 0292
Alexander

Brianna takes Hannah with her back to her house, leaving Athena and me alone.

"This is exhausting." Athena mumbles, a slight crease forming on her brow.

"You've only met half a dozen." I remind her, keeping my voice gentle. "We have no idea how many more might show up."

She rocks slowly in my chair, looking troubled. "Do you think Lucas did the right thing, shooting that other guy?"

"He saw exactly what I did with Nathan. That man had a tight grip on her arm, just like Dominic had on you when he opened that basement door. Every word she spoke was a cry for help, carefully worded, just like you used to do. We had to make sure she was safe before Luc took him out."

"Since when do you call him Luc?"

"He asked me to. Said only his mate calls him Lucas."

"You trust him, don't you?" She questions me, her eyes searching mine.

"He's an arrogant bastard, but he promised not to hurt you. Does that mean I trust him completely? No. But I can keep watch over him, and for now, that works."

"Ethan also said he wouldn't hurt me." She snaps, her voice sharp with memory. "And Lucas keeps giving everyone nicknames they hate. Why 'surfer boy' for Theodore?"

I smirk, remembering how much of the world remains unknown to her. She's learned so much since I found her, but there's still more to discover. "He looks like someone who hits the waves."

Her frown deepens, eyes narrowing in confusion. "I don't understand what that means!"

"I'll show you later." I press my lips to her soft cheek. 'Titan, remind me to show her some videos later.'

'Sure. Or maybe we can take her to the beach with the boys.' He has a point, but right now, there's too much happening.

"Why don't you go spend time with Isabella? You haven't seen much of her these past few days."

"She doesn't talk much anymore. Even Zachary can't pry her away from Julian." Her eyes soften as she looks at me. "You don't speak about him either. It's not good, is it?"

"It's complicated."

"It always is." Her shoulders slump as she leans back in the chair.

"In that case, come with me?"

She lets me lead her from the office and up the stairs. We don't even make it to the bedroom before I press her against the wall. She gasps as I pin her body between me and the wall. "You wanted something to take your mind off all the chaos. Right now, we have time alone."

I force her thighs apart with my knee, pressing my hardening cock against her as I drag my teeth along the mark on her neck.

"Alexander." She whispers, her beautiful blue eyes locking with mine as her lips part slightly. Her heartbeat quickens beneath my touch.

I mold myself against her, inhaling her sweet scent before capturing her lips with mine. She rolls her hips against me, pushing her breasts into my chest as her back arches off the wall.

Lifting her, she instinctively wraps her legs around my waist. I carry her into our room as her need for me grows. My cock strains painfully against my zipper. Her hands free me, gliding up and down my length as I drop her onto the bed.

"Athena." I growl as my dick jerks in her hands. She always had the perfect touch.

She releases me and unzips her hoodie, revealing nothing underneath. I take a nipple into my mouth, rolling it between my teeth as she moans and arches her back.

Her nails drag along my shoulder blades, sending shudders through me. My cock jerks against her pussy, only a thin layer of soaked fabric separating us.

Trailing my lips down her torso, I pull the leggings and lace panties from her dripping pussy. I admire how wet she always gets for me. Dragging my tongue across her clit, lapping up her juices, she bites her bottom lip to contain her moan. It escapes anyway.

As I slide a finger into her, she thrusts up against my face. She wants both my tongue and my fingers.

"Oh Alexander." She cries out, grabbing the back of my head. She holds me in place between her thighs as I suck and bite her clit. She arches her back again, crying out in delight as I plunge a second finger into her.
###Chapter 0293

Her muscles tightened around me.
She bit her bottom lip, releasing my hair as her eyes squeezed shut.
"Open those blue eyes or I stop," I growled, halting my movements.
She peered at me through narrowed slits, hips still rolling as she fought the rising climax.
"Look at me," I commanded.
Her eyes flew open wide.
I withdrew my fingers and thrust deep into her clenching heat.
Her nails dug into my arms, leaving crescent marks as she gritted her teeth.
Desperate moans escaped her lips while I spread her legs wider, driving into her without restraint.
I crushed my mouth against hers just as she shattered.
Her body convulsed against mine.
I kept my lips on hers, letting her moans vibrate between us until I could wait no longer.
I flipped her onto her stomach, pulling her hips back against me.
I slid into her swollen core once more.
A low moan escaped her as her face buried into the sheets, hands fisting the fabric for balance.
She glanced back at me over her shoulder.
That look drove me wild.
I slammed into her repeatedly, spanking her ass with each thrust until my own teeth clenched from the building pressure.
She screamed my name.

Athena sat at the opposite end of the bath, a content smile gracing her lips as water lapped against her chest.
Her knees were drawn up, claiming I took too much space.
I resisted reading her thoughts, honoring our agreement to only do so when concerned or during intimacy.
I watched her happy blue eyes slowly dim with sadness.
"Will we have to send them away?" she asked softly. "The boys?"
She nodded. "Last time we faced a threat, all children and elders left the pack temporarily."
"I won't send anyone away this time. They're safer here with us where we can protect them."
"Right."
I awaited the one question she hadn't asked since learning what Luc claimed to see.
Perhaps she didn't want to know. Perhaps she already knew.
"What about Lucas, when this ends? Do I just let him go?"
"That's something we'll discuss when the time comes."
"But you don't trust him. You said so yourself."
"And I stand by that."
A knock interrupted us.
I sighed inwardly. "Stay here," I muttered, rising from the bath.
Athena sank deeper into the bubbles as I wrapped a towel around my hips.
"What?" I yanked the door open to Theodore.
"More Lycans have arrived."
"How many?"
"A small pack. Thirty to forty."
"A pack of Lycans?" Athena called out.
"Their Alpha says they're called Silverwood Pack," Theodore shouted back.
That couldn't be right.
According to Luc, Silverwood was wiped out...
Though Seraphina's mother escaped, perhaps others did too.
"We'll be there shortly. Take Zachary and Sebastian and ensure Luc..."
"They're already with them." He dashed down the hallway.
I turned to find Athena already out of the bath and dressing.
"Are you sure you're ready for this?"
She nodded. "I asked them to come."
We headed to the training hall.
Unfamiliar cars crowded the entrance while arguments erupted inside.
More Wolves lingered outside, awaiting instructions.
Athena didn't hesitate, tearing the door open and marching in.
A bald man with intense blue eyes approached us.
He avoided looking directly at Athena.
He offered his hand to me, introducing himself as Caleb.
As I shook it, he yanked me forward and whispered, "Why the hell is there a Hunter here?"
"Precautions," I muttered back.
My eyes quickly found Luc.
He circled the training hall like a predator.
His gaze darted between each Lycan, making them shift nervously like startled fish trying to evade danger.
"Has anyone here gone Rogue?" I asked Caleb.
"No, not a single one of us," he stated confidently.
"Then you have nothing to worry about."
"Wait, what do you mean 'not any of us'?" Athena pressed. "Are there more of you?"
His thick brows furrowed deeply.
"He's talking about his stepdaughter," Luc muttered as he joined us. "Seraphina Blackwood."
###Chapter 0294
Zachary

“It was inevitable. But Seraphina led me to believe her family was deceased.” I murmur to Sebastian.

“My thoughts exactly.” He scans the room vigilantly. I anticipated resentment over me taking his former pack position, but he appears content with his secondary Beta role.

A woman navigates through the gathering, clutching an infant while two young boys grip her dress. They’re miniature replicas of the man conversing with Alexander. I recognize the woman from the photograph Seraphina gave Athena. Seraphina’s mother.

We advance as Lucas departs to circle the training hall again. He shoots me a quick wink before refocusing on the crowd of Lycans.

Seeing this many in one place feels surreal. My previous experience involved only a dozen Rogues, a minuscule number compared to this gathering, likely even fewer than expected. The bald man mentioned they’re a small pack.

“We need to clarify that we,” the bald man gestures to the assembled Lycans, “had no involvement in Seraphina’s actions.”

“She appeared a few days ago, right before we received your mind-link. Seeking shelter. She’s not welcome in our home.” Seraphina’s mother adds.

“Why?” Athena inquires.

The woman holding the infant stops before her. “She endangered us all. Years ago, she nearly led a Hunter to our doorstep.” She glances over her shoulder. “Actually, it was him. He was hunting her. Before her recent appearance, we hadn’t seen her in over five years. We knew she was alive, but that was all.”

“She blames me for our father’s actions.” Athena informs her.

The woman reaches out, cupping Athena’s face. “I know, and I’m deeply sorry for that.”

“It’s not your fault.” Athena sighs. “You were unaware, and from what I understand, my father deceived you too.”

“He did. And there’s something else you should know. Your—”

“Zoe and I tried to reason with her.” Caleb interrupts, giving his mate a peculiar look. “My mate took years to recover from what he did to her, but Seraphina could never let go. She never even knew the man, yet she’s devoted her life to an impossible vendetta. I regret to say only death will stop her.”

A tear trails down the woman’s cheek at Caleb’s final words. Admitting that your child’s death is the only solution must be agonizing. But everyone seems to overlook the interrupted revelation from Seraphina’s mother. Or perhaps I’m imagining things.

“Did she know you were coming here?” Alexander asks.

“She had already come to us that morning, and we sent her away. She reappeared while we were packing the car. I assume she heard the mind-link too. She tried to阻止 us, but if there’s any chance to protect my children from her, I’ll do whatever necessary.” Caleb explains.

“She is your child too.” I mutter, testing Zoe.

“She ceased being that long ago.”

“They’re telling the truth.” Lucas murmurs as he passes by again. He continues moving, causing the Lycan crowd to shift from one side of the hall to the other as they maintain distance.

Caleb’s deep blue eyes track Lucas. “I’m uncertain why he’s here, but Silverwood is not the pack it once was. We reside in the suburbs. Most of us have jobs and families to support.” He gestures to the others. “Some rarely shift due to the risk of exposure.”

It was the life Brianna had dreamed of.

“Did Seraphina mention any plans?” I question.

“No. Though she claimed you would kill us. I told her if we died, the blame would rest on her.” Caleb shakes his head. “That girl had immense potential for good, and she wasted it.”

“Because she turned Rogue.” Athena mutters.

“Yes, she discovered what happened to the original Silverwood Pack that her mother belonged to.” Caleb reaches out, squeezing his mate’s shoulder. “She completely lost herself in her own delusions. It was something neither of us comprehended. How can someone be so obsessed with rectifying past wrongs that have nothing to do with them?”
###Chapter 0295

"She believes it will improve her image." Athena responds without turning toward them. "To cast herself as the hero." "To appear deserving of the Alpha title." Alexander adds.

"I tried." Zoe murmurs. "I tried everything and..."

"This isn't on you." Caleb tells her. "Many attempted to guide her. We can't force help on those who refuse it."

"SILENCE!" Athena shrieks, and the room falls utterly still.

"Remove her from here!" Lucas commands sharply.

"I'll handle her!" I state firmly. "You remain here," I instruct Alexander, hoisting Athena over my shoulder and swiftly exiting the training hall.

"Release me, Zachary." Her fists pound against my lower back as I carry her across the grounds. I desperately hope she doesn't shift. Her Lycan form could shred my back in moments.

"Not until we're inside the house." I mutter, securing my grip around her legs to prevent kicking.

"Zachary!" Her voice is dangerously low. I set her down the instant we cross the threshold, slamming the door shut behind us. Her eyes are completely black as she glares at me.

"Move aside!"

"Athena," I grasp her face, forcing her to meet my gaze. "Don't release her. Remember your boys. They need you. They need their mother. You cannot let her win." She stares back, a faint ring of blue emerging around her pupils. "My babies need their mother." She whispers.

"Exactly. And Alexander needs you. The Lycans need you."

She presses her temples, eyes shutting tightly. When they reopen, her usual eye color has returned. "It's her, isn't it? She is my darkness."

"We think so." I've suspected this for a long time. Each person's darkness is unique, triggered by different things, but Athena's seemed to be her own Lycan spirit. Lucas was convinced. "Why did you tell her to be quiet?"

"She constantly accuses everyone of lying. Tells me to kill them. Warns me not to trust them. Sometimes she talks over what I'm trying to hear and..."

"The words just blend into a muffled noise?"

"Yes. It makes it impossible to hear anything else. How did you know that?"

"You were close." I've been discreetly monitoring her since we first realized she was nearing Rogue status. She occasionally discussed it or asked questions, but mostly I observed from afar. And until today, I'd never heard her yell at her Lycan.

She throws her hands up, stepping back from me. "How can I possibly lead Lycans as an Alpha when I can't even control my own mind?"

I can't believe I'm actually considering it. But that arrogant hunter knows infinitely more about Lycans than I do, especially the purebloods. I can't believe I'm contemplating asking for his assistance.

Athena is pacing the office when Lucas raps his knuckles against the open door.

"Where's Alexander?" I ask, glancing out into the large hall.

"Speaking with the other Lycans." He replies, but his focused frown is directed at the pacing Athena. "She's still very close to the surface."

"Why do you think I'm still stationed here?"

"Has she said anything?" He continues to watch her movements.

"She asked me if Nyx is her darkness. I confirmed it." He finally looks at me. "How do we address this? How do we prevent her Lycan from shattering her?" "We don't." He returns his gaze to tracking her pacing.

"Are you completely insane?"

"You're misunderstanding me, Rogue. Her soul is unlike any other I've encountered. Perhaps it's the bloodline, I'm still uncertain. But what I do know is that Athena is the sole person who can control her Lycan."

"I can hear you." Athena snaps.

"It wasn't meant to be a secret." Lucas smirks at her, and I intensely want to punch his face.

She stops directly in front of us. Hands on her hips, she drags her teeth over her bottom lip. "She doesn't control my abilities, does she?" "No." Lucas answers.

"But she only manifested when....." Her voice trails off, cheeks flushing. "And then everything else developed around the same time. The enhanced senses. The hearing."

"If that were true, and she controlled that aspect of you, every Wolf and Lycan would possess an inner spirit." He informs her.

"Right?!" She resumes pacing. "Can I bind her?"
###Chapter 0296
Lucas Adler

"Is it even possible?" Athena demands, her patience clearly wearing thin as she waits for my response.

"No, Athena. That's absolutely not an option." Zachary tells her firmly. "You've survived four bindings already. You should be dead. Trying again would likely kill you for real this time."

"I'm not talking about binding myself. I'm asking if binding her has ever been done before?" Her head jerks slightly and she squeezes her eyes shut. The darkness keeps flowing in and out as she battles her inner spirit, but now I finally understand how it's working.

It seeps into her fractures, moving through them like water following a river's path. But it reaches dead ends with nowhere to go, forcing the darkness to retreat and try another route.

The cracks don't connect, making her Lycan push harder. Was this her goal? To break Athena in any way possible. I've never seen darkness operate so strategically. A soul's darkness doesn't usually have intelligence behind it. It doesn't get years to develop and plan.

I couldn't help but wonder what her Lycan's ultimate plan was. Turn her Rogue and then what? She'd be incapable of leadership, unless she convinced others to turn Rogue. The world would be doomed.

"She hasn't been with you long, has she?" I needed more information.

"Before my pregnancy." Her frown deepens. "Less than two years. Why does that matter?"

"And you're twenty-three now?"

"Yes, why? What does my age have to do with anything?"

Her Lycan has had years to simmer, trying to break through. It must be furious that it took so long to communicate with Athena. The truth is, they're always present. They just can't break through until the host matures. In Athena's case, it took even longer. "Just filling in the gaps." I murmur quietly.

"Well?" She asks me, her big blue eyes pleading. "Please tell me it's possible!"

I shake my head. It's not something I've ever encountered in all my Hunter knowledge. But then her Bloodline is exceptionally rare too. I'll have to ask that surfer boy about the book supposedly written by her ancestor. Maybe there are more clues about her nature.

"So it will happen. Eventually, I'll become the very thing I despise." Her face falls, tears glistening in her eyes.

I expected Zachary to reassure her that we'd find a solution. But even he remains silent, considering if her prediction might be true.

The blackness of her soul continues retreating until it's barely visible at the edges again. I knew her Lycan could hear every word I said, which is why I hadn't discussed what Nyx was doing to her. I didn't want to give her Lycan any ideas, and I really didn't want to have to put Athena down to stop her.

I wouldn't get my answers if she died. I wouldn't be able to prepare Charlotte for the future Lycan Alphas she'll need to confront.

"So what can she do?" Zachary asks me.

"I thought you didn't believe me." I raise an eyebrow at him.

"Not about everything, but I can't deny your knowledge about Lycans." He mutters grudgingly. I could tell it cost him to admit that. Even if he looked like he wanted to punch me the entire time.

"I need to review my family's records." I mutter, thinking there might be something I overlooked.

"I need to see my boys." Athena says firmly.

Zachary gives her a warm smile. "That's an excellent idea. I'll take you to them."

"Stay with her." I add as they prepare to leave. If she was going to turn Rogue, everyone needed to be prepared.

Everyone thinks standard Rogues are dangerous, but dealing with one that has a bloodline like hers would be something entirely different.

As they head toward wherever her sons are being kept, I return to the training hall. Alexander is still speaking with the Lycans while Sebastian and Theodore chat with some pups.
###Chapter 0297

A cold shudder runs through me.

The last time I was surrounded by this many Lycans, I was hunting Seraphina.

My instincts are screaming.

Hunting is in my blood.

Not slaughtering this breed is harder than I expected.

Especially when they’re so available.

Tension thickens as the Lycans notice my return.

But so far, none show hostility.

Their souls are clear.

It’s almost irritating.

Even Seraphina’s family radiates purity.

“Should I go to her?” Alexander asks as I approach.

“Zachary is with her.”

His eyebrows lift. “You used his actual name.”

He scans the crowd. “Are we clear here?”

“Annoyingly, yes.”

“Good.” He turns toward the people.

I see his hesitation before he delivers Athena’s message.

“Athena has stated that if you do not wish to help, you are free to leave. No judgment. Those who stay, follow me to your temporary quarters.”

The past few days, the Wolves cleared trees and built log cabins beside the pack.

I told them it was a stupid idea.

But the order came from Athena.

I didn’t argue.

Whispers travel among the adults.

Caleb steps forward. “We are in agreement.” He glances at his mate, Zoe, who nods. “Seraphina must be stopped.”

Blondie and surfer boy lead them toward the cabins.

Alexander stays with me. “I feel what I feel for Athena. But I need the truth. How bad is it?”

“Catastrophically bad.” I keep my voice steady.

His face tightens.

I explain what I saw.

The darkness seeping through old trauma cracks.

“I thought she had more control over her Lycan. But the unconnected cracks are holding it back.”

“Zachary and Brianna…”

“They don’t have cracks like Athena. Small ones from their human past, yes. But nothing like hers. Nyx is exploiting those fractures. At first, I thought she was trying to overtake Athena. Now I believe she’s trying to fill them. Make them whole. Claim them.”

“Embed the darkness inside her.”

“Exactly. But Athena made a request. One I can’t answer.”

“What?”

“She asked if her Lycan could be bound.”

His crimson eyes widen. Then narrow to slits. “That would kill her.”

“It still might. She’s endured enough.”

“I know Lycans. I’ve hunted them most of my life. I can see and read souls. But I can’t see those who aren’t present. What I can do is dig.”

“You should speak to Theodore. He’s skilled at uncovering information.”

“Perfect. I’ll find him.”

“And don’t call him surfer boy. Unless you want that punch you’ve been waiting for.”
###Chapter 0298
Athena

Zachary knocks on the door and offers me a tense smile. I understood his protective instincts, but his constant presence still made me slightly uncomfortable.

Sebastian's mother, Charlotte, opens the door with Logan balanced on her hip. "Athena, perfect timing. Come with me." She immediately grasps my wrist and pulls me inside where Sebastian's father, William, is cheering Evrin on as he attempts to walk.

I watch my son wobble forward a few steps before plopping down on his bottom. William applauds enthusiastically while both Evrin and Logan mimic him with excited clapping. I can only imagine how Alexander's parents had reacted during his own childhood milestones.

A genuine smile spreads across my face, washing away all my earlier anxieties. Logan had started walking confidently just days ago, and now Evrin was joining him. Both were early walkers, something Lucas had attributed to their strong Lycan genes.

William and Charlotte never treated the boys differently because of their Lycan heritage. They insisted my sons were just like any other children. Over time, they had naturally become the unofficial grandparents to my twins.

I didn't mind this arrangement. Neither Alexander nor I had living parents.

Logan and Evrin adored them as much as William and Charlotte adored the boys. They were always happy to watch the twins without asking unnecessary questions.

I scoop Evrin up into a warm hug, breathing in his sweet cinnamon scent. He nuzzles against me as Zachary asks if I'm feeling better.

I had momentarily forgotten his presence. "Yes."

Charlotte takes my hand gently. "Is the darkness returning?"

"Nothing my boys can't fix." I give her the same response every time. I knew her concern came from genuine care. I also knew she would contact Alexander immediately if she ever believed the boys were unsafe with me. The fact that she hadn't done so yet gave me hope that she never would.

"Any updates on the Lycans?" William questions Zachary.

"Last I checked, they were still in the training hall with Alexander and the others." Zachary replies.

"The Hunter hasn't shot anyone yet?"

"No. I believe you would have heard the commotion if he had." William and Charlotte lived closest to the training grounds.

"They all appear to be alive." Charlotte is peering out the window. "But they're definitely on the move now."

William joins her at the window. "Looks like those empty cabins will finally be put to use."

Charlotte elbows him playfully, and he responds with a wink. Their interaction reminds me so much of how Alexander looks at me.

"I should take the boys home now." I thank them for watching the twins.

"Are you certain?" Charlotte asks with concern. "Your Hunter friend is moving separately from the group."

Zachary bolts out the door like a shot. I hand Evrin back to William. "I'll return as soon as possible."

Zachary is already confronting Lucas, demanding to know his destination.

"Going to consult someone about a book." Lucas doesn't break his stride.

"Why?" Zachary persists as I catch up to them.

"Curiosity."

"I'll need more explanation than that."

Lucas stops abruptly. He slowly turns his head toward Zachary. "It was suggested to me. If you have an issue with that, I suggest you take it up with Alexander."

His answer surprises me. "Alexander told you to speak with Theodore?"

"I heard surf boy is quite skilled with research. I'm going to consult him about possibly assisting with your request." "Oh."

"Perhaps I should accompany you." Zachary mutters.

"Unnecessary. Surf boy is a Wolf, and I'm perfectly capable of handling my own business." A flash of anger appears in Zachary's eyes. "Maybe you should go assist Alexander instead."

Zachary's jaw tightens, his cheeks pulsing with restrained emotion. He keeps his fists at his sides through visible effort. He stalks away before his rage can fully surface.

"Why?" I murmur. "Why do you provoke him like that?"

"It's nothing." He snaps at me. His harsh tone catches me off guard. Even when threatening others, his voice usually remained measured, laced with amusement and sarcastic commentary. Now something entirely different simmered beneath the surface.
###Chapter 0299

"Did my darkness—"

"No." He cuts me off before I can finish.

"Did something happen?" Athena had confirmed there were no casualties.

"Stop worrying about my problems, Athena."

"Is Charlotte alright?"

"Charlotte is perfectly fine. Drop it!" He resumes walking, forcing me to sprint to match his pace.

"What's wrong?" Something terrible must have occurred, but Lucas was more than capable of handling himself. I'd witnessed his skills multiple times.

He halts abruptly. "I came here to complete a job. That job remains my priority. I'll assist you with this other issue. After that, Charlotte and I are leaving." He glares upward at the sky. "You're testing my patience!"

I consider asking who he's addressing, but decide against it. When Lucas starts moving again, I remain rooted in place.

'He's planning to kill us all.' Nyx whispers. 'Secrets are easier to keep when you eliminate the witnesses.'

I shut my eyes, attempting to block her out, when Alexander's scent approaches me.

He comes up behind me. His hands slide over my hips and interlock firmly. "We'll find a solution to this."

"I hope you're right." I whisper back. "I'm just—"

"They'll figure it out. We'll figure it out."

"It's not that. Lucas is acting strange."

"Luc is always strange." He presses his lips against my neck.

"Stranger than usual." I mutter. Something was definitely wrong.

"Maybe he's irritated because he didn't get to kill anyone today. If he's been hunting daily for twenty years, this must feel incredibly dull for him."

"Well, Charlotte?" I ask as she settles beside me in the office.

"I think I like them."

"Are you certain?"

She studies the women seated across the desk. She licks her bottom lip thoughtfully and nods.

Lucas had nearly broken down the door to drag the man out while I placed headphones over his daughter's ears.

Three weeks had passed since the first Lycans arrived. Now we had several hundred from various backgrounds, and so far, no problems had arisen.

Charlotte leans across the desk, offering stickers to the women who watch her with fascination. "You passed." Charlotte beams at them. "You need to wear these so my Daddy can see."

They raise their eyebrows at her. "You may go." I tell them. "One of the men will show you to your accommodations." I worried about endangering Charlotte by allowing her to meet the Lycans. She was a Hunter's daughter.

"Can I see Daddy now?" She asks while neatly organizing her stickers.

"Lucas isn't back yet, and Zachary is with Isabella." It was often unclear which father she meant, as she called both 'Daddy,' much to Lucas's annoyance. It also made them compete for her attention.

"Is he forgetting about me again?" Her lower lip protrudes.

"No, he never forgot you before. You were just very difficult to find." Her brow furrows. "And he promised he'd return by dinner."

She glances at the clock, though she can't tell time well, and puffs out her cheeks. "Can I go play?"

"Of course." She hops off the chair, abandoning her stickers, and dashes past Brianna entering the room.

Brianna takes the seat opposite me and sighs heavily. She had started visiting the office to sit in silence, especially when we were alone. It took time, but I was finally growing accustomed to Brianna's presence. Though today, she seemed particularly dejected.
###Chapter 0300

"Is everything alright with Sebastian?"

"He wants children." She doesn't hesitate at all.

"And you don't?"

"It's not that. His boys died not long ago. I know they weren't biologically his, but he raised them."

"You think he's trying to replace them?"

"I'm not sure. I mean... I never imagined having kids in my life, ever. Then I was mated to Sebastian and everything spiraled..."

"I never pictured myself with children either."

Her brown eyes lock intensely with mine. "But you're an amazing mother. I turned out just like my father—what if I pass that on?"

"You do realize who you're talking to, right? My parents had me bound twice. My uncle had me bound twice. My parents tried to abandon me. How do you think I felt about having the twins?"

"Point taken." she murmurs.

"Just talk to him."

"Good idea."

She doesn't move.

"Is there something else?"

She taps the armrest with the side of her fist. "I think... I think Lucas might need to check on Hannah again."

"Why?"

"She hasn't said anything. But she's been acting strange the past couple weeks. Some days she refuses to leave the house, muttering about someone finding her. Other days she's perfectly fine and acts like her normal self."

"She was in a traumatic hostage situation."

"But the guy is dead. And no one else has come here looking for her."

'Told you.' Nyx murmurs. 'She is plotting to kill us.'

'Not everyone is a murderer.' I snap back.

'But you are Athena. You enjoy watching them lose their life. You like to see their heart stop beating.'

'And I can't wait to watch you die.' I growl at my Lycan.

She finally stops talking to me.

"I'll come over." I tell Brianna. "Is she home now?"

"I think so."

Hannah is sitting in a corner of the kitchen. Her knees are pulled up to her chest with her arms locked tightly around them. Her chestnut eyes dart up to meet mine and I notice how sweaty she is. "Is she sick?"

"Shouldn't she heal?"

"He's watching me." Hannah mutters.

"Who?"

"He's always watching. It's wrong. It can't happen. He's watching."

Brianna looks at me with a face that clearly screams 'help'.

"Hannah, who is watching you?" I press.

"My mate." She whispers as her eyes bulge and she begins to rock back and forth.

"The guy who marked you is dead." Brianna crouches down beside her.

“Nathan's dead. Nathan's dead." Hannah mutters over and over. Her words drop to a terrified whisper. “He will kill me."

"Who?"

"My mate!"

Brianna stands up and pulls me aside. "Do you think we need to take her to the hospital? It seems like she's lost her mind."

"I'll link Zachary to come help."

Zachary puts Hannah on a hospital bed and pulls Isabella away from Julian. Hannah continues muttering about her mate killing her as Isabella gives her a quick examination.

Isabella grabs a syringe from the drawer and jabs Hannah, who eventually passes out.

"What's wrong with her?" I ask.

"It seems she has the same issues you had." Isabella mutters emotionlessly. All this time she's been spending at Julian's bedside wasn't helping her. She was becoming a hollow version of herself. She turns to leave.

"What is that supposed to mean?" I push.

"She fears her new mate." she glances back at Hannah, "She'll be out for a few hours. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to spend time with my brother."

"Her new mate?" I turn to Brianna and ask if Hannah had been seeing anyone.

“No, like I said she'll leave the house for a couple days and then spend days inside."

"Like she's avoiding someone."

"I guess."

There was only one person that was in and out of the pack for days at a time. I almost wanted to laugh. Hannah is a Lycan, the very thing he hated.
###Chapter 0301
Athena

"Charlotte is waiting for you." I murmur as Lucas approaches the house with a shotgun resting on his shoulder. He looked furious, like he had just received the worst news imaginable. He had only just returned.

"Right." He dips his head at me. "I should go see her." A faint smile appeared but it didn't soften his expression. Instead, it made him seem more menacing. What happened out there?

“And your mate is in the hospital.” I add as he brushes past me.

He freezes, but maintains his composure. "My mate died. I will never have another mate."

"We both know that's not how it works. Zachary is Isabella's second chance mate. Perhaps it's your turn now."

He slowly turns to face me. "I don't know what you think you know, Athena. I. Do Not. Have. A. Mate!"

Denial.

His hazel eyes narrow. "My mate was my everything. No one could ever replace her. Understand?"

I nod, though Hannah had already confirmed it was him. The moment she was coherent, she gave me his name. 'Lucas Adler, the Hunter'. There's only one of him.

As soon as she said it, my suspicions were confirmed.

It explained why she panicked when he was near and calmed when he was gone. All because she believed he would kill her. That possibility still remained very real.

Tears had streamed down her face as she asked me how she could be mated to a Hunter. She asked why she was being punished this way. What had she done to deserve a mate like him? I had no answers for her. I was still trying to understand why Lycans were being paired with Wolves at all.

"How long have you been back?" He must have been nearby for Hannah to sense him and panic.

"I just returned." He replies coldly.

"Really? You haven't been lurking in the forest, watching Brianna's home? Her house backs onto the woods."

His face becomes unreadable as he stares at me. He was skilled at hiding his thoughts during conversations. Less so when he was alone.

"I am not, nor will I ever be mated to another, especially not a fucking Lycan."

"You didn't answer my question."

"Because it didn't require an answer. I've been away, solving your problems." He jabs a finger in my direction.

I roll my eyes. His denial was extreme. “Then why not just reject her instead of torturing her?"

"I don't know what you're talking about Athena." He shakes his head. "To reject someone would mean I need to be mated to them. As I've told you, I am not mated to her." He spits on the ground, making his feelings perfectly clear.

"She told me, Lucas."

"It's a lie."

"Why would she lie about something like that?"

"Why don't you ask her? You're her leader." His answers are short and sharp.

"I will."

His brow furrows. His hand tightens around the gun on his shoulder. "Or perhaps I should visit her myself. End her misery. Especially if she's spreading these lies."

"You won't do that!" I warn him.

"Try me." He growls back. "You know I'm not afraid to put a bullet in someone. Now if you'll excuse me, my little girl is waiting for me." He strides into the house, plastering a grin on his face for Charlotte.

I glance across the grounds where Brianna is sitting on her small porch with a cup, watching me. 'He's denying it.' I mutter through our link.

'I understand.' She tells me. 'He is a Hunter, she is a Lycan. I don't know what's happening.'

'He's in denial. Or perhaps this is his way of torturing Hannah.'

'No, not him. The Moon Goddess pairs us, right? Why would she do this?'

I don't know if she could see my movement, but I shrug. I turn to face the house, considering my next move. I didn't want a gun pointed at me again.
###Chapter 0302

"You heard?" Theodore's sudden appearance made me jump.

"Heard what?" His expression was grim. "Judging by your face, I assume you discovered it's impossible."

"Actually, my discovery has little to do with you and everything to do with me."

"You?"

"It shocked me too." He avoided my gaze. "Remember our first conversation?"

I frowned, thinking back to that nerve-wracking encounter. "About your binding?"

He nodded slowly. "And that I was born into another pack. Or so I believed."

"You weren't?"

"I was, but not truly part of it." He sank onto the steps. "Brax and I just returned from investigating. My parents were infiltrators."

"Infiltrators? Why?"

"According to Brax, Rogues attacked that pack ten years ago."

"Your parents?"

"My birth parents died right after I was born. The couple who raised me and later bound me were pack members. They died in that attack. The Luna confirmed it."

"They killed your parents? Because they infiltrated?"

"My birth mother was heavily pregnant with me. She begged for help. The Alpha and Luna provided it."

"You said they infiltrated?" I whispered.

"Wrong word choice. My parents warned the Alpha and Luna about an impending Lycan attack. Nobody believed them because Lycans were considered myths. The Alpha thought it was a trap. When my mother went into labor, he ordered their execution. A childless Omega took me in. She and her husband bound me when I became a threat."

"You're no threat, Theodore. You only want to help people."

"Now, yes. Being here changed me. Having support and a home. My life was different before meeting Alexander. If my parents had lived, I might have turned out like Brax."

"Don't say that. You're nothing like him."

"But I am. Athena, my parents were Hunters. That's how they knew about the Lycan attack. That's how they knew the pack was in danger."

"You're joking." He shook his head. "You're not a Hunter. You don't hate Lycans. You enjoy time with my sons. I've seen you talking with Zachary. You're not a Hunter."

"It shocked me too." He lowered his head, eyes filled with sorrow.

"You can see souls?"

"No." He shook his head again.

"Lucas mentioned knowledge passed through blood. You've never..."

"I suspected you weren't a Wolf when we met. Beyond the binding, you were different in ways I couldn't pinpoint. How do think I found those books about your kind so easily?"

"You were already researching?"

He nodded with a faint smile.

"Nature versus nurture, I suppose. I never knew Hunters existed. I was always a quiet child. Bullied for not having a Wolf for years. Perhaps being raised outside that life made my brain forget." He smiled weakly. "If you haven't noticed, I'm not much of a killer either."

"Does Alexander know?"

"I wanted to tell you first. I don't want you worrying about the twins' safety around me. I prefer keeping this part quiet because I don't identify as a Hunter."

I nodded slowly. "Are you related to Lucas then?"

"Not that I know, and he doesn't think so. He's not the only Hunter, Athena."

Why had I never considered that? 'Because you can be stupid,' Nyx muttered. She had been quiet lately, but this conversation clearly interested her. "So there are more." I scowled, ignoring my Lycan.

"Yes, and they could become a problem, especially if they learn Lycans are coming here."

"We'll be sitting targets."

###Chapter 0304
Seraphina

I slid into the booth, my body heavy with exhaustion. A waiter appeared instantly, placing a glass of wine before me. It had been too long since I last visited this place. My eyes scanned the room, half expecting Julian to walk through the door. This was where we first met.

He wouldn't be coming tonight. The thought twisted like a knife in my chest. I gave him everything. I built him up from nothing. This was how he repaid me. The bar was overflowing with Wolves and Lycans. Far more than I felt comfortable with.

"Busy tonight?" The waiter attempted conversation. He quickly retreated when my sharp glare made my desire for solitude clear.

The rich, red wine burned down my throat. I released a heavy, frustrated sigh. All my carefully laid plans were crumbling around me.

I never minded being alone before Julian. He carved a path straight into my heart. I was free to move and act as I pleased. My only responsibility was to myself. Then he had to walk through those damn doors.

My fingers brushed against the mark on my neck. I jerked my jacket collar higher. I had surrendered to him. I broke my most important vow. Now I have no idea what's happening to him.

Are they drugging him? Have they found a way to block our mental link? I can feel him clinging on. That's the only thing I know for certain. Is he locked in a dungeon, starving to death?

So many questions with no answers. I despise being kept in the dark.

The waiter placed another glass of red wine on my table. "I didn't order this, you idiot!"

Annoyance flashed in the wolf's eyes, but his face remained neutral. He nodded toward a man at the bar. Another Lycan. "It's from him." "Take it back to him." I pushed the glass away, but the waiter had already vanished. I straightened my back, hearing a faint crack. I finished my wine, ready to leave. The Lycan from the bar stepped in front of me. "Hey. You look like you're heading to Obsidian Howl. Mind if I tag along?" His voice was a low, tempting rasp. But it was his scent that truly called to me. Leather and tobacco.

A dry laugh escaped me. I shook my head, trying to ignore the pull of his aroma. "I'm not going there." Not yet, anyway. I needed a better strategy if she was gathering every Lycan she could find.

"Aren't you curious about the female Alpha?" His sage green eyes, speckled with blue, studied me intently.

I snorted. "I've already met her. She's not impressive."

He ran a hand over the stubble on his chin. "Why not?"

"Why do you care?"

He slid into my booth, trapping me. His scent of leather and tobacco hit me with overwhelming force. It stole the breath from my lungs. This was inevitable with so many Lycans gathering. But I was already claimed. Any move from him could destroy me.

"My whole life, I've heard stories. Stories about an Alpha like no other. We never knew when she would appear. Not until we felt that call." His husky voice sent a shiver straight down my spine. I fought to maintain my composure. It didn't matter that he was my fated mate. I was mated to Julian. I had given myself to Julian completely. I would get him back.

"You believe that nonsense."

He nodded slowly. "Don't you?"

I let out another derisive snort. He slid the glass of wine he'd sent over across the table until it stopped right in front of me.

"Not a fan of the Alpha concept?"

"No. Not her, at any rate."

He raised an eyebrow at me, then nodded. "I still want to meet her."

"You'd be wasting your time." I took a large gulp of the wine. I didn't want it to confirm my desire for him. I just needed the throbbing in my head to stop.

He smirked. The blue flecks in his eyes seemed to glow brighter. "Does she not like you?"

"It's more complicated than that."

"Right." He suddenly grabbed my chin, forcing my face toward his.

"Don't." I shoved his hand away.

"Too public?" He mused.

I yanked my jacket aside, revealing the claim mark on my collarbone. His eyes darkened instantly. "You let another man claim you!" He growled, the sound low and dangerous.
###Chapter 0305

"Don't you dare speak to me like that." My gaze locks fiercely with his. "I've eliminated men like you before breakfast."

"Then I'll have no choice but to eliminate him."

"Good luck with that. He's the Alpha's mate's brother."

"What kind of trouble have you dragged yourself into?" he demands.

"Nothing beyond my capabilities." I slide out from the booth, feeling slightly dizzy. My back cracks audibly as I stretch. He asks how long it's been since my last shift.

"None of your concern." I scrutinize him as he stands to follow me. I didn't know his name. I wasn't sure I cared. I wanted Julian back—the man I truly knew.

He seizes the front of my jacket, yanking me against him. His eyes close as he inhales my scent. Foolishly, I allow it. "I don't even know your name," he whispers, and all thoughts of Julian vanish.

"Seraphina," I mutter, surprised by my own response. I couldn't use Harrison—he'd see through it. "Seraphina Blackwood."

I hadn't used that name in years. It felt foreign on my tongue.

"Pleasure to meet you, Seraphina Blackwood." He flashes a dazzling smile, revealing perfectly straight white teeth. "I'm Levi. Levi Bennett. Most call me Lev."

"You can't interfere," I murmur, my heart racing.

"Doesn't mean I can't keep an eye on you."

"I can't do this." I push his hands away from my jacket. He was here for Athena.

He frowns, stepping back. "She wants you dead, doesn't she? What did you do, Seraphina?"

"None of your damn business!"

"I'm making it my business." His intense gaze feels like it's pulling the truth from me. I can't allow that.

"Back off!" I snap, turning toward the door. The cool night air hits me as I step outside. His hand closes around my wrist, spinning me back to face him.

"Not until you tell me what mess you're in. Did you do something to the Alpha?"

I remain silent.

"His mate?"

I press my lips tighter, willing him to leave.

"You attacked her?"

I shut my eyes, blocking out his questions.

He falls silent. When I open my eyes, Levi is shaking his head. "I, Levi Bennett, reject you, Seraphina Blackwood, as my mate."

My mouth opens, but no sound emerges. Shock, perhaps? Rejection was the last thing I expected.

"Accept my rejection!" he commands.

"But—"

"Like you said, Seraphina. You have a mate." His words drip with venom.

"I, Seraphina Blackwood, accept your rejection." The scent of tobacco and leather fades the moment the words leave my lips. He smells like any other Lycan now. Shaking his head, he walks away.

A sharp spasm tears through my chest as the bond shatters. I should be relieved. I have Julian. I will get him back. I didn't need Levi. I didn't need the man fate chose for me.

Levi disappears around the corner. My chest tightens. He's heading to Obsidian Howl. He'll tell them about me. I have to kill him. I can't let him reveal anything.

I pull a small knife from inside my jacket and sprint after him. Levi's strides are long. He ignores me when I call out.

He stops abruptly. I swing the knife at him. He's prepared, catching my wrist and squeezing until I drop the blade. "That was a stupid move."

"You can't tell them about me!"

"Or what? You'll stab me in the back? How about I beat you to it!"

Something cold plunges into my back. It drags downward from near my heart to a more central spot. The pain doesn't hit immediately. Not until I feel the warmth of blood trickling down my skin, soaking my shirt.

It wasn't him. One hand still grips my wrist, the other my hip. He had an accomplice.

He releases me. I collapse to the ground in agony. The Wolf who brought me the glass of wine stands over me. "Pleasant dreams."
###Chapter 0306
Seraphina

"Look who's finally conscious!" A sharp fingertip digs into my chin, forcing my head upright.

My vision remains blurry at the edges, but I recognize that voice instantly. Levi Bennett. "Took you longer to recover than I anticipated."

A deep, radiating pain shoots down my spine. The tightness across my skin confirms the wound has only recently closed. I attempt to straighten my posture to ease the pressure, but I'm completely immobilized. My head lolls backward, hitting a solid wall behind me. The overwhelming urge to slip back into unconsciousness battles with my rising panic.

A hand pats my cheek roughly. "Wake up, you little slut."

"I..." What the hell did they inject me with? My skull throbs violently, making the spinal agony feel insignificant.

"What dosage did you use?" Levi shouts angrily. "She's still completely out of it."

"I doubled it to be safe," another man replies.

I blink repeatedly, trying to clear the blurriness. It only intensifies the pounding in my head.

"You moron. You were instructed to use the standard dose. We need her breathing!"

I try to swallow the lump forming in my dry throat. "Where am I..."

"Don't trouble your pretty little head with details, Seraphina Blackwood. Or should I call you Harrison?"

No matter how hard I strain, my vision refuses to focus. The sterile scent of the room fills my nostrils, but it gives no clues to my location. I can smell Levi and the Wolf from the bar. No one else. If I could just shift, I could tear them apart.

Their voices begin to echo, as if the room is expanding. My heart hammers against my ribs with terrifying force.

I'd been so distracted by my fated mate that I'd ignored everything else. I failed to see the danger approaching. Now I'm paying the price. I've lost my edge.

A hand strikes my cheek again. "Stay awake, Seraphina."

"Why?" I whisper. Why would my mate do this to me?

"Every Lycan and Wolf wants you dead. It would be a pity if you died like this."

He'd already met Athena. He wasn't heading to Obsidian Howl. He'd already been there.

"You... you don't understand..."

"That you crave her position?" He laughs darkly. "We know everything. Stepdaddy can't keep your secrets."

My heartbeat slows dangerously. My body slumps sideways, colliding with a cold wall.

"No, no. You don't get to sleep now."

"I'm not..." My breath comes in ragged gasps. I'm not getting enough oxygen.

"Shit!" He grabs my legs and yanks me down onto a mattress. A hand presses against my chest. "Her heart is failing. We need her alive." "I'm not a damn doctor!" the other man snarls back.

Something sharp pierces my chest. Darkness swallows me before I can utter another word.

I jolt awake with a gasp. My hands fly to my chest, checking my heartbeat. It's racing, but not dangerously. I'm alive. That's what matters.

I'm in a windowless white room. A toilet sits in one corner. The only other furniture is the bed I'm lying on. An IV drip is connected to my inner arm. A camera blinks in the top corner. I've been dressed in a plain white gown. Everything else has been stripped from me.

How long have I been here? Where am I?

The door swings open. Levi stands there, his large frame filling the doorway. "Look who decided to rejoin the living."

"Where am I?"

"That's not your concern."

"How long have I been here?" My back feels surprisingly good. No tightness from recent healing.

"Five weeks."

"Five weeks? Why are you doing this? We were mated before you rejected me."

"Funny what a special mixture can achieve."

I scramble off the bed, ready to attack. The IV tube tugs sharply at my arm, sending a jolt of pain through me.

"Careful. That's keeping you alive."

"Go to hell!" I rip the tube out and charge at him. I'm determined to fight with everything I have, but a sudden dizziness overwhelms me.

He catches me before I hit the floor and carries me back to the bed. He reinserts the IV just as other women's screams echo from somewhere. They're demanding to know where they are. What kind of place is this?
###Chapter 0307

"You appear disoriented." He murmurs while examining the remaining fluid in the IV bag.

"I assumed this was about Athena."

"The Alpha holds no interest for me. Daniel did, but Daniel is deceased."

"The Wolf from the bar?"

"Correct." He adjusts the blanket over my legs, and only now do I notice my weakened sense of smell.

"What have you administered to me?"

"I needed to ensure you couldn't shift. You create significant problems for our kind, don't you Seraphina. I cannot permit that."

"I'm compensated, and they all warrant it."

"Oh, I'm aware. Although I've been cleaning up your mess for quite some time. Ensuring Humans don't discover us."

More screams and shouts echo from the hallway, both male and female. How many were imprisoned here?

"All Lycans?"

"Not exclusively."

As I stare at him, I attempt to summon my Lycan forward. If devouring him means freedom, I would. But nothing happens.

He smirks at me. "I wouldn't bother. It's ineffective."

My gaze shifts to the IV drip; it must contain something.

Levi laughs. "You require it to survive. Your choices are to live here without your Lycan or perish."

He strides toward the door. "Breakfast will be delivered shortly." He begins to close the door. "Remember this. You believe you are formidable, but there is always someone far more dangerous."

He has no conception of who he's confronting.

I lie still, staring at the pristine white ceiling. Not a single speck of dirt marred its surface. No tiles to count for passing time, nothing. This place was designed to drive us insane. But I am accustomed to solitude with my thoughts.

Breakfast is oatmeal in a plastic bowl. Delivered by an older woman with salt-and-pepper hair. Her grey eyes are vacant. She moves almost mechanically. Not a single word escapes her lips. She avoids all eye contact. What leverage does Levi hold over her?

A different woman arrives thirty minutes later to collect the breakfast dish. She's younger than the first, perhaps in her thirties, but again, there is no eye contact. I began questioning if this was a dream, it felt surreal.

Taking my IV bag with me, I sit in the corner directly beneath the camera. I didn't know if this position hid me from view, but it made me feel slightly less observed.

I fiddle with the IV line, disconnecting and reconnecting it, testing how long I could last before feeling near death. I couldn't exceed five seconds. It wasn't enough time to mount an attack, but perhaps the tubing could be used. It was long enough to wrap around someone's neck.

I startle at a knock on the door. The inability to hear approach was unnerving. I remain silent as the door swings open. Levi's eyes find me instantly.

"On your feet."

"Why?"

"Always so inquisitive." A slight smirk plays on his lips. "Get up."

I rise slowly.

"Bring it with you or you won't get far."

I push the IV stand alongside me as I step into a white corridor lined with multiple doors. Some occupants bang on their doors while others remain quiet or sob behind them.

"Move!" Levi snaps, shoving me forward.

My bare feet shuffle slowly, one before the other, as I try estimating how many are here. And what they might have done to end up here. We reach a door and Levi uses a key to unlock it. He locks it behind us as well.

"Where are you taking me?"

He remains silent, pushing me onward. "Is this retaliation for what I did to Athena?"

"I told you, the Alpha doesn't concern me. Though many would consider it treason." He directs me into another room and points to a chair. "You've met her?" I was beginning to suspect he hadn't. He might know her name, but seemed unaware she was mated.

"Why does it matter to you?"

"Because if you had met her, you would know we are siblings."
###Chapter 0308
Zachary

Lycans now outnumbered Wolves within Obsidian Howl.
This shift occurred a week ago.
It marked the first instance I witnessed Alexander appearing slightly unsettled.
He never voiced it outright, but a Lycan majority posed a potential threat.
Theoretically, we could challenge the Wolves' authority.
Yet, every single one of us remained solely for Athena.

Five weeks had passed, and more Lycans continued to arrive.
I always knew our numbers were greater, but never this substantial.

Many had also perished during their journeys.
Lucas took immense pleasure in that fact.
He remained an asshole, and my trust in him was still absent.
However, he was honoring his word.
He also seemed beneficial for Lottie.

Lucas moved through the open space between the packhouse and the first row of homes.
He conducted his bizarre training routines.
A crowd had gathered, particularly teenage girls who enjoyed watching him exercise.
He tolerated their presence as long as they were Wolves.

"Watching him again?" Alexander muttered, stepping through the front door.

"Just as you watch the Lycans."

"You realize Luc is still seeking a method to bind Nyx. He isn't obligated to do this."

"He's been searching for a solution for nearly two months. Shouldn't he have discovered something by now? Especially with another Hunter's assistance."

"Theodore is nothing like Luc. You already understand that." The revelation about Theodore was profoundly shocking. Comparing him to Lucas highlighted their extreme differences. I struggled to comprehend how Theodore could be a Hunter, particularly since he loved Athena.

"Perhaps it's simply impossible." I stated. "Even if it is possible, we both know the process could kill her. You cannot risk that. Athena must learn to control it."

"What if I told you he has already identified a couple of potential options?"

He had my complete, undivided attention. I tore my gaze away from Lucas. "What?"

"He found a few options. Neither guarantees Athena won't be harmed during the process. One idea originated from a Witch. However, upon learning Athena had been bound previously, she informed Lucas it was not a viable option."

"Why haven't you mentioned this before?"

"I don't have to. She is my mate. I am the Alpha here."

"She is also our Alpha, Alexander. Where is she, anyway?"

"With Theodore. And before you comment." Alexander watched me closely. "Athena can handle herself. Theodore would never harm her."

I decided silence was the best response.

'Julian moved!' Isabella's voice echoed sharply in my mind.

'Isabella...'

'He moved!'

'I'm on my way.' I looked at Alexander. "Julian moved?"

"It's probably just..." His words trailed off as his crimson eyes glazed over. "Come on."

We hurried toward the hospital. He shouted for Lucas to join us. I rolled my eyes. "What did Isabella tell you?" I asked as we crossed the grounds.

"His eyes are open."

"That's impossible." Lucas frowned, an expression seemingly permanent these days.

We burst into the hospital.
We headed straight for Julian's room.
The pillows had been removed from under his head.
The bed was laid completely flat.
His eyes were wide open but entirely unresponsive.
The tube in his throat continued its mechanical work, forcing air into his lungs.

"His hand moved." Isabella whispered. Her own dark eyes were as wide as Julian's. "And he opened his eyes." She gestured toward his face.

I examined Julian's hands. They rested in precisely the same position as always.
This wasn't the first time Isabella claimed he had moved.
Her desperate desire for him to live made her see things that weren't real.
But his eyes being open was a new development.

Alexander clenched his jaw, his eyes scanning his brother's lifeless form.
He had confessed to saying goodbye to Julian long ago.
But he believed Isabella needed more time.
His crimson eyes shifted to Lucas.
Lucas shook his head.

"Isabella, it's time to turn off the machines." Alexander told her, his voice firm.

"You said he would heal." She glared accusingly at Lucas.

"He is not healing. He hasn't been for a while." Lucas replied bluntly. “I have stated this repeatedly. He is not recovering. You must let him go. Forcing him to exist in a world that has no place for him is cruel. You are sacrificing your own life hoping for a miracle. That miracle is not coming."

"He's my brother." I felt her agony. Her longing for him was as powerful as her will for him to awaken. Her denial was equally severe.

"We will proceed with this. You can be by his side, or not." Alexander told her, his tone leaving no room for argument.
###Chapter 0309

"You can't do this... I'm the pack physician. I know what's medically best for him."

My hands rest firmly on her shoulders, giving a gentle squeeze. She needed to feel my presence, to understand she wasn't facing this darkness alone.

Alexander moves with grim determination, switching off the ventilator that had been breathing for Julian. The heart monitor goes silent next, its steady beeps replaced by deafening stillness.

Isabella's sobs break the silence as we watch, waiting for any flicker of life. Nothing happens. No movement. No twitch of fingers. No faint heartbeat.

She collapses to her knees, her breathing becoming ragged and panicked. Her chest heaves with desperate, gasping breaths.

"GO!" I command Alexander and Lucas, pulling my mate tightly against me.

Isabella claws at her own chest, and I have to lock my hands over hers to prevent self-injury. She thrashes wildly, pounding her fists against me with frantic energy, trying to escape the unbearable pain. I hold her steady, knowing this was the brutal moment of accepting her twin was truly gone.

Time loses meaning as we remain on the cold floor. Minutes or hours pass before her struggles cease. She stares blankly at Julian's still form. "Alexander turned off the machines," she whispers, her voice broken.

"He was already gone, Isabella."

"He took my brother from me."

"No. This was Seraphina's doing." She had to remember who truly caused this tragedy. Seraphina made Julian try to kill his Wolf. Seraphina weakened him until nothing remained. Alexander merely performed what should have been done weeks earlier.

"Seraphina," she whispers, the name tasting like poison.

"Seraphina twisted him into something unrecognizable. You witnessed the change yourself. Remember who he was before her influence."

"He loved life completely," she says softly. "He was vibrant. He was joyful. An absolute nuisance sometimes, but always happy."

Her tense body gradually relaxes against mine. "Revenge destroyed him, Isabella."

"Why did he stay with her?"

"From what Brianna revealed, I doubt he had any choice. Seraphina forced him into the life she designed. She likely saw him as her opportunity." She pushes herself up from my lap and approaches Julian. With trembling hands, she removes the breathing tube and gently closes his eyes. Cupping his face, she whispers her final goodbye. A single tear traces down her cheek as she draws the sheet over him.

Isabella returns to me, her gaze lowered. "I need to sleep," she murmurs. "Midnight needs to rest."

It had been too long since she willingly sought rest. "Then let's go home."

As we exit the pack medical facility, Alexander waits by the doors. He immediately pulls his sister into an embrace, though she remains unresponsive in his arms.

Part of me wishes he hadn't prolonged this suffering, but I understood his motives. He had been trying to preserve Isabella's hope.

Theodore passes by with a solemn nod and enters the facility. Likely to prepare Julian for cremation. Little remained to be done except placing him in the casket Alexander had prepared over a month ago.

"Let's get you home," Alexander whispers gently to his sister.

An eerie silence blankets the pack territory as we walk toward the house. Wolves pause as we pass, respectfully lowering their heads. The unusual quiet feels unsettling. No chatter, no children playing. Everyone feels the loss deeply. Perhaps they sense Alexander's grief, though he conceals it well.

Whatever the reason, their profound respect for their Alpha is unmistakable.

Isabella ascends the stairs alone, insisting I remain behind. "I just need to crash," she offers a weak smile.

"I'll check on you soon."

She shrugs and continues upward.

"She requires time," Alexander tells me, turning toward his office.

"Time? Says the man who kept his brother on life support indefinitely. Isabella's depression could have been addressed long ago instead of watching her deteriorate before my eyes."

"Everyone grieves differently."

"Including you?"

"I accepted his death long ago."

"Did you? What I witnessed suggests otherwise."

"How I feel is none of your concern!"

A crash from above interrupts our confrontation. I'm out the door before him, taking the stairs two at a time with Alexander close behind. I sprint toward our room while Alexander bursts through his bedroom door.

Isabella lies unconscious on the bed. She didn't even undress before collapsing starfish-style across the blankets. I quietly close the door just as Alexander calls out to me.

In Alexander's bedroom, he stands frozen before Athena with wide eyes. But Athena isn't in human form.
###Chapter 0310
Athena

"OW!"

My back slammed against the floor.

The impact knocked the air from my lungs.

I lay there, stunned.

Pain radiated through my entire body.

My energy was completely drained.

Practice was over for today.

There's only so much bone-breaking one can handle in a single afternoon.

'Better.' Nyx murmured. 'Almost there.'

I'd been secretly training for weeks.

Shifting into my Lycan form without Nyx's assistance.

It was far from easy.

I gained newfound respect for those who could shift unaided.

Weeks ago, I finally gave in.

I spoke to Nyx directly.

I demanded to know why she kept forcing her way forward.

Her answer remained unchanged. 'I'm protecting us.'

My mind and body had fought so hard to keep her out.

But it was becoming impossible.

She was a constant presence.

A part of me I couldn't suppress.

No matter how much I didn't want her in my head.

I resisted her.

Every waking moment, I tried to block her out.

I wished she'd stop sharing her opinions.

I hoped she'd just give up.

But she never stopped.

The more I pushed, the harder she pushed back.

"I want the darkness gone." I muttered one day. "I want you gone."

I never wanted to become a monster.

I never wanted to become something that fed on blood and flesh.

I still don't.

'Know what makes us superior?' She asked during one heated argument. 'Our blood.'

'I don't understand.'

'We're better than the others. Stronger. More powerful. A Lycan leader. You know it!'

I laughed at her words that day.

Then I noticed Alexander watching from a distance.

A dark expression on his face made me retreat into the training hall.

I didn't want his opinion.

Not while he silently tortured his mate, Hannah.

'Does it frighten you?' Nyx asked one night after putting the twins to bed.

I didn't need to ask what she meant.

I knew exactly what she referred to.

'Of course it does. I'm none of those things you claim I am.'

'Because you still doubt your capabilities, Athena. You still don't trust me. That's what holds you back. We are one. Neither can survive without the other. This is who we're meant to be. You treat me as separate instead of accepting me as part of you. Look at Julian, he's dying without his Wolf.'

Her words made me question everything.

Was she right?

Was I responsible for my own struggles?

'You need to practice shifting.' She declared when I said I'd listen.

'I can't... I'll become..'

'No you won't, Athena. Trust me. Trust yourself.'

Now, almost three weeks later, I'm lying on the bedroom floor.

Alexander and Zachary stare down at me.

The secret is officially out.

I inwardly groan.

I wanted to keep it quiet until I was certain.

Certain I could shift without asking Nyx to do it for me.

“Athena?” Alexander's single word drips with doubt and annoyance.

He stands over me.

He hates when I keep secrets.

It wasn't meant to be a secret.

Just a surprise.

Like tada, I figured something out without his help.

I raise my claws to acknowledge the men.

My heart hammers in my chest.

Shifting is getting easier and faster.

But I always crash to the ground.

Unable to maintain balance.

When Nyx pushed forward, she made it feel effortless.

'Because you keep moving. Practice while still.' she mutters, amused.

Slowly, I shift back.

My neck cracks loudly.

My back arches off the floor as bones realign.

Nyx promised it would get easier.

That the pain would lessen.

But right now, my body feels on fire.

Everything slots back into place.

I'm almost grateful I'm naked.
###Chapter 0311

I mastered nudity during practice sessions quickly.
Torn clothing would only invite suspicion and unwanted questions.

Alexander snatches a blanket from the bed.
He swiftly wraps it around my bare form.
His crimson gaze sweeps over me intently.
"Why?" he demands, voice low.

"I've been training," I murmur back.
I stretch my limbs, feeling several bones pop softly.
Lying serves no purpose now.
He’d be monitoring my thoughts closely from this point.

"Too fucking right," he states, eyes still locked on me.

"Training? As in letting the darkness in and pushing it back out?" Zachary questions.

"No." I frown, struggling to articulate it clearly.
"You claimed it was difficult. Told me once darkness enters, it’s nearly impossible to expel. That isn’t true. Brianna managed it. Gabriel did. So did you."

"Through immense effort," Zachary retorts, clearly annoyed.

"Effort for you," I mumble under my breath.
He glances toward Alexander.
"Not for me. Not anymore."

"What are you talking about?"

"Zachary, you explained Rogues carry darkness before turning. Said it’s unique for everyone. Rooted in their past. But me—" I snort, realizing how blind I’d been.
"I was born with this. It defines me. I’m neither dark nor light."

"Athena, that’s Nyx influencing you," Alexander frowns deeply.

'Of course he blames me!' Nyx mutters internally.

"No, it’s not. I fought her relentlessly. Devised plans to break free from her. But I finally paused to listen. And I learned something crucial." I shake my head and rise to my feet.
I adjust the blanket, tying a secure knot to keep it draped over my chest.
"I’m not meant to eradicate her."

"Athena..." Both men exchange glances as if I’ve lost my sanity.

Alexander shakes his head firmly.
"Athena, Luc stated—"

"Lucas Adler said plenty. He told you darkness fills my fractures. He’s correct, but his reasoning about Nyx is flawed. I tried blocking her. She was merely filling the voids to make me complete. To strengthen me. To enhance my functionality. It was never about domination—her controlling me or me controlling her. I needed to accept her. I needed to embrace what I am."

"None of us truly comprehend what Luc perceives," Alexander argues, shaking his head.
"But his experience—"

"He’s never handled a Lycan Alpha before," I interject swiftly.

I step directly in front of my mate, gazing up into his intense crimson eyes.
"There was a purpose behind my parents binding me as a child. Can’t you see? It all aligns. They were terrified. When the bindings failed, they pretended Dominic was the heir, not me. But they engineered me. The last female Lycan Alpha."

Nyx cheers internally as I boldly declare my true identity.

"I’m no longer afraid. I know exactly who I am."

"Prove it," Alexander challenges quietly.

'You’ve got this,' Nyx encourages. 'Clear your mind. Stand tall. And don’t you dare fall.'

My eyes shift toward Zachary.
"Could you turn around?" I don’t mind Alexander seeing me naked—he’s my mate and has seen me countless times—but Zachary is different.

My body begins its transformation.
Bones crack and stretch.
Fur sprouts across my skin.
The pain is sharp yet manageable.
I continue until I stand fully shifted over him.
He looks up at me, a proud smile gracing his lips.
"There you are."
###Chapter 0312
Brianna

"There you are." I smile brightly as Zachary descends the packhouse stairs. He looks distracted, his expression clouded. "Everything alright?"

"She did it."

"What?"

"Full control. She shifted."

"Seriously?" A wide grin spreads across my face. "That's incredible news. We've waited so long for this moment. How did it happen?" I watch him eagerly, anticipating the details.

"Athena's different." He murmurs quietly. "She's bonded with her Lycan spirit." His gaze meets mine directly. "That's good, right?"

"Of course it is. What's wrong with you? Why wouldn't it be positive?"

Zachary gives me a small smile. "Nothing. I suppose part of me never believed it would happen. She's fought her inner darkness for so long. I started to think it might eventually consume her. Darkness has always prevailed before."

"You're mistaken. We're both living proof that darkness doesn't always win."

He nods slowly. "You're right. I'm overthinking things." He glances back toward the staircase. "She seems genuinely happy. Both parts of her do." His attention returns to me. "You were looking for me?"

"I need your help."

He follows me to my house without question. I gesture toward the kitchen table. He exhales deeply and steps closer. His eyes scan the array of items scattered across the surface.

"Are these..."

"Yes!"

"And they..."

"Yes!" I interrupt sharply.

"And I'm the first person you're telling."

"Obviously. You're my best friend. Who else would I tell first?!"

He raises an eyebrow at me, picking up one of the numerous pregnancy tests. "What about the father?"

I puff out my cheeks in frustration. "Haven't told him yet. He asked me about having children before and I said no. Told him it was too soon after what Gabriel did to his sons. Now I'm pregnant anyway."

"You don't have a choice here, Brianna. You can't keep this from him..." His eyebrows furrow with concern. "Please don't tell me you want my help to get rid of it?!"

"No, never. Of course not. I was hoping for some wise advice. You're usually full of it!"

"You'll make a wonderful mother."

"That's your wise words?" I tease lightly. "Anyone could have told me that."

"But you wouldn't have believed them." I roll my eyes because he's absolutely right. Sebastian is my mate, but he doesn't know me like Zachary does. Nobody does. "Congratulations Brianna. I'm truly happy for you."

"What about you and Isabella?" I ask carefully. I know she suggested trying, but he hasn't shared any updates with me.

He presses his lips into a thin line and sighs heavily. "We would actually have to be intimate to make that happen." I watch his shoulders slump. "Since Julian ended up in a coma, she hasn't been in the right headspace. Now that he's gone... I don't even know where we stand."

"Where is she now?"

"Sleeping. Finally."

"Maybe proper rest will help her think more clearly."

"Here's hoping." He mutters, his dark eyes lifting to the clock. "I need to check on the Lycans." He points toward the tests. "You have to tell him, Brianna. You know who will figure it out and blab to everyone. I'm certain Sebastian would prefer to hear it from you."

I watch him leave and release my own heavy sigh. He's right. Lucas is the last person I need spreading this news.

I thought I would grow accustomed to Lucas after all this time. But knowing he's mated to Hannah and doing nothing about it infuriates me. I want to slap him repeatedly across the face.

It makes everything worse that only Athena and I know the truth. Hannah doesn't want us to say anything. She believes the other Lycans would turn against her if they knew. Athena suggested leaving the pack, but Hannah insisted this is the first place she's ever felt safe.

I make a cup of tea and carry it out to the porch. Before I can even sit down, Lucas is approaching me. He stops several meters away. "Have you seen Theodore?"

"Not since earlier." He nods and starts to turn away. "He isn't like you."
###Chapter 0313

Theodore had been completely transparent about his past discoveries. Fortunately, he and Lucas Adler shared no similarities, and I desperately wanted that to remain unchanged. Theodore possessed genuine kindness—unlike the Hunter now confronting me. I refused to let that alter.

“I never claimed he was. And frankly, your attitude doesn’t sit well with me.”

“My attitude?” I scoffed, then inhaled a mouthful of tea too quickly. It shot from my nostrils like lava, leaving me sputtering and coughing.

He smirked, and my grip tightened around the cup. I was ready to hurl it straight at him. His hazel eyes flicked to my hand, and his smirk widened into a full grin. “That pup’s already got you all riled up, hasn’t he?”

“What the hell did you just say?”

He held my gaze but didn’t repeat himself. There was no way he could already know. I was barely pregnant.

Lucas tilted his head slightly. “You heard me perfectly.” He winked and started to turn away. I launched the cup at him anyway. His hand shot out and caught it effortlessly.

He turned back and closed the distance between us, placing the empty cup carefully on the stone porch beside me. “I’ll let that slide. Just this once.”

His gaze drifted past the open doorway.

“She isn’t here,” I muttered.

“Who?”

“Your Lycan mate.”

“I don’t have a Lycan mate.” He frowned, lines creasing his forehead. Liar. Absolute liar.

“Why are you denying it?” I pressed. “Just reject her and be done with it.”

“Rejecting her would imply we’re mated. Since we’re not, I can’t reject her. I’ve told Athena the exact same thing.”

“That isn’t the truth.” He was denying every possibility. But Hannah had been certain. She knew exactly who her mate was and had no reason to lie.

He grinned at me. “It’s my truth, Brianna. My mate was everything to me. I can’t just move on.”

“How long were you together before Seraphina killed her?” I asked. Lucas had never spoken about his mate, his unborn child, or his parents.

“Twelve years.”

“Was she a Hunter too?”

“Yes. And a damn good one.”

“I’m sorry Seraphina took them from you.”

“Your apology means nothing. You had no part in it.”

“Your child… the one you lost…”

“He died in utero. Was already gone before I made it home. I couldn’t save him.” His voice grew quiet. “My advice to you—don’t act recklessly. Protect that little one. We all know you rush in and deal with consequences later. Change that. Now.” It felt less like a deflection and more like a warning.

Zachary always said everyone carries secrets they’d rather keep buried.

“Why do you care? You don’t even like our kind.”

“I never said I cared.” He turned and walked away without looking back. Almost instantly, a group of young she-wolves appeared, giggling as they trailed after him until they vanished from sight.

I linked Athena, asking if she was free to talk. I needed to tell her about my bizarre encounter with Lucas. She replied that she’d come over as soon as possible.

Getting to my feet, I caught the scent of smoke and burning wood. Peering around my house, I saw Wolves and Lycans sprinting from the forest, scooping up young children and rushing them to safety as flames engulfed the tree trunks.

Many Wolves leaped into action, ensuring everyone moved to a safe distance while others charged into the trees to combat the blaze. But the fire only grew, spreading wildly through the forest.

A hand locked around my wrist, yanking me backward as embers rained on my roof, setting it ablaze within seconds. Everything I had built over the past few years went up in flames right before my eyes.

“You need to move,” the man holding my wrist muttered.

I looked up and recognized Caleb—Seraphina’s stepfather. I hadn’t even seen him approach, but he pulled me back, away from the raging fire. Then I spotted familiar waves of red hair backing toward the flames.

“HANNAH!”
###Chapter 0314

Trigger warning. Suicide. ****
Lucas

Flames sear my skin as I charge forward.
I'm not even near the fire, yet it burns me like I'm standing in the center.
This has never happened before.

Ryken grips Brianna tightly, preventing her from rushing into the inferno.
She screams Hannah's name repeatedly, fighting against his hold.
She struggles wildly, but he doesn't let go.

Act first, think later. That was Brianna's way.
I'm almost thankful someone is stopping her from certain death.
She was one of the few Lycans I actually respected.

Sweat pours down my heated skin.
Smoke billows into the sky as Wolves and Lycans desperately battle the flames.
They pull younger pack members to safety while trying to extinguish the fire.
Every time one section dies down, another erupts in violent orange flames.
Thick, dark smoke chokes the air.

If we aren't careful, the smoke will attract unwanted attention from outsiders.

Athena and Alexander rush past me.
He joins the water chain, dousing the roaring fire.
Athena helps Ryken drag Brianna further from her burning home.

Something is different about Athena.
The black ring around her soul isn't as dark.
It doesn't pulsate like it usually does.
Every crack is filled with black, making her soul appear almost cleared.
She either let her Lycan win or she completely gave up.

I didn't want to put a bullet in her.
But I can't allow another Rogue to roam free.

Brianna's scream pulls my attention. "She's your mate!" she cries at me. "You're just letting her die!"

Ryken frowns, confused by her declaration.

"She isn't my mate," I say for the thousandth time.
My focus shifts to the forest.
I spot Hannah's red hair near the ground.
More fire races up my back.

"Brianna. Brianna, look at me," Athena says firmly, grabbing the Lycan's face. "This isn't your fault."

While Athena distracts her, I slip away.
I enter a section of forest that's already been extinguished.

Hannah's jasmine scent is easy to track.
It's quickly followed by the sound of her crying.
She lets out a piercing scream, and I feel my back flesh burn. "Hannah!"

She doesn't answer.
I'm forced to call again, hoping to stop her from self-harm.

Her chestnut eyes briefly focus on me. "No, not you. I don't need you. Go!" she whimpers from the ground.
She's lying on her stomach.
The back of her shirt is almost completely burnt away.
Her back is covered in black seared flesh and open wounds struggling to heal.

She rolls over, grimacing in pain, and deliberately shoves her arm into the fire.
Hannah releases a gut-wrenching scream that freezes my heart.
I feel fire smolder up my own arm.
It's strange, feeling something that isn't happening to me.
I never felt this with Charlotte's mother.

I grab Hannah's feet and drag her from the flames.
She needs time to heal.
But she kicks at me, shouting and demanding release. "You have to stop!" I snap.

"I can't live like this. It's too hard!"

I pull the small handgun from my hip and thrust it toward her. "Go on then, be my guest, do it." I was calling her bluff.

Her eyes widen, dancing between the gun, my face, and the fire.

"It will be quicker and less painful. Well, if you do it right."

She reaches for the gun.
A move I didn't expect.
I yank it just beyond her reach.
She was willing to kill herself over all this.

"Screw you," she growls at me.

"You've been torturing me for over a month. Do you know how it feels, knowing I'm mated to you of all people? Now let me go!" She tries to kick me again.
###Chapter 315

I block her easily, anticipating her next move as her foot aims for my groin. "Just let me go. Please!"
"You're not going anywhere."

Her chestnut eyes widen, staring at me in confusion. I notice the matches and a small aerosol can nearby.

"You started this fire, didn't you?" I demand as flames leap from one charred tree to another.

"No." The word comes out choked with desperation and sorrow. Like a child being scolded for something trivial.

"Your soul tells me otherwise. The evidence speaks for itself."

She turns away and begins crawling toward the fire, dragging herself across the forest floor despite her injuries.

I pin her to the ground, straddling her hips as she sobs beneath me.

"Why?" My voice is harsh. "Why would you do this to someone who took you in?"

"What are you talking about?" Tears streak through the soot on her face.

"You burned Brianna's house down."

"I didn't..."

"I saw it. You destroyed a pregnant woman's home."

"No." She whimpers. "That wasn't supposed to happen. It was meant for me."

Her heart races wildly. She squeezes her eyes shut, weighed down by grief and pain.

"It wasn't supposed to spread so far." She pushes weakly against me, exhausted. The burns on her arms are already healing. "You should have killed me when you shot Nathan. Please, just do it." She struggles feebly. "Or let me go. It would be easier for you."

"So you can walk into the flames and disappear? I don't think so, Hannah. Not while I feel that fire burning my skin as if I'm the one walking through it."

She grabs my hand with the gun and pulls it under her chin, locking her hands over mine. "I can't live in fear anymore. Please, just kill me?" She tries to force my finger onto the trigger, but she's too weak to move it.

Death is what she wants. An escape from me. But I won't let her go. Not yet.

"I'm not going to kill you. Not yet. But you will keep quiet about what happened and how this fire started. Do you understand?"

I lift her from the ground, cradling her in my arms. She hooks a burned arm over my shoulder. It's been years since I held a woman like this. Her jasmine scent invades my senses. I both hate it and crave it.

I can't admit what she means to me, but I can't let her destroy herself either.

Isabella and Athena rush toward us. Isabella demands I put Hannah down so she can examine her. Athena stares at me with that knowing look.

She pulls me aside. "You saved her?"

"Obviously." I glance back at Hannah.

"I thought you hated Lycans?" Athena blocks my view, arms crossed, eyes narrowed. She won't let this go easily.

"I do."

She rolls her eyes. "Have you accepted her?"

"Why the hell would I do that?" She gives me that same knowing look. I change the subject. "What about you? What happened to you?"

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Cut the crap, Athena."

"You don't want to discuss Hannah. I don't want to discuss whatever visions you claim to see. But I can order Hannah to tell me what happened in the forest. Actually, that's a good idea. I need to test my abilities further." She smiles, her blue eyes sparkling with excitement.

"Is Nyx in control?"

###Chapter 0317
Seraphina

Each day I hoped for improvement.
Each day proved me wrong.

Levi claims this IV sustains my life.
Yet it feels like it's draining my soul.

A knock interrupts my thoughts.
The daily ritual begins.

A nurse enters to check the drip.
She places a towel on my bed.
A small soap and toothbrush follow.
I must accompany her to the showers.
Dragging my medical equipment behind me.

I attempted to use the tubing twice.
Both times brought severe punishment.
They withheld the medicine intentionally.
Just long enough to cause agony.
Repeatedly.

Levi ordered this for days.
Until I begged for death.
His response never changes.
"Think of those you murdered."
"You deserve this suffering."

I follow the nurse silently.
Most cells remain quiet now.
Inmates learned screaming wastes energy.
No one's coming to rescue us.
But new arrivals always reveal themselves.

They pound against their doors.
They demand freedom until exhaustion.
Weeks later, I still don't understand.
Why make us suffer like this?
Why remove our abilities just to imprison us?

Killing us would be more efficient.
We wouldn't drain resources this way.

The humiliation continues during showers.
I'm constantly watched.

They take my old gown.
Provide a fresh one afterward.
I return to my room.
A meager oatmeal bowl awaits.
The nurse departs immediately.

I have thirty minutes to eat.
Another nurse collects the bowl afterward.

Everything here remains brutally plain.
Bland food, white sheets, white gowns.
A constant reminder we deserve nothing.
They even performed a hysterectomy.

That happened after my first week.
Something about keeping things clean.

Bastards!

This is a prison.
Levi appointed himself warden.

My old life feels galaxies away.
The life I fought so hard for.

Ironically, I'd sacrifice anything now.
Just to contact my mother.
Or hear Athena's voice.
Any voice besides mine or Levi's.
Or someone pleading for freedom.

I place the oatmeal bowl on the floor.
Curling up on the bed seems better.
Starvation beats this existence.

The lock slides open suddenly.
Warm air rushes inside.

"Why aren't you eating?" Levi demands.
I refuse to look at him.
"Third day straight."
"Should we force-feed you?"

"Not hungry."

"Not your decision."

"Feeling unwell."

"Impossible. The drip contains everything."
"You call this survival?"
"Is this some twisted joke?"

"I'd rip this shit out myself."
"But you always stop me first."
My eyes dart toward the camera.
If we all acted simultaneously...
Who would he save first?

"This is your deserved punishment."
"Why let you die, Seraphina Blackwood?"

"Your methods are utterly deranged."
I turn away from him.
"Met many with god complexes."
"But keeping people alive for amusement?"
"That's truly fucked up."

"Minor suffering compared to your destruction."
"Your poor mother, for example."

I sit up glaring fiercely.
"Don't speak about my mother."

"She tried helping you."
"You repaid her with horror."

"Shut the fuck up!"

"You caused her immense problems."
"Made her relive terrible memories."
"Because you couldn't accept reality."
"Clung to your foolish ideas."

"I deserved what was mine!" I snarl.
He laughs deeply from his stomach.

"Life doesn't work that way."
"Perhaps things would differ."
"If your mother raised you properly."
"Maybe you'd have known Athena."

"This conversation's over."
###Chapter 0318

He gives a cold smile. "You call Athena your sibling, yet she isn't even searching for you."

"You know nothing! You have no idea who I am!" She would be looking. Maybe not in person, but she had every reason to want me dead.

He reaches out, tucking a stray strand of my wild hair behind my ear. "I know far more than you realize. But it's time this is gone." His fingers twist into my hair, yanking my head back as he calls out for someone.

The older woman from my first day here enters. She carries a tray with scissors, shaving foam, and a new razor.

"Stay still now, or I might slip and cut something important," Levi warns.

He shaves every strand from my head. The razor scrapes painfully close to my scalp. I watch dark locks fall onto the bed around me. Tears burn behind my eyes, but I refuse to let them fall. I loved my hair. But I won't give him the satisfaction. When I escape this hellhole, I will skin him alive.

Once he finishes, he grabs my face, leaning inches from me. "Next time, make sure you eat."

"You shaved my head because I didn't eat? Are you insane?"

He smirks and walks out with the older woman. The door slams shut. The bolt slides back into place. My hands fly to my head. It's completely smooth. Not a single hair remains. He's done this before.

I hate it. I hate him. I hate what he's turning me into.

I glare up at the camera, wishing I could tear it from the wall. It's too high to reach. The bed is bolted down. I keep staring, hoping he's watching. Hoping he sees the hatred boiling inside me.

He's the first person to truly outsmart me. I hate him more than I hate Athena. But I wonder what she would think if she knew about him. Would she kill him? Or would she thank him for punishing me?

Something tells me she'd want him dead.

My eyes shift from the camera to the door. Something's happening outside. I can't hear clearly. Levi took that from me. Muffled sounds echo. Footsteps. Some are running. Others sound like skipping?

An alarm blares. A red beacon flashes above my door. The noise fills the room. The bolt slides back. The door cracks open. No one enters. More footsteps echo outside. I glance at the drip bag attached to my arm. I have maybe twelve hours left. Unless I find another. Either way, I'm getting out.

Quietly, I push the door open. Bodies litter the hallway. None have drip bags. They didn't learn. Or no one told them. They made it out only to collapse.

I look both ways. Every door is open. Someone broke out. Or someone is overthrowing Levi. I don't care which.

I duck into one room. Quickly, I tie off the remaining fluid in the drip bag. Then I enter the opposite room. I find an almost full bag. That's twenty-four hours. I have roughly forty hours total. But I need to move now.

The building is a maze. I try to map the areas I've been taken to. I pass other escapees. They don't stop. They're doing the same thing I am. Collecting drip bags to survive.

One stops to look at me. His eyes travel to my shaved head, then to the bags in my arms.

"Don't even think about it," I snarl. I need enough to find a witch. That's all.

"FIND HER NOW!" Levi's roar echoes down the hall.

I duck into an empty room. Once he passes, I race in the direction he came from. I push open every door until one leads outside.

The sun is blinding. It burns my eyes. Being kept in a windowless room altered my vision. But I don't have time to adjust. I keep moving.

I run as fast as my legs can carry me. Without a Lycan, I'm painfully slow.
###Chapter 0319
Isabella

"Absolutely nothing?" I whisper, my voice thick with disbelief. A full day had passed since the flames consumed everything.

Alexander shakes his head slowly. "We've combed through every inch. The perpetrator was meticulous. They left no evidence behind."

"Any lingering scents?" I press.

"The smoke overpowered everything else." Zachary adds, his tone grim. "Whoever did this was long gone before the first spark caught. They planned this."

"So Seraphina remains a suspect?"

"We aren't eliminating anyone." My brother tells me, a faint smile touching his lips. "It's good to see you re-engaging with pack affairs."

I offer a weak shrug. "Julian is gone. I need to be useful somehow."

"That's not what I meant." His smile widens. "I've missed your presence around the house. Finding you in random corners with a tub of ice cream. Athena misses you too." He looks at me expectantly, but I can't muster a smile in return.

A heavy sigh escapes me. I'd been completely absent from Athena's life recently. She usually confided in me about everything, but we'd barely spoken since I dedicated myself to my brother's bedside vigil. I'd even missed the twins' first steps. "I'm here now. When is the funeral?"

"Tonight. It's a full moon. I believe it's the perfect night to honor him before the pack run begins."

I hadn't participated in a full moon run for months. "Will the Lycans be joining?"

"Some of us." Zachary confirms. "But many, like the Silverwood group, traditionally abstain."

"Seraphina's family?" I need to be certain I'm following. Their presence still felt strange, though Lucas Adler had personally verified their identities. "Is that a safe decision?"

"Sebastian is staying behind. He will remain at the house with Brianna, Athena, and the twins."

"Oh, Brianna isn't going either?"

Alexander begins to speak, but Zachary answers first. "She chose not to. She and Athena have developed a strong bond recently. She wants to help with the twins tonight."

"Athena allows her near the children?" I struggle to keep the shock from my voice.

"I never thought I'd say this." Alexander smiles genuinely. "They get along remarkably well."

"Oh." I can't deny the pang of jealousy that shoots through me. "So Julian will be laid to rest in the family plot?" I ask, steering the conversation back.

"Yes. Regardless of his choices, he was one of us. He deserves to rest beside our parents."

"Thank you." I mumble softly.

"No thanks are necessary, Isabella. He belonged to Obsidian Howl."

If only he had realized that himself. Zachary clears his throat abruptly, his gaze intense. Damn it. He'd caught my thoughts.

"What time?" I ask quietly.

"Sundown is just after eight. We'll begin then."

I head upstairs, glancing back briefly to see if Zachary follows. I'm alone. A part of me isn't sure that's what I truly wanted. Julian's coma had driven a wedge between us. Zachary couldn't comprehend why I devoted every moment to my dying brother, and I lacked the words to make him understand.

Wolves typically process loss with swift acceptance. There are few exceptions. From my observations, Lycans move on even faster. They grieve for a brief period, then fully accept the person's fate.

I've witnessed countless deaths where the profound sadness dissipates quickly. But this time was different because I clung to the hope that it wasn't real. Zachary simply didn't seem to grasp that.

The sound of childish giggles pulls me from my thoughts. I follow the noise. Athena is lying on her stomach on the floor while Evrin and Logan clamber over her like tiny mountains.

Somehow, I'd failed to notice how much they'd grown. They were proper little people now. Little Lycans.

The twins scramble down and waddle toward me, tiny hands tugging at my leggings, demanding to be lifted.

"They've grown." I murmur, almost to myself.

"Every single day." Athena smiles up at me. "Though they've missed their Auntie Isabella tremendously."

I lift Evrin first, gazing into his brilliant blue eyes. His small hands clumsily pat my dark hair as he giggles. Logan continues his persistent tugging on my leg.

"Does it ever worry you?" I ask in a hushed tone.

"Every single day."

"And that doesn't terrify you?"

"Are you joking?" She laughs softly. "Logan bumped his head the other day, and I went into a full-blown panic. And that was something he did to himself. Now that they're walking, they have no concept of ducking under things they used to crawl under." Her laughter is warm. "The only time I'm not worried is when they're finally asleep. You'll understand that feeling someday." She beams at me. I simply shake my head.
###Chapter 0320

"We discussed it, but then Julian happened. Zachary doesn't understand my grief. I'm beginning to believe our bond is shattered." She grimaces. "The advice I received was to communicate."

"I am communicating."

"To your mate, Isabella. He's the one who needs to understand you. He's the one who can read your thoughts, sense what you're feeling."

"Then why doesn't he comprehend it?"

"Because you were a twin who shared twin wolves. Honestly, I don't fully grasp how it works myself. I don't understand who decides these connections. I'm still learning many things, but perhaps if you talk to Zachary instead of shutting him out."

"I'm not shutting him out."

She exhales deeply. "You've barely spoken to him. He ensured you slept, ate, changed clothes. He gave you the space you needed to handle the situation. He made sure you left the hospital, even if just for a few minutes, to get fresh air. You're mistaken about your bond being broken."

I frown, realizing I hadn't considered that. In my haze of arranging everything for my brother, I overlooked what everyone else was doing. "When did you become so wise?" I muse.

She rises from the floor, takes Evrin from me, and settles into the large chair by the window. "You're not really asking about wisdom, are you? You want to know about my darkness?"

I nod and pick up a whining Logan. "No one discusses it. Are you alright?"

"Zachary and Brianna made me believe I had to fight it. That I needed to restrain it and prevent myself from going insane. Even Lucas Adler suggested something similar, but Nyx never intended to harm me. Not in the way everyone thinks."

"I don't follow."

"She was frustrated. She spent years unable to communicate with me, and when she finally could, I kept trying to suppress her." "So you were never going to turn dark?"

"I could have. If I continued rejecting Nyx, I would have eventually gone Rogue." She frowns and bites her lower lip. "The darkness that drives others Rogue is different; they become their Lycan. But I have a separate entity. Nyx has her own thoughts, opinions, and feelings. We had to unite. It was the only way."

"Alexander mentioned you were practicing?"

Athena nods at me and extends her hand. Claws slowly emerge from her fingertips, just enough for me to see before vanishing.

"It's becoming easier. And I'm not falling on my face anymore."

I smirk, and she returns it. "But you're okay, right?"

"Yes. I finally don't feel that crushing sensation." She pats her chest and smiles. "And Nyx says it's about time. But we don't have to talk about me. We can discuss anything you want."

I didn't want to talk about Julian, not to anyone.

"The new girl, the one Lucas pulled from the fire. She's a Lycan, right?"

"Yes."

"Why did he help her?" She opens her mouth. "I mean, he's a Hunter, right? So he should want to kill her, but he saved her. That's strange, isn't it?"

I look at my red-eyed nephew. He's a miniature version of Alexander, even down to the all-knowing way he looks at me.

"I'm keeping an eye on him." Athena tells me, but it doesn't feel entirely truthful.

Is this what it has come to? I mourn my brother, and they exclude me from certain things unless they decide I need to know.

"Do you think Seraphina started the fire?" I had to know something. They couldn't keep everything from me just because they think I might break at any moment.

"Honestly? I don't know. We haven't seen her. She hasn't appeared. No one has detected her scent in the forest. If it was related to her and she used someone else, then it's possible. But they said the fire..."

"Eliminated the scents," I finish.

She presses her lips together and nods. "You're asking about her because you want to make her pay, don't you?"

"She destroyed my brother, Athena. He gave up his life because of what she did to him. And he never woke up to tell me what she did. He was so stubborn, he kept that information to himself."

"You couldn't have saved him."

"I know that now, but I can ensure she pays for what she did to him."
###Chapter 0321
Brianna

"Go find Athena and Alexander for me." Sebastian commands me.

"I can mind-link her instead."

"Better if you go personally." His gaze pierces through the gates at the approaching crowd. A massive group of Lycans heading our way.

"Fine." I roll my eyes. Still no chance to tell him about the pregnancy. Maybe he already suspects. He didn't question me when I refused the pack run tonight.

I move swiftly but avoid running. Don't want to draw attention. At least a hundred Lycans approaching the gate. Abraxas claims he can handle them, but I doubt it.

Zachary and Alexander are in the office. "Where's Athena?"

"Upstairs with the twins. Why?"

"More Lycans." They both start moving. "You'll need backup."

Alexander turns to Zachary. "Gather more Wolves and Lycans. Meet us at the gates."

Finding Athena is easy. I follow her voice. She's having a heated argument with Isabella.

"So you think I should let you kill Seraphina because of Julian?" Her irritation is palpable.

"Look what she did to him!" Isabella snaps back.

"Isabella, you're not the only one who wants her dead." Athena lists names of those wanting Seraphina eliminated.

"Notice you didn't include yourself." Isabella pushes.

"Sorry, didn't realize I had to." Surprisingly good to hear Athena stand her ground.

"You've changed!" Isabella snaps. Logan and Evrin start crying.

"A lot changed while you trapped yourself in a hospital with your traitor brother."

I enter to find Evrin clinging to Athena while she glares at Isabella. Logan tries pushing away from Isabella. The pups sense the tension. I quickly free Logan, earning a growl from Isabella.

"You have no right to take my nephew."

"I do when you act like this. I'll protect them with my life." Logan buries his face in my hair. His tiny hands paw at me. He stops crying, and Evrin follows. They definitely work together.

I face Athena. "More Lycans at the gate."

"Is Seraphina with them?" Isabella demands.

"Don't know, didn't see her. But listen. You blame Seraphina, and you're right—she's a royal pain. But remember, Julian went to her first. Without that, she might not even be on our radar."

Isabella scoffs, stepping back, shaking her head. "You were my friend."

"Trying to be now. But you're stuck. You said it—you missed so much. Everything changed quickly, and you missed it all."

Her head swivels between Athena and me. "You're supposed to be on my side. I helped both of you. I..."

"That's what we're doing." Athena tells her. "You're stuck, forgetting everything that led Julian down this path. He's gone, Isabella. That was his choice."

She claps her hands. "Some friends you are." She storms out. I feel slightly bad, but she needed that reminder.

Athena sighs, squeezing Evrin tighter.

"She'll come around, Athena."

"Not sure she will. That might get her into trouble. Trouble none of us can fix."

Sadly, I think she's right.

I help with the twins. We take them to Sebastian's parents' house—on the way to the gates anyway. Athena gives me a quick hug and a wink. Different from her usual greeting. Do they know? Can't be possible—haven't told Sebastian yet.

At the gates. Abraxas is already vetting Lycans one by one. The crowd grows rowdy.
###Chapter 0322

Athena’s fingers tighten around mine. Her eyes are wide, almost startled. “I can handle this, can’t I?”

So far, the number of Lycans arriving had been manageable. Some came alone. Others in small clusters. Except for Silverwood, but even their group wasn’t large.

“Absolutely. You were born for this, Alpha Athena.”

She offers a faint smile before descending toward the gathered Lycans. She delivers the same speech she gave the others. Well-practiced. Effective. It’s what she needs right now.

Zachary watches the crowd carefully as he approaches me. “I thought Isabella might have come down with you. I hoped she’d want to see how Athena is managing everything.”

“Have you two talked?”

“Of course we have. She’s my mate.”

“You know that’s not what I meant. Have you discussed what she’s feeling?”

“She’s completely closed off.”

“I walked in on her arguing with Athena.” His eyes widen at my words. “Athena told her she’s rewriting what really happened with Julian. Isabella didn’t take it well.”

“Where is she now?” He frowns.

“She stormed off. Zachary, I know she lost her brother. But Alexander did too. She’s so fixated on how Seraphina betrayed him that she’s forgotten Julian sought her out. Does she not remember he went to Seraphina willingly? Or is she still in denial? She shouldn’t be, right?”

“I’ll talk to her.”

“Do you think she started the fire?”

“No. She knows the pack would turn on her if she did.” He sighs. “What did Athena say about my mate?”

“She thinks Isabella is heading down a path where no one can help her.”

I flinch as Lucas fires his gun.

It’s a sound I doubt I’ll ever get used to.

But it silences the arguing Lycans instantly.

They all stare at the woman bleeding out on the ground.

One by one, they drop to their knees in submission.

All except two.

They’re dead before they even realize they’ve been caught.

I’ve been surrounded by death for years.

I’ve killed. I’ve watched others kill.

But when Lucas does it, it’s effortless. Like choosing a drink from the fridge.

It means nothing to him.

Caleb and a few other long-term Lycans move through the crowd.

They collect the bodies.

They’ll take them to the far edge of the territory and burn them.

Just like all the others.

It’s an exhausting process.

My idea, originally.

But I hadn’t expected so many Lycans to lose their lives.

What’s strange is that no other bitten Lycans have shown up.

Every single one here, except me and Zachary, is a pureblood.

“Doesn’t this seem weird to you?”

“Usually I follow your train of thought, but you’ll have to give me more than that.” Zachary smirks.

“We haven’t seen any bitten Lycans. None like us. Not even among the dead.”

“Athena didn’t issue an order. It was just a request. They’re probably staying away because they fear being killed for not being purebloods. If they’re even still alive. We don’t know if he’s taken any out.” He nods toward Lucas. “He doesn’t mention them. I’m sure if Athena makes it an order, they’ll come. Why? Feeling left out?” He muses.

“No. Just curious, I guess.” I sigh inwardly. Something always feels off. “Where are we going to house all of them? We’re out of cabins. What about the pack run tonight?”

“It’s handled.”

The gun fires again.

A sharp, burning pain tears through my stomach.

I see horror flash across Zachary’s face.

Sebastian rushes toward me.

The sky spins above until I’m staring straight up.

The men hover over me.

Sebastian presses his hands hard against my stomach.

Panic is written all over his face.

I hear Athena ordering the Lycans to drop flat.

What about Lucas?

He’s the one who shot me.
###Chapter 0323
**** TRIGGER WARNING: MISCARRIAGE ****
Athena

"Nobody fucking move!" Alexander's roar echoes across the clearing as I glance toward Brianna.

Sebastian desperately presses against her stomach, trying to stop the bleeding. Zachary cups her face, forcing her to maintain eye contact instead of looking down at her wounds. He speaks to her softly, attempting to keep her calm. From where I stand, I can see her body trembling violently, blood already forming a dark pool around her. Alexander grabs my face and turns it toward him. "You need to control them. You can't help Brianna until you do."

'He's right. We have to do this now.' Nyx whispers urgently.

'I don't know if I'm ready for this.' I respond internally.

'You are ready. Just like we practiced.'

I draw a deep breath, filling my lungs completely as I tap into my Alpha abilities. I only needed the rogue Lycans to obey, not the rest of the pack, and certainly not Zachary as he tended to Brianna.

Focusing on the connections to every Lycan before me. "Everyone, face down on the ground, now!"

They all drop simultaneously. Nyx practically vibrates with satisfaction at my growing control.

Only two males remained standing. Lucas and another Lycan were still on their knees, locked in combat. I immediately see what they're fighting over—a gun. It hadn't been Lucas who shot Brianna, but the idiot he was wrestling with. Lucas had already landed several solid punches.

I step forward, moving between the prone Lycans. They lay completely still, including the children, though their hearts hammered wildly in their chests. Not a single soul attempted to defend the bastard who had shot Brianna.

Lucas finally wrestles the gun free and points it directly at the shooter's head. "She's pregnant, you stupid fuck!"

'A pup can't survive that injury.' Nyx murmurs grimly.

Rage floods through me as I watch Lucas's finger twitch on the trigger. I had allowed him to eliminate threats before, but he wouldn't be killing this piece of shit.

"Stop!"

Lucas shifts his hazel eyes toward me, confusion evident. "He's a threat! He shot Brianna!"

"She's a Lycan Alpha, not a Wolf Alpha. And you're a fucking Hunter. A disgrace to your kind." The shooter sneers as if he thought I would take his side.

"You're right. I am the Lycan Alpha. But you disobeyed my direct order. And the person you shot was a Lycan. You won't get another chance to try that." The shooter slowly turns to face me. His piercing green eyes stare into mine with pure disgust. "You're going to..."

"Who do you think let the Hunter in?!" My voice carries a dark edge that feels different this time. It brings a strange comfort. Nyx stood with me, not against me.

"Trai..." He doesn't finish the word as my claws sink deep into his chest.

His lips part in a breathy gasp. Shock and surprise register on his face as his eyes drift down to the gaping wound. "You...you can partially shift."

His words barely escape as my claws drive deeper, puncturing his lungs. A gurgling sound rises from his throat as oxygen fails him. Blood trickles from the corner of his mouth, slowly tracing a path down his chin.

Intense satisfaction floods through me as I watch life drain from his eyes, but it's quickly replaced by overwhelming guilt.

'You're administering justice for a crime.' Nyx murmurs. 'He deserved this. He hurt Brianna. This doesn't define you, and you know it's necessary. Too many would be endangered if you let him live. They need to know you don't tolerate threats!'

His knees buckle, forcing my claws upward through his chest and into his heart. His eyes bulge with the realization that this was his end.

"It should have been you." He whispers with his final breath. I retract my claws from his chest, and he collapses to the ground, dead before impact.

I pause for a moment, staring at my blood-covered claws. Ending someone who deserved it felt right and just, yet guilt still weighed heavily in my chest.

Turning around, I see all the Lycans still pressed face down on the ground. Alexander watches me, a slight smile curving his lips. My eyes search for Brianna, but she's been moved. I need to get to her. That bullet was meant for me, not her, and now she might have lost a pup because of it.

"Dispose of the body." I tell Lucas.

"Planning to kill any others?" He asks with amusement.

"I don't know, do you want to join him?" Nyx bursts into laughter at my sarcastic response.
###Chapter 0324

Lucas stays silent.

I already know he’s holding back laughter without even turning around.

I hear him lift the body onto his shoulder.

His footsteps fade as he trudges away.

I walk back through the crowd of Lycans toward Alexander.

None of them move.

Maybe it’s fear.

Maybe shame for bringing someone like that here.

I don’t really care.

Alexander slips his hand into mine.

His voice echoes in my mind through our link. How did it feel?

It was necessary.

That’s not what I asked.

I meet his crimson gaze.

“It felt… right,” I say softly.

My eyes drift toward where Brianna had fallen.

Her blood still stains the ground.

“I need to check on her.”

Alexander gestures toward the Lycans still kneeling. “What do you want to do with them?”

I shrug.

I hadn’t planned that far ahead.

“Let me handle it,” he says. “Just release your command.”

He presses a kiss to my cheek.

“You’re sure?”

“Of course. I have more experience with this.”

I release my hold on them.

Everyone rises slowly.

I hurry toward the infirmary.

I expect to see Isabella inside.

But it’s Theodore barking orders instead.

Zachary sits on a chair outside the room.

His hands are clasped tightly between his knees.

“Are you praying?” I ask.

His dark eyes lift to mine. “Someone has to listen.”

“The baby?” I whisper.

He shakes his head.

He doesn’t meet my eyes.

“Theodore is fighting for her life,” he murmurs.

“Where’s Isabella?”

“She refused to help.” Anger flashes in his gaze.

“What? Why?”

“Theodore is in there with a few others Isabella trained. We can only wait.”

That doesn’t answer my question.

“Why did Lucas do this, Athena?” Zachary’s voice is strained. “Brianna told me he knew.”

If it had been anyone else, Zachary would already have torn out the Hunter’s throat.

“It wasn’t him.”

“Of course it was. He’s been waiting for this.”

“It wasn’t him,” I repeat firmly. “One of the Lycans took the gun from him—or tried to. I’m not sure. Lucas was trying to disarm him when it went off. That bullet wasn’t meant for Brianna. The Lycan was aiming at me.”

“You don’t have to defend him,” he growls.

“I’m not. Ask Alexander. He saw it happen.”

Zachary’s jaw tightens. “Where is the guy now?”

“Dead.”

“Lucas killed him?”

“No. I did.”

His eyes drop to my bloodstained hand.

Then they return to my face.

“Thank you,” he says quietly.

I nod.

Theodore’s sharp commands continue from inside.

It sounds bad.

If she could heal naturally, she would have by now.

“Where’s Sebastian?” I ask softly.

Zachary points toward the nurse’s station.

A hand is visible from behind the counter.

Sebastian sits on the floor, back against the cabinets.

He is completely still.

No sound.

No tears.

Just the steady beat of his heart.

If he loses Brianna, I know he’ll spiral back into drinking.

His knees are pulled to his chest.

His shirt is soaked in Brianna’s blood.

His eyes lift to meet mine.

They’re hollow.

Empty.

As if he’s already given up.

“Theodore will find a way,” I whisper.

I sit on the floor facing him.

“She was pregnant,” he says hoarsely.

“I know. I’m so sorry.”

He lets out a bitter laugh. “She hadn’t even told me.”

“How did you find out?”

“The fire. I swept her home after we put it out. There was an untouched test on her table. Several others, too. But they were unreadable.”

“Is that why you didn’t question her about the pack run?”

He gives me a sad smile. “I thought tonight would be the night she told me. But now… if she survives this… I’ll have to be the one to tell her there’s no baby. That there might never be one.”

“I don’t understand.”

“The bullet tore through her stomach. Like Isabella’s leg—it can’t heal what isn’t there.”

His shoulders slump even further.

“You can feel her,” I say, fighting back tears.

I always got the sense Brianna wanted a family.

She wanted to raise her children differently than her father had.

Her biggest worry was whether Sebastian was ready.

“Listen to her body. You know her better than anyone because you can feel her.”

He shakes his head. “She’s barely holding on. I don’t need to be in that room to know Theodore has already restarted her heart twice.”
###Chapter 0325
Zachary

I listen to them talk.
Athena tries to stay calm.
Sebastian tells her Theodore has restarted Brianna's heart twice already.

Twice.

That’s not a good sign.
We can heal from many things.
But if the heart gives up completely… it’s rare anyone comes back from that.

Isabella should be helping.
She’s the pack’s head physician.
Not Theodore, not the others she trained.
I’ve seen her work. She’s precise. Never misses a step.
But she refused to come when I linked her.
Now she’s ignoring me completely.

I stand up.
Athena’s blue eyes flick toward me.

“Please. Tell me the moment you hear anything.” The words almost choke me.
Brianna is my best friend.
We’ve been through everything together.
I can’t lose her because some fucking idiot shot her by mistake.

Athena nods.

I stop outside the hospital.
Debating whether to speak to Alexander about his sister.
Or confront my mate directly.
She should be here. I need to make her help.

I cross the grounds.
Pausing outside the packhouse.
Steeling myself for the fight I know is coming.

I pull the door open.
Charlotte comes flying down the stairs toward me.
Terror is written all over her round little face.
She throws herself into my arms.

“Hey. What’s wrong?”

“Something bad is in the house, Daddy.”

“What do you mean?”

“It’s dark upstairs.”

I look up the staircase.
Sunlight streams through the large windows.

“Don’t go up there, Daddy.” Her bright green eyes fill with tears as she glances toward the second floor.

“Who’s upstairs, Lottie?”

Her eyes meet mine, then drop.
She presses against my chest and whispers, “Isabella.”

“Anyone else?”

Charlotte shakes her head and shudders.
“Daddy, can we please leave?”

I back out of the house.
I can’t sense anything but the pain Isabella is radiating.

“Logan and Evrin are with Athena and Sebastian. Do you want to go there?”
I try to keep my voice calm.
But I’m not sure she believes me.

“Yes, please.” She nods frantically.

Part of me hopes she just woke from a nightmare.
But Isabella’s silence… her refusal to help Brianna…
It has me worried.

Sebastian answers the door.
He looks surprised to see us, but he smiles at Charlotte.

“Well, this is a nice surprise.” His comment makes her laugh.
For a moment, her fear vanishes.

“I’m sorry, Sebastian. Can you watch her for a bit?”

He studies my face.
“No problem. She’ll be safe here. The twins are about to wake up anyway. Athena’s making cakes.”

Charlotte runs inside without looking back.

“How bad is it?” Sebastian asks.

“Brianna’s critical. Alexander and Athena are with her.”

“He can’t lose anyone else.” Sebastian sighs.
“But that’s not what I meant.” He glances to make sure Charlotte is out of earshot.
“She said something about Isabella yesterday. She was half-asleep, so it didn’t make much sense.”

“She came running down the stairs… more terrified than when I rescued her from that bar. Isabella was the only one upstairs.”

“She can stay the night if needed.” Sebastian says. “Athena and I love having kids around again.”

I don’t have the heart to tell him there won’t be grandkids.

“I’ll let you know.”

I look around.
Normally, I’d handle this myself.
Isabella is my mate.
But Charlotte called her dark.
That pushed me out of my comfort zone.
Wolves don’t go dark. That’s a Lycan trait.

“Is my daughter okay?”

I turn to see Lucas coming toward me.

“Did you shoot Brianna?” I need to hear it from him.

“I’m sadistic sometimes. I enjoy killing Lycans. But I don’t kill pups. They’re still pure. If you hadn’t noticed, I could have taken any of you out by now. So I’ll ask again—how is my daughter?”

“Scared.”

“I know that, dumbass. What is she scared of?”

“My mate.”

His brows furrow. “She’s helping Brianna, right?”

Was that concern? Does he actually care about Brianna?

“No. Theodore is.”

As much as I hate him, maybe he can help.
He claims to see darkness in people.
I can’t lose my best friend and my mate in one day.

I tell him what happened with Charlotte.
Her fear. Her panic. Her desperate need to escape the house.

“You think Isabella’s lost it?” He asks carefully.

“I don’t know what to think. I know she’s not the woman I fell for. I know she’s shut down. I know she’s in pain she won’t talk about. I can barely get into her head. And when I do…”
###Chapter 0326

"It's chaos." He finishes my thought.

"Lycans can't be corrupted by the darkness."

"Don't be so certain, Zachary." His lips press into a thin line. Hearing my name from him felt strange, yet far better than his previous insults. His hazel eyes drift toward the pack house. "Recall what I explained about twin Lycans? How a fragment of each resides within the other?"

"Yes."

"Julian is confirmed dead. She now has a void in her soul. She lost the part of her that lived in him. That emptiness is vulnerable. Darkness can seep deep. She isn't like Athena. Isabella's Alpha genetics are weaker."

"Are you implying she's turning Rogue?" I press him.

"I'm stating we must proceed with extreme caution."

"Caution regarding what?" Alexander cuts in, joining us.

"Where are the Lycans?" I ask.

"Under guard. How is Brianna?"

"Too early to know for sure. But she lost the baby."

A frown flashes across Luc's face. He clearly cared for Brianna more than he admitted. It vanishes as quickly as it appeared. "We need to be cautious regarding your sister."

"Isabella?"

"You only have one sister. Correct?" Lucas Adler mutters, one eyebrow raised.

"Isn't she at the hospital assisting?"

"You would assume so, wouldn't you?!" Lucas retorts.

"That contradicts her character. She's always aspired to help others. Even as a child, she requested doctor's kits as toys. I permitted her to become the pack doctor instead of fulfilling our family's traditional role. Why would she refuse to aid Brianna? She knows your connection to her." He gestures toward me.

"I requested her help. She declined. When I repeated my request, she ignored me completely. Theodore is doing his utmost, but when I departed, her heart had already failed twice."

"Is Sebastian still there?"

I nod. "Athena is keeping him company."

He spins on his heel and marches decisively toward the packhouse. "Then I will compel her to assist."

"I doubt that approach will succeed." Lucas murmurs under his breath.

"He is her Alpha."

"If my suspicions are correct, his status will be irrelevant."

"Then you will accompany us." I push him forward, urging him to follow Alexander. He shoots me a lethal glare.

"Do not lay your hands on me again. Not if you value your well-being."

"Just move, damn it!"

"Remember, I can revoke your access to my daughter."

"Fine. Whatever. Just go and investigate what your daughter sensed!" I snap. I would never allow him to separate me from Lottie.

He ambles after Alexander, showing no inclination to hurry.

Lucas enters the packhouse. His tension is palpable, exceeding his usual demeanor. His eyes flicker toward the staircase. "My little girl was correct."

"So something is wrong with my mate?" I ask.

Thuds echo from upstairs. Alexander demands entry.

"You need to speak with her." Lucas tells me. "Choose your words with extreme care."

"If she even bothers to listen to me!"

Alexander continues pounding on the door as Lucas and I ascend the stairs.

"Isabella, open this door now, before I break it down!" Alexander shouts.

Silence answers. Yet I know with absolute certainty my mate is behind that door.

"Isabella?" I call her name softly, hoping to soothe her.

"Is she dead?" Her voice is hollow, completely devoid of its usual emotion.

"No." I reply. I'd received no update from Athena, and I clung to that hope.

"She deserves to be."

I recoil, stunned by her venomous response.

"Isabella!" Alexander bellows through the solid wood. "Get your ass up and go help her. Now!"

It was a direct Alpha command. Yet, no movement comes from the other side. Alexander's frown deepens, visibly thrown by her defiance.

He throws his weight against the door. It barely moves. I suspect she barricaded it with her heavy dresser.

He shoves again, gaining a minuscule amount of ground. "Now!" he demands.

Together, we force the door open.

Isabella stands motionless, staring out the window. "I told you not to come in."

"Why are you refusing to help Brianna?" Alexander demands.

"She didn't help my brother."

"If Brianna hadn't been taken by Seraphina, do you think he would have even returned here?" Alexander snaps.

"She withheld that information from us. She kept it secret until you were about to execute him. And look, you killed him anyway."

"Isabella, you know he was already gone. Nothing could have revived him. Surely a swift death here was preferable to a prolonged one miles away at the hands of that impostor."

She offers no reply.

"I should have ended this sooner. If you need to blame someone, blame me!"

She slowly turns to face the three of us. "What is this? An intervention?"

"Isabella, I understand your pain..." I begin.

"My brother is dead." Her eyes are disturbingly vacant.

"He made his choices." Alexander states coldly. "None of those choices aligned with our pack's welfare."

"You've been speaking with Athena."

"No. I was the one who told Athena that."
###Chapter 0327
Seraphina

My lungs screamed in agony. Being human was absolute torture. Even at this sluggish pace, I couldn't run more than a few minutes without collapsing.

Every step sent sharp pains shooting through my legs. A strange cramp pinched my side whenever I lost my breath.

I never appreciated my Lycan strength until now.

Leaning against a solitary tree, I gasped for air. The IV bags helped, but my throat felt like sandpaper. Levi Bennett lied about the nutrients being sufficient.

I scanned the open field. The sun dipped toward the horizon, and I was completely lost. I'd avoided roads, sticking to fields and wooded areas. Yet I hadn't seen any other escapees.

I needed to slow down, but every minute counted. Only one full IV bag remained, plus the partial one connected to my arm. Finding a Witch was urgent.

Entering a town seemed my only choice. A choice I dreaded.

I forced myself to walk faster. Though it probably matched my initial prison escape pace. Progress felt agonizingly slow.

Relief washed over me when I spotted a farmhouse. Even better, clothes hung on a washing line. Anything beat this medical gown.

I hurried toward the laundry, grateful the garments were dry. I pulled on slightly oversized jeans and grabbed a blue tee when someone cleared their throat.

"SHIT!" I whirled around. I never heard them approach.

A woman stood there, taller and curvier than me. Her arms were crossed, a wicker basket hooked on her elbow.

"For a second, I thought you were some man stealing my laundry." She studied me intently.

My heart hammered wildly. I couldn't defend myself in this state.

Her grey eyes dropped to the IV bag, then to the discarded gown. "Running from something?"

"You could say that."

"Lycan or Wolf?" My jaw went slack at her question. Her eyes drifted to my shaved head. "Troublemaker, definitely."

"Are you a Hunter?"

She burst into laughter, bending over until her blonde hair nearly touched the ground. She laughed until tears streamed down her face. "No, not even close."

"Then what are you?"

She straightened up, wiping her eyes. "I'm you, five years ago. So Lycan or Wolf?"

"Lycan, but..."

"Levi took that from you?"

"You know Levi?" What were the odds of finding someone in the middle of nowhere who knew my kidnapper? More likely she worked for him.

"That fucking bastard ruined my life." The woman gestured to my neck. "Where's your mate?"

"Dead." At least I believed he was. I couldn't feel our bond anymore.

"Shit, sorry. You look starved. Come inside, I'll make you food."

"I can't stop." I held up the IV bags. "I'm running out of time."

"No, you're not. Come in, I'll explain everything. But you answer my questions too."

I wasn't one to trust strangers, especially potentially dangerous ones. But I was exhausted, hungry, and aching everywhere. Food and rest sounded heavenly.

"I get your hesitation. I felt the same after escaping." She gave a warm smile.

"I'm so tired."

She nodded toward my hand clutching my side. "That pain is a stitch. Common for humans. Your leg muscles are cramping. You're probably dehydrated. Things you never worried about before."

"What about the IV bags?"

"A trick. Come inside, I'll explain everything."

Hesitantly, I followed her inside. "Sorry, I didn't get your name."

"Because I didn't give it. Evelyn Reed. But call me Evie or Eve, your choice."

"I'm Seraphina Kits... Seraphina Blackwood."

She raised an eyebrow but didn't question it. "Well Seraphina Blackwood. Welcome to my home."

Evie showed me around the spacious farmhouse. She offered me a bedroom for the night. When I shook my head, she promised I'd be safe.

I held up the IV bags, and she smiled. "They're not what you think, Seraphina. You can remove it from your arm."

"I'll die."

"No, you'll feel terrible pain for a few minutes. You'll feel like passing out, like Death is waiting. But I promise, it only lasts minutes. Then you'll feel normal. Well, as normal as possible now."
###Chapter 0328

"You're lying." Every instinct screamed this was a trap. Yet I remained rooted in place. Why hadn't I fled the moment she asked if I was Wolf or Lycan?

"If I'm lying, Seraphina, how do you explain my survival? I recognized that gown instantly." She turned toward a closet, retrieving a dusty box from the top shelf. Inside lay an identical gown to the prison uniform. "The only difference was this stupid band. Allergic reaction to painkillers. When they strip your healing abilities, you learn what doesn't work."

Evelyn handed it to me. The band clearly displayed her name and allergy type.

"And this." She passed me an empty drip bag. "I thought it was over too. Sat in that corner watching the last drops vanish into my arm. The pain was unbearable. That's why you believe you're dying. But you'll survive."

"Will my abilities return?"

She sighed. "No. He told you the same lie. That this poison takes everything away, and you can't live without it."

I nodded.

"Our brains believe anything when we hit rock bottom."

"Why don't our powers come back?"

"Because that bag didn't take them. Levi did when he first drugged you."

"He never found you here?"

"Making us Human removes our Lycan scent. We smell like every other human. But avoid familiar places. He checks them. He sends others to check them."

I frowned. My mother, stepfather, and siblings should be at Obsidian Howl. But I couldn't recall how long it had been since I'd seen them. I'd mentioned Athena to Levi. Would he search for me there? Especially knowing she was the Lycan Alpha.

"You must say goodbye to your old life, Seraphina."

She led me downstairs into the large kitchen. She extended her hand, glancing at the drip bag.

"I'm not sure about this."

"Would you rather wait until it runs out?" Evelyn asked softly.

"I'd prefer finding a Witch."

She shook her head. "How do you propose to do that?"

"I could track..." My voice trailed off. I couldn't track scents anymore.

"I know it's overwhelming. If you're not ready, we can try later."

I nodded. She gestured to the small kitchen table. "Let me make you a sandwich."

She moved around the kitchen while I sat quietly, weighing my options. She placed a sandwich and orange juice before me. "How did you escape?" I asked quietly.

"A nurse took me for my routine shower. I saw that little bar of soap and knew it was now or never. I shoved it down her throat. Drove my thumbs through her eyes while she choked. No cameras in the bathroom. Perfect killing spot. I climbed out the window."

"There are bars now." I muttered. I'd spent every shower searching for escape routes. My eyes had scanned every nook and cranny. Nothing.

"I figured."

"You never went back to help the others?"

Her face fell. Her grey eyes grew watery. "I believe the others were killed because I escaped. How did you get out?"

I frowned. "Would you believe me if I said the doors just opened? I thought they were bolted. Seems they were on timers too. Every door swung open. Almost everyone escaped. But that can't be right..." I looked at the drip bag. "I saw them dead in the hallways. They'd removed the drips."

"They'd only be down long enough for capture. Not dead." Evelyn told me.

"Why help me? Why offer food and shelter? You said I must be trouble."

"Like I said. I was you once. I wish I'd had someone to tell me this isn't the end."
###Chapter 0329
Lucas

Isabella’s soul is so profoundly dark it could rival any Rogue I’ve ever encountered. The moment I stepped inside, the oppressive energy hit me. Her bedroom was the epicenter, radiating pure shadow.

Earlier, talking to Zachary outside, I’d clung to a sliver of hope. Maybe my little girl had just woken from a nightmare. But no. She’s far more attuned to souls than I ever realized. Perhaps spending time with Athena awakened something in her.

In all my years as a Hunter, I’ve never seen a Wolf like this.

I’ve witnessed Wolves drowning in sorrow. I’ve seen them hollow out, becoming ghosts of who they were. But this? To be so consumed by a twisted sense of justice that it warps you into something else entirely? That’s new.

“Did you ever truly love our brother?” Isabella demands, her glare fixed on Alexander.

Her soul pulses violently. Whatever answer he gives won’t matter. She’s asking simply to hear herself speak. “Of course I loved him. I made a vow to our parents to protect both of you,” Alexander tells her, his voice strained.

“You stopped protecting him. You abandoned him.”

“He was a grown fucking man, Isabella. An adult who made his own choices. Choices that revolved solely around himself, with no regard for anyone else.” He shakes his head, disbelief etched on his face. “Have you forgotten what he did to Sebastian? Or that he tried to take Athena from me? Not to mention the countless others in this pack he managed to piss off. You weren’t exactly at the top of his list either!”

“You’re wrong.”

“Am I? Where was he when you were shattered because Gabriel rejected you? Oh, that’s right—too busy dealing with his own issues. By fucking more women.”

“Gabriel has nothing to do with this.”

“Doesn’t he? If I recall correctly, he’s the one who killed Sophia. That act is what sent Julian spiraling. When Gabriel cast you aside, I was the one who picked up the pieces.”

She glares, pure hatred radiating from her. Zachary moves toward her, cupping her chin and forcing her to meet his gaze. He must feel her rage through their bond.

Isabella’s eyes narrow to slits. She spits at him, snarling through clenched teeth. “Let go of me.”

“Isabella, this isn’t you,” Zachary murmurs, wiping the spit from his face. “Snap out of this before you cross a line you can’t come back from.”

She smirks coldly. “Why? Am I not your precious little mate anymore? Do I fail to obey your every command?”

He steps back, brow furrowed. “I don’t even know who you are anymore.”

“I don’t need your recognition,” she seethes.

“What is that supposed to mean?” Zachary demands.

Her dark eyes shift to me. “He’s going to kill me anyway. And you can’t stop him.”

I lift my hands, showing both men my gun is still tucked securely in my belt. I could draw it in a heartbeat if I chose to. But would I shoot the Alpha’s sister? If she were a Lycan, I wouldn’t hesitate.

Isabella is the one Wolf here I’ve had the least interaction with. She was either at the hospital with Julian or locked away asleep here. I never saw her walking the grounds. Never heard her speaking to anyone.

But I did wonder what losing her twin would do to her. How far would the grief drag her down?

Turns out, the answer is damn far.

“He won’t kill you,” Zachary mutters, though it sounds more like a question. “Will you?” His eyes search mine, but I remain silent. I can’t give him an honest answer. “He will if I ask him to,” Isabella replies with a careless shrug. “Killing Rogues is what he does best.” Her gaze locks on me. “Right?”
###Chapter 0330

"You're not a Rogue!" Zachary snaps.

His eyes narrow at Isabella. "All those questions you asked Athena." Alexander frowns. "You weren't asking about her. You were asking for yourself, weren't you?"

She presses her lips into a thin line.

"You wanted to know what it felt like." He continues. "You wanted to know how to control it. You wanted to know if you were feeling the same thing she felt."

She just shrugs. Giving no clear answer.

"What does your Wolf think?" I ask.

She snorts at me. "Midnight hasn't spoken since Julian's machines shut down. But I know she hates me. She hates you." She points at Alexander, then her mate. "And you."

Her hand moves to the mark on her neck. She faces Zachary. "I thought this was forever. But you care more about your friend than me."

"I never said that. It is forever." Zachary mutters. "You are my mate. I just asked you to help her. She has been nothing but kind to you!"

"Until she swooped in and tried to take my place."

"What are you talking about, Isabella?" Alexander demands. "Have you become that self-centered?"

"A brat?" She laughs, but her eyes stay cold.

"That's how you're acting." Alexander growls. "You're not the sister I raised. You're turning out exactly like Julian!"

She smiles smugly. "We are twins after all."

"Isabella." Zachary sighs.

She puts her hands up. Shakes her head. "That's why you're here now, isn't it? To force me to help the dying Lycan while I deal with my own problems."

"Her name is Brianna. Don't bullshit me. I know you liked her. So help her."

"No."

"You made an oath." Alexander snaps. "You promised to help look after our pack."

"I did."

"If you're saying Brianna isn't part of this pack, then you're saying I'm not either!" Zachary frowns.

"Zachary is the Beta here." Alexander reminds Isabella. Though I'm starting to think nothing is getting through to her. She's too far gone. Trapped in her own chaotic mind.

"And he couldn't even be bothered to take an oath to link you all." She half-laughs, amused. "That suggests he doesn't really want to be here. Or maybe he just favors his own kind over us."

Zachary takes a step back. Frustration and confusion cloud his face.

"Alexander, I need to speak to you." I mutter.

He glances at me. Nods in acknowledgement.

"You can say what you need to say right here, Lucas." Isabella snarls.

"Fine!" I smile back at her. Turn to Alexander. "Some promises just can't be kept."

"What kind of cryptic message is that?" Isabella demands.

"It's not cryptic. Alexander understands exactly what I'm saying."

She glares at me. All her anger is aimed my way. But she stays completely still.

Silence falls between the four of us.

The other men don't know what to say to Isabella. She seems to be waiting for us to speak.

"So what's your plan, Isabella?" I ask.

"Excuse me?" That wasn't the question she expected.

"This. It's part of your plan, right? What do you hope to achieve? Do you want Zachary to reject you? Do you plan on killing everyone for some revenge plot for your brother? What is it that you, Isabella Black, want?"

"I don't know, Lucas. Maybe I want you to tell everyone how you're mated to a Lycan!" She folds her arms across her chest. Looks pleased with herself.

Alexander and Zachary both turn to stare at me.

"Is this how it's going to go? You're going to start telling lies about people?"
###Chapter 0331
Athena

Sebastian remained silent for a long time.
He sat completely still, holding my hand as we waited for news from Theodore.
It felt like hours had passed.
Maybe it had been.
I wondered if Alexander had felt this same dread every time I ended up in the medical wing.
Wondering if he’d never hear my voice again.
Somewhere along the way, I had started to care about Brianna’s survival.

I watched the room like a hawk, waiting for the slightest change.
Theodore had to be nearly done.
I still wished Isabella was here to help.
She’s exceptional at what she does.

The door finally opened.
Theodore stepped out wearing a gown soaked in blood.
I pulled Sebastian up from the floor.
We stood in silence as he approached us.
“She’s alive. Barely.” He let out a heavy sigh of relief.

'Thank the moon.' Nyx whispered.

“Thank you, Theodore.”

“It wasn’t easy, but she’s a fighter. She refused to let go.”

Sebastian’s hand tightened around mine. “Her heart stopped.”

“And we brought her back. She’s extremely weak and has lost a lot of blood. I need to check if any of the Lycans are a match for a transfusion.”
“Me.” I muttered.

“No. Too risky.” Theodore said firmly.

“Can I see her?” Sebastian asked quietly.

“Of course. Give the nurses a few minutes to clean up. She’s unconscious and will be for a while.”

“I’ll tell Zachary.” I preferred to do it in person rather than through mind-link. “I’ll ask him to come get tested.”

I waited until Sebastian was cleared to go sit with his mate.
Then I headed to the packhouse.
I had a feeling Zachary had gone to question Isabella about why she wasn’t helping.
I wanted to know why, too.

Something felt off as I entered the packhouse.
It reminded me of the day the boys were killed in Alexander’s office.
An eerie feeling hung in the air.

I heard Alexander call someone delusional.
Isabella’s screech followed. “I’m not the delusional one! You’re the one who can’t see what’s right in front of you!”

Slowly, I climbed the stairs, listening to their argument.
It wasn’t just Alexander and Isabella.
Zachary and Lucas were there too.
But they could barely get a word in over the siblings’ yelling.

“Isabella, this isn’t you.” Zachary muttered, sounding lost.
His usual tricks to calm his mate weren’t working.

“Maybe this is me. You said it yourself, didn’t you Lucas? My soul died. Or was that another lie?”

“It wasn’t.” Lucas replied coldly.
He was probably staring at her the same way he did when curious about my reactions.
Or maybe his hand was already resting on a gun, ready to blow Isabella’s head off.
I hoped not.

'Something is wrong here.' Nyx groaned. 'Why wouldn’t she help? It’s her purpose.'

'I don’t know. I want to say she’s grieving, but that doesn’t fit. She checked over Hannah after the fire.'

“So you can tell the truth about some things.” Isabella’s tone dripped with sarcasm.

“That’s enough, Isabella!” Alexander warned.

“I don’t think it is.” She shouted back.
I heard glass shattering.

Hurrying to her room, I found Alexander and Lucas restraining Isabella.
The window behind her was shattered.
Her dark eyes locked onto me.
A twisted grin spread across her face. “You should never have come here. We were happy before you. We were powerful before you. We had control before you.”

'Does this seem like Isabella to you?' Nyx asked. 'It’s not her. She’s gone from quiet and grieving to outright vicious.'

I stared at Isabella, struggling between the two men.
Something was wrong.
It was more than just losing her twin.
Her words sounded exactly like Julian.
Too much like him when he didn’t get what he wanted.

'You don’t think....' It didn’t feel like Isabella. I could smell her scent. She looked like herself, but the words coming out of her mouth were nothing like her.

'I don’t know if that’s even possible.' Nyx muttered.

'There’s only one way to find out.'

I moved closer to Isabella. “You couldn’t help Brianna because you didn’t know how, did you?”
###Chapter 0332

“What do you mean?” Alexander frowned.

I avoided his gaze and pressed a finger to my temple. Hoping he’d understand—I needed him inside my head. To hear my racing thoughts. If I was right… I prayed I wasn’t.

Isabella gave a faint smile. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”

“Yes, you do.”

Alexander stared at me like I’d lost my mind. But stranger things had happened. Everyone knew Isabella and Julian shared more than a birthday. Lucas had said they carried pieces of each other’s souls.

Lucas also spoke of darkness seeping in. Finding a crack and spreading. What if that could happen between twins who shared twin wolves? They did have part of each other inside.

“You moved them all in while I wasn’t watching,” Isabella muttered. She stopped struggling against Alexander and Lucas. “You brought more Lycans when I couldn’t stop you.”

“What’s going on?” Zachary demanded. “Someone explain!”

Alexander held up a hand, silencing him. I kept my focus on the person in front of me.

“Where is Isabella?” I demanded.

Zachary stared at me, completely lost.

“I knew you were clever, Athena. From the very first day I saw you. Peeking around the corner at Silver Creek. Shy.” “Isabella wasn’t at Silver Creek,” Alexander muttered.

“No. But Julian was.” I studied Isabella’s face. She had made me feel welcome here before Alexander did. Her advice was harsh, but I valued her honesty. Now, I didn’t recognize the being standing before me.

How could one soul be overtaken by another?

Tears threatened, but I held them back. Was Isabella still in there? She had to be. Zachary was still connected to her.

“How long?” I demanded.

Her lips curved, but she stayed silent. I grabbed her face. Claws extended from my fingertips. She growled as they pierced her skin. “How fucking long?”

“Athena!”

I ignored Alexander. I needed answers. Now. Before anyone thought about leaving.

Her dark eyes locked on mine. They looked hollow. Empty in a way I’d never seen.

“It started in the hospital.” Her gaze shifted to Lucas. “You told us about our souls. How part of us lives inside the other. I heard you and wondered… what if I could become my sister? And look. It worked.”

Blood trickled from her cheeks, but I kept my claws steady. Any deeper, and I might kill her. Him. Them. I didn’t even know what to call this thing. “Where is Isabella?” I repeated.

“Almost gone.”

“This can’t be real,” Zachary whispered. “You can’t steal someone’s soul! Isabella, come on. This is just grief over Julian. We know you’re hurting.”

“You’re right. I am grieving. Grieving how pathetic this pack has become. Full of fucking Lycans everywhere I look. One as Luna. One as Beta. What’s next? Oh, right. The pack heirs are Lycans too.”

My claws dug deeper. “You slept with one.”

“I wanted to know what it was like to fuck you. To have you under me, moaning my name. I didn’t see Seraphina. All I saw was you, Athena Harrison.”

Disgust twisted my stomach. Julian had gone to her because she looked like me. He was always taking what wasn’t his.

'I’ll kill him!' Nyx snarled.

'Not yet.'

I held my claws in place. More blood welled up as I leaned in close. Isabella and Julian looked so alike. Up close, you could forget everything except the face in front of you. I wanted to see him when I said my next words.

“But you’ll never have the real thing.”

I released her. Blood spurted from the wounds. They healed quickly as my claws retracted.

“Bitch!”

A gunshot rang out, deafeningly loud. As Isabella’s body hit the floor, I turned. Expecting to see Lucas holding the weapon.

But it was Zachary.

###Chapter 0334
Zachary

Her body slammed against the wall.
Blood sprayed from my mate’s collarbone.
I had aimed there on purpose.
Not her heart.
Her body could heal from a shoulder wound.
It couldn’t heal from death.
I needed to know if Isabella was truly gone.

Lucas stared at me, his hand moving toward the gun in his belt.
He frowned when he realized the weapon I held wasn’t his.
His remained securely holstered.
He shot me a disapproving look but stayed silent.

I wasn’t stupid.
I knew how to handle firearms.
I used them back when I was human.
With a Hunter in the pack, I decided it was smart to carry one again.
Sometimes I surprised myself by not having drawn it on him sooner.

"You shot me!" roared the voice that might have been Isabella’s—or maybe it was Julian’s.
I couldn’t tell anymore.
I saw my mate’s face, but the words sounded nothing like her.

I never thought it possible—what Athena claimed.
That a soul could overtake another’s body.
Then again, I once didn’t believe in werewolves.
Or Lycans.
Now I was ready to kill the person who wore my mate’s face.

I honestly never thought I’d pick up a gun again.

I kept the weapon steady as Isabella clutched her shoulder.
She slid down the wall, leaving a bloody smear.
I wasn’t sure I could actually kill my mate.
Even if she wasn’t in there anymore.
But I could slow her down.

"Zachary." Alexander’s voice was a low growl. "What the hell are you doing?"
His hand closed over the gun, but I didn’t release it.

I met his glare. "She’s a threat now. Whether you accept it or not."

A harsh laugh burst from Isabella.
It was all wrong.
Her body straightened. "You’ll have to do better than that, Lycan!"

"Give me the gun, Zachary."

"No." My finger tightened on the trigger.
Alexander released his grip and stepped in front of his sister. "You can’t kill her. She’s your mate."
Why didn’t he say she was his sister first?

"She is. But he isn’t. I can kill him."

A dull ache spread through my chest.
My heart hammered wildly.
Heavier with every beat.
Sparks of pain shot through my body.
I was losing her.
Fast.

"Why are you doing this?" Athena demanded, staring at my mate.
I noticed a thin trail of blood from her left ear.
She’d been standing close when the gun fired.

"Second chance," the voice replied.

"You’ve had more than a second chance," Alexander snapped. "You’re like a damn cat with nine lives."

"Big brother, you know me so well." My mate smirked and released her shoulder.
The wound had nearly healed.
The bullet went straight through.

Alexander pulled Lucas aside.
I heard him ask if there was any way to get Isabella back.
Lucas shook his head slightly while my mate watched me.

"Maybe with a Witch. But by then, it would be too late," Lucas whispered.

"I can lock her in the dungeon," Alexander suggested.

"You’ll still be too late."

I stared at my mate while Alexander brainstormed ideas.
Why had Isabella let this happen?
Why did she give up?
Why didn’t she fight for her life?

'Come back to me, Isabella.'
I tried linking her, hoping to hear her voice.
Her face turned toward me.
A slow smile curled her lips.

“She can’t hear you. She’s resting now!”
I wanted to punch that smile off his face.
But it would be her body I hit.

I looked at Lucas, my heart stalling. "She’s really gone, isn’t she?"

He turned and studied Isabella’s body. "Yes."
###Chapter 0335

"Can she return?"

"When a soul has fully departed, it cannot."

I lift the weapon, my finger resting on the trigger. My vision narrows until only her form remains. The surrounding voices fade into distant echoes.

Memories flood my mind. Our first meeting at the gates. Following her into the forest, watching her speak to herself—later learning it was her Wolf. Our first kiss. The softness of her skin beneath my touch. Her stubborn denial of her own snoring. She had let me in completely, and now I feel her fading away.

My chest tightens, making each breath a struggle. She was meant to be my lifelong mate, but grief consumed her. She was pushed out. She abandoned us.

I lower the gun and step back from the room. She was gone. Truly gone. That thing wasn't her.

Athena shouts orders about keeping Isabella contained. She appears in the hallway moments later. "You shot her."

"That isn't her." I meet my Alpha's steady blue gaze. Amid the chaos, she remains unnervingly calm. She sees what we cannot. "What would you do?"

"Lucas said her soul is gone. Do you feel it too?"

I nod. I've never wanted to hide from the world before. I've always confronted it head-on. But losing a mate is an agony unlike any other. It's a deep, consuming sorrow. Nothing makes sense anymore.

"She gave up." I slam my fist against the wall. "After everything we fought for, she fucking gave up!"

Athena stays silent. She lets me punch the wall repeatedly without flinching.

When I finally stop, my bruised knuckles are already healing, fueling my frustration. I turn to her. "Why are you so calm?"

"Give me your hand."

She takes my hand and presses it against her chest. Alexander would lose his mind if he saw this.

"The exterior doesn't always match the interior." I had once told her that. A reminder that things aren't always as they seem. Now she uses my own words against me, for Isabella.

Her heart beats steadily beneath my palm, but it's more than just a rhythm. It's a low, constant hum. Yet outwardly, she appears completely composed.

"I feel Alexander's pain, though he'd never admit it." She sighs. "I feel the loss of a friend. I'm trapped between impossible choices where every decision impacts everyone. You can't make this call about Isabella or... Julian." She frowns. "Neither can Alexander. This responsibility falls on me."

She turns toward the closed door where Isabella's voice demands release. "I am Alexander's Luna. I am the Lycan Alpha. Ending this suffering is my duty."

"Was this always his plan?"

"How could it be? He didn't know until he overheard Lucas discussing souls. Anyone else would be dead already. Isabella kept him clinging on just long enough for him to force his way in. We all fell for it except Charlotte."
###Chapter 0336
Athena

The silence in the room is heavy as I step back inside. Lucas Adler’s hazel eyes are locked on Isabella. Alexander is pacing quietly, lost in thought.

I can feel his pain like a physical ache. It doesn’t show on the surface. His crimson eyes burn with rage, not sorrow. His expression is stern, but controlled. No clenched fists. No labored breathing. He’s eerily calm. The kind of calm that comes before destruction.

His gaze snaps to me and he freezes. He knows exactly what I’m about to do. I feel Zachary step in behind me. He closes the door softly. The gentle click of the latch echoes in the tense quiet.

'We can do this.' Nyx whispers, though only I can hear. 'It’s necessary. You know it is.'

That doesn’t make it any easier.

“You won’t kill me, Athena.” Isabella’s voice mocks me. “I’m your closest friend.” I stare at the face I know so well. I have to remember she’s already gone. This isn’t her anymore.

“You’re just a soul hiding in a body that doesn’t belong to you.” I snap back.

She smiles. I hear a faint cracking sound. Julian is trying to force a shift. I won’t allow it. My hand closes around Isabella’s arm just as the bones begin to break under my grip. If he thinks shifting will let him escape, he’s wrong.

I begin my own shift. My hand transforms first. Claws extend. Fur spreads up my arm. My shift seems to disrupt his. Maybe he didn’t expect this.

For someone who prided himself on strategy, he should have seen it coming. He should have known there was no escape. Or perhaps he simply didn’t know me as well as he thought.

Those dark eyes find mine. Filled with hatred. Burning with fury.

“I’m sorry I couldn’t save you, Isabella.”

My claws plunge deep into her chest.

I keep my eyes forward. If I look at any of the men, the tears I’m holding back will erupt.

Her eyes drop to where my claws are buried. Julian probably thought I’d hesitate because it was her body, not his.

I retract my claws.

Julian stumbles back against the wall. One hand clutches the wound. The other slams against the wall for support. It’s useless. She collapses to the floor. Blood spills from her partially shifted form, soaking her legs and the carpet. Her dark eyes stare up at me until she slumps over, motionless. The room is as still as she is.

My heart hammers in my chest. The room blurs. I killed my friend. I killed Alexander’s sister. I killed Zachary’s mate.

'It wasn’t Isabella.' Nyx reminds me. 'And it was necessary. He was too dangerous.'

'I need air. Now.'

I step back and bump into Zachary. He just watches me as I turn to face him. He knew this was coming. Yet I still feel like I’ve betrayed him. Betrayed Alexander.

I shove past him and burst through the door. The blood pounds in my ears.

'It was the right thing to do.' I whisper to myself, repeating Nyx’s words as I crash into my bedroom.

'It was.' Nyx confirms.

I know it was. I know Julian had to be stopped. So why do I feel so sick?
###Chapter 0337

'Athena, you're panicking.' Nyx's voice is unnervingly calm.

"I killed Isabella." I whisper as I shift back to human form.

'No. You killed Julian. Isabella was already gone. Zachary confirmed it. You can feel what Alexander is feeling. Her body was just an empty shell!'

I knew I was panicking. I didn't understand why. I had made my intentions clear to Zachary. No one tried to stop me. They all wanted this too, right?

'Yes.' Nyx agrees, though I hadn't asked her.

I quickly pull on leggings and a sweatshirt. I jam my feet into boots. I needed to get out. I needed to think.

My legs carry me out of the house. Or maybe it was Nyx. I wasn't sure. Focusing was difficult. I didn't care as long as I could breathe.

Killing those who harmed me had been easy until now. I keep telling myself it was Julian as I run into the forest. Yet all I see is Isabella.

'Athena, we have to stop.' Nyx mutters.

I can't stop. But I wasn't running away either. I just needed to keep moving.

'ATHENA!' My own name roars inside my head. I come to a complete stop. 'Athena, it's okay to feel this. I liked Isabella too. But there was nothing you could do to save her. She was already gone.' Nyx continues reminding me.

I slump down on a fallen tree trunk. The tears break free. I look around, half expecting Alexander or even Zachary. Neither had followed me. I was alone.

'You are not alone. I am right here. This is a new feeling for us.'

'Right.' I swallow the lump in my throat.

'We couldn't let him parade as Isabella. Not after everything. Not after all his lies.' Nyx tells me. 'You know this, Athena.'

Nodding, I take a deep breath. A twig cracks not far behind me. Wiping my tears away, I'm on my feet. I sniff the air. A Lycan was heading towards me. Someone from the pack I didn't know well.

"Athena?" The voice calls out. "Athena, it's Caleb. Is everything okay? I saw you running. I wanted to check...."

"I'm fine." I mutter back. He steps through the trees anyway. He looked odd among the trees. Like he didn't quite belong.

He frowns when he sees me. "Do you want me to get Alexander or someone else?"

"No."

"Has something happened?" He parks himself on the fallen tree a little way from me. “Is it Seraphina? Is she here?” His eyes dart around the nearby area.

I snort. With everything happening, I hadn't thought about her. "No. Nothing to do with Seraphina."

"The girl, Brianna. Is she okay? Did she make it?"

"She's in good hands."

"That's good news. The others in the training hall are being guarded."

I had forgotten about those Lycans too. I didn't even know where they were. "Right."

"It's not my place to tell you what to do, Athena. Considering what my stepdaughter has done, I appreciate you letting us stay here. If there is anything I can do, I am happy to help."

"Ever killed someone you care about? Or sort of cared about?" I wasn't sure how to explain Julian and Isabella's souls.

I feel his gaze on me. He's quiet for a few minutes. Choosing his words carefully.

“If we kill someone we care about, it is normally for good reason. Something that's been thought about. Options weighed. I am certain you had a good reason. I've watched you from afar. You don't rush into things. But when forced, your decisions are valid."
###Chapter 0338

“But were they the right ones to eliminate?”

He lifts a brow, waiting.

“I knew they had to die. They were trouble from the start. Did something unforgivable.” I kept it vague. Maybe Alexander wouldn’t want it known his sister was gone. “I’ve only ever executed threats. Those who endangered the pack. This one was…” I trailed off as Isabella’s smiling face flashed behind my eyes.

“A leader who doesn’t question their choices is a poor one.” He exhaled slowly. “I’ve heard the stories. Where you came from. What happened. How you were raised. Everything since. Most train for years to lead. Alexander was groomed since birth. I was thrust into it, though I was never an Alpha. You’ve had what, three years?”

Was that all? It felt like lifetimes. “A year of that was just learning who I am,” I murmured.

“Athena, you were thrown into something vast. Beyond any of us. And you are more than capable. Your choice is yours alone.”

“What if it harms those around me? What if they can’t accept what I did?”

“Perhaps you must accept it first.” He shifted on the tree trunk; it looked uncomfortable for his large frame. “Never thought I’d be the one advising you.”

I studied him. He seemed amused.

“Is that how you feel about Seraphina? You accepted she must die, so you’re at peace with it?”

“Yes. Zoe knew long before I did. Her own mother. I suppose I believed I could be the father she needed. But she only ever learned to care for herself.”

‘Just like Julian,’ Nyx sighed. I felt her concern for me. But I didn’t regret the act. It was Isabella’s face stuck in my mind, twisting my thoughts. Like poisoning my parents all over again.

Caleb and I turned at the sound of footsteps. Alexander’s woody scent hit me, and my body went rigid. Caleb had come out before him. Alexander hadn’t followed me earlier. That only meant one thing. He was furious.

“I’ll leave you to it.” Caleb walked toward Alexander. He paused briefly, but I couldn’t hear their words.

‘I feel his anger from here,’ I told Nyx. ‘He’s angry. Frustrated. Hurt. Because of me.’

I stayed perfectly still as he strode over. Even without his scent, I’d know his walk anywhere.

My body stayed locked against the tree, my chest aching with each pounding heartbeat. I kept my gaze down as he stopped before me. That old feeling of awaiting a scolding washed over me. He was the only one who could still make me feel that small. And yet he’d never once harmed me.

His hands locked around my wrists and yanked me to my feet. My eyes remained lowered until he tipped my chin up, forcing me to meet his brilliant crimson gaze.

“You should not have done that.”

I opened my mouth to argue.

“You weren’t ready. You should have let me end it.”
###Chapter 0339

Hi everyone.

I know you're all waiting for an update.

It probably won't happen today.

My little red car broke down.

I'm stuck on the side of the road right now.

Just waiting for a tow truck.

The downside of driving an older vehicle.

If I make it back before the deadline, I'll do my best to post.

Otherwise, it'll have to wait.

Stay safe.

###Chapter 0340
Lucas

Funerals were pointless rituals.
Death comes for everyone eventually.
True goodbyes aren't spoken beside coffins.
These ceremonies aren't for the departed.
They're performances for those who believe in better places.

Athena clung to Alexander.
His hand gripped hers tightly as she leaned into him.
She appeared lost and uncertain.
Her eyes darted between the coffins and Alexander.
Perhaps she'd never experienced a funeral before.

Not everyone received such ceremonies.
In my judgment, Julian deserved no funeral.
Not after his treacherous actions.

The area overflowed with people.
Wolves stood packed shoulder to shoulder.
Lycans maintained their distance.
This affair didn't concern them.
They likely preferred remaining uninvolved.

Zachary stood on Alexander's other side.
He'd been silent since earlier.
His soul radiated confusion and frustration.
I watched and waited.
Wondering when he'd revert to his Rogue nature.
That was my true purpose here.

I expected him to break when Alexander left for Athena.
But he simply stood motionless.
Watching Isabella's blood seep into the ground.

Alexander cleared his throat.
He muttered a few ceremonial words.
He asked if anyone wished to speak.
All eyes turned to Zachary.
They expected heartfelt words about his mate.
He gave Alexander the slightest head shake.
Barely perceptible to human eyes.

The coffins lowered into the earth.
Beside their parents' graves.
Though after recent events, burning the bodies would've been wiser.

As people took turns tossing dirt, Hannah's jasmine scent hit me.
It invaded my senses so violently it caused physical pain.
Glancing over my shoulder, I spotted her nearby.
Her hands were shoved deep in her pockets.
She kicked a stone on the ground.
Her chestnut eyes flickered toward me before darting away.
At least she'd stopped overreacting to my presence.

Today, anyway.
Her emotions fluctuated more than a hungry pregnant woman's.

Her eyes snapped back to mine.
She thought I'd looked away.
They widened when she realized I'd caught her.
Pink flushed up her neck.
Spreading across her pale face.

She frantically scanned the area.
But unless she fled into the forest, nowhere offered hiding here.

Slipping from the funeral, I strode past her.
Heading into the forest before she attracted attention.
As expected, she followed me.
"What are you doing, Hannah?" I demanded when we were concealed.
"I wanted to say I'm not afraid of you anymore!"

"Really?" I suppressed a laugh.
Wondering how long she'd rehearsed that line.
"Alexander is burying his siblings, and you choose now for this declaration?"

"Yes!" she muttered with forced confidence.

"So you won't be throwing yourself into fires again?"

She dropped her gaze to the forest floor.
Shaking her head slowly.
"It hurts," she whispered.
Not referring to the fire.

"You're obsessed with this fantasy of yours."

"It's not fantasy, and you know it."
"I just want to know why you haven't rejected me?"

I remained silent as she shifted her weight.
She'd asked multiple times now.
Despite denying the mate bond, I never answered her question.
Why couldn't I speak the words?
She'd be free to find someone else.

The thought of another man touching her sickened me.
Enzo's mark still lingering on her neck was bad enough.

"What do you want from me, Hannah?"

"I don't know. You're constantly in my thoughts."
She frowned deeply.
"And not in a good way!"

I raised an eyebrow. "I shouldn't be. I'm a Hunter."

She leaned against a tree, crossing her arms beneath her breasts.
Avoiding my gaze.
"I've dealt with terrible men for years. You're not the first."

"And if I recall correctly, I shot one of them."
"So what changed? Where's this new confidence coming from?"

She scowled bitterly. "Why must you mock me?"

I kept my thoughts to myself.

"Do you think this is her game? Making us suffer to test our strength?"

"Who?"

"The Moon Goddess, obviously."

"I doubt the Moon Goddess controls your life."
"In fact, I don't believe in her."

Her jaw dropped. "You don't? But you're a Wolf."

I shook my head. "I believe in higher powers, but not her."
"If she existed, wouldn't it be sickening that she forces her creations to fight?"
"No, this reeks of conflict between higher powers."
###Chapter 0341

She stares at me with utter bewilderment. They all reacted that way whenever I brought up higher powers. As if the idea of something beyond the Moon Goddess governing our existence had never occurred to them.

"Consider this, Hannah. Rogue Lycans exist to control the human population. I'm a Wolf who kills Lycans. Lycans were hidden from ordinary Wolves until Athena revealed them. This is all orchestrated by higher powers. A test. A method to determine who ultimately prevails."

“Then why would they pair Wolves and Lycans together?"

"It wouldn't be the first twisted thing they've done."

A storm of emotions crosses her face. She struggled to process my words. "Have you.... Have you told the Alpha?"

"No. And don't ask, because I won't. She has enough to deal with. She doesn't need my theories adding to her burden."

Hannah sighs, dropping her arms to pick at the tree bark. "The others don't trust me."

"Who?" Her comment irritates me. That same protective feeling I had when she tried to throw herself into the fire returns. I cared.

I shudder, but she doesn't notice.

"The Lycans. I can't shift. That makes me weak."

"Have you ever shifted?"

She shakes her head. The sunset light breaks through the trees, illuminating her deep red waves. "It's true what I said. I can do everything except shift. You saw the burns—I still healed. I can link with Athena. I just can't....shift." I expected disappointment, but she sounds utterly defeated.

"Why tell me this?"

“I thought because of the........” Her words fade as she notices my frown. “I just thought maybe you could help me?"

Multiple footsteps approach rapidly. Many were still participating in the pack run tonight. Some found it beneficial to burn off their worries and frustrations. Others simply craved the freedom and power of the full moon.

I was supposed to join them.

I grab Hannah's bicep, pulling her away from the incoming crowd. "Go home, Hannah."

"If you won't reject me, you can't hide this forever! Nathan already knows, and Brianna does too!!" She half-shouts. I slam her against the tree, covering her mouth. I count to thirty, listening for any reaction, but howls and running feet fill the air. No one noticed us; they were already consumed by the moon's haze.

"Are you trying to get yourself killed? Is that your goal?" I growl. "Some insane death wish because you can't fucking shift?”

She shakes her head beneath my hand. Her gaze bores into mine. Only one other person had ever looked at me like that—like she could see beyond my exterior.

Lowering my hand, Hannah pushes off the tree, closing the distance between us. Her breath carries the scent of her recent dinner. She shakes her head again. "You don't have to help me. I just asked because..."

"Because you need a man to save you?" I sneer as her jasmine scent makes my head pound. I desperately want to push her away, yet part of me wants to take her right here.

It's been years since I've felt this way about anyone. Her proximity makes walking away incredibly difficult.

"No!" She's frustrated by my response. "Because you know so much, and I thought... maybe you've encountered this before. That's all." She glances away. "You tried to help Athena."

She looks over my shoulder, pressing her rosy lips into a thin line. There's no one behind me—I would have sensed them long before she did.

Her chestnut eyes return to me. "I should go."

She wasn't talking about returning to the house she'd been staying in since the fire.

“No. You need to stay where I can watch you." Until I decide what to do. I need to keep her safe, at the very least.

"Why? You can't stand me!"

"When did I say that?" I counter. Her heart skips a beat. "I've told you twice now that you need to be where I can keep an eye on you. If you're out there alone, I won't be able to save you from yourself. Again!"

"I've spent years being manipulated. I won't live like that anymore. I refuse to. Just because I'm less of a Lycan than the others doesn't give you the right to mess with me. Do you hear me?!"

I press my lips against hers. She freezes, stunned by my reaction. When I pull back, her eyes are wide. "Loud and clear."
###Chapter 0342
Seraphina

"He won't find you here. I don't understand why you refuse to believe me. I've lived here five years and he hasn't come anywhere close."

"How could you possibly know that?" I frown while scanning the open fields. Evelyn continues gathering eggs from her chickens, completely unbothered as I remain on high alert.

I'd been here almost a week and still couldn't relax. No matter how many times she said it, I kept expecting to see Levi and his creepy glassy-eyed nurses coming for me.

Evelyn had shared parts of her prison story, but aside from what I told her, I couldn't bring myself to say more. It was a memory I wanted to forget, yet I couldn't let it go because I was still waiting, preparing for a fight I knew I'd lose.

Part of me wanted to go back. To drive a knife straight through his heart. To help the others escape. But I stood no chance. Not anymore. "Can I ask you something?" I say as she closes the chicken coop. "Do you feel like you deserved this?"

"The farm?" She asks, looking confused.

"No. Losing your Lycan nature."

She slowly walks back toward the house with her wicker basket full of eggs. A heavy frown settles on her face. She stops just outside the kitchen door and turns to face me. "I didn't at first. After a while, I understood why Levi did what he did. Sometimes I still struggle with wishing I had certain abilities, like smelling approaching storms, being able to heal quickly, running without getting winded. Human stitches are terrible!" She winks at me.

"You think you deserved it?" I ask, surprised by her response.

"No, but I've learned much about myself these past five years. Honestly, I wasn't a good Lycan. Maybe it taught me a lesson. Maybe it was already written in my story so I could help you." She gives me one of her bright smiles.

"You believe that?"

She shrugs and sets the egg basket on the counter. I watch as she expertly pulls her long blonde hair into a bun. My own hair now made me look like a toilet brush with how short and spiky it was.

"It doesn't matter what I believe, Seraphina. But we do know I'm right about some things. You survived without that stupid IV drip. You didn't want to believe that either."

I look at my arm where the connection tube had been. A large purple bruise still lingered, though it was shrinking daily and part had turned a sickly green color. Humans were so fragile, and I was one now. I couldn't afford to be reckless anymore.

"That was the worst night of my life." I mutter.

"But you survived, just like I said you would."

"I thought I was going to die!"

Evelyn gives me a lopsided grin. "So dramatic. Though I'm still waiting to hear more about this half-sister of yours."

Apparently I'd muttered something about Athena during the excruciating pain and blackout moments. Evelyn had asked me several times since, but I always shut down. It might be different if I'd met her under different circumstances.

She pours me a glass of juice and sets it before me. "Seraphina, I'm going to ask you something and I need you not to freak out. I want the truth." She takes a deep breath. "Was Levi holding you because you did something to your half-sister?"

"No."

"Seraphina, don't lie to me. I'm trying to help you."

"It wasn't because of her. He didn't even know she was my sister, not at first. He would have if he'd met her."

"That's all I need to know."

"Seriously? You don't want to know more?"

"It's not about what I want to know. It's about you telling me the truth."

"Would you have even known if I lied?" I ask curiously.

"You're human now. Of course I would have."

As Evelyn lights the fire, its warm glow fills the small sitting room. I decide to take the risk and tell her everything.
###Chapter 0343

"My half sister is named Athena Harrison. She's the female Lycan Alpha." I whisper, watching the flames dance.

She freezes. "What?"

"It's true. We share the same father. We look identical, like twins. But we have different mothers."

"Why tell me this now?"

"Would it have mattered?"

She gives a soft smile. "Yes. I could've helped you reach her. She can stop Levi."

I shake my head. Going to her was never an option. She'd kill me on sight. I couldn't even defend myself.

"I tried to ruin her." The words tumble out.

In Levi's prison, I had endless time to think. I replayed every move. First I blamed Julian. Then myself for ever getting involved with him. Instead of letting him go, I made him suffer for every failure. Hoping he'd rise to my level. I fell for him, yet he always compared me to her. I wondered if he told them that before he died. But none of that was what doomed me.

So many warned me. Told me I was chasing what wasn't mine. Even my own mother. I was hellbent on taking what I felt I deserved. Maybe this is my punishment.

"I tried to steal her life." I keep my eyes on the fire. "Levi knew nothing about that. He punished me for nearly exposing our kind to humans. He's been cleaning up my mess for years."

"I could go to her. Explain everything. Tell her what happened."

"And if she doesn't believe you? She'll kill you. Then who tends your chickens?"

She rolls her grey eyes. "She doesn't know me. She might listen. Be reasonable."

"What does that achieve? We won't be Lycans again. We're stuck like this forever."

She moves closer to me. "At least your conscience would be clear."

"How are you so hopeful?" I ask. She always found light in the dark.

Her warm hand cups my cheek. "I'm free. You can be too. We could be together."

We talk late into the night. I tell her everything. Answer every painful question. Evelyn pours wine and offers me a glass. I refuse. Something I never would have done before Levi. Now I can't stand the taste of alcohol.

Evelyn keeps reminding me. Everything is different now. I've lost my Lycan.

It's nearly seven in the morning.

I'm exhausted. My head throbs. I feel more exposed than when guards watched me shower. Evelyn hugged me multiple times. I cried more than I wanted.

I wouldn't have done that before. I would have hidden. Swallowed the tears.

"I need to reach her before Levi does." She says softly.

"You said he'd search places he thinks I'd hide. He could already be there. Whispering lies to Athena. He could capture you."

"She needs to know about him, Seraphina. She is his Alpha."

"You can't go alone. I've been there. They have guards. Let me come. I can show you the way."

"You're still weak. Malnourished. I can't risk you collapsing."

"I won't let you go alone."
###Chapter 0344
Brianna

I was shot.
The bastard actually shot me.
Right in the stomach.

My thoughts are hazy, clouded by pain and confusion.
But the memory of the gunshot rings clear and sharp.
“She’s waking up.” Sebastian’s voice cuts through the fog, thick with relief.

Warm fingers close around my wrist.
Another hand presses gently against my neck.
“Pulse is strong.”

I force one eye open, squinting against the light.
Theodore smiles down at me.
“I was shot,” I mumble, my voice rough.

Silence answers me.
My hands drift to my stomach.
Bandages wrap tightly around my torso.
I begin picking at the edges.
I need to see the damage.
I need to know.

I was pregnant.

“Brianna, stop.” Sebastian’s hands catch mine, pulling them away.
A whimper escapes me.
“But I’m pregnant!”

This wasn’t how I planned to tell him.
It was supposed to be a surprise.
I wanted to share the news tonight, during the pack run.

The silence that follows is crushing.
It only takes me a moment to understand.
I was shot in the stomach.
The extensive bandages tell a story of severe injury.
Which means one thing.
I lost our pup.

“Brianna…” Theodore begins softly.

“No. I already know. I was just…” I turn my head toward Sebastian. “I’m sorry.”
I fight to hold myself together, but my chest is tight.
My lungs burn with a scream I can’t release.

I see it on his face.
There’s more.

Sebastian squeezes my hand. “The damage was too severe, Brianna. It, um… it…”
I’ve never seen him struggle for words like this.
The news is worse than just losing the pup.

“It’s like Isabella’s leg,” I whisper, saying what he cannot. “It won’t heal.”
Not only did I lose the pup.
I lost any chance of having more.
“Brianna, I’m sor—”

“It’s fine.” My body trembles.
It isn’t fine.
But I have to focus on something else. “Is Luc dead?” He’s the one who shot me.

“No.” Sebastian’s reply is calm.
I expected him or Zachary to have torn Luc apart for what he did to me.

“Why the hell not? He did this! He’s the reason I lost the pup! He knew I was pregnant, and he shot me!”

“Brianna, it wasn’t him!” Sebastian stops me.

“What are you talking about? He had the gun.”

“A Lycan was fighting him for it,” Theodore explains. “The guy was aiming for Athena. Luc tried to wrestle it away. It went off and hit you. Athena killed the guy.”

I should feel better.
The idiot who shot me is dead.
But I don’t.
I just feel hollow and broken.
How could something so small leave me feeling so empty?

“You should go on the pack run,” I mutter to Sebastian. “I’ll be okay here. I’ll just…” I glance around the room. “I guess I’ll rest.”

“Brianna, the pack run was two nights ago. The damage… your body is healing slowly.”

“Oh.”

“There’s something else I need to tell you.”

How much worse can it get?

Sebastian runs a hand through his blonde hair. “Isabella’s dead.”

I stare at him, my mouth agape.
Sebastian and Theodore explain everything.
I still don’t fully understand.
It feels like a dream, or a drug-induced hallucination.
What they’re telling me doesn’t seem real.
A soul taking over another soul.

“How’s Zachary?” This could push him back into his Rogue habits.
He told me Isabella was his light, his anchor.
With her gone, it’s only a matter of time.

“That’s what everyone is worried about,” Theodore mutters.

“Please tell me he hasn’t gone Rogue?!”

“That’s just it. He hasn’t. He’s quiet, but he’s handling his Beta duties. He isn’t acting like someone who lost a mate. Luc is watching him constantly.”

“That will only make things worse.”

I sigh, shifting in the bed.
It would be so much easier if they were on the same side.
Instead of making me turn my head back and forth.
###Chapter 0345

"He's carrying a gun now." Sebastian informs me.

"What?" I was sure I heard him wrong.

"Don't worry about what's happening outside. We're handling it. You just need to rest." Sebastian watches me, waiting for my agreement.

"I need to talk to him."

"Brianna, you need to rest."

"Please. I just... I understand him better than anyone."

"I'll get him." Theodore gives me a small smile and rushes from the room.

"We need to discuss this, Brianna. I feel your pain. I feel the ache in your heart."

I shake my head at him, tears already clouding my vision. I can't talk about it. Not yet.

"I knew."

"Huh?"

"I knew. I searched your house after the fire. I saw the tests."

I lower my gaze. "It was supposed to be a surprise. I was nervous, after what happened to the boys. I knew you wanted it. And now... Now I can never give you a pup."

It's strange. Only now do I realize how much I wanted it. I always knew I wanted to be a mother. To have my own little family. I never saw it happening. Not until I saw those two lines.

"I'm sorry." I whisper again.

He grabs both my hands. "Stop apologizing. This wasn't your fault. You didn't know this would happen. No one could have predicted it. This is not on you."

It still felt like my fault.

I force a smile as Zachary enters.

"I'll give you two a minute." Sebastian mutters. He gives me a pointed look. "Stay in bed."

"I was coming to see you." Zachary speaks softly. He peers through the window blinds. "Are you okay?" I ask.

"I should be asking you that. I guess they told you."

I nod, though he isn't looking at me. "I don't understand. I thought Julian was dead."

"It doesn't matter. They're both dead now."

"She was your mate."

"Was! She gave up, Brianna. I didn't see it. I couldn't see it. Or maybe I didn't want to. But she gave up. I wasn't even worth holding onto. She loved him more than anything. Twins in life. Twins in death."

"So you're okay?" I ask with a head tilt.

"Yes."

I stare at him. "I don't believe you."

He moves to the chair beside my bed. "Everyone is watching me. Waiting for me to break. Luc has his beady little eyes on me every chance he gets. He's probably pissed I'm in here where he can't see me. I don't need you watching me too, Brianna. Focus on your own health."

"I've seen people lose their mates. This isn't how they react."

"Maybe. Maybe not. Or maybe I've been preparing to lose her since the day we met." He groans. "I knew a time would come where I'd lose her or she'd lose me. Though I never imagined losing her to her own damn brother."

I wanted to gag. I really hoped he didn't mean what I thought.

"Like I said. Twins in life. Twins in death."

I've seen Zachary do many things. Including the stuff he did as a Rogue. But this left me the most unsettled. He was too calm. Too understanding. Or maybe he was right. He was too used to death.

"I swear Brianna, you don't need to worry about me."

I dip my head in acknowledgement. His comment only made me more uneasy.

"Oh, I'm taking the oath tomorrow evening. Being Beta is hard without being able to link Alexander. With this many Lycans, we need someone who can link both."

"Right." Our conversation felt so strange. Sebastian said he was acting odd. But he wasn't. He was acting like his usual self. And that was what was odd. Maybe he was having some kind of delayed reaction?
###Chapter 0346

"Daddy?" Lottie dropped her spoon into her cereal bowl. She stared at me with wide, bright green eyes. Her bottom lip stuck out in a pout.

"You need to finish your breakfast. Today is a big day for you."

She scrunched up her nose. "I can't eat."

"Why not?"

"You're sad." She muttered the words with a tiny frown. "If I go to school, I can't watch over you."

"Is that so?"

"Uh huh!"

"Well, I have a very busy day planned. You really don't need to worry about me. I'm taking my oath later to officially join Obsidian Howl. It's also very important that you start school."

"Why?"

"Because you are an incredibly smart little girl. Besides, the school is right here within the pack grounds. I won't be far away at all. You'll also get to spend time with other children your age."

"If I'm so smart, I don't need school. Auntie Athena didn't go, and she's an Alpha!" She pouted fiercely and hugged her arms around herself.

I sighed. Lottie had a rebuttal for everything lately.

"But I really wish I had gotten to go to school." Athena's voice carried into the kitchen. She entered with her boys toddling alongside her. "Learning to read and write as an adult isn't nearly as fun as you might think."

Lottie hiked her small shoulders up around her ears. "Fine. I'll go!"

We had been preparing for this moment over the past week. Many Lycans had brought young children with them, pulling them from their previous schools. They were concerned about their education falling behind. Alpha Alexander had agreed to establish a small schoolhouse. I suspected Lottie's nerves were finally catching up to her.

She turned her serious gaze to Athena. "Will you please look after Daddy? He's very sad."

Athena's blue eyes flicked in my direction as she settled Logan into his high chair. "Of course I will."

I really wished Lottie would stop informing everyone of my supposed sadness. Isabella was dead. That chapter was closed.

"Do you think my other Daddy will come walk me to school?"

"I can ask him, but you need to finish your breakfast first. I know you, Lottie. You'll be hungry again in ten minutes."

She gave me a guilty little smile and began shoveling cereal into her mouth.

Lottie held my hand in a death grip as we walked across the pack grounds toward the converted school building. She was far more jittery than usual. Her eyes darted everywhere. It was probably because Luc hadn't shown up like he said he would.

She wasn't the only hesitant child. Other kids were protesting too. Caleb had his youngest boy trapped under one arm, carrying him toward the school. The look on his face suggested a rough morning of convincing.

"He's scared." Lottie whispered to me.

"He hasn't been here very long. Remember how scared you were when you first arrived? Maybe he just needs a friend." I offered gently.

"Like Auntie Brianna is your friend?"

"Exactly like that."

She nodded, straightening out her pink dress with determination. Confidently, she strode away from me. She stopped directly in front of Caleb. "My name is Charlotte. I can be your friend." She offered her small hand to the boy. Caleb just stood there, staring down at her as if she carried some contagion.

I hadn't considered that the Lycans might object to a Hunter's daughter attending their school.

"She is just a child!" I snarled, closing the distance between us.

"I know that." Caleb muttered lowly. "But is this truly wise? The classroom will be full of young Lycans."

"I believe you're worried about the wrong person entirely."

Lottie's small hand slid back into mine. "It's okay, Daddy. I can just go home."

I forced a reassuring smile for her. "No. You have every right to be here, just like everyone else." I turned my hardened gaze back to Caleb. "Doesn't she?!"

"Of course she does." He muttered, but the words rang completely hollow. If I could hear the lie, she undoubtedly could too.

I made sure she was settled at a small desk before I left, though the disapproving looks from other parents did not escape my notice. I was starting to think it was a good thing Luc hadn't come. He would have shot every single person in that room. Perhaps he had known that.

Kissing Lottie on the cheek, I promised to pick her up later. I then made my way over to the teacher.

"Any problems whatsoever, you call me immediately." I slid my number across the table to her.

The sooner I took that damned oath, the better.

"Wait!" Caleb called out as I strode back toward the main house.

"What is it now?" I snapped without stopping.

"I'm worried about my boys."

"You're their father. You should be." I retorted and kept walking.

"You know that's not what I'm talking about! And you are one of her parents in that... unusual arrangement you have."

I stopped and glared at him. "She is a little girl who has likely seen more horror than all the other children in that room combined. More importantly, she just wants to learn. Why is that a problem for you?"

"Zachary, you know exactly what I mean. She's a Hunter of our kind. She is a threat."
###Chapter 0347

“I already told you, you’re focusing on the wrong person!”

“So if something happens to her, what then? Her father comes after us? You come after us?”

“Exactly. I’ll say this once. If you or any other Lycan tries anything foolish, it won't just be me or Luc you have to answer to. Lottie is part of Athena’s family. How do you think Athena will react after she welcomed you into her home?”

“I support our Alpha completely, but I don’t want that Hunter’s child around my kids.”

“Why? Worried they’ll turn out like Seraphina?” I walk off before he can respond.

Athena stands at the front door, hands on her hips. “Now you’re threatening other Lycans?”

“It wasn’t a threat. But I’m glad they can mind-link you when necessary.”

She sighs and sits on the bottom step. “Zachary. I’m sorry, alright? I had to intervene. I couldn’t let you do it.”

“Stop apologizing, Athena. I keep telling you I understand. You don’t need to keep saying sorry.”

“But—”

“I don’t blame you, Athena. Not for anything. I blame her. She took the easy way out. She didn’t even fight for what was hers. And honestly, I have bigger things to worry about.”

“If you need to talk, I’m—”

“I don’t.”

She exhales sharply. “Are you going to tell me what happened with Caleb?”

“I’m sure he’s already told you.”

She rolls her eyes. “I like to hear both sides.”

I sit beside her on the stairs. “I won’t let anything happen to Lottie.”

“I know. But we all have to make this work. We have the original Wolves, Lycans—both bitten and pure-bloods—and several Hunters. Though I’m not sure I’d put Theodore in that category.” She smiles faintly. “I’ll talk to Caleb.”

“He’s a jerk, Athena. Don’t fall for his nonsense.”

“It’s my choice.”

I nod. “Where’s Alexander?”

“Down at the gate. Apparently, there’s another one.”

“And you didn’t go?”

“I waited for you. Isabella took the twins. I was about to head down, but whoever’s at the gate isn’t urgent. You understand that, right? You’re not alone here. Just because she’s gone doesn’t mean you’re not family.”

“Good. Because you’re stuck with me.”

We walk down to the gates together. A woman stands on the other side, arms crossed defensively. She’s human. How did a human get all the way out here?

Her eyes are an unusual shade of grey. “You don’t believe me, do you?” she mutters to Alexander.

“Why would a human be here?” Athena whispers.

“Only one way to find out.”

The woman’s strange grey eyes shift to Athena as we approach. Her lips part slightly. “Shit!”

I immediately pull Athena behind me. Her life is far more valuable than mine. I don’t need another fool trying to harm her.

“How did you find this place?” Alexander demands.

“I was shown.”

“By who?”

“Someone like me.”

“Another human?” I ask.

“I’m not human. Not anymore, at least. It’s complicated. I was a Lycan. Then my abilities were taken.”

“You weren’t bound. If you were bound, you’d still carry a scent. But you only smell human,” Alexander tells her.

“I don’t know what he did to us. I just know I was never the same after.”

“Bullshit!” Alexander snaps.

“What if I told you the same thing happened to Seraphina?” the woman says.

“What are you talking about?” Athena steps around me.

“Seraphina isn’t a Lycan anymore.”

“Impossible.”

“She’s the one who showed me where your pack is. I came to warn you.”

“Really? What is Seraphina threatening me with now?” Athena demands.

“It’s not Seraphina. She didn’t want me to come, but we had no choice. The man who did this to me and others is probably on his way here looking for her. She told him she was your half-sister.” The woman shakes her head at Athena.

“I’m not afraid of one man!” Athena retorts. “Whatever happened to Seraphina is exactly what she deserved.”

The woman sighs. “She did a lot of terrible things, I know. But instead of facing consequences, she had everything stripped from her. That’s what he does.”

Athena scoffs.

“What’s your name?” Alexander asks.

“Evelyn Reed. But everyone calls me Evie or Eve.” She shakes her head. “This man is dangerous.”

“Is this a trick?” Athena whispers to me.

“She seems to know a lot.”

“She isn’t lying.” Luc strolls up beside us. His hazel eyes fix on the woman. “But you’re not telling us everything either, are you, Evelyn?”
###Chapter 0348
Lucas Adler

Evelyn's grey eyes fixate on me. "You don't know anything about me!"

"I see everything I need to see."

"What's that supposed to mean?" She glances toward Athena. "Do you have Witches here too?"

I let out a low chuckle. Why did they always assume that? "You can't scent me, can you?"

"I told you, this is what he does. He takes everything. I lost everything because of him. Seraphina has lost everything because of him. I know she did terrible things. She confessed everything to me. But this man will hunt her. He will come here."

"He can go to hell because he won't find her here!" Alexander snaps.

"I know that. You know that. But he doesn't." Evelyn frowns.

"It's interesting that you haven't mentioned a name." Zachary mutters, still partially shielding Athena.

"His name is Levi, if that's even his real name." Evelyn runs her fingers through her long blonde hair. "He doesn't just hurt Lycans. He hurts Wolves too. He strips our abilities. Do you know what that feels like? To not be able to smell or hear like I used to? To get breathless from simple exertion? To lose the ability to heal? It destroys your soul."

I snort.

"It's not funny!"

"Being stripped doesn't destroy your soul."

She glares at me. "Like you would know anything about it."

I watch Athena, but she remains silent. If anyone here understands, it would be her.

"Why did he do that to you?" I press.

"I don't know."

"Yes, you do. You're withholding information."

She narrows her eyes and clenches her jaw. I was hitting nerves she didn't want touched.

"Stop talking like you know everything."

"Never claimed I know everything. But I can tell when someone isn't sharing the full story."

Her cheeks flush with irritation. "Seraphina was right. You people only care about yourselves."

"Interesting," Athena murmurs. "I could say the same about Seraphina. Be careful she doesn't betray you. That's something she enjoys doing. Just ask her mother."

Evelyn sighs. "She's changed. What he did to us... it makes you question everything. All the bad. All the good. All the mistakes. Maybe on some level Levi was right. Maybe it's the punishment we deserved."

She's actually telling the truth about that.

"Almost six years ago, he convinced me he was my mate." She shakes her head. "I had killed a human and someone witnessed it. I bumped into him and caught this divine scent. It's ironic now—I can't even remember what that scent was. He played this game of getting to know me. Made me fall for him in ways I never imagined. He led me away. I remember being struck on the head. Something injected into my neck. Nothing was ever the same again. I'm not the first. I definitely won't be the last."

"So he lures women away?" Alexander asks.

"No. There were men kept there too. The point is, he punishes those he thinks deserve it."

Athena laughs.

"You think that's funny?!" Evelyn mutters in disgust. "You're the Lycan Alpha. You should be protecting us."

"How much has Seraphina told you?" Athena asks.

"Everything."

"Did she tell you she wanted to be Alpha? That she refused to accept the gene didn't pass to her because it came from my mother's side? Did she tell you she destroyed her mate to the point he lost his mind? Did she tell you her mother is here in my pack along with her brothers and baby sister? Did she tell you she knows exactly how to manipulate people to get what she wants? Should I continue?"

"She's not like that anymore." Evelyn cuts her off.

"She killed a pregnant Wolf and stole her toddler. Sold the child to humans." Zachary growls, speaking of my little girl.

Evelyn lowers her eyes. "She didn't tell me all of that. But that doesn't mean she hasn't changed."

"Where is she?" Athena demands.

"She's not here. She said you would kill her."

"Smart move." I muse.

Athena rolls her eyes at me. "What do you want from us?"

"Nothing."

"You came here to tell us all this, but you want nothing?"

She shakes her head again. "I thought I did. But I prefer my new life. Levi goes to places he knows we would have sought refuge in the past. That's what he does. He tortures people for information. He will look for Seraphina. He will come here, just like I said. He wants what he thinks belongs to him."

"And you people think I have a God complex." I muse.

"It isn't funny." Evelyn snaps at me and turns back to Athena. "I don't care if you think Seraphina and I deserved it. We're better off on our own. But what do you think he's going to do when he comes here? He doesn't like anyone he thinks is better than him. You have two Alphas in one place."

"He's one man." Athena mutters.

She looks Athena dead in the eye. "There's always someone worse." Evelyn turns away and strides down the driveway.

"Do you believe her?" Alexander asks me.

"She believes what she's saying. Her soul didn't falter once like it would if she were lying."

"How could someone strip abilities that are way beyond binding someone?" Zachary asks. "Because surely if it could be done, Dominic would have done that to Athena."
###Chapter 0349

"That arrogant prick who thinks he's above everyone else worries me more." Alexander mutters under his breath.

I shrug casually. "Don't waste your energy. We've got plenty of protection here already."

Athena's eyes narrow with suspicion. "What if he's already among us? Lycans have been arriving in groups for days. Some claim they met on the journey here. What if that's exactly what he did?"

"Nobody by the name of Levi Bennett is on the list." Zachary states firmly, holding his checklist.

"You heard her earlier - 'if that was even his real name'." Athena scowls in frustration.

"Relax. Every bastard reveals themselves eventually." I turn to leave but Zachary blocks my path.

"Where were you this morning?"

"Do I really need to explain myself?"

"Charlotte was searching for you."

"I was observing."

"She didn't need observation. She needed your presence."

"I saw you, Zachary. You wanted to pound Caleb into the ground. How do you think I would've reacted? You already know the answer. Now excuse me, I have matters to attend to."

I stride across the grounds, vanishing behind Brianna's charred home and slipping into the forest.

Soon I hear Hannah speaking with someone.

"I don't know. It's always been this way." Her voice carries a heavy sigh, as if she's repeated this many times.

"I don't believe it. Lycans always have their wolves. You don't just wake up without one." A male voice challenges.

"I didn't! I told you, this is how it's always been. Not that it's any of your concern."

I move silently through the trees.

"Sorry." The guy backtracks. "I'm just curious. Didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. Did you hear our Alpha didn't have her Lycan most of her life?"

"I did, but that's her business. She's still our Alpha. Keep asking and people will think you have issues with her leadership."

"You're right. Sorry. I thought... you seem different. Maybe you could help me understand why we're here, what she wants from us."

I roll my eyes and deliberately make noise approaching them.

"Someone's coming." The guy warns.

"I know. I'm neither stupid nor deaf." Hannah retorts sharply.

She has this habit of sarcastic comebacks while missing what's happening around her. He was clearly fishing for information.

"Luc." she murmurs when she sees me, lowering her chestnut eyes.

"We weren't doing anything." The guy claims quickly.

"Right. Just following a woman into the forest alone." His eyes are strange - green with blue speckles. "I didn't catch your name." I remember his arrival yesterday. He was hard to read. Not necessarily untrustworthy, but not open either. Charlotte had given him one of her stickers, and I trust my daughter's judgment. That doesn't mean I won't watch him.

"I was just taking a walk." Hannah explains.

"And I was ensuring her safety." The guy flashes perfect white teeth. "Lots happening around here. Can't be too careful." He looks me over. He knows exactly who I am. And he's implying Hannah needs protection from me.

"Your name?"

"Owen. Owen Carter."

"Right."

Hannah smiles nervously. "Owen was just leaving."

"Are you certain? I mean..." He gestures toward me.

"I've been here awhile, Owen. If he wanted to shoot me, he would've done it already."

Owen nods, weighing his options.

"I suggest you go." I make the choice for him.

He glances back at Hannah. "You're sure?"

"I'm fine. Like I said, Luc won't hurt me."

He nods and retreats. Hannah starts to speak but I cover her mouth, listening to his fading footsteps.

After several minutes, she pulls my hand away. "What was that for?"

"I don't trust him."

"Couldn't tell." She says sarcastically.

"Was this for my benefit, Hannah? Having someone follow you so I'd come running?"

"No. How did you even know I was here?" She rises on her toes and kisses my cheek.

"I know many things. If you want him to stay alive, don't let him touch you."

"You can't keep me hidden forever, Luc."

She begins unbuttoning her shirt, leaning against a tree. My fingers trace her stomach, my tanned skin contrasting sharply with her paleness. She shudders under my touch, her arousal quickly filling the air.

It was wrong, but I found myself increasingly unable to refuse her, especially when she tasted so perfect.

Her body trembles as my tongue circles her navel, her hands tangling in my dark curls. I'm just loosening her jeans when the guy calls out.

"Hey Hannah, I forgot to ask..."
###Chapter 0350
Lucas Adler

I stand up just before his face reappears.
Hannah stays behind me, quickly buttoning her shirt.
The guy stares directly at me.
I’m not an idiot—I know he can smell her arousal all over the air.
But he doesn’t speak.
He just turns and walks away, fists clenched tightly at his sides.

My hand instinctively reaches for my gun.
Hannah stops me.
“Don’t,” she says quietly. “It’ll draw more attention. I’ll talk to him myself.”
I grab her wrist as she tries to move past me.
“You’re staying away from him.”
“You don’t get to decide that for me, Luc.” She pulls her hand free and rushes after him.
I hear her calling his name—Ash, Owen Carter—until her voice fades into the distance.

Damn it.

If that idiot doesn’t keep his mouth shut, they’ll all think I’ve gone soft.
The Lycans will believe they have leverage over me.
I’ll become a laughingstock among other Hunters.
I need to speak with Athena or Brianna. They’re the only ones who know the truth.

I make my way out of the forest.
There’s no sign of Hannah or that bastard anywhere.
I can’t even catch her scent.
Maybe she took a different path when I wasn’t paying attention.

The hospital is closest.
I head there, hoping Brianna is alone.

Luckily, she is.
She quickly wipes her tears when she sees me and forces a smile.
“Should I get Theodore or Sebastian for you?”
“No,” I say. “It’s fine.”
“Come in, then.” She gestures me inside.

“I want to apologize,” I murmur.
Brianna didn’t deserve any of this.
She’s different from the other Lycans.
I knew she’d gone Rogue, but it wasn’t the same.
Her soul is fractured, much like Athena’s.
I just never told anyone.
And now there’s another crack working its way through her spirit.
I feel responsible.

I may not have pulled the trigger, but it was my weapon that caused the damage.

“You didn’t shoot me,” she says softly. “Zachary told me. Though for a second, I really thought it was you.”
I nod.

“But that’s not why you’re here, is it?”
I run a hand over my stubble and press my lips together.
I can still taste Hannah.
“I’m not the kind of person who asks for help. Or advice.” The words feel foreign. Almost shameful. “But you and Athena are the only Lycans I can stand.”

“Ah,” she says. “This is about Hannah.”
“How did you know?”
“It was either that or something to do with Charlotte and Zachary’s bond.” She shifts on the bed, wincing in pain.

“Hannah and I have been meeting up.” I leave it there and wait.

She smiles, then clutches her stomach with a grimace. “I wish you wouldn’t make me laugh. It hurts.”
“It wasn’t meant to be funny,” I grumble.

“Okay, so you’re meeting up. And?”
“She’s a Lycan.”
“Yeah, we established that already,” she mutters sarcastically.

“This was a mistake.” I stand to leave.
“Don’t go. Please. This takes my mind off… other things.” Her sigh is heavy with the same sadness I felt when I entered.

I stare at her for a moment before dropping back into the chair.
“So?” she prompts.

“I can’t get her out of my head. But I also can’t get past what she is. Or the problems it’ll cause.”
“I’m a Lycan,” she points out.
“I don’t want to fuck you,” I snap.
She rolls her eyes. A far cry from how she looked at me that night she showed up at my place.
If I remember right, her mate had to keep reminding her he existed too.

“Fair enough,” she says, frowning. “But you’re a Hunter of Rogues, right?”
“Doesn’t matter. If they’re a problem, I deal with it. You’ve seen that.”
“Is Hannah a problem?” She puffs out her cheeks as I shake my head.
“Then why not just claim her? She’s your mate. And from the sound of it, she’s not being forced. Yes, she’s a Lycan—but she can’t shift. What are the odds she goes Rogue?”

“What if I kill her?”
“What if you don’t? Look, Sebastian wasn’t my biggest fan either. When he marked me, it was an accident. He struggled with what I am, just like you’re struggling with Hannah. But he couldn’t stay away. In the end, you’re the only one who needs to care who your mate is. Screw everyone else.”
###Chapter 0351

“A Lycan might be aware of us now.”

“And you didn’t eliminate him?” Her tone is sharp with disbelief.

“Hannah refused. She believes she can persuade him to stay silent.”

“Then act first. I already know. Athena knows. Alexander likely knows too—Athena tells him everything, or he reads her mind, just like Sebastian reads mine. Neither has spoken up because they’re both mated to someone unexpected. And from what I understand about Hannah, she doesn’t judge what you do. You did kill the man who marked her and held her captive.”

I nod, turning her words over in my mind.

“Did you know back then?” she asks. “When I brought her to the house, did you know she was your mate?”

“Yes.”

“And you waited all this time?”

“Yes.”

“Because she’s a Lycan?”

“Yes. And because it would mean replacing my deceased mate.”

“So you believe that’s it? That you’re never allowed to be loved again?”

“It’s more complicated than that.”

“It really isn’t,” she mutters.

“It’s not simple.”

She laughs softly, then curls in as a wave of pain hits. “I told you not to make me laugh!”

“I wasn’t trying to.”

“You think this is complicated?! This is the easiest problem you could have. At least she isn’t human. Can you imagine explaining everything to a human?”

Maybe she was the right person to talk to. Athena would have left me with more questions than answers. Or I would’ve gotten lost watching her soul.

“There’s only so much I can say,” Brianna smiles weakly. “Ultimately, you have to make the decision, not me. But if you can’t handle it, let her go. It isn’t fair—not after everything she’s been through.”

“That’s part of the problem.”

She raises an eyebrow.

“I can’t let her go either.”

“Or maybe you don’t truly want to,” she shrugs.

“Annoyingly, I think you’re right.”

“I usually am.” She gives me a knowing look.

I glance around. The hospital is eerily quiet. No one else is here. “Where is everyone?”

“Sebastian went with Theodore to get supplies.”

“He left you alone.”

She nods, her smile fading. “I told him to. Every time I look at him, I want to cry.”

“He doesn’t blame—”

“I know he doesn’t. It’s like your situation—it’s complicated. I know he feels what I’m feeling, and somehow that makes it worse, when it should help. Does that make sense?”

“If I couldn’t see your soul, I’d say no. But there’s a hole in you where something was once whole. A hole Sebastian doesn’t have. He feels the loss too, just differently. Don’t shut him out. He lost it too.”

“At least you didn’t tell me I’d get over it.”

I frown. “Who would say something like that?”

“When I was human, my father said it to my mother right after he beat her brutally. She lost a baby because of what he did.”

“Then it’s a good thing you killed him.”

She nods, her gaze drifting past me. I catch Sebastian’s scent approaching and prepare to leave.

“Thanks for coming,” she says softly.

“I’ll see you later. I need to find my mate.”

I head back into the forest where I left Hannah. Her jasmine scent still lingers in the air. I follow it to the ruins of Brianna’s burned house.

But strangely, her scent shifts direction, heading south deeper into the woods. Another scent accompanies hers—a Lycan’s. The same arrogant one who was questioning her.

I track the scents and footprints deeper and deeper until they abruptly stop. Her scent vanishes completely.

“HANNAH!”

No answer. One of Alexander’s wolves appears. “Is there a problem?”

“How far south am I?”

“Almost at the border.”

“Has anyone passed through here?”

“I would’ve seen them. Is someone missing?”

“Still determining.”

I crouch, tracing the last set of tracks. My eyes scan the trees above. Nothing. Wolves can’t scent Lycans in Lycan form, but I can. Someone shifted here.

That bastard took Hannah!
###Chapter 0352
Athena

"Three individuals named Ash are present, but none match the name Ash Thomas." Zachary informs me, tossing the clipboard onto the desk. He turns to Luc. "Whoever provided that name deceived you!"

"Alternatively, the name he gave both you and Athena was false." Luc counters. "That might be his actual identity."

I scan the highlighted names on the clipboard, searching for connections, while ignoring Zachary and Luc's argument. They behaved more childishly than actual children.

Identifying links to each name, I summon them and demand their immediate presence in the office. Perhaps one had provided a false surname out of fear.

Three men arrive within minutes. Luc shakes his head. "None of them are him."

The men exchange confused glances, uncertain why they were summoned.

"Do any of you know Ash Thomas?" I ask.

Two shake their heads and deny it. The third nods. "He arrived yesterday. He asks excessive questions."

"Regarding what?" Luc demands.

"Everything. I assumed it was because he's new here."

'Seraphina claimed that Levi would come here. What if she was correct? What if he's already here under an alias?'

'Luc would recognize him.' I murmur. 'That man couldn't possibly slip past us. Could he?'

'It aligns with what that woman said. That this man searches places where he believes his prisoners might hide. All these questions suggest he's tactically searching for someone.'

'If he sought Blair, why take Hannah? What if this is another scheme orchestrated by Seraphina?' I challenge.

She remains silent, aware, as I was, that too many uncertainties clouded the situation.

"What does he look like?" I ask Luc. Many newcomers had arrived recently; I couldn't recall every name, but faces remained distinct. He provides a description. The moment he mentions green eyes with blue flecks, I recognize who he refers to.

"You spared him." I frown. The man he described had been in the office with Charlotte and me. Charlotte had stopped drawing the instant he entered, spending the entire time staring silently as I questioned him. After he left, she refused to share what she saw or felt, requesting to leave shortly after.

Luc frowns. "He wore one of my daughter's stickers. I distrusted him—his soul was highly questionable—but I had to trust my daughter's judgment."

Zachary shakes his head, crossing his arms. "She's seven years old, Luc. Seven. She shouldn't be involved in this. Children err."

"She didn't provide him one." I state.

"What?" Luc mutters.

"She didn't give him a sticker." I confirm. "He must have seen another wearing one and taken it, knowing it would protect him."

"Fool!" Zachary mutters at Luc. "Among all those you've killed for appearing suspicious, you spare this one. And within twenty-four hours of his arrival, he kidnaps a Lycan."

"Why Hannah, though? She can't even shift. Why bother taking her?" I ask.

Luc looks away. "He saw us together."

If concern for Hannah didn't dominate my thoughts, I'd feel happiness for Luc. Finally, he acknowledged being mated to her.

"You were with a Lycan?" Zachary asks, a smirk forming. His previous anger vanishes.

"Yes, and keep your opinions to yourself!" Luc snaps, his hand moving to his belt's gun.

"So Hannah is..." Zachary leans against the wall, grinning widely as he awaits an answer. "None of your concern!"

"You stormed in here, demanding we find her. As Beta, it becomes my concern. I repeat: why were you with Hannah?" Zachary taunts. He already knew the answer.

"I lack time for this!" I snap, rising from my seat. "I need answers regarding this situation and this man's identity."

"Can't you mind-link him?" Zachary asks.

"No link exists to anyone named Levi or Ash Thomas. The alternative is ordering all Lycans here so you can identify him."

"No." Luc mutters. "I must locate Evelyn. She implied she knows precisely where this Levi takes them."

"I'm accompanying you." Zachary snarls.

"No, Zachary. You remain here." I tell him. "I will go with Luc."
###Chapter 0353

Two pairs of eyes lock onto me. "You have no idea what's out there or what could be waiting." Zachary argues. "And I'm certain Alexander won't approve."

"I can take care of myself. I'm the Lycan Alpha. Hannah is a Lycan. She falls under my protection."

Alexander clearly dislikes the idea of me going. His crimson gaze burns into me, forehead creased with disapproval. Anyone would think I'd suggested something utterly outrageous.

"Luc is coming with me. We'll return before tonight's ceremony." I attempt to reason with him.

"You can't guarantee that. You don't know what you're walking into. This could easily be a trap."

"You never know what you're walking into either. You didn't expect to find me or all the complications that came with it."

"That was different."

"Because I'm a woman?" I scoff, feeling Nyx stir with interest.

"No. Because I have extensive experience navigating unknown situations. You never leave pack territory, Athena. While that usually means I know you're safe, it also means I'm always minutes away. I won't be if you go out there without me. And I'm not comfortable with that."

'He's overreacting.' Nyx murmurs.

'He's allowed to. He said it himself—he won't be with me.'

I sigh and bite my lower lip. "If one of your Wolves went missing, what would you do?"

"You already know the answer."

"Then I have to do this too." I sense he understands how important this is to me. Perhaps that's why he's not outright forbidding it, but making his concerns perfectly clear.

"Keep your eyes on her at all times." Alexander snaps at Luc. I'd almost forgotten he was in the office with us.

"My job has always been to protect her." He's busy checking his gun's ammunition. "I don't break my agreements, Alexander. You should know that—you're a man who values contracts."

"If anything happens to her—"

"I know." Luc shrugs. "But if it comes to that, you'll have to find me first."

Alexander and Zachary accompany Luc and me to the gates. Alexander pulls me against his broad chest. "Don't block me at any point."

'I won't.' Nyx mutters, and I echo her words.

Alexander's lips crush against mine. He kisses me with desperate intensity, as if trying to memorize the feel of me. When he pulls back, my lips feel swollen and tender under his crimson gaze. "I'm coming back." I whisper.

"I expect you to."

"Let's move!" Luc mutters. He slides into the driver's seat of the waiting car. I take the passenger seat and glance back at my mate. He absolutely hates this.

"You good?" Luc asks as he starts the engine.

I nod, keeping my thoughts private.

He says nothing more but periodically stops the car to examine the ground. Going on foot would probably be more efficient.

"You haven't asked." He raises an eyebrow as he gets back in.

"Asked what?"

"Why we didn't just walk?"

"You claim you can't read minds, yet you have this annoying habit of knowing exactly what people are thinking."

He laughs. "You haven't spoken since we left, but I see your expression every time I stop and exit the vehicle. You know walking would be just as effective for tracking, if not more so. Yet you remain silent. It's the obvious thing you'd be thinking about."

'He's so irritating.' Nyx mutters with a yawn. She's bored and craving action.

"Is that how you figure things out?" I ask.

He shrugs. "Nine times out of ten. So are you going to ask me?"

"I'm guessing it has something to do with me?"

He claps his hands and restarts the car. "Alexander's idea. He thought it too risky if any Lycans encountered you in the wild."

"They'll scent me either way."

"That's what I told him. You wouldn't have left the pack at all if I hadn't agreed to the car. Not that a car would slow anyone down if they really wanted to reach you."

"Then why didn't you stop me from coming?"

"I knew it would be pointless."
###Chapter 0354
Lucas Adler

"Why did you really want to come?" I ask her.

Athena keeps her gaze fixed on the road. "Hannah is my responsibility."

"No, she isn't. She's just a woman who came to you hoping to escape a terrible situation. That doesn't mean you owe her anything."

"You might believe that, but I don't." She pauses briefly. "I don't want loyalty based solely on my title. That isn't real loyalty."

"You never cease to surprise me, Athena Harrison."

"Alexander would do anything for his Wolves. I want to do the same for the Lycans. I lived a lie for so long before meeting him. I grew up watching Dominic and Victoria run a pack, and I'll never be like them. Alexander has taught me a great deal."

"Seems like you're finally finding your footing." I catch her smile from the corner of my eye. She just needed validation that she was making the right choices.

I pull the car over for another check. Athena suddenly grabs my arm. "I recognize this place."

A dim light glows from a nearby house. A dirty Porsche sits in the driveway, and the garden grass reaches my knees. Without that faint light, I would have assumed the house was abandoned.

"This is Seraphina's house," she whispers.

"You've been here before?"

"No. When they held Brianna hostage, this was the house number she gave me. Why would Seraphina return here after what Evelyn told us?" Her knuckles turn white as she grips the door handle. "It's too risky, isn't it?"

"Stay here. I'll go check it out."

"No." She pushes the car door open and rushes toward the house. I quickly follow. Her hand hesitates just before knocking. I watch her sniff the air, confirming we're alone, then she pounds her fist against the door. Screams erupt from inside.

I suppress a laugh. Wolves or Lycans don't usually scream when startled. It's actually hilarious. Though they aren't really Lycans anymore. This should be entertaining.

I hear Evelyn trying to whisper on the other side. "Who could know we're here?"

Seraphina's voice answers, one I haven't heard in years. "No one! No one saw us come in. Do you think he found us?"

"I don't think he's the type to knock!"

Athena glances at me. "I can't believe I'm saying this, but don't kill her. I need answers."

"She murdered my family," I reply coldly. That's the only reason I wanted to find them. Get answers, then end Seraphina for good.

"So this is why you wanted to come? For revenge?"

"You saw what happened to Charlotte. She also killed my mate, my parents, and my unborn child."

"If you kill them, you might never see Hannah again!" Athena knocks again. "It's Athena. I know you're in there."

Seraphina yanks the door open. Her brown eyes land on Athena before shifting to me. She steps back, shaking her head as she pulls her jacket tighter. "You brought the Hunter to my door?"

"You seem frightened," I mutter with a wink.

Evelyn appears, pulling Seraphina back and taking her place in the doorway. "It's in the past. She can't change what she did."

"Her time will come," I reply. Athena elbows me sharply.

"She's lost everything," Evelyn defends.

"How?" Athena demands.

"I told you, I don't know. He drugs us with something, or maybe it happens after he drugs us. You lose track of time."

"Right," Athena mutters. "We have reason to believe he was already in the pack."

"So why are you here?" Evelyn asks, still blocking the entrance. She has no intention of letting us inside.

"One of the female Lycans is missing," Athena informs her.

"If he already has her, you're too late. She won't be a Lycan anymore. That's what he does. He punishes us by stripping our abilities. We don't heal. We can't even smell you. And shifting? Forget it. It's gone. All of it." She grimaces. "We're Human now."

"Prove it," I challenge.

She turns around. "Hand me that knife."

My hand moves to my gun as Seraphina passes her a knife. Evelyn slices it across her palm with a whimper. She clenches her fist until blood drips from the bottom. When she opens her hand to show us, the wound continues bleeding with no signs of healing.

"You can stare all day," Evelyn shrugs. "When it stops bleeding, it'll scab over. Then it'll take weeks to heal properly, and I'll be left with a scar."
###Chapter 0355

Athena handed her a cloth.

Evelyn wrapped it tightly around her injured hand.

“So he keeps you prisoner. Where?”

“Up north. It’s not a place meant for coming or going.”

“Then how did you escape?” Athena pressed.

“I did what was necessary. I got out.”

I watched Athena over Evelyn’s shoulder. “What about you?”

“I… The doors opened. I just walked out.”

“Someone opened them?” Athena muttered. “They released you.”

“Seems that way. But I don’t know who. Or why. You might not believe me, Athena. I don’t deserve your trust. Evelyn insisted we come warn you.”

“Someone let you out,” Athena repeated. She wasn’t hearing anything else Seraphina said.

“Yes. All the locks disengaged.”

Her eyes cut to me. “He did it on purpose.”

“He released me?” Seraphina asked. “Why would he do that?”

“Take it from me—it was a test. He let you go to see where you’d run. You led him straight to Obsidian Howl.”

“He said he wasn’t interested in you,” Seraphina murmured.

“That doesn’t mean he isn’t interested in my pack,” Athena growled.

“You don’t know that,” Evelyn muttered. She still blocked the doorway.

“You escaped,” Athena said. “She was freed.” She turned to me. “I need to link Alexander. I promised updates.” Her gaze flicked to the women and back. “Don’t do anything reckless.”

I nodded. She walked toward the end of the drive.

“You think this is a trap?” Evelyn asked.

“Given your story, it’s obvious. You both lost your Lycans because of his schemes. What he did to you was cruel.”

“You think she deserved it?” Evelyn challenged.

“If it weren’t for her,” I said, pointing toward Athena leaning against the dirty Porsche, “I’d have driven a knife through Seraphina’s heart. Maybe yours, too. But even that wouldn’t be enough for what she did.”

Evelyn’s grey eyes widened with curiosity. Seraphina looked away.

“I know everything,” Evelyn said. “She told me every detail. But I won’t let you kill her.”

“Do you really believe you can stop me? You said it yourself—you have no abilities left.”

“I still know your kind.”

I smirked. For someone powerless, she wasn’t afraid. “Did you ever go Rogue?”

“No.”

“She did.” I pointed at Seraphina.

“I know.”

I raised a brow. “That doesn’t bother you?”

“Do you see a Rogue standing behind me?” she spat.

Athena returned. “Zachary is doing a head count. Making sure everyone else is safe.”

“What do you want from us?” Evelyn asked.

“Where did he take them?” Athena demanded.

“Nowhere near here. But if he sees potential threats, he won’t go far. Just far enough that he thinks you can’t find him.”

“You’ve barely spoken,” Athena glared at Seraphina.

“Anything I say will be wrong.” She muttered and shifted out of sight.

She wasn’t the same as before. Almost sorrowful. But it didn’t make her trustworthy. And I was no closer to finding Hannah.

I turned to Athena. “We should go. We got all we’re getting.”

She looked between me and Evelyn. “Are you sure there’s nothing else?”

“No, I don’t…” She trailed off, frowning. “I already told you he tricks us. Makes us believe he’s our true mate.”

Athena opened her mouth. I shook my head. They didn’t need to know the taken woman was mated to me. If they hid anything, I’d find out.

She turned to leave.

Then spun back suddenly. She forced the door open. Evelyn jumped back, startled.

Seraphina stood at the far end of the room. She was tying a blue scarf over her head. Trying to hide her short, fuzzy hair.

She froze. Maybe she felt death was coming.

“Everyone wants you dead, Seraphina. You betrayed so many. But Evelyn is right. Losing your abilities is a better punishment. Death is too good for you. Too easy,” Athena declared.

“That’s not fair!” Evelyn cried. “We came to warn you!”

“She never wanted to come back. She knew the risk. She came because of you. You’re her only ally,” I said.

“You’re wrong. Being like this changes everything. And if Cooper thinks we’re bad… What will he make of you? A Hunter?”
###Chapter 0356
Athena

“We’re leaving.” Luc’s hand closes around my arm, pulling me away like I’m nothing but dead weight slowing him down.

I wrench my arm back, prying his fingers off my skin. “Let go of me. I’m not done here.”

His voice drops, cold and sharp. “If we don’t move now, I’ll put a bullet in that blonde’s skull.”

'It was bound to happen sooner or later.' Nyx murmurs inside my head.

“Because you didn’t like what she was saying?” I hiss as he shoves me toward the passenger side.

“No.” His whisper is barely audible. “I want whoever’s watching to hear me say it.”

I almost turn my head. Right before we knocked, I’d felt eyes on us—but there were no foreign scents, no movement in the shadows.

“Eyes on me, Athena. They can’t know we see them. Look around, and you’ll give us away.”

“I don’t smell anything,” I mutter. Nyx echoes the thought.

“We’re not meant to. They’re masking. That’s why I can’t pinpoint them. Could be more than one.” His voice is low, urgent. “We’re heading back to Obsidian Howl. If they follow, that’s on them. I made a vow to keep you safe. Now buckle up.”

He slams the door, nearly catching my fingers. I curse under my breath as I yank the seatbelt across my chest.

“You think it’s that Levi guy?” I ask as he speeds away from Seraphina’s house.

“Not sure. Even if he masks his scent, I should’ve caught Hannah’s. She wasn’t there.”

“Maybe they were watching them, not us.”

“Us.” His tone leaves no room for doubt. The car accelerates. My knuckles turn white where I grip the belt.

“How can you be so sure?”

“There’s a car on our tail. Has been since we left.”

I glance back. A silver sedan falls behind, then slows to a crawl before pulling onto the grass as we round the bend. 'They know we made them.' Nyx growls.

“Lycans or Wolves?” I ask.

“Lycans, I think.”

“You think?”

“Masked scent makes it hard. Could be Wolves. Not sticking around to find out.”

“Is masking scents easy?”

“No. It’s difficult. Deliberate.”

I study his profile. There’s so much I don’t know about him. He only shares fragments, and only when he wants to. You can’t force anything out of a Wolf like him.

I check behind us again. The road is empty. “They’re gone.”

Luc nods but doesn’t slow down. We nearly sideswipe an oncoming car. Finally, he eases off the gas, and we roll to a stop. I release a shaky breath. Cars still make me nervous.

“You’re worried about Hannah. We’ll find her,” I say, hoping it comforts him.

He glances at me, his expression unreadable. Then, slowly, a smile forms. “You’re right. We will.”

Just as the car starts moving again, something slams into us from behind.

The seatbelt locks, crushing the air from my lungs. My organs lurch forward. I taste bile.

Sharp, burning pain tears through my chest and stomach where the belt digs in.

I look toward Luc.

He isn’t in his seat.

His body is half through the shattered windshield. Shards of glass pierce his skin. Blood sprays from multiple wounds.

'Athena, don’t move.' Nyx’s voice is dazed, disoriented.

“I have to help him,” I whisper, fumbling for the belt clasp.
###Chapter 0357

'Alexander is coming.' Nyx groans. 'Just stay still.'

I ignore her and unclip the seatbelt, tearing it from my flesh and splattering my own blood across the car interior.

It takes me a moment to locate the door handle as Nyx keeps urging me to remain motionless. 'He's approaching. I can hear him. Alexander's coming.'

I couldn't hear anything except her voice and the blood roaring in my ears. My head throbbed painfully and my vision blurred, the acrid smell of gasoline filling my nostrils. I flung the door open just as another impact threw me forward. My wrist snapped against the dashboard followed by a sickening crack in my pelvis when I tried to move.

The contents of my stomach erupted along with copious amounts of blood.

A third collision threw me violently and my head struck something sharp before I collapsed back into the seat. Each breath became increasingly difficult. My entire body felt shredded internally.

"LUC!" I forced out, but it emerged as a breathless whisper without sound. He wasn't moving as I coughed up more blood.

"No time left. We need to extract them now!" A male voice shouted.

"Plenty of time remains." A woman muttered dismissively.

"She's mated to Alexander. He's likely already en route." Another man snapped urgently.

"Then we should accelerate. Remember, she's also an Alpha. If she survives, her healing will be rapid. Complete the operation now. Before he tracks her here."

I closed my eyes as footsteps approached, desperately willing myself to heal. I needed just enough recovery to fight back, just enough to shift and tear their fucking hearts out!

"Eliminate him first." The woman muttered coldly. "We don't need that bastard shooting people. Or discovering our identities."

More glass shattered loudly, followed by the sound of something heavy being dragged across pavement. Moments later, gunshots rang out and a single tear traced down my cheek. Luc hadn't stood a chance against these scentless attackers.

'Nyx, we must shift and I can't accomplish it alone right now.' I pleaded. This represented our only survival path.

'We remain too weakened.' She informed me as another wave of nausea overwhelmed me.

Someone grabbed my wrist and I prepared to swing my broken arm at the attacker. "Athena, it's me." Luc whispered urgently. "Open your eyes, look at me."

I stared at him in stunned disbelief. "You... you're alive?!!" I felt blood trickling from my mouth corner. He used his thumb to wipe it away.

"Needed to play dead. Only way to extract you. Can you walk?"

I shook my head weakly and sharp pain shot through my neck. I fought down rising bile. "I'm not... I don't think I'm healing." My lungs struggled for oxygen.

He glanced over his shoulder, rapidly assessing options.

"Did you eliminate them?" I coughed, bringing up more blood.

"Absolutely. fucking assholes. Now I need to extract you from here." He slid one arm behind my knees and forced the other behind my back. "This will cause pain."

Luc lifted me from the car as I cried out in agony. Somehow, bone fractures hurt significantly more when not shifting.

He placed me on the ground and adjusted my legs and hips as running footsteps approached us.

Alexander's scent intensified and I felt overwhelming relief that Nyx had been correct. He dropped beside me as my pelvis clicked back into position.

He cupped my face and used a cloth to wipe blood from my chin. "Don't speak. I have you. You will recover."

"What the hell occurred?" He demanded from Luc while picking glass fragments from my face.

"These bastards rear-ended us deliberately." Luc informed Alexander.

I turned my head, ignoring neck pain to see who Luc referenced. Three deceased individuals lay roadside. Sebastian stood over them frowning deeply. Each had a bullet embedded in their skull.

I recognized all three.

Wolves from Obsidian Howl.
###Chapter 0358

I rise too fast, and the world tilts violently.

'Athena, are you okay?'

Nyx only groans in response. I leave her be. Her presence, however faint, is enough.

"Athena, don't move." Alexander commands.

"No... I'm alright. I'm healing."

He reluctantly offers a hand, helping me stand. He knows I wouldn't have stayed down anyway.

Alexander keeps a firm grip on my arm as we cross the road toward the three dead Wolves. He acts like I might collapse at any moment.

Even in death, these Wolves are strange. They carry no scent. How did they hide it from us? Especially Luc. He could always identify any species. Whatever method they used, it must have been applied recently.

"We need to move them off the road." Alexander tells Sebastian. "If someone drives by, it will raise too many questions. We don't need more trouble at our gates."

He hasn't mentioned they're from Obsidian Howl, but his fury is palpable.

"Wait." I say as Sebastian reaches for the nearest body. "Did you search them? They might have information. A reason for this attack. Or who sent them."

Luc stares at me. "You expect me to find a written confession?"

"I don't know! Maybe!" I snap back.

"The problem isn't them, Athena." His gaze shifts to Alexander. "The problem is how many of your own Wolves have turned against you."

"They wouldn't." I argue. "They didn't turn against Alexander. Their target was me. And you."

Sebastian searches the bodies anyway but finds nothing. He and Luc drag the corpses from the road into the trees. Alexander guides me back toward Obsidian Howl. His anger radiates from him, though his eyes remain fixed ahead.

"Alexander?"

"I told you not to come out here. You could have been..."

"But I wasn't." I interrupt. "I am not weak, Alexander. That car hit us three times. I should be dead. A human would be. But I'm not. You couldn't have predicted this. We came to talk to Evelyn and Seraphina. None of us expected an attack from Obsidian Howl Wolves. Wolves from your own pack."

I stop walking, blinking hard. A dizzy haze still comes and goes.

"Are you okay?" he asks, watching me closely.

I nod, but Nyx remains unusually silent. "You have Titan. When you get hurt, does it affect him too?"

"Yes. Some call it a curse. But the truth is, they are a part of us. Completely. Give Nyx time. She'll recover. You should be resting too." Usually, he'd offer a reassuring smile. This time, he doesn't.

"What are you going to do?" I ask as we start moving again.

"Have Theodore examine you."

"You know that's not what I meant. Do you think the man who took Hannah is connected to this?"

"It would be one hell of a coincidence if he wasn't. Luc said the man was questioning Hannah. Another one of the newcomers said the same thing. It's possible Levi has corrupted them. Twisted their minds. Made them doubt everything."

"Obsidian Howl has always been a strong pack. They've always respected you as their Alpha. So whatever he's telling them, it's powerful enough to convince them."

"The issue is, everything is changing. There are more Lycans in the pack now than Wolves."

"You think the Wolves feel threatened?"

"It's a possibility. Maybe only a few have fallen for his lies."

"But Levi is a Lycan. If they have a problem with Lycans, why would they work for him?"

He stops me, cupping my face. His crimson eyes search mine. "Do you trust me?"

"Yes. You know I do." I murmur, confused. "Why?"

"When we reach the road leading to the gates, I'm carrying you in. I need you to pretend you're unconscious. Out cold." His eyes sweep over me.

I frown. "You're testing them?"

"I have my methods for finding the disloyal. All I ask is that you stay quiet. And remain inside, out of sight, for the next few days."
###Chapter 0359

“What about the boys?”

“I’ll be there. So will Alexander, Sebastian, Brianna, Theodore.” He lets out a slow breath. “And Luc if necessary. The twins can’t speak yet anyway. They won’t be telling anyone your location or condition.”

“And Charlotte? She could say something. I don’t want to burden a child with secrets. She just began school.”

“Charlotte stays with Athena and Sebastian tonight. We’ll figure out a long-term plan. It might not even be needed. Carrying you through the gates should be enough to expose any other traitors in the pack. I’m hoping it was just those three fools. But if there are more, they will be handled. Immediately.”

“That might work for your Wolves. But what about the Lycans? How will they react when they learn it was your pack members who attacked me? They came here to support me. This could start a war right on our territory. I won’t allow that.”

I asked the Lycans to come. Because of one manipulative man, everything was falling apart. A war here would be exactly what someone like Levi wanted.

“That’s what he’s after.” I murmur as the realization strikes.

“You think he wants a war?”

“Yes.”

Alexander raises a brow.

“The Wolves, when they approached us, they talked about finishing something. If they wanted me dead, they would’ve attacked me first. But they went for Luc. They muttered about doing it fast because I would heal. They needed him out of the way.”

I shake my head, connecting the fragments. “They’re Wolves who know you, Alexander. They likely know how you operate. If they’re working with him, they told him that. What is the one thing you are guaranteed to do?”

“Protect you and our sons.”

I quicken my pace. “Where are the boys?” A spike of fear hits me, but I know they’re safe. I would feel it if something was wrong.

“With Zachary and Brianna. Zachary won’t let anyone near them.”

“Good. But if you carry me back into the pack, it’ll trigger the wrong kind of reaction. We should return as if nothing happened. If anyone asks, say we had car trouble. It’s technically true. And if anyone questions inconsistencies, you’ll have your answer about who’s involved.”

“Is that so?” A glint appears in his eyes. He likes my plan. He grins. “The problem is, you’re covered in blood.”

I glance down at my shirt. A large hole is torn through the front, right over my stomach. The fabric is soaked with my blood. My jeans are streaked and spotted with deep red. My arms are stained. I can only imagine what my face looks like.

“You can’t walk into the pack looking like that. It’ll draw too much attention, especially if we’re pretending everything is normal.” He takes my hand and leads me into the forest. “There’s a stream nearby. We’ll clean you up. Theodore can bring fresh clothes.”

“Theodore?”

“It would look too suspicious if both Zachary and I left. Plus, he’s watching the boys and Brianna isn’t fully recovered. Theodore can leave without raising questions.”

We move deeper into the woods until we find a fast-flowing stream. His crimson eyes lock onto mine as he tears my shirt apart and peels it from my shoulders. I’m left in my blood-soaked bra and jeans. He pulls off his own shirt and hangs it on a nearby branch. Kneeling by the water, he soaks the torn fabric, frowning at the red streaks across my abdomen.

“Come here.” He commands.

I step closer. Using the wet shirt, he gently wipes the blood from my stomach. His touch is careful around the area where the seatbelt had dug into my flesh. No marks remain, but his fingers trace the spot where the wound had been.

“I’m healed.” I whisper.

“It never should have happened.” His hands move to my waist as he stands.

“I’m not as fragile as I used to be. Anyone could have been hurt.”

“But it wasn’t just anyone. It was you.”
###Chapter 0360
Athena

He wiped the damp cloth across my face.
His gaze tracked a single water droplet’s path.
It trailed down my chin.
Then it slipped between my breasts and vanished into my bra.

“I’ve lost too many people already,” he murmured, continuing to clean the blood from my skin.

“I’m not going anywhere, Alexander. I’m yours. Always yours. I will fight for our family.”
I meant every word.
There was a time I might have surrendered, but that version of me was gone.

He pulled me against his chest so forcefully the air rushed from my lungs.
His lips found mine before I could even catch my breath.

In one smooth motion, he lifted my legs around his hips and lowered us to the ground.
His tongue plunged into my mouth.
He ground his hardening length against me, a raw and desperate need.

His lips traveled along my jaw, leaving soft kisses that sparked electricity across my skin.
He moved lower, to the mark on my neck.
His breath alone set my flesh on fire.

“Alexander,” I whispered as he tore the bra from my body.

His mouth crashed back onto mine.
He cupped my breast, rolling my nipple beneath his thumb before drawing it into his mouth.
My fingers tangled in his hair.
My back arched.
A cool breeze brushed my thighs as he ripped my jeans away.

He pulled back, watching me struggle to breathe.
Then he ran a single finger straight up the center of my black panties.
The touch stole my gasp.

He stroked me slowly, pushing my thighs apart.
He pressed his face against my damp heat.
With his teeth, he shredded the fabric and tore it away as if it were the last barrier between us.

His tongue glided over my core.
His hands slid around my ass, lifting my hips from the ground.
He plunged his tongue deep inside me.

I bit my lip, stifling a moan as he licked me clean.
He squeezed my ass as I rocked against his face.
His crimson eyes locked with mine.
There was something intensely arousing about him watching me as he brought me closer to the edge.

He paused. “Trying to stay quiet?”

I nodded, hyper-aware of our surroundings.
Someone could be watching.
We wouldn’t even know—especially if they had no scent.

He drove a finger into me.
His tongue flicked over my clit.
He watched me struggle to contain my sounds.

A second finger forced a gasp past my lips.
A third had me shuddering around him.

He didn’t let me savor it.
He pulled me against his bare chest.
His hard length pressed against my entrance.

Alexander cupped the back of my head, kissing me desperately.
His other hand teased me from behind.
He lifted me slightly, letting just the tip of his cock press against me.
He held me there, suspended.

“I need you,” I whispered.

He nipped my bottom lip.
Then he thrust just enough to enter me.

“More!” I pleaded.

He grinned, stroking me with his fingers.
He knew exactly what I wanted.

He held my chin between his thumb and forefinger. “Take control.”

I moved his hands from my ass.
I pressed my lips to his as I sank onto his solid length.
He groaned when I began to ride him.
His hands locked around my waist, fingers digging into my skin as pleasure coiled tight inside me.

I moved slowly, savoring how he filled every part of me.
My head fell back.
My muscles clenched around him. “Fuck… Ohhhh…”

Alexander gripped my hips, thrusting up each time I came down.
He forced me to move faster until I was overwhelmed.

“Don’t stop,” he growled.

He unexpectedly slapped my ass, guiding me up and down his length until he swelled inside me.

He sucked my nipple into his mouth and bit down just as ecstasy shattered me.
My movements slowed, riding him through the rippling waves of pleasure.

Suddenly, he flipped me onto my back.
He pulled my right leg over his shoulder and plunged back into me. “I’m not done with you yet.”

He fucked me until my vision blurred.

Our heavy breaths synchronized.
He thrust harder and deeper as I begged him to fill me.

He pressed his whole body against mine.
His teeth found the mark on my neck and sank deep as he released inside me.

Afterward, we lay together.
His tongue swiped over my neck, cleaning the blood from the bite.
He ran his thumb over the wound as it healed.
I’d never questioned why he bit me, or why he seemed to savor my blood.
I only knew he never did it to cause pain.
###Chapter 0361
"Let's go." He stands and offers his hand. "As much as I'd love to stay here with you, Theodore is almost here."

"You ripped all my clothes." I mumble, letting him pull me up.

He retrieves the shirt he'd hung on a branch earlier. "Why do you think I took this off?" He presses a soft kiss to my cheek before heading to the stream to clean up.

I wrap the blue shirt around myself, thankful for Alexander's larger frame. The fabric swallows me whole, covering everything necessary. As he fastens his jeans, he returns to carefully roll the sleeves up to my elbows. "I should bring you out to the woods more often."

The sound of snapping twigs alerts us to Theodore's approach. He carries a backpack and hands it to Alexander. "Sebastian and Luc were wondering where you disappeared to."

"We'll be back soon. Did they say anything specific?"

"Luc mentioned car trouble. Sebastian suggested you two might have taken a detour." He winks at me before turning away. "I brought another vehicle. I'll be waiting in it." Once he's gone, I start unpacking the clothes. The sight of underwear confirms Brianna packed this—men never remember such details.

"How did Luc know to say that?" I murmur, pulling on the white underwear set.

"Like you said, it's not exactly a lie. Probably the best excuse he could come up with before speaking with us."

He leads me back to the road where Theodore sits in the driver's seat of a jeep, reading while eating an apple. He tosses the book into the backseat when he spots us. "Ready?"

Alexander opens my door and wipes something from my cheek as I sit. I notice red on his thumb before he quickly rubs it away and jumps into the front passenger seat.

Does he not trust Theodore anymore?

'He's being cautious.' Nyx murmurs.

'Finally.' Her voice brings me comfort.

'Please don't get hit by another car.' She grumbles. 'It really messes with me.'

'It wasn't intentional.'

I feel her mental eye-roll. 'Such a stupid accident that caused so much damage.'

'I don't plan on letting it happen again! Were you aware of everything else that occurred?'

'Yes.' She groans.

'Three members of Obsidian Howl.' I sigh. 'Three of Alexander's own Wolves.'

'You're handling it correctly. I would have suggested the same approach.'

"You're unusually quiet back there." Theodore notes. "Everything alright?"

"Just tired." I reply while watching Alexander stare him down.

'It's not him.' I link Alexander. 'He only asked why I'm quiet, nothing about the accident. You know Theodore—he wouldn't doubt us.'

Alexander doesn't respond, but I see him relax slightly though not completely.

'I think Luc would know immediately if it were Theodore.' Nyx tells me.

I have to agree, and I truly hope only those three deceased Wolves were involved.

Theodore stops the car just outside the gate. Caleb and another Wolf are on duty. I'm surprised Alexander agreed to this arrangement given his frequent statements about Wolves maintaining control here.

"Where's Finn?" Theodore asks.

"His mate went into labor. I was closest, so I offered to cover his shift so he could be with her." Caleb shouts while opening the gates.

"I'll send someone to relieve you." Alexander tells him.

"Not necessary, I've got this covered." Caleb nods enthusiastically.

"Wolves should guard the gate."

'We don't know who else is involved.' I link Alexander again. Having a Wolf plotting against the pack shouldn't be guarding our home.

"Change of plans. You'll take this shift." Alexander tells Caleb.

Caleb looks pleased to have something useful to do. He must be struggling with the transition from leadership to having no responsibilities.

"Report any problems directly to Athena." Alexander orders as Theodore drives us through.

Theodore drops us at the packhouse entrance and announces he's heading to the hospital to check on things.

"I thought you wanted him to examine me." I murmur to Alexander as we watch him drive away.

"Didn't I examine you thoroughly enough?" He muses.

Even after all these years together, he still knows how to make me blush.
###Chapter 0362
Alexander

“That’s the smarter move.” Luc nods, running a hand through his dark, unruly curls. “Athena’s right. If others are part of this, they’ll expect her to return looking broken. Or not return at all.”

Brianna bounces Logan on her knee, her expression thoughtful. “And you don’t want Theodore informed? Why?”

“I respect everything Theodore has done for this pack and for Athena,” I say, holding my mate’s gaze. “But I’m concerned his thirst for knowledge could be used against him. He’s too open with information. That might lead him into danger. Only the people in this room need to know what’s happening.”

Everyone nods in agreement except Athena. Her blue eyes remain locked on mine, lips pressed tightly together. She senses there’s more to my reasoning but chooses to stay silent.

Zachary shifts forward. “Any sign of Hannah?”

“No.” Athena sighs, gently rocking Evrin in her arms.

“And you didn’t kill Seraphina?” he presses.

“No.”

“She was terrified,” Luc adds quietly.

Sebastian looks at Athena, confused. “You were scared?”

“No,” Luc clarifies with a faint smile. “Seraphina was.”

“After everything she’s done, she should be,” Zachary says, frowning at Luc. “I thought you, of all people, would have ended her.”

I watch Luc glance toward Athena. She had stopped him, though I haven’t had the chance to ask why.

'Perhaps because Seraphina has lost her abilities,' Titan murmurs. 'Athena may no longer see her as a threat.'

“There were no others in the area. Sebastian and I swept the perimeter,” Luc informs the group. “No additional tracks. Just those three.”

“But there were no scents, either,” Athena adds. “There could have been more. We just didn’t detect them.”

“So they’ve found a way to mask their scent completely? How?” Zachary asks.

“I suspect Levi is behind it,” Athena explains. “He stripped Seraphina and Evelyn of their Lycan abilities without a binding. According to Evelyn, he’s done the same to others—men and women, Wolves and Lycans. He doesn’t discriminate.”

Brianna looks concerned. “But Hannah? She hasn’t done anything wrong. She has her struggles, but who doesn’t? How does she fit into all this?”

“Levi didn’t like seeing us together,” Luc says, his voice low. “I was going to kill him. Hannah stopped me. She said she would talk to him. She should have let me pull the trigger.”

“You couldn’t have known he would do this,” Brianna murmurs.

“I should have trusted my instincts, but…” He doesn’t finish. We’ve all been there. So consumed by our mates that rational thought sometimes escapes us. A few seconds can change everything.

Zachary redirects the conversation. “Any issues with the deceased Wolves?”

“No.”

“That’s not entirely true,” Sebastian mutters. He looks at me. “A couple years back. Derek was one of the members questioning your decision to let Athena stay, right after you revealed she was a Lycan. Remember? He tried to stir up the pack, but it didn’t work.”

“Why wait this long to act?” Athena asks. “Why wait until there are more Lycans here? Why wait at all?”

“Because he’s a fool!” Luc snaps, cleaning his gun. “He just needed someone to validate his grievances. My guess is Levi did exactly that. And now those three are dead. They got what they deserved.”

“Put that away!” I command sharply. Luc rolls his eyes but tucks the gun into his belt.

“What about the others? Any past issues with them?” Zachary asks Sebastian.

“No. In fact, they always performed their duties. Never caused any trouble. Julian didn’t wrong them. They were always proud to be part of Obsidian Howl.” He turns to me. “Just like the rest of us. We could be facing multiple threats, Alexander, or this could be the work of one rogue Lycan. We simply don’t know.”

“Can you tell?” Athena asks Luc.

“Possibly.”

“I need a better answer than that,” she snaps.

“I’ll see what I can do.”

“Don’t kill any of them without speaking to me first,” I order as he heads for the door.
###Chapter 0363

"If it's self defense, I won't have time to bring their problems to you." Luc slams the door shut behind him.

"You know he was attacked too, not just me." Athena murmurs. "Yet you're treating him like the enemy."

"My priority isn't protecting him."

'She's right.' Titan reasons with me. 'He did exactly what you asked. He protected our mate. After killing them, he could have walked away. But he didn't.'

"He doesn't have to help. He could leave anytime, yet he stays." Athena sighs.

"Yeah, because his mate is here." Zachary retorts.

"You found your mate here too, Zachary." Brianna gives a sad smile.

Zachary frowns at her. He never speaks of my sister. He acts like it was just a minor event in his life.

"I found mine here as well. It happens." Brianna continues.

"This is different." Zachary shakes his head.

"How? You lost it when Gabriel took Isabella. Just like Luc is furious someone took his mate. You two have more in common than you admit. Maybe you know it but refuse to accept it. You've even started carrying a gun again, just like when you were human."

"Bri," Sebastian begins.

"No." Brianna stands and hands Logan to Sebastian. "I need a moment."

Athena passes Evrin to me and follows Brianna out of the office.

"I should go after..." Sebastian mutters, trying to give Logan to Zachary.

"Let Athena talk to her." I tell him. "This isn't just about what happened this afternoon." I glance at Logan in Sebastian's arms. Brianna had been holding him, bouncing him, but never looking at him. It was like she was just going through the motions. "Damn." Zachary mutters. "I didn't think. She didn't say anything."

"She wanted to be here." Sebastian adds. "She would have spoken up if it was too much. She loves the twins. Maybe for a moment, she... forgot." He sits in the empty chair, leaning forward with elbows on his knees. "I wasn't paying attention."

"You can't be in her head every second." I offer. "She needs to grieve."

"You're right." He sits up straight. "So what's the plan for this Cooper situation?"

"We stick to Athena's plan for now. At least a few days. Everyone needs to monitor pack movements. Especially those coming and going."

"And then?" Zachary asks.

"Then we make a plan. But first, you need to take the Blood Oath. Become an official part of Obsidian Howl. I need you to link everyone. The Lycans aren't ready to swear allegiance yet."

"I thought you planned some fancy ceremony?" He raises an eyebrow, a smirk forming.

"There was going to be one. But something tells me you'd rather get it over with."

"Good."

"There's something else."

Sebastian nods at me. I'd already discussed my plan with him. Whether Zachary would agree was another matter.

"What is it?" Zachary asks, his gaze shifting between Sebastian and me.

"I want you to become a representative of Obsidian Howl."

"Doesn't my Beta role already cover that?"

"Yes, but I want you to become a Black. Like it or not, you're one of us."

He laughs. "You're joking, right?"

"You do realize that by mating Isabella, you became family. Athena sees it that way. I see you more as a brother than Julian ever was. I don't care about your genetic makeup. You're one of us."

He looks at Sebastian. "He's serious?"

"Completely serious." Sebastian muses.

"Then why didn't you..."

"I took the Beta oath. Becoming a Black wasn't an option for me. My parents would hang me if I ditched the family name."

I clear my throat. "The question is, Zachary, how important is your surname? And do you see yourself as a complete part of this pack?"
###Chapter 0364
Zachary

My gaze shifts to Sebastian.
Alexander couldn't be serious.
Not now.
Not with everything happening around us.

"Well?" Alexander murmurs as he places Evrin on the floor.
I watch the toddler crawl toward his brother, completely unaware of the tension.
How simple life must be when your only concerns are food, sleep, and dry diapers.

"Why?"
"I believed I had made myself perfectly clear." Alexander states calmly.
"Your differences mean nothing to me."
He gestures toward his sons.
"They are different from me, yet they are unquestionably mine."

"Athena?"
"Athena knows everything."

"And she approves?"
"She thinks it's a brilliant idea."

"Zachary Black." I whisper to myself.

"Fits you well." Sebastian smiles.

Brianna had always been my only family.
Just the two of us until... then just us again, surrounded by those who eventually became trusted friends.

"You don't need to decide immediately-"

"I'll do it." I interrupt.
"I want this."

Alexander extends his hand and we shake firmly.
"Welcome to the family."

He sends Sebastian to fetch Athena and Brianna so they can witness both the oath and my formal acceptance.

Brianna wraps her arms around me, apologizing for her earlier outburst while Athena jokes about assigning me uncle duties immediately.

"First, you must formally accept the name." Alexander informs me.
"Give me your hand."

"Do you know what you're doing?"
"Absolutely." he assures me.
"My stepmother performed this same ritual when she accepted me as her own."

I extend my hand again and he grasps it firmly.
Sebastian steps forward with a length of rope, binding our wrists together while leaving the backs of our hands exposed.
He draws a knife and positions the tip against Alexander's skin.

"Do you, Zachary, relinquish all past ties and accept the Black family name as your own?"
"I do."

The blade pierces Alexander's flesh, tracing a path toward my hand as blood wells from the cut.

"Do you, Zachary Black, accept me, Alpha Alexander Black, as your brother?"
"I do."

Sebastian's knife breaks my skin, merging Alexander's blood with mine across our connected hands.

"Do you, Zachary Black, swear to forever carry the Black surname and represent Obsidian Howl for all your days?"

A smile touches my lips.
I already feel a new connection forming with Alexander that never existed before.

His hand tightens around mine.
His crimson eyes watch me intently as he awaits my response.

"Yes, I do."

"And finally, do you, Zachary Black, accept the position of Obsidian Howl's Beta?"

"Brace yourself." Sebastian warns with a smirk.

"I do."

Sebastian drags the blade back to Alexander's hand, deepening the cut.
As our blood mingles further, I feel connections forming with pack members I've never sensed before.

Alexander's hand heals faster than mine.
Sebastian unties the ropes carefully.
Alexander's eyes meet mine.
'Now you can hear all of us when necessary.' His voice echoes through my mind.

Hearing a Wolf's thoughts feels strange.
Even stranger is the newfound strength coursing through me.
Is this how Alexander feels constantly?

The wound on my hand begins healing until only a faint pink line remains, which then vanishes completely.

"How do you feel?" Alexander asks.

"Different. How is this possible?"
"My blood." he murmurs.

"But it's not a Blood Tie?" Athena asks with concern.

"Nothing like what Marcus did to you." Alexander assures her.

"Why now?" I ask.

"Shouldn't you have asked that before agreeing?" Sebastian laughs until Brianna elbows him.

"You made it sound like you've been considering this for months." I say to Alexander.
"So why now?"

"You're right." he acknowledges.
"I've been contemplating this for several months.
But there never seemed to be a perfect time to ask.
Now I realize there never will be a perfect time except the present moment.
You were going to take the Beta Oath regardless, so why not offer you what I hoped you'd accept?"

"Now you'll know if I'm in trouble, and I can link you when necessary." he adds.

I glance at Brianna who winks at me.
Neither of us expected anything like this when we came here.
My goal was simply to provide her a place where she could live the life she wanted.

I only aimed to protect the Alpha.
I never imagined something like this would happen.

"So now that I'm officially pack, what's next? I assume we continue as normal?"

"Exactly." Alexander confirms.
"We stick with Athena's plan unless circumstances change.
We'll re-evaluate if anything happens.
But everyone must remain vigilant.
I won't let anyone destroy what I've spent years building."
Alexander scowls, his eyes settling on his twins.
###Chapter 0365

An unfamiliar urge to shield them surged through me, stronger than ever.

The twins grew fussy. Athena announced she was taking them to eat. Sebastian and Brianna departed for home, leaving Alexander and me by ourselves.

“There’s something else, isn’t there?” I asked.

“I’m implementing additional safeguards.”

“In case something happens to you. Correct?”

He released a heavy breath. “A contingency always existed. I had siblings. But if something happens to both myself and Athena now, the boys are far too young to assume command. I require a Black capable of holding the position until they mature. You are more than capable of leading a pack.”

“It won’t come to that.”

“Precautions are necessary,” he murmured.

I nodded. Knowing his plans earlier wouldn’t have changed my decision. I still would have agreed.

“I also need to review our pack’s history with you,” he added. “Just as a precaution. But first, I want to check on Caleb.”

We moved toward the gates. The last place I anticipated finding Caleb. Alexander informed me the other guard left abruptly after his wife went into labor.

Caleb was engaged in conversation with the second guard but raised a hand in acknowledgment as we approached.

“What is that?” Something dark lay further up the road toward the main thoroughfare. A sprawled object nearly concealed by the tree shadows.

I detected no scent.

“Open the gates!” I shouted, moving closer.

Caleb gave me a puzzled look but pulled the gate open just enough for me to slip through.

I instructed Alexander to stay back. If this was a trap, only one of us should risk it. I advanced until the faint scent of a Human reached me. Slowing my pace, I scanned the surrounding trees, sniffing the air. Only familiar pack scents and the Human’s odor were present.

“Shit.” Red hair peeked out from under the hood.

“What is it?” Alexander called out.

“Get Luc!” I yelled back, turning the person onto their back.

Hannah’s eyes were closed. A deep gash ran from her temple, across her right eye, down to her chin. She needed stitches. And antibiotics.

I lifted her from the ground and hurried back through the gates. “Stop standing there!” I snapped at Caleb and the other guard. “Secure the gates!” How had they missed her? How had they missed her attacker?

“Theodore is at the hospital,” Alexander informed me. I didn’t hesitate, charging across the grounds.

“Hannah?” Theodore muttered as I burst through the doors. “You found her?”

“She was outside the gates. Like this. Alexander is locating Luc. She no longer smells like a Lycan.”

He ignored me, examining the facial wound. “She’s not healing either.”

He worked swiftly, cleaning the injury as I checked her hands. Blood, skin fragments, and hair were trapped beneath her nails. I’d seen it countless times in my human life. She had fought her attacker. Tried to leave a mark. Had she escaped him? Had she returned here alone?

“WHERE IS SHE?!” Luc roared.

“She’s with Theodore,” Alexander told him. “Allow him to assess her condition.”

“Are you certain it’s her? All I scent is Human.”

I stepped out of the room. “It’s her. He did to her what he did to Seraphina and the other woman.”

He shoved past me into the room, only to immediately turn and exit.

“Luc.” Alexander blocked his path. “You must maintain control.”

“I am not part of your pack,” he growled back.

“Charging out there blindly, with no knowledge of how she returned, helps neither you nor her.”

“I believe she returned alone,” I interjected, describing what I found under her nails. “I don’t think she was dumped here.”

Luc narrowed his eyes at me. “You found her?”

“Yes.”

“Where?”

“Outside the gates.”

“And who was guarding the gates?” he demanded.

“None of your concern.”

He looked to Alexander for answers.

“I side with Zachary on this. I cannot allow you to confront my pack members without information. Sit down. Hope your mate recovers.”

Luc glared at us both but sat in the chair outside Hannah’s room.

Theodore emerged a short while later.

“She’s mildly dehydrated. I’ve sutured the wound. Her body shows no signs of healing, so scarring is inevitable. And it’s not the only scar. I discovered deep scratches on her back as well. Likely from a Lycan. Judging by the cuts on her feet, she was running before she collapsed.”

Neither man at the gates had seen her.
###Chapter 0366
Lucas

My gaze traces the wound on Hannah's face.
Theodore had stitched it up skillfully.
He made it as neat as possible.
But he was right.
She would have a scar.
A permanent reminder of the attack.

She can't heal anymore.
Everything can hurt her now.

Her breathing is slow and steady.
Ugly purple bruises cover her pale skin.
I watch as her soul fractures before my eyes.

I feel no connection to her.
I can't scent her as my mate.
Yet I can't bring myself to leave.

I should go deal with those bastards at the gate.
Neither of them saw her.
Did she call for help?
Did they see her and ignore her?
Did they watch her fall and turn away?

I step out of the room.
Zachary is waiting.
"How is she?"

"What do you think?"

He studies me.
"Is she awake?"

"No.
Where's Alexander?"

"Gone to investigate."

"Then I should go too."
I glance back at the room.
Zachary's hand slams against my chest.

"No.
You stay with her.
She'll want to see you when she wakes."

"I never claimed her."
I tell him.
"I can't scent her anymore."

"So you'll just walk away?"
He challenges me.
"Just like that?"

Hannah and I were never meant to be.
I'm a Hunter.
She's a Lycan.
Was a Lycan.
It should never have worked.
Yet I couldn't get her out of my head.
I met her every day since the fire.
At first, it was just to watch her.
To make sure she didn't cause more trouble.
Then I got to know her.
It became harder to stay away.
I couldn't keep my hands off her.

It was wrong.
But I couldn't stop.

"Well?"
Zachary asks.

"This is new for me."
I mutter.
Decisions were always easy for me.
Until her.
I wanted to protect her.
Even though our bond was wrong.
I still want to protect her.
But I could also walk away.

"We'll find a way to restore her Lycan."
Zachary says confidently.

"You don't know what we're dealing with.
That Evelyn girl said she lost her Lycan five years ago.
What if there's no way?
What if this is her life now?"

"She can stay with the pack.
She'll be safe here."

I snort.
"You're serious?
Look around.
She was taken from the pack."

He stares but says nothing.

"Go on.
Say it, asshole."
I demand.

"Why didn't you trust your instincts?"

"You're blaming me?"
I snarl.

"You said it yourself.
You didn't like the guy.
But you let him go because of one of Lottie's stickers.
You trusted a seven-year-old.
A kid who can't remember breakfast."

"Trust me.
I won't make that mistake again."

Groans come from Hannah's room.
Zachary glares as I back away.
I slip inside to check on her.

She moans in pain as she stretches.
Eyes closed, her hand moves to her face.
Fingertips brush the fresh stitches.
"Ow."

"Leave it."
I tell her.

"Luc."
She whispers, peering through slits.

"I'm here."
I take her hand.

"I made it back."
She winces.
"Everything hurts."

"I know.
Close your eyes and sleep.
We'll talk after you rest."

"His name wasn't Owen."
She murmurs, eyes closing.
"His name is Levi."
Her grip on my hand loosens.
Her heartbeat slows but stays steady.
She drifts back into unconsciousness.

"It was just as we suspected."
I mutter to Zachary.
He stands in the doorway behind me.

"How did she get away?"
Zachary mutters.
###Chapter 0367

She didn't give any details. I won't disturb her rest until she's ready. Seraphina got away. Athena believes Levi intentionally released Hannah. He might have wanted her to return here. To demonstrate his capabilities to us.

I glance back at him. I will make him pay. I will tear him apart piece by piece.

I don't doubt that.

Silence hangs heavy between us.

You don't need to blame me. I mutter after a long moment. I already blame myself. She is my mate. I failed to protect her. My indecision caused this. I couldn't decide if I should mark her. I couldn't decide if I should fully accept her. She is the first to truly challenge my every thought. Do you understand what that feels like?

Not the questioning part. But I failed Isabella. He takes the seat near the door. I couldn't protect her from her own mind. Or from her twin. I missed what was right in front of me.

You haven't spoken of her since it happened.

Because I couldn't. He sighs, leaning back and shaking his head. Everyone in that packhouse adored her. Her brother was there. Her friend. Her nephews. Lottie.

Exactly! People who loved her. People waiting for you to talk about her.

None of them understand losing a mate. None truly grasp how close I came to killing my own mate.

I nod, looking at Hannah. I considered putting a bullet in her brain when she first arrived. But I could never bring myself to do it. Just like Zachary only managed to shoot her in the collarbone.

That's why Athena shot her, right? So you wouldn't have to kill your own mate.

Yes.

And it wasn't Isabella in the end.

It still looked exactly like her. He frowns deeply. I've killed many people. As a Human. And after I turned. But watching her die was the hardest thing I've ever endured.

Losing a mate is different from other deaths. You know that, Zachary. Deep down, you know it wasn't her.

Why didn't I see she had given up? He asks me.

You told me her mind was in chaos. That wasn't her doing. It was his. Take it from someone who lost a mate and a child. Let yourself accept it. Don't block it out. It will destroy you otherwise.

He scowls at me. Do you see something? Is that what you're trying to say?

You don't strike me as the type who actually wants to know.

You're right. I don't. He rises to his feet. Alexander is linking me. Let us know when she wakes.

You took the oath? I ask, surprised. I fully expected him to back out. Perhaps he was stronger than I thought.

And I became a Black.

Maybe that was exactly what he needed. Time would tell.

I pace the corridor. Theodore is with Hannah, checking her vitals. I had to leave. I couldn't stand another man's hands on her. Even if he was only helping. If I hadn't left the room, Hannah wouldn't get the help she needs.

Her door opens and Theodore steps out cautiously. Are you going to hit me?

No.

Good. Because I will fight back.

I stare at him. I've never seen him at training. Yet he maintains a very muscular, toned physique. He must be doing something. How is she?

Still unconscious. I changed her IV. Did some x-rays. Nothing is broken. Whatever happened, she had a very lucky escape.

Does she need anything? Anything you might not have here? She is essentially Human now. I can go pick up supplies.

I have everything. Isabella kept this place fully stocked because of Athena. The practice has continued since. Just in case.

She was always prepared.
###Chapter 0368

"More than any of us." Theodore confirms.

I should have seen it coming. I should have spent more time with Isabella. Maybe then I could have prevented this. Or maybe this was fate. The higher powers always played their twisted games. That truth was becoming clearer every day.

"How long until she wakes?" I ask.

"Several hours, most likely. Her recovery will be different now, as you know."

"Good. I have business to attend to."

"You should remain here." Theodore blocks my path.

"You said she'll be asleep. I need to find the bastard responsible."

"Who?" He challenges me.

"I don't know yet. But I will."

"Let Zachary and Alexander handle the investigation. Someone must have seen something." Theodore speaks with too much optimism. He would never have survived as a Hunter.

"I can't just sit here. That's not who I am."

"What should I tell her when she wakes?"

"Tell her I'm going to kill the one who did this."

I shove past him and throw open the hospital doors. Darkness blankets the pack grounds. An unusual silence hangs heavy in the air. A few Wolves and Lycans wander about, but the usual energy is absent.

I jog toward the gates. I need to question the guards. I also need to see where Zachary found her. Perhaps there are tracks they missed. Perhaps I will see what they could not.

Caleb stands guard at the entrance. His focus is directed outside the pack, while his Wolf faces inward. An improvement over the usual chatter among guards.

"Caleb!" I call out. He doesn't move.

"Hunter!" He growls in response. "Is the girl alright?"

"She'll live. Seen anything unusual?"

"Nothing."

"You didn't notice Hannah either, did you?"

"I thought it was a fallen log." He mutters. "No movement. No sound. No scent."

"You need to be closer to catch human scent." I reply. His Wolf glares at me.

"Dane informed me. I've been around Lycans too long. It won't happen again."

I have no reason to trust him. I doubt I ever will.

"You relieved Finn, correct?" I press him.

"Yes."

The Wolf avoids my gaze now. He actively prevents our eyes from meeting. Even when I step closer, he looks over my shoulder.

"You're being very quiet." I smile coldly. "What's your name?" I consider calling him coward. "Grant!" He spits out.

"Friends with Finn?" I ask.

"I have nothing to say." His green eyes glare daggers.

"No? Your avoidance suggests otherwise."

"I didn't see anything." He grumbles.

"Not a very competent guard, are you?" I muse. He holds his ground but looks ready to flee. "I'll have to inform Alexander. He won't want weakness at the gates."

"I only meant..."

"What this idiot means is he has a problem with me guarding the gate." Caleb remarks. "We were arguing when Alexander and Zachary arrived with the girl. I already told them both."

"Lycans don't belong on gate duty." Grant snarls at me.

"Is that your decision?" I muse. "Or are you deflecting because you know something about what happened to Hannah?"

"I know nothing about that."

The infuriating part was he told the truth about Hannah. But he was hiding something else.

###Chapter 0370
Alexander

Finn passes his newborn son to me. It’s an Obsidian Howl tradition for the Alpha to greet new pups and formally accept them into the pack.

I press my thumb, marked with a drop of my blood, to the infant’s forehead. He is now a recognized member of our pack. Finn’s blue eyes glow with pride as he smiles.

“Apologies for leaving my post at the gate,” he murmurs. “I couldn’t let my mate face this alone. Though the little one had already arrived by the time I got here.” His mate was supposedly still upstairs, being examined by one of the nurses my sister trained. But I couldn’t catch her scent anywhere.

'We need to investigate,' Titan insists.

'We will,' I assure him. 'Timing is crucial.'

“It’s fine,” I tell Finn, returning the child to his arms.

“Caleb’s a decent man,” Finn says. “I’m grateful he was nearby.”

“Grant wasn’t pleased, though, was he?” Zachary asks.

“Grant is never pleased,” Finn mutters, gazing down at the pup. “That man wouldn’t be happy with a fortune and women fawning over him day and night. But things are shifting in this pack. He can’t cling to the past forever.”

“Is that so?” Zachary probes.

“It is. We have a Lycan Luna. You’re mated to a Wolf. Brianna is mated to a Wolf. Rumor says the Hunter is also bound to a Lycan. Everything’s changing. Maybe that’s what the Moon Goddess always intended.”

“The Moon Goddess,” Zachary echoes thoughtfully. Perhaps he was starting to see things from Lucas’s perspective. Lucas often spoke of higher powers. Truth or not, no one could say for sure.

Finn nods, missing Zachary’s sarcasm. “She has a plan for each of us.”

Zachary stays silent and turns toward the window. “Seems you have another visitor.”

Lucas always knocks the same way, like it’s his secret code announcing his arrival. I open the door to his grim expression. “Is Hannah alright?”

“She’s resting. Theodore says she’ll recover, but there will be scars.” His hazel eyes shift to Finn and the baby, then back to me. “We need to talk.”

'Stay here,' I mind-link Zachary. 'Dig carefully. Be subtle.' Having this connection with him is incredibly useful.

He gives a slight nod as I follow Lucas out. “You’re certain about Hannah?”

“What I said stands. Something strange is happening at the gate.”

“I know Grant is furious about Caleb being there. He made that very clear to Zachary and me.”

“It’s more than that. I sensed Grant was hiding something, yet he was truthful about not seeing Hannah.”

“But you believe he’s involved?”

“I need to look deeper.”

He starts to leave but turns back abruptly. “That pup isn’t Finn’s. And he wasn’t born today. Possibly yesterday, or even the day before. Remember, they arrive with faint soul signatures.”

“Not his?”

“And not his mate’s either.” He walks away. “You should question this.”

'Why does he always have to be so vague?' Titan grumbles.

'It’s just how he is.'

I return to Finn’s home as Zachary is asking, “So you just took him?”

Both men look toward me.

“You won’t believe this,” Zachary says, shaking his head.

I sigh. “Where did you find him?”

“In the city. Yesterday.” Finn sits on the edge of the sofa, holding the pup close.

“But you said your mate went into labor?” I ask, glancing toward the staircase. Zachary shakes his head subtly.

Finn reaches into his pocket and pulls out a crumpled note. He hands it to me. “I should’ve brought this to you when I found it two days ago.”

I look down at the message. 'I can’t stay here with these monsters. They’re taking over. Destroying our pack. They’ll kill us all. I won’t raise my child here.' The handwriting isn’t Chloe’s.

“She took our unborn pup and left.” He takes a shaky breath. “When I went to the city, I found this boy, wrapped up and abandoned in an alley. I thought it was meant to be.”
###Chapter 0371

"You claimed the nurse was upstairs." Zachary's voice was sharp. "Attending to your mate."

"Paige is upstairs. She's Chloe's closest friend. She's searching for any hint of where Chloe might have gone. She was here with him while I was at the gate." Finn gestured to the infant in his arms.

"So you lied about her being in labor. Hoping for what, exactly?" I demanded. "That I wouldn't notice your mate never showed up?"

"I don't know. I didn't think it through. I need to find her."

"Track her down? That's a terrible idea with a pup. It's downright reckless." Zachary shook his head.

"Um," Finn's brow furrowed, deep lines forming.

"You didn't consider that either?" Zachary asked.

"I could handle it. I could care for him and search for Chloe."

"No, you couldn't. Bringing him here was the right move. He'll need this place when he's older." Zachary stated.

"Are you implying what I think you are?" I asked, annoyed he hadn't mentioned it sooner.

'Luc could have warned us.' Titan sneered internally.

'So could Zachary!' I shot back.

Zachary nodded. "That pup is a Lycan."

"WHAT?!" Finn recoiled, dropping the infant as if it were a live explosive. Zachary lunged forward, catching the tiny form before its head could hit the floor.

Footsteps sounded above. Paige appeared at the banister, freezing. She knew we were here. Why the act of being caught?

Zachary stood, cradling the newborn against his chest, glaring at Finn. "That was unacceptable."

"GET DOWN HERE!" I growled at Paige.

Her eyes stayed locked on me, fingers twisting in her pink hair as she descended. I pointed to a spot beside Finn. She sidestepped around us, her heart hammering. I threw the crumpled paper at their feet. "Which one of you wrote this?"

They exchanged a glance. "Chloe," they said in unison.

"Lies."

"It's Chloe's!" Finn insisted.

Zachary stepped back as I crouched before Finn, gripping his face. My nails dug crescent moons into his skin. "Chloe has done work for me. I know her handwriting. I'll ask again. Who wrote this?"

"He did." Paige squeaked, eyes downcast.

I watched him elbow her. "Quiet!"

"Check upstairs." I told Zachary, standing. The marks on Finn's face healed instantly, vanishing.

I paced before them as Zachary disappeared. Paige fought tears. Finn stared blankly ahead. "How long did you think this charade would last, Finn?"

"It's not a game."

"Your reaction to the pup says otherwise. You're the one with a Lycan problem. What was your plan?"

His jaw tightened.

"Start simple. Where is Chloe?"

"She really did leave." Paige blurted. "A few days ago."

"Let me guess, Finn. You were on gate duty? Tricked the other guard so Chloe could slip out?"

He turned away, seething.

"Where did she go, Paige?" I pressed.

"With some man. Cooper, maybe? Levi? We were supposed to join her. He promised a better life. Away from the Lycans."

I laughed coldly. "You both despise Lycans, yet you'd run off with one."

They stared, mouths agape.

"He's a Wolf?" Paige protested.

"No. He is not. Your loyalty is truly inspiring."

"She was packing!" Zachary returned, the pup cradled in one arm, two backpacks dangling from his other hand.

"I assumed as much."

"What will you do to us?" Paige pleaded.

"I believe you already know the answer to that."
###Chapter 0372
Brianna

Something feels off.

I frown, restless despite doctor's orders to stay in bed. Lying still only makes me dwell on what I've lost. I need movement, distraction.

From the window, I spot Alexander, Zachary, and Luc shoving a man and woman forward. The man looks familiar, one of the gate guards usually. But it's the bundle in Zachary's arms that confuses me. A doll for Charlotte perhaps?

Athena steps closer to the window, careful to remain half-hidden behind the curtain. "No one can see me here, remember."

"Tell me I'm hallucinating. Maybe I'm sick again and this is some fever dream."

She pinches my arm sharply.

"Ow!"

"Not dreaming." She risks a quick glance outside. "Why is Zachary holding a pup?"

"It's not a toy?"

"Toys don't squirm like that."

I look again just as a tiny arm stretches out. The movement is brief as the group moves farther away.

"Maybe those Wolves had a baby?"

"Mako and Kira are due soon, but that's not Kira." She presses against the wall, closing her eyes. "That's one of Isabella's nurses from the hospital. Paige, I think her name is."

She takes a deep breath. "I know what's happening."

"What?"

"They're being hunted!"

"Luc will execute them?"

"Not just Luc." She sighs heavily. "Some pack members will shift and chase them like prey. Alexander has done this before."

"Before you came, a woman drugged me with Wolfsbane Toxin. Nearly killed me. Alexander took her to the forest and had his Wolves hunt her down. They tore her apart while she still breathed."

"Seriously?"

She nods as more pack members approach. They're already shifting as they move. The woman, Paige, clings to the guard like he might protect her. I can see her lips moving, probably begging for mercy. They must know what's coming if this is Alexander's chosen punishment.

"It's for those he feels deeply betrayed by." Athena whispers. "If Luc hadn't shot those who crashed into us, Alexander would have done the same to them."

"But he never did that to Julian?"

She shrugs. "Julian was his brother. Even after what happened with Seraphina, even after what he did to Isabella. He couldn't do it, though he threatened Julian many times over the years."

I nod slowly. I can't call it cruel. I've seen Rogues do worse. I've done worse myself. Long ago, I almost beat Athena to death.

"But the pup... surely Alexander won't let that be torn apart?" I mutter, disgusted by the thought. I watch Zachary turn away from the Wolves, heading back toward us. The small form is cradled against his chest, and I breathe out in relief.

"No, he won't harm a pup." Athena confirms.

I turn my attention from Zachary just as Mako and Paige bolt toward the forest. Mako shoves her down right before the trees, giving himself a head start as he disappears into the greenery. She scrambles back to her feet desperately.

Alexander keeps his hand raised high. A signal for the Wolves to hold. Even Luc has shifted, ready to join the chase.
###Chapter 0373

Alexander is giving them a head start.
But we all know they won't escape alive.

His hand drops.
The Wolves charge forward with impossible speed.
They are hyped by the hunt.
Alexander shifts next, taking his time.
He moves into the forest like he's savoring every moment.

Those wolves are going to suffer.
I assume they deserve it.
A small part of me wants to watch it happen.

"Brianna?" Zachary's voice cuts through my thoughts.
"Up here." I call back.

He enters the room still cradling a tiny pup.
The baby is somehow fast asleep.
"Why do you have a Lycan pup?" Athena asks.
"It's a long story." His dark eyes find me by the window. "I assume you saw what happened?"

I nod. "Athena explained the rest."
"They were planning to leave and join Levi." He shakes his head in disbelief.
"Why?" Athena asks.
“It sounds like he made them an offer. They were stupid enough to accept."

"And the pup? Where does he fit in?"
"Finn tried telling Alexander the pup was his and Chloe's. It quickly became clear he wasn't. Turns out Chloe already left with Levi while still pregnant. Finn picked this one up from the city. He practically threw him away when he learned the boy is Lycan."

"So they didn't know Levi is Lycan?" I ask.
"No."
"And decided to kidnap him?" I gesture to the wrapped pup in disgust.
"Finn claimed he found him dumped and abandoned. Whether that's true, I don't know."

"What's going to happen to him?" I ask.
Surely Alexander wouldn't just abandon him again.
"I was hoping you would take him. Until we figure out where he came from. And if anyone is looking for him.”

I stare at him, speechless.
"He's maybe a day old. Maybe two according to Luc. He doesn't even have a name. I thought you might like to name him."

I feel frozen.
Still processing why Zachary asked me.
"I still have loads of the twins' baby stuff." Athena declares. "I'll go dig it out."

"You want to give me a pup?" I mutter as Athena leaves with a smile.
"I can't think of anyone better."
"I can't...." He steps toward me and holds the tiny pup out. "He's not mine."

“And Lottie isn't mine." He presses the pup against my chest.
I have no choice but to hold him as he pulls his hands away.
"Zachary, don't." I've never felt panic like this.
My heart thuds heavily.
Blood whooshes between my ears.
My lungs grow tight. "I'm not ready."
But he is already stepping back.

"Then it's a good thing you have a whole pack supporting you."
"And a mate." Sebastian announces as he enters the room.
"Give him to Athena. She's had practice." I move toward Zachary.
He refuses to take him back and folds his arms. "Look at him." He mutters instead.

I glance at Sebastian.
He watches me calmly.
Leaving the decision to me.

The pup starts to move in my arms.
He'll probably start crying any second.
I take a deep breath and shift my gaze to the poet.

Deep brown eyes stare back at me.
My heart explodes in the best way possible.
###Chapter 0374
Seraphina

"We gave her the warning. Now we should go." I sigh, pulling a thick sweatshirt over my head. The cold is absolutely brutal. I've never experienced anything like this before. My body feels foreign, vulnerable. Every gust of wind cuts right through me. Is this what being human always feels like?

Evelyn brings me a heavy blanket, carefully tucking it around my legs. "I don't think we should leave. Not yet."

"We've overstayed our welcome already." I insist, my voice tight. "You only came here to tell Athena about Levi. We did that. Somehow, I'm still breathing. I'd like to keep it that way, even if it means I freeze to death in this miserable place."

She rolls her eyes, calling me dramatic. "What about your mother? She confirmed your mother is in the pack. Just like you thought she would be."

"So?" I snap.

"Don't you want to see her?"

"What I want doesn't matter. They want nothing to do with me. I already explained why."

"I never took you for a quitter."

"I'm not the person I used to be, Evelyn. He stripped all of that away. Too many people in that pack hate me, and that's just the Wolves. Staying here is a death wish. Someone will kill me, and you won't be able to stop them."

"Is that what you truly want?"

"I don't know anymore."

She sighs, sitting beside me and pulling part of the blanket over her own legs. "Are you scared?"

I consider her question. It wasn't sarcastic. It wasn't mockery. She meant it. I guess, on some level, I am scared. It would be stupid not to be. I used to say that to all the targets I hunted.

Lycans have probably taken over most of Obsidian Howl by now. If they have, that means they submitted to Athena. Maybe even to Alpha Alexander. Who knows how many are living there now? Who knows how many of them I've personally pissed off? I'm not ready to find out.

When I saw Lucas, I truly believed he would kill me right then and there. But he just watched me. His expression was unreadable. That made it so much worse. I know what I did to him. He knows what I did. Yet he just stood there, asking his questions.

It's easier when people outright threaten you. At least then, all the cards are on the table. I wouldn't have to feel this constant, gnawing dread sitting heavy in my gut.

Not being able to read people is terrifying.

"Neither of us can fight them off," I mutter. "We're nothing compared to them. They could break us like dry twigs if they wanted to."

She frowns, taking a slow sip of her coffee. She's completely addicted to the stuff. "Maybe she will help us."

I let out a bitter laugh. "Please don't tell me you're talking about Athena?!"

"I just think... she had a clear chance to kill us. She didn't take it. They found us here. They could have forced their way in, slit our throats, and vanished. But they didn't. Maybe there's a chance for us here."

I shake my head. "Or maybe she just wasn't in the mood. Or maybe she was too focused on getting her answers. She wanted information."

Evelyn nods slowly. "Maybe you're right." She leans her head against my shoulder. "I've been thinking about her questions. I think someone is missing."

"That means he's already here." My heart hammers against my ribs. The thought of being his prisoner again makes me sick. What would he do to punish me for escaping? He already shaved my head. My hand instinctively moves to my scalp, touching the short, dark fuzz.

I haven't looked in a mirror since Evelyn made me. It probably looks like I got electrocuted.

"It'll grow back," Evelyn murmurs, noticing my movement. "It won't be this short forever." She wraps an arm around my waist. Her reflection in the dark TV screen shows a small smile. Her constant positivity is something I can't understand. But I guess she's had more time to get used to this life.

As much as I don't want to die, the thought of living like this forever is terrifying. I hated humans when I was a Lycan. That hasn't changed. I like Evelyn, but I think that's only because we share a common enemy.

"Do you think it's true?" I whisper, watching a candle flame sputter and die.

"What?" Evelyn asks softly.

"That Athena was right. That I was let out on purpose?"

She sighs and sits up straight. "I've wondered that myself. For five years, I waited for someone else to escape that place. I always wondered if there were others who took different routes. Maybe they stuck to roads instead of the woods. That's why they never found my farmhouse. But you said your door was unlocked, just like all the others. So yes, I believe she was right."
###Chapter 0375

"What's his game plan?"

"He might be hunting you. Finding me would just be an extra prize. Or he could be after the female Alpha. I doubt Cooper ever has a real strategy. He adapts. He exploits opportunities as they arise."

"Will he strike at Obsidian Howl?"

She exhales slowly. "Absolutely."

More Wolves and Lycans will lose their gifts because of me. If he was already nearby, I’d be the cause of our kind’s downfall.

I tell Evelyn I'm heading to bed. She asks if I'm alright.

"Just exhausted," I lie. The guilt was a physical pressure, threatening to collapse my lungs.

I wait for hours after Evelyn retires, ensuring she's asleep. Silently, I pull on a jacket and slip outside, careful not to make a sound.

Standing at the end of the driveway, I weigh my choices. Turn left toward Obsidian Howl and hope for a swift end. Or turn right and vanish forever, living out my days as a Human. Neither option appealed to me.

I check my pockets, fingers brushing the rectangle of my credit card. I'd found it hidden in my vanity. A contingency plan from when I first moved in. More than enough funds to start over, far from this chaos. Somewhere no one could ever find me. I took it, just in case I chose right.

"Where are you going?" Evelyn steps beside me.

I close my eyes. I hadn't heard her. Not even the door. "You weren't supposed to know," I murmur.

"I knew something was wrong when you went to bed at seven. You never sleep that early. Not even after what that monster did to you."

"It's not safe here," I whisper back. The lone streetlight illuminates her face, giving her grey eyes a ghostly glow. "If Athena found us, Cooper definitely can. He could be watching us right now, and we'd never know. Obsidian Howl is a few miles that way, or..."

She grips my shoulders and turns me to face her. "Who cares if he's watching! He can't hurt us anymore. So I'll ask again. Where are we going?" Evelyn laces her fingers with mine. "I'll follow you anywhere."

"This isn't me," I mutter. "I don't ask for help. I am the help. People paid me to do their dirty work."

"Okay."

"Okay?" I whisper back.

She nods. "I thought I knew how to help you. But this is your choice, Seraphina. If you want to run, we run. If you want to talk to Athena, we go to Obsidian Howl."

"Why the change of heart?"

"Because I see you. I'm not a Lycan anymore, but I see the guilt you carry. The sorrow in your eyes is plain."

I start walking, pulling Evelyn with me.

"Are you sure?" she asks.

"Yes. If they kill me, don't fight back. It's what I deserve. And more."

Her hand tightens around mine.

As we walk, she asks about the layout of Obsidian Howl's territory. I tell her I never got past the gates. Julian gave me some intel, but not much. I was never truly interested.

We find two burnt-out cars. The rear one looks like it rammed the front vehicle. The front car resembles the one Lucas hurried Athena into when they abandoned us.

"Is that...?" Evelyn asks.

"I think so," I mutter, quickening my pace.

Tire marks scar the ground.

A trail of blood leads from the windshield of Athena's car to the grass verge. Another dried crimson pool sits near the passenger door.

"What happened here?" Evelyn whispers, as if we're being watched.

"Not sure. They torched the cars to destroy any DNA evidence," I whisper back. "Standard procedure. I've done it myself."

"Are they dead?"

"No. Alexander would be breaking down my door if they were. I'm certain of that."

I scan our surroundings and grab Evelyn's hand. "Let's go. I don't want to stay here."
###Chapter 0376
Athena

I sifted through boxes of miniature baby clothes, creating a hopeful pile. My fingers brushed against soft fabrics, each tiny garment whispering a silent prayer. I desperately waited for Zachary’s mental link, praying Brianna had accepted the little boy.

'She’ll say yes, right?' Nyx’s voice echoed with hopeful anticipation.

'I truly hope so.' She needed this. Sebastian needed this.

'The boys can have playdates together.' She murmured happily. 'Someday, he could even become Beta.'

I smiled softly. 'He’s just a newborn, Nyx. Not quite ready for that yet. But when the time is right, absolutely.'

'What if the birth parents—'

'We’ll face that if it happens!'

'She hasn’t given an answer yet.' Alexander’s voice rumbled through my mind, and my heart sank. 'But she hasn’t refused either.' He added, 'And she hasn’t taken her eyes off him since she saw him.'

'Fingers crossed.' I whispered back, continuing to sort through the clothes as he severed the link.

'What if she actually says no?' Nyx asked suddenly.

'Then I suppose we’re about to have a third pup.' Though I was definitely not prepared for that reality.

Just as I finished, Alexander appeared with a triumphant smile. “They’ve taken him home.” He took the box of baby supplies from my hands.

"She said yes?"

He nodded. “I never truly believed she would turn him away. Not after she gave him a name.”

"She did?"

He smiled warmly at me. “Luca."

'I adore it!' Nyx declared. I was certain if she had her way, we’d be perpetually pregnant.

"It seems Logan and Evrin will have a new friend." I murmured. "Everything in that box should last them a couple of weeks until they can get their own things."

His gaze locked intensely on me as he nodded. His fingers drummed rhythmically against the side of the box. "I won’t let her lose him.”

I understood his meaning perfectly.

"Alexander, they abandoned him. If they show up here, demanding him back, do you honestly believe I would force her to surrender him?"

"I simply needed confirmation that we share the same perspective." He nodded toward the box. "I’ll deliver this to her myself, considering you’re supposed to be resting indoors. I spotted Caleb returning from the forest. He was conversing with some other pack members. He’ll likely be here shortly."

“Thank you.” He had finished executing those traitors already. I had half-expected a prolonged, torturous process keeping him occupied all night.

I followed Alexander down from the attic. Just as he departed, a blood-drenched, half-naked Caleb entered. He left crimson footprints in his wake as he strode toward me. Alexander didn’t even pause, continuing his exit as if witnessing the Alpha drenched in blood was an ordinary occurrence.

"Are they dead?" I asked, though the answer was already evident.

"Do you believe I would have returned if they weren’t?"

"You’re furious." I could see it in his eyes and feel it radiating from him. "But you’ve handled them."

"They were merely two Wolves, Athena. Who knows how many other disloyal pricks are turning against Obsidian Howl! I’ve sacrificed immensely to build this pack to its current strength. Somewhere along the way, complacency set in. Their loyalty is wavering. They needed a stark reminder of the consequences. A brutal refresher on the punishment for disrespecting you and me."

I nodded in agreement.

"You don’t disagree?" His tone was laced with skepticism.

"No. I’ve taken lives too." I turned away, but he seized my arm, spinning me back forcefully into his blood-soaked chest. He dragged his thumb across my cheek, tracing a path down to my lips. His breath was hot and heavy as he inhaled my scent deeply.

"Where are the twins?" He asked softly.

"Sleeping. It’s late." I murmured in response.

"And the pup?” His anger seemed to be subsiding.

"Brianna agreed to take him. She’s taken him home with Sebastian. Alexander is delivering some of the twins' old baby items for me, to help them get settled."

"Good. Come shower with me." He lifted me effortlessly from the ground, wrapping my legs around his hips, and carried me up the stairs. I was immensely grateful I hadn’t chosen to wear white today.

He was intentionally slow undressing me, peeling my clothes away inch by inch as if unwrapping a precious gift. As he did, he left bloody fingerprints on my garments and my skin.

Stepping under the hot water, diluted blood swirled quickly toward the drain. Caleb held me tightly, pressing my back firmly against his chest. His hardening length pressed into the small of my back as he cupped my stomach possessively.

He pressed his lips against that specific spot just below my ear. A place that never failed to send shivers of pleasure through me. "When do I get to put another pup in you?”
###Chapter 0377

"Not yet." I whisper, fighting the deep ache building within me.

His lips travel to the mark he left earlier. His teeth graze the sensitive skin as a low growl vibrates from his chest. One hand slides down to my thighs. He uses his leg to gently part mine from behind. His finger traces a slow line across my core.

"Is that so?" He murmurs, his finger beginning slow circles around my clit.

I nod, biting back a moan.

He withdraws his finger abruptly. Spinning me around to face him, he pulls me tightly against his body. The water has rinsed away most of the blood, leaving only a few specks on his chin. I wipe them away gently. He lifts me effortlessly, pressing my back against the cool tiles. A gasp escapes me. The cold surface is a relief against my overheated skin.

"Feeling warm?" His crimson eyes hold mine intently.

I nod again. It's more than just warmth. An internal fire is igniting, burning me from the inside. Sweat trickles down my spine. The steaming water makes my skin feel too tight. It's been too long since I last felt this sensation.

"No. No. No." I push Alexander back, quickly turning the shower dial to the coldest setting. I position myself directly under the freezing stream, trying to regain control. He watches my struggle with amusement.

'Yes. Yes. Yes.' Nyx chants happily in my mind.

"This can't be happening now!" I say aloud. Alexander grins widely. Nyx informs me our body is preparing for another pup. "Athena..." His grin remains. "You can't stop this."

"I know. How did you know?"

"I could scent the change." He steps under the icy water with me. His muscles tense from the cold. "You can fight it, but you won't win. You know that. You'll only delay the inevitable." He tucks my wet hair behind my ears.

His crimson eyes seem to see into my soul as he leans in. His hand reaches out, turning the water off. The fire inside me flares instantly. The persistent ache settles heavily within. Resistance is futile.

Two days. At least it was shorter than the first time. My body still aches. My core throbs.

Alexander traces gentle circles around my navel with his fingertips. He pauses, turning my face toward his. "You're quiet."

"Tired." I whisper. "And sore."

"Roll over." He instructs, moving to his knees.

"Why?"

"Just roll over."

I flip onto my stomach. He straddles my thighs, pinning me gently to the bed. His hands glide along my back. His fingers press into my muscles, working out the developed knots. It feels incredibly good. I sink deeper into the mattress as my body relaxes.

"Before you ask, Victoria and Sebastian have the boys. They've had them for the last two days." He informs me.

I nod into the pillow as his magical hands continue their work.

"Has Zachary been monitoring the situation?" My voice is muffled by the pillow.

"Yes. Sebastian too."

"Nothing's happened?"

"Not that I'm aware of. I instructed them to link me for anything critical. Otherwise, they have it handled."

"Something feels off." I murmur.

His hands still on my lower back. I try to shift, but his legs hold me securely. "Can't you just enjoy this moment?!" He teases. "It's... It's a gut feeling."

"I know. You're not the only one who thinks things are too calm after recent events."

"Why didn't you say anything?" I wriggle out from under him. He finds this amusing.

"Because I wasn't letting my mate go out there while in raging heat. You're also supposed to maintain a low profile. For now, you stay here with me. Zachary and Sebastian have everything under control. Whatever is happening can be tomorrow's problem."

I slump back onto the pillows. He wraps his arms around me, pulling me close. I close my eyes. I hear him groan. My eyes snap open. His eyes are glazed over. I glance at the clock. It's past midnight. Guess today's problems are already beginning.
###Chapter 0378
Alexander

"Stay here." I tell Athena, pulling on a shirt.

"Who is it?" She asks, already climbing out of bed and heading to the closet.

"It doesn't matter. You need to stay here."

She continues pulling on underwear as though I hadn't spoken. "I was right." She murmurs. "My gut feeling was right." She shimmies into a pair of jeans. "Is it Levi?"

"No."

"Who? Hannah. Did something happen? Has she said something?"

"It's not Hannah. Please will you just stay here until I know more."

"Our children are not even in the house."

"Athena and Sebastian won't let anything happen to them." I reassure her.

"Do they need to be kept safe? What's happened? You are not answering my question Alexander!" She plants her hands on her hips and stares at me. She was trying to read my mind.

I shake my head because I knew what her reaction would be when she found out who was at the gate.

"It's Seraphina."

She stops what she's doing to stare at me.

'Three, two....' Titan starts counting down, preparing for Athena to snap. Instead, she sinks into the large chair, her soft blue eyes fixed on me. "Why is she here?"

"I don't know, but will you please stay here? Just until I know what she wants. Besides, you are supposed to be staying in the house."

She doesn't answer me.

"Athena?"

She puffs out her cheeks, "I will stay."

I grab my jacket and kiss Athena before leaving. Whether she would actually stay put was another thing.

Down at the gate, Zachary is staring at Seraphina while Caleb is asking her questions. The blonde with her was sitting on the ground, leaning against Seraphina's legs, half asleep, clutching an old backpack.

"I was expecting Athena." Seraphina mutters.

"Well you have me." I snap. "Why are you here?"

Her brown eyes shift between us as she tries to come up with a response. She tugs her sweatshirt tighter as though it was going to protect her.

"Well?"

"I don't know." She looked genuinely unsure. "I could have left. I wanted to leave. I was ready to go. All I had to do was turn right."

I see Caleb roll his eyes. I'm guessing he has heard a similar story before.

"Then I decided to come here or maybe it wasn't my choice."

"Why?"

"Would you believe me if I said I'm still trying to figure that out. I'm probably going to die here. I deserve it." She puffs out her cheeks just like Athena does when she is contemplating something. She screws her face up. "I think Athena was right."

"Are you fucking shitting me?" Caleb scoffs. "Your mother and I told you that for years. You go and lose your Lycan and suddenly you have seen the light. Maybe we should have packed you off to this prick years ago."

"Hey!" I snap. "There is no need to wish this on someone." As much as I despised Seraphina, no one deserved to lose their beast. Death, yes, but this was just pointless.

Seraphina gestures to Evelyn who is snoring. "She helped me understand a lot." She returns her gaze to Caleb. "I made some mistakes."

"Mistakes?"

"Alright. I made some big fucking cock ups. Is that what you want to hear? I learned to survive and thrive from it. I made money. Got myself a home. I lived a life that I thought I loved. And now I am no one, happy?!"

Caleb takes a few steps away. I'm not sure if he was trying the tough love act as a father figure, but I knew he wasn't helping.

"You tried hunting down my mate and also slowly sent my brother over the edge in the process."

"So he is dead?" She asks, rocking on her heels as she keeps her gaze off of mine. "I didn't feel it, but I thought as much."

"Fucker tried to pull off something that hasn't been done before. He didn't survive it." Zachary growls. "But you, you made him into something else."

She raises her brown eyes to me. "I did like him. I fell for him and let him mark me and then...." She shakes her head and her hood falls down, revealing her short hair. She quickly hikes the hood back up and pulls it down around her face. "I'm sorry. I dragged him into my mess, preyed on his need to get revenge. You're right, I screwed him up, because that is what I do. I have always worked alone. That was why I was known as a Lone Wolf. Ironic when I wasn't even a Wolf."

"Why are you telling me this?" I demand. "Do you think I'm going to welcome you with open arms? Let you stay in the pack? I could give you a list as long as my arm for everyone who wants you dead. Me included."

"Right." She bobs her head. "I told you because can't hide it. Because your Hunter will know the moment he sees me if I am lying, that's if he doesn't kill me first, I screwed with his life too." She frowns and takes a deep breath. "My name is Seraphina Blackwood. I was never a Harrison, nor will I ever be one. I am not a Lycan anymore, nor am I or will I ever be a female Alpha."

She focuses on me." But I am scared."

"You're scared?" Zachary asks with a tilted head "You, the one who slaughtered Gabriel. The one who killed a pregnant Lycan and then stole their pup." She nods. "We have all killed people, but I am scared, because I think I'm about to become responsible for the downfall of hundreds."

My eyes flicker over the possible hiding places, maybe she was lying and someone was waiting, or maybe she was telling the truth. "Bind them both."

I tell Zachary and Caleb. "Put her in the dungeon," I point at Evelyn, "And bring Seraphina with us."

Evelyn squeaks as she is hauled to her feet by Caleb. Big dark circles sat under her eyes. She seemed confused and she didn't protest immediately. I don't know how much she had heard, but it would be better to split them up. Make sure their stories are the same.

"No, please, don't." Evelyn begs Caleb. He binds her hands together and throws her over his shoulder like it was nothing and carries her away. "Don't hurt her." Seraphina pleads.

"Then let's hope for her sake that she speaks the truth."

"Where are you taking me?" Seraphina asks as Zachary marches her across the grounds. Thankfully it was quiet but she still got a few stares. It wouldn't be long until everyone knew she was here.

Zachary pushes her onto the chair and reties her wrists to the wooden arms. Her breathing is heavy and she screws her face up while twisting to one side.

"What's wrong with you?"

"It's called a stitch." She mutters. "Evelyn said it's part of being Human."

"You trust her?" Zachary asks

"She helped me." Seraphina frowns

“Funny that, isn't it. She just happens to be just like you and she is the first person you ran into when you escaped.”

Her frown deepens to a scowl. "She has been nothing but kind to me. I never asked for it. I never wanted it."

"Yet she talked you into coming back here."
###Chapter 0379
Seraphina

I stare at the Lycan in disbelief.
“That’s not true. You think you know, but you don’t. You don’t know her at all. You haven’t even tried to understand her!” I defend Evelyn fiercely.

“Should I tell her?” Zachary asks Alexander. His dark eyes gleam with interest.

“We wait for Luc.” Alexander replies with a casual shrug.

My spine goes rigid instantly.
Dread floods my veins.
Of course it would be him—Lucas Adler.
He’s the one who would pull the trigger.
I still don’t get why he didn’t do it when he came to my house.

A sick knot tightens in my stomach.
My human instincts scream at me to run, to escape this uncertainty.
Damn these weak human traits.
“Just talk to her,” I beg.
Evelyn would despise being locked up, especially after five years of freedom.

“I’m not interested in what she has to say. Not now.” Alexander states coldly.

I lower my gaze.
There’s no way I can overpower these men.
Maybe once I stood a chance, but not anymore.
Arguing feels pointless.
But I have to try.
I need them to see I’m not a threat anymore.

I clear my throat.
“Why do you assume she convinced me to come back here?”

“Because she did.” A deep voice sounds behind me.
Then I feel the cold press of metal against my skull.
I shut my eyes and count, waiting.
Will I hear the shot, or will death come silently?

“Luc, lower the weapon.” Alexander commands.

The gun lifts from my head, but I don’t breathe.
He doesn’t have to obey Alexander.
Hunters work for no one unless they choose to.
He could still blow my brains out any second.

“Speak.” Alexander orders.
His crimson eyes unnerve me.
How does Athena stand them?

“About what? I told your people everything at the house.”

“Athena said Evelyn did most of the talking.” He counters.

“Because I had already told her everything. Evelyn has a way of making people listen. Especially when my life was on the line, given my past.”

“But that’s not like you, Seraphina, is it?” Luc sneers. “You always want to be heard. You always have to get the last word.”

I bite my tongue.
“Things change,” I whisper. “You’ve got this all wrong.”

“No, you have.” Luc grabs my chair and spins me to face him.
“You know what I see. I couldn’t figure her out. There’s truth in her words. She phrases things carefully. She’s built a front, a strong one, probably worked on it for years. But she has no scent.”

“Neither do I.” I snap back.

“You do,” he tilts his head, studying me.
I know what he’s doing.
I’ve seen him do it before—trying to see deeper into the soul.

I swallow hard.
Sweat beads on my hairline.
Nervousness is a new feeling for me.
I hate it more than anything.

“You smell human—sweat and all. But she has no scent. That’s why she stays with you. Your scent is weak, but it can still transfer. She needed it to rub off on her.”

“W…what? No, she had her Lycan stripped away, just like me.”

The Hunter shakes his head.
“No.”

“You’re lying.”

He smirks and shakes his head again.
“I don’t lie. You should know that by now, Seraphina.”

“No one is completely scentless.” I scoff.

“That’s where you’re wrong.” He glances past me, as if waiting for confirmation.
“You passed two burnt-out cars on your way here, right?”

I nod.
“The first looked like the one you and Athena left behind.”

“The assholes in the second car had no scent. Nothing. Just like your friend in the dungeon. The problem is, they were Werewolves. It seems they’ve been given something to completely hide their scents. Just like your blonde friend.”
###Chapter 0380

I glance back at Alexander over my shoulder. "He's lying to me, isn't he? This is just some sick psychological game to punish me before you execute me, right?"

"No."

I turn to glare at Lucas. "Then how couldn't you detect she was a Lycan when we first arrived? I call complete bullshit."

"I'm still working that out myself. She masked her scent remarkably well and concealed her true nature somehow. But now, it's fading. And she's currently locked in the dungeons." Luc smirks at me. "Actually, I'm betting she either wants Levi for herself or she's the mastermind behind this entire operation."

I shake my head in disbelief. This had to be a trap, some elaborate deception. A way to lure me back here, though they still hadn't killed me yet. I knew all about tricks—I'd executed plenty myself. After Levi, I'd sworn no one would ever manipulate me again. Someone here was lying, and it definitely wasn't me.

"She took me in." I whisper the words. "She can't be Lycan. She told me her entire story. She showed me proof."

"All part of the act." He shrugs casually. "And you fell for it completely."

"So what if I did? Why do you even care? You could've just told me to get lost."

"Because like you said, you brought her here. Now she's our problem to deal with."

I sit in stunned silence. They had to be wrong. She told me how she escaped. She described everything done to her. She showed me her evidence box—the hospital gown, the empty IV bag. Her detailed escape plan.

"And the villain falls." Lucas laughs as he spins my chair back around to face Alexander.

Alexander watches me with his jaw tight. His crimson eyes lock intensely with mine. I can't read his reaction at all, but the suspense is torturing me.

"Go get Athena." He mutters to Zachary.

I keep my focus on Alexander as Zachary brushes past me. Minutes drag by without anyone speaking. Eventually, two sets of footsteps approach the office behind me.

Athena walks around to the other side of the desk. She sits in the large chair, partially obscured by Alexander's presence.

"I know you don't want to listen to me." I begin.

The single blue eye I can see focuses intently on me. "Everyone leave." Athena commands.

Hands land on my shoulders, making me jump. "Looks like you're getting exactly what you wanted."

I nervously pick at the material on the chair's armrest. My arms remain bound to it, and as my anxiety grows, I desperately need something to occupy my hands. The repetitive picking helps calm my nerves slightly.

The door closes behind the men. Athena says nothing. I'm unsure whether she's waiting for me to speak first or deciding how to handle this situation.

"Could I... could I get some water?" I ask quietly.

"Would you have killed me?" She asks directly.

"Possibly." I whisper the truth. I remind myself to be completely honest now.

"Did you want Alexander too? You wanted to be Alpha—that would mean becoming his mate."

"No. It was never about him. I wanted the Lycans. I wanted our kind to rise, to become superior to the Wolves." I snort derisively. "To be better than Humans."

"Wanted?"

"It was a mistake. I know that now. It just took losing everything for me to finally see it clearly. And I'll keep saying it until you either kill me or believe me."

Claws extend from her fingertips. She flexes her hands and the claws retract. I need to choose my words much more carefully.

"I told Alexander that I had a chance to..."

"I heard. You should have left and taken Evelyn with you."

"You believe Lucas?"

"I was the one who suggested it to him. She reminded me of someone from my past. Always talking, constantly trying to control situations. I'd say you were about three days away from becoming her punching bag. I stopped Luc from killing you so I could get more answers."

"Evelyn isn't... Is she still alive?"

"For now."

"Are you going to kill her?"

"Soon."

I take a deep breath. "Why haven't you killed me yet?"
###Chapter 0381

Athena

Hearing her beg felt strange. There had been a hint of it at her house. Now, desperation saturated her every word. A complete departure from her first arrogant introduction. Perhaps the truth about her friend shocked her. Or maybe she actually meant it.

'We could just kill her.' Nyx suggested with a dark grin. 'She keeps asking. And she was ready to ruin our life. Fair is fair.'

Seraphina dropped her gaze when I remained silent. "I understand. You're torturing me. Withholding the final blow so I live in constant fear, always waiting." She rocked slowly in her chair. "Fear is a bizarre sensation."

"You get used to it." I muttered the lie. You never truly do.

She considered my words. "Julian told me everything that happened to you. Before Alexander—"

"I told you parts of it too. It changed nothing! Knowing my suffering didn't alter your feelings. It didn't change what you thought I deserved. Or what you believed you deserved. Only now, after losing everything, you claim change." She knew it all yet was prepared to destroy me, a half-sister she never cared to know.

Her eyes flicked up to meet mine. "You are the Alpha."

Nyx snorted in disdain. 'She acts oblivious. That was always her goal.'

"I..." She paused for several heartbeats. "It's a bitter truth to accept. But I've learned I'm not that person anymore. Everything hurts. Everything is different. I am changed, though I know you don't believe it."

"You're right. I don't."

She sighed heavily. "Maybe this was always my fate. Payback for the pain I caused. Punishment for Julian. For you. For everything." A hollow laugh escaped her. "There's always someone worse."

They both had said that. Seraphina and Evelyn. "Who told you that?"

"Levi." she muttered. "The night he took me, or after. He was making a point, outsmarting me. Not that it's difficult anymore." Her brows furrowed. "You can link him, right?"

I stared, weighing how much to reveal.

"Because he's a Lycan?" she pressed. "You link all Lycans. I heard your call for everyone to come. So you must link him and Evelyn if she's truly Lycan."

'Don't tell her. She doesn't need to know.' Nyx warned.

"Unless you can't." Seraphina murmured. "But that's impossible. I heard you. Zachary must have. Brianna linked you. My mother and stepfather heard your call."

"I had a connection to Levi. I check everyone who arrives." I revealed, earning a groan from Nyx. "But it's gone. Evelyn's too. Luc thinks they work with a Witch. A powerful one who severed their connection to me."

"Witches don't work with Lycans. They work with Wolves, never Lycans." Seraphina stated. "Look, I'm useless physically now. But I possess knowledge about Lycans. Knowledge you might lack."

"A Witch worked with our father." I countered.

"Don't..." she began, her eyes locking with mine. A small crinkle formed on her forehead. "You were bound as a child."

"Which required a powerful Witch's help because I already had my Lycan. Think, Seraphina. Levi can strip Wolves and Lycans. He gave Wolves something to mask their scent completely. Evelyn concealed her identity."

'Tread carefully.' Nyx cautioned.

'I am.'

"I never saw Witches in the prison. At least, I don't think so. I wouldn't know how to identify one." She shrugged. "But there were women. 'Nurses,' Levi called them. They weren't. They brought food, water, changed IV bags, escorted us to showers. They never spoke. Always looked entranced. Like automatons."
###Chapter 0382

"Wolves and Lycans?"

"I'm not sure. I can't distinguish them anymore. They might be like me, for all I know. People he has punished."

She was cooperating a bit too easily. She could be telling the truth, or she might be stalling. What if Levi had given her something too, allowing her to mask her identity?

'Alexander.' I link him. I knew he was nearby. 'Come take her to the dungeons and bring me Evelyn.'

Alexander appears without a word. He unties Seraphina from the chair but quickly binds her hands again.

"Where are we going? Where are you taking me?" she demands.

"For a walk."

"Are you going to kill me?"

"I suppose you'll find out." He winks at me as he forces her out of the office.

I let out a heavy breath when I'm alone. It never gets easier. The urge to kill her right here is overwhelmingly tempting. The image of cutting her open and watching her intestines spill out is stuck in my head.

'Well?' I mutter to Nyx while we wait.

'I'm as uncertain as you are. She's sharing information, but it could be intentional. We should have kept Luc here.'

'Luc has probably gone to see Hannah.'

"Please don't... please... I've done nothing wrong." Evelyn's voice grates on my ears as Alexander tells her to be quiet.

"Just move." Alexander snaps.

"I've done nothing. Why does no one believe me? I told Athena everything I know. This is cruel."

He pushes the office door open, and her mouth shuts the moment she sees me. Her hands are bound just like Seraphina's, though she looks a bit roughed up, maybe tossed around a little.

He tries to put her in the chair, but she resists. Alexander laughs, pressing both hands on her shoulders and forcing her down. One by one, he ties her wrists to the chair as she snarls at him. Her scent was definitely returning, and still, there's no connection to her.

Her grey eyes lock onto mine. "Why are you doing this? We haven't done anything wrong."

"Haven't you?"

"We came here to warn you about Levi. Why are you treating us like this?"

Was she unaware that we could scent her? She had to be, or she wouldn't keep up this act.

Alexander rolls his eyes at her.

"What did you hope to achieve by telling me about him?"

"That you would take action against him. He can't be allowed to get away with this. We don't deserve this. We don't deserve to lose our Lycans!"

Nyx laughs, 'She really has no idea we can scent her, does she!'

'Maybe not, but if we can scent her, there's a good chance she can shift.' I reply. 'Those ropes won't hold her in that chair.'

"Seraphina showed you where our pack was?"

"Yes. She told me you're her half-sister. I couldn't believe my luck that you're the Alpha. I've been trying to find ways to bring Levi down for years."

"It does sound like you're lucky." The intensity of my desire to kill her grew with each passing second.

"You were hidden for so long." She mutters, avoiding eye contact.

"I wasn't hiding."

"I didn't mean it like that." She shakes her head, trying to get a blonde strand out of her face. "I mean you were kept away for so long, and then this happened to me. I had no way of finding you, not until Seraphina."

"And it just so happened that Seraphina is my half-sister." Hearing myself call Seraphina my half-sister out loud made my skin crawl.

"Right! Pure luck." She smiles.

"Not a setup at all."

I watch the color drain from her face. "I don't know what you're talking about. How could it be a setup? Why would I give up losing my Lycan?"

'She keeps playing the same tune.' Nyx growls.

Alexander watches me from behind Evelyn. Maybe he knew I was seconds away from tearing out her heart. But perhaps we could use her to lure out Levi.
###Chapter 0383
Lucas Adler

Hannah is asleep when I arrive at the hospital.
She’s been drifting in and out for days.
Mostly out.
Theodore insists it’s just her body’s way of healing.
That she needs this.
It still feels wrong.
Waiting this long.
It doesn’t sit right with me.

The others are handling Seraphina and Evelyn.
If they need me, they know where I am.

I take a seat beside Hannah’s head.
Her face is tight.
Like she’s in pain.
Knees pulled to her chest.
Small whimpers escape her lips.
Fingers twitching against the pillow.
But she isn’t in physical pain.
Not now.
Every time she sleeps, she relives it.
All of it.

I’ve gathered pieces.
In the short moments she’s been awake.
Levi took her.
He led her toward the edge of pack territory.
Pinned her down.
She fought.
She wouldn’t have months ago.

He still got the needle in her.
She said her body went heavy.
Control slipped away.
He took her to a building.
Beat her until she was covered in bruises.
They’re still there.
Purple and yellow on her skin.
She doesn’t remember everything.
Says it’s fuzzy.
But he told her it was because he saw her with me.
Said she was broken.
That a Lycan shouldn’t be with a Hunter.
Said he was going to fix her.
That she was being punished.

He chose her.
Not me.
That tells me he’s weaker than he pretends.

He wasn’t wrong about us.
But doing this to her?
It’s disgusting.
I’ve already planned how I’ll skin him alive.
Slowly.
With a very dull blade.

Theodore enters with a new IV bag.
I push the dark thoughts away.
There will be time for that later.

“Still out?” he asks.
He’d never make it as a Hunter.

I gesture toward her.
It’s obvious.

“It’s a good sign,” he says. “Her brain is helping her body heal.”
He switches the fluid bag.
“She just needs time.”

“She’ll never be the same, will she?”
It’s not a question.

“Are you angry with her?”

I shake my head.
I could never be angry with her.
But this never should have happened.

Hannah moans.
She stretches out.

Her hazel eyes open slowly.
Everything comes into focus.
She stares at me.
Sadness and pain fill her gaze.
Her fingers move to her face.
Like they do every time she wakes.
Checking for the stitches.
Making sure it wasn’t a dream.

She winces at the touch.
Eyes grow watery.
“I made it?”

“Yes.”
She asks this every time.
Needing confirmation she’s safe.
It’s her routine now.

She reaches for my hand.
Her fingers curl tightly around mine.
She tugs me toward the bed.
Just like yesterday.

“I’ll leave you to it,” Theodore says.
He takes the empty bag with him.
I settle on the bed beside Hannah.

She buries herself against my chest.
Snuggling as close as she can.
Minutes later, she’s asleep again.
Her chest rises and falls against mine.
A steady rhythm.
Her lips part as her body relaxes.
But her fingers stay locked on me.
Holding me in place.
Keeping me from leaving.

I breathe in her hair.
Hoping for a trace of her jasmine scent.
But there’s nothing.
She smells like any other Human.
###Chapter 0384

I remained by her side for hours.

Simply watching the steady rhythm of her breathing.

Occasionally, her breath would hitch, a soft double intake.

A single tear would escape her right eye.

Always the right.

I gently wiped each one away.

My mind raced, trying to decide my next move.

I had somehow become a Lycan's safe harbor.

If my parents were still alive, they'd be furious.

A quiet knock sounded at the door.

Alexander entered.

Hannah stirred slightly but didn't awaken.

"How is she?" he asked, his voice low.

"Her soul is more fractured than yesterday," I murmured. "She had existing wounds, ones she was already trying to heal."

"You said a bond would shatter her. Is that imminent?"

"If more cracks appear." I ran my fingers through her vibrant red hair. "And I don't know if we can undo the damage that bastard has caused."

He frowned deeply. "I need a favor."

"Another one?" I arched an eyebrow. "I believe I've done plenty for you already."

"Evelyn is being taken to Athena."

"And you're here instead?"

"She requested I not be present."

"What does that have to do with me?" Hannah pressed closer to me in her sleep, and I held her tighter.

"Seraphina is in the dungeons."

"You want me to kill her? I'd be delighted. I've waited a long time for that."

"No." He paused, studying me. "Out of curiosity, why haven't you killed her already?"

"Athena asked me not to."

"I thought you didn't listen to Lycans."

"Normally, I don't. But she has her reasons. Oddly, I respect them. She's different. She sees things others miss. She listens. She doesn't irritate me." I gave him a sharp, sarcastic smile.

"What do you mean, 'she sees things'?"

I shrugged. "It's hard to explain. Maybe it's how she was raised. Maybe finding her true self settled something in her. I don't know. But she's not a monster. I don't feel the urge to put a bullet in her head like I do with the others."

He almost smiled. "Or perhaps you're finally realizing not all Lycans are evil."

I rolled my eyes dramatically.

"Regardless," he continued, "I want you to come to the dungeons with me. I have questions for Seraphina. I need to ensure I don't overlook anything important."

Hannah would likely sleep for a while longer, based on the last few days.

She didn't stir as I carefully slid my arm out from under her.

She was in the deepest sleep I'd ever seen.

I followed Alexander across the pack grounds toward the dungeons.

Seraphina was curled in the corner of a cell, her hands bound.

Her legs were drawn up to her chest.

She looked utterly broken.

A cold satisfaction settled in my chest.

"This is the end, isn't it?" Her brown eyes lifted to meet mine.

The resemblance was still unsettling, though the brown eyes and short black hair set them apart.

"You must be terrified, waiting to die," I muttered.

She squeezed her eyes shut. "I'm ready."

"He's not going to kill you," Alexander stated.

"Yet," I added with a dark smile, though her eyes remained closed.

I watched her throat move as she swallowed.

Her entire body trembled with palpable fear.

She was genuinely afraid for her life.

How interesting.

###Chapter 0386
Seraphina

My heart hammered against my ribs.

Two men loomed over me, their presence dominating the small space. They weren't in the cell with me, yet they filled every inch of it.

Alexander watched me with his unsettling crimson eyes. Lucas spoke, but his words were lost beneath the roaring blood in my ears. I just stared back, trying to decipher the movements of his mouth. Nothing registered.

The harder I tried, the more my head throbbed. My lungs strained for air, working frantically. A panic attack. Evelyn had called it that right before I agreed to have the IV removed from my arm.

Lucas snapped his fingers sharply. "Are you even listening?"

I wanted to say no. I wanted to tell him his words weren't penetrating the fog of fear. But my muscles refused to obey. I was certain I would wet myself if there was anything left in my bladder.

Evelyn said we all have a fight or flight instinct. Only now, without my Lycan, did I truly understand it. But what did it mean when I was frozen, unable to move or speak to the men who put me here?

"Fear." I caught Lucas's final word. Somehow, I had forgotten what he was capable of.

I forced my head down, dragging in ragged breaths. Was this how my victims felt before I killed them? Did everything move in slow motion as they faced death? Or were they just paralyzed by terror?

My eyes burned with unshed tears. I was weak enough already without them seeing me break down. I would have laughed if this was happening to anyone else.

The cell door screeched open. Alexander moved toward me. He grabbed my elbow and yanked me to my feet.

"What... what are you doing?" My voice was a raw croak.

He offered a smile, but it looked strained. Or perhaps it held some hidden meaning. It was pointless to guess. He wouldn't tell me anyway.

A single tear escaped. I wished I could wipe it away unseen, but my hands were still bound. It traced a cold path down my cheek.

Lucas brought a chair into the cell. Alexander forced me onto it. Lucas held a cup to my mouth. Cool liquid teased my lips, but I turned my head away. Poison would mean a slow death without my abilities.

"It's just water," he muttered.

I peered up into his hazel eyes. I couldn't tell if he was lying. I certainly couldn't smell any poison.

My throat was desert-dry. Every swallow felt like shards of glass. I hadn't had a drink in ages. I took a chance.

I sipped. Relief flooded me. The cold water was the best thing I'd tasted in hours. It was far better than that weird juice Evelyn kept forcing on me. She insisted my taste buds needed to adapt. I drank it, but always made a face at the bitter aftertaste.

"I need you to answer some questions," Alexander stated. My eyes flicked to Lucas. "He is merely here to ensure I get the truth from you."

I nodded. I wasn't risking lies. Not now. A strange knot tightened where my stomach should be.

"Let's start with a few trial questions. What is your name?"

"Seraphina Blackwood," I whispered. I saw the look they exchanged. They expected me to say Harrison.

"How many siblings do you have?"

"Thr... Four," I muttered, almost forgetting my new half-sibling. She must be five months old now. "Two half-sisters and two half-brothers," I confirmed.

"How many people have you killed?"

I shrugged.

"An estimate."

I frowned. Keeping count never bothered or interested me. Many did, but I was paid. Counting was pointless. Once the job was done, I moved to the next client. "Maybe a hundred."
###Chapter 0387

“Why did you sell that child to Humans?”

My gaze shifts to Lucas Adler. Back then, I felt no remorse for what I did to his daughter. It was pure retaliation. I had no issue tormenting someone that way. It simply had to be done. Now… Now I see the cruelty. I killed a mother and her unborn pup in the process. She wasn’t the first. I took a child without hesitation and handed her to the vilest beings on Earth. Humans.

“Because I’m a monster.” I whisper. I had become so vicious without ever pausing to reflect until this moment. I nod at both of them. “I deserve death. I just want to know when.”

Alexander glances over his shoulder at Lucas, who gives a slight nod.

“Athena will decide that.” Alexander states. “Though personally, I’d love to let my Wolves hunt you.”

Being torn apart while still alive wasn’t something to anticipate. I started wishing there had been poison in that cup.

Alexander crouches down in front of me. “I want you to extract every bit of information you can from Evelyn.”

I still couldn’t believe she had betrayed me. Everything she said and did seemed genuine. But now, after everything Athena revealed, I see it clearly. Evelyn was nothing but a liar.

“I’ll try.”

“You’ll do more than try. Your life depends on it.” Lucas snarls.

“Right.” I lower my eyes. “And if I don’t?”

“I think you know the answer.” Lucas replies.

“So you’ll kill me if I fail, and you might still kill me even if I succeed.”

“Correct.” Lucas smiles coldly. “Glad we understand each other.”

Alexander unties my hands and pulls a protein bar from his pocket. “Eat. If you’re going to do this, I can’t have you starving.” His tone is empty. I doubt he’d care if I starved. I’m just a pawn in his game. For now, that means I get to live.

He unwraps it and hands it to me. “Move.”

I stand up. He removes the chair from the cell. Lucas swings the door shut and turns the lock. I take a small bite of the bar and stash the rest in my pocket. Who knows when I’ll eat again.

“Wait, what exactly do you want me to find out?”

“Use your brain.” Lucas smirks. “You’ve done this before. It shouldn’t be hard to figure out.”

I’m left in the dark. It’s shocking to realize how blind Humans are without light. Evelyn had let me sleep with a light on for comfort. The night we left, street lamps lit the road. But here, I can barely see my own hand in front of my face.

The dungeon door eventually opens. Rays of sunlight briefly illuminate the space. I see Evelyn before I see Zachary. Her hands are bound, just like mine were. Zachary’s dark eyes find mine and narrow.

He shoves Evelyn into the cell opposite mine. She keeps her head down, but I can see she’s been crying. Fake tears? I’m not sure. I’ve never seen her truly cry.

As he locks her cell, Evelyn slides down the wall to the floor. I still can’t see how she might be a Lycan, but Athena said they can smell her. “Are you okay?” I ask softly once Zachary leaves. He left the light on. Was that for my benefit?

“We have to get out of here, Seraphina! You were right. We never should have come.”

“What did Athena say to you?”

“She asked me about Levi. I told her what I know, but I don’t think she cares. I thought she was supposed to be a great Alpha.”

“I guess she’s just being cautious.” I sigh.

“You weren’t in there as long as I was.” She stares at her lap.

“Maybe she just doesn’t want to listen to me.” I mutter, frowning. “Maybe she thought you might know more. I guess now we just wait.”

“Screw that. I’m finding a way out of here.”
###Chapter 0388
Theodore

I tied my hair back and picked up the clipboard to review the medical inventory. Isabella had always maintained meticulous records, ordering supplies through Alexander whenever stocks ran low. Continuing her system felt like a small way to honor her memory.

Becoming the new pack physician was never my intention. Yet among those Isabella trained, I possessed the most experience. Our growing population of Wolves and Lycans demanded a dedicated doctor.

I checked each item, compiling a list of necessities. Treating Brianna's gunshot wound and now Hannah had depleted our reserves significantly.

The front door creaked open then slammed shut. I peered around the corner but found no one. The air carried no unfamiliar scents. Just the wind, I concluded. Though accustomed to solitude, this place amplified my loneliness.

I collected a fresh IV bag and headed toward Hannah's room. Her bed stood empty.

"Hannah?" I called out, thinking she might have woken and visited the bathroom. "HANNAH?"

Silence answered me. For a moment I wondered if she had stumbled out the front door. Then a faint moan reached my ears.

I yanked the bathroom door open. She startled me badly.

She lay unconscious with her face pressed against the toilet bowl, blood smeared across the porcelain. Rolling her over revealed torn stitches. Luc would murder me if this kept happening. Last time he threatened to remove certain body parts.

I lifted her from the floor and carried her back to bed. After setting up a new IV, I cleaned her wound and restitched her face. Hopefully Luc wouldn't notice.

As I finished, she mumbled Levi's name. The monster who did this to her. Cruelty didn't begin to describe it. I thought forced bonds were horrific. Learning Athena endured four bonds sickened me. But this...no words could describe it. He deserved to rot.

Hannah coughed and rolled onto her side, reaching for the water jug.

"I'll get it." I rushed to prevent her knocking it over.

I filled a cup and inserted a straw. Helping her sit up, she groaned as her deep chestnut eyes met mine. "Where's Luc?" Her voice came out raspy.

"He went to assist Alexander. He'll return soon."

"Am I safe?"

"Yes."

"I made it?"

"Yes."

She nodded and sipped through the straw. She was an unusual person. Or had been. A Lycan who couldn't shift. I hadn't researched her condition yet, but she believed her captors' drugs caused it.

From my recent studies, I suspected otherwise.

Hannah closed her eyes. "I have a message."

"A message?"

"Levi said I am the message."

"You are the message?" I repeated. She gave a faint nod and lazily pushed red hair from her face.

"Where's Luc?" she asked again, her eyes barely open.

"He'll be back soon," I reassured. "Can I get you anything?"

She shook her head weakly. "I ran. I ran as fast as I could." Her fingers twitched. "Why aren't I healing?"

Luc must have told her already. Her memory seemed affected.

"Levi took your Lycan abilities. Remember?"

She frowned, lips parting slightly. She nodded slowly then shook her head.

"You can't heal anymore, Hannah."

"You're wrong." She snapped defensively. "I can heal. I've always healed."

I lifted her arm, showing the purple bruises covering her skin. "You've been here almost four days."

She examined her arm then looked at the other equally bruised limb. "He pinned me down."

She sounded like she was trying to convince herself.
###Chapter 0389

"Zachary discovered you right by the gates." I verify.

Tears escape the corners of her eyes. "You should rest. Alexander and Luc will likely have more questions later."

She lies back, closing her eyes. I exit the room.

I take a seat behind the small nursing station, waiting for Alexander. I had already notified him. When he arrives, Luc is trailing right behind him.

"She spoke to you?" Alexander asks.

"Yes. Though it wasn't much different from her earlier statements. She mentioned having a message, that she is the message. But I suspect her memory is fragmented."

"She is the message?" He questions.

"A warning," Luc mutters darkly. "So he's boasting about how easily he corrupted one Lycan? Showing us he can do it again whenever he wants?" His hazel eyes fix on me. "Is she still awake?"

"No. I should also inform you she left her bed while I was taking inventory. I found her in the bathroom. She had torn her stitches. I've already treated her. She's stable."

"No harm done?" He glares at me. We had a decent rapport until he learned about my past. Now, everything I say or do seems to irritate him.

"She is fine. Theodore has confirmed this," Alexander states, shooting Luc a look. He turns back to me. "How long until we can have a coherent conversation with her?"

"Under normal circumstances, I could estimate. But I've never treated anyone in this condition. It could take days. Or even weeks."

Luc begins pacing, rubbing his temples. "We need more intel on this Levi Bennett character!"

"Do you believe you're the only one considering that?" Alexander retorts sharply.

"Athena can't establish a link to him?" I frown.

"No. Somehow, he has no discernible connection to her," Alexander explains.

"Are we certain he is even a Lycan?" It was a speculative question, but I voice it anyway. I'm piecing things together, and this is one possibility I can formulate.

Both men halt, staring at me.

"Of course he is. I scented him when he was here. Seraphina said she recognized his scent the night he took her," Luc insists.

"But didn't you state that Evelyn completely masked her scent? To the point you believed she was Human?" I counter. He scowls. He dislikes being outmaneuvered; he admitted that himself during our search for answers regarding Athena. I ignore his reaction and continue addressing Alexander. "What if he has perfected a method to deceive the mind entirely? A complete mental trick?"

Alexander nods slowly. "We initially believed Athena was merely a bound Wolf. But she confirmed a pre-existing link to him before these events unfolded. That link is now severed."

"Consider the facts. What do we truly know? We know Levi somehow stripped Hannah's Lycan abilities. And Seraphina's. We know he manipulated Seraphina into believing he was her mate. We know Evelyn concealed her scent so effectively we mistook her for Human. Is she a Lycan or a Wolf?"

"A Lycan."

"Correct. She accomplished something previously thought impossible. Levi likely aided her. So, what prevents him from altering his own scent? Or fabricating a false link for Athena to perceive? I briefly considered Witchcraft. But what if he possesses Witch blood? Or is a potent Witch himself? His fixation on punishing Wolves and Lycans… it aligns disturbingly well."

A grin spreads across Alexander's face. Luc looks like he just swallowed something bitter. Alexander enjoys solving puzzles, seeing beyond the obvious. Perhaps that's the core issue—Luc relies too heavily on his senses instead of his intellect.

Alexander grips my shoulder. "Come with me. I'll summon another nurse to cover here."

"Are you certain? Hannah is still vulnerable."

"I'll remain," Luc grinds out through clenched teeth.

I inform him I recently replaced her IV bag. Only routine monitoring is required now.

He gives a terse nod and vanishes into her room. I have little doubt I've just become his newest object of resentment.
###Chapter 0390
Athena

“That sounds like pure fantasy to me.” I shake my head, struggling to process Theodore’s words.

“There was a time none of us believed in Lycans either.” He gestures toward the window where Lycans are training. Zachary ordered them to intensify their drills—all to protect me. “We’ve learned a great deal since then.”

“He’s right,” Alexander says. “Remember what happened when that first Lycan emerged from the forest, right over there? You hid. We tore it apart because we had no idea what it was.”

'He’s right,' Nyx murmurs.

'How would you know? You weren’t even here!'

'I have access to all your memories,' she huffs.

“So you’re saying he’s a Witch… but he’s not working with one?” I ask. Madame Zora is the only Witch I’ve ever met, and she’s gone now. Nothing like this.

Alexander nods. “Witches vary. They aren’t uniform like Lycans or Wolves—or so I’ve heard. Different strengths. Different abilities. And they’re damn near impossible to find. Some, like Madame Zora, work for Wolves—for a price. Others act like they’re above everyone. No idea why, given how few remain.”

“Seraphina said they don’t work with Lycans, but Evelyn is one.” I’m trying hard to connect the dots, but it feels like a giant piece is still missing. Something none of us can see.

“Did Luc piss off any Witches? Is that why Levi is doing this?” I ask.

“I already asked,” Alexander tells me. “He said he doesn’t deal with Witches. They never interested him… until now.”

“Because of Hannah?”

He nods.

“He’s with her at the hospital right now,” Theodore adds. “She’s slowly becoming more lucid. When she’s ready, we might get more answers.”

I nod, rocking gently. Evrin clings to me like he has all morning. Almost as if he senses something’s wrong. Alexander offers to take him, but Evrin just holds me tighter.

“So he’s a Witch who faked being a Lycan… and he’s strong enough to form a link with me?”

“I know it sounds far-fetched,” Theodore agrees. “But it fits.”

'No,' Nyx mutters. 'No, it fucking doesn’t.'

“What’s our next move?” I ask, keeping my—and Nyx’s—thoughts private.

“We need Evelyn to break,” Alexander says, leaning over the cot to check on a sleeping Logan.

“She didn’t even realize I could scent her,” I reply. “She kept going, spinning her story about what Levi did to her, even as her scent gave her away. I expected her to shift, but she just played the victim—like we were wrong for tying her up.”

“Seraphina will try to get information out of her,” Alexander tells me.

'Why?' Nyx mutters in my head.

“Why would she do that?” I ask.

“I asked her. She feels just as betrayed learning the truth about Evelyn. I don’t think she’s doing it to help us—more to satisfy her own anger at being deceived. She knows she could die either way, and she still agreed.” Alexander’s crimson eyes linger on me.

“I thought you might’ve killed her.”

“I considered it. But with everything happening, I figured we could use her. To do that, we’ll need to feed her. Bring her out once a day so she can report whatever Evelyn is plotting.”

“If we bring her out, we have to bring Evelyn out too. Otherwise, she’ll suspect something,” Theodore adds. “It seems like Levi has some attachment to Evelyn, right?”

“Maybe,” I sigh. “Or it could be the other way around. Luc thinks there’s a good chance Evelyn is running the show.”

I notice how Alexander is looking at me. He’s been wary of Theodore since the car accident, but now, I hope he feels better knowing Theodore shared this intel. He could’ve kept it to himself—just like he could’ve hidden the fact he was born a Hunter. But he didn’t.
###Chapter 0391

I keep rocking gently until Evrin’s tight grip begins to loosen.
He’s finally drifting off after being restless all night.
“So we just wait?” I whisper softly.

Alexander gives a single nod. “Yes. But I’d still rather you stay indoors. I won’t let Levi get near you again.”

I offer a faint smile. “I’ll kill him if he tries.”

“Not if he drugs you first.”

“Let me take him. You’re exhausted.” Alexander carefully lifts a crying Evrin from my arms.
It’s nearly three in the morning, and he hasn’t settled since sunset.
Nothing calmed him.
He’s clingy but rejects touch. He wouldn’t even stay near his twin.
Thankfully, Logan is still asleep in the nursery. We moved Evrin here so he wouldn’t wake.

“Is he sick?” My voice trembles. It’s agony when you can’t comfort your own child.
Worse, because I feel his pain. I just don’t know where it’s coming from.

Alexander shakes his head. “He ate. Diaper was full. No fever.” He paces slowly, cradling our son like a newborn. “I linked Theodore. He’s coming to check.”

“You do think something’s wrong?” I can’t hide the worry.

“No. But you’re worried, so he’ll reassure you.”

He keeps pacing, but Evrin’s cries don’t stop.
When the knock comes, relief washes over me.

Theodore examines Evrin thoroughly, then shakes his head at Alexander.

“There has to be something,” I insist, pulling Evrin close.

“Physically, he’s perfect,” Theodore sighs. “No fever. No joint issues. No swelling. I’m sorry, Athena. It’s not medical. How long has he been crying?”

“Almost six hours,” Alexander replies.

“And he hasn’t cried himself to sleep?” Theodore asks.

Alexander shakes his head, lips pressed thin. He’s worried too.

“What about Luc?” I ask impatiently. “Maybe he can sense something?”

“Find him,” Alexander orders Theodore.

“No need. I’m here.” Luc strolls in wearing only gray joggers. “I was training late. Heard the kid crying for h—”

He stops. Stares at my sobbing son. A frown forms. “He’s the younger twin, right?”

“Yes.”

“Interesting. How old were you when you first shifted?”

“A few days old. But then I was bound.”

Alexander holds up a hand. “You think he’s trying to shift?”

“Exactly.” Luc steps closer. “His bones are trying to break. The crying masks the sound. You remember how painful shifting was after your binding broke? That’s what he feels. Constant pain as his Lycan fights to emerge.” His hazel eyes meet mine. “He’s scared.”

“Scared?” Theodore asks.

Luc nods. “Trying to hold it back.”

“You have to show him, Athena,” Alexander says as Evrin keeps crying. He turns to the others. “Leave us.”

Evrin squirms as I hand him back. I wait for Luc and Theodore to go and start undressing.

'Are we really doing this?' Nyx murmurs.

'I’ll do anything for our son.'

I close my eyes and let my Lycan rise.
Bones crack. Hair sprouts. Claws extend.
I open my eyes, fully transformed, to find Evrin silent. Staring.
Hours of crying finally ceased.

His blue eyes are wide. He leans against Alexander’s chest, propped by his arm.
I expect a scream. Instead, he reaches out. Beckoning.

I step closer. His bones crack.
A soft whimper. Tiny claws appear at his fingertips.
Minutes later, Alexander holds a small black Lycan pup instead of our little boy.
###Chapter 0392
Seraphina

Evelyn paces her cell relentlessly.
Her fingers trace every inch of the cold stone walls.
She searches for weaknesses I know don't exist.
I remain seated, observing quietly.
Perhaps her ignorance of Alexander's influence over Wolves makes her hopeful.
But I knew better.
He would have sealed every possible escape route after Julian revealed how Gabriel escaped.

"There has to be something." she murmurs, more to herself than to me.
She hasn't glanced my way for hours.
Those same words have left her lips countless times since our confinement began.

"Suppose you find an exit." I challenge quietly.
"Do you truly believe you'd evade capture?"

Her hands drop to her sides abruptly.
She turns slowly, her face leveling with mine in the dim light.
The shadows conceal her eyes completely.

"The forest isn't far." she insists.
"I saw when that man brought me back.
No guards were posted."

I find her observation difficult to believe.
Perhaps she missed them during her confrontation with Zachary.
Or maybe she was too distracted yelling at him.

"Evelyn, stop this." I urge gently.
"You're making things worse for us."

"How much worse could it get?"

"Will you say that when they sentence us to the hunt?"

She freezes at my words.
"What does that mean?" she snaps sharply.

"I've been threatened with the hunt before." I explain with a frown.
"That means you'll receive the same sentence."

"The hunt?" she scoffs, resuming her search.
She tests each bar methodically.

"My mate... former mate, told me about Alexander's methods for severe punishments." I continue quietly.
"His wolves hunt the condemned.
They tear them apart while they still breathe."

"Like Rogues?" she questions, pausing momentarily.

She rarely mentioned Rogues before.
I hadn't shared that part of my history with her.

"Essentially." I confirm.
"I don't know if they consume their victims.
Julian never gave me that answer."

"I don't believe it." she shrugs.
"Probably just scare tactics."

"I'm not so certain." I mutter.
I break off a small piece of my protein bar secretly.
The taste is awful, but my hunger outweighs the flavor.

"Even if it's true," she argues, "he wouldn't do that to us.
We're practically Human.
We wouldn't stand a chance."

"I don't think he cares about that." I watch her press against the bars.
She stops suddenly and looks directly at me.
"Do you have food?"

"No." I lie instantly.
Guilt twists inside me, but she's been equally dishonest with me.
Just not about sustenance.

"You're lying." she snarls.
"Share some with me."

"I'm not lying, Evelyn!" I retreat to the farthest corner of my cell.
She must have scented the protein bar.
A Human shouldn't detect such faint odors.
I don't question her though.
I want her to reveal things accidentally.
It always works better that way.

Evelyn shakes the bars violently, as if expecting them to open.
"They should worry about Levi, not us." she mutters while testing different bars.

"Do you think he'll come for Athena?"

"Probably." she answers without hesitation.
"Taking the female Alpha's powers would be quite an achievement."

An achievement?
Strange choice of words.
If she supported Athena, she should express hope against it, not label it an accomplishment.

"Judging by the situation, he'll face significant resistance." I sigh heavily.
"There are many Wolves and Lycans here."

"There really are." she agrees.
"How many do you think?"

I shrug helplessly.
"Alexander's pack is large even without the Lycans.
Athena called everyone.
I have no idea how many responded."

She nods slowly.
"A few hundred?"

"I don't know."

"How many did you see?"

"I wasn't paying attention." I admit.
"I was just hoping I wouldn't die soon."
###Chapter 0393

"You have to stay focused, Seraphina. We won't make it out of here unless you help me."

I give a slow nod. "I'll check later. I haven't slept."

"Fine!" she huffs in frustration. She drops heavily to the floor as I curl into the corner, turning my back to her. It might be a risky move, but she wasn't getting through to me.

I don't know how long I slept before Alexander yanks me off the cold floor. He binds my wrists tightly with rough rope, staying silent while Evelyn watches.

He pushes me toward the stairs. That familiar knot tightens in my stomach. Alexander glares, and I keep my mouth shut. Evelyn begs him to tell her where I'm being taken.

He gives no answer. The lights click off as we leave the dungeon, plunging her into darkness. But she'll still see. She is a Lycan, after all.

I stay quiet as he leads me toward the packhouse. Maybe that means I'm not dying today.

Inside the office, we're alone. He unties the ropes and points to a chair. "Sit."

I obey. He takes the seat behind the desk.

"Did you learn anything?"

"She believes she can escape."

He scoffs. "And?"

"She called it an achievement for Levi if he could strip Athena of her abilities." I shake my head. "I've met all kinds of people, but calling that an achievement is..." Words fail me.

"Like she wants it to happen."

I bite my lower lip and nod.

"Did you ask anything else?"

"You want intel. I can't get that if she suspects me." I drop my gaze. His crimson eyes are unsettling. "She also asked about the numbers in your pack. She already knows we're near the forest."

"Anything more?"

I shake my head and hold out my wrists, expecting to be tied again. But he walks past me to the door. Someone hands him something. The door closes.

"That's a start," he mutters, circling me. "Now eat."

He sets a plate on the desk—a sandwich and water. It looks like the best meal I've ever seen. My stomach rumbles loudly. But is this a trick?

"Is this a reward?" I ask, eyes locked on the food.

"Yes. If you're weak or starve, you're useless. Consider it a contract. You fulfill your end, you get rewarded."

"And what do you do?"

"For now, I let you live."

A power move. He knows he's in control. "I'm not signing anything."

"I don't expect you to." He sits. When I bite my lip again, he tells me to stop. "Verbal agreement works. Your choice."

"Fine." I take a bite. The flavors explode. So much for Evelyn saying I'd have to adjust to new food.

Alexander stays silent as I savor each bite. Who knows when I'll eat again? I finish the water. "She'll be suspicious."

"We're handling it."

"What does that mean?"

"Not your concern. Finished?"

I nod. He reties my wrists. I keep my head down as we return to the dungeons.

He shoves me into the cell and removes the ropes. It's all for show, but I'll take that over a slit throat.
###Chapter 0394
Athena

'He already has his Lycan.' Nyx murmurs, her voice filled with disbelief.
'Yes.'
'What's our next move?'
'Nothing.' I respond firmly. I refuse to bind him like they did to me. This is his true nature. But why Evrin and not Logan? Logan is the firstborn, yet there are no signs of this happening to him.

After shifting back to human form, Evrin collapsed into a deep sleep. Nothing could wake him now. 'Nothing.' Nyx wasn't questioning me, but confirming we shared the same view.

I run my fingers through Evrin's dark hair. He smiles in his sleep. I glance at Logan playing on the floor with his toys. Will he shift too? When will it happen? At thirteen like others?

I know I shouldn't compare my sons, but the questions keep coming. No one here has answers. Not even Luc.

I wonder how my parents reacted when I first shifted. The memory fades as I recall how quickly they bound me. Their disappointment contrasts sharply with my pride in Evrin.

I pick up Logan. "Let's let your brother rest." He needs sleep after last night. Carrying Logan downstairs, I see Alexander escorting Seraphina from his office.

She doesn't notice us, head bowed as Alexander marches her out. Hopefully she gave him useful information.

Logan and I enter the kitchen. Luc is eating breakfast. He waves as I set Logan down with his toys.

"Just the one today?" Luc asks.
"Evrin is sleeping."
"Rough night for him, wasn't it?" He smirks, looking pleased with himself.
"What does it mean?" I demand. "He's not the oldest. Logan should inherit both packs. When Theodore researched me, he said my early abilities came from being the last female Alpha. So why Evrin?"

Luc chews slowly, studying me with narrowed hazel eyes. "I don't have that answer."
"You must know something."
"You'd think so, but I'm drawing blanks. Like you said, he's not the eldest. It doesn't make sense, but it's happening regardless. Following his mother's path."

I nod just as the back door bursts open. Charlotte runs inside, crying hysterically. She doesn't stop, rushing past us toward the stairs. Moments later, we hear her frantic footsteps above.

Luc stands as Zachary enters, furious. He throws Charlotte's bag on the table.
"Why is my daughter crying?" Luc growls at Zachary.
"Maybe because she pinned down another child at school! She should be there now, but I had to pick her up early!"
"Start talking!" Luc demands.
"Like I was the one speaking to her teacher?" Zachary snaps, sitting next to me. "She pinned Liam down."

Luc smirks but stays silent. He shouldn't be proud when we're trying to build something better. "Isn't Liam Caleb's eldest?" I ask.
"Yes." Zachary replies. "We've already had issues with Caleb about Lottie attending that school."
"The bastard should mind his own business." Luc retorts.
"The school is for everyone." I warn him. "There are more Lycan children than Wolves there now." I turn back to Zachary. "Did Charlotte say why she did it?"
"Not exactly. She just said he made her very angry." He points upward. "This isn't like her."

He's right. She never lashes out unless having nightmares. Normally she's calm and friendly. Anger isn't part of her nature.

"I'll speak to the Lycan." Luc offers.
I shake my head. "You will not. I won't leave those three children fatherless."

He smiles at me, almost proud that I guessed his intentions.
###Chapter 0395
"Go be with your daughter." Zachary mutters. "You're always training, working, or with Hannah."

"Are you saying I'm neglecting my child?!" Luc's nostrils flare as he slams his hands on the table, visibly restraining himself.

Zachary glares back, confirming the accusation.

"Enough!" I snap. "This pack has enough issues without you two constantly fighting! Sort it out now!" They both fall silent. Seems Evrin isn't the only one pushed to his limits.

"I'm going to talk to my daughter and get the full story!" Luc snaps, storming out of the kitchen.

Zachary opens his mouth to speak, but I shoot him a warning look.

"Did she hurt him?" I ask once Luc is out of earshot.

"Not exactly."

"What does that mean?"

"She launched herself across the room at him. Used a chair to pin him down and threatened, 'My dad will kill your dad.' The teacher wants her home for a few days. She's asking Caleb to do the same with Liam."

"My dad will kill your dad? Was she referring to you or Luc?"

"I think we both know the answer. Not sure if Liam provoked her or if she's just having a rough day. No nightmares last night, even with Evrin crying constantly." His eyes shift to Logan. "Where is he, anyway?"

"Asleep." He doesn't know yet. I take a deep breath. "He shifted."

He blinks several times. "Sorry, what?"

"Evrin shifted. He was crying because his body was trying to shift and he was fighting it. I showed him my Lycan form, and he shifted. A beautiful little black Lycan. And Alexander hasn't spoken to me since."

"Trouble never comes alone, does it?"

I shake my head. Problems never arrive one at a time, not in this life.

****noveldrama

"I'm sure it's nothing." Brianna tells me, cradling Luca. "He might just be in shock."

"He encouraged me to show Evrin. Now he's been avoiding me all day. I've linked him, and he keeps saying he has other things to do. It's not like him."

"As a bitten Lycan, remind me, how old are you when you first shift?"

"Around thirteen."

"Maybe that's it. He thought he had at least twelve more years to prepare. Alexander adores you, and I doubt anything scares him. But maybe this part of fatherhood does because it's beyond his control."

"I hope you're right." I mutter. "Maybe this will slow him down on wanting another."

"Another pup?"

"Yes. And before you get any ideas, I'm not pregnant."

She presses her lips together and raises a brow, turning away. "Do you ever wonder if the next one will be a Wolf like Alexander? That would be interesting, wouldn't it? Siblings that are a mix of Wolves and Lycans. Or one that's a blend of both. Is that even possible?"

"Who knows?" I tuck my legs under me. "Has Sebastian told you what's been happening?"

She nods.

"You knew Victoria quite well. Did she use Witches? I mean, she must have—her and Dominic had me bound. What I'm asking is, did you ever meet any?"

"No. She rarely let me meet anyone. After running away, the older I got, the more I realized how wrong everything was. I was too blind to see it. I should have challenged them more when I learned about you. I should have recognized all the red flags instead of just accepting it."

She takes a deep breath. "I never encountered a Witch. Victoria and the others never mentioned one. We didn't even come across any when we lived with the Rogues."

I can see my mention of Victoria bothers her. Sebastian told Alexander she still carries guilt from the past and what she did to me. We never discuss it. It's like a dirty secret between us, though everyone else knows.

I haven't verbally forgiven her, but in my mind, I did long ago. She's become part of this family, my only female friend, and I can't imagine life without her.

She thinks she's being subtle, wiping away a tear as she kisses Luca's head.

"I forgive you."
###Chapter 0396
Brianna

My mind is reeling.

Athena watches me intently. She isn't waiting for a response. She's studying how I absorb her words.

My mouth opens and closes. Words fail me. If I hadn't been holding Luca, I would have dropped anything in my hands.

Forgiveness was something I never anticipated. Never. She made that brutally clear the day she finally let me speak.

I clear my throat, hoping my brain connects to my voice. "You do?"

She nods slowly.

"Why now?" I feel fresh tears welling up.

"You've changed. I've changed. We've both traveled difficult paths." She shrugs like it's nothing. "The person you were back then only cared about herself." A faint smile touches her lips. "I killed the man who shot you because I was furious. I thought I'd lost you too."

I never considered that perspective. She never mentioned it. Luc told me the guy was aiming for Athena. That's why I assumed she killed him. Not because he hurt me.

"I can't express what hearing that means to me." I whisper, grappling with this sudden relief. I hadn't realized how much guilt I was carrying. I grew so accustomed to its weight that its absence feels strange. But good.

"It's ironic." Athena shifts her gaze to the window. "I never imagined seeing you again. I certainly didn't think we'd live in the same pack." "Or that you'd outrank me. Significantly." I add, seeing her lips curve upward.

"Raven was my first friend. Even if she were alive, I doubt we'd be as close as you and I have become."

"She cared about you." I offer.

"For a time. But then... Anyway, do you accept?"

"Absolutely yes!" My outburst startles Luca, making him cry as Athena laughs.

I spend a few more hours with Athena. She contemplates Alexander's reaction to Evrin shifting. I'm sure it was just the shock of the unexpected. In the moment, he was probably excited. Then reality hit. Protecting him just became harder. Some people won't like it.

Leaving the house, I find Charlotte hidden behind a bush. Her back presses against the side wall, concealed from view.

She's doodling on a piece of paper. Discarded food wrappers suggest she's been here awhile.

I slip behind the bushes. She stares at me with wide green eyes, expecting a scolding.

"Charlotte?" I say softly. "Why are you hiding behind the bush?"

"I don't want my Dads to find me."

I lower Luca and sit, my knees touching hers. "You know they can smell you, right?"

"I didn't think of that." Her shoulders slump. Her bottom lip protrudes. "They're mad at me."

"Because of what happened at school?" It's the only logical reason.

She nods. Her bottom lip trembles further.

"Did something make you angry?"

She doesn't answer. She refuses to meet my eyes.

"Everyone gets angry." I tell her. "Lots of things trigger anger. You know what I've learned over the years?"

She shakes her head.

"It's always better to talk about it."

"But they'll be angrier."

"Maybe. But if we don't know why you're upset, we can't help." I hope she finds it easier talking to someone other than her Dads.

"He said I was different. That something is wrong with me."

"Liam?"

She nods. I notice how hard she's pressing the pencil into the paper. "I'm not bad. I help Athena. He called me poison. I don't even know what that means. Then he said... He said someone would kill me in my sleep because I deserve it."
###Chapter 0397

Her small fingers gripped the pencil so tightly it snapped in two.

"But I'm not the bad one."

"You think Liam is bad?"

She nodded vigorously, her braids swinging with the motion.

"Not yet. But he will be."

It seemed impossible to predict a child's future behavior at such a young age. They hadn't even begun to experience life properly.

"Have you talked to either of your fathers about this?"

"Daddy Zachary got angry. Daddy didn't listen. I had to stop Liam, Brianna. Everything he said hurt me deeply. He's mean, but only to me." She smiled softly at Luca sleeping in my arms. "Can't I just stay here with Logan and Evrin? They actually like me."

"That decision isn't mine to make. School is important though. Have you made any friends there?"

"One girl talks to me. Her name is Ava."

"She's a Wolf?"

"Uh huh. She's the one who told me to stand up for myself. So I did."

"I need you to do something for me."

Her green eyes studied me with uncertainty.

"When you return to school, if anything happens, tell your teacher immediately. I don't want you doing anything that could get you in trouble."

"That's what Daddy Zachary said."

"Because he's right." Though if she had asked my younger self, I probably would have advised her to fight back against Liam.

She pouted, a tiny crease forming between her brows. "I can't wait to be grown up."

I laughed softly. "Come on, you can stay with me and Luca. One of your fathers can pick you up later."

"Are you going to tell them?"

"I think you should tell them yourself, but I'll be there with you when you do."

Zachary and Alexander arrived late that evening. I hadn't expected both of them, but perhaps I could reason with them together.

"Charlotte is asleep. She can stay overnight. We need to talk." I wanted Charlotte to explain herself, but I couldn't wake her after finally convincing her to sleep. She was absolutely convinced Liam would harm her and I wouldn't notice.

"Did she say anything?" Zachary muttered as he sat at my small dining table.

I recounted my entire conversation with Charlotte.

"He called her poison?!" Alexander asked with clear disgust.

"She said she doesn't even know what that means, so she likely didn't make it up. I don't know if it's because she's a Hunter by birthright or if something else is happening, but..."

"I'll handle it," Alexander stated firmly. "She's part of this pack whether they like it or not."

"That won't ease her mind. That girl cried herself to sleep tonight. She's probably back to square one emotionally." Right on cue, she began crying upstairs.

"I'm taking her home. Maybe her own bed will help." Zachary frowned and disappeared up the stairs to find her.

I sighed and looked at Alexander. "You haven't said anything about Evrin."

"Athena told you?"

I nodded, aware I was entering dangerous territory by challenging him. "Is that why you haven't spent time with them today? Why you've been making excuses about going home? Because he can shift?"

I didn't wait for his answer.

"She's sad, and I know you feel her sadness. She thinks you're disgusted that Evrin can shift."

"Not true."

"But you came here with Zachary when you didn't need to. You could have gone home to her. Home to your boys."

Alexander shook his head. "I've been on duty. I don't want news about Evrin getting out."

"That's why you've been avoiding going home?"

"No. I don't want Levi finding out my son can shift. I've been working all day, chasing leads, looking for problems within my pack. Shutting down anyone who thinks they know something."

"You're worried?"

"Wouldn't you be if Luca started shifting? I'm not worried about who Evrin is. I'm worried about the assholes who might try to take advantage of it."

"Then you should tell Athena before she spontaneously combusts from all the thoughts swirling in her head."
###Chapter 0398
Alexander

The pack house stood silent.
No noise came from Athena or the twins.
Zachary must have settled Charlotte because I couldn't hear them either.

I followed Athena's lavender scent upward.
She sat in the attic surrounded by baby items.
Her tired blue eyes lifted to meet mine.
She released a heavy sigh but remained silent, continuing to fold tiny clothes.

"I'm not upset." I stepped further into the light. "I needed to make arrangements to protect him. To protect them both. If Evrin can shift, Logan won't be far behind. I must ensure no one tries to take advantage."

"Okay."

She wasn't speaking her true feelings.
I didn't need to read her mind to know that.

'She's furious.' Titan murmured.

'I can see that.'

I sat on a storage box, feeling it dip under my weight. "I wasn't running from this. That's not who I am."

"Okay."

I hated her one-word responses.
I thought we had moved past this.

"Athena?" My voice dropped lower.
She stopped folding clothes.
Her shoulders slumped as another sigh escaped her lips.

"I can't remember it clearly, but I imagine what Evrin saw when you handed him back... was exactly what I saw during my first shift. A smile that vanished instantly. That urgent need to get away."

"You're comparing me to your father?"

"Not him specifically, but his reaction. They bound me because I shifted early. They tried to abandon me when that failed. When they still couldn't get rid of me, they bound me again. And you... you just handed him to me and walked away. All day you've ignored us. Made excuses not to come home."

'You've triggered her trauma.' Titan whispered, as if Athena could hear him.

I moved toward her as her pain intensified.
She pulled back, tears tracing down her cheeks which she hastily wiped away.

"I didn't expect-"

"Neither did I! But you don't see me running from our sons!" She snapped, her voice sharp.

"I didn't run away."

"You've been gone all day." The tears stopped, replaced by pure anger.

"I was ensuring Theodore hadn't told anyone. Luc knows to keep quiet but we both know Theodore talks too much. He overshares. This would be exciting news to him. He'd think it's wonderful to tell the pack. I only want the pack to know when you're ready. I want to keep the boys safe. I don't want them becoming new targets for Levi. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left like that without explaining."

I felt terrible, and Titan confirmed I should.

I always insisted Athena never keep secrets from me.
Yet I had done exactly that.
And I was still withholding something.
But she wasn't in the right mindset to hear it. Not yet.

"I assume the twins are asleep."

She nodded, wiping another tear away.
I hated being the cause of her pain, but loved her fierce protectiveness toward our boys. I hoped that part of her never changed.

"Has Logan shifted?" I asked quietly, taking another step toward her.

"No." She sealed the box she had finished organizing. "Evrin hasn't either. He's been sleeping mostly."

"Have you slept?"

She shook her head.
I extended my hand.
Reluctantly, she took it, allowing me to pull her to her feet.
We descended to our bedroom where she collapsed onto the bed without undressing.
She didn't stir as I removed her boots and jeans.

I stripped down and climbed into bed, drawing her against me.
She was deeply asleep, yet her body instinctively pressed against mine, just as it did every night.

'You didn't tell her!' Titan muttered.

'I will. In the morning.'

'It won't go well.'

'I know. But there's no good way to tell her one of our pack members is missing.'
###Chapter 0399

She has to be told.

But not now. She needs rest first. Telling her while she's exhausted won't help.

I look down at my mate's face resting against my chest. She looks so peaceful. That peace is about to shatter.

When I wake, she's still deeply asleep. She's stripped off her remaining clothes and lies on her stomach, the blanket barely covering her. I wish I could stay, but the boys are stirring in the nursery.

I dress quickly and head to the nursery. Both boys are wide awake and standing in their cots. They're happy to see me, but I notice Evrin glancing at the door, searching for his mother.

It was easier to get them ready before they learned to walk and squirm away. Now it feels like wrestling two octopuses every morning.

I take them downstairs. Zachary is already waiting. "Lottie is having breakfast. Did you tell Athena?"

I shake my head. "She was exhausted last night. Telling her wouldn't have helped. She'll have a clear head when she wakes. Though he isn't a Lycan, so she probably can't do anything anyway."

He nods and takes a wriggling Logan from me, making faces at him. "You're sure he didn't just leave?"

"Positive. I can't sense him at all. It's like he vanished from the face of the Earth."

"I know I asked already, but do you think Luc..."

"No." I cut him off. "I know Luc has issues, but I don't believe he'd do this. Besides, he doesn't have the ability to take away someone else's powers. Only one person we know can do that."

"But why Theodore?" Zachary questions. "Theodore never steps out of line. From what we learned from Seraphina and Hannah, Levi punishes those who are 'bad'. Theodore isn't like that."

"I know. That's what makes it so frustrating."

We take the boys to the kitchen for breakfast. Charlotte runs past us quickly.

"You don't think he did something like those Wolves who attacked Athena and Luc, do you?"

"If you asked me a few days ago, that's exactly what I'd think. But Theodore has been part of this pack for a long time. He's helped in many ways. He wouldn't just turn his back."

"I hope you're right."

Luc walks past the window with Hannah following. A deep frown is plastered on his face while she looks like she's about to cry. Unexpectedly, he knocks instead of barging in like usual. Even Zachary raises an eyebrow at me.

I open the back door. Luc's fingers are tightly coiled around Hannah's wrist.

"Tell them!" Luc orders.

I watch her tremble. "Should you be out of the hospital?"

Her eyes move to Luc. "I don't even know if it was real."

"If what was real?" Zachary ushers her to a chair, much to Luc's annoyance.

"I think... I think Levi was in the hospital."

"When?" I demand.

"I'm not sure. I was tired. In and out of sleep." Her fingers run over her neck. "I don't know if I was dreaming or if it was real." Her chestnut eyes move between all of us. "I heard voices. Angry voices but quiet, like a whispered argument."

"Who?"

"Levi and Theodore." Luc glares at me.

"Theodore was helping Levi?" Zachary asks, disgusted by the idea after I just said he wouldn't betray us.

Hannah shakes her head at me, keeping her gaze low. "He offered to go with Levi if Levi promised to leave everyone alone."

"Why are you only telling us now?"

"Because yesterday, she was mostly asleep again. I think the bastard drugged her." Luc seethes.

I glance at the door leading to the bottom of the stairs. "Shit!" I hadn't been paying attention to my mate's movements. As I move to the door and pull it open, I find Athena standing on the other side.

"Theodore is gone?"
###Chapter 0400
Theodore

I stared up at him. "Why are you doing this?"

He paced back and forth across the small room. My head still felt heavy. But it reminded me of my childhood. When my parents would tie me up. I just felt weaker now. It was manageable.

"Do you always talk this much?" His voice was a low growl. He kept glancing out the window of the old cabin. Like he expected someone to follow us. No one knew I had left. But they would figure it out soon.

"Usually. That's my reputation in Obsidian Howl. I crave knowledge. My entire house is stacked with books." I twisted my bound hands. Trying to create some slack. The rope burned my skin with every movement.

"Alright then, Mr. Knowledge. Tell me how to get Seraphina and Evelyn out of the dungeons."

"You can't. They're heavily guarded. They'll spot you from every angle. You'd be a fool to think Alexander only posted one guard. Why do you even want them back? They're useless to you now."

"They didn't see me coming to the hospital, did they?" He smirked, ignoring my question.

"Because it wasn't a priority."

He ran a hand through his short blonde hair. "You're going to help me get them back."

"The deal was that if I came with you, you wouldn't harm anyone inside the pack."

"They aren't part of the pack."

I laughed. "Inside the pack. That was the agreement. I've read enough contracts to know the exact wording!"

He crouched down in front of me. His sage green eyes studied me intently. "You love that pack. Why?"

"It's my family."

He laughed and shook his head. "There are plenty of bad people in Obsidian Howl."

"And you're not bad? You strip people of their abilities. To me, that's evil." My neck still ached where he had injected me. I fought desperately against the drowsiness. But sleep was pulling me under. I needed to get as much information from him as possible. I would find a way to get it to Alexander or the others.

"No Theodore, I'm fixing everything that's wrong." He stated firmly.

"According to who? You? Why do you get to decide what's right and wrong?"

His fingers gripped my cheeks. He squeezed hard enough to cause pain. "Someone has to. Now get some sleep. We have a big day tomorrow."

He left the room. He watched me as he quietly closed the door. Within seconds, my eyelids became too heavy to keep open.

"Wakey wakey, sleeping beauty." He nudged my legs with his boot.

Groaning, I pushed myself up until I was sitting against the wall. "Here, eat."

He placed an apple in my hands. "I don't need you starving."

I took a bite as he watched me. "I assume you didn't tell them. Is that why you came so easily?"

"Tell them what?"

“Oh, you know exactly what I'm talking about." He squatted and wiped some apple juice from my chin.

I took another bite. I refused to say anything.

"Just so you're aware, what I drugged you with isn't permanent like Hannah's or Seraphina's. In a couple of days, you'll be able to scent me again. Though I'm hoping I can convince you not to reject me.”

The blue flecks in his sage green eyes seemed brighter. Full of hope. Like he was completely convinced I would join him. Just because he happened to be my mate. "Maybe I can convince you not to be a jerk!"

He smiled at me. He pulled a bottle of water from inside his jacket. "As much as you think I'm a jerk, I'd rather you didn't die on my watch." “But you'll gladly ruin the lives of others." My eyes moved to the bottle. But I didn't pick it up.
###Chapter 0401

"You don't trust me, do you?" He questions, his voice low.

"Trust isn't something you've earned."

He takes a long drink from the bottle before setting it down in front of me. "There. Now drink. We need to get moving soon."

He moves toward the window, scanning the area outside. I knew we were still in the woods, but not the territory of Obsidian Howl. There were no abandoned cabins here.

"Is Evelyn the Witch?" I ask. It couldn't be her if I was mated to Alexander.

"No. I am. Well, half Witch. Though I must say, I'm particularly proud of how powerful I've become." He turns back to face me. "Evelyn is the only one who knows that about me, and now you. Clearly my Lycan side has connected with yours. Even more amusing considering you're a Wolf." He lets out a low growl. "Did you think your Witch side was stronger than your Lycan side?"

"I did, until I stumbled upon you. You caught my scent when I was hiding in the pack as Owen Carter."

"Only briefly. I thought my mind was playing tricks on me. I picked up your scent and then, within seconds, it vanished completely."

"I had to keep myself hidden while I investigated the pack. I couldn't let you ruin my plans, could I?" He flashes me a wide grin.

"That's how you severed the link to Athena? Because you can conceal your true nature?"

"Exactly."

"She will kill you for this."

"I'm sure she'll try. But will she end up killing you in the process?"

He does one final check outside and pulls me to my feet. He ushers me out into the forest. Even in the darkness, birds were already singing, signaling the approaching dawn. I don't resist Levi. There was no point. He had the upper hand. So I walk, letting him guide me through the trees until I recognize the location where Alexander had asked me to bring clothes for Athena.

"Where are we going?"

"Well, since my little escapee has abandoned her house, I thought we could spend a few hours there. You know, close by but not too far. Get some proper rest instead of that miserable cabin."

"You don't think they'll search here?"

"Why would they? Seraphina and Evelyn are securely locked away. But right now, I'm more interested in you. You haven't complained once about losing your Wolf. Why?"

I simply shrug and continue walking.

"Now you stop talking!" He mutters in annoyance. "And I was just starting to like you."

I remain quiet for a while before asking the question that's been bothering me. "Why Seraphina and not Hannah?"

"Hannah is weak. I have no use for her. She's a waste of resources. Though I must admit, I'm impressed she made it back to the pack." He said nothing about Evelyn.

"So tell me Theodore," his husky voice sends shivers through me. "Why are you so calm? I could slit your throat right now. I could plunge my lovely little blade into your chest and tear your insides out. I could force you to shift, skin you, and make a nice winter coat from your hide."

I glance over my shoulder. "Because you need me. That's why you agreed to leave everyone alone if I came with you. What is Evelyn to you?"

"A pain in my fucking ass." He stops me abruptly. "Don't you see the resemblance?"

"Can't say I've really looked at her. I've been busy trying to help Hannah."

"She's my sister. Same father, different mother."

I laugh, and he glares at me. "What the fuck is so funny about that?"

"One of the guys thought Evelyn had a thing for you."

"Ew, don't be so fucking disgusting." He shakes his head in distaste. "How long did it take for them to figure out Evelyn was working with me?"

I considered lying. Telling him that only I had figured it out. But it wouldn't achieve anything. It might help if he thinks she's about to be slaughtered.

"Since she arrived."

"So why are they keeping her alive?"
###Chapter 0402
Seraphina

A cold shudder races down my spine as Lucas Adler steps into the dungeon. He was the absolute last person I ever wanted to see.

He slowly drags the barrel of his gun along the iron bars of my cell. Each bar produces a harsh, metallic clunk that vibrates right through my bones.

In the cell across from mine, I watch Evelyn shuffle backward into the shadows, darkness swallowing her form. But her quiet, choked sobs betray her location. "Relax, baldy. I'm not here for you." He spins toward Evelyn's cell and repeats the motion, scraping his weapon against the bars while chuckling lowly. "It's your turn, princess."

"No." Evelyn whimpers. "I haven't done anything wrong."

"We just have a few more questions. Answer them correctly, and you can return here to rest that pretty little head of yours."

"I've told you everything I know!" Her voice sharpens with frustration.

"Evelyn, just answer them. You're making this worse for all of us." I mutter under my breath. Lucas glances over his shoulder and winks at me. Wanting the truth and wanting to survive didn't mean we were allies.

Half of Evelyn's face emerges from the shadows, the rest still cloaked in darkness. Tear tracks stained her cheeks. I'd listened to her cry all night long. The sobbing would stop, then start again, a relentless cycle that made me wish for deafness. It felt like a crueler torture than starvation. Until I noticed each sob sounded off. Forced. Exaggerated. I doubt it was for my benefit; she was probably hoping to lure a guard down. Even now, with just one grey eye visible, I saw pure anger, not sorrow. Nothing was going according to her plan.

I might not have caught on if I hadn't been forced to observe her for so long. Time was all I had left.

Being Human came with massive disadvantages, but it did force you to truly learn about those you were trapped with, if you paid close enough attention.

"Does Alexander want to speak with me?" She asks, her voice barely a whisper.

"No, not today. Today is for my entertainment." Lucas flashes her a wide, unnerving grin. He's a complete madman, and I still can't figure out how a Hunter like him ended up embedded here. Hunters are supposed to work alone.

He unlocks her cell door and seizes her by the throat, yanking her resisting body close to his. "Don't try anything stupid. I have zero tolerance for idiocy today. Understood?"

"Yes." She rasps out.

I see it then—real, raw panic floods her features. And she absolutely should be panicked.

Minutes after they leave, heavy footsteps echo on the stone stairs. I retreat to the farthest corner of my cell and wait. Is this it? Has Alexander finally grown tired of waiting and decided to execute us? That would be the only reason both of us are being taken from our cells.

My lungs constrict painfully. I struggle to draw air. Strange black dots swarm my vision. My chest aches fiercely, and I slide down the cold wall, my legs giving out.

"Shit, kid. Breathe."

Caleb's large, familiar hands grip the bars of my cell. His intense blue eyes are wide with alarm as he scans my crumpled form.

"What... what are you doing down here?"

"Your mother is asking questions. I told her if I got permission, I'd come check on you. See how you're holding up."

The black spots gradually recede. I drag a deep, shaky breath into my lungs. I never want to experience that suffocating fear again.

"Just fantastic." I mutter bitterly. "Why didn't she come herself?"

"The pup is being fussy today."

"You didn't need to come."

"Yes, I did. Because I love your mother." He walks away, grabs a lone stool from the dungeon's far end, and sets it directly in front of my cell. "Sometimes, we do things for the people we love, no matter how pointless it seems. How did you end up in this mess, Seraphina?"

"Let's recap. I embarked on a solo mission to reclaim what was rightfully mine. It failed spectacularly. I met someone, let him mark me, and was a complete bitch to him in return. Ended up trapped for months by a man who believes he's a god. My total lack of Lycan abilities made me trust the wrong person, which landed me right back here. Now I'm a prisoner awaiting my execution date."

His forehead creases into a deep frown. "Do you regret any of it?"

I drop my head and let out a bitter snort. "Does it look like I'm enjoying this?"

He rolls his eyes and sits up taller, crossing his muscular arms over his chest. "I was convinced Alpha Athena would have us all eliminated, simply because of who you are and what you did. But she didn't. She gave us a chance. Your mother and your brothers are thriving here. Your little sister will too."

"And what does that have to do with me?"

"You could thrive here too, Seraphina. You could leave the past behind and start over."

"So we can all be one big, happy family, is that it?" I mock.

He stands up abruptly, shaking his head in clear disappointment. "I knew this was a mistake. You're an ungrateful brat. You won't even accept the help being offered to you."

"What help? You mean reminding me that my mother moved on and had more children to replace me?"

"You know that's not what I meant, and you know it's not true. For once in your life, pull your head out of your ass and look at the bigger picture."

"You can leave now." I dig into my pocket, searching for the last remaining piece of my protein bar. My fingers find only crumbs. It must have shattered when I collapsed on the floor.
###Chapter 0403

"We're doing our best, Seraphina. We want to build a life here. The Wolves aren't bad people—well, maybe a few exceptions, but most are content with how things are run. The boys attend school. Your mother helps at the bakery when she isn't caring for Braelyn. Alpha Alexander allows me to work at the gate now."

"Braelyn?"

"Your sister." He smiles faintly.

"Can I meet her?"

He shakes his head. "Not while you're down here. Not until you're no longer considered a threat."

"A threat? I can't smell anything but my own filth. I can't hear anything beyond your voice. I can't heal. I nearly passed out earlier. My stomach feels strange and hollow. Yet you think I'm dangerous."

"Then prove everyone wrong."

He turns to leave, then pauses. He pulls an apple from his jacket and sets it just inside the bars. "Here. It isn't much, but I could hear your stomach growling from the top of the stairs. If you want a chance, Seraphina, do everything they ask."

He didn’t know I already had a task.

"What if it isn't enough?"

"Then I suppose you didn't try hard enough."

I stare at the apple for a long time. Caleb had no reason to be kind. No reason to advise me. If anything, I thought he’d be glad I was facing execution.

I take the apple and retreat into the shadows. I don't eat it. I roll it between my fingers, thinking. How can I get something useful from Evelyn?

Time moves strangely here. It's always dark unless a light is left on. I only know day from night when one of us is taken out. So I have no idea how much time passes before Evelyn returns.

She’s crying—really crying—as Lucas shoves her down the stairs. This time, it sounds genuine. When she comes into view, my jaw drops. He’s shaved her head completely bald. She’s even balder than I am.

Strands of her long blonde hair cling to her dirty sweatshirt. Lucas pushes her into the cell, and she rushes to her dark corner.

"Maybe next time you won't lie," he sneers, turning away without a glance at me.

"Evelyn?" I whisper once the door closes.

Her sobs echo. "He shaved my head. He took everything."

"Why?"

"He said I was lying. Hiding things. He did it to punish me."

"It'll grow back." I repeat what she always told me when I ran my hands over my own fuzz. "He's cruel."

"He's punishing us. He can't shave my hair—it's already gone."

"Do... do you have any food?" she whispers.

I look at the apple. She can smell it, just like the protein bar. If I keep hiding what I have, she might grow suspicious. Stop talking to me. That would sign my death warrant.

"My stepfather visited. He brought an apple. Do you want it?"

"An apple?"

I nod and step into the light to show her. "I can roll it over."

"Thank you. You don't know what this means. My stomach hurts so much."

I take a small bite, then slip it through the bars. I push it hard enough to reach her.

She devours it in seconds. Foolish girl. She should have made it last.

"What did he ask you?" I need to know everything.

"He wanted to know if there was anyone else."

"Anyone else? Like others who were made Human?"

She hesitates. "He thinks I'm working with Levi. They all do. Nothing I say changes their minds. You have to tell them they're wrong!"

"Did you tell them they're wrong?"

"Of course. But that man—he just stared. Then he asked about a girl named Hannah."

"Hannah?"

"I've never met anyone by that name. Levi never—"

"Never what?" My knuckles whiten as I grip the bars.

"He never brought anyone to the prison named Hannah."

"Did you meet the other prisoners?"

"A couple."

That isn't what she told me before. She'd described a story like mine—locked up nearly all day.

"This isn't much different, is it?" I gesture at the walls. "Though I can't believe you killed someone in the library. That couldn't have been easy."

"It wasn't. But I did it." She sounds proud.

Isn't it amazing how easily Evelyn slips up when she thinks someone's on her side? She told me she killed someone in the bathroom to escape. Not the damn library. I don't even know if the prison had a library.

But it's becoming clearer and clearer how much of her story is bullshit.
###Chapter 0404
Lucas

Hannah was utterly useless.
How could anyone be that stupid to play games with us?
If she had just stopped crying for a single moment, I might have gotten something useful.
Still, I enjoyed shaving her head while she screamed.
If she wouldn't talk, I would keep going until she broke.

I pushed the door open and found Hannah sitting up in bed reading.
Alexander had insisted she remain in the house due to her condition.
We argued, but his authority overruled mine.

The room was small and sparsely furnished.
Just a bed, a wardrobe, and a dresser.
She used the bathroom down the hall.

"I assume things didn't go well with that woman from the dungeon?" Hannah asked, setting her book aside.
"I never said who I was meeting."

She pointed toward the window and rolled her eyes.
"The power of sight is remarkable."

She seemed more like herself, though she kept rubbing one spot on her neck.
Her attitude today was starting to irritate me.

"No, it didn't go well. She was a sobbing mess."
"So you shaved her head?" Her chestnut eyes met mine. "I saw her leave."
"She deserved to experience what she'd done to others."

Hannah nodded but kept her lips pressed together.
"You disagree?"

"I didn't say that." She muttered, picking up her book and flipping through pages, clearly ignoring me.
"You didn't need to. Your face says everything."

She slammed the book shut.
"Have you considered that cruelty isn't the best way to get information? Especially from someone in denial."
She kept her eyes on the book.
"I listened from the stairs while you terrorized her."

She exaggeratedly reopened the book and propped it on her knees, reading as if I weren't there.

"Hannah..."
"I know. This is what you do. You're a Hunter created to kill Lycans."
"Only now it bothers you?" I smirked, and she glared.

"Why are you here?" She fired back.
"You made it clear our bond is gone. Alexander wants me here until he figures things out since Theodore isn't at the hospital."
"You don't need to watch me anymore."

"Han..."
"I'm fine." She shrugged.
"I understand. You couldn't ignore the mate bond before, but now you don't feel it. Levi solved your problem. You can forget I ever existed."

I watched as another crack formed in her soul.
Her exterior seemed fine, but her soul told a different story.
Those cracks were multiplying.
One or two in the right place, and she would shatter.

"You're right. I thought it was the bond, but I couldn't get you out of my head. That hasn't changed. That's why I'm here."

Her eyes widened at my unexpected response.

"I spent hours in that hospital trying to understand why I couldn't leave.
I watched you twist from night terrors, wondering how to make them stop.
I thought of all the ways I'd make Levi suffer for what he did to you."

"I've watched your soul crack repeatedly, waiting for those cracks to meet, knowing they'll tear you apart.
I watched because I didn't want that to happen.
I hoped my presence might prevent it."

She slowly set the book down, her eyes lowered.
"You can't, Luc. You can't stop it because I was already broken."

Her tongue slid across her lips as she scowled.
"The fire you pulled me from wasn't my first attempt.
The men who sold me among their friends regularly took me to the hospital."

That was evident from her soul, but I'd never pressed for details.

"You could heal?" I frowned.

"I could, but before fire, I used poison.
It had different effects and was harder to heal from.
At first, I did it for a break from them.
Then it became a way to numb everything.
But my body adapted, grew used to it.
The doses became dangerous, and they watched me more closely."
She smiled.
"It took them too long to figure out what I was doing."
###Chapter 0405

Fire was my only weapon.

Deep burns take a long time to heal, even for fast healers like us. The damage continues to cook beneath the surface long after the initial injury. I burned down several houses during my escape. I don't regret any of it.

But Nathan, the man Luc killed, learned quickly. He never let me out of his sight after that first attempt. Not even for a second. I couldn't shower alone. I couldn't use the bathroom without him standing guard. When he took me shopping for clothes, he came right into the changing room with me. At night, he handcuffed me to the bed so I couldn't sneak out. So I couldn't set another fire. Or strangle him in his sleep.

She nods slowly. So I know I'm broken, Luc. I've heard you talk about the fractures in Athena's soul. I know what happens when those cracks finally meet. It was only a matter of time before it all caught up with me.

Why didn't you tell me any of this before? I knew she was hiding something, but this... this was beyond anything I imagined. Every word from her lips rings with heartbreaking truth.

She releases a soft sigh. Coming here was supposed to be my fresh start. Especially after you shot Nathan. Her hand rubs at her neck again. I never thought I'd lose the rest of my abilities too.

What if you could get them back? And gain your Lycan form as well? It's a long shot, but it might work.

Don't be stupid. This is the hand I've been dealt. This is what I have to live with now.

No. I refuse to believe you came into my life just to wither away in front of me. The higher powers work in messed up ways, but your death isn't part of their plan.

Luc, it's fine. I know what's coming. I've made peace with it.

You can be so fucking frustrating. I snap. She wasn't even willing to hear me out.

Just as frustrating as you watching me for weeks! Making me feel like I was losing my mind before you finally accepted me! Even if it was in secret!

I cross the room and pull her off the bed. She lets out a surprised squeal as I crush her against my chest. My lips find hers in a hard, desperate kiss. She melts into me instantly. Her arms loop around my neck while my hands slide down to her waist.

She pulls back, breathless. I hold her steady, keeping her hips pressed firmly against mine as she leans back to stare at me.

Just because I can't sense our bond anymore doesn't mean I don't want you.

But I'm...

Not if I can convince Athena to bite you.

Bite me? As in mark me? I don't understand. She's already mated.

Not marking you. That's different. You would be like Zachary and Brianna.

Her eyes widen. Her brows shoot up. I still don't understand.

They aren't pure-blooded Lycans. They were created. They were once Human before they were turned.

She frowns, sucking in her cheeks. When her eyes meet mine again, they're filled with a deep sadness that wasn't there before. But you're a Hunter. Why would you make me Lycan again?

You don't want to be?

I don't know anymore. For most of my life, I've just been fighting to exist. More often than not, I've been waiting for Death to find me.

You were in a horrific situation.

I was. But I'm not like other Lycans. I know that deep down. I've never been able to shift. I never had that exciting moment when I turned thirteen. The only thing that changed was that I became a toy for assholes. Having my abilities but not being able to shift did nothing for me. I always thought they were drugging me to keep my Lycan trapped. But since coming here with Cooper, I've known exactly what's being put into my body. And I still can't shift. So what's the point of being bitten if I still can't transform?

###Chapter 0407
Levi

Theodore sat tied up in the corner of the room.
Levi slept on a chair nearby.
His jacket collar was pulled high around his chin.
His arms were crossed tightly over his chest.
His boots rested on the coffee table he'd shoved against the door.

We reached Seraphina's house unseen.
But each step here had made Levi more agitated.
He hated my calm demeanor.
He was angry that I refused to be angry.
He clearly enjoyed driving people mad.
It didn't work on me.

I let out a quiet sigh.
He had cornered me again about his sister.
He grew more frustrated when I stayed silent.
I expected him to hit me.
To punish me.
But he hadn't laid a hand on me.
Other than keeping me bound.

I heard him stir.
My eyes snapped shut.
His boots hit the floor with a heavy thud.
After the forest, his movements now sounded loud.

He stopped right in front of me.
"Can't sleep?"
I didn't answer.
"Theodore, I know you're awake."
He didn't move.
I kept my eyes closed.
"Your breathing changes. You talk in your sleep."

Crap.
What had I said?
My eyes flew open.
"How do you know that?"

He smiled.
"You have a beautiful home in Obsidian Howl."
He dropped onto the floor beside me.
His arm brushed against mine.
"I get it," he muttered.
"You want to protect your pack. But you'll have to talk to me eventually. I always get what I want."

"I'll talk about anything except my pack."
Maybe I could learn his real motives.

"Why do you love them so much?"
I pressed my lips together and looked away.

"You won't even answer that?"
"That involves the pack."
I kept my tone light.
He hadn't hurt me yet.
I wanted to keep it that way.

"You drive a hard bargain." He winked.
"I like that about you, Theodore. Or maybe I like it because we're mates?"

"We are not mates."

"Just because you can't scent me now doesn't mean we aren't. The drugs will wear off."

"Only because you're tricking my mind. We are not mated." I stated firmly.
I wouldn't fall for his games.

"Is that what you truly believe?"
"It's what you did to Seraphina, right? And others. Lure them in. Trick them. Take their abilities."

"Maybe you're right. Maybe you have me all wrong. Time will tell." He patted my leg.
"Get some sleep. You'll need it."

He stood up and paused, looking down at me.
"You're not like the others, Theodore. They don't see you as an equal."

I rolled my eyes.
"You think I'll fall for that? I won't play your game. Keep me prisoner. Starve me. Lock me up. Do what you want. I won't give you the answers."

"You must care for them a great deal?"
I held his gaze.
He wasn't getting anything else.

He moved back to his chair.
His sage green eyes glowed in the dark.
I couldn't see that yesterday.
The drugs were wearing off.
He'd given me nothing else.
Yet I could scent him now.
Faintly, but it was there.
Maybe it wasn't in the drugs.
Maybe he was projecting the scent himself.
He is part Witch, after all.

"Why do I need my sleep?"
"I just want you well-rested. Not everything about me is bad, Theodore. I do care about some things. You just don't see it yet."

"Like Evelyn?"
"I thought you didn't want to talk about the pack?"

"She isn't part of my pack."
A flicker of delight shone in his sage green eyes.
The blue flecks seemed to sparkle.
His sister means everything to him.
Probably more than anyone.

"You don't have any siblings, do you, Theodore?" My name rolled off his tongue.

"No. And I'm grateful. Siblings always cause problems. Especially younger ones."
Except Seraphina. She was a little older than Athena. But still, a sibling causing problems.

He smiled and nodded.
"They do. I used to think that was their purpose. To be a troublemaker for the older one. I couldn't stand Evelyn when we were kids. Her sticky hands were always in my things. She always wanted to be where I was. The ultimate pain in the ass. But I need her where I can watch her."

"Exactly why I'm glad to be alone."
###Chapter 0408

“Do you prefer solitude?”

“Yes.”

A faint line creased his brow. “Never felt the need to find your other half?”

“No.”

“Isn’t that the goal for every male? To find their destined one and build a life.”

“Not for me.” My vision had sharpened enough to catch the subtle irritation my words sparked. “My life was never about searching for a mate. My upbringing was different. What drives me is knowledge.”

“Power?”

“No, knowledge. Understanding how things work. Uncovering secrets hidden in plain sight.”

“That explains the books.” A slight smile touched his lips. “What other interests do you have?”

“Why does it matter to you?”

“Call it curiosity.” He shifted to face me fully. The scent of leather and tobacco was potent, but it felt deceptive. A lure I had no intention of taking.

“I enjoy helping others.”

“But you won’t help me?” His eyebrow arched.

“You found me in a hospital. What kind of help do you imagine I provide?!”

“Fair point. But we could assist each other.”

I rolled my eyes.

“Not ready for that yet. Fine. You will be. You’ll want to help me. That’s what mates do.”

“Is that what you told all the others?”

He chuckled, spinning back in his chair and propping his feet on the table. “I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed anyone’s company as much as yours, mate.”

“Stop calling me that.”

“I’ll call you mate until you accept the truth.”

Levi surprised me by falling asleep again. He likely sensed I had nearly regained my strength. His only move had been blocking the door. I flexed my wrists and snapped the rope. Quietly, I rose, checking the windows for another way out.

Everything was locked. Shattering the glass would cut my escape time short. I stood frozen in the center of the room, weighing my limited choices. Finally, I raided the fridge and cupboards for something more substantial than fruit.

Fortunately, Seraphina had tinned sausages hidden deep in a cupboard. Not much, but it was protein. Better than fruit.

I moved through the house, peeking into both bedrooms. One was clearly Seraphina’s. Immaculate, except for a facedown photo on the nightstand. I recognized her mother holding a baby I assumed was Seraphina.

The second bedroom was chaos. An open suitcase spilled clothes onto the floor. Garments were strewn across the bed. Dirty plates and glasses sat in odd places. Shattered perfume bottles littered the carpet near the bed. If I didn’t know better, I’d think a teenager lived here, not Evelyn.

I caught Levi’s scent on the stairs. His footsteps were heavy from running.

“I thought you’d escaped!” He stared at me, the broken rope dangling from his hand.

“I considered it. But I was hungry.”

“Why are you in here?” he asked softly.

“Trying to understand a few things.” I turned to face him. Shadows crossed his features, but his intense gaze was unmistakable. “You took Evelyn’s abilities, didn’t you?”

“You don’t know what you’re talking about!”

“She was your first test subject, right? But the dose was too strong. It wasn’t meant to last this long. She was the first you kept in that prison. You held her there because you knew you’d messed up. She had to stay close so you could monitor her.” I threw his own words back at him.

“Is that what you did to Hannah and Seraphina? Gave them the same dose as your sister? So it’s not permanent? It just takes years to fade?”

“Are you seriously accusing me of doing this to my own sister?”

“Yes. I think you grew tired of her interfering. You finally snapped. Now, somehow, she aids you. What was she supposed to be? A guard for Seraphina?”

“You really are clever, Theodore.”

I stayed silent as he began to laugh, muttering to himself. “Of course I’d be mated to someone who reads between the lines.” “We are not mates. This is a trick. I’m just your prisoner.”

He removed his jacket, letting it drop to the floor. His fingers worked quickly on his shirt buttons.

“Witches, and even half-breeds like me, are born with a mark over the heart. Many call it a Witch’s Mark.” He reached the final button and paused. “But the mark is actually the initials of our true mate.”

He tore the shirt open. Above his heart, in deep red, were the clear letters TA. “Now, remind me. What is your name?”

“Theodore Anderson!” I laughed.

“Before you were adopted.”
###Chapter 0409
Alexander

Zachary, Sebastian and I stood at the edge of my territory. We had searched everywhere all day. The hospital. His home. The forest. Every possible location we could think of. We found nothing. No blood. No hair. No footprints. Not even a trace of Theodore's scent.

'There must be something.' Titan growled.

'We've covered the entire pack lands. There's nothing. Wherever he took Theodore, it's farther out.'

"Where would Levi take him?" Sebastian asked. "I doubt he knows this area."

"Then it's probably somewhere close." Zachary answered. "But it depends if Theodore is unconscious or not. Levi could be carrying dead weight or forcing him to walk. And it depends on what Levi actually wants. Is he staying because he has a target? Or has he already left, taking Theodore with him forever?"

"We expand the search." I commanded.

“We need more people for that. And we need trustworthy ones." Sebastian sighed.

"No we don't." Zachary smirked. "We just need answers from one person."

He turned and headed back through the woods. Sebastian raised an eyebrow at me and shrugged.

"Zachary, wait." I called after him.

"It's time for real answers, Alexander. There's only one person we know is definitely lying to us."

"Evelyn."

"We can smell her. We know her scent grows stronger every day. We know from Luc that she's lying. Maybe now it's time to see how close to death she's willing to go."

"She's in denial." Sebastian told him.

"No she's not." I frowned. "Zachary is right. This is a game to her. I don't know if she's gathering information for her brother or what her end goal is, but it's definitely a game. I've seen too many fools play games they think they can win."

We emerged from the trees and headed toward the dungeons when I froze.

'Do you smell that?' Titan murmured.

'Yes.' I could detect Athena's lavender scent. She was supposed to be in the house, not out here.

The dungeon door stood wide open with lights blazing inside. The guard stood to one side. He bowed his head as we approached.

"Is my mate down there?" I demanded.

"Yes. Was I not supposed to let her in?" He asked, confused.

"It doesn't matter now." I snapped.

I hurried down the steps. I found Athena standing in the dim light, staring into Evelyn's cell. Evelyn was sleeping, as was Seraphina, both completely unaware of our presence.

Athena didn't even turn as I approached. "I can hear her." She whispered.

I looked into the cell at a sleeping Evelyn, curled up at the back with drool hanging from her mouth. Who the hell shaved her head?

"She's asleep." I kept my voice low.

"Obviously." Athena murmured. "But her scent has been growing stronger and now there's no doubt - she's a Lycan. I was bathing the boys and I heard whisperings through a mind link. They weren't really saying anything, just making sounds."

She smiled slightly. "Part of me thought it was Evrin trying to speak to me, because he already has his Lycan. But when I spoke back, he didn't respond. So I asked one of the omegas to watch the twins and followed the sound. It grew louder and led me here."

"I don't understand." Sebastian frowned.

"She's linking me without even knowing it."

"Is that even possible?" Zachary asked.

I nodded. Athena had linked me many times while she slept. It was never intentional, but it still happened.

"What is she saying?" I asked.

"Nothing that makes sense. Just mutterings. Now and then she mentions Levi's name but nothing else. Mostly it's just sounds, whimpers. Almost like she's in pain."

"Is she in pain?"

Athena scrunched her face as she stared into the cell. "I don't think so. Could she be dreaming? Is that why she linked me?"

"Possible. Did you shave her head?"

Her blue eyes showed surprise at my question. "No, that was Luc. He took her for questioning earlier. He didn't learn anything. I assume that's why he did it. A punishment that wouldn't really harm her. But he's been busy with Hannah since then. I haven't had a chance to ask."

“She lied about how she escaped prison.” Seraphina whispered from behind us.

Everyone turned to look at her. She sat against the back wall, eyes focused on the ground in submission.

"What do you mean?" Athena asked.

"When I met her, she told me she killed someone in the bathroom. That was how she escaped. When I mentioned it to her after Lucas brought her back, I changed bathroom to library and she didn't correct me. She was hysterical about her hair at the time. Maybe that's how I caught her. She lied to me."

"Payback's a bitch." Zachary winked at her.
###Chapter 0410

Seraphina sat huddled, knees drawn tightly to her chest. She looked utterly broken. Nothing remained of the bold, dramatic woman who had first arrived at our pack. All her confidence had vanished. But that didn't make her trustworthy.

"Has she said anything else?" I pressed.

Seraphina shook her head slowly. "Not really. Mostly she just cursed Lucas for what he did to her. She cried herself to sleep eventually."

"I can command her," Athena stated firmly. "I can order her to answer my questions. She won't be able to lie. Not now that the pack link is restored." I gestured toward Evelyn's cell.

Athena moved to the bars separating us from Evelyn. She took a deep, steadying breath. "Wake up!"

Evelyn jolted upright, automatically brushing her face as if expecting long hair. For a moment, I thought she might scream. Her grey eyes darted wildly around the dim dungeon. She scrambled backward against the wall, fear evident as she registered our presence.

"Get up," Athena's voice echoed commandingly through the dungeon.

Evelyn rose to her feet against her will. Her lips parted in silent shock. Her grey eyes frantically searched for an escape, realizing she had no control over her own body.

I watched, impressed. Athena wielded her power with quiet authority. She didn't flaunt it like others might.

"Evelyn Reed," she whispered through tears. "But you can call me Evie or Eve." It was the same introduction she'd given before. "You are a Lycan?"

"I was. I was drugged and now..."

"Who is Levi?" Athena pressed, cutting her off before she could finish.

Evelyn squeezed her eyes shut, tilting her face downward. Her cheeks flushed red as she fought against answering.

"Answer me!" Athena snapped.

"He is my brother," she blurted out. Her eyes widened in horror at her own admission.

Silence fell. We were all stunned by the revelation. None of us had anticipated this. Luc had believed they were mates, not siblings. 'Seriously?' Titan asked mentally. I gave a slight nod.

"WHAT?!" Seraphina shrieked from behind us. Evelyn's head snapped up, finally noticing Seraphina was awake. "You're his sister? You're his fucking sister!" Seraphina rattled the bars violently. "I'll kill you! I'll get out of here and kill you myself!"

"You are siblings?" Athena asked, ignoring Seraphina's outburst. I saw claws extending from her fingertips. She was ready to execute Evelyn.

Evelyn nodded miserably. "He is my older brother."

"So why did you come here, to Obsidian Howl?" I snarled.

She didn't resist answering this time. "Because he asked me to. I'm sorry, Seraphina. I wasn't... I... You were a good friend."

"You set me up! You brought me back knowing I'd be killed!" Seraphina shouted. "Be grateful these bars are between us!"

"I had to. He's my brother," Evelyn dropped to her knees, defeated.

Seraphina began pacing angrily. She muttered to herself, hands on her hips. At least her focus was off Athena now.

"What does Levi want?" Zachary asked Evelyn.

"I don't know."

"Tell the truth," Athena demanded.

"It is the truth. He asked me to convince Seraphina to show me where Obsidian Howl is. I don't know why." Tears streamed down her cheeks unchecked.

"I was in prison. That wasn't... I was out of control. Levi helped me. He had to do this to me before I became a danger to everyone."

"What does that mean?" Zachary frowned.

She shrugged helplessly. "That's what he always told me. He did it to look after me. To keep me safe. To protect me. He's good like that."

"She's delusional," Sebastian commented.

"So you were just on a farm, waiting for me?" Seraphina asked.

"Levi asked me to wait there. He said you would come my way. He wanted me to reassure you."

"Kill her!" Seraphina snapped. "Just fucking kill her already!"

Zachary gave her a warning glare, and she backed away from the bars. He turned back to Evelyn. "What did he do with Theodore?"

"Who is Theodore?"

"If Levi were to take someone, where would he go?" I questioned.

"You won't find him."

"Where will he go?" Athena snarled.

"I don't know. I don't keep tabs on him. He always contacts me when he needs something. How are you doing this to me?" "She is the Alpha," Zachary told her with a cold smile.

Athena's claws lengthened further. I pulled her back gently. She frowned at me. "I can kill her."

"As much as I like that idea, you can't. Not yet. If you kill her, he might kill Theodore."
###Chapter 0411
Athena

"Sometimes it's infuriating when he's right." Nyx groans. She was just as eager as I was to end Evelyn, but Alexander was correct—we couldn't risk losing Theodore, especially without knowing the full situation.

"So we're letting her live?" I whisper to Alexander as my claws retract. They emerged with almost no pain now, sometimes without me even noticing.

I watch Evelyn staring at us. Her expression mixes fear with hope, believing Alexander is saving her.

Now that she's awake, I no longer hear her whimpers, though our connection remains undeniable. I could command her—I felt that power—but could she sense it too?

"Why is everything so loud?" Evelyn suddenly cries, pressing her hands over her ears. It was strange how sound returned to her last. For me, it had been the first sensation when my binding broke.

"You have your Lycan, you stupid bitch!" Seraphina screeches, making Evelyn flinch.

"You're wrong," she cries back.

"Enough!" Zachary snaps.

"Sebastian, take Seraphina to my office," Alexander orders. "Zachary, ensure she doesn't do anything reckless."

'Is he going to kill her? We have information now. We don't need her anymore. He must be, right?' Nyx asks.

'I don't think so.' I could tell Alexander was contemplating something. If he intended to kill her, he would have done it immediately without hesitation.

He gestures toward the stairs and offers me his hand. He remains silent until we're outside. "We need to relocate Seraphina."

"Why? She's secure in the cell."

"Yes, but she's made it clear she's furious with Evelyn now that some truths are exposed. She'll be useless for gathering more information. You heard her—she wants Evelyn dead. She'll focus solely on that. If Evelyn dies, Theodore likely dies too. I know you don't want that."

I shake my head. "You're right."

"So we handle this carefully. I'll offer the bastard a trade."

"A trade?"

"Theodore for Evelyn and Seraphina. Two for one. We'll see how much he values his sister—it's either both or none."

"Won't that make him think Theodore is more valuable?"

"Deals often involve offering something the other party believes benefits them. They don't have to actually benefit—they just need to believe it will."

I watch as Zachary and Sebastian appear with Seraphina. She stays quiet, keeps her eyes down, and doesn't resist as they lead her away.

"We don't even know how to contact him," I say, scanning the dark grounds. "We don't know where he's taken Theodore."

"Something tells me we won't need to. He'll soon realize the spell or drug has worn off, and he can reconnect with his sister. If he's desperate enough, he'll show up at our doorstep."

"Okay," I mutter. "What will you do with Seraphina?" The slam of the dungeon door makes me jump. "You said she can't stay there. You can't expect me to agree to let her live in the house."

"Of course not. I need someone to watch her, and I know just the person to ask."

He never made people wait for death. If they deserved it, they got it swiftly. So why was he letting her live?

"Do you think Levi will be angry if we kill her too?" I ask.

"Possibly."

"She's too much of a risk," I keep my voice low as Zachary and Sebastian take Seraphina toward the house.

"She is, but I don't think you're her target anymore. She didn't want to come here—Evelyn talked her into it. I don't believe you've been her focus for a while. I'm not saying forgive her; she doesn't deserve that. But maybe we can put her to work, nothing involving security. Just until we figure out our next steps."
###Chapter 0412

‘To work?’ Nyx scoffs.

My gaze snaps to his. “You’re playing your little game again, aren’t you?”

He drapes his arm over my shoulder, pulling me close. He doesn’t answer.

In his office, Seraphina sits slumped in a chair. Her eyes stay fixed on her knees. Her hands are clasped tightly in her lap.

Silence hangs heavy. Minutes pass. Seraphina grows restless. Her entire body trembles. Her leg bounces nervously.

Caleb knocks on the open door. “You called for me, Athena? Is this about Liam? I know we haven’t…” His eyes land on his stepdaughter. A deep scowl forms. “What has she done now?”

“It’s complicated,” Alexander states.

“I assume you thought telling me was better than telling her mother? How long does she have?”

“That depends on you, Caleb,” Alexander replies.

“Me? You want me to decide how she dies?”

I see Seraphina’s eyes go wide. Nyx laughs. ‘She’s practically shitting herself. But why is Alexander lying to Caleb?’

‘You know he has his own methods for testing people.’

“Seraphina is no longer safe in the dungeons. You are her stepfather. I am requesting you take her in. Keep a very close eye on her,” Alexander instructs. I still hated the idea. But I didn’t want her near the house either. Keep your friends close, your enemies closer. Theodore taught me that.

“Take her in? You want me to bring her into our home?” Caleb acts as if we’ve asked him to walk into fire.

“Take her in. Feed her. Watch her. Do not let her out of your sight. She will work under guard supervision. When work ends, she returns directly to you. She does not leave the house unless I or Athena request it,” Alexander orders.

“She is your stepdaughter, Caleb. She is your responsibility. If you refuse, I understand. She will not live to see another day. If you agree, your family’s lives depend on her obedience. If she fails or steps out of line, she will not be the only one to face death. Is that clear?” Alexander asks.

“I have a baby,” he protests, frowning deeply.

‘What if he says no?’ Nyx wonders.

‘We’ll cross that bridge if we come to it.’

“If I do everything you ask… I get to live?” Seraphina whispers.

No one answers. After a tense moment, she nods. “You’re going to kill me anyway.”

“I’ll do it,” Caleb announces.

All eyes shift to him. I expected consent, but also a refusal.

“You will?” I ask. Seraphina stares at me, eyes wide with shock. She’s as surprised as I am.

“I will kill her myself if she disobeys.”

Seraphina looks at me, tears welling in her eyes. “Thank you.”

“Don’t thank me.” I leave the office before anyone else. My heart races. My head pounds.

‘I don’t like this either,’ Nyx grumbles. ‘She was determined to destroy us.’

I wait at the top of the stairs. It takes time for the others to emerge. Caleb has his hands on Seraphina’s shoulders. Her eyes remain downcast as he guides her through the front door. Zachary follows, presumably to ensure no trouble. Sebastian disappears.

Alexander looks up at me from the office doorway, his crimson eyes meeting mine. “I know you’re unhappy. This is only temporary.”
###Chapter 0413
Alexander

'She is furious.' Titan growls inside my mind.
'I know.'
'You could still call this off.'
'No. This has to happen. It must work.'

"Are you going to say anything?" I ask my mate.

Athena remains silent, but she doesn't need to speak. I feel her anger through our bond, see it burning in her blue eyes as she stares down at me from the top of the staircase.

She rises slowly, her hand gripping the banister. Her gaze locks with mine for a brief moment. "I hope you know what you're doing." She turns away just as Luc appears. His eyes track her movement, then shift to me. He frowns as she disappears down the hall. "You've really pissed her off." He observes, walking toward me.

"I'm aware."

He raises an eyebrow. "Aren't you going after her?"

"Normally I would. Right now, my presence will only make it worse. She needs space to process this."

"What exactly is happening? What did I miss?"

I explain the situation. He spends most of the time shaking his head and scoffing.

"Let me get this straight. Seraphina made a threat. Evelyn is in denial. You think the solution is releasing Seraphina from the dungeons. I have to agree with Athena on this one, and that's fucking hard for me to admit."

"You don't lead this pack. Your opinion doesn't matter."

"Fair enough." He mutters. "But consider this. You talk about Evelyn playing games. Seraphina could be part of it. Her reaction might be part of their plan. You know that, right?"

"I don't think so. Not this time. Her defeat is genuine. She asked if she gets to live by following our rules. She thanked Athena. She's broken. Maybe you should observe her more closely."

"You want to fix her?" He gives me a skeptical look.

"It's not about fixing her."

"Could have fooled me." He says sarcastically, studying my face.

"Don't pretend you know everything, Luc."

"You have to consider Athena might not want family outside this pack. She's been through hell. Until you, she had no one. Not everyone wants siblings. Frankly, I'm surprised you're reacting this way after what Seraphina did to your brother."

"My brother dug his own grave and dragged my sister down with him. He was always selfish. Instead of just dying, he piggybacked my sister's soul. I brought out his true colors. I'm not saying what she did was right. I'm not trying to make Athena trust her."

"Right." He presses his lips together, watching me carefully.

"Your opinion doesn't matter anyway. When the time comes, she'll be offered for trade along with Evelyn."

"If you say so."

"I do."

"In that case, I'll keep an eye on her." He offers. "Not when she's with her stepfather, but during her work duties. She fears me more than she fears you. My presence will be a good reminder."

"You mean you want to keep a closer watch on Caleb?"

He scowls at the mention of Caleb's name.

"Caleb returns tomorrow to meet with Zachary and me. We're discussing what happened with the children. As Charlotte's father, you're welcome to join. But under two conditions. No weapons. Keep your hands to yourself."

He clenches his jaw, staring at me.

"Those are the terms, Luc."

"She's my daughter."

"Then act like a father and have the damn conversation with him. Both children were wrong. You can't blame only Liam. Charlotte pinned him down. She had her reasons, and we need to understand them. I told Zachary the same thing. He's willing to reach an agreement with Caleb."
###Chapter 0414

"Alright, I'll show up. No weapons, and I'll keep my hands in my pockets." He clicks his tongue and rolls his eyes. "But I can't promise I'll agree to anything."

"I can live with that for now. Now that's settled—why the hell did you shave Evelyn's head?"

He chuckles. "I was wondering when you'd ask. You said I couldn't physically harm her. So I made sure there was no physical pain. Only psychological. Still got nothing useful out of her, though."

"Always hunting for a loophole."

He nods and flashes me a smile. "So Evelyn and Levi are siblings?"

"You couldn't tell that from her soul?"

"How many times do I have to remind everyone? I'm not psychic. If they were twins, sure, I might’ve sensed it. But I’m guessing half-siblings?"
"Why do you say that?"

"No real resemblance. Apart from the blonde hair. Different eye colors, different nose, lips, face shape. If I saw them on the street, I wouldn’t guess they’re related. Do you believe it?"

"Athena compelled her to tell the truth. You saw how confused Evelyn was. She panicked when her hearing got louder and louder."

"Almost like she’s never shifted?"

"Exactly. Reminded me of Athena when her bindings broke. She wore earplugs for eight months just to handle the noise."

He nods. "Theodore told me."

"He did?"

"When we were out looking for something to help Athena, he filled me in. I think you're right about Evelyn. She's never had the abilities."

I frown. "She kept saying Levi told her he was protecting her. Keeping her safe so she wouldn’t become a danger. I thought Rogue, but if she’s never shifted, that’s not possible. Which means he did it before she turned thirteen."

"And I’d know if she’d ever gone Rogue. Let me spend more time with her. I might see her soul clearer."
"Wait until morning. And don’t touch her."

He rolls his eyes. "I won’t."

Luc drops into one of the office chairs. "I assume there’s no news on Theodore?"

"Not yet."

"Hannah doesn’t know anything else, either." He sighs.

"She’s talking to you now?" We all heard the yelling earlier. It was obvious how furious she was. One of the few times I’ve heard Luc sound so unsure.

"Yes." His answer is sharp. "I actually wanted to talk to Athena about her."

"About what?"

"Turning Hannah back into a Lycan."

'Seriously?' Titan scoffs. I hold up a hand to Luc, trying to push down my own frustration.

"You what?" I sputter as Titan starts losing it. It’s been a long time since he’s gotten this worked up.
"To restore her Lycan nature," Luc states.

"You want Athena to bite her?"

"Yes. Though Hannah is unsure right now."

"No."

"It’s for her own good."

"Why? So you can feel the bond again? You don’t even like Lycans. You struggled to accept her."

"I know. She’s grown on me."

"Athena won’t do it. Not after... she just... And we don’t even know if the Hannah situation will wear off, like with Evelyn."

He glares at me, gets to his feet, and storms out.

I was grateful for the silence. Over twenty-four hours awake without a moment’s peace.

'Alexander. Alexander. Are you there?'
###Chapter 0415

Theodore

'Damn it, Theodore. Where the hell are you?' Hearing Alexander's voice again was a relief.

'I'm with Levi. I had to go with him. It was the only way to ensure he wouldn't harm anyone else.'

'Are you alright? Are you injured?'

'He hasn't hurt me. He drugged me, but it's worn off now.'

'Where are you?'

'He brought me to Seraphina's house. Don't come here. It's too dangerous.'

'Why not?' He asks. 'I can bring enough people. We'll get in and out quickly.'

'He's expecting that. I don't know what else he's capable of.'

A loud snore comes from the chair in the corner. I watch Levi silently, fully expecting him to wake up any second.

'Theodore?'

'He's half Witch, half Lycan. He's drugging people with something he created. Evelyn was his first test subject. He got the dosage wrong, and she hasn't been the same since.'

'It's worn off. He'll probably figure it out soon.' Alexander tells me.

'He already knows.'

'We can use that to our advantage.' He doesn't elaborate further, and I decide it's better not to know.

'What about Hannah and Seraphina?'

'No change.'

'I need you to do something for me.' I speak faster, knowing Levi will wake up any moment.

'Theodore, we need to get you out of there.'

'Not yet,' I mutter, seeing Levi stir. 'Let me get what I can from him first. But I need you to ask Seraphina what scent Levi was giving off when he tricked her into thinking they were mated.'

There's a pause. 'You think you're mated to him?'

'He has a mark on his chest. Claims that Witches are left with the mark of their mate's initials.'

'And?'

'TD' I mutter.

'Your surname is Anderson.'

'My adopted name.' I reply quietly.

Silence again. I knew this news wouldn't be well received. 'Remind me, what was your birth parents' surname?'

'Daudet.'

'Theodore....'

'I won't accept him.' I say hurriedly as Levi starts making more noises. I can't accept someone who thinks it's okay to strip others of their abilities. Not after what my parents did to me. Not after seeing Athena and Hannah struggle. I just need to know if it's a trick or not before I reject him. I want to break him. I have to go, he's waking up.'

I end the link and focus on the rising sun. Keeping my gaze away from Levi. He stopped asking about my birth name after he realized he could link with Evelyn. Whatever she told him made him angry enough to trash the house.

He's a madman with two personalities. If I want to make it back home, I need to play along to some extent.

Levi yawns. "You're already awake."

"Early riser." I mutter back. "I like watching the sunrise."

"I'm surprised your Alpha isn't here, knocking down the door. I know you can link him. I know you're a full Wolf again. So either you have and told him not to come, or you haven't because you can't resist the bond with me."

"Do you always think so highly of yourself?" I glance at him to find him staring intently.

"Yes. Yes I do."

I roll my eyes and turn back to the sunrise as pink hues fill the sky.

"So is today going to be the day you give me your birth name?"

"You're so smart, maybe you should figure it out yourself."

"I'm going to cook you breakfast this morning." He announces, changing the subject.

"Not hungry." I mumble, though my stomach protests with loud growls.

He places a hand against his chest, pretending to be hurt. "But it's my special pancakes. Everyone loves them."

I highly doubt anything here will be edible. Seraphina and Evelyn have been in the pack for ages. Anything you find is probably spoiled."

"Lucky for you, I went out while you were asleep."
###Chapter 0416

"You left the room?" I hadn't heard a single sound all night. Honestly, I don't even recall drifting off to sleep.

"A simple sleeping charm works wonders. Now get up. Go take a shower. I left some clean clothes for you behind the door."

"What?"

He grips my arms and pulls me upright. "Shower. Now."

"Why?"

"You can't sit at breakfast looking like that."

"No—I mean why are you doing any of this?" I stare straight at him.

"I'm trying to prove I’m not the monster you think I am."

I let out a sharp laugh.

"They really convinced you I’m some kind of beast, didn’t they?" He shakes his head slowly. "I would never harm you."

He reaches toward my face, but I pull back. "Is that what you tell all of them? Sweet words, getting under their skin, making them believe lies? I’m not like the others. I won’t fall for it. You keep pretending this is for me. It’s not. You’re doing this for yourself. It’s that simple."

"What will it take for you to believe this is real?"

"Real? I don’t think you know what that word means."

His eyes narrow. I struck a nerve. He seizes my shoulders, spins me around, and shoves me toward the kitchen. A faint smile touches my lips. Maybe he was finally realizing he couldn’t win me over.

Alexander forces me into a chair. "Sit!" he snarls.

As I sit, he yanks my arms behind my back. I feel something cold and metallic—a chain—wrapping around my wrist. "Let’s try a different approach." He grabs my head, forcing it to the side. His rough fingers push my long hair away from my neck.

"Get off me."

"You won’t be able to resist once I mark you."

"Don’t you dare touch me." I growl, straining against the chains. "I am not your mate. You want to know my birth name? It doesn’t start with a D." I lie through my teeth. "It’s Monroe. Theodore Monroe."

His fingers still in my hair. "You're lying."

"No, I'm not." I had prepared myself to go this far. There was no way I was letting him mark me. That would bind me to him until death.

He drags my chair across the floor.

Crouching down, he locks his sage-green eyes on mine. The blue specks in them darken again—something that happens when he’s about to lose control. "What is your name?"

"Theodore Monroe." I say it clearly, confidently.

"Liar."

"And you’re a fool if you don’t believe me."

"I can smell you. You can’t hide that."

"Maybe your mind is playing tricks. Maybe you’re so obsessed with me you want to believe it’s true. I’ve seen stranger things happen." Clearly, detecting lies wasn’t one of his strengths. Idiot.

He taps my cheek lightly and turns away. "What’s your favorite pancake topping? I’m making you the best damn pancakes you’ve ever tasted."

"You mean you’re going to poison me?"

"No. Why would I do that? I’ve told you, Theodore. I like you. I like you a lot. I want you by my side."

He was delusional.

"What about your true mate?" He was so sure it was me, but I would never accept someone like him.

"We’ll see."

He turns my chair back toward the table and slides it forward until I’m seated properly. He moves away, muttering to himself as he pulls out what sounds like a dozen ingredients.

The window reflection shows his lips moving, but no sound comes out. It was like he was talking to himself—but then I catch his eyes. He was mind-linking someone.

It had to be Evelyn.

###Chapter 0418
Athena

'What if we just end her? It's a viable option, isn't it? No one has to find out until it's done.' Nyx suggests.

'As much as I'd love to, Alexander is right. We need Seraphina for the trade along with Evelyn. I don't want Theodore to die. He doesn't deserve that fate.'

'Fine. Then we wait until the deal is finalized. After that, we eliminate her? Make it appear accidental? She's human now—it should be simple. Let her bleed out? I know you've considered it too, so don't pretend otherwise.'

No thought remained private anymore. Either Nyx was listening in, or Alexander was reading my mind.

'We are!' She clicks her tongue.

'As much as I want to, I'll wait. Let Alexander play his game. If anything goes wrong, I'll happily tear her heart out myself.'

I collapse onto the bed, staring up at the ceiling as my body sinks into the mattress. The omega had taken the twins to Victoria and Sebastian's shortly after I left last night. She was young, and even at their age, the twins knew how to test her patience. Though she hadn't witnessed Evrin shift yet.

Damn it. I forgot to warn Victoria and Sebastian too.

Closing my eyes, I'm instantly hit with a wave of Alexander's woody scent. The door swings open, letting in a cool breeze. "Are you still angry?" He asks softly.

"No. I'm too exhausted to stay mad."

He pauses, and I know he's sifting through my thoughts to verify my honesty.

"Then this might upset you."

I push myself up on my elbows to meet his crimson gaze. "What do you mean?"

"Theodore linked me."

"He linked you? How... he was... where?" Questions swarm my mind.

"He was drugged, as we expected. But it seems to have worn off, just like Evelyn's did."

I try to process how. Evelyn claimed she lost her abilities long ago. And Hannah and Seraphina were still without their Lycan traits. "Levi has him." Alexander continues.

"Where?"

"He doesn't want us to rescue him. He believes it's a trap—exactly what Levi wants and expects."

"We can't just abandon him!" I scowl.

"We won't. For now, he's unharmed and safe. But he wants to gather more intel on Levi and his motives." "Where is he?" I press.

"There's more." He evades my question. He clearly doesn't want me to know. "Theodore asked me to speak with Seraphina about the scent Levi used. The one he manipulated to make her believe he was her mate."

"Wh..." I stop myself as realization dawns. "He thinks Levi is his mate?"

"He explicitly stated he won't accept him, even if he is. He refuses to be with someone like Levi."

"Is that why he left with him? Because of a potential bond?"

"I'm not sure. He severed the link before I could ask."

"He cut the link?"

"Yes." He sighs. "His last words were that he won't accept the bond. That's why he wants to know what Seraphina smelled. If it's the same, he'll know it's a trick. I'm allowing him to link me on his terms, when it's safe."

"What if it's not?" I sigh. "What if that scent is what his mate is supposed to smell like? Levi might not be fabricating the scent but the idea of the bond. That means everyone he desires would smell identical."

'For someone so tired, you're sharp today.' Nyx murmurs, impressed.

I study Alexander, who remains silent. "There's something else, isn't there?"

"Yes. Levi is half-Witch. He wasn't using anyone. It's all been him."

I exhale heavily. The only other Witch I've met was Madame Zora.

"He told Theodore they bear a mark."

"Like a Witch's mark?"

Alexander closes his eyes and nods. "The mark is the initials of their mate."

"And?" I know he's doling out information slowly. Not for dramatic effect, but to let me absorb it all.
###Chapter 0419

"Theodore."

I fall back onto the mattress.

Nyx curses under her breath.

"Where is he?" I demand.

"I'll tell you, but you must promise not to act. Do you understand me?"

"It's Theodore," I argue. "We can't just—"

"We have to."

"You're not doing anything!" I can't comprehend his lack of urgency. Theodore was our friend. He helped with my Lycan history. Tutored me. Supported us at the hospital. Stepped in as Beta when Sebastian was failing. Saved Brianna. The list goes on, but listing his deeds won't change Alexander's mind.

"Trust me, Athena. I am handling it. This isn't something we can rush. We won't be storming in to rescue him."

"Why not? I've watched you eliminate countless threats."

"Those were Wolves and Lycans. Witches operate differently."

"I don't follow."

"Their abilities vary. We don't know what the Bennetts are capable of. He used a drug to suppress powers, but we have no idea if he can brew potions. He might have other skills."

"Like what?"

"There's an old story from my childhood. About a Witch who annihilated an entire Wolf pack without ever setting foot inside their territory."

I frown as Nyx wonders how that's even possible.

"The tale says she could project herself into the pack. Gather intelligence without physically being there."

"They couldn't detect her?" I ask, confused.

"No."

"Then how do you know it's true?"

"I don't. The story has been passed down through generations of Wolves. I remember asking my father about it once. It made him uneasy. My mother told me to never mention it again."

"If I've learned anything, it's not to believe something until I see it with my own eyes." I sit up and swing my legs off the bed.

"That story still haunts the older generations of Wolves."

"Is that why they avoid Witches?"

"Exactly."

"You worked with one," I whisper.

"Madame Zora was different. Though I suspect she would have done anything for the right price."

I stay silent, processing his words. "You don't want me to know where Theodore is, do you?" I ask quietly.

He sits beside me on the bed. "I'm worried you'll go after him alone. And before you argue, I know you're capable of killing Levi. That's not the issue. Theodore said he's waiting. That means he's prepared for our arrival. I won't take any risks."

"But—"

"Theodore assured us he's safe. Levi hasn't harmed him."

"He stripped his abilities," I frown.

"Temporarily. We will get Theodore back. We just need to time it right and let events unfold. We'll make our move when we're ready."

I nod as he wraps an arm around me. But leaving Theodore out there twists my stomach into knots. It feels wrong. Like we're abandoning him.

Alexander kicks off his boots and crawls up the bed, lying down with a groan. He holds out a hand to me. "Come here. You're exhausted."

"I'm fine."

"We have a few hours before Caleb returns. Zoe is keeping the twins until noon."

His hand remains extended, but his crimson eyes narrow. He's ensuring I don't go anywhere.

I roll my eyes and lie back down. He immediately pulls me against his chest, his arms locking around me.

I should be angry that he's restraining me. But his scent, his warmth, his touch—it soothes my restless mind. I have to trust his process. I have to believe in what he's doing.
###Chapter 0420
Zachary

I knock on the office door and get no answer. That’s odd. I expected Alexander to be here already. The meeting with Caleb starts in less than five minutes.

I step inside and move to the far right corner. I position myself behind the desk, near the window. I need a clear view of everyone in the room.

Luc shows up next. He spins in front of me deliberately. He lifts his shirt just enough to prove he isn’t hiding weapons in his belt.

“You actually listened for once.” I mutter.

“It might shock you, but I care about my daughter. I can follow rules when it matters.”

I don’t answer. Alexander walks in yawning. “I need to talk to both of you after this.”

“About my little girl?” Luc asks.

“No…”

He’s cut off as Caleb arrives. Caleb checks his watch. “I’m not late, am I?”

“You’re right on time.” Alexander tells him. “Take a seat.”

“What about my daughter and his kid? Shouldn’t they be here too?” Luc challenges. “Since this is about them.”

“DO NOT call him that.” Caleb growls through clenched teeth.

“I don’t want either of you speaking.” Alexander’s crimson eyes shift between them. “You both need to listen.”

He points at me. He already asked me to explain how I found Charlotte. He believes it will help Caleb understand. “Do you know how Charlotte lived when she was young?” I ask carefully.

“Yes, I know what Seraphina did.”

“I’m not talking about Seraphina. I’m talking about the Humans she sold her to.”

“This has nothing to do with her attacking my son.”

“Maybe not. But you deserve to know. It might help us understand why she pinned Liam down.”

Even Luc doesn’t know the full truth about how I found her. He only heard bits and pieces. As long as she was safe, he was satisfied. But I often wonder if he noticed the cracks in her soul too and just stayed silent.

His eyes flash toward me. I can see his anger rising to the surface. He paces in the background. His hands are balled into fists. He’s like a live grenade, ready to explode.

'Tread carefully.' Alexander links me while watching Luc.

'He’s unarmed.' But that doesn’t mean Luc won’t hit something.

“She was just a child.” Caleb mutters sadly as I finish explaining how she ate from a bowl like a dog the first night I saved her.

“She learned to survive on nothing. She had nightmares for almost a year. They finally eased to maybe once a week.” I glance at Luc. He’s staring into space, probably imagining how he’ll make Seraphina suffer for what she did to his child. “Charlotte has kept everything bottled up for so long. I knew one day she would explode. She didn’t attack him for fun. She attacked Liam because of what he said.”

Caleb looks down.

“He hasn’t told you what he said, has he?” Alexander asks.

“He’s sticking to the same story. He claims he asked for a pencil and she snapped. But I know it’s not the whole truth. She has nightmares; he sleeps soundly, without a care.”

“He called her poison. Told her someone would kill her in her sleep.” I mutter. Hearing Brianna tell me that made my blood boil. “He wouldn’t…”

“He did.”

Caleb narrows his eyes at me. “She told you that.”

“No, she confided in a friend. I believe her.”

“My son wouldn’t say something like that.” Caleb shakes his head dismissively.

“Then bring him in here! I’ll find out if the little liar is telling the truth!” Luc snarls.

Alexander raises his hand to silence everyone. “Caleb, how would Liam know about poison? It’s not something taught to children that young.”

He shakes his head. “He’s never mentioned it before. Not even when fighting with his brother. I don’t think Zoe and I have ever discussed it. Maybe we did without realizing he was listening, but it wasn’t recent. If you haven’t noticed, Alexander, we’re not a family that goes on hunts or to war. We haven’t even joined a pack run because we don’t feel welcome among the Wolves.”
###Chapter 0421

"Is it all the Wolves or just specific ones?" Alexander questions, and it hits me that we overlooked the most obvious source. The Lycans would know exactly which Wolves were causing trouble.

"I can provide a few names." Caleb sighs, his blue eyes locking onto mine. "I am Liam's father. I will speak with him again."

"He's already lying to you. Talking won't accomplish anything." Luc snaps sharply.

"Has Liam ever behaved like this before?" I ask, hoping Luc will just be quiet for a moment.

"Never. He always received excellent reports from his previous school. We've never had problems with him at home, aside from some typical sibling rivalry. But that's normal, isn't it?"

"Oh, absolutely." Alexander mutters. "Just wait until your daughter is old enough to develop an attitude. Younger sisters are experts at creating chaos." He adds. "Why do you ask?" Caleb queries.

"As you know, Lottie has been assisting Athena with any Lycans that have appeared. She does it because she takes after her biological father." I murmur, gesturing toward Luc. "She perceives things others cannot."

"Are you suggesting she saw something in my son?"

"That is precisely what Zachary is implying." Luc scoffs.

"So what is our course of action?" Caleb asks. "They both need to attend school, but if incidents like this will keep occurring with the Hunter's daughter..." He shrugs. "I'm already monitoring my stepdaughter closely. Zoe will be devastated if Liam is barred from school. And separating them isn't really a solution, is it?"

"Actually," Alexander mutters. "Maybe that is exactly what we should do. Some children could have lessons in the morning and finish at lunch. Others start after lunch. That way, they aren't in the same classroom together."

"I agree to that arrangement." Caleb nods.

"I suppose." Luc grumbles.

"Keep Liam home until Monday. My direct orders if anyone questions it. We'll implement the new schedule then."

"Thank you, Alpha Alexander." Caleb rises to his feet and gives a respectful nod to me and Alexander. He then pointedly walks past Luc without any acknowledgment.

"Do you believe it will work?"

"There's only one way to find out. Luc, close the door."

He gives Alexander a strange look but obeys the command.

"Theodore is alive."

"How do you know that?" I ask, surprised.

"He mind-linked me."

"Where is he?" I press.

He takes a deep breath, almost as if he didn't want to tell us. "He's still with Levi."

"You have got to be fucking kidding me!" Luc snaps.

Alexander shakes his head and closes his eyes with a sigh. "Levi is attempting to convince Theodore that they are mates."

"He's completely delirious." Luc scoffs.

Alexander's eyes fix on Luc. "You know a great deal. I'm wondering if you can confirm something for me?"

"If I can, I will."

"What is a Witch's mark?"

"I've never seen one myself. I can only relay what I've heard, and it might not be entirely accurate."

"Continue." Alexander growls.

"It was once said that the mark served to distinguish them from the rest of us. But over time, as the world evolved, it changed."

"Changed?" I mutter.

"The mark began to mutate. In its place, almost like a scar, are the initials..." He stops and stares back at Alexander. It was almost amusing to see him speechless.

"Initials?" I press, eager for the information.

His eyes shift to me. "The initials of his mate. Levi is his mate, isn't he?"

"It is appearing increasingly likely."

"Has he switched sides?" Luc asks as I try to process this revelation.

"No. His intentions are very clear. But he needs to resolve a few matters on his end first."

"We must leave immediately to retrieve him. You can locate him now that you've linked him." Luc suggests.

"He doesn't want us to. Not yet. I am aware of his plan. We simply need to be patient." Alexander states.

"Since when is Theodore gay?"

They both stop to stare at me. Luc is the first to laugh, followed by Alexander.

"You've been here a while, correct?" Luc asks through his laughter.

"Yes."

"Well, it's fairly obvious." He replies.

I look over at Alexander, who is forcing his lips together to suppress his amusement. "You might have just improved my mood."
###Chapter 0422
Seraphina

I stretched out on the narrow single bed that was now my own. The soft mattress felt like heaven after endless nights on cold, hard stone. Someone had left a stack of folded blankets and a fresh set of clothes at the foot of the bed. I assumed it was my mother, since everything was already here when Caleb brought me down.

Upstairs, I could hear my brothers racing around. Their heavy footsteps echoed through the ceiling. My mother’s voice cut through the noise, telling them to quiet down before they woke Braelyn.

It felt strange to find comfort in the sounds of my family. I had always preferred silence until Levi Bennett forced it upon me. Now, every moment of quiet felt threatening. Silence only meant one thing—punishment was coming.

I closed my eyes and let a small smile form. I was still alive. Still breathing. Maybe I could find a way to stay that way. If I just did everything they asked, maybe they would forget about punishing me.

The door handle turned suddenly. My eyes flew open. One of my brothers stood on the stairs, staring down at me. I couldn’t tell which one—they both had the same blonde curls framing their faces.

"You look like a boy," he spat, his voice full of disgust. I guessed it was Liam, the slightly older one. Caleb had mentioned him earlier when he came to the office. He’d said something about a meeting regarding him this morning. Now I understood why there were issues.

My hands instinctively went to my shorn hair. His brown eyes were wide as he watched me. The corners of his mouth turned up in a smug grin. He was proud of himself for thinking he’d upset me.

"It’s what happens when you’re naughty," I told him flatly.

"Then you shouldn’t have gotten caught," he shot back before darting back up the steps and slamming the door shut. I heard his quick footsteps fade, followed by muffled conversation with our mother. I couldn’t make out the words.

A few minutes later, my door opened again. I remained seated on the bed, watching as my mother slowly descended the stairs. Her hair was pulled back into a tight bun, a few strands of white visible against the jet black. A deep green dress hugged her frame. For someone who’d had four children, she didn’t look it. Her body was in better shape than mine. Only the soft wrinkles around her eyes gave away her age.

"What did you say to Liam?" she asked softly.

Of course he’d run to her. "He said I looked like a boy because of this," I said, pointing to my head. "I just told him it’s what happens when you’re naughty."

She placed her hands on her hips. "You can’t say things like that to a seven-year-old."

"Maybe he needs to hear it. I know Caleb went to meet with the Alpha about Kim. There’s only one reason he’d need to do that."

Her lips pressed into a thin line. She knew I was right.

"Please be careful what you say around the boys. I don’t want any more trouble than necessary."

"Mom, you and Caleb are already tasked with watching me. What more trouble could you possibly have?"

She glared at me, and I quickly backtrack.

"I’m not saying I’ll cause trouble. I’m just saying you’re already on the Alpha’s radar."

She nodded slowly, considering my words. "Come upstairs for breakfast. You’re going to work soon, and you can’t do it on an empty stomach."

"I’m okay."

"I’ll tell you what I tell the boys. It’s not negotiable."

I followed her up the wooden stairs and into the dining room. She gestured toward a chair beside my youngest brother. He hadn’t met me yet. He dropped his spoon into his bowl and stared at me with dazzling blue eyes. He was a miniature version of Caleb, but with the same blonde curls as Liam. Caleb must have been blonde before he went bald.
###Chapter 0423

“Calihan.” Mum speaks to him. “This is your sister, Seraphina. She will be staying with us now.”

He flashes a wide grin, showing all his teeth. “Hi. Are you my big sister?”

“Yes, I suppose I am.” I return his smile as mum gestures toward the cereal boxes, inviting me to help myself.

Liam takes a seat across from me. He watches me intently while eating, remaining silent as Noah chats excitedly about school, completely unaware of his brother’s behavior.

“Your father just informed me there’s no school today.” Mum announces as she brings in several jugs of juice. She looked prepared to feed an entire pack rather than just four of us and a baby.

Noah pumps his fist in celebration while Liam demands to know why. Another unusual trait—most children his age would rejoice at an unexpected day off.

“Alpha Alexander is restructuring the classes. He’s splitting them to ensure each child receives more attention. Starting Monday, Liam, you’ll attend in the morning, and Noah, you’ll go in the afternoon.”

“That’s not fair!” Liam slams his fist on the table.

“Those are the rules. What do we do about rules?” Mum glares at him, and Liam immediately shrinks back.

What was that about?

“We follow them.” Noah states proudly.

“Exactly, especially if we want to remain happy here.”

Noah nods enthusiastically and slurps milk from his bowl. The boys were polar opposites, but it went beyond that. Even without my Lycan senses, I could tell something was troubling Liam.

Noah resumes telling me about his school friends while Liam continues his silent observation. He bore no resemblance to the carefree boy I’d seen playing in the front garden days before.

“It’s Liam’s birthday soon.” Noah informs me. “He’s turning eight.” Noah holds up his fingers proudly. “Just two more sleeps.”

“Are you excited?” I ask Liam as mum leaves to retrieve Braelyn.

He rolls his eyes and carries his empty bowl to the sink.

“He’s just being silly.” Noah explains.

“Maybe he’s so excited it’s made him tired.” I tell my little brother, stretching the truth. “It happens sometimes.”

Mum returns with Braelyn. She had grown significantly since I last saw her. Mum settles her into the high chair and places a bottle of milk before her. She was a perfect miniature of mum—deep brown eyes and a shock of jet black hair. Completely focused on her bottle.

“Do you think you could get used to this?” Mum asks me.

I’d never experienced anything like this before. A tear escapes, and Noah wraps his small arms around my waist. “Please don’t cry.”

I nod at mum. “I’m sorry.”

She smiles warmly. “I understand. It just took you a while to find your way home.”

“Dad. It’s not fair.” Liam stomps after Caleb while I finish tying my boots.

“It’s necessary. You won’t be in class with the Hunter’s child anymore. No more trouble.”

“There wasn’t any trouble! I just asked her for a damn pencil!”

I watch Caleb spin around and glare at Liam. Liam immediately shrinks, lowering his head until his face disappears from view.

“Watch your language! Don’t ever speak to me like that again!”

“Yes Dad.” His tone completely changes from moments before. “Now go to your room until I return.”

Liam nods quickly and dashes toward the staircase. His feet pound up the steps, followed by a slamming door. Caleb groans in frustration. He turns to me. “Ready? Your escort is here.”
###Chapter 0424

"My escort?"

"He specifically requested to monitor you. It wasn't my decision to make."

"Who?" I ask softly, already dreading the response.

"Lucas Adler. My advice..."

"I comply with his every instruction and answer all his questions." I cut in swiftly.

He gives a curt nod. "You'll be assigned to the gardens today. Fruit inspection, vegetable maintenance, and weeding."

"I can handle that." Though I wasn't certain how I'd cope with Lucas's constant scrutiny.

"Take this." Mum extends a paper bag toward me. "I packed you a lunch."

"You didn't have to..."

"I know. See you later."

An unfamiliar emotion swelled inside me, threatening to bring tears to my eyes again. Not from anger or sorrow. This feeling was entirely different. "Thank you," I whispered, but she had already turned away.

I opened the door to find Lucas massaging his temples. "You didn't attempt to escape? I was anticipating it."

"To give you another excuse to end me?" I countered.

"Perhaps. You're learning quickly, it seems. Let's move. I hope you're decent with plants."

I followed him to the expansive gardens, where rows upon rows of various plants were being tended by multiple workers. They all paused to glare at me. Lucas gestured to a woman with long, wavy red hair. She approached me slowly, carrying a bucket of small gardening tools.

Removing her glove, she offered her hand. "I'm Hannah."

"You're the woman they mentioned. The one who lost her abilities?"

"Correct. Shall we begin working?"

Surprisingly, Lucas didn't follow me through the crops. He remained at the perimeter, his watchful gaze never leaving me. His silent observation made me increasingly uneasy.

"You don't need to keep looking at him." Hannah murmured beside me. "He's just here to observe, nothing more."

"It's just... I ruined his life. I know he wants me dead. But I'm trying to make amends."

"I know. The fact that you're here at all shows you're trying." She winced as she bent over.

"Are you all right?"

"He believes it's too soon for me to be doing this, but I insisted. I can't remain indoors all day."

"Too soon?"

She lifted her shirt just enough to reveal badly bruised ribs.

"Did he do this to you?" I gasped.

"Absolutely not. I'm still recovering from Levi."

"I hope he gets what he deserves. To do this and strip us of our identity... it's worse than death." I sighed heavily.

"I'm certain they'll find a way to handle him. Athena is remarkably clever, and so is Alexander. They always prevail." She gave me an encouraging smile.

"I truly hope they win this time." I remained filled with doubt.

I worked for hours, letting Hannah guide me through each task. Lucas never once hovered over me, but he always positioned himself within sight.

He walked me to my new residence in complete silence. I wanted to say something, anything, but ultimately chose to keep quiet.

He knocked on the door and waited for Caleb to answer. The moment the door opened, Lucas turned and walked away without uttering a single word. His silence felt more punishing than any words he could have spoken.
###Chapter 0425
Lucas Adler

"I told you she would fear me!"

"You used Hannah?" Alexander raised an eyebrow at me, though his annoyance was clear.

"It was her suggestion. She believed connecting with Seraphina over what Levi did to them both might help her relax."

"And?" He leaned back in his chair.

"Nothing happened. Seraphina didn't lie as I expected. She was surprisingly open with information. She focused on the task, accepting everything Hannah showed her. If we didn't know her history, you'd think she was a model pack member."

"Probably because you were watching her?" He muttered. "She fears you, of course she'll behave. But do you truly believe she's being honest?"

"As much as I despise her and would gladly use her skin as a warning to others, she isn't lying. I never thought I'd say this, but Levi broke her in ways I couldn't imagine. I saw something in her I've never seen before." Did I want to admit it? No. Did I want to tell Alexander? Absolutely not. But it was better coming from me.

"What?"

"Empathy."

"Empathy?"

"Yes." I answered sharply. "The bitch actually showed empathy."

He stared at me in disbelief. "Keep that information to yourself."

"I can do that. Are you worried about Athena?"

He shook his head. "Athena can handle herself."

"Okay, but..."

"It doesn't matter, Luc. Just do this for me."

I scowled at him. "Seems like more things keep getting added to our agreement."

He looked me directly in the eye. "Are you going to tell me you suddenly hate living here? You haven't returned home in months."

I remained silent. I wouldn't admit I was growing accustomed to pack life or that I didn't want to be away from Hannah. I still disliked ninety percent of the Lycans, but the Wolves were tolerable.

"Having regular people to talk to is nice, right?" He paused for my response. When I didn't answer, he continued. "Speaking with others like you every day. Having your mate here in the pack. And don't tell me you dislike my mate, because I know you're fascinated by her soul."

"Alright! Yes, I do like living here."

A smug smile appeared on his face, and I rolled my eyes.

"It's just not how I was raised. I could never accept you as my Alpha, but yes, I do enjoy living here."

"I can accept that for now." His eyes flickered to the clock. "Want to join me to feed the other prisoner?"

"You're feeding her now?"

"We need to keep her alive if we want to trade her."

I followed him to the kitchen where a tray of food was already prepared. Just a sandwich, a carton, and some fruit, but it would be enough to sustain Evelyn. Personally, I would have let her starve for another day or two.

In the dungeons, Evelyn sat at the back of her cell. She held her knees to her chest and rocked slowly. Alexander opened her door and gestured for me to bring in the food. She didn't move as I placed it on the ground and stepped out.

It was only when Alexander turned the key that her head snapped up. "Levi is going to kill you!"

"Are you talking to me or him?" I asked while pointing at Alexander.

"Both of you. You both hurt me. You both punished me. You took away my friend. You ruined everything I had."

"Your friend? You mean the one you lied to? The one you tricked into leading you here?" Alexander challenged. "You're an excellent friend."

I had to stop myself from laughing at his sarcasm because Evelyn didn't understand it.

"Have you killed her?"

"Does it matter?"

She rested her forehead on her knees and began crying. "This is all wrong. This wasn't supposed to happen."

"Being thrown in the dungeons?" I asked out of curiosity.

"Why are you really here, Evelyn?" Alexander pressed.

"It doesn't matter." She sniffled. "He's coming for me."

"I assume you're talking about your brother?"
###Chapter 0426

"He wants me back."

"Your brother is a complete asshole." I mutter under my breath.

She shakes her head fiercely. "No, you don't understand. He protects me. He's always protected me."

"Is that the lie he feeds you?" Alexander questions sharply. "He stripped you of your Lycan nature to protect you? Do you know what we call people who do that?"

Her grey eyes flicker up to us nervously before she shakes her head again.

"Abusers. Cowards. Weaklings. I could list more." Alexander tells her coldly. "But you wouldn't believe a word I say."

"He's my brother. His only job is to protect me."

"Yet here you are in my dungeons while he's nowhere to be found. We know you can mind-link him, Evelyn. And judging by those deep claw marks on the wall, you've shifted recently."

I had been so focused on reading her soul that I missed the savage gouges scarring the stone walls.

"It was agony." She whispers, dropping her head in shame.

"First shifts always are." I shrug. She would've known that if Levi had bothered to teach her anything about being a Lycan.

"When is Levi coming?" Alexander demands as her stomach growls loudly. Her grey eyes keep drifting toward the untouched food.

"He said he's on his way."

"She's lying."

Her head snaps up. "I'm not!"

"You are. I can see it plain as day. Your entire demeanor shifted when you said it."

"So he's not coming?" Alexander asks for confirmation.

She presses her lips together in a tight line. "He said he would and then..."

"And then what?"

"Something more important came up. He wants you to go to him instead."

"Did he tell you to say that?" Alexander demands.

She nods quickly. Alexander looks to me for verification. I confirm she's telling the truth this time.

"And you still can't see how he's using you?" He asks incredulously.

"He isn't!"

"Really? He planted you in that house exactly where he predicted Seraphina would run. He had you befriend her. Convince her to return here even when she knew she might be walking to her death. What else? Did he want you to spy on my pack? Draw him maps of our territory? Connect with his other lackeys?"

"I don't know."

"What did he want you to do, Evelyn?"

"I..."

"What is his plan?" Alexander's voice rises with each word.

"I... I truly don't know."

"He's using you as a pawn and you don't even know the game?"

"No." Tears stream down her face. "I just had to get her here."

Alexander glances at me. I nod. “She's telling the truth now.”

He slams his hands against the steel bars and storms out. My patience wears thin most days, but Alexander was clearly losing his composure over the lack of real answers.

"Eat. Stop that stomach from making those disgusting noises." I snap at Evelyn before following Alexander.

"You believe her?" He demands as we step into the harsh daylight.

"Several things are clear. She genuinely believes Levi is helping her, not punishing her by taking her abilities. She thinks she's Seraphina's real friend despite the lies. And she has zero clue what Levi actually wants."

"So he's manipulating her?"

"We both know that. But he's careful about how he uses her. If he's the only one who knows the full plan, it makes him harder to stop. In some twisted way, the bastard's a genius."

He glares at me. "He's a monster."

"Never said he wasn't. But even you have to admit not sharing his plans is strategically smart!"

His scowl deepens. "Go check with Caleb. He's compiling names of Wolves causing problems for the Lycans. They might be working for Levi."

"I've already vetted them all."

"Luc, just do it."

"What are you planning?" I ask cautiously. His anger radiates off him. My sarcastic comments weren't helping.

"I need to speak with my Betas."

"Well, today's your lucky day." I nod toward Sebastian speaking with a Wolf several hundred yards away.

I watch Alexander stride off, making a mental note to talk to Athena. An enraged Alpha losing control of his pack was a disaster waiting to happen. And if he feels that control slipping, we're all in deep trouble.
###Chapter 0427
Athena

“And she was genuinely kind?” I question Hannah, struggling to accept her account of Seraphina.

‘Seraphina must be deceiving us, right?’ Nyx murmurs internally.

“She was. Luc made her visibly anxious, and she kept glancing around to track his location. But in the end, she didn’t speak negatively about anyone except Levi. I barely know her, which is exactly why I offered to be present. I thought if she was putting on an act, she might reveal her true intentions to a stranger, or someone who’s endured similar trauma. I even showed her the bruises I still carry. And you know what? She advised me to rest. But I insisted on helping.”

“You didn’t need to go that far.”

“I know. I just wanted to contribute. You and the Alpha are both allowing me to stay in the house, even though I’ve lost my Lycan abilities. This felt like something I could actually do.”

“Has Luc discussed your Lycan with you?” I ask.

“He suggested that you bite me to restore my abilities.”

‘He did what?’ Nyx responds, clearly startled by the idea.

“I told him I’m not even certain that’s what I want anymore.”

“That… wasn’t what I meant. There’s a possibility your lack of abilities is only temporary. They might return.”

She frowns and shakes her head firmly. “No.”

“What do you mean, ‘no’?”

“Levi told me. It’s all a bit foggy, you understand.” She taps her temple gently. “But he definitely said it. He called it my punishment for being with Luc. He said I would never experience being a Lycan again. Only those who are worthy deserve it.”

‘But it wore off for Evelyn?’ Nyx whispers.

“He said never?” I press.

Hannah nods. “Something about how he doesn’t make mistakes.”

“He doesn’t make mistakes?”

“Sorry.” She shrugs slightly. “Like I said, it’s still fuzzy. Sometimes the memories don’t feel coherent. Occasionally, a clear memory surfaces, and I know it’s not a dream. I remember him standing over me, saying those exact words.”

‘He doesn’t make mistakes? That feels like a hidden message,’ Nyx mutters.

‘I agree.’

“Do you remember anything else, Hannah?”

She shakes her head. “I’m sorry, Athena. I try, and Luc keeps asking me. But when I attempt to recall, it feels like I’m being pulled into a dream. I can’t always distinguish what’s real. Is it okay if I go lie down? It’s been a long day.”

“Of course.” I offer a warm smile as Nyx repeatedly echoes Hannah’s words.

‘He doesn’t make mistakes.’

‘It’s a strange thing to say, right?’ I mutter to Nyx.

‘Yep!’ She emphasizes the ‘p’. ‘Everyone makes mistakes. Do you think she knows something more?’

I shake my head. ‘I doubt she could keep anything from Luc. Not through words, and not because he’d see it in her soul.’

I sink onto the sofa, tucking my legs beneath me. “Do you think he messed up by saying that to her?” I speak aloud, yawning.

‘Like I said, everyone makes mistakes, so it’s possible. Maybe Levi thought she was unconscious? Maybe he believed she couldn’t hear him?’

“Maybe.” It’s incredibly frustrating.

Nothing about Levi adds up. What was his goal in turning some of Alexander’s Wolves to his side? Why target Seraphina and then Hannah? Why did he have such control over Evelyn? There are no clear connections between any of them.

‘Power?’ Nyx mutters.

“Then why hasn’t he come after me or Alexander? He isn’t accomplishing anything by targeting the people he has. Hannah couldn’t even shift, and he knew that!”

The front door swings open, and moments later, Luc’s scent fills the room. He drops onto the sofa opposite me. His hazel eyes study me intently. “Alexander isn’t happy.”

“I know,” I mutter.

“He feels he’s losing the pack.”

“I know.”

He leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees. “That could mean trouble, Athena. For everyone. I’m aware Alexander has his methods, but I’ve seen what happens to angry Alphas. I’ve watched their packs disintegrate.”

“What do you suggest?” I mutter. “Because some members of this pack seem to be forgetting who’s in charge.”

“We go after Levi. Deal with him permanently. Bring Theodore home. Just you and me. In and out. We leave Levi with a bullet in his brain.”

“I’m not doing that. That’s exactly what Levi wants us to do. As much as Theodore is family, he’s safe as long as we don’t intervene. Levi believes Theodore is his mate.”
###Chapter 0428
He glares at me, struggling to hide his irritation.

“You’re missing the point, Luc. This isn’t something we can shoot our way out of. Do you not get that? He’s been planning this for a long time. Whatever it is. Seraphina wasn’t his first victim, and Hannah won’t be his last. Seraphina mentioned others in that prison. We still don’t know what he’s after.”

“At first, we thought it was me. Then he targeted your mate. And now there’s Evelyn. That bastard has manipulated her, and she can’t even see it. Levi is using her, and she’s just going along with it because he’s convinced her he’s keeping her safe.”

“So you want to help her?”

I scowl. “I’m saying I need time to think. There’s more than one thing going on in this pack, isn’t there?” I snap, thinking of the little Lycan fast asleep in his crib upstairs. Shifting in his sleep—I didn’t think it was possible, but Evrin did it.

“Where’s Alexander?”

“Last I saw him, he was talking to Sebastian. Said he needed to speak with his Betas. He’ll be back soon.”

I nod.

“I know I’m an ass, but if you need to talk, I’m listening.” Luc leans back into the couch. “Maybe I can help.”

“It’s nothing.”

He raises an eyebrow. “You’re a terrible liar. You know that, right?”

“And you can be incredibly annoying! Even worse when you haven’t killed anyone.”

“Think of it as keeping me sane. It’s getting harder to be who I am. I’m a Hunter. I used to go out every night. Being here, around Hannah, you, even Brianna… it’s making it impossible to be the man I was raised to be.”

“See? Not all Lycans are monsters.”

He smirks at that.

“So that’s why you want to go after Levi? You need to kill?”

He nods. “I need bloodshed. Hunters thrive on it.”

“Theodore doesn’t.”

“You sure about that?”

“He’s not a killer.”

“He spends a lot of time at the hospital, doesn’t he? Maybe he thrives differently. He wouldn’t make a great Hunter—too calm. But there’s something in him. Good diversion, by the way.”

“I wasn’t trying to divert you.”

“But you did. You might suck at lying, but you’re good at digging. So, what’s on your mind?” I shake my head.

“Come on. I shared something. It’s only fair you do too.”

“Evelyn?” I let out a breath.

“She linked me in her sleep. No one’s ever done that. It was strange. I felt everything she was feeling. Then when she woke up, it was gone. Like she didn’t know she was doing it, but also like she did.”

“Like her mind connected to you on its own?”

I nod.

“Almost like it wasn’t her, but someone else?”

I nod again.

“You have Nyx because you’re an Alpha. Same as Alexander with Titan. Evrin has his, and no doubt Logan will too when it’s time.” He pauses. “Wait, what? Evrin has who?”

“His Lycan spirit.” He smirks. “I thought that was obvious after he shifted.”

Nyx stays silent. I feel her pulling back, though she has nowhere to hide.

‘You knew, didn’t you?’ I snap at her.

‘I didn’t want to worry you.’

“She doesn’t carry Alpha genes,” Luc continues. “Because you’re the last female Alpha.” He twists the ring on his finger. “You’re an only child, right? Besides Seraphina.”

“Yes. Only child from my mother.”

“If she had siblings, you’d know.” He spins the ring faster. He started doing that after I told him to keep his guns out of sight.

“Did your mother have any siblings?”

“I don’t know. I don’t remember. I just remember Dominic. He was raised as my brother, but he was really my uncle… my father’s brother. I don’t remember anyone from my mother’s side. Pretty sure there was no one. Ironically, the best person to ask would be Theodore. He’s been researching my family for years. Is that what you think? That somehow Evelyn is family? Like a cousin or something?”
###Chapter 0429
Alexander

Her blue eyes lift to meet mine as I enter the room. "Did you hear that?" She scoffs.

I nod slowly. I only caught the tail end of Luc's speech. "I didn't need to hear it all. I'd already considered the possibility. But this isn't about that. This confirms everything." I hand Athena the book I'd been carrying under my arm.

Zachary, Sebastian and I had returned to Theodore's house because I knew he'd been researching Athena's past. I wondered if there was a connection between Athena, Evelyn and Levi, especially after Evelyn linked to Athena in her sleep. But there wasn't.

She opens the book and unfolds the pages. Theodore had been busy. While her father's family line was limited, her mother's side was extensive. Name after name stretched back through generations, all the way to Aldous Harrison and beyond.

How Theodore managed to gather so much information was beyond me, but it was his specialty.

"Wow." Her whisper is soft as her fingers trace the family tree. "This is... It goes all the way back..."

"Centuries. You know how Theodore loves his research." I smile at her.

I let her study the names for several minutes before she frowns. "There's no mention of Evelyn or Levi. That's good, right?"

"Yes and no. It means you're not connected to them, thankfully. But it also means we're not making progress in discovering who they are or what they want. Evelyn seems detached, almost unstable since regaining her abilities. She claims to know nothing beyond Levi sending her here, and even that information is limited."

"At least I don't have another half-sibling appearing out of nowhere!" Athena tuts, and I catch the way Luc looks at me. I glare back, and he quickly makes excuses to leave as I sit beside my mate.

She rests her head against my shoulder, her hand sliding onto my thigh. "Is Theodore okay?"

"Yes. He hasn't gotten anything useful from Levi yet, but he's working on it."

"We can't leave him there."

"It won't be forever. Theodore will come home." I drape my arm around her shoulders, pulling her closer. "I'll make sure of that."

"What if--"

"It's not an option, Athena. He's said it himself. He'll never accept Levi."

She falls silent. "Don't lose control," she whispers.

"You listen to Luc too much."

Her eyes search mine. "What does that mean?"

"It means you don't need to worry. We'll figure this out." I kiss the top of her head, and she buries herself against me.

"Evrin shifted again. Luc says he has his Lycan spirit."

'Crap.' Titan mutters. I ignore him. It wasn't necessarily a problem.

"Was Evrin okay?"

Athena nods. "He did it in his sleep. I left him sleeping as a little Lycan. I didn't want to wake him."

'In his sleep?' Titan mutters. 'How is that possible? Is that even a thing?'

'I don't know, but it is now,' I mutter back.

"Evrin will be fine," I tell Athena, and she sighs.

"We don't know what this means. Does it mean he's more powerful than Logan? Does it mean he's the next true Alpha? Logan is first born—I thought that's how it works."

"You're worrying too much. Right now, he's just a baby who's only started walking." I pull her onto my lap so she's facing me, her legs straddling my thighs. "But it's not just him you're worried about, is it? Me, Theodore, Hannah, Zachary, and probably many others." I tuck a strand of her dark hair behind her ear, her blue eyes locking with mine. "It's probably one of the hardest things about being an Alpha. You feel responsible for everyone else. Just as one issue settles, something else comes up. It's a never-ending cycle. I grew up expecting that—you didn't. Though you've adapted to it remarkably well."
###Chapter 0430
Athena turned her face away from me. I gently guided it back. "You can't keep everything locked inside. Some things, yes. But not everything. Having me read your thoughts isn't the same as you actually telling me what's wrong."

"I am not weak anymore," she scowled.

I never said she was.

"Not knowing what Levi wants makes me feel weak. He's part Lycan. I should be able to command him. Or at least link him. It's like he doesn't even exist."

"That would be his Witch half."

"But his Lycan side is still there, right?" She frowned deeply.

"I suspect it depends on how dominant his Witch genetics are. If he's lived his whole life as a Witch, that side is probably stronger. He may have never even shifted."

Her brows furrowed in frustration. "None of the scenarios I imagine feel right. It wasn't like with Gabriel, who was always one step ahead. It isn't like Seraphina, who taunted us from a distance. This man only hurt Hannah. He took Theodore. He convinced a few Wolves to rebel. That's it. If it were you, you wouldn't waste time like this. He'd already be dead. His pack would be gone too."

"You're right. I wouldn't have waited. But we aren't just dealing with Wolves or Lycans. He is part Witch. That changes everything. They play by different rules. Not all are like Madame Zora. And she wasn't exactly innocent either."

"I suppose," she said, shaking her head. "I'm just done with it."

I raised a brow. "Done with it?"

She nodded firmly. "I want it handled. I want him gone. I want Evelyn gone. I want peace. I want to raise my sons without fearing someone will come for them."

"Alright. I will link Theodore. I'll tell him to inform Levi we are ready to make the trade."

'She didn't mention Seraphina,' Titan noted.

'No, she didn't,' I confirmed. I hadn't planned on bringing her up either.

Athena leaned forward, resting her head on my chest. "Thank you."

I reached for the link to Theodore. 'Is now a good time?' I asked, aware his opportunities to speak were limited.

'Yes,' he replied, though his tone felt strained.

'Are you okay?'

'Tired,' he muttered through the link. 'His watch on me has intensified.'

'Anything new?'

'No. He spent the day trying to convince me I'm his mate.' He sounded utterly disgusted.

'It doesn't matter now. Tell him we want to offer a trade.'

'Alexander, I need more time.'

'I'm sorry. I can't give you more time. This needs to end. Athena is right. This has dragged on far too long. Tell him he needs to be at my gates with you by six tomorrow morning.'

'He will refuse.'

'Then tell him his sister will be killed. There will be no hesitation.'

Theodore was silent for a moment. I looked down at Athena. Her eyes were closed. Her lips were slightly parted. Her breathing had settled into a steady, slow rhythm.

'I will tell him.'

I severed the link and remained still. Letting Athena have her moment of peace. I pressed my nose against her hair, inhaling her calming lavender scent. It soothed my own mind. It was a scent I would never grow tired of.

Her body grew heavy against mine as she slipped deeper into sleep. I closed my own eyes just as Theodore linked me again.

'We will be there.'
###Chapter 0431
Theodore

“That’s all he said?” Levi questioned.

“Yes. He expects us there by six tomorrow morning. Or your sister dies. He’s waiting for confirmation.”

He paced back and forth, restless. “Impressive, Theodore. You woke me just to say that. Could’ve stayed quiet. Let him kill Evelyn.”

“He ordered me to tell you. He is my Alpha. I obeyed.”

“Right. But he wouldn’t have known if you kept it secret. As your mate, I think you’re trying to make me happy. Telling the truth. You know I want Evelyn back.” He winked. “But what does your Alpha really want? You, I assume. You’re valuable to him.” He ran a hand through his short blonde hair. “Never had to choose before. My sister or my mate? Difficult.”

“I am not your mate. I gave you my birth name.”

“Theodore, you lie. Not good.” He checked the chains on my wrists. “Tell your Alpha I’ll be there.”

“He won’t hand over Evelyn if I’m not with you.”

“Yes, he will.” Confidence radiated from him. His eyes glowed. “If he knows what’s good for him.”

“You don’t know Alexander like I do. He’ll see I’m not there and tear her apart. I’ve seen it happen.”

“Then he’ll face my wrath. You might not believe it, but I love my sister. Even though she’s difficult. I’ll do anything to keep her alive.”

“You’ve done nothing while she rots in a dungeon.” I muttered, frustrated. He’d given me nothing but coded answers.

He squatted before me, leaning close. His breath was stale. He needed to brush his teeth. “But she’s safe there. Everyone is safe while she’s locked up. It would be a bloodbath if she got out.” He stood. “Tell your Alpha we’ll be there. I’ll decide when everything is revealed.”

I linked Alexander and confirmed.

“You keep saying she’s safe in the dungeon. What does that mean? Why no hurry to get her out? Why a bloodbath? You think she can kill everyone?”

“No need to hurry when I know where she is.” He didn’t elaborate. Odd. I didn’t buy it. I needed to know why Evelyn was safer inside. And why everyone else was, too.

“She’s a Lycan. You confirmed it. She confirmed it.”

“Yes.”

“Is she a weapon?”

He smiled. “Don’t worry, Theodore. I’ll keep you safe. She won’t hurt you. She won’t be allowed to.”

Allowed? He thought he was powerful enough to stop her.

“Are you afraid of her? Is that why you blocked her abilities? You said it was because she touched your things. I don’t believe that. You’re hiding something.”

“So curious. All will be revealed in time. Get some sleep. Early start tomorrow.”

“I can’t sleep with your riddles. Is my pack in danger?”

“Haven’t decided.”

“You decide? You said Evelyn could cause a bloodbath.”

He smiled. His wide sage green eyes looked unhinged. Why would the Moon Goddess think he was my match?

“Who are you after?” I pushed. No answer. “I could tell Alexander to kill her!”

He grabbed my face roughly, lifting me off the floor. Strength surprised me. “You will do no such thing. Understand!”

He dropped me with a thud and strode out. He returned with a syringe. “Better yet, let’s make sure you can’t!”

Levi stabbed the needle into my neck before I could react. Instantly, weakness washed over me. My senses faded. I tried to link Alexander. Nothing.

“Another reason I’m glad I’m not your mate!” I spat.

A sharp, painful slap hit my face. It burned. A red handprint marked my skin. One that wouldn’t heal for days.
###Chapter 0432

My jaw clicked painfully as I worked it open and closed. Not broken, just throbbing. "Stop lying to me," he snarled.

"You think hitting me will make me talk?" I shot back, my voice sharp. "You know nothing about me. If we were truly mates, you'd be disgusted with yourself right now."

"You're not making it easy to love you at this moment," he growled.

"Love?" I scoffed. "Is this how your Lycan side behaves when you don't get your way?" I yanked against the heavy chains binding my wrists. "You keep claiming your Witch side is stronger, but I'm starting to doubt that. You use your magic to suppress your Lycan nature, but it's failing. You're angry because you can't control me, and now I understand why!"

"Why?"

"Planning to beat the answer out of me?" I sneered.

He didn't respond, just settled back into the chair by the door. He kicked off his boots and propped his feet on the coffee table. His eyes never left me. He wanted to ask, but hesitation held him back. Until now, he had been the one with all the information. I wondered how he'd react when he discovered I was a Hunter. Especially after how he'd punished Hannah for being involved with one.

I met his gaze steadily. Occasionally, the corners of his lips would twitch upward as if he enjoyed the silence, but then they'd flatten when I remained quiet.

Finally, he moved, positioning himself directly in front of me. "You're hiding something."

"Only from you. I suppose it's not a secret, just information you lack."

"Tell me."

"No."

"Tell me now," he demanded. I shook my head. "Is it about you or the pack?"

I shrugged. He clearly hated being kept in the dark. This could work to my advantage.

He laughed roughly, dragging a hand through his hair. "You're incredibly frustrating."

"The feeling is mutual," I muttered. "You're not offering me anything. Why should I give you anything in return?"

"Now I see why you've never found a mate until now," he said with a smug smile.

I stayed silent. I didn't need another slap.

"Tell me your secret, and I'll tell you about Evelyn."

I pressed my lips together and shook my head. The closer he leaned in, the stronger my desire to end him grew. To gut him and watch everything spill out while he still breathed.

Where did that dark thought come from?

He tapped his fingers on his knee, considering. "Fine. You get one question. I'll swear to answer truthfully, and in return, you tell me your secret."

"Three questions," I countered. This could get me killed.

"Two," he replied.

"Three."

"Fine. Three," he finally agreed.

"Who in Obsidian Howl are you after?"

"Evelyn."

I rolled my eyes. "Now who's lying?"

"It's not a lie."

"Why did you want Seraphina to lead you here?"

"I didn't."

I stared. He hadn't let Seraphina lead him to Obsidian Howl. Which meant Evelyn had. When Alexander and I spoke last night, he mentioned that Luc had confirmed Evelyn was telling the truth about not knowing what Levi wanted. But she would be telling the truth if it was her plan—she might not know Levi's full agenda.

"Final question," he mused.

"I'm thinking." How could I warn Alexander before he released Evelyn from the dungeon? "You attacked Hannah." He seemed surprised by my statement. "Because she was with a Hunter."

"That's not a question."

"But it was your doing. Just like you stripped your sister of her abilities. You claimed it was because she kept touching your things, but it was more than that. You love her because she's family, but she's a threat to you." I watched the color drain from his face as he realized I'd figured it out. "None of this was your plan—it was all hers. You followed her here, not Seraphina. Hannah was just an unfortunate bonus for you."

"Stripping Evelyn of her abilities let her hide better. All the questions she's being asked are about you, not her. She's the mastermind behind everything."

I looked up at him, and everything went dark.
###Chapter 0433
Athena

"Wake up, it's happening." Alexander's lips brush my cheek as I stir.

I blink sleep from my eyes. "What's happening?"

"The exchange."

I sit up abruptly. Confusion clouds my mind. I'd fallen asleep on Alexander, yet now I was in our bed. And I'd only asked him to move the trade forward last night.

Nyx's voice echoes in my mind. "It's happening now? You moved it up?"

"While you slept," Alexander says. "You wanted it sooner. But there's a problem."

"He's not bringing Theodore, is he?"

"He claims he is, but Theodore has vanished from my senses. I've been searching for our connection for the past half hour. Nothing."

"Could Levi have blocked him again?" I ask through another yawn. "After learning Theodore could communicate with you? You don't think he's..."

Alexander shakes his head. "More likely Theodore discovered something. Levi is preventing him from warning us."

I frown and slide out of bed, peeling off yesterday's clothes. Strange that Alexander hadn't undressed me. Perhaps he'd been exhausted too. Or preoccupied with planning this.

"So what's our move? This needs to work in our favor. Not his." I mutter.

And we get to kill him, right? Nyx demands.

'Not yet.' I tell her.

She mentally scoffs. Killing Levi was her sole objective, but would he even come close enough? He wasn't stupid.

"Nyx talking?" Alexander asks.

I nod. "She wants to know when we eliminate him."

Alexander grabs my hand and pulls me against him. His warm skin presses into mine. One hand settles at my throat, holding me in place as his mouth claims mine. I feel him hardening against me, and it takes visible effort for him to step back.

"When this is over, I'm keeping you to myself." He growls and disappears into the closet while I head to the bathroom.

He emerges dressed in a simple black tee and jeans. In his hands are clothes for me. His crimson eyes sweep over my naked form. He doesn't speak, but his smile says everything. I think he secretly loves that I do things backwards, because it gives him more time to watch me.

Alexander stays silent as I dress, but he turns the large armchair toward me and watches intently.

As I pull on the sweatshirt, I frown.

"You don't think we should bring Evelyn from the dungeons, do you?" He asks.

"Not until we confirm Levi actually brought Theodore. That this isn't a trap."

"Agreed. Zachary is already waiting at the dungeon for my signal."

'He knows us too well.' Nyx murmurs, almost annoyed at our predictability.

'He can read our minds.' I retort.

She rolls her eyes as I pull on my boots.

"Ready?" Alexander extends his hand.

We check on the twins first. Evrin had shifted back but now wore a diaper. Alexander squeezes my hand. "After I put you to bed, I checked on them. He was human again."

"We can't leave them." I mutter just as footsteps sound on the stairs.

Brianna appears carrying Luca. "That's why I'm here. Now go bring Theodore home."

Alexander and I walk hand in hand across the grounds. No one is visible, but the scents of wolves and Lycans are strong. They're hiding. Waiting for Alexander's command.

We reach the gates where Caleb is already on duty.

"No sign yet." He tells Alexander.

Alexander checks his watch and links me, 'Four minutes.'

I nod silently. My eyes remain fixed on the road leading to our gates. The view is clear. With four minutes remaining, Levi should already be approaching.

At two minutes, rustling comes from the trees. Theodore is shoved forward. Chains bind his wrists. His usually deep green eyes are now a dull grey. He moves uncoordinatedly, feet scuffing the ground, stumbling as if in a trance. It reminds me of how Seraphina described the prison nurses.

Levi steps from the trees, cheeks puffed. "Sorry, we almost didn't make it. Harder to walk with this one than I expected."
###Chapter 0434

"You're joking, right?" I stare at him.

He gives me a twisted smile. "Don't you find it amusing?"

I remain silent.

Levi's eyes dart between me, Alexander, and Caleb. "Where is my sister?"

"What did you do to him?" Alexander demands, pointing at Theodore.

"Nothing permanent. He'll recover fully in a few days. He won't even remember we were here."

"You harmed him?" I ask. He claimed to be Theodore's mate yet hurt him. Some men were truly despicable.

"I couldn't risk him sending you secret messages, could I?" Levi beams. "Now, where's my sister?"

"She's in the dungeon," Alexander replies.

'This is a trap!' Nyx exclaims.

"Well hurry up and bring her to me," Levi commands.

I step closer to the gate, gripping the bars. "Why are you doing this? We don't know each other."

"You're right. We're strangers," Levi mutters.

"Why Hannah?"

"Right place, right time." He smiles coldly. "Don't tell me you've never taken advantage of a situation. I wouldn't believe that. I've heard all about you, Athena. I know how you enjoy tearing out hearts."

"Theodore told you that?"

"No."

Julian told Seraphina. Seraphina probably told him. Alexander links me.

Levi shakes his head. "Theodore refused to give me information no matter how I pressed him. It's annoying how he treats me. I am his mate."

I snort. He was insane.

"You find that funny?" He frowns.

"I think you have a twisted understanding of what mates are." I glance at Theodore, who sways slightly, head bowed. He was both present and absent.

"None of this makes sense," I mutter to Alexander.

"It doesn't need to make sense," Levi smiles. "Now, bring me my sister or I'll kill you all."

"Your sister for Theodore," Alexander spits.

"No."

"It's a trade," Alexander frowns.

"I want both. My sister and my mate. It's cruel to make me choose. I wouldn't expect you to choose between Athena and Julian or Athena and Isabella."

"That's not how this works," Alexander growls. I understood his anger. This man had infiltrated our pack, learning everything about us.

"Wrong. This is how it doesn't work for you. I leave with both."

"He's not your mate!"

Levi points at Alexander. "I've heard that before. Theodore denies it too. But I can smell him. It's the most intoxicating scent. Someone is lying, and I hate lies."

"Says the constant liar," I mutter.

"You're mistaken. I'll let that slide this time." Levi's eyes narrow. "I bend the truth, but I don't lie. I share only what I want."

"You make prisoners believe they're your mates. Isn't that a lie?"

He frowns deeply.

'Does he genuinely not consider that lying?' Nyx wonders.

I watch Theodore. His eyes lift toward me. The grey fades, replaced by his usual deep green. Whatever Levi gave him wasn't as effective as planned.

Theodore's swaying slows. He blinks several times as Levi demands Alexander fetch Evelyn.

"I'll get her if you hand over Theodore," Alexander states. "It's simple."

"You don't understand, Alexander. This isn't your decision. It's mine. I'm leaving with both."

Hook to Alexander. 'We can't let him take both.'

"I can protect him," Levi continues. "He'll have the best life with me. I'll provide everything he needs. Trust me, he'll be safer with me."

"You call this safe? He's bound and drugged. You're delusional. I am your Alpha." I glare. "You might not feel it now, but I will make you feel it. I will make you suffer."

He laughs. "Go get my sister, princess."

"Don't!" Theodore shouts. "She's behind all of this!"
###Chapter 0435
Alexander

My gaze fixed on Theodore.
He was shaking his head at me violently while watching Levi.
"She's dangerous."
He dodged as Levi attempted to grab him.
"Everyone remains safe only if she stays in the dungeons. Do not release her."

'What in hell does that mean?' Titan demanded as we watched Theodore evade Levi again.

I yanked on the gates, forcing them open and squeezing through the narrow gap just as Levi pulled a blade from his jeans and lunged at Theodore once more.

"Theodore." Athena whispered, her voice cracking as his name escaped her lips.

I looked up to see the blade protruding from Theodore's chest.
His shirt rapidly darkened with blood oozing from the wound.
He staggered backward, only for Levi to seize him and keep him upright.

"You bastard!" I roared.
My eyes shifted from him to Theodore.
The color was draining swiftly from his skin.

Levi merely frowned at me.
"Look what you made me do!"
He continued holding Theodore upright.
"You forced me to kill my mate. You left me mateless. You took him from me. You will pay for this."

I simply stared at him.
How could he blame me when he had just stabbed Theodore?

'Theodore is right. This man is completely unhinged.' Titan scoffed.

Athena pushed past me.
I grabbed her hand, preventing her from moving forward.
I couldn't risk him stabbing her too.
Her blue eyes met mine and I shook my head.

'He's killed Theodore' She whispered through the link.
I could see her fighting back tears, and I had to use all my strength to stop her from throwing herself forward.

'Look at the blade's angle. It should have missed Theodore's heart.' I muttered, even though Theodore had stopped moving and his head hung low.
'There's still a chance.' At least I hoped there was.

Levi combed his fingers through Theodore's long dark hair.
He begged him to open his eyes.
"I can fix this Theodore. Just open your eyes."
He tapped Theodore's cheek, pleading desperately.

"You stabbed him, you idiot!"

"Because he shouldn't have done that. He shouldn't have listened to you. He shouldn't have been awake."
Levi's eyes flicked up to me and he growled.
"I will ensure she gets out and tears your pack apart."

"No you won't." Athena growled back at him.
"I am your Alpha and you will obey my commands. You will listen and follow my orders. Look at me!"

"What are you doing to me?!" Levi demanded, his wide eyes shifting to Athena.

"Reminding you of your place." Athena snapped.
"Release Theodore." She ordered.

Levi trembled as he fought the command, but his body was forced to lower Theodore to the ground regardless of his will.
"I am a Witch. You can't do this!"

"No, you are only part Witch!" Athena growled back at him.
"I've been wondering why I couldn't reach your Lycan half and now it's obvious. You need to be at your weakest. You need to be vulnerable. When your Witch half fails, your Lycan thrives, no longer blocked by that foolish spell."
Her eyes darkened as she stared at him.
It had been some time since I'd seen Nyx so close to the surface.

"Release him." Athena demanded.

Levi's fingers withdrew from Theodore, leaving scratches across his arm.
"You bitch!" He growled, but forced himself to straighten up when from the corner of my eye, I saw Theodore rip the blade from his own chest and slash it straight across Levi's abdomen.

Levi frantically clutched at his wound, thick crimson blood spilling freely over his hands as Theodore faced him.
"I will never be your mate even if you were the last man on Earth. But I want to be the last thing you see."
He took the blade and drove it through Levi's left eye, forcing it as deep as possible.

With a smile, Theodore's legs buckled beneath him, dropping him to the ground while Levi's body fell in the opposite direction.
It hit the ground with a dull, heavy thud.
###Chapter 0436

"Is he dead?" Athena whispers.

I gesture for Caleb to check Levi while I move to Theodore.

"Dead." Caleb mutters seconds after pressing his fingers to Levi's throat.

"Double check." I mutter, pulling Theodore's shirt open to find his chest already healing. Relief washes over me. "He's alive."

"Are you sure?" Athena asks.

"One hundred percent." I watch his wounds knit together with unnatural speed. Sometimes I forgot how fast he could heal. It was almost as quick as me.

"And this bastard is definitely gone." Caleb tells me. "What the hell was he playing at?"

Hollow gasps rattle from Theodore's chest before he finally takes a deep breath. "He wasn't playing or plotting, at least not anymore." Theodore croaks. "He was only ever here to watch his sister. He had no plans for any of us. Except me."

"But what about Hannah?" Athena presses.

"She was just collateral damage. He took advantage of the situation." His breathing remains slightly wheezy. My guess is Levi managed to puncture a lung. "Evelyn wanted Seraphina to come here."

"Why?"

"That's what I don't know. I don't think he really knew either."

"That makes no sense. He released her from prison." Athena states.

"I don't think he did. I believe it was her." Theodore coughs and spits blood. "He mentioned her being safer in the dungeon, but also said you'd all be safe with her contained. He warned that if she escaped, it would be a bloodbath now that she has her abilities. I thought he controlled her, but I think it's the opposite. Or perhaps they controlled each other in different ways."

"Luc would have detected the lies. She already deceived him once."

"Not if the questions specifically concerned Levi and his plans. She wouldn't have known because they were never his—they were hers." He rolls onto his side and frowns at Levi's body.

"She's a Lycan. I can control her." Athena mutters.

I raise a hand to Athena. "So he suppressed her abilities to protect her? That's why he never tried to retrieve her. Evelyn is locked away, but he wanted to stay close just in case."

"Not just for her." Theodore coughs and spits more blood.

"So in some twisted way, he was trying to help?" Caleb scoffs.

"Until he discovered we were mated." Theodore says, his hand moving to his mark. "I feel much better now that he's marked me." He glances at Levi's body. "I'm glad he never got the chance to—"

I look over at Levi. The blade remains lodged in his eye, and the wound on his abdomen continues to bleed. But something feels wrong.

'Zachary, is Evelyn still in the dungeon?'

'Yes. Are you ready for her?'

'No, change of plans. Is she okay? Or is she upset?'

'She's furious. She knows my presence means something.'

She would be upset if she just felt her brother die. I glance back at Levi's lifeless form. Something seems off.

"Can you stand?" I mutter to Theodore.

"I think so. Damn. I don't want to get stabbed in the chest again." He rubs the wound.

I offer him a hand and pull him to his feet as Athena throws her arms around his waist. She tells Theodore how relieved she is to see him.

"Everyone, move to the other side of the gate. Caleb, do you have a lighter or matches?"

"I think so." He searches the small office by the gates and returns with a matchbox. "Am I missing something?"

"Ever dealt with Witches before?" I ask.

"Can't say I have. Always taught to avoid them."

"What's happening?" Athena asks as I strike a match and watch the small orange flame appear. I toss it at Levi, and it lands on his chest. He ignites in a ball of orange fire.

"It's not him." Theodore scowls, suddenly understanding my actions. "No, it certainly is not."
###Chapter 0437
Theodore

"That's impossible. How could it not be him?" Athena demands. "I saw him stab you. I watched you kill him. You stabbed him right through the eye!"

"It's..."

"Are you suggesting this was one of his powers?" Caleb asks.

"Yes." I glance at Alexander, hoping he might explain it better than I can. "Are you telling me it's a twin?" Athena searches my expression, desperate for answers.

I turn back to the fire. Not even the slightest scent of burning flesh. That's what I would have expected if it were truly him.

"Alexander?" Athena asks. "I don't get it."

"Theodore didn't kill him." He tells her.

"I was right there. I saw it happen."

"It's called astral projection." Caleb explains.

"Astral projection? He stabbed Theodore!" Athena mutters.

Alexander cups her face and tilts it up until their eyes meet. "Remember how I told you Witches possess different abilities?"

"Yes, but..."

"He was never physically here, Athena. His projection was powerful enough to wield a weapon. That's why there's no smell of burning flesh. It's why when the fire dies, the body will either remain or vanish completely, leaving only the blade behind."

Right on cue, the blade clatters to the ground. I watch the flames slowly die out. Nothing remains but the blade, exactly as Alexander predicted.

"So he can be in two places at once?" Athena asks as Alexander moves toward the blade.

"Yes, though it could be more locations depending on his strength." I reply.

"If he wasn't actually here, how was I able to make him release you?"

"Because you found his weakness. From what I understand, projecting requires immense energy. When he believed he had killed me, it weakened him significantly. The problem is, now he's aware of that vulnerability and will likely find a way to prevent it from happening again."

"So if he wasn't targeting us before, he definitely is now?" Caleb asks.

"Yes. Possibly just me and Evelyn, maybe all of us." I frown and scan our surroundings. "The most concerning part is, I don't even remember how I returned here."

"You were in some kind of trance." Alexander mutters as he removes his tee and wraps it around his hand. He carefully picks up the blade and brings it back to us. "Your eyes turned grey and you could barely walk. I suspect he drugged you."

"He administered something after I confirmed he would meet with you. It suppressed my Wolf, but there was a moment when I started asking questions and he became furious because I figured things out. Everything went black after that, and then I woke up here."

"Athena, Theodore, return to the house." Alexander instructs. "I need to speak with the sister." He examines the blade, turning it over in his hands. "Caleb, alert us if there's any sign of him or anyone else."

Caleb nods. "At least I know what the bastard looks like now."

Athena quickens her pace to match my long strides. "How do you know so much about Witches?"

"Truthfully, I'm not entirely certain."

"What does that mean?"

"Information about Witches is scarce. There are no books about them, similar to the limited knowledge about Lycans. Yet some knowledge feels instinctive, like it's always been there." I press a finger against my temple.

"But you enjoy research, so perhaps you learned it at some point."

"Is the bastard dead?" Luc asks, rising to his feet as we approach the pack house. He crosses his arms over his chest, staring us down. "I assume he must be since you're standing here."

"No." I groan.

"Why not?"

"He projected himself."

"Interesting." He mutters. "Where's Alexander?"

"Gone to question Evelyn." Athena tells him.

"Oh shit, so the bastard lost you and his sister. He's probably furious right now. I know I would be." He purses his lips. "Now can Athena and I go kill him?"

"You just said it yourself. He's beyond angry. Do you really think you can just walk in there and kill him?"

"Who said anything about walking in? I have guns with longer range than a pistol."

My eyes shift to Athena. Ultimately, it wasn't my decision to make, but I hoped she would recognize how reckless this idea was.

She shakes her head. "Luc, I know you think that's the easy solution. But I disagree. What if the person you shoot is just another projection? What if it's a trap? What if it's exactly what he wants us to do?"
###Chapter 0438

"He expected you to show up." I inform her. "If anything, he was irritated that you didn't. He has enough syringes loaded with drugs to eliminate more than just this pack. He could potentially turn every single one of us Human."

"Did he intend for it to wear off so fast? Was that part of his plan?"

"I doubt it. He appeared genuinely shocked when he noticed the drugs had left my system. That's why he stabbed me."

"It's because he's a Hunter." Luc shrugs casually as if stating an obvious fact.

"What does that change?"

"Seriously, Mister Research." Luc rolls his eyes dramatically. "You've mapped her entire bloodline for centuries, yet you never bothered to investigate your own heritage?"

"I've been slightly occupied."

"You heal quickly, correct?"

"I suppose. I always considered it luck."

Luc gives another exaggerated eye roll. "You're a Hunter. Despite how wrong that title feels for you. Hunters heal fast. We recover like Alphas because we're our own breed. Have you ever seen me injured?"

"That's why the drugs didn't last in his system?" Athena scowls.

"Exactly."

"But there's more you should understand about Hunters." His eyes scan the surrounding area cautiously. "Perhaps we should continue this inside."

He motions toward the door and Athena enters first. She leads us into the office and takes Alexander's chair behind the desk. "Well?"

"This is information I never imagined would be relevant."

"Just say it, Luc." I snap impatiently. I'm exhausted and need rest to clear my thoughts.

"If you haven't researched yourself, I assume you know little about Hunters in general?"

"I never needed to. Usually when I ask, you tell me what I want to know."

He perches on the edge of the desk, much to Athena's visible irritation. "Hunters don't exclusively hunt Rogues."

"What?"

"Actually, that's not entirely accurate. Some Hunters don't hunt Rogues at all."

"What are you implying?" Athena demands. "Because I'm clearly missing something."

"It doesn't help when Luc insists on being theatrical!"

"Look who's growing a backbone after making a successful kill!" He smirks.

"LUC!" Athena warns sharply.

"Fine. You spent days with Levi. What did you learn?"

"He's completely unhinged!"

"Anything else?"

"We're mated!"

"Are you certain about that?" Luc raises an eyebrow skeptically.

"He bears a mark with my initials."

"Does he now?"

"He showed me."

"See, that's where things get interesting. Witches do have marks."

"The mark displays their mate's initials. Yes, I know. I lied and gave him a false name, but I don't think he believed me."

"That's not entirely accurate."

"That's what you told Alexander. You said the mark evolves into their mate's initials over time." Athena frowns.

"I said I believed that, but now I'm not so sure. Otherwise there would be more Witches around, and he'd likely be mated to another Witch to preserve bloodlines."

"Luc, just say it plainly. These cryptic answers make me want to rip out your tongue!" Athena glares darkly. Or perhaps it was Nyx emerging through her darkened eyes. When did that start happening again?

"So I've been wondering why you're unaffected by Lycans. In fact, you're insatiably curious about them, which disgusts me slightly. But regardless, you're a Hunter. There's a reason you withstand Levi's nonsense. That mark he showed you? I don't believe it's a mate mark. He's still half Lycan. Clearly he wasn't raised to understand this. I think I was wrong. I believe the initials belong to his destined killer, not his mate."

"What?" Athena presses urgently. I couldn't tell if her shock came from Luc admitting error or from his revelation about me.

"Theodore isn't just any Hunter. He's a Witch Hunter."
###Chapter 0439

Alexander

Evelyn huddles at the back of her cell when I enter the dungeons. She draws her knees tightly against her chest, hiding her face from view.

“She stopped crying not long ago.” Zachary informs me from his stool at the far end. “But she shifted again. More claw marks up top.” He gestures toward the ceiling of her cell. “Is the bastard dead?”

I shake my head. “It’s complicated.”

I pause outside her cell, examining the deep gouges. They cluster around the ceiling as if she tried to dig her way out. She’ll have a tough time. Concrete encases reinforced bars. No one else escapes.

“My brother’s alive, isn’t he? He was here. Now he’s gone.” Her whisper is muffled by her arms still hiding her face.

“You tell me. You’ve been lying, Evelyn. Do you even know what truth is?”

“I’m not—”

“Enough. I know you’re behind everything. Why manipulate Seraphina into bringing you here? Who’s your target?”

“I came for help. That’s true.”

“Keep lying, and I’ll open this cell. I’ll drag this blade from your neck to your navel. Very, very slowly.” I lift the blade. She finally raises her head. Fresh claw marks mar her face, healing slowly.

Her eyes fix on the blade. “You can’t hurt me with that.”

“Don’t test me.”

She shakes her head. “You literally can’t. The handle has marks. They prevent it from touching my skin.”

I examine the handle. She’s right. Strange symbols are carved into the wood. “Why?”

She shrugs. “Levi made it for me. For protection. But it could never be used against me. He never actually let me use it. Decided I didn’t need protection when I had him.”

“Protection from who?”

She drops her head onto her knees, silent.

“Evelyn!”

She says nothing. I’m tempted to rip the door open and test her theory. Then I remember Theodore’s warning. Her escape would mean a bloodbath. But why?

“Everyone and no one.” she whispers.

“What does that mean?” Zachary moves closer. “How can you need protection from everyone and no one?”

“From yourself? Is that it? Or from Levi and his projection powers?” I demand.

Her grey eyes widen, flicking up to meet mine. “He’s mastered it?”

‘Is this a trick?’ Zachary links.

‘I don’t know.’

Evelyn scowls, burying her face in her legs. Her mouth opens and closes, searching for words. “If he’s mastered it after all this time… I don’t know what happens now.”

“Tell us the real reason you came here.” Zachary presses.

“It was my plan to come. Not for the reasons you think. Levi didn’t know. I never told him. I knew he’d follow. I have to stay close. That’s what he does. I made Seraphina believe he’d follow her. I didn’t want her to know it was really me.”

“Why?”

“I don’t know.”

“You can’t keep saying that. You know what you’re doing. Why withhold information?” Zachary snaps. “You’re speeding up your own death.” He looks at me. “We should bring Luc in. Her answers make no sense. One minute her brother will come for her. The next she’s a mess.”

I agree. Her story is falling apart. What do you think? I ask my Wolf.

‘I’m thinking of Athena.’ Titan replies.

‘Okay.’

Just like when we first met her. She stayed quiet about her suffering. She knew speaking up would make things worse. We saw what her family was like. Maybe Athena is right. Maybe Levi messed with Evelyn’s mind.’ He nods. ‘But that doesn’t make it Evelyn’s truth.’

I take Zachary’s stool and sit directly before Evelyn’s cell.

“I did like Seraphina.” she mutters softly. “I didn’t want to use her. I had no choice.”

“We all have choices. One of you is lying, or you’re both stupid enough to play each other. That never works.”

“I’m telling the truth about this!”

“About this?”

She nods. “I couldn’t even link the Alpha. When she told me Athena was her half-sister. I saw an opportunity.” She buries her face in her hands and screams. Her fingers claw at her skin, digging and scratching until blood surfaces.

“GET OUT GET OUT GET OUT!”

She tears at her clothes, screaming and clawing her skin as she writhes on the floor. It reminds me of Julian fighting his Wolf.

“Evelyn, stop!”

Her grey eyes meet mine, glazing over as she continues to dig into herself.

“What do we do?” Zachary asks.

“We see what happens.”

“GET OUT!” She screeches again as claws sprout from her fingers. Dark fur bursts from her skin. She screams through breaking bones.

I’ve watched Athena shift. I’ve watched my own son. Neither made this much noise. Athena said it was the most painful experience.

The process takes thirty minutes. A massive Lycan lies stretched on the floor. Her breathing is heavy. Her eyes remain closed. Zachary looks from her to me. “What now?”

“We wait.”

Another thirty minutes pass before movement. Her fingers twitch. The twitching spreads to her arms. Her eyes open. She continues lying there.

I watch her nostrils flare. She inhales the scents around her. Slowly, she sits up, staring at us. Neither Zachary nor I speak. I’m not sure if Evelyn can hear us.

My grip tightens on the blade’s handle. I prepare for an attack. But she just watches us, as if we’re the ones in a cage. She runs her tongue over sharp teeth as she stands. She’s definitely larger than the average Lycan.
###Chapter 0440
Zachary

Her gaze remains fixed on me from inside the cell.
Evelyn had been watching both of us for some time.
But once her grey eyes locked onto mine, I became her sole focus.

‘Rogue?’ Alexander links through our mind connection.
‘No. Luc would have detected it instantly, and so would I.’

I study the cell.
The deep claw marks at the top made sense now.
She must have been over eight feet tall in her shifted form.
It was difficult to tell while she remained seated.
The rest of us typically reached around seven feet when fully shifted.

“Can you speak?” Alexander asks her.
Her eyes briefly flicker toward him before returning to me.

“Perhaps we need Athena,” I murmur.

“I’ll ask her to come down,” Alexander says, frowning.

Evelyn gives a sharp nod, as if she knew exactly who we meant.
She doesn’t move while we wait, but her eyes never leave me.
It’s starting to unsettle me.

Athena’s footsteps are soft as she descends the stairs.
“What did you need—” She cuts herself off when she sees Evelyn’s Lycan form. “She shifted again?”

“She doesn’t appear to have control over it,” Alexander explains.

“But she’s aware enough to remove her clothes first?” Athena gestures toward the discarded clothing in the corner.

Alexander sighs. “Yes, it seems so.”

Athena suddenly raises a hand toward Evelyn. “I am speaking to my mate.”

I glance into the cell and see Evelyn bow her head in submission.
This was new.
She had shown anger, frustration, even tears before.
But accepting dominance was different.
Maybe it was the Lycan in her.
Maybe she couldn’t refuse.
Or maybe she was finally realizing she couldn’t win.
It had taken long enough.

“She just shifted?” Athena asks Alexander.

“She screamed and demanded we leave. Then this happened,” Alexander says, gesturing toward Evelyn.

“We all knew she was a Lycan,” I murmur.
Evelyn’s grey eyes flicker toward me.
“But she’s significantly larger than the rest of us. Could she be something more?”

Athena moves closer to the cell.
Evelyn continues watching me until Athena addresses her directly.

“Who are you?”
“What do you want?”

Athena falls silent for a moment.
Then she instructs Alexander and me to turn around.
“No one wants an audience if shifting causes pain.”

We turn and face the opposite cells.
A low growl escalates into a piercing howl.
It’s quickly replaced by a human scream, followed by sobbing.

“Get dressed,” Athena says firmly. “You need to provide clear answers.”

“I can’t,” a whispered reply echoes through the dungeon.

“You mean you won’t,” Athena presses.

“No, I can’t. I didn’t lie. I came here for help. That is the truth.”

“First you said you came for help, then you claimed your brother sent you. Now you’re back to saying it was for help. Which is it?” Athena demands.

“Help. I need help.” Her voice cracks with emotion.

“Then why threaten us with your brother?”

“You were going to kill me. He always promised to protect me. But this… the monster… It hurts so much. Is this what he was shielding me from?”

I turn to see Evelyn sitting on the floor.
One leg is folded awkwardly beneath her while she hugs the other.
Tears well in her grey eyes.

“Levi followed you here?” I ask.

She points to her neck. “I think he implanted something in me. I believe he does it to many people, to monitor them.”

‘A tracker?’ I link Alexander.

‘Possibly,’ he replies, though he seems deep in thought about something else. “The farm? You or Levi?”

“Levi at first, to prevent anyone from escaping. Seraphina wasn’t the first, but she was the first I liked. That’s why I helped her. She reminded me of myself. I thought maybe he wouldn’t notice if I helped just one. The others… they were different. Dangerous, even without Wolves and Lycans. My job was to keep them occupied until Levi came for them. That was my role. And I got to stay on my little farm.”

Her eyes settle on Athena. “Seraphina told me who you were. I thought… I thought this would be my salvation. But I knew I had to lie. To her, to him, to everyone.”

“That’s the problem with too many lies,” I tell her. “You unravel, and you end up in deeper trouble. The kind that gets you killed.”

“What do you want?” Athena demands.

“I just wanted to reach you. It took so long to persuade Seraphina to come here. I truly believed she would walk away after we traveled so far. I knew there was a chance you would kill her. I took that risk because I thought if I could just get her to show me where you were, then maybe I could convince everyone she’s not who she used to be. I didn’t consider my own death a possibility. I thought… it doesn’t matter now. I know you won’t help me.”
###Chapter 0441

"You believed we would simply welcome a total stranger into our home?" Alexander demands.

"You are both Alphas. I hoped... I prayed one of you might understand."

"He used the word bloodbath. Warned us you would break free and slaughter everyone."

She locks her fingers together, twisting them nervously as she searches for a response. Her words are nearly inaudible when she mutters that Levi told her she was dangerous.

"Did you kill someone at the prison?"

She gives a quick nod. "I had to."

"You had to?" Athena presses.

"Yes. I..." She draws a sharp breath and shuts her eyes. "It wasn't what I told Seraphina. It was a nurse, that part was true. He came in at night." Her lip curls and her gaze hardens. "Touched me when he believed I was asleep. I saved a fork. When he sneaked into my room again, I waited for the right moment and drove it into his throat."

Her eyes flick up to meet mine. "I yanked it out and made certain he never left that room as he choked on his own blood."

It was somewhat surprising she wasn't a Rogue.

"I ran. Levi found me. He didn't force me to go back, though. I was too much of a liability." She drops her gaze and blinks several times. "He made me like this, didn't he? Levi twisted my mind until it no longer belongs to me."

"Yes," Athena mutters. "It's what abusers do, especially when they've been at it for years." She turns to glance at Alexander before vanishing up the stairs. He follows her, leaving me alone with Evelyn.

"Why do they keep saying that?" Evelyn asks softly.

"Because it's true, and if anyone can confirm it, Athena can. Levi has used you. He manipulates you into doing his dirty work with empty promises of safety and protection. But he hasn't kept you safe at all."

"He talks to me. I hear him. It's because my abilities have returned. I wouldn't have shifted into that... Lycan otherwise. And the Alpha wouldn't have been able to hear my thoughts."

"What does Levi say when he speaks to you?"

"That he will free me. That he's working on it." She hunches her shoulders. "Something about a mate. Sometimes he sounds furious. He blames me for something."

"For what?"

"I don't know. His voice can be deafening, sometimes it's barely a whisper. Other times it vanishes completely."

"Have you always heard him?"

She shakes her head. "Only when he wanted me to."

I move toward the steps.

"Don't go. I hate being alone down here."

"You were alone on the farm."

"It was different there. I had freedom. You don't have to speak to me. I can just sit quietly."

I take a seat on the wooden stool, crossing my arms over my chest. She lowers her eyes. "How do you expect us to believe anything you say?"

Her forehead creases into a frown. "I don't expect you to. I tried to play games. I attempted to deceive my own brother. If someone here doesn't kill me, he probably will."

Evelyn lets out another whimper. "It's happening again."

Frantically, she tears off her clothes as she screams. She tries to curl into a ball, but the cracking bones prevent it. I watch her roll onto her stomach and push herself up onto her hands and knees. The screams are agonizing to hear, and I've witnessed Rogues tear living beings apart.

The screams blend with roars of pain as her body contorts in ways it didn't last time. I couldn't bear to listen any longer.

"Hey, listen to me!"

As her body continues to jerk violently, her eyes find mine.

"Stop fighting it."

"I can't," she cries out between screams. "It's not me."

"Evelyn, it is you. It is your Lycan, no one else's. You have control. Let it out or shut it down!"

Tufts of black fur begin to sprout along her legs as they lengthen and widen. She hurls herself back against the wall, her claws scraping against the ground. "STOP STOP STOP. You can't do this to me!"

She releases one final whimper and goes still.

The tufts of fur recede and her legs begin to shrink. She slides over until she's lying on her side, drawing her knees to her chest, sobbing and hyperventilating.

"There's a blanket right behind you."

Without looking, she reaches behind her, fumbling for the small piece of fabric, and drags it over her naked body. A few more of her bones snap back into place, but this time, she only cries.

"Were you talking to him? Was that who you were telling to stop making you shift?"

She lowers the blanket just enough for me to see her eyes. "No."

"You were telling yourself?"

"No, I was telling the voice in my head."
###Chapter 0442

Athena

"Wait." Alexander's hand closed around my wrist, halting my angry stride. "Stop."

I turned, frustration burning in my veins. "Why can't she see it? If she's telling the truth, why doesn't she realize how wrong his treatment was?"

His crimson eyes held mine. "If she's being honest—and that's a significant if—it's likely due to brainwashing. He manipulated her with promises she believed."

'She's still an idiot.' Nyx muttered. I echoed her words aloud.

Alexander's grip tightened. "Would you have said that about yourself? I understand why you left that dungeon, Athena. It hits too close to home."

"So many bastards in this world," I whispered.

He pulled me against his chest. "You're right. There are."

"Do you believe her?"

"No. I operate on distrust until proven otherwise. Before you stormed out, I was heading to find Luc, as Zachary suggested."

"He's at the house. Trying to convince Theodore he's a Witch Hunter."

Alexander's gaze snapped toward the pack house. "Did I hear that correctly?" I nodded.

"A Witch Hunter?"

"Apparently. Luc said he was wrong before. About the initial marks meaning mates. He thinks because Theodore isn't bothered by Lycans like he is, that makes him a Hunter. He believes Theodore is meant to kill Levi."

Alexander stared, bewildered. I shrugged. "I don't get it either."

"Theodore scented Levi. Levi keeps calling him his mate. You heard him at the gate—he blamed us for stabbing Theodore." Alexander's frown deepened.

"Luc said something about Theodore tolerating Levi's nonsense. And how there would be more Witches if they were all mated to the name on their mark, not fewer."

Screams erupted from the dungeon below.

"Is she shifting again?" I asked, confused. Why force another shift?

"Sounds like it," he muttered.

"Why is her Lycan so large? It's bigger than Zachary's."

"Unknown. But keeping her contained is safest. We can monitor her condition."

Curiosity burned through me. "You go talk to Luc and Theodore. I'll stay with Zachary."

"Stay out of her cell." His eyes demanded agreement.

"I won't enter the cell."

He tipped my chin up, pressing his lips to mine. "I'll be listening."

'Anyone would think we're planning something reckless,' Nyx murmured.

I crept back down the dungeon steps. Just in time to hear Evelyn mention a voice in her head.

Zachary's dark eyes flicked to me. Evelyn was curled under a blanket in human form. Her shift had failed or she'd stopped it.

"Where's Alexander?" Zachary asked.

"Gone to find Luc." Evelyn whimpered at the news. "What voice?" I pressed.

Evelyn hid beneath the blanket. "Just tell me. I won't have to force it."

Could it be Levi? Was he somehow in her head?

"It started yesterday. It woke me. Sometimes she shouts. Sometimes she whispers."

'When she woke us,' Nyx muttered. 'Was her Lycan linking us?'

'She can't have a Lycan spirit without Alpha genes.'

"You said 'she'," Zachary spoke. "Who is she?"

Evelyn shrank against the wall, blanket pulled tight. Only her legs were visible. "She calls herself Dakota. Says she's my Lycan."

"Impossible."

"I'm not lying." Her voice was barely audible.

"You need Alpha genetics for a speaking Lycan. I wouldn't be able to force you to answer me otherwise."
###Chapter 0443

"An Alpha?" Her eyebrows drew together in confusion.
'This is impossible.' Nyx's voice echoed in my mind. 'We are the last female Alpha. There cannot be another.'

"Who are your parents?" I demanded.

"My father was Thomas Reed. I never knew my mother's name." Evelyn's voice trembled slightly. "My father told me she came from a powerful family but wasn't ready for motherhood. He convinced her to carry me to term and promised to raise me alone."

"Levi's surname is Bennett." Zachary muttered under his breath.

"No, that's his middle name. Levi Bennett Reed." Evelyn frowned deeply. "What's happening to me?"

"Just breathe." Zachary instructed firmly. "Keep your mind clear. Don't let her push through."

"What happened to your father?" I asked as she took several deep breaths.

"Heart attack. Even Lycans can't survive that. I was twelve. Levi took care of me." She snorted and shook her head. "But he didn't really, did he?"

"Can Dakota tell you if you have Alpha genes?" I pressed further.

"I'm not sure."

"You have to ask her." Zachary told her. "Just like when you told her to stop shifting."

"Am I an Alpha?" She spoke openly to the room.

Several minutes passed before her eyebrows shot up.

"No." Evelyn finally answered.

'She took too long to answer just to say no.' Nyx growled.

"What else did she say?" I asked curiously.

"I'm not... I'm not an Alpha but I do carry the genes." She shook her head, her grey eyes widening. "How is that possible? You're the Alpha. We're not siblings.'

'No we are not.' Nyx growled fiercely.

My pulse thudded heavily as blood rushed between my ears. If she carried Alpha genes, she had the potential to eliminate me and take my place. Just like Julian would challenge Alexander.

Was this what Levi meant? It could be a bloodbath because she had the power to wipe out everyone including me.

Evelyn stared back at me through the cell bars. Her eyes were wide with fear. Perhaps she thought I would kill her now that she posed a threat.

Zachary strode toward me. "Let's get some fresh air." He turned back to Evelyn. "I'll find you clean clothes."

"You're leaving." She whispered.

"Temporarily. My advice? Get to know your Lycan."

"What's happening?" I murmured as the guard closed and locked the dungeon door behind us.

"I think we need to consult Theodore."

"Why Theodore?"

"He's been working on your family tree."

"You think she's related to me, don't you?"

"Alexander once said you don't get multiple true Alpha Lycans. There's a bloodline." He pointed at me. "So while she might not be a sibling, perhaps she's a distant cousin. The problem is, many things were kept from you. You didn't know who you really were until recently."

"Do you think Levi knows?" I asked as we walked toward the house.

"He certainly knew she was powerful. Though he might not know how powerful."

Inside the house, Theodore, Alexander and Luc were arguing about the Witch Hunter business. I couldn't follow much of their argument due to excessive swearing.

"SHE CARRIES ALPHA BLOOD!" I screamed.

The three men stopped shouting and turned to stare at me and Zachary.

"She has a Lycan called Dakota." I muttered. "There's a good chance we're related." I couldn't believe those words left my mouth.

"I would have detected it." Luc scowled.

"Clearly something's wrong with you! You've missed so much regarding Evelyn!" I snapped back as he glared at me.

"She's not wrong." Zachary confirmed. "Your Hunter skills seem to be slipping. You should have killed Levi when you had the chance."

"My skills are not slipping!" Luc snarled through gritted teeth.

"Are you certain about that?" Zachary challenged.

"You want to challenge me now, Rogue?!" Luc spat venomously.
###Chapter 0444
Zachary

Luc's hands fly to his jeans, instinctively reaching for a weapon that isn't there. He freezes for a split second before letting out a low growl of frustration.

He was actually following Alexander's rules. If I wasn't bracing for his attack, I might have praised his restraint.

"I don't give a damn about your personal issues." Alexander snarls. He shoves between us, his attention locked on Athena. "Explain."

"She hears a voice. Not Cooper's. A female voice. She has a Lycan spirit, Alexander. Just like I have Nyx."

"That's impossible. Your bloodline ended with you. We saw the family records."

"Actually..." Theodore interrupts. "The records are incomplete."

"What do you mean incomplete?" Alexander demands. "There's more?"

"I believe so. I hit a research wall."

"Are you saying I have another sibling?" Athena stares at him in disbelief. "Nyx is absolutely certain Evelyn isn't related to me."

"No, definitely not. Only Seraphina." Theodore confirms. "Your mother had no other children. But certain birth records I obtained suggest your grandparents had another daughter after your mother was born."

"She would still carry the Alpha gene." I mutter. The name leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I hadn't thought about her in weeks. She was fading into a distant memory. "The grandparents would have passed it down through their descendants."

"You think the bastard knew?" Luc asks with a deep frown.

"Evelyn isn't sure. Her father told her that her mother wasn't ready for children. But she carried the pregnancy to term and handed the baby over to her father. He raised her until his death."

"Did Cooper kill him?" Alexander asks.

"Surprisingly, no. Heart attack. Cooper took over her care when she was about twelve."

"Before her first shift?" Athena murmurs. "That seems convenient, doesn't it?"

"It does." Alexander confirms.

I watch Luc. He's pacing with narrowed eyes and deep forehead creases. He looks absolutely furious. Probably because Athena caught him being wrong. How did he miss so much when he claims to see souls?

"But Cooper must know about her abilities, right?" Athena asks. "His tone. His anger at Theodore for telling us to keep her contained."

Everyone nods in agreement.

"What if he projects into the prison and frees her?" Athena frowns and turns to Theodore. "You said he needs strength to wield a blade while projecting. Could he materialize in the dungeons and unlock her cell? Is that how his power works?"

Silence fills the room.

"Someone say something!" Athena snaps.

"I'll watch her." Luc offers.

"Go. But don't you dare harm her." Alexander warns.

"Is that wise?" I ask as Luc storms out.

"He's probably trying to understand how he missed the signs." Alexander takes Athena's hand. "We need to determine if Evelyn is connected to my mate, and how."

"She doesn't know. I don't know." Athena mutters. "Nyx says we're not sisters. Theodore confirmed my mother had no other children."

"I think we need to return to where this began." Alexander tells her.

Fear flashes in her blue eyes. She pulls her hand from his. "Silver Creek?" she whispers.

Alexander nods. "We might find answers there."

"We haven't been back since..." Her voice trails off. I watch her process the suggestion. I haven't seen this much fear in her since she faced going Rogue. Her usual confidence vanishes completely.

I knew how Alexander found her. I knew what Brianna did to her in that house. But I deliberately avoided learning the details.

Alexander cups Athena's face. "Technically, that land belongs to you now."

Athena's eyes drop to the floor. "No one lives there anymore." She whispers to herself. I watch her take a steadying breath. "Okay. But the boys aren't coming."

"Fine. Zachary, Theodore. You're both coming. Pack your things. We leave in one hour."

"One hour? Not tomorrow morning?" Theodore asks.

"It's a few hours' drive. We should get started."

Alexander disappears into his office to make arrangements. Theodore heads for the door. Athena remains frozen in place.

"Are you okay?"

"I haven't... I haven't been back since they tried to kill me." She crosses her arms over her chest and sighs. "Did Victoria ever take you there?"

"No. I wasn't that privileged. But Alexander is right. The place is empty now."
###Chapter 0445

"I understand, it's just..."

"Painful memories?"

She nods slowly. "If Alexander hadn't come to that house, my life would be completely different now. Or I might not even be alive. I would never have awakened my Lycan nature. I likely would have died without ever knowing my true identity. And it's not just about Dominic, Victoria, or even Marcus and the others. That's where I witnessed my parents' murder. The place where I was framed for a crime I didn't commit."

Her blue eyes lock intensely with mine. "How can a single word transport you back so completely?"

"That's how our minds work. But you survived, Athena. You became something they never got to witness. You have hundreds of Lycans here who would follow you into battle without hesitation. They wouldn't need orders—they'd do it willingly."

"Thank you, Zachary." She offers a faint smile.

"You don't need to fear the past, Athena. Everyone from that time is gone. You emerged victorious. This journey is solely about finding answers."

She nods determinedly. "Then I should go pack and ensure the boys are prepared for Brianna."

"Not Sophia and Sebastian?"

"No. They haven't experienced Evrin's shifting yet. I'm not certain they're ready for that."

Alexander drives while Theodore occupies the passenger seat, explaining how and why Luc believes he's a Witch Hunter. I roll my eyes because Luc has been increasingly mistaken lately, and I wouldn't trust anything he says.

"That doesn't add up." Alexander murmurs.

I glance at Athena while listening. She's asleep, using her arm as a makeshift pillow behind her head.

"She's anxious." Alexander observes quietly. "Sleep provides her some relief."

"She mentioned it was the memories." I respond.

"You knew Victoria's nature. If it were up to me, I would have displayed her head on a spike for the life she forced my mate to endure."

"Do you think this will help her find closure?" Theodore asks.

"We'll discover that soon enough."

At the fuel station, we switch drivers so I can take over. When Alexander gets in the back, he pulls a drowsy Athena toward him. She curls against him, resting her head on his lap while his hand protectively covers her stomach. I wonder if either of them knows yet.

Following Alexander's directions, we turn onto a narrow road. The trees and bushes have become so overgrown that we must abandon the car and continue on foot.

The packhouse is significantly smaller than the one at Obsidian Howl. Covered in thick ivy, the entrance is nearly invisible.

"Where are the other houses?" Theodore asks.

"Around back. The layout here is reversed. The main house isn't protected by the others." Alexander explains.

I tear the ivy from the door and push it open. The musty scents of dust, death, and decay fill the air. Theodore gags upon entering, and I suppress a laugh. "Are you certain you're a Wolf?" I tease. "It was unexpected." He mutters in response.

"No one has been here for years. How could it be unexpected?"

Athena remains frozen on the porch. Her eyes widen as she stares at the front of the house. Alexander moves back to her, silently offering his hand. She sighs but accepts it, following him inside.

"Shall we split up?" I suggest, and Alexander agrees.

Upstairs, despite the smell and dust, everything appears immaculate. I search the bedrooms one by one, finding nothing significant.

At the hallway's end lies a tiny bedroom, too small to swing a cat. I recognize it as Athena's room the moment I open the door. Her scent still lingers, but only a small bed and an old rotting dresser remain. No photos, toys, or artwork.

"She arrived with just a carrier bag of clothes," Theodore remarks from behind me. "When I first met her, she was terrified. She probably believed she was escaping one hell only to enter another."

"Back when I was Human, I eliminated Humans like Dominic and Victoria. Those who harmed children and tore them from their parents. Sometimes even the parents deserved punishment. If I had known..."

"That was Victoria's nature. Even Brianna admitted she didn't see it, despite spending considerable time here. We never knew of Silver Creek's existence until their leader requested Alexander's help. It was surprising that a pack lived so close yet remained off our radar. That was Dominic's fatal error. That's when everything collapsed for him."

"Yet Athena was the one who suffered."
###Chapter 0446
Athena

"Alexander was right. They're all gone. We ended them. They can't harm you now." Nyx's voice whispers through my mind as we trail Zachary through the hollow house.

We halt before the office door. My heart pounds violently against my ribs. Alexander's fingers tighten around mine, guiding me forward. "Not every memory here is dark. This is where I found you."

My gaze sweeps the room, landing on the dark stain marring the carpet. Marcus had fallen there. Typical Victoria—never cleaning up messes herself. That task always fell to me.

"Why did you lie?" My voice comes out hushed.

"Lie?"

"You told them I locked you in here. It wasn't true."

"I suspected they were hurting you. Dominic confirmed it when he struck you. Then again when they tried dragging you to the basement."

"It feels like lifetimes ago, yet..." I'd spent countless hours in this office, scrubbing every surface with a toothbrush while Victoria loomed over me, shouting orders or criticizing missed spots. So many times I'd fantasized about shoving that toothbrush through her eye.

Well, you did much worse than that.' Nyx murmurs inwardly.

A faint smile touches my lips. Alexander presses a kiss to my cheek.

"You've grown stronger since those days." He releases my hand, rummaging through the desk drawers. I drift toward the bookcase. Dozens of heavy volumes line the shelves—books I'd always yearned to read but was never permitted.

I pull out the nearest one. Fingertips trace the gold embossed letters. One single word: 'HARRISON'

I glance toward Alexander. He's now occupied with a cabinet, extracting stacks of paperwork.

Dust plumes around me as I sink into a chair. Coughing, I wave the particles away. Alexander asks if I'm alright. I nod, cracking open the book.

Page after page of elegant script in an unfamiliar language. What is this? I ask Nyx.

'Looks like Latin.' She responds.

'Latin?'

'I can't be sure! I've only existed with you a few years!'

Flipping further, I discover a family tree. Similar to the one Theodore created for me, but this one spans multiple pages with more names. Beside my mother's name reads 'Amelia Harrison' with birth and death dates. Branching from her is another line labeled 'Female, unknown.' Could that be Evelyn? That would make her my cousin.

"I found something." I murmur to Alexander.

"Good. Dominic and Victoria were terrible at record-keeping." He approaches, taking the offered book.

He sighs. "This makes sense. If Evelyn never knew her mother, the family wouldn't have recorded her existence."

"But someone must have known. Maybe Amelia claimed the baby didn't survive?" I shrug.

"Anything's possible. Unfortunately, this confirms Evelyn's claim. You're related."

"And she's a threat." I frown. "She carries Alpha genes. She could kill me and take my place."

"I doubt that."

"Why?"

"You're the last female Alpha. She can't simply replace you. Besides, if you died, your twins are next in line."

"Then what do we do about Evelyn? We can't keep her imprisoned forever. Levi might still come for her."

"Perhaps not. Maybe we can persuade her to help us."

"How?"

"By revealing her origins." He hands back the closed book. "Start with this."

My eyes lift to the shelves. Other identical volumes stand beside it. Pulling them out, I find the same gold lettering, but the pages are blank—waiting to be filled.

"Any luck?" Zachary asks as he and Theodore enter the office.

"We've found something. Not much, but we've identified Evelyn." Alexander informs them. "Athena's cousin. You were right, Theodore. Her mother did have a sister."

"Is she alive?" Zachary questions.

I shake my head. "According to this, she died fifteen years ago. I never met her—at least, I don't remember. I don't recall my mother mentioning her either. My clearest memory is watching my parents die."

"Search again." Alexander commands. "Ensure we missed nothing. Hidden rooms. Trap doors. Anything."

Theodore and Zachary nod, dispersing in opposite directions.
###Chapter 0447

"Do you ever wonder if they'd feel ashamed?" I ask Alexander.

"Your ancestors?"

"Not just my parents. Generations back. Seeing what became of our bloodline. This book shows there were once so many Harrisons. Now it's just me. And I suppose Evelyn too."

"And our twins."

"No."

"No?" He raises an eyebrow.

I shake my head. "We haven't discussed it, but they're Blacks. Not Harrisons. They may be Lycans but they're just as much yours as mine. The Harrison name doesn't carry the weight it once did."

His lips find mine in a fierce, possessive kiss. He pulls back with a smile. "Whatever you want."

We walk through the house until we reach the basement door. I try to focus on the memory of Alexander making me part of the contract. Back then I panicked, but it became my escape route.

"I can't go down there." I groan.

"You're strong enough."

"It's different now. This isn't about what they did to me."

Nyx remains silent too.

"Brianna?" Alexander asks softly.

"Brianna and I have moved past it. She's home watching our boys. I can't let what she did resurface in my mind again. I forgave her. If I go down there where my blood probably still stains the walls because I wasn't allowed to clean it... I don't want to relive that memory. That's not who she is anymore."

"Then I'll go alone."

He opens the door. The rancid smell of decay hits us like a physical blow. It's a hundred times worse than when we first opened the front door. Alexander had opened windows earlier, airing out the main level. But this... My stomach clenches violently. The milkshake I had earlier threatens to come back up.

My legs carry me through the house automatically. I barely make it outside before emptying my stomach.

"Morning sickness hitting already?"

I look up to see Zachary offering a water bottle.

"Alexander opened the basement. We found the source of the smell."

He glances past me into the house before returning his attention to me as I take the bottle.

"Right."

"I thought you and Theodore were doing a perimeter sweep." I mutter.

"We were. I needed a drink when you came charging out here."

I swish water in my mouth and spit it out, trying to clear the vomit taste. It only makes my stomach clench again.

"Wait." I look up at him sharply. "You asked if morning sickness was hitting already."

"I did."

"You didn't ask why I was sick."

"I didn't."

"Do you know something?" I point my finger accusingly.

"I recall only one other time you drank milkshakes obsessively. The same drink you demanded five minutes into our journey because you were suddenly hungry."

"Are you saying I'm pregnant?"

"It's early, but yes. There's a very subtle change in your scent."

'Nyx?' I mentally reach out.

'I didn't want to freak you out.' she whispers before humming to avoid further conversation.

"Plus, whenever you and Alexander stand together, he always has his hand on your stomach." Zachary grins.

"He does not."

He simply keeps smiling.

"Does he know?" I ask.

"He hasn't said anything to me."

"This is not good. I'll have three under two. What if these are twins too? That's four under two. What if they can shift? The diapers alone..."

"You have time to prepare." His smile widens.

"I'm glad you find this amusing."

"What's amusing?" Alexander asks as he joins us outside. He carries several Harrison books from the office.

"I just... Did you find anything?"

"The smell was from a badly decayed body. Probably Marcus. It was dumped at the bottom of the stairs. Nothing else down there. Some boxes of junk. A mattress. But I thought these might be useful." He taps the books. "We can add our own family to them. However many children we have."

"You knew?" I demand.

"Of course I knew." He presses his lips to mine through our bond. "You should have started your period over a week ago."

"Okay, now that's out in the open." Zachary winks at me. "How come Luc couldn't tell you're pregnant?"
###Chapter 0448
Seraphina

"You want me to walk Liam to school?"

"Don't speak with food in your mouth." Zoe scolds me. "But yes."

"The school is literally down the street. You could watch him from the window."

"I could, but the entrance is around the corner."

"I'm not permitted to leave the house without supervision."

"Hannah has agreed to watch you from a distance. Just walk him there, ensure he enters the building, and return immediately. I would do it myself but Braelyn was up most of the night. I need to get her to sleep."

I glance at my baby sister, whimpering softly as she clings to Zoe. Last night was one of the few times I actually wished I could leave this house.

"Fine." I agree, mainly so I can figure out what's going on with the little terror.

"Thank you."

Liam glares at me as he slings his backpack over his shoulder. Even without my Lycan senses, I can see he despises this idea.

"I'm not a baby." He snarls.

"Then maybe tell Zoe that, because she asked me to walk you."

"Only because my stupid sister kept everyone awake."

"HEY!" I snap, and he actually flinches. "Braelyn is an infant. She can't tell anyone what's wrong or what she needs. Maybe you'll understand someday that everyone has bad days, regardless of age."

"Whatever."

We step outside and he immediately kicks over one of Zoe's potted plants, grinding it into the dirt.

"You claim you're not a baby, but you're certainly acting like one."

"Fuck off!" He glares, and even I'm stunned. He turns eight tomorrow, not eighteen... "Are you serious right now?" I cross my arms, and he mimics me.

"I'm not scared of you. Maybe you should be scared of me. Now that you don't have your Lycan."

I grab his shirt collar and yank him back toward the house. He swings at me, tries to kick, but I'm smart enough to keep him at arm's length.

I shove the front door open. Caleb stares at us with wide eyes.

"Where's Zoe?"

"Her room." His blue eyes dart to Liam, then past us. "Caleb is going to be furious." I glance over my shoulder to see Caleb storming toward us, his face dark, hands clenched into fists. Caleb vanishes while Liam struggles against my grip.

"Care to explain what's happening?" Caleb demands.

"She hit me!" Liam wrenches himself free—or maybe I let go from sheer shock. I wasn't sure.

Caleb's eyes narrow to slits as he stares at me. "Basement."

"You don't have to..."

"Basement." He repeats, his voice low and dangerous. I nod and turn away, just hearing him order Liam to go to his room.

"But dad..."

"I said now."

I don't hear anything else as I slip through the door leading down to my room.

I sit on my bed, eyes fixed on the door at the top of the stairs. Waiting for Caleb's inevitable arrival. Liam was going to be the reason everything blows up for me. Unless I can prove otherwise.

My leg bounces uncontrollably, like it has a mind of its own. It jitters faster than my heartbeat as a bead of sweat trickles down my spine.

A knock sounds at the door.

"Come in." I whisper.

Caleb appears, the floorboards groaning under his weight. He trudges down the stairs slowly, releasing a heavy sigh when he reaches the bottom.

"What happened Seraphina?"

I tell him everything. Repeating Liam's words verbatim. No way was I letting a seven-year-old be the reason I get killed.

"I have to ask."

"I didn't hit him. Like I said, I grabbed his collar and brought him back inside. Ask Hannah."

I'd seen her watching us, though I hadn't mentioned it to Liam.

"Hannah?"

"Like I said, Zoe asked me to walk him. I reminded her I couldn't leave unsupervised. She said Hannah would watch me, and I saw her."

He sits beside me on the bed. "Sadly, I believe you."

"You do?"

"I'm as surprised as you are. But I believe you because you didn't see me watching you."

"It was a test?" I scoff.

"You like Hannah. I needed to ensure she wouldn't cover for you. I saw what he did with my own eyes. I heard every word he said to you."

"Then why didn't you step in?"

"I wanted to see how you'd handle it. If you'd hit him, this would be a very different conversation."

"I'm trying not to get killed." I mutter. "But if you don't do something, that kid is going to end up killing someone."

"Speaking from experience?"

I don't answer, but we both know I am.

"What are you going to do?" I ask quietly.

"I need to get to the root of this. I can't fix anything without knowing what's causing it."

I nod in agreement. Though Liam's attitude suggests this has been festering for a long time.

I spend the rest of the day in the basement, only slipping out for the bathroom or food. I figured staying out of Liam's way might help a little.

After everyone's gone to bed, I head to the kitchen for water. I sit at the counter, flipping through one of Zoe's many books.

"Why are you awake?" Liam's voice makes me jump. I was still adjusting to the lack of enhanced hearing being worse than losing the ability to scent someone.

"Liam, you should be asleep." I whisper.

"I asked you a question."

I gesture to my glass. "I was thirsty."

He walks around the counter and stares at me. "Are you here to hurt us?"

"No. Why would you ask that?"

"You left before. You left Zoe, me and Noah."

"That was a long time ago, and it was a mistake." I couldn't see his hands, and it made me nervous. "Sometimes we make mistakes. Sometimes they're so bad they ruin our lives."

"Why?"

"I lost my Lycan because of my choices."

"Because you were stupid. That's what he said. You were stupid and needed punishment. Everyone is stupid."

"Who said that?"

He just keeps staring. Right now, more than anything, I wish I could mind-link Zoe or Caleb.

"What's in your hand?"

He smiles and lifts his empty hands. "I'm going to bed." He turns and runs off.

My heart hammers in my chest. "Zoe?" I mutter, sprinting for the stairs just as Liam slams his bedroom door. I burst into her room to find her fast asleep with Braelyn beside her. Noah is tucked in his bed too. Caleb. Where is Caleb? I find him asleep in Braelyn's room, probably seeking some peace. I close my eyes and exhale. At least he hadn't hurt them. But who was he talking about?
###Chapter 0449
Zachary

We've searched every inch of the pack territory.
I don't think there's anything left to discover.
I relay this to Alexander as we head back to the vehicle.
Whatever evidence existed here, Dominic or Victoria must have destroyed it.
Probably to prevent Athena from learning the truth about her origins.
"I was hoping for more." Alexander admits, though he knows I'm right.
His crimson gaze shifts to Theodore, who's leaning over the car hood.
"What's he looking at?"
"A map he discovered. He's trying to locate any hidden structures those bastards might have used."

Alexander's eyes move to Athena, curled asleep in the passenger seat.
The vomiting and pregnancy revelation have completely drained her.
"I'm curious," I say. "If you knew she was pregnant, why keep it from her?"
"She wasn't ready to hear it. She made that clear not long ago. Though she's handling it better than I anticipated." He smiles faintly.
"You'd have an entire army if she allowed it."
"Nothing wrong with that. You'll understand someday."
I remain silent. My first mate had been unexpected. Finding another seemed improbable.

"Anything?" Alexander asks Theodore.
"Nothing." Theodore frowns, folding the map. "This feels like a wasted trip."
"Not entirely." Alexander counters. "We identified Evelyn. And Athena learned something new about herself."
I raise an eyebrow. Why wasn't he telling Theodore about the pregnancy?
'Too early.' Alexander links me, as if reading my thoughts.

He moves Athena to the back seat so she can lie down comfortably.
He slides in beside her, his protective hand immediately resting on her stomach.
Theodore takes the driver's seat.
"Are we telling Evelyn?" Theodore finally asks.
"Yes." Alexander confirms.
"Is that wise? I get she's family, but that doesn't make it right."
"It's only fair. She's started opening up. Maybe this will encourage more cooperation."
"What if that's exactly what Levi wants? Maybe he needed confirmation and we're handing it to him."
"I doubt it." Alexander says. "He already suspected something. That's why he monitors her. Why he threatened us with her. But from what we know, he's never encountered her Lycan. He wouldn't have if he kept drugging her."
"He claimed it was an accident. That he drugged her for protection but miscalculated the dose."
"Do you believe that?"
"No."

I notice Theodore's grip tightening on the steering wheel.
"What really happened when Levi held you captive? You've never discussed it."
He presses his lips together, eyes fixed on the road. "It's nothing."
"Nothing?"
"You felt a connection to him, didn't you?" Alexander keeps his voice low to avoid waking Athena, but his tone demands answers.
"Yes, but it's more than that. He was desperate for me to admit I was his mate. His moods shifted violently when denied. I think he's always gotten his way, and when challenged, he revealed his true nature. Angry. Aggressive. He tried to mark me."

Silence fills the car, broken only by the engine.
"Did he succeed?"
"No. I lied and gave a false name." His hands slam against the wheel. "Luc is wrong. He has to be. A Witch Hunter mating a Lycan... It's impossible."
"Luc's knowledge is unreliable lately. He's missing things." I glance back at the sleeping Athena. "Missing obvious things. He messed up by not killing Levi and now contradicts himself. Something's changed. He's weakening."
"You think he's mistaken?"
"Yes. Luc is a Rogue Hunter who happens to be mated to a Lycan."
"That's different."
"Is it?" I ask. "Hannah may not have her Lycan abilities now, but what if they return? Like yours did. She could still turn Rogue while remaining mated to a Hunter."
"So what does that make me? His mate and potential killer? I can't be bound to someone like him. He's unhinged. A psychopath."
"Not necessarily his killer. Remember that." Alexander murmurs.
"But it explains why you're so agitated about this." I shrug.
Theodore slams on the brakes abruptly.
"Dammit, Theodore!" Alexander snaps from the back as we lurch forward.
"Sorry, but I need to make this clear. I love my family. I love Obsidian Howl. I'll do whatever it takes to protect it. I won't accept him."
"Then why not just reject him?" Athena whispers from the back, sitting up. "Like Julian tried with Sophia."

Silence falls as Athena adjusts herself.
Theodore frowns deeply. "Sophia still refused. She wouldn't accept the rejection, so what good would it have done? And I already made my point. I stabbed him."
"You stabbed his projection because he stabbed you first. If it came down to it, could you actually kill him?" I couldn't bring myself to kill Isabella. Athena had to do it eventually, something I deeply regret.
"Theodore, it's okay." Athena tells him. "I understand what it's like to be mated to someone you don't want. It's confusing. Frustrating. So many conflicting emotions."

It takes me a moment to realize she's not referring to Alexander, but her first mate.
Someone I never met.
If I had, I would have torn him apart.
###Chapter 0450
Brianna

I collapsed onto the sofa.

All three children were napping simultaneously.

It felt like a miracle.

Exhaustion washed over me.

Maybe I could rest too.

I closed my eyes.

A strange noise came from upstairs.

Not a cry.

More like a gurgled groan.

Almost a growl.

Only the boys and I were home.

Sebastian had left to handle an emergency.

I crept upstairs silently.

Checked my bedroom first.

Then moved to Luca's room where the twins slept.

Luca and Logan were deep in sleep.

But in Evrin's travel cot sat a tiny Lycan.

Bright blue eyes stared back at me.

Athena had warned me.

Even with warning, it shocked me.

I'd never seen such a small Lycan.

"Your mother did warn me," I whispered.

I leaned over to grab his torn vest and diaper.

"What do we do with you now?"

He stared up at me.

Slowly, his eyes closed.

He shuffled down onto the mattress.

He could shift but experienced newborn Lycan fatigue.

I slipped out quietly.

Left the door slightly ajar.

Headed back downstairs.

On autopilot, I made tea.

Took it outside to the front porch.

So much better than my old stone porch.

I took a sip.

Saw Caleb and Seraphina marching across the grounds.

They were heading straight toward me.

No question about it.

"Is the Beta around?" Caleb asked.

"Sebastian or Zachary?"

"Either."

I glanced at Seraphina.

Her eyes stayed down.

Hands buried in her hoodie pockets.

"Zachary's working with Alexander. Sebastian's handling a situation at the packhouse. Can I help?"

Caleb glanced at Seraphina.

"Can you watch her for me?"

"Not a good idea."

Mostly because I wanted her dead.

Also because I had three children inside.

Two weren't even mine.

"Won't take more than ten minutes," Caleb muttered.

"Just need to speak to someone with authority."

"This about her?" I gestured to Seraphina.

"Yes, but not what you think. She did the right thing this time."

Her brown eyes flickered up briefly.

Surprised by Caleb's acknowledgment.

"Ten minutes," I muttered.

Turned to Seraphina.

"You sit there." I pointed to a small chair.

"Don't move until Caleb returns. Understood?"

She nodded.

Shuffled to the chair.

Several minutes passed.

Curiosity got the better of me.

"What did you do?"

"Not supposed to say," she replied.

"You know the Beta is my mate."

She frowned.

"What would the Alphas do if they found a child causing trouble?"

"Liam?" I raised an eyebrow.

"Didn't say that."

"But that's who you mean. Obvious, especially with only three siblings around. And there's already been problems with him."

"Something happened last night."

"Anyone hurt?" I asked.

"No, but I feel someone was close to getting hurt."

"By a child?"

"He's different. Compared to Noah, he has this dark streak."

She looked around as if expecting him to appear.

"Trying to tell me he's already Rogue?"

"Don't know anymore. Impossible to tell at his age. I used to always sniff them out, read the warnings. But now... Last night I slept outside his room to ensure he didn't harm anyone. He got up while I was drinking water. Started ranting about everyone being stupid. Made a strange comment too. 'He told him I was stupid, that I needed punishment.'"

"Levi?"

"Don't know. How would he reach him? He's just a child. Either at school or home with his mother. He's seven. Technically eight. I was bratty at his age, but not like this. He's a devil child."
###Chapter 0451

That was a cruel thing to say about a child. Even if Charlotte had called him bad.

Her fingers scrape against the wooden chair. “Last night, I felt this overwhelming urge to protect the family. I checked on everyone. I camped right outside Liam’s door just in case. Caleb found me this morning. The kid is insane. He tried telling Caleb that I hit him—just to get me in trouble.”

“Did you?”

“No! I know my reputation is terrible, but no. Besides, Caleb saw everything.”

“You understand why I had to ask?”

She nods slowly. “You’re one of many who hate me. There was a time I wouldn’t have cared. But I’m learning to accept it now. I know it’ll always be this way. I made too many enemies.”

“You did. But right now, you aren’t the problem we need to deal with.”

She leaps up from the chair. “What… the hell… is that?”

I turn and see a small black Lycan cub creeping toward me. I laugh softly. “So someone else can escape too,” I murmur, scooping Evrin into my arms.

“Are you telling me that’s your kid?”

“No.”

“One of Athena’s?”

“Yes.”

“He can shift?”

“Is there something wrong with your eyesight? Obviously, he can shift!” I snap.

“But he’s a kid. A baby.”

“And you had your abilities stripped. There’s a lot of weird stuff happening.”

“Does anyone else know?” she presses.

“No. And it needs to stay that way.” I hold her gaze until she reluctantly agrees.

“Are they going to bind him?” She follows me into the house.

“Why would they do that?”

“It could be dangerous for him. Shifting at this age… it might be harming his little body.”

“That’s not something you need to worry about.” I glare, making it clear she should shut her mouth before I do it for her.

“And you should be asleep,” I mutter to Evrin. His blue eyes lock onto mine, and he shifts back into his human form.

“This is insane,” Seraphina whispers. “And amazing. Why are they keeping this a secret?”

“Are you stupid? Did you lose all common sense when Levi stripped you?”

Evrin giggles. Seraphina just stares until a knock sounds at the door.

Caleb steps inside, his expression tight with concern. “You let her in.”

“I didn’t have a choice. One of the twins woke up. Everything sorted?”

“Yes. Thank you. Alexander is on his way home. We’ll move forward with the next step then.”

What did that mean?

“Let’s go,” he tells Seraphina before thanking me again.

I keep Evrin occupied until he finally drifts back to sleep. Sebastian appears. His frown almost mirrors Caleb’s.

“You okay?” he asks quietly. “Heard you got roped into babysitting Seraphina.”

I nod. “And she knows about Evrin. He climbed out of his cot and found me outside talking to her.”

He shrugs. “It was going to come out eventually. If it comes from her, no one will believe it anyway. Did she tell you what happened last night?”

“Yes. It has to be Levi, right?”

He sits beside me on the sofa. “Seems likely. Might explain why he has such an issue with Charlotte.”

“Seraphina spoke like she thinks Liam is already Rogue. Is that something we should consider? He’s not thirteen, but then this one already has his Lycan. What are you planning to do with him?”

“Caleb wants to bind him.”

“How will that help? If he doesn’t even have his Lycan yet, it won’t make a difference. How he’s acting right now won’t change either. Can’t we get Luc to figure out what his issue is and stop it that way?”

He goes silent.

“What is it?”

“Luc left. He left, and Hannah went with him.”
###Chapter 0452
Luc

Hannah's hazel eyes lock with mine. "Are you certain? What about the rest of them? Athena and Alexander? We're leaving without even a word."

"They'll figure it out."

"But I don't."

"Then why are you here with me?"

She lets out a heavy sigh. "Maybe because I'm a fool. It's not like I can actually be of any help to you."

"We can turn back." I offer, "I can return you to the safety of the pack, but I have to understand what's happening to me."

Hannah glances back toward the pack territory. We were completely out of view now. The guard at the gate had likely already reported to Sebastian unless he ignored the note entirely.

"If I don't uncover the truth about my condition, I'm completely useless to them."

She frowns deeply.

"That's not what I meant and you know it." I scowl back. "They brought me here for a purpose and I'm failing to uphold my agreement with Alexander."

"I'm certain if you just explain..."

"I can't explain it, Hannah. I don't understand what's happening. Even now, standing here looking at you, your soul is becoming harder to see. My Hunter abilities are slowly draining away. Tomorrow I might wake up as just an ordinary Wolf."

"You truly believe there's something at your old house?"

"I don't know, but it's worth investigating."

She pouts slightly before nodding. "I'll come with you."

"Then let's move. I have a vehicle parked up the road."

As Hannah settles into the passenger seat, I notice her rubbing her neck again. "Still hurting?"

"It comes and goes." She shrugs as if it's become routine, but it troubles me. I've even checked her neck to ensure nothing was injected beneath her skin.

"Seraphina mentioned that after she lost her abilities, she noticed changes." Hannah tells me. Seraphina speaks more openly with her, just as I anticipated. They share common ground. "What kind of changes?"

"Like feeling aches and pains more intensely without the ability to heal. Sometimes even lying in an odd position causes discomfort now. I suppose we used to heal automatically, even minor things like sore muscles weren't an issue. My scar still itches terribly." She points to the thick scar running from her eye to her chin. Fortunately, she hadn't lost her sight.

"It's where he injected me... I think. Maybe it's more psychological than physical pain." She shrugs again.

"Why haven't you mentioned this before?"

"Because it frustrates you when you can't fix something. And this is one of those things."

I glance at her. She has her elbow propped on the door, staring out the window. I could fix it if she were willing to be bitten. But I don't bring it up. It always upsets her.

"This is your home?" She murmurs as I park beside it.

"Yes." I reply, scanning the street. Something feels wrong. It's midday and there's no one around. No dog walkers. No runners or cyclists. As much as Humans irritate me, their habits are predictable.

Hannah moves to exit the car. "Don't," I mutter, grabbing her arm.

"What is it?" she whispers back.

"I haven't been back here in a while, and it appears Rogues might have moved in. I'm fairly certain we're being watched."

"What do we do?"

"You do nothing." I reach into the backseat for my shotgun. "You stay here. Lock the doors after me. Don't open them until I return."

"What if...?"

"No what if's. You do exactly as I say. Understood?"

She nods as I quietly exit the car. I watch her press the locks down just as something slams into me, throwing me to the ground. My gun slides across the road away from me, and I see another Rogue charging toward me.

Blood from a recent kill covers its face. It drops to all fours, gaining speed as I reach for the gun in my belt. A loud bang rings in my ears, and I watch the Rogue collapse.

I turn to see a wide-eyed Hannah, poking one of my guns through the small window gap, both hands gripping it tightly.

The first Rogue attacks me from the side. Claws dig into my shoulder before hurling me through the air.

As I land on my stomach, the air is knocked from my lungs. Screams come from the direction of my car. Rolling over, I see the Rogue desperately trying to reach my mate as he forces the window down.
###Chapter 0453

Madison fires until the gun clicks empty. Every single shot somehow misses the bastard.

I crawl toward my shotgun. I aim. I blow his fucking head off.

Blood sprays across my car. It splatters Madison as the Rogue’s headless body slides down the vehicle.

She flings the door open. She runs to me. Her arms wrap tightly around my neck.

"Let's get inside."

I guide her through the back door. "Stay here. I need to get rid of the bodies. I can’t have more showing up. Not until I figure this out."

"Okay," she whispers.

I reload the gun. I hand it to her.

"Just in case," I mutter.

I find no one else while disposing of the Rogues. I sense no one watching. But that means nothing. Not if I’m losing my ability to sense them. I should have scented the one that tackled me. I should have seen it coming.

It doesn’t matter now. They’re both dead.

I light a match. I toss it onto the bodies. Flames engulf them. I walk away.

"Hannah?" I call out as I enter the kitchen.

Silence. Then a weak, scared voice. "Here!"

I push open the dining room door slowly. Levi has her. Her back is pressed to his chest. His arm locks around her. My kitchen knife is at her throat.

"You're not here," I growl.

He pushes the knife tip into her throat. A bead of blood appears. She squeals.

"You are still not here."

"You're a smart Hunter. But stupid."

"Maybe. But you're still not in this house. You're projecting. Making it seem real. You're strong enough to hold a weapon. Strong enough to feel solid. How did you get in?"

"Does it matter? I'll find all of you. Won't I, Hannah?" He drags her back. She squeezes her eyes shut. She fights tears.

"You put something in her?" I demand.

"No." He smiles.

"It's in you," Hannah cries. "It's in you."

"Me?"

"Every day, you grow weaker." He grins.

"You haven't touched me!" I snap.

"No, I haven't." He agrees. "Funny what a little spell can do. How easy it is to control someone. Right, Hannah?"

"I didn't know," she whispers.

"That's the beauty. They never do." Levi laughs. "Amazing abilities we Witches have!"

"You know many other Witches?" I mutter sarcastically.

His smile vanishes. He glares.

"Why track me? Why take my abilities? What do you get?"

"Pick you off, one by one. Levi and Evelyn get to have lots of fun." He sings.

"Evelyn? Evelyn is locked in a dungeon. Last I heard, she wanted nothing to do with you, you cunt!"

He shoves Hannah aside. He points the knife at me. "What did you say?"

"Which part? Calling you a cunt? Or telling you Evelyn wants nothing to do with you? Let's see. When I threatened to cut her finger off hours ago, she said she never wants to see you again. That you lied her whole life. That if she sees you again, she'll rip your throat out."

"LIES!"

"Nah. Why lie when the truth pisses you off more?"

"I could slice your throat open."

"Yes, you could. But your legs are fading. Anger makes you weak, not strong. You're barely holding on. So get the fuck out of my house. When I see you for real, I'll string you up. I'll let the crows feed on your decaying flesh. That's if the Witch Hunter doesn't get you first."

The knife clatters to the floor. He disappears.

I look at Hannah. She's curled under the side table. "You didn't know you did that to me, did you?"

She shakes her head. She refuses to meet my eyes. "He told me just before you came in."

"Injection? Or a drug?"

"I don't know. I don't know when, where, or how. I don't even know if he's telling the truth. Or if I've done it to others."

"I have a machine downstairs. It scans bodies. We'll find out soon."
###Chapter 0454
Athena

"Luc is gone? Is he returning?" I ask.

"What a fool." Nyx murmurs.

"Decided to stop ignoring me now?" I mutter back, but she stays silent.

Sebastian passes me a folded note. "It's uncertain. The note only states he needs to understand what's happening to him."

"So he does realize something is wrong with him." Alexander mutters, lifting Logan onto his shoulders.

"Seems so, but Hannah went with him."

"He forced her?" I ask. I knew they were mates, but Hannah always said the pack was her only safe haven.

"No." Brianna answers. "At least it doesn't appear so. I checked her room for clues. Some essentials are missing, but it doesn't look rushed. It seemed planned."

"After Levi?" Alexander frowns as I hand him the note.

"I know Luc wants Levi dead, but I doubt he'd endanger Hannah again." Brianna mutters.

"The problem is we can't mind-link either of them if they're in trouble." I groan.

Damn Luc and his relentless drive.

"You should tell them the other thing." Sebastian tells Brianna.

"Is this about Liam? I was just heading over." Alexander replies.

"No. There was a small incident earlier." Brianna drops her gaze.

"He shifted, didn't he?" I look down at Evrin, who's tugging at Alexander's shoelaces.

"Yes. Please don't be angry. They were asleep. Caleb asked me to watch Seraphina while he spoke to Sebastian about Liam. She was sitting right there." Brianna points to a chair on her porch.

"Evrin had already shifted. You didn't warn me he could climb out of his cot. Well, he made his way out here."

"Seraphina knows?" Alexander asks, raising a brow.

"Yes."

"Did she touch him?"

"No. She panicked. Then she asked why no one else knew. Honestly, it was strange seeing her scared. Nothing like the woman who showed up here announcing herself. Definitely not like the one who held me down and stabbed my leg. I'm sorry, Athena. He was asleep. I swear I wouldn't have agreed to watch her otherwise."

"Okay." I mutter.

She looks up, shocked. "Okay? I thought you'd be furious."

I shrug. "Everyone will find out eventually. Logan will be next. Seraphina wasn't the ideal person to discover it first." I glance at Alexander. "But maybe it will scare her enough to stop being reckless."

Brianna presses a hand to her chest, exhaling deeply.

"She's been stressing over this." Sebastian tells Alexander. They both roll their eyes. "Are you really going to bind the kid?" Sebastian asks. "I get it. From what Caleb said, he's a little brat. But binding him?" He glances at me.

"Preferably, no. It's what Caleb wants, unless I can change his mind. I'm hoping Athena can talk some sense into him."

"Me?" I ask, surprised.

"He's just a kid, but he's a Lycan kid. That means he answers to you."

"You want me to intimidate him?" I wasn't comfortable with that.

"Only if necessary. Sometimes it works."

Brianna and Sebastian agree to watch the twins while we visit Caleb's.

Seraphina opens the door. Her gaze drops immediately when she sees me. "Do you need something?"

"No. Where's Caleb?" Alexander asks.

"In the kitchen. This way."

She leads us through the house. A small boy tugs my sleeve. "Hi." He beams at me with blue eyes brighter than my own. "My name is Noah."

"Hi." I smile back. He blushes and quickly runs off.

"I think someone has a little crush." Alexander links me.

'Don't be ridiculous.'

'I think I'll have to keep an eye on that one.' He jokes with a smile.

Caleb appears. Seraphina makes an excuse and disappears through a door down some steps.

"Sebastian told you everything?"

"Yes." Alexander replies. "But before we discuss that, I want to try something else."

"You don't want to bind him?"

"Ultimately, you're his father. But from experience, binding is one of the worst things you can do. It might make him hate everything even more."
###Chapter 0455

"I considered that possibility." Caleb mutters under his breath. "But reasoning with him hasn't produced any results."

"You haven't tried having the Alpha intervene." Alexander gestures toward me.

"Alright." Caleb gives me a reluctant nod. "He's upstairs in his room after a difficult day. Should I call him down?"

"Not necessary." I respond quietly.

"Let her handle this situation. Don't interfere in any way." Alexander instructs Caleb firmly.

Caleb takes a deep, steadying breath. "Proceed."

I move to the base of the staircase. "LIAM SILVERWOOD!"

Liam appears at the top of the stairs. There's a brief flash of irritation at his delayed recognition of me. I watch as his brown eyes gradually soften. His lower lip begins to tremble slightly. "Alpha Athena," he whispers, lowering his gaze respectfully.

"We need to have a conversation." I sigh heavily. He was just a child. A child slightly older than I had been when accused of my parents' murder. Intimidating him wasn't my intention. I would find an alternative approach. "Let's take a walk outside."

He descends the stairs silently, casting a pleading look toward Caleb for assistance. Caleb remains silent, exactly as instructed.

Liam follows me out of the house without speaking. He shoves his hands deep into his pockets, scuffing his feet against the ground as we walk. Yet he maintains a quick pace, as if eager to distance himself from the house.

"Tell me something." I murmur softly.

"Like what?" He asks, confusion evident in his voice.

"Anything. School, friends, home life."

"I don't have any friends." He grumbles discontentedly. "They're all idiots."

"Idiots? That seems rather harsh."

"They just...you wouldn't understand." A frown forms on his tanned face.

"Try me."

"They won't get to live anyway, so what's the point in making friends?"

'That was unexpected.' Nyx comments with a frown.

"What do you mean? Why won't they get to live?" I press further.

He rolls his eyes dismissively.

"Did you know I have methods of extracting information from people, even when they're unwilling to share?"

"That's a lie."

'He's one arrogant little brat.' Nyx snorts derisively.

"How do you think I managed to get you out of your bedroom?"

He merely shrugs his shoulders, and we continue walking. His desire to be anywhere else was painfully clear.

"Are you unhappy here?" I ask directly.

He looks up at me and shakes his head.

"Why not?"

Liam presses his lips together tightly and continues walking in silence.

"Are you communicating with someone outside the pack?" I change my tone to one that demands an answer.

"Yes." He squeaks out, looking confused about his own compliance.

"Who?"

"Levi." His voice pitches higher with anxiety.

"What does he tell you?"

"He wants to punish everyone." His tears begin falling faster. I hated making a child cry, but confirming Levi's involvement was crucial.

"Liam. He's a liar. Whatever he's telling you isn't true."

He shakes his head vehemently. "You're wrong. He said we could be free. He said I could help him because I'm a strong Lycan. He said you would ruin us. He said he would help me. I'm not scared. He chose me. Not stupid Charlotte or my brother or anyone else at school. He chose me. I just have to..."

"Have to what?" I press urgently.

His brown eyes lock with mine. He genuinely didn't want to reveal this. "I have to..." He lifts his wrist and points to what appears to be a watch, but instead of a clock face, it features a small button.

"Press this."

"What does it do?"

"I don't know."

"He told you to press it but you don't know its function?" I grab his wrist firmly. He tries to pull away while simultaneously pressing the button, sending panic through me. I had no idea what it would trigger.

"Let me go!" He bites my hand and slams his finger onto the button.

An explosion throws me off my feet. Liam takes off running as I look toward the pack house. Every window has blown out, half the roof is gone, and the side of the house crumbles inward. Flames engulf the structure, sending thick black smoke billowing into the sky.

Liam had destroyed my home. Liam was a fucking child who had blown up my home.

Screams and shouts echo around me as people scramble. But all I could do was sit and stare in disbelief.

'Fucking little bastard!' Nyx growls furiously.

###Chapter 0457
Alexander

What the hell was that?
Through Ryken's kitchen window, thick black smoke billows into the sky.
I shove past Calihan in my rush to the door.
Ryken catches the boy just as Seraphina appears, demanding to know about the noise.
I don't answer.
I'm already outside, sprinting toward the explosion.

The packhouse is demolished.
Half the structure has collapsed into rubble.
Our pack members scramble desperately to douse the flames.
The remaining roof section sways precariously as more bricks crash down.

Then I spot my mate.
She sits motionless on the grass, staring blankly at the ruins of our home.

I drop to my knees beside her.
She remains silent.

"Were you inside?" I demand, unsure where she had intended to take Liam.
She shakes her head slowly.

"Where is Liam?" Titan growls urgently.
I scan the chaotic grounds but see no sign of the boy.

"Athena, where is Liam?" I mutter as people rush past us.

"He did this." Her whisper is barely audible.

"What are you talking about?"

"He blew up our home." She taps her wrist absently. "He wore something. A watch with a button. Levi got to him."

"Athena..."

"He blew up our house!" Her voice cracks with strain.

"Let's get you out of here." I lift her into my arms.
She offers no resistance, seemingly in shock.
I glance back at the destroyed packhouse before heading toward Sebastian's home.
Thank the moon the twins were with them and not inside.
I mentally link every pack member who should have been in the building.
Relief floods me as each one checks in safely.
The house had been empty.

Sebastian meets us at the door. "What in goddess's name happened? Is she alright?"

"I need to use your house."

"Of course."

I settle Athena on the sofa, listening to her racing thoughts.
Her fury is palpable.
Claw tips emerge from her fingertips.
How could a child destroy such a large building?
Yet her mind insists it was Liam.
That Levi had promised him something.

"What happened out there?" Brianna asks softly.

"The packhouse was blown up."

"What?"

"Liam blew up the house." I repeat Athena's words, still struggling to believe them.

"Seriously?"

I nod, watching my mate's eyes darken ominously.
Nyx is rising to the surface again.

"Where is that little bastard?" Brianna demands.

"I don't know."

"He ran off." Athena murmurs. "He fled after the explosion knocked us down."

She swings her legs around and sits upright.
The darkness in her eyes recedes, returning to their usual soft blue.

"He spoke of Levi and promises. That man told Liam they could be free, that I would ruin them. He said Levi chose him, not Charlotte and not his brother."

"Charlotte?" I ask. "Was Charlotte one of Levi's targets?"

"I don't know." Athena shakes her head. "I should have commanded him to remove it." She rubs her eyes roughly.
When she lowers her hands, tears glisten in them. "I made him confess. Levi told him to push the button when the time was right. I tried to stop him when I saw the watch, but he pressed it anyway. I should have ordered him to stop... I don't even know if anyone was inside... I could have prevented this."

Guilt radiates from her.
Brianna sits beside her, wrapping an arm around Athena's shoulders. "He's just a child. None of us could have predicted this."

"I should have. Controlling adults is simpler. I could have stopped him and none of this would have happened."

"It would have happened regardless." I mutter.

"He's right." Sebastian confirms. "Whatever explosive was used had likely been planted there for some time. It must have been scentless or we would have detected it. Once the fire is out, I'll assemble a team to sweep the area for evidence."

"At least you and the boys weren't inside." Brianna sighs.

"And no one else was in the house either." I assure Athena. "They were all elsewhere. Everything lost can be replaced and rebuilt. No one was harmed."

"The boys," Athena whispers, looking at Brianna. "Are they safe?"

"Asleep. They slept through the explosion." Sebastian offers a reassuring smile.

Athena nods. "Ryken keeps linking me, demanding where his son is. How do I tell him that Levi corrupted Liam? That Liam destroyed the packhouse?"

"I'll handle it. Tell him I'm returning." I press my lips to hers and wipe the tear from her cheek.

Passing the packhouse, I see the flames are nearly extinguished.
Nothing remains salvageable.
The entire structure will require demolition and reconstruction.
###Chapter 0458

Zachary stepped outside, a scarf masking the lower half of his face.
Soot and ash smudged his skin.
“I assumed you’d be with Charlotte.”
He tugged the scarf down, revealing a grim expression.
“Athena collected her. Her biological father walked away.”
His irritation was palpable. I understood completely. I could never abandon my sons like that.
Zachary glanced back at the damaged pack house. “I’m sorry,” he muttered.
“Everyone survived. That’s what matters.”
“Do you know who’s responsible?”
“Yes. And it’s still hard to believe.”
He raised an eyebrow, waiting.
“Liam.”
“The boy who attacked Lottie? That little brat?”
“Yes. I’m on my way to inform his father now.”
“I rarely agree with Luc, but that kid needed serious discipline long ago.”
“The issue is, he’s run off.”
Caleb opened the door, his eyes scanning behind me. Clearly expecting his son. “You’re alone?”
“We need to discuss Liam.”
“Was he caught in the explosion? I’d know, right?”
“It’s more serious. Perhaps I should come inside.”
He stepped back, allowing me entry. Seraphina sat at the table playing a game with Caleb’s youngest son, Noah. Her dark eyes flicked to me briefly before returning to the game.
“Noah, Seraphina, please go to your rooms,” Caleb requested.
“Actually, Seraphina should stay. She might provide useful insight.”
A flash of fear crossed her features. She tried to hide it, poorly.
“Is Zoe here?” I asked. Liam’s mother needed to know her son’s actions.
“She went into the city with others. Took the baby,” Caleb informed me.
I waited until Noah’s footsteps faded upstairs. “There’s no easy way to say this. Liam caused the explosion you heard.”
Caleb stared, speechless. His mouth opened and closed several times. Disbelief or shock, I couldn’t tell. No parent wants to hear their child is a terrorist.
“You locked him in the dungeon? He’s just a child.”
“No. He blew up the pack house and fled. Zachary and others are searching for him.”
“He blew up the pack house?” Seraphina interjected. “Is everyone alright?”
I was slightly surprised she showed concern for others. “Yes, no one was injured. Levi gave him the means to do it.”
“Levi reached him?”
“He told Athena that Levi promised him a better life. Made him an offer.”
“No.” Caleb muttered. “No, you’re wrong. He wouldn’t do this. He wouldn’t fall for that.”
“Caleb, you found me outside his room because I feared he’d harm someone. You know something’s been troubling him,” Seraphina said softly.
“He’s a child,” Caleb frowned.
“So was I. But what he’s doing… it’s far worse than anything I ever did. I never destroyed a home.”
Caleb sank onto a wooden chair at the table. His hands clenched into fists. One fist slammed down on the table, making Seraphina jump.
“Where would he go?” I asked.
“He’s eight,” Caleb protested.
“He doesn’t have friends,” Seraphina murmured, staring at her hands. “He only goes to school or out with Zoe and Caleb. He must have met Levi somewhere.”
“I have to find him,” Caleb frowned. “I have to bring him back and make him understand.” He stood. “Zoe will be devastated if another child goes rogue.” His gaze briefly touched Seraphina.
“You won’t find him,” Seraphina whispered, still focused on her hands. “If Levi promised to help Liam, he’d be waiting. Levi never breaks promises. He drilled that into me repeatedly.”
“You think Levi was waiting for him?”
Seraphina nodded. “Liam did Levi’s dirty work. Levi will reward him. A prize, something Liam wants. It’ll make Liam feel justified, even though he knew it was wrong.”
Her eyes lifted to meet mine. “Think about it. Contracts provide satisfaction, Alexander. You offer something in return. Protection. Alliance. Whatever suits your needs. It’s probably the same for Liam. A sort of contract, but it doesn’t truly benefit my brother. It benefits Levi.”
###Chapter 0459

Luc

"You have to remove it." I pass Hannah the surgical blade, but her trembling fingers can't hold it steady. I wrap my hand firmly around hers. "It's draining my strength. I don't know how much longer I can last. It needs to come out now."

"You must do this, Hannah. I can't reach it properly myself. Not without making a mess." I gently lift her chin until her frightened chestnut eyes meet mine. "The scanner shows the exact location. It will be quick. Clean."

"I can't... We should return. Let Theodore handle it." She begs, her voice shaking.

"There's no time for that. I need it gone before it takes everything from me. I have you to protect. My little girl is back in Obsidian Howl, probably asking where I've disappeared to again."

I watch her shut her eyes tightly. She takes several deep, steadying breaths. Her hand finally stops trembling. She gives a slow nod. "Alright."

I lie face down on the cold table. I feel the chill of the metal scalpel as she positions it between my shoulder blades.

She presses down. Warm blood instantly trickles down my spine. The cutting pain is minimal, but she keeps whispering apologies over and over.

Hannah uses another tool to probe deeper into the wound. She freezes when I grunt in discomfort. Finally, she extracts a tiny sphere from my flesh. It clinks metallically against the bowl she drops it into, though it looks nothing like metal. I'll bring it back to Obsidian Howl. Perhaps Theodore can identify it.

"Got it." She murmurs, searching for something to clean the blood from her hands.

Immediate relief washes over me. I look at Hannah and smile, realizing I can see her entire soul clearly again. How could something so small cause such immense problems?

"Now your turn." I state quietly.

"Me?"

"I need to check first. In the scanner."

"He stripped my abilities."

"You mentioned an injection. If it's the same substance that was in me, I can remove it. You could get your Lycan abilities back."

I scan her repeatedly. Nothing appears. Not a single anomaly. Why was something different used on me?

For a fleeting moment, Hannah looks frustrated we found nothing. It gives me a sliver of hope that deep down, she truly wants her powers back.

"I despise him." She mutters under her breath while gently cleaning the blood from my back.

"Understandable."

She moves around the table to face me, standing between my parted legs. "How can someone be so cruel? Why would he feel the need to do this to people he doesn't even know?"

"He believes he's a God."

"Pfft. It makes no sense."

"Often, it doesn't." I wipe a tiny drop of blood from her cheek. "Everyone has darkness within them. For some, it never surfaces. For others, it consumes them completely."

"You're referring to Rogues?"

"Exactly. The problem is, we're dealing with a man who is half Witch. If that part dominates, he can channel the darkness that would have otherwise turned him Rogue."

She lowers her head, frowning. A crease forms between her brows. "So how do we defeat him?"

"Athena and Theodore."

"Just Athena and Theodore?"

"I believe so. I told you Theodore is a Witch Hunter."

"Athena can't link him, can she?"

"She can when he's vulnerable. That will be the key."

"You have a plan, don't you?"

"I'm working on it. I'll speak with Athena tomorrow. Tonight, we stay here. We get a proper night's sleep." "Do you think he'll return?"

"If he does, it will only be a projection. He won't actually be here."

Hannah sleeps curled tightly against me. All evening, her eyes kept darting around the house, searching for him. She even slept in one of my t-shirts because she didn't want him seeing her naked.

Any time I hinted at pleasuring her, she refused. The idea of Levi projecting himself here made her feel nervous and exposed.

I don't sleep. Not even a wink. I know there are more Rogues out there than just the two that tried to kill me. I can smell them near my house. But is it worth leaving my already terrified mate alone?

I lie awake, listening to their movements. There are at least eight. Eight of them prowling beneath my bedroom window. Yet not a single one attempts to enter the house. They can smell we're inside. I expect one to try a door handle. Or climb the building and attempt a window. But they don't.
###Chapter 0460

They circled the house, taking turns.
I couldn't take it anymore.
Slipping from bed, I quietly grabbed the rifle stored in my wardrobe.
I crept toward the window.
I aimed at one but didn't fire right away.
They spoke to each other in low, rough voices.
They used some kind of code.
Then they just left.
They disappeared behind the empty house across from mine.
Strange behavior for Rogues.
They usually didn't care about locked doors or windows.
I watched until sunrise.
They never returned.

"What are you doing?" Athena asked with a yawn.
"Rogues were here last night." I wouldn't lie to her.
"You didn't wake me?"
"They didn't do anything. It seemed like they were searching for someone."
"That's not normal, is it?"
"No."
"Were they looking for you?" she asked.
"I'm not sure."

Her eyes scanned the room.
It was like she expected to see Levi here.
She shivered and quickly dressed. "Can we go back to Obsidian Howl now?"
"Sure."

Athena stayed quiet in the car.
Bringing her had been a mistake.
But without her, I never would have gotten that poison out of my back.
"I will keep you safe," I muttered, placing my hand on her thigh.
She pulled away.
"You can't promise that."
"I know I want to protect you. I know I can, now that I'm at full strength again."
"He tricked me into injecting you. How can you keep me safe from that? How do I know this isn't another one of Levi's illusions?"

I pulled the gun from my hip and handed it to her.
"If you think this is a dream, point it at me and pull the trigger."
She took it and slowly raised the gun.
I didn't slow the car. I didn't stop.
If she truly believed this was a dream, I was about to die.
I glanced away from the road to look at her.
She could barely hold the gun steady.
Tears filled her chestnut eyes. "I don't know what to do."
"Yes, you do."

Her breathing grew heavy as she kept the gun aimed at me.
A small gasp escaped her parted lips.
"He wouldn't know, would he? He wouldn't expect you to let me shoot you?"
I winked at her.
She dropped the gun into her lap.
"Besides, you'd have to take the safety off first." My fingers tapped the steering wheel. "He really got inside your head, didn't he?"

Out of the corner of my eye, I saw her nod.
"It's like nothing belongs to me anymore. He took my abilities. He manipulated me into hurting you. What else did he make me do? Did he force me to harm others? Did he touch me when I was with him? How long has he been watching us?"
I had no answers for her.
But I understood why she hesitated to go beyond kissing.
He had shattered pieces of her soul.
I wouldn't let any more cracks appear.

"He wouldn't have touched you. He prefers men, not women."
I watched her relax slightly.
Then she leaned forward. "Is that Seraphina's brother?" Athena asked.
I slowed the car.
A boy with blonde curls was running in our direction.
His feet pounded the pavement.
Sweat dripped from him as he frantically looked around.
He ignored the passing cars.

"Why would he be out here alone?" Athena asked.
I pulled the car over.
The moment I stepped out, he tried to speed up and run away.
It took me two seconds to grab him.
"Where do you think you're going?"
The little brat tried to kick me in the balls.
"Not happening. Get in the damn car."
"You can't tell me what to do. I hate you."
I glared at him, and he fell silent.
This kid definitely had a dark aura.
"Get in the car."
We were only a couple of miles from the pack.
He had made it pretty far.
But who was he running from?
###Chapter 0461

"You'll find a way." Brianna gives me a reassuring smile. "You've always managed to handle impossible situations." She gently rocks Luca in her arms as he makes soft cooing sounds. Motherhood had become her natural state, as if she was born for it. Still, I felt anxious about sharing my pregnancy news with her. How do you tell a woman who can never experience carrying her own child that you're pregnant again?

Staying here had given me time to calm my nerves and think clearly. I felt incredibly foolish now. For a moment, I understood why Liam had called everyone stupid.

"Nobody's perfect." Brianna murmurs softly. "Stop punishing yourself over this. If Alexander had any suspicions, he never would have let you leave with Liam. No one could have predicted a child would do something like that. You reacted like any rational person would. Even if you had demanded the watch immediately, he still could have activated it."

"It shouldn't have happened regardless."

"Sebastian said the house would have been targeted regardless."

I nod, watching my boys playing in the corner. Part of me wonders how they'll react to another sibling. Another part worries this pregnancy might make me overlook important details again. Last time, carrying twins had exhausted me so much I missed crucial signs.

"I'm certain they'll find evidence." She offers me an encouraging smile.

"Even if they do, what difference does it make? The house is gone. The only place I've ever truly considered home is destroyed." "Alexander will rebuild it."

I nod. Knowing Alexander, he's already planning the reconstruction.

"What will you do with Liam?" Brianna asks curiously, settling beside me.

"Honestly, I want to end him. But I know that's not right. Ultimately, he's just a manipulated child. Killing him for that would be unjust." I shake my head. "But he still deserves appropriate punishment for his actions."

"Levi manipulated him the same way Victoria manipulated me." She whispers.

I nod in agreement. "I know they'll find him. There are only so many places he can run, even with Levi's help."

"And Levi? That bastard seems prepared for everything."

I run my thumb over my fingertips, feeling my claws resting just beneath the surface. "If he wants to play games, then we'll play his game."

She raises an eyebrow at me.

"I need to work out the details before sharing." I kneel beside my boys, kissing their heads. "Could you watch them a bit longer? There's something I need to do."

"Of course. I'll prepare the spare room for you and Alexander."

Leaving their house, I hurry toward the dungeons, avoiding looking at the ruins of my home. The guard nods respectfully and mentions that Evelyn seems more agitated than usual.

"Agitated?"

"She's been pacing constantly. Muttering to herself." He shrugs and rolls his eyes. "Lycans."

'She's communicating with her Lycan.' Nyx comments.

'Perhaps, but he doesn't know that.'

The guard opens the door for me. Immediately, I hear Evelyn arguing with empty air. She stops when she sees me. "What was that noise?"

"The packhouse."

"Levi?" She asks quietly.

"It appears he was involved, yes."

A frown forms on her face, then slowly softens. "I'm sorry."

"Sorry for what?"

"Dakota wants me to tell you this is all my fault. That if I hadn't been foolish, we could have handled this differently."

Her words surprise me. "Why would she want me to know that?"

"She says we're supposed to be your Beta."

"What?" I scoff, trying to suppress the laughter threatening to escape. "You think you, of all people, are supposed to be my Beta?"

"Dakota believes so." she mutters, lowering her gaze. "I've been telling her she's wrong. But she's completely certain and won't change her mind. I told her you'd probably kill us."

Nyx snorts. 'I've never heard such nonsense.'

Evelyn runs her hands through her hair and collapses onto the floor. "I don't expect you to believe her or anything I say."
###Chapter 0462

I stood frozen, staring at her in disbelief. "We're cousins."

"Cousins?"

"That's our relation. Your mother was my mother's sister. That's why you carry Alpha genetics."

She crept closer, fingers wrapping around the bars as she studied me. "Did you know her?"

"No."

"Oh."

"She wasn't discussed much. My parents died when I was young, so perhaps I just don't remember. Her name was Amelia."

"Thank you... wait, you keep saying 'was'. She was your mother's sister. Her name was Amelia."

"She's dead."

Her hands dropped from the bars. "That figures. Do you know how?"

"No. The records only showed her birth and death dates."

A slight frown appeared. Her tongue glided along her bottom lip. "There's a reason you're telling me this, isn't there?"

"I want your help to kill your brother."

"What?" she squeaked.

"Should I repeat myself?" I muttered.

"No... I just don't understand. Why would you need my help? You're the Alpha."

"So he won't see it coming."

'Are you seriously trusting this bitch?' Nyx asked.

'No, but I want to see where her loyalties lie.'

Evelyn turned away, facing the back wall of her cell. She was likely speaking with Dakota. Her hands rose to her temples, rubbing them slowly. She turned back to me. "If I do this..."

"I might consider letting you live."

She mulled over my words. "Levi is clever. He's always been prepared. Or perhaps he manipulates everything to work in his favor. I don't know anymore. It seems I was blind to it all."

"You say he's prepared, but will he expect his own sister to betray him?"

Her grey eyes locked onto mine. "I don't know. He's always been in control. But that was before. Now I can't hear him."

"How long?"

"Since Dakota emerged." She paused. "She says she's blocking him."

"Good."

'At least she has some sense,' Nyx muttered.

"Can I ask you something?" Evelyn whispered. "Do you ever get used to the voice in your head? The random sarcastic remarks? Or their annoyed huffs when they dislike something?"

"Never. Wait until Dakota starts humming. It's enough to drive anyone insane. I'll return later."

"Everything alright?" the guard asked, slamming the door shut behind me.

"It will be."

"Such a shame about the packhouse," he muttered as I walked away.

"At least no one was hurt." I smiled at him, but he just stared. Grant usually guarded the gates, not the dungeons. "It's unusual to see you working here."

"I guess they thought I needed a change." He shrugged, but I caught flickers of annoyance. "I don't mind keeping an eye on the bitch down there." He tapped the dungeon door.

'He gives me a bad feeling,' Nyx muttered.

'This is the one who has issues with Lycans,' I replied.

"Do you ever go down there?" I asked Grant.

"Why would I?"

I shrugged. "Curiosity?"

"I'm not curious about those assholes." His eyes widened as he realized what he'd said. "I didn't mean you... just, they... she's wasting space and resources."

'Digging his own grave, isn't he?' Nyx smirked as he stumbled over his words.

"Are we?" I asked. "Are we occupying your home? Are we starving you? Are we killing you off?"

"That's not what I meant," he protested.

"Then what is your problem?" I demanded, stepping closer. "This isn't the first time you've expressed hatred for my kind."

His hand moved toward the blade at his belt, but I was faster. My claws pierced his chest as a loud bang nearly deafened me. A small hole appeared beside Grant's forehead, followed by a trickle of blood. As he stumbled back, my claws retracted, and he collapsed to the ground.

I turned to see Theodore, his hand firmly gripping Liam's wrist. "Can't let the prick kill a pregnant woman, can I?"
###Chapter 0463

Her blue eyes shifted between me and Alexander before settling back on me.

"I saw the house." I gestured behind me. "Did this little brat have anything to do with it?"

She nodded while Alexander tried prying my fingers from his thin wrist. "Let go!" he shrieked. I simply rolled my eyes.

"You know I'm pregnant?" Athena asked with a frown.

I nodded. "I can see your soul clearly again." Alexander attempted to kick me. He had developed that nasty habit, so I lifted him off his feet. He dangled in the air, body swaying as he struggled. "That's why I left. I needed to figure out what was happening to me. Now the problem is solved."

She turned back to the dead Wolf. "I could have killed him."

*You could have. But that blade came too close to your stomach for my comfort."

She glanced down at her top, frowning as she touched the hole in the fabric.

"What should I do with this one?" I swung Alexander through the air deliberately. He whimpered instead of protesting.

Her gaze lingered on the boy. She knew punishment was necessary, yet she pitied him. That surprised me.

"Caleb is with Ryken." she murmured. "He's informing him about his son's actions."

"Then we'll go there." I pointed to the corpse. "I'll handle him later."

Caleb answered the door. A deep growl rumbled through him when he saw Alexander. "Bring him inside."

"Where's my Dad?" Alexander begged.

"I'm right here." Ryken replied as we entered the kitchen. I noticed Seraphina peeking through a slightly open door. It closed quietly when she saw me.

I dropped the brat into a chair. His gaze lowered immediately, eyes hardening as he asked for his mother.

"She isn't here right now. But she wants you to know she's disgusted by your behavior." Ryken told him, avoiding direct eye contact. "You blew up the packhouse. You destroyed the home of the pack that welcomed us. What were you thinking?"

"He wasn't." Athena muttered. I glanced over and saw her rubbing dried blood from her fingers.

"I'm sorry." Alexander whispered. He wasn't sorry at all. Not even a little bit.

"Are you, Alexander?" Caleb asked.

"Yes," Alexander whimpered.

"You can't stop lying, can you?" I sat on the kitchen counter. "When I look at you, I see no truth. Just a tangled web of lies. Where does it end? Where does it begin? It's impossible to tell."

Anger flashed in his brown eyes. His head was lowered, but I still saw it. "I suggest you start telling the truth."

"Asshole." he muttered under his breath. His arrogance for his age was astounding.

"ALEXANDER!" Ryken shouted.

Alexander crossed his arms and huffed, slumping in the chair.

"What did Levi want you to do?" I asked curiously.

He stared at me.

"Were you supposed to blow up the empty house? Or was that a mistake?"

He scrunched his face, still refusing to look at me.

"Answer the question." Athena snapped. She was ordering him to speak.

"He just said I'd know when the time was right."

"Was it the right time? Or did you panic because you got caught?" I pressed. My guess was panic. What was the point of setting off a bomb in an empty building?

"I..." His eyes moved to Athena. "I'm not supposed to say."

"Look around, you little shit." I snarled. "Do you think you're leaving here without talking?"

"To teach you a lesson." he blurted out. He shook his head, blonde ringlets bouncing. "He said to teach you a lesson. To show you that you don't have all the power." He started crying. Finally, fear set in. All it took was a small threat. I should have done this when he first upset my baby girl.

"Where were you going?" Athena asked him.

"He said he would wait for me." Alexander muttered between sniffles. "He wasn't there."
###Chapter 0464

"You were planning to run from your family?" Caleb demands, his voice tight. "Did you consider us at all? Did you care what your mother and I would feel?"

"You said I'm just like Seraphina!" Liam snaps back. "I heard you and mum talking."

"That's not what we said. We said we didn't want you turning out like your sister."

Liam shakes his head defiantly. Alexander moves toward a pale Athena. She looks ill, but I stay silent.

"Alexander, Athena," Caleb mutters, running a hand through his hair. "How do you want my son punished?"

"I have another question first." Athena frowns, pressing her hand to her mouth as she takes a steadying breath. "How was Levi speaking to you?"

"He came to my room." Liam whispers.

"He was inside my house?!" Caleb's voice rises sharply.

"Likely a projection." Alexander replies calmly. "Not physically present."

"Only there?" Athena asks. Liam nods.

"How many other children has he been manipulating without anyone knowing?" Alexander mutters, frustration evident.

"None." Liam pipes up. "He told me the others weren't good enough."

"Liam, that's what monsters like him say." Caleb tells his son.

"He promised."

"People like him make empty promises." Alexander states firmly. "He only wants you to do his dirty work. He doesn't care if you get punished."

"No. He said I was strong. That I was good. That I could do this. He said I'm his favorite."

"He doesn't see it." I tell the adults. "He doesn't recognize the manipulation. You won't get through to him."

"Then what do you propose?" Alexander asks.

"A few nights in the dungeon might give him perspective."

"You want to lock my child in the dungeons?" Caleb scoffs.

"It worked for your other child."

"She is an adult. He is not."

"Let me guess, your solution is to bind him. A punishment that won't truly impact him until he's older and gains his Lycan abilities? So we should punish him later for something he does now?"

Caleb stares at me, his brows furrowing in anger. "You can't put him in the dungeon. He's eight."

"Luc is right." Athena tells Caleb. "I know what binding feels like. Honestly, I would have preferred death. He'll spend a few days in the dungeon, and then we reassess." She meets Caleb's gaze. "No visitors."

He looks at his son, truly seeing him for the first time since we entered.

"Don't say it." Seraphina steps out from the doorway where she'd been hiding. "Don't say it, Caleb. Because he'll never be the same after."

"Go back to your room!" Caleb snaps.

"I'm only trying to—"

"Room. This doesn't concern you." Seraphina retreats as Caleb accepts Liam's punishment.

Alexander pulls a protesting Liam to his feet. With a hand on his shoulder, he guides him toward the door. Caleb says nothing more. He simply walks out as Liam calls for him.

I follow Alexander and Athena to the dungeons. The moment Evelyn sees me, she steps back until she hits the rear wall. Her eyes lock on me. Not with fear, but with anger. "Who is that?" She asks quietly.

"Levi got to him." Athena explains as Alexander locks Liam in a cell.

"He's a child." Evelyn mutters in disgust.

"Not his usual style?" I ask.

She steps forward, her fingers curling around the bars. She frowns and shakes her head. "He dislikes children."

Her blunt honesty surprises me, but I sense she's telling the truth.

"Is this what he does now? Ruins children?" She asks.

"He did it to you." Athena stops beside me, looking in at Evelyn. "And just like him, you couldn't see his actions were wrong."

"A part of me knew. And I... I let it happen. Maybe," she drops her voice to a whisper. "I can help. I can talk to him. Am I allowed to tell him who I am?"

She glances toward where Alexander is speaking with Liam.

"Within reason." Athena mutters.

"I understand."

I didn't. There was clearly a secret I wasn't privy to. I follow Athena up the steps. "Are you going to explain that? She's his sister, so what isn't she allowed to tell him?"

Athena turns and stares back at me. "What is it that you're not telling me?"
###Chapter 0465
Athena

"You vanished with Hannah, leaving only a note behind." My gaze remains fixed on him. "You return claiming to have solved your issues, yet you withhold the specifics. Are you truly healed, Luc? Or will you continue denying the truth like always?"

"Alright, I understand your anger!"

'Biggest understatement ever.' Nyx scoffs internally.

"I returned home. That's all. I went back hoping to find answers, but her brother," He gestures toward the dungeon door, "Materialized inside my house and pressed a fucking kitchen blade against Hannah's throat. He manipulated her into injecting something into me."

"Hannah injected you?"

"At some point, yes. She doesn't recall when. She doesn't even remember doing it." He retrieves a small black sphere from his pocket, holding it up to the light. "Like I said, it's been handled."

"What is that?"

"Something I haven't deciphered yet. It appears inert while I hold it. Yet when it struck the tray, it resonated like metal. Inside me, it was draining my energy. Making me progressively weaker."

"Has she been coerced into doing this to others? What about her? Is that why she lost her powers?"

He shakes his head. “I scanned her thoroughly, found nothing. Levi is meticulous.”

'There must be a flaw somewhere.' Nyx murmurs. 'Nobody's perfect. Everyone makes mistakes eventually.'

"Are you certain Hannah is clean?" I press.

He nods. "He terrifies her. Makes her anxious, nervous. She couldn't hold a conversation without constantly scanning the room. His effortless manipulation has deeply unsettled her."

His eyes sweep over me. "Now, are you going to reveal your plan?"

"I haven't fully figured it out yet."

"Right." Skepticism drips from his tone. "But it involves Evelyn, doesn't it?"

I remain silent.

"I'll take that as a clear refusal to elaborate further." I watch him stride away just as Alexander materializes beside me.

He doesn't speak, but his hand finds mine, pulling me gently toward the forest.

"What happened with Grant?" He asks once we're deep enough among the trees for privacy. "I know you had valid reasons. Where's the body?"

"Zachary handled it. I noticed blood on your fingers and asked him to identify the individual and clean up before anyone noticed."

"Grant made it abundantly clear he didn't want me here. Or any of the Lycans."

"The tear in your shirt is from him, right?" Alexander queries.

I glance down at my top. "His blade. Luc shot him."

"Okay." He settles on a fallen log, reaching for my hand. A slight frown creases his brow.

"Why bring me out here?"

"You needed a moment. A moment you wouldn't get surrounded by others."

"I'm fine...."

"I didn't say you weren't. Sometimes peace and quiet are necessary for clarity."

I sit beside him on the log, feeling tension leave my body. The past few days have been a relentless barrage of news. Before processing one event, another erupted. I haven't had time to process the new pregnancy either.

"I need him dead." The words escape quietly. "I can't continue living like this."

"We'll find a way." Alexander assures. "There's always a method to defeat someone."

"I want to attempt something." He waits for me to continue. "He's lost Evelyn. I see it when I look at her. She was slow to realize, but now she knows. She was disgusted Levi targeted Liam."

"You truly believe her?"

"Frustratingly, yes." I sigh, uncertain how he'll react. "I want Theodore to take Evelyn to him. I believe both hold the key to helping me kill him."
###Chapter 0466

He watches me closely. "What's your plan?"

"Tear him apart." I show him my claws.

'Rip him open.' Nyx adds with dark excitement.

"Only if I don't get to him first." He gives me a sharp smile. "That bastard is systematically dismantling my pack right before my eyes. No one has ever managed that. We were always solid, united. But now..." He shakes his head, frustration evident. "I won't allow it to continue."

'Levi Bennett won't survive the week.' Nyx whispers. 'Alexander didn't object to our plan.'

*****noveldrama

The twins slept between us in Brianna and Sebastian's guest room. Both were in human form, breathing softly. My brief absence had made my heart ache with longing. Just watching them filled me with overwhelming emotion.

"Once the house is rebuilt, we'll need a larger bed. Especially when we have more pups."

"Excuse me!" I whisper, careful not to disturb the boys. "One pup, not multiple!"

He smiles warmly. "One, two, even three. I don't care, as long as you and they are healthy." He leans over our sons to kiss my cheek. Why does he keep saying 'they'? I silently ask Nyx if she's hiding something.

'Too soon to tell.' she murmurs. 'Focus on the immediate threat.'

I woke multiple times to a small foot in my face or tiny fingers poking my nose. For such little boys, they moved constantly in their sleep.

Eventually I rose and settled into the rocking chair Brianna had provided. The twins wiggled onto Alexander's chest. While I adored watching them, my thoughts drifted to Levi Bennett's impending death. I refused to let him destroy more lives. I would never let him near my children.

Quietly I changed into jeans and a hoodie. Pulling on my boots, I slipped outside and headed to Theodore's place. Lights still glowed inside. Through the window I saw him at the table where he'd taught me to read for countless hours.

I tapped on the glass. His deep green eyes lifted to meet mine. "Athena?" He checked his watch. "Is something wrong?"

"Levi Bennett needs to die."

"If this is about the Witch Hunter theory again, I think Luc might have been onto something." He gestures me inside, closing the door quietly.

"We've all been doubtful about Luc lately, right?" He continues.

I nod. "But apparently it's resolved. It's complicated-"

"He told me everything."

"He told you?" I whisper in surprise. I'd had to pressure him for information.

"Yes. He showed me that little sphere. Told me about Hannah."

"Do you know what it was?"

"No. But even without Luc's explanation, I recognized the owner's scent. I don't know how, but when Luc handed it to me, I could smell him."

"Like a mate's scent?"

"Not exactly."

"I don't understand." I frown.

"Neither do I." He gestures to the open books surrounding him. "That's why I'm researching. Trying to find answers about what I truly am. Much of it makes sense even without reading."

"Like Luc, I'm different. I don't crave belonging. I'm not a true pack wolf, though I love this pack. I'll fulfill my duties, but now I understand why I never fit in, even before being accepted here. I was never meant to be a pack member. This might surprise you, but once Levi is dead, I'll be leaving to find my own path."
###Chapter 0467
Theodore

"Are you leaving?" Athena's voice was barely a whisper.

I gave a slow nod. "I have to discover the truth about myself. You, more than anyone, would understand that need."

"Does anyone else know?"

"I only made the decision recently."

Her gaze drifted past me to the stacks of books. "Where will you head?"

"Wherever the path leads." I offered her a reassuring smile. "This isn't goodbye, not yet. And when it is, it won't be permanent. Since my past came to light, I can't stop questioning everything. I've researched you, other Lycans, even Alexander, but never myself. Never felt the necessity."

"Until now?"

"Until now," I confirmed. "All I know comes from my original pack, and that information was scarce." I motioned toward a chair. "Please, sit."

"It won't be the same without you here. Who will serve as pack physician?"

"The nurses who've assisted me are fully qualified. They'll be here to help with the birth, whether it's one pup or more."

"You knew?"

"Didn't require genius deduction. You've been touching your stomach since you arrived. How far along are you?"

"It's still early," she murmured. "Why does everyone assume multiples?"

"Twins are common in the Black family lineage."

"Alexander isn't a twin," she countered.

I pressed my lips together. He hadn't told her. "Theodore?"

"Alexander was a twin during gestation."

"What?"

"My apologies, I truly believed you knew." I mentally chastised myself for the slip. "His twin was stillborn."

She stared at me, completely stunned.

"It's not something he discusses." I attempted damage control. Alexander might actually kill me for this. "I genuinely thought you were aware, Athena."

"No... no, I wasn't." Her gaze dropped to her abdomen. "I only came to ask for your help setting up Levi. Now I understand why Alexander keeps saying there's more than one."

I remained silent, deciding it was the safest response.

"Could I have some water?" she asked softly.

"Of course." I moved to the kitchen and returned to find Athena flipping through my current reading material.

"Athena. I'm certain he has reasons for not..."

"Will you help me with Levi?" She cut me off.

"You know I will, but I'm unsure how I can assist."

"I need you to take Evelyn to him."

"You want her released from the dungeons?"

"She has her Lycan now. Dakota won't allow betrayal. Her Lycan believes she's destined to be my Beta."

"Your Beta?" That was unusual. Betas were chosen, not inherited. Usually.

She nodded confirmation.

"So I take her to him, then what?"

"Make him vulnerable. Make him think all his dreams are coming true so I can infiltrate his mind."

"When?"

"No time like the present."

"It's the middle of the night."

"Exactly. I can't wait any longer."

We moved swiftly across the grounds, stopping at the dungeon entrance where Zachary waited.

"What are you doing here?" Athena whispered.

"Saw you heading toward Theodore's place. Figured you might need assistance, and this would be your destination." He offered a reassuring smile that said he was fully committed.

"Theodore is taking Evelyn to Levi," Athena informed him. "I need to be distant enough that he can't catch my scent, but ready for when his guard drops."

"No offense intended, but why would Theodore be the solution? After what happened when Levi projected here, he'll be expecting something."

"Yes, he will," I confirmed. "My time with him was brief but educational. He learns from his mistakes quickly. He won't fall for the same trick twice, but if Evelyn is with me, he might believe I've switched allegiances."

"And he still believes Theodore is his mate," Athena added. "He won't give up on him easily."

Zachary paused briefly before nodding. "Alright. Someone needs to ensure your safety." His dark eyes shifted to me. "Though I have a suggestion."

"What's that?"

"If he believes you're mated to him, lead him down that path but maintain distance. It will drive him insane."

Both Caleb and Evelyn were asleep in their cells. I felt sympathy for the boy but understood Alexander and Athena's reasoning. Had he been an adult, his actions would have earned him execution by fire or tearing.

Zachary quietly opened Evelyn's cell. He moved silently inside as she began stirring, quickly covering her mouth to prevent screams that would wake Caleb.
###Chapter 0468

Her grey eyes widened as he pulled her upright, releasing his grip. "Now?" she whispered breathlessly.

"Yes." Athena confirmed.

We kept Evelyn wedged securely between Zachary and myself as we ascended the steps into the night air. She offered no resistance, no challenge. But the moment her feet touched the grass, she inhaled deeply as if tasting freedom for the first time.

Zachary observed Evelyn intently while Athena explained what would happen next.

"What should I tell him?" Evelyn asked nervously.

"That's your decision." Athena replied.

"I don't understand."

"You sought help, even through misguided methods. Now prove your worth."

"You want me to kill him?"

"No." Zachary stated firmly. "Just make him believe we're unaware of your presence. That Theodore freed you."

"He always knows when I'm lying."

"Then find a way to conceal the truth." Athena instructed.

"Okay...okay. I can do this." Evelyn muttered to herself. Her grey eyes locked with mine. "You're the one he thinks is his mate."

"Yes."

"One more thing." Athena added. "Don't mention Liam."

"We'll accompany you to the gate." Zachary told me. "But you must proceed alone. If anything changes, link me immediately."

"You can mind-link with Wolves?" Evelyn whispered in astonishment.

"I can."

She tilted her head thoughtfully but remained silent.

Sebastian stood guard at the gate. He asked no questions, likely already informed through Zachary's link since gate duty wasn't his usual assignment.

Evelyn emitted a small gasp as we passed through the gates. After her prolonged confinement in our dungeons, she probably never expected to experience any form of freedom—though her current situation hardly qualified as free.

"How far?" she whispered once we separated from Athena and Zachary.

"He's hiding at Seraphina's house."

"Still there?"

"I suppose we'll find out."

She asked no further questions, which surprised me. Thrown into a plan with minimal details, she adapted remarkably well.

The house eventually came into view. "I ruined things with Seraphina, didn't I?" she whispered regretfully. "She was a good friend, but I couldn't reveal everything."

"It happens sometimes." I murmured, watching the house. A single light glowed as usual. After nightfall, we always remained in the main room—firstly so he could block the entrance, secondly to keep close surveillance. Was he watching us now?

The front door swung open, revealing a boot before his full form emerged. He moved deliberately slowly. "I know you're there." he called out. "I can smell you."

I stepped from the shadows, keeping Evelyn's hands secured behind her back. Zachary's suggested approach felt impossible when anger still burned through me. This bastard had stabbed me.

He took another step toward us, sniffing the air. Athena had been right—he wanted to confirm we were alone.

"I didn't think you'd return to me."

"They had me in—" Evelyn began.

"I wasn't speaking to you, Evelyn. We'll discuss your situation shortly." I felt her tense. He'd made promises he never intended to keep.

"I brought your sister." I stated flatly.

"Then bring her inside." He grinned at me.

I pushed Evelyn forward. She released a growl that I hoped was meant solely for him. "Is it really you or are you projecting?"

"It's me."

I forced a smile.

"I thought I'd upset you. But now I realize you were probably confused and disoriented. I shouldn't have drugged you, and I've been looking for ways to make amends." He told me.

"What about me?" Evelyn asked.

His tone shifted instantly, eyes narrowing. "I said I'd get to you."

"No Levi! You promised me! You said you'd come for me! I've been rotting in that disgusting dungeon and you never even tried to help me!"

I felt almost impressed, considering she'd told Athena she couldn't lie.

"Evelyn. You were never in danger."

"Threat of execution isn't danger?" She snapped back.

Levi slapped her hard across the face, knocking her to the ground. "I said we'll discuss it later."

Her grey eyes burned with fury as his handprint bloomed on her cheek, but she remained on the ground, possibly struggling to control her Lycan. I remembered how difficult those early days had been for Athena.

"You don't need to hit her." I said calmly. "She's been imprisoned. Given limited food. Had her head shaved."

He looked at me dismissively. "She was supposed to be strong, bloodthirsty. Now look at her—she's become completely useless."
###Chapter 0469

Hello, lovely readers.

I'm sending this quick note to let you know I've caught that nasty bug that's been going around.

There won't be an update today, the 11th.

My head is too foggy to focus on editing properly.

I want to avoid any mistakes.

Thank you, as always, for continuing to read.

Your gems, reviews, and comments mean the world to me.

For those asking about the book's ending, there is still so much story left.

Poor Zachary has yet to meet his second-chance mate and find his happy ending.

I'm hoping to feel much better tomorrow.

Please stay safe.
###Chapter 0470
Theodore

"Pathetic!" Evelyn scoffs from the floor. "I am not pathetic!"

"I believed this was your desire." I keep my voice steady. "I thought you wished for her return."

"I desired you more." Levi turns away and enters the cabin. I help Evelyn stand and we follow him inside.

"You had no intention of intervening, did you?" Evelyn demands. "You were content to abandon me there like some rabid animal!"

"You fulfilled your purpose. I'm pursuing superior options now." He settles on the sofa, completely unfazed by our presence.

"Explain yourself." I speak before Evelyn can unleash another tirade.

"All will be revealed in time."

"For once in your miserable existence, speak plainly!" I snap. "You know I detest your riddles and evasive language."

He glares at his sister. "She has become useless to me. So I replaced her with someone actually willing to do what's necessary."

"Who?"

He smiles at me, his sage green eyes gleaming with amusement.

"If you're implying it's me, you're mistaken. I won't tear apart a pack for you." I tell him firmly. "I refuse to destroy the greatest thing I've ever known."

"Relax, Theodore. You would never commit such an act. That's precisely why it isn't you."

"Then who?"

"He's already destroyed the packhouse." He speaks with a sinister smile. "Tell me, who was injured? Your precious Alpha? His sons? The female Alpha? I've been anticipating news ever since I saw the smoke."

"You were nearby when it happened?" I ask.

"One of many locations I've visited recently." He runs a hand through his blonde hair, brushing it back from his face.

If he had been nearby, even just projecting himself, why hadn't he met Alexander as promised?

"Why are you doing this?" Evelyn asks.

"Because dear sister, there are far too many people who believe they know better."

I snort derisively. It was the same manipulative rhetoric he had tried to force on me. The man was completely delusional.

"So who was killed or injured? Do tell." He waits with eager anticipation.

"No one."

"What do you mean?"

"The house was empty, Levi. Not a single soul was inside. All you accomplished was strengthening their unity as the pack rallied to extinguish the fire."

"He told me..."

"You mean a child deceived you?" I knew Athena preferred we didn't discuss Alexander, but Levi had already brought it up. "Damn little brat. Just when I thought I could reach another child."

"Another child?"

"Me." Evelyn whispers. "He's referring to me. After our brother died, I was the first." Her head snaps toward him, pure rage burning in her eyes. "You weakened me. You fed me lies that made me believe you were righteous."

"And you were foolish enough to believe every word!" He tells her coldly.

"What you've done is monstrous! None of us deserved this. None of us. Do you even comprehend that? You made me believe the Moon Goddess sent you for a purpose. You claimed all those people were being punished by her. That you were merely her messenger. Is that what you told the boy?"

He opens his mouth to retaliate. But Evelyn continues her furious rant.

"You're worse than evil. You deserve to lose everything. You stole people's abilities. You took mine, promising it was for my protection." She shakes her head in disgust. "You made me believe I was doing right. You shielded me from my true self. I lost my friend because of you. I lost everything because of you."

She lunges forward and grabs him, yanking him from the sofa. His eyes widen in shock at her sudden aggression. He wrestles against her, fighting for dominance as she pins him to the floor. Locking her hands on his jacket shoulders, she repeatedly smashes his head against the carpet while screaming accusations.

I notice how completely black her eyes have become. They resemble Athena's when her Lycan forces its way forward. But I don't intervene. I stand motionless and let it happen. Because Evelyn is right—this is the least he deserves.

"Get off me, you insane bitch!" Levi swings an arm wildly, hitting nothing but air.

A ferocious growl erupts from Evelyn as she begins to shift. Her increased weight easily holds him down as her clothing tears away, revealing her massive Lycan form. Still, I do nothing. Her attack intensifies, claws slicing into him. She bites into his flesh as he struggles, but none of the wounds are fatal. As if she's deliberately holding back.
###Chapter 0471

Levi Bennett muttered strange words under his breath in a foreign tongue. Nothing happened. With one final powerful strike, Evelyn Reed knocked him unconscious.

Her Lycan strength remained formidable despite the long imprisonment.

Blood splattered across the carpet around Levi's fallen form. Evelyn rose to her full height, nearly hitting the low ceiling. This wasn't the planned outcome. She wasn't supposed to attack him directly. But we could use this unexpected turn to our advantage. We could bring him back to Athena.

Slowly, Evelyn's eyes shifted back to their normal grey hue. "Seraphina probably left some clothes upstairs," I told her. She nodded quickly and hurried from the room. Her heavy footsteps echoed on the staircase.

I searched for the chains Levi had used to restrain me. Instead, I found a drawer filled with syringes. Each contained a thick yellow liquid. Without hesitation, I took one and injected the unconscious Levi in the neck.

His distinct scent vanished within seconds. My racing heart finally began to calm.

"Theodore?" Evelyn's voice was soft as she peered around the kitchen doorway.

"He's alive. You didn't kill him," I confirmed. "I administered a drug. He won't be able to fight us or Athena now."

She nodded slowly. "There's something else." She glanced behind her and moved forward cautiously. Another woman stood behind her. Long obsidian hair framed her face, falling nearly to her navel.

Her scent was barely detectable, as if struggling to break through. It was so faint it explained why I hadn't sensed her presence in the house. Rope burns marked her wrists and ankles. Her trainers were scuffed and dirty. She needed thorough cleaning.

"She was tied up upstairs," Evelyn explained. "This is the right thing to do, isn't it?"

"Absolutely. What's your name?" I asked gently.

"What's yours?" she countered.

"Theodore."

"Jasmine," she whispered. "Jasmine Reed."

"Interesting name," Evelyn commented with a slight smile.

I nodded, hoping her name didn't reflect her actual personality. It literally meant chaos, new moon. "Are you a Wolf?"

"I was." She kept her voice low, turning her face toward Levi. I still couldn't see her eyes clearly. "He took it from me. Now I don't know what I am."

She reached for a knife. Instinctively, I grabbed her wrist. "We're taking him back to the Alpha. You can come with us too," I offered. I felt certain Alexander would offer her sanctuary if she needed help.

"The Alpha?" she asked from behind her dark hair curtain. "Does he transform to look like her?" She pointed at Evelyn.

"One of them does," I told her. Sometimes I forgot that many people still didn't know about Lycans, even though they probably outnumbered us. They had lived hidden in plain sight for generations.

"I don't want to go."

"We have others like you. People who had their abilities taken. They're Lycans though, like her." I gestured toward Evelyn.

"Lycans." She tested the word on her tongue.

"Yes."

"Did he take their abilities too?" She nodded toward Levi. As she lifted her face, her hair fell aside, revealing startling golden eyes.

"Yes."

"But they haven't regained their abilities?"

"No."

"A faint scent?" She frowned slightly.

"They smell completely Human. Did he drug you?"

"No. He muttered something over me." Her brow creased in a small frown. "What will your Alpha do with him?" Her golden eyes held mine intently.

"Skin him alive," Evelyn blurted out. I glanced at her. Her eyes were wide, her lips curved into a smile. She seemed somehow freer. Perhaps hearing the truth from Levi had cleared her confusion.

"You won't do that. I heard him. He called you his sister," Jasmine murmured.

"I just helped you! Don't be a bitch!" Evelyn snapped back.

"I'm not trying to be." Her golden eyes flashed toward me. "Would I be safe there?"

"Safer than here."

She shook her head. "I think it's better if I stay on my own."

"Where's your pack?"

She grimaced. "I was running from them when he convinced me he was my mate."
###Chapter 0472
Theodore

"Why?" Evelyn asks Jasmine.

"It's a long story. I'd prefer not to discuss it."

Levi groans from the floor, drawing my attention. "There must be a reason. How did he locate you?"

"Can we not." She turns away sharply. "I understand your curiosity. I'd feel the same discovering someone tied up. But I don't need others involved in my problems. Just assure me he'll be handled, and I'll be on my way."

"If you're fleeing someone, they always find you eventually."

Her golden eyes lock onto mine. "Then perhaps I'll simply become a ghost."

I should let her leave. She made her desires clear. Yet she was right—I was curious. Why did Levi have her here?

He groaned again, his eyes fluttering open. The dawning horror on his face made me smile. A taste of his own medicine was merely the beginning.

"What did you do to me?" he demanded, struggling to sit up.

"I thought you'd appreciate the irony of being injected with your own concoction."

Evelyn laughed, and his gaze snapped to her. "You foolish bitch. Just wait. I'll make you pay for this."

Evelyn crouched before him. "I believed you every other time you threatened me. Not this time. This is your end, Levi."

He turned to Jasmine. "Jasmine, release me."

"Why would I do that? You held me here against my will. You made me believe a lie."

"That's his specialty," Evelyn added. She stood and faced Jasmine. "You're not the first to believe you're mated to him. It's how he lures people in. He preys on those he thinks need correcting."

"I gathered that from all the shouting," Jasmine muttered. "I just don't understand why you haven't killed him yet. You look like some kind of powerful mutant. Pretty sure you could destroy anything in your path."

"Theodore told you," Evelyn murmured. "The Alpha wants him."

"Come on, Evelyn. You're not really taking me to them, are you?" Levi shuffled against the wall, leaning back. His eyes darted around the room, searching for an exit, but he designed this place with only one way in or out.

"He never stops, does he?" Jasmine muttered.

"Because he craves control and knows he's lost it."

"Theodore," Levi whispered my name. "You won't do this to me. I mean too much to you."

"What is he talking about?" Jasmine demanded.

"He believes we are mates."

She raised an eyebrow at me. "Are you?"

"Not long ago, he held me prisoner here. He drugged me, attempted to mark me, yet kept me in chains."

She turned back to Levi. "A bit kinky? All I got were thick ropes."

Evelyn looked away, stifling a laugh.

"You don't seem bothered about being tied up," I frowned.

"I should be, shouldn't I? But he fed me, and I had a decent bed. The lack of scent meant my pack couldn't find me. Silver lining." She shrugged. "But it doesn't mean I'm okay with what he did to me. Or from the sounds of it, what he's done to others. That's just messed up."

She wandered to the kitchen, rummaging through the cupboards.

"Do we just leave?" Evelyn whispered. "What about her?"

"She doesn't want to come. I can't force her. She refuses help. And we have him to deal with." "Okay."

"You won't win," Levi smirked at us. "Do you think it ends with me?"

"Yes." I yanked him to his feet, and he tried to shove me. But that strength he had when he struck me was long gone.
###Chapter 0473
"We're leaving." I announce to Jasmine.

She peeks around the doorframe, a spoon between her lips. Stepping into the room, she holds a jar of jam in one hand, carefully scooping another portion.

"You're actually going through with it?" She licks the spoon clean. "I assumed you changed your mind since you took so long." She sets the jar down, smacking her lips.

"Wait, can someone tell me where I am? He took me in the middle of the night. I'm completely lost." *A few miles from Obsidian Howl."

"That's it? That's all I've managed to figure out." She glares at a smirking Levi. "You absolute prick."

"What is it?" I ask.

"I'm from Dawnmist."

"Dawnmist? Where is that?"

She glances at Levi. "It was formerly called Crestwood City. The new Alpha renamed it."

*Alpha Julian renamed the pack?"

*Alpha Julian has been dead for ages. The new Alpha is Alpha Silas. He slaughtered the Alpha, took control, and moved his men in."

*He wasn't already part of the pack?"

She shakes her head. "He was an outsider."

I turn to Levi. "And you didn't think he deserved punishment?"

He just smirks at me. I might ask Athena to remove his lips first. Permanently.

*He wants to rule all Wolves." Jasmine informs us.

"Well, he took one pack."

*No, you don't understand. All Wolves. Everywhere. He believes they should all bow to him."

"Why?"

She shrugs. "The usual reasons, I suppose. Some people are just power-hungry. Nothing else matters to them. The problem is, many agree with him."

"Get what you wanted, mate?" Levi asks.

*You are not my mate." I tell him yet again. "What did you do, Jasmine?"

"Well, I sort of made a promise I never intended to keep."

"What kind of promise?" Evelyn asks, completely engrossed in the gossip.

*Honestly, it's not that terrible. He just... didn't take it well. If he catches me, he will kill me. Without a doubt."

*It must be bad." Evelyn scoffs.

*You're all so dramatic." She throws her hands up and flops onto the sofa. She exhales heavily. "I terminated the Alpha's pup. I had a one-night stand with him before I knew who he was. My contraception failed. Then he attacked. Alpha Julian wasn't the only one who died. Many others did too. He spared me only because he recognized me from our night together. I knew right then I couldn't keep it."

"I spent days in the mansion with him. He made all these promises to me. He asked for promises in return. Then he slaughtered my best friend. So I did what I had to do. I found a Human hospital. I couldn't go to our doctor. It would be a sin. I probably would have been killed. So I slipped out when I could. I had a good head start until he found me."

"And that's why you stripped her abilities?" I snap at Levi.

"I have my reasons."

*You should warn your Alpha about Alpha Silas. If you live nearby, you'll become a target. I guarantee it." Jasmine tells us.

I keep my mouth shut. She doesn't need to know the number of Wolves and Lycans in our pack.

*Come with me." I offer again. "You can tell them yourself."

"Why? You know nothing about me!"

"We have someone who can tell if you're lying."

"I don't understand."

"If you're telling the truth, you have nothing to fear."
###Chapter 0474

Athena

“Why is there no news?” I ask Zachary. The sun would rise soon, yet we heard nothing. Neither Theodore nor Evelyn had linked us.

I glance back over my shoulder. We were about a mile from home. Alexander must still be asleep, or he would be in my head, questioning my location.

“A little longer,” Zachary mutters. “Unless you can get into his mind.”

“I tried,” I sigh. “It’s the same as always—nothing. I just… I need him dead. This urge to end him is overwhelming.”

There’s still time. Theodore knows what to do.

How can you be so sure everything will work?

I have a hunch. Maybe you should talk about something else.

I nod. “Did you know Alexander was a twin?”

“No, I didn’t.” He furrows his brow. “What happened?”

Stillborn. Theodore told me. I probably shouldn’t discuss it before speaking to Alexander, but Zachary was right—I needed a distraction. Nyx was no help at all.

“And you’re worried?” he asks.

Everyone keeps saying I’m automatically carrying more than one. What if it’s true and something goes wrong?

The boys are healthy, he tells me through a yawn.

“This doesn’t stop,” I say, pointing to my head.

“It’s good that you’re concerned. I’d worry if you weren’t.” He smiles at me. “You’ll find out soon. If you’re still worried, just have Theodore do more scans.”

Theodore is leaving.

Since when?

“He told me he’s leaving after we kill Levi. He wants to find his place. I don’t want him to go, but I understand,” I sigh.

“We all want to find our place in the world, Athena. It’s not the same for everyone.”

We stand in silence, hidden by the trees as the sun rises. “We should go after them,” I mutter.

“No, we don’t need to.” He points up the road. Theodore is pushing Levi forward. Levi stumbles, struggling to stay upright. Evelyn is talking to another female.

“Who is that?” I ask quietly.

“No idea. Definitely a Wolf, but her scent is faint.”

“She’s not from this pack,” I mutter.

“No, she isn’t,” he confirms, his dark eyes fixed on the road as they approach.

Three times, Theodore has to pull Levi up from the ground. Levi is clearly falling on purpose, looking for an escape.

Zachary steps slightly in front of me. It’s his instinct when he senses a threat.

“Who are you?” he demands, his eyes locking on the long-haired woman.

Her golden eyes widen. She wasn’t expecting such a blunt greeting. It’s how Theodore and Zachary differ.

“Her name is Jasmine,” Theodore answers for her. “Levi was holding her hostage. He took her abilities.”

Not all, since she still has a trace of scent, Zachary glares at her.

“He didn’t do it the same way as the others,” Theodore explains.

A spell, Jasmine adds.

“And you brought her here?” Zachary asks.

“We’re not inside Obsidian Howl yet,” Theodore replies. His deep green eyes settle on me. “Are you or Alexander aware that Crestwood City changed its name to Dawnmist?”

“No.”

“It was a forced change,” Jasmine adds. “It wasn’t our Alpha. The new guy takes over.”

“So you thought we would take her in?” I ask with a frown. I didn’t want any part of this.

Theodore doesn’t answer.

“It’s fine,” Jasmine tells us. “I understand.” Her gaze shifts to Theodore, who is holding Levi steady. “I told you this was a mistake. I’m better off alone. I can figure it out.”
###Chapter 0475

Theodore grins, and that arrogant smirk makes my blood boil. I step around Zachary, squaring up to the half-Witch. He stared down at me, our height difference painfully obvious. If his hands weren't restrained by Theodore, I'd be standing too close for comfort.

"What's so amusing, Levi?" I press a single claw tip against his abdomen, just below his navel. His smile vanishes instantly, replaced by a flash of agony in his eyes.

"I gave him the same injection he used on the others," Theodore informs me. "He can't project. He can't heal. He's completely powerless."

"Is that true?" I push the claw deeper. Levi clenches his jaw, breathing heavily through the pain. It must be excruciating, but he hides it well.

"Tell me, Levi. Why did you think you had the right to do this to so many people?"

His lips part slightly, just enough to mutter the word 'punishment'.

"Then what should your punishment be?" I retract the claw, and he hunches forward, cursing under his breath.

I hear Jasmine whispering to Evelyn. "She can control her shift?"

"Yes."

"Holy hell!"

Zachary snaps his head toward her but stays silent.

"I've already been punished," Levi mutters.

"For what?"

"Doing the Moon Goddess's job," he snarls.

I see Evelyn shake her head and roll her eyes.

I drive another claw into him, and he hisses in pain. "I can keep this up all day."

"Then fucking kill me, you whore."

Why do they always resort to that word?

Levi stumbles sideways as Zachary lands a right hook, cracking his jaw. My claw slices through his stomach effortlessly. He collapses to the ground as Theodore releases him.

Levi presses his hands into the dirt, forcing himself up. Blood soaks through his already stained shirt. "Remember, Athena, there's always someone worse."

"Who are you talking about?"

He grins at me again, blood staining his perfect white teeth.

My gaze shifts to the women behind him. Evelyn watches intently while Jasmine covers her mouth.

Levi spits a mouthful of blood at me, laughing when it hits my cheek. "I should have come for you, though you were never my target. The precious last female Alpha. You would've made an excellent trophy. Such pretty blue eyes. Pity you're female."

He presses against his wounds and drops to his knees. He continues hurling slurs at me. Theodore grabs Levi's head, his hands firm on either side, and twists until we hear the sickening crack of his neck.

Theodore releases him, and for a moment, Levi's body remains perfectly still. A gentle breeze pushes him, and he collapses the short distance to the ground.

Evelyn gasps as Theodore meets my eyes. "It was always meant to be me, Athena. I couldn't listen to him speak to you like that any longer."

I nod, too stunned to form words. I never expected Theodore to go through with it, but he proved his loyalty beyond doubt.

"Okay, I thought Alpha Julian was insane, but you people might have just outdone him," Jasmine splutters.

Evelyn steps forward and looks down at her brother. "You finally got what you deserved, Levi. I warned you years ago that you'd mess with the wrong person." Her grey eyes meet mine. "Thank you."

"So what now?" Jasmine asks. "We just stand here over..." She sniffs the air. "I can smell you." She turns to face Zachary, pointing a finger at him. "And I can definitely smell you."
###Chapter 0476
Zachary

Her floral scent is overwhelming.
Far more intense than Isabella's subtle vanilla ever was.
When I told Athena that Jasmine carried a distinct scent, I never clarified it was the mark of my destined mate.
Was I prepared for another mate when even speaking Isabella's name still felt like a blade twisting in my chest?

“Are you going to say something?” she demands, her golden eyes fixed on me as she hurriedly twists her long obsidian hair into a low bun.

I turn to Athena. “We need to bring the body back to the pack.”

“You’re just going to ignore me?” Jasmine scowls, her voice sharp.

“I’m not ignoring you,” I reply, frowning.

“Is there someone else?” she presses, her gaze unwavering.

“Yes, and she is dead!” I snap, the words tearing out of me.
She immediately drops her gaze.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that. I… me and my big mouth.”

“I need time to process this. There’s too much happening right now.”

“His heart is beating,” Athena murmurs, cutting off whatever Jasmine was about to say next.
Her hand is pressed against his chest, and she takes a quick step back as his lungs suddenly expand with a ragged breath.

“I broke his neck,” Theodore states, his voice low and grim. “He has no abilities. He can’t possibly survive that.”

“What do we do?” Evelyn asks, her voice tense.

I move quickly, yanking the belt from my jeans.
While Levi is still disoriented, I bind his hands tightly behind his back, ensuring he can’t move them.

“Cover his eyes,” Athena mutters, pulling off her sweatshirt.
I rip a sleeve off and tie the fabric tightly around his head, blocking his vision.
Lifting his shirt, I frown. “His wounds have healed, too.”

“What?” Athena leans over my shoulder to look. “How is that possible?”

“Is it possible his own potions don’t work on him?” Jasmine suggests. “Or maybe they don’t work completely?”

“I don’t…” He begins to stir.
I glance at everyone and press a finger to my lips.
Levi didn’t need to know our plans or our destination.

“Theodore,” Levi calls out, his voice unnervingly calm. “I know you’re still here. I can smell your delicious scent. I know you’re frustrated, but I can forgive what you just did to me. All you have to do is let me see those beautiful deep green eyes of yours.”

Athena shakes her head at Theodore, a silent warning not to speak or move.
It was strange to see Theodore so enraged, but he stayed quiet.
He understood this was some kind of trap.

A slow smile spreads across Levi’s face. “Is the Alpha telling you to keep your distance? You know you don’t have to listen to her. She isn’t your Alpha.”

Theodore’s hands clench into tight fists.
Evelyn places a calming hand on his shoulder, shaking her head at him.

“Is someone going to say something?” Levi presses, a thread of irritation weaving through his falsely pleasant tone.

He starts to laugh when we all remain silent.
The sound is forced, and his irritation is clearly growing. “You can’t kill me, but you’ve figured that out now. I will continue to be your problem, and you will never be able to stop me.”

Athena creeps closer to him and leans down, her voice a venomous whisper near his ear. “There is a way to kill everyone, but I want your death to be as slow and as painful as possible. You staying alive means I get exactly what I want.”

“Have you learned nothing?” he seethes, his body tensing.

Athena gestures for me to haul him to his feet. “More than enough,” she tells him coldly. “You keep telling me there’s always someone worse. Well, I’m about to become your worst someone. You will wish you had stayed dead just now.”

“Bring it on,” he dares, a smirk in his voice.

Athena turns and strides decisively toward the pack.
Evelyn and Jasmine hurry past me.
While Evelyn seems focused on catching up to Athena, Jasmine’s golden eyes are filled with a mix of confusion and wonder as they linger on me.

Theodore grabs Levi’s left side, and I quickly take his right.
We haul him roughly to his feet.
“You are making a mistake. Theodore, I can offer you so much more,” Levi insists.

Theodore finally breaks his silence. “No, you can’t. If they don’t kill you, I will, and I will be a damn sight more thorough. You’re right, Levi. Those initials on your chest are for me. My name is Theodore Daudet, and I am a Witch Hunter.”

Levi tenses up, digging his heels into the ground to resist being dragged forward. “It’s a trick,” he scoffs, though doubt now colors his voice.

“No trick. You just didn’t do your research.”

“You’re lying. You know I don’t like it when you lie,” Levi growls. “I can smell your scent.”

“I’ve already killed you once. Why would I do that if we were mates?” Theodore challenges.
I was truly seeing a different side of him.
He was always the voice of reason, but push him too far, and a dangerous predator emerges.

“I know you can smell me,” Levi insists, a desperate edge to his voice now.

“You’re right, I can,” Theodore says, his voice cold and flat. “At first, I believed what you were saying was true. Until I spoke to another Hunter. What I was smelling is what tells me I’m supposed to kill you. It was tolerable at first, but the more time we spent together, the more it turned vile.”
###Chapter 0477

Levi's lips press into a thin, bloodless line. The blindfold hides his eyes, but I can feel the rage radiating from him.

We haul him forward. He begins shouting for Jasmine. She glances back at him once, then her gaze flicks to me before she quickens her pace to catch up with Athena.

"Jasmine, I saved you!" Levi yells.

The words make her freeze mid-step. She doesn't turn around this time.

"You stole her abilities," Theodore snarls at him.

"Two birds, one stone. She was running. She needed punishment. I punished her. They couldn't find her. I saved her. I save them all."

"You call that saving?" Theodore demands. "Stealing their power isn't salvation."

Levi stays silent. I look at Jasmine. She has shoved her hands deep into her pockets and dropped her head low as she follows the others. Is that agreement? Theodore said she was Levi's prisoner, but what if it began differently?

"Enough," I mutter to Theodore. We pick up the pace, lifting Levi clear off the ground. He desperately tries to engage us, switching between threats, questions, and pleas aimed mostly at Theodore. The realization that his words are useless is finally dawning on him.

The women vanish around the bend leading to Obsidian Howl's gates. When we arrive, the gates stand wide open. A massive gathering of shifted Wolves and Lycans waits inside. Athena and Alexander stand at the front, poised for the hunt.

"What is this?" Levi demands as we halt. Theodore and I set him down, his feet hitting the ground firmly. He struggles against our hold. Athena gives me a sharp nod.

I release his shoulders and unbuckle the belt binding his wrists. He frantically rips off the blindfold and goes completely still.

"You think this frightens me?" His eyes sweep over the waiting army. He starts muttering under his breath. My fist connects with his jaw for the second time.

"Bastard!" he snarls, clutching his face.

"It seems you enjoy games," Athena's voice is ice. "So let's play. You get five seconds." Alexander smiles coldly.

"For what?" Levi spits out.

"A head start. I start counting the moment you enter the forest. You can figure out the rest." Levi scoffs. "You can't find me if you can't scent me."

Luc moves silently behind him. A blade flashes, slicing a long line down Levi's back. Luc takes a piece of cloth and rubs it in the flowing blood.

"Son of a bitch," Levi growls.

"Thanks," Luc smirks, carrying the bloodied cloth to the crowd. It's passed around. Every creature inhales the metallic scent.

"Can't hide the scent of blood," Alexander mutters. "Don't bother trying to wash it off. It lingers."

Levi looks at Theodore. "He can't be serious."

"It was mine and Athena's idea," Theodore steps closer. "You should have stayed dead. This will be painful. This time, there is no survival."

"Whenever you're ready," Alexander tells him.

Levi scans the crowd, his eyes landing on his sister. "Evelyn. Don't let them do this."

She doesn't answer. She moves to stand beside Athena.

"Control is a funny thing," I mutter. "You have it until you don't. Take it for granted, and you lose it. You lose all of it."

He glares pure hatred at me.

"And from what happened with Jasmine, the moment Theodore snapped your neck, everyone you screwed over got their abilities back. If by some miracle someone here doesn't kill you, those prisoners of yours will come for you. I'll be happy to help them."

He spits in my direction and looks back at Athena.

"Run," she growls.

He turns toward the open gate. Caleb and a few others, including Seraphina, block his path. His only choice is the forest.

He starts backing toward the trees, his eyes locked on us. He pauses at the very edge.

"Go to hell!" He bolts into the dense woods as Alexander calls out, "Five."

Everyone crouches, ready to charge.

"Four."

Alexander begins stripping, preparing to shift.

"Three."

Jasmine stares at me, utterly confused by the events. I need to learn how she first encountered Levi.

"Two."

The Lycans and Wolves are growling. I turn to face the forest. There's no way I'm letting him escape.

"One."
###Chapter 0478
Alexander

The pack surges forward.
Standard procedure.
They hunt first.
I allow them the initial tracking before joining.
Athena’s blue eyes flick toward me.
She is vibrating with readiness.

‘Let them have their moment. His fate is sealed.’ I link her.

She gives a sharp nod.
Howls and snarls erupt from the forest depths.
Birds scatter into the sky, fleeing the coming violence.

I count silently to ten.
Blair rushes to Athena’s side. “Please, let me go after him!”
“You have your abilities restored. Can you shift without turning Rogue?” Athena questions.
Blair remains silent.
“Then I suggest you remain here,” Athena states firmly.

‘Our turn.’ I link Athena.

She runs beside me, then shifts.
Her clothes shred as her body expands.
It amazes me every single time.
Doing it while pregnant is even more remarkable.

She tears through the trees effortlessly.
Her movement is nearly silent.
She pauses occasionally, altering course repeatedly.
I allow her to lead.
She hasn’t hunted like this before, but her rage toward Levi is palpable.
I am eager to watch her unleash it.

‘He’s injured himself.’ Athena murmurs, halting at a bush smeared with fresh blood. ‘Trying to lead us somewhere.’
‘Trying to survive.’ I reply, nose to the ground. ‘It’s fresh. He’s close.’

Howls echo nearby.
We weave through the trees to find two Wolves standing over a dead female.
She’s shifted back to human form.
A sharpened branch protrudes from her chest.

‘She was one of mine.’ Athena growls.

‘There’s more.’ One Wolf mutters.
They nudge her onto her stomach.
The number two is scrawled on her back in Levi’s blood.

‘Two?’ Athena asks.

‘He’s killed another. Eliminating us one by one to seize control.’ I inform the Wolves and Athena. ‘He’s tallying his kills.’

‘Stay together.’ I add.
Splitting up is dangerous. Anyone alone becomes a potential victim.

Athena and I take a different path.
Soon, another link reports a dead Wolf found.
The number three is marked on this one.

Casualties were expected, but three this quickly is alarming.
His tally enrages me further.
There could be more.
We haven’t even located the first victim.

Deeper in the forest, his tracks diverge.
He attempts to confuse pursuers.
But the scent of his blood is potent here.
He must be close.

Athena watches, alarmed, as I shift back to human form.
I step into a small clearing.
“Levi!” I shout.
No answer, as expected.

“I know you’re near. I smell your blood.” I address the forest. “Your tricks are transparent. You are close.”

“Killing two pack members was bold, Levi. Your turn will come. The pack will collect payment for the lives you took. Perhaps we start with your feet. A few toes first. Then we move to your fingers. Removing them one by one.”

Movement catches my eye.
It’s just the Wolves and Lycans signaling their positions.
They’ve all deduced the same thing.

“Are you frightened, Levi? You cannot escape this.” I wonder if he realizes my border is lined with guards. He can run the length of this forest, but he will never leave.

‘You don’t need to go far.’ Zachary links me.
Levi drops from the trees, landing hard on his back with a groan.
He’s inches away.
Healing bruises mark his chest. This is him, not a projection.

I look up.
Zachary perches on a branch in Lycan form.
He gives me a casual wave.

Levi lies on the ground, then begins laughing. “You still don’t understand, do you?” he muses.

“What is there to understand?” I step on his ankle.
He tries to kick me with his other leg. “You murdered three pack members.”

“They intended to kill me. Your rules never forbade killing. You should be clearer, Alpha Alexander.”

I apply my full weight to his ankle.
He grimaces in pain.

“Perhaps you’re right. Perhaps I should have been clearer.” I mock, removing my foot.
I signal everyone forward.
Panic flashes in his eyes as he realizes escape is impossible.

“I was saving them!” he shouts as several Wolves seize his limbs and begin pulling.

‘Pull until the joints separate.’ I intend to savor every second of this.
###Chapter 0479

Cooper fought them with everything he had.

I heard the sickening pop of his knee joints giving way.

Then his hips followed with another crunch.

His scream echoed as his shoulders were violently dislocated.

The Wolves released him abruptly.

He collapsed onto the ground, moaning in agony.

After a few moments, his injuries began to heal themselves.

"Toes!" I commanded sharply.

Two Lycans immediately stepped forward, replacing the Wolves.

They sank their claws deep into his toes.

Several digits were ripped clean off.

He screamed again, bolting upright to clutch his ankles.

Blood gushed from the stumps on his feet.

Only a couple of toes remained on each foot.

"You had the chance to walk away, Cooper. The moment you discovered Blair was a half-sibling to the Alpha, you should have vanished. You should have gone home and never returned."

"You'll pay for this!" he yelled at me, his voice raw.

"Who exactly do you think will believe you? Look around. Do you honestly believe there's any life left for you after this? There's only one way this hunt ends."

He glared with pure hatred.

"Saving people, or whatever you call this, is worse than cruelty. You claim to do the Moon Goddess's work. Then tell me, why would she want this done to her own creations?"

I waited for a response.

None came.

"Just as I thought. You use it as an excuse. Everything you say is an excuse in some form. You hate lies, yet your entire existence is built on one. Do you even know your own truth?"

"Cunt!" he spat at me.

The others growled menacingly.

From the corner of my eye, I saw Brax arrive with an axe.

"Take off his foot," I instructed him.

"Happily." Brax stepped forward, taking my position.

He dropped a backpack onto the ground.

"Hold him!" he ordered a couple of others.

Two Lycans pinned Cooper down firmly.

Brax grinned at him. "This will hurt. I made sure the blade was blunt just for this occasion. This is for Madison."

He swung the axe down hard, just above Cooper's right ankle.

The axe barely cut through to the bone.

Cooper released a blood-curdling scream.

It took five brutal swings to completely remove the foot.

Brax bent down and picked up the severed foot.

He turned to face me and Neah with a smile.

Splatters of blood covered his face and body.

He may not have delivered the final blow, but he seemed satisfied.

Cooper passed out from the pain, shock, or blood loss.

I didn't care.

I would wait for him to wake up.

The torture would continue.

Brax casually pulled a pair of shorts from the backpack.

He handed them to me. "We don't all need to see what you're packing."

I rolled my eyes but took them.

Cooper began to stir.

Moving over to my mate, I smiled at her. "Your turn."

She stepped forward and grabbed him by the leg without the foot.

Dragging him across the ground, Neah yanked him up until he dangled upside down.

She inspected the wound carefully.

Very slowly, she slid a single claw beneath the surface of the skin.

Cooper's screams filled the forest.

It only energized everyone present.

Everyone here wanted a piece of him.

Neah's claw circled the entire leg, slicing deep as if using a knife.

She began to peel the flesh back from the muscle.

She rolled it down like a sleeve.

Pausing occasionally to slice off any attachments.

"STOP! PLEASE STOP!" he screamed out.

"I bet that's what they all said to you, wasn't it?" I asked as Neah continued.

"Just kill me," he begged.

"There's plenty of time for that. You've still got all your fingers."

He vomited as Neah reached the kneecap.

She stopped and dropped him.

His skin remained rolled up around his knee, muscle exposed.

He vomited again upon seeing his leg.

"You live by the motto that there's always someone worse. Well, you found us. You should be careful. You never truly know people."

Neah stood over him and ripped his tee open.

Her claws sliced down his chest.

With one swift movement, she ripped the skin back, exposing everything beneath.

Cooper couldn't speak even if he tried.

His eyes rolled back, and he passed out again.

'They can rip him apart now,' Neah linked me.

I waved everyone forward as Neah stepped back beside me.

Teeth and claws sank into his flesh as everyone fought for a piece.

Within seconds, his arms and legs were torn from his torso.

Cooper's eyes opened for a brief second.

He let out a gargled scream.

A very large Lycan ripped his head from his torso.

It took me a moment to realize it was Samara.

Pieces of flesh scattered the clearing.

Everyone and everything was drenched in his blood.

The group parted for Neah.

She moved to the remains of his torso.

She plunged her claws into his chest and pulled out the heart.

Holding it in her hand, she stared at it for a while.

Then she closed her fingers around it and squeezed until it exploded.
###Chapter 0480
Athena

Pure satisfaction coursed through me.

I rolled the remains of his heart in my palm. Crimson blood dripped slowly from my fingers. No one could survive that. Not even him.

My gaze shifted to Evelyn. She remained in Lycan form, seated on the ground beside the severed head. The first kill always overwhelms. Something primal takes over and just happens. For her, Dakota might have taken the lead.

Behind her, hiding behind a tree, was Seraphina. The moment she realized I saw her, she turned and fled through the forest. At least she headed back toward the pack grounds.

Zachary dropped from a tree, landing feet from me. He grabbed my wrist and turned it over. The crumpled heart fell to the ground.

'Go.' His voice echoed in my mind. 'I'll handle the remains.'

Nyx murmured agreement. There was nothing left for us here.

I turned to find Alexander waiting. His crimson eyes locked onto mine, and he smiled. He always enjoyed watching me unleash destruction.

"Something in there for Athena." Luc called out. He pointed to the backpack near Alexander. Alexander snatched it and pulled out a shirt for me.

As I shifted back, Alexander wrapped the soft fabric around me. He guided my arms through the sleeves. He slowly fastened the buttons from top to bottom. "We need to get you cleaned up." He murmured softly.

"Seraphina was here." My words came out barely a whisper. My mind buzzed with tension.

"I expect she wanted to watch." He kept his eyes on mine as he fastened the final button. "Wouldn't you, if someone nearly destroyed your life?"

He took my hand and led me through the forest. "The people he killed?" I muttered, glancing back. "We can't just leave them."

"They will be handled with respect." Alexander said, holding a branch aside for me. "They risked everything. Their sacrifice fueled the others' rage. They were eager to tear him apart for his crimes. They'd do it again without hesitation."

We reached the forest edge. I saw Seraphina talking to Hannah. Sitting meters away was the newcomer, Jasmine.

"Did Hannah regain her abilities? Seraphina did, and so did Jasmine."

Alexander nodded. "She can scent Luc again. Her healing and hearing improved. But like before, she still can't shift. That wasn't Cooper's doing. It's something else entirely." He stopped me from moving further. "Are you going to explain the new woman?"

I felt surprised she remained. She could have fled when we left. Probably stayed because of Zachary. "She's Zachary's mate."

His brows furrowed. "His mate?"

I nodded.

"Already? I didn't expect it so soon."

I shrugged. I didn't understand how it worked. I was still mated to Marcus when Alexander entered my life. That seemed impossible too.

"And Cooper kept her locked in that house." I muttered. There hadn't been time for full explanations. Once I realized snapping his neck failed, I linked Alexander to organize the hunt.

"Why?"

"I don't know all details, but Theodore said she was fine. Cooper was the priority."

We approached her, and she jumped to her feet. She bowed her head to Alexander and extended her hand. "I'm Jasmine. Thank you for allowing me here. Do you know where Zachary is?"

"He's handling cleanup. He'll return shortly."

Her eyes widened, and she dropped her hand. She stared at Alexander. "Oh shit!" She stepped back. "This is a trap for me, isn't it?"

"A trap?" Alexander mused. "If you hadn't noticed, we were busy hunting the bastard who held you captive."

Jasmine's eyes scanned me, taking in the blood from head to toe. "He's really dead?"

"Yes."

Her eyes returned to Alexander. "Have you told him I'm here?"

"Told who?" He asked.

She glanced around nervously. "I only came because Theodore said it was safe. He lied to me."

"About what?" I asked, confused.

"Is he coming?" She pressed, stepping back further.

"I don't know who you mean."

"The man I'm running from. Alpha Julian."

"Who?" Alexander demanded.

Jasmine's eyes widened. She stared without blinking. "Alpha Julian. Please don't. I had to do it. I can't be part of that! Don't make me go back. I'll do anything. Give me time. I can take care of myself. You don't need to tell him I'm here. I can leave."
###Chapter 0481

"Why would we tell him?" I ask.

Alexander's fingers tighten around my wrist. "We need to talk." He pulls me away urgently, not stopping until we reach Brianna and Sebastian's home.

"Sit down." He commands the moment we enter.

"Alexander, what's happening?"

"There's something I must tell you. I've been struggling with how to say this for a long time. Now it seems I have no choice."

"You're trying to tell me you had a twin."

"You kn... Theodore told you." His expression darkens.

I shrug and nod. "I don't understand why you kept this from me, especially when I was pregnant with the boys. It would have been helpful to know multiples run in the family. To prepare me for whatever might be growing here." I pat my stomach, suddenly aware of my hunger. I hadn't eaten in nearly twelve hours.

"It's more complicated than that. Did he tell you what happened to them?"

"Stillborn." The words catch in my throat. Every mother's worst nightmare.

He shakes his head slowly.

"They weren't?"

"No. That's the story I was told. But it wasn't the truth. This isn't new information either. The reason Jasmine is panicking is because Silas is my twin. Judging by her reaction, we must look identical."

"I'm dreaming, right?" I whisper to Nyx.

'No.' Nyx responds quietly. 'This is very real.'

My eyes lock with Alexander's. "Are you saying you have a twin brother out there that none of us knew about?" He lowers his head in confirmation.

I open my mouth to speak, but only air escapes. Should I be angry? Probably. But mostly I feel disbelief that he never told me.

Pushing up from the sofa, I move toward the kitchen. I needed food, no matter how many questions Nyx was throwing at me.

Alexander follows closely. "I'm sure you have questions."

I pause to stare at him before continuing my search for food. I had more than questions.

His crimson eyes track my movements as I prepare a sandwich. I take one bite before setting it down. "What the actual fuck?!"

"With everything happening, there never seemed a right time to tell you. What I know is that Silas was given to another family member at birth. They couldn't have children, and my father only wanted one heir. That changed when he met his mate, my stepmother. Then Isabella and Julian came along."

"He just gave him away? Just like that?"

"I don't think it was that simple, but neither of them are here to explain. Silas was raised overseas."

"You've never met him."

"No. And I never wanted to."

"If Jasmine hadn't reacted that way, would you have told me?"

"Yes."

"Because I kept mentioning I might be carrying more than one?"

He nods. "The first time could have been coincidence. But if you're having twins again, you deserved to know."

"You're absolutely right about that!" I exhale sharply.

Maybe I hadn't used all my anger on killing Levi. Or perhaps I simply couldn't stay angry with Alexander these days.

"I don't know why he's here or where he is. I'll have to speak with Jasmine." He mutters.

"No one else knows the truth about him?"

"I told Sebastian. That's all. Everyone else who was around when I was born was told the same story. That I was the only survivor. This could destroy my status, Athena."

I shake my head. "It won't. The Wolves trust you. Because of that trust, they accepted me and the other Lycans. Most of them did. You won't lose them over some family secret." I take my sandwich and sit at the small table, still stained with Levi's blood.

"I understand if you're angry." He says quietly.

"I'm not angry." I take another bite. "Confused, definitely. But not angry. Maybe I'm still riding the high from killing Levi." I smile faintly. "I have a half-sibling and a cousin I never knew existed. It's only fair you have family complications too."

He knocks the table over, sending my sandwich and plate flying across the room. His hands settle on my hips, lifting me from the chair as he presses his lips against mine. "Do you have any idea how much I love you?"
###Chapter 0482
Zachary

We collected every last piece.
We built a pyre from what remained of Levi, adding dry kindling to fuel the flames.
Evelyn placed his head atop the pile.
Luc eagerly threw a match onto it.

The fire took a moment to catch.
Then it erupted, engulfing everything in vibrant shades of orange.
The scent was overpowering, thick enough to taste.
A sickly sweet odor that churned the stomach.
No matter how many times you smell it, you never get accustomed to it.

The others stood with me, watching the flames.
Silently savoring the victory.
We had finally stopped this man before he could cause more destruction.

One by one, they departed.
But Evelyn stayed.
Her grey eyes remained fixed on the fire.
I wondered what thoughts occupied her mind.
This was her first kill, as far as I knew.
Yet he had been her brother.
She said he raised her.

"Evelyn?"

She turned her head toward me.
Confusion flickered in her eyes at hearing me speak in Lycan form.

"Are you alright?"

She nodded slowly.

"I doubt Athena will send you back to the dungeon." I offered.

She lowered herself to the ground, drawing her long legs to her chest.
She began shifting back to human form.
Her face contorted with pain, but she didn't scream like she had in the dungeon.

"It feels strange." she murmured after completing the shift.
"He was my brother. But I had to help. He caused so much pain and suffering."

"I almost killed my brother once." I kept my gaze on the flames, giving her privacy.

"You didn't go through with it?" I felt her eyes on me.

"I was going to. Seraphina got to him first."

"Gabriel was your brother?" Surprise colored her tone.

"She told you about him?"

"Bits and pieces. I clearly don't know everything." She sighed deeply.
"I feel like I should mourn Levi. But mostly, I feel guilty."

"For his death?"

"For his actions. Maybe if I had tried harder, I could have stopped him long ago.
If I had stood up to him... If I had sought help earlier..."

"Hindsight is always clear. You couldn't have known it would come to this."

"I know my father would be rolling in his grave." She paused.
"I thought I would feel pain too. He was family, and our bond has been severed."

"It depends on how close you were. Your bond wasn't a true family connection.
He controlled you, Evelyn, just like Athena said. He preyed on you."
I groaned softly. "It's ridiculous. Every species has bastards like him."

I sat beside her as the flames began to die.
Embers glowed in the ash among shattered bones.
Droplets of rain started falling, diluting the smell of burnt flesh.

Suddenly, she leaned her head against my shoulder without speaking, still hugging her legs.

"Ready to head back?" I asked.

"Why?" she responded quietly.
"You said Athena probably won't imprison me. There's nowhere else for me to go. Not anymore."

"You can stay in the house I'm using. Until we figure things out."

"What about Jasmine?"

"I haven't figured that out yet." I told her honestly.
"I'm not ready for another mate. Not yet."

"What was Isabella like?"

"Different. Gorgeous. Cared about others more than herself.
That's why she loved working at the hospital.
We argued over stupid things, but I always knew we were good together.
She had an insane love for ice cream.
Thought I didn't know about her secret stash of sweets in our bedroom."
I didn't know why I was telling Evelyn, but it felt easier talking to someone who didn't know Isabella.

"She was close to Athena, but something changed.
I'm still not clear on what. Until I am, I can't accept a new mate."

"You should tell Jasmine that. It's not fair to let her hope.
If I met my mate and he wasn't ready, I'd want to know.
I'd want someone who desires me and only me.
Someone who accepts me for who I am.
Not someone trying to figure out past mistakes."

"Wise words." I mused.

I felt her shrug. "I read a lot on my little farm.
Take it with a grain of salt—I've never been mated."

"We should go." I muttered.

"The question now is how I get out of the forest naked without anyone seeing me."
###Chapter 0483

"Get on my back." I offer.

She stares at me, bewildered. "Excuse me?"

"Climb onto my back. The house isn't far from the forest edge. If anyone sees us, they'll only see your back."

"You're completely insane."

"Either that, or you walk out of here completely exposed. Your choice."

"Why does everyone around here seem to enjoy nudity so much?" she scoffs, but she shuffles behind me anyway.

Her arms wrap around my neck.

She hooks her legs around my torso, pressing herself against me.

I can feel the curve of her breasts against my back.

"It comes with being a Lycan. Especially when you can shift." I stand up, adjusting her weight.

I stamp out the remaining embers of the fire.

I make sure Cooper's bones are completely crushed into fragments. Just as a precaution.

Samara holds on tightly as we move through the forest.

After a moment, she finally asks the question. "How are you able to speak in your Lycan form?"

"It's a long story."

"I can't do that." she mutters. "Is it something I need to learn now that I have my Lycan?"

"No. Consider yourself lucky. It's not a good thing to be able to."

We break through the tree line near Mallory's old house.

The place had been repaired for a while.

Since the packhouse was destroyed in that massive explosion, this is where I've been staying.

I open the back door and turn, letting Samara slide off my back.

"I have some clothes upstairs. You should find something that fits."

"Thanks, Damien."

I wait until I hear her footsteps fade toward the stairs.

I grab a pair of joggers drying on a nearby chair.

Shifting back, I quickly pull them on.

I settle on the doorstep just as I catch a familiar scent. Floral. Eris.

She's heading straight for me, and fast.

Her arms swing angrily as she marches closer.

Her golden eyes lock onto mine, burning with fury.

"They won't let me leave... Why do you smell like another woman?" Her tone is sharp, laced with anger.

"I was helping someone."

Her eyes narrow into slits. "You reek of her." she snaps, cutting me off before I can explain.

"I told you, I was helping her. And right now, I don't appreciate your attitude."

She shakes her head, folding her arms tightly across her chest.

"This place is completely messed up. They're holding me here. That Klaus brought me here as a trap. The Wolf Alpha is a complete madman. Someone should have warned me about his eyes. I never would have come. And my mate is... what's the word... a Lycan stuck in the past. I should have taken my chances out there."

"Klaus didn't trap you." I keep my voice calm, though her assumptions irritate me.

"Why are you defending him?" She stares at me, incredulous.

"He offered you safety. Klaus is the most easygoing Wolf I've ever met. He means every word he says."

"Some safety. Is Alpha Dane going to call Alpha Silas?"

"Alpha Silas?"

"The man I'm running from. They're related, right? They look identical."

"Clearly, I've missed something. I have no idea what you're talking about."

"Alpha Silas!" She says his name slowly, as if I'm stupid.

"You mentioned Neah being worse than him. That was it."

"Crap." Her cheeks flush red. "It wasn't you I spoke to before. My mistake." She takes a deep breath, ready to explain.

"Damien." Samara's voice comes from behind me. "I found something that fits. The shirt is a bit big, but I tied a knot. Hi, Eris."

"You!" Eris growls. "You knew he's my mate, and now you're here, parading around in his clothes. You bitch!"

She tries to charge past me, jealousy radiating off her.

Her hand slices across my cheek when she can't get through.

"I'm right here, and you choose to sleep with her?" she screeches at me.

I push her back, and she falls hard on her ass. "I told you, I was helping her. What part of that don't you understand?" I stare at her, disbelief washing over me. Her attitude is disgusting. Is this my punishment for nearly killing my own mate?

She jumps to her feet. "I came looking for you for help. I didn't expect to find you with another woman. Is this what you Lycans are like? You don't care about your mates? You just sleep with anyone?"

"Smell the air. Does it smell like we had sex?"

She glares at me for a moment, then reluctantly sniffs the air.

"And even if we had, do you really think you'd still be standing there?"

She frowns. "Then why is she wearing your clothes?"

"I told you. I was helping her. If you hadn't stormed in here with that attitude, I might be helping you too."

"Do you like her?" she demands.

"Right now, I like her a hell of a lot more than I like you."
###Chapter 0484
Zachary

"You can't speak to me that way!" Jasmine shrieks at me, her voice grating on my nerves. I was completely fed up with her theatrics. She hadn't allowed me a single moment to explain myself. It was obvious she only cared about her own feelings.

"What exactly do you want from me?" I demand.

Her eyes widen in apparent shock at my direct question. "We're mates! You could try acting like it," she snaps back.

"I've already told you I need time to process everything. What part of that isn't clear?" My irritation bleeds into every word.

"I expected you to have enough respect to avoid other women!"

I let out a harsh laugh. "You're letting jealousy consume you. Look around—this pack has countless Wolves and Lycans. Will you cause a scene every time I speak to another female? What if I'm helping Evelyn or my closest friend? Will you call them bitches too?"

"Your best friend is a woman?" she scoffs.

"Absolutely." I hold her gaze without flinching. "And I'm curious how you'll react when you learn I have a child."

Her jaw drops, confusion replacing her anger. "From your first mate?"

"No." I consider explaining further, but her temper is already flaring. She'd gone from zero to furious just smelling Evelyn on me.

She frowns and takes a step back, raising her hands defensively. "I can't... I can't handle this."

"That's what happens when you jump to conclusions. You know nothing about me, yet you've already decided how I should behave."

"I..." Her golden eyes dart around nervously.

"Daddy!" Charlotte comes sprinting across the lawn toward me, her backpack bouncing with each step. Sebastian waves to confirm I've seen them.

Charlotte launches herself into my arms, wrapping herself around me tightly. She'd been staying with Athena and Sebastian for several days, and seeing her again filled me with relief.

"Jasmine, this is Charlotte."

"Your daughter?" she stammers.

"Yes."

Charlotte holds up two fingers proudly. "Two dads!" she announces. Though she spends significantly more time with me than Luc.

Jasmine attempts a smile at Charlotte, but my daughter doesn't return it. Instead, she stares intently at Jasmine, and I know she's reading her energy.

"Why is she staring at me like that?" Jasmine demands.

The skin between Charlotte's eyebrows wrinkles in concern. "I want to go inside," she murmurs.

"There's someone inside."

"Okay." Charlotte smiles slightly. "She won't hurt me! Promise."

I set her down, surprised she's more wary of the Wolf before us than the Lycan inside. She gives Jasmine one final look before slipping past me.

"What was that about?" Jasmine asks.

"She's an excellent judge of character."

"She doesn't like me, does she? She barely spoke to me! You're going to trust a child's judgment?"

"Don't like when the tables are turned?" I challenge.

"That's not what I meant."

"Isn't it? You've done the same to me. The difference is, my daughter can see your soul. There's no hiding from that—that's why she didn't need to speak to you."

I turn toward the house, done with this conversation.

"You're just walking away?" Jasmine asks.

I glance over my shoulder. "Yes. Or would you prefer I reject you right now? Because that's becoming increasingly likely."

"I thought you wanted time to think?"

"I did. But you're making it impossible to consider any positive aspects of being mated to you."

"..." She avoids my gaze, her eyes settling on the ground at my feet.

She walks away as I enter the house. An ache forms in my chest. She was supposed to be mine, yet I can't imagine building a life with someone like her.

Walking through the kitchen to the lounge, I find Charlotte already on her stomach, doodling on paper. Evelyn sits on the sofa wearing one of my black tees knotted at her hip and a pair of my shorts. The drawstring is pulled so tight it hangs past the shorts' hem.

"I'm sorry," Evelyn murmurs as I take a seat. "I didn't mean to cause trouble. I can find another place to stay."

"This was entirely her doing. You have nothing to apologize for." She studies me with her grey eyes and nods. "Charlotte, what did you see when you looked at Jasmine?"
###Chapter 0485

She stopped drawing and slowly put her pencil down.

She got up from the floor and walked toward me, her eyebrows furrowed.

"The lady outside?" she asked casually.

"Yes. I noticed how you looked at her. I know you were reading her."

"She's unhappy. She used to be happy long ago, but something changed. It's not dark, but it's not light either." Lottie touched her chest gently. "She's hurting, but she doesn't want anyone to know."

"Why did you run inside?"

"Um, she um," Her gaze drifted toward Evelyn. "She is your mate, but she doesn't like that you have friends. Or me."

"Lottie..."

"She's going to take you away from me." Tears streamed down her face as she spoke.

I tried to reassure her that no one was taking me away, but she ran to her bedroom crying.

"Do you want me to go talk to her?" Evelyn offered.

"No. Thank you, but it's me she's worried about."

"I don't understand. How can she read people like that?"

"She's a Hunter. Biologically, she's Luc's daughter."

Evelyn frowned. "That's the child Seraphina told me about."

"Yes."

"You have a Hunter in your house and you're not worried? Should I be concerned?" Her eyebrows rose sharply.

"She isn't exactly like Luc."

"Why does she call you Daddy if she's Luc's child?"

"It's a long story."

"I'm happy to listen," she said. "It's better than listening to my own narrator."

"Dakota?"

"Yes. She talks a lot. I don't mind it. It's different. Sometimes it's weird that she knows exactly what I'm thinking, but it's reassuring too. Does that make sense?"

"Athena told me the same thing."

"But we don't all have the inner Lycan?"

"No, it's related to carrying Alpha genetics. Ultimately, you carry Harrison blood."

"Still a lot to understand," she murmured. "But tell me about Charlotte. I'd love to know more."

She listened carefully as I explained how Lottie came into my life. She didn't interrupt, and she smiled when I finished. "You helped her."

"I like to think so."

"Can I ask you a question?" she murmured.

"Sure."

"Do you think Gabriel knew she was there? Do you think he left her there on purpose for you to find? Did he slaughter those people because of what they did to her?"

"Yes. There's no way he didn't know she was there. Rogues have a stronger sense of smell, and Lottie saw him. Whether he chose to leave her there for me to find, or to use her as an opportunity to get further away, is a different question. One I'll never know the answer to." I looked up at the ceiling. "She's far stronger than most people realize."

"I agree, she is."

My eyes locked on hers. "What did she say to you when she was in here alone with you?"

Evelyn smiled. "She told me she could see I was a good person deep down. That I just need to get out of the trap that no longer exists."

"Anything else?"

She shrugged. "Only that she likes me." She pointed to the back of her hand where a blue unicorn sticker was placed. "She gave me a sticker. Told me that Athena would know I was a good person. But I know it'll take more than a sticker for Athena to believe that. I keep expecting her to knock down the door and take me back to the dungeon."

"It's not going to happen. I've already told her you're here with me, and I'm keeping an eye on you."

"You don't have to do that, Zachary. As much as I'm grateful not to be sitting on a concrete floor, you don't have to be nice to me." She settled back into the sofa, letting out a soft sigh as she enjoyed the comfort.

"You're right. I don't have to do anything. I'm choosing to let you stay here."

She looked at me with wide grey eyes. "Thank you," she whispered. "You should talk to Jasmine, though."

"I will if she's willing to listen. But she seems stuck on her way and her way only. Maybe she got away with that in whatever pack she came from, but that doesn't work with me."

"Crestwood City."

"Hmm?"

"Crestwood City is the pack she came from. An Alpha moved in and took over, killed the old Alpha."

"Who is it?"

"She's already mentioned him. Alpha Julian."
###Chapter 0486
Athena

Dane’s voice was gentle as he peeked into the bathroom. "Are you absolutely sure there’s nothing I can bring you?"

I shot him a sharp glare. My stomach twisted violently. He withdrew without another word. It was ironic. I could witness a foot being severed. I could help skin a man alive and tear out a heart without flinching. Yet the scent of roasted chicken made me vomit the little food I’d managed to keep down.

Alexander, you're the Alpha, but you have no idea. Let me handle this." Brianna’s voice was firm outside the door.

Just tell her I need to speak with Zachary." He replied. The door opened slightly. Brianna slipped inside.

Damn, you look awful." She observed.

Sweat coated my skin. Cooper’s blood still stained my clothes. Alexander had carried me from the chair. Then Brianna entered with a freshly cooked chicken. That’s when I fled to the bathroom. I’d been clinging to the toilet ever since. My throat burned. My stomach ached. But the hunger was relentless.

I remembered these helped before." She offered a pack of ginger biscuits. Not sure if they’ll work now, but it’s worth a shot."

I took one. I nibbled carefully. It seemed to settle my stomach. For now. This is so much worse than last time." I mumbled. She sat beside me on the floor.

It’ll get better. I’m sure."

I’m sorry. This is the last thing you need to deal with."

Don’t be ridiculous. I have Luca now. But maybe it’s time you got checked out. Just to be sure everything’s okay."

It’s too early to see anything. Isabella told me that the first time."

But didn’t she find something then?"

Fine. Let me shower first."

I’ll be right outside if you need me." She stood. She offered her hand.

The door closed. I turned on the shower. I stripped off the bloody shirt. Hot water hit my skin. It felt refreshing. I watched red streaks swirl down the drain. The last traces of that bastard disappeared. 'Athena, something’s wrong.' Nyx murmured. My heart pounded against my ribs.

With the baby?" I didn’t want bed rest again. Not this early.

No. Us. Call for Brianna.

I turned off the water. My hands shook. I struggled to wrap a towel around myself. Brianna." Black spots danced before my eyes. I reached for the wall. It was farther than I thought. I started to collapse.

Hey! I’ve got you!" She caught my head before it hit the floor. My heart hammered in my ears. I heard her call for Sebastian. Then everything went black.

Steady beeps made me wince. I knew that sound well. I was in the pack hospital.

My fingers twitched. Alexander’s hand tightened around mine. I didn’t need to see to know it was him. Light sparks tingled my skin. His thumb drew soft circles on my knuckles.

Athena?" he whispered. I struggled to open my eyes. The lights were too bright. I shut them quickly. Athena, you’re okay."

What happened?" I murmured, squinting at him.

'You didn’t eat.' Nyx murmured.

Your blood sugar was dangerously low. You passed out."

That’s what happens when you don’t let me eat." I gave a weak smile. It happened often when Dominic and the others starved me. Why didn’t I just heal?"

Because even Wolves and Lycans suffer from it. Why do you think we’re always eating? Especially after shifting. Plus, with the baby, you need more nutrients.

Baby," I mumbled. Until confirmed otherwise, it was just one. And how am I supposed to eat if I keep throwing up?"

Babies, and Theodore suggested those milkshakes you like. If it gets food into you. For now, you have that." He pointed to the bag connected to my arm. Liquid dripped into my veins.

I propped myself on my elbows. I winced as the tube shifted. He scanned me, didn’t he?"

Yes."

One?"

He shook his head with a smile.

Twins?" Please, no more than two.

Yes." He leaned forward. His lips brushed my cheek. Told you."

I thought it was too early."
###Chapter 0487

He gives a firm shake of his head. “There’s more.”

“Don’t you dare say bed rest.”

“Theodore insists you take it easy. At least until you’re consistently stable.”

I feel Nyx’s irritation flare. She despises confinement as much as I do. “Does he remember we have two toddlers? One of whom shifts regularly and escapes his crib.”

“I believe he means no shifting. It drains too much energy.”

“Fine. I can manage that. Did you speak with Zachary about the other matter?”

“No. I had just reached his office when Sebastian mind-linked me. He said you collapsed.”

“I believe I heard my name.” Zachary raps his knuckles on the doorframe. His dark gaze locks onto me. “You alright?”

“I’m perfectly fine. It’s everyone else being dramatic.” He lifts a brow, smirking, but stays silent.

“Close the door, would you?” Alexander tells him. “We need to discuss something.”

Zachary slowly pushes the door shut. “Is this about Jasmine? Because that girl is completely unhinged.”

“Did you reject her?” I ask.

“No. She launched into an attack out of nowhere. Then Lottie was dropped off. I didn’t get the chance.”

“Where is Charlotte now?”

“Evelyn is watching her.”

“You left her with Evelyn?” Alexander sounds surprised.

“Lottie likes her. Evelyn isn’t so bad once you know her. She’s trying to figure things out. Before Seraphina, it seems she was mostly alone. Well, partly with Levi, but we know he kept secrets.”

“Lucas will lose his mind.” Alexander smirks.

“I don’t particularly care what he thinks,” Zachary mutters. “So, did you need to talk about Jasmine?”

“You heard her mention Alpha Julian?” Alexander asks.

“Yes.” He rolls his eyes. “She threw a fit. Ranted about your eyes, Theodore, and some trap. Honestly, she was just screaming about everything. But one thing she said was right—she never should have come here.” He shakes his head, looking disgusted. I doubt she can change his opinion.

“So who is Alpha Julian?” he asks.

“If it’s the same Julian… he’s my twin.”

Zachary’s eyes dart to me, then back to Alexander. “The stillborn twin?”

“Yes.”

He takes the empty chair by the door. Alexander explains everything, just as he told me.

“Are we certain it’s the same man?”

“Your mate panicked when she saw Alexander’s eyes. She kept calling it a trap. Said Theodore brought her here. She claimed she never would have come if she knew his eyes were red,” I tell him.

“Please, don’t call her that. I had a mate. Jasmine is not her.” He shakes his head firmly.

“Is she running from him?” Alexander asks.

“Not entirely sure. Evelyn told me she found Jasmine tied up. Jasmine said this Alpha Julian took over her pack. Killed the Alpha, renamed it, moved his own wolves in. Maybe he had issues with Alpha Ryan? Who knows. What I do know is she’s…” He holds his hands up as if wanting to strangle her.

“Irritating?” I suggest.

“Beyond irritating. I’ve never met anyone more annoying. And that includes Lucas. That says a lot.”

I stifle a laugh. Jasmine had gotten under his skin. It takes a lot to irritate Zachary. “Back to this Julian. Do you want to do anything?” Zachary asks Alexander. “Does he know who you are?”

“I don’t know.”

“Can you sense him?” I know my boys sense each other. I knew Isabella and Julian could. He shakes his head at me. “I don’t know if it’s because we were separated at birth. He could be a threat. Or Jasmine could be exaggerating everything. He might not know me. He might want nothing to do with me. Or he might be forced to come here because we have Jasmine.”

“Where is she?” I ask. “I’ll talk to her.”

“She stormed off after I told her I found zero positives in being mated to her,” Zachary mutters.

“She wouldn’t have gotten far. Everyone is watching her.”
###Chapter 0488
Luc

"Hey, you!"

A woman with jet-black hair sprinted toward me. I halted, releasing a heavy sigh. I was supposed to be having dinner with Hannah right now.

"Yes?" She was that stray who returned with the others. A walking bundle of lies.

"Can you help me?"

"Depends." I muttered.

"On what?" She raised an eyebrow.

"What do you want?"

"Can you help me get out of here?" She pleaded.

"Yes."

She stared at me blankly. "Will you help me get out of here?"

"No."

My refusal clearly shocked her. "Why?"

"Athena has questions. I believe Alexander does too."

"So I'm not allowed to leave?" She scoffed, narrowing her golden eyes. I remained silent. The answer was obvious.

"This place is insane." She muttered.

"Not as insane as you running from your problems." I smiled. She glared back.

"Have you spoken to Theodore or that bitch at my mate's house?"

"No."

"Then how did you know... Do you see things like that kid?"

"I assume you mean Charlotte. Charlotte is my daughter."

She stepped back, eyes locked on me. "Two Dads. You're the other Dad."

"That's what she prefers, yes. I take it you don't like him having someone call him Daddy? I somewhat agree, but my daughter is happy. She's with him now?"

"When I left, yes. That bitch was there too."

"Calling someone a bitch doesn't tell me who you mean." I muttered.

"Evelyn."

"Excuse me?"

She shook her head, lowering her gaze. Completely unaware of my rising anger.

"I went to talk with him and Evelyn was already there." Her face twisted. "Parading around in his clothes. I could smell her scent on him, but he denies it. He's supposed to be my mate. Mine!"

"First, if he slept with her after knowing you're his mate, you'd probably be dead. Second, the clothes could be because she was a prisoner with nothing else, and she did help kill her brother. Third, Zachary isn't like that."

"Like what?"

"Not someone who jumps into bed with everyone. And I can see you've already taken the time to get to know him." I said sarcastically.

I stretched. Her eyes caught the gun in my belt. "Why do you have that?"

"Just in case I need to put someone down. Or maybe," I moved swiftly, pulling it out and pressing it against her temple, "I use it as a warning to liars."

She froze. "What are you doing?" Her eyes shifted sideways, focusing on the gun. "Please don't kill me."

"Why are you running from your pack?"

"It's dangerous."

"Bullshit."

"I swear."

"What story did you tell Theodore?"

"The truth."

"You lie."

I watched the lump form in her throat. Everyone I've held a gun to did that except Hannah. She was ready to die.

"It's the truth." The woman spluttered.

"No, it's not. It's a story you cooked up. One you think will tug at heartstrings. You sucked Theodore in. I see it. You're full of lies, weaving your own web of shit. What did you tell him? Must have been good to make him pity you."

"I swear."

"You keep saying that, but you're not actually telling me what you said to him."

"Daddy?" I turned. Charlotte stood there, holding Evelyn's hand. Evelyn's grey eyes darted between me, Jasmine, and the gun.

"I can tell you what Jasmine told us." Evelyn said.

"Bitch, you better keep your mouth shut." Jasmine yelled.

I pushed the gun harder against her temple. "Now now, that's not your choice."

"I don't want anyone else to know."

"Then you shouldn't have told them. Or is it because if others know your lie, it's harder to cover up?" I smiled. "Charlotte, cover your ears. I don't want you to hear this. What did she say, Evelyn? Don't leave out any details."

I listened as Evelyn recounted how this Jasmine allegedly had an abortion because of an Alpha. How he found out and she'd been running from him until she met Levi. Evelyn told me other things. How Jasmine was tied up. How Jasmine said she didn't want to come, but that was before she told the lie. How she was from Crestwood city, but they had recently changed their name.
###Chapter 0489

Typical Theodore, falling for that kind of trick. I couldn't really blame him though. If her story had been true, I would've helped too.

"So Levi just stumbled upon you?" I asked.

"Yes," Jasmine mumbled. "He made me believe we were mates. But I knew it was all lies."

"Where did he find you?"

*Running through dense woods. I had to escape, I had no choice...

"But you knew nothing about Lycans?" Crestwood City residents knew about Lycans. Seraphina had told me that much - it was where they killed Zachary's brother.

"What does that matter?" She frowned.

"Just curious."

She shook her head at me. "Not until he told me. Everyone smells identical. Then he took everything from me. Locked me up, injected me with something."

"No." Evelyn scowled. I glanced at Evelyn who was shaking her head. "No, you said he chanted a spell over you." *He did after the injection."

"But Alexander asked if you'd been drugged and you said no." Evelyn pressed.

"I thought you meant pills or something." Jasmine muttered.

"Evelyn," I hated what I was about to ask, but I needed Charlotte away from what was coming. "Can you take Charlotte back to the house with you?"

I kept the gun pressed to Jasmine's temple as Evelyn led Charlotte away. "You don't have to do this!" Jasmine whispered.

"Normally I wouldn't, but I'm giving you one final chance to tell the truth."

"Luc." Alexander muttered behind me. "Lower the weapon. Athena wants to speak with Jasmine."

"She's lying."

"Maybe so, but Athena still wants to talk to her. And I know you respect Athena's requests."

I slowly lowered the gun in frustration, watching Jasmine breathe a sigh of relief.

"How is Athena?" I asked. I'd watched them rush her across the grounds to the medical center. I thought the twins might have been putting too much strain on her body.

"She's stable. Just needed fluids and nutrition."

"The twins?"

He paused, surprised I'd asked. "They're fine too."

"She's pregnant?" Jasmine muttered.

"Yes. Feeling guilty about lying now?" I asked.

She remained silent.

"Jasmine, come with me." Alexander instructed. I watched her walk toward him. She kept tossing her hair over her shoulder, giving me one final glance as they headed toward the pack hospital.

I should go inside to Hannah, but I needed to check on my daughter's safety first.

Knocking on the door, Evelyn answered. Her body tensed slightly. "She's in there." She pulled the door wider and stepped aside. My eyes caught the unicorn sticker on her hand.

"She likes you?"

"Seems so." She muttered, briefly smiling at the sticker.

"Charlotte?"

"In here Daddy!" She called out.

I entered to find the room transformed with sheets and blankets. Charlotte peeked out. "Do you like my fort? Evie made it for me."

Looking over my shoulder, I saw Evelyn standing back, cautious. "You seem different."

"Not sure you'd believe me even if I explained, but Dakota has helped me understand many things. Still is."

"Or maybe with Levi gone, you're finally free to be who you were meant to be."

I followed her to the kitchen as she offered me a drink. Her soul was healing. Not fully there yet, but getting closer.

"You like Zachary, don't you?" I asked.

"He's been kind to me. Didn't have to let me stay here. Didn't have to lend me his clothes. Didn't have to do anything."

"You know that's not what I meant."

She placed her hands on the counter, tilting her head back. "He's mated to someone else. Nothing I can do about that."

"Sometimes the mate bond isn't for everyone."

"What do you mean?"

"Not every couple is together because of a bond. Obviously it's better that way most of the time. But not always. Some people choose each other because they fall in love."

"Why tell me this? You hate me. I know you came to check if your daughter was safe around me."

"Because I recognize when someone is trying to turn their life around."
###Chapter 0490
Athena

"Just let me go!" I hear Jasmine's voice before I see her.

Zachary rolls his eyes from his seat across my bed.

'Does she ever stop talking?' Nyx grumbles.

'Never.'

"You really can't stand her, can you?" I whisper to Zachary.

"Could you tolerate someone who says ridiculous things every time she opens her mouth?" he snaps. "One moment she's begging to leave, the next she's giving orders."

The door swings open and her eyes immediately lock onto Zachary. "Why are you here?"

"I'm supporting my brother and my Alpha." he states coldly.

"Sit!" Alexander commands.

She shuffles to the empty chair reluctantly.

"I've already told you everything." she says defensively. "What more do you want?"

Alexander leans forward. "Luc seems to believe you're lying."

"Luc?" I ask.

"He was questioning her." Alexander explains. "He made it very clear our guest isn't being truthful."

I study Jasmine as she lowers her gaze. Luc was rarely wrong about detecting lies.

"Why were you speaking with Luc?" I ask.

"I was seeking help." she snaps, glaring at Zachary. "I didn't expect to encounter the other father of your child. Quite a messy situation."

"Remind me why I should accept you as my mate?" Zachary retorts sharply.

Jasmine closes her mouth into a tight pout.

"What about Alpha Julian?" I press.

She straightens immediately.

"You were running from him?"

"Yes." she murmurs.

"Why?"

"I already told Theodore."

"And I'm guessing that was a lie." Alexander states. "Otherwise Luc wouldn't have held a gun to your head."

"You couldn't know that." she scoffs.

"I have eyes everywhere." I reply calmly.

Samara had linked me, but Jasmine didn't need that information.

She slouches back, keeping her head low. "I was running from him." She drums her fingers nervously. "But the story I gave was fabricated. I thought... I'm not sure what I thought. Maybe safety. A chance to find someone who understands. Someone who would help. I didn't expect to find my mate."

"Understand what?" Alexander demands. "Without information, how can we trust or help you?"

"Alpha Julian is dangerous." she whispers.

'She won't look at us directly.' Nyx observes. 'And she shows no fear.'

'She's lying.' I whisper back.

"Is he dangerous," Zachary frowns, "or are you making excuses to cover yourself?"

"When he killed Alpha Ryan, it was shocking. Alpha Ryan had no enemies. Alpha Julian came at night. Slaughtered him in his sleep. It wasn't just a throat slitting. They ripped him open, spread his organs across the bed. I found him."

'Pack takeovers aren't uncommon.' Alexander's voice echoes in my mind. 'But not like this.'

"I sounded the alarm. When Alpha Julian discovered it was me, he promised to make my life hell. I became a slave in my own pack. He forced me to do things." She shivers violently.

"What kind of things?" I ask.

"Do I need to spell it out?" she frowns. "I'm sure you can imagine. I escaped by sheer luck and ran. I ran until I scented Levi. He was watching me and offered safety."

Her words flow too smoothly. None feel authentic. She avoids eye contact with everyone. It's all fabricated, but I want to see how far she'll take this.

"Call Alpha Ryan." I tell Alexander.

"No! Wait! He's dead!" she panics.

"Then Julian will answer, won't he?" I watch her horror-stricken expression. "If Julian answers, we'll know you're partially truthful. If Ryan answers, we'll know you're lying."

"Please don't. He'll know I'm here."

"Who? Ryan or Julian?" Zachary presses.

"Alpha Julian. He controls everything tightly. No one leaves his pack alive. If they try... well, you can imagine."

'That's the second time she's said that.' Nyx notes.

"He keeps everything locked down. He doesn't want anyone knowing he's there. If you call, you'll become his next target." Jasmine warns.
###Chapter 0491

"Is that a threat?" Alexander raises an eyebrow at her.

"I only meant..."

"Can you stop lying?" Zachary mutters under his breath. "Is it even possible? Do you not realize Alexander would be contacting Ryan. No one else."

"Alpha Julian will know it's me. I'm the only one who has ever gotten this far. I'm certain they are still searching."

Zachary shakes his head and stands up. He looks at me and shakes his head again. "I can't do this anymore." He turns to Jasmine, "I, Zachary Gray, Beta of Obsidian Howl, reject you, Jasmine Reed of Dawnmist Pack as my mate." He spits the words out.

"No." She stands firm. If she was hurting, she didn't show it.

"Accept." Zachary demands. Being here felt incredibly uncomfortable. I glanced at Alexander and knew he felt exactly the same.

Tears well in her eyes as she clutches her chest. "I can't."

"Yes you can, say it!"

"I can't."

"Why?" Zachary snaps.

"Because you don't mean it. You're angry with me because I handled things poorly. Don't reject me over that. Give me another chance." She pleads.

I watch him pinch the bridge of his nose. "You don't even want to be here. You keep asking to leave, so accept the rejection and go."

"You're supposed to protect me." She frowns.

"And I'm also supposed to like my mate! Normally I'm willing to give people a chance, but you're impossible."

"I'm impossible? What does that even mean?" She asks with wide eyes.

I quietly watch Alexander typing on his phone. Neither Zachary nor Jasmine notice as he tries to force her to accept the rejection. Seconds pass and the phone beeps.

"Ryan is alive." Alexander confirms. "Crestwood city is still standing strong."

Jasmine's eyes widen like saucers. She had managed to stop Alexander from calling, but that didn't prevent him from sending a message.

Zachary rubs his temples. "Are you some kind of compulsive liar? Do you even know what the word 'truth' means?"

"Why would you keep lying?" I ask.

Her golden eyes shift to Zachary as if expecting him to rescue her, but he only looks more furious. He reminded me of a cartoon Isabella had shown me, where smoke comes out of their ears.

"Do you even know Alpha Julian?" Alexander asks.

She looks at the floor.

"Answer me!" Alexander's voice booms, making her jump.

"Levi told me about him." She whispers.

"Levi? Why would he tell you about him?"

She shrugs. "Alpha Julian is related to you, isn't he?" Jasmine asks. "Levi told me about the eyes. When I saw yours I knew you must be related somehow. It's such an unusual color. He told me many stories about a crimson-eyed man and his pack of animals."

"Did Levi know him?"

She shrugs again.

"And Crestwood city?" I press.

"I don't know, just a name Levi gave me."

"You've never met him?" Alexander asks, confused.

She slowly shakes her head.

"You said you were his prisoner? Evelyn found you tied up." Zachary mutters.

"He kept me safe." She smiles like a madwoman.

'He's dead and still fucking with us.' Nyx tells me what everyone else is likely thinking.

"Where are you really from?" I demand.

"A place called Silver Streams. It's far from here." Her eyes grow even wider. She had slipped up, and Zachary could now reject her.

"I, Zachary Gray, Beta of Obsidian Howl, reject you, Jasmine Reed of Silver Streams as my mate." He states it again, desperate to break their connection.

She felt it this time. I see it in her eyes. Pain, anger, confusion. She clutches her chest differently, as if her heart might leap out. She fights back tears and hunches forward.

"Say it." Zachary demands, and for a moment, I hear Marcus, demanding I accept his rejection.

"Are you going to kill me?" Jasmine begs.

"Accept my rejection!"

Her breathing is heavy as she stares back at him.

"You are a compulsive liar, Jasmine. Not a single word from your mouth can be trusted."

She lowers her eyes and whimpers. "I, Jasmine Reed, accept your rejection, Zachary Gray, Beta of Obsidian Howl." She falls forward from the chair, curling into a ball on the floor as she cries in agony. Zachary stares down at her before leaving the room.

'Should we kill her? Alexander asks through mindlink.

I shake my head. What she's feeling won't go away. Not for a long time. Let her leave.'
###Chapter 0492
Alexander

I raised an eyebrow at my mate. That was not the response I had anticipated. My eyes drifted to Jasmine, who remained curled up and sobbing. She reminded me of Isabella and her state after her rejection. The difference was, I felt sympathy for my sister. I felt absolutely nothing for this woman.

She had been here only a short time and already became a major annoyance.

I pressed my lips to Athena's forehead. I told her I would return shortly.

"Get up." I muttered to Jasmine.

She didn't move, continuing to whimper in pain. She had brought this upon herself. Zachary would never be happy with her.

"Get up!" I snapped, yanking her upright by her elbow.

"Where are you taking me?"

"There's no place for you here. You get to leave, just like you wanted." I stated.

"Really?"

I nodded and guided her through the hospital. We passed Theodore but he remained silent. He had tried his best, but it simply wasn't going to work out. Keeping her here posed too great a risk. She didn't even glance his way.

She shuffled along at an agonizingly slow pace. I had to repeatedly pull her forward.

"Wait, this isn't the way to the gates." she protested. "The gates are over there." She pointed in the opposite direction.

"We are not going to the gates." I directed her into the forest.

"Why?"

"Too many eyes. And Zachary doesn't want to see you." I murmured.

"Okay. You'll need to point me toward the road once we get there. I'm completely turned around."

I nodded. She was indeed already disoriented. "Levi spoke of Julian?" I asked, wondering if I could extract even a sliver of truth from her.

"Yes. At first I thought they were just fabricated stories. But after a while, I realized they had to be true."

"How?"

"Facts. Small details. They never changed."

"Why did you panic when you saw me?" I questioned.

"Because you match the description Levi painted in my mind. You might look like him, you might not. But from the stories, I know he has eyes exactly like yours. Strange and unusual for a Wolf."

"And you could be lying." I muttered as she maneuvered around a tree stump.

"It's hard sometimes."

"What is?"

"Everything." She frowned, ducking under a low-hanging branch.

"Are you just saying that to gain sympathy? Because that won't work on me."

"My mate just rejected me."

"I was there. I saw and heard everything. What does that have to do with everything being hard?"

She stopped abruptly. Her golden eyes locked onto mine. "Because people never see me for who I truly am."

"Understandable, when you lie to everyone."

She scowled at me. "And you've never lied?"

"I didn't say that, did I? Now keep walking."

"He could have had me. I could have been his perfect mate. But no, I'm not good enough."

"No. No, you couldn't have. You're too much of a liability."

"Excuse me?!"

"Zachary was right. It's impossible to distinguish your lies from the truth. You're all over the place. Unpredictable."

"I am not!"

"Then tell me, who are you running from?"

"I told you."

"You did. Then you admitted it was a lie. That you had never met Julian. So who in Silver Streams are you running from?"

"No one."

"Silver Streams isn't a local pack. They're far north. You traveled a long way before encountering Levi."

"Why do you want to know?"

"Just curious. Plus, I need to know who to alert about your death."

She ripped her arm free. "What?"

"I love my mate. Usually, I would agree with her decisions. But lately, things have become too problematic to let you live."

"You can just let me go. I won't say anything. I promise."

"That's the problem, Jasmine. You might be more believable if you had told the truth from the beginning."

"I mean it." She begged, her voice turning shrill. "I really won't say anything. I won't come back. It will be like this never happened."

She took a step backward, holding her hands up. "Athena said I could go. I heard her."

"Yes, she did say that. But did you not notice her surroundings? She was in a hospital, exhausted. Her thinking wasn't clear. Mine is."

With each step I took toward her, she retreated until her back hit a tree.

"Please!"

She froze as a gunshot echoed. Not even a second passed before I saw the small bullet hole in the center of her forehead. A thin trickle of blood ran down between her eyes. The light faded from them before her body slid down the tree trunk.
###Chapter 0493

"How long have you been tailing us?" I demand, his footsteps crunching loudly on the forest floor.

Luc emerges from the shadows behind me. "Long enough."

"I was going to end her."

"And if you had, it might have damaged things between you and Athena."

I whirl around to face him. "Athena understands far more than you ever will. I intended to kill Eris for her. For us. For our family. Letting her escape would have been a grave error."

"We all know that." He moves toward Eris, still slumped against a tree. Gently, he closes her eyelids with his fingers. "But Athena is pregnant. She will need you. This way, you don't have to lie to her. Besides, she already knows I will do whatever is necessary to keep her and the babies safe. That was our agreement, right?"

"I never planned to lie."

"Okay." He mutters, hoisting Eris over his shoulder. "Let me handle this. You go back."

I take my time returning to Athena. I didn't understand why Luc assumed I would lie to my mate. Lying was never my intention; it wasn't part of the understanding between Athena and me. I simply needed to eliminate Eris first. At least now, she was another problem permanently removed from our lives.

'Alexander, come to my place now!' Sebastian links me urgently.

'What's wrong?'

'It's... complicated to explain. Just hurry.'

Sebastian is outside with Luca and Logan when I arrive. "What's going on?"

"Evrin." He gestures toward the house just as a loud crash echoes from inside. "Brianna is trying to manage him."

"He shifted?" I ask as another crash follows, accompanied by Brianna yelling at Evrin to stop.

Sebastian gives a grim nod.

I step inside to a scene of utter chaos. The house looks like a tornado tore through it. Furniture is overturned. Shattered dishes litter the floor. Clothes and food are strewn everywhere.

I hear Brianna upstairs, speaking in a calm tone, trying to soothe my son. It's met with fierce growls and the sound of heavy footsteps pounding above.

Evrin charges down the stairs toward me, launching his Lycan form at my chest. His arms lock around my neck as he buries his nose against me. His breathing is ragged, his heart racing, but as I hold him tightly, I feel his body grow heavy. He slowly begins to shift back.

A exhausted Brianna comes down the stairs, staring at me in disbelief. "Was that really all it took?"

My gaze sweeps over the destroyed house. Evrin couldn't cause much damage in his human form, but as a Lycan, he was devastating.

"Mumma." He whispers tearfully.

"I believe we've discovered the root of this." I look down at my son. He was a perfect miniature of her. But unlike Logan, Evrin seemed to sense when something was wrong with his mother.

"Is Athena alright?" Brianna asks.

"She's resting. She will recover."

"Mumma." Evrin whispers again.

"Let's get you dressed so we can go find her." I smile at him and tell Brianna I will return later to help clean up.

Logan stands up outside, raising his arms, waiting to be picked up. In true sibling fashion, they begin pushing each other, but soon burst into laughter as I carry them like footballs, playfully swinging them through the air.

They giggle all the way to the hospital, eager to get down the moment they see Athena. The boys scramble onto her bed, both vying for her attention as she hugs them tightly. My heart swells with pride.

If anyone had asked me years ago about having children, I would have laughed in their face. Yet here they were. And soon, two would become four.

"Has she gone?" Athena asks once the boys settle.

"You don't need to worry about her anymore." I assure her.

She studies me for a moment. "Did you..."

"I was going to. But Luc got to her first."

Her eyes remain fixed on me as she runs her fingers through Logan's dark hair.

"I understand what you said earlier. But after everything that's happened..."

"She posed too great a risk." She nods slowly.

"We didn't know her true motives. We didn't know if Cooper was using her, if she was playing us. This way, she can never harm us again."

"Okay. What about Silas? Do we need to prepare for him?"

"Perhaps. Perhaps not. But he isn't my priority right now. His story might be fabricated. Cooper may have discovered a few things to use against us. If anything arises, I will handle it."

"I would prefer if nothing happened for a while."
###Chapter 0494
Zachary

*Rejecting Jasmine was the right choice." Brianna sighs, gently rocking Luca in her arms.

I scan her cluttered living space. *And I'm fairly certain she's dead now."

She stops moving. *Care to elaborate?"

*I was heading home to check on Lottie but changed course to come here instead. I witnessed Alexander take her into the woods. Luc followed shortly after. Only Alexander emerged."

*But Luc and Jasmine never did?"

*Exactly."

*Are you feeling guilty? That's not typical for you."

*I'm uncertain about my emotions. Everything I've struggled to suppress has resurfaced. When the hold on Jasmine shattered and I recognized her, all I could think about was Isabella and her fate."

*You know her situation wasn't normal."

*Is anything about us normal?" I raise an eyebrow at her.

*Poor wording," she mutters.

*What I mean is, I don't comprehend how Jasmine could have been my mate. She was a self-righteous, insane witch. And that's putting it mildly."

Brianna laughs at me. *Definitely not your type."

*And Lottie despised her."

*Charlotte has very clear preferences about people. Speaking of her, how is she handling the changes with Liam?"

*Better."

*And Liam? What becomes of him now?"

*With Levi gone, he'll probably be released. He likely won't have independent freedom for a while."

*Just like his sister."

I hadn't considered Seraphina much. She kept quiet and handled her business. *I'm going home."

*Sure you don't want to stay?"

*No, I need to clear my head."

I stand at my front door, listening to Lottie's delighted squeals. For a moment, it reminded me of how Isabella used to make her laugh. Every time I heard that sound before, Isabella was always right there with her.

Lottie appears at the window, her cheeks flushed with what looks like beads in her hair. *Are you coming inside, Daddy?"

*I'll be back shortly. Is that alright?"

*Okay, but hurry! Me and Evelyn have a surprise." I still couldn't believe how much Lottie adored Evelyn when everyone else here seemed to have issues with her.

I take the longer route to the small cemetery. I hadn't stepped foot here since the day we buried Isabella and her twin. I had no words then, and I'm not sure I have any now.

The cemetery remained impeccably maintained. Weeds and fallen leaves had been cleared away, with vibrant flowers lining each grave. I stand at the edge of hers, hands in my pockets, silently wishing she had never given up on life. That she had found a way to tell me she was done.

I still blamed myself. I watched her fade away, and the small efforts I made to prevent it weren't enough. I should have tried harder. I should have made her more of a priority. I should have fought for her more fiercely. *You couldn't have changed anything."

I look up to see Luc. Dirt smudges his face, a shovel resting on his shoulder.

*I thought I might find you here. I did the same when I realized Hannah was my mate. I returned to my first mate's grave."

He sets the shovel down, leaning it against the small gate before walking over to me.

*You wish things had been different. That you could have found a way to save her. Trust me, I understand. I saw it that night, and I felt the same about my wife."

*When my mate and children were taken from me, I went on a mission. I hunted and slaughtered every Rogue I could find while searching for Seraphina and Charlotte. I didn't stop because I didn't want to feel. You distanced yourself because any mention of her brings you right back to this feeling." He points at Isabella's grave.

*Is that why you don't spend time with your daughter?" I snap.
###Chapter 0495

“She’s the spitting image of her.” He speaks softly. “The eyes. The hair. Even those tiny dimples in her cheeks. I should be overjoyed that she resembles her mother so closely.”

“It’s a painful reminder of your loss.” I let out a quiet breath.

“I love her. She is mine. She will always be mine.”

We stand without speaking for several minutes. “Is Eris gone?”

“Yes.”

I nod slowly. “Isabella would have despised her. I still don’t understand why she was chosen as my mate.”

“The fates operate in mysterious patterns. But I have a theory.”

“Do enlighten me.” I mutter, rolling my eyes.

“You were once Human.”

“That’s it? That’s your entire theory?”

“Legend says each of us has an expiration date. A day when we can no longer heal from what life throws at us. Part of that destiny involves finding our mates. But for Wolves and Lycans, those bonds are decided long before we are born.”

“If that’s true, then why are Lycans being paired with Wolves?”

He shrugs lightly. “Like I said. It was predetermined. But your kind disrupted the natural order.”

“Lycans?”

“Bitten Lycans. Perhaps the fates didn’t anticipate that.”

“That makes no sense. If our mates were pre-chosen, they would have accounted for our existence. Otherwise, the bonds wouldn’t form.”

He tilts his head toward the sky. “Or perhaps they’re merely toying with us. Setting challenge after challenge in our path. A brutal game of survival. But in the end, death comes for everyone. That much is certain.”

I raise an eyebrow. “Did you eat something strange in the forest?”

He offers a faint smile. “No. But sometimes what we seek is right in front of us, Zachary.” He moves toward the gravestone and rests his hand on it, glancing back at me. “She was a stepping stone. Leading you to the one you’re truly meant to be with.”

“Are you talking about Eris or Isabella?”

“Perhaps both.” He picks up the shovel and walks away.

Sometimes I’m convinced he’s on something.

I lower myself onto the grass. Staring at her gravestone for a long time. Wondering what she would think of everything that’s happened.

Maybe Luc was right. Maybe she had an expiration date. Never meant to live this long. But I know a part of her will always remain with me.

It’s late when I return. Evelyn is sitting on the sofa. Her hands wrapped around a mug as she drinks deeply. I scan the room. Sheets are draped everywhere, held up by pegs and string.

“Sorry, we built a fort. Charlotte wanted to show you, but she fell asleep.”

“She’s asleep?”

She nods, setting her mug down. “She had a bath. A story. Now she’s sleeping in her bed.”

I glance toward the stairs, frowning. “She didn’t make a sound?” There are very few people she allows to tuck her in. “How long has she been out?”

She checks the clock. “About an hour. When you didn’t come back, I told her you might have been called away on pack business. That she was safe with me.” She pauses, her expression shifting. “Sorry, should I not have—”

“It’s just surprising. That’s all. Excuse me for a moment.”

I move quietly up the stairs. Peek into Lottie’s room. She’s sprawled on her stomach. Her light brown hair is braided. Soft snores fill the quiet air. It’s unusual to see her so relaxed in sleep. Not curled into a tight ball. The teddy bear she received after I rescued her lies on the floor instead of clutched tightly in her arms.

“Is everything alright?” Evelyn asks as I descend the stairs.

“Yes. It’s just been a long day. Lots to process.”

She offers a gentle smile. “Do you want to talk?”

“Not yet.”

“Okay. Do you mind if I get some sleep? Your kid is wonderful, but I’m exhausted. It’s been a while since I’ve been this active.” She gives a soft laugh.
###Chapter 0496

"Take the bed. I'll sleep on the couch."

"Thank you, Zachary." She rushed up the stairs while I settled onto the sofa.

Lottie talked nonstop during breakfast. Between spoonfuls of cereal, she tried to give Evelyn every possible detail about school. I couldn't get a single word in. Instead, I found myself watching Evelyn.

Her grey eyes shone brightly as she listened to every word from Lottie's mouth. I remained surprised that Lottie had slept through the night without any nightmares. Because I couldn't quite believe it, I hadn't slept at all. Well, that and the fact I couldn't get Isabella out of my head.

"Daddy?"

I blinked several times and smiled at Lottie.

"When will I shift?" she asked curiously. The question caught me off guard.

"When you're much older."

"But Evrin can." Lottie smiled at me. "And he can barely walk."

"Athena's twins?" Evelyn asked.

"Yes."

"One of them can shift?"

I nodded.

"Is that possible?"

"Athena could when she was young."

"Wow. Do you know if my mother could?" she asked with a frown.

"I don't know. I don't think there's much information about your mother. I believe it has more to do with who Athena is."

"The last female Alpha." Lottie announced proudly, looking at Evelyn. "Don't be sad about your mommy. I don't have one either, and I'm okay."

Evelyn looked away, running her hand through her short blonde hair. It was starting to grow out, though she still hated it. I liked it. It suited her.

"Go get ready." I told Lottie. She shoved another spoonful into her mouth and ran off toward the stairs.

"You want to find out about your mother?" I asked.

She frowned at me. "Yes and no. I understand that Athena and I are cousins and that our mothers were sisters. I know she gave me up to my dad. I know she wasn't ready to have me. But that doesn't stop me from being curious about her. What was she like? Do I carry any of her traits? Do I resemble her?" She sighed. "Then there's the part of me that wonders if it's better this way. I can't miss what I never had."

She passed me as she took the dishes to the sink. Holding out her hand, she waited for my mug. Her fingers brushed against mine as I handed it over. A sharp current shot up through my finger, and I almost dropped the mug.

Evelyn didn't react to the spark. Instead, she asked me if I hadn't gotten enough sleep while slowly taking the mug from me.

"My brain is on overdrive." I told her.

"I take it you didn't talk to Jasmine then." she muttered with her back to me.

"We talked, and I rejected her."

I saw her freeze, but she didn't turn around.

"I was at the hospital with Athena and Alexander. Athena wanted to talk with her, and everything that came out of her mouth was a lie."

"I lied." she whispered, and I heard the sadness in her tone.

"It was different. You were being forced to do something you didn't want to do. She just kept spewing more and more shit. Making demands. She couldn't even look Athena or Alexander in the eye while she was bullshitting them. And that Alpha Julian was just something Levi had told her."

"So it's not true? There's no Wolf trying to claim power?"

"No."

"Are you sure?" She turned around to face me, supporting herself on the counter. "They seem to come out of nowhere. And she did say she was running from him."

"I can't be sure about anything these days. But Alpha Ryan of Crestwood City is alive and well. It hasn't been taken over. Jasmine came from a place called Silver Streams."

She frowned at me. "I know that name."

"Silver Streams?"

"Dad told me that was where he met my mother."
###Chapter 0497
Evelyn

Zachary's intense gaze pinned me in place.
I fought the sudden urge to close the distance between us.
My skin tingled with the memory of his touch.
'Go on. Kiss him.' Dakota's voice echoed in my mind.

"I don't have any more information." I shook my head, trying to ignore Dakota's prodding.
Maybe I should have mentioned this earlier when they confirmed Athena was my cousin.
But it hadn't seemed relevant at the time.
"All I know is what I've already told you. She didn't want me. My father only told me where they met. He never spoke about her again, no matter how much I begged."

I sighed and looked away.
"Sometimes I wish I could talk to him just once more. To get even a little more information. Does that sound crazy?"
"You should have told us sooner."

"I didn't think it mattered." I rubbed my fingertips, remembering the strange sensation when our hands brushed.
That electric spark. The heat that traveled up my arm.
It had stolen my breath, but he hadn't reacted.
So I stayed silent.

'This is your opportunity.' Dakota whispered.
'He's still hung up on Isabella. And I'm not even sure what I felt. I can't smell him like the others.'

"Was that where your mother lived?" Zachary's question cut through my internal debate.
I shrugged, feeling butterflies in my stomach.
His gaze felt different now. Not judgmental. Not dismissive.
He actually saw me. The real me.

"Is that the Harrison family's original territory?" He pressed.
"I don't know. My father refused to say anything else."

"But Jasmine was a Wolf!" He muttered to himself.
"There are Wolves and Lycans here. Maybe they had both there too." I offered.

"That doesn't track. Jasmine didn't know about Lycans. Or if she did, she hid it well. Then again, she lied about so many other things."

"Why wouldn't those Lycans have come here?" I asked.
I knew Athena had summoned them. Seraphina had told me that much.

"It was never an order. She gave them a choice." He stepped back, and I realized how tense our closeness had made me.
"But that would mean they're aware of her."

"Wouldn't Theodore have known? You said he's a researcher."
"Depends how well the information was hidden. We'll drop Lottie at school, then you'll come with me to Sebastian's place to speak with Athena."

He moved close again.
I held my breath as his hand rested on my shoulder.
Another sharp spark shot through me.
"This could actually be helpful, Evelyn."

I felt the blush spreading across my chest.
It would reach my face any second if I didn't escape.
"I need to go wash up." I blurted out, rushing past him.

I ran upstairs and slipped into the bedroom.
Leaning against the closed door, I let out a shaky breath.
This crush was ridiculous. It made me feel like a teenager.
And he was completely off limits. We weren't even mated.
Plus, he still longed for his first mate.

'You're overthinking it.' Dakota murmured.
'Please don't encourage this.'

'I'm not doing anything. This is your natural reaction to him. I'm just along for the ride.'
'So helpful.' I whispered.

In the bathroom, I stared at my reflection.
My hair stuck out in every direction, not that there was much of it left.
I wet it down until it looked somewhat presentable.
I couldn't wait for it to grow back to its former length.

A knock sounded at the door.
"Evelyn? Daddy wants to know if you're ready. We need to leave." Charlotte called out.
"I'll be right there."

I splashed cold water on my face.
Taking a deep breath, I walked to the top of the staircase.

Zachary waited at the bottom.
He leaned against the wall with one foot propped up.
Charlotte raced back and forth, listing everything she needed for her session.

"Lottie, we do this every day. I promise you have everything."
"But..."
"If you need something, your teacher will let you borrow it. Or she can link me and I'll bring it."

He was so patient with her.
And she wasn't even biologically his.

'Our children will be beautiful.'
"Dakota!" I shouted, horrified by her words.

Zachary and Charlotte both looked up at me.
Their eyes wide with identical expressions of curiosity.
###Chapter 0498

"She's making fun of my hair." I lie, my cheeks burning with humiliation.

"Well, Evelyn." Zachary says, his gaze fixed on me. "I think it looks good on her."

My stomach fluttered nervously. Compliments were foreign to me.

He gives me a small smile. "Ready to go?"

I just nod, words failing me completely.

Charlotte holds my hand tightly as we walk toward the school. I feel the stares. I sense the judgment. Just days ago, I was locked in a dungeon for being untrustworthy. Now I'm walking with the Beta to pack school.

We stop near the entrance. I spot Seraphina with a young boy. Her brother, I assume. I watch him hug her before rushing inside. As she turns to leave, her eyes land on me. Instant fury flashes in her gaze. She hates me for lying. For betraying her trust.

I open my mouth to apologize. She walks right past me without a single glance.

"She'll come around." Charlotte tells me, releasing my hand. She throws her arms around me in a tight hug. She makes me promise to show Athena the sticker. Then she puts another one on my shirt.

"Do I get a hug?" Zachary asks as Charlotte starts to leave.

"You should hug Evelyn." She grins before darting through the school doors.

He doesn't reply. He just stares ahead silently. Clearing his throat, he asks if I'm ready to see Athena.

"As ready as I'll ever be." I made sure to eat a big breakfast. Just in case she sends me back to the dungeon.

Zachary stays quiet as we pass the destroyed packhouse. Workers are already inside clearing the rubble.

We stop at a house further down. Loud noises come from inside as Zachary knocks.

Alexander answers. His unusual crimson eyes sweep over me briefly before he invites us in.

Athena is on the sofa with her feet on an ottoman. One twin clings to her while the other pushes toy cars down a ramp, squealing with delight.

"How are you feeling?" Zachary asks her.

"Like I'm under constant surveillance." She murmurs, glancing at Alexander.

"Just ensuring you have everything you need." He replies softly.

She rolls her eyes and focuses on me. "How are you settling in?"

"Um, I've mostly been at Zachary's house. I took a walk with Charlotte, but that's it. I promise." I desperately wanted to avoid the dungeons. I hated being alone down there.

"No trouble." Zachary confirms. "Evelyn has been very helpful."

Something about how he said my name. It made me sound more interesting than I am.

"But you have information for us?" Alexander asks.

"I told Evelyn some things Jasmine said." Zachary explains. "Specifically the story about Jasmine coming from a pack called Silver Streams." He gestures toward me.

"Apparently that's where my Dad met my Mom." I blurt out.

"Your mother?" Alexander questions.

I nod. "And before you ask, that's all my father said. He never gave me more details. I knew more about Levi's mother than my own."

Alexander asks the same questions Zachary did.

He questions why Wolves and Lycans existed together. If Jasmine lied about her knowledge. They have almost the same conversation I had with Zachary. This time, Zachary tells him what I said.

I see Athena watching me. I keep quiet. It's easier not to speak. I notice how she shifts the twin clinging to her. He's fast asleep but looks so much like her. He must be the one who can shift.

"Silver Streams was never mentioned to you?" Alexander asks Athena.

"As far as I know, I always lived in Silver Creek. But then again, I don't remember much beyond what happened to me." She frowns, creases forming on her forehead. "Is that where the rest of my family is?"

"Not necessarily." I mutter.

Her eyes snap to mine.

"You're the Alpha. You became Alpha because your mother died. She would have been Alpha too, right? But the title usually passes after death or a ceremony, right?"

They all look at me.

"There might not be anyone there. But there could be others. Extended family." I shrug. Deep down, I wanted to go. I wanted to know about my mother. I wanted to know what she was like. Someone there must have known her.
###Chapter 0499
Athena

'She might be right.' Nyx whispers softly. 'Others could exist out there.'

'Even if they do, they never came looking for me? You know they would have sensed it when my binding shattered. They would have heard my call when I linked every mind. Not a single one reached out. None of the Lycans here have even mentioned Silver Streams.' Alexander watches me as I adjust Evrin in my arms, seeking a comfortable position. I don't recall feeling this way so early during my pregnancy with the twins.

I frown when I sense Alexander probing my thoughts, searching for clues behind my silence.

"Do you truly believe that's where your parents met?" I finally ask Evelyn.

She pulls her shoulders up toward her chin and drops her gaze. “I'm not sure. I just." She frowns deeply. "When Zachary told me the name, it felt familiar. Like a forgotten memory hiding in the back of my mind. I hadn't thought about her until Dakota appeared, and now it's like an itch I can't ignore."

After a brief pause, she looks up at us. "You understand, right? To learn about her and discover that part of my heritage."

"We know exactly what you mean." Zachary speaks gently to her, and I notice her giving him a small smile. Her cheeks slowly flush pink. Quickly, she turns back to me, trying to hide the deepening blush.

"Don't you wonder? If it's truly a place where our bloodline runs deep, don't we deserve to know?" Evelyn presses, pointing toward my twins. "Don't they deserve to understand every part of themselves?"

I can't hide my scowl. I already know where this is heading. She wants to go to Silver Streams. And in a strange way, she's asking for my permission.

"I need time to think." I mutter. "It's not as simple as packing up and heading to a pack I've never heard of. I have children to consider."

"She's also pregnant." Alexander adds firmly. "And supposed to be resting." He gives me a look that dares me to agree to this idea.

"Theodore." I murmur to Zachary. "Go ask him if he can find any information about Silver Streams beyond it being up north. Take Evelyn with you."

"No dungeon?" Evelyn asks quickly.

"Not for now." I confirm. She played a part in her brother's death. Allowing her some freedom is the least I can offer. She smiles gratefully. "I won't let you down."

Zachary grins at her too, and it's not just a friendly smile. He clearly likes her more than that, but she seems completely unaware.

They leave together, and Alexander sits beside me as Logan climbs onto his lap. "Did you see what I saw?"

I nod. "They'll figure it out. It's not our business."

"I don't think they're mates."

I shrug. "Sebastian wasn't mated to his wife."

"True." He tosses a giggling Logan into the air and catches him easily. "You really don't want to know more about your background, do you?"

I shake my head. "If my parents' attempt to get rid of me is any indication, the others—if they exist—are probably just as bad."

"It might not be all of them. I'm not defending your parents' actions. But perhaps they weren't prepared for you. Maybe they didn't know early shifting was possible." He frowns thoughtfully. "This whole situation makes me think about what Seraphina said initially. How she wanted what was hers. To take the pack as the eldest, even though it was never your father's. It sounds like your mother might have left everything behind to be with him. To start a new life, and others followed."

"You think they were a forbidden couple?"

"Possibly. Maybe your father was nobody important, and your grandparents disapproved."

"Does that happen? They were fated mates." I ask.

"It happens more often than you think."

"That would explain why Silver Creek was always hidden."
###Chapter 0500

He nodded while bouncing Logan on his knee. "That explains Dominic's desperation to strike a deal with me. Who were they preparing to battle?"

"You believe they intended to fight Silver Streams?"

"The urgency. His refusal to review the contract despite warnings. How readily he agreed to you accompanying me. It feels like we overlooked something crucial. Never before has an Alpha been so eager to sign a contract with me without examining my terms. Typically, I'm the one pushing for agreements, yet I always allow an opt-out clause if it suits my interests."

He made funny faces at Logan. "But Dominic was beyond desperate. Perhaps they weren't planning to attack, but rather to fortify their defenses. They clearly lacked the numbers for either scenario. They needed reinforcements urgently."

"What would they have been fighting over?"

His crimson eyes locked intensely with mine.

"Me?" I scoffed in disbelief.

"Your mother had passed. You had ascended to Alpha status. Though Dominic and Victoria moved quickly to bind you again. But you admitted it yourself - on your eighteenth birthday, you were temporarily unbound. If that state had persisted, Nyx might have appeared and they could have located you. They couldn't find you while you were bound."

"You genuinely think they were coming for me? That sounds completely insane."

"Considering everything we've learned, does it really?"

"They could have found me at any time since I've been here." I muttered.

"Perhaps they could have. Or perhaps circumstances changed. Maybe they realized your true potential and decided maintaining distance was wiser."

"That's utterly ridiculous."

"Is it? Reflect on how events unfolded. I'm not just referring to what happened to you. They were transforming Humans into Lycans long before attacking us, and long before I entered the picture. Zachary mentioned Victoria did it to create powerful weapons. Yes, they had plans for you, but they clearly had other schemes brewing, since I didn't know you until I saw you in Dominic's office."

"Even if we entertain this theory, why would they come for me?"

"To bring you back to your rightful home. To nurture you into the powerful female Alpha you're destined to become."

I shifted closer and placed Evrin on Alexander's lap before standing. I loosely retied my hair into a bun, ignoring the stray strands as I processed Alexander's words.

"That's too many hypotheticals!" I sighed heavily.

"Agreed. I'm merely exploring possible scenarios. Perhaps they knew your parents tried to abandon you. Maybe they were attempting to rescue you. Possibly they wanted to offer you a better life."

"Anything would have been better than the torment Dominic and the others put me through. Near starvation, constant dehydration, sometimes barely able to stand without the room spinning. All I ever wanted was acceptance for who I am."

"Like I said, these are just theories. We don't know what's true." He shrugged.

"But you think I should consider it?"

"I believe you should do whatever feels right for you. I'm not pushing you either way. This must be your decision alone."

"As I told Nyx, not one of them bothered to contact me when they easily could have. I won't chase after something that doesn't need chasing. Besides, I'm carrying another set of twins. Would you really let me travel north while pregnant, not knowing what we might face?"

"Valid point." He smiled.

"If Theodore can provide Zachary with substantial information worth investigating, I might consider it after the babies arrive." I patted my stomach. 'We could try searching through the links to find them.' Nyx suggested.

'No.' I responded firmly. I wanted this peace to continue. I needed to focus on my pack and my growing family. Especially with my constantly shifting son.
