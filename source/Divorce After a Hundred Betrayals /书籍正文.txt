###Chapter 1

Every time my husband cheated, he would give me a jade bangle.
In four years of marriage, I collected ninety-nine of them.
I forgave him ninety-nine times.
This time, he returned from a three-day business trip with an Imperial Jade Bangle worth millions.
I knew it was time for a divorce.
----------
When Escent Roland walked through the door, I was crumpling up the "Post-abortion Care Instructions" and tossing them into the trash.
Three days ago, he had used a business trip as an excuse to celebrate a young girl's birthday.
The gift of a million-dollar property was glaringly obvious.
In my emotional turmoil, I had lost our child unexpectedly.
Just discharged from the hospital, I stared at the densely packed jade bangles in my jewelry box and, against medical advice, ordered fried chicken and iced cola.
Escent quickly walked over and swept the food into the trash.
"With your stomach issues, you're eating ice-cold food?"
He pulled a velvet box from his briefcase.
"I got this especially for you. It took a lot of effort."
Inside was an Imperial Jade Bangle.
Its color was rich, and the clarity was exceptional.
Such quality was rare on the market, worth at least two million.
He wasn't lying; acquiring this bangle had indeed taken effort.
If I had received it before our marriage, I might have happily thrown myself into his arms.
But now, I felt nothing.
I didn't even want to try it on.
Escent bent down to study my expression.
"Are you upset because I didn't accompany you to visit your mother's grave? We can go now."
I lowered my eyes.
"No need. The anniversary has passed."
Before we married, we had agreed on three rules.
We could skip any holiday, but he had to accompany me to pay respects on my mother's death anniversary.
For the first three years, he had done well.
This year, when I called him, he gently said he was on a business trip in another province and asked what was wrong.
I checked the flights; the latest one was at 10 PM.
He couldn't make it back.
In the end, I went to the cemetery alone.
At my mother's grave, I received an anonymous email.
The photo showed Escent with a young girl cutting a cake, a property transfer agreement on the table.
The world spun.
When I woke up, I was in the hospital, and the baby was gone.
"It was Mom's anniversary... I'm sorry, darling, I forgot."
A flicker of genuine surprise crossed Escent's eyes.
He knelt on one knee and took my hand.
"Let me make it up to you.
How about another Imperial Jade Bangle? This one's two million; next time, I'll get one for three."
From dating to marriage, Escent was always like this.
First, he would apologize.
Then, he would offer emotional comfort.
Finally, he would throw money at me until I relented.
In six years, no one had ever seen him lose his temper.
All our friends praised him as the perfect husband.
Only I knew that this marriage had rotted from the core.
Just as I was about to bring up divorce, my stomach growled.
Escent tenderly ruffled my hair.
"Let me make you some congee first. You can think about whether you want the bangle or a house."
He turned and went into the kitchen.
His phone on the coffee table buzzed.
The screen lit up.
A message from Sophia Lefèvre popped up.
"Escent, thank you for the big house~ These three days were amazing!"
My heart twinged.
I opened her social media.
The cover photo was a picture of the two of them on a mountaintop.
The girl was facing the camera with a peace sign, Escent's back half in the frame.
My fingers trembled as I scrolled down.
The last three days were filled with travel updates.
"He's here, and I can't even open a bottle cap!"
"My crush's smile is too cute!"
"Daily life of a star and her CEO boyfriend~"
Every post had Escent's like.
The latest one was a photo of the Imperial Jade Bangle.
The caption: "Ugh~ so ugly, I wouldn't take it even if it were free."
This was the only post without his like.
The phone buzzed again.
"Escent, I drank too much after you left. Can you come over tonight?"
From the kitchen, Escent's gentle voice called out.
"The congee is almost ready."
I quickly installed a surveillance app on his phone.
After erasing my traces, I put it back.
Escent came out with a bowl of shrimp congee.
Glancing at the phone screen, the corner of his mouth twitched imperceptibly.
He stood up, feigning distress.
"There's an urgent matter at the office. I need to handle it."
I slowly stirred the congee in my bowl.
"If it's busy, just stay at the office."
"Okay."
A flash of joy crossed his eyes, and he even thoughtfully prepared a foot soak before leaving.
After the door closed, I placed the Imperial Jade Bangle in the jewelry box.
Each box held twenty bangles.
This was the fifth full box.
Three years ago, when rumors first surfaced about him and an intern, he came home immediately to explain.
He said it was just a show, a workplace necessity.
That he would only ever love me.
As an apology, he bought the first jade bangle.
Back then, it was only worth twenty thousand.
But I was happy.
I thought he understood my tastes and cared about my feelings.
Over time, the bangles kept coming.
Their prices kept rising.
But I could no longer smile.
On my birthday six months ago, the night I received the eightieth bangle,
I whispered to the cabinet full of jade,
"When I reach one hundred, it's time for a divorce."
###Chapter 2

A soft, cooing female voice suddenly came from the phone.

"Brother, are you here? I've been waiting for you for so long."

It was the surveillance app on Escent Roland's phone transmitting in real time.

He had indeed gone to see Sophia Lefèvre.

"Didn't you ask me to come and keep you company? How much have you drunk?"

The girl let out a playful huff.

"I was just teasing you. I haven't been drinking. I just didn't want you to stay with that shrew!"

There was a brief silence on the other end of the line.

Escent's voice turned cold.

"Sophia, don't talk about her like that."

Sophia pouted reluctantly.

"Fine, I won't call her a shrew."

"Even if she's not here, you shouldn't speak ill of her."

"Hmph, if she knew you were defending her like this, she'd be thrilled to death."

Her tone was clearly displeased.

Escent sighed and pulled her closer.

"Stop messing around. Come here."

The sound of a sticky kiss came through the phone.

With the sound of a door closing, the surveillance suddenly cut off.

They must have gone into the bedroom.

Half an hour later, faint voices could be heard from the phone.

"Escent, did you do what you promised me? It's been three days since Oscar passed."

Sophia's coquettish voice was full of anticipation.

"Yeah."

Escent hesitated but still spoke with affection.

"I'll go with you tomorrow. Remember to keep it low-key. Don't let Isabella know."

I frowned deeply.

Oscar was Sophia's dog.

It had died?

What had Escent promised her?

Why couldn't I know about it?

Before I could figure it out, Escent took the phone into the bedroom.

That night, they went at it three times.

I stared at the ceiling, unable to sleep all night.

I had heard Sophia's name long ago.

She was Escent's junior in high school and his first love.

Their love had been passionate during their school days.

When they made their relationship public, the Roland family strongly opposed it.

I heard that Eleanor Roland had privately investigated Sophia.

Whatever she found out, both Escent's parents were determined to break them up.

Escent resisted for half a year.

But in the end, it was Sophia who gave in first.

That same year, Eleanor sent her abroad to study.

Escent was devastated for several years.

It wasn't until he met me that he slowly came out of the shadows.

I thought he had completely moved on by the time we got married.

Clearly, I had overestimated myself.

I opened the photo of the property deed Sophia had sent again.

Over the past three years, Escent had bought many things for those young girls.

But they were all bags and jewelry.

Buying a house was a first.

The next morning, Escent returned home.

He looked at my dark circles and hugged me with concern.

"Darling, didn't sleep well last night?"

"Yeah." I rubbed my temples, avoiding his touch.

"Can you make me some noodles? I'm hungry."

"Of course, you're my wife."

Escent pinched my cheek affectionately.

As if nothing had happened the night before.

He turned and walked into the kitchen.

I quickly picked up his phone.

I opened the chat history with Sophia.

The latest message was from ten minutes ago.

"After you deal with her, will you come pick me up to go to her mother's grave?"

"Yeah, keep it a secret. Don't tell anyone."

"Don't worry, brother, I'm very tight-lipped. Love you~"

For some reason, these messages sent a chill down my spine.

What were they planning to do at my mother's grave?

Just after breakfast, Escent said he had to go back to the office.

I wasn't at ease.

First, I went to the print shop to get the documents Eleanor had used to investigate Sophia years ago.

Then I drove to the cemetery.

Two hours later, I entered the cemetery.

From a distance, I saw the two of them standing in front of my mother's grave.

Sophia was dressed in black, holding an urn with a sorrowful expression.

Escent stood beside her, directing three bodyguards to dig an empty grave to the left.

They were all facing away from me and didn't notice my approach.

Soon, a deep pit was dug in the empty grave.

Sophia bent down and placed the urn inside.

She sobbed and said,

"Wuwu, Oscar, Mommy has finally buried you."

Oscar?

An urn?

Burial?

My mind went blank.

I rushed forward and slapped Sophia hard across the face.

"Sophia Lefèvre, who gave you permission to touch this grave?!"

"I..." Sophia covered her face, looking at me in shock.

She hadn't expected me to show up.

I gritted my teeth and slapped her again.

"Take that urn away immediately!"

I rarely lost my temper in front of others.

After burying my mother, I had spent a fortune to buy the empty graves on either side.

I had planned to reserve them for my father and myself.

It was my mother's dying wish.

She wanted our family of three to be buried together.

I never expected Sophia to use it to bury her dog today!
###Chapter 3

Sophia Lefèvre's cheeks were swollen and red, her entire body clinging weakly to Escent Roland's chest.

She sobbed softly, her voice filled with grievance:

"Escent... she hit me..."

A flicker of surprise crossed Escent's eyes, clearly not expecting my sudden appearance.

He took half a step back, creating distance between himself and Sophia.

"Isabella, please calm down. Let me explain."

Escent reached out to touch me, but Sophia quickly stepped between us.

Escent's expression darkened immediately.

Sophia tilted her face up, revealing her swollen cheeks, tears still hanging at the corners of her eyes.

The reprimand on Escent's lips was swallowed back.

"Isabella, it's not what you think."

I stared coldly at Escent, feeling as though the man before me was a complete stranger.

"I don't want to hear explanations. Tell her to take the dog's urn away!"

Escent sighed:

"She didn't mean to bury it here. We consulted a master who said this spot has good feng shui, ensuring the dog a good reincarnation."

"She also agreed not to erect a tombstone. The master said burying the dog here won't affect future burials. Is that acceptable?"

I trembled with anger:

"No! It must be removed!"

"Escent, you know how much my mother feared dogs! If you dare bury that dog here, we're getting a divorce right now! My mother would never accept a son-in-law like you! Don't forget how she treated you before she died!"

At the mention of divorce, Escent's expression stiffened.

"Isabella..."

Sophia suddenly burst into loud sobs:

"Isabella, Escent has mentioned you before, but at your age, how can you still be so petty? You're in a bad mood today, can't you just let this small matter slide?"

"If you want to vent your anger, direct it at me. I feel sorry for Escent..."

I glared at her icily:

"You want me to vent at you? Fine, I'll oblige."

I grabbed her hair and dragged her to the freshly dug pit, kicking her hard.

Sophia was forced to her knees, crying pitifully.

I said emotionlessly:

"Take the urn now and kneel before my mother's grave to apologize, or I'll tear that mistress face of yours apart!"

Sophia clutched the urn, looking pitifully at Escent.

Escent's face changed drastically:

"Enough! The dog hasn't even been buried yet. Forcing her to kneel and apologize is going too far!"

My heart raced with anger:

"I'm going too far? Who started this? There are so many cemeteries in the city, yet she had to choose this one, pretending to consult a master about feng shui, just to disturb my mother's peace! What is she really after?"

Sophia sobbed: "Isabella, don't blame Escent. I'll kneel."

Escent stopped her, taking the urn tenderly:

"No need to kneel. Let me take you to bury the dog first."

They walked away side by side, leaving me standing alone.

As if I were the one in the wrong.

I laughed bitterly to myself, then turned to have the bodyguards fill in the grave.

Suddenly, I noticed the right side of my mother's grave.

The empty plot I had bought at great expense now had a new tombstone...

I glanced at it, gritting my teeth:

"Sophia, stop! Did you bury the dog in the empty plot on the right?"

Hearing my shout, Sophia's eyes flashed with panic.

She lowered her head, clutching Escent's hand tightly:

"Escent, I'm scared..."

Escent shook off her hand and hurried back, his face changing when he saw the altered plot:

"Sophia, I told you not to touch this plot without my permission!"

Sophia broke down crying:

"I didn't mean to. My friend's dog died last week from eating grapes, and there was nowhere to bury it."

"The master said having two dogs would protect the deceased. I was doing it for Isabella's sake."

Sophia apologized profusely, her demeanor humble.

But upon closer look, her eyes were filled with provocation and triumph!

Both empty plots beside my mother's grave had been desecrated!

At that moment, I wanted to kill her!

My mother had doted on me since I was a child. Her death in a car accident, leaving me unable to fulfill my filial duties, was my greatest regret in life.

These three adjacent plots were the only thing I could do for her!

Now, Sophia had ruined everything!

I rushed forward, grabbed Sophia's hair, kicked her twice, and forced her to kneel before my mother's grave!

"Kowtow and apologize to my mother!"

Sophia's knees were scraped, and she cried out in pain. Escent, heartbroken, pulled her up and shielded her behind him.

I was so furious I grabbed my bag and hurled it at Sophia.

Escent turned to block her.

The metal on the bag slashed Escent's face, leaving a deep, bone-visible wound!

For a moment, we were all stunned.

Sophia screamed at me:

"Enough! It's just three plots! I'll find you three new ones, and we can move your mother there. Why resort to violence?"

She pointed to the cemetery:

"How about those three empty plots over there? Or those three? If not, I'll compensate you with five!"

Escent covered his face, muffling Sophia's mouth, and said darkly:

"Stop talking! Let's go back!"

Sophia was taken aback, looking at him with grievance:

"Every time we argue, you take her side. Can't you side with me just once?"

Escent frowned, his expression conflicted.

I sneered.

In the next moment, I snatched the urn from Sophia's hands and did something that shocked both of them.
###Chapter 4

I opened the urn.

The white powder scattered in the wind.

It all landed on Sophia's face.

She screamed and stepped back.

Her hair was covered in grayish traces.

Her eyes instantly turned red.

"Isabella! You're insane!"

Sophia trembled as she pointed at me.

"Ball Ball was like my own son..."

She choked on her words.

Escent's face darkened.

He shielded Sophia's shoulder.

His gaze was as cold as ice.

"Isabella, that's enough."

His voice was laced with anger.

"Sophia loves animals dearly."

"How is this any different from killing her?"

I watched them calmly.

Sophia sobbed in his arms.

Her acting was impeccable.

"Are you sure she loves dogs?"

My voice was eerily calm.

"Why don't you ask her."

"Does she love dogs or abuse them?"

Sophia stiffened.

Her eyes darted around.

"What... what are you talking about..."

I took a step forward.

Staring into her evasive eyes.

"Sophia."

"Do you dare call yourself an animal lover?"

She frantically grabbed Escent's sleeve.

"Escent... she's slandering me..."

"Just because she's jealous of my youth..."

Tears fell instantly.

Escent gently wiped her tears.

He turned to me with a frown.

"Stop this, let's go home."

My chest felt tight.

I pulled out a document from my bag.

And threw it in Escent's face.

"Here's your evidence."

Papers scattered on the floor.

"Take a good look at your precious Sophia."

"See what kind of person she really is."

Escent froze.

He picked up the yellowed case record.

His pupils suddenly contracted.

"What... is this?"

His fingers trembled slightly.

Sophia lunged forward like a madwoman.

Trying to grab the papers.

"It's fake! All fake!"

She screamed.

But Escent pushed her away.

He stared at the case details.

His face grew paler.

"Animal abuse..."

"Defendant Sophia Lefèvre..."

He looked up abruptly.

His eyes bloodshot.

"You lied to me?"

His voice was hoarse and terrifying.

Sophia collapsed on the floor.

"They're just cats and dogs..."

"Is this really necessary..."

She continued to argue.

Escent grabbed her neck.

The veins on his hand bulged.

"My mother back then..."

"Wasn't it because of your poor family?"

Sophia's face turned purple.

Bodyguards rushed to intervene.

"Mr. Roland, this could kill her."

He let go.

Sophia coughed weakly on the floor.

"Let's get a divorce."

I said softly.

Sophia's eyes lit up.

But Escent grabbed my wrist.

"Wife, don't go..."

His voice was pleading.

"I was wrong..."

I pulled my hand away.

Directed the bodyguards to fill the pit.

And dug out the fake tombstone next to my mother's grave.

As I turned to leave.

Escent followed silently in his car.

Escorting me all the way home.

Late at night.

I called my best friend.

"Is the divorce agreement ready?"

The next morning.

Escent returned with a new Belle Bangle.

"Wife, look at this bangle."

"It's even more beautiful than the last one."

I glanced at it.

The quality was indeed exquisite.

But I felt nothing.

"Make me some rice noodles."

I sent him away.

Quickly picked up his phone.

The surveillance app was still there.

The chat history was right before my eyes.

Sophia had sent a message half an hour ago.

"Brother, forgive me~"

"Last night was so good..."

Escent's reply was explicit.

My heart turned completely cold.

I booked the earliest flight.

While packing, I took nothing of his.

The divorce agreement was on the coffee table.

Before the plane took off.

I removed the old SIM card.

And replaced it with a new number.

Outside the window, clouds churned.

Like my life, reborn anew.
###Chapter 5

As dusk fell, I dragged my suitcase back home.

My father was visibly startled when he saw me.

His gaze fell on the suitcase behind me. After a moment of silence, he turned and walked into the kitchen.

Soon, the dining table was filled with my favorite dishes.

Father brought out a case of beer, opened a bottle, and handed it to me.

"Have a drink with your dad tonight."

I took the bottle and gently clinked it with his.

Just like when I was a child, he carefully peeled a plate of shrimp and pushed it in front of me.

He lowered his voice and asked, "Sweetheart, are you getting a divorce?"

There was no hint of blame in his tone, only deep concern.

I picked up a shrimp, dipped it in sauce, and said, "Yes, I want to."

It felt so good to have my father by my side.

Father added a chicken leg to my plate and gently patted my head.

"It's better this way. When your mother and I were planning to have you, we saved enough money for you to last a lifetime."

"You always have the freedom to make mistakes, whether in marriage or in your career."

In truth, my father had never approved of this marriage from the start.

I remember the night Escent proposed, he specifically invited my parents to witness it.

That night, Escent got drunk and stumbled into the bathroom.

My father followed him in and heard him calling someone else's name.

"Sophia, Sophia."

Father immediately punched Escent a few times.

When Escent sobered up, he knelt on the ground and explained that he was just drunk and talking nonsense.

"Dad, I truly want to marry Isabella. I can put all my properties in her name, and even give her my shares."

That night, my father called me into his room and seriously asked if I wanted to marry him.

At that time, I had been too sheltered, and Escent hadn't cheated yet.

I said, "Yes."

Father sighed and asked me to make him a promise.

"You can marry him, but if you get pregnant and want to have a child, you must tell me immediately."

I swore to my father on the spot.

Father sighed again, "Thank goodness you didn't have a child, or you'd be tied to him forever."

"Yes."

Actually, before I found out I was pregnant, I had already thought about divorce.

I was just waiting for the right moment.

Until the moment I miscarried at my mother's grave.

That's when I decided I had to get a divorce.

During this time, I planned to stay at my father's house and open a small boutique inn to pass the time.

I thought that after leaving the divorce agreement, Escent would sign it without hesitation.

After all, he had long wanted to be with Sophia openly.

But just three days later, as I was leaving the neighborhood, I ran into Escent.

He looked haggard, with a stubbly beard and had lost a lot of weight.

On his wrist was the 101 bangles I had given him, and he was wearing the gray sweater I had knitted.

That sweater was a gift I gave him on his birthday two years ago.

Since I met Escent, he had only worn one black sweater every winter.

That sweater had been washed so many times it was faded and pilled, but he never wanted to throw it away.

I couldn't stand it, so I found a teacher and learned how to knit a sweater.

It took me three months to finish that gray sweater.

The day I gave it to him, his eyes lit up, and he looked at me adoringly.

"Did my wife knit this? I love it."

But he only wore it once in front of me.

After that, he continued to wear that pilled black sweater.

I didn't understand and asked him, "Did I knit it poorly?"

Escent pinched my cheek and led me to open the wardrobe.

"My wife's sweater is too precious to wear. I hang it in the most prominent place in the wardrobe so I can see it every day."

At that time, my heart was sweet, and I was very happy with his words.

Until later, when Sophia first followed me on social media.

She sent me a private message, and that's when I found out.

That pilled sweater was the one Sophia had knitted for him before she went abroad.

When Escent saw me, he urgently grabbed my hand.

"Are you still mad, my love? Look, I'm wearing the bangles you like, and I'm wearing the sweater you knitted."

"Don't leave me, okay?"

His tone was pitiful, his eyes tender and affectionate.

If it weren't for the sounds of him and Sophia being intimate that I occasionally heard through the surveillance app these past three days.

I might have been fooled by him again.

Now I understand that getting married back then wasn't because I was blindly in love.

But because he was just too skilled.

He was truly the fighter jet among scumbags.

"Sign the divorce agreement soon, so we can part on good terms."
###Chapter 6

I stared coldly at his face, feigning deep emotion.

My stomach churned violently.

The lunch I had just eaten threatened to rise in my throat.

I turned to leave.

Escent Roland quickly blocked my path.

His voice was deliberately soft:

"Isabella, I've been reflecting seriously these past three days."

"You're still angry, aren't you?"

"Is it because the last bangle wasn't good enough? I've ordered a top-quality Imperial Jade Bangle, it will arrive the day after tomorrow."

"Come home with me, please?"

I almost laughed out loud.

Six years of dating, four years of marriage.

I had never realized he could twist the truth so shamelessly.

His audacity was astonishing.

The fundamental reason for the collapse of this marriage was his three-year-long affair.

One betrayal after another.

Yet now he casually dismissed it as me being dissatisfied with the bangle's value.

Shifting all the blame onto me.

And still so confident that I would return to him.

Where did he get such confidence?

"Escent, you are utterly absurd."

"Since you don't understand, I'll say it one last time."

"I don't want you anymore."

"All I want now is a divorce."

Escent was stunned.

His eyes instantly reddened.

He reached out to hug me, but I pushed him away fiercely.

"Isabella, why are you suddenly so resolute?"

"Have you heard some rumors and misunderstood me again?"

"I can explain everything that's happened recently."

He opened a jewelry box, pointing to a row of jade bangles inside:

"This Imperial Jade Bangle, I gave it to you because I was afraid Sophia Lefèvre might do something drastic."

"She tried to commit suicide on her birthday, I couldn't just stand by and do nothing."

"This Belle Bangle was for your birthday."

"Posting that photo with my ex was just a game, a dare I lost."

"And this carved bangle..."

I couldn't be bothered to listen further.

I walked to the neighborhood entrance and bought a cup of milk tea.

Escent followed behind me, babbling incessantly.

Until even he couldn't continue.

I took a sip of the milk tea and interrupted directly:

"Do you even believe these words yourself?"

Escent was completely panicked:

"Isabella, actually on the day I proposed, Sophia Lefèvre called me."

"She said she wanted to come back and marry me, but I refused her."

"Because I refused, she impulsively married someone else, then quickly divorced."

His voice grew lower, filled with guilt:

"I'm being nice to her now because I feel I owe her."

"Even if she abused cats, being forced abroad alone by my mother Eleanor Roland, she's so pitiful."

"I promise I won't contact Sophia Lefèvre anymore, will you come back?"

I paused mid-sip.

So on the day he proposed, Sophia Lefèvre was also vying for him.

I remembered the first time I met Escent six years ago.

At a business gathering.

I wore a white evening gown, stunning everyone alongside my best friend Olivia Sherwood.

We always lived freely.

We were having a great time during the dance.

Suddenly Escent approached and interrupted.

He draped his suit jacket around my waist.

I was about to get angry.

He bent down and whispered:

"Miss, your period has stained your dress, use mine to cover it."

My cheeks instantly burned.

"Thank you."

At that moment, I noticed him.

The only son of the wealthiest man in Yichun.

As attentive and considerate as the rumors said, a tall, rich, and handsome man.

I never expected that when he proposed, he chose me over Sophia Lefèvre.

My stomach churned again.

It was truly nauseating.

I stared at him coldly:

"Do you think telling me this would make me moved and forgive you?"

"Her impulsive marriage and divorce weren't caused by me, nor by you."

"She made her own choices and must bear the consequences herself."

"Yet you want me to take the blame."

"Tolerating her interference in our marriage!"

"You're always so self-righteous."

"I'm growing more and more disgusted by you."

I stood up to leave.

Escent grabbed me again:

"We're innocent! Isabella!"

"Still lying?"

I shook him off fiercely, enunciating each word:

"Twice last night, three times the night before, twice the day before that!"

"Escent, what are you still pretending for now?"

I shouted so loudly that people around us turned to look.

Escent guiltily lowered his head.

"How... how do you know?"

"If you don't sign, I'll sue you for adultery."

I turned and left.

Escent called after me:

"Isabella, is there really no chance for us?"

"None. I just want a divorce."
###Chapter 7

Six months had passed in the blink of an eye.

My boutique inn finally opened as planned.

The afternoon sun was just right.

I often sat with a few friends, sipping tea.

We chatted about trivial matters, enjoying the moment.

Life after leaving Escent Roland had never been more peaceful.

Suddenly, my phone rang.

It was Olivia Sherwood, my best friend.

"Darling, it's time to come back."

"The divorce hearing is tomorrow."

"Alright," I replied softly.

That night, I booked a flight.

The next day in court.

Escent still refused to divorce.

Surprisingly, Sophia Lefèvre didn't show up.

Escent recounted our past.

The bangle, the gifts, every little detail.

The judge was moved.

The final verdict was to reconvene another day.

As I stepped out of the courthouse.

A white car suddenly sped towards me.

Sophia was at the wheel.

She pressed the accelerator to the floor.

Her face twisted in rage.

"Bitch! Die!"

"If you hadn't taken Escent from me."

"I wouldn't have impulsively married that scumbag."

"Quick marriage, quick divorce, now I'm a divorcee!"

"Why is it that even after you left."

"He still won't marry me?"

"He even blames me!"

"Did you cast a spell on him?"

The car was heading straight for me.

I stood frozen.

Unable to move.

Suddenly, a familiar figure appeared.

Escent pushed me out of the way.

The sound of impact was deafening.

He was thrown onto the road.

Blood pooled around him.

Security quickly controlled the scene.

Someone called the police.

I looked at him lying in a pool of blood.

My heart remained unmoved.

I turned to leave.

But he grabbed my ankle.

He pleaded, blood gurgling from his mouth.

"Wife, I was wrong."

"Please forgive me."

The movement aggravated his wounds.

Blood flowed faster.

I looked down coldly.

"Escent, I really want a divorce."

"Stop clinging."

"Your actions only disgust me."

He let go, stunned.

His lips moved slightly.

I pursed my lips.

Quickly got into Olivia's car.

I didn't want to stay a moment longer.

The next day, I flew back to the inn.

Six months later.

I returned to Yichun again.

This time.

The divorce decree finally came through.

That night, Olivia and I celebrated with hotpot.

"Those two got what they deserved."

"Escent was left half-paralyzed."

"Sophia was sentenced to prison."

I was surprised.

"Escent let her go to jail?"

Olivia gulped her cola.

"He hates her now."

"He blames her for everything."

"The divorce, his disability, it's all her fault."

"Besides."

"His parents won't let her off either."

I blinked.

Picked up some duck blood and ate it.

"Whatever."

"I'm single now."

"Let's go out tonight."

"Yes, ma'am!"

Epilogue

Another six months passed.

I heard an old piece of gossip.

About Escent and Sophia's past.

I heard that Eleanor Roland, Escent's mother.

Not only investigated Sophia.

But also consulted a fortune teller about their compatibility.

The fortune teller shook his head at their birth charts.

He sighed heavily.

"Not good."

"Their astrological signs clash."

"Their marriage prospects are very poor."

"This woman's birth chart."

"Will bring great misfortune to your son."

"There will be a major disaster in the Year of the Dragon."

"If they remain in contact."

"Great calamity will surely follow."

Eleanor was terrified.

That's why she sent Sophia abroad.

When I heard this gossip.

I was sitting in the inn's garden.

Playing chess with my boy toy.

Coincidentally.
