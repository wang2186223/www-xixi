###Chapter 1

Sophia Laurent was thirty, the age when a woman is at her most mature and captivating.
Yet she had divorced because her husband cheated during her pregnancy.

Her ex-husband was quite wealthy, so she had always taken great care of her appearance.
Her skin was even more flawless and delicate than a young girl's.

Now, she gently held my large hand and whispered helplessly, "The underground garage is empty right now. I'm really not feeling well. Could you accompany me?"

Her face flushed with shyness, revealing a unique beauty.

Her words ignited a fire within me.

"Ahem... alright, shall we go now?"

Sophia was overjoyed. "Great! I'll be counting on you then, John!"

"Mm," I replied, suppressing the heat rising in my abdomen as I followed closely behind her.

She swayed her slender waist, and from behind, the curve of her hips was mesmerizing.

Soon, Sophia led me to the underground parking lot.

"Thanks for your help, John!" She handed me her car keys. "Please come with me to the hospital for a check-up!"

I nearly choked. So she meant accompanying her to the hospital? I had thought...

"What's wrong?"

Noticing my strange expression, Sophia looked at me puzzled, her gaze almost innocent.

It was my misunderstanding. I couldn't possibly explain, so I took the keys and opened the car door. "It's nothing. Let's go."

Sophia drove a Mercedes-Benz, a powerful machine.

Driving a car most ordinary people could only dream of thrilled me. Once inside, I couldn't help but run my hands over everything. "Genuine leather seats! And listen to that engine roar!"

Seeing my admiration for her car, Sophia smiled. "John, do you know a lot about cars?"

"Of course," I said.

She eagerly asked, "What do you think of my car?"

"It's the best I've ever seen."

I stepped on the accelerator, teasing the divorced woman. "Just by the sound, I can tell the intake must be deep!"

I filled my words with innuendo, hoping to flirt with her.

Unfortunately, Sophia didn't catch on. She asked confused, "Oil leakage? I haven't noticed that. Is it serious, John? I haven't serviced it in a while. Could you help me fix it sometime?"

"Sometime, definitely!"

Driving her car, I took Sophia to her usual hospital for the check-up.

After parking, we took the elevator upstairs.

Registering, paying fees, and waiting in line exhausted me. Sophia complained her chest felt painfully swollen, so I couldn't refuse to help.

Finally, it was our turn.

"Please come in!"

Hearing the doctor's voice, Sophia and I entered together.

"Oh, you brought your husband today?" The doctor was a woman Sophia often visited, but her husband had never accompanied her before.

Right away, the doctor mistook me for Sophia's husband.

Worse, Sophia didn't correct her.

Seeing Sophia sit across from the doctor, I awkwardly smiled.

"Doctor, please take a look at her. She's been complaining about the pain."

The doctor glanced at me. "This is the husband's responsibility. You should massage her regularly to prevent blockages."

"Also, if there's excess milk the baby can't drain, you'll need to help. Don't slack off. You must assist every night. The baby isn't just hers!"

The doctor sternly lectured me while gently palpating Sophia's chest.

Sophia's face turned crimson with embarrassment, almost too shy to look at me.

I knew she didn't want unrelated people to know about her divorce, so I took the blame.

"Alright, I'll make sure to help tonight. I'll fulfill my duties."

"That's more like it."

Only after my earnest promise did the doctor's expression soften.

"Ah!"

Before Sophia and I could relax, the doctor made another discovery.

"Why is there a lump here?"

Sophia panicked. "Is it serious?"

"Of course it's serious! A lump is never a good sign. It might even require surgery."

Hearing this, I grew worried for Sophia.

"Doctor, please examine her quickly," I urged.

"Absolutely!" The doctor removed her hands from Sophia's chest. "Lift your shirt. Let me take a look."

"This..." Sophia's face flushed red to her neck. "It might be a bit inconvenient."

I also hesitated.

"What's inconvenient? I'm a woman. It's not like I'm peeping!" The doctor said impatiently. "Hurry up and lift your shirt. There's no one else here!"

I broke into a sweat. Sophia obviously didn't want me to see. I couldn't take advantage of her.

I should be considerate.

"I'll wait outside," I said, turning to leave. But the doctor stopped me.

"Are you two shy? Don't leave. I need to give some instructions. You should listen too."

Trapped, I had no choice.

I glanced at Sophia for help.

Her face was red, but she didn't object. Since she wouldn't explain, I didn't dare say more.

I watched helplessly as Sophia gently lifted her shirt.

To avoid exposing too much, she turned slightly, giving me her back.

But I still caught a glimpse of rounded fullness.

Pale and beautiful.

As she removed her shirt, Sophia gasped softly, as if the fabric had stuck to her milk-dampened skin.

The motion seemed to stimulate her, and she let out an unconscious murmur.

Standing nearby, I didn't know whether to look or not.

Heat rushed from my head to my toes.

My hands trembled, unsure where to place them.

Ignoring me, the doctor pressed on the lump in Sophia's breast.

"This area indeed has an issue. You'll need a scan later. And why is your husband standing so far away? He doesn't seem concerned about you at all!"

Noticing my avoidance, the doctor thought I didn't care and grew angry. "Come here and feel it too. Understand what your wife is going through!"

"Ah..." I looked at the doctor's stern face and Sophia, who seemed ready to vanish from embarrassment.

While I hesitated, the doctor urged again, "Just feel it. How else will you understand the condition? Are you really her husband or not?"

Cornered, and with Sophia still silent, I had no choice.

Summoning courage, I approached Sophia.

My trembling hand reached out.

I couldn't help but apply pressure...
###Chapter 2

Sophia’s eyes glazed over with pleasure.
She couldn’t control herself and let out a moan.
She nearly stained the doctor’s coat.

I gave an awkward laugh.
“Doctor, how serious is Sophia’s condition?”

“I don’t know yet. We’ll need to see the scan results. Go get the scan done now. We’ll review it when the results come in.”

After receiving the examination order, I took Sophia to pay for and complete the scan.

It was done in the afternoon.
The results wouldn’t be available until tomorrow.

We would have to come back tomorrow to check.

“John, thank you so much for your help.”

Sophia shyly expressed her gratitude.
I quickly responded, “It’s nothing. We’re colleagues. We should help each other when there’s difficulty.”

“What about tomorrow…”

“Alright, alright. I’ll see this through. I’ll make another trip tomorrow.”

Sophia was immediately overjoyed.
“Thank you!”

We got in the car.
I saw that it was getting late.
I decided to drive Sophia home first.

Sophia lived in an upscale residential complex.
The complex was very large.

I helped her park the car.
Sophia then invited me in for a glass of water.

It was my first time visiting.
I wanted to see the large house she lived in.

“Sure, I’ll come in and take a look.”

Sophia lived in a duplex.
She told me to make myself at home as soon as we entered.

A child’s cries came from inside the house.

“Please wait a moment. The baby is crying.”

Sophia hurried inside.
This gave me time to look around.

Besides the luxurious decor, I noticed Sophia kept a pet rabbit.

It was a large, white rabbit.

It looked quite cute in its cage.

Feeling bored, I walked over to the cage to play with the rabbit.

Just then, Sophia came out.
She was holding the baby and speaking to me.

“My mother actually left the baby home alone and went out. Seriously, no one was here to care for the crying child.”

Sophia had an older brother.
The old lady probably saw the baby as her ex-son-in-law’s child and didn’t want to look after it.
But leaving the baby alone at home was still irresponsible.

You never know with people these days.

I felt that Sophia had a difficult life on her own.

“What an adorable baby!”

I looked at the child in Sophia’s arms and quickly changed the subject.

I reached out with my finger to play with the baby.

It was a girl.
She had a milky, sweet scent and smiled when she saw me.

I wasn’t married and had no children of my own.
But I loved children.
Delighted, I wiggled my finger for the baby to grab.

The baby grabbed my finger and tried to put it in her mouth.

“It’s dirty!” Sophia exclaimed urgently.

I immediately remembered I had just been playing with the rabbit.
Worried about germs, I awkwardly pulled my hand back.

“I’ll just play with your big white rabbit instead.”

I squatted down again.

Sophia soothed the baby and chatted with me.
“John, I didn’t know you liked children so much. You’re such a good man.”

I said I was a very loving person and especially adored little girls.

Sophia laughed.
“Then you should find a wife and have one soon!”

“Hey, it’s not that easy. It depends on fate. Marriage isn’t simple.”

“What kind of woman are you looking for? I’ll see if I know anyone.” Sophia offered to play matchmaker.

I glanced at her.
“Someone just like you would be perfect.”

“Me? John, don’t joke. Would you really want a divorced woman?”

I worried Sophia might feel insecure about her divorce.
I quickly joked to comfort her.
“What’s wrong with being divorced? You have a car and a house. Your conditions are great. This kind of comfortable life isn’t for just anyone.”

My words made Sophia giggle.
“But I also have a child. If I married you, could you accept that?”

“Why wouldn’t I? Having a child is even better. It means I wouldn’t have to work hard. It’s called reaching the goal in one step.”

I spoke without thinking.
My words made Sophia blush.
“Then I’ll marry you.”
###Chapter 3

She avoids my gaze, her cheeks flushing instantly.

My own heart skips a beat, but I dare not respond.

Seeing my lack of reaction, disappointment flickers in her eyes.

"Oh, oh, oh..." Sophia Laurent sways gently, cradling the baby, trying to lull him to sleep.

I pretend to play with the rabbit, reaching into the cage to pet it. The rabbit retreats to the far corner, its front paws thumping the floor impatiently.

I chuckle. "The rabbit's thumping its feet. That means it's annoyed!"

Though it's just a trivial fact, Sophia shoots me an irritated glare and stops swaying. "Who are you implying that about?"

I quickly apologize. "I wasn't talking about you!"

As I speak, my gaze inadvertently drifts downward.

Sophia's face reddens. "John, what on earth are you saying?"

Just then, the baby begins to cry, probably hungry.

Sophia turns slightly to the side and lifts her shirt to nurse him.

But I can still catch glimpses of her beauty.

The baby fusses, nursing for a few moments before crying again. I watch Sophia, my focus beginning to waver.

Unable to soothe the baby, she looks to me for help.

I wash my hands and take the child. Strangely, the moment he's in my arms, his cries cease.

"He really seems to like me!"

Sophia looks at me with clear satisfaction.

Pleased, I quickly urge her to continue feeding him.

Without hesitation, she bares her breast again.

We work together to comfort the baby, creating a warm, peaceful moment.

"He listens to you. Tell him to drink more!" Sophia adores this.

I play along. "Good baby, drink more of Mommy's milk. If you don't, Uncle John will have to drink it instead!"

Sophia falls silent.

I immediately regret my inappropriate words, cringing inwardly.

After feeding, the baby falls sound asleep.

"I should head out. See you tomorrow!"

I prepare to leave, but a torrential downpour suddenly erupts outside.

The rain pours down violently, more like someone dumping buckets than mere rainfall.

"Mom just texted. She said the rain's too heavy, so she's going straight home and won't come back. Since you're taking me to the hospital tomorrow anyway, why don't you just stay the night?"

Sophia tries to persuade me to stay.

I hesitate. "Don't you have an umbrella?"

"No!" she replies firmly. I have a feeling there probably is one somewhere.

She doesn't seem to want me to leave, so I reluctantly agree to stay.

After dinner, Sophia tells me to amuse myself for a while in the living room. She says she wants to take a shower and then chat with me.

I play with the game console in her living room while she showers.

The bathroom isn't far, and the sound of running water seems to echo right beside me.

I can't concentrate on the game. My mind keeps wandering to Sophia's alluring figure.

Her body is perfect, the subject of fantasy for everyone at the company.

My throat feels parched. I could drink the entire water cooler dry.

Right then, Sophia emerges from the bathroom.

She's changed into a very seductive nightgown.

Thin and semi-transparent, it leaves little to the imagination.

I feel like slapping myself. How could her ex-husband not cherish such a beautiful woman?

"John, I wanted to discuss something with you?"

My mouth acts before my brain. "You're not looking for a new dad for the baby, are you?"

"Are you afraid?"

Her eyes fill with disappointment.

I quickly backtrack. "I meant I'd be willing! Why didn't you let me finish?"

Sophia's tears turn to laughter. "You're so funny!"

Getting back on track, I say I was just joking and ask what she really wanted to discuss.

She looks embarrassed. "John, you heard what the doctor said today, right?"

I hadn't dared forget a single word of the female doctor's advice.

"I heard."

"Okay, well, John, the thing is... I need your help."

Sophia explains she's worried. If she doesn't express the excess milk, she'll definitely get clogged ducts.

But she's divorced. She can't exactly ask her ex-husband.

So she wants my help. Of course, she doesn't expect any responsibility from me, and I shouldn't get any wrong ideas.

"John, will you help me? I wanted to ask you because I trust you during this sensitive time."

She is determined to have me be the one to assist.

Every cell in my body is buzzing with a mix of thrill and anxiety.

"I... I..."

I truly don't dare say anything careless now.

Sophia looks near tears. "You'd just watch me suffer? I'm not asking you to take responsibility. If no one helps me, I'm afraid something really bad might happen!"

The doctor said today that Sophia already has lumps. If it gets worse, she might need surgery.

Health is serious. There's no room for carelessness.

I grit my teeth. "Alright, I'll help you. But... I'm really not trying to take advantage! Please don't think poorly of me."

Whether I want to is one thing, but stating my intentions is another.

Hearing this, Sophia is delighted. "Let's go into the bedroom then. The living room feels too strange for this."

"Let's go."
###Chapter 4

Sophia Laurent took my hand and led me into a bedroom.

Alone with a woman, my breathing became unsteady.

Sophia slowly untied her robe and opened her nightgown.

We faced each other, both too embarrassed to speak first.

I broke the silence. "I hope you don't mind."

"Don't say that. I'm the one who should be sorry. Asking you to help with something like this. It might not taste very good, I've heard."

She was right. It didn't taste as good as I imagined.

But I took this task seriously. I had to complete it properly.

After I finished, Sophia watched me intently.

I looked up and saw the clear suggestion in her expression.

With such a woman before me, staying calm was impossible. Her pale skin made me restless.

"Sophia, why don't you stay here tonight? Sleep in my room."

"I have to take care of the baby..."

She shook her head shyly. I grabbed her small hand, wanting to pull her into my arms.

"Later then... If necessary, we can go to your room. I'll help with the baby."

My breath warmed her face, making her blush deeper.

She resisted, never making the sound I hoped to hear.

"It wouldn't be good for the baby to see."

"He's still so small..."

"Even small children remember things!"

Just then, Sophia heard her baby waking.

"John, let me settle him first. I'll come find you later."

She stood and returned to her room.

I couldn't sleep all night.

The baby kept crying, perhaps because of a stranger in the house.

Sophia never came back. The crying kept me awake too.

We both looked exhausted the next morning.

"Time to get the test results."

I planned to go alone, but Sophia looked anxious. "I want to come. My mother will be here soon. We can go together."

She insisted on going, so we waited for her mother.

Her mother arrived half an hour later.

She seemed impatient. "I have to look after your brother's son. My grandson needs me. Hurry to the hospital and come back quickly."

I greeted her. "Mrs. Laurent."

She frowned at me. "Who are you?"

"I'm Sophia's colleague. Just helping with the drive."

"Oh, the driver. Is your company big? Good salary?"

I said no.

She raised her voice. "Then what's the point of this worthless job? Quit and stay home with the baby. At least you won't starve."

I never expected Sophia's mother to be like this.

She clearly wanted Sophia home for childcare, so she could focus on her grandson.

Sophia came downstairs, eyes red. "Mom, I'm going to the hospital. I'll be back soon."

I drove Sophia to the hospital.

She talked during the ride. She valued her independence, but her mother's attitude made her consider quitting.

"My mother is already upset with me. I don't want to trouble her further."

Sophia had some savings. Her mother wanted to borrow money for Sophia's brother, but Sophia refused. It caused tension.

I found the situation ridiculous. What kind of people were these?

At the hospital, Sophia grew restless waiting for the results. "What if something's wrong? My baby is so young. No one will care for him!"

I felt angry. "I'll help you care for him. Don't worry about that."

I gave her courage.

She finally felt brave enough to check the results.

The technician brought the scans. Sophia asked many questions.

"This lump here appears to be a tumor."

Hearing this, Sophia panicked.

"John, what should I do?"

She gripped my hand tightly.

"Sophia, I'm here. Be brave. I'll go in with you."

I held her hand and led her into the doctor's office.
###Chapter 5
Fortunately, after a thorough examination, the female doctor declared Sophia Laurent perfectly healthy.
"It's nothing serious. This isn't a tumor. It will disappear soon. Just maintain a light diet."
Sophia was overjoyed.
I drove her back home.
"Having you with me was wonderful. Thank you, John."
We stood at her doorstep, about to part ways.
Strangely, I felt a twinge of reluctance and concern for her.
"Well..."
"Yes?"
"Nothing. I should head back." I waved and addressed her mother. "Goodbye, Mrs. Laurent."
She ignored me, listlessly pushing the stroller on the lawn.
Leaving Sophia's house, I longed to talk with her a bit longer.
Outside, a street vendor sold children's toys. I smacked my forehead. "That's it!"
I returned using the excuse of meeting the baby for the first time and bringing a gift.
Sophia was probably resting at home.
Eagerly, I approached to knock. Just then, I saw Mrs. Laurent scolding the child impatiently on the lawn.
The baby cried. She yelled, "Stop your crying! Don't you see I'm exhausted?"
"Keep crying, and I'll spank you!"
I was horrified. As I moved to intervene, she grabbed the baby's tiny arm and delivered a harsh slap.
The infant wailed even louder.
Damn it!
I instantly saw red. I rushed over and snatched the stroller away.
"Mrs. Laurent, what are you doing? The child is so small. Why would you hit her?"
Heart aching, I held the baby, soothing her gently.
Mrs. Laurent clearly didn't expect my sudden return. Cornered, she had no defense.
"Who asked you to meddle? Why are you back anyway?"
I retorted that if I hadn't returned, I would have missed this.
"Your heart is truly cruel. Not only do you show favoritism, but you also harm a child. If you didn't want to care for her, you should have said so!"
I can't stand such injustice and spoke bluntly.
Mrs. Laurent argued fiercely, refusing to back down.
Sophia came out. Her mother played the victim first, accusing me of slander and claiming I misunderstood.
I stated coldly, "You know exactly what you did. If this weren't a family matter, I would have called the police."
"Sweetheart, look what Uncle brought you!" I took out the toy and comforted the baby.
Mrs. Laurent threw a tantrum, sobbing about never being so wronged. She shouted a stream of insults, then stormed off, vowing never to return.
I smiled wryly at Sophia. "If I hadn't seen it myself, she might have bruised the child. She hit her hard!"
To my surprise, Sophia's face turned icy. "Why did you provoke my mother? This is none of your business."
I was completely stunned.
###Chapter 6

Back home, I apologized to Sophia.
"I'm sorry for being impulsive. But the child was truly hit."
"Look at her wrist if you don't believe me. It's still red."

After a moment, Sophia spoke.
"It's fine. But please don't come here again."
"Because... I'm afraid it upsets my mother."

I knew it. I had messed things up.

But at the company, Sophia and I still saw each other.
We talked and laughed as usual.

I often asked Sophia for her phone to see pictures of the child.
We remained quite close.

Recently, Sophia hired a nanny.
Her mother stopped coming over.

Seeing how devoted I was to the child, Sophia joked,
"Maybe you should take my daughter home for a few days."
"You seem to adore her so much!"

I laughed it off but didn't entertain any further ideas.

Not long after, Sophia took leave from work.
She said she was going on a trip.

I messaged her on WhatsApp.
"Feeling so relaxed? Getting away is good."
"Who are you going with? A new boyfriend?"

My tone was slightly bitter.

Sophia replied, "With my mother, my brother, and his wife!"

On her Instagram feed, I saw Mrs. Laurent pushing Sophia's child.
Her brother and sister-in-law were smiling brightly.
But not a single glance was directed toward Sophia's daughter.

The more I looked, the more uneasy I felt.
My sixth sense told me something was wrong.

How could Sophia dare to leave her child with her mother again?

Unable to rest, I took emergency leave.
I booked a flight to Sophia's vacation destination.

After arriving, I quickly found Sophia's hotel.
I spent days secretly observing them.

After a few days, I noticed something suspicious.
When Sophia was present, her mother and relatives were all smiles.
The moment she stepped away, their expressions changed.

The little girl was left alone in her stroller.
No one paid her any attention.
They were all focused on the grandson.

But Sophia couldn't watch the child every single moment.
She eventually needed to use the restroom...

I followed them discreetly into a shopping mall.

They emerged with numerous shopping bags.
Suddenly, Sophia felt unwell.

"Mom, please watch the baby. I need to use the restroom."

"Go ahead," her mother said with a warm smile.
The moment Sophia left, her expression darkened.

"This child is so annoying. She'll ruin our family harmony sooner or later."

After saying this, Mrs. Laurent gave the stroller a hard push.
It rolled straight toward the busy street.
###Chapter 7

If you called it an accident, all three of them remained completely unfazed.

Watching the heavy traffic, I suddenly felt a surge of courage from nowhere.

I lunged forward and grabbed the stroller.

The entire Laurent family was stunned.

"You..."

"Oh my, I was tired and lost my grip!"

"I saw you let go on purpose! You were trying to kill the child!"

I was so furious I wanted to slap her.

Just then, Sophia came out.

Her mother immediately resorted to her old tricks, throwing a tantrum and accusing me of having ulterior motives, of following them to snatch the child.

Sophia was utterly bewildered. "Why are you here? What's going on?"

I didn't care what Sophia thought. I blurted out everything I had seen. "Call the police. We must call the police this time."

Hearing I wanted to call the police, Mrs. Laurent was taken aback. "Who do you think you are to call the police?"

"I'm a concerned citizen doing the right thing!"

The police arrived shortly after.

They reviewed the surveillance footage. It clearly showed Mrs. Laurent letting go intentionally.

This time, Sophia was heartbroken. "Last time I saw the red marks on the baby's wrist. Why? Why are you so cruel to my child? You're my mother!"

"Exactly because I'm your mother! You have so much money now. Instead of giving it to your brother, you're saving it for this child. Don't you know your brother's son is the true heir of our family!"

She was cursing and yelling as the police took her away.

I doubt she even understood the consequences of her actions.

I comforted Sophia. "Don't be sad. Thankfully we discovered it in time. We will protect the child."

Sophia buried her face in my chest, her tears soaking my shirt.
