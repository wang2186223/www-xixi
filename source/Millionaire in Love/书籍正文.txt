"Emily, We do it again?"

A deep, raspy voice whispered in Emily Johnson's ear. She was pressed up against the French window, her desire making her eyes red and her moans all jumbled up.

James Smith's hot body was all over her. He nibbled on her earlobe and chuckled. "If you don't speak, I'll take it as you agree, let medo you a thousand more times!"

Emily's mind was a blur, feeling like she was melting into a puddle, barely able to stand.

If James wasn't holding her up, she'd be on the floor by now.

After two years together, James knew her body better than she did. Every touch and caress hit her most sensitive spots just right.

James was incredible, a force of nature in bed, but his insatiable appetite left Emily breathless and utterly spent.

But James leaned in, buried his head in her neck, and wrapped his arms around her waist.

"Emily, how was my performance today? Was it good?" Exhausted, Emily wanted to snap back, but her throat was dry. She just tried to push James away. As soon as she reached out, James grabbed her wrist, and she felt something cool between her fingers. Emily paused, looking down to see a diamond ring.

The ring was simple but elegant, fitting her perfectly, and the diamond was huge, at least ten carats. It sparkled brilliantly in the light.

Emily stared at the ring. After a few seconds, she raised an eyebrow. "You're really generous."

James smiled and hugged her. "Do you like it?"


"It's nice."

Emily replied casually, taking off the ring."Want me to help your future girlfriend try it on?"

James's face changed instantly. "No, L.."

"Let's end this." Emily cut him off before he could finish.

She already guessed what James was going to say when she saw the ring.Unfortunately, Emily had a husband.

Three years ago, Emily had a one-night stand with James.

She started seeing James because her new husband was cheating with her sister. To get back at him, she kept James as her lover.

Emily pulled out a document from her bag, along with the ring, and placed them in front of James. "This house is yours, and I've sorted out the paperwork. Consider it a thank you for the past few years."

As she said this, Emily felt a bit sad.

It wasn't easy finding someone like James. He was great in bed and took care of her feelings. Plus, he was exactly her type.

But Emily didn't want to get too attached, and she was planning to go


back home, so she had to say goodbye to James.

As she turned to find her clothes. James grabbed her hand.


"Emily."

There was a pained look in James's eyes, his voice hoarse.


"Do you want to break up with me?"

Without looking back, Emily said calmly, "Yes, my husband is back. We're
done, let's just pretend it never happened."

James's grip loosened, and Emily pulled her hand away.

His voice changed instantly. "Husband is just an excuse, you want to drive me away like this?"

Emily had never heard James speak so coldly before.

His whole demeanor changed, his dark eyes icy, sending chills down her spine.

"If you think it's not enough, I'll throw in another million," Emily said,trying to hide her unease. She quickly got dressed and walked out without looking back.

She never glanced back at James the whole time.

Emily boarded her flight back home, staring out the window at the clouds and sighing.

A week ago, her sister Veda Johnson called, saying she and John Williams were coming back home.

On the phone, Veda sounded weak and timid, saying she wanted to see
Emily. She admitted it was her fault for messing up Emily and John's
relationship and now wanted to give John back to Emily.

Emily found it all pretty ironic. When she was just a newborn,she was accidentally taken home by the wrong family from the hospital. It wasn't until she was ten years old that she was finally reunited with the Johnson family.

Emily was thrilled to finally find her real family.

But Mrs. Johnson's first words to Emily were that the switch with Veda wasn't Veda's fault.

The second thing she said was that for the past ten years, they had treated Veda as their own daughter and asked Emnily to be generous and not drive Veda away.

Between Emily and Veda, everyone always chose Veda, including John.who had already proposed to Emily.

Emily once asked John if he wanted to cancel the engagement and marry Veda instead. If that was the case, she could let go gracefully,even if it hurt.

John stayed silent for a long time before saying the engagement wasn't canceled.


But on the wedding day, Veda called John. She cried and said she couldn't live without him and had cut her wrist, hoping to see him one last time before she died.


Without a second thought, John didn't even change out of his groom's suit and left.


John got his love, but made Emily the laughingstock of the entire Emerald City.
As her thoughts wandered. Emily arrived at the address Veda had sent her.which turned out to be the place where she and John had held their wedding.How ironic.

Emily pushed open the door of the private room and saw Veda standing by the balcony.

"Veda."

Veda looked haggard and pale, staring at Emily and murmuring. "Why?"

Emily frowned, unable to hear clearly. "What are you saying? Just spit it out."


Emily had come here to divorce Johin and had no time to waste on Veda.

Tears welled up in Veda's eyes, and she spoke pitifully. "Emily, I really like John. Can you please let mne have him? I know I wronged you in the past, and I'll do my best to make it up to you in the future."

Emily almost laughed. Veda, the other woman, was openly declaring her love to Emily.

With a mocking smile, Emily said softly, "If I could be as shameless as you,I would have had kids with John long ago."


Hearing this, tears streamed down Veda's face, her body trembling slightly."But John said he doesn't love you at all. Even if you stay together,you won't be happy. I'm doing this for your own good. After you divorce John,you can find new love. Isn't that good?"

Emily was incredulous. "What nonsense are you talking about?"

It turned out Veda had called Emily over to get her to divorce John.

Of course, she had to divorce him. But she couldn't let Veda,this hypocritical two-faced person, get away with it. Emily was too lazy to stay and listen to Veda's nonsense,so she turned around to leave.

Suddenly, Emily's hand was tightly grabbed by someone.
###Chapter 2

Emily spun around and locked eyes with Veda's nasty glare.

"Let go!"

Emily tried to yank her hand back, but Veda leaned in close, whispering just loud enough for Emily to hear, "If I can't have him, neither can you!"

A wave of dread washed over Emily, and before she could react, Veda jumped!

Emily lunged to grab her, but she was too late. Her fingers just grazed Veda's clothes as she watched her fall helplessly.

Then, a furious voice boomed behind her. "Emily!"

She turned to see John storming towards her, his face twisted with anger."How could you be so cruel? Do you even know Veda's pregnant?"

Emily was stunned for a moment, thena smirk crept onto her face.

"Your kid?" she asked, though she already knew the answer from John's reaction.

Emily sighed, shrugged off John's hand, and looked him over.

John's sharp suit highlighted his tall, lean frame and chiseled features,giving him an air of elegance. But right now, his forehead veins were popping, his lips pressed into a thin line, his handsome face contorted with rage, and his eyes blazing as he glared at Emily . Emily had once loved John, dreaming of a future together.
But now,she no longer loves. "I didn't push Veda. She jumped," Emily said calmly,meeting John's icy stare.

John's chest heaved with fury. "You think I'll believe that?"

"Believe what you want," Emily replied with a cold sneer.

Veda was rushed to the operating room,and it was over two hours before the doctor emerged.


"The patient is out of immediate danger," the doctor sighed. "But sadly,the baby couldn't be saved."

John's face twisted in disbelief. "No way!"

He turned on Emily, his eyes filled with rage. "Are you happy now?! I told you, everything was my fault, not Veda's! If you want revenge,come at me, not her innocent child!"

Even though Emily no longer loves John, the words he spoke still deeply affected her, causing an uncontrollable discomfort in her heart.

Their marriage had been arranged by John's grandfather, Hayden Williams.

When Emily first came back to the Johnson family, everything felt strange.Her father, Aiden Johnson, and mother, Mia Wilson, were busy comforting Veda, assuring her that she was still their favorite, even with Emily's return. Emily was naturally pushed aside. Even at Emily's birthday party, Veda wore a stunning princess dress,surrounded by Aiden and Mia as they cut the cake, while Emily stood alone in a corner. Then, a clear, bright voice broke through her solitude. "Why are you by yourself?" Back then, John was already a tall, handsome teenager. He didn't care about Emily's lack of favor in the Johnson family. He showed her fireworks,took her to the amusement park, and gave her all the love she craved.

Emily had always wished she could give Veda everything-everything except John. But in the end, even John chose Veda.


Emily clenched her fists so tight her nails dug into her palms, the sharp pain forcing her to stay calm. She looked up, meeting John's gaze with a cool stare.


"Veda jumped on her own. Why would I hurt her child?" A mocking smile tugged at Emily's lips. "Why don't you ask Veda why she suddenly came back from abroad to confront me?"


John's face darkened, his eyes flashing with anger. "Do you have the nerve to bring that up?"

He gritted his teeth. "If it weren't for you spreading rumors to Grandpa Hayden, who then wanted to kick me out of the family and strip me of my shares, I wouldn't have come back."

John's disgust was clear on his handsome face.

He knew Emily. She had framed Veda before, and now she was using grandpa Hayden to force him back. He had already given Emily the nominal identity of a wife, but she still wasn't satisfied! John's voice grew colder, "Emily, no matter what you do, I won't give up on Veda! When you and Veda were switched at the hospital, it wasn't her fault. She was just a baby. I know you had a tough time growing up,but you're back-with the Johnsons now. Why can't you let go of the past? Why do you have to hold onto it?" Hearing this, Emily felt a chill run through her. "And Veda has felt guilty for you all these years. She's even willing to stay by my side and have this child without being Mrs. Williams. What more do you want?"


John's eyes were cold and fierce, his voice loud. "I'm the one who should apologize to you. If you want revenge, take it out on me, not her innocent child!"

Emily pressed her temples and smiled. She had explained countless times that she didn't bully Veda, but no one believed her. She was done arguing.

"You're right. I should come at you."

With that, she stepped forward, grabbed John's collar, and slapped him hard! The sound echoed down the hospital corridor.

John was caught off guard,his face snapping to the side from the slap.

He seemed stunned, taking several seconds to recover, then he was furious.
"Are you crazy? How dare you hit me?!"

Emily shook her wrist, which was numb from the impact, and raised an eyebrow. "Isn't that what you wanted?"


Surprisingly,it felt pretty good. She even wanted to slap him again.

John's anger flared. He was about to speak when his phone vibrated. It was a call from grandpa Hayden.

Hayden's voice was stern. "I heard you're back in the country?"

Grandpa Hayden said in a deep voice, "You immediately take Emily back home,remember,bring Emily with you. If it's just you alone, then you will never set foot in the Williams Mansion's doors again!"

With that, Grandpa Hayden hung up the phone directly.

John's temples bulged with anger, his gaze full of intense mockery directed at Emily, "Do you think having Grandpa as your supporter will make me change my mind and fall in love with you again?"
###Chapter 3

Emily chuckled. "Wow, you're full of yourself. Take a good look in the mirror and tell me, what exactly do you think is worth me holding onto? I'm not into guys who cheat."


John was pissed but didn't let Emily's words get to him. He knew she had a crush on him since they were kids. Now she was just playing hard to get,acting like she didn't care.

John said coolly, "Congrats. Hayden wants me to bring you back."

Emily didn't want to go back, but Hayden had always been good to her,treating her like his own granddaughter. Even though she was in her twenties now, Hayden still saw her as the litle girl he doted on. He always thought of her first when it came to good thigs.

In the end, Emily and John got in the car heading back to the Williams Mansion, and John made sure to keep his distance from her.

Emily didn't mind. On the way back, she even picked up some of Hayden's favorite snacks.

As soon as she walked into the Williams Mansion, she heard Hayden's angry voice coming from the living room. "Do you have any idea how much gossip and rumors Emily has had to put up with these past three years? Do you know what people are saying behind her back?"

John stood tall, his voice cold. "If she can't handle it anymore, she can always choose to divorce."


Hayden was about to blow a gasket.

Emily pushed the door open and called out, "Hayden." She walked right past John and took Hayden's arm affectionately. "Don't get mad. The doctor said your blood pressure had been high lately."

Hayden patted Emily's hand, a hint of guilt in his eyes. "It's John's fault for being unfaithful. I'm sorry, Emily."

Tears welled up in Emily's eyes. Compared to Aiden and Mia, Hayden felt more like family to her.

Hayden looked at John again and said firmly, "I only recognize Emily as your wife, John. As for any other women, don't even think about bringing them into the Williams Mansion!"

John's expression darkened. But before he could say anything, Hayden waved his hand dismissively. "I know about Veda being pregnant, but that illegitimate child will only bring trouble. If you have any conscience left,tell Veda to get an abortion as soon as possible!"

Hayden didn't know that Veda had already had a miscarriage, but his tone left no room for negotiation.

John called out, "Grandpa!"

John gritted his teeth and glared at Emily. "This is what you wanted,right?



Emily had acted all noble before, but now she was using Grandpa Hayden to put pressure on him! After three years apart, she had gotten a lot more cunning! From the moment Emily walked in until now, her gaze finally settled on John. John had want ed to accuse Emily of playing dirty tricks, but when he met her calm and indifferent eyes, he suddenly couldn't say a word.

"It's okay, Hayden."

Emily stopped Hayden without any emotion. "Since Mr. John Williams is so set on divorcing, I shouldn't stand in the way. Of course, I should help him get what he wants."

John stiffened, noticing the change in Emily's attitude and the way she addressed him.

When Emily first came back to the Johnson family, she was always timid,calling him John Wlliams in a soft voice. Later, as she grew up and Hayden arranged their marriage, Emily started calling him John. Every time she said his name, it was like she was holding something precious.

Suppressing his sudden irritation, he said, "You know Hayden won't let me divorce you, so you're just saying this to mess with me!"

Emily rolled her eyes, not even trying to hide it.

She shot back, "Wow, you're really full of yourself. Seems like the only thing you've gotten better at over the years is boosting your own ego."

John's face darkened. Emily had never talked to him like this before.

He was about to retort when Hayden cut in. Hayden spoke slowly, "Divorce is fine. But in these three years,Emily has suffered a lot because of your nonsense. If you divorce, the shares of the Williams Group under your name will go to Emily." John was stunned and furious. "Grandpa Hayden !" Before he could say more, his phone buzzed. It was a call from the hospital.

The caregiver's voice was frantic. "Mr. John Williams, something's wrong!Ms. Veda found out she lost her baby and is extremely upset. She's threatening to jump off the building. You need to come quickly!"

John's face went pale. He hung up and turned to leave.

Hayden didn't catch the details of the call, but he could guess it was about Veda from John's reaction.

His face turned red with anger, and he slammed his cane on the floor."Stop right there!"

John paused but didn't turn around. "Hayden, Veda needs me. And I'm set on the divorce. I'll come back to apologize after I handle this."

With that,he stormed out.

Hayden was fuming, breathing heavily. Emily quickly helped him sit down and brought him some honey water to calm him.

Hayden asked, "Emily, have you really thought this through?"

Once Hayden calmed down, his voice was full of concern. "If it's because of Veda, don't worry. As long as I'm here, she won't cause any trouble."

Emily smiled and patted Hayden's back. "It's not about Veda,It's about John not having feelings for me. There's no point in holding on and becoming a joke."

Hayden knew Emily had made up her mind. He sighed deeply,his shoulders slumping. "My Williams family has wronged you!"

"Not at all. I'm truly grateful for your care and love. Even if John and Iwere to divorce, you'll always be my grandfather."

Emily smiled brightly, acting like everything was fine. "Don't worry; I'll be okay."

After comforting Hayden and having dinner with him, Emily left the Williams Mansion. As soon as she started the car, her phone rang. It was Mia Mother.

Emily looked at the screen with a hint of irony. It had to be about Veda.

It was laughable. Emily had been married to John for three years, and Mia had never called her once. Now Mia was calling to blame her for Veda.

Emily answered the call casually.

Mia's angry voice came through immediately. "Emily! How could I have raised such an ungrateful person like you? You used such dirty tricksto hurt Veda! The doctor said Veda injured her uterus and might never get pregnant again!"

Emily leaned back in the driver's seat, her expression calm. "That's good."

Mia was stunned for a moment, then exploded. "What did you say?"

Emily replied with a hint of sarcasm, "I said it's good. With the way Veda behaves, if she had a kid, it would probably inherit her deceitful and hypocritical nature."

“Isn't that right, my good mother?”
After a moment of silence, Emily realized that most luxury brands were foreign, and Diamond Glow was only famous locally. Hayden was hinting at going global. Hayden said, "So this time, we have to nail the deal with Golden Birch
###Chapter 4
Mia was still grumbling, but Emily had already hung up the phone.

Because of John's crazy antics, the Williams family showered Emily with gifts every year-houses, cars, jewelry, you name it.

John's parents treated Emily better than her own folks. Her favorite spot was the place at Scarlet Leaf Riverside.

The massive French windows gave a killer view of the Emerald River that cut through the city, especially stunning when the city lights lit up at night.

The next morning, Emily headed back to the office for the usual morning meeting as the design department director.

She didn't expect Hayden, who hadn't shown up at the company for almost half a year, to make an appearance.

Hayden called Emily into the office, where John was also there, looking pretty ticked off.

Ignoring John, Emily plopped down on the sofa next to Hayden and asked softly, "Hayden, what brings you here all of a sudden?"

Hayden patted Emily's hand and said gently, "I came to take care of some business. Even though our Diamond Glow brand is high-end in the market,we haven't gone international yet."


Group. This way, we can break into the foreign market and connect with the elite in Starry Capital, making future collaborations a breeze."

Golden Birch Group had its own mining sources, and many jewelry manufacturers were competing to cooperate with them. Their overseas sales channels were unique, and they were also into various sectors like gaming,video platforms, and real estate, all top-notch.

John frowned and said, "Hayden, there are already thousands of jewelry companies keen on partnering with Golden Birch Group,plus some foreign luxury brands. It's going to be super tough for us to land a partnership."

Golden Birch Group had shot to fame five years ago and was now at the top. No one had ever seen the CEO of Golden Birch Group.

Hayden said seriously, "If we can get his approval, there won't be any problems."

Emily asked,"Who?"

Hayden replied,"James Smith."

Emily was stunned. There were tons of people with that name, and James was just a bartender. It was hard to linkhim to the prestigious Mr. Smith.

But with his devilishly handsome looks and a bit more formal attire,he did have a touch of nobility.

Less than a day after parting ways, Emily was surprised to find herself missing James.

She realized that if it were before, James would have already flirted with her on Facebook. But today, there was still no message from him. Emily sighed, listening to Hayden and John's conversation.

John asked, "Hayden, are you talking about the son of the Smith family,who ranks in the top five of the rich list?"

Hayden nodded. "That's him."

John sighed. "But he's so elusive. It's really tough to meet him."

Emily's eyes flickered. The gap between the Williams Family and someone like James was huge. Even if they knew where he was, he might not want to meet them.

Hayden smiled. "James is in Emerald City right now. His grandmother,Amelia Martinez, is from here. She's been in town for half a month for a ceremony. Tomorrow is her seventieth birthday, and the party's at the Elegant Orchid Garden on Wind Whisper Mountain, with all the city's elites attending."

"We've got two invites." Hayden pulled out the invitations and handed them to John and Emily.

Emily opened hers and saw the fancy, elegant font on the invite.She wanted to give it back to Hayden and whispered, "Hayden, I don't think this is for me."

She rarely went to such big events. Since she was a kid, Mia always thought Emily lacked the grace of an elite family. Whenever there was a party, Mia only took Veda along.

Over time, Emily grew to hate such noisy occasions. After al1,the Johnson family never acknowledged her in public.

Hayden gently patted Emily's hand and said, "Don't worry. You're the best designer. You can go with John, and he'll look after you. Also,get a gift for Amelia. If you can befriend James,great. If not, at least you'll know him."


With Hayden's encouragement, Emily nodded.

John scoffed, "I don't want to go with her."

Hayden glared at him. "Then Emily can go with someone else. Plenty of people want to attend the banquet."

John was momentarily speechless. He was eager to make connections with such top-tier elites.

After Hayden left, Emily was about to leave the office but was stopped by John.

Emily furrowed her brows. "John, don't block my way."

John's brows furrowed deeply as he stared at her intently. "Hayden asked me to have a child with you. How could he suddenly have such an idea?What did you tell Hayden?"

Emily's eyes darkened slightly. Hayden probably just wanted to strengthen the bond between them.

"Having a child with you is too disgusting. I will clarify things with Hayden." As she tried to leave, John grabbed her wrist again. "Emily, stop playing tricks in front of me. Even if Veda can't have children in the future,you won't be able to bear the descendants of the Williams family!" Emily glanced at John and smiled. "John, honestly, with your genes for infidelity, I wouldn't dare to have a child with you."

John's face turned red with anger. "If it weren't for you, Veda..."

Emily cut him off directly. "What about me and Veda? Veda took my parents and my husband. Whatever happens to Veda, she brought it on herself. Don't go saying the baby switch isn't her fault. Veda has enjoyed over a decade of wealth, glory, and love. I have never wronged her."

Why did everyone want her to yield to Veda? Emily wasn't the one in the wrong; on the contrary, she was the only victim in this situation.

In fact, after three years, Emily no longer had any feelings for John. There were plenty of men around. If John didn't behave, she could easily find another.

At that moment, a message popped up on Emily's Facebook:

[Emily, where are you now? Are you free tonight?]
###Chapter 5

John shot a glance her way, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "So, did you snag a boyfriend to keep you company while I was gone for three years?You cut ties with him for me, but you claim you don't care about me?Really? Anyway, Emily, I'll never like you."

Emily rolled her eyes. John wasn't just confident anymore; he's turned into a narcissist.

A sly smile spread across Emily's face, her eyes twinkling with mischief,exuding a siren's charm. For a moment, John was spellbound by her allure.

Emily's red lips curled into a grin. "John, even though I found a lover,I'd still be more upstanding than you."

She shoved John aside and walked out, phone in hand. Once outside, she checked her messages.

[Emily,divorce him.]

[Emily,tell me your location.]

[Emily, I'm coming to find you!]

A flood of messages made Emily's head spin. She raised an eyebrow,her smile widening. She loved messing with James.

Every time they met at the hotel, she would tease James, loving the way he took the initiative to make love with her. It always made her day. Emily typed back with a grin: [My family wants me to have a kid with him to keep the marriage going. What should I do?] Within seconds,James called.

"Emily, I won't let that happen!" he growled, but to Emily, he sounded more like a sulking child.

"James, even if you don't want it, we're done. How about I give you two more properties? You can collect the rent."

Emily spoke like she was soothing a child, already thinking about which properties to hand over.

"Emily Johnson, how dare you! Do you even know who I am..."

It was the first time Emily heard James so angry. Usually, he'd nibble on her ear and call her honey.

Emily was quite amused. "Alright, no more demands, or I'll get mad."


"Then I'll go and castrate your husband."

After James's threat, Emily paused for a moment, then chuckled. "You're something else,aren't you?"

Just as she was about to compliment James, John walked out of the office.She hung up,ignoring James's fury on the other end.

Working in the same company made their encounters super awkward.

Ignoring John, Emily headed back to the design department. There wasn't much work there; once the dlesigns were approved, they moved on to production. The next day, since she had a birthday banquet to attend, Emily left work early to get her makeup done at home. After more than two hours, John barged in, impatiently urging her to hurry up.

Then he saw Emily in a long red satin dress with a hollow back and a cinched waist, looking like an ethereal fairy. Every move she made was mesmerizing.

John frowned, his cold tone softening a bit. "Hurry up, we're running late."

Even though John didn't like Emily, he had to admit she was stunning.

The slit of her dress reached her thighs, with golden thread embroidered cloud patterns on the hem, shimmering and highlighting her long legs.

John's eyes darkened slightly as he scoffed. "Red doesn't suit you. You look like a hooker."

Emily clicked her tongue and rolled her eyes. "If you can't appreciate it,then gouge your eyes out."

She continued adjusting her dress in front of the mirror. Her slender waist,long hair cascading down her chest, and a smirk on her red lips exuded all kinds of allure.

John couldn't tear his eyes away from her. Back in school, he often heard the guys talking about Emily, making alI sorts of crude jokes.

Turns out, those jokes had some truth to them; Emily definitely knew how to turn heads. With a dismissive wave, John said, "Emily, I've told you, I'm not having a kid with you. Your little seduction game isn't gonna work. I'll be waiting in the car." John left, lit a cigarette in the car, feeling a bit on edge. A few minutes later,Emily slid into the back seat.

Wind Whisper Mountain's Elegant Orchid Garden

This place was something else, the whole mountain was privately owned.It was the Smith family's turf.

When they got to the Elegant Orchid Garden, the place was packed with luxury cars. All the big shots of Emerald City were there.

The garden was like something out of a fairy tale, with lush trees and exotic flowers. Emily only recognized the orchids.

Looking around, the rare flowers and plants were perfectly arranged, with gardeners on standby.

Each orchid was worth a cool twenty million dollars, and growing that many took some serious cash.

Emily was starting to get why the Smith family was the richest in the country.

The long corridor was designed like a flower hall, each step revealing a new view,giving off an understated yet extravagant vibe.

A staff member led them into the banquet hall. All the furniture was top-notch, the room filled with a pleasant fragrance. Even the cups on the tables were antiques. Emily had seen a lot of fancy stuff, but this place still blew her away. "So many elites from Emerald City are here." "The mayor and military reps are here too." "The top ten elite families are all present. The Smith family really knows how to make an impression."

People were in awe of the Smith family's wealth.

Emily found her seat. Everyone there wanted to cozy up to the Smith family. If she went over now, she might get laughed at.

"Emily, why don't you go and meet Mrs. Amelia Smith?"

It was Hayden's good friend, Christopher Taylor, talking to her. Despite his age, he looked spry.

He took Emily's hand and led her forward, saying, "Even if you don't win her over, at least give her the gift first."

Emily blinked helplessly but followed Christopher.

Weaving through the crowd, they saw Mia and Veda standing next to Amelia.

Veda smiled at Amelia, saying, "Mrs. Smith, this perfume is a new product from Cassia,suitable for all ages, valued at nine million dollars."

Amelia just smiled. "You're very thoughtful."

Cassiax was a new brand from a few years ago, known for its fragrances with a hint of herbal scent, refreshing and uplifting.

It quickly became a hit in elite circles worldwide. Veda wanted Amelia to try it, but just then, Amelia's butler interrupted."Mrs. Smith, the Williams family has arrived." Amelia looked up, and Emily stepped forward, offering a gentle smile." Mrs. Smith, happy birthday. This is the gift I prepared for you."

Emily took out the gift and handed it to Amelia.

Veda glanced over. "Are you giving Mrs. Smith a tattered scarf?"
###Chapter 6

Veda's voice cut through the air, dripping with disdain as she eyed the scarf in Emily's hand.

Amelia didn't say a word, just picked it up slowly. The scarf was made of silk thread, with totally different designs on each side.

One side featured exotic roses, while the other showcased the Elegant Orchid Garden.

Emily had found the image of the Elegant Orchid Garden online, so it wasn't perfect, but the Wind Whisper Mountain was embroidered beautifully.

Amelia's eyes lit up with surprise. "Did you make this yourself?"she asked.

Emily nodded calmly. "Yes, Mrs. Smith. My skills are a bit rough; I hope you don'tmind."

Veda laughed. "Emily, do you have no respect at all for Mrs. Smith? How dare you give her something so shabby! Is the Williams family broke?"

Veda's jab gave Emily a bit of a headache.

John frowned,clearly annoyed. He grabbed Emily's arm and whispered,"We need to impress the Smith family. If you're short on cash, just tell me."

Giving a homemade scarf as a gift was definitely not up to par. John's eyes were full of contempt. Veda kept going, "Maybe Emily's clueless about what makes a decent gift because she grew up in the sticks. Mrs. Smith, please don't take it personally; Emily didn't mean any harm." That was a real slap in the face for Emily, but she kept her cool.

Everyone around was watching, whispering about Emily and Veda.

"Who's Mia's real daughter?"

"The one raised outside is the real daughter. Mia thinks she can't present herself well, so she's never been introduced."

Veda was the queen bee of Emerald City, with a top-notch family,education, and a boyfriend who'd ditch his new wife for her. Every move she made was gossip gold.

Emily didn't pay attention to the chatter. She'd long given up on her parents.

Whether she was a Johnson or not, Emily was her own person.

"Grandma, I really like this scarf. My girlfriend's a fashion designer, and she'd love it. Can I have it?" The young man next to Amelia reached for the fan.

Amelia lightly slapped his hand away, annoyed. "Emily gave this to me,and I really like it."

A hint of nostalgia flickered in her eyes.

Veda was taken aback. "Mrs. Smith, it's just a scarf. What's the big deal?" Emily looked at her calmly and explained to Amelia, "Mrs. Smith, I know you haven't been back in over ten years. Your grandmother was a master at making embroidered fans. My skills aren't as good as hers,but I hope it brings you some comfort." The birthday party came up fast. All Emily could do was whip up this simple scarf overnight. She hadn't even thought about other gifts.

Given the Smith family's status, the guests wouldn't bring anything tacky.

Behind Amelia, a mountain of gifts had already piled up. Emily glanced at Veda again. "Veda, not everything's about money. Ever heard of silk scarf?"

Veda scoffed. "Is that supposed to be valuable? If you're too cheap to buy a real gift, just say so. No need for the fancy excuses."

Veda's disdain was palpable. Emily used to love making silk with intricate designs back at the Johnson family, and Veda would often ruin her work.

She couldn't stand Emily's goody-two-shoes act. Emily had grown up in the countryside, but she never had that rough-around-the-edges vibe.

"Is this the best the Johnson family could raise? She doesn't even know what an silk scarf is."


"These silk scarf are high-end crafts. Emily can't pull off these intricate designs without putting in at least fifteen years of practice."


The folks at the birthday bash were all top-tier elites in Emerald City, so they knew their stuff.

Amelia ignored Veda, her face showing clear annoyance.

The butler noticed and said to Veda, "Ms. Veda Johnson, you're being too loud.Please keep it down." Veda felt a wave of embarrassment and coldly lowered her gaze. Mia pulled her back a step, signaling her to zip it. Veda stomped her foot in frustration, shooting a pleading look at John. Just then, Amelia caught a whiff of the pendant under the silk scarf, a refreshing herbal scent.

Amelia asked, "What's this bead?"

Emily smiled and said, "I filled this hollow bead with herbs. It repels mosquitoes and can be used as incense."

Amelia beamed, "Emily, I really love your gift."

Veda stomped her foot in jealousy.

There were too many people coming to give gifts to Amelia, so Emily returned to her seat. John, who was not pleased, muttered behind her, "Do you really have to show off at Veda's expense?"

Emily turned to look at him, lips curling in indifference. "John, is your head placed on a toilet seat?"

After retorting at John, Emily sat back in her chair, took a sip ofcoffee,her eyes lighting up.

The coffee they served to guests turned out to be Blue Mountain coffee.

It is said that Blue Mountain coffee costs millions of dollars per pound.

They must be really wealthy.

As she sipped her coffee, Amelia's grandson walked over. "I love the silk scarf you made. Could you make one for my girlfriend too? Name your price." Emily was taken aback. The guy pulled out his phone and said, "Let's add each other on Facebook so we can stay in touch." "Sure." Emily pulled out her phone.

John, sitting next to her, asked the guy, "Why isn't Mr. Smith here?"

The guy ignored him and happily left after adding Emily.

John felt awkward and scolded Emily, "Why didn't you ask him where James is? Don't you know why we're here?"

Emily shot him a cold look. "If you're so capable, go ask yourself.Seems like he doesn't even want to talk to you. Probably thinks you're useless."

Emily chuckled, her long hair swaying. Soon, a bunch of people came over asking for her contact info.

"Ms. Johnson, can your designs be used on clothes? I really need them."

"Ms. Johnson, can you make a silk scarf for me too? Name your price."


"Ms.Johnson..."

Emily was suddenly surrounded by these high society ladies. Veda watched from a distance, her jealous eyes burning with a sinister chill.

"Emily, you embarrass me, you're dead meat!"
###Chapter 7

Everyone liked Emily now, even though she never used to show up at any parties and she had been abandoned by the groom at her wedding.

Someone nearby said, "Ms. Emily Johnson isn't what the rumors say.She's smart and beautiful. Johnreally has bad taste, choosing Veda."

"It's no surprise, since a mistress knows how to seduce a man."

Veda heard this and her face turned pale. She stared at Emily, who was surrounded by people not far away. All of this should have been hers!Why did Emily get to take it all away from her?

She was about to get up and find John, ready to embarrass Emily in front of him. Even though Emily was elegant and noble, she couldn't even keep a man.

Sensing Veda's frustration, Mia quickly pressed her down and said, "Today is the Smith family's banquet, which is important for our famnily.Don't cause trouble. Mrs. Smith already has some opinions about you."

Veda blushed. "But why do they all want to be friends with Emily? Isn't she just good at making fans?"

Mia sighed, staring at Veda. After attending so mnany high-profile banquets with her, Veda still couldn't see through this. Mia could only remind her,"What they value is Emily's ability to please Mrs. Smith. Now,do you get it?11

Veda felt it was unfair, but she could only swallow her anger. Emily knew these people were untouchable, the children of high-ranking officials, so she could only add them on Facebook. Suddenly, a girl said, "He seems to be coming over today."

Then someone said, "I met him at Starry Capital before and exchanged contact info with him. He's really a gentle person."

"You're making it up. When did he ever interact with women?"

"He asked me out for dinner before. He's really handsome."

Someone followed up with a joke. "He's going to acquire your family's subsidiary company, so he meant to put pressure on you through the dinner."


"We had dinner together anyway. It's just a company. We'll give it to him if he wants it."


Emily's eyes flickered for a moment and she asked, "Ladies, are you talking about James?"

"Yes, he's even more handsome than male celebrities."

It turned out everyone valued appearance. But that person had the same name as her lover, so Emily felt a different meaning when she heard this.

James also loved coffee. Emily looked at the cup for a while, not listening to how the girls were teasing each other, and took a picture to send to James.

She sent a text message with the picture: [There's Blue Mountain coffee here. If you like it, I can help you drink more.] A long time passed and there was no reply. Emily continued to edit the message. But at that moment, the butler said, "Mr. Smith is back."  Everyone looked up. Emily sent out the latest message. In a moment of silence, only her Facebook notification sound rang out, and she looked up in astonishment.

James had just entered the banquet hall. He was dressed in a well-fitted dark suit with a silver-gray tie, which complemented his deep eyes and added a touch of mystery.

But when Emily saw James' face, her whole body stiffened instantly.

Her brain buzzed, her hand holding the phone tightened slightly,fingertips turning white.

James' eyes were as cold as a deep-sea undercurrent.

With a slight lift of his eyebrows, it felt like the air got sucked out of the room.James'gaze swept lightly over Emily.

Emily lowered her eyes, feeling inexplicably guilty. James had fair skin and a red mole at the bottom of his right eye,which turned particularly red every time they were intimate.

Emily loved kissing that spot and seeing James with red eyes.

James was a fiery, intense ball of energy, with a sunny and innocent personality. His eyes under those slightly raised eyelids were always pure and innocent. When Emily was in a bad mood, James would do his best to cheer her up.When she was in the mood, he would let her do as she pleased. Then,when Emily begged for mercy with tears, he would plead for one more tíme. But now, he was aloof, with a noble demeanor. He was full of restraint,as if looking at him for a moment longer would be a blasphemy.

Emily thought it was just a coincidence that they looked alike, both had a red mole in their eyes and shared the same name.

She kept comforting herself this way, then lowered her head and stopped looking.

James went straight to the second floor. After he disappeared,Emily finally let out a long breath.

The people around her started discussing James again.

"James is really handsome. He must have been looking at me."

"No way, he was definitely looking at me."

Emily couldn't hear a word they were saying now.

James stood on the second floor, leaning on the railing, looking down with indifference.


Emily turned her head to look, and their eyes met again.

This time she didn't avoid it. Even though they were far apart,she could clearly feel James' sharp gaze like a hawk.

He couldn't be that James. She had just dumped James and even paid him to not bother her. She couldn't bear to think about it.

Emily lowered her head, looked at the message on her phone,and James still hadn't replied.

Emily didn't know where she got the courage, and sent: [I just saw someone who looks exactly like you. What a coincidence.] She turned to look. The James upstairs wasn't looking at his phone, nor did he reply. She was about to relax.

When James took out his phone, she quickly lowered her head,staring at Facebook.


James:[Is that so?]

Each word struck her heart.

Emily looked up again, James looked at his phone, then slowly raised his head,his gaze obscure.

James continued: [Such delicious coffee, won't you bring me a cup?]

Emily's grip on her phone tightened so much that it seemed like she might crush it.

Emily couldn't describe her feelings at the moment. All the lewd past events kept replaying in her mind.

She and James never had a serious relationship. James was her secret lover,the embodiment of her most wanton side.


Emily had always been a good girl, and having an affair with James was the most outrageous thing she had ever done.

She couldn't help but think of the scene when she first met James. On the day of the wedding, after John left, she didn't even change out of her wedding dress and took her friend Ella García to a bustling nightlife district. They arrived at the top club of the Emerald City, where the rich spend their gold. She lost John, but she had plenty of money.

With a wave, she generously bought out all the male waiters in the club for that night. When she went to the bathroom, she saw James wearing a waiter's uniform.


Emily drunkenly lifted James' chin.
###Chapter 8

Emily leaned in and asked, "Hey gorgeous, wanna have some fun?"

The folks inside weren't nearly as good-looking as John.

James, clearly annoyed, shoved Emily away with a cold glare, letting her see him clearly.


Emily, undeterred, leaned into James, teasing him with hands wandering over his body, pushing him into a corner.

With a playful tone, she said, "You're selling yourself, but acting all shy.How much for a night? Ten grand, a hundred grand, or a million?"

James raised an eyebrow.

Emily got the hint. "A million bucks, huh? I can swing that."

James was a looker, and he was amazing in bed. Emily woke up to a chaotic scene, with their clothes and her pristine wedding dress all over the place.


She was stunned. She had planned to leave some money and go, but seeing James' face made her change her mind.

If John could hook up with Veda on their wedding day, Emily figured she didn't need to stay pure for him. So when James woke up, Emily, trying to hide her nerves, sat on the edge of the bed and said, "I know you male waiters don't make much in a night.How about sticking with me from now on?" James stayed silent. Emily pressed on, "Would you rather charge per visit or by the hour?"James kept his mouth shut.

Emily calmly added, "Whatever you want-cars,houses,money-I can give it to you."

Finally,James nodded. For the next three years, Emily kept James at Crystal Valley Manor.

He was a handsome guy, and just seeing him every day made Emily happy. She felt like she had found a treasure.

But now, looking up at James upstairs, she saw the prey had become the hunter, with cold, playful eyes.

The servants started serving food and drinks. Emily kept sipping her wine,her eyes growing dim, the light on her phone fading as James ignored her messages.

John had left at some point, and when he camne back, his clothes were a bit messy. Emily noticed the lipstick marks on his white shirt.

She smirked, feeling annoyed, and taunted, "Can't wait to get cozy at someone else's party, huh? That's gross."

John's brow furrowed. "Stop looking at me like that. Compared to Veda,Emily,you're the one who's not liked and seems like the other woman."

Emily gritted her teeth. Only someone as shameless as John could describe cheating as some kind of innocent mistake, making it sound so refined. Young John- had been a noble descendant of a prestigious family. Now, the older he got, the more disgusting he became. Emily thought of James again, feeling a headache and frustration.

She couldn't be bothered to argue with John, so she just lowered her head and drank alone.

Soon,her face flushed. John frowned, watching her gently rest her head on the table. Her smooth back was faintly visible, making John's Adam's apple bob.


His eyes darkened slightly. Although he didn't like Emily, he had to admit that every move she made was incredibly alluring. It made him a bit restless.


His gaze flickered, but he said disdainfully, "As Mrs. Williams, can you drink less at such a grand occasion?"

Emily felt a gaze on her back, making her uneasy. She glanced at John and said sarcastically, "Oh? I thought Mrs. Williams was Veda."

John glared at her, clearly pissed.

Emily kept mocking him, "Since everyone's here today, should I help clear things up for you?"

"Emily! Don't start!"

She rolled her eyes and kept drinking.

After giving the gift, Emily was ready to leave, but then they added an impromptu toasting session. She told John, "You go toast Mrs. Smith. I've had too much, and I'm heading back." John grabbed her wrist. "No, hold on. Otherwise,when Mrs. Smith asks, I can't explain."

Emily took a deep breath and held back. She couldn't eat anything on the table,just wanting to numb herself with alcohol.

Unfortunately, they were soon called to toast. Amelia had left early, leaving only James to hold the fort.

Emily wanted to escape. Dressed in a red dress, she walked over slowly with a glass of wine in hand.

John respectfully said to James, "Mr. Smith, we are from the Williams family. My wife and I are here to toast to you."

Even if James didn't want to drink, after so many people had toasted,he graciously gave face. But now facing John, he remained still.

John's hand was a bit stiff, his smile frozen. It was embarrassing.

Emily knew immedíately that James was doing it on purpose. Was he really that petty and cunning?

She took the initiative to pick up the wine and smiled slightly, looking both charming and enchanting. "Mr. Smith, this toast is to wish Mrs.Smith a happy birthday."

James turned the wine glass and glanced lightly at Emily.

From his eyes, Emily sensed danger. Then James spoke, "I heard that the Williams family is a jewelry family and has set your sights on my mine." John's eyes lit up, nodded instantly, and talked about the achievements of the Williams family in recent years. John's eyes lit up, nodded instantly, and talked about the achievements of the Williams family in recent years. always focused on affordable luxury, and currently, we have five hundred stores nationwide."


This number was quite impressive, especially during the years of economic downturn when the number of stores did not decrease.

Just when everyone thought James might consider cooperating with the Williams family, his tone turned cold. "The Golden Birch Group will not cooperate with the Williams family. You can drop that idea."

Everyone was stunned. This was a slap in the face for the Williams family.They were curious about when the Williams family had offended James.

Emily had already guessed it.

She finished her wine in one go, and also took John's glass,speaking calmly, "Mr. Smith, today is Mrs. Smith's birthday banquet. Even if the cooperation dloesn't work out, it's okay. I'll finish this glass."

She drank it all in one go again, the bitter wine turning into a burning sensation in her stomach.

Emily pulled John to leave. She just felt it was unnecessary to waste time.

Even if the Williams Family didn't cooperate with the Golden Birch Group,they would eventually go international. It was just a matter of taking a longer route and developing for a few more years. But John didn't see it that way. He directly let go of Emily's hand and asked James, "Mr. Smith, did we offend you?" James raised an eyebrow, remaining calm and composed. "You should ask Mrs. Williams about that."
###Chapter 9

With James' icy tone, everyone turned to look at Emily.

John was the first to speak up. "Emily, you know how crucial this deal is
for us. Why'd you have to cause trouble? Can't you just behave yourself?"

He grabbed Emily's wrist and yanked her back. "Say sorry to Mr. Smith."

Emily stayed quiet, giving John a slightly mocking glance.

That look made John feel uneasy and embarrassed, but he pressed on,"
You were the one who upset Mr. Smith. Shouldn't you apologize?"

John then turned to James, forcing a smile. "When did my wife offend you,
Mr.Smith?"

James just stared at Emily, tilting his head with a slight smirk. "Does Mrs.
Williams want mne to spell it out?"

Emily,her head pounding from the booze, wanted to rip off James' facade in front of everyone.

But she didn't dare because James held all the cards now.

She gave a faint smile, her voice tinged with apology, "I remember after John's and my wedding, I went out drinking and accidentally messed up
Mr. Smith's clothes. I didn't think he'd still remember after all these years.
How much were they? I'll pay for it." Bringing up the wedding caught John off guard. Everyone knew what went down at his wedding, and suddenly, all eyes were on him. Emily was also reminding James that theirpast was over, and now John was her husband.

Plus, as a wealthy guy, being a kept man for three years wasn't something to brag about.

And Emily had never shortchanged James financially.

Emotionally, there was no betrayal. They'd never been in love.

With a poised stance, Emily looked at James and smiled, "Mr. Smith, if you're still not satisfied. I can drink three more glasses."

"Three glasses? How about a whole bottle?"

Everyone was shocked that James held such a grudge. He remembered it for years and now wanted Emily to down a whole bottle without mercy.

The alcohol content was high. Drinking a whole bottle could be dangerous.

Emily didn't object, asking him meaningfully, "Does drinking this bottle mean our past is settled?"

James' eyes grew colder, and he sneered. "Yes."

A servant opened the bottle, and Emily started drinking straight from it.

As the strong liquor went down, Emily began to wobble. Even when she choked a bit, she just paused and kept going.
Her eyes reddened, her body swaying. James watched her, tapping the table impatiently. John frowned, overhearing some whispers. "This John has no class. His wife offended Mr. Smith because of him,and he's just standing there." He doesn't love his wife, does he? How would he know he's in the wrong?



John feIt embarrassed and finally supported Emily's arm, taking the bottle from her. By then, Emily had already drunk most of it.

She half-closed her eyes, her gaze drifting to James' face. Noticing his stare,Emily followed it, her eyes landing on her own arm.

She smiled and looked at John, asking, "What are you doing?"

"You're my wife. How could I just stand by and watch you get drunk?"

He then turned to James and said, "Mr. Smith, I'll finish the rest of the wine,okay?"


James' lips curled into a sarcastic smile. "Mr. Williams, you really are a good husband. Fine, but how about another bottle?"

John fell silent. But to keep James happy, he had to go along with it.

He gritted his teeth and started chugging. As soon as he took a sip of the second bottle, the alcohol hit him hard. This one seemed even stronger.

Emily glanced down. James wasn't even looking at John. He seemed indifferent, his deep eyes giving nothing away.

As John inadvertently let go of Emily, she took a step back, her red dress swaying, her long, straight legs catching everyone's eye.

James glanced at her, his eyes darkening slightly, the blame in them subtle. Emily's cheeks flushed, matching her red dress. With a bottle of wine down, John was already swaying, feeling queasy.He'd never been forced to drink like this before. This was the first time he'd felt so humiliated. But he had to endure it!

Emily had a much better tolerance for alcohol than John. After drinking most of the bottle, she was just a bit flushed.


She calmly said to James, "Mr. Smith, we've already apologized. Can we consider the past forgiven?"

The mention of the past was a veiled reference.

James' expression remained unchanged, but his tone grew colder. "You and your husband are indeed deeply in love."

He got up and left, and everyone quickly lost interest in the little drama.

They were just curious whether James would really not work with the Williams family.

But Emily was the only one who didn't want to work with James anymore.Cutting ties would be the best outcome for her.

John,feeling queasy, staggered to the bathroom. Emily returned to her seat,considering whether to leave early. After all, who knew what else might happen if she lingered longer here.

Just as Emily was about to get up, a glass of wine was suddenly splashed on her chest. The icy coldness made her shiver. Veda exclaimed, "Emily, I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there. I need to take care of John now. You're not going to be jealous, are you?" It disgusted-Emilyto the point of shivering. Emily took a tissue and wiped herself lightly,saying nonchalantly,"Then hurry up and leave."

Veda gritted her teeth and said, "Now that you've offended Mr. Smith, let's see how you'll handle it in the future."


It was indeed a headache-inducing problem, but it wasn't up to Veda to mock her.

Emily looked up at her and said, "I'm also a member of the Johnson family. Unless my parents disown me, the Johnson family can't escape the fallout. What do you think?"

After being refuted, Veda left in frustration. Emily lowered her head,unable to clean up the mess, especially inside. Feeling very uncomfortable,she got up and went to the bathroom.

###Chapter 10

When Emily headed to the bathroom, she caught the unmistakable sound of John and Veda making out inside.


Her scalp prickled with irritation at their shamelessness.

Emily frowned, knocked on the door, and said calmly, "Hey, could you be any louder? Might as well let everyone know."

The kissing noises stopped abruptly, followed by the rustling of clothes.A moment later, the door opened, and Emily raised her phone, confronting Veda as she stepped out.

"Veda, I'm still married to him. If you think being the other woman is something to be proud of, I don't mind showing everyone what you're up to."

Veda looked mortified, but before she could respond, John emerged and pulled her behind him protectively.

Emily smirked, remembering how John used to protect her like that when she first came back to the Johnson family. Funny how feelings change.

"Emily, you're being ridiculous," John said, leading Veda away.

Veda glanced back, probably expecting to see Emily looking humiliated,but Emily had already stepped into the bathroom. The wine stains on her red dress weren't visible, but the sticky feeling was gross. Emily locked the door, walked to the sink, and carefully untied her dress,revealing a white slip stained with red wine. She frowned, knowing this stain wasn't coming out easily.

She glanced at her phone, thinking about asking someone to bring her a new outfit.


Just as she picked up her phone, she was startled by a noise from one of the stalls. She turned to see James stepping out.

James had those delicate features that made any woman envious, but right now, his furrowed brows and cold demeanor were intimidating.


Emily hadn't expected to see James here. It wasn't until her back was pressed against the cold door that she snapped out of it.

She struggled. "Mr. Smith, my husband is right outside. Don't you think you're crossing a line?"

"Your husband? Emily, have you forgotten our first meeting?"

He was nothing like before, his domineering presence making it hard for her to breathe.

Emily started to remember the past. If she hadn't been so forward that night, they might not have stayed together for three years.

Unable to break free, Emily stopped struggling and smiled slightly. Her cheeks were flushed from the alcohol, adding a touch of allure. She lightly tugged at James's belt. "Mr. Smith, do you want to settle things from three years ago right here?" Seeing his restrained expression, Emily noticed the corners of James's eyes were even redder than hers, and his chest was heaving faster. James leaned in for a kiss, almost forceful, without any hesitation. Knowing his kissing style, Emily knew she couldn't avoid or resist it, so she decided to enjoy it. Anyway, she wasn't losing out.

James's cool hand gently stroked her back, tearing off the remaining slip.

Emily felt a chill on her back. Then, James took off his coat, draped it over her, and opened the bathroom door. This was nuts!


Since there weren't many people upstairs paying attention, they quickly slipped into a bedroom.

The black and white decor screamed James's style.

James let go of Emily, who went straight to the closet,rummaging through it only to find his clothes.

Emily shot him a look. "Isn't it a bit awkward to go out in your clothes?"

James smirked. "Then go out naked!"

Emily still had her pride. She frowned, her gaze fixed on James. "Mr.Smith,can you look away?"

James sat on the bed, his expression cold, his eyes lingering on Emly's body. He calmly said, "What if I don't?"

Emily had no choice, so she boldly stripped off her clothes.

During their three years at Crystal Valley Manor, they had done all sorts of wild things and seen every part of each other's bodies. Emily leisurely changed clothes. James's shirt was a bit big, so she tied a nice knot around her waist and then cut her red dress into a short skirt. It was a waste of fabric, but she had no other option. James had been staring at her the whole time, his eyes gradually becoming unreadable. He said coldly, "Emily, leave John."

Emily walked over, lifted his chin, and smiled slightly. "Leave him to become your mistress?"

Although Emily did plan to leave John, it had to be her choice, not forced by anyone.

"Are you so attached to John?"

Emily didn't deny it. "Of course, we grew up together as childhood friends.
I liked him throughout his teenage years. And being Mrs. Williams is better than being your mistress."

James frowned. "I never intended for you to be my mistress."

Raising an eyebrow, Emily asked again, "James, then do you want to marry me?"

James fell silent.

Emily played with her long hair, smiling as she spoke, "It seems like you're not willing to."

It was obvious that the Smith family wouldn't want a divorced woman.They would want someone who was a better match for their status.

Emily spoke up, "Mr. Smith, we were just having fun. These three years,we've had a great time playing. Don't tell me feelings can be developed through sleeping together; that's something only kids believe." She continued, "And in these three years, I haven't neglected you. I've given you compensation, and I'll just consider the deception as Mr.Smith your little quirks. Let's part on good terms."

Emily couldn't understand him. As the heir of the Smith family,why would he put on a facade of a male escort for three years?

If Emily had known James's identity from the beginning, she would never have dared to have such a connection with him. Emily's mood today was like a roller coaster.


With his cold gaze and already exquisite face, Emily felta sense of guilt with just one look. His face was his most perfect disguise.

He asked, "Emily, can you tolerate that John's affair is with your s
###Chapter 11

"Yeah, I can handle it."

"You love him that much?!"

Emily's heart skipped a beat, but she kept her face blank. "Of course. If I
didn't love him, I wouldn't have married himn."

James shot back, "But he doesn't love you."

Emily tilted James's chin up. "Do you love me then?"

James frowned, gripping her hand tightly, his face icy. Emily winced a bit from the pressure.

Taking a deep breath, Emily said slowly, "What John and I have is something you can't understand. The misunderstandings between us will get sorted out eventually."

Truth was, she stopped loving John the day he bailed on their wedding.Emily needed someone who was all in, with no distractions. But James couldn't offer her the unwavering love she needed.

She was only saying this to get James off her back. Whether he was done playing or not, she was done with this lover's game.

Emily tried to pull away, but James grabbed her hand again. He asked in a low voice, "Three years ago, you went to the bar just to get back at John. It could've been anyone, not necessarily me, right?" Emily thought for a moment and nodded. "Mr. Smith, the truth hurts, but yeah,you're right." She added, "But I don't think I wronged you. If I'd known who you were,I wouldn't have gotten involved."

James let go of her hand and sneered. "Emily, you're something else."

He never thought he'd be used as a pawn in a woman's revenge against her husband. It made him feel used and humiliated.

Seeing the smirk on James's face, Emily had a bad feeling.

James stood up, his gaze icy. "Emily, no one makes me feel this bad and gets away with it. Just wait and see!"


Emily watched him storm out, the door slamming so hard the whole house shook.

She stood there for a moment, then smiled helplessly, thinking, 'It's over.'

James was always petty.

Emily rubbed her forehead. Just then, her phone rang. She looked down and saw it was John calling.

She pursed her lips and answered, her voice cold. "What do you want?"

"It's time to go. WWhere are you?"

Emily replied, "I'll be right down."

When John saw Emily in different clothes, he frowned and asked coldly,"Why did you change? Where did you go?" Emily gently held her back. "Mom, don't bother; he would never like me.I'm a bit tired; I'll go rest." Seeing Emily looking so lost, Calliope didn't know how to comfort her, so After the banquet, Emily left the Elegant Orchid Garden in John's car. But halfway there, John got a call.

Emily could hear the soft sobs on the other end.

A few minutes later, John stopped the car, looking impatient. "Get out.
Veda's in trouble, and I need to go see her."

Emily looked at him helplessly. "John, are you really this shameless now?"

He didn't even bother pretending to be a gentleman. Rolling her eyes,Emily suddenly leaned towards John. When he wasn't paying attention,she opened his car door and kicked him inthe groin.

While John was doubled over in pain, Emily gracefully pushed him out of the car. "If you want to see her, go on your own. The car's mine."

Even the driver was shocked. He didn't expect Emily to be so fierce.

Emily shut the car door and asked the driver,"Why aren't we moving?"


The driver didn't dare to argue with her.

When Emily returned alone, John's mom, Calliope Bishop, immediately wanted to confront John.

"How could John treat you like this! Emily, I'll stand up for you. How did I end up with a son like him!"

Calliope had never felt so upset in her life. she just nodded.

In the following days, Emily went to work as usual. She often saw John at the company. As the design department director, she wasn't involved in seeking investments or negotiating deals. John, on the other hand, was super busy these days.

Despite that, he still found time to be with Veda every day. Veda's social media was filled with pictures of her and John, showing off the gifts he gave her.

John was going all out to please Veda.

What comforted Emily was that James hadn't contacted her in the past few days. However, whenever John took the design department's work to James for discussion, James always refused with various excuses.

Emily was driven to the brink of despair by the constant revisions. She had never encountered such a difficult client before.

Even for a simple necklace design, Emily had revised it more than a dozen times, but none of them seemed to catch James's attention.

Every time John went to see him, he got scolded. Once, he was even kicked out of the company, which was a complete embarrassment.

This also made John's mood particularly bad these days. He was now furious in the office. His anger was directed straight at Emily. He scolded, "Why did you provoke him? If this collaboration fails, you'll bear the main responsibility." Emily smiled. "That's your problem. What does it have to do with me? As a man, why do you always make excuses for your incompetence?" John's face turned green with anger, and his body was trembling.

Finally, he spat out, "If you have the ability, make him accept your proposal."


Emily replied directly, "I don't have the ability."

John was so angry he almost fell over. He had always known Emily as a good girl who was always obedient. Now she started speaking so unfriendly.

The two of them argued in the meeting, and the other executives could only look to John's father, Wilder Williams, the one in charge of the company.

Wilder spoke calmly, "Emily, as the designer, you are responsible for this matter. If we can't reach an agreement, we can just stop the cooperation.
Let John see that you are not weak."

John fell silent.

Emily obediently responded, "Okay, Mr. Wilder Williams."


John asked,"Dad,what's gotten into you?"

Wilder turned to John. "In the company, call me Mr. Wilder Williams."
###Chapter 12

Emily had run into James before when she was overseas for an exhibition.

Back then, she was super confused because James was supposed to be waiting for her at Crystal Valley Manor.

Without thinking, she blurted out. "Babe, are you getting a new sugar mommy?"

Emily couldn't remember what James said at that moment, but that night,she spent a ton of money to get James back.

Looking back now, she regretted underestimating James.

She showed up at the Golden Birch Group's branch office with her finished sketches. The branch office wasn't as fancy as the headquarters, but it was definitely a landmark in Emerald City.

Getting to work here was already a big deal.

When Emily walked in, no security guard stopped her. She went straight to the front desk and said to the receptionist, "Hey, I'm a designer from the Williams Group here to discuss a collaboration with Mr.Smith.Can you tell me which floor his office is on?"

The receptionist gave Emily a quick once-over, a hint of jealousy flashing in her eyes at Emily's bold and striking appearance.

She sneered, "Your husband can't secure the cooperation, so you're planning to use seduction for that? Gross!" Emily kept her cool and said, "You can ask Mr. Smith, and he'll let me up to seduce him with my beauty," Hearing this, the receptionist slammed the table impatiently. "What's your relationship with Mr. Smith? Even if you call, he won't let you up. You better leave now, or I'll call security."

Emily asked her to wait and made a phone call.

In less than a minute, the receptionist got a call and heard a cold voice saying, "Let her come up."


The receptionist's face turned sour, looking at Emily with disdain. "Go up,52nd floor."


The receptionist thought, 'Who is this woman to make Mr. Smith personally call and let her up? After all, Mr. Smith never meets women alone. Just because Emily is good-looking?'

On the 52nd floor, Emily stepped out of the elevator. As she walked down a corridor, someone approached her.

The man whispered, "Ms. Johnson, Mr. Smith is in a meeting.Please wait for half an hour."

Emily stopped in her tracks. "Then I'll go to the reception room."

James wasn't there, so it wouldn't be cool to go to his office.

But the assistant just smiled. "Given your relationship with Mr. Smith, you don't need to worry about such formalities"

Emily felt a bit embarrassed but quickly nodded. No need to hide. After all,she wasn't the one being kept as a lover. Emily went-straight into James's office. The huge French windows offered a view of Emerald River, almost overlooking half of Emerald City. The sunlight poured in, warming everyone in the room.

As Emily toured James's office, she noticed his large desk piled high with files that she couldn't finish in two months, living up to the reputation of Golden Birch Group with its heavy workload.

It was tough for James to find time to play the game with her.

Emily suddenly felt she had too little compensation for James.

She casually picked up a dictionary from James's desk, flipped through a few pages, and a photo tucked in the book suddenly fell out.


She bent down to pick it up and took a look. It was just half a photo,yellowed with age. The person in it wasn't clear, but she could vaguely make out two small braids.

Emily was about to take a closer look when James caught her off guard.

She waved the photo, teasing James, "I didn't expect you to have a cross-dressing phase when you were young. How come you never wore anything like this when I had you around?"

Emily had a phase where she always tried to get James to cross-dress. Of course,it never worked.

James's gaze was cold. "Cross-dressing isn't my thing."

Emily chuckled. James walked over, took the photo, placed it back in the dictionary, and gave Emily a faint glance. He asked, "Why are you here? Have you figured it out?" Emily handed him the design sketches and said, "Mr. Smith has so many requirements for the design sketches. I decided to come and design them myself. You won't refuse,right?"


James narrowed his eyes slightly, looking cold and arrogant, and sneered."Are you here for John? Did you feel sorry for him after I kicked him out a few times?"


Emily frowned. "Even if you beat him up, I wouldn't feel sorry.It's just that the Williams family's jewelry is worth your cooperation. Mr. Smith,you have to give me a chance."

James beckoned her, "Come here."

Emily directly sat on James's lap, wrapped one arm around his neck,and leaned against him. "I'm here. Mr. Smith, how can you agree to cooperate?"

She blew a breath, ligtly brushed her fingertips over James's ear, watching as his ear turned red. James blushed easily.

But James was also bold. He never let himself be taken advantage of, so he pointed to his lips, and Emily obediently kissed him.

It used to be James trying to please Emily, but now the roles were reversed.

Clearly, James was enjoying it. At first, James had his eyes half-open,feeling Emily's seriousness. Then he closed his eyes,holding her waist tightly and deepening the kiss slowly.

Lips and teeth intertwined. Emily's legs were getting weak. As the kiss was about to end, Emily asked James, "Mr. Smith,are you willing to give me a chance?"James almost ground his teeth. He was kissing passionately, while Emily was still thinking about work.

James took a deep breath and said, "Seducing me won't work."

Emily's face turned cold, she pushed James away directly, stood up instantly, and straightened her clothes. "You should have said that earlier.You made me sacrifice so much."


James fell silent. Emily reapplied her lipstick in front of James.

James closed his eyes, still with lingering desire. "You move into Crystal Valley Manor, and we'll cooperate."

"Okay,deal."

When they broke up, Emily gave James five properties, one of which was Crystal Valley Manor.

Crystal Valley Manor was an unnamed villa located in the suburbs,but since she and James spent nights there often, she had a nameplate made especially to hang at the entrance-Crystal Valley Manor.

She used to tease James, saying, "It's actually better to hide you in the house. When my husband comes to catch us red-handed, he won't have any evidence if you wear women's clothes at home."

###Chapter 13

James didn't think she'd agree so quickly. Something felt off, but he shrugged it off.

Emily said, "Since I agreed, shouldn't you check out my design draft?"

She handed over the sketch.

James finally opened it. After a quick look, he didn't see any big issues since he trusted her skills.


Emily reminded him, "I agreed to move in with you, so you should send over the contract."

James hesitated for a moment but then sent the contract to the Williams Group.

Meanwhile, John was a bit shocked when he got the collaboration agreement.

He stood up, surprise flickering in his eyes before his face turned dark.

Seeing John's sour expression, the assistant tried to comfort him. "Mr.Williams, even though we didn't get the deal with the Golden Birch Group,we..."

John cut him off. "The contract just came through." The assistant was confused. "Well, that's good1. It shows your efforts paid off. And with this contract, no one can badmouth you at the company." John tightened his lips. He couldn't even meet James before. But as soon as Emily went over, the contract was sent directly. John didn't want to overthink it. Was it really just a coincidence?

After tidying up her clothes, Emily glanced at James and left without a word.


James watched her leave, squinting slightly and reminding her, "I'll be waiting for you at Crystal Valley Manor tonight."

Emily didn't even look back. At eight that evening, Emily was having a blast with friends in a private room when she got a call from James.

She snapped her fingers, signaling everyone to quiet down before answering.

James's voice was furious, "Emily! You liar!"

Emily lazily leaned back on the sofa, sensibly moving the phone away from her ear until James calmed down. Then she said, "Mr. Smith, what did I lie about?"

"You agreed to move into Crystal Valley Manor with me!"

Emily raised an eyebrow and calmly said, "Yes, but I didn't say when I'd move. Maybe in a few years, no rush."

By then, the contract would be finalized, and the Williams family would have their own connections.

James would be useless by then. James stood by the floor-to-ceiling window, imagining Emily's indifferent expression. His eyebrows twitched. "How did I not realize you were so shameless before?" Emily twirled her long hair with her fingertips and said softly, "You taught me well."

When James was messing with Emily in bed, he always act shamelessly.

James's expression turned cold. "I'll give you an hour. If you come over,I can let bygones be bygones!"

Emily smiled. "Mr. Smith, we've already settled our past. Good night."


Emily hung up decisively. Just as she was about to enjoy a drink,her phone beeped.


She looked down and saw that James had sent her a photo of a golden cage with a bed inside.

The more Emily looked at it, the more familiar it seemed. She instantly sprang up from the sofa, pursing her red lips.

How could she have forgotten about this? Before breaking up with James,she bought a golden cage, intending to give it to him.

But then John came back, so she had forgotten about it.

James: [Emily, who were you planning to imprison with this cage?]

Emily didn't dare to reply and acted as if she hadn't seen the messages.
Now she had lost interest in playing, so she bid farewell to her friends.

"How did Ms. Johnson manage to secure the collaboration when Mr.Williams spent so many days without any progress?" "What else could she do? She must've seduced Mr. Smith. When she joined the design department, she didn't even go through any assessment.They said it was to compensate her." "If she can't even keep an eye on her own husband, it's just incompetence."

The conversation from the bathroom drifted out, and Emily stopped in her tracks,leaning lazily against the door, listening quietly.


"If it weren't for the Williams family backing her, no one would appreciate her messy designs. Does she really think she's a savior?"

When the two women came out, Emily smiled, stood up straight, and in her sleeveless light blue dress that accentuated her waist, she looked gentle and spoke softly, "Sorry to surprise you, but I really am the savior."

John's departure at the wedding caused fluctuations in the Williams Group's stock, and many partners later demanded to terminate the contract due to poor designs. It was Emily who persuaded them one by one with her design drafts.

Thus, she maintained the Williams family's position in the jewelry industry.

Nora Adams, who had beentalking the most, felt embarrassed.

But since she had already said it, she didn't hide it anymore. "If it weren't for my leave during that time, I would have been the one sitting in the director's position."

Emily raised an eyebrow, smiling brightly. "I remember you couldn't handle the consequences of failure, so you gave up. How can you blame me now?"
After Emily took over the position, the subordinates had never been convinced. But as long as they worked diligently and didn't cause trouble for Emily,she naturally wouldn't bother. After all, she joined the Williams Group to work because no one else was capable. Without new design drafts, the partners would withdraw their investments, which would be a blow to the Williams Group.

And Emily wasn't there to make friends in thecompany.Whether she had this job or not didn't affect her.

Emily had many skills that were enough to ensure her livelihood for a lifetime.


Moreover, even Cassia's annual dividends were enough for her to spend lavishly.

Nora looked at her displeased. "Don't be smug. The company has been wanting to take away your rights for a long time. Once the collaboration with the Golden Birch Group is finalized, this credit definitely won't be yours!"

Emily just played with her hair and said indifferently, "It doesn't matter."


She left the club in high heels.

Nora stomped her foot in annoyance. She really disliked how Emily always seemed so effortlessly in control.

The next day.

When Emily arrived at work, she found everyone already gathered. The collaboration matters had been settled. James was not one to go back on his word. As for whether John could secure more profit-sharing,that was no longer her concern. There shouldn't have been anything special today until someone from the president's office came. He said directly to her, "Ms. Johnson, there will be a new person joining your design department today. She will be specifically responsible for expanding our futuire overseas design services."

Emily furrowed her brows, a hint of annoyance in her eyes. "You're bypassing me and assigning someone to the design department directly?"

The president's secretary, Ruby Hill, said, "Ms. Johnson, it's just a notification to you. She is of equal status to you."
###Chapter 14

Emily stayed quiet until Veda stepped out of the elevator, standing right in front of herand saying, "Sis, we're colleagues now."

Emily glanced at Veda, who was dressed in a light pink suit, her face perfectly oval with a cherry-like mouth, looking all cute and innocent.

Veda had always put on the act of being the obedient one, so much so that Aiden and Mlia would believe anything she said without a second thought.

Even if Veda messed up, a single tear in front of Aiden and Mia would mean Emily had to take the fall.

Everyone was shocked when Veda called her Sis.

Emily couldn't pretend to be nice, especially with Veda. Her voice was icy."Don't call me Sis."

Veda bit her lip and looked down, all hurt. "I know you don't want to work with me, but I got this job fair and square. It's rare for us sisters to work together. If you really can't stand it, I'll leave. I don't want to make things hard for you."

Veda turned to leave, looking all pitiful, which was honestly kind of heartbreaking.

Emily just chuckled and watched her go without stopping her.

Ruby frowned and said, annoyed, "Ms. Johnson, she's your sister. Can't you just talk it out?" Nora couldn't take it either and stepped in to stop Veda, saying gently,"This isn't your fault. Emily just doesn't want anyone to challenge her authority."

Then she glanced at Emily, "It's ridiculous. Why target your own sister?"

Suddenly, everyone was looking at Emily with a mix of disdain and contempt. Working for a boss like this was embarrassing.

Emily felt a pang in her heart. Scenes like this had played out countless times in the Johnson family.

She felt a slight heaviness in her chest. When Nora was about to speak up for Veda, Emily cut her off, "You're still in this department. How dare you slander me so openly? Well, the design department doesn't need someone who can't produce any designs. You can transfer."

For a designer, not being able to produce designs was the ultimate insult.

Nora's eyes filled with tears of anger, but she couldn't say a word in response.

Emily's voice was cold. "Ill give you half a month. If you can't secure the collaboration with the mobile game company Empire Glance, then resign."

Veda looked at Nora, her body trembling. Feeling sorry for her, Veda immediately spoke up, "Emily, she didn't mean it. You don't have to be so harsh. How can we let her bear it alone? Let's solve it together. As her superior,you should be encouraging."

Emily looked at Veda playing the peacemaker, raised an eyebrow, and sneered. "Why should everyone suffer for her mistake? Because of her,everyone's performance is affected." Those who wanted to defend Nora fell silent. They had all lost money and were a bit resentful towards Nora. Emily mocked, "Of course, if you don't care about losing tens of thousands of dollars in performance, I have no objection."

Everyone went quiet, and Nora's face turned pale, feeling totally humiliated.

Veda lowered her head and mumbled, "Sorry, I didn't know the situation."

Emily shot her a cold look. "Then don't speak."

Veda bit her lip, looking all hurt. Emily just rolled her eyes.

Ruby, watching the whole thing, quickly stepped in, "Let's stop this pointless arguing."


She gave Veda a look, shook her head slightly, then turned to Emily and said, "Ms. Johnson, from now on, all the design handover work with Golden Birch Group will be handled by Veda. She's on the same position as you and doesn't need to report to you."


Emily's eyes flashed with sarcasm. She wasn't planning to take responsibility for this mess, but handing it over to Veda out of nowhere did make her uncomfortable.


John had just come back to the company and was already acting like he ran the place, giving perks to his woman as he pleased.

Seeing Emily not objecting, Ruby said to Veda, "Ms. Veda Johnson, your office isready. Shall I take you to see it?"

Veda shook her head gently. "I want to talk with Emily."

Ruby nodded and left.

After Emily returned to her office, Veda followed with a smile. "Emily, Mom asked you to take care of me more."

Emily knew she was using Mia to provoke her.

A flash of anger crossed her eyes as she sneered. "Veda, you took away my parents and John. Now you want to mess with my work too?"

Veda looked all soft and innocent, making it hard to believe she was the same person who had jumped out of a window and heartlessly aborted a child.

She said, "Emily, you misunderstand me. I studied design myself, and I never took anything from you. They chose me."

Emily responded lazily, like she didn't care anymore. "I've always wondered, since you were already pregnant, you could've used the child to get into the Williams family. Why did you have an abortion?"

Even though they were alone, Veda kept up her act. "Emily, what are you talking about? I don't understand. My child, it's clearly yours..."

After a brief moment of sadness, she smiled gently. "Emily, I understand if you blame me for being with John."

Before marrying John, Emily could feel that John loved her, but she didn't know when it changed. John suddenly began to dislike her.

Thinking of the past, Veda's cheeks blushed slightly, feeling guilty and embarrassed, about to speak.

Emily clicked her tongue. "I have no interest in the dirty past between you two.Get out."

Veda didn't want her to misunderstand and hurriedly explained, "Emily, it' s not what you think, you..."

Emily coldly interrupted her. "Whatever happened between you two, don't cause trouble for me at work. I'm not as easy to push around as I was three years ago."


After Veda left the office, she sighed deeply.

Veda thought, 'Emily, because of you, all the glory that belonged to me has vanished. I'll make sure everyone turns agai
###Chapter 15

With Veda joining the team, John called a meeting to introduce her to the senior execs.


"Veda's gonna be the new Director of the Design Department," John announced, "and she'll be handling our collaboration with the Golden Birch Group."


"She's got a master's from Fusion Design Academy and even snagged first place in a jewelry design competition back in college."

John knew all about Veda's accomplishments.

Emily raised an eyebrow and gave a cold smile when she heard this.

She watched lazily. If Wilder were here today, he would've definitely slapped him.


Everyone's eyes turned to Emily. One of the senior execs asked, "What about Ms. Emily Johnson? Who do we go to for urgent drawings in the Design Department? Mr. Williams, have you thought this through?"

He added, "Does Ms. Veda Johnson really know the Design Department?Sure, she won an award in college, but how long has it been since she graduated? Has she done anything impressive since then?"

Having two directors in one department was just crazy.

Every word from the senior exec seemed to cha llenge John,the general manager. Emily casually glanced at John. Veda, trying to be sensible, said, "Mr. Williams, I can just be a regular employee. No need to make things hard for Emily."

"In that case, since this is a senior management meeting, you're not qualified to be here. Please leave," Emily said calmly, looking at Veda.

Veda's face turned red with embarrassment. She clenched her teeth, ready to leave,but John stopped her.

John glared at Emily. "I said she'll be equal to you in status in the future!"

Emily asked, "Who agreed to that?"

The room fell silent.

Forcing Veda into the department was one thing, but making her directly involved with the Golden Birch Group was just absurd.

John tightened his lips. Just back at the company, he didn't want to push too hard. He could only say, "Since you all don't agree, let's see whose design the Golden Birch Group picks."

Emily frowned. She had already given her design to James. She thought,Could it be that it got rejected?'

Just then, John pulled out her design and sneered, "Thanks to my efforts,the Golden Birch Group agreed to work with us. But Emily, your design was rejected."


Emily's expression darkened. James was probably getting back at her for not moving into Crystal Valley Manor. Since John had already backed down a bit, there was no need for everyone to push too hard. The meeting ended in a tense atmosphere. After the meeting, John took Veda to his office.

Once inside, Veda naturally sat on John's lap, wrapped her arms around his neck, and said, "John, even though Istudy design, I'm not sure about Mr.Smith's preferences. Plus, the Golden Birch Group didn't tell us the theme this time. I want to meet Mr. Smith. Any ideas?"

John thought for a moment and said, "Tomorrow, James is going to a jewelry appraisal event at the Royal Venue. You can try your luck there."

Veda hesitated and sighed. "But I need a jewelry appraisal certificate for that event."

"You can go as Mrs. Williams. The organizers will definitely give the Williams family some respect."

"What about Emily?"

John chuckled. "She didn't go. Besides, what does she have to do with me?"


Veda looked worried, but a hint of complacence crept into her heart.

Back in her office, Emily took out the design James had rejected and studied it for a while.


She thought to herseIf, 'James, you really have no taste.' Soon, Veda returned to the Design Department from upstairs. Her clothes were a bit disheveled, and her steps were unsteady. It was unclear if she was intentionally provoke Emily. Anyone with keen eyes could see what had happened.Emily was fuming. Just then, her direct line rang-a line reserved for calls between leaders.

She answered, and John's cold voice came through. "Emily, because of you,Veda won't be able to become a mother in the future. Veda is now in your department. I warn you not to bully her! Otherwise, get out of the company."

Emily snorted, finding it somewhat amusing. "She doesn't have enough ability herself and now blames me for getting questioned? She doesn't show gratitude and instead criticizes me after benefiting."

John knew the last sentence was a dig at Veda, his voice becoming even colder. "She just used your design. Why hold onto it now? Emily,why didn't I notice before that you were so petty?"

Emily wanted to retort, but John had already hung up. She was extremely frustrated.


Veda had taken Emily's work, yet in the end, Emily was the one being blamed for being petty.

Emily glanced at the design, took out her phone, and dialed James'number. In less than five seconds, the call was answered.

"Mrs. Williams, do you have something to discuss with me?"

Mrs. Williams? James was still jealous and angry. Or perhaps, he knew how ridiculous and embarrassing he had been those years, and wanted to draw a clear line. Emily cleared her throat and said seriously, "I would like to discuss the design with you. Mr. Smith, can you spare some time?" James snorted. After a long silence, he asked, "Mrs. Williams,have you always been this shameless? You stood me up yesterday, and today you want to talk about work wwith me?"


Emily thought for a moment before speaking slowly, "Mr. Smith, shouldn't we separate work and personal matters?"

James chuckled. "Come to Crystal Valley Manor, and we can have a good chat."


Emily pursed her lips. Each time Emily came to Crystal Valley Manor,she never failed to be completely drained from their intimate encounters


She refused. "Let's talk outside. As for other matters, Mr.Smith,don't think about them. Can you suggest a time and place?"


James knew she was always firm and would probably not move to Crystal Valley Manor. And her stubbornness was almost frightening.


James spoke coldly, "There is a world-class jewelry appraisal event at the Royal Venue tomorrow. I'll be waiting for you there."


Emily had heard about this jewelry appraisal event a month ago. There were rumors that many private collectors' jewelry would be on display,along with some high-end jewelry evaluations.

Many jewelry designers were trying every means to get in.
###Chapter 16

The next morning at ten, Emily showed up at the Royal Venue right on time. The place was packed, and only a select few with invitations were allowed in.


Most folks were stopped by the staff and had to show their IDs.

Emily tried to walk right in but got stopped by the staff. One of them said,"Only those with invitations can enter. Miss, you need to verify your ID over there."

Emily shot back, "I'm Mrs. Williams. Can I go in now?"

Usually, the Williams family, being big shots in the jewelry world,didn't face any trouble at these events.

The staff member was taken aback, a bit surprised, "You're Mrs. Williams?Of course,you can go in."

But just as she took a few steps, the venue manager stopped her. "Mrs.Williams is already inside. Who are you?"

Then the manager turned to the staff,saying,′′Iyou let random people in,you'll be in big trouble!"

The staff member looked at Emily with disdain. "How dare you pretend to be Mrs. Williams?"

Emily frowned,clearly confused. make a mistake?" the manager pointed inside.

Sure enough, there was a graceful woman chatting with someone. It was Veda.

Veda soon turned around and saw her, a hint of surprise in her eyes.

"Look how imposing she is. Compared to her, you must be fake. Hurry up and leave, or we'll kick you out." The manager was about to push Emily.

Emily was in a simple professional suit, making it easy to dodge to the side. At this moment, Veda walked over, smiling slightly. "Emily, you're here too."

Emily crossed her arms and gave Veda a cold smile. "If I didn't come,how would I know someone is using my name?"

Veda looked innocent. "Emily, I don't know what you're talking about."

The manager sided with Veda, accusing Emily, "I never thought someone would shamelessly pretend to be Mrs. Williams."

The commotion drew everyone's attention at the entrance.

"How can there be two Mrs. Williams? This is so dramatic!"

James had noticed Emily a while ago, watching from the side.

Emily also saw him, not missing the subtle look in his eyes.

Emily glanced at James. Honestly, James had rarely dressed up in front of her over the years.

But now, James was in a well-tailored dark gray suit, a crisp tie, looking refined and elegant, exuding a noble and suave aura.
He had suddenly transformed from a male escort to a powerful CEO.Emily wasn't used to this change.

Some random thoughts popped into her head at the wrong time.

One of James's friends beside him teased, "Are they both Mrs. Williams? In Emerald City, can a manmarry two wives? That's interesting!"

He draped his arm over James's shoulder, teasing with a smile, "No wonder you've been reluctant to leave Emerald City. Do you want to marry two?"

James shot his friend a cold look. The manager was about to call security.

Veda stayed calm, knowing Emily usually didn't make a fuss.

Veda had taken Emily's parents since she was born, and then her husband on their wedding day, but Emily never fought back. She had even goneto work at the Williams Group the day after the wedding.

Veda had come back pregnant to test Emily's limits, but Emily didn't take her seriously as usual.

So, Veda naturally assumed Emily would back down this time too. But Emily just stood there, calmly staring at her.

Suddenly, a rich young guy next to James spoke up, James, didn't both Mr. and Mrs. Williams go to Amelia's birthday party? You should've seen them."

Everyone's eyes turned to James. Veda frowned slightly, feeling a bit shocked. James must know about them. Emily thought she and James had some kind of understanding, and he wouldn't disrespect her in this situation.

But to her surprise, James glanced at her indifferently and said, "With so many people at the party that night, how could I remember who Mrs.Williams is?"


Emily clenched her teeth. When did he become so temperamental?

James continued, "Since you both claim to be Mrs. Williams, let John come and sort itout."


Emily furrowed her brows and bit her lip. James was definitely doing this on purpose.

The manager quickly contacted John. The video call connected fast.

"Ace,what's up?"

"Mr. Williams, there are two Mrs. Williams at the Royal Venue now.Which one is the real Mrs. Williams?"

John frowned, looking at Ace who turned the camera to Emily and Veda.His eyes instantly turned cold.

He had just warned Emily not to provoke Veda yesterday,and today she forgot his words.

He spoke without any hesitation, "The one in the formal dress is my wife."

Emily wasn't surprised at all, and she just chuckled.

If she hadn't torn up the marriage certificate the day after their wedding.she could've slapped it in their faces right now.

Ace immediately had security escort Emily out. Emily took a step back,a cold look in her eyes. "Without the title of Mrs. Williams, can I not go in?”


Veda breathed a sigh of relief and said with a smile, "Emily, it's fine to cause a scene at home, but don't make it hard for the staff here."


Ace also sarcastically said, "Of course, there's a way,but do you have an invitation? Are you a level five jewelry appraiser? If not, then you can't go in today."


People around were already gossiping.

"She's so beautiful, yet she's doing this. Is she trying to attract a wealthy man?"


"Maybe she's the mistress Mr. Williams kept on the side. Didn't Mr.Williams run away with the mistress on his wedding day? It's probably her,with that seductive look."


Emily raised an eyebrow and said to Veda, "They seem to be insulting you,aren't you going to refute?"

Veda's face turned ugly. And Emily showed no embarrassment, leisurely taking out an invitation from her bag. "Here's the invitation. Can I go in now?"


In an instant, the area outsíde the venue fell silent.
###Chapter 17

The jewelry appraisal event this time had gathered the top five jewelers in the world, with only ten invites handed out globally.

The invitation itself was set with a massive twenty-carat sapphire, worth up to 3 million dollars.


The person checking the invites was a top-tier jewelry appraiser,so there was no room for mistakes.


When Emily handed over her invite, the whole place buzzed with whispers and gossip.

Those who had just mocked Emily suddenly went silent, like they'd been slapped from a distance.

Of the ten invitations worldwide, James had one in his hands, while the rest belonged to various royal families around the globe. Someone wondered,'Is she connected to royalty?'

Emily was oblivious to the crowd's shock. Actually, she was the one who designed the invite, and the sapphire on it was thanks to her wealthy teacher.

James watched her hand over the invite, his mind engaged in thought.

Neither the Johnson family nor the Williams family were quaified to get this invite. Veda's face turned pale. After her invite was verified, Emily walked straight into the venue.With this invite, she could take any piece of jewelry from the venue, no matter its value! Emily wasn't in a rush to find James; she wandered around the venue instead.


There were many precious gemstones this time, some worth hundreds of millions of dollars, all from private collections.


James wasn't interested in these, chilling with a few rich guys in the lounge area.


A staff member brought him drinks and pastries, and he took a few casual bites.


Veda watched from the side. Every move James made exuded an air of detachment and nobility, showing true aristocratic demeanor.

After mentaly prepping herself, Veda slowly walked over with a smie and extended her hand to James. "Mr. Smith, I'm the Director of Design at the Williams Group. I came here to discuss some design matters with you.What kind of designs do you like?"

James stayed silent, causing an awkward moment as Veda's hand remained in mid-air. She reluctantly pulled her hand back.

Veda pressed her lips together, as James commented, "So, does your design department get a new director every day?"

To Veda, his remark carried a hint of sarcasm.

Veda forced a smile and continued, "I just joined the company. It's normal you don't know me. I'll be handling the design drafts from now on."

Veda handed him the design drafts. Seeing James not taking them, she placed them on the table next to him. The next moment. James picked up the drafts, glanced at them, and then tossed them into the trash can. saying flatly, "The Golden Birch Group doesn't need plagiarized works."

Veda's face instantly turned extremely ugly. She wished she could find a place to hide immediately. Luckily, not many people were looking at her now.

She took a deep breath and said, "Mr. Smith, are you mistaken? These design drafts are all my own work."

James lightly tapped the table with his fingertips. "Do you think I'm a fool?17


Veda shook her head,sweat forming on her forehead.

She was in a tough spot. She wanted to explain, but James cut her off coldly."I saw this design a few days ago. If you want to show you didn't plagiarize. don't you think you should have a face-to-face with the other designer?"

Veda was stunned. How did he see it?

James glanced at his assistant, who got the hint immediately. A minute later, Emily, dressed in formal attire, came over to James. She looked at Veda, who seemed frustrated, and knew that James had dlone something.

She raised an eyebrow and asked, "Mr. Smith, what's going on?" James gestured towards the trash can. Emily picked up the discarded drafts, glanced at them, and said, "Isn't this the design draft you rejected me for? What's wrong..." When Emily saw the signature below, her lips tightened,and she chuckled."It got dirty from touching the trash, so it's unusable now. Mr. Smith,what kind of design do you like? I can redesign one for you."

Veda's face turned somewhat pale. She looked at Emily with some dissatisfaction. "Emily, why are you targeting me?"

Emily innocently looked at her. "I just said these drafts got dirty. How is that targeting you?"

Veda was speechless in an instant.

At this moment, Eric Allen, sitting next to James, spoke up, "Ms. Emily Johnson, having received an invitation, you must also be skilled at appraising jewelry,right?"

Eric looked at Emily with excitement, completely ignoring James's increasingly gloomy expression.

Emily smiled lightly. "I'm not a professional, but I do know a thing or two."


Her ability to appraise jewelry was taught to her by Hayden.

When Emily was young, the Johnson family members didn't like her except for John. So she enjoyed hanging out with the Williams family and learning from Hayden.

John didn't like looking at stones all day, but Emily found it interesting because she didn't have to interact with people. "It got dirty from touching the trash, so it's unusable now. Mr. Smith,what kind of design do you like? I can redesign one for you."

Veda's face turned somewhat pale. She looked at Emily with some dissatisfaction. "Emily, why are you targeting me?"

Emily innocently looked at her. "I just said these drafts got dirty. How is that targeting you?"

Veda was speechless in an instant.

At this moment, Eric Allen, sitting next to James, spoke up, "Ms. Emily Johnson, having received an invitation, you must also be skilled at appraising jewelry,right?"

When Emily was young, the Johnson family members didn't like her except for John. So she enjoyed hanging out with the Williams family and learning from Hayden.

John didn't like looking at stones all day, but Emily found it interesting because she didn't have to interact with people. So Hayden almost treated Emily as his successor. Even when Emily was fifteen, Hayden took her to gamble on stones. But it was ultimately more like gambling, so Hayden gradually stopped letting her go. But her skills were still there. At this point, Eric chimed in, "Mr. Smith can also appraise jewelry. Why don't you compare your skills? How about gambling on stones? There are many good pieces today; let's see who can unearth the most valuable one,shall wwe?"

Emily noticed that James's friends liked to stir up trouble. She looked at James and raised an eyebrow,exuding confidence.

James had never seen Emily like this before. The most he had seen of Emily was when she was undressed.

Emily tossed her hair and smiled at James, saying softly, "Mr. Smith, if we're going to gamble, shouldn't there be stakes?"

James looked at her faintly.

Emily wanted to provoke him, smiling confidently. "Are you afraid to compete?"


Eric laughed. "You're underestimating Mr. Smith. He has never lost in stone gambling at North Starry Capital."


Emily raised an eyebrow, her red lips slightly parted, "Interpersonal relationships in North Starry Capital don't work well in Emerald City."

She was pointing out publicly that winning in North Sarry Capital was only because others were considerate of the status of James, not because of his ability!


The people present fell silent, feeling Emily was truly bold and courageous.
###Chapter 18

A bunch of folks headed to the room where the stones were kept, and it was buzzing with activity. Some stones had already been cracked open, but they were just your run-of-the-mill gems.

Some people left disappointed, while others stuck around, hopeful.

No one knew what was inside an uncut rough stone. If it turned out to be vibrant and the light shone through it just right, it could be worth a fortune,potentiallymaking the speculator overnight rich.

But if it was dull and not very clear, it would be worthless, maybe even causing the speculator to lose everything.


When James walked in, the staff running the machines noticed him and quickly came over to see what was up.


Eric asked James, "So how does this gambling work? Is it all or nothing with just one stone?"


James replied calmly, "Eric, you be the judge."

Emily glanced at James, who looked sharp in his suit, with an air of confidence like he was in control of everything.

Emily slowly looked away, eyeing the strange stones nearby,and said,"Mr.Smith,you go first."

James didn't hesitate, his eyes scanned the room, and he pointed casually."That one."

The staff brought over the stone, which was kind of black. But with green streaks running through it, maybe it was jadeite. James told the staff to cut it open. The staff, a bit shaky, used the machine to cut it, and everyone wvatched anxiously.

When the patterns in the stone were revealed, everyone was stunned.

Eric exclaimed, "James, it's mauve jadeite!"

Mauve jadeite was usually of poor quality and lost its shine in the light,but this piece was pretty standard, except it didn't have the green color to make it the popular 'Spring with Color.' Still, it was very valuable.

Eric's eyes lit up. "A piece of mauve jadeite this big must be worth millions,right?"

Everyone was shocked. Just a random pick turned out to be mauve jadeite.All eyes then turned to Emily.

Veda hesitated for a moment, walked up to Emily, and gently tugged at her sleeve. "Emily, let's not gamble, okay? You shouldn't do this just to get Mr. Smith's attention without reaI skills."

Emily gave her a cold look, slowly pulling her arm back. Veda's words really put her on the spot.

There were many superior jadeites, but with over a hundred raw stones here, it was unlikely to pick one of equal value.

Suddenly,everyone was looking at Emily with a hint of regret in their eyes.


The staff hesitated. This raw stone had been sitting for two months witho Emily accepted the compliments gracefully, then turned to James and asked,"Mr. Smith, about the stake you mentioned earlier..." James raised an eyebrow. "I just agreed to gamble with you. When did I ut being sold.

But Emily was sure. "Open it."

As the raw stone was cut open, everyone's eyes widened instantly. It was the purest and most intense purple in the purple gemstone category,known as Royal Purple. It was very rare, with extremely high collectible value. Most importantly, it was more prestigious than mauve jadeite.

Everyone gasped in amazement.

Emily chuckled and said to James, "Mr. Smith, looks like you lost to me this time.What do you think?"

Immediately, a crowd gathered around Emily, bombarding her with questions. "Ms. Johnson, who taught you? How did you pick such a big piece of Royal Purple?"

Emily smiled warmly. "My grandfather, Hayden Williams, taught me."

The Williams family had made their fortune through stone gambling.Hayden had never lost a bet on stones. Those who wasn't in the jewelry business might not know him.

The whole place erupted in excitement.

Veda watched Emily being surrounded by everyone, her expression souring. But even if she was upset, she couldn't say anything right now. promise you a stake?"

Emily's smile faltered for a moment. Looking at James' somewhat mischievous face, she was reminded of his teasing nature in bed.


Every time in bed, James would slowly rub his hardness against her vagina,making Emily beg him to go faster.


The naughty images flashed in her mind, making Emily blush and clench her teeth.


Eric frowned and spoke up for Emily, "James, isn't that unfair? Ms.Johnson just wants to discuss design drafts with you. Why are you being so difficult?"


A hint of annoyance flashed in James'eyes as he shrugged off Eric's hand from his shoulder, coldly saying, "I don't like being manipulated."

James glanced at his friends. "If any of you tell her anything, don't bother coming to see me again!"

That was harsh. Eric frowned, looking surprised, but was pulled back by someone beside him, who shook their head. It was better not to cross James right now.

Everyone was curious why James was so angry. He had never spoken such harsh words for any other woman before. And Emily had no relationship with him. Plus, James wasn't usually this petty. With James' warning, the men who had been surrounding Emily backed off a bit. It wasn't worth getting on James' bad side for her. Seeing Emily being shunned, Veda suddenly felt better. Even Emily's beauty had its moments of failure. Since James didn't want to discuss, Emily didn't stay long at the venue.She and Veda returned to the company one after the other.


During the lunch meeting, John was in a good mood,his voice cheerful."Mr. Smith wants us to send Ms. Johnson to Golden Birch Group tomorrow to discuss the design draft details."


Emily was slightly taken aback. She had just been turned down, and now James agreed?

Someone asked, "Which Ms.Johnson?"

At the mention, everyone's eyes focused on Emily and Veda.

While Emily was still processing, Veda spoke softly, "Mr. Williams,it's me who negotiated it."

"I heard that at the venue, Ms. Emily Johnson offended Mr. Smith, so it must be Ms. Veda Johnson who got Mr. Smith's approval."

John heard someone praising Veda and smiled proudly. "Veda, I knew you wouldn't disappoint me."

Then he cast a cold glance at Emily, the disdain in his eyes clear.

 ###Chapter 19

The meeting wrapped up after a couple of hours. With Veda and James finally seeing eye to eye, even the folks who initially doubted Veda were starting to come around. Emily didn't really care about that.

Back in the design department, Nora and the crew came over to congratulate Veda.

"Ms. Johnson, you're incredible! How'd you manage to deal with someone as tough as Mr. Smith?"


"No wonder you snagged first prize in jewelry design back in college. You're way better than some of those airheads."

"From now on, it's Ms. Veda Johnson for us."

Veda felt a bit bashful with all the praise, blushing as she smiled and said."As long as the design's good, Mr. Smith's not that hard to handle.Tonight's on me. Let's hit up the Skyline Club for some fun."

The Skyline Club was a swanky spot, only for the rich and famous. Even the cheapest private room would cost at least half a million bucks for a night. This was truly a money pit!

They were all just regular folks, making maybe fifteen grand a month at best. Hearing Veda's offer, they were all pumped to check out such a fancy place.

Veda soaked up the compliments, enjoying every bit of it. She turned to Emily with a confident smile. "Emily, let's go out tonight." Emily,leaning on her desk with her eyes half-closed, casually replied," Sure,let's do it."

At the Skyline Club, Veda handed her card to the waiter outside.

The waiter took one look at it and respectfully led them in, taking them to a huge private room loaded with all sorts of entertainment.

The massive swimming pool had everyone gasping in awe.

"Ms. Johnson, your family's something else. You even have a membership here."


Veda smiled modestly. "It's not from my family, it's a gift from my boyfriend."


She glanced at Emily, hoping for a reaction, but Emily's face remained indifferent, leaving Veda feeling a bit let down.

Someone asked Veda curiously, "Ms. Johnson, who's your boyfriend? Can you introduce us?"


Veda replied shyly, "He doesn't like crowds. He's been swamped with work lately, so he probably won't make it tonight."

Nora looked at Emily and suddenly asked, "Ms. Johnson,you always call Emily so affectionately. Are you two real sisters?"


Veda smiled and shook her head, starting to say, "Emily wasn't around much when she was young..." Emily couldn't be bothered to explain and instead said, "Since Veda impressed James, how about we celebrate with a drink?"

She handed the tablet for ordering to Veda.

Veda smiled and said, "Order whatever you want."

The electronic menu was all in English with no prices listed. Some couldn't understand it, so it ended up back in Emily's hands without anyone ordering.

Raising an eyebrow, Emily asked, "Don't you guys want a drink?"

Veda replied calmly, "Emily, you go ahead and order."

Emily then placed the order and handed the tablet back to Veda with a smirk. "Let's see if you can afford it."


Veda was caught off guard. Just as she was about to take the tablet, Nora chimed in, "Emily, who are you to belittle others? Ms. Veda Johnson can definitely cover a few drinks."

Everyone joined in, praising Veda, who felt a bit smug and didn't take the tablet. Instead, she said, "Emily, don't worry. Dad gave me his card."

Emily narrowed her eyes, thinking, 'Is Veda trying to show off?'

After a few rounds of drinks, the table was littered with bottles, and a couple of girls even ordered male escorts. Everyone was having a blast,ordering more drinks with the escorts keeping them company.

By the time they were done, it was almost three in the morning,and it was time to-settle the bill. When the manager brought the bill, Veda's eyes widened. Thirteen million dollars! She instinctively looked at the manager, asking, "Why is it so expensive?"

She hadn't drunk much, buit she was a bit stunned at the moment.

She thought it would be at most six hundred thousand dollars. The pocket money Aiden and Mia gave her was more than enough.

But she never expected it to be this much, and it made her feel dizzy.She took the bill and almost fainted on the spot.

Thirty bottles of wine cost nearly six million dollars, along with some food,male escorts, and the private room for the night, all added up to two million dollars.


Veda instantly looked at Emily, who was leisurely drinking, her voice trembling. "Emily, why did you order such expensive things? Why did you embarrass me?"


This reverse accusation made Emily laugh. Anyone could see that Veda couldn't afford it.

Nora directly said, "Emily, even if you are jealous of your sister,you shouldn't deceive her like this, righnt?"

"Yeah. Going for so many pricey things,that's pretty vain of you."

"Have you never seen money before?"

Spending over ten million dollars in one night was equivalent to burning money. Emily lazily leaned back on the sofa, continued drinking, and with a mocking smile, looked at Veda, "When you brought us here, you were so confident. Why blame others now that you can't pay? I showed you the menu, but you didn't look at it yourself. And now you blame me.Sorry, I don't accept your moral blackmail."

Veda bit her lip lightly, feeling a bit wronged, her face also turning somewhat pale.

Nora stiffened her neck and said, "Ms. Veda Johnson is your sister.Shouldn't you help your sister? Do you have any humanity at all?"

Emily smiled faintly. "We're not real sisters, so why should I help her?"

Nora was left speechless by the rebuttal.

Someone unwillingly said, "Even if you're not real sisters,you've lived together for over a decade. Don't you have any sympathy at all?"

Emily smiled, but her tone was cold. "Since you all care so much about her,let's go Dutch. After all, you all enjoyed it too."

As soon as they heard about going Dutch,everyone fell silent.

Going Dutch meant that each person would have to pay over a hundred thousand dollars, which was worse than just killing them!
###Chapter 20

They all went quiet, eyes glued to Veda, who was turning red with embarrassment.


She balled up her fists, her lips pressed tight.

Then someone piped up, "Ms. Veda Johnson, don't you have a rich boyfriend? Why not hit him up for help?"

They couldn't cough up over a million bucks each.

The manager stood off to the side, frowning, his eyes getting colder.thinking they were all just pretending to be loaded.

Veda slowly pulled out her phone, staring at John's number, but couldn't bring herself to call.

Most of John's money was tied up in overseas investments. He was back because he needed the Williams family's help with some minor business issues.


But he couldn't just ask for money, so he joined the Williams Group to work. Now, Veda wasn't sure if he had that kind of cash on hand.


But with everyone staring at her, she had no choice but to grit her teeth and step outside to make the call. When John heard she had blown ten million dollars on a trip, he was furious. "Veda! What are you doing? That's ten million dollars, not a hundred!" John felt his heart ache. Veda couldn't tell her family about this, biting her lip, her voice soft and upset.

"I didn't mean to. I thought we had the deal with Mr. Smith in the bag.so I took them out to celebrate. I just didn't expect Emily to order so much out of spite."

Hearing Emily's name, John got even more irritated. "Wait for me; I'll be there in ten minutes."


John rushed over to pay the bill first. As the ten million dollars left his account, he felt like his heart was bleeding.


He stormed into the private room, and everyone inside was stunned to see him.


John's icy stare landed on Emily. "You, come with me."

Emily lazily got up and followed him out.

After they left, Nora looked at Veda, her eyes wide. "Ms. Johnson, is your boyfriend Mr.Williams?"


John was the heir to the Williams family, set to inherit the whole company.

Veda blushed. "Yes, but we're keeping it under wraps for now."

Someone else asked, "Does Mr. Williams know Emily too?" The employees invited to tonight's dinner were all new employees who had no idea about John's relationship with Emily and Veda. The way John had stormed in, it looked like he was ready to kill Emily. Veda tucked her hair behind her ear and said softly, "The three of us went to the same middle school. We grew up together."

Nora sneered. "Ms. Johnson, you can't fully understand Emily's thoughts and true intentions, so be careful."


Veda just smiled.

Meanwhile, John stopped Emily at the corner of the hallway. He took a deep breath and warned her, "Didn't I tell you not to mess with Veda?Why do you always forget? I let her work at the company. If you have a problem,come after me!"

Emily smirked. "You're upset over losing some money? What you did to me three years ago was way worse. Compared to you guys, what I did was just a little prank."

Originally, as long as they stayed out of each other's way, Emily wouldn't have bothered. But they kept pushing her buttons, and she couldn't take it anymore.

John took a deep breath, trying to keep his cool. "Emily! What right do you have to accuse us? Weren't you the one who betrayed me first?"

He looked at Emily's beautiful face, feeling nothing but disgust.

He grabbed her shoulders and pinned her against the wall,his voice icy."Why did you disappear six years ago? Why did you go to the gynecologist?Are you really a virgin? Why should I put up with this and accept you?Emily, do you dare to tell me what happened during those days?"
Emily's face went pale, her nails digging into her palms, drawing blood.John shouldn't know about that.

Seeing her trembling and scared, John smirked mockingly. "Do you dare tell me who you were with during those days? Who was that guy? Or how many guys were there?"

Emily's eyes turned cold. She slapped John hard, her hand shaking.

"John, shut up! You're the last person who should be accusing me!"

John touched his face, licked his teeth, and sneered. "Emily, you've been seducing men with your looks since you were a kid. You'rea born slut!"

He went on, "Your biological parents thought you were dirty and untamable, so they abandoned you. You stayed with the Williams family for three years because you had nowhere else to go."

Emily's eyes were bloodshot. "John, enough."

Her body was shaking uncontrollably.

She had a huge secret buried deep in her heart, one she couldn't forget.Now John was bringing it all up.

She had always thought John fell for Veda because she was obedient,but now she realized he had known her secret all along. This was why he suddenly stopped loving her.

Emily closed her eyes, unable to cry since her eyes were dry. Emily had tried to convince herself that what happened during those days was just a nightmare. Apart from some physical marks and the torture of being imprisoned, the rest was a blank in her mind. She pushed John away hard and turned to leave, just as Veda came out of the private room. Emily gave Veda a long look as she walked past her. Veda looked at John and asked, "John, it seems like Emily's about to cry.Did you scold her?"

John was annoyed. "No, just told her some truths."

Veda's face changed slightly, but she quickly hid it. There was a hint of reproach in her voice. "You promised me you'd keep it a secret forever.Emily's already been through a lot. Why did you do this?"

John frowned. "She needs to learn a lesson."

Veda lowered her head, her long hair falling to hide the unease in her eyes.
###Chapter 21

Emily stumbled as she walked.

After leaving the Skyline Club, she hopped into a taxi. Feeling a bit woozy,she leaned against the window. When the driver asked where she was headed,she mumbled a few places before finally mentioning the villa area where Crystal Valley Manor was.

The scenery outside the window was a blur. Emily half-closed her eyes,her gaze unusually clear.

The events of six years ago were Emily's secret. She hadn't told anyone.But the way John questioned her tonight clearly indicated that he had known for a long time.

Emily thought, 'Did he find out when he hooked up with Veda?'

Emily kept replaying the details of John and Veda in her mind.

After she had been rescued, although her memory of that time was fuzzy,the physical injuries were still there. She couldn't sleep properly for three months. Every time she closed her eyes, nightmares filled her mind.

During those months, Emily never saw John. And when she finally recovered, she got the news that John was with Veda.
 
Being betrayed by John was the deepest pain. According to Mia, John had been with Veda those three months. Did Veda tell him? Emily clenched her fists, looked down at her phone, and messaged a person with a pure black profile picture: [Investigate Veda and John.] Due to Emily's memory loss, there had never been a conclusion to the events of that year. She never expected that there were people around her who knew about it.

Crystal Valley Manor

After the car stopped, Emily stumbled out. To her surprise,the lights in the living room were still on.

Emily's gaze flickered slightly. She opened the door and crossed the garden.

As soon as she entered the living room, she took off her high heels,walked barefoot on the floor, and slowly made her way upstairs.

James walked out of the study upon hearing the noise. Emily looked visibly disoriented, and the smell of alcohol on her body was not surprising, causing him to pause slightly.

James frowned. "Emily, have you been drinking?"

Emily slowly raised her eyelids, looking at James standing on the steps, in a black shirt and pants, with the collar casually unbuttoned, revealing his delicate collarbones.

She climbed two more steps with slightly red eyes. James was about to speak when Emily suddenly tiptoed, leaned in, and pressed her warm, alcohol-scented lips against his. She bit his lips, teasing with her tongue, prying open his teeth and diving in. Emily had never been so bold and proactive before. With her eyes closed and a hint of red at the corners, her fingers undid James's belt, and her soft hands gently grasped his penis. Under her advances, James's breath hitched.


Emily moved up and down, her fingertips lightly brushing over the glans.Feeling the stickiness on her hand, she slowly opened her eyes.

She left his lips, a glistening strand of saliva connecting their mouths as they parted. Emily smiled, unbuttoned her own clothes, and pressed against him again.

She hazily spoke, "James, are you scared?"

James squinted, gaze turning menacing. He instantly lifted Emily up.

With her legs wrapped around his waist, Emily gently rubbed against his slowly awakening penis.

She was wearing panties underneath, and he thrust his hips,trying to push inside.

James grabbed Emily's butt and carried her into the bedroom.

As they sank into the soft sheets, James ripped off Emily's skirt. Her breasts bounced free, and James took a nipple into his mouth, biting it gently.
Emily moaned, her fingers gripping the bedsheet, her breathing ragged.

While playing with her breasts, James's hand slipped into her vaginal opening,which was already wet. He teased her clit with his fingertips, watching Emily's body tremble,her lips biting down on her lower lip,swallowing almost every moan. James wanted to see Emily beg and collapse beneath him.
 
 He kissed Emily's lips, his voice filled with desire as he whispered in her ear."I love hearing your voice. Emily,cry out."

Emily opened her eyes. His penis teased but didn't enter her, stimulating her until her waist went weak. James was definitely doing it on purpose!

Emily took a deep breath and softly said, "Mr. Smith, it's only been a few days without sex. Can't you handle it? Should I go change..."

Before Emily could finish her sentence, James's huge penis forcefully entered her.going deep inside.

Emily cried out. gasping heavily, and James began to move vigorously.

His hips seemed tireless, like they were powered by a motor, thrusting so hard her head almost hit the headboard.

Then James suddenly lifted her, letting Emily straddle his waist. In this position, with her full weight pressing down, his penis went even deeper,and it felt even larger.

Emily felt a bit sore and swollen below. She couldn't help but want more.She tilted her head back, sweat dripping down her slender neck onto her collarbones. James lowered his head, kissing her gently. James always knew how to please her.
James thrust forcefully, the sound of flesh hitting flesh muffled. Not knowing how much time had passed, Emily's voice started to break,and James let out a low growl, climaxing inside her. He laid her down on the bed, wanting to continue, but Emily weakly pushed him away. "That's it. I'm tired." James cove red Emily's mouth,spread her legs, and his fingertips delved into her vagina, squinting slightly. "Is that so? But this time,you provoked me first. I decide when it ends!"


His fingertips teased her, the tender flesh clinging to him tightly.

Emily closed her eyes and wrapped her legs around his waist. When his fingers were about to leave, she squeezed tightly, smiling. "Let's see if you get tired tonight."

Emily was in a bad mood today, coupled with drinking quite a bit, her words carried a bold and reckless tone she had never had before.


James squinted, bent her body over. She had studied dance before, her body was flexible, and even a light pinch on her thighs left marks. With just one glance, she looked exceptionally alluring.

James's eyes darkened slightly as he entered her, saying, "Tonight,you won't be getting out of bed."

As they engaged in lovemaking well into the late night, Emily's voice had grown hoarse, and she felt a slight soreness below. She unconsciously pleaded, "James, let me go. Carry me to take a bath."

James bit her lip and said, "Emily, you promised to do it all night,non-stop."
###Chapter 22

The night was late, and the sound of running water echoed from the bathroom.


Emily's head was foggy from the steam, and she felt like she had no control over her body.


James was still inside her, moving slowly in and out.

Emily's body was flushed, her slender fingers pressing against the wall until James grabbed her, kissing her back. His movements became more intense.

Emily couldn't take it anymore and cursed him, "James, you jerk."

"Emily, I'm just trying to please you. Aren't you enjoying it?"

Emily let out a groan, rolling her eyes. In bed, James was such a jerk!

When James carried Emily to bed after their shower, she was so exhausted she couldn't even lift a finger.


The next morning

When James woke up, Emily was already gone.

He heard a car engine outside, walked to the window, and saw Emily driving away from Crystal Valley Manor.


Emily went straight back to the company, where everyone in the design department was gathered around Veda, fawning over her.

Yesterday, Veda had openly announced that her boyfriend was John. It seemed like everyone was treating her as Mrs. Williams already.

Plus, Veda was going to discuss the details of a collaboration with James later, so naturally, most people wanted to flatter her.

Veda was well-prepared for the negotiation with ten design drafts.When Emily approached, she handed the drafts to her and said gently, "Emily,take a look at these. Do you think Mr. Smith will like them?"

Emily just glanced at them indifferently.

Nora, standing nearby, said, "Ms. Johnson, Emily doesn't know Mr. Smith well. Asking her is pointless. Besides, few people like her designs."

Emily narrowed her eyes, crossed her arms, and looked at Nora with interest,saying, "I just happened to meet the founder of Empire Glance a few days ago. She mentioned you provided them with plagiarized designs and refused to correct them, so they don't want to collaborate with us. If I join her in exposing this, I wonder if you can still survive in this industry."
Nora's face stiffened. Everyone in the office heard Emily's words. Being directly exposed for plagiarism left her with no face. Nora wished she could find a place to hide. Everyone knew she plagiarized, but it hadn't caused serious consequences.The founder of Empire Glance, who had a good relationship with Emily,didn't cause trouble for the Williams Group. This gave Nora the illusion that she could get away with it.Emily said flatly, "Plagiarists deserve to be called out. Don't you think so, Veda?"

Bringing up the plagiarism incident made Veda embarrassed. She quickly composed herself, her eyes red, and said, "Emily, I just wanted you to take a look and give me some advice."

Emily chuckled softly, her voice piercing. "My advice is to take your designs and get lost."

Unable to bear it, everyone left with Veda to comfort her.

Emily returned to her office, shut the door, and finally found some peace and quiet.

But it seemed like the chatter outside was intentionally disturbing her peace, as their voices soon drifted back in.

"Ms. Johnson, I bet your work will be on Quigr soon."

Quigr was a jewelry brand under the Golden Birch Group. This collaboration not only involved buying mineral jewelry from the Golden Birch Group but also partnering with Quigr to showcase the Williams Group's brand, Diamond Glow, on the international stage.
"You'll definitely be the only Ms. Johnson in the company in the future. It's like the company has been expanding faster since you arrived." Even Emily couldn't help but laugh mockingly. The Williams Group was really banking on this negotiation with James. If they could finalize the design drafts, they could start promoting and get the jewelry into the market sooner, especially with the upcoming shopping festival. No company would miss this opportunity. So Veda even brought two assistants and prepared drafts to deal with James.

When they arrived at the Golden Birch Group, James's personal assistant,Ryan Martin, came downstairs to greet her.

Veda's assistants were stunned to see this.

"Ms. Johnson, he's a personal assistant. Do you have a good relationship with Mr.Smith?"


Usually,a receptionist could take them upstairs for such negotiations.

Veda was also a bit puzzled. James clearly didn't like her and Emily yesterday, not giving them a good reception. Veda thought, 'Why the sudden change today?

But with her assistants backing her up, she gradually forgot about yesterday. She had already come, and James wouldn't kick her out.

Ryan led her to the meeting room and then went to fetch James.

When James entered the meeting room and saw Veda, his brow furrowed slightly.

Veda delivered the official opening remarks and reached out to shake hands. James didn't move and just looked at her indifferently, the coldness in his eyes surprising Veda.
After a while, she realized thatJames really had no intention of shaking hands,so she awkwardly withdrew her hand. She bit her-lip, then spoke reluctantly, "Mr. Smith, I brought a few new design drafts today, much better than what I showed you yesterday. There must be something you like in them."

Veda tried to hand over the design drafts, but James dropped a bombshell,"Don't fool me with plagiarism."

Veda's assistant wanted to explain, but James directly said, "I never said I was here to negotiate with you. I want to talk to Ms. Johnson from your design department."

Veda's heart sank.

Finally, the assistant couldn't help but speak, "She is Ms. Johnson."

Veda hoped to show James the designs first, and said, "Yesterday's drafts were a mistake. Today's design drafts will surely impress you."

James just looked at her indifferently and said coldly, "I remember losing to Ms. Johnson in the bet yesterday. I naturally have to pay up. Since you were there at the time, you should be clearer than anyone."

Veda's face stiffened. Before she could say anything, James said directly,"I always keep my word. If the person here today is not the genuine Ms.Johnson, then there's no need to continue the cooperation."
###Chapter 23

As soon as James finished talking,everyone's faces went pale.

The assistant pulled Veda aside and whispered. "Ms. Johnson,this deal is super important for the Williams Group. Should we call your sister?"

James didn't give them a chance to negotiate;he just turned around and left.

Veda felt her hands and feet go cold. Every word James said was like a slap in the face.

The two assistants watched her make a call and whispered, "So it was Emily who impressed Mr. Smith. Veda seemed so eager, I thought it was her."


"Veda wasn't sure herself before."

"Getting called out by Mr. Smith like that, I wonder if he'll cause trouble for our company later."

As Veda called John, she overheard their chatter and felt super embarrassed.

After getting Veda's distressed call, John stormed towards the design department and barged into Emily's office.

On his way, he weighed the pros and cons and realized only Emily could handle this. By the time he reached her office,he had calmed down.

He took a deep breath and ordered, "You need to handle the cooperation."

"Why?" Emily, who was sketching, didn't even look up as she lazily asked.

John's eyes turned cold. "Emily, now's not the time for your tantrums.Go quickly."


Emily nonchalantly raised her head. "This is such a big deal Ms. Veda Johnson volunteered for. If she can secure it, it'll help her esablish herself in the company. John, isn't this what you wanted?"


John was left speechless. His eyes flashed with anger. "Are you trying to embarrass Veda like this? Emily, you really are a piece of work."

Emily's eyes turned cold, her lips tight. and she said with a smile, "Isn't it because she's vain and trying to take credit? Now you're blaming me instead? John, you two really are the perfect couple."

The sarcasm was so sharp it made John's face stiffen.

Emily slowly raised her eyelids, looked at John's frustrated expression, and said with a smile, "You can keep accusing me, but you should also think about how Mr. Smith will react."

Forcing himself to calm down, John gritted his teeth and asked. "What do you want to do?"

"I believe Veda will handle it well, and you don't need to worry."

John's eyes turned cold. James had already made it clear that Emily was indispensable, and she was still unruffled. It was obvious she was out for revenge.

A flash of anger crossed John's eyes as he said coldly, "She will never apologize to you."

Emily lowered her head and continued to draw, her voice calm. "Then it doesn't matter. After all, the Williams Group losing out in the shopping

festival doesn't affect me."

John said fiercely, "Just you wait."

John went outside to call Veda and advised her kindly, "You need to come back and apologize to her first. I know it's tough, but just bear with it this time."


Veda was almost in tears on the other end, but she knew that between the company's interests and herself, John always prioritized the company.
Collaborating with the Golden Birch Group had immense benefits.

Half an hour later, Veda rushedI back. She walked straight into Emily's office,looking red-faced and apologetic, and said with her head down, "Emily, I was wrong. You should prioritize the bigger picture and go to the Golden Birch Group."

Emily looked up, a sardonic smile on her face. "Shouldn't the one prioritizing the bigger picture be you? If you don't have the skills, don't steal credit. Now that you've been rejected, you come to give me a lecture.Veda,do you have no shame?"

Veda had never been scolded to her face. Even if she had taken John away.Emily had never resorted to cursing her out.

The current Emily made her inexplicably flustered. It seemed like Emnily was targeting her. Emily appeared calm, but Veda could sense some hostility in her eyes.

Gritting her teeth, Veda suddenly knelt in front of Emily. "Emily, I was wrong. Please, for the sake of the company, don't take it personally."

As Veda spoke, she was about to bow her head.

Seeing Veda kneel. John was stunned and quickly tried to pull her up."Veda, why are you kneeling to her? She doesn't deserve you kneeling down!"


Emily sat in her chair, legs crossed, her gaze coldly fixed on Veda.

John stood by, reproaching Emily. "Emily, don't go too far. She's your sister! Why are you still asmalicious as before? After so many years in the Williams family, you still haven't learned any decency!"

The commotion in the office was too loud, and with the door open, many people were watching from outside, pointing and whispering about Emily.

Emily looked up, smiled at John, and calmly retorted, "Hayden and Wilder are such principled individuals, yet you still haven't learned any integrity and propriety from them. What right do you haveto accuse me? At least I dare to take responsibility more than you."

John's face was extremely ugly, and he rushed forward to slap Emily.Before his raised hand could come down, Emily caught it.

Standing up, Emily tightened her grip on his wrist, causing John's face to turn pale as he felt his entire arm going numb. He winced in pain.

Emily yanked her hand free from his grip so forcefully that there was a crack, and his hand popped out of joint.

Emily said, "Since you came here to ask me for a favor, I hope both of you can have a better attitude. I don't owe you anything."

The last few words made both of them shudder. What did she mean by not owing?

Emily's tone was firm. "Either apologize sincerely to me, or get out.

Handle the collaboration with the Golden Birch Group? You're on your own. Find someone else!"

No one dared to challenge Emily. Both of them had unpleasant expressions.

Veda was still kneeling on the ground, while Emily sat in her chair,legs crossed, looking down at Veda with a hint of superiority.

Veda knew this wouldn't end easily. She lowered her head, clenched her fists, and through gritted teeth, said, "Emily, aren't you afraid of Mom and Dad finding out?"

Emily laughed. "So what? I can call them right now and let them see what their so-called daughter is like."

The word "daughter" was emphasized by Emily!

Veda tightened her grip. After a moment, John said, "Veda,just apologize."

Although he didn't want Veda to be wronged, there was no other way.

Filled with anger, Veda raised her hand and gave herself a hard slap.
###Chapter 24

"Sis, I messed up.I'm really sorry."

The sound of Veda slapping herself echoed through the room, leaving everyone in shock.

Emily raised an eyebrow. "I don't have a sister."

Veda gritted her teeth, slapped herself again, and said, "Ms. Johnson,I'm sorry.I was wrong."

John looked at Veda with concern. "Veda! You don't have to do this."

John's eyes were filled with worry, but a slight movement caused a sharp pain in his arm. He gritted his teeth and glared at Emily.

"Emily, don't push it!"

Emily rolled her eyes. As she tidied up the design drafts on the table,she glanced at them indifferently. "Veda chose to slap herself as an apology.Am I being too harsh? John, did I say anything wrong?"

John took a deep breath, feeling that the current Emily was like a cactus.She wouldn't have cared about these things before.

Outside the Golden Birch Group building, Ryan saw Emily and smiled,leading her straight to the office.

Veda's two assistants met her in the corridor outside,instinctively wanting to hand the design drafts to Emnily.

"Ms. Johnson, these are the design drafts Veda stayed up all night to draw.Please take them in for Mr. Smith to see."


Even though Veda didn't negotiate with James, if he chose her design drafts, the credit would still go to Veda.

To their surprise, Emily just glanced coldly and said, "No need."

After entering the office, Emily didn't see James right away. She looked at Ryan, confusion written all over her face, but he was already stepping out and closing the door behind him.

At that moment, Emily heard some sounds. It turned out there was a hidden door in James's office.

James came out adjusting his tie. The interior decoration style inside was exactly the same as Crystal Valley Manor.

With his tie half done, James walked up to Emily and sneered. "Running away so fast. Are you that irresponsible?"

Emily reached out to fix his messy tie.

Her fingertips brushed the bite mark on James's neck, her eyes slightly deep, and she chuckled, "You didn't seem to lose out either."

Last night was wild, and she still felt a bit sore. She walked into the hidden room to take a look, which was really exactly the same as Crystal Valley Manor.

Emily raised an eyebrow and joked, "Mr. Smith, do you really like Crystal Valley Manor that much?"

Crystal Valley Manor was decorated entirely according to her preferences.

At this moment, Emily saw James holding a tube of ointment in his hand.He walked towards Emily, embraced her from behind, his fingertips

wandering on her waist, gently lifting her skirt.

Emily frowned and directly pressed James's hand. "I came here today to discuss business with you, not to flirt."

"I applied ointment for you last night, and you need to do it again today."

Emily took the ointment from James's hand, pursed her lips, and said unpleasantly, "Who was the one who didn't show any restraint last night?"

James proudly crossed his arms, laughing recklessly. "Who was so proactive last night?"

Emily took a deep breath and went to the bathroom to apply the ointment.
It did feel more comfortable, and she discussed the issue of the drafts with James after coming out.

James had high demands for the design drafts, pointing out a few details.Emily planned to leave and make the revisions, but James directly handed her a laptop. "Make the revisions right here in my office, and I'll review them directly."

Thinking she might run into John and Veda back at the company, Emily figured it was more peaceful to stay with James, so she agreed.

Since people kept coming in to deliver files to James, Emily hesitated for a moment but eventually went to the hidden room.

Soon, Emily heard voices outside; James was being interviewed by reporters.

Then her phone buzzed with a live broadcast notification. Emily opened the page, and the flood of comments on the screen left her utterly helpless.

[Oh my god! No one told me Mr. Smith was so handsome! He's definitely my type!]

[I need all the info on this guy.]

[Oh my god! Is he married? I want to marry him!]

The number of viewers in the live stream skyrocketed fom just a few thousand to over a million in just five minutes, and it was still climbing.Emily couldn't help but think these viewers were really just there for James's looks.

In high definition, James's face was flawless.

Initially, the questions were about economics and business. After listening to James's insights for a while, Emily couldn't help but admire him. He truly deserved to be the CEO of the Golden Birch Group.

After all the business questions were asked, a bold journalist asked, "Mr.Smith,do you have a family or a girlfriend?"

James thought for a moment and said, "Neither."

Emily raised an eyebrow, suddenly feeling that drawing design drafts was pointless. She lay on the bed, waiting for the next question.

Over the years, the only woman around James had been her, but Emily was indeed not his girlfriend. They weren't even lovers.

Seeing that James didn't reject the question, the journalist got bolder. "So,Mr. Smith, what kind of girl do you like?"

He seemed-to be thinking seriously, contemplating his words. A smile tugged at the corner of his lips, but he quickly suppressed it and said,"I

like girls who cry easily and are afraid of the dark."

Emily's heart fluttered. So James did have a girl he liked.

She had never thought that James would like her. In the years they had been together, she had never cried outside of the bed, nor had she ever been afraid of the dark.


It seemed that being with her was just for the fun of being taken care of.

[So Mr. Smith likes the type of girl who is weak and vulnerable?]

[I'm a crybaby, and I'm afraid of the dark too. Please protect me,Mr.Smith.]

[Are you guys stupid? It's just that the girl he likes happens to cry and is afraid of the dark.]

[Being liked by Mr. Smith must be very happy.]

The journalist continued, "Is Mr. Smith currently pursuing her?”

James casually replied, "There are people who like herlining up from Emerald City to the other side of the world, and I'm just one of those waiting my turn overseas."

Everyone was curious about how outstanding the girl was. As the journalist was about to ask more questions, James glanced at the time and calmly said, "Time's up."

Immediately after, Ryan came in to escort the reporters out. For the viewers, the last five minutes of the one-hour live broadcast were the most exciting.

Emily thought the girl James liked must be a top socialite in the circle.

After all. when it came to that girl. James's eyes were clearly overly gentle.
###Chapter 25

Even after the live broadcast ended, people couldn't stop talking about James.

[Even Mr. Smith is chasing after a girl? Wow, that girl must be so lucky.]

[With a face like Mr. Smith's, what girl wouldn't like him?]

Emily saw the comments and her curiosity piqued. She walked out and saw James organizing files. "Mr. Smith, I wanted to interview you. Does the girl you like know you have a crush on her?" she asked.

James looked at her coolly. "What do you think?"

Emily shrugged. He didn't seem keen on talking about it, but she wasn't too curious anyway.

James poured himself a cup of water, his throat dry from the interview.He glanced at Emily. "Are you curious because you're jealous?"

Emily shook her head, leaning on his desk with a slight squint. "I just don't want the man I support and sleep with to have unclear relationships with others. If that girl comes to me, I really can't explain."

James licked his dry lips, grabbed Emily's arm, and pulled her in abruptly."You really have no conscience."

Emily pushed him away. "I have a meeting this afternoon. I'll go back to the office to work on the design draft and give it to you tomorrow morning."

James grabbed her again. "Stay and have lunch with me."
Emily stared at him for a moment, then reluctantly made up a reason to tell John that the negotiation had gone wrong and she decided not to go back to the office in the afternoon.
It was just lunchtime, and Ryan had already prepared the meal, which arrived shortly after they finished talking.

After eating for a while, Emily suddenly laughed.

James looked up at her. "What's so funny?"

Emily tilted her head. "This is the first time we've had lunch together,right?"
They rarely spent a whole day together. Most of the time, Emily would go to Crystal Valley Manor at night and leave early in the morning. Having breakfast together was a luxury.
James glanced at her indifferently, served Emily some soup,and said,"Because you only see me as a human vibrator."
Emily choked on her food, tears almost coming out from coughing. The atmosphere instantly became awkward.
Emily's face blushed. She glared at James. "If you insist on comparing yourself to a human vibrator, I can't helpit."

"And how do you explain last night then?"

Talking about last night's events in the office made Emily completely blush.She felt heat rising on her face, as if she was being roasted.
After calming down, Emily explained, "I was a bit irritated last night and had been drinking, so I was completely out of it. It won't happen again."
James raised an eyebrow. "So I deserved to be slept with by you?"


Emily fell silent.

James said. "Emily, be my girlfriend."

For a moment. Emnily thought she must have heard him wrong. After regaining her composure, she said, "I'm married."
James smiled mockingly. "Your so-called marriage to John is a joke."


Emily was surprised. "You know everything?"

With James's status, he would definitely have thoroughly investigated her marriage to John.
James lost his appetite, put down his utensils, and looked at the person sitting across from him. He said calmly, "You both don't love each other.Don't you find it ridiculous to waste time on someone who disgusts you?You might as well choose someone else. And I think we're quite suitable."
James stared deeply at Emily, his eyes like the deep sea,pulling her in with just one glance. Emily's expression gradually turned strange.
James noticed and calmly added, "We're especially compatible in bed."


Emily smirked, "Want to cut the line now?"

James rolled his eyes, silently cursing her for being heartless.

She joked with a smile, "Mr. Smith, your skills in bed are indeed impressive."
James tightened his lips. With so mnany good qualities, Emily only remembered his skills in bed. Emily wasn't full, but she couldn't eat anymore. She looked directly at James and said. "If you want to keep this going, I have one condition.James, we don't talk about feelings or benefits. We don't interfere in each other's private lives. When either of us starts liking someone else, our relationship ends."
James was slightly dissatisfied. "So you just want my body?"

Emily nodded. "Feelings are too troublesome. Once you have them, there will be all kinds of expectations. If these expectations aren't met, it turns into enmity. I hope we can part ways decently in the end." She and John had lived together for so long, and in the end, they ended up hating each other. People's hearts changed easily. She wouldn't give anyone the chance to hurt her again.
James's eyes remained cold, and his brows furrowed gradually. He was very dissatisfied.
Emily casually spread out her hands. "If you're not satisfied, then forget it.I won't force it."

"I agree. You move into Crystal Valley Manor today."

Emily looked at James with some surprise. For James, tFor James,such a condition was somewhat of an insult.
She blinked, shook her head slowly. "Oh my god, I have to deal with some other things first before I can move in."

This time, James didn't say anything.
After lunch, Emily took a nap in James's study, worked on the sketches,and had dinner with him. Then she went back to the Williams Mansion. Hayden was making coffee in the living room. Emily reminded, "Hayden,the doctor said you shouldn't drink too much coffee."
Hayden coughed lightly. "I'm just brewing it. It's all for you guys."

Emily sat across from Hayden, had a cup of coffee, chatted briefly, then went upstairs to pack her things. Today, she planned to move out of the Williams Mansion.
In fact, over the years, although she had her own room at the Williams Mansion, she didn't come back often.
Everyone knew that she and John didn't have a good relationship,especially after the wedding where John was absent. She felt awkward in front of the Williams family.
But Emily knew clearly that apart from John, the Williams family treated her well and protected her.
She even thought that if John never came back, staying with the Williams family wouldn't be bad. But John did come back, with Veda.
Every time she saw those two, she felt extremely disgusted. Emily and John were now like two parallel lines that would never intersect.
So it was time for Emily to be reckless for once.

Just as she was deep in thought, the bedroom door suddenly burst open.

John stormed in. Upon seeing Emily, he walked up and kicked her luggage aside.

Emily shouted, "John! What's gotten into you?"
###Chapter 26







John's voice dripped with anger.
Emily was stunned for a moment, then slowly got up and asked, "Is Veda dead? If she is, then I can throw a party."
John couldn't believe her lack of remorse, her shamelessness.

"Veda's your sister. You've been at each other's throats since you were kids.Do you really want her dead now?"
Emily was done explaining herself to John. She smirked and mocked him.

John's anger flared, but he held back from slapping her, remembering how she stood up to him today.
He said, "And it's not just that. You've always tried to outdo me. I got into stone gambling, and you followed Grandpa to learn. You mastered it in three days, picking stones worth millions."
He went on, "I got into racing, and you followed. On the track, you smoked me!"
He added, "At ten, you were doing my homework and writing top-notch papers,yet you stiIl ended up at the same high school as me. Emily, are you trying to show everyone you're better than me?"
"From childhood till now, you've been scheming. You have left a dark shadow on my psyche, and seeing you makes me sick!" John finally


shouted.
Emily listened quietly to his rant. Sure, she could write papers at ten,but she just wantedI to grow up with John, which is why she went to the same high school with him.
She got into stone gambling and racing because those were John's interests,and she wanted to spend more time with him.
What she remembered as a cherished childhood connection,John saw as nothing more than a lingering shadow cast over his soul. She was someone he found disgusting.
But now, Emily felt explaining was pointless. She sighed and said, "You won't believe me no matter wwhat I say because all you see is Veda now. So,John, let's just part ways."
It was then that John noticed she was packing.

He sneered, "Are you playing hard to get now?"

Emily only had some clothes and jewelry at the mansion. She finished packing and zipped her bag.
She walked up to John, calmly saying, "IIl explain everything to them later.



Just then, the butler called them for dinner. Emily carried her suitcase downstairs.
Seeing this, Calliope asked, "Emily, are you going on a business trip?"

With everyone gathered at the dining table, Emily spoke seriously,"Grandpa, Mom,Dad, I have something to tell you."
Everyone was puzzled; Emily rarely looked this serious.

Emily smiled slightly. "Thanks for taking care of me all these years. I've decided to move out and live on my own."
Everyone was shocked. Wilder saw John coming down and immediately punched him. "Did you mess with Emily again? I've been away from the company for a few days, and you brought Veda in. Do you think you run the place? Tomorrow, get Veda out of the company, or you're leaving with her!"
Calliope looked at Wilder in surprise. "Is this true?"

Calliope and Wilder immediately started giving John a joint beating. The scene was both funny and ridiculous.
Out of breath from chasing John, Calliope demanded, "Apologize to Emily right now!"
John, with his lips tightly pursed, didIn't think he had done anything wrong.
Emily stopped Calliope. "Mom, actually, John and I were never really married."

Everyone was momentarily shocked again.

Emily explained slowly, "When John and I were in the middle of our marriage registration, he was called away by Veda. But he didn't want to upset you, so we decided to buy fake marriage certificates online."
With just a few words, she laid everything out. The living room fell into a tense silence. After a few seconds, Calliope accepted the truth, feeling that Emily not marrying John was probably for the best.




Emily hurriedly held Calliope, patting her back to calm her down.

"Mom, since he has chosen Veda, there's no point in me clinging on."

That day outside the Royal Venue, even if she had shown everyone a marriage certificate, it would have just humiliated herself. John's choice had always been Veda.
In this moment, Emily's once numb heart seemed to feel a dull pain.

She had truly loved John with all her heart. But that was all in the past.

There was a clear slap mark on John's face. He never thought Emily was serious this time. He thought, 'Is she forcing me to choose between her and Veda?' He looked at Emily with a dark expression.
Emily calmly said, "Dad, Mom, John is an adult now. He doesn't have to like me."
Calliope said, "But you grew up together from childhood, with such deep feelings. I always treated you as my daughter-in-law."
Emily just smiled. John and Veda were the ones who truly had deep feelings.
"Grandpa, Mom, Dad, even if I leave the Williams Mansion, you will always be my family in my heart."
Her biological parents did not give her the love and care she needed,butJohn's parents did. They unconditionally favored Emily, giving her the best of everything. When she was first brought back, there was no welcoming party for her to return to the family. Her parents thought she was not presentable. Finally,after much effort, they held a party, but Emily showed up in tattered clothes, becoming the laughingstock of everyone.
It was Calliope who took Emily to change into a beautiful princess dress and introduced her to the wealthy guests downstairs, declaring her as the true daughter of the Johnson family and she would become Mrs. Williams of the Williams family in the future.
Just with the title of Mrs. Williams, everyone present had to respect her.

Calliope also said that if Emily ever felt unhappy at the Johnson Mansion,she could come to the Williams Mansion to find her. So her timeat the Williams Mansion was longer than at the Johnson Mansion. In Emily's heart,Calliope was her real mother.
Reluctant to see Emily leave, Calliope hugged her, tears streaming down her face, saying, "It's good that you're leaving. You don't have to waste any more time on John. If anyone bullies you in the future, just say you are the daughter of the Williams family. If the Johnson family doesn't care for you,I will."
Emily was amused by her words and nodded. "You are my mother; of course you should care for me."
###Chapter 27

Calliope shot John a glare and spat,"You jerk!"

Emily chimed in, "Dad, Mom, there's more. Veda was pregnant before and then jumped from upstairs, losing the baby. John feels guilty about it."

Calliope's eyes widened in shock. Compared to Emily and John not getting married, Veda's pregnancy was a bigger bombshell.

John's face turned dark. Emily wasn't really trying to break up with him;she was just playing games. So manipulative!

Even though Veda's baby was gone, it still made the Williams family feel disgusted.

Calliope stormed over and slapped John again, her hand shaking this time."No wonder Emily doesn't want to be with you. She's amazing, and you don't deserve her! John, Emily's done with you! And take your mistress and get out of the Williams Mansion!"

Emily was taken aback by Calliope's words,feeling a bit touched.

John was fuming, his voice tight with anger. "Mom! I'mn your son. Why are you so unfair? And Veda was carrying a Williams family baby!"

Calliope snapped, "I don't acknowledge it!"

While Calliope was tearing into John, Wilder and Hayden stayed silent.Emily always knew Calliope had a lot of sway in the Williams family.

Calliope took a deep breath and said, "Veda took away the family that should havē been Emily's. Emily's been more than forgiving. Even if Veda begged for forgiveness now, it wouldn't be too much. How can you be so
blind to right and wrong, with no conscience!"

For over twenty years, it seemed like Emily had nothing. John was always absent,so Calliope felt she owed Emily.
John said in a low voice, "Emily's suffering wasn't Vedla's fault. If anyone should apologize, it's me, not Vedà."
"What a good son you are, sticking up for her like that. Just wait until you realize your mistake!"

Emily saw Calliope about to hit John again and quickly stopped her."Mom, even though I've left the Williams Mansion, I still want to be your daughter. I'll take care of you."

Calliope held Emily's hand, feeling heartbroken.

Hayden slowly approached John, looking serious. "I told you before, if you don't marry Emily, the company's shares and inheritance will all go to..."

Emily cut in, "Grandpa, the company is your life's work. I don't want it.Besides, it's John who wronged me, not you. You don't need to make it up to me."

Then Emily added, "Grandpa, don't worry. I'm still the head of the design department. I can take care of myself."

Hayden sighed heavily.

Seeing how reasonable Emily was, Calliope said, "You should keep all the properties I gave you before, or I'll be disappointed."

Emily smiled helplessly, unsure how to respond. She decided she'd slowly return the properties to Calliope in the future.
Calliope wanted to keep her, but Emily was as stubborn as they come.Once she made up her mind, there was no changing it.
Wilder gave her a gentle hug and said, "Emily's just leaving the Williams Mansion. We'll still see her. She'll find her own way."

Calliope, choking up, said, "Emily's the only daughter-in-law I recognize."

Emily loaded her luggage into the car and noticed John standing there,seeing her off. She turned around, surprised.

John, in a deep voice, said, "Emily, can you stop messing around?"

Emily leaned against the car, puzzled."John, you still think I'm messing around?"

"You even brought up Veda's pregnancy. What else won't you do? I know you're just playing games, trying to use my parents to make me leave Veda.You're really cunning!"

Emily waved her hand dismissively. She didn't want to waste her breath anymore.

She walked up to John and confronted him directly. John managed to evade her first swing, but the second blow came out of nowhere,catching him off guard.

Emily kicked him hard in the crotch, leaving him writhing in pain on the ground.

She looked down at him coldly. "For years, I tolerated you two living together abroad. Now that you're back, I expect you both to behave in front of me,got it?"
"It was you who wronged me first!" John yelled out.

Emily chuckled, then stepped on his crotch, pressing down. Hearing his screams, she said, "Back then, someone used your phone to send me a message, asking me to come find you."
She continued. "I didn't hold it against you back then, because I was the one being stupid. But now, it's different; I do hold you responsible.Who had your phone. and who were you with? John, you know as well as I do who's in the wrong here!"

Emily used to avoid arguments out of respect for Calliope and because she once genuinely liked John. But now, she no longer liked him and even resented him a bit. She wasn't that forgiving and couldn't just let things slide.

Seeing John's face trn pale, Emily lifted her foot, turned around decisively,and got into the car, leaving him with just a trail of exhaust fumes.

John was furious but helpless. That night, he rushed to the urology department of the hospital.

Lying on the hospital bed, thinking about Emily's departure and her confident smile, he realized it was something he had never seen before.

Suddenly, he felt a bit suffocated. He thought,'Emily,can you really let go?Or are you just acting?'

Emily went straight back to Crystal Valley Manor in a good mood.

As the car entered the garage, the house was brightly lit. When she walked in,James,wearing an apron, came out of the kitchen.

Seeing him, Emily couldn't help but chuckle. "James, what are you doing?"
James looked down at his apron, then back at her, and said. "T knew your d come back,so I was cooking."

Emily said. "Tll bring my luggage up first."

After taking a shower, she came downstairs with a document in her hand.which she handed directly to James, who had just finished cooking.

James took it with suspicion. When he saw the coneents on the cover.he frowped.
###Chapter 28
James was pretty taken aback when he found out Emily had drawn up a cohabitation agreement.
The first rule was all about keeping things strictly physical-no falling in love allowed.

The second rule was about respecting each other's space and work.James had the second floor, Emily had the third, and he wasn't allowed to go upstairs without permission.

The third rule said no other bed partners while they were together.If they wanted to change that, they had to give each other a heads-up and keep it drama-free.

The fourth rule was that they'd only hook up twice a week,no more.

James's eyes darkened a bit as he looked at her and said, "I can roll with the first few rules, but the last one..."

Biting Emily's ear, James whispered, "That's not your call; it's mine."


He crossed out the fourth rule with a pen and confidently signed his name.

Emily, a bit dazed, signed the document without really thinking.

After that, they set the agreement aside and started dinner.

To Emily's surprise, James was quite the cook. She couldn't hide her surprise.

During dinner, Emily asked, "Why did you end up in bed with me the first time we met at the bar?"
James replied coolly. "If I hadn't hadn't played along with your advances,it wouldn't have happened."
Emily pursed her lips, a hint of helplessness in her eyes. "Then why did you agree to be kept by me?"

James couldeasily afford to keep ten Emilys.

Raising an eyebrow, James said, "After waking up in bed, you didn't ask about my identity and just wanted to keep me."

"Did you agree just like that?" Emily was surprised, her eyes widening a bit.

In all the time they'd been together, she had never asked about James's identity.

James wrapped his arm around Emily's waist, his fingers tracing her curves, and said casually, "Why not? Being kept by you means I get paid and have a beautiful companion."

Emily felt like she had been played. The dignified James actually enjoyed being kept and even cared about the little money she gave him.

James affectionately pinched her cheek. "Can't I have a little hobby too?"

Emily coughed softly. "James, your hobby is quite unique."

In fact, James had recognized Emily the moment he saw her at the bar.But to this day, Emily still hadn't remembered him.

"Yeah,just like yours."

Emily couldn't help but roll her eyes, but her naturally alluring eyes carried an indescribable affection.
"Done with the questions and feeling full now, can we start?" James leaned in to kiss her, not even giving Emily a chance to speak.
He tore the fabric on Emily's chest, firmly grasping her breast, making Emily blush.

She scolded, "If you tear my clothès again, you owe me ten pieces!"


He had torn all her good clothes!

James's fingers found their way to Emily's intimate place, gently probing.making her moan involuntarily. Her nipples were already hard, and he gave them a light twist.

Emily's legs went weak, and she bit James's neck. Her breasts trembled in the torn clothes, showing a hint of desire.

"Emily, I can buy you a hundred new outfits."

Emily could sense James's excitement tonight. Maybe it was because she agreed to live with him.

Her nipples felt electrified, and her waist turned to jelly.

James usually didn't spend this much time on foreplay, but tonight he seemed to be teasing her on purpose.

Emily felt dazed, her eyes half-closed, as James lifted her and placed her on the sofa.


He lifted her skirt, quickly undressing her completely. Hisslender fingers parted her labia, sliding into her honeypot.

He whispered in her ear, "Emily, you're already wet."

Emily really wanted to roll her eyes.

James loved watching her tremble beneath him, and the change in their relationship status had him extra excited tonight.

Lowering his head, James's lips found her senasitive nipple, making her body tremble and blush.

His hot tongue slid over her stiff nipple, even giving it a light bite.

Emily's soft body was at his mercy, her eyes growing more confused.

James guided her delicate hand to his thick and hard penis, moving it gently. Emily felt her palm burning.

Suddenly, James placed a pillow under her waist, and his thick penis penetrated deeply.

James entered Emily's most tender part, bringing her intense pleasure.

Her tight vagina clung to his thick penis, making James breathe heavily.With each thrust,he moved forcefully.

One of Emily's beautiful legs was lifted high, the torn dress still hanging on her thigh, her delicate entrance exposed to James, who was thrusting vigorously.

Emily moaned softly, her body trembling with pleasure, as James gently twisted and teased her breasts, making her shake uncontrollably.

The tip of his thick and hard penis was bathed in her hot flow,and Emily lightly moaned, "Honey, that's enough."

After Emily climaxed, her body became extremely sensitive. James turned her over and began to thrust from behind, his eyes deep. "What do you

call me?"

"Darling."

"No."

James's mood was unpredictable. Subsequent encounters with him lacked any finesse; every thrust hit deep, making Emily's waist tremble.

Emily's hands were on the back of the sofa, gently held by him. He knelt on her, kissing her back, his voice hoarse. "Emily, do you know what I want to hear?"

Emily felt she couldn't think straight. She demanded, "Just tell me!"

###Chapter 29

"Emily.say my name."

Her voice shook, "James Smith."

James lit up with joy, and Emily seemed to get it too.

In the three years they'd been together, Emily had never called James's name in bed. Maybe she had, but she couldn't remember. She didn't realize it mattered so much to him.

Suddenly. James lifted her into the air, her slender legs swaying gently.

If he loosened his grip even a bit, Emily would fall, her body hitting his hip bone hard, and his thick, hard penis would penetrate her silken depths.

Emily had never gone this wild before, unable to stop screaming and moaning, her nails digging into James's back.

"James, stop. Put me down."

Emily's breasts swayed constantly. Her legs were spread wide apart, a strong sense of shame making her shake her head urgently.

Being squeezed by Emily, James was overwhelmed and released with a muffled groan.

He carried her back to the bathroom. Knowing she had worked hard on sketches today, he didn't push for sex in the bathroom. After cleaning up,James held Emily as they fell asleep.

The only difference was that he had become the unattainable heir of a major conglomerate from the man she kept outside.
Emily woke up to bright daylight. James beside her was no longer there.She thought he had gone to work, since the CEO of such a large company must be very busy every day.

But when she went downstairs after getting ready, she found James in the kitchen making breakfast. Emily was slightly stunned, not expecting him to be so domesticated.

She watched as he brought over the porridge he had cooked. Dressed in a white shirt, black pants, and a sleeve garter on his arm, he had broad shoulders, a narrow waist, and long legs, giving him an abstinent and aloof appearance.

She couldn't connect him with the wild man from last night in any way.

"Emily, were you satisfied last night? Are my skills at bed unmatched?"

James met her gaze. His sudden question made Emily slow to react.


Emily blinked. "What?"

"You were seducing me early in the morning. Were you not satisfied last night? We can go again."

He lightly bit his lip, looking Emily up and down with a hint of mischief in his eyes.

Emily rolled her eyes and thought, 'Your nature never changes.

She got up and picked his jaw. "Next time, remember to call me Ms.Johnson. As for whether your skills was unmatched last night, I don't have a comparison partner to know that."

James ended up with a dark expression, just as Emily wanted. She leaned

in and kissed the corner of his lips, smiling. "I'm off to work."

When Emily arrived at the company, everyone was there. She held a brief meeting and realized that Nora was absent.
She found a colleague who was close to Nora and asked, "Why didn't Nora come to work today?"

The colleague looked awkward and said, "Last night, she tried to seduce the boss of Empire Glance for a collaboration, but got beaten up by his wife. HR found the incident despicable and fired her on the spot. She went to the boss's party last night and even got the police involved, tarnishing our reputation."

In a workplace where pack mentality ruled and many had long-standing grievances against Nora, no one felt sorry for her dismissal.

At the high-level meeting at noon, Emily was present, and Wilder had returned. John was no longer the meeting host, sitting on the side.Without any company shares, his position had been demoted by Wilder,rendering him powerless.

Wilder got straight to the point at the meeting. "Veda has been fired."

John was the first to express dissatisfaction. "Dad! Why didn't you discuss this with me?"

"Why should I discuss it with you? Are you the president of the company?



Being humiliated in public, John's face was extremely unpleasant.

Wilder continued, "From now on, Emily is the only director in the Design Department."

No one opposed it.

After the meeting. Veda appeared outside the meeting room. Her eyes were red as she looked at Wilder. "Mr. Wilder Williams."
Wilder didn't even glance at her, taking Emily to his office.Veda could only turn to John.

In the office, Emily said softly, "Dad, I have a request that I hope you can agree to."

"Go ahead." Wilder spoke much more gently.

Emily took a deep breath and said, "Let Veda stay. I still have some conflicts with her, and it's easier to handle them when she's under my watch."

Wilder was taken aback. In his understanding, Emily had always been non-confrontational, but now it seemed like she had a fighting spirit.

Wilder felt somewhat relieved. "You finally know how to fight back."

Emily forced a smile. In the eyes of the Williams family,had she always been so weak?

"Okay, let her stay."

"Thank you,Dad."

"That's what I should do. We have failed you."

Emily shook her head, wrapping her hands around his arm. "You and Mom have been very good to me. It's I who have let you both down."

Wilder ruffled Emily's head. "If you encounter any difficulties at work, just

come to me directly."

Emily nodded.
After Emily left the office, John was about to go in when his phone suddenly rang. He looked down and saw a message from Wilder: [I agree to let Veda stay in the Design Department, but she can only start as a designer's assistant.]

Although John wanted to argue, he thought that Wilder's compromise was already a great act of leniency, so he just went to share the good news with Veda.

Veda wasn't particularly happy since she didn't want to become Emily's subordinate.

But as long as she could stay at the Williams Group, it was enough for her.Veda sighed deeply, thinking, 'One day, I will trample Emily under my feet and never allow her to rise again!

In the following weeks, Emily worked tirelessly on the design proposal for Golden Birch Group.

After finalizing the design proposal, Golden Birch Group also secured a top-tier celebrity for endorsement.

Suddenly,the Williams Group's Diamond Glow became extremely popular.
Even the jewelry that hadn't sold well before started flying off the shelves.This made Wilder very happy.

As a designer's assistant, Veda couldn't even access the design proposals initially. She wasn't even allowed to attend the design department meetings.
Veda often complained to John, who was no longer at the Williams Group.

John felt powerless. The only comfort he could offer was to encourage her to work hard on her own.
###Chapter 30
So, when the Golden Birch Group andI the Williams Group were having their third new product launch,things went south.
A hashtag blew up: #Williams Group Designer Emily Neglects Parents.


People started sharing how awful Emily's parents' lives were.

They were living in poverty. Her dad was disabled and only got the bare minimum from the government each month. Meanwhile, Emily looked all glammed up.

With this trending, everyone started hating on Emily. The internet was buzzing with discussions. The criticism was brutal.
Emily had no clue about any of this untiI the end of the event when Ryan approached her seriously. "Ms. Johnson,there's a situation."

Emily was confused.

He whispered, "You should check out the Twitter trends."

Emily opened Twitter and was bombarded with nasty comments.

[She doesn't even care for her own parents. That's disgusting.]

[There must be a reason she's not taking care of them. We shouldn't jump to conclusions.]

[People have confirmed Emily is their daughter, and some of you are still defending her. Unbelievable.]

[Emily,take care of your parents.]


Emily's face turned cold.
Her colleagues crowded around her, asking, "Ms. Johnson, is what's online true?"

"Do you really not take care of your parents?"

"Shouldn't you clear this up quickly?"

They all thought it was fake because Emily and Veda were sisters. Their parents shouldn't be struggling like that.
Ryan whispered, "Ms. Johnson, the reporters outside probably know about this and want to interview you, but they won't dare at the Golden Birch Group. Let me take you out the back."

Emily nodded. She couldn't face the reporters right now.

But Emily's bad press was affecting the collaboration with the Golden Birch Group.

Many thought she should be blacklisted and her work shouldn't be promoted. The online uproar was intense, putting pressure on the Golden Birch Group.

On her way back to the office, Emily kept reading the comments. She felt down, and her assistant next to her stayed silent.

As soon as she got back to the office, Veda came in, looking worried."Emily, are you okay? Don't listen to those online comments."

With her head in her hands, Emily said in front of everyone, "They're not my biologieal parents, so it's not my responsibility to take care of them,right?"
Veda smiled awkwardly. "How could you say that? They raised you. You owe them."
"Don't play that game. You know they're your parents. I never thought you'd use this to target ine. Do you think I'm easy to push around?"
Veda's expression changed, realizing Emily wasn't the naive girl who had just come back from the countryside.
When Emily threatened her, every word hit hard,leaving Veda speechless.

Veda finally said, "I'm the daughter of the Johnson family. Dad and Mom raised me. Besides, your parents don't even acknowledge me as their child.
11
Emily shrugged, "Doesn't matter if they don't acknowledge you. The DNA test at the hospital does, and you can't argue with that, right?"
Veda's face fell. She glanced around, noticing a crowd gathering outside.She wished she could vanish, speaking pitifully, "Sis, have you misunderstood? I didn't dothis. Why are you threatening me like this?"

Emily looked at her quietly, feeling nothing but disgust.

Emily stood up, raised her hand, and slapped her hard.

Seeing Veda's shocked expression, she said, "I can't deal with any nonsense right now. We've had our differences for a long time,so don't act all pitiful in front of me."

Emily wasn't afraid of online bullying!

She continued, "I warned you before, my parents never had another daughter besides me, so I'm not your sis. And, it's best to address me as

Ms. Johnson in the company."
Emily looked at her standing there on the verge of tears, narrowed her eyes slightly, and sneered. "Are you waiting for me to force you to leave?"

After work, Emily returned to Crystal Valley Manor.

She was in a good mood and saw the light on in James' study, so she went in directly.
He was sitting at the desk, already showered and wearing dark gray pajamas.
Without looking up when Emily entered, his gaze fell on the computer screen.

Emily didn't look at his computer, sat down beside him, and asked softly,"Are you working?"
James gestured for her to come over. His slender fingers exuded an elegance and allure that made her heart skip a beat at a glance.

Emily moved closer to him and noticed he was looking at today's trending.

She chuckled softly. "I didn't expect you, who is always busy,to have time to look at news about me?"

James naturally extended his arms, pulled her onto his lap, and sat down.

Emily found a comfortable position leaning against him, as relaxed as a cat.


He said, "I see you're in a good mood."

It seemed like she wasn't affected by the online situation at all.

Emily nodded. "Of course, I'm in a good mood. Veda exposed her own parents, not mine. She 'll have to face the consequences."
Emily had never seen someone so foolish. She wrapped her arms around James'neck, lightly bit his Adam's apple, and kissed him.
James' Adam's apple bobbed up and down, his eyes slightly deepened.He closed the computer, staring at Emily. "You're seducing me."
Thinking about how rough their lovemaking had been the night before, he had intended to spare her today, but she took the initiative and approached him instead.

James just held her gently and asked, "Are you really not affected at all?"

Emily vaguely sensed that he might find out something with his capabilities.

She furrowed her brows suddenly. "James, do I have no secrets in front of you?"

James opened his mouth."You still have secrets."

Emily squinted, her hands touching his body, and her red lips slightly parted."What?"

"I wouldn't know your secrets." James was sincere, not joking.

Emily didn't dwell on it. Seeing that he still wasn't interested, she withdrew her hands.

James asked her, "Do you want me to help?"

Emily replied. "No, I know who leaked this information."

James raised an eyebrow, looking at her.

Emily calmly said. "It was Nora, a former colleague from the Design Department. She has always been sucking up to Veda, and this time she was fired by the Williams Group, so she's holding a grudge."
###Chapter 31
James got the hint, so he gently brushed his fingers over the corners of her eyes and eyebrows, his voice a bit raspy. "How about we head to my room tonight?"

"Are you inviting me for a sexual encounter?"

James squinted and whispered, "Yeah, will you?"


Emily couldn't resist his charm.

Sitting on his lap, she could already feel him getting excited.James was heating up.
Emily kissed him, her fingers trailing down his stomach, slowly wrapping around his growing erection. She wiggled her hips, her eyes full of allure.
With her taking the lead, James grabbed her hips and guided her back to his room.

As soon as she sank into the soft sofa, James kissed her immediately.

He pinned her beneath him, and Emily's soft breasts pressed against his firm chest.

Worried about hurting her, James used some lube, and after a few quick strokes with his fingers, he slid his entire length inside her before she could react.

Emily gasped,"James,slow down!"

James unbuttoned her shirt, firmly grasped her breasts, and kissed her passionately.
Emily's hair was a mess, her seductive eyes misty, softening her usual sharp and assertive demeanor, making her look a bit vulnerable. James loved that he was the only one who got to see her like this.
James then took her swollen nipples into his mouth. Emily's body tensed for a moment as he lightly licked them, which only made her feel more needy.
Emily weakly protested, her face flushed. "James, this isn't a lollipop. You really..."

"Don't you like it?"
Emily was at a loss for words, especialy with his sudden deep thrusts that sent electric shocks through her, making her whole body shudder.
She twisted her slender waist to match his deep and heavy thrusts, the pleasure making her forget all the day's troubles.
She didn't care about the online comments because the deal with the Golden Birch Group wouldn't fall through just because of some resistance.

After all, those who could afford products from Quigr and the Williams Group's Diamond Glow had assets of at least tens of millions, not those online criticizers. The cheapest jewelry item this time was in the seven figures.

After work the next day, Emily called Nora to meet up.

Nora said arrogantly, "Ms. Johnson, are you here to apologize? Isn't it too late? I got an offer from Luminous Studio today to join as the design director.Jealous?"

She continued,"How does it feel to have your rights taken by your sister?
Veda's boyfriend is the heir of the Williams Group. You'll be kicked out soon enough."
Nora only knew that Veda was still at the Williams Group, so she thought Emily must be struggling.
Emily stayed cool and said, "Meet me at Celestial Cuisine tonight at 8."

Celestial Cuisine was one of the swankiest spots in Emerald City.

After a moment's hesitation, Nora agreed. She knew clearly why Emily would invite her, but even if it was a trap, she wouldn't held back.
Everyone at work thought Emily was some rich heiress, always decked out in designer clothes, driving fancy cars, and having the top execs at her beck and call.

But they had no clue about Emily's humble background.

Nora felt a weird sense of superiority. She thought, 'Even if Emily knows I leaked the news online, she can't do anything about it.'

At 8 PM, Emily waited for half an hour at Celestial Cuisine before Nora showed up.

Emily had picked a prime spot, with a stunning view of Emerald City.

As Nora sat down, she noticed people staring at Emily. She felt a twinge of envy and muttered to herself, "What a hussy!"

Dropping her bag, Nora sneered, "Mr. Williams really likes Veda. Even now, he keeps her in the company. Emily, doesn't that bother you?"

She looked at Emily with a smug expression and said, "If you can't hack it here, you can join me at Luminous Studio. I might even make you my

assistant, how about that?"

Emily narrowed her eyes and shot back, "Thanks, but I don't take scraps from dogs."

Nora's face turned red with anger. She slammed the table and snapped,"Emily, who do you think you are? How long do you think you can keep that director's chair?"

Emily replied coolly, "However long I stay, it's none of your business.Your concern is unnecessary."

Taking a sip of her coffee, Emily said, "I called you here to find out who gave you my info."

Nora raised an eyebrow, crossed her arms, and looked indifferent. "So you're finally scared. I found out on my own because I can't stand your attitude and wanted to ruin your reputation!"

Emily smirked, "Such a barking dog."

"Emily,you!"

Emily pulled out her phone, tapped a few times, and showed Nora a video.

When Nora saw the footage of herseIf posting on Twitter at an internet cafe,a flicker of panic crossed her face, but she quickly composed herself.

Nora asked, "So what if Iposted it? I just wanted people to know what kind of person you are. Do you dare to let them know what you've done?"

Emily put down her phone and said calmly, "I can sue you for defamation.I have all the time in the world to deal with you, but do you have the money and time? Just tell me who gave you the info, and I'll let it go."
###Chapter 32
Nora let out an angry laugh, her words dripping with sarcasm. "Emily, I always thought you were some high-society princess, but turns out you crawled up from the gutter. Everything about you is fake. How many beds have you warmed to get here?"
Emily's eyebrows shot up, a cold glint in her eyes. She could handle the jabs at her background, but that last comment? No way.
Emily was only here for the evidence Nora had. Otherwise, she wouldn't waste a second on her.

Emily clicked her tongue, a playful glint in her eyes. "You've got one minute. Hand it over, or you'll be blacklisted from the entire design industry."

Nora snapped back, "Don't you dare threaten me!"

Emily raised an eyebrow, texted on her phone, and then set it down with a smirk.

Nora felt a chil run down her spine under Emily's gaze. A minute later,her phone rang. It was HR from Luminous Studio, telling her not to bother showing up tomorrow.

Nora was stunned. "Why? I already got the offer, didn't I?"

"Think about who you've pissed off. Management's decision, not mine,"the HR rep said before hanging up.

Nora was in shock, her eyes wide. She yelled, "Emily! What did you do to my job offer?"

Emily's smile wasicy. "You should've listened to me."

Nora didn't want to back down. She straightened up and said,"Losing this job is nothing. Plenty ofcompanies want me as a designer."
Emily gave her a knowing look. "You're blacklisted now. Good luck finding another job."

Nora didn't believe it, but a knot of fear tightened in her chest.

She quickly called her industry contacts, but every response was a no.


Some even said, "We don't hire plagiarists."

Her hand shook as she held the phone. She was really blacklisted. But how did Emily have this kind of power?

Nora glared at her. "Who did you sleep with to get this kind of influence?"

Emily's expression darkened. "Do women always have to rely on men to succeed? Is it so hard to admit that I'm just good at what I do?"

Emily stirred her coffee. "So,ready to confess?"


Nora took a deep breath, still on the fence.

Just then, a clear voice cut through the tension. "Emily, stop wasting your time on her."

James walked up behind Emily, draping his coat over her shoulders.

Emily was only wearing a thin shirt, and Celestial Cuisine was pretty chilly,so she appreciated the warmth.

James sat down next to Emily,pulling her close.
Emily adjusted his coat, genuinely surprised. "What are you doing here?"

"I came to celebrate Eric's birthday. Didn't expect to see you here," James replied.
Emily smiled. "I haven't had the gold leaf chocolate pudding here in ages.Want to try somelater?"
As she spoke, the waiter brought over the dessert. Emily scooped up a spoonful and fed it to James.

James wasn't really into sweets, but since Emily offered,he took a bite.


Emily watched him and smiled. "Not bad, huh?"


James nodded.

Nora was stunned. When James glanced her way, his gentle look turned icy,making her go pale.

No wonder Emily could blacklist her. If James was involved, it made sense.

But how did Emily be so close James? He was a big deal! And the way they acted around each other, it was clear they weren't strangers before their cooperation.

Nora suddenly felt trapped, regretting her past actions.

She clenched her hands, too scared to show any hatred in front of James,and pleaded, "Mr. Smíth, please, have mercy. It was Veda who gaveme the info. I can show you our chat logs."

Nora quickly pulled up her phone, showing Emily the messages and files from Veda.
She bit her lip. "I was just her pawn."

Nora knew the consequences of crossing James. He had a reputation in North Starry Capital for being ruthless to enemies. Those who crossed him never fared well.
Emily said calmly, "Claiming you were just being used as a pawn won't save you now. You have three days to leave Emerald City. If I see you again,you won't survive!"

With James there, Nora didn't dare argue and just nodded.

After Nora left, Emily leaned on James's shoulder. "Mr. Smith, you showed up at the perfect time. Can I call this using your influence?"

James raised an eyebrow. "Are you using my influence?"

He ruffled her hair. "Doesn't seem like it. How did you manage to blacklist her?"

"She got caught plagiarizing. Designers hate that. I just spread the word,and it took off."

Emily looked at James, who seemed to see through everything,and quickly looked away.

In truth, James didn't know everything. He had his ways, but he couldn't interfere with the affairs of other companies.

Emily was genuinely there to enjoy a meal, not just for the confrontation,and she went all out with her orders-a real feast on the table.

James ate with her for a bit and then said, "Since you used my influence,can I ask you a favor?"
He reached out andI gently wiped an oil stain from the corner of Emily's mouth.

Emily blinked. "What?"
"It's Eric's birthday, and everyone's bringing their partners.I can't go alone.Come with me."

For these high-society guys, having a woman by their side was like having a luxury watch or car, just like women with their dresses and jewelry.

Emily looked at her clothes. "Can I go dressed like this?"

James touched her face. "You look good in anything."

Emily couldn't say no and simply said, "I don't usually go to birthday

parties. If I mess up, it's on you."

James smiled. "If you mess up,I'll be there to fix it."
###Chapter 33
The party was on the third floor of Celestial Cuisine.

James pushed open the door, and the smell of wine and flowers hit them.

Emily immediately caught a whiff of Cassia's signature perfume, which was way too fancy to be used as just a room fragrance.
The private room was huge, with people sipping wine, playing cards,and dancing. Everyone looked stunning, like they just stepped out of a magazine. There was a multi-layered cake on the table, with a piece already missing.

"Jim. you finally made it. I missed you so much."

Anais Allen rushed over to hug James, her voice light and cheerful. But when she noticed the woman around James, who had his coat on, her expression changed.

Her voice went up a notch. "Jim, who is this woman?"

James was the center of attention as soon as he walked in. The folks who had been with James at the Royal Venue recognized Emily, and now they all had knowing looks.

Anais wasn't the type to back down easily. But if this woman had something special with James, that was a different story.

Those who hadn't seen Emily before were wide-eyed.

James casually put his arm around Emily. "Let me introduce you to Emily Johnson, my girlfriend."
The room went silent. making his words even more striking.

Everyone was stunned. They all thought James would end up with Anais.Their families and backgrounds matched perfectly.
But Emily just popped up out of nowhere. For over twenty years,James had no woman by his side. Had he been waiting for Emily all this time?
Someone suddenly asked, "Mr. Smith, did you come here with your grandmother for her health because of Emily?"
James didn't answer directly, just said coolly, "I'm not changing girlfriends in the future."

Anais felt dizzy,swaying from the alcohol. "I am your fiancée! How can you have a girlfriend? What about me?"
James glanced at her indifferently. If Anais wasn't Eric's sister, he wouldn't even bother looking at her.

He asked, "What does it have to do with you if I have a girlfriend?"

Anais shouted, "We could have gotten engaged two years ago. It was you who ran away!"

Emily finally got it. This Anais claimed to be James's fiancée, but it was clear that James had no intention of marrying her, despite Anais's insistence, so he brought Emily along as a shield.

Emily immediately hugged James's waist, her voice playful. "James, this lady is a bit scary. Let's just give the gift and leave."

Emily snuggled into James's arms. Anais saw her and her eyes turned red.

James looked down, a bit surprised at Emily. He instinctively felt that
Emily had cooked up some wild ideas, but he didn't want to explain. He looked at her with interest and indulgence.
Eric knew James well. He quickly pulled Anais aside and whispered,"Don't make a scene."

Anais was so angry she didn't listen and even accused him directly,"Your brother-in-law is cheating! Should I not make a scene? Or should I just wait for James to have a love child with someone else?"
Eric was speechless. He couldn't imagine James as his brother-in-law. Both he and Anais were out of their depth.

James had never shown any interest in Anais, not even when they were kids.

Eric had tried to talk sense into Anais at home, telling her to stop obsessing over James. He warned her that even their friendship wvith James wouldn't save her if she kept this up. But clearly, Anais wasn't listening.

James didn't give Anais a second glance. He led Emily to an empty sofa,poured her a drink, and then, in front of everyone,kissed her.

Everyone was stunned. They all thought James wasn't really into Emily,just using her to keep Anais at bay.

But kissing her in public? James, who had avoided women for years,was making an exception for Emily!

Anais was burning with jealousy and rage. After James stepped out to take a phone call, she approached Emily with a glass of wine.

She intended to pour the wine over Emily's head, hoping to humiliate her.
Emily saw her coming from the corner of her eye. Just as Anais was about to pour the wine. Emily stood up, knocked the glass out of her hand, and the red wine splashed all over Anais's face. Anais looked a mess.
Anais had never been treated like this before and lost it. "You bitch,you did that on purpose, didn't you!"

She lunged at Emily, trying to grab her hair.

Emily easily dodged, and Anais, too focused on her attack, tripped over a table leg and fell,hitting her head and getting a bump.

Anais looked even more disheveled and in pain.

Everyone just watched. When two women fought, it wasn't appropriate for the men to step in.

Besides, one was the daughter of the Allen family, and the other was James's girlfriend. No one wanted to get involved.

Anais had always been arrogant and domineering, so everyone was happy to watch her get a taste of her own medicine. Even Eric didn't bother to intervene.

Emily was toying with Anais, like playing with a puppy. Anais was no match for her. Just as Anais was about to lose it completely, James returned from his call.

Emily saw James, her eyes reddened, and she quickly hid behind him,sounding distressed. "Jim, Ms. Allen seems drunk and really aggressive. I'm scared."

Everyone was taken aback.
Emily's voice had a rare hint of vulnerability, which made James raise an eyebrow slightly.
Anais was even more furious, shouting, "How dare you call hím Jim? You bitch. I'll tear your mouth apart!"

Anais lunged to slap Emily.

James caught her arm, his voice icy. "Anais, she's my girlfriend. If you keep this up, I won't tolerate it, even for your brother's sake."
It was clear that Anais meant nothing to him, not even compared to her brother Eric.

Anais felt utterly humiliated. Her body ached, and she couldn't stop the tears from flowing.
###Chapter 34

James gave Emily a quick once-over."You okay?"

Emily shook her head, patting her chest like she'd just had a scare. "James,I'm just a bit freaked out. I wanna go home."
James had never seen her so meek before. With a smirk and a raised eyebrow,he said, "Alright, let's head back."

He grabbed her hand and they walked off.

Anais was left on the ground, crying and trying to catch her breath.

Eric felt uneasy, frowning as he spoke in a low voice, "Anais, it's my birthday. Why are you making a scene?"

Eric wasn't worried about any beef between him and James; he just thought Anais was making a fool of herself.

Anais couldn't compete with Emily, whether it was in scheming or skills.So she was bringing disgrace on her own head.

He shouldn't have brought her along. Their relationship wasn't great to begin with.

Once they were out of the private room, Emily raised aneyebrow at James."How was my acting? Think I could make it in Hollywood?"

James chuckled. "You really made a mess of Anais at such a nice birthday party. She's definitely gonna hold a grudge."

Emily wrapped her arm around James, raising an eyebrow. "Anais picked the wrong target. She should be chasing you, not bothering me. Without
me. you'd have women all over you, right?"

James raised an eyebrow, giving her a sly look.

Emily suddenly realized, "You're the bad guy here. It's your buddy's birthday, and you didn't want to deal with his sister, so you made me handle her."

The politics between big families were complicated, and appearances had to be kept up.
From what Anais said, she and James were almost engaged. If the engagement fell through, someone had to take the fall.
James could see she was overthinking it. He didn't explain,just pulled her into the car and kissed her deeply.

His fingers slipped under her clothes, finding her breasts and teasing her nipples. He pressed against her, whispering, "What did you call me in there? Say it again."

Calling him Jim was a last resort.

Emily grabbed his wrist, stopping him. She half-closed her eyes,a playful smile on her face. "We're in the car. Can't you wait?"

James just wanted to hear her call him Jim again. He used to think it was a cheesy name, but now he didn't mind being cheesy.

Back home, Emily and James went at it until late into the night.

James' big cock kept thrusting in and out of her pussy. Her slim waist twisted eagerly, and she came over and over.

James was red-eyed from the tight grip of her pussy, his strong hips
thrusting wildly, hitting her deepest spots. After a dozen thrusts, he came,filling her with hot cum.
He held her close, her legs spread wide, letting him thrust his massive cock into her pussy.
Emily's body shook with his movements, her eyes filled with desire,her lips captured by James in a forcefual kiss.
James lifted her off the bed, the intense pleasure making Emily feel dazed until a cool breeze hit them.
He pressed her against the terrace railing, his rough, hard cock sliding in and out of her pussy, their juices dripping obscenely.
Even though she was exhausted, Emily couldn't sleep when they got back to the room. She sat on the balcony swing until dawn.

She couldn't understand why Veda, who had everything-her parents and John-still hated her.

Emily never suspected Veda was the one plotting against her back then because she didn't think Veda was so scheming and unscrupulous.

But now, she saw Veda for who she truly is and wouldn't ignore Veda's actions. She was going to make Veda pay.

Around eight o'clock, Emily made a call. "Isolde Porter, your daughter Veda is back from overseas. Aren't you going to see her?"

At nine in the morning, the area outside the Williams Group building was bustling. Everyone was rushing to clock in.

Emily arrived just in time, parking her car on the side of the road.
Without getting out, she saw a haggard woman standing nearby, watching people pass by. It was Isolde.
Her face was grim, her clothes tattered and dirty, looking like a beggar.But her eyes were full of cunning and malice.
Finally, she spotted Veda. A glint of cunning flashed in her eyes as she walked up and grabbed the arm of the glamorous Veda. "Veda, I finally found you. You're back, but why didn't you come find me?"
At first. Veda's eyes were confused. Then, recognizing Isolde, she widened her eyes in shock. "How did you get here? I don't know you! Let go of me!


She tried to shake off Isolde's hand, but Isolde's grip was strong, her nails digging into Veda's flesh through her clothes.

Hearing this, Isolde grabbed Veda's hair and started hitting and kicking her.

As she beat her. Isolde yelled, "Look, everyone, my own daughter doesn't take care of me. She found a rich boyfriend to enjoy herself while leaving me to suffer. Her father broke his leg and no one is taking care of him at home."

Veda had been making a name for herself at the company,so most people knew who she was.

Isolde shouted loudly, "You heartless girl!"

People around were drawn to the commotion. Someone quickly separated Veda and Isolde.

Isolde lay on the ground, rolling around. "I raised an ungrateful daughter.
You don't even care for your own parents. When I gave birth to you, I almost died. And now, you don't take care of me in my old age."

Veda was trembling with anger and fear.
###Chapter 35
When Veda got swapped back with Emily, Isolde picked her up to take her home, which was basically a dump.
The house was empty, and her dad was a gambling addict who kept asking her for money to pay off his debts. When she told him she didn't have any,he beat her.

After a week of this, Veda had enough. She secretly bought a ticket back to the Johnson Mansion.

Seeing Veda in such a sorry state, Mia's heart broke, and she insisted on keeping her. After all, she had raised her for twelve years. After that, Veda barely saw Isolde and her husband again.

Veda didn't say anything back, but her eyes were full of hatred.

Everyone was watching, and the disdain and displeasure in their eyes cut Veda deeply.

Her heart ached, and she couldn't help but shout angrily, "I don't know her! She's not my mom! Make her leave!"

Emily sat in the car, watching Veda lose it. She smirked, drove into the underground parking lot, and then headed into the office.

A colleague saw Emily and couldn't help but ask, "Ms. Johnson, aren't you and Veda sisters? Isn't that woman downstairs your mother?"

"That's her mother,not mine."

The colleagūe was shocked. "You're not from the same mother?"
Emily shook her head and went into the office to start working on her designs.
Over an hour later, Emily got a call from John. His voice was harsh. "Emily,get to the hospital right now!"
Emily replied calmly, "Am I going to the hospital to collect Veda's body?"

John's breathing got heavier with anger. "Veda is being treated at the hospital. If anything happens to her, I won't let you off the hook!"
After hanging up, Emily sneered, calmly finished her work, held a meeting,and didn't go to the hospital until the end of the workday.
Veda was in a deluxe ward, with only John by her side. The door was slightly ajar, and Emily could see everything inside clearly.

Veda was cowering in John's arms, her eyes swollen from crying,the slap marks on her face still visible.

She sobbed, "John, no one knows about Isolde except Emily. She knew Isolde hated me, yet she still let her come find me! The whole Isolde family is like demons, and they just want money from me. Now Isolde has come to the company causing a scene. What am I going to do in the future? How can I face my coleagues?"

Veda cried bitterly.

John held her tightly, comforting her gently, "It's okay. Worst case, you find a new job. Plus, you still have me. I can take care of you forever,and you don't have to worry about anything."

Emily knocked on the door, and both of them looked towards it. When they saw Emily, their anger flared up simultaneously.
John shouted,"Emily,how dare you come here!"

Emily rolled her eyes, closed the door again, and said coldly,"You called me to come. Are you crazy?"

Emily glanced at Veda. "Call me again when you're dead next time."

Veda's pupils trembled, and she immediately buried her face in John's arms,crying again.

Emily, feeling annoyed, scratched her ear and said discontentedly, "What's there to cry about? Just a few slaps. Wasn't I the one taking those slaps for you all these years? Now you know how painful it is."

John's voice was full of anger. "Emily! You're simply unreasonable."

Emily didn't deny it. "Yeah, I am unreasonable. Being too gentle just makes it easy for people to walk all over me."

John took a deep breath and said coldly, "You caused the death of our child before, and now you've hurt Veda again. You are truly heartless!"

Emily narrowed her eyes and asked Veda, "Did I really cause the death of your child?"

Veda affirmed firmly."Yes!"

Emily took out her phone and calmly said, "Well, I happen to have a live video here.Maybe you'd like to take a look."

Veda's expression instantly changed.

She asked, "How do you have the video?"

Emily sighed. "Back then, John didn't attend the wedding. To remember it,
I had surveillance cameras installed at the wedding venue."

This reason was pretty far-fetched, especially since it was only after Veda invited her over that she hadI someone quickly install them. But it turned out to be useful.

Emily handed the video to John.

In the video, Veda's words were clearly heard. And then, after Emily let go of her hand, Veda jumped from upstairs onher own.

Emily raised an eyebrow at John. "Video doesn't lie. I'll send it to you,and you can have it properly authenticated later."

Veda's face turned pale. After John watched the video, he slapped Veda and said angrily, "Veda! You know this is our child and your own physical condition! We might not have children again. How dare you!"

John took a deep breath. In that moment after watching the video, he felt like a joke.

His body kept trembling, but looking at Veda's tearful eyes and the red marks on her face, his heart softened a little. But this anger in his heart couldn't be resolved.

Veda nervously held John's hand, crying and explaining, "No, John, it's definitely not true."

John gave her a slap, indicating that he believed it.

Veda was gasping for breath as she cried. She even gave Emily a fierce glare.

Emily added certainly, "There's one more thing. Veda,you leaked the
online rumors about me not supporting Isolde."

Veda cried. "Why would I bring trouble upon myself? I didn't do what you're accusing me of."
Emily smiled, her eyes full of charm, and said, "How can you be so sure I don't have evidence?"

"Emily, stop it!" John looked at Emily, his voice filled with anger. It was unclear whether he was defending Veda or saving face for himself. Or maybe he felt uncomfortable deceived by Veda, wanting to vent on someone.

Emily asked abruptly, "John, did you ever love me?"

She looked at John and smiled. "If you ever loved me, you wouldn't have left me because of Veda's seduction."
###Chapter 36
Emily's words hit John like a punch to the gut, bringing back a pain he thought he'd buried long ago.

"If you really cared about me, even a little," Emily went on, "you wouldn't have hurt me when I was at my lowest. Isn't it crazy how we ended up here?"

She didn't need to spell it out; her meaning was crystal clear.

John used to be her hero. When everyone else looked down on her for being a country girl,John was the only one who treated her like a friend.

Even if they couldn't be together, they shouldn't be enemies. But now,they were practically at war.

Even after his initial anger, John still chose to believe Veda. "You must've said something awful to Veda, making her think about jumping off a building. Veda's always been kind-hearted."

Emily just smirked and pulled out a recorder, hitting play.

Nora's voice filled the room. "Mr. Smith, please, it was Veda who gave me the info. I can show you our chat logs. I was just her pawn."

John's trust in Veda was already shaky, and now it was gone. His face grew serious.

He checked the trending topics, most of which were trashing Emily. No one mentioned the Isolde couple's abuse of her.

Veda's face went pale after hearing the recording.
"It wasn't me! Nora's lying! You're my sister, how could I do that?" Veda pleaded.
Emily shot back, "I have the chat logs between you and Nora. Want to see them?"
Emily thought Veda was an idiot for not even changing her number when talking to Nora.

"Veda, you're really foolish," Emily said, staring her down.

The thought of being framed by someone so dumb made Emily's skin crawl.

She furrowed her brow, wantingto ask Veda about the past, but she couldn't tip her hand just yet. She needed more evidence.

After six years, Emily wasn't sure if she could still find it.

She sent everything she had to John, hoping he'd finally see Veda for wvho she really was.

After Emily left, Veda cried, while John stared at his phone, deep in thought.

Veda clutched the blanket, panicking. "John, you can't just trust her evidence.It could be fake."

Suddenly, she clutched her stomach, looking pitiful. "John, my stomach hurts.Please get the doctor."

John responded without emotion and went to find the doctor. He didn't even try to comfort her.

Veda felt a growing unease. Once doubt took root, it would only grow.
John had seen most of Emily's evidence, and he could lie to himself about Veda's pregnancy and her suicide attempt. But what abouit the trending topics on Twitter? Could aIl those recordings be fake?
Despite his doubts, John stayed at the hospital with Veda. The hospital didn't allow overnight stays, so he went home when she fell asleep.
He walked into the study and booted up Veda's computer. He tried his birthday, Veda's birthday, and their anniversary, but none of them worked.

John's eyes narrowed, and then he typed in Emily's birthday.The computer unlocked instantly.

John sat there, stunned. Did Veda really harbor such deep resentment towards Emily?

It didn't take long for John to find a folder on Veda's computer filled with photos of Emily and fabricated scandals.

Some were identicaI to the ones circulating online. Veda had even organized them in chronological order.

During their years abroad, Veda must have hired someone to dig up dirt.

John was floored, feeling like Veda's sweet image had jst shattered.

Each of those fake news stories was enough to destroy Emily's reputation for good, making it impossible for her to bounce back.

One claimed Emily stole jewelry and sold it after returning to the Johnson family, and even gambled at a young age. Another said she had promiscuous relationships in school, hooking up with male classmates in the restroom and having an abortion.
These stories got more horrifying one after another. They had spent their junior high years together, and everyone knew how exceptional Emily was.
Emily didn't date anyone, didn't have an abortion, and wasn't a delinquent.

Emily was adored by everyone. All these scandals were total fabrications.

John's scalp tingled. His attraction to Emily was based on desire since she was beautiful and smart.
But John was also a very traditional guy; he didn't like women who were more capable and powerful than him. So when Emily made a mistake,he cruelly thought she would beg him.

But Emily didn't. She was proud and aloof.

And once these fabrications were exposed, it would be nearly impossible for Emily to clear her name. She'd be dragged into an abyss with no way out.

John was at a loss, the light in the room casting shadows on his face,making him look inserutable.

Emily had been busy sketching designs lately. And Veda hadn't shown up to work, which left Emily a bit bored. She thought Veda could hold out a few more days, but she had overestimated her.

As she was refining a sketch, Emily's phone beeped. She glanced at it and saw a message from her teacher.

[When will you send me the formula for the new perfume? Did you forget?]

Emily paused, realizing she had indeed forgotten.
She quickly messaged back: [Please give me another week.]

The new formula wasn't easy to figure out, and there was no lab at Crystal Valey Manor. Going to her own lab risked James finding out.
Suddenly, Emily remembered that James was on a business trip, so she didn't have to go back to Crystal Valley Manor at night, which made her quite happy.

James was always busy on business trips and didn't have time to flirt with her. She felt a bit more relaxed.

That night, she went to the lab and started mixing the perfume. Suddenly,James sent a message: [Come to the hotel tonight; let's have dinner together.]

Emily stared at the message, then at the vessels in her hand.

She put them down and texted back: [Aren't you on a week-long business trip? Why are you back so soon?]

It had only been three days.

James replied: [I missed you.]
###Chapter 37
Emily came to the hotel just for a meal, but the moment she walked in,James pulled her into a warm hug and kissed her hard.

Her lips were almost swollen from his kisses.

She pushed him away and asked, "Why do we have to meet at a hotel? It feels like we're sneaking around."
"Meeting at the office feels even more like sneaking around. Next time,come to my office."

Emily rolled her eyes, thinking he was getting more ridiculous.

She walked straight in and plopped down on the sofa while James headed to the kitchen,busy with something.

Emily noticed the name Veda on his desk.

Veda was a designer who graduated from a top school and got recommended to work for the Golden Birch Group.

Emily thought,'Did she leave the Williams Group because she couldn't stand it and found a way out for herself?'

She wondered if James had seen Veda's name. If he had, why would he leave it out in the open to upset her? It was unlikely he hadn't noticed it.

His files were in such an obvious spot, so he must have seen them.


A flash of coldness crossed Emily's eyes.

Back then, Veda had only stayed at Isolde's house for a week. When she returned to the Johnson Mansion with injuries, Aiden and Mia's affection

for Emily vanished instantly.
They felt more sorry for Veda. After all, she was the daughter they had pampered for twelve years. When Veda cried,they would do nothing but comfort her.
Emily remembered standing at the top of the stairs holding a doll,watching the family downstairs being affectionate.
When Mia first saw her, she thought Emily was a bit dirty. She didn't
want to sleep with Emily and sometimes showed disdain on her face.Emily kept thinking that her mom just wasn't familiar with her, and it
would get better in the future.

But when she saw Mia not minding Veda's dirtiness and injuries,Emily understood instantly.
During those twelve years at Isolde's house, Emily had always been good at reading people's moods.

She understood people's hearts, but it didn't mean she could accept it. She couldn't stand Mia's favoritism. When she argued at home, Mia would say,"Then go back to Isolde's house."

Emily didn't want to go back. Isolde and Lucas Johnson were both abusive,especially Lucas. He had all the worst qualities a person could have.

He even tried to sexually assault minors. One time when Lucas tried to sneak into her bed at midnight, she tightly held onto broken pieces of porcelain and fiercely scratched his penis.

Thinking of those unspeakable past events, Emily felt like there was a bleeding wound in her heart that could never be filled.
Emily closed her eyes and took a deep breath. Most likely, Veda's intention was all for James. It was just too ridiculous.
Compared to the centuries-old noble Smith family, the barely prestigious Johnson family couldn't even be considered nouveau riche. Veda was simply treating others like fools.
After setting the tabe, James walked over and lifted Emily from the sofa.Emily restrained the coldness on her face and looked at him with a smile.
To steady herself, she heldI onto his neck and smiled brightly. "Did you rush back just to have a meal with me?"

Suddenly. James felt like this meal wasn't really necessary.


"Are you hungry?" he asked.

Emily didn't answer right away, so James took her silence as a no.

The food on the table quickly cooled down, but things were heating up in the bedroom.

As James kissed Emily's lips, hestarted undressing her.

His kisses trailed down her body, and when Emily realized what he was about to do, she pressed his head with trembling pupils. "What are you trying to do?"

James kissed her waist, his voice hoarse. "Just trying to make you feel good.

"1

Emily realized James always had these wild ideas in bed.

James gently explored Emily's most sensitive spots with his lips and tongue, making her lift her face and moan uncontrollably.

At that moment. James's wet and soft tongue was teasing her clitoris and labia, carefully exploring her tender flesh. Soon, he was inside her,licking along the folds.
The intense stimulation and shame made Emily moan softly,and her pussy involuntarily released fluid.

She cried out, "No, James, it's dirty!"

She couldn't believe James was actually kissing her down there. Her delicate mouth kept opening and closing,panting uncontrollably.

At first, Emily tried to resist, but James knew her sensitive spots too well.With his slow, deliberate tongue movements, her body trembled, and her wet pussy clung to his tongue,craving more.

James's tongue reached the deepest part, his nose pressing against her sensitive spot.

She shouted, "James I can't take it anymore!"

Her fingers ran through his hair, pressing his head down. The intense pleasure made her eyes misty, and she couldn't help but cry out.

But James wasn't done. He sucked hard a few times, and when he pulled out, he lightly bit her clitoris.

Propping himself up, James placed his big hands on her breasts,his fingertips tracing her nipples, making them stand erect.

With both hersensitive spots stimulated, Emily's face flushed as she screamed, the intense pleasure and desire almost driving her crazy.

"James,come inside!"
She bit his shoulder to stay grounded.

James chuckled lightly. It was already quite an achievement to push her to this point. If he went too far, he probably wouldn't be allowed to touch her again.
His slender fingertips slid down her slightly sweaty back, slowly moving over her delicate waist,round buttocks, and well-proportioned thighs.
The gentle touch seemed to please her, causing her heart to race.

James's fingertips parted her pussy, and unexpectedly, his penis fiercely penetrated her.
Her pussy tightly twisted around his thick and hard penis, the flesh inside eagerly sucking him in.

She moaned seductively, her small hands touching James all over, igniting a fire everywhere.

James was teased by her seductive eyes, his own eyes turning red with desire.

Grabbing her white buttocks, he thrust into her. His thick penis had to fully enter her pussy every time.

Emily held onto his neck, took the initiative to kiss his lips, and just then,her phone rang. She turned her head to look. It was her father.
###Chapter 38
James went all out, diving deep twice, and Emily's voice broke under his force. She didn't even dare to pick up the phone.

After ringing for a bit, the call ended.

James bit down on Emily's nipple, his tongue swirling around it, gently nibbling with his teeth, while his other hand squeezed her other breast,his hips thrusting.

The phone rang again, loud and insistent.

Biting Emily's earlobe, he growled, "Why not just answer it?"

"James!" Emily bit her lip, her face flushed. Before she could refuse,he hit the answer button.
Emily bit into his shoulder, her breast squeezed by James's hand. Her swollen nipple couldn't take the stimulation, and her body shook. James almost hit her deepest point with every thrust.

Then, Aiden's voice came through. "Come home for dinner tomorrow.Your mom and I miss you."

Emily bit harder,tasting blood.

After a moment of silence, Aiden's tone turned sharp. "Emily, do you have no manners? Can't you speak?"

James paused, feeling something wet and warm from Emily's face on his shoulder.It wasn't sweat.

James tried to lift Emily's face, realizing he might have gone too far.
Emily pushed him away, got up, glanced at James's still-hard penis,feeling her vagina contract slightly. She put on a coat,grabbed her phone, and left.
She was talking to Aiden, her cold voice reaching James's ears.


"I'm the one forsaken. WWhere would I get manners from?"

That's how the old folks and kids used to curse at her in the village.

Aiden, either angry or choked up, stayed silent for a long time.

After a while, Aiden said, "How long has it been since you came back? I heard you even left the Williams Mansion. You're something else."

Emily placed her phone on the kitchen counter, listening to Aiden while eating.James's cooking had gotten better.

Aiden subtly hoped Emily would give in to Veda. Emily ignored him,and
Aiden didn't push, just asking her to come home for a meal.

Emily sipped her red wine and said, "Got it, I'll come back tomorrow."

After hanging up, she returned to the bedroom. James was lying on the bed,naked.

He looked like a male escort ready to serve.

James was a whole different person at work. Thinking about his wild behavior just now, Emily found it hard to look at his lips.

Seeing her come in, James put down his phone and stared at her. "Wanna continue?"

Emily walked up and kissed the corner of his mouth. "Nah, I'm not in the mood anymore."

James muttered, "Shouldn't have answered that call."

Emly just smiled, went to take a shower, and came out exhausted,lying down next to James and falling asleep.
The next day, Emily headed straight to the Johnson Mansion after work.

The Johnson family wasn't too fond of her, including the butler and servants.

When Emily arrived, no one in the living room greeted her. She even caught a few disdainful glances.
"Emily, move aside. Can't you see we're cleaning here? Go tidy up the coffee table. Ms. Veda Johnson's favorite pastries are in the oven, you can take them out."

When Emily first returned to the Johnson Mansion, she used to do housework to please Mia and Aiden.

Her previous humility made these people think they could boss her around.

Emily squinted, sat directly on the sofa, and coldly stared at the butler. "If you can't handle these tasks, you can resign. The Johnson famly didn't hire you to boss around the masters."

"You used to..."

Emily cut him off coldly, "I used to have a good temper. Now that I don't,you can do these tasks alone. Also, don't you know who the young lady of the Johnson family is?"

The butler-didn't expect Emily to say such things and sneered."Mr.Johnson and Mrs. Johnson don't even recognize you."
Emily rubbed her fingertips, raised her hand, and slapped the butler. He was knocked to the ground.
As he was about to get up and argue, he saw the murderous intent in Emily's eyes. She asked, "Finn, are you trying to ruin the relationship between me and my parents by saying they don't recognize me as their daughter?"
Finn retorted. "Do I need to ruin it? The Johnson family doesn't like you and thinks you're superfluous. If you don't come back, the Johnson famnily won't have so many problems."
Emily got up and walked out, but just a few steps away,she heard Aiden's voice behind her. "Why do you leave right after coming back?"
Emily turned around indifferently. "Finn said all of you don't like me and think I'm superfluous. Since I'm not happy to be back, I'll leave now."
Aiden's brow twitched; he stopped Emily and glared at Finn. "Finn,apologize to Emily."

Emily pursed her lips. "I don't need his apology. Today, either he leaves the Johnson Mansion,or I leave."

Aiden frowned and immediately defended Finn, "He's been working for our family for over 20 years. It's not right to just kick him out. Emily, don't make a scene."

Emily looked up at Aiden, finding the whole situation absurd,her voice neither cold nor warm. "Aiden, you refuse to acknowledge me in public,and I've accepted that. You don't like me since I came back, and I've accepted that too. But I still want to ask you; do you think I just deserve to be abused by Isolde and Lucas for 12 years? I wanted to live a normal
and happy life like any other child, but no one ever gave me a chance."

"Now. I don't need your affection anymore. But an outsider with no blood ties can kick me out of my own home, and I'm supposed to just take it?Why?"Emily kicked the door, causing it to shake violently and even dent.

Her gaze was icy as she confronted Aiden.

She pointed at Finn, "Either he goes, or I go! There's no other option."

It was the first time Aiden had ever seen Emily lose her temper. Aiden's heart trembled. He slowly looked at Finn.

"Finn. get this month's salary now. You don't need to come back next month."
###Chapter 39

Finn was totally floored.

He had a cushy gig at the Johnson Mansion with great pay andeasy tasks.Now,out of the blue, he was fired, and with kids to support, he was freaking out.

"Mr. Johnson, I can't lose this job."

Aiden didn't say a word, juast stared at Emily.

Finn turned to Emily, pleading. "Ms. Johnson, I messed up. I shouldn't have bossed you around. Please, give me another shot. I really can't afford to lose this job."

Funny how people only owned up to their mistakes when their interests were on the line.

Emily just smiled. "Why should I give you a chance? You didn't give me one when you didn't feed me."

Aiden frowned,clearly hearing this for the first time. Emily was his daughter, after all, and this made him uncomfortable.

Aiden's gaze turned icy as he looked at Finn, who shrank back, eyes darting around, too scared to speak, He lowered his head,trembling,but deep down, he was fuming at Emily.

The other servants kept quiet. Finn had been at the Johnson Mansion for years, and now he was kicked out over a few words. It was pretty scary.

No one dared to underestimate Emily anymore. At least, they had to show her some respect.
Aiden asked. "Have you ever gone hungry since you came home?"

Emily sneered. "Yeah, thanks to youand Mom. I almost starved."


Aiden was stunned.
"Emily, how can you say that about Dad? He didn't know because you keep everything to yourself." Veda came down the stairs, smiling faintly.

Emily chuckled. "So it's my fault I went hungry?"

Aiden couldn't take Emily's sharp words anymore. His brows knitted tightly, his voice turning colder, "Enough. I called you back for dinner, not to cause trouble."
"Am I supposed to just sit here and get bullied by your family? Even an outsider can push me around because you all don't care about me."

This seemed to hit a nerve with Aiden, a flash of anger in his eyes.

Emily stood at the door, darkness behind her. The lights and warmth of the house seemed to have nothing to do with her.

Aiden was trying hard to keep his cool.

To break the tension, Veda walked up, hugged Emily's arm, and led her back inside, saying gently, "Emily, Dad used to be busy with work.There shouldn't be any bad blood between father and daughter."

Emily walked back in but subtly pulled her hand away.

She said calmly, "We just had a fight at the hospital, and now you're acting all nice like nothing happened. Veda, you really surprise me."

This was exactly why Emily felt disgusted. Veda always played the gentle

and understanding role.

Veda looked conflicted and a bit hurt, lowering her head and saying softly,
"Emily, do we really have to be at odds like this? We're sisters."

Emily rolled her eyes. She couldn't be bothered with Veda. Feeling tired,she plopped down on the sofa and said, "So why did you call me back?Just to make me uncomfortable?"

Aiden finally cracked a smile. "Veda landed a job as a designer at Golden Birch Group."

He looked pretty proud saying that.

Emily just rolled her eyes."She couldn't cut it at the Williams Group."


Veda looked embarrassed.

Aiden's face darkened, a flicker of anger in his eyes. "Wasn't that because you were gunning for her? Veda's your sister. Why treat her like an enemy?"

Emily didn't even bother to argue. Aiden had always played favorites with Veda.

Aiden went on, "And another thing, you need to get Isolde off the hot search."


"Why?"

Aiden frowned. "Don't you get it? Do you want everyone to know you were at Isolde's house? Do you want the world to know Lucas violated you?"

Emily slammed her teacup down, the porcelain shattering and making a

sharp noise that made everyone's ears ring.

Veda's face changed, and she quickly said, "Dad, how can you say that to Emily! Emily, don't be mad. There are too many comments about Isolde online now. If more info gets out, it won't be good for you."

Emily chuckled, feeling speechless at Veda's fake concern. "Are you worried about me, or are you worried people will find out you're Isolde's daughter? Veda, you've really thought this through."

Normal people couldn't be this shameless.

Mia came down from upstairs, looking annoyed at Emily. "You refuse to help a bit, and Veda just spoke well of you. Veda, we don't need her. Let's go eat. I made your favorite dish today."

Mia dragged Veda to the dining room. Emily smirked. This was her biological mother, who only had eyes and heart for Veda,even knowing the online info couldn't have come from Emily.

Emily followed them to the dining room, but there were hardly any dishes she liked on the table. It felt like they get her back just to annoy her.

She took a few bites, and Mia started talking about Veda's job, giving Emily a cold look. "If you ever see Veda at Golden Birch Group,just steer clear,understood?"

Emily clicked her tongue."Why should I?"

"I'm worried about people gossiping about Veda. She can't handle those provocations."

Emily chuckled. "It's her business working at Golden Birch Group. I'm not there, so I won't run into her. Even if I do, I won't bother with her."
Mia frowned. "I'm trying to talk to you nicely. What's with your attitude?"

Emily put down her utensils, a hintof mockery in her voice."Iget that you favor Veda, but why should I avoid her? Mom, you should tell Veda to stay away from me, or her identity won't be the Johnson family's heiress.


Mia slammed her utensils down. "Emily! Are you threatening me?"

Emily smiled faintly. "How is this a threat? Just a friendly reminder. Push me too far, and I can do anything."

Mia was fuming.

Aiden tightened his lips. After a while, he spoke slowly, "Enough,both of you! Emily,why didn't you bring John home tonight?"

Emily raised an eyebrow. "You should ask Veda."
###Chapter 40

The whole dining table went dead silent.

Veda's face showed a flicker of embarrassment.

Everyone knew Emily and John had split, so asking Emily that question was clearly meant to make her uncomfortable. Emily was both confused and annoyed by Aiden's move. Aiden cleared his throat.
Since he brought it up, Emily decided not to hold back for Veda's sake.She said bluntly, "Well, someone doesn't have to be the side chick anymore.She can be John's girlfriend out in the open."

Veda's face turned sour.

Mia, always the defender, shot back, "You were the one who took John first.If you hadn't..."

Aiden banged the table and snapped, "Mia! Watch your mouth."

Mia's face shifted slightly, muttering, "But Emily's just not as much obedient as Veda. Veda's more sensible."

Emily rolled her eyes.

Aiden turned to Emily and said, "I heard you were the one who made the Golden Birch Group and Williams Group deal happen. I want you to represent the Johnson Group and negotiate with Mr. Smith."

Nothing came for free.

Emily glanced lazily at Veda and said, "Since Veda's already working at Golden Birch, she should handle it."
Mia muttered, "It's really hard to get you to do anything."

Aiden whispered, "Veda just started at Golden Birch. It's not right to put her in that position. If people think she's stealing trade secrets, how can she work there?"
Emily chuckled. "I'm actually working at the Williams Group now..."

"But you're a Johnson!" As soon as Emily refused, Aiden's face darkened,and his tone turned icy.

Emily looked at Aiden mockingly and said, "But I don't see myself as a Johnson. Even Finn knows Veda's the heiress,not me."

Aiden opened his mouth but stayed silent.

Mia frowned and grumbled, "It's your attitude that makes us not like you."

Emily calmly replied, "That's fine. I don't need your approval."

She put down her utensils, glanced at the dishes, and smiled wryly.


"Did you know I'm allergic to seafood?"

The three of them froze, forks in mid-air.

Mia's face showed a mix of embarrassment and irritation. "You should've said that earlier. You never tell us what you like. Are we supposed to guess?"

Emily was already numb to it, so Mia's words didn't surprise her.

The Johnson Group was in the perfume business, which is why neither Emily nor Veda worked there. The 'Sky Scent' brand under the Johnson Group was well-known but not dominant.
Aiden said, "If Cassia hadn't turned us down, I wouldn't have to go to Mr.Smith. Cassia's reputation is too strong now. We can't let them keep growing."

Emily raised an eyebrow, a hint of amusement in her eyes.

The Golden Birch Group had a lot going on, but things weren't as smooth behind the scenes as they seemed. Emily heard from James that the perfume brand 'Eternal Scent' was run by his sister.
But James and his sister? They didn't get along at all! Word was, they had a major falling out.

Emily was about to say something when her phone rang.

She glanced at the screen and saw it was John's buddy, Joshua Thomas.He said, "Emily, John's drunk and yelling for you to come get him. Can you come over?"

Emily seized the moment. "John's drunk and needs me to pick him up, so I'm outta here."

She noticed Veda's face change.

Mia frowned."Why doesn't he ask..."

Veda,looking all hurt, shook her head and said, "Just let Emily go."

Emily ignored her and left. She wasn't interested in Aiden's business talk anyway. His demand was just a guilt trip.

At the Skyline Club, Emily walked into private room 506 and saw John sprawled out on the sofa, totally wasted.

Emily knew John's friends well, maybe even better than John did.
Everyone went quiet when she walked in. Joshua came over and whispered. "I don't know what's up with John. He called us all out,then started drinking alone. Didn't say a word all night. Then he asked us to call you."

Emily figured he couldn't handle the fact that his sweet, innocent Veda had turned out to be a schemer.

Ignoring John,she said, "You should call Veda. I'm not gonna help."


Joshua scratched his head. "Who's Veda?"

Emily didn't bother arguing. "Looks like you haven't had much to drink.

Help me get him up."

Joshua helped lift John, following Emily out.

In the lobby of the Skyline Club, John suddenly woke up. He shoved Joshua away and waved his hand. "I'm not going back. I can still drink."

Emily stopped and turned to him. "If you can still walk, get a designated driver and go home yourself."

John, still dazed, looked at Emily and suddenly pulled her into his arms."
Emmy, I miss you so much..."

Emily froze. She didn't expect John to call her Emmy. A strange ache hit her heart.

John held her tighter, almost burying his head in her neck, his voice breaking. "Why didn't you come find meoverseas? Why can't you just give in to me? Why did you leave me?"

Emily thought, 'I'm the one who got left behind.'
She hesitated, then pushed John away firmly. "John, look closely. I'm not Veda."
John's eyes flickered, and he stumbled towards her again. "I know you're Emmy.I just want you. It's because of you that I've become like this. How can you abandon me!"

Emily dodged his touch, thinking he was out of his mind.

She tried to avoid him, but John grabbed her wrist. Just then, a group of people walked out of an elevator.

James, leading the group, stopped in his tracks. Naturally, everyone else did too, following his gaze.

Eric's eyes nearly popped out. He thought, 'Is James's girlfriend getting tangled up with someone else?'
###Chapter 41
"Is it really Ms. Johnson?" Eric asked,glancing cautiously at James.

James's face was stone-cold, radiating a chilling aura that kept everyone silent.
Meanwhile, John yanked Emily harshly into his arms. The weight of his body pressed down on her, making it hard for her to push him away, and she stumbled a bit under the pressure.
Joshua sighed,"Emily, why don't you just take him home? It's late, andit s not convenient for us to go to the Williams Mansion. Please, Emily."
Emily nodded reluctantly and helped John out of the Skyline Club.


Everyone kept an eye on James's expression.

Brian Scott smirked, "Emily's got some nerve, sneaking around with our young Mr. Smith. When has Mr. Smith ever been treated like this? Mr.Smith, why don't you let me handle her? I'll make sure she pays for it."

James stayed silent.

Everyone assumed he agreed with Brian, except for Eric, who shot Brian a disapproving look. This wasn't the time for jokes.

Eric knew James well. If James admitted Emnily was his girlfriend, he wouldn't let anyone else near her.

Someone teased Brian, "You just want her for yourself, don't you? You've already got seven girlfriends, and you're still looking for more?"

Laughter erupted.
Brian grinned, "Women love flowers, diamonds, and money. If I give Ms.Johnson enough, she'll be mine. Then I'll treat you all to dinner and dump her right in front of you. I'll crush her self-esteem."
Brian's words grew more explicit. "When I sleep with her,I'll take photos and videos and send them to you."
Eric sighed, glancing at James, and took a step back. Suddenly, James turned and punched Brian hard in the face, sending him staggering.
James glared at Brian. "Touch her, and you'll regret it."

Everyone was stunned, except for Eric. He wanted to step in, but James stormed out.

He saw Emily and John getting into a car. Without his own car, he couldn'

t follow them. He pulled out his phone to call Emily.

Emily had just gotten into the car when her phone died as she was about to answer James's call.

She shrugged it off, not too concerned.

After dropping John off, she was about to leave when he grabbed her wrist.


"Emmy, don't go." Emily pulled away, a flicker of annoyance in her eyes.

John's long eyelashes trembled. He seemed to have forgotten the past few years,only talking about their childhood.

"You were this little girl, huddled in the corner like a broken Barbie doll. I just thought, I have to protect you," John said.

A pang of bitterness hit Emily, but she quickly pushed it aside.
Back then, John had really gotten under her skin. She was young and clueless about love, but as she grew up, her feelings for John quietly took root.

But then John bailed on their wedding. Over the next three years, she tried to push him out of her heart. Feelings couldn't endure such strain and erosion.

John kept rambling about his feelings, but Emily wasn't paying attention.She was busy looking for a charger at his place.

Emily wondered why John didn't even have a charger in his room.

Just as she was about to leave, John blurted out, "You're a bad woman.You rejected me first, and then blamed it on me."

Emily frowned. 'What is he talking about? Did I do something unforgivable?' she thought.

"John, what do you mean by that? Is there something I don't know?"

Half-asleep, John opened his eyes, grabbed Emily's hand, and made her touch the scar on his waist. Only then did she feel the scar.

"Do you think I'm ugly? You even told me to die!" he said.

Seeing the scar, her eyes darkened.

She remembered this scar. When Lucas tried to take her away by force,Emily refused, and John stepped in. A fight broke out, and Lucas, always ruthless,stabbed John, leaving him with the scar.

John was jast a teenager then. He spent half a month in the hospital,almost losing his life.

Emily's feelings were mixed. But she didn't feel like she owed John anything. During the three years he was gone, she had been dedicated to the Williams Group.
She helped keep the Williams Group afloat, making its Diamond Glow flourish. All for John.

What Hayden and Wilder said about giving her shares or making John give up his inheritance rights was all to force John to be with her.
Emily looked indifferent, raised her hand, and slapped John. "Don't play these games with me."
She had never despised the scar on John's waist, and she truly didn't understand his accusation. It was absurd.





Seeing John about to cry, Emily rolled her eyes, got up, and left,running into Calliope coming out of the bedroom.

Calliope was surprised to see her, her eyes lighting up, insisting she stay.Emily reluctantly agreed.

The next morning, Emily was having breakfast downstairs when John came down. His expression instantly became complicated, and his head seemed to ache even more. He sat down across from Emily.

"You brought me back last night?" John asked in a deep voice.

Emily nodded. "Next time you're drunk, have your friends take you to Veda."
John's expression changed slightly, a hint of something flashing in his eyes."Next time. I'll tell them we've split up, and I won't let them bother you again."

Emily's face remained indifferent. "That's good."
###Chapter 42

John couldn't help but stare at Emily's fresh, makeup-free face. She looked so innocent, like a college kid with those clear eyes and that hint of naivety.

He felt a little flutter in his chest but quickly pushed it down.

After a beat, he finally said, "I figured out the whole trendling mess. It was Veda messing with you. I'm here to apologize for her. I'm sorry."

Emily raised an eyebrow, giving him a look that made him squirm a bit.

Taking a deep breath, he added, "If you want any compensation, just let me know. I'll do what I can."

Emily's voice was calm, "Don't worry. I won't let Veda leave you."

John felt a bit uneasy.

Emily took a bite of her bread and said, "Veda framed me, so I fought back. Neither of us has gained anything so far. But I've got more tricks up my sleeve. You should tell her to stay away from me and not mess with me again."

John was stunned. The Emily who had first come to the Johnson Mansion was always so eager to please them. Now, she was a whole different person.

Emily kept eating, not caring about John's reaction. When it came to the Isolde situation, she knew she wouldn't be the one to lose. However, she still had a soft spot for Aiden and Mia, as they had ended badly with Isolde for her sake back then.

But what Emily couldn't understand was why her own parents would

dislike her. Even though she had lived in the countryside for ten years,she was still their child. She kept these thoughts to herself as she ate slowly.


Out of nowhere, John asked, "Did I say anything weird when i was drunk last night?"

Emily's eyesinstinctively went to his waist.

John frowned."You saw it?"


Emily nodded. "With today's medical advancements, you can get scars removed completely. I just didn't expect you to care so much about it."

The scar was about 4 inches long, a bit ugly from the stitches.

She had seen the wound and the scar when John was in the hospital.She just didn't expect the scar to grow over time.

John's eyes flashed with disgust. "Emily, don't look at me with that pity.It disgusts me."

Emily frowned. "Are you nuts? I was grateful you saved me back then.and that hasn't changed. Why do you have to be so mean?"

John looked at her mockingly, suddenly losing his appetite. "Didn't you write in your diary that you were disgusted by the sear on my body?"

Emily laughed, "When did I write that? I don't remember, John,if that's what you think of me:I won't argue. I don't owe you anything, and I don t feel guilty,"

She continued.17Inever wrote such things. I didn't expect you to distrust me like this."


Emily chuckled bitterly. "Is that why you chose Veda? I really can't respect you."


The trust between them had crumbled so quickly that even Emily found it laughable.


John's anger seemed to dissolve with Emily's words, and he started to doubt himself.


Taking a deep breath, John said, "It's been years, so I don't have any proof."


Emily locked eyes with him, the tension in the room thickening.

"John, since you've chosen Veda, be good to her. But after what happened on Twitter, you should realize she's not as pure and kind as she seems. Be careful."

Out of nowhere, John asked, "Are you planning to get back at her?"

Emily just kept eating, thinking how absurd John's question was. She wasn't the type to just let things slide.

A shadow crossed John's face. He felt like he had brought this mess on himself.

After a while, Emily said, "I'll take back what's mine."

John's eyes turned cold. "I'm a person, not something you can control."

Emily sighed, thinking, 'I already have James. Why would I need you?


But she didn't want to argue, so she let it go.

After finishing their mea, they parted ways, both feeling displeased.

Emily headed straight to work and only returned to Crystal Valley Manor after her shift. She left work on time and was surprised to see the lights on when she got home.

As soon as she walked in, she saw James coming down the stairs.

Sensing his off mood, she half-joked, "Who made Mr. Smith angry?"

She was about to head upstairs for a shower when James's gloomy voice stopped her. "Why did you turn off your phone? Why didn't you answer my calls?"

Emily suddenly remembered James had called her. She had meant to charge her phone at the office and call him back, but meetings had kept her busy all day. Her mind was filled with design drafts and contract issues.

She glanced at her phone. James had called a dozen times, the most recent one just half an hour ago.

Feeling guilty, Emily said, "I forgot. Do you believe me?"

Seeing no change in James's stern expression, Emily leaned in and kissed him, trying to lighten the mood. "Alright, darling, it's not a big deal.I'll make it up to you after I freshen up. How about that?"

Normally, this would have calmed James down, but now his face only grew darker.

Taking a deep breath, James asked, "Who were you with last night?"

Without thinking, Emily replied, "John."

James laughed bitterly. "Am I your pet? You play with me when you're

happy and ignore me when you're not, not even answering my calls! Were you having a romantic time with John at the Skyline Club?"

His face darkened, eyes filled with uncontrollable anger.

"Are you getting back with him because of the Williams family's favor towards you, or is it about rekindling an old flame with him? Don't you find him dirty anymore now?"
###Chapter 43

James always got this weird, uncomfortable feeling whenever he thought about Emily and John being so close.


Being just a regular guy, James's angry words could be pretty hurtful too.

He grabbed Emily's chin and sneered, "I never knew Ms. Johnson was so good at comforting men. Are you planning to get back with John? Or maybe you're thinking about a threesome with me and John?"

Emily's face turned icy, but there was a slight smile at the corner of her mouth that sent chills down anyone's spine.

"James, you've crossed the line," she said.

James frowned, his eyes dark and stormy.

Emily's smile faded, and she calmly said, "Our relationship isn't deep enough for me to explain everything to you. So, don't act like you're interrogating a suspect. We never talked about feelings in the first place.Why are you acting like a betrayed victim?"

She stared at James and continued, "I can only tell you that nothing happened between John and me last night that broke our rules. If you can't handle it, you can end this relationship right now, and I'll move out immediately."

James looked at the emotionless Emily. He knew if he agreed to end it, she'd pack up and leave without hesitation.

This thought almost drove him crazy. For the first time,he felt out of control because of a woman. He stormed out of Crystal Valley Manor.

Emily watched him leave, feeling even more exhausted, but a strange emotion flickered in her mind,making her uneasy.

She went to the bathroom, soaking in the water, with traces of James's playful marks on her chest and thighs.

Emily closed her eyes. She had fought with John at the Williams Mansion and then argued with James at Crystal Valley Manor.

It was normal for men to be possessive.

But she hadn't broken their agreement. If everyone wanted her to lower herself to please them, it was just too tiring.

Originally, she and James had ended this abnormal relationship she had started.

But now that James's status had changed, it wasn't up to her to end it.The ball was entirely in James's court.

But honestly, Emily didn't want to keep this relationship going.

She sighed. "Men are really hard to deal with."

To her, James was even more trouble than John.

As Emily expected, in the following days, James didn't contact her or return to Crystal Valley Manor.

Every day, Emily wondered if her relationship with James was over so that there was no need to develop it further or stay in touch.

As time passed, Emily realized that with James's status and position, it wasn't worth wasting time on her.

She felt somewhat relieved but also a bit unhappy. She was thinking about James when she looked down at her design drafts and realized they were all about him.


Emily rolled her eyes, feeling totally exasperated. She thought, "With so many great guys out there, why am I so huing up on James?"

She rubbed her forehead, feeling a headache coming on.

Just then, her assistant burst into the office, all excited. "Ms. Johnson,you need to check Twitter right now. The comments section has totally flipped!"

Emily finally picked up her phone.

Before, all the comments on Twitter were trashing her. But now, most people were apologizing because someone had spilled the tea on Isolde and Lucas.

The villagers were calling out Isolde and Lucas for verbally and physically abusing Emily,even starving her.

Reporters talked to the villagers, who said Isolde never liked Emily,probably because she knew early on that Emily wasn't her daughter and even thought about selling her. But Emily was smart and got away.

Some even said that Veda was Isolde's real daughter and that the baby swap was on purpose because Isolde didn't want her own kid to suffer.

Veda was suddenly getting roasted online.

"I used to think Veda was innocent, but she's just a fake."

"Veda lived the high life that should have been Emily'sfor over a decade,and she even tried to steal Emily's fiancé."

"Such a gross person. And Emily's parents still keep her at the Johnson Mansion? Aren't they worried their own daughter will be disgusted?"

The comments had done a complete 180.

To dig up all this dirt and keep Lucas's assault on her under wraps while controlling public opinion, Emily could only think of one person-James.

Emily wondered if she should call him to say thanks.

As she left the office that night, she saw a veryfamiliar car parked outside.James's driver had smartly parked it in a dark spot. After a moment of hesitation, Emily walked over.

James got out of the car, staring at her intently, and said, "If I hadn't come to you today, would you have never reached out to me?"

Emily didn't answer that but asked, "Did you handle the online comments?



She had originally planned to letthe rumors die down on their own,thinking it would cost a lot to deal with them.

With his arms crossed, James said, "Yeah, I handled it. It cost quite a bit.How are you planning to repay me?"

Emily played along. "I'll treat you to dinner tonight."

James took her straight to Celestial Cuisine.

The private rooms were all booked, so Emily had to settle for a window seat with a view of the entire Emerald City.

James had to take a work call, so Emily ordered on her own.

But soon, a familiar voice called out, "Emily, are you eating here too?"

Emily looked up and saw Aiden and Mia, with Veda standing between them.


Despite their recent fallout, Emily stood up and greeted them politely."Dad,Mom."


She glanced at Mia a little longer. Mia looked at her coldly without responding.

Aiden smiled and said, "Veda's birthday is coming up in a few days, and we're planning a birthday banquet for her here."
###Chapter 44

Without giving Emily a chance to speak, Veda jumped in, "Hey, my birthday's the same day as Emily's. Emily, you should totally join us."

Emily had never really celebrated her birthday before. Isolde used to be so petty, and after she got back to the Johnson family, Mia thought she was too plain and never bothered to celebrate with her.

It was only after she married John in name that she got to celebrate her birthday three times at the Williams Mansion, all thanks to Calliope, and she even got birthday gifts.

Emily calmly replied, "I don't want to steal your thunder. You should be the star of the show."

Throwing a big birthday bash was just a way to show everyone that Veda was the Johnson family's daughter. Aiden and Mia really did dote on Veda.

Veda felt a bit uneasy, licking her back teeth. Why did Emily always seem so high and mighty?

Taking a deep breath, she grabbed Mia's arm and said sweetly, "Mom,Emily's your daughter too. I want us to celebrate together. You and Emily can't stay like this forever. Moms and daughters can't really hate each other,right?"

Veda's thoughtful words really hit Mia in the feels.

Mia glanced at Emily with a hint of disdain and said, "You should take a page out of Veda's book."

Emily stayed quiet. She never tried to please Mia, who always thought she was wrong no matter what she did.

Feeling bored. Mia just took Veda and left. The relationship between Mia and Emily was completely iced over.

Aiden looked at Emily helplessly, walked over, patted her shoulder, and said softly, "Your mom's just like that. Try talking to her when you get home."


Emily gave a faint smile.

If talking could fix things, she and Mia wouldn't have been so distant for all these years.

But lately, the whole true and false heiress drama of the Johnson family was blowing up online. So many versions of the story were floating around.

At first, only a few people in the upper-class circles knew a bit about the truth. Now, it was all over Twitter, making it a big deal.

Veda was the most pissed. Now everyone in Emerald City knew that Veda's real parents were Isolde and Lucas, both of whom had terrible reputations.

People were trashing her online, which is why Veda wanted to use this birthday party to show everyone she was the real deal, the true heiress of the Johnson family.

She thought she was way more impressive than Emily. 'Why are those netizens hating on me? What does Emily have that I don't?'

Veda clung to Mia's arm and whispered, "Mom, I really want to celebrate my birthday with Emily."

In a soft tone, she added, "A lot of people online are talkingabout me and Emily. It's fine if they criticize me, but you,Dad,and Emily don't deserve

this. I don't want you guys to get dragged into this mess because of me."

Veda ended with a touch of sadness. "Mom, it's all my fault."

Mia hugged Veda lovingly, feeling that Veda, who had been raised by her side since childhood, knew how to care for her.


Mia sighed. "Emily never listens to me."

Mia felt helpless with her own daughter.

To keep Veda happy, Mia said, "Alright, I'll find some time to talk to her."

'Emily would definitely give Mom this face,'Veda thought.

Not long after Aiden left, James came back. He had actually finished his call earlier, but seeing Emily talking to her parents, he hung back.

James sat across from Emily and asked,"Missed me lately?"

Emily blinked, a bit surprised. She didn't answer right away.

After a moment, she smiled, reached out, and pinched his cheek. "Of course, I've been thinking about you all the time."

James clicked his tongue. He had been holding back, not seeing or messaging Emily. He didn't expect her to ignore him too.

He stared at his phone every day, making everyone at the company think he had lost it.

But now, seeing Emily's bright face, all his anger melted away.

James's cold expression softened a bit, but he still had someresentment."If you missed me, why didn't you reach out first?"

Emily smiled. "I didn't want to bother you with your busy schedule."

James didn't have the heart to call out her excuse. He knew if he hadn't reached out, they might have drifted apart. Emily showed no sign of trying to keep him.

"I just ordered a bunch of your favorite dishes. Consider it an apology,"Emily said.

James snorted. "Apologies are useless."

Emily furrowed her brow. "James, enough!"

James fell silent. He realized that with someone like Emily, he couldn't lose his temper or play disappearing acts. He was completely under her spell.

If Emily left him and fell for someone else, he'd definitely regret it.

During the meal, James thought of something and slowly said,"When I was looking into Isolde, I found some interesting stuff. Want to know?"

Emily looked at him curiously. "What did you find?"

James handed his phone to Emily, showing her a video.

Emily was surprised. "How did you get this?"

She knew Isolde wouldn't easily send Veda back tothe Johnson family because Isolde and Lucas were selfish, only caring about their own interests.

In the video, Veda gave Isolde some money. It was cash, and the exact amount was unclear.

But it was clear that over the years, Veda must have been supporting

Isolde and Lucas. It was only after Veda went abroad that they lost contact,and the money stopped.

No wonder when she told Isolde that Veda had returned, Isolde was furious.

James casually replied, "It wasn't hard to find. How you handle it is up to you."

From the angle of the footage, it was clear this surveillance was tricky to get.

Emily said, "Thanks. You've really helped me a lot."

She rested her head on her hand, gazing tenderly at him,"Mr.Smith,I owe you another favor. How can I repay it?"

James didn't like her clear-cut attitude. He frowned slightly and said,somewhat displeased, "I like you owing me favors."

That way, she could be indebted to him forever.


Emily just smiled at this.
###Chapter 45

Emily and James were quietly munching on their dinner.

After a bit. Veda showed up. She had to play nice in front of Aiden and Mia, so she couldn't go off on Emily right then and there.

But when she spotted a guy with his back to her, sitting across from Emily,she was taken aback. Was Emily cheating?

As Emily was nibbling on some cake, she whispered something to the guy,and out of nowhere, he stood up and planted a kiss on her lips. They made out like there was no tomorrow.

When they finally pulled apart, Emily's cheeks were flushed,and she had this charming smile, like a breath of fresh air.

Veda's initial shock quickly turned into excitement. Emily cheating meant she had a legit reason to be with John.

She whipped out her phone, recorded a video, and sent it straight to John,who was still burning the midnight oil at work.

John was a bit thrown when he got the message. Before he could even watch the video, Veda's texts started flooding in.

(John, is there something going on between you and Emily? Why is she all lovey-dovey with another guy?]

[I know you haven't wanted to talk to me because I messed up, but I can't stand seeing Emily make a fool out of you.]

[John, I just want you to be happy.]


Reading Veda's messages. John felt a pang in his chest. But when he finally wwatched the video of Emily kissing another guy, his hurt turned into pure rage.

When Emily first mentioned she had a boyfriend, he thought she was just trying to mess with him, to get him to come running back.

But now, seeing that she actually had a boyfriend, the betrayal hit him hard.He called Emily,seething.

Emily wiped her mouth as they finished eating, and her phone rang.James saw John's name on the screen and his face darkened. Emily glanced at James before picking up.

John's voice was tight with anger. "Emily, who are you with? What are you doing?"

Emily replied coolly, "I'm having dinner with a friend. Got a problem with that?"

John's veins were popping. He yelled, "Emily, how dare you cheat on me!"

Emily scoffed. "John, our marriage is a sham. And you were the first to cheat."

John shot back, "So many people thinks you're my wife. Have you thought about how this makes me look?"

If he hadn't changed his mind and left in the middle of getting the marriage certificate, he would've married Emily.

Rolling her eyes, Emily said, "Did you think about my dignity when you ran off with your mistress?"


John was a mess of emotions, breathing heavily. Even through the phone Emily could tell he was fuming.

She said coldly. "We haven't been a real couple for ages. So stay out of my business,got it?"

Emily hung up, her eyes meeting James's. His frown had finally eased.

Emily grinned and asked, "Feeling better now,boyfriend?"

James, keeping a straight face, replied, "The term 'boyfriend' does have a nice ring to it."

Resting her chin on her hands, Emily smiled and stared at James. "Are all you guys possessive in such a weird way?"

James's focus shifted. "Do you have other men?"

Emily rolled her eyes. "Not even gonna dignify that with a response."

She started to ask, "It wasn't you who told..." but stopped herself. James wasn't that clueless, and she had spotted Veda nearby.

It was just a video, and she didn't care. She was done with John and could be with whoever she wanted.

After Emily hung up on him, John threw his phone in frustration. He took a deep breath,feeling really ticked off.

When the phone rang again, he reluctantly picked it up, thinking it was Emily calling to explain. But it was another message from Veda.

Seeing Veda's comforting words only made him more irritated. He felt like he had lost something important.

Not wanting to deal with Veda, he turned off his phone. Veda, not getting a reply from John, started to feel a sense of loss. For the first time in years,John was ignoring her.

The next day, wwhen Emily got to the office, she found breakfast spread out,dazzling everyone.

There was a table loaded with coffee and desserts, and a crowd had already gathered to dig in.

Emily's assistant pulled her over and said, "Ms. Johnson, all this was sent by Mr. Williams, under Veda's name. You should have some too."

Emily and John's relationship wasn't public at the company. She thought,Is Veda still trying to mess with me?'

Emily didn't touch the food and asked, "Didn't Veda already resign?"

The assistant replied, "She's coming in today to finalize the resignation,should be here soon."

After a while, Veda finished the resignation process and brought John over.

She said, "Emily, I had John order your favorite waffles. Try some."


Veda smiled warmly.

Emily watched them calmly and said, "I'm not hungry. You two go ahead."

Veda's smile brightened. "John said I looked haggard lately,so I should eat more to take care of my health."

John looked at her fondly. "After that incident, you've been weak. The doctor didn't even want you to come to work. Besides, I can support you.Yet you still insist on coming in."

Everyone blinked and said, "Ms. Veda Johnson, Mr. Williams,you two are so sweet."


Even though their opinion of Veda had dropped, she was still John's girlfriend, so they had to show some respect. When it came to actual benefits,people would say nice things.

Seeing them act all lovey-dovey, Emily smiled sincerely. "You two have been dating for three or four years. When's the wedding? I'm looking forward to it."


John looked at Emily, hoping to see a hint of jealousy. But there was nothing.

Emily was completely calm.
###Chapter 46

For most folks, it was just a simple blessing. But for John and Veda, it was pure sarcasm.

John's face darkened. When Emily said those words, she didn't seem to care at all. It was like she was giving a friendly blessing. He felt stifled and really ticked off.

Emily knew full well that he and Veda could never get mnarried,yet she still said it like that.

The people around them didn't notice the tension and just joined in the teasing.

"Mr. Williams, you've been dating forever. You should totally get married."

"The wedding better be grand. Can't wait to see it."

Everyone was laughing and offering their blessings.

Veda's face was pretty sour. She said uneasily, "If we have a wedding,you all have to come."

Suddenly,someone in the crowd piped up, "I remember three years ago the Williams family had a wedding. It was super fancy, but not many people were invited. It seemed like a business deal, but I heard the groom ran away for the other woman."

As he spoke, his voice got weaker, and he eventually looked down. He was just being blunt and didn't think before speaking,earning him several cold glares. Feeling embarrassed,he scratched his head.

But after that reminder, everyone started to remember the incident.
The story of the Williams family heir running away from the wedding was trending on Twitter for three days, but it had been so long that everyone had forgotten.

Suddenly,people started whispering to each other.

"Could Veda be the other woman?"

"It was a business deal, and Veda's family background seems good. Maybe she ran away from him back then?"

"Wasn't it said online that Veda wasn't the Johnson family's daughter? It couldn't have been a marriage with her."

Even though the discussions were quiet, in the small office space, it was like they were pointing fingers and scolding Veda to her face. Veda's expression darkened.

Suddenly, someone looked at Emily and asked, "Ms. Emily Johnson, you and Veda are sisters. Is Veda..."

He didn't finish, but everyone knew he was asking if Veda was the other woman.

Emily glared at him, "You speak so bluntly; how are you going to survive in the workplace?"

Then she joked, "So what if Mr. Williams gets married? He can always get divorced,right?"

Emily slowly looked at John and smiled slightly. "Isn't that right, Mr.Williams?"

Emily's words confirmed that John had been married and divorced.And,

Veda was likely the other woman!

"Emily! Enough!"John was furious.

Veda quickly grabbed John's arm and said to everyone, "I'm resigning today and will become a jewelry designer at Golden Birch Group. I hope you all do well too."

A hint of envy flashed in everyone's eyes.

Someone said, "With your qualifications, it's easy to get into Golden Birch Group."

Everyone started praising Veda again.

Emily was tired of it and casually said, "I hope to see your original creations in the future, Veda."

Veda felt embarrassed, like she could never get the upper hand over Emily.

Just then,someone walked in with a huge bouquet of roses, even adorned with pink diamonds that sparkled. Everyone there was a jewelry designer,so they knew their diamonds. It must've been cut from a massive pink diamond into hundreds of pieces-a real waste.

The person walked into the design department and asked, "Excuse me,who is Ms.Johnson?"

Everyone's eyes instantly landed on Veda.

Veda thought John was surprising her and smiled brightly, looking shyly at him. "John,thank you."

John frowned, confused. He hadn't bought any roses.
Exetrone eavied Veda as she went to sign for the flowers, anril the staff sald. Phease sign your name here."
The stalt howned slightly after seeing hef name: "Your name is Veda?"

Vede woded with a smile, about to take the flowers, when the person sold."These fhowers are for someone named Emily, net you."

Veda's smie hoze her hand hanging awkwardly in the air.

Emily welked up, signed her name neatly, and thanked the staff."Thanks for bringing them up."

She knew they were from James. Emily lightly tapped the roses with her fingertips.

The assistant looked surprised. "Ms. Johnson, you have a boyfriend?"

Emily noddled. Remembering James's jealous look, she couldn't help but laugh.

The assistant teased, "Ms. Johnson, that's such a big deal, yet you only telling us now. Is there any friendship left between us?"

Emily just smiled, not planning to introduce themn to James. If they really mer him mey d probably be scared to death.

Emily saw are card on the flowers, smiled slightly, and walked into the elevator with the bouquet. As she was about to take a picture for social media john suddenly barged into the elevator.

The door dosed, leaving everyone a bif confused.

"Wait,why is Mr. Williams so angry? Emily isn't his girlfriend."
Everyone was puzzled, discussing Emily, while Veda stood there alone.

Inside the elevator. John grabbed her arm as she was taking a picture, his gaze icy. "Who is the guy? Emily, you actually dare to betray me."

John's anger had been simmering since yesterday. Now that this guy appeared, he couldn't hold back. He wanted to tear Emily apart right then.

Emily felt a bit of pain from his grip. Debating whether to drop the flowers and fight him, she instead stomped hard on his foot.

"John, we haven't been a thing for a long time. Stay away from me."

As the elevator doors opened, she walked out in her high heels, looking around, and John followed behind her.

He asked, "Is that adulterer downstairs?"

Emily frowned. "Do you have any manners? He's my boyfriend."

The term "boyfriend" made John's eyes burn with jealousy.

He grabbed Emily's arm, stopping her from leaving, took a deep breath,and asked again, "Who is the adulterer? I will expose him today."

At that momenat, a figure appeared behind Emily, wrapping his arms around her waist. His clear voice dropped unexpectedly. "Mr. Williams, it's me."
###Chapter 47

John was already fuming, but as he saw the man's face, his anger morphed into pure shock. He was totally frozen.

"Mr.Smith?"

He had imagined a million scenarios, even thinking the roses were part of some drama Emily cooked up herself.

But James had already swooped in and wrapped his arms around Emily.

"Skip work today, alright? It's just some design sketches. Come hang out at my office."

Emily stared at him, wide-eyed. "Did you really come all this way just to say that?"

John could see the affection in James' eyes for Emily. Their conversation flowed naturally, with Emily's voice soft and a bit playful.

John took a deep breath and asked, "Mr. Smith, what's going on between you and my wife?"

At Amelia's birthday bash, John and Emily had shown up as a married couple. Now, watching the two of them, Johnfelt a chill run down his spine.

With James' status, he shouldn't be chasing after a married woman like Emily.

James held Emily's slim waist, his gaze on John as cold as ice.

James said, "If you can't see clearly, Mr. Williams, maybe you should visit

an eye doctor."

John's anger flared. "Doesn't Mr. Smith know that Emily is a married woman?"

James chuckled,buat his words dripped with sarcasm. "Married woman?

Then show me the marriage certificate."

John's face went pale. It was clear James knew they hadn't officially registered their marriage.

Suddenly. John felt unsure. Panic flashed in his eyes, and the fear of losing something important grew.

Taking a deep breath, John said coldly, "We might not have registered our marriage, but we had a wedding. That makes us a legitimate couple.And for the past three years, Emily has been living in my house!"

He continued, "My wife is beautiful, sure, but Mr. Smith has seen plenty of beauties. You shouldn't let this tarnish the Smith family's reputation and make both our families a joke."

John suspected Emily had met James during her dealings with the Golden Birch Group. No wonder the deal went through so smoothly.

What he hadn't expected was that not having a marriage certificate gave Emily the green light to attract other men,

Even without a marriage certificate, James couldn't ignore their three-year relationship.

James' eyes were cold, and he smiled mockingly. "Mr. Williams, you're shameless. Without a marriage certificate, there's no marriage. When you left Emily alone on your wedding day, did you think yourself as her

bushaid

He cosmaed. When you got Voda pegnant did you dhink about Fimily waiing for you at home?i

He sdded."As hu the fmith family: no cne daree in sny anyihing hunì mhe Wiliams family's mputation has been trashed by you. Mr. Willioma"

With that James took Emily's hand and got into the caHE

John was leh red -faced and trembling unable to come up with n sìngle wond to counter James. All he could do was watch Emily leave with him.

But he couldn't wrap his head around is How could Emily be so close to James? And why would James, who supposedly had no interest in women.be into Emily?

His mind was racing with queations. In the end, he chalked it up to coincidence.

John kept trying to convince himself that Emily was behind it all. The roses must have been her doing, out of jealousy towards Veda.She probably ordered them herself.

Going to James' office to work on design drafts? That had to be just for better collaboration, nothing more.

John's thoughts were a jumbled mess.

Veda followed them out, but by the time she got there, Emily was already gone.

She walked up to John and cautiously took his arm. "John, do you still love Emily?"


Veda only asked when she felt really insecure.

In the past, John would have firmly denied it, but today, he was unusually irritable and fell silent for a moment.

Veda's heart skipped a beat. If John still loved Emily, they might reconcile,and all her plans would be ruined.

Veda clung to John's arm tightly, her eyes welling up with tears.

She said, "Emily is really amazing, so it's normal for you to like her. But you shouldn't have used me this morning."

Veda knew he had come to the Williams Group just to make Emily jealous.

She had told him she could quietly leave the Williams Group because there were too many rumors online about her and Emily. Her reputation was really bad, and she didn't want to embarrass herself.

But John had insisted. Now he just walked away with Emily,leaving her the biggest joke.

"I never wanted any status by your side, but sometimes I envy others having weddings, and I hope for your divorce from Emily. But I know that's impossible. So why am I the one being sacrificed?"

Veda slowly squatted down, full of sadness, her shoulders trembling as she cried softly.

"John, can you divorce Emily? Even if you don't marry me,can you at least give me the status of being your girlfriend, please?"

Veda slowly looked up at him, her eyes pleading, innocent and pitiful,like an abandoned kitten on the side of the road.

But to John's surprise, he found that he couldn't soften towards Veda.It was like something was keeping them apart.

Moreover, Veda wasn't as innocent as she seemed. Otherwise, there wouldn't be so much fabricated dirt on Emily in her computer.

Veda had never known about their lack of marriage registration.

John stared at her, speaking each word deliberately, "You said before that you didn't care about status, and you just wanted to be with me."


John didn't want to explain to Veda about their lack of marriage registration. He was getting annoyed.

And upon hearing his words, Veda forgot to cry and began to feel panic.

John had always promised to eventually give her the position of his wife.

But at this moment, John's eyes were cold and intimidating, with a hint of scrutiny, making her feel very unfamiliar and fearful.

Her tears and weakness were of no use to John anymore.
###Chapter 48

Veda's head was spinning. She could be herself around John because she knew he couldn't stand Emily.

But after Emily went to the hospital and showed some proof, John started ghosting her and ignoring her feelings.

Veda felt like a total fool.

Her voice got all shaky. "I just wanted to have kids with you from the start.
I'd never mess around with my body or our future kids. John, you know how much I love you. I'm even willing to be seen as the other woman.
But you still don't believe me."

Knowing Veda couldn't have kids, John felt a pang of sympathy.

He quickly said, "I won't let you suffer."

John's change in attitude left Veda cold. Before heading home from abroad,
he had kept promising he'd make her his wife. But now, with more contact with Emily,he was all wishy-washy.

Veda pressed her lips together. That issue had always been a sore spot for her. If John found out all the misunderstandings between him and Emily were her doing, he'd definitely hate her.

She needed to push for their divorce. And the only way to do that was to mess with Emily.

Veda only knew that Emily and John were separated, and Emily had left the Williams Mansion. She didn't know their marriage was a sham. For Emily and John, it wasn't something to brag about. So Aiden and Mia didn't know either.


And now. Veda had a plan.

Emily sat in James's car, leaning against the window, watching the scenery go by. Her eyes were half-closed, like she didn't care about anything. But James knew she was upset.

James wrapped his arm around her waist, his fingers playing with a sensitive spot. His voice was low. "Emily, I won't let you think about other men."

Emily looked at him. lifting his chin with her hand. "James, you used to be so sweet and clingy. Why are you so bossy now?"

James used to fake cry in front of her for some silly reasons,squeezing out a few tears to get his way. Now, he was all bossy and demanding.

James gazed at Emily's beautiful face, pretending to be obedient. "If I wasn't sweet before, how could I mnake you never want to leave me?"

James knew Emily responded better to kindness than toughness. Only by being sweet could heleave a mark on her heart.

Emily blinked, her eyes tracing James's sharp jawline, straight nose, and finally landing on his light brown eyes.

James was as noble and aloof as ever. If it weren't for his good looks,Emily wouldn't have spent so much money on him. Honestly,she hadn't lost out. James was great in bed.

Emily got in the mood. She slowly reached out, her fingers sliding across his face and down to his Adam's apple. When she reached lower, she suddenly touched his necklace.

She'd seen this necklace three years ago, and James never took it off except


when they were making love.

Emily took off the necklace from his neck. There was a plain ring on it.with some words engraved inside, but from her angle, she couldn't see clearly.


Emily twirled the plain ring around her finger and asked, "Did someone else give you this ring? What's the story behind it?"


It looked a bit rusty, and with James's means, he wouldn't wear a rusty ring unless it meant something.

James grabbed her wandering hand, his Adam's apple bobbing, cheeks turning a bit red, the blush spreading tohis ears.

He looked at her with a smirk and said, "Yeah, it was a gift. Does it bother you?"

Emily shook her head. "Just curious."

She remembered John's expression earlier and suddenly laughed.

James looked down at her. "What's got you so happy?"

In a good mood, Emily teased him, "It's all because of you, of course."


James pursed his lips, feeling a bit touched.

When they got to James's office, Emily put down the roses and realized she had forgotten her sketchpad.

She was about to call her assistant, but James held her hand. "Forget the design today. I'll give you two more days. Just stay with me today. Is that okay,Emily?"


James's warm breath tickled her ear, like sticky candy. The warmth of his body pressed against her thighs, impossible to ignore.

Emily turned around, staring at him. James's eyes were gentle and full of desire.


She wanted to refuse, but he didn't give her a chance.

Sunlight streamed through the French windows,filling the office.

James undressed her piece by piece. Her hands roamed his chest, slowly pushing him onto the sofa.

Just as things were heating up, there was a sudden knock on the door.Ryan's urgent voice came through. "Mr. James Smith, Mr. Marcus Smith is here."


James frowned, wanting to continue, but Marcus's voice was already outside.


James knew Marcus well. If he didn't respond or go out to see him,Marcus would definitely barge in.

Emily chuckled, her hands holding his already hard member,her lips curving into a smile. "Looks like we're out of time. Mr. Smith, what now?"

James stood up,lifting Emily, and without warning, entered her. Emily,caught off guard,let out a soft moan.

She quickly adapted to his size, but the position they were in was intense.With each step James took, Emily felt like electricity was coursing through her body.

Her breasts pressed against his chest, revealing a deep cleavage,

particularly enticing.

Emily blushed and kissed James, her face full of shyness. Once back in the dark room,James laid her on the bed, mking her nipple into his mouth.nibbling delicately and fiercely.

The stimulation was too much for Emily, causing her to moan seductively.

A minute later, James finally let her go. Emily stared at him. He had never been this anxious beforeprobably because his brother was outside.

He was more tense than usual. There was a sense of forbidden pleasure since James likely didn't want his family to know about her.

She urged him, "Be careful. My clothes are still outside."
###Chapter 49

James's eyes darkened a bit as he quickly threw on his clothes and headed into the office, carrying Emily's clothes with him.

Emily was still lying on the bed, with marks of his touch on her chest and breasts, which he reluctantly looked away from.

Marcus didn't walk in until James walked out of the hidden room after they both tidied up. He immediately noticed the frustrated look on James's face and couldn't help but smirk a little.

"James, are you..." Marcuis began to ask.

James shot him a cold glance, shutting him up instantly. In a low voice,Marcus said, "I'm starting school soon, and grandma told me to ask you for living expenses."

James handed him a card. Even though their family was loaded,they were always strict about the kids' spending to avoid any kind of competition at school.

After taking the card, Marcus notced a lady's handbag next to James's chair, and then his eyes landed on a bouquet of roses.

He looked at James and teased, "James, you're not planning to tell me the truth,are you?"

James replied coldly, "Get lost. If you say anything, I'll rip out your tongue.



Marcus quickly shut up, trying to think of the few women around James.Apart from Anais, there weren't many. He couldn't think of anyone else.

But whoever could make James care so much must be special.

Marcus wanted to ask indirectly, but after getting a warning look from James, he just took the bank card and left.


After leaving the office, he immediately went to ask Ryan, "Who's my brother's girlfriend? Tell me, and I won't spread it."

Ryan shook his head. "I have no idea."

Marcus didn't believe him. "I'm Marcus Smith. If you don't tell me, I'll have mybrother fire you."

"I really don't know."

Marcus got even more curious.

James went back to the dark room, where Emily had already tidied up and put on her clothes. She waved at James. "Stop, this is still the office, and people are coming and going. I don't want to trend on social media tomorrow."

James had no choice but to comply, but he still passionately kissed Emily for a few minutes.

These days, James went on another business trip abroad. When Emily finished work, Wilder approached her and said, "It's your mom's birthday today.She wants you to come home for dinner."

Emily remembered Calliope's birthday and hadI already prepared a gift.She handed the gift to Wilder, saying, "Dad, please take the gift to mnom for me. Wish her a happy birthday. I'll go back now..."

Wilder sighed. "Calliope just misses you. The gift and all that aren't
important. You really don't plan to go back?"

Seeing Wilder's almost pleading expression, Emily felt a twinge of guilt and nodded in agreement.
Calliope's birthday celebration at home was a small gathering, but Emily didin't expect to find John and Veda there when she arrived.
The atmosphere in the house was not very pleasant. Since Veda was still a member of the Johnson family, they had to endure her presence.
When Calliope saw Emily, she warmly approached her. This contrast made Veda feel uncomfortable. But she just sat on the sofa obediently,feeling abit awkward with her hands clasped together. It was unexpected for her that John brought her here today.
Seeing the dark circles under Emily's eyes, Calliope asked with concern,"Have you been working too hard lately? Do you need to rest first?"

James wasn't home these days, so she had nothing to do at night and would immerse herself in designing in the study. Sometimes she would stay up all night working on her designs.
As a result, her mental state was not good, so she nodded, a bit playfully. "Mom,I'll go rest upstairs. Call me when it's time for dinner."

Calliope nodded.

Emily curled up on the sofa,listening to the recording of James's meeting at work on her phone, and soon fell asleep. Before long, John camne up to call her for dinner.

The recording had stopped, and Emily lay quietly on the sofa.John entered the room quietly.
He looked down at Emily lying on the sofa, sleeping pecefully.She looked so different from when he last saw her, no longer cold and intimidating

Her stunningly beautiful face made John's heaurt skip a beat, just like when he first met Emily and found her innocent.

John slowly squatted down beside her. Emily was still asleep, allowing the inexplicable feelings in his heart to grow wildly.

When Emily woke up, he really didn't dare to look at her so recklessly.

John didn't know when he had started feeling somewhat inferior in front of Emily. Her brilliance won his heart, but it also sparked a jealousy that was eating him up inside.

John was afraid he couldn't dominate Emily and that she might choose someone better.

As his lips slowly approached, his heart pounded. He wanted Emily.For the first time, he regretted not marrying her three years ago!

Just as he was about to kiss Emily, Veda's voice suddenly came from outside. "John, why haven't you two come down yet?"

Consumed by jealousy, Veda pushed the door open, her hands clenched tightly.

John instantly moved away from Emily's face, his back tense and frustrated at being interrupted.

Emily was also awakened by their commotion. As she opened her eyes,she saw John crouching in front of her. And Veda standing at the door.

When John came in, he had forgot to close the door properly. so Veda had been watching from outside for quite some time.

She watched as John involuntarily moved closer to Emily, and in the end.he even tried to kiss her. This was a heavy blow to Veda.

With a slight smile. Veda said, "Did I interrupt your intimacy?"

Veda tried her best to gain even a little bit of love from John,while Emily seemed to effortlessly win. Even though she had known John longer than Emily!


A hint of guilt flashed in John's eyes.

Emily frowned. Seeing how close John was to her,she understood a lot.Thinking of Veda's resentful eyes and John's flushed face,she raised an eyebrow.


With a hint of coldness in her tone, Emily asked, "John, were you just about to kiss me?"

John stood up instantly, unable to meet her eyes, feeling embarrassed. It was ridiculous how he had almost kissed Emily without control.
###Chapter 50

John didn't bother explaining. He just turned around, not even glancing at Veda,and headed downstairs.

Veda clenched her fists, her face darkening as if she was sinking into an endless pit. She slowly turned her gaze to Emily.

Emily was lounging on the sofa, lazily yawning. Every move she made screamed elegance.

It was like she was born to be noble. Even after a decade in the countryside,she stiIl commanded respect.

Veda asked, "Emily, have you patched things up with John?"

Emily gave her a quick look. "You should ask John that."

Emily started down the stairs, and Veda trailed after her, saying, "Emily,about the birthday..."

"Veda,you're so fake. Talking to you is exhausting, and I don't want to hear it anymore." Emily paused, shot her a glance, then continued downstairs.


Veda frowned,looking a bit hurt.

Emily went straight downstairs, where Calliope greeted her and asked her to sit beside her. Emily didn't even glance at John.

John's lips were tight, his expression cold. He couldn't believe he felt desire for Emily.

It was like Pandora's box had been opened; just looking at Emily made



him want her!

In a daze, he remembered the only time he had made love with Veda-when he was drunk after finding out that Emily had lost her virginity to someone else and mistook Veda for her.

Even so, he still felt like he had betrayed Emily. A deep sense of guilt,mixed with a bit of male pride, weighed heavily on his chest and forced him to stay away from Emily.

He slowly raised his head, his gaze falling lightly on Emily. At that moment. Emily was talking to Calliope with a gentle expression.

John felt his heart racing uncontrollably. Every smile and frown of Emily's seemed like a seduction to him.

When Veda returned, the atmosphere at the dinner table changed. Except for John, everyone only spoke to Emily.

Although it was Calliope's birthday, Emily strangely received a bunch of expensive gifts.

Emily looked at the deeds in front of her, her mouth twitching, and quickly declined. "Mom, I really can't accept this. You have already given me so many properties, and I can'tlive in all of them."

Calliope insisted, "It's just a house;it's not worth much. If you don't want it, does it mean you don't want to acknowledge me as your mother?"

Emily hesitated for a moment and finally agreed. After all, it was a gesture from the elders.

Veda watched from the side,her lips tight as jealousy surged in her heart.
Emily had promised James not to stay at the Williams Mansion tonight.After dinner, she had a conversation with Calliope and was then called to the study by Wilder to discuss the future of Diamond Glow.

The discussion went on late, and James messaged her asking when she would be back.

Emily looked down and smiled as she replied to James:[Miss me?]

James replied: [Yes. I can't wait for you to come back.]

Then. Emily saw a photo he sent. He seemed to have just taken a shower,with water droplets still on his chest.

His muscles had just the right lines and were very aesthetically pleasing.

Wilder looked at her and said, "Emmy, what are you looking at? Your face is all red."

Emily's face turned even redder. She cleared her throat and quickly put her phone away. "Nothing, Dad. So, where were we? The collaboration with the Golden Birch Group, right? I'll handle it. I'm totally confident in the design proposal."

Wilder smiled warmly. "I've always believed in you. By th resigned. I heard she applied to the Golden Birch Group and

Emily's eyes flickered slightly as she nodded. "Yeah, but it do matter.Veda's words don't carry much weight at Golden Birch."

As it got later, Emily made some vague excuses and left.

Just as she was driving away from the Williams Mansion, Veda suddenly appeared like a ghost at an intersection, startling Emily who almost hit her


by slamming on the brakes.

Emily got out of the car her face cold, and looked at Veda with ley eyes."It you want to die,don't involve me!"

She took a deep breath, rolled her eyes, and turned to get back in the car.but Veda blocked her way.


With red eyes. Veda stared at her. "Why are you trying to seduce John?"

It was rare for Veda to show such a strong side in front of Emily. Emily could see a hint of jealousy and resentment in her expression.

John had indeed been acting strange lately. He should have been wholeheartedly in love with Veda.

After all, when he found out that Veda was the one slandering her, John only helped to apologize for Veda and didn't take any substantial action against her. But John just attempted to kiss her while she was asleep.

With her arms crossed and a cold gaze, leaning against the car, her long legs restless, Emily smiled lightly. "I was just sleeping at home earlier.How could I be seducing him? Since Johnis your man, you should be the one managing him. Don't come to provoke me."

Veda's eyes were cold. "John doesn't love you anymore. What happened just now was just because he was possessed. Don't delude yourself into thinking he still cares about you. You two can never reconcile!"

Emily sneered. Since she returned, Veda had always been in control in front of her, because Veda had absolute confidence. Aiden and Mia doted on her. John put her first, and she enjoyed everyone's favor. It was rare to see Veda in such a state of loss of control.

Emily leaned comfortably against the car.

"Back then, John gave up everything for you. You were his true love in the eyes of others. Some even said that Johin is a man of deep, unwavering affection. But now, it seems that John is not that into you after all. He is just an ordinary man with the flaw of getting tired of the old and seeking the new."


Emily glanced at Veda, exuding charm in her eyes and smile.

"Veda,you have everything. You're even willing to be with him without any formal title. Why are you so fixated on John? Or are you just trying to take something away from me? Do I cast such a shadow over your heart?"

Veda's expression changed unpredictably at Emily's words. She had never known that Emily could speak like this. She couldn't outwit Emily, but her emotions were stretched to the breaking point, reaching a critical point.

"I am anonymous because of you. John doesn't love you. So why do you have to hang around him? As long as you two divorce, he will definitely marry me."

Emily narrowed her eyes, her gaze changing significantly
###Chapter 51

Emily thought to herself, 'Man, Veda is fuming. Has she really been clueless all these years that John never actually married her?

Back in the day, John might've kept it under wraps to save face for the Williams family, but now it was clear as day that she and John were on the outs.

Emily wondered, 'Why's Veda saying all this? Even if John kept quiet,didn't Aiden spill the beans?

A cold glint flashed in Emily's eyes, but it was too dark for Veda to catch it. Emily figured John didn't care for Veda that much. Suddenly, she felt a wave of relief.


It seemed like there was already trouble in paradise, and Emily was more than happy to stir the pot.

With a sly smile, Emily said calmly, "Divorce is always an option. If you've got the guts, get John to sign the papers. If he signs, I'll sign too."

As she finished, Emily straightened up, casually flicked her long hair,and said softly, "Veda, it's all on you."

By then, Veda would realize that the title of Mrs. Williams,which she had been dreamning of and working so hard for, was always within reach. It was just that John wouldn'tgive it to her! Emily could already picture Veda's complete meltdown. By then, the rift between Veda and John would be undeniable. Just thinking about it made Emily chuckle. She was looking forward to Veda's downfall. She was in a great mood now, but to Veda, her expression was infuriating,making her shake with anger.

Emily got into her car, drove past Veda, and headed back to Crystal Valley Manor.

The lights were on at Crystal Valley Manor. James was still up,and when Emily walked in, he was in the living room.

James gave her a slight smile. Emily looked at him, puzzled.

She asked, "Do you really have to do this?"

Emily slowly raised her eyes and looked at the fur-lined handcuffs on her wrists and ankles.

Honestly, with a bit of effort, she could break free. But since James was into it, Emily didn't resist.

James leaned in and kissed her, his tongue exploring, biting her tongue,deepening the kiss fiercely.

"Didn't you buy this golden cage back then because you wanted to play like this?" James asked, his clear eyes gradually showing an intense affection. He nibbled at her neck, kissing down to her chest.

Emily hummed lightly, "I want to play you,not the other way around For the first time, Emily regretted buying that golden cage on a whim, and James hadn't forgotten it. James mumbled, "It's all the same."Emily rolled her eyes. James admired her. He whispered in her ear, "You're beautiful."

Emily thought to herself that a man's words in bed couldn't be trusted at all.


James thrust his hips, his thick and long penis pressing against her vagina,but he didn't rush to penetrate. Instead, he gently rubbed the head of his penis against her already wet entrance.

Meanwhile, his hands gently caressed her breasts, making her beautiful face flush with desire.

Emily let out a soft moan, unable to resist arching her back slightly,gently rubbing her vaginal entrance against the head of his penis.

Emily knew what he wanted to hear, and softly moaned, "James, come in."

Her cheeks were flushed. Whenever she was with James,she could always let go of all her inhibitions, unable to resist the growing desire.

James smirked and grabbed her slender waist. With a swift motion,his purplish-red penis aimed at her entrance and thrust in fiercely.

The sensation of being completely filled made Emily blush even more,and she let out a soft moan.

She had never been tied up before. In the past, she could even take the lead in their intimate moments, but now she couldn't. As soon as his penis entered, it was tightly gripped. James,his eyes reddened by her tightness, thrust fiercely, releasing all the pent-up desire of the past few days. The fluid flowing from her pussy made it easier for James to thrust wildly. James said, "I don't like you going to see John, not even with his family around."

Turns out, James was jealous.

Her breasts were constantly being shaken by him. He took one in his mouth, and his hand grabbed the other, his fingers sinking harshly into the flesh.


And James's overly large penis would slam fully into her pussy every time,making a sound of flesh hitting flesh.

James thrust fast and hard, reaching out to touch the place where they joined,pressing on her clitoris, which was already erect.

Emily couldn't withstand such teasing, involuntarily tensed her delicate body,subconsciously tightening, and James breathed heavily, thrusting more forcefully. Emily moaned continuously.

That night,James never stopped for a moment.

When she fell asleep in a daze, James had just finished cleaning her up,and she only heard James say in her ear, "I'm going on a business trip.Wait for me to come back."

The next morning, she woke up to an empty bed. Only the handcuffs remained, and Emily noticed they were pink. She remembered the madness of last night and blushed. She slapped her face, and immediately contacted someone to sell this golden cage. After all, this cage was her own doing. If she had known James was part of the Smith family earlier, she definitely wouldn't have been so reckless. Emily had breakfast and went to work, only to find out that James had gone on a business trip. With James not at home, it was cold and quiet every day when she returned.

Later,Emily went to the Golden Birch Group to deliver the design drafts,and Ryan was in the secretary's office. When he saw her, he immediately invited her to the CEO's office.


Ryan had always been respectful to Emily and said, "Ms. Johnson, are you missing Mr. Smith? He should be back in a couple of days."

Emily's mouth twitched. "I'm not missing him. I just came to deliver the design drafts. Don't talk nonsense."

Ryan just smiled, which made Emily feel a bit embarrassed. Emily handed the design drafts to Ryan and immediately left the office.

Just as she arrived in the lobby of the Golden Birch Group, she saw Veda and Mia unexpectedly.

Veda was talking to Mia, making Mia very happy.

Emily didn't want to greet them, since Mia had never liked her. But now Mia had seen her.

She walked over with a stiff scalp and whispered,"Mom."

Mia frowned and asked coldly, "What are you doing here? Are you here to cause trouble for Veda again? Why can't you be more sensible?" Emily slowly raised her eyelids, and for a moment, her heart felt disheartened.
###Chapter 52


Even though Emily had been insulted and slandered for over a decade,she still wasn't used to it.

Mia was her biological mother, but her heart always leaned towards Veda.

Emily chuckled bitterly and said, "I came here on behalf of the Williams Group to deliver documents to the Golden Birch Group. Why can't I come?Do you think I'm here to make Veda unhappy? Why don't you think it's Veda causing trouble for me?"

Emily looked steadily at Mia. When Mia usually scolded her,she would just purse her lips, say nothing, and watch her have a meltdown by herself.

Now,Emily accused Mia of favoritism and unfairness in a very calm tone.

Mia's face turned cold, with no emotions in her eyes, and she just said,"Because you've always targeted Veda before. If you had just behaved,would I treat you like that?"
Emily laughed angrily. She didn't want to argue with Mia at the company's entrance, since it was embarrassing.
She took a step back, lowered her voice, and said, "I have to go back to work,so I'll leave first. You guys continue."
As Emily was about to leave, Mia stopped her. "Veda's birthday's approacMia was given no room to negotiate. Emily paused, turned around, and looked at Mia with red eyes. hing. You should come to the banquet." Mia's heart twitched a bit. She couldn't even meet the innocent and loving gaze. The guilt of over twenty years towards Emily surged up in Mia's heart.

Mia inexplicably slowed down her voice and said, "It's also your birthday that day. I haven't celebrated your birthday in so many years. It's my..."

Mia's words of submission were hard to come by, her voice turned cold,with a tough facade. "You have to come. I don't want the internet to start trending about the Johnson family owing their biological daughter."

Mia had always been Emily's soft spot. Emily's gaze flickered, and she could only agree.

Veda smiled slightly. "Mom, Emily agreed to come to the birthday party."

Emily glanced at Veda faintly. But this glance made Veda feel a bit uneasy.

Emily returned to the Williams Group, slumping on the sofa in the office and reminiscing about every birthday in the past.
Every birthday was actually for Veda. Since she couldn't take the spotlight,she didn't even have the qualification to be a supporting role.

But now Mia was trying her best to get her to attend the birthday party. It was very abnormal. But Emily still wanted to give Mia a chance.
After three days, James came back in the afternoon, and Emily saw him outside the company when she got off work. Ryan was driving, and the passenger seat was empty. Emily hesitated for a moment, thinking that Ryan knew about their relationship, so she sat directly in the back. As soon as Emily got in, she fell into James's arms.

Emily was a bit confused and asked, "Didn't you say you would be back in a week?"


Ryan, who never revealed work details to others, couldn't help but speak,"
Ms. Johnson, this time Mr. Smith really exhausted us. He's burning us out,expecting triple the work from a single person. It's been days since we've had a decent break."


Emily then asked Ryan, "Are you too tired to drive? Want me to take over?11


Ryan looked at Emily,speechless.

Emily asked, "Why the rush?"

Ryan sighed,"Because Mr. Smith wants to spend your birthday with you."

James coldly said,"Button your lip."

Ryan pressed his lips tightly, thinking being an assistant these days was really hard.

Emily was surprised. Her birthday was in three days.

James suddenly took out a gift bag. "This is your birthday present."

Emily curiously took it and opened it in front of him. Inside was a large uncut gemstone. Emily's eyes widened. This was the most complete Oppenheimer Blue in the world. After the shock, Emily looked at James with a complex gaze. Most importantly, this gemstone had been discovered by her, and she had handed it over to her teacher.


Ryan continued to be a doormat in front.

He said, "Mr. Smith knew you were a jewelry designer, thinking that you might not like the work of other designers, so he bought a raw stone directly."


He continued, "This gemstone was sold at the world's top auction house,and Mr. Smith took a lot of effort to get it."

"Shut up." James spoke again.

Ryan closed his mouth.

James looked down at Emily and asked softly, "Do you like it?"

After being abandoned by John, Emily had been obsessed with James for a while, and she had also been obsessed with gemstone gambling.

This Oppenheimer Blue was the gemstone she had selected and gamble on at a gemstone gambling event.

But holding such a large gemstone alone was likely toattract envy,so Emily gave the gemstone to her teacher. She let her teacher help sell it, or cut it into diamonds. Emily didn't expect it to be so coincidental. This morning, she saw 100 million dollars deposited into her bank account. She called her teacher and learned that the gemstone had been sold.

The buyers at the auction house were kept confidential. Emily closed the box and handed it back to James. "This gift is too precious, so I can't accept it." James looked deeply at her and said, "Can it be as precious as my heart?Or do you think this unprocessed gemstone is too ugly?"

Emily had thought about designing a few beautiful pieces to wear herself,but she never had the inspiration. Now seeing this gemstone again,Emily actually felt very close to it.

"Oppenheimer Blue, it also symbolizes loyal love."

Hearing this from James made Emily's heart tremble.

She vaguely understood why she couldn't design anything for this gemstone. After John left, she had no expectations for love.

She didn't have the noble, truthful and loyal love.

But Emily was deeply attracted to its dreamy colors.She slowly raised her head, with a glint in her eyes, and said softly, "It's too precious. You should take it back."

Emily never thought she would receive 100 million dollars at once in her life.


And if James found out in the future that she had this gemstone revealed,he would kill her.

James frowned. "Since you don't like it, then I'll throw it away."
###Chapter 53

Even though she knew it was probably a bluff, Emily instinctively stopped him.


She leaned in close to James, grabbing his hand. "I'll keep it. James, you're really over the top."

Emily bit her lip, feeling a mix of emotions. A gift worth 100 million dollars? She'd have to repay it someday. The thought was already giving her a headache.


At Crystal Valley Manor, Emily stashed away the gems, and James hugged her from behind, his voice rough as he asked,"Did you miss me?"

James clung to Emily, kissing her softly on the ear, whispering her name like he was trying to enchant her. Emily couldn't resist his touch and turned to kiss him back. Their lips locked.

James started to undress her business suit with a hint of seduction.Her shirt was halfway unbuttoned, the buttons caught between her breasts.He squeezed her breasts, making the shirt barely cover her nipples.

Her slim figure, highlighted by her delicate waist and the A-line skirt's flattering cut, added up with the half-revealing private parts, was extremely tempting.

James stood behind her, his strong hands slipping into the wide neckline,kneading her full breasts. Emily's eyes were misty, a blush spreading across her beautiful face and nose. Emily slowly climbed onto him, feeling unusually good. James' intense gaze stayed on Emily. He brushed her hair off her back,kissing her fragrant shoulders, his cool lips kissing lightly and slowly, as if expressing his longing from the past few days.

But Emily felt a burning sensation wherever he kissed her, her skin heating up.


James put his hand between her legs, the area that was already wet with passion. He rubbed her labia a few times before sliding in two fingers.

James'fingers were a bit rough. Emily frowned, her watery eyes staring at him. James pulled his hand back, his already hard penis thrusting in.

Her body flushed with excitement. Unable to bear the stimulation, Emily let out a soft moan.


Then, she whispered in James' ear, "I've missed you too."

That night was destined to be wild.

The next morning, Emily was late for work.

At noon, Emily got a call from Mia. She said, "Take the afternoon off,and I'll take you out to buy a dress."

Emily's eyes lit up with joy, and she quickly agreed. "Okay,"

Mia and Emily met at the mall, where all the stores were high-end luxury brands.

Even though Veda wasn't there this time, she seemed to be everywhere.Every time they entered a store, Mia would tell the salesperson when she saw a nice dress, "Wrap this up and send it to Veda."

Emily clenched her hands, following Mia as they went to several stores. Then a salesperson asked, "Are you two sisters? You look so alike."

Emily smiled. "She's my mom."

The salesperson smiled. "Ma'am, you look so young. Here are the latest dresses from our brand, and you can pick one."

Mia noticed Emily and asked, "What color do you like?"

Emily wasn't really in the mood for dress shopping, but she didn't want to kill Mia's vibe, so she randomly picked out two outfits.

She tried on a bright red dress with a large cut-out back. Mia's eyes deepened when she noticed the marks on Emily's back.

She never realized Emily had such a great figure. Even with minimal makeup, Emily was stunning.

The dress itself wasn't anything special, but on Emily, it looked amazing.

The salesperson's eyes lit up. "Ma'am, your daughter is gorgeous.She makes the dress look even better."


Mía nodded, her eyes flickering, not showing too much happiness.

Mia said, "Don't wear clothes that are too flashy."

Emily glanced at her, keeping her thoughts to herself. She changed into a black dress, which made her look like a dazzling black rose.


The salesperson, clearly enjoying how beautiful Emily looked, clapped his hands. "You're stunning. Miss, do you want both outfits wrapped up?"

Emily looked at Mia, who seemed lost in thought and didn't say anything.
 

Emily said directly, "No, thank you."

After leaving the store, Emily asked Mia, "Mom, are you afraid I'll outshine Veda?"

Mia's face looked a bit unpleasant, having her thoughts seen through.

She gave Emily a glare without anyone noticing, finally saying, "No. By the way, have you gotten back together with John?"

"What do you think, Mom?"

"If you wanted to break up with him, then just get a divorce."

Emily's heart ached. "So you came here today to be Veda's advocate?"

Mia frowned, displeased. "As your mom, I'm just hoping you'll seriously consider your future."


Emily gave a bitter smile. "My future was ruined three years ago when John was called away by Veda. Why didn't you come to ask me back then?"


Mia didn't like being questioned by Emily. Her brow furrowed. "Emily,Veda is your sister. You shouldn't hold a grudge against her."

Emily closed her eyes, smiling bitterly."I think we don't need to continue shopping. Mom, let me take you back."

Mia didn't say anything, following Emily to the underground parking lot.Before they could get in the car, Isolde ran over.

"Emmy, it's Mom. Emmy, give me some money, and I won't tell anyone about that thing."
 

Isolde's sudden appearancestartled Emily. She instinctively stood in front of Mia, preventing Isolde from bumping into her.

Mia held Emily's hand and whispered, "Ignore her. Let's go back first."

Mia had brought bodyguards with her, and they quickly took Isolde away.

As Emily followed Mia into the car, Mia suddenly asked, "Emily, were you really violated by Lucas?"

Emily never expected to hear this question from Mia.

She teared up instantly,staring at Mia.

Mia couldn't meet her gaze.
###Chapter 54

Mia looked away, but Emily hopped out of the car and slammed the door shut.


She turned and practically sprinted away, her mind racing with doubts about why Mia had invited her out today.

Was it just a shopping trip? Or was it a setup to make her see Isolde?

Emily's head started to pound. When she got back to the office, her assistant noticed her mood and kept quiet.

Emily broke the silence, "What's up?"

"Mr. John Williams is back at work today."

Emily wasn't shocked. The Williamns Group was always going to end up in John's hands.

The assistant, looking worried, asked, "Ms. Johnson, Veda doesn't get along with you. Do you think Mr. Williams might come after you?"

Emily couldn't help but chuckle. She didn't expect her assistant to be so concerned.

"No, don't stress. John isn't that dumb."

The assistant scratched his head, thinking, 'Emily, I know you're smart,but you can't just call Mr. Williams dumb, right?'

The next day,Emily got a package from Veda. Inside was a fancy dress with no brand label, but the fabric felt luxurious.

There was a card saying Mia had picked it out for her to wear at the

birthday party. Emily sighed.

Golden Birch Group

Ryan placed the most important documents on James's right side and whispered1. "Mr. Smith, these are the latest contracts with overseas factories.And this one is a proposal from the Johnson Group. Want to take a look?"

When Ryan mentioned the Johnson Group, James's face turned icy. Ryan felt the atmosphere became tense.


He hesitated, wondering if he should take the proposal away, but James opened it.


He skimmed it and then smirked coldly. "The Johnson Group is really pushing it!"

Ryan couldn't read his thoughts. Since Emily was from the Johnson family,why was he so hostile?

Just then, a series of knocks on the door, broke the tense silence. Besides Ryan and Emily, no one else could just walk in. Even senior execs had to meet James in the conference room. For other official matters, Ryan would deliver the documents needing his signature.

James frowned slightly. Seeing his mood, Ryan walked out. When he saw Veda,his frown deepened.

He remembered Veda didn't get along with Emily. But why was Veda here?

Ryan's eyes fell on her work badge, and his frown deepened even more.Who was the idiot that hired her?

Seeing Ryan open the door, Veda felt a pang of disappointment. She pursed her lips anad said softly, "Ryan, I'm not here to see you. I'm here to see Mr.Smith."

Veda thought, 'If I can secure my spot at Golden Birch Group, Ryan's the first one I'll get rid of.

For days, every time she tried to see James, Ryan blocked her. She couldn't figure out how an assstant like Ryan had so much power.

Ryan held back his temper and said coldly, "Mr. Smith won't see you.Please leave."

Veda bit her lip and walked past Ryan, spotting James sitting elegantly in his chair.

James had this cold, noble vibe that no one could match.

Veda bit her lip again, knowing she wasn't in James's league. But if he backed her, no one in the Johnson or Williams families would dare look down on her.

She handed him her design sketches. "Mr. Smith, these are my latest designs. I hope you'll take a look."

James glanced at her designs with indifference.

Veda's heart raced. She was a bit scared of James. At the Royal Venue jewelry exhibition, he had publicly accused her of plagiarism.

Now,she nervously watched as James opened her sketches.

Her eyes flickered as she handed him an invitation. "Mr. Smith, the day after tomorrow is my birthday. I'd like to invite you to my birthday dinner.




Worried he might refuse, she added, "Mrs. Amelia Martinez invited us to her birthday banquet before, so this is a return invitation."

James took the invitation, opened it, and saw only Veda's name inside.The chill in the room intensified.

Veda was nervous, unable to meet James's eyes directly. She asked softly,"Mr.Smith,will you come?"

James sneered. "Since you have invited me, I will go."

Veda instantly smiled, completely missing the cold intent in James's eyes.

After Veda left, James said coldly, "Find out who brought her in and fire them."


Ryan was stunned for a moment and asked, "Mr. Smith, are both of them being fired?"

"Veda stays."

Ryan nodded, noticing the menacing glint in James's eyes.

Looking at the invitation, James finally understood why Emnily had been so unenthusiastic lately.

That evening, James returned to Crystal Valley Manor early and prepared a spread of delicious food all over the table. He asked Emily, "How do you want to spend your birthday? Want to go out together?"

Emily shook her head. "I can't. My parents have planned a birthday banquet, and they have invited me to attend."

Emily clearly didn't see herself as the main event.

James's eyes flickered slightly. "You can't spend it with me?"

Emily took a bite of fish, reached out to pinch James's cheek, and said with a smile, "You make it sound like it's your birthday."

James held her hand, kissed it lightly, and said, "It's the same."

Emily sighed. "But I can't say no to my mom."

A hint of disappointment flashed in James's eyes.

Feeling a bit guilty, Emily reached out to tousle James's hair, messing it up,and chuckled softly. "Then wait for me to come back, and we'll have cake together."


James nodded.

That night, they embraced and slept. James wanted to do something more,but Emily refused and said softly,"If you try anything, you'll be sleeping on the second floor."

James obediently held her, kissed her lips, and embraced her.
###Chapter 55

On the day of the birthday bash. Emily slipped into the dress Veda had sent her and headed to Celestial Cuisine.

This place was perched in the tallest building in all of Emerald City. From up there, you could see the grand Emerald River winding through the city.

The top floor, the 100th, was reserved for big shots and major events.

Veda's birthday party was on the 90th floor, which was still pretty high up and super fancy. Renting out that space must've cost a fortune.

Today was Veda's 23rd birthday. Even though Mia said Veda wanted to celebrate with Emily, it was clear she had her favorites.

The Johnson family went all out this time, mostly because Veda's reputation had taken a hit online. They were trying to save face. For Emily,the real heiress, this party was just dripping with irony.

Years ago, Isolde had swapped the two kids out of jealousy for the Johnson family's power. Isolde used to be a servant for the Johnsons,taking care of the baby.

No one noticed the switch at first since the kids were born around the same time. They didn't look alike; but Mia and Aiden were swamped with work and completely handed over their child to Isolde,so they couldn't recognize their kid. Little did they know, Isolde had her own plans.

There was some old drama between Isolde and Aiden. They were each other's first love and dated for years. But Aiden married Mia for her family's wealth and power. Isolde wanted to live on her own, but her family pushed her to marry Lucas.

Lucas and Aiden were half-brothers, a fact Mia was clueless about.

Mia didn't really care, or maybe she just couldn't afford to. After the Johnsons took over her family, she lost all her support. If she divorced Aiden, she'd be left with nothing. So, she had to turn a blind eye to some things.

Eventually, Isolde found her way back to the Johnson Mansion, starting as a maid and slowly getting close to Aiden right under Mia's nose.

There was never a clear answer on whether Veda was really Aiden's kid.

Since Emily came back to the Johnson Mansion, she and Veda had never been seen together at a birthday party. So, even though everyone knew Veda wasn't the real heiress, as long as Aiden acknowledged her,they couldn't deny it.

Today was kind of their first joint appearance. Everyone was curious to see if Mia and Aiden would favor their biological daughter or the foster daughter they'd raised for over twenty years.

In the afternoon, Mía called Emily to the hotel to help out. When Emily got there, she realized Mia's idea of help was having her pick out jewelry and dresses for Veda, just because Veda thought Emily had better taste.

Emily didn't mind Veda's little games. She just lounged on the sofa in the dressing room,watching Veda show off designer dresses in front of her.

Veda knew her little tricks wouldn't really get to Emily and said, "Mom said all these clothes are gorgeous, so she bought them all for me.I kept saying no, but she insisted. I even picked one for you, the one you're wearing now. Emily, Mom actually cares about you, she just doesn't show it."


Emily could brush off the material stuff, but Veda flaunting Mia's affection did get under her skin a bit. Still, she felt like she didn't care that much.

Emily calmly replied, "It's fine. John's mom has given me everything she could."


For the first time, Emily felt a bit childish.

She added, "John's momn is my mom. She's better than Mia."

Just then, Mia walked in and overheard her. Her gaze lingered on Emily.

Emily slowly looked up from her phone, realizing she had accidentally sent a string of [damn] to James. It was too late to take it back.

James quickly replied:[You in trouble?]

Emily: [Just some annoying flies.]

James:[Then swat them.]

His bluntness made her smile. Mia glanced at Emily, frowned slightly at her outfit, but didn't say anything.

Emily's demeanor made even a plain dress look good.

Mia went over to Veda, tidied her hair, and said, "Get ready quickly."

Veda nodded.

The Johnson family clearly put a lot into this party, or rather, intoVeda.
They even hired a celebrity makeup artist and bought her expensive
jewelry.

Veda had been dancing since she was a kid, keeping a slim figure. She


wanted to look both innocent and sexy. Her clothes were a bit revealing,but her makeup was light.

Mia praised, "My daughter is so beautiful."

Emily's eyes flickered as she watched Mia let Veda hold her arm and said,"Most of the guests are here. Let's go down so they don't wait too long."

Mia, with Veda, didn't look at Emily once. Emily followed behind,feeling a bit lost.


Outside the lounge, there was a huge spiral staircase leading to the banquet hall.

At the staircase, Calliope in a long dress was standing there, waving at Emily.

Emily's eyes lit up. She ran over and affectionately called out, "Mom, why are you here?"

"It's your birthday. Of course I had to come."

Calliope took out a hairpin and clipped it on Emily's head.

Emily wanted to take it off, but then she heard Calliope loudly say, "This is a treasure of our Williams family, very precious. Emmy, I'm giving it to you,wishing you always happy."

Calliope raised her voice on purpose so that someone would catch her.

Emily caught a glimpse of Mia and Veda, both looking a bit grim.

Mia patted Veda's hand and whispered, "It's okay; let's go downstairs first."

The lights suddenly dimmed. As Veda walked towards the stairs, the lights brightened with each step she took.

Emily followed behind Veda.

Emily's gaze was calm, but her stunning appearance immediately overshadowed Veda as soon as she appeared.
###Chapter 56

Emily rocked a black strapless dress with a simple shawl, her long hair pinned up with a hairpin from Calliope.

Even with such a simple outfit, Emily looked super elegant and classy, not over-the-top but just right,giving off a unique vibe of luxury.

That plain dress surprisingly made Emily the star of the room.

Veda, on the other hand, was decked out in a gown covered in thousands of diamonds, each one sparkling like crazy. When the liht hit her,all you could see was her blinged-out dress.

"Wow,the Johnsons really went all out for their adopted daughter. She must've cost a fortune from head to toe."

"They don't seem to care much about their real daughter. Good thing she's naturally pretty, or she'd be a laughingstock today."

"Even though the Johnson's real daughter has been living in the countryside for years, she still has that natural elegance. No need for fancy clothes."

As Veda made her way down the stairs, she could hear the compliments getting louder. When she realized everyone was praising Emily,her face went pale.

Sure, Emily was naturally beautiful, but Veda couldn't stand her flaunting it.

Some folks even whispered that Veda was lacking in grace and nobility.

She thought. T've been planning this birthday party forever. Are these


people blind? What's so great about Emily in that black dress?

Deep down, Veda knew Emily looked stunning without any extras.

Suddenly. Veda regretted sharing her birthday with Emily. It felt like a slap in the face. She took a deep breath and quickly pulled herself together.She thought, 'Enjoy your last moment, Emily. Tonight, I'll make sure you fall.


Once she reached the bottom, Veda stopped a staff member and asked, "Is Mr.Smith here yet?"

The staff member shook his head. Veda felt a bit let down and looked down. She really wanted James to show up.

In Emerald City, no one's birthday party could get James to attend. If she could get him to come, she'd definitelymake a splash in high society.

After they left the stage, Mia and Calliope camedown too.

Calliope had never been to the Johnson family's birthday parties before because Veda was always the star.

Calliope would usually throw a small party at home forEmily's birthday.

The young ladies at the event gathered around Veda, whispering,"Didn't you say Mr. Smith was coming tonight? Where is he?"

They were mainly there to see James.

Veda licked her lips and said softly, "Mr. Smith got my invite, and he'll definitely come. Don't worry. He's a busy guy, probably just running late."

Everyone relaxed, thinking Veda wouldn't lie about something like that.
No one dared to mess with James's name.


Everyone crowded around Veda, and soon Emily was pushed out of the spotlight.

Meanwhile,Mia and Aiden were mingling with guests, while Emily and Calliope enjoyed some quiet time.


Calliope gave Emily's hand a comforting pat and whispered, "I should've booked a bigger, fancier hall for you. How can your parents be so unfair?"

Calliope had been by Emily's side forever, loving her since she was a kid.

Emily gently reassured her, "Mom, it's fine."

With Calliope around, Emily already felt warm and loved. Calliope started handing her more gifts.

"Mom, you just gave me some gifts recently..."

Being the emotional and empathetic person she was, Calliope softly said,"Our Emmy deserves the best. I hate to compare, but I can't stand Veda!These are from your dad and grandpa. This headpiece is from your sister;she was worried you wouldn't like it."

John's younger sister had been learning to weave,and this was her first piece.

Emily beamed, "If it's from her, I love it."

But she couldn't fit everything on her head.

Watching Calliope pull out all these goodies from her bag, Emily couldn't help but smile.

It was like Calliope's love easily wiped away the sting of being ignored by Mia.
	


Finally, Emily and Calliope sat in the rest area. With Calliope by her side,no one dared to bother Emily for a while. But soon, Calliope got called away by a phone call.


Veda, surrounded by people, kept glancing at Emily. They quickly noticed that once Calliope left, a bunch of young, handsome guys started asking Emily to dance.

Emily turned them all down, but more kept coming.

Veda,not impressed by these guys, muttered to herself, "Such a flirt."

Veda hatched a plan. She called out, "Emily."

Emily looked over, curious about what Veda was up to. If Veda wanted to play games, Emily was ready.

As she got closer, she heard Veda and the other girls making fun of her.

"That dress looks so outdated, like it's from years ago."

Veda raised an eyebrow, looking at Emily with a smug expression,and said, "Don't say that. Emily hasn't seen much. It's herfirst time at a party like this, so it's normal not to know what to wear."

"Yeah, she's been back for years, but we've never seen her at any party.Is she a fake heiress or something?"

"She must be a pain at home. Her parents don't seem to care about her.How many people even know the Johnsons have two daughters?"

"Everyone knows Veda, and she's amazing. She's already a designer at Golden Birch Group and will definitely shine internationally."

They praised Veda and put down Emily, their eyes full of disdain.


Veda handed Emily a glass of wine. "Emily, don't mind them."

Veda felt confident because Mia and Aiden were there,and she thought Emily wouldn't dare to cause a scene.
###Chapter 57

Emily watched as Veda held the wine glass, her hand slowly reaching out.

Then, without a second thought, she grabbed the glass and poured the wine right over Veda's head, in front of everyone.

The cold wine trickled down Veda's cheeks, soaking into her dress, making her shiver.


Veda was stunned. The ladies who had been cheering moments ago were now wide-eyed and silent.


Emily calmly placed the empty glass back on the tray,her expression icy as she stared at Veda. "I warned you, don't mess with me. I have a short fuse and I won't put up with your crap."

Veda was a mess, her face pale with rage. She never thought Emily would actually go through with it.

Emily didn't care anymore. She used to hold back at the Johnson Mansion to avoid upsetting her parents. But now, she wasn't going to suppress herself to please anyone. She wasn't going to let Veda walk all over her.

Emily casually flicked her long hair.

Veda was fuming, her head felt like it was about to explode.

"Emily! Do you even know what you've done?!"

Veda gritted her teeth, almost grinding them to dust. She never expected Emily to humiliate her in front of so many people.

Emily's voice was ice-cold. "I offered you a drink. Don't wasteit."

With that, Emily didn't even glance at Veda, she just turned and walked away.

Once everyone snapped out of their shock, they all stared at Veda. She was on the verge of tears. Someone suggested she go change her clothes to avoid further embarrassment.


Veda could only head upstairs in tears. Mia saw this and went to find Emily.


At that moment, Emily was happily munching on cake. When she saw Mia approaching, she slowly put it down and looked up. "Mom, what's up?



"You bullied Veda again. It's her birthday today. Can't you be more considerate and not cause trouble?"

Emily smiled, but her demeanor was icy. She looked at Mia coldly.

Mia, without even asking for the full story,came over and scolded her.

Emily sneered. "If she disrespects me again, I can do even worse. Ms.Wilson, today is my birthday too. Do I have to bow down to her?"

Mia was taken aback, staring at the unfamiliar Emily in front of her."What did you call me?"

"Ms,Wilson."

Mia raised her hand and slapped her hard, drawing everyone's attention.

It was the first time Mia had ever hit her. Emily's face stung from the slap.

Emily smirked, looking steadily at Mia, and spoke slowly, "This is the last time you'll ever hit me. There won't be another chance."

Emily took a deep breath and walked away. She couldn't understand why Mia was so biased. She was Mia's child.

Mia took a deep breath too. When she first brought Emily back, she knew about Emily's rough past with Isolde and Lucas, and it broke her heart.

She wanted to make it up to Emily. But she had never dealt with someone overly sensitive and cautious. Whatever Emily did, she found it displeasing. She didn't want her daughter to be seen as uncultured or unrefined.


But Veda was different. When she came back to the Johnson Mansion on her own. Mia saw the bruises on her and felt a pang of discomfort.

Veda had been under her care for twèlve years. She shouldn't have to endure such humiliation in someone else's home.

From that point on, Mia started to ignore Emily more and more. As Emily grew up, Mia felt it was too late to make things right.

Everyone laughed at the scene, and the whole atmosphere turned awkward.

Mia's fingertips trembled, her palm red from the slap. Only she knew how hard she had hit, as if she had driven away her only daughter.

Mia regretted it and instinctively wanted to catch up, but then Veda appeared.

She clung to Mia's arm and whispered, "My boyfriend is here."

Emily hadIn't gone far and overheard this.

Everyone's eyes turned to the entrance of the banquet hall. There, John,

looking sharp in a black suit, was walking towards them.

Veda announced in front of everyone that John was her boyfriend,making everyone look at him with even stranger eyes.

John sensed something was off as soon as he walked in. Some people looked at him with disdain, others outright contempt.

He caught snippets of their whispers.

"Isn't he married to Emily? Now he's with her sister too?"

"So he's Veda's boyfriend now? Guess he doesn't care about Emily anymore."

"He didn't care about Emily before, leaving her alone at their grand wedding."

"This is soembarrassing!"

John walked up to the group, frowning as he glanced at Veda,who looked down guiltily.

He had warned her not to reveal their relationship at a big event like this.

Veda clenched her hand nervously. She didn't know if John would be mad,but she wanted to force his hand in front of everyone. Otherwise, he would never divorce Emily!

Emily's cold gaze fell on them. John noticed the slap mark on her face and furrowed his brows.

Veda didn't want John's attention on Emily, so she stepped forward and clung to his arm.

She called him softly, "John."

John reluctantly pulled his gaze away from Emily, looked down at Veda,and discreetly pulled his arm back.

"It's your birthday, so I won't argue with you. Did you forget what I told you?"

Veda bit her lipo. lowered her head, a hint of hurt in her eyes, and whispered, "Do you want me to always be your secret lover?"

John's eyes turned cold. Veda didn't dare say more.She slowly lowered her head,wanting to touch John but hesitating.

Since she was a child, she had always wanted to be the only one in John's eyes.

But when Emily was brought back, her pitiful look and obedience gave John a reason to protect her. Soon, his attention shifted to Emily.

Veda once asked John when she was young, "Why do you like Emily so much?"

She still remembered his answer. He said, "Emily needs protection, and she's beautiful. I like being with her and seeing her smile. I want to protect her forever."

Those words echoed in Veda's ears, stirring up a storm in her heart.
###Chapter 58

Love couldn't be shared.

Veda didn't want John to be all about Emily, so she did everything she could to win him back.


But now, she felt like she was losing him again, and that thought made her super anxious.

Right then, Mia dragged Veda to the center of the stage, right in front of the mic.


Mia shot a glance at Emily, who was staring back at her. Emily's eyes were cold and clear, no blame or jealousy there.

But it gave Mia this weird feeling, like Emily was slowly tearing away the mask of so-called motherly love.

Mia took a deep breath, forced herself to look away from the slap mark on Emily's face, and announced, "Veda is the heiress of the Johnson family.From now on, she's my biological daughter."

Mia didn't say anything else, and the crowd below started congratulating them one by one. Veda hugged Mia happily and called her mom.

Aiden walked up, moved the mic aside, and whispered in Mia's ear, "What about Emily?"

Mia pressed her lips together and stayed quiet.

Aiden looked at Veda, who seemed genuinely happy for the first time in a while. For a mnoment, he felt a bit relieved too.


After the family hug. Mia looked down and saw that Emily was gone.

Emily didn't want to stick around. Mlia didn't want to acknowledge her as her daughter. When Mia declared Veda as the heiress, giving her a rightful status, it felt like a stab in Emily's heart from the person closest to her.

She had thought Mia wouldn't acknowledge an outsider as the heiress,but she had underestimated the bond between Veda and Mia.

But when she reached the door, security stopped her.

"Ms. Emily Johnson, Ms. Veda Johnson said it's your birthday today, and you're not allowed to leave early."

Emily's face turned cold. "Get out of my way!"

Four security guards surrounded her, making it clear that if she tried to force her way out, they'd step in.

"Ms. Emily Johnson, please don't make this hard for us."

Emily took a deep breath, realizing she couldn't leave now. She thought about using force, but the four guards looked pretty skilled, and she was in a dress, so a physical fight wasn't in her favor.

In the end, Emily went back. She didn't want to see John with Veda,or the whole mother-daughter bonding scene between Veda and Mia.

So she decided to head to the dressing room, but as she was halfway up the stairs, Veda caught up with her.

"Emily,there you are."

Emily turned around, facing the person she least wanted to see.

Veda had that innocent look on her face as usual. "Emily, from now on,we're a real family. Aren't you happy?"

Standing a step above her, Emily's tone was a bit condescending. "Veda,drop the innocent act. You really disgust me."

Veda smiled faintly, her eyes clear and innocent, like a bunny's.

"Emily, I grew up with Mom and Dad, and I know them inside out. Even though I was gone for a bit, I know they love me. I've always been their daughter."

Veda's face was sincere, with a hint of happiness in her eyes.

"Emily, don't be jealous. You're their biological daughter, so they must love you too."

Emily frowned, confused about why Veda was saying all this. The first time they met, Veda was in a pink princess dress, with a crown on her head,held in Mia's arms.

She was a real princess, raised in comfort, showered with love,never knowing hunger or want.

At that moment, Emily thought she would also be cherished like a princess and live a good life from then on, because Mia was such a gentle mother.

But Emily's dream shattered. Mia disdained that Emily couldn't paint or play the piano, wasn't elegant, and didn't understand etiquette, which embarrassed her in front of other wealthy ladies. But those things weren't taught in the Isolde household!

Emily sneered."Veda, don't flaunt parents' love in front of me, because

you will always owe me. If you keep showing off, I might just ruin it when I'm not pleased!"

Thinking back to the past. Emily's mood worsened.

Emily asked. "But Veda, why did you use such dirty tricks to take John away?"

Veda's smile slowly faded,turning somewhat sinister.

"Because Ive liked John since I was a kid. He's mine. Why should you come in later? You two shouldn't have had any interaction! Why should John risk his life to save you? Why was he constantly calling your name while making love to me? Why did everything he did back then have to be for you? Was it just because you were the pitiful one? What about me?Wasn't I pitiful too?"

Emily looked at her, sarcastically smiling. "Disgusting."

Emily couldn't be bothered to argue with her about who was in John's heart. She no longer felt the same way about John.

As Emily turned to leave, Veda suddenly grabbed her arm. Before she could shake off Veda's hand, Veda fell backward and tumbled down the stairs.

Veda held her body painfully. "Emily, I know you're jealous, but why did you push me? Did you want me to die like this?"

Emily calmly watched Veda screaming at the bottom of the stairs.

She slowly opened her mouth."You're so shameless."

As she finished speaking,countless people rushed over.

Veda was still apologizing to Emily. "Emily, I know I've wronged you.I shouldn't have taken your place. Emily, I apologize to you. Can you forgive me? Please."

Emily was surrounded by a crowd.

John saw Veda lying on the ground, bleeding from the corner of her mouth,and quickly helped her up. "Veda, are you okay? I'll take you to the hospital."

"Wait." Emily stopped them.

John turned back, and Veda looked at her pitifully.

Emily, with a commanding presence, ignoring all thevoices around her,said sharply, "Veda, you wanted to apologize, right? Then kneel down and apologize properly."

Everyone was stunned.

Mia was the first to speak, "Emily, you pushed Veda down, and you should be the one apologizing!"
###Chapter 59

When Emily heard that, she shot Mia a mocking look. In her black dress,her smooth, delicate skin made the handprint on her face stand out even more.


Mia's heart skipped a beat.

Veda chimed in, "Emily, you're still hung up on me being with John? I've always wanted to apologize and make peace with you. Why can't you just be a bit more forgiving?"

Veda buried her head in John's arms, sobbing softly.

"You took away my and John's baby. If you want my life, take it. From start to finish, I owe you. It's my fault. I'm sorry."

Veda apologized, tears streaming down her face.

John couldn't hold back anymore. He glared at Emily. "Emily, you're truly malicious!"

Emily looked down, her eyes filled with sarcasm and coldness.

Hearing Veda's accusations, everyone pieced together what had happened.

Suddenly, besides the accusations from parents and John, there were whispers among the guests.

"So this is the Johnson family's biological daughter. She is indeed malicious.”

"She really is a country bumpkin through and through,too narrow-minded."
W

"Besides beauty, she probably has no other qualities."

"So. Veda was pregnant with John's child before? And then Emily caused her miscarriage?"

Everyone was shocked, not expecting such juicy gossip at a birthday party.

Their words echoed in Emily's ears, just like when she first arrived at the Johnson Mansion over ten years ago. Even in gorgeous clothes,she wasn't seen as a member of the Johnson family.

Emily kept telling herself not to care, but it was impossible today. Veda had to slander her.

Aiden subconsciously asked Veda, "Veda, are you sure Emily pushed you?Wasn't it an accident?"

Veda sobbed in John's arms. Aiden's expression soured. A birthday party that was going well had turned into this mess, and no one looked happy.

John clearly cared more for Veda. To maintain a good relationship with the Williams family, Aiden hadn't stopped Veda from going abroad with John three years ago. And Emily had moved out of the Williams Mansion.

Most people didn't know about John and Veda's relationship. But with Veda revealing the child's matter, Aiden could already foresee the gossip about the Johnson family. He had to think about their future.

Knowing Aiden well, Veda choked and said, "Dad, it's okay. Emily didn't mean it."

Emily watched Veda's performance. For the first time, she realized Veda had a talent for acting. Veda's display of compromising for the greater good and sisterly love was spot on.


Veda said she didn't blame Emily, but her expression was full of accusations.


This made everyone believe Emily had pushed her, and it also gained sympathy for Veda.


Aiden saw Veda's expression soften and decided to smooth things over."
Emily, apologize to Veda, and let's move on."

"I won't apologize," Emily said, her voice cold and unwavering.

Aiden, hearing the murmurs of criticism around him about his lack of authority and poor parenting, felt increasingly disheartened. His tone turned stern, heavy with pressure. "I command you to apologize! If you don't apologize today, I will no longer consider you my daughter."

Everyone gasped in shock. Mia's face changed slightly, a hint of panic rising in her heart.

In the corridor in front of the lounge, everyone watched the drama unfold in silence. No one could have imagined today's show would be so intense.

Veda was somewhat gloating, thinking, 'Emily, I can't wait to see how you handle thispressure today.'

Emily's eyes flashed as she fixed her gaze on Aiden. "Mr. Johnson, where did I go wrong? It's true that Veda took my parents away.Did I wrongly accuse her?"

Aiden's expression turned ugly.

Someone in the crowd said, "You two were just switched at birth.Veda was also a baby at that time. What did she do wrong?"

Emily sneered. "Right, she did nothing wrong. So am I wrong for being switched? Mr. Johnson, Ms. Wilson, if you can't be fair, then don't take me back. I don't really want you to be my parents. When I first came back home, I was a bit rustic, a bit cautious, and you thought I wasn't worthy of being your daughter."

With just a few simple words, Emily laid bare the truth.

"You ignored me all the way, and all I got was suppression."

Emily's lips parted slightly. "Ms. Wilson, you think I can't measure up without any talents, and Mr. Johnson, you think I haven't created any profit for the Johnson Group. If that's the case, why do you pretend to be loving parents outside all the time? You're tired of pretending, and I'm disgusted to see it."

Aiden's face darkened instantly.

Emily sneered. "Why can't I hate Veda? She got the benefits and still had to mock me about how my parents don't love me. Why should I endure this crap?"

Then she turned to Veda. "Veda, I gave you my parents and my husband.What else do you want?"

Veda was stunned, her mouth opening but no words coming out.

Emily chuckled lightly. "For a hypocrite and brazen person like you, it's a shame that you survived the fall."

Aiden angrily growled, "Shut up!"

He raised his hand to slap her, but Emily grabbed his wrist, looked up at him, and asked, "Mr. Johnson, can't you handle it? Isn't this what you've

been doing to me for so many years? What am I to you? The wedding three years ago..."

John coldly interrupted, "Emily!"

Emily glanced at him, a sarcastic smile on her face. "Mr. Williams,are you also afraid to face the truth? At the wedding three years ago, you followed Veda and left, leaving me alone. The two of you went abroad for three years."


She continued, "I endured all the insults, and I also supported the Williams Group. Logically speaking,you two should both be grateful to me now, and I should be the one you kneel down to!"
###Chapter 60

Everyone was stunned into silence.

Emily stood tall, glaring down at John with a cold stare. She was ready to unleash all the anger she'd bottled up over the years.

Veda finally spoke, "Emily, I'm sorry for what I did to you."

Emily shot back, "Veda, if you're really sorry, then get on your knees. Don't act like I'm the bad guy here. There are cameras everywhere. They caught how you fell. Trying to pull the same trick twice? Not gonna work."

Veda's face went pale, feeling the dull ache from her fall. She wanted to hide in John's arms for some comfort.


Seeing her move, Emily smirked and said, "When I first came back to the Johnson family, I wanted us to be sisters. There was no need for all this drama, but you chose to make me your enemy. Veda, from the moment you plotted against me, I knew you were an idiot!"

Everyone's faces were tense.

"Oh wow! Ms. Emily Johnson really shut Veda up."

"If my parents favored an outsider over me, I'd probably do worse than her."


"Just pushing her down the stairs was mild. I didn't realize the Johnson family always looked down on Emily."

"If they really cared about her, today's banquet would be all about Emily."

People murmured.

Mia trembled slightly, lowering her head, not saying a word since asking Emily to apologize earlier.

Emily had exposed their dirty laundry, turning the banquet into a complete farce.

Emily looked at Aiden and Mia again. "Dad, Mom, this is the last timne I'll call you that. From now on, I'm no longer a Johnson."

Emily hugged them both briefly and stepped back.

"The Johnsons are a big deal in Emerald City. Is she really giving up all that luxury?"

"She still has the Williams family. I heard her cal1 John's mom 'mom'."

"The Williams family treats her well. She's even wearing their heirlooms."

Calliope, watching from the side, felt heartbroken and declared, "I want Emily as the Williams family's daughter."


Calliope walked up, gently hugged Emily, and announced to everyone,"From now on, Emmy is my daughter. Anyone who messes with her will have to deal with me."


Emily's wounded heart felt a bit of healing.

Aiden and Mia were shocked by Emily's bold move, their faces darkening.

Veda's expression was a mix of emotions.

Aiden pointed at Emily angrily. "Don't come crying to us later! You won't be welcome at the Johnson Mansion."

Emily smiled at Calliope, "Mom, let's go."


They started to leave but were stopped a few steps later. Emily looked up and saw James's familiar face.


James stood there in a sharp black suit, looking effortlessly cool with a hint of melancholy on his handsome face.


When everyone saw him, they were shocked, especially Veda. She had invited him, but as the night dragged on, she didn't think he'd show.

Veda blurted out, "Mr. Smith,you have to stand up for me."

The birthday party was supposed to be Veda's big moment,and now all eyes were on her and James.


Everyone in the room was a big deal in Emerald City. They knew James-he was the richest guy in the world and a major player in high society.

They also knew he was in town for his grandmother, but since he hadn't left yet, there had to be some huge project keeping him here. If they could get in on it, even a small piece of the action would boost their family's status.

They'd all been trying to meet James, but he was hard to pin down. Yet somehow,Veda had managed to get him here.


Calliope looked at James, then pulled Emily aside and whispered, "Emmy,let's steer clear of him."


James and Emily exchanged a look, both unsure of what to say.

"Veda wasn't lying. Mr. Smith really showed up."

"The Johnsons are so lucky. If Veda gets close to Mr. Smith, she'll be unstoppable."

"What about John? Just getting James here doesn't mean anything."

Some people were still trying to keep things in perspective.

But as many people who had been laughing at the Johnsons were now envious and jealous. The earlier ddrama was already forgotten.

People around Aiden started to butter him up.

"Mr. Johnson, youar family's about to hit the big leagues."

"If you get a deal with the Smith family, don't forget your old friends."

Aiden had never felt so popular, his face flushed with excitement. He walked up to James eagerly.

"I didn't expect you to come, Mr. Smith. I should've given you a proper welcome."


"Just call me James. No need for formalities."

Aiden was surprised. He thought, 'Is James really this down-to-earth? Isn't he supposed to be aloof and cold? Maybe the rumors aren't true.'

But Aiden also figured it was because of Veda. She must be pretty well-liked at the Golden Birch Group to pull this off.

Veda spoke up, her voice shaky. "Mr. Smith, my sister accidentally pushed me down the stairs, and I didn't even ask her to apologize, but now she wants to cut ties with our parents. Mr. Smith, please help me."

Veda sobbed softly, looking all innocent.

James gave her a cold look and said, "Seems like I missed quite the show."

His eyes landed on Emily, noticing the red mark on her face.

She was someone he cared about, and today she got slapped!
###Chapter 61

Aiden caught James' stare and felt a bit uneasy.

Without missing a beat, he snapped, "Emily, since we're done, just get out of here."


Emily's face stayed blank. Calliope shot Aiden a furious look and started to pull Emily away, but James blocked their path again.

Calliope didn't care about the deal between the Williams Group and the Golden Birch Group. She held back her anger and asked coldly,"Mr.Smith,what do you mean? We can't even leave now?"

James replied gently,"Mrs. Williams, we need to clear things up."

Calliope frowned, half-hugging Emily protectively.

She turned to Emily and whispered, "Emmy, has Mr. Smith lost it? Why is he so officious?"


Emily sighed and looked at Calliope. "Mom, let's just wait."

James had actually shown up earlier but got held up by Anais outside.After finally shaking her off, he was a bit late coming back in.

Emily usually didn't let much get to her, like nothing could break her down. But now, her eyes were red, showing signs of being wronged,though she didn't cry.

James remembered what Veda had said earlier, and a cold aura surrounded him. The air felt a bit thinner.

James' tone was calm, but anyone could tell he was pissed.

He looked at Veda. "Ms. Veda Johnson, are you sure Emily pushed you?"

By now, John had helped Veda up, and she had some light scrapes.

She said in a choked voice, "I believe Emily didn't do it on purpose."

James narrowed his eyes, full of pressure. "Whether she did it on purpose or not, you're sure she pushed you,right?"

Veda was taken aback by his question, slowly raised her head, and looked at him pitifully.

James changed his approach. "Are you sure you're not lying?"

There were murmurs among the crowd. Veda's palms were sweating.
Every word James said carried weight. He controlled the situation like a king.

Veda clenched her hands and quickly said, "I'm not lying. Emily was jealous that our parents favored me, and John liked me more, so we argued. Then she pushed me down the stairs."

The surveillance at Celestial Cuisine had been unplugged by her in advance. There would be no loopholes because no one could believe she would joke with her own body.

Mia sided with Veda and said directly, "When we got there, Veda was already at the bottom of the stairs. The injuries on Veda's body can't be fake."

James' gaze swept coldly over everyone present. Except for Calliope,no one seemed to believe Emily.

For some reason, Veda vaguely felt that James was trying to side with

Emily.James was here to celebrate her birthday. He couldn't have a relationship with Emily. Apart from a little work-related connection,they had no personal interaction!

Veda frowned, her gaze on Emily, with a hint of scrutiny in her eyes. But when Emily looked back at her, Veda slowly lowered her eyes.

James and Emily couldn't have any relationship. After all, Emily was a married woman. Veda felt relieved.

Choking back tears, Veda spoke again, "Mr. Smith, you don't know that Emily is very jealous. Because our parents favor me and John prefers me,she wanted to hurt me."

James said calmly, "I'm not here to discuss right or wrong with you. In my eyes, whatever Emily does is right. Do you understand?"

Everyone was stunned.

Then James continued, "Don't you know why Emily dislikes you deep down? As a beneficiary, do you think it's right to show off in front of Emily every day?"


At these words, everyone present was shocked. They never expected such words to come out of James' mouth, and they were almost the same as what Emily had just said.


Feeling something wrong, Aiden hurriedly said, "Mr. Smith, this is just a private matter in our family. I hnave failed to teach my daughter properly,and I apologize for making you witness this."

James glanced indifferently at Aiden and said in a flat tone, "From what I know about Emmy, if she pushed Veda down the stairs, Veda wouldn't be able to stand up."

At this point, even the most obtuse person present knew that James definitely knew Emily.

James didn't even hesitate to call her Emmy, such an intimate nickname.

Veda gritted her teeth, and John whispered in her ear, "Stop it. Don't you think it's embarrassing enough?"

Veda lost her mind instantly. John was still protecting Emily. The little bit of self-esteem in Veda's heart was suddenly shattered by John.

Everything she did was to be with John. As long as she became the true heiress of the Johnson family, they would no longer have any barriers in terms of status.

Veda forced a pale smile, looked at Emily, and spoke slowly, "Mr. Smith,my sister likes John, but John likes me. For the past three years, John has been with me. My sister became insanely jealous. And today, with our parents being so good to me, she couldn't control her emotions and hurt me."


James almost laughed at her words.

Calliope frowned on the side and glared at John. He used to be quite clear-headed, but his intelligence degraded after being with Veda for three years.She felt embarrassed.


John clenched his lips, feeling like he had become an animal in a zoo,being watched by everyone. He took a deep breath, wanting to get away from Veda immediately.

James said in a deep voice, "Is Emmy coveting John? Is that why she has a bad relationship with you?"

Others didn't find anything wrong with this statement, but Emily could sense a hint of jealousy. James was really the jealous type!

Veda nodded solemnly. At this point, Veda didn't care if she would be seen as a third party.

She added, "John is so outstanding, so it's normal for Emily to like him."

But then, James suddenly smiled. "Why would my girlfriend covet other men?"
###Chapter 62

The room went dead quiet as soon as those words hit the air. After a few seconds, everyone started gasping in shock.


Calliope stared at Emily, blinking in disbelief. How could Emily be James's girlfriend?


The crowd's brains took a moment to catch up, then the gasps of shock started rolling in.

"How is that even possible?" Veda blurted out, clearly not buying it. "She's already married to John. How could she be your girlfriend?"

Veda's eyes were full of distrust.

James turned to Emily, tilting his head. "Emmy, why keep hiding the truth now?"

Emily gave Calliope a reassuring look, then walked over and naturally ended up in James' arms.

James calling her "Emmy" in front of everyone meant there was no point in hiding their relationship anymore.

He looked down at her, kissed her forehead gently, his eyes full of affection.

Then,James turned to the crowd, his gaze sharp. "Don't we make a good match?"

He kissed and hugged Emily, leaving everyone stunned. They'd never seen James look at a woman with such tenderness.

The young ladies around were practically swooning over James'

affectionate gaze, secretly wishing they were the ones in his arms. Their looks at Emily shifted from disdain to envy.

Calliope finally got why James was so polite to her at first. He actually wanted to be with Emily.

Veda's jealousy was almost palpable as she coldly said, "It's impossible.
She's already married to John! Mr. Smith,don't be fooled by her!"

James sneered. "Funny, I didn't know my girlfriend was married."

Veda thought it was typical for James to be seduced by Emily.

She glanced at John, hoping he'd say they weren't divorced yet, which would make Emily a cheater. But she forgot, John was the first to cheat.

John's eyes stayed on Emily, who.was in James' arms, his emotions all over the place.


"She married John three years ago. This is infidelity. And Mr. Smith,you're the third party in her marriage!" Veda accused.

The crowd gasped, thinking Veda had lost it.

James' eyes turned icy.

"Ms. Veda Johnson, are you done pretending? You were so friendly at first,but now you're just slandering Emily. You're truly malicious and ill-mannered. I wonder how you were raised in the Johnson family.Sure enough, like parents, like daughter. I'm grateful Emmny wasn't raised by your parents."


James finished his rant, leaving everyone from the Johnson family,except Emily,in shock.


Calliope tried to suppress a laugh, her shoulders shaking. It was the first time she'd seen Mia and Aiden so defeated, and it felt good. But looking at Emily, her heart ached for her.


Being publicly called out by James made Veda tremble with anger.

"But she pushed me! That proves she's cold-blooded," Veda said, her voice shaking.

James shot her a cold, dangerous look. "Ms. Veda Johnson, are you sure it was my girlfriend who pushed you? You really want to risk framing her?"

Seeing James stand up for Emily like that, Veda's face tuarned red with anger. She gritted her teeth and said slowly, "I swear it was Emily who pushed me. If I'm lying, let the Johnson family go bankrupt, and let me,Veda, die a miserable death!"

Aiden frowned on the side.

Veda never believed in oaths, thinkingthey were just empty words.

James' icy gaze locked onto Veda, and he sneered. "I hope you don't regret it when it's time to fulfill that oath."

Emily whispered something in his ear, surprising James.

"You knew about this too?" James asked.

He patted her head. "I knew you wouldn't come to the banquet unprepared."

James pulled out his phone and called the manager of Celestial Cuisine.

The manager, already aware of the situation, was sweating bullets when he answered."Mr. Smith, what can I do for you?" he asked, trying to keep his

voice steady.

"Turn on Galileo System and show what happened on that staircase."

The manager didn't waste any time.

Veda's eyes widened, and she started to tremble. The Galileo System was a 360-degree surveillance system with no blind spots.

Soon,clear images of her and Emily were projected on the big screen at the banquet. Veda was completely stunned, her mind going blank.

Her jealousy was laid bare, and her dark side was exposed for everyone to see. Their conversation played out clearly for all to hear.

"But Veda, I'm curious, why did you use such dirty tricks to take John away?"

"Because I've liked John since I was a kid. He's mine. Why should you come in later? You two shouldn't have had any interaction..."

It turned out Veda was the one truly jealous. She had voluntarily fallen backward,her screams drawing a crowd. The scene ended there.

The entire banquet hall fell eerily silent. Emily had never pushed Veda.It was all a performance orchestrated by Veda. Everyone had been her pawns,with every move aimed at Emily.

"Veda is too malicious. She not only took Emily's parents away but also her husband."

"Yeah, she's been a villain since childhood. She doesn't understand gratitude at-all."

"If the Johnson family thinks they can rely on her to prosper, they're


dreaming."

People around whispered and pointed fingers.

Veda stood there, feeling dizzy. This scheming drama that was meant to make Emily face defeat and total public disgrace ended up backfiring on her instead.


It was like a poisonous snake was coiling in her heart,gnawing away at her sanity.

Clutching her hands tightly, Veda couldn't control herself and shouted, "It was all a setup by Emily!"
###Chapter 63

Veda's voice was all over the place, panting and shaking like a leaf.She finally noticed everyone staring at her like she was some kind of freak.

Aiden had never felt so humiliated. James had just been nice to him, and now this? It was like getting slapped in the face.

Aiden couldn't take it anymore. He stormed over and slapped Veda hard."Shut up! You made this mess, and now you're putting the blame on Emily?Haven't you caused enough trouble?"

Veda's lips quivered. Aiden had never been this mad at her before.

Tears streamed down Veda's face. Her mind was a blank slate. How did things get so messed up?

Aiden awkwardly apologized to everyone, "I'm really sorry about today.My daughters are having a spat and causing a scene."

He was trying to smooth things over, taking advantage of the real victim's-Emily's silence.

Veda bit her lip,feeling totally exposed and humiliated. Her dignity was in shreds.

Instinctively, Veda looked for someone to protect her. When she saw John,he was staring at Emily. Jealousy gnawed at her.

Why couldn't she get into John's heart after three years? Veda was terrified John would fall for Emily again.

Since Emily came back to the Johnson Mansion at twelve, Veda had felt the pressure every day.

She had to be better to make up for her own insecurities. She wasn't Aiden and Mia's biological daughter!

She had to keep Emily down to secure her place in the Johnson family.Veda was desperate to get Emily out of the picture!

Veda glanced at Mia, but Mia's eyes, usually so warm, were icy cold.It sent a shiver down her spine.

After slapping Veda, Aiden walked over to Emily, his tone softening. "Emmy,I misunderstood you."

Then he turned to Veda, his voice icy. "Veda, apologize to your sister!"

Veda couldn't believe it. But with everyone watching, she took a deep breath, walked over to Emily, and grudgingly said, "Emily, I'm sorry.I shouldn't have slandered you. I was just joking."

Aiden quickly added, "Veda's still young and naive. Don't take it to heart.We're all family, no need for such deep hatred,right?"

Emily had been quietly held by James the whole time, not saying a word.Even though she was the one involved,she seemed detached.

Hearing this, Emily smiled sarcastically. "Mr. Johnson, you might think this is a joke, but I don't. I've cut ties with the Johnson family, so your family drama isn't my problem. As for the wvrongs I've suffered, I'll deal with them in my own time."

Emily's eyes were icy and distant. From Aiden's words, she realized he never really trusted her.

Now,he was only making Veda apologize to save face for the Johnson family, not for what she had suffered. Emily was done with Aiden's moral


high ground.

Aiden never truly wanted her as his daughter.


James looked down at Emily with tenderness. Then his gaze turned cold as he looked at someone nearby and said, "Emmy, let's go."

Aiden's face darkened, and Mia's expression soured even more.

As they took a few steps, James turned to the crowd. "It's my girlfriend's birthday today. If you don't mind, join us on the top floor to celebrate."

Emily raised an eyebrow, looking at James curiously, and whispered,"James, I think you're deliberately making our relationship public."

Most of the big shots in Emerald City were there. With James making such a public statement, everyone would know she was his girlfriend by tomorrow.

As James's words sank in, thecrowd buzzed. Since James personally invited them, everyone wanted to show respect and get on his good side.

"Mr. Smith, we're going to celebrate Ms. Emily Johnson's birthday."

Throughout the whole ordeal, Emily never looked back at her biological parents. She followed James to the top floor.
In just a few minutes, the Johnson family's banquet hall went from packed to empty, looking desolate.

Calliope didn't even glance at John, her heart burning with anger. John was grown up, and she couldn't control him anymore!
Only the Johnson family blood relatives remained. Someone walked up to Aiden, sighed heavily, and said, "You finally found your real daughter,
1


only to drive her away yourself.Why bother?"

He continued, "Emmy is talented. The perfumes she designed for the company are amazing and popular. We even tried tweaking her formulas to keep customers, but they were all subpar. If she's really connected with the Smith family, the sky's the limit. What a mess this is."

Everyone sighed, glaring at Veda with resentment.

Veda didn't dare say a word. She quietly hid behind John, lightly clutching his sleeve with her fingers, hoping for some protection.


But John shook off her hand harshly, then stared at her and said, "Veda,am I just a tool for you to get back at your sister?"

Veda was stunned. The coldness in John's eyes filled her with fear.

When John started to walk out, Veda didn't hesitate to follow him.

It was already hard for her to walk in a long dress, and after falling down the stairs, she felt like her bones were about to shatter.

"John, John!" Veda called out loudly.

But John didn't even look back until he was outside the hotel.

The cold wind outside seemed to clear John's mind a bit. When he turned around, Veda had followed him out.

"John." Veda's voice was filled with hurt and a hint of tears. "My whole body hurts."
###Chapter 64

John turned back to look at Veda, her eyes all puffy from crying, looking really pitiful.


Veda said sadly, "I messed up. It's all because I feel so uneasy. John, do you know what people usually say about me? They all disapprove of me,and I can never hold my head up around them. I don't want it to be like this. I want to show everyone that I'm the daughter of the Johnson family."

She continued, "John, I love you so much, and I want to be with you.If I were part of the Johnson family, I'd definitely be worthy of you."

John lowered his head, looking at Veda's terrified eyes. She had always seen John as a deity.

John's gaze softened a bit, but his voice stayed cold. "Veda, this isn't the first time. You used Nora to frame Emily before, and I forgave you. And I've seen those things on your computer. This time, your malice is beyond my imagination. You've disappointed me too much."

John couldn't believe how the gentle Veda could turn so malicious.

Shock was clear in Veda's eyes. John had secretly looked at her computer,so he must know her password.

Veda clenched her fists, lowered her head, a hint of surprise flashing in her eyes hidden by her hair. Given John's reaction, Veda figured he hadn't discovered about those secrets.

Veda breathed a sigh of relief. She was still crying as she walked step by step towards John, slowwly holding his hand. A tear fell on the back of her hand. "But I love you so much. I don't want you to have Emily in your

heart and ignore me. Please give me another chance. I don't want to break up with you."

The almost devout, crazy admiration in Veda's eyes made John feel like he was the most outstanding man in the world, while in front of Emily, he could only feel inferior and even have to grovel and please her.

The weather outside was cold. John saw Veda shivering, took her back to the car, and draped his coat over her.

Veda saw a slight softening in his eyes, gathered courage and spoke, "John,Emily actually wanted to divorce you a long time ago. Now being with James,she definitely wouldn't consider you her husband anymore. Before you came, she said she didn't want you and asked me to give you the divorce agreement. This is our voice conversation."

Veda took out her phone and played the so-called conversation.

In the recording, Emily's voice came over. "I agreed to divorce John a long time ago, but I just didn't expect the divorce agreement to be given by you.John truly loves you."

Emily's voice in the phone continued, "I disdain to have someone like John around anymore."

The voice stopped there, and the rest was Veda crying and saying that John was not like that. It gave a feeling of fervently showing loyalty in front of John.

But John's eyes became colder. 'It's voice recordings again.'

Last time, Emily explained she had never said those disparaging words about him, though he had heard them on voice recordings from Veda's phone.


Veda thought he would be angry at Emily after hearing what she said.Her courage rose, and she said directly, "By the way, the divorce agreement is with me. Emily has already signed it, and you should sign it too."


Veda pulled the divorce agreement out of her bag.

John's expression turned strange, his voice dripping with sarcasm. "Did Emily really sign this?"


He unfolded the agreement and, sure enough, saw Emily's signature. The handwriting was definitely hers.


Emily had told Veda that as long as John signed the divorce agreement first.she would sign it.


But Veda knew John well. With his prideand arrogance,he would never sign it first. But if Emily did, he'd be on board. And with the voice recordings. John shouldn't have any doubts.


John stared at Emily's name, his heart pounding hard in his chest.Meanwhile, the memories seemed to be forcing their way out of his mind.


Emily would never speak in a monotone like a robort,but he had ignored that fact all these years. And regardless of whether Emily liked him now,she would never speak of him in such a derogatory manner. If not, in these three years, she could have caused a huge uproar.


Moreover, Emily would never sign a divorce agreement. They didn't even have a marriage certificate, so there was no need for divorce procedures.

Emily had already unilaterally announced the breakup and moved out of the Williams Mansion. But Veda didn't know.

So there was only one possibility left. Veda had drafted a divorce agreement herself, wanted him to sign it first, and then hand it to Emily.Both of them, with their pride, would not ask each other about the truth.Naturally, Emily would sign it.

John had never thought he would suspect Veda in such a malicious way.But it was the fact that Veda was deceiving him.

John's fingers tightly gripped the agreement, crumpling the papers. His eyes were filled with anger.

A pressure weighed on John's chest, making it almost hard for him to breathe.

Johna finally lifted his head, his voice terrifyingly cold. "Veda,are you sure this was signed by Emily?"

Veda seemed to see the restraint and almost anger in his eyes,suddenly feeling uneasy in her heart.

She thought. What happened to John suddenly? He wasn't so excited just now.

Veda pursed her lips and nodded."Yes."

At this moment, John felt a sudden void in his heart, and his breath was choked.

He was angry and his veins bulged on his forehead. He suddenly realized that he had been manipulated by Veda for so many years.

In front of him, Veda always looked pure and kind. She was weak and pitiful, willing to be a mistress for love, making him feel forever guilty towards her.

At this moment, John finally saw through Veda's hypocrisy. He was furious and slapped Veda hard with his hand.

Veda's face was turned away by the beating, and her head hit the car window glass. The pain made her vision turn black and she couldn't react for a long time.

Veda had never seen John so crazy. His eyes were instantly filled with red blood streaks.


Finally, John raised his head, his gaze cold, his voice terrifyingly cold."Veda, I will never trust you again."
###Chapter 65

Veda felt uneasy. She looked at John, her eyes wide with surprise,and covered her face. "John, why?"

This was the first time John had ever laid a hand on her.

Veda still didn't know why, and disappointment in John filled her heart.

There was a look of hatred in John's eyes, almost burning Veda to ashes.

When John turned and left, he didn't even glance back at Veda. He quickly headed to the top floor.

The banquet hall on the top floor was buzzing with activity. World-class pianists were playing music.

The place was massive, with a dining area featuring long rectangular tables covered in pristine satin tablecloths, loaded with fancy food. There were also towering champagne towers everywhere.

In the middle of the banquet hall was a huge dance floor, packed with people dancing. Emily and James were among them.

After being taken to the top floor, Emily had already changed into a new evening gown. The silver-gray brocade, adorned with fine diamonds,shimmered like a dazzling meteor shower.

The semi-transparent skirt was faintly visible, dazzling and eye-catching.making her the center of attention.

Emily's beauty was so stunning it was beyond compare. Everyone's gaze was irresistibly drawn to her.


There were many people jealous ofEmily. But at this moment, they had to admit that Emily and James were truly a perfect match.

Emily was incredibly beautiful, while James was devastatingly handsome.Neither could outshine the other.


John saw the two of them dancing and couldn't help but want to get closer to Emily. But the closer he got, the more indescribable feelings arose in his heart. He wanted to separate the two, but he didn't have the courage.

Just then, after a dance, he actually took a step back, afraid that Emily would see him.


The entire banquet hall erupted in warm applause.

James led Emily to the center of the dance floor and spoke in a deep voice,"Today is my girlfriend Emily's birthday. As long as you offer your blessings, you can become a lifetime member of Quigr Jewelry,enjoying all the membership benefits."

The crowd suddenly went wild. Quigr Jewelry was an internationally renowned jewelry brand. Even the cheapest jewelry was in the eight figures. What's more, while it was mainly royalty who could afford to wear these jewels, most of them could only rented them since they lacked membership.

But with membership, one could enjoy discounts and many privileges.For them, this was a huge opportunity.

Emily looked at James in astonishment. He really was generous.

Quigr Jewelry was under the Golden Birch Group, with a very high international reputation. One couldn't buy its jewelry unless he was a member.


Everyone couldn't wait to offer their blessings.

"I wish Ms. Johnson and Mr. Smith an early marriage and have lovely babies." The first to shout was James's friend Eric.


He was unrestrained in daily life. Now he was drunk, shouting loudly.

But James directly said. "The land you want in the Starry Capital, I'll give it to you. Come to my office tomorrow to discuss the details."


Everyone was dumbfounded. They began to follow suit.

"I wish Ms. Johnson and Mr. Smith a lifetime of happiness."


Emily furrowed her brows slightly. Today was her birthday, but it seemed like they were celebrating her wedding.


The blessings were getting more and more over the top, like wishing for kids soon. growing old together, and al that jazz.

But no matter what, the lively vibe of the evening helped Emily shake off her grievances and sorrows. Breaking ties with the Johnson family didn't seem so hard to swallow anymore.


Tonight,Mia shattered their last bit of mother-daughter bond with a slap,and Aiden only cared about his own interests, never treating her like his own daughter.


All her fantasies about them were crushed in one night.

Listening to these blessings, Calliope felt a bit uncomfortable for a moment.
She stared at Emily blankly.

Seeing the concern in Calliope's eyes, Emily gently brushed off James's hand,walked towards her, took her arm, and said loudly, "Why don't you
	JJ

all bless me for being adopted by the Williams family."

James chimed in, "Congrats to Emmy for a new life, with a mother's love."

Emily hugged Calliope and whispered, "Mom, I know what you're worried about. James is good to me, and he won't harm me."

Seeing everything James had done for Emily, Calliope actually understood.She should be quite relieved as well.


The blessings kept coming, and even James was super friendly towards her.Calliope knew it was all for Emily's sake.


So,Calliope didn't bring up John, but looked at James and said, "I didn't bring you a gift today. I'll make it up to you later. I know the Smith family may not consider it significant, but please don't refuse it. This is the custom of our Emerald City. Since you are together, you naturally have to accept my gifts."

James was taken aback for a moment. Until Emily glanced at him,he nodded in agreement.

Amidst the excitement, a loud noise pierced the night sky. A huge firework bloomed in the night sky, like a hot rose suddenly blooming,painting the sky a fiery red.

The beautiful and pure fireworks cast light on the banquet hall, which was entirely transparent.

Everyone was captivated by the fireworks, and James took the opportunity to pull Emily away from Calliope, leading her directly into the elevator.Emily didn't know what he was up to, but she went along with it.

After coming out of the elevator, they went to an openplatform,even a bit

desolate. But soon, Emily discovered that this was an excellent spot to watch the fireworks, and she could reach out and almost touch them. It was as if the fireworks were blooming right at her fingertips.

The unimpeded visual impact was breathtaking.

Emily looked up, her eyes shimmering. She wasn't someone who was easily moved, but never in her life had someone given her a surprise like this.


This kind of shock to the soul made Emily's eyes slightly red for a moment.


James camne over from behind and easily embraced her in his arms.His voice was gentle. "Tonight's fireworks are for you."

After a while, Emily turned her head and suddenly asked, "How much did all this cost you?"

James, who had prepared a response, was caught off guard by her question."Emily, I don't want to draw such a clear line between you and me."

Emily turned around, hooked her arms around James's neck.

The fireworks were stunning and beautiful. But none of them compared to the James in front of her that made her heart race.
###Chapter 66

Emily's eyes flickered a bit. She tilted her head and said, "James, I'll pay you back for all this someday."

James's eyes still sparkled with the fireworks' glow. He sighed. "Do we really have to talk about this now?"

Emily kissed him softly, smiled, and whispered, "James, thanks for today."

James had given her dignity when she needed it most.

James stared at her. "If you're so grateful, then give me something."

Emily playfully pinched his earlobe and asked, "What do you want?"

James replied slowly, "I want you to acknowledge me as your boyfriend in public."

Emily's hand paused. She pulled back and chuckled.

"James, that's not funny. You already called me your girlfriend today,and it's already hard to explain the real deal to my colleagues tomorrow. Plus,it'll definitely make headlines."

Emily looked a bit troubled.

James's smile faded a bit, and he said seriously, "Are you denying it? You don't want to be my girlfriend?"

Emily shook her head. "I set some ground rules when I'm with you."

"I thought you'd be really touched tonight." James gently played with her hair, his gaze dropping with a hint of disappointment.


Emily hesitated to meet his eyes and spoke softly, "I appreciate your support, but this is different. I don't want to solve one problem just to face another."

James raised an eyebrow. "You think I'm a problem?"

Emily nodded naturally. First, their backgrounds were too different.Second, she knew James had two older brothers and a sister, all with different mothers, and their relationships were strained.

These siblings held key positions in the Smith family's business empire.Their spouses were also top figures in the industry, making it a marriage of equals. Plus, their kids were only a few years younger than James and were already getting involved inthe family business.

James became CEO of Golden Birch Group with his grandfather's help,but his shares were less than his three siblings combined. They were united against him.

James was capable, no doubt. Otherwise, even with his grandfather's help,he wouldn't have held onto his position.

James also had a full brother he got along with, but his brother didn't want to be involved in the company and couldn't help him.

James might seem powerful, but it was lonely at the top. Emily didn't want to get tangled in such a complicated situation.

James kept staring at Emily, realizing she was serious. He suddenly felt a bit choked up. "Everyone else sees me as a support, but you see me as a problem,"

All the setbacks James hadI faced in his life were because of Emily. This frustrated him. Emily just smiled lightly.

James knew Emily was right. He was a problem now. Being his wife isn't an easy job. One wrong move, and she could risk her life. So, James didn't dare make promises lightly.

James lowered his head, looking at the bright and beautiful Emily in front of him, feeling a sharp pain in his heart.

In his dark life, Emily had always been his beacon of hope. He couldn't bear to see her get hurt.

He'd face all the dangers alone. No need to drag her into it.

James wrapped his arm around Emily's neck, lowered his head, and kissed her fiercely.

He pressed against her soft lips, gradually intensifying the kiss. Their lips and tongues intertwined, as if he wanted to consume her entirely.

Emily held him, looking at James seriously. His features were delicate, and when he spoke sweet words and asked for a commitment, she felt a pang of guilt.

She couldn't make eye contact. If she did, she'd give in.

It would be a lie to say she wasn't moved. But she couldn't afford to be moved again. Some promises were too heavy to bear.

They were both smart enough to know that their current arrangement was the best-no talk of emotions or entanglement of interests, just unrestrained hugs, kisses, and lovemaking.

No reservations. If one day they couldn't stand each other, they could just walk away.

James's kiss grew more intense. He wished he could merge Emily into his very being.


Amidst the fireworks, John approached from below. He couldn't hear their words, but he could see the tender, affectionate, indulgent, and inclusive look in their eyes.


When the two embraced and kissed, it felt like a knife stabbing into his heart, making it hard to breathe.


After Emily was taken away, John knew she would become his wife,so he protected and cherished her.


He gave Emily many firsts-the first time holding hands, the first time fighting for a girl, the first date.

He used to think watching movies was boring, but with Emily,everything felt natural.


Every day with Emily was fulfilling and joyful. If she was unhappy or uncomfortable, he would make her happy and help her adapt to the elite life. He would support her and lift her spirits.

However, as Emily's excellence grew, John's jealousy gradually took hold.

He hated her excellence and hated seeing countless admirers behind her.So when Veda deceived him, he didn't hesitate to believe it.

In John's mind, Emily should be vain. She should still be the insecure and sensitive girl she used to be, hiding behind him and seeking his protection.


It wasn't until today that John realized Emily had always been radiant.She never bothered to argue with Veda, let alone with anything about the Johnson family.

Realizing he had pushed Emily away with his own hands, John felt endless regret.


He was with Veda to retaliate against Emily. He wanted to see her lose control and beg him. But none of that happened. And now, it's too late.


John forced a smile. While the two were still kissing passionately, he felt his eyes getting moist.


He turned and walked away. He was an adult now and had to take responsibility for his actions.
###Chapter 67

After James and Emily left Celestial Cuisine, they headed back to Crystal Valley Manor.

The moment they stepped inside. James didn't even bother taking off his clothes. He lifted Emily up, her legs wrapping around his waist,and kissed her passionately.


Emily's phone buzzed with a call from a friend, and she was about to answer when James swiftly turned it off. She was left speechless.

With a smirk. James looked deep into her eyes. "Emily, am I less important than your friend?"


Emily found him a bit childish and snorted. "You're the one who turned off my phone. Who do you think matters more?"


James was the hero of the night, and even though Emily was a bit tired,she was still willing to play along.


James's fingers had already slipped under her skirt, knowing exactly where to touch. Emily's thighs were already slick, and with just a few touches.she tightened her legs around him. She was already embarrassingly wet.

Blushing,Emily pressed her body against his, her slender waist twisting in his arms.


James's eyes darkened as his hand skillfully parted her labia and plunged into her wetness.

His voice was hoarse with desire."Emily,will you give yourself to me?"


It was pure, unfiltered seduction.

His warm breath on her ear was like a drug, making her body go weak.

At that moment, she would give him anything he wanted.

Emily's body trembled as James's fingers explored her, her face flushed with shyness, her eyes misty.


Watching her blush. James's erection grew even harder. His fingers continued to thrust inside her,brushing against her sensitive clit.

Emily couldn't handle the stimulation. Her mind fogged by alcohol, she let out a few seductive moans, lost in her delirium.


Her full breasts heaved, her petite body becoming even softer.

Seeing Emily endure and gasp, her face unable to resist his teasing,James was filled with possessive satisfaction.

Although her earlier rejection on the platform had left him a bit resentful,that feeling was easily overshadowed by current passion.

Now,he just wanted to have her fiercely, to make her think only of him.

As Emily's desire grew, James coaxed her, "Emily, would you mind undressing yourself? I want you."

Finally, James let go of her lusciouas lips, deliberately licking the saliva from the corner of her mouth, reaching the peak of sensuality.

As he spoke, his firm lower abdomen pressed against her flexible waist,his hard erection rubbing against her wetness through his pants.

Emily's body had become limp with desire, entirely at his mercy,yet James maintained his usual gentleness in asking, a tenderness that threatened to captivate her completely.

Feeling a rush of excitement, Emily obediently started undressing herself.James impatiently stripped off her clothes, taking in her perky breasts,slender waist, and flat, sexy abdomen.

"James, James," she kept calling his name.

With flushed eyes. James unbuttoned his pants, pulled out his wet fingers,and eagerly penetrated her dripping wetness.

Emily's body trembled, her full breasts swaying with each movement.


His familiar, thick length was hitting her softest and most sensitive spots,sending waves of intense pleasure through her.


James tore off his own clothes, pressing his naked chest against Emily's full breasts.


The intimate skin-to-skin contact ignited a spark of desire in James's eyes.His lips couldn't help but kiss her earlobes, neck, and other sensitive areas.

His voice was hoarse with need. He was angry at Emily's emotional distance and wanted their relationship to be forever entangled.

But Emily stuck to her rules. If he left, she wouldn't ask him to stay. A strong sense of uncertainty gnawed at James.

He held Emily tightly,his breath unsteady as he covered her mouth, his firm lower abdomen thrusting in and out fiercely.

Emily's tightness only increased in his embrace. With each thrust,he could feel her tender flesh squeezing him tightly. It was crazily arousing.

Watching Emily close her eyes and entwine tongues with him. her alluring red face and seductive lips, James couldn't help but play with her soft

breasts. thrusting his hard length forcefully. The warm fluid between them increased, and Emily felt her body heating up, the intense pleasure escalating.

"James, that's enough," she pleaded.

But James delved even deeper. Under his deliberate teasing, Emily reached her first climax.

Emily was almost about to collapse on James, but he just flipped her over,spanked her plump buttocks a few times, and then entered her from behind.


His hands covered Emily's breasts from behind, playing with them wantonly.

The night was still young.

Emily's voice was almost hoarse from calling out, her chest red from his play, her nipples hard and erect, even as James sucked on them. His length insíde her seemed to harden again.

Emily couldn't help but roll her eyes. "James, enough!"

James seemed to never tire of making love.

By the time Emily fell asleep, it was almost morning. The announcement of her relationship with James caused an uproar online. But since her phone was off, no one could reach her. At least she had a peaceful sleep.

Unable to sleep, James finished washing up and lay on the side of the bed,scratches on his chest and back tinged with a bit of blood.

He had been rough with Emily, and in return, she had left marks on his

back as a form of punishment.

James indulgently watched Emily,lowered his head,and slowly placed a kiss on her forehead.
###Chapter 68

Emily didn't make it to the office until the afternoon.

When she finally showed up, everyone swarmed around her.

"Ms. Johnson, you're dating Mr. Smith? Why didn't you tell us sooner?"

"You wouldn't believe it, the fireworks last night went on forever. Talk about burning money!"

Twitter was blowing up with posts about James and Emily.

Emily wasn't shocked by their reactions. Since she couldn't really explain,she just smiled.

Someone piped up, "Ms. Johnson, were you with James last night?"

Emily and Veda had been fiercely competing for a deal with the Golden Birch Group. Veda must be kicking herself now.

Thinking about it, Emily decided to rub it in a bit. Ignoring her colleagues'questions, she headed straight to the Golden Birch Group with her design drafts.

Before, the receptionists at Golden Birch would either stop her or make her sign in. But after last night, everyone assumed Emily was the queen of the place and couldn't wait to welcome her in.

Emily went straight to the design department to find Veda, who seemed unfazed by last night's drama.

Veda was surrounded by admirers.

"Veda, you're incredible, hosting a banquet at Celestial Cuisine for the city's


elite. You're the top socialite now."

"Veda, you've got the background, the education, and the design skills.You're perfect!"


When Emily had woken up at noon, she had noticed there were no trending topics about the scandal or the Johnson family heiress. She figured the Johnson family or John had paid to bury it. Those folks cared a lot about their image and wouldn't want last night's mess going public.

Even the fact that she had cut ties with the Johnson family hadn't leaked.

Emily found it laughable that the Johnson family would go to such lengths for Veda, an outsider's daughter.

Emily walked over, took out some medicine she bought downstairs, and handed it to Veda with a smile. "Veda, here's some medicine for you.You took a tumble down the stairs last night, so take care of yourself."

The moment Emily appeared, the illusion Veda had woven for herself came crashing down.

Suddenly, everyone was giving Veda weird looks. "Veda, you fell last night?Are you okay? You should see a doctor."

"Why don't you take a few more days off?"

Everyone's concern only made Veda, who was already upset,feel worse.

She had called John all night, but he didn't pick up. And he didn't come home.

Veda was freaking out. Deep down, she knew it wasn't the Johnson family backing her, but John. Yet Emily had just taken that support away.

Thinking about the slap John gave her before leaving yesterday, Veda's cheeks burned with pain.

She looked at Emily with a mix of jealousy and something else.

If Emily spilled what happened last night. Veda would be done at Golden
Birch, and her reputation would be trashed.

So Veda spoke up first, "Emily, what happened yesterday was my fault.I know I messed up. We're sisters, after all. Can you forgive me this once?"

"Sisters? Emmy already said last night she's done with the Johnson family.What makes you think you deserve her forgiveness? You took her parents,accused her of pushing you down the stairs, and now you're pretending to apologize. You don't deserve forgiveness."

Everyone turned to see who was speaking and saw a stunning woman walking in.

Veda's face fell when she saw Calliope.

Veda's voice shook. "Calliope."

Calliope gave her a cold look. "I don't care how you date John, but you'll never be the future hostess of the Williams family. You're not worthy."

The room went silent.

Calliope rolled her eyes at Veda and walked over to Emily, linking arms with her. She noticed some red marks on Emily's neck and sighed inwardly. Even though she knew John wasn't good enough for Emily,seeing her with other men still stung.

"Emmy, don't let Veda's words trouble you. I won't let you suffer."

"Thanks, Mom."

The fact that Calliope could just walk into the Golden Birch Group and her stylish outfit suggested she wasn't just anyone. And Emily calling her mom? Even Veda seemed to hold back in front of her.

This was getting weird.

Noticing their puzzled expressions. Calliope said, "I'm John's mother."

Everyone was even more confused. Calliope was John's mom, the head of the Williams family, yet she was openly dismissing Veda and letting Emily call her mom, looking at Emily with affection.

Just then, the head of the design department came over and said, "Mrs.Williams, the documents you requested are ready."

She shot Veda a cold look.

Calliope took the documents, her smile icy. "The design draft Veda submitted to Golden Birch was actually stolen from our Williams Group.Her work is ninety percent identical to ours."

Fear flashed in Veda's eyes.

The onlookers' gazes turned cold. Plagiarism was a serious offense in the design world.

The head of the design department had received a call from James early that morning, instructing her to investigate thoroughly.

James's tone had been intimidating.

He had asked, "Is the Golden Birch Group planning to plagiarize the Williams Group's jewelry designs in the future?"

The head of the design department had been sweating nervously. She had initially thought Veda's design was good and wanted to promote her.Luckily, none of that had started yet. She even felt a sense of relief.

She spoke up, "Mrs. Williams, we deeply apologize for this. We will provide appropriate compensation and dismiss Veda."

Veda's face changed. Everyone was whispering, making her feel utterly humiliated.


"I can't believe Veda's supposedly great work was actually plagiarized."

"No wonder we haven't seen her with a drawing board lately. Turns out she can't design at all. How embarrassing."

Veda stood there, tears in her eyes. She really needed this job.

She said. "Calliope, you can't do this to me."
###Chapter 69

Last time the Skyline Club's expenses went through the roof, John dipped into the company account to cover it. Wilder caught on fast and yanked John's permissions right away.

The Johnson family hadn't given Veda any money in ages, and she wasn't about to go begging. She'd been burning through her own savings lately.

But Veda had a taste for the high life, and now John definitely wasn't going to fork over any more cash.

Plus, working at Golden Birch Group was a big deal. As long as she was still there, John might keep an eye on her.

Calliope ignored Veda and turned to the design director, saying, "Using plagiarized work is bad forGolden Birch Group's rep too, right?"

The director quickly agreed, "Absolutely. Our branch company,Quigr Jewelry,values patents and hates plagiarism."

Then he looked at Veda and said coldly, "Submit your resignation to HR yourself. It'll save everyone some face."

Veda bit her lip, her nails digging into her palms.

Everyone went from praising her to keeping their distance.

"She's bad luck as a colleague."

"She was always asking about Mr. Smith. Bet she was trying to seduce him.



Veda knew she couldn't stay. Her pride wouldn't let her be scrutinized, so

she headed straight to HR.

After Veda left. Calliope linked arms with Emily and said, "Let's go see Mr.Smith. I told him yesterday I wanted to give him a gift."

Emily hesitated. She wanted to explain that she and James weren't serious,but Calliope probably wouldn't believe her, so she letit go.

In the CEO's office, Ryan invited them in. When Calliope saw James at his desk, she whispered to Emily, "You've got good taste. I was glad when you dumped John. Why let a jerk control you?"

She added, "You should date more. Even if it doesn't go anywhere, at least you'll have some fun. And with Mr. Smith's figure and looks, being his girlfriend is not a bad deal at all."

Given the huge difference between Emily and James, Calliope didn't think they'd end up married. The power struggles in families like the Smiths were intense.

Calliope hoped Emily would steer clear of that mess.

Emily almost laughed at the last part. She was definitely drawn to James'looks.


After finishing his work, James looked at them and showed a lot of respect to Calliope, especially since Emily cared about her.

He poured tea for Calliope and handed it to her. Her hand trembled slightly as she took it.

James smiled and hugged Emily, whisperingin her ear, "Have you been to the design department?"
	

"You're doing this on purpose," Emily replied.

Without James' permission, Calliope wouldn't have gotten into the design department.


James smiled and sat on the sofa with Emily in his arms. When Emily saw Calliope staring, she quickly pushed James away and sat up straight.

Calliope cleared her throat. Seeing Emily and James together made her a bit envious-they looked like the perfect couple.

"Mr. Smith, here's a gift for you. I heard Mrs. Amelia Smith loves antiques,so we got this antique brooch for her. You can just have someone pick it up with this claim ticket."

Since the brooch was delicate, Calliope figured it was better for James to handle it.


She mainly came today to get Veda out of Golden Birch Group. As long as Veda was around, Emily would be miserable.

After a moment, Calliope added, "Mr. Smith, when you have time, come to the Williams Mansion for dinner. You two are dating, and Emmy's dad and grandpa want to meet you."

James nodded, his tone slighty accusatory. "If Emmy takes me, I'll go."

Emily felt a bit guilty. She glanced at James and sighed.

Seeing their cuddly behavior, Calliope hastily thought of a reason to take her leave.


As soon as-she was gone, James pulled Emily close,raising an eyebrow and kissing her deeply.

When Emily was out of breath, he whispered,"When am I going to meet your dad and grandpa? Am I not good enough?"

Emily caught her breath and said, "James, isn't it a bit early for you to come home for dinner? Didn't you notice? My mom's hands were shaking when she took the tea from you."

James squinted, biting her lip almost hard enough to draw blood.Emily winced, snapping back to reality.

"James!"

Emily pushed him away, her eyes misty. James's affection was purely physical; he just wanted to touch and kiss her.

He pressed her head towards his again, kissing her deeply, teasing her tongue,lightly biting, deepening the kiss.

Even through their clothes, they could feel each other's heat, intense and passionate.

Emily felt him pressing against her. They had been together all night, but he was ready again.

Emily tried to pull away, but James held her legs, his gaze intense.

Emily took a deep breath, knowing what his look meant, but in his office,she was hesitant.

James's fingers brushed her lips, and he whispered hoarsely in her ear,"Emmy,just once,okay?"

Whenever he called her Emmy, it was never a good sign.

Rolling her eyes, Emily tried to escape, but James caught her, wrapping an

arm around her waist, his fingers exploring under her shirt, teasing her.

His hot kisses trailed down her earlobes and neck, making her shiver.

"Don't tease me anymore. I'll do it."

Emily knelt in front of him, undoing his belt, and his huge erection sprang out, making her eyes widen.

It was her first time taking him into her mouth, and James pressed her head with his fingers.


Her warm, wet tongue and the coolness in her eyes, stubborn yet hazy,made James lose himself. He wanted to drown in this tenderness.
###Chapter 70

After wrapping things up, Emily headed to the restroom in the darkroom to freshen up.

As she brushed her teeth, she thought, 'Why didn't I just bite off his penis earlier?'


Her mouth was wide open the whole time, making her feel pretty uncomfortable.


After moving around for a bit, she came out to find James sitting neatly at his desk.


Feeling a bit annoyed, she snorted, gritted her teeth, and said, "James,you better not overindulge in lust, or you might find yourself unable to perform at a young age."

James gave her a half-smile and said, "Emmy, don't worry about me. But since you're so tired,why don't you take a break?"

James casually put his arm around her waist, letting her sit on his lap,and gently kissed her lips. "It's still a while before we get off work. Have some leisure time here and wait for me.Okay,hon?"

As Emily got closer to James, she noticed he was in an online meeting.With the microphone open, everything they just said must have been heard by the people on the other end.

Emily blushed instantly, feeling super uncomfortable. This was way too embarrassing!

She quickly pushed James away, feeling flustered and a bit stuttering, "I came here for something important. You, you should focus on your work

first."

Emily covered her face and ran to the sofa. But she only felt embarrassed for a few seconds before naturally picking up the snacks on the coffee table and started munching.

It looked like the coffee table in the office had recently been stocked with snacks, which wasn't the case before.

Today's meeting was the shareholders' meeting of the Golden Birch Group,the microphone connecting all the senior executives of the subsidiaries and the headquarters, nearly a thousand people.

Every word they said was heard by everyone. This must be James's rumored girlfriend.

James was old enough to have a relationship, but it was shocking to see their decisve CEO speaking with a hint of coquetry.

It was going to be a long meeting, and Emily was bored in the office, so she left. But she didn't expect to run into Veda, who was looking for James.

Veda was holding a box in her hand. When she saw Emily coming out,she couldn't help but feel jealous of James's indulgence and care for her.

Why is it that Emily can effortlessly obtain and discard what I struggles to even reach, despite my best efforts?' she seethed with resentment,voicing her frustrations only to herself.

Gritting her teeth, Veda took a deep breath and said, "Emily, are you happy to see me like this?"

Emily smiled sarcastically. Veda was always good at disguising herself,playing the victim, and complaining first. She was just so hypocritical and

disgusting.

Emily's tone was cold. "Veda, you brought this upon yourself."

Tears instantly welled up in Veda's eyes. In the Johnsonfamily,when Veda cried. Emily would become the one who did something wrong. But outside, no one would believe Veda's tears.


Choking back tears, Veda said, "I did all this just hoping that you and John would divorce, because I don't want to be a third party. You have everything,so why can't you pity me? If it weren't for the fear of my child being illegitimate,how could I..."

Veda quickly shut her mouth. Those hidden thoughts were easy to blurt out when she was hotheaded.


Emily stared at her, knowing those were just crocodile tears. She said disdainfully, "Even if your kid is still in your belly, it's an illegitimate child because of you and the despicable things you did."

"Ultímately, you're not much better than Isolde. Both of you are selfish and greedy. It's probably for the best that the kid is gone, so it doesn't have to face a mother like you."

Besides, the child was lost because Veda jumped from the balcony herself.From the beginning, Veda didn't like the child, because no momn would use her unborn kid as a bargaining chip.

It was just malicious. Emily had never thought highly of Veda.

Veda touched her belly. "You're wrong, Emily. I will never treat my child like Isolde did. I will definitely get pregnant again and make John change his mind. Emily, you have no idea how much I love him."

Eager to show her true feelings, Veda's eyes widened.

At this, Emily's smile deepened, with a hint of cunning. "I don't care how much you love him. I have no relationship with John anymore. You should go to him to show your true feelings."

Sensing something amiss, Veda asked, "What do you mean you have no relationship anymore?"

Emily smiled, and Veda finally noticed her expression,feeling uneasy.Having lived with Emily for over a decade, Veda knew that every time Emily smiled like that, she was up to something.

Then she heard Emily's voice. "Veda, to be honest, you're quite pitiful.After all, John and I never got married, and we don't have a certificate."

Veda's pupils dilated, and her body stiffened.

Emily continued, "You know why John never told you the truth? If he truly loved you, he should have married you three years ago."

She added, "You went through so much trouble to get pregnant, bore the stigma of being a mistress, but John never considered you."

Veda's brain buzzed and she stumbled for a moment. Emotions surged,creating a storm inside her.

But when Emily said those words, she seemed casual, as if gossiping with a good friend.

Emily said, "I don't know what it means to love someone, but if he's keeping things from you, then he definitely doesn't love you."

Emily bent down slightly, her gaze coldly fixed on Veda, her tone light."

Veda, you're so pitiful."

With that. Emily left in her high heels. Her gentle words were like knives,cutting deep.

The box in Veda's hands fell to the ground, her breathing quickened,and she could barely stand.


Why weren't they legally married, and why did John hide it for so long?Did John think that only Emily was worthy of being his wife?

A chill ran through Veda's heart. But soon, Veda realized something even more serious.


She had given John a divorce agreement yesterday. But if their marriage didn't even exist, there was no need to sign adivorce agreement.


Emily had set a trap for her from the beginning! And she had fallen for it eagerly!


No wonder John slapped her. At the moment she brought out the divorce agreement, John knew that she was lying to him.

Veda felt like she was in an ice cellar, shivering all over.

How could she make amends? Would John still believe her?

At that mnoment,fear clutched at her heart.
###Chapter 71

It was already evening when James finally wrapped up the meeting.Emily had come back too, and James decided to take her to the biggest mall in Emerald City for some shopping.

Emily looked at the gifts in her hands, puzzled. "Why are you buying all this stuff?"


"They'll come in handy when we meet your parents."

Emily was confused. James paused for a moment, his eyes on her. "Your mom came by today and asked me to visit the Williams Mansion. Did you forget?"


James sounded a bit annoyed.

That's when Emily remembered and instinctively replied, "But we're not even in a serious relationship."


James narrowed his eyes slightly, then suddenly pulled Emily into the VIP dressing room, pushing her down on the sofa. "Emmy, do I need to be in a serious relationship to meet your parents?"

He bit her lip in frustration, not giving her a chance to speak, his tongue exploring her mouth wildly.


Emily struggled to breathe. She took a few breaths and pushed him away slightly, but James didn't budge, his eyes locked on her, a mix of grievance and hope. Emily felt a bit helpless. She couldn't resist his gaze at all. Her eyes flickered as she said, "If you do me a favor, I'll let you meet my parents."

James' expression softened a bit, his hand still on her waist,keeping her from getting up. "Go on."

After speaking her mind and getting his nod, Emily sat up slightly,her eyes on him. She knew he wanted her with that look.

"Not here. The sofa might not be clean, and there could be germs. Let's go home."

James smirked. "I'm not that desperate."

Emily rolled her eyes. "James, when are you not desperate?"

James was speechless.

The next day, Emily had been in his office all morning working on design drafts.

When lunchtime rolled around, Ryan had already prepared the meal and set it neatly on the coffee table. After hesitating for a moment,he said to James, "Mr. Smith, there's something I need to tell you. Veda wanted to see you last night, but I stopped her. Today, she's insisting on meeting you and causing a scene downstairs."

Hearing Veda's name, James' eyes showed a hint of disgust. But remembering what Emily had said, he replied, "Let her in."

Emily was sitting at the coffee table, eating leisurely. She waved at James."Why don't you eat first? When she gets here, you won't have time to eat."

James walked over.

Before Veda arrived, Emily took her utensils and went back to the hidden room. She wanted to watch the drama unfold.

Veda didn't expect James to agree to see her, knowing how much he doted on Emily. She was somewhat happy.
She walked briskly to James and spoke in a righteous tone, "Mr.Smith,it was me who framed Emily yesterday. I should take responsibility for my actions. My friends were just standing up for me, so there's no need to make things difficult for them."

Early that morning, Veda had received several calls from friends who usually got along well with her.
Their families weren't as wealthy as the Johnson family, but they were better off than most.
Some were minor actors, and some were internet celebrities. They usually sucked up to Veda.

But yesterday, all their dirty laundry got aired out. Some were caught bullying classmates in school, some were gambling and in debt,and some were sleeping around for resources. Scandalous photos were everywhere.

This couldn't have all come out in one day unless someone was targeting them. Veda could only think of Emily.

But Veda knew only James had the power to pull this off, not Emily. One of Veda's friends had even said, "How could Mr. Smith do this?We were just standing up for you. But it was clearly your idea.Why are you untouched?" Indeed, there wasn't a single mention of Veda slandering Emily online. Veda never thought it was because Aiden didn't want the scandal to spread.
James listened quietly,raising an eyebrow, guessing Emily was behind it all.
Veda, lost in her own thoughts, wondered, 'Mr. Smith's leniency towards me-does that mean he cares about me?'
If she was still special to James, she might have a chance to bounce back.
That was why Veda was determined to see James today.

She had caused a scene in the company lobby. If it were anyone else,security would have kicked them out, but James didn't do that to her. So she felt somewhat special.
James asked calmly, "Are you seeking justice for your friends?"

Veda looked righteous. "Yes, if you're angry for Emily, target me. Don't go after my friends. It's low."

James looked at her sharply. Veda felt a bit scared, her heart tightening,but she couldn't back down now.

Given his upbringing in the Smith family, she thought James was probably always surrounded by deceit, making pure emotions hard to come by.

Her recent actions, at the very least, had demonstrated her loyalty and sense of responsibility, likely leading James to value her.

Sure enough, James praised her nonchalantly, "Seems like you really cherish close bonds." Then he added, "But why don't you care about your own parents?" Veda was stunned, her expression freezing. She didn't expect James to bring up Isolde and Lucas.

Their faces were etched in Veda's mind. She didn't even want to think about them.

Veda thought James wouldn't mention them without a reason,and it must be Emily trying to tarnish her image in James's eyes. How could she be so malicious!

Veda completely forgot about James's affection for Emily, and she was now even angrier. "It was Emily who told you, right? She's always been jealous of me since we were kids, always slandering me. Mr. Smith, you can't believe her."

James looked at her coldly, almost laughing. He never thought someone could be this shameless. Today was truly an eye-opener.

James lightly tapped the table with his fingertips and calmly said, "I have a document and a video for you to see."

He handed the document to Veda.

When Veda saw the remittance records, her eyes widened in shock.
###Chapter 72

Veda was freaking out. The video left her totally shocked.

In the clip, she was sitting with Isolde. You couldn't hear what they were saying, but it showed her handing Isolde a bank card!

From that moment on, she started giving Isolde money every month with that card.

James gave her a cold stare and said, "From what I know, you've been giving Isolde money every month for years."

Veda was at a loss for words, feeling guilty. She had kept this secret from everyone, including Aiden and Mlia.

She started giving money to Isolde three years ago, after Mia was taken away by the Mellon Family from the Starry Capital for some investigation.

When Mia came back, she was a mess, having nightmares and calling out Emily's name in her sleep.

That's when Veda realized she could never replace Emily in Mia's heart.There was a huge difference between a biological and a non-biological daughter.


Veda used to just envy Emily. But from that day on, all she felt for Emily was resentment. She wvished Emily would just disappear!

But now James had stepped in, with proof of her giving money toIsolde.

Veda hesitated for a moment and then slowly said, "After all, Isolde is my biological mother. I can't just watch her struggle. What I did was just to fulfill my duty as a daughter."James responded coolly, "If that's the case, then leave the Johnson Mansion and go take care of Isolde. The Johnson Mansion isn't where you belong."

Veda's whole body stiffened and she refused without hesitation. "No way! I've been living well at the Johnson Mansion, and now that Emily cut ties with the Johnson family, I'm the only daughter left for my mom. She's not happy these days, crying all the time. I have to take care of her. Emily is unfilial, but I can't be like her."

Veda tried hard to restore her reputation in front of James.

James said flatly, "Essentially, you still can't bear to give up the luxury and wealth in the Johnson family. If you really want to be filial, then return all the money you gave to Isolde over theyears to the Johnson family,admit your mistake to Mia, and promise not to do such things again. Maybe I can cover this up."

Veda's lips trembled. She felt like she was being roasted by a fierce fire,very uncomfortable.

Veda knew that Mia despised Isolde and Lucas. After Isolde had slept with Aiden, Mia never had any intimate behavior with Aiden again.Everything she did outside was just to save face for Aiden.

If she found out that Veda had been secretly giving money to Isolde, she would definitely no longer consider Veda her daughter. When she got home last night, Mia was very cold towards her, and she couldn't stand being ignored like that. But now, James had clearly set a trap for her. She was stuck. Tears were about to fall as Veda said pitifully, "Mr. Smith, do you have to be so ruthless?" "Is it me being ruthless, or is it your greed? You know the answer."

Veda was left speechless by his harsh words. She knew she couldn't win against James, so she just nodded and left the office,feeling heavy-hearted.
After VVeda left, Emily stepped out from the hidden room. She raised an eyebrow at James, half-jokingly saying, "Why do I get the feeling Veda's got a thing for you? So, who is she really into, you or John?"

James walked over to her, wrapping his arm around her waist, and said with a hint of annoyance, "You just use me. Shouldn't you compensate me for some emotional distress?"

As he spoke, he leaned in for a kiss.

Emily pushed him away, exasperated. "Can you stop being like this every time? Is sex all you think about?"

"Well, no, I have you on my mind."


James leaned in again, his fingers slipping under the hem of her shirt and lingering on her waist. He was physically drawn to Emily, and all his desires revolved around her.

He teased her lips, not letting her pull away.


Just as things were heating up, Emily's stomach growled. "I'm hungry."

James looked at her with a mix of amusement and indulgence in his eyes Emily laughed and walked over to the coffee table. The food had cooled down a bit, but it still tasted good. James sat across from her,and they chatted while eating. Emily said, "Veda already embarrassed the Johnson family yesterday.Aiden's really pissed at her now, so the only person she can rely on is Mia.Making her confess in front of Mia is like cutting off her last lifeline."

Mia hated Isolde with a passion.

As James spoke, he peeled a shrimp for Emily and put it in her bowl,staring at her. "Seems like I can't afford to piss you off in the future,or I won't even know what hit me."

James then asked, "With all the dirt you had on Veda, why didn't you deal with her earlier?"

Emily looked at James. "I was busy having a secret fling with you back then,and Veda didn't publicly frame me, so I let it slide."

The main reason was that Emily and John weren't married. So Emily didn't really care whether Veda was with John or not.

But during those three years, Emily occasionally felt a pang of heartache when she thought of John.


Emily saw through Veda's vanity, so she thought of using James to make Veda let her guard down, and naturally, Veda fell into the trap.

What Emily wanted was for the Johnson family to despise Veda to the extreme.Suddenly,James grabbed Emily's hand, rubbing it in his palm, his eyes slightly intense. "You can't use these schemes on me. You have to be sincere with me." Emily blinked, then reached up to stroke James's chin,saying,"Ionly give my true feelings to pets. Mr. Smith, are you one too?" Gritting his teeth.James said,"Emily!"

Emily burst into laughter. Teasing James like this was always so much fun.

Emily had planned to draw design sketches in his office and give them to him directly, then head back to the company in the afternoon. But she didn't expect James to have such good stamina.

He didn't stop making love for a moment in thos
###Chapter 73

Emily found herself pressed up against the massive glass window by James,her breasts squished flat against the cool surface.
His fingers, hot and teasing, brushed against her most sensitive spot,sending little jolts of pleasure through her.
She'd already climaxed three times, and her body was hypersensitive. As he kissed her back, a few damp strands of her hair clung to her face.tickling her slightly.
Emily tilted her head back,breathing heavily, her hot breath fogging up the glass. James reached out, hooking her rosy tongue with his fingers,slippng them into her mouth in a way that was both teasing and seductive.

Her cheeks flushed a deep red. She couldn't help but squeeze her legs together,feeling a wetness growing between them. James's erection inside her was still hardening, his fingers playing at the junction of their bodies,occasionally brushing her clit and making her shiver.

He whispered sweet nothings in herear,but Emily couldn't focus. She was more worried about being seen by someone outsde.

Even though she knew it was one-way glass, it still felt weird.

James lifted her head, turning her face to kiss her deeply, his hand roaming over her soft skin.

Emily let out a soft moan, her eyes filled with desire. Only he could see her like this.

James thrust his hips, feeling her tightness around him. Her submissive, alluring look only fueled his desire.

He pressed her harder against the glass, thrusting eagerly.

"Emmy, does it feel good? I'm asking you a question. Why aren't you talking?"

Emily, not one to back down, bit his lip and teased,"Is that all? Seems like you're still too young."

James grabbed her breasts, thrusting deeper in response to her taunt.

Emily's face twisted in pleasure.

James turned her around,lifting her up by her buttocks.

In this position, he penetrated even deeper, making her eyes glaze over with pleasure. She was on the verge of tears from the intensity, her voice soft and pitiful.

Just as they were lost in their passion, Ryan's voice came from outside."Mr.Smith, the meeting is in half an hour. Are you ready?"

Ryan's voice had a nervous edge, probably aware of what was happening inside but too scared to interrupt. But James couldn't afford to be late for this important meeting.

Emily,worried Ryan might walk in, snuggled closer to James and bit his nipple in retaliation. James growled, shoutingat the door,"Get lost." Ryan figured James had got the message. James thrust harder, their fluids dripping to the floor,sending waves of pleasure through Emily's trembling body.

Her body shook uncontrollably from the intense mix of pleasure and tension, and James's eyes got red with intense passion from her pressure on his erection.

"Emmy, don't worry; he won't come in. We've still got half an hour."

Emily rolled her eyes. They'd been going at it for over two hours.

James's voice, low and husky, was dripping with desire. "Next time,let's do it somewhere crowded, or maybe at the Williams Mansion. You always get so tight when there are people around..."

Emily thought, 'If it weren't for your handsome face, I'd really punch you.'

Her ears turned red, her full breasts swaying seductively.

James's lips, crimson with passion, nibbled on her flushed earlobe.

His breath grew ragged as he placed her on the desk, thrusting vigorously.He whispered hoarsely in her ear, "Imagine if John were outside listening..
11

Her cheeks flushed bright red, but her body quickly reached climax under his thrusts, trembling uncontrollably. Her wet, hot core clenched tightly,and James's hoarse gasps grew heavier,his warm release filling her deeply. pleasure through Emily's trembling body.

Her cheeks flushed bright red, but her body quickly reached climax under his thrusts, trembling uncontrollably. Her wet, hot core clenched tightly,and James's hoarse gasps grew heavier,his warm release filling her deeply. After he came, he didn't pull out right away. Instead, he gently caressed her,cherishing her body. Emily leaned softly against his chest, her delicate features radiating a tender and sultry glow from their lovemaking. She felt James's slender fingers gently stroking her skin, his lips dropping light kisses one by one.

She lazily turned her gaze to his eyes, deep and gentle.

Emily slowly hugged him. "I'm tired. Take me to the bathroom; I need a bath and some sleep."

James gave her a deep kiss and led her to the hidden room.

He still had a meeting to attend, so he only had time to fill the tub with warm water for her, whispering softly, "I'll call you in fifteen minutes.Don't fall asleep in there."

Emily responded with a seductive and captivating agreement. James didn't feel like working anymore.

Emily didn't return to her company in the afternoon. Exhausted, she slept until six o'clock and woke up to the sound of James scolding someone outside.

When the voices outside quieted down, Emily pushed the door open and found James dealing with documents.

She picked up his coffee and took a sip, saying, "I've already told my parents we'll be going back tonight. If you're not done yet, I can postpone for a few days."


The bitter coffee instantly eased Emily's tension. James slowly looked up. "I'm done. Let's go now." At seven o'clock, they arrived at the Williams Mansion. Entering the courtyard, no one had come out to greet them yet, so James went to open the trunk first. It was then that Emily noticed the huge trunk was packed full.

"Did you buy too much stuff?"

James smiled faintly. "It's my first time mneeting your parents. I have to make a good impression."

He added, "The reviews of me in Starry Capital probably aren't very flattering."

Emily thought for a moment and said seriously, "Decisive, indifferent to women, ruthless, cold-hearted. Hmm... that does sound a bit harsh, doesn't it?"

James pouted."Emily!"

She reached out and touched his head, soothing his emotions.

She thought, 'If James were as easy to talk to and as obedient in bed,my back wouldn't hurt every time after we were done!'
###Chapter 74

Calliope was the first to step out. When she spotted Emily, she beamed and said, "Emmy, there you are."

"Mom." Emily walked up and naturally hooked her arm,leaning in close.

Calliope had always worried that John might cause a rift between them and Emily. But now, it seemed she had worried for nothing.

Calliope gently patted her head and noticed the hair clip she had given Emily, lazily pinned in her hair. It made her smile even wider.

"Mr. Smith, it's so good to have you here.Please,come in."

James said. "Just call me James."

Being called Mr. Smith felt too formal and a bit awkward.

He handed Calliope a card. "This is a VIP membership card for Golden Birch Group's spa services. Feel free to use it at any of our location. But honestly, your skin is already looking fantastic, so a spa visit would just be the icing on the cake."

That last bit made Calliope really happy.


Emily looked at James, surprised, her eyes saying,'Are you the same James I know? ###Chapter 74

That last bit made Calliope really happy.


Emily looked at James, surprised, her eyes saying,'Are you the same James I know?The way he was buttering up Calliope was something else. Calliope knew about the spas. The Golden Birch Group had tons of top global brands, and their spa was the most famous. These spas weren't for just anyone. They had the world's top medical team, known for effective scar removal and skin tightening. Calliope had been invited by a wealthy friend once and spent a day there.
For quite a while after that, she felt physically refreshed, slept soundly at night, and her complexion improved a lot. But without a membership,she couldn't go back. Now she could go for free,which was a nice surprise.

Calliope asked, "Can I bring my friends?"

James smiled humbly. "Of course."

Calliope was thrilled. Emily hugged her arm tighter and coughed softly,"Mom,calm down."

Calliope tried to compose herself. As Emily's family, she had to stay cool and not act like she had never experienced anything. She quickly invited James in.


Wilder and Hayden were sitting in the living room, both looking serious.

Juliet Williams, John's sister, had just gotten back from school.When she saw Emily, she rushed over and hugged her tightly.


James brought gifts for everyone. He gave Wilder two large boxes of coffee with twenty different varieties. Wilder just glanced at it and felt a bit overwhelmed.


This must have cost a fortune. How could he afford all this?

Wilder looked at James's gifts and didn't dare show any displeasure.

Accepting Emily as his daughter was one thing, but her bringing back a son-in-law in less than two months was a lot to take in. This change wvas really hard for him to process. Hayden liked chess, so James got him a ruby chessboard,which looked pretty valuable,making Hayden grin from ear to ear.
Hayden asked, "James, do you play chess? How about a game later?"

"My skills aren't great, so please go easy on me."

Emily looked at James, hersmile growing wider.

Before James could even mention her gift, Juliet was already there with a gleam in her eye, asking, "James, as my brother-in-law, do you have a gift for me?"


She tried to keep her cool, but her eyes gave her away. She blinked eagerly.

James was a bit surprised but pleased with how she addressed him."Of course, I have something for you too. This is a VIP front row box ticket for Carlton Griffin's concert."


Juliet took the ticket and squealed. She jumped up, hugged Emily,and kissed her cheek. "Emily, James is awesome!"

Juliet had been trying to get that ticket for ages but had no luck. Not getting it had almost driven her nuts.


James smiled warmly. "I'll connect you with Carlton on Facebook."

For a second, Juliet thought she was hearing things.

But when the Williams family processed what Juliet said, their expressions shifted a bit.

Calliope nervously pulled Juliet, who was busy exchanging Facebook info with James, and whispered in her ear, "Don't speak out of turn. They're just dating right now." Juliet was always carefree and really admired Emily for being straightforward and honest, always standing up for herself. Emily never held back her words or actions.

The two had been close since they were kids, so Juliet quickly accepted Emily as her sister. And she thought it was pretty cool.

Juliet was a bit taken aback by the scolding but quickly smiled. "I think James is serious, and he's not a stingy guy, right?"

Emily sighed and rubbed her forehead.

James smiled, not offended at all. He looked at Emily with a hint of pride,as if to say,'See how sensitive and tactful Juliet is!'

Calliope thought about how they weren't married yet, and with such a big gap in their backgrounds, who knew if they'd last. If the Williams took too many perks from James now, Emily might find it hard to hold her head high around him later.

Actually, Calliope was a bit swayed too. Having a son-in-law felt pretty good. She was happy for Emily but also a bit worried.

But when she thought about the dumb things John had done, Calliope felt it was okay for Emily to date James. At least James could protect her.

Emily had been through a lot, and Calliope hoped her future would be smooth sailing. Before dinner was ready, James and Hayden were playing chess.James lost the first game, making Hayden grin. In the second game, James lost again. Emily just glanced at him,thinking James was so sly. He could easily beat Hayden, but he subtly let him win.

Hayden couldn't tell. James's chess skills were pretty complex.

During dinner, Hayden kept praising James. He couldn't stop smniling.

Juliet kept asking Emily, "Emily, when are you getting married?"

Emily poked her forehead and asked, "Did Carlton accept your friend request?"

Juliet's lips curled up. "He did, and we just chatted. I'm so happy.He's my idol!"

The family was having a great time at dinner, and Wilder even had a drink with James.

Then John came back.
###Chapter 75

John was totally wasted.

He stumbled into the dining room and saw a bunch of people,including Emily, which didn't shock him. But then he spotted James.

John's anger bubbled up like a volcano, and he snapped, "Why the hell is James here? How could he eat in our house?"

Emily and James were sitting close, and no one seemed to think it was weird!

John's chest tightened, making it hard to breathe.

He skipped the office today. Instead, he hit up a bar with friends, drank all day. and vented non-stop.

One of his friends, rolling his eyes, finally said, "You picked someone else when you got married. Now Emily's got a boyfriend, so why are you whining? You had your fun, and now you want to change your mind?Why should Emily wait around for you?"

He added. "John, do you think you're all that? You lean on the Williams family, never on yourself. But look at Emily's new guy,he's got you beat in every way."


He went on, "You used to act like a jerk because she liked you and would wait. Now that Emily's got a better option, you're pissed. You're just asking for in"

John couldn't argue back,and even breathing hurt.

His phone had been off all day. When he turned it on, there were only calls and messages from Veda.

For a moment, John felt abandoned by the whole world. This helplessness was now overwhelming.

His grandpa admired James a lot, always smiling at him.

His dad, usually cold and distant, was actually toasting with James.

Emily leaned on James, seemingly urging him to drink.

Juliet was glued to her phone, not noticing anything.

No one paid any attention to him.

Juliet didn't even notice Johnhad come back. She suddenly exclaimed,"James, Carlton invited me to hang out! From today on, you're my brother-in-law!"

Hearing that. John felt a chill run through his body,freezing his blood.

John's voice was hoarse. "Juliet! Who's your brother-in-law?"

She immediately replied, "Of course,it's Mr.James Smith."

Juliet rolled her eyes, looked up at John, and said in exasperation,"You're not married to Emily, so why are you upset? What right do you have to be angry? I really don't get you." Juliet thought John was being pretentious. She hated that kind of person the most. John, usually calm and composed, was a mess for the first time. Seeing John like this, Calliope felt a bit sorry for him. But since things had come to this, it would be more gracious of himto let go.

He was just making a fool of himself for no reason.

Since coming back from abroad, John had been living alone with Veda.

Calliope asked, "Why did you suddenly come back?"

John couldn't get mad at Calliope, so he just held it in.

Calliope asked him to sit down and eat. After John sat down, the atmosphere at the dining table instantly changed.

John was stuck at the end of the table, far from Emily, with someone else between them. Meanwhile, James was sitting next to Wilder, in a more prominent spot.

He felt super uncomfortable, itching to let it all out.

Calliope glanced at him, sighed, and said, "Just eat your meal first. I'll have someone make you some ginger tea."

John looked at Emily. "You go make it for me."

Emily put down her utensils and snapped, "John, are you nuts? Make it yourself." Back when they were dating, Emily would always make him ginger tea whenever he got drunk. Her ginger tea was special, with a faint medicinal scent and a refreshing hint of oranges. But now, she wouldn't do it for him anymore. James held Emily's hand, his gaze coldly fixed on John. James's commanding presence and the way he clung to Emily really choked John up.

Hating this feeling, he slammed his utensils down and stormed upstairs,with Hayden's scolding voice trailing behind him.

Everyone kept eating, but the mood was ruined. Only Juliet seemed excited.

John took a shower, changed his clothes, and came back down. He looked refreshed,but the weariness and gloom were still there.

He watched Emily and James chatting and laughing, feeling a whirlwind of emotions.

Seeing his expression, Hayden added fuel to the fire. "Now Emmy and James are in love, so drop the self-important attitude. You're not worthy Emmy's attention anymore since you chose Veda. We don't care about your relationship with Veda now, but just don't disturb Emmy anymore."

He added. "And, James is now working with our company. As an adult,you should know when to hold on and when to let go."

Hayden's words made sense, but John couldn't hear them.

James chimed in, "Mr. Hayden Williams, you're too kind. Golden Birch Group also values Diamond Glow's design. It's a win-win cooperation."

Hayden was pleased with his words. And James spoke respectfully,making Hayden even happier. Emily,feeling a bit helpless, glanced at James and flirtatiously whispered in his ear,"You're a master of swweet talk. Why don't you say sweet things in bed?" James openly kissed her cheek. "Ill whisper all those you want to hear... in the moment."

Emily blushed. She shouldn't have teased him, forgetting that James was a bit cheeky.

Everyone was laughing, and John was completely ignored.

Then John's untimely voice rang out. "Although Diamond Glow's current sales aren't great, it's not at the point of selling Emily out to boost our numbers."

Hayden slammed the table in anger. "You jerk."

With just one sentence, John erased all of Emily's efforts. He blatantly implied that Emily succeeded by seducing James with her looks.

John was quite upset now. They could all get along well with James,ignoring that Emily was supposed to be his wife. Did they ever consider his feeling while doing so?.

John's words became more and more outrageous. "Am I wrong? Emily went to James, who agreed to cooperate without a second thought. How could the deal have been made without resorting to seduction? I don't need to boost Diamond Glow by trading on a woman."
###Chapter 76

As soon as John dropped those words, the room went dead silent.Everyone looked stunned, not quite getting how John could say something like that.

Calliope used to think John was under Veda's spell, but now she was starting to feel like she hadn't raised him right.

Feeling a mix of heartbreak and anger, Calliope slapped John hard.


Calliope always tried to keep up a good image in front of others,but today she just couldn't hold it in. The slap was heavy, leaving her palm red and her body shaking.

Calliope spoke slowly and deliberately, "How could I have a son like you?You defamed Emmy. Empty words carry no weight. You grew up together;don't you know what kind of person she is?"

Struggling to stay steady by leaning on the table, Calliope started to cry.

John tightened his lips, his face stinging with pain. That slap felt like a punch to his heart. He knew he was wrong, but he didn't want to admit it.

With the last bit of his pride, he didn't want to lose face in front of Emily and James.

John pursed his lips, feeling a strong dryness in his throat, and finally said,"Mom, I broke up with Veda and can be with Emily again." Emily's face darkened as she glanced at the wine glass beside her. Unable to hold back, she splashed the wine on John's face. "John, you're such a hypocrite!" In front of the Williams family, Emily didn't want to be too harsh with her words. She stood up, took James's hand, and said to the others, "Grandpa,Mom,Dad,we're leaving now."

In a daze, Calliope quickly grabbed her hand and choked out,"Emmy,wait,I have something for you."

She took Emily upstairs,leaving James waiting outside.

John sat in the living room for a while, but no one wanted to talk to him.He thought of something and went outside.

The garden was full of colorful and fragrant flowers planted by Emily before.

James stood in front of an orchid, his slender fingertips gently playing with it, making him look extremely noble.

John rarely felt a sense of inferiority. In front of James, John didn't stand a chance of winning Emily back.

James saw him coming from the corner of his eye, his gaze deep and distant. He stood there like a god looking down on all beings.

"Mr. Williams, what's up?" John pressed on with his words, "We didn't get the certificate back then due to a misunderstanding. As long as I make it clear, Emmy will definitely choose me."

James's expression turned colder, and he said icily, "Mr. Williams,you seem to think too highly of yourself. Since you gave up on Emmy back then,she won't choose you now. You should understand Emmy's character."

John's fists clenched instantly.

"Mr.Smith, marriage certificate don't mean a thing. In my heart,Emily and I are married. She must feel the same way, or she wouldn't have waited for me for three years!"

A sharp glint flashed in James's eyes. At the start, Emily did tell him she cared a lot about John and their friendship, and that she had been waiting for John to come back.

James's gaze turned a bit sharper, but he kept a casual expression."She's been with me for these three years."

John's composure cracked a bit. His expression turned cold as he said directly, "I still love her, and I won't give up on her. There are plenty of women after you. Why bother competing with me? I hope you won't interfere in my relationship with Emmy. I'll spend my whole life making it up to her," James was furious at his confidence. "John, you're both foolish and arrogant. A few words from others made you doubt the feelings between you two for over a decade. And now you claim you love her? Mrs.Williams was right. Why do you think Emmy will always wait for you?Why do you think I'm not indispensable to Emily?" The autumn evening breeze carried a chill that slowly seeped into John's bones, making his body stiffen. James was serious about Emily!

Meanwhile, Emily was led by Calliope to the study, where she opened a safe.


Emily was a bit puzzled. She was already wearing the Williams family's heirloom jewelry and didn't expect anything more.

The Williams family had been too kind to her, and she felt pressured.

Calliope took out a red velvet box from the safe; inside was a necklace.

Calliope handed it directly to Emily and said, "I heard that this necklace was given by a mysterious person on the day of the party after I picked you up, and that person said he was from the Patterson family, and I thought about it, and it was only the Patterson family of Starry Capital."

This necklace was not particularly valuable to them. The valuable thing was that the necklace had the Patterson family's family pattern, which was only a serious super rich family that had existed for hundreds of years.

She continued, "Mia didn't intend to give it to you; she wanted to give it to Veda. I had a word with her, so she had no choice but to give you this necklace. I've kept it in the safe ever since."

Mia had always been biased. No matter what good things come along.Veda is always the first on her mind. Calliope couldn't stand it. The necklace wasn't particularly valuable to them, but the emblem of the Mellon family on it was significant. Only a true super elite family that had existed for over a hundred years would have such an emblem. How could this not be considered a stroke of luck? Emily examined the necklace for a while. The intricate emblem looked very profound.

Moreover, the necklace seemed to be a pair, but no one knew where the other half was.

Mia probably wasn't interested in the necklace itself, but in the emblem.

Emily hesitated.

But Calliope said, "I didn't plan to give this to you so soon,but Mia has been hinting about this necklace for the past few days. Take it; it's yours."
###Chapter 77

Calliope kept going, "Besides, Mia let it slip that this necklace is like an engagement token. She hinted that since you already have a boyfriend,it should go to Veda."

Calliope rolled her eyes. "I wanted to give her a piece of my mind right then. Your stuff should never go to Veda."

Emily smiled and squeezed Calliope's hand. "Thanks, Mom."

Calliope smiled back and said softly, "You're just too nice, always putting up with them. That's why they keep pushing you around. You need to stand your ground like you used to. Then they wouldn't dare mess with your things."

Emily tucked the amulet away and said, "Alright, from now on,nothing goes to Veda!"

Hearing Emily's words, Calliope finally felt at ease. "I'm always worried about you getting taken advantage of. Luckily, you spent most of your time at the Williams Mansion and didn't have to deal with too much crap."

Emily was grateful too. Even though her life before 12 was rough,things got better with the Williams family.

Sure,John was a bit much after they got married, but the Williams family made up for it. Emily felt the love from Calliope and Wilder, and the sisterly bond with Juliet, so she didn't think her life was all that bad. As Emily walked out of the mansion, she saw John and James squaring off in the courtyard.  James spotted her and his expression softened.

Emily walked right past John to James, naturally taking his arm and smiling. "James,what were you two talking about?"

She looked up at James.her eyes gentle. At that moment, her serene beauty outshone everything around them. Jealousy flared in John's heart.

James's gaze softened as he looked at Emily, and he said gently,"Nothing important.let's go."

Emily smiled. They turned to leave, and James shot a challenging look at John. "Mr. Williams,see you around."

Watching them walk away happily, John's heart ached.

He didn't know when it happened, but he realized there was no place for him in Emily's heart anymore.

John quickly caught up and grabbed Emily's arm, pulling her back forcefully.

When Emily and James were dancing at her birthday party, and when they were sitting together in the mansion, John wanted to separate them.

Still a bit drunk. John spoke with a hint of authority, "Emily, you can't..."

Before he could finish, Emily flipped him over her shoulder to the ground.

A sharp pain shot through him, and John could barely hold back the throbbing pain.

This was the second time Emily had hit him, and it hurt more than the last time. Emily's actions happened in a flash. James stood by her side, stunned and unable to react.


Emily was like a thorny rose, beautiful but painful to touch.

This throw was filled with anger and resentment, as if she wanted to pay John back for all the grievances of the past three years.

Emily turned around, looking down at him coldly. "Didn't I make myself clear? If you touch me again, I won't hesitate to take you down."

Then she just grabbed James and left.

On the way back, James was in a foul mood.

When they got to Crystal Valley Manor, James kissed her without hesitation, biting her with anger and as a form of punishment.

Emily was pinned down on the sofa by him, her gaze clear because she knew James was punishing her, not being affectionate.

Emily pinched his earlobe and asked, "James, what's got you so worked up?"


In the car, Emily had been busy replying to work messages and dealing with Juliet's update about John's sprained ankle.

It wasn't until they got back to Crystal Valley Manor that Emily noticed James's cold attitude.


James gritted his teeth. "Emily, why can't you just comfort me?"

Emily sighed, sat up, pinched his face, licked her bitten lips, and said, "Look at what you did to my mouth. And you still want comfot? Besides,weren't you having a good time at the Williams Mansion today? I thought you got along with my parents. Planning to call them mom and dad next?"

James's eyes flickered with guilt but he still said confidently, "I'm upset too.Didn't you see how John provoked me?"

"I beat him up, didn't I? Do you think I went easy on him?"

Emily looked at James indulgently, then her expression turned serious. "Did you lose the argument with him just now?"

Emily took out her phone to call John, but James stopped her, puzzled. "
What are you doing?"

Emily said seriously, "I'm going to give him a piece of my mind for you."

James arrogantly replied, "I've handled it. Noneed for you to scold him."

"Then why are you angry?"

James remembered those provocative words claiming that John,having been by Emily's side for over a decade,could bring her back to him,and his mood became complicated.

Seeing his sulking face, Emily reached out and scratched his chin."Are you jealous again, my little prince?"

After much thought, Emily could only come up with this one reason.
James was just so concerned about Emily that he acted this way. But in her eyes, he came off as very immature, like a child who could be easily appeased. James lowered his head and kissed her, feeling much better. He said, "John told me that if the misunderstandings between you two were resolved, you'd go back to him. Who does he think he is? Why does he feel so superior?" James didn't feel superior to Emily. He even understood that unless he took the initiative, he and Emily would have no future.

So he was determined to keep Emily close, and anyone who coveted her was his enemy.

James said, "John is just a fool!"

Emily agreed.

James looked uncertain and asked, "Emily, you won't go back to him, will you?"

They had been intimate, but James couldn't break into Emily's heart.

Emily and John had known each other since childhood, but what was James to her?

After meeting Emily once at the age of twelve, they had no further contact.

To James, Emily was his spiritual salvation, his dream lover for nearly a decade,and a deep emotional anchor.

But Emily had long forgotten about him.
###Chapter 78

Emily flipped over and pinned James beneath her. She straddled him,pinched his cheeks, and grinned, "James, you don't need to worry. I'm done with John for good."


Hearing this, James felt a bit of relief. Sure, he might have been a little dramatic earlier, but it all came down to his insecurities.

"Emily, why can't you just introduce me as your boyfriend to everyone and give me an official title?"

Emily blinked, kissed his lips, and asked, "Why should I? Is it really that big of a deal?"

She used to be John's wife, at least in name, but that title hadn't made any difference to their relationship.

Emily kissed his Adam's apple, lightly nipping it with her teeth, and murmured, "People online say I'm lucky to have you. Isn't that enough?"

That extravagant birthday party had already announced to the elite of Emerald City that she was James's girlfriend.

So, whether she called him her boyfriend or not, it didn't really matter.

Before James could respond, Emily silenced him with a kiss.She bit his tongue and deepened the kiss slowvly.

James knew exactly what she was up to. HHe looked at her with a mix of helplessness and indulgence.

Desire sparked between them. James's fingers slipped under her clothes,cupping her breasts and teasing her nipples, making Emily shiver. Emily's delicate hand moved up his chest, yanking off his shirt.

Her hand roamed over his body, eventually reaching for his penis. James's body reacted instantly.

Emily half-undid his pants, exposing his semi-erect penis. She had already gotten a good feel for its size the last time she used her mouth on him.

After a moment's hesitation, Emily slowly wrapped her hand around it.

James's usually restrained and indifferent eyes flared with desire, and even his elegant face showed a hint of lust.

Emily's top pushed up, revealing her full breasts, marked with a hint of red.

With a seductive look, Emily glanced at James, lowered her face, and took his swollen penis into her mouth.

Usually, James was the one taking charge, but now the roles were reversed.

Emily extended her tongue, carefully teasing his reddened penis. It quickly grew thicker and harder, filling her mouth, even oozing some pre-cum.

She moved her mouth up and down, leaving a trail of saliva at the corners of her mouth.

Feeling him getting hotter, Emily spread her long legs, sat on his narrow waist,and aimed his hard manhood at her already wet vagina. But she didn't rush. Instead, she teased him, pressing her hands on James's shoulders, her brows trembling lightly, her voice coquettish. "James, do you want it?" "Emmy," James held her waist, wanting to push her down, but he played along, his usually cold voice softening. "Emmy, stop teasing. Give it tome."

After a bit more teasing, James tightened his grip on her waist,realizing she was doing it onpurpose. He slowly moved his hands to her breasts,kneading and playing with them. He couldn't hold them with just one pair of hands. She had ignited a fire in him with her teasing.

James propped himself up a bit, slowly took one of her nipples into his mouth, nibbling gently, while his hands roamed over her perky butt,squeezing until her skin was marked with red.

Emily let out a soft moan, finally stopping her teasing,and slowly lowered herself onto him.

Her tightness wrapped around his thick, hard length, making James feel a mix of pleasure and pain.

All he wanted now was to thrust deeply and fiercely. Sensing his urgency,Emily braced herself on his sides and began moving her hips up and down.

In this position, he could penetrate her deeply. After a few thrusts,she was so wet that her fluids flowed freely. Her bouncing breasts added to the provocative scene.

Emily gasped, "I can't anymore; I'm exhausted. Your turn."

Even though Emily had good stamina, she hadn't rested much all day.Now she was doing this just to please James.

For half an hour, James showed no sign of release. She gradually ran out of energy. She collapsed weakly onto James's chest, her breasts rubbing against his firm torso. Seeing his slightly parted lips, she couldn't resist kissing him again.

James's passionate kiss swallowed her moans.

When the kiss broke, James eagerly sat up, grabbed her round buttocks.and thrust his hard, hot length into her most sensitive spot.
Emily instantly lost control. James's skills in bed had always been good,and she was happy to let him take charge.

James held her slender waist and thrust forcefully. The sound of their passionate connection filled the air, Emily's face flushed, and soon she climaxed,letting out a soft mnoan.

Then,James dominated her on the sofa, one leg raised, his large length thrusting in and out of her pink corevigorously, waves of pleasure crashing over her, tears of emotion streaming down her face.

As James continued his wild thrusts, he kissed her lips.

The intense stimulation made Emily's body even softer and more emotional. When she trembled and climaxed again, James pulled out his thick, hard length and forcefully stuffed it into her mouth. In the heat of passion, James's eyes were bloodshot, but he still had some restraint. At the last second, he ejaculated on Emily's chest. Then, he kissed her passionately from her seductive lips to her delicate collarbone,and then to her enticing breasts. Emily's face was flushed,feeling a bit regretful for being too proactive. Her slender arms wrapped around his strong back, her body tense. James wasn't satisfied yet, so he picked her up and carried her upstairs.They sank into the bathtub filled with warm water and rising steam,becoming even more intoxicated.

His length once again thrust vigorously into Emily's core, reaching the deepest part.
James breathed heavily.

Emily's legs hung weakly outside the bathtub, and she pushed him away."James, that's enough. Don't overdo it; I have to work tomorrow."
But James kept her company all night.

Exhausted, Emily lay in his arms. Seeing that James still wanted to continue she rolled her eyes weakly and somewhat furiously. "Get lost!"
###Chapter 79

It was almost dawn, and Emily had only been asleep for about half an hour.


When she finally woke up, James was lying on his side, staring at her like he was trying to memorize every detail. His gaze was almost greedy, as if he was savoring the passion from last night.

Emily's skin had a soft blush, looking as delicate and beautiful as a peach.

James,who hadn't slept all night, spoke in a hoarse, magnetic voice,"I've She was surprised at his stamina. Even after a whole night, James was still hard1. He teased her with his fingers before eagerly thrusting inside. His slender fingers traced her back, gliding over her delicate waist,round  got other projects coming up. From now on, you'll hand over the drafts to the design department. I don't have that much time anymore."

When Emily found out who James really was, she knew he wasn't just looking for a partner to share the mine. There had to be more to it that kept him here.

She blinked and asked, "Are you talking about the development project in the East of the city?"

The East side had been completely demolished and was waiting on investors to kick off the project.

Instead of answering, James said, "How about we go again? Just once more.11


Before Emily could respond, he kissed her.buttocks, and down to her well-proportioned thighs.

The gentle touch made her shiver. She almost forgot about the large penis inside her.


But Emily knew that the gentler and more elegant James was, the more intense he would be in action, and she doubted if she could handle it.

She even raised her hands, ready to push him away, but James seemed to anticipate it and easily pinned her hands above her head.

James teased her desires meticulously and tenderly, taking care of every part of her body. His every kiss was hot and wet, igniting a fire within her.

Emily blushed at his teasing, gently pushed his hand away,grabbed his earlobe, and twisted it lightly, saying, "You're already inside, so stop stalling and get on with it!"

Emily sighed inwardly as her pink vagina tightly gripped his thick,hard penis.

She moaned seductively, her hands wandering over James's body. If he hurt her, she would leave scratches with her nails. Somnetimes,she would scratch hard enough to draw a few drops of blood if pushed too far..
With red eyes, James pressed her buttocks with one hand and began to thrust. His fierce and hard purple penis penetrated her tight vagina with each thrust. Emily was exhausted to the point of falling asleep. She only remembered James pulling out and then taking her to the bathroom to clean up. Her body was clean and dry now, but she felt like a wreck. Looking at herself in the mirror, Emily couldn't heIp but sigh. There seemed to be nointact part on her body. She cursed James in her heart.

She went downstairs to make herself a cup of coffee, opened her phone,and dealt with work matters first. Since she missed the morning meeting today,she called in sick leave to Wilder.

The rest of the messages were from Veda and a fewfrom John.She blocked both of their numbers.


After finishing up, Emily was about to look for something to eat in the fridge when she noticed a note stuck on it.

It was from James, and his handwriting was always so powerful and imposing.


"Food's in the microwave. Eat before you take a break."

Emily smiled a little, feeling a warm glow in her heart.

She took out the food James had prepared, and her appetite instantly kicked in.

As she ate and scrolled through her phone, she quickly stumbled upon news about Veda's birthday banquet.

The news was deliberately leaked but kept low-key, clearly a warning to Veda. It had to be James's doing. At the Golden Birch Group, James was knee-deep in thedevelopment of the land in the East of the city, planning to turn it into the largest jewelry exhibition in the country. They needed architectural designs and event organizers. There were many companies to choose from as event organizers, but in the end, only five companies were selected as candidates.

Among them, James noticed a very familiar company.

Ryan paused for a moment and said, "Mr. Smith,this CloudDream Creations was established by John when he was abroad. It's pretty impressive to reach this level in just three years."

Ryan cautiously watched James's expression. When they were selecting event organizers, James and Emily's relationship hadn't been exposed yet.At that time, Ryan knew very little about Emily's situation, only that she had a fake marriage.

He didn't pay much attention to finding out who Emily's fake husband was. Who would have thought it was John?

Moreover, these five companies had all passed the board's screening, and now they were waiting for James's final decision.

What was even more interesting was that when Golden Birch Group secured the land, they kept it confidential. As a result, the heads of these companies still didn't know that their submitted design proposals were in James's hands.

James narrowed his eyes and asked coldly, "Where's the afternoon meeting being held?" companies were selected as candidates.

James narrowed his eyes and asked coldly, "Where's the afternoon meeting being held?" ′′It7sin the conference hall at Celestial Cuisine. Do you have another location in mind?" "Inform them it will be at Golden Birch Group." Ryan was taken aback for a moment, then immediately gave the order.Soon,the major competing companies received the news. Upon learning it was Golden Birch Group, they deeply regretted it. But it was too late, as James had chosen CloudDream Creations.

The news spread like wildfire in the circle.

"John and Emily are so close. They must have known about Mr. Smith's project in advance."

"We missed a great opportunity."

"How could such a large piece of wasteland catch Mr. Smith's eye?"

When news hit that a jewelry exhibition was in the works, doubts were everywhere. People just couldn't shake the feeling that even if the place got built, the jewels inside might not be the cream of the crop.

But if it was led by Quigr under Golden Birch Group, many high-end jewelry brands would definitely rush to be part of it. It was said that there would even be an auction.

If it developed fully in the future, it would surely be very profitable.

When John found out the place of the meeting had been changed to Golden Birch Group, he was furious.

His assistant, Jeremy Wright, noticed his expression and tried to analyze the situation. "Mr. Williams, we can't act impulsively now. You have to think about the company. We've given up many partnerships to secure this project."
###Chapter 80

John took a deep breath and tried to calm himself. He headed over to the Golden Birch Group with a plan he'd been working on for ages.

He'd lost count of how many times he'd been here. Each visit was a fresh dose of humiliation, and today, it felt even worse.

John was already in the meeting room when James walked in, right on time.

James gave John a quick glance, a slight smirk on his lips but coldness in his eyes. He was surprised to find out that John hadn't gotten his injury treated after being knocked down by Emily yesterday.

The jewelry exhibition project was a big deal, with lots of moving parts,but the organizer was the key player. John's team was leading the charge.

John looked lost, his face showing defeat as he stared at the stack of documents in front of him. Yesterday's events had clearly taken a toll on him.


The meeting dragged on for hours, and finally, everyone else left. James casually stopped John.

"Mr. Williams, Golden Birch Group is really counting on this project. Can CloudDream Creations handle it?" James's tone was calm, but there was an underlying pressure and warning. He was subtly reminding John that this was just a partnership, and he shouldn't mess with it or overstep his bounds. John pressed his pale lips together, feeling a bitter taste in his mouth.He'd faced more talented people before, but James was his rival, and it felt like everything he'd worked for was being handed to him as a favor. It made John feel restless.

John took another deep breath. "Mr. Smith, don't worry. CloudDream Creations won't let you down."

John was starting to regain his composure, knowing he couldn't afford to clash with James. CloudDream Creations needed a big project to prove themselves,and so did he.

Plus, this project could put him over the top.

James raised an eyebrow, satisfied with John's response. "From now on,Mr.Williams, you're the overall project manager. I expect you to be on-site,working with the team, overseeing everything. And don't worry, the compensation is quite generous."

John frowned and glanced at him. The project already had multiple teams,and he had several project managers under him to handle different departments.

Even though he was the overall project manager, his main job was coordination,so he didn't need to be on-site all the time.

The east side of the city was far from the center, making the daily commute a hassle. James was clearly trying to keep him away from Emily!

Without hesitation, John nodded. "Got it. I'll be there tomorrow." Last night, Calliope and Wilder had talked with him all night. As an adult,he knew what he wanted. Lately, he'd been played by Veda like a fool. He needed some time alone to clear his head.

Leaving the Golden Birch Group,John immediately spotted Veda.

Jeremy saw her too, then glanced at John's face and quickly walked away with the files in his arms.
As John's personal assistant, Jeremy couldn't stand Veda. She was just a mistress, and he couldn't understand why she always bossed him around without any self-awareness.
When Veda saw John, her eyes lit up. She bit her lip, her face full of sorrow and grievances.
It looked like she'd been crying for a while; her eyes were puffy. She gave John a weak smile.
She walked up to him slowly, trying totake his hand, but he subtly pulled away.
With a sad look in her eyes, Veda spoke softly, "I need to go to the hospital for a check-up today. John, will you come with me?"
After losing her baby, the doctor had told her to get checked if she had any stomach issues during her period.
Veda gently held her stomach, her eyes welling up with tears, "I know I messed up before, but can you come with me to the hospital? I had your baby once." replied to a single message.

In the past, John would have been by her side all the time. She wanted that unconditional love from him again.

But Veda didn't feel the need to explain anything to John. What was done was done. They had been together, and she had been pregnant with his child. She was already his woman. But noww,every time John saw her,he looked disgusted.

He looked at Veda coldly. "Veda, even if you were pregnant now, I'd make you get an abortion."

Veda stood there, stunned. Her whole body went stiff. She lookedat John in disbelief.

"What did you say?"

She felt the autumn wind had turned even colder than before, as if her coat provided no insulation at all.

She suddenly grabbed John's arm, her hands shaking. "John,what did you say?"
He said, "Let's break up for good. Don't bother me again. I'll give you some money to go away."

Veda couldn't help but laugh bitterly. "Do you think I need your money? I love you, and I just want to be with you. You can't blame me for one mistake..." John slowly-pushed her hand away. Seeing her tears didn't make him feel anything. He said coldly, "You fell down from the balcony on purpose and lost the baby,didn't you?"

He continued, "I can't love someone who would harm their own child for their own gain. Don't talk about love to me. You deceived me. What you love is my power and status."

John paused for a moment, then smirked. "No, you don't even love those.
You just want to satisfy your vanity. You want to see Emily suffer. But Emily never did anything to you."

Veda's body went rigid, her tears stopped.

"Would we still be together if I hadn't lost the baby?"

She completely ignored what John had said before.

John smiled coldly. "It's impossíble. You're deceitful, ungrateful,and manipulative. You fooled me for three years. In those three years,I pushed Emily away. Are you happy now?"
The thought of Emily being with someone else now was breaking John's heart.
###Chapter 81

His heart felt like it was being ripped apart.

"But I just like you. I just want to be with you." Veda suddenly dropped to her knees in front of John, not caring about the crowd around them.

She clung to his hand, her eyes red and pitiful, making everyone around feel the urge to protect her.

Veda was always so proud in front of others. She never acted like this,throwing her dignity aside.

John was already on edge today because of the jewelry exhibition.And now, with Veda and all these people around, he felt like he was about to break.


He realized he didn't like Veda at all. He didn't like her weakness, her timidity, or her personality.

Thinking carefully, he found that Veda didn't have any qualities that stood out to him. She had been with him for twelve years longer than Emily,but he never had feelings for her.

If he hadn't found out that Emily had given her virginity to someone else,he wouldn't have gotten drunk and given Veda a chance to be close to him.

He yanked his hand away from Veda and slapp ed her across the face without thinking.The sting in his palm brought him back to his senses. He looked at Veda coldly and said, "I said we're breaking up. Can't you understand it?" Veda felt the burning pain on her face. She looked up, her eyes bloodshot. "John, you can't treat me like this."

John felt even more irritated.

Because of the slap, more people gathered to watch. John furrowed his brow,feeling a headache coming on.

"Mr. Williams, what kind of show are you putting on at the entrance of my company?"


A mocking voice came from behind, making John's back stiffen. He didn't expect James to show up.

He turned around to see James walking towards him slowly,with Eric and a bunch of other rich kids following. They all had that air of superiority.

They were involved in the jewelry exhibition project too. John had a feeling that not all the buildings were meant for selling jewelry.

If the land in the east of the city got developed, it could boost the economy of the whole Emerald City.

Apart from James, John didn't think much of these people,so his expression was cold.

Brian raised an eyebrow. Since the last time he got punched by James, he knew James was serious about Emily. As long as he didn't get in James's way with her, James was indifferent to his other antics. He spoke up, "What kind of drama is the daughter of the Johnson family putting on here? You're actually kneeling? How embarrassing! Are all the Johnsons this shameless?" When Brian said this, the crowd laughed. Veda's cheeks flushed with a mix of shame and rage.

John pressed his lips together, not wanting these people to see him as a joke. Lately, his reputation as a golden boy took a nosedive, and his self-esteem crumbled. This really got to him

Veda couldn't take it anymore. She slowly stood up, wanting to hide behind John. But John stepped away from her.

A hint of disappointment flashed in Veda's eyes. She gritted her teeth,
looked up at James, and said, "Mr. Smith, let's talk."

Brian warned James, "Watch out. She seems to be up to something."

James stayed quiet. John frowned but didn't say anything either.

Brian and the others gave James and Vedasome space.

Veda looked at James and asked, "Mr. Smith, are you really that concerned about Emily?"

James wasn't keen on talking to Veda, but when she mentioned Emily,it piqued his interest. He was curious to know what kind of trick Veda might pull to tarnish her reputation.

A sly smile crept onto Veda's face. "Mr. Smith, you've known Emily for less than a month. Maybe you're just dazzled by her looks. Do you really know what kind of person she is?" James narrowed his eyes, his expression cool. "Ms. Johnson, I'm not as gullible as John, who falls for your petty schemes." Veda smirked. "Mr. Smith, you wronged me; I'm just telling you some truth. Emily is beautiful. Since high school,boys have always flocked to her. She loves being the center of attention, so it's no surprise that despite being married, she still seduced you."

She thought James was still clueless about the truth that Emily never had a marriage certificate. So she deliberately reminded James that Emily was married,betting that it would bother him.

However, in her jealousy and anger, Veda forgot that James had already declared Emily as his girlfriend at her birthday party. So it didn't matter to James if Emily was married or not.
James saw right through Veda's game. His gaze turned contemptuous.

Veda couldn't meet his piercing eyes, which seemed to see right through her.

James chuckled. "You don't know if they're married, but I do. You've been with John for three years and didn't know he faked a marriage. It shows that in John's heart, you'll always be the side piece."

He continued, "It's one thing for others to see you as a mistress, but even John sees you that way. He could have married you, but he didn't. I've seen plenty of mistresses, but someone as low-class as you is a first."

As James kept calling her a mistress, Veda's face grew paler, especially with the slap mark on her cheek, making her look even more pathetic.

Veda clenched her fists so tightly that her nails dug into her palms. James's words shattered her. She took a deep breath and said coldly, "Do you think Emily really loves you? No,she loves John. Three years ago, she was willing to die for him.She's just using you to make John change his mind." She added, "Mr. Smith, are you okay with being used by her? Emily was only interested in your status from the start. Why are you so hung up on her?"


Veda didn't think someone like James would have a sexual relationship with Emily.

After all, Emily had always been dignified, and it was hard to imagine her being intimate with James, especially considering how short their acquaintance had been.


As long as Emily stopped bothering John, Veda wouldn't keep targeting her.


But if James and Emily were really together, things would only get tougher for Veda.

###Chapter 82

Veda had to wreck their relationship, no matter what. She wanted Emily to lose everything!

She glanced at James, who just furrowed his brow, his eyes cold,like he was processing her words.

Veda's eyes gleamed, seizing the moment. "Mr. Smith, you don't want to be Emily's plaything, do you?"

Her words were sharp and cutting. She was beautiful, but as malicious as a snake.


James looked at her without saying a word, then suddenly chuckled,his tone icy. "Ms. Johnson, your lame tricks won't work on me. John was truly foolish before."

Looking down at her, James continued, "I might as well tell you, I've been with Emily for three years now. At first, she was the one keeping me,and I was happy to be used by her, as long as she was satisfied. As for other things, I didn't care at all."

With that, James walked away. He had no intention of getting tangled up with Veda.

But at that moment, Veda was stunned. They had been together for three years!

Veda quickly realized that after the wedding, she and John went abroad,so Emily kept a man in her despair, who was James.
It was unbelievable, but the facts were right in front of her, leaving her no choice but to believe. For Veda, this was a huge blow. According to James, he absolutely loved Emily.


Veda shuddered at the thought. If James always sided with Emily, how could she ruin Emily's reputation and leave her with nothing? No,she had to break them up!


As Veda thought of a plan, she lost control and ran towards James,shouting at his retreating figure, "Since you've been together for three years,you should know that Emily wasn't a virgin when youI two met. She's dirty."

James, who was about to get into his car, stopped in his tracks. He turned around, took quick steps, and stood in front of Veda, his aura cold.

James's expression was not pleasant, and there was a chilling coldness in his eyes.

Veda was filled with fear, but she also felt a strange sense of relief.

No man could accept that his girlfriend had been with someone else, let alone made love to them.

Even John, Emily's childhood sweetheart for over a decade, couldn't bear it.

And James had only known Emily for three years. So she was convinced that James,being high and mighty, couldn't tolerate it. James's voice grew colder, like a drawn dagger. "Your thinking is stll mired in backward ideas. You're a woman, yet you're judging another woman by such archaic and misogynistic standards. How ironic!" He continued, "Then, can you prove that the child youlost was John's?Don't imnpose your feudal ideas on other women. They should be open, bright,and free."

He added, "I'm not concerned with Emily's past. What matters is that she's with me now. Furthermore, it is precisely because of those experiences that Emily has grown strong and radiant. And you are dark, selfish, indifferent,and disgusting!"


Veda's lips trembled as she said, "When Emily was young, her father rape..



Before she could finish her sentence, James kicked her hard, sending her flying and crashing heavily to the ground.

She felt like her insides had been rearranged.

Everyone was in shock. They'd heard way too much, someof it just unbelievable.


Eric knew James was furious. James rarely hit anyone, especially not a woman. The force of his kick made Eric think he wanted to kill her.

Eric quickly stepped in, blocking James with his body and grabbing him."Calm down, man. Deal with her later in private. There are reporters around. You don't want to be trending,do you?"

Veda trembled,feeling the murderous vibe coming off him.

The intense pressure from James made it hard for her to breathe, and she desperately needed a moment to catch her breath.

The sunlight shining on him made him radiate a golden aura, as if he were a god descending to earth. James's presence was too dazzling and powerful. It was the same feeling Emily gave her. They were born to be exceptional.

Even though Emily had been through a lot, she could easily rise above it.

And Veda, on the other hand, seemed more like a venomous snake lurking in the shadows, almost greedily eyeing their happiness.

The more radiant they were, the more she wanted to drag them into the abyss, to make them collapse, cry out, and beg for mercy.

But Veda couldn't even utter a word in response to James's retort. She trembled all over, fear spreading through her.

But why did everyone like Emily? Even though Emily was so tainted,there were still people who liked her, were crazy about her, couldn't live without her.

Against the sunlight, James looked like a demon crawling out of hell,sending shivers down one's spine, his voice cold. "Veda, if I ever hear you defame Emily again, I will rip out your tongue!"

It was no longer a warning, but a threat.

James glanced at Eric. "If any of the words we spoke today get out,you know the consequences. Clean up here."

Eric nodded solemnly. "I understand." It was the first time Eric had seen James like this. He truly loved Emily to death. Eric contacted the security team to control the situation. John had been watching from the sidelines, his body cold. He hadn't expected Veda to go crazy with jealousy, like a demon from hell. James gave Veda a cold glance. The oppressive feeling almost suffocated her,leaving her lying on the ground for a long time, afraid to move.

She tasted blood in her mouth, and she instinctively looked at John,wanting him to take her to the hospital. But John had decisively turned away and left in his car.

Veda let out a low growl. Blood dripping and the cold wind blowing,made her shiver.

The security guards urged her to leave as if shooing away trash. "If you're not dead, leave quickly. Don't be a nuisance here."

After resting for a moment, Veda finally stood up, staggering away.

James sped through the city streets in his car. Eventually, he pulled up.

He slammed his fist hard on the steering wheel, veins popping on his hand.
###Chapter 83

James was totally thrown off by what Veda had said.

He was aware Emily wasn't a virgin when they met again, but he didn't care at all. He wasn't the type to get hung up on that stuff. Heck, he was even ready to be the other guyin her life.

He was cool with all her past because what truly mattered was being with her.

But he never saw it coming that Emily's first time was with Lucas! And Veda even called it a rape.

Lucas had served time for raping a minor. Since their village was intellectually backward, they didn't make a big fuss about the incident.Moreover, Isolde paid some money, which allowed Lucas to be released in less than a month.

Emily had been living near Lucas for ten years. Jameshated himself for not meeting her sooner and not being able to take her away back then.

As she grew up, John probably also...

James couldn't bear to think about it anymore. Jealousy was driving him nuts. He even felt like killing them all!

James sat in his car for what felt like forever before he finally called his guys to dig up everything on Lucas. He needed to know every single detail!

James knew Veda was just trying to mess things up between him and Emily,hoping they'd break up.

If he let this come between them, he'd be as dumb as John. Meanwhile, Emily had just wrapped up a meeting and was working on some design sketches the Williams Group.

Her teacher was pushing her to come up with a new perfume formula.

Emily was a bit stressed. If she went to the lab,she'd need to take time off from work.What excuse could she use?

Just then, she got a call from the president's office asking her to see Wilder.

"Mr. WVilliams, is there something you need??"

At work, Emily called Wilder "Mr. Williams" to keep things professional.

Wilder motioned for her to sit on the couch and handed her a document.


Emily glanced at it and was a bit surprised. "Are you assigning this task to me?"

Wilder smiled. "Yeah, I thought about it and even ran it by James. He's cool with it. You're the perfect fit for this."

The East City project was meant to gather a lot of luxury jewelry brands to set up shops there. But right now, these brands were hesitant and hadn't signed any contracts.

One reason was that East City wasn't finished yet. Signing now would put the jewelry merchants in a tough spot if things changed later. Even though Golden Birch Group backed them, some jewelers were still on the fence. After all, Golden Birch Group's main gig wasn't Quigr Jewelry. If the East City project tanked, Golden Birch Group had other options, but some jewelers didn't. Emily's job was to negotiate with high-end luxury jewelry brands and lock in a ten-year exhibition contract for the future.

After thinking it over, Emily nodded. "Okay."

Then with a clever glint in her eyes, Emily asked, "Can I take the design sketches home to work on? If there are social events with the jewelers, I might not make it to work on time every day."

Wilder said, "Do what you need to. If you get too tired, just let me know,and I'll handle James for you."

Emily felt a bit helpless hearing Wilder call James by his first name.

James was definitely a charmer. He had quickly won over the Williams family.

That afternoon, Emily headed to the lab to work on some perfumes. When she finally checked her phone, it was already 8 PM, and there was a message from James: [Your assistant said you're not in the office.Where are you? I'll come pick you up.]

Emily was surprised and replied: [Where are you now?]

[Outside your company building.]

Seeing his reply, Emily quickly packed up and sent: [I've been out dealing with something. Wait for me at the intersection in front of the company,and I'll be there soon.] James just responded with a single word, and Emily could tell he wasn't in the best of moods.She took a taxi to the intersection in front of the company. James's car was already there waiting.

She got into the passenger seat and asked, "Why did you suddenly decide to pick me up after work today?"

"I missed you." James' voice was serious, not playful.

Emily reached out and playfully pinched his cheek. "You seem to be in a bad mood today. Who upset you?"

James held her hand and shook his head slowly. "No one."

Men sometimes lied, and when James was in a bad mood, he would deliberately tease her in bed.

He pressed her down on the bed, her body blushing, her two pink nipples unconsciously erect.

His strong fingers lightly twisted, trying to please her.

James was gentle tonight, not rough like before.

His caresses and kisses were soft and careful.

He made almost no sound, slowly kissing her lips. His penis was half-hard.pressing against Emily's lower abdomen, but he dlidn't enter, just teasing at her wet entrance.

Instead, he kissed every part of Emily's body.

Emily was kissed until her eyes were misty. Her petite body trembled,almost sinking into the bedding.
Emily could feel that James was particularly unhappy today. He seemed to be suppressing something. He clearly wanted her, but just kept teasing her like this.

James skillfully undressed her, pulling her into an intimate embrace.

Emily didn't know what was wrong with him. Feeling his penis thick and hard,she took the initiative to hold it, twisting her waist with seductive eyes.

She had long fallen under his spell. His body was increasingly tempting.making her feel empty and unbearable.

James couldn't hold back anymore, fondling her full breasts, his thick and hard penis thrusting in without delay.

Emily's sensitive body trembled with each thrust, a bone-chillingpleasure constantly emanating from their connection.

James massaged her full and soft breasts, continuously kissing her smooth neck, his penis teasing her tender vagina. Each thrust made her body tremble uncontrollably.

Emily half-closed her eyes, tears of emotion rolling down her cheeks.

But then, James suddenly whispered in her ear, "Who is better, me or John?11

Emily's body stiffened, her seductive eyes almost instantly turning clear,and a layer of coldness gradually enveloped her. She pushed James away fiercely, her foot against his chest,her gaze icy and resolute. "James, you've crossed the line."
###Chapter 84

Emily snapped out of it in a heartbeat. She opened her eyes, and the desire in them vanished like a wave pulling back from the shore.

Gone was the tenderness, replaced by a coldness sharp as a blade.

That coldness in Emily's eyes slowly morphed into anger. James picked up on her mood shift right away and quickly grabbed her hand, apologizing,”Emmy,I'm sorry."

Emily dodged his touch. The lingering traces of their intimacy were still on her body, but his erection wilted in the frosty atmosphere.

James felt a bit panicked. Saying he "crossed the line" seemed way too harsh.


He slowly lay back on the bed, his strong upper body, long legs, and chiseled face making him look like a gigolo.

His voice was weak,tinged with a hint of grievance and resentment. "Can't I even bring it up?"

His earlier question had triggered a reaction in her that seemed to speak of a total and irrevocable split.

Was John still such a taboo subject for her, something she couldn't even bear to be mentioned? "Mr. Smith, let me remind you again, we're together to make each other happy, not to bring each other down." Emily was genuinely pissed. In the past threeyears,James had never asked such a question.It turned out that he also cared a lot about whether she was a virgin.

Emily closed her eyes, hiding the sadness in them. Her virginal experience was a painful memory, not even with John.

She had no recollection of what had happened that night at all, as though amnesia had struck.


Emily had a hunch it had something to do with Veda. But she had no proof.


Thinking about it made Emily feel really uncomfortable, even making her not want to see James for a bit. She got up and headed to the bathroom.

James reached out and grabbed her hand, pulling her back. "Emmy, don't be mad. I just..."


Emily coldly shook off his hand without looking back.

Before, if they hooked up, they'd sleep together. But tonight, Emily went back to her own room, took a shower, went to bed, and even locked the door.


It was late, so James gave up knocking on the door.


The next morning, Emily got up on time for work. As soon as she opened the door, James stumbled towards her and only fully woke up when he hit the ground. Emily looked down at him, a bit stunned. She slowly squatted down,her curious gaze falling on James. "Mr. Smith, did you sleep at my door all night?" She blinked. "Why do I feel like you're acting like a weirdo?"James pursed his lips lightly, his eyes still a bit sleepy. After a moment,he said with a touch of grievance, "I was afraid you'd run away in the night."

Emily belatedly realized that James was quite insecure.

He then spoke up, "I'm sorry. I just wanted to apologize to you.I definitely didn't mean what you thought."

James was a bit tongue-tied for a moment. He rarely said such illogical things. Then he pursed his lips. "I don't even know why, but I'm just a little jealous."

Should another person be the obstacle in his relationship with Emily,James wouldn't respond with such intensity.

But that was John, who had been with Emily throughout her youth, and had made Emily love him since she was young.

Although their relationship was very bad now, there was no guarantee that one day they wouldn't go back to how they used to be.

Now that John knew what kind of person Veda was, he'd definitely come back to chase after Emily.

James wasn't sure how much space John took up in Emily's heart or how heavy his presence was there.

Emily's gaze flickered slightly. She looked at James, who seemed like a child-aggrieved,regretful, remorseful, and trying to make things right after messing up.

This wasn't the usual commanding and imposing James.

He asked carefully, "Don't be mad, okay?" No one knew how James had spent that night. He guarded the door,afraid Emily would run away and leave him.

Emily belatedly realized the impact her behavior had on James last night.

She slowly cupped James's face, smiling helplessly. "I'm not that mad."

She leaned in and kissed his lips. Then, Emily's gaze softened as she looked into James's eyes. "But, James, don't ever fall in love with me."

James was unwilling. "Why? Is it because of what John did to you? Or Lucas? Should I go kill them?"

Emily's gaze darkened slightly. He knew about Lucas. Her heart twinged with a hidden pain.

"Emmy, should I bear the harm caused to you by others?"

Emily furrowed her brows.

James realized something was wrong and was about to make amends when he heard Emily's clear voice. "Because I don't love you."

James was stunned.

Emily continued, "Let's take a break for a while. I won't come back for now."

Emily was clear-headed and gentle without any hysteria, making it impossible for others to see through her heart. Emily left directly without even having breakfast. James couldn't understand why. After they had been spending the night together all these days, Emily could ruthlessly let him go. Why was Emily always so clear-headed and restrained in these three years?

He could vaguely feel Emily's indulgence and attachment to him. But just because of a few words, Emily didn't want him anymore.

All the previous efforts were in vain just because of John?

After Emily left the mansion, her eyes reddened slightly, and her restless mind was about to explode.


How should she explain to James? Could she told him that nothing happened between her and Lucas?

Could she explain that she had been kidnapped before and didn't know what happened during the ordeal, not even who might have violated her?

These things were difficult to talk about. Because of these things,she felt inferior, depressed, and had thoughts of suicide.

John had saved her twice, but three years ago,he had mercilessly stood against her.

Things changed in the blink of an eye, and she couldn't afford to take risks. So she never talked about love ever since.

She had finally hidden these tangled things in her heart, and now James had unraveled them with just a few words.

Her whole body ached. Emily temporarily left Crystal Valley Manor. James called her, she answered as usual, called him "honey" as usual, but her tone was cold. In fact, they both knew that the more they pretended nothing was wrong,the deeper the rift between them grew. Today, Emily didn't go to the company. She was in the lab, and she has a meeting with members of the Jewelers Association in the afternoon to discuss cooperation.


She prepared her perfume formula and took it to her teacher, Harry Brooks.


Harry took a quick look and asked, "Are you not in a good mood today?"
###Chapter 85

Emily asked, "Why do you say that?"

"Are you sure this is perfume? It looks more like poison."

Emily was taken aback. She glanced at the formula and quickly made a change.She pinched her eyebrows,feeling a bit helpless.

"If you're not feeling great, go out and have some fun. No rush on this."

Emily didn't respond. She changed clothes in the lab and headed to the company with her assistant to meet with the jewelers for a collaboration.

She often accompanied Wilder to the jewelers' association, so she knew them well.


The meeting was at a fancy club. Everyone had some objections to the jewelry on display, but they were also very tempted. After all, it was a collaboration with the Golden Birch Group.

Emily handed out documents to everyone, not expecting John to show up later.


He was dressed in a dark gray suit, looking elegant and tall, and seemed quite composed.


He was wearing the earrings she designed for him for the first time.

Emily remembered when she had decided to make these earrings for him,John had been very dismissive.

He had said.′′It2sridiculous for a man to wear this kind of thing."

John hardly ever took it out ever she had given it to him. When he took it out today, John discovered that the gemstone earrings had their initials engraved on it.

John was overwhelmed with regret. Why hadn't he noticed the earrings earlier?

Now, wearing the earrings, John sat beside Emily, wanting to talk to her but not knowing where to start.

His hands rarely fidgeted together; with his head down, he looked somewhat sad.

Emily didn't look at him. John wasn't a jeweler; he probably found out her whereabouts from someone in the company.

Emily chatted with the people in front of her. She discussed the contract details, debated profit distribution, and was also persuaded to drink by them.


John wanted to help by drinking a little, but Emily refused. He could only retract his hand in disappointment.

After more than two hours, these people finally left. With a good tolerance for alcohol, Emily was slightly tipsy.

Emily looked calmly at John. "Mr. Williams, we've finished our discussion,
and you've heard everything. When do you plan to leave?"

Emily lazily leaned back on the sofa.John asked, "Aren't you curious why I broke up with you back then?" Emily's gaze fell on him, her tone dripping with sarcasm, "I know the reason. It was simply because I wasn't a virgin, and you thought I was dirty."

There were indeed many mysteries between them. It was reasonable for him to have such suspicion without really knowing the truth. Trusting unconditionally was too difficult for some people.

A hint of embarrassment flashed in John's eyes.

James's words from yesterday were like a heavy hammer, pounding hard on his heart.

Why did he have such strict demands on Emily? Emily had never despised his ordinariness.

John took a deep breath and said, "Veda can imitate your voice. She didit so well that she used a recording to mess things up between us. I kept it in the safe at home. You can listen to it when you have time."

Emily was a bit curious about this. She thought Veda might reveal some things from the past in the voice recording.

Lowering his head, John gave a bitter smnile. "If I had worn the earrings you gave me earlier, they might have nudged me to trust you more."

Emily didn't respond. She just suddenly got up, reached out towards John.and placed her hands on his ears.

Realizing what she wanted to do, John dodged back. "Emmy,you can't do that!"


This pair of earrings was designed and made by Emily herself.

After a moment of hesitation, Emily still grabbed his ears. She wanted to take them off, but John wouldn't allow it. In the struggle,John even tilted his head back fiercely despite the pain.

Possibly due to the alcohol, Emily simply tore the earrings off.

John's face turned pale with pain, and blood drops kept falling from his ear.


He was stunned, not expecting Emily to be so ruthless.

Emily remained indifferent, casually threw the earrings out of the window,and calmly said, "It's meaningless to talk about these things now. You don't need to wear the earrings anymore."

John clenched his lips. After a while, he got up the courage to say,"Emmy,I admit I was wrong before, but I was also manipulated by Veda. Can you give me a chance? I want to make up for what I owe you in the past."

Emily looked at him with a half-smile. "How do you want to make up for it?"


His eyes lit up suddenly. He cautiously probed, "Emmy, let's start over,okay?"


There was a rare hint of humility in John's voice, mixed with a plea.

The smile in Emily's eyes gradually faded, and she asked casually,"John,why are you so sure that when you change your mind, I'm still waiting for you?" The light in John's eyes gradually dimmed. His body trembled slightly.The pain pierced his heart. "And what makes you think that I would definitely choose you over James?Is it your irresponsibility, your narcissism, and your ignorance?" John didn't expect that his image in Emily's mind had become like this.

John's face became increasingly unsightly. "Emmy, I've never been narcissistic in front of you, but rather inferior."

Emily found it amusing. "When I met you at twelve, I felt so inferior that I always wanted to grow into someone who could match you. But you just abandon yourself. You're really just a child, never growing up. It's a
ridiculous reason that you're inferior."

They had truly loved each other before,so John didn't want to give up. He wanted to hold onto Emily tightly.

He had always understood that Emily was the most important person in his heart.

He was with Veda partly because he hoped Emily would come back to him.But she didn't.

He also knew that Emily's love for him had always been selfless,pure,and passionate. He was the one who tarnished that love.

And Veda's affection was dirty, full of calculation and desire.

John took a deep breath and continued, "Emmy, James is not suitable for you. His family background is complicated. You will be in great danger.And they will definitely choose a family with a similar background for a marriage alliance." He added, "I've investigated that their first choices are the Allen family and the Mellon Family. If you really end up together, you'll just be a mistress."Emily sneered, the sarcasm on her lips becoming more pronounced. "Oh, well said. Do I need to thank you for considering my interests?"
###Chapter 86

John's eyes were brimming with grief, so heavy it was hard for him to catch his breath.


"I know I'm being selfish, but I can't stand the thought of losing you.Lately, I've been dreaming about ourpast every single night. I wish we could go back to our college days."

He watched Emily closely, hoping to see some sign of nostalgia or happiness,but there was nothing. His heart sank.

The weight of it all made his eyes well up with tears.

With a humble tone, he asked, "Emmy,is there really no way we can go back to how things were?"

Emily twisted the dry bloodstain in her hand, which smelled faintly of rust.

Without a second thought, she said, "John, we need to move on. For the sake of our families, I don't want to cut ties completely, but we can't be together anymore."


John couldn't hold back his emotions any longer and almost cried, "Is it because of James? You've only been with him for a month. How can that compare to our ten years together?" What hurt John the most was losing to James.

They'd only been dating for a month! Why did Emily suddenly choose him?

Then Emily dropped a bombshell, "John, James and I have been together for three years."John's body shook. He was completely stunned.

"To be exact, after you left for Veda in the midst of our wedding,I was with James that night."

"Sometimes I think it's all just karma. When you and I ended, he andI started. Whatever happens between James and me, I'll accept it."

She didn't want to invest too much emotion and get hurt again.

John was in a daze for a long time before he finally reacted. "You two have really been together that long?"

Three years was enough to erase him from her heart.

Emily spoke calmly, "I have no reason to lie to you."

With a bitter smile, John almost collapsed onto the sofa. He slowly covered his face with his hands, unable to say a word.

"John, take care of yourself. I won't bother you anymore."

With that, Emily turned to leave.

In a moment of panic, John felt that if he didn't stop her now, he'd never get another chance.


He rushed forward like a madman, but Emily was already gone, her figure disappearing down the corridor. followed the jewelers to inspect the site, partly to avoid James.

Her mind was a mess, and she'd been having the same nightmare every night for the past few days.

In the dream, she was a little girl, maybe five or six, pinned down by Lucas.

She was too small, and Lucas held her hands down forcefully. She cried out, "Daddy, I'm your daughter.Please let me go!"

Her body trembled. She had seen Lucas dragging a little girl into the field.She knew what he was going to do, so she ran to the village for help with all her might.

The little girl was saved, but when Lucas returned, he beat Emily and locked her in a room for three days without food or water. At that time,Emily felt like she was going to die in there.

It wasn't until the fourth day that a drunken Lucas stumbled in, leering as he entered the room.


"I didn't want to touch you originally, but since you had someone save that little girl, it's your turn to satisfyme."

"No,you're my daddy!"

"Nonsense, I'm not your dad."

She always woke up from the dream at this point. All the painful memories Emily had buried from her childhood seemed to be slowly resurfacing. Lucas must have always known she wasn't his biological daughter. But it was Isolde who had switched the children, and she claimed to have kept it a secret from everyone, hadn't she?

Emily hadn't been sleeping well these days.

The next day, she led her team to the construction site.

There were already design drawings, but only the foundation had been laid so far.


When Emily saw the design drawings for the first time, she was deeply moved.


The appearance of all the buildings was very similar to her jewelry designs.

And this project was led by the Golden Birch Group. The design drawings were also from the Golden Birch Group.

Emily clenched her fists slightly.

A jeweler surrounding the design drawings said, "The buildings look great,but it's not sure if they will turn out as expected."


There werealso nighttime lighting design drawings on the plans,like another heartfelt declaration of love.


This place could even become the iconic building of Emerald City in the future.


Suddenly, Emily felt some regret coming here. She asked the person in charge to take the jewelers' team around while she waited in the tent. Since the nearest village was half an hour away, the workers stayed at the site during the day, only returning home at night.

"Emmy? What are you doing here?"

John had been at the construction site for several days and was surprised to see Emily.


He instinctively walked towards her and asked in a low voice, "Are you here to find me?"


Emily frowned. "Why are you here?"

Wearing a hard hat, John seemed a bit casual today, with a light layer of dust on him.


John said, "Let me take you around the surrounding area. Except for the construction site, the scenery nearby.is quite beautiful."


With many people watching, John's voice almost pleaded. "Please. You said we're still friends,right?"

Emily furrowed her brows but agreed. There was no harm in taking a look.

As they walked, John did most of the talking while Emily barely replied.

Glancing at Emily beside him, John asked,"How long do you plan to stay here?"


Emily replied softly, "I'll be leaving soon."

John fell silent. He slowed his pace, seemingly thinking about how to make Emily stay. Just as he was about to speak, his eyes suddenly widened.

He rushed to Emily and embraced her tightly. Emily was about to struggle,but she felt a huge impact on her back. Then she heard the sound of something falling behind her, followed by a cloud of dust.

John suddenly coughed heavily. There was a taste of blood in the air.

Emily slowly raised her head and saw a crane operating above them.Due to a worker's carelessness, a heavy wooden plank had slipped from a relatively low height.

Even so, being hit directly like that would still be quite painful.

And that wooden plank was originally meant to fal on her.
###Chapter 87

Emily could barely keep John upright. "John, are you alright? Is there a medical team around?"


John winced in pain, hunched over with blood trickling from his mouth.He couldn't get a word out.

Emily figured he might have internal injuries and quickly called for help.

A staff member rushed over, looking worried. "Mr. Williams, are you okay?
11

Most of the folks here were from CloudDream Creations, so they were naturally concerned about him.

The crane operator hurried over too. "What happened?"

The staff member pointed at him. "What did you do? You've hurt Mr.Williams."


John was quickly taken to the medical team. But since this place was newly set up, there was only one doctor.

The doctor could only provide basic treatment for now. John's shirt was cut open, revealing a swollen back with a nasty bruise.

With the doctor's help, John stopped coughing up blood for the moment.

Given the limited resources, the doctor said, "Mr. WVilliams needs an X-ray to check for internal inuries or broken bones. You should get him to a big hospital ASAP."

Emily immediately said. "I'll have my driver take you to the hospital in my car."

John lay there quietly for a bit before saying, "I'm fine. I don't think I have any internal injuries. I just need to rest here for a while."

Emily frowned. "John, this isn't something to take lightly."

She looked at his back, feeling conflicted.

No matter what. John had saved her. Even if she wasn't thrilled with him,she couldn't just ignore him. But John was being stubborn.

Just as Emily was about to lose her cool, a staff member nearby awkwardly spoke up, "Ms. Johnson. Mr. Williams is also under the Golden Birch Group's requirements. They need him on the front line, and he can't leave unless absolutely necessary."

He added. "Mr. Williams has only been here a few days. If he takes leave just to see a doctor, it might look bad to the Golden Birch Group."

The CloudDream Creations didn't want to risk losing this hard-earned business deal.


Emily paused, thinkingit must be James's doing. No one else had that kind of authority.

Emily stayed silent.

John spoke up, "Jamesis probably worried I'll bother you."

The staff member hesitated. "Ms. Johnson, we know you're Mr. Smith's girlfriend. Could you help with getting him leave? Otherwise,it's really hard to explain."


Emily hesitated but couldn't stand seeing John's pale face.
Wilder and Calliope actually cared a lot about John. If something happened to him, she wouldn't be able to face them.

Emily stayed calm. "You go to the hospital for treatment first, and I'll talk to James about the rest."


Then she walked out and dialed a familiar number.

James picked up almost immediately, sounding a bit surprised. "Why are you calling me out of the blue?"


They hadn't been in touch for days. James had wanted to meet Emily when she submitted the design drafts, but her assistant handled it instead.The assistant even sent the email without coming to the Golden Birch Group.


Emily whispered, "I'm at the construction site on the east side of the city.John got hurt, so I want to help him get leave and get back to the city center for treatment."


There was a dead silence on the other end of the phone. Emily could practically feel the tension radiating from James.

After a few seconds, James finally spoke, "You haven't contacted me these past few days, nor have you come home. Is it because you're with John?"

Emily felt a surge of annoyance. "James, I'm talking about something important here."


James let out a bitter laugh. "Why are you the one asking for leave on his behalf? Can't he do it himself?"
 
His last sentence was dripping with barely contained anger.Emily explained. "Something fell from the crane, and John saved me."

James laughed, but it was more out of frustration. "How long have you two been apart? Why does a designer like youneed to be at a construction site? And how do you know he's not just playing the victim?"


Emily went quiet for a moment. She glanced at John, who was wincing in pain, his lips pale.

Despite his flaws, John had a good heart.

Plus, construction sites were dangerous. One wrong move could be fatal.

John wasn't that devious. If he were, he wouldn't have been fooled by Veda for so long. He was just self-centered and arrogant.


Most importantly, she had come here on a whim. She didn't know John would be at the site, and he didn't know she was coming. It was pure coincidence.


"No, he isn't. You're overthinking it."

James sneered. "Emily,what makes you so sure?"

Emily didn't hesitate. "Because I know John."

She sighed, took a few steps away, and said, "James, you don't need to act like this. Helping him take leave doesn't mean there's anything between us.I've told you before, I won't reconcile with him. John is just a estranged acquaintance to me now . You don't have to target him because of this." "How am I targeting him?" Emily could sense the calm before the storm in James's voice. But some things needed to be made clear, even if James didn't want to hear them.


"You made him, a CEO, stay on the construction site. What about the follow-up work? It's a bit much that he's not allowed to go back."

James laughed, his voice colder. "Do John's complaints easily win you over?When I beg you, you don't even look back. He's so special to you!"


Emily frowned, her voice tinged with frustration. "John didn't complain. If it wasn't for you targeting him, I wouldn't bother meddling with your decision. Mixing a big project like the jewelry exhibition with personal grievances doesn't seem like your style."

She continued, "Most importantly, you've dragged me into this. If it were someone else today, would you be so difficult to talk to? James, it's you who's making me feel a bit guilty towards John."

James's voice erupted in anger. "Emily, do you know what you're saying?"

Emily was very clear that if someone else had saved her today,James would only be grateful.

She had never thought of getting back together with John. But James didn't believe it.

After all the time spent with James, Emily was starting to feel confused.The three rules seemed to no longer exist. Did their relationship really need to continue? If they kept going like this, it would be hard for them to end well.
###Chapter 88

Emily said seriously, "I know what I'm talking about."

James sighed and said, "Alright, if you want to bring him back for treatment, I'll arrange for someone to pick him up."

Emily never expected James to send a private helicopter.

But it was a good thing. It would take over three hours to get to the central hospital in the city by car, but the helicopter would be much faster.

As they boarded the helicopter, John looked at Emily cautiously.

"Come with me," he said.

Emily got on the helicopter too.

On the helicopter, John struggled to keep his eyes open, his gaze fixed on Emily.

This accident was totally unexpected. When he saw something falling towards Emily's head, he rushed up without thinking.

John was relieved that it wasn't Emily who got hurt. In that moment,he was scared to death, and he realized his feelings for Emily completely.

He loved Emily more than he had imagined. No matter what, he wouldn't give up on her. If Emily left him, it would feel as painful as being flayed alive. Regardless of the current relationship between Emily and James, he and Emily had over a decade of affec tion that wouldn't be easily severed. When they arrived at the hospital, John was wheeled in for treatment. He had a broken rib that had punctured the edge of his lung and needed surgery.


The doctor said if they had arrived any later, the rib would have punctured the lung completely and it would have been fatal.

Upon hearing this, Emily realized that surgery was necessary.She arranged for John to be admitted.


Shortly after, John was taken to the operating room while Emily signed the consent form.


After seeing to everything, an hour had passed, and John was wheeled out of the operating room. It was time for Emily to leave..

"Emmy,will you come to see me tomorrow?" John asked.

Emily furrowed her brow, looked at his pale face, and replied calmly, "I'm grateful to you for saving me. If you want compensation, I can give it to you, but please don't think about anything else."

John felt like his heart was being laid bare by her words. Emily had always known what he was thinking. This made John feel embarrassed.

He had to change the subject forcefully, "Can you not tell dad and mom about the injury for now? I don't want them to worry."

Emily nodded. "I'll find a caregiver for you."

John might not be able to leave the hospital for a while.

As she walked out of the ward, she ran into James in the corridor outside.

James was still angry, with a grim expression, but he asked, "How is John?" "He just finished surgery. The rib punctured his lung," Emily replied.

James smirked. "That's quite a cost."

Emily gave him a look. "This is not the time to mock him."

They hadn't seen each other for several days. James stared at Emily,who was wearing a trench coat that accentuated hner slim waist, making her look both cold and fierce.

James knew the likelihood of John intentionally orchestrating this was slim,but the incident had entangled the two again.

Moreover. Emily scolded and reprimanded him for John's sake!

Just the thought of it made James very angry. And he couldn't make a fuss in front of Emily.

Even at their most intimate moments, Emily was always clear-headed. She had always been thinking about distancing herself from him.

These days,James was both looking forward to and dreading her call.

He was terrified that Emily would say, "This is the end for us."

James came today to make things right. With a hint of a smile, he said, "T'm not that heartless. I'll find a caregiver to look after him."

Emily just nodded.James took her hand, noticing she didn't pull away, and said with a faint smile, "TIl cook tonight. How about we have dinner at my place?" Emily had been staying elsewhere for almost a week. She really liked James's cooking, but he was usually too busy to cook.

She looked at James. "I have to go back to the Williams Mansion tonight."

James's face fell.

Emily raised her head, kissed him on the corner of his lips, and pinched his cheek. "I'll be back later tonight."

James's eyes lit up instantly, and he agreed.

After leaving the hospital, Emily went straight to the Williams Mansion.

She found a USB drive in the safe. There was only one audio file.

"John, let's break up. You're not good enough for me. Everything you do is so mediocre. And after all these years together,you can't even kiss properly. It's more comfortable to sleep with Philip, who is better than you in every way. Philip doesn't mind that I'm no longer a virgin. What's more,he's very good to me."


The voice sounded like hers, but it was definitely manipulated. Emily was sure she had never said such things.


And Philip Mitchell was their college counselor, someone she still respected.

But the voice message didn't mention much about that incident. Just the mention of a Philip was enough to shatter John's confidence. John had always been a very sensitive person. After taking the USB drive, Emily left the Williams Mansion without even having dinner. What exactly had happened during that time? She had been suddenly gone for several days for so long, and why hadn't she left any clues 
The Johnson family didn't care about her, so it was Calliope who had reported her missing. During that period, she hadn't had much to eat or gotten much sleep,which had really worn her out..

She had returned home unexpectedly. Yet, she couldn't remember anything about her kidnapping, leaving the police with no leads to track down the criminal.


Driving through the city streets, Emily knew her depression was flaring up and she couldn't drive anymore.

She parked the car on the side of the road. Memories were absent, but fear lingered, gnawing at her like maggots.

Emily had even felt like she had been poisoned. She had undergone toxicology tests, and the doctor had said, "It's been too long. We won't find anything now."

Emily was trembling uncontrollably, her body drenched in cold sweat.

Her depression came with severe symptoms. Since the day she was violated,she had been haunted by nightmares of being trapped in a dark room with thin air.


After running out, she had looked to John as her beacon of hope, but he had started to distance himself from her. starting to get better, John abandoned her at the wedding.

Everyone laughed at her, and her parents didn't want her.

After the wedding, she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder on top of her depression. She wouldn't like anyone anymore. She didn't even know what liking someone felt like.

All that remained inside her was fear, but she hid it behind a facade of openness and nonchalance every day.


There was a ticking time bomb buried deep within her heart.
###Chapter 89

Emily's hands shook as she fished out a box of meds from the car's glove compartment.

It had been ages since she last took her depression meds.

Living with James had made her feel almost normal, like she was cured.But she was wrong.

When she opened the box, it was empty.

She tore through the car, searching for the meds. But they were gone.

Emily's emotions spiraled, and a dark, murderous glint flashed in her eyes.

Her gaze landed on the USB drive, and the words synthesized by Veda echoed in her mind, causing a chilling pain. Her head pounded.

Her bottled-up rage exploded, and she sped off to the Johnson Mansion.

At the mansion's gate, the butler didn't hesitate, "You'e not part of the Johnson family anymore. You can't come in."

In a fit of rage, Emily floored the gas pedal, shocking the butler as she crashed through the gate and into the garden. The butler's legs wobbled.

Aiden and Mia were both at the company at the time.

The butler, clueless about Emily's intentions,quickly made a call. Emily parked and stormed upstairs.The servants, seeing her fury, didn't dare approach. She banged on Veda's door, but there was no answer. Narrowing her eyes,Emily kicked the door open.

The loud crash woke Veda, who had just cried herself to sleep.

"Emily, why are you back?" Veda asked.

Without a word, Emily grabbed her by the neck, her eyes bloodshot.

"Veda, you took everything from me. Why do you still want to hurt me?"

Emily's grip tightened.

With her karate training and awards, Emily was way stronger than the average woman.

Veda, trapped in her grip, couldn't fight back. Her face turned red, and she couldn't speak.

She desperately tried to pry Emily's hand off her neck.

But Emily didn't budge.

Seeing the murderous intent in Emily's eyes, Veda's body shook with fear.

"Emily!"

Suddenly, a sharp pain hit the back of her neck, and Emily blacked out.Her hand loosened, and she fell back, caught by the man behind her. It was Emily's psychiatrist,Gerald Patterson. Gerald half-carried Emily, his gaze falling on Veda, who was struggling to breathe. Trembling, Veda pointed at Emily, "I'm calling the police. She tried to kill me!"

"Ms. Johnson, if you call the police, your scheme with Lucas will go public.



Veda's face went even paler.

Gerald looked down at Emily helplessly, who was still trembling.

He carried her away.

"I killed Veda!"


Emily jolted awake. In her dream, she had strangled Veda,whose eyes were full of resentment.

Looking around, she realized she was in a familiar place. It was Gerald's counseling room.

She sat up slowly, staring at her hands.The dream felt too real, and she muttered, "I killed Veda. I killed Veda!"

Emily's breathing quickened. Just then, a warm glass of water was handed to her.

"Relax, you didn't kill her. I got there in time, and Veda's fine."

Emily let out a sigh of relief, her tense nerves easing up. "Dr. Rivera, how did I get here? And how did you find me?" she asked,still a bit dazed. Gerald replied, "You called me, asking for help because you couldn't control yourself. I tracked you down. When I got to the Johnson Mansion,you had already attacked Veda. But don't worry; she's fine and won't say anything."

Emily couldn't recall any of what Gerald was saying.

After a moment, she said, "I'm out of meds. Can you prescribe some for me?"

Gerald hesitated before saying, "Sure."

He was Emily's psychiatrist. He knew everything about her-her assault.the fallout with John and Veda, and her relationship James. She had no secrets from him.

Over the years with James, Emily hadn't had any relapses. She even thought she was cured.

Emily noticed the USB drive on the table and asked, "Have you listened to what's on this USB drive?"


Gerald shook his head. "You seem really concerned about it."

Emily's eyes flickered. "There's an audio file on it. Maybe it can help with my condition."


Gerald nodded. "Alright, I'll check it out."

Looking out the window at the dark night, Emily checked her phone and was surprised to see it was already 2 a.m. "Did I sleep that long?" Gerald looked at her. "You wwoke up once, showing signs of self-harm, so I gave you a sedative. That's why you slept until now."
Emily's bipolar disorder had been a long-standing issue. Gerald suspected 
it started after Lucas had tried to assault her.

After returning to the Johnson Mansion, her condition wasn't taken seriously. Though her bipolar disorder wasn't obvious, Emily had been avoiding everyone.

Emily didn't really know how to like someone, so she was cold and indifferent to everyone.

She pinched her brow and asked, "Is my memory loss related to my illness?"

Gerald nodded.

Emily got up, went to the bathroom, and saw the bruises on her neck,even some bloodstains. She had been particularly harsh on herself.

After washing her face, she walked out and said to Gerald, "Dr. Rivera,thanks for today."

"No need to be so formal," Gerald smiled warmly.

Suddenly, Gerald remembered something. "By the way, your phone's been ringing. I answered it for you."

Emily noticed it was James calling. She felt a headache coming on.

"What did he say?" "He asked when you'd be back, I told him we were friends and that you were staying with me tonight." Emily gritted her teeth, already imagining how furious James would be at Crystal Valley Manor. "How did he react?"

"He was pretty rude, hung up on me."

Emily sighed, rubbing her temples.
###Chapter 90

Emily's situation was a mess. She was scared she might have another breakdown soon.

James only knew she had trouble sleeping,nothing more.

She had a killer headache and had no clue how to tell James. It was driving her nuts.

Emily looked at Gerald. "Dr. Patterson, can I crash here tonight?"

"Sure thing."

Gerald left the office and headed home.

Emily slept in until after ten in the morning. The office was dead quiet,and even the person who usually opened up wasn't there. Clearly,Gerald had told them to come in later.


Emily felt a wave of gratitude.

Behind the office, there was a big flat where Emily had slept. It was Gerald's crash pad for when he worked late.


During Emily's roughest times, Gerald had suggested she move in with him for convenience, buIt she had turned him down.


So, she had chosen to stay here instead. She knew the place like the back of her hand.After freshening up, she shot a message to Gerald before heading out. Gerald replied: [If you feel unwell,call me right away.] Emily:[Got it,thanks.]

Emily left and saw her car downstairs. The front was totally smashed, and the glass was shattered.

She pulled out her phone and made a call. "Mr. Brooks,I need to borrow something."

Harry's deep voice came through. "What do you need?"

"Your pet."

After Emily grabbed a bite to eat, Harry called to say everything was set.

Only then did Emily call Veda. "Veda,let's meet up and talk."

Veda was silent for a long time before asking, "Do you still want to kill me?"


"If I wanted you dead, you wouldn't have gotten away yesterday."

Thinking about yesterday, Veda still felt a bit freaked out. She remembered that suffocating feeling all too well.

Veda gritted her teeth. "Alright, where do we meet?"

Emily said, "Remember the secret base John and I had? Let's meet there."

After hanging up, Emily took a taxi to Begonia Hill. Begonia Hill was covered in begonias, and below it was a fancy villa area.Emily had spent her first birthday there after she first moved into the Johnson Mansion. It was a gift from Calliope.Loving peace and quiet, Emily relished her time here during middle and high school. She had made this place her secret hideout, with security set up to recognize only four faces and fingerprints at the entrance.

Back then, she, Ella, and John would hang out there.

She wasn't close with Veda, so she never told her about the place, but John had brought her there. He even recorded Veda's fingerprints.

It had been three years since anyone had been there.

John was abroad, and Ella had been taken back by her family after she turned 18 and hadn't returned to Emerald City since. The villa was abandoned and covered in dust.


Emily didn't feel much for the place anymore. The happy memories now felt like a cruel joke.


She headed straight to the basement and checked on the little critter Harry had sent over. It looked starving.

She played with it for a bit, then went up to the small attic on the top floor of the villa, which was a control room.

The villa was decked out with surveillance inside and out. Emily turned on the monitoring equipment, and all the screens lit up.

Emily sat in a chair, waiting casually until a black Maybach rolled into view on the monitors. Aiden really spoiled Veda, even giving her this car. The car stopped in the courtyard. Veda looked at the villa jealously. She'd never forget how happy John and Emily used to be here. But John had never shown that kind of happiness around her. Today. Veda was dressed to impress in a knitted dress and a long beige wool coat,looking all elegant.

Soon,she was standing ouItside the control room, feeling a bit weird as she walked over.

All the doors to the other rooms had been removed, except for the control room.

But Veda didn't think too much about it and pushed open the ddoor.

Emily sat there, looking sharp in a black shirt and pants with a khaki trench coat, her long hair tied up, giving off a bit of a cold vibe.

Emily smiled slightly at her, looking stunning. "Veda, you're here."

Veda slowly approached Emily, looking all pitiful. "Emily, I can't handle John breaking up with me. I like him so much. Can you help me?"

Emily laughed, but her eyes were icy. "How do you want me to help?"

"Just tell John you don't like him and don't want him bothering you anymore,okay? You have James now, so please don't compete with me for John."

Veda suddenly dropped to her knees in front of Emily, tears streaming down her face.

She continued,"I know I did you wrong before." Emily still had her legs crossed, the smile on her face fading a bit. "Veda,after all these years, you still haven't kicked the habit of kneeling at every turn." Emily slowly bent down,grabbing Veda's chin. There were still bruises on Veda's neck from yesterday. Emily had been pretty rough.

Emily's fingers tightened, and Veda trembled, gasping in pain.

Seeing Veda's tears,Emily finally let go.

Veda sobbed. "I know it was wrong to take away your parents and boyfriend. Your parents raised me, and they always liked me. So they treat me like their real daughter. This isn't my fault."

"As for John, he's the only thing I feel guilty about taking from you,but I love him so much. Without him, I'd lose my mind. Emily, he's the love of my life."

Veda cried, tears streaming down her face.

In the past, to please Mia and Aiden, Emily might have been swayed by Veda's words and let it go. But now, she felt nothing.

Emily's tone was calm. "If you like John, you should pursue him openly.But you used dirty tricks. Do you deserve any sympathy? Is love obtained through deceit really love?"

Veda cried and laughed, her tone full of self-mockery. "Openly? Haha, how can I compete with you? Emily, do you know? Even though I've been with John for over ten years, as soon as you came back, all of John's attention went to you. I'm not even in his eyes anymore!" Veda felt utterly pathetic. Emily's gaze stayed cold. "So you want me violated?" Veda was stunned. Emotions surged in her tear-filled eyes.
###Chapter 91
Veda just now realized that Emily had been messing with her, trying to get a rise out of her the whole time.

If she had let her real feelings slip, she would've totaly blown her cover when she heard that line.


Good thing she kept her cool.

Veda put on her best innocent face and said, "Emily, what are you talking about? I just faked a divorce agreement, but I never meant to hurt you."

John had already figured out the secret from that phone call, but Veda knew that after three years, no one could find the record of that call. As long as she kept denying it, she'd be fine.

Emily stared at Veda, who was stilI playing innocent, with a cold glint in her eyes.

"Veda, I'm asking one last tíme. What did you do to me in our sophomore year?"

Veda looked at her, all confused, and said, "Emily, I have no idea what you're talking about."

Emily slowly stood up, towering over Veda, her presence downright scary,her clothes fluttering. "Veda, this is your last chance. Tell me how you set me up and who violated me, or else, don't blame me for what happens next!" Emily even remembered being locked up for about a week, but there was a blank spot in her memory. "It really wasn't me," Veda said, looking into her eyes, feeling a chill run down her spine. Sensing danger, Veda got up and tried to leave.

Emily just watched her go,feeling a bit amused.

She sat back down and looked at the surveillance cameras.

As soon as Veda left the attic,she heard some loud roars coming from the basement, making her heart race and her steps quicken.

Just as she stepped out of the villa, she saw two huge creatures in the yard,which made her shiver in fear.

They were two massive tigers, with fierce eyes, drooling mouths,growling lowly,clearly seeing her as prey.

Veda finally got why Emily let her go so easily-shecouldn't actually leave!

But why were there tigers here? They looked wild,with sharp claws,and their gaze locked directly on Veda.

Veda clung to the door, trembling all over. She was too scared to move.


And the two tigers were already charging towards her.

Veda turned and ran back. When she saw those rooms with their doors removed again, it finally clicked. Emily had planned this all along; she was trapping her like a rat in a cage. Stumbling and scrambling back upstairs, Veda tried to find Emily.Since Emily could bring tigers here, she must have a way to control them. But when Veda reached the attic, there was no sign of Emily, only the surveillance monitors still on, showing the tigers closing in on her.

In less than a minute, they'd surely find her by scent. But she had no idea where Emily was now.


Were there secret passages to escape from here?

She had to get away. Veda closed the attic door, blocking the tigers as they pounced. The roars outside were relentless.

Veda was shaking with fear. She didn't dare go out as she knew she couldn't outrun the tigers.

Luckily,the attic door was made of iron and could withstand the tigers'attacks.

Veda had a brief moment to catch her breath.

But the next second, a huge impact hit the door, causing the entire attic to shake.

She trembled all over. Her lips quivered and tears streamed down her face,terrified that she might die here.

But the sounds outside continued one after another.

Veda couldn't be sure if this door could resist the impact of two tigers. She hesitated for a few seconds, then suddenly realized she could call for help. But when she took out her phone, there was no signal. Veda seethed inwardly, 'Emily! You're ruthless! She would never have thought that the once cautious and somewhat timid Emily could become so cold-hearted one day.

What should she do now?

Veda stared at the last message on her phone, the one that she had sent John the address before she arrived, hoping he would come over so he could see how humiliated she was in front of Emily.

Maybe it could trigger John's protective instincts. John loved it when she relied on him. But before John could make it, the tigers came.

Just then, all the screens in the controlroom suddenly changed to show Emily,who was leisurely sitting in the yard.

Seeing her so relaxed, Veda screamed almost maniacally, "Emily! You dare to murder me! It's illegal."

Emily just smiled. "So what? I'm not afraid anyway."

Emily's tone was gentle when she said this, which made Veda feel extremely terrified.

Fear,terror,regret-all these emotions flooded Veda, almost causing her to collapse.

Veda had been pampered and sheltered since childhood, never encountering such a situation. It was a real threat to her life.

She had no doubt that Emily could really do it. Emily still smiled with a hint of darkness in her eyes. "You are ruthless,but I can be even more ruthless than you. They've been hungry for days,looking forward to a big meal. Maybe not even your bone will be left."Emily's voice echoed from all directions into her ears, along with the tigers clawing at the door outside.

Veda shrank in fear, feeling like she was in a huge hell, with Emily as the only savior.

Realizing the situation. Veda quickly apologized. "Emily, I was wrong. I won't compete with you for Mom and Dad anymore."


Veda knelt on the ground, crying bitterly. "I can give Mom and Dad back to you,and I can leave here forever. Please let me go."

At that moment. Veda suddenly heard a sound at the door.

The door had three locks. and the first lock was opened. The door shook even more violently.

Veda was slowto react, her brain momentarily stunned.

This door was fully automated and could be controlled remotely. Emily had a way to open it.

Veda heard the sharp scratching of the tiger's claws on the door. It made her physically uncomfortable.

Terrified, Veda shrank back, her gaze fixed on the screen.

Emily, with no hint of pity or urgency in her eyes, waved the remote control in her hand and pressed it again.

The tiger's claws reached in through the door crack. The roaring sounded as if it was right next to Veda's ear.
###Chapter 92

Veda anxiously wondered, her heart racing, "John, where the heck are you?



Emily's calm voice cut through the tension. "Veda, you totally deserve this."

"I'm counting to ten. If you don't spill the truth by then, I'm opening the door and letting the tigers have a snack."


"Ten..."

"Eight..."

Veda shivered, knowing Emily was dragging this out on purpose.

Emily wasn't even counting in order, just calling out numbers whenever she felt like it.


Veda realized begging wasn't gonna work, so she switched gears and started cursing.


"Emily, you can't treat me like this. Just because you're back, Mom and Dad don't care about me anymore. Even if you kill me, you'll end up in jail forever."

"Five."

Emily didn't even flinch. "Emily, please, I don't know anything. I'll give you back your parents. Just let me go." "Four." "I'm just jealous you're their real kid. Even without their love, you still have the Williams family. You've always been lucky."

"Ever since you came back, John's been all about you. I just wanted him back for a second."


"One."

As the last lock clicked open, Veda lunged at the door, but she was too weak. She watched in horror as the tiger's head poked through,jaws wide open.

If those tigers got in, she was done for. Emily had lost it completely.

Veda screamed, "It's Everett Harrison! Everett locked you up and raped you!"

A whistle blew, and the tigers reluctantly backed off, their growls still echoing.

Emily sat in the yard, eyes glued to the video of Veda.


Everett!

Emily's mind flashed to Everett's face. He was Lucas's neighbor and had tormented her since they were kids.

Everett always followed her around, calling her names with the other kids. Emily remembered clearly that after Lucas had locked her up for days, it was Everett who spread the rumor that Lucas had violated her. Back then, Emily wanted to kill him. The insults and slander went on until she was twelve, when the Johnson family took her in.

She hadn't seen Everett since. She only heard he went to prison for armed robbery.


She had no idea when he got out or how he got mixed up with Veda.

Thinking about it all, Emily trembled,her eyes bloodshot.

Emily asked, "Veda, how do you know Everett?"


Veda was terrified. Afraid the tigers would come back,she didn't catch what Emily had just said until she asked again.

Leaning against the door, Veda said weakly, "When I was sent back to Lucas's house, I met Everett. He kept harassing and threatening me. I was scared he'd expose to outsiders that I wasn't the real heiress and go to my parents..."


She went on, "So when Everett got out of prison that year and came threatening me, I told him where you were. I figured you'd stay put at the Williams Mansion, but I didn't think you'd fall for his lie about John and leave with him. With your skills, Everett shouldn't have been a problem,but I never expected you to get caught and imprisoned by him."

Emily clutched a whistle in her hand,nearly crushing it. She was trying hard to keep her anger in check, but inside, she was falling apart.

 She asked, "Veda, how did Everett get John's phone? You're trying to pin everything on Everett, but I know you had a hand in this. Don't think I'll buy your story." Taking a moment to think it over, Emily noticed many holes in Veda's story.

Veda hadn't even mentioned Philip. But why did she bring up Philip's name in the audio?


"Why did you say I was raped by Philip?"

"Philip favored you, and John has always been jealous of Philip. Philip's so outstanding that it makes John feel inferior. So if you had sex with Philip,it would make John hate you even more."

Emily sneered. "How much of what you're saying is even true?"

Veda kept shaking her head. "I can't lie to you now. Philip wasn't involved,it was all Everett. He even filmed a video, which I still have on my phone."


As she spoke, Veda shakily took out her phone and played the video for the room's camera.

In the video, Emily was unconscious on the ground,filmed by Everett's friend in a dark room.

Then Everett's sleazy voice could be heard. "You bitch, you've been ruined by Lucas long ago, and you're pretending to be innocent in front of me.Aren't you always on your high horse? Get up." He walked towards Emily on the ground and leaned over. Then the screen went black. Even though the image wasn't clear, Emily recognized Everett's voice.Lost in fear, Veda didn't even notice that the monitor's screen had long been cut off.

At that moment, there was a knock on the door. She thought it was Emily,ready to let her go.


But when she opened the door and saw who it was, Veda trembled fiercely.

"John, when did you get here?"

Veda's heart sank. She knew she was going to lose John forever.

John was heartbroken, filled with regret and remorse.

He dragged Veda out. "Emmy has been through so much. How could you treat her like this? Emmy never did anything to hurt you!"

She didIn't even fight Veda about her parents!

Veda was stil terrified. Even though John despised her, she relied on him as her lifeline.


Veda cautiously tried to approach him, and said with a grievance,"But Emily wants to kill me. She may have lost her innocence, but at least she's still alive. Now she wants my life..."

"Because you deserve to die!" Another cold voice cut in.

Veda turned her head and saw James.
###Chapter 93

James was still fuming about Emily spending the night at another man's place. He had a hunch she'd visit John at the hospital today,so he headed there to find her. In the hallway, he spotted John just as he was stepping out, which made him suspicious.

John had just undergone surgery, but he was stubbornly insisting on leaving, clearly a bad idea.


So,James decided to tag along.

When they got there, they saw Veda rushing into the attic.

They overheard everything Veda and Emily said during their confrontation.


James pieced together the whole story.

Turns out, John wasn't the one who took Emily's virginity. And everything Emily had gone through was just heartbreaking.

She never meant to hurt anyone, but it seemed like everyone was out to make her suffer.

Veda had plunged Emily into a living nightmare with her devious plans.Emily walked into the mansion and headed up to the attic. Veda was still on her knees. She looked up a bit, pleading with John, "John,I like you so much. Please save me! Emily really wants to kill me!" John was her last hope. Then Veda saw Emily, who looked like a demon straight out of hell. Emily stood in front of Veda, who shrank back.

The two tigers crouching at the doorway kept their sharp eyes on Veda,making her too scared to move.


She looked at Emily, begging for mercy. "Emily, I know I was wrong,but you know, Everett is a monster. He threatened me back then."

Emily squatted down, slowly grabbed her chin. "If you were scared,you could've called the cops and dealt with him, but Veda, you just played along. Everett was just a weapon in your hands."

Veda had used Everett's anger towards Emily to go after her.

With just a few words fromn Veda, an enraged Everett would do anything.

Veda could have changed things by calling the police after getting the video, but she hadn't done that.

Veda kept shaking her head. "I was really scared back then."

She looked at Emily in horror.

Emily lowered her eyes, like she was holding something back, her eyes bloodshot, but she was still stunning.

Emily had this crazy vibe about her.

She slowly stood up, took a step back, and blew the whistle in her hand. The tigers that were crouching suddenly stood up and walked straight towards Veda. John was startled when the tigers stood up. 
He'd been scared the whole time, but he was holding it in. After all, these were tigers,not kittens.


Veda trembled and quickly stepped back.

James stood calmly on the side, knowing Emily could control the tigers.
But he still stood in front of her, showing a protective stance.

His gaze fell lightly on Emily's face, which showed no fear.


Emily looked completely different from her usual self. There seemed to be an uncontrollable, volatile, and restrained alter egoin her heart.

She had severe empathy disorder and mild expressive disorder.She was walking a fine line between herself and a criminal.

Emily's expression was cold and numb.

James finally realized that Emily was seriously sick, with major psychological issues.

The tigers were getting closer, their eyes full of murder.

John finally snapped out of it. Under Veda's pleading gaze, he stood in front of Emily to protect her.

Seeing this, Veda was heartbroken. "John, how could you do this to me!"

The two tigers were getting closer. To Veda, Emily had lost it. "John, save me, for the sake of our three years together."John frowned,trying to stay calm, but he was struggling inside. This could really kill Veda.

He didn't want Emily to end up in jail. So he turned around and grabbed Emily's arm, his voice rough. "Emmy, let Veda go. If you kill her, you'll go to jail. Veda deserves it, but you don't need to do it yourself."

Emily slowly raised her eyelids to look at him. Only then did John notice the emptiness in her eyes.

Emily said,"Then you can die with her."

John was stunned. He looked at James. "Hurry up and stop Emily. Are you really going to let her kill Veda?"

James coldly replied, "If this helps her vent, then let her do it.With me here, no one will arrest her."

In other words, he would cover for Emily.

John suddenly felt like they were all losing it.

One of the tigers had already pounced on Veda, and her screams pierced the air. John's expression was slipping.

The tiger opened its mouth, and just as it was about to get close to Veda's neck. Emily blew the whistle again.

The tiger backed off.

After retreating to Emily's side, the tigers scared John away, nudging Emily's leg with their heads, almost like they were seeking approval.

Emily raised her hand and petted their heads.

She said indifferently, "They've been trained and won't hurt humans." Veda was pale with fear.John let out a heavy sigh of relief.

James just smirked. He knew all along that these tigers were just for show.They had been tamed and always kept indoors.

The anticipated pain didn't come, but when the tiger's gaping mouth appeared in front of her eyes, Veda was truly scared to the point of almost passing out. It was terrifying.

Emily glanced at Veda. "Veda, leave the country and never come back;otherwise, I can't guarantee I won't kill you."

She was tired of fighting with Veda.

Emily turned and left, with James by her side, and the two tigers trailing behind her.


John pulled Veda up. "Leave the country. I'll have someone watch over you."

Veda was terrified. "No, you can't do this to me!"

If she left the country, she would lose everything-Aiden and Mia, John,and the Johnson Group.

Emily returned from Begonia Hill Villas without saying a word. He didn't go to work either, afraid something might happen to Emily.

Emily couldn't eat or sleep, feeling like her illness was getting worse.

After years of being haunted by the nightmare.she finally uncovered the heart-wrenching truth: she had been violated by a despicable bastard.

On the fourth evening. Emily finally came out of her room,looking haggard.
###Chapter 94

James had been hanging out by the door. When he saw Emily step out,his eyes lit up. But before he could say anything, Emily blurted out,"James,I'm starving."

He felt a wave of relief wash over him.

James scooped her up, carried her to the kitchen, and set her down on a chair."I'll whip up something fresh. Just hang tight."

James was in his comfy home clothes, which made him look more relaxed.

But he was also wearing this silly little tiger apron. The tiger wasn't fierce like the ones from a few days ago; it was more on the cute side. And the apron was way too small for him.

It made him look kind of ridiculous, but it didn't take away from his good looks. If anything, it made him look even cuter.

The golden evening sun streamed in through the window, casting a warm glow on James. It was like a scene from a painting.

Emily walked over barefoot, slowly approached James, hugged him from behind, and said, "James, I suddenly don't feel hungry anymore. I think you're more appetizing."She nuzzled against the back of his neck, kissing and nibbling affectionately. James felt tears on the back of his neck but didn't say anything until she bit him. She turned his face towards her and kissed him on the lips. James's eyes darkened, and he heard Emily say softly, "James, I've never seen you cry."

James felt a bit helpless. "Do you want to see me cry?"

Emily blinked but stayed silent. She could see his face turning red.

"Emily,if you keep this up, you'll be the one crying later."

Emily quickly let go of him.

She hadn't eaten or slept for three days; her body was too weak for intimacy right now.

Emily raised her hands in surrender, smiling. "You cook first. I'm really hungry."


There was porridge simmering on the stove,so he served her a bowl first.

After finishing the porridge, Emily felt warmer and more comfortable.

Dinner wwas all her favorites, but the flavors were mild.


James didn't want her to get an upset stomach from anything too strong.

James kept watching Emily as she ate.

She looked the same as usual, like she had already bounced back. She had been through so much. The past was a constant knife wound;it cut deep with every step she took towards the present. Her foster parents and biological parents didn't love her. Behind her sunny exterior were hidden scars. Emily had never shown her true self to him.

Her emotions and feelings were all a front.

"Emmy, I'm sorry," James said suddenly, making Emily pause.

Her mind raced. "Do you have someone else?"

James lost his cool and said, a bit exasperated, "Emily!"

Emily chuckled, then got serious. "James, I need you to help me find someone."


James took a deep breath and said, "Everett,right?"

At the mention of Everett, Emily's fingers tightened, and she nodded.

"I want him to spend his whole life in prison!"

These past days, Emily had been thinking about this, but she couldn't dwell on it forever.

What happened to her wasn't her fault.

The real culprits were the abuasers, and they had to pay for what they did.

Even if it meant testifying in court, she was ready. These jerks couldn't get away with it.

James, with a blank expression, said, "Everett's already dead." 
Emily was stunned. "Did you do it?" James looked up and slowly shook his head. "No,he died three years ago."He continued, "Two days after your incident, they found Everett's body in an abandoned steel factory. The cops called it a suicide. He had no family,and there were no clues at the scene."


Emily frowned,feeling something was off about Everett's death.

But there was no point in digging any deeper.

Emily sneered. "Well, serves him right."

James sighed. "Everett's gone. You need to let this go and stop torturing yourself."


James had been looking into Emily's condition and was really worried.

Emily, dealing with affective disorders, depression, and mania, seemed carefree, but he knew she was in a lot of pain.

James took her hand. "I know it's hard to let go, but I'll always be here for you. Emily, I won't ever let go of your hand."

Emily furrowed her brows, slowly pulling her hand back. "James, don't say that. It makes me misunderstand."

She couldn't love anyone.

Emily smiled again. "With our relationship, saying that is pointless."

James sighed inwardly. If he pushed it, she might want to distance herself again. James pressed his lips together and finally said, "Fine, we'll do it your way.



Life seemed to go back to normal after that.

Veda was still causing trouble, not wvanting to go abroad, but John was firm.

There was trouble at the Johnson Group, like some force was putting pressure on them.

After Veda reluctantly went abroad, the crisis at the Johnson Group was resolved.

Veda was in a bad mood, so Mia went to take care of her for a while.

Emily didn't know if she should be sad about this, but life had to go on.

However, Emily noticed her insomnia was geting worse, and the sleeping pills Gerald prescribed weren't enough anymore.
If it were a wound, it would scab over and heal.

But insomnia was like a worm burrowing into her bones, crawling in the cracks every night,causing pain, exhaustion, and irritability.
In this situation, Emily had to go back to Gerald.

In the counseling room, Gerald looked at her lying lazily on the couch.

Emily said, "Dr. Rivera, why can't I sleep?"

She closed her eyes wearily, but sleep wouldn't come. Her brain and body were both screaming.


Gerald said softly, "Emily, dwelling too much on the past can harm you and others, and you've been exhausting yourself."

Emily casually replied, "I really don't care anymore."


Gerald knew everything that had happened and asked, "You really don't care?"


Emily didn't answer, her eyes turning cold.
###Chapter 95

Gerald flashed her a grin. "Ms. Johnson, why not just open up to the person you like?"

Emily was taken aback and blurted out, "What is this feeling called 'liking'someone?"


Gerald squinted, realizing Emily's confusion about her feelings was pretty serious.


Emily said, "I can tell you anything, and you know everything about me."

Gerald gave a small smile, but there was a hint of helplessness in his eyes."Emily, I'm just your doctor. Talking to me doesn't count as opening up.You need to open your heart to the one you love."


Emily smiled bitterly. She had forgotten what it felt like to like someone,let alone love.


After Emily was taken back to the Johnson Mansion, she learned to hide her feelings and acted obediently.


Emily mimicked Veda's acting cute and her cuddling up for attention towards Mia and Aiden. But there was still a barrier between them.

However, Wilder and Calliope were different. They accepted everything about her without forcing her to be exceptional.It was a completely selfless emotionalinvestment. But she couldn't go to the Williams family. In the past, Emily's first thought might have been John. Now it wasn't him anymore.

Ella?

She was far away in Starry Capital.

That left only one person, James. Since when did she feel that James was someone she could trust and rely on?

Gerald knew Emily well and said directly, "Sometimes, you have to seize the opportunity."


Emily looked up and chuckled. "Dr. Patterson, then you better give me some medicine. I can't figure out my feelings for James right now."

"And you've been keeping him around for three years?"

The biggest mistake Emily made in her life was keeping James.

James appeared noble and aloof in public, but in front of her, he was cautious and gentle.

Sometimes Emily felt that even if her illness was severe,she would inevitably fall bit by bit in James's tenderness.

Emily needed a place to heal. So even though Emily considered ending this abnormal relationship every day, she never really said it out loud because she couldn't bear to.Gerald looked calmly at Emily. "He might be your remedy. You should dare to give it a try. As for medicine, it's better to take less." Emily sighed. "You know he's from the Smith family." "Would you really be afraid of that? " Emily was particularly candid. "Of course, I'm afraid..."

Starry Capital was a dangerous place, let alone the Smith family. It was even more treacherous.


Emily didn't want to live in fear every day, and if she really was with James, that would be inevitable.

"Do you love him?"

Emily paused, the silence hanging heavy. After a moment,she said,"Well...
I do. It seems unfair to him,right?"

She felt a mix of bitterness and fear.

GeraldI looked at her with pity. Emily's ambivalence towards emotions was even more severe than she had imagined.

She couldn't even see her own heart clearly.

Gerald bent down, his hand on her side, and said softly, "Emily, try to forget all the hurt and just think about James. Now tell me, do you love him?"


"I do. I love him very much."

Emily's eyes were clouded with confusion, but her voice was steady.

When John came back, she insisted on breaking up with James because she had this gut feeling that she would completely fall for him later. She was getting more and more hooked on James's warmth. This made Emily start to waver. So she thought it was better not to have it in the first place. Later,she moved back to Crystal Valley Manor.

It was because she didn't want to losecontrol and lash out in front of John.Plus, James could hold her back and keep her rational.

James was truly her remedy.

On the surface, there were three rules for James, but in reality, only Emily knew in her heart that she was setting rules for herself.

Emily kept remninding herself that they would eventually part ways.

So there was always a vague barrier between them.

Gerald stood up straight.

Emily suddenly snapped out of it and said, "Dr. Patterson, I know you're good,but try not to hypnotize me."

Emily pinched her brow.

It was different when someone forced their way into her heart versus when she chose to share her emotions willingly.

Being hypnotized felt like having her heart dissected, comnpletely exposed to the sunlight.

Emily stood up,grabbed her bag, and left directly.

Gerald's voice came from behind. "Where are you going?" Emily smiled. "I can't waste the hypnosis you gave me. While I'm feeling something for James right now, I'll share my feelings with him." For the first time, Emily declared this kind of liking out loud. There was afaint excitement in her heart.

She wanted to hold James's heart and be with him.

She wanted to tell him, "James, I love you."

She just wanted him to know her feelings. She didn't want to see the disappointment in his eyes again.

She drove recklessly and soon arrived at the Golden Birch Group.

Emily walked in openly.

Just out of the elevator, she saw Anais, who was stunned.

Emily didn't want to talk to her at all,so she just walked past her to find James.


But Anais suddenly followed and stood in front of her. "Emily, what are you doing here?"


Emily raised an eyebrow, her voice tinged with laziness. "I'm here to see my boyfriend."

When Anais heard that, she lost her mind.

James had already made it clear that he was breaking off the engagement with the Allen family and even compensated them, leaving them with nothing to say but to agree. Besides, most of the resources of the Smith family were in James's hands,so they didn't dare to object. Anais, seeing Emily, naturally redirected her anger towards her,even though she knew that this matter had little to do with Emily. She was jealous.

Why did James have to fall for Emily? What qualities did Emily have besides being pretty!

Men were so shallow!

Trembling, Anais pointed at Emily. "You're already married to John. Why are you still clinging to James? Why are you so shameless!"

Anais only knew that Emily had been married before, but John loved Veda.So she thought Emily was fooling around outside with a twisted mind.
###Chapter 96

Anais was fuming. "How can you even think you're good enough for James? You're just a slut, dreaming of being Mrs. Smith. It's laughable!"

Emily, on the other hand, stayed calm and even smiled a bit. "Why don't you take the Mrs. Smith title then?"


Anais, caught off guard, blurted out, "Sure."

Emily raised an eyebrow, clearly amused. "James, looks like you've certainly got your fair share of female pursuers. One Mrs. Smith might not be enough to handle all that charm."


Anais froze, realizing James was right behind her. He walked over to Emily,wrapped an arm around her waist, and pulled her close, giving Anais a cold stare.


"But you're the one who's not keen on being Mrs. Smith," he said to Emily with a hint of grievance.

Anais was stunned. She clenched her teeth, glaring at Emily. She knew Emily had lured her into speaking harshly, knowing James was listening.

Anais rolled her eyes, frustrated. She wanted to make a good impression on James but hesitated, feeling a bit defeated.


Without Eric around, she didn't dare to act out in front of James. His patience with her was only because of Eric. Anais believed Emily and James were just using each other,with no real feelings involved.
 She muttered, "Emily,just wait." Anais stormed off, leaving Emily to smile helplessly. "She's kind of cute when she's mad," Emily said.


James looked puzzled. "Cute? She was insulting you."

Emily shrugged. "People who don't know me always do."

She was used to it by now. To her, Anais's anger was almost endearing.

Emily followed James back to his office. He checked the time; it was three in the afternoon. "Shouldn't you be at the Williams Group?"


As soon as James sat down, Emily wrapped her arms around his neck and settled onto his lap, her hips pressing against him.


She knew exactly how to get him going. She could feel his arousal even through their clothes.

She kissed him, and he tried to keep a straight face, though his ears turned red. "Ms. Johnson, behave yourself."

Emily ignored him, undoing his belt and unzipping his pants, her hand moving up and down his length.

She bit his lip playfully. "You like this, don't you?"

James couldn't resist any longer. He pulled her closer, her breasts pressing against his chest.

The room's temperature seemed to rise. Emily'scheeks flushed.

James's lips brushed her ear. "I like it a lot."

They kissed passionately, their clothes becoming more and more disheveled, as James's hands roamed over her body. "So, what brings you here?" James asked, knowing she wouldn't just drop by without a reason. He had a feeling something was up with Emily.

Emily chuckled to herself; she had come here especially to confess her feelings.


"James,I..."

Just then, James's phone rang, cutting her off. The ringtone was different,not his usual one. It must have been set for someone special.

James didn't plan to answer. "What were you going to say?"

He looked at Emily intently, his arousal evident.

Emily wasn't in a rush. She handed him the phone. "You should take this.
"

She noticed the contact name: Sunny.

James glanced at the phone, then lifted Emily onto the desk,kissed her,and stepped aside to answer the call.

This was the first time James had taken a call away from her.

Emily's gut told her Sunny was a girl and someone important to James.

A few minutes later, James returned, looking composed. He straightened his tie,appearing neat. "So, what were you saying?" James acted normal, not explaining the call. Emily asked, "Who's Sunny?" James smiled. "She's my niece. She's in some trouble and needs my help." But Emily sensed James was a bit off.

James pulled her close again, nuzzling her neck. "You still haven't told me why you came."

Interrupted, Emily lost her enthusiasm. It felt cheesy now.

She kissed him. "I'll tell you tonight."

James looked a bit disappointed. "But I want to know now. I have to go back to Starry Capital tonight."

Emily was surprised. "So soon?"

James nodded, looking serious. "Yes, I need to handle it personally."

He looked at her. "Or you could come with me, for a change of scenery. I worry you won't sleep well alone."

Emily shook her head. "I've been on leave from work for quite a while. I can't keep taking advantage of the Williams family. I'll stay in Emerald City and wait for you, my little princess."

She pinched his cheek affectionately.

James sensed something was off. He rubbed against her, asking softly, "Are you sure you won't tell me?"
Emily shook her head. James looked at her with puppy eyes. She gave him a deep kiss,and he seemed satisfied. Emily quickly returned to the Williams Group, her mind racing. From James's expression, it seemed Sunny's issue was serious. That evening, Emily got back to empty Crystal Valley Manor.She had just stepped into the bathroom when her teacher called.

Harry's voice was cold and stern, with a hint of menace. "Emmy, there's a problem with the formula at the research institute in Starry Capital. Go check it out and deal with whoever's involved-no mercy.”
###Chapter 97

Getting Harry, usually so calm and collected, to say something that intense,Emily knew this was serious.


Emily, who was in charge of the company's perfume development,usually didn't bother with other projects. Harry knew this, but he still asked her to step in.


That meant the person running thingsat Starry Capital couldn't be trusted anymore.

Emily didn't hesitate to agree.

Harry added, "I've got a private jet ready for you. Thanks, Emmy."

Early the next morning, Emily landed at the biggest estate in Starry Capital on the private jet.

As soon as she got off, someone was there to grab her luggage and escort her inside.

Emily said casually, "I've already booked a hotel, so no need to trouble yourselves."

"Understood."

The estate owner wasn't around, but the staff were well-trained. They didn'
t talk much, didn't ask questions, and were super respectful. Emily took a car from the garage and drove off. Both she and James were swamped. They didn't chat much or get in each other's way. After wrapping up her work, Emily reported back to Harry. Then she got a call.

"Emmy, did you go to Starry Capital?"

It was Wilder on theline.

Emily smiled, "Yeah, I'm here for some business. I'll be back soon."


"Hold on, someone wants to see you."

"Who?" Emily was quite confused about who needed to go through Wilder to see her.

Wilder hesitated, "It's someone from Quigr. Actually, I think they're from the Smith family using Quigr as a cover."

Emily knew her relationship with James wouldn't stay hidden from the Smith family forever, but she didn't expect it to come up so soon.

Wilder added, "I'm just checking with you first. It's yourcall if you want to meet them."

Wilder knew she didn't like mixing personal stuff with business.

Emily didn't want to make it hard for him. "Dad, just give me the time and place. I'll go."

The meeting was set at Quigr's headquarters, which was super fancy.

When she arrived, the general manager even gave her a tour. There weren't many customers. Each jewelry piece was showcased beautifully. Emily noticed each designer's name was highlighted,and they were all world-famous.

Only Quigr could pull off something like this.

The general manager led Emily to the VIP lounge and asked her to wait a bit.


Emily waited for about three or four minutes, wondering which Smith family member wanted to see her.

She decided to call James first. She tried three times, but he didn't pick up.


Soon, the door opened. A middle-aged woman walked in, and Emily stood up nervously.


It was Nicole Smith, James's older sister, who had a bad relationship with him.


The Smith family's secrets were hard for outsiders to know.

Nicole was over forty but still looked elegant and classy. She wore a black professional suit, giving off a gentle vibe.

Nicole had her long hair up, adorned with a gemstone hair clip worth a fortune. Most people would keep something like that locked away, but Nicole wore it out in the open.

She was dressed head-to-toe in high-end custom-made clothing.

But with no jewelry on her wrists, ears, or neck, she looked clean and sharp.

Emily greeted her, "Ms. Smith, I've heard so much about you She reached out to shake Nicole's hand.

Nicole's gaze was sharp as she glanced at Emily.

Nicole smiled faintly, shook hands briefly, and then pulled her hand back. "You're James's girlfriend, so just call me Nicole like he does."

Emily stayed respectful and calm. "Since you're an elder, I can't be disrespectful, so I'll stick with Ms. Smith."

Nicole didn't mind. "As you wish."

Nicole walked in and casually sat on the sofa, and someone closed the door behind her.


She and Emily chatted casually, "Is this your first time in Starry Capital?"

Emily shook her head. "No, I've been here a few times on business trips."

"Do you like it here?"

"Not particularly." Emily smiled calmly.

This answer surprised Nicole.

Starry Capital was prosperous and magnificent, aplace where many people came and didn't want to leave. It was unusual to hear someone say they didn't like it.

Yet. Emily's humble attitude made Nicole feel it was just her personal preference,nothing offensive.

This response left Nicole momentarily lost for words.

Nicole smiled, "Starry Capital is enchanting and glamorous.and many people come and never want to leave. You are quite unique."

Emily smiled and continued, "Ms. Smith, it's not that they don't want to leave. There are plenty of ordinary people who had to struggle to stay here for money and their dreams. The world is so big; there's always somewhere bustling."


Seeing Emily's confident demeanor, Nicole showed a hint of admiration in her eyes. She smiled lightly. "You remind me of my younger self. I quite like you."


Emily still maintained a bit of distance. "Thank you for your kind words.I am not worthy of being compared to you."

Emily could guess Nicole probably wanted her to leave James.


The Smith family's influence was overwhelming, and it was not easy to get in.


She came to Starry Capital on Harry's private jet, and Nicole was able to find out, even subtly get to her through Wilder.

The power of the Smith family was truly formidable.

However,during this conversation, Emily didn't suffer any losses.

Nicole said, "It's getting late. Ms. Johnson, if you're free, let's go to the Majestic Palace Hotel for dinner." Emily was a bit tired of the food at the Majestic Palace Hotel but nodded in agreement. At the Majestic Palace Hotel, each dish was carefully crafted by top chefs in the world, using the finest ingredients and blending innovative and
traditional cooking techniques. The meal here was not just food, but also a visual and gustatory feast, allowing guests to indulge in the art of deliciousness in a luxurious environment.

And only people with special status were qualifiedto dine there.

At the entrance, after Nicole had entered. Emily was stopped by the security guard.


There was a new guard who didn't recognize her. Emily didn't bother giving her name, sensing that Nicole was deliberately trying to humiliate her. Just as she was about to leave, Nicole's assistant came over.

"Ms. Johnson, this is an invitation from Ms. Smith for you. Tonight is the birthday banquet of the daughter of the Mellon Family; it's more suitable for you there. Ms. Smith also mentioned that she couldn't make it and asked you for the favor of bringing a bouquet of flowers."
###Chapter 98

The assistant barely gave Emily a chance to say no.

Heading to Mellon Manor was fine. Emily had been in Starry Capital for days without reaching out to Ella, and she wasn't even sure if Ella was home.


Ella had always been in Emerald City because she was the Mellon Family's illegitimate daughter. The Mellons weren't too keen on letting her into the family tree, so they didn't let her use the Mellon name.

Because of that, Ella never felt like she belonged with the Mellons.

Ella didn't care much for the Mellon Family, but her mom did.

Five years ago, Ella had no choice but to come back, but she still didn't get added to the family tree or change her name.

Emily made her way to Mellon Manor. At the gate, she handed over her invitation and was let in, carrying a big, beautiful bouquet of mixed flowers.


Once inside, itwas like stepping into another world.

The yard was decked out with colored lights and balloons. Long tables were loaded with food, waiters were walking around with trays of wine,and the hottest singer was performing. The place was already packed with guests. Emily stood there, not recognizing anyone. She decided to call Ella. "Hey, miss me?" Ella teased. Emily grinned. "Where are you?" Ella sounded a bit bored. "I'm at home. My dad won't let me out, afraid I'll cause trouble."

Emily said casually, "Come down."

Ella thought she misheard. "What did you say?"

"Come down to the entrance and get me. Your house is too big, and I can't find you."


Ella sat up in bed. "You're at my house?"

She didn't even bother changing clothes and came down in her pajamas,drawing curious looks along the way.

"Who is that? How can she show up at Ms. Mellon's birthday party in pajamas?"


"Don't you know? She's Sunny Mellon's cousin. She's wild and untamed,just like the rumors say."

"But I just think she's so pretty."

"She must be a cold one. She's pretty tall, isn't she? Too bad she's not a model."


"I wish she could sign with my company." Ella's eyes lit up. She hurried over to Emily, slightly out of breath. "Why'd you come all of a sudden? I thought I was dreaming."

Emily opened her arms, smiling. "Ella, give me a hug."

In the next moment, Ella pulled Emily into a tight embrace.

"Emmy, I mised you so much."

"Ella, I missed you too."

The two of them were quite the sight, drawing curious looks from everyone around.

After a brief hug, Ella let go of Emily and took her upstairs.

Ten minutes later, they were back in Ella's room, away from the chaotic gossip outside.

Ella had always been a controversial figure at Mellon Manor.

She lay in Emily's arms, playing with the flowers, and said, "Why didn't you tell me you were coming to Starry Capital? If I'd known, I would've definitely picked you up."

"I came over on a whim, wasn't sure if you'd be home."

Ella grinned. "Are these flowers for me? You always have great taste."

Emily shook her head. "Nope, I was asked to deliver them to today's star."

Ella's smile faded, her voice turning icy. "Who asked you?"

Emily sensed something was off. She blinked and said, "Ms. Nicole Smith."Emily knew she wasn't in charge of Quigr. Ella grabbed the flowers and tossed them straight into the trash.

"Ella?" Emily looked at her,puzzled.

Ella turned around and poured two glasses of red wine. Her silk pajamas,
a long nightgown, highlighted her tall figure.

Wearing it, she had an air of cold elegance.

Ella's long hair flowed down to her waist like a waterfall, and every move she made was graceful.

She handed a glass to Emily, then leaned against her, saying, "If I hadn't thrown those flowers away, there would've been trouble today. Didn't you notice? There isn't a single flower in this huge garden."


She continued, "That's because Sunny is allergic to pollen and has asthma.If you had brought those flowers, you would've had a rough time today."

Ella glanced at her, lightly poking her forehead with her fingertip."After all these years, you still haven't learned to be smart and avoid being used by others."

Emily's expression grew serious. A lot of thoughts raced through her mind.


Ella mentioned that today's birthday party was for Sunny MTellon.

Was this the girl she had seen noted as on James's phone?

It couldn't be a coincidence. Emily frowned. "Why would Nicole do this? It's really low to pull something like this on me, being younger and all." Ella sighed. "It's a love-hate thing you wouldn't imagine." Ella began to explain.

The Smith family and the Mellon Family were originally united through a marriage alliance-Nicole and Keith Mellon.

They had a son, Oscar Mellon. But shortly after Oscar was born,they divorced.


After the divorce, despite everyone's objections, Keith married his current wife,Betty Nelson.


And Betty had a daughter, Sunny, who was a month older than Oscar at that time.


In other words, during their marriage, Keith had been keeping a mistress!

So despite the divorce, Nicole still wanted to destroy Betty and Sunny!

Betty was just an ordinary employee without background. If Keith hadn't been protecting them, they would have been done for long ago.

Emily's mouth twitched as she listened.

Although she had only briefly interacted with Nicole, it was clear that Nicole was a very strong-willed person. How could she tolerate such betrayal?

Ella took another sip of her drink. And she continued, "Sunny was almost kidnapped on the street yesterday,most likely also Nicole's doing." Emily seemed to understand something all of a sudden. "Is Sunny okay?" "She got some minor injuries, otherwise she wouldn't have held the birthday party."

Ella continued with a smile, "You don't need to worry about Sunny. With her strong background, she might even marry into the Smith family in the future. By then, Nicole will be furious."

Emily was stunned for a moment but kept her cool. "James is backing her,right?"
###Chapter 99

Ella blurted out. "Do you know James?"

Emily's eyes flickered a bit. Instead of answering, she shot back, "What's their deal?"


Ella shrugged, resting her head on Emily's thigh, and lazily replied,"What else? They're just dating."


Ella scratched Emily's chin and saíd, "Nicole and James? They're practically enemies. Before James took over the company, Nicole almost got him killed a few times. Lucky for him, he managed to escape."

Emily's heart was racing as she listened.

Ella continued, "Besides handing over the Smith Group to James,there's also Sunny. Nicole hates Betty and Sunny, and James has been helping them out. so he's totally against her."

Emily said, "But James is still her brother."

Ella replied. "In rich families, relationships are pretty shaHow,especially since the Smith family is the top dog in Starry Capital's big four families.The Patterson family moved abroad, and even combined, the Allen and Mellon families can't compete with the Smiths." Ella clicked her tongue."Emmy, think about how loaded and powerful the Smith family is! It's a huge pie and everyone wants a slice, James is tough and ruthless; otherwise, he wouldn't have survived in this position." Emily's brows furrowed as she listened.Ella suddenly noticed something was off. "Emmy, you used to hate gossip. Why are you so interestedin the Smith family today?"

Ella was puzzled.

Suddenly, colorful fireworks lit up the sky outside. The bright red fireworks burned in the sky, lingering for a long time.

Ella pulled her to the window to watch.


Ella saw Emily lost in thought and pulled her outside, saying, "It should be more immersive to watch from the yard."


The fireworks reminded Emily of her birthday, on the top floor of Celestial Cuisine, where the same fireworks had lit up the sky.


The once heart-pounding feeling was like a huge bubble that burst unexpectedly in her heart.

The fireworks lasted for half an hour, painting the entire sky in a deep red hue.


Their reflection glittered in her eyes, but her heart was sinking.

After the fireworks ended, the whole yard finally came alive. In a huge table,gifts were laid out in an impressive display.

Emily finally saw Sunny, a very intellectual beauty.

She was carefully raised by the prestigious family since childhood,every move and smile perfect. She looked a bit pale, appearing fragile like a delicate glass doll. Emily and Ella were a bit far from the excitement, but they could still hear the conversations. "Sunny, isn't Mr. Smith coming?"

"Sunny, we really admire that you reached the top so quickly. I heard Mr.Smith has given you a lot of resources. You're definitely going to be a top star in the future."

"Sunny, you're totally going to be Mrs. Smith someday. Look at how Mr.Smith spoils you. These fireworks are charged by the second. Every year on your birthday, he sets them off just for you. Whoelse in the city gets that kind of treatment?"

Sunny blushed instantly, feeling a bit embarrassed. "Don't talk nonsense.Uncle James and I aren't like that."

"Why do you still call him Uncle James? Anais has the nerve to call him by his name."

Sunny earnestly replied, "Uncle Jamesis just my uncle. He only sees me as a niece."


There was a commotion nearby.

Someone said, "Sunny, Mr. Smith is here."


The crowd around Sunny automatically made way.

James headed straight for her.

He was dressed in a sharp suit, with a cold face and a remarkable demeanor. With each step he took, the air seemed to chilla bit.

James exuded a daunting aura, or else the socialites around would probably scream.

People around greeted him, but James's gaze was fixed on Sunny. If he looked up, he could have seen Emily not far away.

However, James just casually responded and said to the people in front of him, "Sunny, happy birthday."

Sunny was visibly delighted, looking at James with sparkling eyes.

"I brought you a birthday gift. See if you like it."

James raised his hand slightly, and Ryan stepped forward, presenting a red velvet box and carefully opening it.

The jewelry quietly lying in the box instantly caught everyone's attention.

Ryan even took out a set, leaving everyone stunned.

Someone exclaimed, "These sapphires belonged to a queen in the Middle Ages. This set, including a crown, earrings, necklace, brooch, and bracelet,was auctioned off at the world's top auction house for 8 billion dollars.So this is the gift Mr. Smith gave Sunny!"

"It's so romantic. My goodness! No wonder he's at the top of the rich list!"Sunny was so moved that tears almost welled up in her eyes. She couldn't
believe it as she looked at James.

"Uncle James, this gift is too precious. I can't accept it."

James smiled, his eyes full of indulgence. "It's nothing to me. As long as you like it; just take it."

Of course, Sunny liked it. She felt like crying, her eyes moist.

People around cheered, "Mr. Smith, help Sunny put it on." "Yes, Sunny will look great wearing it."

James picked up the crown and placed it on Sunny's head. Then he gently lifted her long hair and put on the necklace.

After putting them on, James even took care to adjust her hair.

Sunny smiled, her dimples showing, making her exceptionally charming.

Emily observed all these scenes. A sarcastic smile suddenly appeared on her lips.

It turned out that going to the auction house was not for her birthday gift,but for Sunny's.

Encouraged by Gerald, she had even planned to confess to James.Fortunately, the words hadn't yet left her lips.

But why did her heart ache?
###Chapter 100

Ryan strolled over to James and whispered something in his ear, making James's face change. He then turned to Sunny and said, "I gotta make a call."


Once he left, everyone started showering Sunny with even more compliments.

Sunny blushed and looked down.

Emily's phone buzzed. She glanced at it and then ignored the call.

Just then, Anais showed up and the vibe totally shifted.

Anais was late because the Mellon family hadn't even bothered to invite her; she had found a way to get an invitation elsewhere.

As soon as Anais walked in, everyone started talking about how James gave Sunny an eight billion dollar birthday gift, treating her like royalty.

Anais's jealousy got the best of her. She stormed up to Sunny, who was decked out in jewelry, and snapped, "Sunny, take all this off right now!"
Sunny's friends sneered at Anais, saying, "These are gifts from Mr. Smith.Who do you think you are to tell her to take them off?"
"James is my fiancé. Why is he giving you such expensive gifts? Take them off now!"

Anais was about to rip the jewelry off Sunny. She was fuming.

The crowd laughed and teased, "Anais, are you dreaming? Everyone knows Sunny is Mr. Smith's favorite. Haven't you heard he called off the

engagement ages ago? He did it to give Sunny a proper status. You better know your place."

The Allen family had Eric, who, while not as dominant as James, was still a big deal among the rich kids.

This made the Allen family overshadow the Mellon Family.

But with Sunny, James's favorite, the Mellon Family commanded considerable respect in social circles.

Anais was shaking with anger.

Thinking of something, she suddenly blurted out,"Favorite? No way. Mr.Smith has a girlfriend in Emerald City. Sunny,how can you compare to her?"

The room went silent for a moment.

Then someone pointed at Anais and said, "Anais, what are you talking about? Mr. Smith hasn't had any romantic rumors for years. How could he have a girlfriend? You can't just make stuff up because Mr.Smith doesn't like you."

"Anais. Mr. Smith is right over there. Dare to say it to his face when he comes back?"
Anais found it absurd. These people were usually so meek around her,but today they were acting tough because Sunny had James backing her up.

Now everyone was demanding answers from Anais.

Anais regretted not taking photos or videos when she was in Emerald City to show these people how James spoiled Emily!


Feeling the pressure, Anais stepped back.

She was about to leave when she actually saw Emily.

Anais rubbed her eyes, thinking she was seeing things.

But it was true, the person standing not far away was indeed Emily!

That stunning face was so beautiful it took her breath away. Emily was a beauty she would never forget!

Back in the day, Anais would've wanted to scratch Emily's face off, but now she just felt oddly relieved.

Anais smirked, a glint of satisfaction in her eyes. "Mr. Smith's girlfriend is here today too."

The crowd thought Anais was just trying to save face and laughed at her.

But Anais stood her ground. She extended a slender finger,pointing directly at the girl across the yard. "She's right there!"

Everyone followed Anais's finger and looked over.

For a moment, everyone held their breath, captivated by the woman's stunning beauty.

But her gaze was sharp as a blade, cutting through the smoky courtyard.She exuded an air of superiority and indifference.
Her features were flawless, her long hair tied back, dressed in a professional suit with a coat on top.Among the elegantly dressed socialites,she seemed out of place, yet breathtakingly beautiful.
Emily glanced down at her phone, where James was still calling her.She


answered the call but didn't speak.

She walked towards Anais.

Raising an eyebrow, Anais exclaimed, "It's her. She's Mr. Smith's girlfriend!"

Anais thought those who mocked her should get a taste of their own medicine.


Just then, James returned, and those who knew him well could tell his steps were unsteady.

The yard fell into an unusual silence.

Seeing James, Anais went straight up to him. "James, how could you bring your girlfriend here? Aren't you afraid of upsetting Sunny?"

James's face darkened, his gaze locking onto Emily across from him.

He clenched his fists. An intimidating aura surrounded him.


No one dared to speak.

Ella then walked up to Emily, her eyes wide with shock.

Some heiresses from prominent families were truly irrational, always gossiping and plotting how to win over James. Ella saw Anais as one of them and had no appetite for her games.

But she justsaid Emily was James's girlfriend.


What a joke!

But Emily neither confirmed nor denied it. Ella looked at Emily with clear eyes.


There was no hint of a smile on Emily's lips; her demeanor cold,similar to when she found out about John's betrayal.

Ella touched Emily's hand, which was sweaty.

Today, Anais was determined to stir up trouble at the birthday banquet and make everyone uncomfortable.


Emily looked at Anais calmly. "Ms. Allen, you're becoming more interesting each day. Can you really say such things so casually?"

Anais frowned. "I'm right. You are his girlfriend."

Anais looked at James and said, "James, aren't you going to introduce Ms.Johnson to everyone?"

All eyes turned to James, but no one dared to push him.

No one actually believed Anais, who clearly had ill intentions.

Emily's gaze followed everyone's, landing on James.


They locked eyes.

A faint smile tugged at Emily's lips as she gazed at James. She was curious to see how James would introduce her in front of so many people.

Everyone instinctively held their breath.

James looked at Emily, his gaze icy. He hadn't received any message from Emly about coming to Starry Capital!
