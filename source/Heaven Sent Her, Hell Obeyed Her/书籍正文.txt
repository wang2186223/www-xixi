###Chapter 1 She Was Sold
The throbbing in Eliana Murray's head made it hard to think, yet the unsettling sensation along her lowebody jolted her back to full awareness.Her eyes snapped open, cold and sharp, locking on two rhiddle-aged women. One yanked at her pants whilethe other fought to force her legs apart."Try that again and see what happens!" said Eliana, kicking the plump one squarely in the chest.The blow sent the woman staggering backward, landing hard with a startled grunt. "Argh! That hurt, youbitch!" she cried out, clutching herself.The other woman stopped tugging at Eliana's pants and hurried to lift her fallen companionEliana went to grab them both but froze when she felt the coarse bite of rope digging into her wrists. He!hands were tied fast.Damn it. Where the hell was this? She had gone to sleep at her adoptive mother's place... so how had sheended up here?
Her gaze darted around her surroundings. Rotting walls closed her in, a rusted latch sealed the door, and asingle thread of daylight trickled from a cracked window high on the wall.The plump woman, now standing with help, snapped at Eliana, "You filthy brat! l should break your jaw folthat kick!"
She raised her hand to strike, but the other woman caught her wrist, "Don't touch her face. She's wortthirty grand, and a pretty face will fetch us double."
A slow breath hissed through the plump woman's teeth as she lowered her arm, "We gave hef`enougltranquilizer to knock out a horse. l don't know how she woke up so quickly. Whatever. At least she's awakefor the check."
Eliana narrowed her eyes and asked, "What check are you talking about?" "You're worth thirty grand, and we need to check if you're still a virgin," the plump woman replied.


Eliana's stomach turned. These lunatics wanted to see if she was a virgin? Ridiculous! They had no idea who they were dealing with. She wasn't some street rat they could drag around.


Back in Eighvale City, Eliana ruled the black market,and a single word from her could topple anyone foolish enough to cross her.


Eliana let out a cold laugh, her sharp eyes gleaming as she worked to free herself from the rope, while stalling for time. "Thirty grand? Who are you people?"


Her trip to Udrerton Village had been nothing but a waste. She'd dropped everything in Eighvale when word came that her adoptive mother, Janessa Holt,was gravely ill. The reality? It was a mild cold.


She had planned to leave the very next morning.Instead, she'd woken up tied to a chair in a rotting shed. The plump woman bent down, clamped a hand around Eliana's ankle, and said with a smirk,"Janessa sold you to us. Play along, and we might land you a decent man. Refuse, and we'll toss you to some lonely old man who'll take anything he can get."


"You're telling me Janessa sold me to you?" said Eliana, her voice edged with disbelief, as if the woman had just told her the most ridiculous joke she'd ever heard.



She'd been three years old when Janessa plucked her off the side of a dusty road. From that day on,she was paraded as the "adopted daughter", though everyone knew she was really being groomed to marry Neal Holt, Janessa's son.


Her earliest memories were of endless chores,scraped hands, and exhaustion that weighed heavily on her bones.


Determined to escape, she'd learned every skill she could get her hands on. By twelve, she had the means to walk away, and she never returned. Still, she hadn't erased the debt she felt for the roof she'd been given.


Each month on the first, she sent Janessa a sum of money. The total she had given her adoptive mother by now could have bought several prime real estate properties in any major city.


She had only shown up now because she believed Janessa was on her last breath, eager to slip in one final visit.



The truth was uglier than she'd ever imagined-Janessa hadn't softened. She'd sold her for thirty grand like she was a piece of livestock.


Now, Eliana realized why Janessa hade suddenly greeted her with smiles and warm words upon her arrival.


She had believed, foolishly, that the woman had changed. In reality, Janessa had just been luring her into a trap.


Eliana's subordinates had warned her not to set foot in Udrerton. She should have listened, because the Holts hadn't sprouted a single decent soul.


Every muscle in Eliana's body worked toward the same goal. The ropes strained, her fingers clawed at the knots, and freedom was almost within reach.


She drew in a long breath, her tone dripping with disbelief as she said, "You're out of your mind.Janessa would never sell me. I'm supposed to be Neal's wife."



One of the women laughed and asked, "Neal's wife?You've been gone too long to keep up. He's about to marry the daughter of a corporate giant. His family is rolling in money now. What would he want with you?"


Tightening her grip around Eliana's ankle, the other woman barked, "Quit squirming and spread your legs! We have to confirm you're still a virgin. If you're not, we won't pay the rest. Don't even think about resisting. If we end up breaking your hymen by accident, you'll be the one paying the price."


A slow, dangerous smile spread across Eliana's face. "Let's find out who's really going to pay the price!"


In that instant, the rope slipped free from her wrists.She lunged, catching the plump woman by the throat and lifting her into the air.


The woman writhed in panic, yet her fingers couldn't pry Eliana's grip loose. Color drained from her face,replaced by a deep red flush. Her lips darkened toward a chilling shade of blue.


The other woman lunged toward them, but Eliana snapped a kick into her side without missing a beat.


The blow sent the woman crashing into the wall,and a wet cough sprayed blood across her chin.


Even through the pain, she found her voice and screamed, "Somebody! Help us!"


Two strong men stormed through the doorway,each wielding a club. They swung at Eliana without hesitation.


She tossed the plump woman aside and snatched both clubs in midair, her hands moving faster than they could follow.



The men froze, startled by her speed.



They didn't have time to recover before Eliana's kicks sent them sprawling to the floor, limbs twisted and motionless.



Right then, the plump woman Eliana had tossed aside earlier crept toward her, thinking she had the upper hand.


Her plan failed instantly. The moment she came close enough, Eliana turned around and struck her with a swift blow from a flying club, dropping her cold.


Ten minutes later, Eliana stepped out of the burning shed, squinting as the fierce sunlight stabbed at her eyes.


She lifted a hand to block the glare, brushing off the faint,panicked shouts coming from inside.


Not once did she look back. Her focus was locked on the Holts' residence ahead. Human traffickers weren't worth pity, and she had no intention of giving them any.


And after this, the Holts would answer for everything.


Her steps quickened when voices echoed across the distance.



"Fire! Somebody get water!"


The flames had drawn villagers, who came running with buckets sloshing water.


Wrapped in the stolen coat of one of the women,Eliana kept her head lowered and slipped past the crowd, moving against their frantic flow.


It wasn't long before she reached the Holts,home.


One kick sent the wooden door clattering to the floor,dust exploding into the air.


But the moment she stepped inside, she realized the place was empty.


"They sure knew how to run," she muttered, a thin smile curling her lips. It didn't matter where they thought they could hide.She would track them down to the last corner of the earth.



Whatever debt she'd once owed was long gone, and now it was time to settle the score. Neither Janessa nor Neal would walk away unscathed.


With her expression hard as stone, Eliana stormed into her childhood room-a suffocating room carved from a storage closet, heavy with heat and the stench of mold.



Sure enough, both the small bag she had brought back and the phone she kept hidden beneath her pillow had vanished. Inside that bag bad been nothing worth stealing-only her driver's license.


Even so, losing it meant getting back to Eighvale would be far more troublesome.



Eliana brushed the thought aside. She figured she could find a phone in town and call her people to come pick her up. Her hand was on the door when a set of rapid footsteps pounded toward the house from outside.


A crease formed on her brow before her lips curved into a sharp smile. It had to be the Holts, back sooner than she expected.


Her eyes swept the room. She spotted a sickle leaning against the wall behind the door and wrapped her fingers around its handle before stepping outside.


The figure waiting beyond the doorway wasn't anyone from the Holt family. A young man stood there,maybe in his twenties, a stranger to her eyes.


His suit hung in tatters, mud crusted on his cheeks,hair wild from the wind. A rusty bicycle leaned on its stand behind him.



Keeping the sickle hidden against her side, Eliana asked, "Who exactly are you here for?"


The man turned around, startled, and froze when he saw her face. When his eyes landed on her, they went wide. She saw the disbelief hit him, then the emotion that followed-tears rolling down his grime-streaked cheeks.



"Lia! It's really you! Lia!" he shouted, charging toward Eliana like crazy.


He halted suddenly, stopping half a meter away as Eliana held the sickle aimed at him.


One more move and it would cut across his throat.
###Chapter 2 Reunion With Her Brother





"It's really you..." The man's voice quivered, not from fear but from an overwhelming rush of emotion.


"Don't you recognize me? It's me, your brother, Carl Murray! You disappeared when you were three.We've been searching for you ever since. The only reason I'm standing here now is because the national information system got upgraded, and your name came up. Our other family members weren't sure if it was really you, so they sent me to check."


His words spilled out in a hurry, but Eliana's face stayed unreadable, her eyes carrying å guarded edge. Considering she'd barely escaped being sold off minutes ago, blind trust wasn't on her list of options.


"I don't care who you are. Turn around and leave, or I'll make you regret staying," she said coldly.


Her rule had always been simple-if no one raised a hand against her, she wouldn't strike first.


The disbelief in her expression only made Carl more desperate.



"Lia, I'm telling you the truth. I'm your elder brother.Our family is the wealthiest in Qidence City. On Christmas, when you were just three, there was a huge celebration. So many people were there that we lost sight of you. We never stopped looking."



Eliana's gaze swepot over him, slow and deliberate."The wealthiest family shows up on a rusted bike?"


He glanced down at himself as if just noticing, then blurted out, "My car broke down on the way.I borrowed the bike from a villager just so Pcould get here faster. I swear, our family really is the richest in Qidence!"



"Save it. I'm not buying any of your stories. Leave,"Eliana snapped, not softening in the slightest.


He looked like a man trapped in a burning house,searching for a way out Then his face lit with sudden inspiration. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a fish-shaped jade pendant. "Here. This is half of the pendant Dad had made for you. When you vanished, you were wearing the other half around your neck."



The moment her gaze landed on the fish-shaped jade in his palm, something flickered in Eliana's eyes.Her grip on the sickle eased until the blade dropped to her side.



From beneath her collar, she pulled out the pendant she'd worn for years. Its other half fit perfectly with the one Carl carried.


That single sight made his conviction unshakable.She wasn't just a lookalike; she was the sister he'd been searching for all these years.


Before now, he'd only trusted the resemblance to their mnother. But the pendant left no doubt.


"The back of yours has your name 'Eliana Murray',doesn't it?" he asked quickly, leaning forward. Her eyes narrowed a fraction. That tiny engraving was so subtle. Was he telling the truth? The thought made her waver for the first time.



Lowering her guard only halfway, she asked, "Where exactly did you leave your car?"


"Parked at the main road of the neighboring village,"Carl replied without pause.


"Fine. Take me there. And hear me clearly-if this turns out to be a trick, you won't live to see another sunrise," Eliana warned sharply.


"I get it, I get it," Carl replied quickly, fumbling onto the battered bike parked at the door. He motioned for her to hop on.


Eliana was ready to tell him to forget it when a sudden wave of dizziness swept through her.


A few seconds passed before she steadied herself and swung onto the seat behind him.


Carl said, "Sit tight and..." "Quit talking. Ride. Follow that path ahead," she ordered.



"Got it," he said, pushing the bike forward.


Still, the thought nagged at him-this wasn't the soft,delicate little sister he'd pictured. This was a woman who could handle herself.



With a deep breath, he pressed on toward the neighboring village, the pedals moving faster beneath his feet.



Following her lead, the ride passed without crossing paths with a single familiar face.


Nearly half an hour later, the neighboring village came into view.



During the ride, Eliana had tried her best to push the drug's effects deep enough to keep them at bay.


The moment her feet hit the ground, her eyes locked on a sleek black luxury car by the road. Its front end dipped noticeably-the left wheel was mangled beyond use Carl hurried to ease her concern, saying, "Lia, it's fine. I already called the nearest repair shop.They'll get here in two hours, maybe less-"


Before the words could land, Eliana was at the trunk,pulling out a spare and a set of tools like she'd done it a hundred times. Without a word, she strode to the damaged wheel.


"What are you doing?" Carl started.


"Fixing the damn tire," Eliana responded.


Two hours of waiting wasn't an option.


The people from her old village had never been worth trusting, and standing around here would just invite trouble.



"You actually know how to do that?" Carl asked,disbelief creeping into his tone.


Eliana didn't bother answering. The jack slid into place, the car lifted, and within minutes, the spare was bolted on tight. With the bad tire kicked aside,she yanked the driver's door open and slid behind the wheel.


Carl was still frozen where he stood when she snapped, "Stop standing there. Get in."


"Right. Yeah." Carl snapped out of it, scrambling into the passenger seat.


He broke into a grin and exclaimed, "Lia, that was incredible. You can change a tire like it's nothing.I can't even manage that. Oh-speaking of which,what was with the sickle earlier?"


"To cut grass for the sheep," Eliana answered flatly.


The simplicity of her reply hit him harder than he expected. "I had no idea things were this rough for you. Listen, once we're back home, you'll hever have to do chores like that again... Ah!!!"


Before he could get the rest out, the car shot forward like a loosed arrow. His voice cracked in panic. "Slow down! You're going too fast! I'm serious-slow down!"



"Shut it," Eliana snapped, her voice cold enough to cut.His constant noise made her ears throb.



When his shouting started again, she didn't hesitate.Her right hand came down in a sharp, decisive strike,and the noise died instantly.


The engine roared louder, and the car surged ahead,zigzagging along the road as horns blared from every direction. Inside a plane waiting for takeoff, Janessa ended the call with a grim look, ripping Neal's eye mask away."We have a problem," she said crossly.


Neal cracked his eyes open in annoyance."What problem?"


"Brianna's house burned down. Everyone inside died in the fire."



The weight of her words made him sit upright at last."And Eliana?"


"Isn't it clear? She went up in flames with the rest of them!" Janessa's gaze carried not a shred of grief-only irritation. "You haven't laid eyes on her in years,but she turned into quite the beauty. Selling her for thirty grand felt like a loss! We had a deal-after checking whether she's still a virgin, they were supposed to hand over the remaining fifteen grand.Now that money's gone up in smoke too!"


Neal let out a breath of relief and said, "That fifteen grand is the last thing we should worry about. Once I marry Khloe, fifteen million will just be the cost of a single day."


In his eyes, Eliana-skinny and forgettable back then -couldn't possibly measure up to Khloe Clarke, the indulged daughter of the Clarke family and the woman set to be his wife.


"Still, fifteen grand doesn't just grow on trees..."Janessa muttered, her lips twisting in regret.


Neal explained with a shake of his head, "You've got no sense for the bigger picture. If she were alive, l'd never sleep easy. Imagine if Khloe found out I was once engaged to Eliana-she'd lose her mind. Now that Eliana's gone, there's no chance of Khloe ever learning she existed."


That thought seemed to ease Janessa's annoyance,her lips loosening into a half-smile. "I guess you're right. When we get back to Qidence, I'll stop by the church. Maybe light a candle for her, justto settle my conscience."


His expression hardened in disapproval. "And risk Khloe or her family catching wind of it? Pointless.Eliana's already gone, and whether you mourn her or not changes nothing. Her death has nothing to do with us-it was just bad luck chasing her to the grave."


Janessa's agreement was cut short by a loud rumble from her stomach.



The thought of the pastries she had packed from home came to mind, and she dug quickly through her bag.


A bank card slippoed free from between the wrappers and clattered onto the floor. "You dropped something," Neal remarked, gesturing toward it with little interest.



Bending down to pick it up, Janessa paused,recognizing the card. "Eliana's been putting money into this account ever since she started working.She knew it took over an hour to get to the bank, but she still refused to send cash. She did it just to annoy me.Once we're in Qidence, I'll see how much she's stashed in here."


Neal looked disdainful. "She stopped going to school when she was twelve and went straight to work. Do you really think she's saved up much? If the Clarke family learns about this card, you'll have more than just a headache. Get ridof it."


Before she could respond, he tried to snatch the card from her hand.



She quickly shoved the card back into her bag."Money is still money! Even if she only put in a grand a month, over the years that's more than a hundred grand." Neal leaned back, pulled down his eye mask, and shut her out with silence.


He would have to deal with Khloe once they got to Qidence. She never appreciated him bringing his mother along.


Elsewhere, Carl, still sore from the blow Eliana had given him, came to his senses and realized he had already arrived in Qidence.
###Chapter 3 She Hadn't Been Cast Aside
Pain pulsed at the base of Carl's neck, and he reached up to massage it while scanning his surroundings.



The interior of his car felt unchanged, yet through the windshield rose the city's skyline, with the Pearl Tower cutting into the hazy distance.



That was when it hit him-he was back in Qidence.



The last thing he remembered was leaving the village with Eliana behind the wheel. At some point,darkness had taken over without warning.


His gaze darted around the car, and an uneasy realization struck-Eliana wasn't there.



He twisted in his seat, straining to see, until he finally caught sight of her a few steps away. 
Eliana stood in conversation with a young man whose messy curls framed his face.


"The lab sent the results," the man said, his voice low but urgent.


"What did they say?" asked Eliana, her eyes narrowing.





Instead of answering outright, the man passed her a thin folder. "You might want to read it yourself."


A crease formed on Eliana's brow as a suspicion began to take shape in her mind.


She flipped the report open, heading straight for the last page. The words stared back at her. "Analysis of DNA samples from both parties supports a blood relationship."


The report snapped shut in her hands, and her gaze darkened with a storm of unspoken emotions.


For as long as she could remember, she had carried the belief that she was an orphan. If that weren't true, then surely she had been cast aside. That conviction had kept her from searching.Even with her talents and resources, she had never once tried to find them.


In her mind, those who had thrown her away didn't deserve to be her family.


Learning the truth about her roots left her with a swirl of emotions she couldn't quite name.


Even so, the thought of rushing back to her family didn't sit right with her.


Life alongside her subordinates had become her normal.


Watching her closely, the curly-haired man finally asked, "So, are you heading back to meet the Murray family? I did some digging. Besides you, they've got six sons and one adopted daughter.The whole family situation is quite complicated."


She pushed the folder back into his hands without hesitation. "Complicated or not, I need to see it for myself." His face lit up with approval. "Couldn't be better timing. We're shifting our headquarters to Qidence this year. Having connections here will smooth the way for everything."


Eliana's eyes narrowed slightly as she said, "So, this was part of your plan all along-nudging me back to the Murray family."


Scratching at his curls, he gave a sheepish grin and responded, "More like a move we can't avoid.Eighvale's market has been wrecked. Some unknown group came after us hard, and we've been bleeding losses without even knowing their names. We need new ground."


"Then let everyone know they should be ready to pack up at a moment's notice," Eliana said.


"Got it," he replied with a brisk nod. He started to turn away, then paused as something came to mind."Oh-while you were gone, we landed a big contract.It's for treating someone here. Since you're already in town, can you take it?" "What's their offer?" Eliana inquired.



"They said if the patient recovers, we can name any price we want," the man answered.


Eliana raised an eyebrow. "Then let's mnake this our calling card in Qidence."


Before her last word had even faded, a faint noise came from inside the car.



With a flick of her hand, Eliana sent the curly-haired man on his way, and he disappeared without another word.



Moments later, Carl walked up, his eyes trailing in the direction the man had gone.


"Who was that, Lia?" he asked, curiosity edging his voice.



"Just a driver I hired. He's the one who brought us into Qidence," Eliana answered casually.


"Got it." Carl didn't question her, though his hand went to his neck. "Strange... it's aching like crazy." "You probably slept the whole ride and twisted it.That's all," she replied with the same easy tone.


"You think so?" His eyes narrowed slightly, still unsure.



"I'm sure of it," Eliana said with a firm nod.


Even with her reassurance, a quiet doubt lingered in his mind.



Each time he tried to focus on what had happened earlier, the throbbing in his neck sharpened until he gave up.


In the end, all that mattered was that Eliana was with him again.


"Come on, let's head home. Mom and Dad must be waiting," Carl said, his excitement bubbling over.


"Alright, let's go." Eliana agreed, making no move to argue and letting him take the driver's seat.


Carl straightened in confidence, determined to keep the ride smooth. He hoped to show her he could handle the wheel, but the streets of Qidence were a mess-heavy traffic,endless red lights, and no room for speed.


Over an hour later, their patience paid off as they passed through the gates of a grand estate.


Eliana's gaze swept over the surroundings, and for the first time, she began to believe Carl's boast that the Murrays had been Qidence's richest family.


The thought struck her that, as the acknowledged daughter of such a family, moving the Onyx Syndicate's headquarters here would be far easier than she'd imagined.


Her thoughts barely had time to settle before the car rolled to a stop and she stepped out, only to spot several uniformed servants hauling luggage toward the gates.


Carl stepped forward and stopped one of them."Briar, what's going on? Where are you headed?"


Recognizing him instantly, Briar Ward dipped his head in greeting before answering, "There's been... a major change in the family while you were away."


As he explained, the picture became clear for Eliana.


Carl's father, Louis Murray, once Qidence's richest man, had been pulled into a high-profile economic investigation and taken into custody.


Alongside him, Damon and Sawyer Murray-the eldest and second sons-were also being held for questioning.


The Murray Group's empire had taken a crushing hit and the staff were being dismissed one after another.


Wages had just been settled, and those still loyal were now leaving with heavy hearts.


Carl stood frozen, as though the words couldn't quite take root in his mind.


Eliana gave a gentle pull on his sleeve. "Come on.Let's see for ourselves."



That seemed to jolt him back to reality. With a dazed expression clouding his features, he led her through the front doors.



The living room greeted them with a tense scene-a slim young woman knelt before a middle-aged woman in an elegant dress.


"Mom, please, I had no other choice... With everything falling apart here, the Clarkes won't take me unless | cut ties with our family. You don't have to worry; it's only for appearances. After I marry into the Clarke family, I'll still be able to help..." the young woman pleaded.


At those words, Stella Murray's eyes slid shut, her expression one of quiet, aching disappointment.


The family's downfall hadn't been an accident. It was a calculated move, partly to stall for time and build their influence, and partly to see if the younger generation could endure hardship.


Still, after more than twenty years under her care,Leyla Murray-the adopted daughter-decided to walk away the moment trouble arrived. Even the servants who had been dismissed had quietly offered to return if the family needed them.


Leyla, however, seemed determined to put as much distance between herself and the Murrays as she could.


Carl didn't wait for her to speak. He strode forward and struck her across the face.


Clutching her cheek, Leyla stared at him in disbelief."Carl,you actually hit me?"


His eyes were cold as he snapped back, "Yeah, I did.And why shouldn't I? You're just looking for a way to save yourself while we're drowning."


"You-" Leyla began, her voice tight.


"Enough! Marry anyone you want. We don't give a damn. You're not a Murray anymore!" he barked.


Her gaze flicked between Carl and Stella, who said nothing. Then she let out a sharp laugh and rose to her feet. "Alright then. You've made it clear. This is your choice, not mine." From her bag, she drew a folded document and added, "Sign this. From this moment on, your troubles aren't mine, and I won't care whether you guys end up in jail or not."


Carl snatched the severance papers before Stella could react and scribbled his name without hesitation. "Done. Now get out!"
###Chapter 4 Treating Stella





Carl slammed one of the copies of the agreement to sever family ties onto the floor in anger.


For years, he had been convinced that Leyla was trouble, though the rest of the family refused to see it.



Now, her own actions had spared him the trouble of proving it.


"Why are you still standing here? Weren't you desperate to leave? Then go!" he said coldly.


A low, mocking laugh slipped from Leyla.


The truth was, she and Carl had never been on friendly terms, and there was no reason to keep up the act anymore.


Bending to retrieve the crumpled document,she met Carl's gaze with chilling resolve. "Remember this moment, Carl. One day, you'll regret every choice you made today."


Without waiting for a reply, she turned toward the door.



Her step faltered when she noticed Eliana watching from the corner of the room.



A frown creased her face upon seeing Eliana.


Despite wearing clothes that could not have been plainer, Eliana's face carried a kind of beauty that demanded notice.



It wasn't the soft, quiet kind-it struck like a challenge, and Leyla felt an unease coil in her stomach.



Those eyes sealed it. They mirrored Stella's in a way that left no doubt.



The truth clicked in Leyla's mind in an instant.


She stepped closer, letting her gaze sweep over Eliana. "So, you must be the missing Eliana." moment, Carl. One day, you'll regret every choice you made today."


Without waiting for a reply, she turned toward the door.



Her step faltered when she noticed Eliana watching from the corner of the room.



A frown creased her face upon seeing Eliana.


Despite wearing clothes that could not have been plainer, Eliana's face carried a kind of beauty that demanded notice.



It wasn't the soft, quiet kind-it struck like a challenge, and Leyla felt an unease coil in her stomach.



Those eyes sealed it. They mirrored Stella's in a way that left no doubt.


The truth clicked in Leyla's mind in an instant.


She stepped closer, letting her gaze sweep over Eliana. "So, you must be the missing Eliana." Eliana's mouth curved into a thin, knowing smile."And you're the stray who bit the hand that fed her?"


Leyla's temper snapped, her hand swinging upward.


Before the blow could land, Eliana's fingers clamped around her wrist, halting it in midair. A sharp pain shot through Leyla's arm.


"Argh-" Leyla hissed. "Let go, you bitch!"


"Looks like no one ever taught you manners. Leave now, before I lose my patience," Eliana warned coldly.


She let go of Leyla's wrist and wiped her palm against her pants as though she'd touched something filthy.


Leyla's eyes narrowed, and a bitter laugh broke from her lips. "Oh, I get it now. You're just a carbon copy of the rest of your family. But don't think you've come back to some comfortable life. The Murrays are sinking fast."


Eliana responded, "Maybe they are, maybe they're not. I'm not sure. But I'm sure of one thing: you'll be gone by the time I count to three."


With a burst of anger, Leyla tried to lunge at her, but Carl stepped in, blocking her path. "Throw her out!"he barked.



"I know the way! I never wanted to stay in this place.And you'd all better remember-this isn't over.I'll make you pay for today," Leyla retorted with a cold glare.



She had returned alone, and for now, retreating seemed the smarter move.


Once she married into the Clarke family, she would find her chance to strike.



Carl opened his mouth to hurl another insult but stopped short when Stella's body wavered.


"Mom!" he shouted, rushing forward.


A blur of movement swept past him, and before he could blink, Eliana was there, arms around the fainting Stella. "Lia..." Carl stared in disbelief.


"Help me get her to her room," Eliana told him, her tone leaving no room for hesitation.


"Right," he said, moving quickly.


Within minutes, Stella was settled in her bedroom.


Eliana took a seat at the edge, her hands moving with careful precision as she examined her.


It didn't take long for her to see that rage had pushed Stella past her limit. Beneath that, Stella's body was already fragile, weakened from old illnesses that had never fully healed. Without proper care, she might not withstand much more.


Carl had just told the butler to call for an ambulance when he noticed Eliana leaning over Stella, quietly assessing her condition.


A flicker of surprise crossed his face. "Lia, are you a doctor now?"


Keeping her tone casual, Eliana replied, "Simply picked up a few tricks from a village healer. Do you have an acupuncture kit? She needs it right away."


The butler stepped in before Carl could respond, his voice carrying a note of concern. "I've already called an ambulance. It'll arrive in about twenty minutes."


Eliana's expression didn't change. "By then, they'll put her on oxygen, run a list of tests, and hand her a bag of random pills before sending her back home."


Without thinking twice, Carl replied, "Go to the therapy room. See if the therapist left any needles."


That room had been stocked years ago for Louis,whose bad back demanded constant attention.



With no room to argue, the butler left to look,muttering under his breath.


Luck was on their side-though the therapist had been dismissed, the tools had been left behind.


Within moments, the butler returned with a small wooden case. Eliana flipped it open, laying out the silver needles in an orderly row.


She sterilized them with practiced movements before pressing them into several key points along Stella's body.


Even after the final needle was in place, Stella's eyes stayed closed, her breathing unchanged.


Noticing this, the butler tugged Carl a few steps away.


To him, Carl had always been the Murray child least suited for serious decisions.


With everyone else preoccupied by Louis's affairs,the butler felt the burden of keeping a level head-and stopping Carl from making a costly mistake.


"Sir..." His voice dropped to a near whisper as his eyes flicked toward Eliana, saying, "The young lady you brought home... is she really Eliana?"


"Absolutely. Look at her eyes-they're the same as our mother's when she was young. And she's wearing the fish-shaped jade pendant our mother gave her before she disappeared."


The butler gave a slow nod before continuing, "While you were gone, we learned she was adopted by a rural family. Forgive me for saying so, but country people don't exactly have advanced medical training.The ambulance will be here any minute-it might be safer to take your mother to a top-tier hospital."


"You're suggesting Lia could hurt our mom?" Carl's tone sharpened.


"Not at all," the butler said quickly. "I'm just considering the worst possibility. You saw it yourself -those needles didn't seem to change anything."


Carl's direct nature carried him straight to Eliana's side. "Lia, how much longer until she comes around?"



"In about ten minutes," said Eliana, pressing the needle in with steady, deliberate force.


The pressure inside Stella needed to be eased gradually.


Carl gave a brief nod, then looked over at the butler."We'll give it ten minutes. If she's still out, we're heading to the hospital. Relax. There are also skilled doctors in the countryside."


Eliana's gaze flicked toward the butler. "She'll wake up.You have my word."


The butler forced a small, uneasy smile. "Alright..."


He hadn't expected Carl's words to be so blunt and without ceremony.



It explained why people claimed that, among the six sons of Louis and Stella, Carl was the plainest speaker.


While his nerves wound tighter, the wail of an ambulance floated up from the street.


"The ambulance is here!" he blurted out. "Let's get Mrs.Murray downstairs right away!"


The words were barely out of his mouth when the door slammed open with a violent kick.


Every head turned toward the sudden intrusion.


A man with strong brows and a scar cutting across his right one stood in the doorway. "Carl, I heard Mom-"



His words cut off when his eyes locked on Eliana,who was pressing a long silver needle into Stella's head. His face instantly contorted with rage.


"Who the hell are you, and why are you hurting my mom? You'll have to go through me first!"


Without another word, he swung his arm toward Eliana in a strike meant to land.
###Chapter 5 Remarkable Fighting Skills





The newcomer was Sean Murray-Stella's fifth son and a seasoned fighter known for his boxing skills.


Carl caught sight of him moving in on Eliana,and he dashed forward to block him. "Sean! Stop right there!"


Sean wasn't interested in hearing him out. In his mind, the only thing that mattered was taking down the person he believed had hurt his mother.


Carl tried to hold his ground, but Sean shoved him aside with a sharp push and swung his attack toward Eliana.



The strike came dangerously close to the back of her head, and Carl's chest tightened. He couldn't bear to watch what might happen next, so he squeezed his eyes shut.


A sharp crack rang out, the unmistakable sound of bones shifting out of place.


Carl's mind reeled. Did Eliana's skull just take the hit?His heart clenched at the thought.


When he finally dared to look, the sight left him stunned. Sean was the one on the floor.



Eliana had somehow twisted him into a hold with one arm, his face twisted in pain, his body completely restrained.



The butler froze in place, eyes wide with disbelief.


Carl hadn't caught the start of it, but the butler had witnessed her every movement.


In a blink, Eliana had become nothing more than a streak of motion, her counterattack striking with flawless aim and enough force to slam Sean to the floor, holding him there without effort. Her speed and precision were nothing short of extraordinary.


The butler might have known nothing about fighting skills,but even he could tell that her skill left Sean far behind. Still, it didn't add up. How could she be this good?


Sean wasn't just anyone. He trained with the Fist Guild, a boxing circle celebrated for turning out fighters who could dismantle several opponents in one go. Every member of that guild carried a reputation for dominance in the ring.


The thought crept into the butler's mind-was Eliana truly some girl from the countryside, or had they all been mistaken?



While the butler wrestled with his disbelief, Carl shook off his shock and hurried toward Eliana. "Lia,are you hurt?" he asked quickly.


Eliana gave a small shake of her headp her face unreadable.


No matter how much force Sean put behind it, he couldn't so much as rattle her.



Gritting his teeth against the ache in his arm,Sean shot Carl a fierce glare. "Shouldn't you be asking if I'm the one in trouble? And who is she anyway? You're standing up for someone who went after Mom? Did you lose your senses?"


Carl's eyes flicked to Eliana, confirming she was unhurt before answering, "Sean, this is Lia, our sister.She wasn't hurting Mom-she was helping her."


That revelation made Sean blink in disbelief, his head jerking toward Eliana.


From where he stood, all he noticed was the wiry strength in her arm, slender yet unyielding.


"You're our sister?" he asked, his voice edged with doubt.



By then, Eliana had already figured out who he was.Realizing it was nothing more than a misunderstanding, she loosened her hold.


She gave him a brief nod before returning to Stella's side, slipping back into her acupuncture work as though the clash had never happened.


Sean got to his feet with effort, his movements stiff. Carl's eyes flicked between the two of them before he asked, "Sean, are you sure you're okay?"


The truth was far from it. Sean's right arm hung useless, every twitch sending sharp jolts of pain through him.


Even the smallest movement made it feel as though the bone might snap again.


Yet pride kept him from admitting any weakness.


Being a Fist Guild fighter, he couldn't stomach the thought of being brought down by a ggirl.


He told himself he had simply underestimated her,forcing a tight grin. "I'm fine."


Carl accepted the answer with a relieved breath."Good. You nearly hurt Lia back there, so watch yourself next time."


Sean found his gaze drifting back to Eliana.


Her clothes were plain and worn yet there was an icy edge in her presence that could cut through anyone who dared meet her eyes.


From where he stood, her face was hidden from view.


In his mind, though, Eliana had always been gentle, a girl with a warm smile and soft manners.


The woman by Stella's bed was nothing of the sort-her presence was all edge and steel, nothing like the sister he remembered.



"How wasI supposed to guess she was Lia? And are you absolutely sure she's the same person?" Sean asked, his tone dripping with doubt.


"I checked for myself. There's no mistake," said Carl with a steady nod.


The certainty in Carl's voice, paired with the jade pendant he presented, chipped away at Sean's disbelief.


"Alright," he muttered, still wincing, then asked why their mother had suddenly fainted.


Carl's face darkened at the question. "Leyla's the reason."


Sean blinked in surprise. "Leyla? What happened to her?"


"She's turned her back on us. From this moment on,she has nothing to do with us," Carl said with a sneer.


Of the six Murray brothers, Carl had always been the one at odds with Leyla, while the rest kept her close.


Hearing such a statement, Sean's first instinct was to blame Carl. He said sharply, "Your relationship with Leyla has always been rocky. Whatever fight you've had, you have no right to talk about her like that.She's been our sister from the day we took her in."


At Sean's words, Carl's lips curled into a mocking smile. He knew Sean too well-once his brother decided where his loyalty lay, no words could sway him unless he was faced with undeniable proof.


Instead of wasting his breath, Carl reached into his pocket and tossed a folded document toward him.


"Read it for yourself," he said coolly. Sean accepted the document with a guarded expression. When his eyes scanned the words, they widened as though he'd been struck. "This... this is Leyla's handwriting."


There was no mistaking it-he knew every curve and flourish of her writing.



The agreement left nothing to interpretation-Leyla had severed all ties with the Murray family, her adoption officially ended. What could have possibly led to this?


The initial shock faded, replaced by a creeping accusation.


With his left hand, he seized Carl's collar, dragging him close. "So this is about Lia, isn't it? She comes back, and suddenly Leyla's cut off? Don't feed me excuses. Even if times are rough, we're still capable of giving Leyla a decent life. She's grown up with us,Carl.How could you throw her away like this?"


Carl let out a sharp, impatient huff. "Like I've said before-every single one of you is blind except me." Sean's brows drew tight as he replied, "Quit talking nonsense. Go find Leyla and make things right. If you don't, don't blame me when I lay you out."


The glare Carl gave him was ice-cold. He shoved Sean back and snapped, "You'd raise your hand against your own brother over her? What hold does she have on you? CCan't you see what she really is?Remember asking why Mom collapsed? I'll spell it out for you. This wasn't my doing-Leyla made us sign that agreement. When our family ran into trouble,she wrote this herself to cut ties so we wouldn't ruin her marriage into the Clarke family. Mom collapsed from the anger!"
###Chapter 6 Not Going Anywhere




For a brief moment, Sean froze in place.


Then, shaking his head hard, he blurted out, "No way! Leyla cares about us too much. She'd never cut ties with us of her own accord."



Before the echo of his words faded, a faint, amused laugh drifted through the air-from Eliana's direction.



Sean's brows knit in irritation as he turned toward her. "Lia, what's so amusing? Don't tell me you're the one who made Leyla leave."



By now, Eliana had figured out Sean wasn't worth the effort. Rather than argue, she kept her focus on the precise motions of her acupuncture work.


Stella should have been awake already. Yet her frail condition delayed her recovery, keeping her under longer than expected. Eliana could only continue the treatment without pause.


Taking her silence as guilt, Sean hurried closer, his face tense. "When you were gone, Leyla took care of Mom in your place. Without her, Mom might not have survived those years. How could you send her away?Even if she stayed, nothing of yours would be taken.So why would you do something like this?"


No matter how long Sean spoke, Eliana didn't even look at him, her concentration anchored firmly to the task in her hands.



The lack of response only fueled his irritation. "Lia,are you even listening-"


"That's enough, Sean!" Carl's voice cut through,and he stepped in, physically pulling Sean to the side.


Fixing Sean with a steady look, he added, "What I told you before was the truth. Lia has no idea who Leyla is-so how could she have been the one to drive her away? If you think I'm lying, ask Jordy." Sean's eyes shifted to Jordy Castro, the butler, after a moment's hesitation, his glare sharp enough to cut.


"Lie to me, and I'll make sure you regret it," he said in a cold, measured tone.


A shiver passed through Jordy at the threat-he knew Sean meant every word.


Still, he straightened and answered, "Your brother's statement is correct. Leyla was the one who chose to cut ties with your family."


Sean's once-firm expression faltered at last. "So it really wasn't Carl or Lia..."


Before anyone could respond, a faint, fragile voice drifted from the bed. "It wasn't them." All three of them turned immediately toward the source.


Stella's eyelids fluttered open, one hand gripping Eliana's tightly while the other pressed against the mattress as she tried to sit up.


"Mom! You're awake! Are you okay?" Carl and Sean hurried to her side almost simultaneously. But Stella didn't spare them a glance-her eyes stayed locked on Eliana, shimmering with tears."Lia...Are you my Lia?"


The sheer joy of seeing the child she'd been separated from for so long broke through her composure, and the tears spilled freely.


Her earlier anger at Leyla had been real, but it wasn't what had caused her to collapse.


The truth was, the moment she saw Eliana,something deep within her recognized her instantly.A mother's instinct needed no proof.


That surge of emotion had been so overwhelming, it had stolen her consciousness away.


Something about Stella's face and the sound of her voice struck deep in Eliana's memory-it felt like she'd heard that voice call her "Lia" a thousand times before.



"1am." For the first time since stepping into the house, a touch of softness melted the cool reserve in Eliana's expression.


Stella's composure shattered in the very next heartbeat. She pulled Eliana into a fierce embrace,her sobs breaking loose. "I've finally found you, Lia..I've dreamed of you every night. Every morning l woke wishing the dream was real. It's my fault-l never should have lost you. Lia, it's all my fault...every bit of it!"


The moment she had yearned for had come-her youngest daughter, her own flesh and blood, was back in her arms.



For years, Stella's longing for a daughter had gone unanswered, even after bearing son after son. Fate had been cruel, allowing her only three short years with her little gir before tearing them apart.


Eliana felt the hot trail of Stella's tears against her neck, her back stiffening at the unfamiliar sensation.


No one had ever wept for her before. The warmth of it seeped into her chest, unsettling and strange, yet quietly stirring something deep inside. Taking a steady breath, Eliana whispered, her voice warm and steady, "No more tears... I'm here now.What's done is done, and none of it is your fault."


Carl's voice followed, light but reassuring. "That's right, Mom. Lia's home. This should be a moment for smiles,not tears."



Trying to rein in her emotions, Stella cupped Eliana's cheeks and leaned in for a closer look.



The dirt on Eliana's skin looked as if she'd walked straight out of a fire, faint smudges shadowing her brows.



Ignoring the grime, Stella brushed her fingertips gently across Eliana's face, clearing away the dirt to reveal her true features.



Those bright, unclouded eyes were exactly as Stella remembered from her own youth. The straight,refined nose came from Louis. And the delicate structure of Eliana's face carried a quiet fragility that stirred a deep urge to protect her. Many admired Leyla for her striking beauty. What most didn't know was that Leyla's adoption from the orphanage had been partly because she shared half of Eliana's features.



If someone with just a partial resemblance was already considered a rare beauty, Eliana herself was beyond compare.


"Lia... you're breathtaking," Stella murmured, her eyes shimmering as a wide smile tugged at her lips,caught between laughter and tears.


To anyone watching without context, she might have looked as though she'd lost her mind.



Only Stella understood the depth of longing she had carried for this moment.



Her fingertips traced lightly over Eliana's features, as though she were committing every line and contour to memory.


For Eliana, the unfamiliar tenderness stirred an uneasy feeling in her chest. Clearing her throat, she eased back just slightly to avoid the touch. "I've already examined your condition. You should still steer clear of anything too strenuous, and don't let your emotions run too high.Rest is what you need most right now."


Moisture gathered in Stella's eyes again. "I'm sorry,Lia. When our family had everything, we never brought you home to share it. And now, when we've fallen on hard times, that's when we find you..."


She hesitated, as if pushing past a lump in her throat."If you-like Leyla-believe our troubles will weigh you down,you can walk away. I won't hold it against you. Just knowing you're alive and healthy would be enough for me."



Such words could only come from a mother with understanding in her heart.


Back when the Murray family thrived, Eliana had never known that comfort. Now that ruin loomed over them,they had no right to demand her loyalty in their hardships. Whatever choice Eliana made, Stella had already decided she would accept it.



"Mom..." Carl's voice broke with urgency. "We just got Lia back. How can you even think of letting her go?"


Stella cut him off with a sharp glare, exclaiming "You've been out looking for Lia and have no idea what's been going on here. This family isn't what it once was. Whether she stays or goes is her decision alone."



Carl swallowed his next words, his eyes flicking nervously to Eliana.


Sean,on the other hand, remained unmoved.


Two decades of separation had dulled whatever bond he might have felt.


In truth, his loyalty leaned more toward Leyla now.


Part of him even wished that if Eliana chose to leave,Leyla might come back. When the silence stretched, Eliana finally broke it."I'm not going anywhere."


She had two reasons-first, the Murray family had not cast her aside, and she wasn't about to turn her back on them now. Second, with the Onyx Syndicate moving to Qidence, she needed a legitimate identity to remain there.


Carl's face lit up. "That's great! If you returned to where you came from, you'd be stuck doing farm labor. No matter how tough it gets here, we'll never let you go back to that."


Surprise crossed Stella's features. "You were really doing farm labor?"


Eliana gave a small shrug. "Something like that."


She had no intention of revealing her full story-not yet.


Fresh tears welled in Stella's eyes. "I never knew you'd suffered that much..."


Had she known where Eliana was, she would have brought her home years ago.


With a light squeeze to Stella's hand, Eliana said softly, "I wasn't suffering, so you don't have to worry."


Truthfully, the cold detachment Sean had shown her earlier had made her think about walking away. But the hope shining in Stella's eyes chipped away at that resolve.



Stella's grip tightened as she nodded, her voice trembling. "You're such a sweet girl..."


A sudden, mocking murmur came from Sean. "Mom,you shouldn't feel too guilty. She seemed to be doing just fine out in the countryside.I mean, how often do you see someone from there with skin that smooth?"


Even beneath the dirt, Eliana's skin was unblemished, soft, and strikingly refined. That was why Sean convinced himself she must have lived comfortably, even away from the family.
###Chapter 7 She Deserves To Be Looked After





Eliana's brow knitted ever so slightly as she drew ín a breath to speak.


Stella cut in before a word could leave her mouth."Sean! Watch your tone. Don't forget, Lia is your sister. You played a big part in her disappearance,and now that she's back, you should be looking out for her, not speaking against her. And remember this -our family started from nothing. Our ancestors worked the fields with their own hands. No matter how high we climb, we must keep our feet on the ground. You should go back to your room, think about what you did, and you're not stepping outside this house unless I say so."


The outburst caught Eliana off guard, and she stared at Stella in surprise.


Her astonishment had nothing to do with the defens itself. It was the phrase about staying humble despite success. That was the same thing she often told her own team members.


Realizing they shared such similar values sparked a quiet admiration for Stella.


Sean, on the other hand, shifted uneasily. "Mom, look at what's happening to us. How can you expect me to just sit here? I need to get to the Fist Guild and see if someone there can help Dad."



"That's not your concern! The Fist Guild only fuels reckless impulses, and you're done going there,"Stella retorted without hesitation.


She had seen the change in him over the years. The guild had sharpened him, yes, but into something brash and defiant.



In truth, she wished she had never allowed him to train there at all.


"Mom..." Sean's voice carried a note of protest.


"Have you stopped listening to me? Are you trying to -" The rest of her words dissolved into a harsh,relentless cough.


The sight made Sean's resolve crumble. "Please don't get upset. I'll head back to my room right now and think things over..."


His eyes lingered on Eliana for a long moment, the look carrying nothing but irritation.


Since her return, he had convinced himself that misfortune had followed-the family teetering on bankruptcy, chaos at every turn, and now he was the one being told to reflect on his behavior.


In his mind, Eliana was nothing more than bad luck walking.


Muttering under his breath, Sean turned and left.


Carl stepped closer, trying to ease the tension. "Lia,don't take it personally. Sean's a bit narrow in how he sees things, but he's not a bad guy. Once he comes around, he'll treat you better than he treats himself."


"I'm not going to dwell on it," said Eliana with a small nod.



Truthfully, Sean wasn't even worth her attention,so nothing he said could unsettle her.


Stella reached over and gave her hand a reassuring pat. "You've only just come back, and he's still not used to you. Give it time, and he'll come around. And if he doesn't, just tell me, and I'll set him straight."


If it ever came to that, Eliana knew she could deal with Sean on her own without anyone's help.



"Speaking of which, Mom..." Carl's tone shifted as he brought up another matter. "The servants said Damon and Sawyer were taken away too? I thought only Dad was involved. Neither of them has anything to do with politics, so why would they get dragged into it?"



A heavy sigh escaped Stella. "They clashed with the officers who came for your father. I've already brought in a lawyer, and Rowell is looking into it as well. They should be out soon." "Rowell? Wasn't he supposed to be on set with the crew?" Carl asked, visibly surprised.


"With the family in this mess, there was no way he could stay there. He came back yesterday," Stella answered.



Carl's thoughts shifted, and he asked, "What about Harold?"



Stella replied, "Actually, Harold doesn't know what's happening here. He's still abroad right now, giving medical aid. Leave him out of this for the moment.His work there matters more than anything, and l don't want him distracted."



On the surface,the Murray family looked like they were drowning in trouble, but in truth, it was nothing more than a carefully staged trap.


That truth, however, was something Stella had no intention of sharing with them yet.


Carl took a moment to think, then asked, "Then tell me what I can do." "Start preparing for Lia's welcome party in three days. Since she's decided to stay, we'll mark her return properly and make sure everyone knows who she is."



"But..." Carl's eyes flicked toward Eliana.


Catching the unspoken concern, Eliana quickly suggested, "Mom, I'll go get your medicine ready."


Recognizing that Carl wanted a private word, Stella gave a short nod. "Alright. Jordy, take Eliana to the kitchen."



"Got it. This way, please," Jordy said politely.


Once Eliana stepped out and the door shut behind her, Carl spoke in a low voice. "With the family in its current state, a party might not draw much of a crowd."



"I'm aware of that. It's their choice to attend or not.What matters is that Eliana receives the welcome she deserves. She's endured more than enough already,and I won't have her slighted," replied Stella, her tone unwavering.


She also saw the party as a quiet test. Those who showed up would be remembered, and those who didn't would have their absence noted.



Carl gave a firm nod.


"Make sure everything's ready. And get Eliana's room in order so she can settle in comfortably. She's endured enough already, and no matter what we're facing, she deserves to be looked after," Stella said firmly.


"You don't need to worry, Mom. I'll handle it. You've been keeping it clean every week, so she can move in whenever she wants," Carl responded.


Although Stella gave a small nod, her mind was far from settled. She pulled out her phone and began browsing for clothes and daily necessities she thought Eliana might need.


The sight of the worn, outdated outfit Eliana had been wearing earlier brought a sharp ache to her chest.



In the past, she hadn't had the chance to care for her daughter properly. But now that Eliana was home-even though her own health was still fragile-Stella felt an urgent need to make up for lost time.


While scrolling, her lips would curve into a smile, only for her eyes to mist over seconds later, the emotions coming in waves.







In another part of the house, Eliana was measuring herbs for Stella's medicine.



Ever since her daughter had gone missing, Stella's health had never been the same, so the household always kept a steady supply of medicinal plants.


That made gathering the ingredients a simple task for Eliana.



"Let it simmer gently for about an hour," she told Jordy before making her way toward Stella's room. On the way, her attention drifted to her phone. She began reviewing the report about the Murray family that Seth Baxter, one of her subordinates, had sent over.



Before his arrest, Louis had been an influential figure in Qidence. His six sons, however, seemed far less impressive-especially Damon Murray, the firstborn,who had been born with a condition that confined him to a wheelchair.


Seth's messages kept coming in a rush. "The Murray family's done for. If you see any signs of trouble, get out before they drain you dry. If they're anything like the Holts, you're in for a world of problems."


Her reply was brief-"Okay"-before she slipped her phone awvay and headed up the stairs.


Years of dealing with people like Janessa had taught her never to lower her guard.


Until she knew exactly what kind of people she was dealing with, she had no intention of revealing anything personal. For now, the plan was simple-use her identity as the Murray family's long-lost daughter to secure a smooth relocation of the Onyx Syndicate to Qidence.


Halfway down the hall, a sharp, pained gasp caught her ear.



She stopped, turned the handle, and stepped inside.


The sight waiting for her was Sean.


He was trying to pour himself a glass of water, but the awkward angle of his dislocated arm left him clumsy and pale with sweat. By the time the cup was half full, his face was tight with pain.


The creak of the door made him glance up.


When his eyes landed on Eliana, his expression soured. "What, did you come to watch me suffer?"


Without answering, Eliana walked straight toward him, ignoring the suspicion in his eyes, and took hold of his injured arm.


"What are you doing?" Sean tried to pull back, alarmed, but Eliana's grip was like an eagle'stalon,firm and unyielding.


"Dammit,you're asking for it!" he barked, his voice rising.


His left hand lifted to strike Eliana, but the motion stalled as a strange sensation hit him-strength flooding back into his right arm.


Testing his wrist, he realized the pain had vanished.


It dawned on him then-she had just reset his joint without a single word.


By the time he looked up, Eliana was already walking out the door.
###Chapter 8 She Would Make Her Pay





Sean opened his mouth to call Eliana back, but she had already slipped through the doorway and


disappeared without saying anything, leaving him staring blankly for a few seconds.


A short while ago, he had thought she was nothing but a nuisance. Now, the thought crossed his mind that maybe she wasn't as intolerable as he believed.


Even so, his resolve to bring Leyla back solidified all over again. In his mind, Leyla was still his sister.


Flexing his newly restored arm, his eyes drifted toward the window.


His room sat on the second floor. It wasn't high enough to worry him.


Without a second thought, he slid the lock on the door, crossed to the wwindow, and leapt down. From what he knew, Leyla was probably staying at the Clarkes' estate. Her fiancé, Hector Clarke, was the eldest son of the family.


No matter what it took, Sean was determined to bring Leyla back.


With Carl and Stella clearly favoring Eliana, he had no reason to rely on their words. The truth was something he needed to see with his own eyes.







By the time Eliana returned to Stella's room, Stella had already drifted into a deep sleep, her fingers still curled protectively around her phone.


Eliana carefully eased it from her hand to set it on the bedside table, but the glowing screen caught her attention.



The messages showed Stella asking someone to send over a selection of the newest clothing styles.


A faint warmth touched Eliana's chest. She pulled the blanket up over Stella's shoulders and slipped out of the room in silence.



Her phone lit up with a new message from Seth. It contained the location for the Onyx Syndicate's medical mission.



The text read, "I've already spoken with the Clarke family.You can head over whenever you're ready."


"I'm going now," Eliana replied, then went to find Carl to mention she wanted to step out for a walk.


"Let me come with you. You don't know this place well, and I'd hate for you to get lost," Carl said immediately.


Eliana responded by giving an address, "No. 1 Manor,Oak Avenue."



It was the Murray famnily's own address, her way of saying she could find her way back without trouble.


Carl rubbed at his temple. "Fine, but be back before it gets dark. And if anything happens, call me. I'll fix up your room while you're gone. Oh, here-my bank card. There's over a million on it. Use it for whatever you need."


"I don't need it. I've got money," said Eliana,waving off the offer.



Without giving her a chance to return it, Carl pressed the card into her palm. "Come on, how much could you really have? Don't be so polite. Buy yourself something you actually like. That outfit you're wearing is worn out. Go to the mall and pick something better."



If he had even the slightest idea what women preferred, he might have bought it for her himself.



Eliana's lips curved in a faint smile as she slipped the card into her pocket.



Since the Murray family's cars were far too noticeable, she decided to take a taxi instead.


About thirty minutes later, she was stepping through the doors of an herbal pharmacy.


"These are the herbs I need," she said. The shopkeeper accepted the list and studied Eliana with a wary look. "Young lady, these are no ordinary herbs. That Goosegrass you've written down-it's the rarest thing we have. Only one stalk left. Half a million for that alone."



"Money won't be an issue," Eliana responded.


The shopkeeper's eyes ran over her again. The worn-out, faded clothes she wore looked like something not even the poorest in Qidence would bother with.


As he noticed that, he scoffed and waved her away."Stop wasting my time. This is a serious shop, not a playground. Go before you cause trouble."


Before she could respond, a tall, well-dressed woman appeared in the doorway.


At once, the shopkeeper's expression brightened,and he stepped past Eliana to greet her.


"Welcome, Ms. Clarke! Picking up prescription again?" he asked.


Khloe gave a small nod. "Yes. The usual prescription, but add a stalk of Goosegrass this time. I heard you've got one."



"Ah, you really know your herbs! We do have it, but it's... quite expensive," he said, drawing out the words.



Khloe's brow lifted. "And you think I can't afford it?"


"Of course not! I'll have your order ready right away!"the shopkeeper replied with a smile.



He turned toward the storeroom, only to feel a slim but unyielding hand clamp onto his arm.


Startled, he spun around to find Eliana still standing there. Irritation flashed across his face. "Why are yoU still here? Leave now, or I'll call the police."


"That stalk of Goosegrass should go to me. I asked for it first," Eliana said evenly.


Khloe's eyes slid toward her, taking in the messy hair and worn clothes before a low, cold laugh slipped past her lips. She taunted, "You dare to challenge me for Goosegrass? Who exactly do you think you are? You don't even know who you're talking to, do you?"



"First come, first served," Eliana replied without so much as a blink.



Khloe let out a short, amused breath. "Cameron,since when do you let beggars shop here?"


The shopkeeper, Cameron Garrett, shook his head quickly. "Absolutely not. She came out of nowhere,and I'll deal with her right now."


His glare hardened as he turned on Eliana and barked, "This is your last warning. Leave."



Eliana remained unfazed, repeating, "First come, first served."



"You-"Cameron's voice rose, ready to snap.


Before he could, Khloe snapped her fingers, and two tall bodyguards strode in as if they'd been waiting for the cue. Tilting her chin toward Eliana, Khloe gave the order."Help Cameron remove this beggar from my sight."


"Right away!" Without hesitation, the two advanced on Eliana, their expressions hard as stone.


Before their hands could land on her, Eliana's foot shot upward in a swift arc, her kick slamming one guard into the wall so hard the shelves rattled. He crumpled to the floor, clutching his side and groaning, unable to rise.


The second guard's eyes narrowed. His grip on the stun baton tightened before he swung it toward her with brutal force.



A blow like that to the head could have been deadly.Khloe, however, looked on without the slightest concern.



In her mind, Eliana was nothing more than a nobody.lf the police got involved, the Clarke family's influence would tip the scales in her favor.


That thought brought a cold curve to her lips as she st waited to see Eliana flattened.


Instead, Eliana's leg lashed out again, knocking the baton clean from his hand. His fingers throbbed from the impact, and he winced in pain.


He couldn't help but marvel at her speed and raw power, a suspicion forming that she must have ties to the Fist Guild.



Before he had the chance to move, Eliana seized his collar and slammed him hard against the counter.


A burst of blood streamed from his forehead, and his body went limp in an instant.


Khloe froze for a heartbeat before stumbling backward a few steps. "Who are you? I'm warning you, I'm a Clarke. You'll regret crossing me!"


Eliana's gaze stayed as cold and steady as a winter pond, her eyelids lifting only slightly at the mention of the Clarke name.


She let the bloodied bodyguard drop and shifted her attention to Cameron, who stared at her as if he couldn't believe what he'd just seen.


"Will you sell me the Goosegrass or not?" she said.


"|-I..." Cameron's voice faltered.



Khloe's face hardened, and she cut in sharply."Cameron, if you hand that over to her, I'll see to it your shop's doors never open again."


Cameron's shoulders trembled. Just as he was about to speak, he felt Eliana's piercing gaze fix on him. His throat tightened as he swallowed, and in that moment, his decision was made.



Grinding his teeth, he said, "Half a million for a single stalk of Goosegrass. Can you pay it?"


The question was for Eliana.


With a flick of her wrist, she placed a sleek black bank card on the counter. "Go ahead,charge it."


Skepticism lingered on Cameron's face as he slid the card through the card machine, yet the screen confirmed the half-million transaction without hesitation.


"I'll fetch it right away," he blurted out.


Panic surged in Khloe's voice. "Cameron, have you lost your mind?! Do you actually want to throw your business away?"


Cameron didn't bother replying. He strode into the storeroom, returned with every herb Eliana had requested, and presented them to her with both hands.



Survival came first. No sum was worth gambling with his own life. Besides, the sale alone could keep him comfortable for a long while. If it came to it, moving elsewhere and starting fresh was far better than dying where he stood.


Something in him knew that Eliana had the means to end him without a second thought.


Eliana took the herbs, slipped the bank card back into her pocket, and walked out without looking back.


Khloe stepped forward fast enough to cut her off. "You're not walking out of here!"


Eliana's gaze swept over her coldly. "Do you honestly think you can stop me over this?"


That piercing glare was so forceful, Khloe's voice faltered before she could muster a reply.


Only two bodyguards flanked her, and neither could stand against Eliana. Without the slightest combat skill herself, her chances were nonexistent.


When Khloe went silent, Eliana clutched the bundle of herbs tighter and strode out of the pharmacy without another word.



Humiliation burned through Khloe, and her jaw tightened until her teeth ached. She etched the moment deep into memory, vowing that the next time their paths crossed, she would make her pay.


Cameron stammered cautiously, "Ms. Clarke...there's another herb with properties close to Goosegrass..."


"Shut up!" Khloe shot him a sharp glare. "Your pharmacy will be shut down tomorrow!"


She lashed out at the bloodied bodyguard with a swift kick. "Worthless! Get up and keep moving!"


Missing out on the Goosegrass would earn her parents' wrath.


The miracle doctor they had secured would be arriving soon, and the person's instructions had been clear: they wanted Goosegrass.


Khloe had to move quickly, searching other herbal shops before it was too late.


Outside, Neal sat waiting in the car, ready to drive her to the next ddestination.
###Chapter 9 Tristan Pearson





From the doors of a herbal pharmacy, Khloe emerged with a storm in her expression, striding toward the luxury car parked across the street.


Before she could reach it, the driver's side opened and a man with sharp, refined features stepped out in a hurry.


A tailored suit hugged his frame, and the glint of gold-rimmed glasses added a polished, intellectual edge to his appearance.


The man was Neal.


He had once been just another marketing employee at the Clarke Group, but his connection with Khloe had propelled him upward. Now he was the General Manager of Public Relations-and soon to be her husband.


The moment their eyes met, a trace of softness slipped into Khloe's guarded face, and her voice carried the weightof her frustration. "Neal..."


But Neal's gaze slid right past her, locking instead on a lone figure in the distance.


The silhouette was slim, graceful-and something about it stirred a shock of recognition. It was SO much like Eliana.



That thought made no sense. Eliana had died in a fire. There was no way she could be here. Was his mind just conjuring ghosts?


He tried to shake it off. Years had passed, and it was easy to see traces of her in a stranger's outline.


Even so, unease clung to him, whispering that he wouldn't be able to rest until he knew for certain.


If Eliana was truly alive, and the Clarke family learned he had once been engaged to her, the wedding with Khloe could collapse overnight.


He had just taken a step toward the figure, readly to close the distance, when Khloe's voice cut him off. "Neal, where are you going?"


The question snapped him back, and he quickly smoothed his features into an easy smnile."Thought I caught sight of someone | used to know."


"Who exactly?" Khloe's tone sharpened with suspicion.





Dropping his gaze, Neal's voice was mild. "NNo one that matters."



Khloe tugged lightly at his sleeve. "Then forget it and get in. We still have other pharmacies to check-l need those herbs."



Only then did Neal's attention shift fully back to her.


Her eyes were red, and the two bodyguards behind her looked as if they'd been through a scuffle.Something had clearly gone wrong.


"What happened? Who laid a hand on you?" His voice was edged with concern.


"A damn bitch!" Khloe spat, fury flashing in her eyes. "She attacked my bodyguards and grabbed the Goosegrass I came for!"


"Who is she? How dare she cross you?" Neal's tone hardened instantly. "Tell me where she is, and I'll deal with her right now."


The fire in Khloe's expression eased, satisfaction curling at the corners of her mouth. She gave a dismissive shake of her head. "Forget it. She's just some upstart from who knows where-and she can fight. I only brought two bodyguards today, and even you wouldn't be able to take her."


"Then we find out who she is, and we'll handle her later," Neal said, his tone low and coaxing.


A determined nod followed. "Exactly. I'll make sure she pays me back for this. But right now, we have to focus on finding that Goosegrass my parents want.I already told them you'd found it and would deliver it today. If we don't, they'll turn their criticism on you again."


Khloe's family had never warmed to Neal. His modest upbringing was enough for them to look down on him, and they doubted he had the capability to take on anything significant. Still, Khloe's attachment had forced them into reluctant acceptance of the engagement.


Recognizing the urgency in her voice, Neal straightened. "Then let's move. There's no way this is the only place selling Goosegrass."


"Agreed. Let's get going." Khloe ended the discussion there, bending down and sliding into the car.



Once Khloe was settled in the car, Neal cast one last glance toward where the familiar figure had been.


The street was empty. Whoever it was had vanished without a trace.



He drew in a steadying breath, telling himself it had only been a trick of the eye-someone who merely resembled Eliana. Inside the Moonlight Club, thick coils of smoke curled above a card table where a group of men played intently.


A striking woman stood behind each man, ready to flick a lighter or refill a glass at the slightest gesture.


At the center sat a man in a perfectly pressed white shirt, sleeves rolled to his elbows, the muscle in his forearms shifting as he held his cards.


Even in the middle of the game, there was a refined composure in the way he moved, as though he were studying a fine work of art rather than chasing a win.


With features that turned heads in any room, he carried the kind of presence that made people look twice.


A few hands later, he slid his cards across the felt with quiet finality.


Polite applause broke out around the table.


"Another full house? Mr. Pearson, your luck's unbeatable!" one of the men said with a grin. "It's more than luck," a blonde woman behind the man added, passing him a glass of wine. "I saw his starting hand-it was terrible. This was pure skill."


Leaning forward to serve the drink, she moved in a way that effortlessly drew the eye to the shape of her figure.


Her tone was soft, almost coaxing. "Mr. Pearson,would you care to try the wine here? It's made in-house..."



"Much obliged," Tristan Pearson said, accepting the glass without so much as looking up.


A sudden tilt of her wrist sent the deep red liquid spilling over the rim, splattering across his sleeve.


The crisp white fabric instantly bloomed with a dark crimson stain.



From across the table, Hector Clarke shoved back his chair and got to his feet, irritation hardening his voice.


"Anaya, what on earth are you doing? Get Mr. Pearson upstairs and help him change-now."


Anaya Perry's eyes lingered on Tristan, heavy with unspoken intent. "Mr. Pearson, shall I take you up to freshen up?"


Tristan rose with unhurried grace. "Lead the way."


When Tristan didn't turn her down, Hector's shoulders eased, and he traded a quick glance with Anaya.


Catching the signal, her smile deepened into something far more enticing. "Mr. Pearson, this way please."


Together, Anaya and Tristan disappeared up the staircase, vanishing around the corner under Hector's watchful eyes.


Leaning toward the man beside him, Hector lowered his voice. "I dropped a fortune on him at the card table today and even sent Anaya over. You think he's satisfied now?"



The subordinate gave a knowing chuckle. "Of course. Money and women-what man can say no?Especially to someone like Anaya. She's the kind that leaves a man wanting more."


"Still," Hector muttered, "it feels like he's not entirely pleased. You think he's still nursing a grudge from before?"



"You're reading too much into it," the other man replied easily. "Back when he was just the Pearson family's illegitimate son, plenty of people mocked and stepped on him. If he planned to take revenge on every one of them, half the city would be gone by now. The way we treated him today should make it clear where we stand."


Hector said nothing, the reminder settling over him.


Once, Tristan had been nothing more than the Pearson family's illegitimate heir.


Only a month earlier, Elbert Pearson-the head of the powerful Pearson family-had stunned everyone by naming Tristan as the heir to the Pearson Group,while the legitimate son was quietly shipped overseas.


When most people expected Tristan to crumble under the weight of the position, he dismantled those assumptions with calculated precision, taking over the company in a matter of weeks through bold and ruthless moves.



Now, not only the Pearson Group but also its allied businesses operated under his command.


To rise in just a month from the family's scorned illeggitimate son to its uncontested leader was nothing short of remarkable.



That very rise was the reason Hector never let his guard down.


He, after all, had once been among the men who had sneered openly at Tristan, calling him a bastard without a second thought.


"Relax," the subordinate said with an easy grin. "Even if we can't win him over ourselves, Anaya can.You know better than anyone how good she is at dealing with men."


A slow smirk crossed Hector's face. "You're right."


Polished manners or not, Hector figured, Tristan had still followed Anaya upstairs after nothing more than a single,well-placed look.


To Hector, that only proved one thing-no matter how refined they seemed in public, all men were the same behind closed doors.

###Chapter 10 A Mysterious Girl





Sensing Hector's posture ease slightly, the subordinate grew bolder, words spilling out unchecked. "Tristan's trip to Qidence is all about securing a foothold for the Pearson Group in this cutthroat market. With the Murray family on the brink of collapse, the Clarke family can practically run the place. Tristan will need our backing sooner or later.Why else would he suggest we visit your grandpa together tonight? There's nothing for you to worry about-he's the one who-"



The rest died in his throat as Hector's boot slammed into his side. The man folded over, unable to scream,cold sweat breaking across his forehead. He looked up at Hector, dazed and confused.


"Get him out of my sight," Hector instructed without even looking at him.


The country's business landscape had shifted, and this was Tristan's time to rule.


One careless remark like that, if it reached the wrong ears, could bring the entire Clarke family to ruin.


Hector knew then-he couldn't afford to keep someone so reckless close.


Two guards dragged the man away, his protests muffled by their grip.


With a flick of his fingers, Hector called another subordinate forward, saying, "Tell my famnily I'll return later-with Mr.Pearson."


In his mind, Tristan would need at least an hour to take care of whatever business he had come for. Not wanting to keep his family in suspense, Hector decided it was best to send word ahead.



"Yes, sir." The subordinate gave a quick nod before hurrying off.


Hector had barely finished giving instructions when his phone buzzed on the table. The screen lit up with Leyla's name.


A small smile touched his lips as he answered,"Leyla, where are you?"


"I'm at the house you bought for me," Leyla said, her voice warm and soft enough to smooth the edges off his mood.



"How's the renovation? Does it suit you?" he asked.


"I love it. Feels exactly like my style," Leyla replied without hesitation.



After a brief pause, her tone turned more tentative."I've done what you suggested... I've cut all ties with the Murray family. That means your parents won't stand in the way anymore, right?"


"Of course not," Hector replied. "They've never cared for the Murray family. Now that you're no longer connected to them, there's no reason they wouldn't welcome you."


Leyla's shoulders seemed to lighten. That fear-that the Clarke family might still reject her even after severing ties-began to loosen its grip. If things didn't go well, cutting ties with the Murray family would have meant nothing.


"Start getting ready," Hector said in a low, steady voice. "I'll send someone to pick you up in an hour.We'll go meet my family. A miracle doctor is visiting today-if they can treat my grandpa's illness, my family will be in a good mood. It might be the perfect time to bring up our marriage."


"That's wonderful! I'll get dressed right away," Leyla responded, her excitement barely contained.


"Good."







On the Moonlight Club's second floor, Anaya moved with the confidence of someone who knew exactly where she was going.


Stopping at Room 208, she pushed the door open.Heavy curtains sealed the room in darkness. "Please, Mr. Pearson," she said, gesturing Tristan inside.



Tristan stepped in, his face unreadable.


His cool demeanor didn't shake her composure.Determination still burned in her gaze.


In her mind, men were all the same-charming gentlemen under bright lights, but when the shadows closed in, even the most disciplined revealed their true desires.



Tonight, she intended to win him over.


Becoming his girlfriend wasn't her goal; she knew the odds. But sharing his bed, even just once, would put her in a league far above ordinary women.


The moment Tristan stepped into the room, Anaya slipped in behind him, twisting the lock with a soft click before pressing herself against his back.


His frame was unyielding, broad and solid, like running into a wall of iron. With wealth, power, and a face that could stop traffic,he was the kind of man any woman might lose her footing over.


Hooking her legs around his waist, she let her hand drift across the hard planes of his chest, fingertips grazing the first button of his shirt.


Blinding light exploded across the room without warning. A row of men in black stood at attention,their stillness and precision radiating the unmistakable discipline of trained bodyguards.


Anaya froze mid-breath."Who...who are you?"


Tristan's hands shoved her away with a force that left no doubt-her touch disgusted him.


Anaya hit the floor, stunned into silence, barely noticing the sting in her palms.


When she drew in air to scream, a rough hand clamped over her mouth, smothering the sound.


Tristan's gaze was ice-cold as he spoke, each word clipped and final. "One hour. I want every detail." "Yes,sir."


Two of the men hauled Anaya toward the adjoining bedroom. The door shut behind them with a sharp,final click, cutting off the rest of the world.


A man with a buzz cut stepped forward, holding out a freshly pressed suit jacket for Tristan.


This was Rocco Hewitt-Tristan's most trusted right hand.



Without a word, Tristan shrugged off his shirt, the fabric falling away to reveal the solid lines of a well-built chest, before sliding into the clean jacket.


The discarded clothes landed in the trash with a careless flick.



Rocco's eyes flicked upward.


With thick brows, deep-set eyes, and a sharp nose Tristan's features were already arresting. The crisp white shirt and black vest fit him with tailored precision, enhancing the commanding height and authority he carried. He might have looked like a refined gentleman, but there was a predatory edge beneath the polish-one glance was enough to demand submission.


Lowering his gaze respectfully, Rocco spoke in a quiet tone. "Anaya's one of Hector's sharper tools. If we can break her, we might confirm whether the Clarke family was behind your drugging last year."


Tristan gave a low hum, then shifted the subject."Still no sign of her?"


Rocco shook his head. "Not yet... but we have more breathing room now. I'll have her found within a month."



"Do it faster," Tristan instructed.


That drug from a year ago had been chosen for one purpose-to make sure he failed the very first project assigned to him by the last purported successor of the Pearson family.


If not for that mysterious girl, he would have been disgraced in front of the world and cast out of the Pearson family. Everything he had now would have slipped through his fingers.


In his head, he owed her a debt he could never fully repay. In his heart, she haunted him-appearing in his dreams almost every night.


But the memories were a blur, her face forever out of focus, nothing more than a shadow in his mind. That was why he had spent so long chasing a ghost.


Studying Tristan's expression, Rocco finally spoke."Mr. Pearson, you're promised to the Murray couple's daughter since young. If we do find this girl, what happens to the agreement?"


"It was arranged when I was a child," Tristan said, his tone dismissive. "It means nothing now."


Rocco hesitated. "But the chairman wants to see you married while he's still alive. The doctors... they don't think he has long."


Tristan's eyes locked on him, unyielding. "Then find her-fast." Since taking control of the Pearson Group, he had crossed paths with more socialites than he cared to count-and the more he met, the less he could stand them.



If marriage was inevitable, then it might as well be to the girl who had once saved him. At least, her touch didn't make his skin crawl.


Rocco dipped his head in acknowledgment before adding, "The Murray family never pushed the engagement before, but things are different now.You're the head of the Pearson family, and they've just gone bankrupt. They might try to shove their daughter into your life. I've also heard their biological daughter's been found..."


"Tomorrow," Tristan said, his voice even, "I'll pay the Murray family a visit and settle it myself."


Rocco gave another short nod.


At that moment, the bedroom door swung open, and Anaya emerged, her hair in disarray as she was escorted out.
###Chapter 11| Have Already Slept With You





Anaya bore no marks on her skin, yet the slump of her shoulders and the hollow look in her eyes told of a breaking far worse than any wound.


The man holding her by the arm-a jagged scar running just shy of his right eye-shoved her forward without ceremony, and she crumpled at Tristan's feet.



"I squeezed everything out of her," the man said."She breaks easily. A few moves and she started spilling every last bit."


Rocco let out a quiet scoff. "Doran, you ever think about going easier on women? Half the men I know wouldn't survive what you just pulled."


A cold smirk cut across Doran Shaw's face. "We don't have time to be gentle. She's sly, and she wouldn't talk without a push."


Shaking,Anaya dropped to her knees. "Please... I've told you all I know. Just let me go. I swear, there's nothing else."


Tristan didn't so much as glance at her.


For someone who looked so frail, she had a history of luring prey into her snare and there were likely more than a few.


"So what did she give you?" he asked.


Doran answered instantly, "She's the one who slipped something into your drink last year. Hector had nothing to do with it. Somebody else called the shots. Promised her a fat payday when it was done."


"Who sent her?"



"Jermaine Pearson."



Tristan's brow lifted, but there was no surprise in his eyes.


Jermaine was his own half-brother. For years, people believed Tristan was a bastard. The truth was far uglier. On the day he and Jermaine wvere born, someone had switched them in secret. From then on, the true heir wore the stain of being a bastard, while the real bastard lived in privilege and wealth. Only a few months ago did the truth come crawling into the light, and Tristan stepped back into the family that should have been his. Whatever he had suffered in those decades was his alone to carry.



"So Jermaine knew the whole time he wasn't the rightful heir?"


Rocco nodded. "Everything we've dug up says so.lf he hadn't known, why slip something in your drink?Why tear down your plans from the inside?"


Doran was furious. "Unbelievable. That son of a bitch ran off overseas, acting like some poor victim,swearing he didn't know a thing. We let him live because of that. Say the word, Mr. Pearson, and I'll hunt him down myself."


The two had been at Tristan's side since they were boys. They had seen firsthand how Jermaine's real mother treated him.



A jagged scar carved across Tristan's back told a story of cruelty-Jermaine's mother had poured boiling oil over him when he was just fourteen,punishing him for the sin of scoring higher than her precious son in the finals.


Back then, Rocco and Doran couldn't make sense of it. How could a woman treat her "own child" with such viciousness? The answer came only when the truth surfaced-Tristan was never her child at all.


Their hatred for her had always run deep, but after that revelation, it became something far darker.


And finding out Jermaine had known all along,keeping the truth buried, made their blood run hotter.To them, that smug hypocrite deserved nothing less than death.



Trying to rein in the tension, Rocco said, "Cool it,Doran. Mr. Pearson has every eye in the city watching him right now. One wrong move and it's  straight down from the top. We're here to protect him, not blow everything up."


Grinding his teeth, Doran grabbed Anaya by the collar. "If Jermaine's off-limits, then maybe we start with this lying bitch."



Anaya's eyes went wide with panic. "P-please...Don't kill me! I'll keep my mouth shut,I promise!"


"You're not in a position to bargain."


Doran's grip tightened and his killing intent poured out, but Tristan's voice cut through like a blade. "Put her down. Kill her, and Hector will make sure we pay for it."



"Perhaps we should kill Hector too. It's not like he's any better!"



Tristan's stare didn't waver. "Keep talking like that,and I'll send you away."


Doran's shoulders stiffened, and the words died on his tongue. Tristan's tone left no room for doubt. "Sir, what do you want done with her?" asked Rocco.


One glance from Tristan was all it took. Rocco strode over to Anaya and shoved a pill past her lips before she could resist.



"Mmff-ugh-"


Anaya tried to resist, but Rocco's polished suit and tidy manner hid a brutal efficiency. One sharp tilt of her chin, and he forced the pill down.


"What...what was that?"


Tristan responded coldly, "Keep your mouth shut and you live. You'll need to come see me for the antidote every month."


Leaning in closer, Rocco added, "That pill you swallowed is called Bone-Eater. If you miss a single dose, it'll hollow you out from the inside until you're nothing but dust."


A violent shiver ran through Anaya, terror widening her eyes. She clung to Tristan's leg, sobbing. "I was wrong... Mr. Pearson, I shouldn't have done it! I never should have drugged you! Please... please, let me live!"



Rocco yanked her back, knowing how Tristan hated the slightest touch.


Disgust flickered in Tristan's eyes as he stepped back. "Get yourself cleaned up and follow me downstairs. And don't forget this-l've already slept with you."







Qidence was full of pretenders draped in borrowed glory, but only two houses had ever truly stood above the rest-the once-powerful Murrays and the enduring Clarke family.


With the Murrays on the brink of collapse, the Clarkes alone held the city's highest ground. Their gates never stayed still, with luxury cars gliding in and out as visitors arrived bearing gifts and pledges of loyalty.


Terry Sutton, the family's long-serving butler, turned away a party insisting they had business with Miguel,the old patriarch. He had just begun his walk back inside when the growl of a red sports car's engine rolled across the driveway.


Lifting his gaze, he spotted Leyla stepping out, and a smile touched his lips-one edged with something unreadable.



Business rivalries had long kept the Clarke and Murray families circling each other like predators.Even so, Leyla had always shared a quiet closeness with Hector.


After the Murray family collapsed, Hector's parents laid down the law-no more meetings with Leyla.Hector, however, refused to obey, and Terry never had the heart to come down on him too hard.



"Ms. Murray, were you hoping to see Hector? I'm afraid he isn't in at the moment."



She extended a neatly wrapped gift box toward him."Brought you something from my last trip overseas,Terry. Thought you might like it." "That's kind of you, but I really couldn't-"


"It's yours.Please accept it. I don't want to waste it."


His eyes flicked to the stamped brand mark, and though his expression remained polite, he took the box without further protest and said, "Thank you...though I should warn you, we have some very high-profile guests arriving today. It mnight be wiser to visit anothe time."



"I already know," Leyla said lightly. "Hector told me to drop by."



"Even so-"



"You have my word I'll stay out of the way. If you don't let me in now, I'll wait out front and walk in with him when he arrives."



With Hector escorting her, it would no longer be Terry's responsibility.


Terry agreed readily. "In that case, l'll ask you to wait here for a bit.u "No trouble at all. Go on with your work, I'll be fine here."


"Alright..." Terry replied, turning to head back toward the house-when the rumble of a taxi pulling up to the gate made him pause.


The estate sat in an exclusive district where every driveway gleamed with expensive vehicles. It was the first time he saw a taxi stop at the gates.


When the passenger stepped out and Terry caught sight of their clothing, his surprise deepened into something close to disbelief.
###Chapter 12 The Contract's Void





A woman climbed out of the taxi and approached the main house,wrapped in worn-out clothes. The jacket caught the most attention, covered in mismatched patches that made the wearer look like someone barely hanging on.


Terry stared, stunned. Since when did beggars start showing up in taxis?


Leyla caught the odd look on his face and, curious,followed where he was staring. Her eyes narrowed the moment she recognized the newcomer. "Why is it you?"


It was Eliana.



Leyla's mind immediately jumped to the same conclusion: the Murrays must have sent Eliana to plead with her to return.


She had expected this day might come, though she hadn't thought it would happen so qquickly.


If the family had already fallen on hard times, it made sense they would track her down after hearing she was with Hector. In their minds, she figured, maybe she could be convinced to help them. The same people who had told her to leave now wanted her back? Pathetic.



Her jaw tightened. She moved to block Eliana's way."Leave. Tell Mom I'm done with all of you. Don't ever show your face to me again."


Eliana met Leyla's gaze with an unreadable calm,her eyes as steady as if carved from glass. "That woman isn't your mother anymore. You should call her Mrs.Murray."


A short laugh escaped Leyla, laced with scorn."That's rich, coming from a country bumpkin with no sense of manners. Is this your idea of asking for help? Relax, I'm not about to fight you for her."


In truth, Leyla had no desire to tangle with the Murray family now.Competing with some rustic nobody for anyone's favor? The thought alone was laughable."Before | decide you've worn out my patience, get out of my sight."


"I didn't come here for you," Eliana said, a faint smile tugging at her lips.


Leyla's brow furrowed. "Then what are you doing here? Don't tell me the Murrays sent you running to the Clarkes for charity."


The idea was absurd. Once fierce rivals, the Clarke and Murray families had never wasted a breath on kindness toward each other. With the Murrays in hot water, the Clarke family would be the last to lend a hand.



Eliana's face didn't change. "My reasons aren't yours to know."



Without another glance at Leyla, she wvalked straight toward Terry. "I'm here for Miguel."


Leyla darted in, yanking her back with a hard grip."Are you deaf, or just delusional? You think y/ou can waltz in and meet Miguel?"


Miguel's condition was so critical that even Leyla struggled to get a moment with him. The idea of Eliana gaining access was laughable.


Irritation flickered in Eliana's eyes. "Move aside."


Leyla's laugh was edged with venom. "By all means,go ahead. Let's see if Miguel will bother with you.And if you step through that door today, I'll eat my hat."



A faint smile touched Eliana's lips as she turned to Terry. "Tell your master the doctor he's been seeking has arrived."



The words hit Terry like a slap. He stared, wide-eyed."Wait... you're the healer we have been hunting down?"



"Go on, and make sure they come out to bring me in themselves."


The confidence in her voice made Terry think twice about brushing her off. If she truly was the doctor the Clarkes had been chasing for, turning her away could be a costly mistake.


He started toward the house.


The sight jolted Leyla into action.


Eliana might be unfazed, but Leyla's nerves were already fraying.


The Clarkes barely tolerated her as it was, and if Eliana tricked them, their fury would inevitably land on her. The thought was enough to send her lunging forward to grab Terry's sleeve. "Don't be fooled,Terry. She's the long-lost daughter of the Murray couple-disappeared over twenty years ago and just turned up in some backwater village. She's no miracle doctor. Let her in and, when the Clarkes find out, they'll be furious at both of us."


Terry's brows shot up. "She's from the Murray family?"


Rumor had it that the Murray couple once  lost their beloved youngest daughter, a tragedy that left Stella in pieces and pushed Louis to bring Leyla into their home.


Never had Terry imagined that very woman would be standing before him now... and in such worn, pitiful clothes that spoke volumes about how far the Murrays had fallen.


"That's her," Leyla said with a sharp nod. "The family sent her here for some scheme. Don't believe a word she says."


"Appreciate the warning," Terry replied. "I nearly let her fool me."



His gaze cut toward Eliana, turning cold. "Leave.Now. Or I'll have you dragged out."


Eliana's smile was almost mocking. "So you're certain? No chance you'll regret this?"


"What's there to regret? No one from the Murray family is welcome here!" He hesitated, then glanced at Leyla. "Of course, that doesn't apply to you."

 
"I know," Leyla said evenly. "I've cut ties with them completely."


With a low grunt, Terry faced Eliana again. "Well,Miss? Will you walk out on your own, or should I make the choice for you?"


"I'm done here." Eliana spun on her heel and walked off, already pulling out her phone. "Seth, tell the Clarke family their butler refused to let me in. The contract is void. And the deposit stays with us."


"You're kidding me?" Seth's voice shot up in disbelief."They bent over backwards to get through to the Onyx Syndicate. You wouldn't have taken this case yourself if it weren't for the publicity in Qidence.And now they won't even let you inside?"


"That's exactly what happened."


"Understood. I'll deliver the news right away."


Ending the call, Eliana slowed her pace, letting her eyes wander over the brilliant red maples blazing through the pristine neighborhood.


Her taxi was long gone, so the only choice was to walk to the gates before flagging down another ride.


From the house's door, Terry's eyes followed her receding figure, an uneasy weight settling in his chest.



Relief washed over Leyla the moment Eliana was gone. At least she wouldn't be left holding the blame this time.



Without Louis to steady them, she believed the Murray famnily must have lost every shred of sense,sending some country woman to stir trouble at the Clarke estate. Did they honestly believe the Clarke family were people they could toy with now? The Clarkes had already shown more restraint than expected by not crushing the Murrays when they had the chance, yet here they showed up uninvited. It was reckless to the point of stupidity. No surprise the family would collapse once Louis was taken away-without him, they were hopeless.


Leyla believed cutting all ties with the Murray family had been the smartest thing she'd ever done; staying connected would have dragged her straight into their ruin.


A sudden bang of hinges snapped her from her thoughts.


The front door flew open, and Leyla's head turned instinctively. Hector's parents, Jeffry and Ruby Clarke, rushed out, urgency written in every step.


"Mr.-"



Leyla's face brightened in an instant, her greeting poised on her lips, but Jeffry brushed past her with a forceful shove.


She staggered, catching herself just before she lost her footing. When she turned, Jeffry was already sweeping the surroundings with a sharp, urgent gaze, clearly looking for someone.


A jolt shot through her chest. Could it be... 
###Chapter 13 The Miracle Doctor





Was Jeffry's search really for Eliana? And could she be the miracle doctor they had brought in for Miguel?


Leyla brushed the notion aside almost immediately.In her mind, the only explanation was that the real doctor must have arrived at the same time by coincidence.



Jeffry's eyes swept the area in vain before he grabbed Terry by the collar. "Where's the doctor?"


"I've been here the whole time. No doctor has shown up," said Terry, shaking his head without thinking.


At that, Jeffry's attention shifted sharply to Ruby, the one who had answered the earlier call.


Ruby's words tumbled out without hesitation. "No way! The person on the line was certain. They told me she came, but our butler blocked her at the entrance." The color drained from Terry's face. "Don't tell me Ms.Murray was-"


"Ms. Murray? What the hell are you talking about?Did the doctor come or not?" Jeffry yelled.


Flustered, Terry replied, "A woman did show up, but it wasn't a doctor. It was the Murray couple's lost daughter. She was just brought back from the countryside. Leyla can confirm it. I didn't turn the doctor away."



Leyla took the opening and jumped in, saying,"That's right. The visitor was Eliana, the Murray couple's lost daughter. No doctor came here."


Jeffry and Ruby exchanged glances. Both had heard whispers of the Murray family's tangled affairs.


Yet the message had been clear-the doctor had been turned away.


This so-called miracle doctor rarely left her practice,and it had taken considerable effort through the Onyx Syndicate to reach her. Was it possible that the daughter the Murrays had just reclaimed from the countryside was the very doctor they had sought?The Clarkes were no longer certain.



Ruby's voice wavered as she asked, "Honey, what do we do now?" She lingered in doubt, torn over whether bringing Eliana back was the right move.


Tension had always run high between the Clarkes and the Murrays, and the thought of humbling themselves before Eliana twisted her stomach.


If Eliana truly was the doctor, should they swallow their pride and beg for her help?


Jeffry didn't waste a second thinking about it. With a swift kick to Terry's side, he shouted, "What are you waiting for? Go after her right now!"


His entire standing in the Clarke family's power circle came from Miguel's influence. Losing Miguel would mean losing every chance of climbing higher.


That meant if Eliana really was the doctor, he had no choice but to bring her back to save Miguel. "I'll head ouut right away!" Terry said, nodding quickly.


Before he could take more than a step, Jeffry's voice cut in. "Hold on!"


"Is there something else, sir?" Terry asked,straightening immediately.


"I'll go myself," Jeffry declared, convinced that nothing about this doctor's visit could be left to chance.



With Miguel's life hanging by a thread, only this mysterious figure could pull him back.


"I'm going too!" Ruby blurted, not bothering to think it over before hurrying after her husband.


Leyla's face drained of color as she watched them leave. The idea that Eliana might truly be the miracle doctor was something she could not accept.



To Leyla, the Murray family was nothing but a family of failures-six sons, all either broken or useless.


A woman like Eliana, lost in childhood and raised in some rural nowhere, couldn't possibly have become a doctor of any real skill.


Even so, something unexplainable pushed Leyla to follow them outside.



She doubted Eliana was the doctor the Clarkes wanted, but part of her needed proof.


Across town, Tristan stepped down from the Moonlight Club's second floor.


The sight had Hector setting aside his cards at once,greeting him with a practiced smile.


Still, the speed of Tristan's return nagged at him. It had been less than ten minutes since he'd gone upstairs with Anaya.


For a man at his age, that was unusually quick. Or maybe Anaya hadn't managed to charm him?


Hector's eyes flicked toward Anaya, and she gave the faintest confirming nod.


That was all he needed to know his plan had gone exactly as intended.


An inward smirk tugged at him, paired with the thought that perhaps Tristan's performance in bed was quite bad.


But Hector understood that nothing bruised a man's pride faster than such an implication.


So he kept it to himself and asked lightly, "Mr.Pearson, shall we go to my family home,or would you like another round?"


"Let's see your grandpa first. Games can wait,"Tristan said.



"Of course. This way." Hector motioned for his man to lead Tristan toward the waiting car.


He slowed his steps, leaning close enough to murmur,"Did Mr. Pearson find you to his liking?"


Playing the part exactly as Tristan had told her,Anaya let a faint blush creep onto her cheeks. "More than that. He said he wants me around for a few more days. What's your opinion?" Hector didn't hesitate. "If he's pleased with you, then stay. Just make sure you pass along anything you notice about him."


"Understood," Anaya said smoothly, though the slight tremor in her hands was hidden behind her back.



At the entrance, their paths diverged.


Anaya was escorted to Tristan's residence, while Tristan himself joined Hector in the same car bound for the Clarkes' estate.



As the driver pulled away, Hector explained, "My parents reached out to the Onyx Syndicate. They claim to have found a doctor capable of curing my grandfather."



One browlifted, Tristan's tone edged with curiosity."The Onyx Syndicate?"


"Yes. Their base is in Eighvale, and their reputation's solid. If you want something done, they're the people to find-they claim there's nothing they can't handle," Hector said.


Tristan gave no immediate reply.


From what he knew, the Onyx Syndicate accepted a wide range of jobs, often brushing against the power and interests of the upper class.


Lately, with several of their Eighvale branches under pressure, it seemed they were setting their sights on Qidence.



Right now, Eighvale was a mess-two political heavyweights locked in a stubborn standoff.


Groups with influence always drew fire, and the Syndicate Onyx's neutral stance would only make them a target sooner or later.


Relocating before the crosshairs settled on them was the smart move.



The thought stirred Tristan's curiosity about the person running the Syndicate. Despite all his reach,he had never once crossed paths with that elusive leader. Breaking the silence, Hector asked carefully, "Do you think they can be trusted?"


"Whatever else you might say about them," Tristan said at last, "their doctor is the real deal."


The answer drew a faint breath of relief from Hector.


In Eighvale, even the most powerful tread lightly around the Onyx Syndicate.


Tristan's lack of strong opinion eased whatever concern Hector had been holding.


If there'd been bad blood between the two sides,their upcoming meeting could have turned into a mess.



Meanwhile, Eliana stood by the road waiting for a taxi.



In a neighborhood where every family had their own driver, hailing one was like chasing a mirage.


She had just reached for her phone to call the Murrays for a ride when the sound of fast- approaching footsteps cut through the quiet.


"Ms. Murray! Wait!"


Were they talking to her? Confusion tugged at her brow as she turned, spotting a group rushing toward her.



At the front were two people dressed in obvious wealth,with Terry and Leyla trailing behind.
 ###Chapter 14 Holding Grudges





Eliana's brows drew together as she met the eyes of Jeffry and Ruby, who had hurried ahead of the rest.Her voice stayed steady. "What is it you want with me?"


The couple shared a quick glance before Jeffry stepped forward. "May I confirm-are you Ms.Murray, daughter of Louis and Stella?"


"That's right." If she intended to remain with the Murray family, she would have to grow accustomed to her new identity.


Leyla arrived just then. The moment she heard Eliana's answer, she turned to Jeffry without hesitation. "Mr. Clarke, you heard her. She's the woman the Murray couple picked up from the countryside. There's no way she's some miracle doctor."


Jeffry's gaze shifted back to Eliana, uncertain. "So... you're from the countryside?"


"Something like that," she replied.


Another wordless exchange passed between Jeffry and Ruby, both wondering if they'd made a mistake.Someone from the countryside-how likely was it she could be the renowned doctor from Eighvale?


Leyla's chest swelled with satisfaction. She was certain she hadn't misjudged the situation.


Her gaze cut to Eliana. "This is Mr. and Mrs. Clarke.Watch your mouth in front of them. Pretending to be someone you're not will only make you a joke."


A flicker passed through Eliana's eyes as the pieces fell into place-so this was why the Clarke couple had come. She had never intended to cross paths wvith the Clarke family again. There were plenty of other ways to raise the Onyx Syndicate's name; she didn't need their business. They had already cast her aside,so the patient was no longer her concern. But if Leyla was so eager to embarrass her, she was more than willing to humor her. Without sparing Leyla a glance, Eliana looked straight at Jeffry and Ruby. "Are you the ones who placed an order through the Onyx Syndicate?"


Onyx Syndicate? The very mention sent a jolt through the couple. The miracle doctor they'd sought had been contacted through that channel-a detail only they knew. The organization operated outside official channels, and as deputy mayor of Qidence, Jeffry and Ruby had every reason to keep that connection buried. Which meant... if she knew,she could only be one person. Their eyes widened,disbelief flashing across their faces.


Jeffry's voice shook. "You... you're the miracle doctor the Onyx Syndicate sent us?"


Eliana's brows lifted, a quiet air of authority settling over her. "That's right."


"You're lying!" Leyla snapped, jabbing a finger toward Eliana's face. "Are you deaf? Did you not hear a word I just said? If you have any shred of sense,stop parading around as some miracle doctor!" "Leyla!" Ruby's brows drew together, her tone clipped as she interjected, "I'm speaking with Ms.Murray.You have no place interrupting."


If the woman before them truly was the miracle doctor, Leyla's outburst could cost her dearly. Stories had spread through Eighvale of that doctor curing the most untouchable figures in society-and the Clarke family had pulled every string they had just to get the Onyx Syndicate to take their case.



Leyla's face shifted, frustration bubbling beneath the surface. "Mrs. Clarke, I'm only worried you'll fall for her act..."



Eliana had heard enough. Without a word, she drew a small card from her pocket and handed it to Ruby.


Ruby looked at it-and her composure fractured.


In her hand was an order acceptance card from Onyx Syndicate. For medical cases, the card was always white, embossed wvith their signature emblem: a blood-red rose in full bloom. "You are the doctor we are looking for!" Jeffry's eyes locked on the card, and his voice burst with excitement. "You're Miss Miracle Doctor! Please-come with us and treat my father!"


Eliana's expression didn't shift, as though their sudden change in tone had been inevitable.


Her voice was cool and detached. "Your butler told me to 'get lost.' I was just about to follow his advice."


Terry's face drained of color.


With both Jeffry and Ruby glaring daggers at him, he stumbled over his defense. "No, Mr. Clarke, Mrs.Clarke-it wasn't me! It was Leyla! She's the one who said Ms. Murray couldn't possibly be the miracle doctor,sol-"


"Wham-"


Jeffry's foot slammed into his shin, and Terry doubled over, clutching his leg with a hiss of pain.


"You just swallow whatever anyone tells you? I told you to wait for the miracle doctor at the gate-this is how you 'wait'?"


Ruby's words were even harsher. "Pack your things and get out. The Clarke family has no use for someone so brainless."



"No... Mr. Clarke, Mrs. Clarke, you have to believe me -it wasn't my fault. Leyla misled me-"


Leyla's hands balled into tight fists. "Mr. Clarke, Mrs.Clarke, I'm telling you the truth. She's lying to you.There's no way she's the miracle doctor. It's completely impossible!"


Ruby lifted the white card stamped with the crimson rose. "Do you even recognize this? It's the one and only card used to reach the miracle doctor. No one outside of her could possibly have it."


Leyla's eyes flickered toward the card despite herself.





She had no clue what the Onyx Syndicate was or what that card represented. All she knew was that Eliana carried a messy past. The idea that someone like Eliana could be a miracle doctor was something she refused to accept.


"You have to believe me-I'm telling the truth-"


"That's enough!" Jeffry's voice crackedI like a whip."Get her out of my sight! And tell the gate security she's never to set foot here again!"


"Yes, sir!" Two bodyguards stepped forward without hesitation, each gripping one of Leyla's arms and hauling her away as if she weighed nothing.


Terry was seized next and escorted out.


From that moment on, he was just another ordinary man-stripped of the title of the Clarke family's butler. Regret gnawed at him, and he clung to one desperate hope: that Leyla was right, and Eliana truly was a fraud.



Once the two were gone, Jeffry and Ruby turned back, their expressions instantly melting into warm,deferential smiles. "Ms. Murray-no, Dr. Murray,"Jeffry said smoothly, "you heard what happened. It was all a misunderstanding. We truly didn't know you'd arrived."


Ruby nodded eagerly. "That's right. Doctor, you'll always be welcome here. Come by anytime-no one will dare stop you again."


From down the hall, Leyla-still being hauled away-twisted in the guards' grip and shouted, her voice shrill with defiance. "You're making a huge mistake!She's fooling you two!"


Jeffry's brow furrowed in irritation. A sharp gesture from him sent the bodyguards dragging her faster until her voice and figure vanished.


Wasting no time, he turned back. "Doctor, please understand-our butler Terry is old, and his judgment isn't what it used to be. Don't hold it against him."


Eliana's lips curved in a pleasant smile, but her tone landed like a blade. "Unfortunately for him, I make a habit of holding grudges. Bye."


She tried to walk away. The Clarke couple scrambled to follow. "Wait-please don't take it to heart. This is entirely our fault. Name your consultation fee, whatever the amount-we'll pay it. Or if there's anything else you want, as long as it's within our power, we'll make it happen."
###Chapter 15 Have We Met Before





"Please-we're begging you!" The Clarke couple's voices carried the weight of desperation, stripped of their usual authority.


Anyone who stumbled upon the sight would have been left gaping. After all, the powerful Clarkes had never been heard speaking with such humility.


Eliana's expression didn't soften. Once she set her mind, nothing could move her from it. "I offered you the chance, and you threw it away. You've got no one to blame but yourselves."


She turned her back on them, letting their pleas fall into the cold air as she walked away.


Many sought her skills, but she had always practiced medicine by instinct, choosing her patients through the connection she felt with them.


The Clarke family had never stirred even a flicker of that connection.


At that moment, a sleek luxury car rolled up to the gates of the estate.


The tinted window slid down, revealing Hector, his eyes narrowing at the strange scene-his parents chasing after a woman dressed plainly enough to be mistaken for a beggar.


He signaled the driver to stop, stepped out, and closed the distance. "Dad, Mom, why are you running after a beggar?"


Jeffry's glare could have cut glass. "Beggar? That's the famed doctor we've been searching for!"


"What?" Hector froze, his gaze locking on Eliana.


He hadn't truly looked at her before-but now, he couldn't miss the quiet, striking presence she carried. Even under a dust-covered coat and worn clothing, her eyes gleamed like cut diamonds,impossible to overlook.


"I owe you an apology," Hector said quickly. "I didn't realize who you were."


Eliana's tone was cool. "It's fine. I have no intention of treating anyone in your family anyway."


In her mind, the Clarke household was full of people who measured worth by appearance alone. And she had no patience for those who were high and mighty.


Hector's brow furrowed. "Why not?"


"You ask me?" Her lips curved into a cold smnile."Ask your parents instead."


An awkward stiffness settled over Jeffry's and Ruby's faces.


Ruby stepped in quickly, spilling out the details of what had happened.


By the time Hector heard the whole story, the reason for their frantc chase was clear.


"Tell me your price. We can cover it," he said, his voice steeped in arrogance rather than the humility of someone seeking help. "I'm not short on money," Eliana answered, her tone cool as she turned to leave. She had no shortage of people seeking her out.


Hector wasn't accustomed to being dismissed so easily. Frustration hardened his voice. "Maybe money isn't what you need-but it's obvious you're lacking compassion."


Eliana's steps halted. She turned her head, eyes like shards of ice. "What did you just say?"


A faint curl tugged at his lips, his words deliberate."I said you're missing both compassion and medical ethics. A real doctor's duty is to save lives. But because our butler refused to let you inside our home, you'd let the patient suffer? Tell me-does someone like you even deserve to call herself a doctor?"



Eliana's eyes narrowed, her expression cool with disdain. It was obvious he was trying to corner her,pressing her into submission with moral guilt.


Unfortunately for him, she had no interest in playing by the rules of morality-so there was nothing for him to hold over her.


A slow, mocking smile curved her lips. "You're right.I'm not fit to be a doctor-and I'm even less fit to treat anyone in your family."


She stepped forward, clearly intent on leaving.


Hector's gaze turned razor-sharp, his voice snapping like a whip. "Stop her! She doesn't leave until my grandpa is treated!"


If persuasion wouldn't work, he'd use force. There was no way she would refuse to treat a patient with enough pressure. In an instant, several bodyguards closed in, forming a ring around her.


Eliana's gaze held nothing but icy calm-these men were nothing she couldn't handle.


She barely shifted her weight to strike when a deep,measured voice cut through the standoff. "Mr.Clarke,care to explain this?"


Every head snapped toward the sound, Eliana's included.


A man stepped out of the sleek car, his presence immediately filling the space. His height was commanding, his shadow spilling forward until it brushed across Eliana's shoes like a silent claim. A perfectly tailored suit framed his broad shoulders,buttoned high at the collar, and his steps carried the unhurried confidence of someone accustomed to control.


One glance told Eliana this was no ordinary passerby -her instincts rarely misjudged power.


Jeffry and Ruby's faces shifted instantly, their postures straightening under a mix of respect and unease. "Mr.Pearson..."


Her brow arched in mild surprise. Mr. Pearson? As in the Pearson family-the empire that held entire industries in its grip, able to tip the nation's economy with a single order?


But this man wasn't Jermaine Pearson, the heir she knew. Jermaine had once commissioned the Onyx Syndicate, and she had dealt with him before. The stranger before her was nothing like him.


A sly opportunist-that was how she pegged Jermaine, the kind who smiled while reaching for something that wasn't his. He'd once tried to lure her into working for him, and she hadn't forgotten.


There was no way she'd confuse Jermaine with the man in front of her. Which meant this Pearson was someone else entirely. His exact identity didn't matter. What mattered was whether he stood with her or with the Clarkes.



If he was their ally, she didn't care if he came from Eighvale's most powerful bloodline-she would treat him no differently than the rest.


While she studied him with measured calm, Tristan's gaze was locked on her, as though tracing the edges of a memory.


Something about her pulled at him-an almost hauntíng familiarity. Yet, for a man who never forgot a face, he couldn't place where or when their paths might have crossed.


The curiosity pricked at him until he finally asked,"Have we met before?"


It was a line that could have come straight from a bad romance drama.


"No, I don't think so," she replied, her tone flat as glass.


Her chill cut through the moment, snapping Tristan out of whatever haze he'd been in.



Realizing how it must have sounded, he reined in his expression and said evenly, "I'm sorry, I might have confused you with someone."


Jeffry stepped forward with a practiced smile."Mr.Pearson, if we'd known you were on your way,we would have sent a car to fetch you. Please, this way..."


In Qidence, the Clarke name carried weight. But in Esaton's business world, the Pearson family's influence could eclipse entire cities. The last thing the Clarke family wanted was for Tristan to witness them strong-arming a young woman into treating their family.


Unfortunately for them, he had already taken in the scene-their desperation, their lack of shame, and the woman standing there like an untouchable dove refusing to be caged.



Without so much as a glance at Jeffry's outstretched arm, Tristan bypassed him and came to a halt in front of Eliana. His gaze held hers, probing. "You're the famed doctor from Eighvale, aren't you?"


He'd been told the doctor was young. What he hadn't expected was for her youth to come with such an unshakable presence.


" am," she replied simply, without hesitation.


A faint smile touched his lips. "I've been meaning to meet you for some time but never had the chance.Now that I have, I'd like to ask-would you consider treating my father?" Eliana tilted her head slightly. "Your father?"


"Yes," Tristan replied, his voice low but steady. "He's been unwell. The danger's passed for now, but his health shifts like the wind-one day stable, the next on the brink."



His eyes flicked toward Hector and Jeffry,his words sharpened with intent. "If they can't muster the respect to request your help properly, then I will. Say the word, and I'll have a private jet ready to fly you to Eighvale, where you'll be received with the highest honor."



The offer tightened Jeffry's chest.


The nerve of Hector-trying to strong-arm Eliana as if she were some street vendor to be bullied. Did he forget she carried the name of the Onyx Syndicate,a name that could crush reputations with a whisper?Disappointment tangled with anger in Jeffry's chest.


Hector,still caught off guard, hadn't imagined Tristan would step in and shield her so openly. Shoving his irritation aside, Jeffry forced his expression into something warmer, almost pleading."Dr. Murray, I owe you an apology. This has all been one terrible misunderstanding. Of course, we'd be honored for you to treat my father. If you'd grant us that favor, I'll pay triple your original fee. And I swear,from this day forward, my family will hold you in the highest respect."



Eliana let out a sharp laugh. "A moment ago, you were set on dragging me back by force. And now?What exactly do you call this sudden change of heart?"



Jeffry scrambled to cover the misstep. "My son was reckless-blindly so. That's on me for not raising him better. I'll see to it that he learns from this. Please don't let his stupidity sour things between us."


Ruby skipped the diplomacy. She stepped forward and delivered a stinging slap across Hector's cheek."Apologize. Now."


The blow did its job. Pride swallowed and jaw tight Hector finally inclined his head. "I was wrong. Entirely wrong. I hope you can forgive me."


Eliana weighed her options. Triple the original fee was a hard figure to ignore. More importantly,treating a Clarke could elevate her reputation in the city quickly.


After a brief pause, she gave her verdict. "Where's the patient? Take me to him."


Relief swept through the Clarkes like a gust of wind.Jeffry moved quickly, saying, "It's my father. He's at home.Please-this way."


Expression unreadable, Eliana fell into step behind him.





From the side, Tristan's gaze lingered on her retreating figure. That nagging sense of familiarity refused to fade.


When Eliana turned unexpectedly and offered Tristan a small nod, something in his chest shifted-lightened,even.


He returned the gesture and closed the distance, choosing to follow.
###Chapter 16 Back To Doubting Eliana





Minutes slipped by before Eliana finally stepped into Miguel's room.


The old man lay half-awake beneath an oxygen mask, thin as parchment, the soft beeping of machines marking every fragile moment.



Ignoring the equipment entirely, Eliana trusted her own way of doing things.


Her fingers wrapped gently around Miguel's frail wrist as she concentrated on hearing his pulse.



The onlookers seemed frozen, hardly daring to take a breath. Only Tristan kept his eyes fixed on Eliana's face,wrestling with the thought that he had seen her somewhere before.



Time dragged on before Eliana let go of Miguel's arm. Jeffry seized the moment to ask, "Doctor, can you help my father?"


Eliana's gaze met his, but the eager intensity in his eyes unsettled her.


It felt as though his worry had more to do with his own situation than with the man on the bed.


Still, that was something outside Eliana's concern.She answered with steady composure, "Your father isn't sick. He's simply old."


Had it been an illness, she could have treated it.Yet the turning of life's wheel was beyond the reach of medicine.



Miguel's troubles were the slow wear of years.


Bodies worked like well-used machines, prone to jamming or breaking after too long. But unlike metal parts, a human being couldn't be swapped out for something new.


A transplant here or there might extend life, yet a full renewal was impossible and MigueI's state could not endure such invasive attempts.


Jeffry's face fell at once, disappointment cutting through him. If even the doctor secured through the Onyx Syndicate could do nothing, then Miguel's fate was already sealed.


Out of nowhere, Leyla's voice cut through the air."Mr. and Mrs. Clarke, I warned you she's a fraud!That famous doctor you were looking for? This isn't her! Think about it-how could someone so celebrated fail to cure an illness?"


Leyla had been sent away earlier in disgrace.


The moment Hector's car rolled into view, she wasted no time in calling him. So, it was Hector who escorted her straight inside.


Without a hint of expression on her face, Eliana answered, "I already told you. He isn't sick. He's just old."



"Old? That's your diagnosis? You can't even figure out what's wrong and you expect us to swallow that? Do you think we're fools?"


Jeffry's jaw tightened, his thoughts shifting fast.More than anyone else, he refused to watch Miguel die.



Eliana earlier statement had dragged him into despair, yet Leyla's accusation rekindled a dangerous ember of hope. If the renowned doctor was still out there, then perhaps his father's fate wasn't sealed.



"So tell me. Are you the doctor we've been searching for, or aren't you?" Jeffry asked coldly, staring at Eliana.



Eliana's brow tightened, irritation shadowing her voice. "What's this now? Back to doubting me?"


Jeffry opened his mouth to answer but froze when he caught sight of Tristan.


Quickly snatching the white card from Ruby, he handed it over. "Mr. Pearson, you know your stuff.Can you check if this card's the reaI thing? If it is, I'll  admit I was wrong. But if it isn't..."


He left the last words unsaid, yet the threat in his tone landed hard.



Eliana remained unfazed. She knew the truth could not be faked.



Tristan reached for the card with slow, deliberate ease. One quick look was enough for him to decide."It's the real thing," he said.


The Onyx Syndicate had their cards crafted to perfection. Even Tristan's skills would fail to imitate one.



The red rose emblem on it was very intricate, more complex than the currency, and no one in the market could reproduce such a card.


Jeffry's mood sank at the confirmation. Shame kept his eyes off Eliana, and he turned his anger on Leyla.Without her, he would not have doubted Eliana's identity. "| warned you to stay away from our property. Who gave you permission to step inside?" Color drained from her face, and she instinctively turned to Hector for help.


Unease gnawed at Hector. Why must she speak up at such a time? Even so, he would stand up for her. "I was the one who brought her in, Dad."


"Take her out! Do not drag strays into our home! This house is not a place anyone can walk into!"


The insult twisted Leyla's features. Strays? Did Jeffry mean her? Damn it! This mess was all on Eliana.Where had she even gotten that card?


"We're done here, Leyla. Let's leave," said Hector,already reading the irritation on Jeffry's face and deciding it was best to get her out for now.


Still, Leyla refused to budge.


Her eyes locked on Eliana, and she said, "If you're truly this renowned doctor they claim you are, then why can't you cure Mr. Clarke? And even if he's old,there has to be a way to keep him alive for a few more years." Eliana raised her eyebrows. "And who told you |couldn't?"



That simple question drew every gaze toward Eliana.


Jeffry, more desperate than anyone else, nearly tripped over his words. "Doctor, please, I let myself be misled by her earlier-"



Eliana had no patience for his rambling. The decision to treat the patient was already made, and she intended to collect a fee worth her trouble.



Cutting him off with a raised hand, she said, "You don't have to explain. I'll handle it. But there's one thing I want first."


"And what is that? Whatever it is, we'll make it happen!"



Her finger landed on Leyla without hesitation. "Get her out of my sight. She's nothing but noise."


Leyla blinked in shock, a flicker of loathing sparking in her gaze. Jeffry said quickly, "That won't be a problem! Hector,get Leyla out of here now!"


Clutching Hector's sleeve, Leyla blurted out, "Don't believe a word she says, Hector! She's nothing but a fraud-"



"That's enough, Leyla. We're leaving," said Hector,his tone edged with annoyance.



He didn't give her a chance to argue again as he dragged her out.



Leyla found herself facing another round of disgrace.


This time, the Clarkes, who had barely tolerated her before, seemed disgusted beyond measure.


Leyla cursed Eliana inwardly. She believed it was all Eliana's fault and there was no way she'd ever let her get away with it.


Inside, Eliana told a servant to strip off Miguel's shirt before asking, "Have you gathered everything I told you to prepare?" "Everything is here. Except for one herb. My daughter went to get it, and she should be back soon."


"Good. I'll start working now." Eliana took the sterilized tool the maids had laid out and began the procedure.


At the same time, Hector escorted Leyla to the doorway.


"Hector, you doubt me as well?" she asked.


With a weary sigh, he said, "You acted too recklessly today. This isn't about me believing you or not.My dad... he can't risk losing my grandpa. Even if he suspects she's a fraud, he still has to take the chance."



Her eyes sparked with sudden hope. "So your parents don't truly think that bitch can heal your grandpa?"


Hector gave a short nod.


Leyla regained her strength. "Fine. I'll wait by the gates. She won't even notice me. Just let me stay,I'm begging you."


Her only wish was to witness the moment Eliana's failure became undeniable, to watch the punishment that came when Miguel's illness went uncured.
###Chapter 17 A False Alarm





Tristan stood in the corner, his gaze steady as he observed Eliana move briskly about the room.


Interfering in other people's business had never been his style, yet curiosity had brought him here-to see whether the woman whispered about across all of the nation truly possessed the skill her reputation claimed.



A genuine healer would earn his public praise and a formal invitation to tend to his father.



And if she managed to restore his father's health, he would see to it that her every request was granted without question.


But if her talent fell short, he would mark the day off as nothing more than a small squander of his time.


In truth, Eliana's earlier claim wasn't false-Miguel really was very old. Jeffry had been born when Miguel was already in the latter stretch of life.


Now Jeffry was in his mid-forties, while Miguel had reached seventy-nine.


In Tristan's mind, if she could prolong Miguel's life even a little, she would be living up to her reputation.


His attention locked on the movement of her hands.Her fingers were slim, almost delicate at first glance.


Yet he spotted the roughness at their tips-calluses in places most women's hands stayed soft, even in the space between thumbs and index fingers.


Without thinking, Tristan compared them to his own hands.



The same patch of skin between his thumbs and index fingers bore hardened ridges from countless hours of firearms training. How had she gotten hers?Could handling silver needles realy leave such marks? The question gnawed at him.


Tristan's gaze went unnoticed as Eliana kept her full attention on the careful placement of acupuncture needles in Miguel.


She couldn't turn back the years for Miguel, but she could slow their toll and grant him more days in the sun.



It was like coaxing an old machine into one more stretch of good service-never new again, but running well enough for someone desperate for more time.



Minutes slipped away before Eliana set aside the last of her silver needles.


Miguel now lay bristling with them, not unlike a weary porcupine.


"Have the herbs been prepared?" she asked,turning toward Jeffry.


"They're all ready, except for the Goosegrass," he answered quickly. "My daughter still hasn't brought it over.I can call her right now-"


"Leave it," Eliana said. "I've got a stalk myself.We'll use it for your father now, and you can return it to me later."



That piece of Goosegrass was rare, butit wasn't one of a kind. She had originally bought it for Stella. Since Stella had no urgent need, it could be spared for Miguel.


Jeffry's voice softened with relief. "You've done us a great kindness."



Eliana pulled the stalk from her bag and passed it to the servants, instructing them to brew it.


Most herbs needed a long simmer, but these were different-a hard boil for fifteen minutes was enough.


When the time passed and the brew was ready,Eliana began removing the needles.


One by one, they slipped free, and to everyone's astonishment, Miguel's fingers twitched.


Gasps rippled through the room, and Jeffry's face lit with sudden hope. It looked as though his eyelids might lift, when suddenly Jeffry coughed and spat out a heavy mouthful of black blood.



Almost at the same moment, the heart monitor sounded and the jagged lines dissolved into one unbroken line.



Hector burst into the room just in time to see the scene, his face hardening into rage. He grabbed Eliana by the collar."You liar! You've murdered my grandpa!"


He'd never trusted her so-calledskills, but he hadn't imagined she would be the one to end his grandpa's life outright.


Every doctor before her had said Miguel still had a week at least, and now he was gone ahead of schedule.



"You shameless pretender, acting like a skilled doctor when you're nothing of the sort. I should fucking end you right here!" Hector cursed. Eliana's brows drew together, her face set in a deep seriousness.



He read that change as the dawning horror of someone who had just realized she had taken a life.


With a violent jerk, he pulled her closer, ready to smash her against the wall.


Before he could, a shadow stepped between them."Laying hands on a woman hardly suits a gentleman."


Hector's eyes flicked up, meeting Tristan's steady gaze. His grip slackened without thought.


Eliana took the chance to pull back, putting distance between them.


The noise drew Leyla to the doorway, her eyes darting over the tense scene.


비 warned you, sir," she said quickly. "Eliana is nothing but a fraud. Mr. Clarke's gone now-are you really going to protect her from the justice she deserves?" Tristan's tone stayed even as he replied, "Perhaps you should see the truth before you speak."


Both of them froze, their eyes snapping toward the bed without a word.



To their surprise, Jeffry was calmly reattaching the heart monitor, and within seconds, the screen lit up with perfectly normal readings.


Only then did the truth hit them-Miguel hadn't died at all. The flat line had been nothing more than the result of his slight finger twitch knocking the sensor loose.



A hot flush of embarrassment spread over Hector and Leyla's faces.


Eliana, too, grasped what had happened. She had been bracing herself for the worst, believing her acupuncture had failed, only to realize it had been nothing more than a false alarm.


Wiping the sweat from his forehead, Jeffry turned a glare sharp enough to cut through stone toward Hector and Leyla.



His voice rang with authority as he barked at Hector,"I told you to remove that woman from this house.Why is she still standing here? Have you gone deaf,or do you now think you can ignore me?"


"Dad, I..." Hector began, fumbling for an excuse.


"Not another word! If you won't take her away, then you can leave with her. Guards, get them both out and bar the door to them!" Jeffry snapped coldly.


In his eyes, Leyla was nothing but a source of chaos,wrecking peace at every turn. Still, Hector clung to her as if she were irreplaceable.



The disappointment in Jeffry's face was plain to see.


"No, Dad... I'll send her out right now!" Seeing the true edge of his father's temper, Hector didn't dare delay. He grabbed Leyla's arm and pulled her from the room.



Silence settled over the room at last. Then, without warning, Miguel's eyelids lifted,evealing eyes no longer dulled by age but sharp and clear. His voice carried a surprising strength as he called out, "Jeffry, Ruby."


The couple rushed to Miguel's bedside, each clasping one of his hands as though afraid to let go.


"Dad, tell me-how are you feeling? Any pain?Anything at all?" Jeffry asked, his voice thick with worry.


Miguel gave a slow shake of his head, his gaze wandering across the faces gathered in the room."Who are all these people? And why do I feel...lighter, as if years have been lifted from me?"


Without delay, Jeffry began introducing Eliana.


When Miguel learned she was the famed doctor, his eyes warmed with gratitude. "Thank you, doctor.You've given me a gift I can't repay..."


Eliana offered a faint smile and shook her head."There's no need to thank me. I only did what I'm meant to do. Since you're well now, I'll be on my way."


"Hold on-please. I've yet to thank you properly,"Miguel said, raising a hand as though to keep her from leaving.


Jeffry added, "Truly, we're grateful. We'll remember this for as long as we live. Stay for a meal and let us show our thanks."


Before she could respond, hurried footsteps echoed from the doorway.


Khloe appeared, Neal at her side, both looking a little winded.


They'd searched nearly all of the city before finally getting their hands on the Goosegrass.


Khloe had only dared return once the precious stalk was safe in her grip.


Holding the stalk as if it were a treasure, she stepped into the room and called out, "Dad, Mom, I found the Goosegrass you wanted. If it weren't for Neal, I'd still e searching-"


ler sentence faltered the instant her eyes landed on liana.
###Chapter 18 Returning The Favor





Khloe froze for a moment.



One glance at Eliana's face, and she knew. This was the same woman who had clashed with her over the Goosegrass at the herbal pharmacy.



If this woman hadn't interfered, she wouldn't have spent hours scouring every corner of the city.


The memory hit her like a spark to dry tinder, and fury flared up inside her. She stormed toward Eliana.


Eliana hadn't noticed her yet, though she sensed movement behind her.



When Eliana turned, Khloe's hand was already slicing through the air, ready to strike. But before it could connect, a strong hand caught her wrist mid-swing.


Eliana's gaze shifted to the man who stopped the blow-Tristan. Her attention shifted back to Khloe, and the truth clicked instantly. This wasn't some random encounter-Khloe was here to settle the score over a stalk of Goosegrass.


The absurdity of it nearly made Eliana smile. Out of all the places in the world, fate had tossed them together again. And there Khloe was, the same woman who once tried to rip the Goosegrass from her hands, now showing up here with that same smug determination.



"Do you have any idea who you're dealing with? Let go of me!" Khloe fought against the hold, her voice sharp with fury.


Tristan's hold might as well have been forged from steel, and the pressure made her wrist throb. No matter how she twisted, there was no breaking free.


"Are you deaf? Let go of me!" Khloe's voice rose, her frustration spilling into raw fury.


Ruby flinched at the outburst and rushed over."Khloe! Show some respect. That's Mr. Pearson!" The name stopped her cold. Mr. Pearson? Could this be Tristan Pearson?



For the first time, she really looked at him. The man's expression was unreadable, but his features were almost unreal in their sharpness, carrying an authority that seemed to fiIl the space.


Even with someone else holding her heart, she felt her pulse falter for a moment.



She hadn't expected a face like his-handsome enough to outshine even Jermaine.



While she lingered in that stunned haze, Jeffry stepped up, his voice like ice. "Mr. Pearson is an honored guest. Is this how you greet someone of his standing? Apologize. Now."


Without a word, Tristan let go of her wrist. His expression stayed like stone as he drew a crisp handkerchief from his pocket and brushed it over his palm, as though her touch had left a stain.


A flicker of heat rushed to Khloe's cheeks, her pride taking the hit.


Still, with his standing, defiance wasn't an option.She swallowed hard, obeying Jeffry's demand. "I'm sorry, Mr.Pearson."


Tristan acted as if she hadn't spoken, his attention locked on Eliana.



Eliana caught the meaning in his eyes instantly-he was checking if she'd been harmed.


A slight shake of her head gave him the answer.Honestly, even without his intervention, her reflexes would have kept Khloe's hand from ever making contact.



Khloe noticed the silent exchange and remembered why she'd walked over in the first place-to strike Eliana.



Standing in front of a man like Tristan, though, made her rein it in, her composure taking precedence over the outburst she'd planned.


StilI, choosing not to lash out didn't mean she intended to keep quiet.


Khloe thrust her finger toward Eliana, her voice sharp and accusing. "Dad, Mom, that's the one! She grabbed the Goosegrass I was trying to buy at the herbal pharmacy. If she hadn't meddled, I'd have been back ages ago! What now-does she plan to jack up the price just because she knows we need it?Kick her out!"


A faint, ironic smile tugged at Eliana's lips. "Mr.Clarke, it seems your family takes great pride in showing me the door. Perhaps I should make it easy for you and leave right now."


"Stop! Don't take her nonsense to heart. Khloe's being rash-I'll deal with her immediately," Jeffry explained.



His glare fixed on Khloe, and his tone turned to ice."Do you even understand who you're talking to?She's the doctor who came here for your grandpa's treatment. Apologize to her. Now."


Ruby's frustration had reached its limit. Watching Hector and Khloe handle the situation without an ounce of tact made her want to tear her hair out.


Insulting Eliana was reckless. Her skill bordered on the miraculous, and winning her favor was worth more than gold.


No one was immune to illness, and when the time came, they might be desperate for the very hands they were now trying to drive away.


The richer people became, the more they clung to life. Many would risk crossing powerful officials before daring to offend a doctor of Eliana's caliber.


"Why are you just standing there? Apologize to her!"Jeffry's tone sharpened when he caught Khloe gawking at Eliana in disbelief.


Khloe's head jerked in refusal. "No way. Dad, Mom,how could this... this beggar be the famed doctor you hired? Someone's pulling the wool over your eyes!"


Jeffry drew in a breath to answer, but Miguel's voice cut in, steady and commanding. "Pulled the wool over our eyes? Then tell me-who healed me?"


"Grandpa?" The word slipped out before Khloe could stop it, her eyes darting over his healthy complexion in shock.



When she'd left, he had been unconscious. For an entire month, he'd slept more than he'd been awake,and even in his waking hours, he'd been too frail to speak more than a few words-nothing like the strong, alert man before her now.


"Grandpa... are you telling me she's the one who healed you?" Khloe's voice trembled with disbelief.


"Naturally! Half the household saw it happen-why would anyone doubt it?" Miguel answered without hesitation.



It felt like a lightning strike had hit her, draining the color from her face.


"Didn't I tell you to apologize? Are you pretending you didn't hear me?!" Jeffry snapped, his frustration mounting at the thought of her offending Eliana further.


Her gaze locked on Eliana, a sudden realization surfacing."The Goosegrass you bought at the herbal pharmacy... that was for my grandpa, wasn't it?"


Eliana's lips curved faintly. "You could say that."


Truthfully, she'd purchased it for Stella, but fate had steered it toward Miguel instead.


Khloe's expression sank even further, her skin nearly as white. "I.." The word hung in the air, her voice faltering, unable to let go of the bitterness twisting inside her.



No one had ever dared to take something from her before. Even so, the hard lines on her parents' faces,paired with the uncharacteristic sharpness in their voices, left her unsettled.


At last, she forced out, "I'm sor-"


"Save it." Eliana's hand lifted, stopping her cold. "If you don't mean it, I don't want to hear it." Khloe's lips tightened, a small wave of relief washing over her. Apologizing to Eliana was the last thing she wanted anyway.


In her mind, her grandpa's recovery had nothing to do with Eliana's skill. It had to be the Goosegrass-or maybe pure luck.


For half a million a stalk, she thought bitterly, even the dead should be able to crawl back to life after taking it.


Then Eliana's voice cut through her thoughts."Words are cheap. I prefer something more...tangible."


Khloe blinked, not following her meaning.


Jeffry's brows drew together. "And what exactly do you have in mind?"


A faint smile tugged at Eliana's lips. "She tried to slap me earlier. If you return the favor on my behalf, we can call it even."


Khloe's eyes flared, her voice dripping with mockery. You expect my parents to hit me? You've lost your mind."





But Jeffry didn't hesitate. His hand came down in a sharp arc, landing with a crack that rang through the room.
###Chapter 19 Slapping Khloe





Pain bloomed across Khloe's cheek, and her hand flew up to shield it.


Her wide eyes swung toward Miguel, disbelief pouring into her voice. "Dad... you'd actually hit me over some street beggar?"



Before the words even faded, another slap cracked against her skin-harder, sharper, leaving the sting burning deeper.



A flush rose on both cheeks, the swelling already visible.



"Beggar? She's an honored doctor! Mind your tongue!" Jeffry's tone cut like ice.


Tears pricked Khloe's eyes, and she spun on her heel,fury pushing her toward the door.


Ruby's voice chased after her. "Khloe! Where do you think you're going?"


"Leave her. She'll come back," Jeffry said, catching Ruby's arm before she could follow, instead giving her a pointed glance toward Eliana.


Reluctantly, Ruby turned back. The only choice left was to mend the damage.


Forcing her composure, she stepped toward Eliana,lowering her head. "I truly apologize. I failed as a mother, and my daughter's behavior has caused you offense..."



Eliana lifted her hand, cutting off the rest of Ruby's words. "I keep my word. You've given her the slap-consider it done."



Relief softened both Jeffry and Ruby's expressions,knowing she wouldn't press the matter any further.


"Then at least join us for a meal. Wle'd like to thank you properly," Jeffry said, his tone almost eager.


A quick glance at her phone had Eliana shaking her head."Thanks, but I can't. There's something urgent I need to deal with. But I'll leave you a new prescription. Once the current meds run out, follow it every day. That should keep the patient stable for now."



Miguel latched onto those last two words, his brow tightening. "How long... exactly, do I have?"


"A year," Eliana answered plainly.


The room shifted, most faces brightening at the news-none more so than Jeffry's.


For him, a year was more than enough time for Miguel to secure his path forward. After that,whether the old man lived or not was of little concern.



Miguel alone felt the weight of the news. To him, a single year was far too short. Still, it wasn't hard to understand. Those who brushed against death often clung tighter to life, not less.


"Would it be possible to come to you again after that year is up?" Miguel asked, unable to hide the hope in his voice.


Eliana was never one to offer promises she couldn't keep. "If my schedule allows, I can visit and check on you," she said evenly. "But I can't promise the same outcome.Some treatments lose their strength after the first round."



Even that much left Miguel quietly relieved. He looked at her with new hope in his eyes. "No matter what, I owe you my life. If you ever need something from the Clarke family, name it-we'll move mountains if we have to."



Eliana let the offer stand. Deep down, she knew there might come a day when she'd call it in.


"Bring me some paper and a pen," Eliana said.


Jeffry didn't hesitate, hurrying off to fetch them.


Once she began writing, graceful strokes flowed across the page, each line carrying a practiced elegance.


Out of the corner of his eye, Tristan caught a glimpse. For a heartbeat, he paused-was he imagining things, or had he seen that handwriting before?



Before he could get a better look, Jeffry folded the prescription and tucked it away.


"Thank you, truly. Since you've got urgent business today, I won't hold you up. Allow me to walk you out,"Jeffry said, his gratitude plain.


"There's no need. I prefer to leave quietly," Eliana replied, her tone light but final.


"But-" Jeffry insisted.


"Let her go if that's what she wants," Miguel interjected, knowing she had no patience for over-attentive hosts.



People like her were never easy to accommodate.


If extending his life meant giving in to her wishes,Miguel was willing to do so without hesitation.


With that consent hanging in the air, Jeffry had little choice but to follow through. "Please, take care," he said.



Eliana gave a short nod, accepted the neatly wrapped Goosegrass Ruby had bought, and headed for the door.



Her work here was finished.



The matter of payment was Seth's responsibility, not hers. All she had to do was get the job done.


Once she stepped out, the only guest left in the room was Tristan.



Jeffry's smile shifted into something overly polite."Mr. Pearson, why don't we talk over some drinks?With all the worry over my father's condition, I'm afraid we may not have treated you as well as we should have."



"No need to apologize. Seeing Mr. Clarke in good health is reason enough for me to be pleased,"Tristan replied.


Even as he spoke, a flicker of amusement crossed his mind. Since taking the helm of the Pearson Group, he had never once been upstaged-until today, by a young woman who had effortlessly stolen the spotlight.


If circumstances allowed, he would have gladly caught up with Eliana for a proper conversation.


Still, his visit today had a clear purpose-checking on Miguel's condition and handling business matters with Jeffry-so walking out just to follow Eliana wasn't an option. Something told him, though,that their paths would cross again soon.


Outside the estate, Neal and Leyla's eyes met in a shared,uneasy silence.


Leyla had been escorted out by Hector earlier. He'd asked her to leave first, and she'd agreed, but instead of going far, she lingered near the entrance,secretly hoping Eliana would fail in treating Miguel so she could salvage her own reputation.


Neal, on the other hand, had been planted there under Khloe's orders, unwilling to step inside without her approval.


The awkwardness between them was evident-both were outsiders in the Clarke family's eyes.


A sleek red sports car suddenly rolled past the gates.


The tinted window slid down, revealing Khloe behind the wheel.


"Khloe? What are you doing here?I thought you said once you delivered the Goosegrass, you'd use the chance to get your parents to meet me," Neal said,surprise lacing his voice.


Khloe's face clouded instantly. There had been a time when she adored him without question. Now,looking at him, that same rush of feeling was gone.


Maybe it was the lingering fury from her run-in with Eliana and Jeffry. Or maybe it was the memory of Tristan-his striking face and commanding presence refusing to leave her mind.


Few people knew much about Tristan yet. For years,h e'd been an illegitimate son, but once he fully stepped into power, his name would spread.


And when that happened, plenty of women would be chasing him.


Still, Khloe prided herself on her loyalty. Pushing down those stray thoughts, she said flatly, "Get in.Today isn't the right time to introduce you to my parents."


Neal started to question her, but his eyes caught on the angry red marks across her cheeks-two of them.


His expression hardened. "Khloe... who hit you?"


"Because of that bitch!" she spat, her voice thick with resentment.



"Bitch?" Neal frowned, confused.


"Yes! The one from the herbal pharmacy," Khloe scoffed.





"She's here? I'll take care of her right now!" Neal growled, rolling up his sleeves as if ready to storm in.


Khloe caught his arm before he could take another step. "Hop in. I'll fill you in later."


With no other choice, Neal pulled open the door and slid into the passenger seat.


From the curb,Leyla watched them drive off, a flicker of envy tightening in her chest.


She'd been standing there for nearly thirty minutes,and Hector still hadn't contacted her.


A knot of unease twisted in her stomach.



Back in the Murray household, she'd been surrounded by doting parents and six brothers. But now, with her ties to them severed, Hector was all she had left.



Every decision he made rippled through her life,shaping her future. That was why she couldn't afford to lose her place in his heart. Without him, there would be nowhere for her to go.



The thought only deepened her bitterness toward Eliana. If not for that woman, she wouldn't have been humiliated and cast out of the Clarkes' estate today.


A sudden movement drew her attention-a sleek black Porsche rolled to a stop in front of her.


One glance at the license plate made her eyes narrow. She knew that car. It belonged to Sean.
 ###Chapter 20 Twisting The Truth





Among all the Murray brothers, Sean had been the one to indulge Leyla the most.


Leyla had always shared the closest bond with him.


Now, however, a faint chill of fear slid through her at the thought of facing him.


Sean's temper was infamous-quick to ignite and unforgiving when it came to betrayal. On top of that,years of boxing had honed his strength and precision.


If he learned she had willingly cut ties with his family,she was certain his anger would boil over, and he might even strike her.


A thought suddenly hit her. Was that why he'd shown up now-to confront her physically?


She instinctively wanted to bolt. Yet her body betrayed her. Her legs felt like lead, and her stumbling attempt to move was barely faster than a slow walk.



In a burst of restless irritation, she slapped her own thighs.


The sound had barely faded when a car door clicked open.


Leyla's body went rigid, and she forced herself to turn,each movement slow and stiff.


Sean stood there, his face set in an icy, unreadable mask.



His features carried the sharp, attractive lines of Louis and Stella, yet the weight of his thick brows gave him a harsh, almost intimidating edge whenever he wasn't smiling.


Carl had never rattled her-he was the sort to argue endlessly but never raise a hand to her-so she'd spoken to himn without hesitation.


Sean,however, was a completely different story. She knew better than to cross him. Once, she'd watched him in an underground boxing ring, delivering blows so brutal his opponent barely left alive.


A dry lump formed in her throat as she forced a tight smile. "Hi..."



"There you are, Leyla! I've been looking everywhere for you!" His voice carried both relief and urgency.


At first, he'd assumed she was at Hector's place.When she wasn't, he'd gone straight to the Clarkes'estate.



And now, luck had put her right in front of him.


Taking her hand with surprising gentleness, he said,"Come home with me. I don't care how Carl or Eliana treated you-you'll always be my little sister."


Leyla's breath caught, surprise flashing in her eyes.


So... he didn't know she'd walked away from the Murray family by choice? From his tone, he clearly believed Carl and Eliana had thrown her out. Drawing in a slow, careful breath, Leyla asked softly,"You still see me as your sister?"


"Absolutely," he said without a hint of hesitation.


The timid way she looked at him only deepened his conviction that she'd been wronged. A pang of sympathy tightened in his chest. She had been the little sister he'd watched grow from childhood,and the thought of Carl casting her out seemed impossible to him.



A protective edge crept into Sean's voice as he said,"Leyla, you don't have to worry. Iwon't let Carl force you out."


Leyla's suspicions were confirmed. Sean, all muscle and little foresight, had completely misunderstood the situation.



The realization brought a flicker of relief, and she lowered her gaze. "I'm sorry, but I can't go back with you."


His brows pulled together. "Why not?" The question stirred a memory-overheard exchanges between Jordy and Carl-and his expression shifted. "Leyla...is it true what Carl said? That you were the one who wanted to cut ties?"



A sharp pinch to her side sent a sting through her ribs, and tears welled in her eyes on cue.


Putting on her most wounded tone, she murmured,"How could I ever want to leave you? But now that Eliana's back, I... I'm just an outsider. I don't belong there anymore."



"What outsider?" Sean retorted instantly. "You're not an outsider-you're family. Did Carl tell you otherwise?"



Leyla gave a small shake of her head.


"Was it because of Eliana?" Sean's brow furrowed as he pressed her for an answer.


Leyla said nothing. Sean's temper spiked instantly. In his mind, Eliana must have been spoiled beyond reason while living in the countryside. How else could she be this petty?


Still, the priority now was getting Ley/la to come home. He couldn't shake the worry that she wouldn't be able to manage on her own.


Resting a reassuring hand on her shoulder, he said,"You silly girl. Sure, Eliana's back, but what does she have besides a blood connection? Do you think the years we've shared mean nothing? Just come back with me-you have no reason to leave."


But Leyla had no intention of agreeing.


The Clarke family had never warmed to her, and carrying the Murray name only made it worse. After what happened today, their dislike was certain to deepen. That was exactly why, at this moment,returning to the Murray family was the last thing she could do. If she went back now, she was convinced even Hector would eventually turn against her.


Pushing the thought aside, Leyla shook her head."Don't worry about me. I can manage on my own.You should go back and be with Eliana-after all these years apart, she needs you far more than I do."


"Let the others take care of her. I'm not interested,"Sean replied, shaking his head with finality.


She was ready to press him again when something over his shoulder caught her eye-Eliana, walking out of the estate alone.



Wait-why was she walking out alone? Could it mean she'd failed to treat Miguel? A rush of uncertainty swirled through Leyla's thoughts.



By all logic, if Eliana had succeeded, the Clarkes would be singing her praises and never letting her leave without an escort.



The notion sparked something in Leyla's eyes, a glint of calculation taking hold. Her fingers closed around Sean's sleeve. "It doesn't matter if I go back right now. Once Eliana accepts you all, I can return whenever I want. Remember, she's still your sister. If anything happens to her, you can't just stand there and do nothing." Sean never truly dismissed Eliana's safety.


In his mind, even if she had gone astray, she was still bound to him by family ties.


Disliking someone and outright abandoning them were two entirely different things.


That was why Leyla's words stirred an uneasy feeling in his chest.



"What happened to Eliana?" he asked sharply.


The flicker of worry in his eyes made Leyla's stomach twist-an old, petty feeling, like the jealousy of a child who didn't want another kid playing with a toy she'd tossed aside.



She smothered the sensation quickly and spoke with calculated calm. "Eliana... for reasons | don't understand, she pretended to be the famous doctor the Clarke family brought in. I saw her inside just now -Miguel was coughing up blood because of her."


"What?!" Sean's concern vanished in an instant,replaced by sharp contempt. "Idiot! How could she pull something like that? The Clarke family might be ruthless-they did kick Dad when he was down-but that doesn't mean she should provoke them. Our family can't afford to take the brunt of their anger!"


Leyla let out a deliberate sigh. "That's right, Sean.You need to straighten her out before she does something truly reckless. And make sure the Clarkes know she isn't the famed doctor they think she is. If you don't, she'll stir up even more trouble-maybe even cost someone their life."



Sean's anger flared, his eyes blazing and the veins at his temples standing out. "How did I end up with such a foolish sister?"



Seeing Eliana approaching in the distance, Leyla hurried to finish. "This isn't the time to argue. I have somewhere to stay, so don't worry about me. I need to go. Take care of yourself."


She spun on her heel and walked away without waiting for a reply.


Sean was ready to go after her, determined to bring her back to the Murray family. But the moment he turned, his gaze caught on Eliana stepping out of the gates.
###Chapter 21 Blaming Eliana





Sean took a moment to think it over. Leyla already had a place lined up, so she wasn't exactly on his list of immediate concerns.



Without wasting more time, he changed direction and made his way toward Eliana.


Right then, she was in the middle of a call with Seth.


"Boss, you won't believe this. The Clarke family just sent the payment-way more than I expected. Didn't you say you were done working with them?"


Eliana was not in the mood for a long explanation."I was already over there. Figured I might as well turn the trip into profit."


Seth had learned a long time ago that trying to decode her motives was a waste of energy. "Well,whatever the reason, they went all out this time.Want to guess the amount?" "Go on. Shock me."



"Ten million. That's the highest consultation fee l've ever seen cross our account."



Eliana's face didn't shift in the slightest. The Clarkes were loaded, and she knew it. Most clients paid less not because they lacked money, but because,once their illness was gone, so was their need for her.Miguel,though-he was buying himself extra years.That ten million covered today's treatment and reserved her services for the same time next year.



"Wire it to me. I've got a string of big expenses coming up."



"Got it."



"Also, put the Pearson family on your radar. I want details."



"The Pearsons? We're talking about the Pearson family in Eighvale, right?"


"Exactly. Find out what they've got going on." People had been whispering that the Pearson family was planning to move part of their Eighvale fortune into Qidence. With the Onyx Syndicate staking its own claim there, they couldn't afford to ignore one of the most established powerhouses in the region.



The last time they operated in Eighvale, they'd bled money thanks to another influential family circling like vultures.



Eliana wasn't eager to make the Pearson family an enemy if there was any way to avoid it.


"I'll dig into it and send everything I find straightto your inbox," said Sean.



Eliana answered with a short hum and was just lowering the phone when a large hand reached in and plucked it neatly from her grasp.



Her reflexes flared, but they eased the moment she recognized the man in front of her. "Sean? What are you doing here? I thought Mom told you to stay home and think about how you screwed up." 
Fury hardened Sean's face. "If I'd actually done what Mom said and stayed home, you might've put this family in the ground before we even knew what hit us."



A faint crease formed between Eliana's brows."You're going to have to explain that. When exactly have I ever done anything to hurt my own family?"


To her, the Murray household wasn't justa place she stayed-it was her home. The people in it were hers to protect, not harm.


Sean's patience snapped. "Drop the act. You're upset because I called you out earlier, right? So you run to the Clarke family-our enemies-playing the role of some skilled doctor just to stir trouble for us?"



Eliana's gaze narrowed, suspicion curling at the edges. "This coming from Leyla, I assume?"


"Leave her out of it. She's not your punching bag.Leyla came to me because she's worried about you.Do you even understand what picking a fight with the Clarke family means? That's a straight shot to getting us all wiped out."


The truth settled in Eliana's mind. A cold, sharp laugh slid past her lips. "So Leyla's out there telling people I'm faking being a skilled doctor? Did she also mention the part where the Clarkes threw her out?That fallout wasn't on me-it was all hers."


Sean's anger hit like a storm. "Stop pretending you're innocent! Do you even understand the mess you've made?"



"I'm telling the truth. If you doubt me, ask the Clarkes yourself. Right now, I need to get back and prepare Mom's medicine."



"You're not going anywhere." His hand shot out,clamping around her wrist. "You're coming with me to face the Clarkes and apologize."



Her eyes locked on his, steady and unflinching."And if | decide not to?"



"You don't get to decide!" he exclaimed, yanking her toward the estate's gates. A quick twist of Eliana's arm broke his hold. That only fueled Sean's fury. He lunged to grab her again, but she was already gone-slipping out of reach before his fingers could close.


He pushed forward, teeth clenched, but the street between them clogged with traffic. In the blink of an eye, she was on the other side, swallowed by the crowd.



A taxi rolled into view at just the right moment.


Eliana stepped forward, flagged it down, and slid inside without hesitation.



By the time Sean had dodged through the crush of traffic and reached the curb, Eliana was gone.


"Damn it!" The curse tore from him as his gaze swept the street. She was like water slipping through his fingers. Did she have any clue that dragging her to the Clarkes wasn't just about protecting the Murray name? It was also the only way to shield her from the Clarkes' backlash. With no real allies of her own-and with the Murray family losing influence-crossing the Clarke family could end badly. If they learned she'd been posing as a famed doctor, there wNould be no saving her.


Sean spun on his heel, climbed into his car, and took off after her.







At the same time, Tristan was wrapping up a business talk with Jeffry.


Their latest project meant the Pearson Group could offer favorable terms to the Clarkes-an opportunity Jeffry clearly recognized as a windfall.


Once the ink dried on the contract, Tristan made his way to see MiguJel.


Miguel appeared lively despite his slight frame,carrying none of the visible weight of illness.


"It's a relief to see you back on your feet," Tristan said, his voice carrying a rare note of ease.


Miguel's grin was genuine. Too much time had passed since he'd last felt like himself.


lllness had left him dependent on others for even the smallest tasks-a state that gnawed at dignity. Now,he could stand on his own again, and that meant everything.



"I'm grateful you came. If there's ever something you need in Qidence, I'll make sure it's done," Miguel replied.



The words carried the shape of gratitude, but little else. People rarely acted without self-interest. Just as Miguel's vow to help Eliana wasn't born from pure goodwill-without the need for her skills next year,the Clarke family wouldn't waste a smile on someone wearing threadbare clothes.


Tristan let the hollow courtesy pass. With a brief nod and a faint smile, he left a generous stack of gifts and took his leave.



Back in the car, Rocco glanced over from behind the wheel, eyes bright with anticipation. "I've got one piece of good news and one piece of bad news. Which should I start with?"


Tristan shut the project folder with deliberate care."Maybe I'll grow another ear so you can give me both at the same time."



The jab slid right off Rocco's grin.


People often called Tristan hard to approach, but those who knew him well understood the truth-so long as no one crossed his boundaries, his temper stayed in check.


Rocco's grin widened as he broke the silence. "I'll start with the good news. That woman you had me tracking? We finally caught a break."



For the first time, something real flickered across Tristan's controlled expression.



His voice was steady, but there was weight beneath it."You found her?"



"See for yourself." Rocco passed him a tablet, the screen frozen on a still from old surveillance footage. The shot showed a woman swathed in an oversized bath towel, her face turned just enough to reveal part of her features.



The quality was grainy, the outline of her profile little more than a suggestion.


"We pulled this from security footage at the resort-about a year back," Rocco explained. "Most of it was useless, but this frame gave us at least a partial view.Blurry or not, it's the first real lead we've had."


But Tristan wasn't hearing the details. His gaze locked on that faint, indistinct side profile, and he didn't look away.
###Chapter 22 You Are Gorgeous





The image was as unclear as Rocco had warned, yet one glance was enough for Tristan to feel a sharp tug of recognition-something in the woman's profile echoed Eliana.



The resemblance was uncanny.



Could it be that Eliana was the same woman from that night, the one he had been hunting all along?



But that didn't make sense.



Back then, the woman who had helped him had also been drugged with an aphrodisiac, leadding to that night in the hot spring where they had crossed an irreversible line together.


But Eliana was a master of medicine. Could someone with that level of expertise really have been taken down by such a crude trick? Anyone capable of extending another's life should have been able to neutralize an aphrodisiac without effort. The pieces refused to fit.


Maybe it was just a coincidence.Maybe the similarity was nothing more than a cruel trick of memory?



Fingers drumming lightly against the edge of an iPad,Tristan finally lifted his gaze to Rocco. "Can you clean up this image? I need it in high definition."


"It's possible, but it won't be quick," Rocco answered.



"How long?" Tristan asked again.



"Given how bad the quality is, I'd say three days-minimum."



"Three days is fine." Tristan's tone was calm,decisive. After waiting an entire year, a few more days barely mattered.


"I'll get the restoration started immediately," Rocco replied without hesitation. Tristan gave a brief nod. "And the bad news you mentioned earlier?"


That reminder jogged Rocco's memory, and his expression shifted. "The rumor's true," he said grimly. "The Murray family has reached out to your father about your so-called engagement to their daughter."



A wave of distaste crossed Tristan's features in an instant.


When the Murray name still carried weight, they'd stayed silent about this arrangement. Now, with their influence crumbling, they suddenly wanted to cash in.



To him, it was obvious-they were trying to trade their daughter for a shot at reclaiming their status.



"They can try to use her to regain their status,"Tristan said with a thin, cold smile, "but I'm not buying."


"Your father called me earlier," Rocco continued. "He believes that, despite their current downfall, the Murrays are respectable and wants you to at least think it over."



Tristan's gaze hardened. "Get in touch with the Murrays and tell them I'll be there tomorrow afternoon."



Rocco blinked. "You're... actually considering marrying her?"


"Not even close," Tristan replied, lowering the car window so the evening air could spill in. "I'm going to end it."



With his first move into Qidence now secured, it felt like the right moment to start reshaping the branch office-and that meant cutting off loose ends.


Most of the branch's employees had once served under Jermaine, which meant resistance was almost guaranteed. A clash was inevitable, and Tristan knew it. A taxi pulled up outside the Murrays' residence, and Eliana stepped out.


Carl had been pacing near the entrance, his expression brightening the moment he spotted her."You're finally back! Where did you disappear to?And why didn't you pick up any clothes for yourself?"


He had been under the impression she had gone shopping to replace her wardrobe, and the sight before him didn't make sense.



Only then did Eliana glance down at herself, realizing she was still dressed in the shapeless, ill-fitting clothes of that middle-aged human trafficker.


She'd swapped into them earlier to avoid attracting attention from villagers while the fire was being put out, and somehow, she'd never changed back.


No wonder strangers had been staring at her as if she were a beggar.


With a small shrug, she slipped off the coat and tossed it straight into the trash bin. "It slipped my mind."



"Perfect timing. Mom had a boutique send over a batch of outfits-come pick out something you like,"Carl said, guiding Eliana toward the living room,which now looked more like a private showroom than a family space. Elegant dresses and finely tailored pieces lined the racks, giving the place the feel of an exclusive shop.



Even with the Murray family's finances under strain,they had spared no expense to prepare this for her.


The thought softened something in Eliana's guarded heart.



Her fingers brushed over a long dress hanging at the center of the rack, and she took it upstairs to change.


It was a simple cut, patterned with white camellias that seemed almost alive against the fabric.


Once dressed, she gathered her hair into a loose bun and splashed her face with cool water before stepping out of her room.


Carl was already outside, and the moment his eyes landed on her, he froze.


The plain dress somehow made her look even more striking, skimming over her frame and highlighting the graceful lines of her figure. Her hair, no longer spilling over her shoulders, bared the elegant curve of her neck. And her face-delicate and perfectly balanced-looked like it had stepped out of an artist's canvas.



Carl had always known Eliana was beautiful, but right now, she left him momentarily speechless.


Next to Leyla, Eliana looked as though she'd stepped straight out of a storybook-too flawless to seem real.


"Lia, you are gorgeous!" Carl blurted, unable to hide his amazement.



Caring about her appearance had never been one of Eliana's priorities; if it had, she wouldn't have spent  days barefaced without a second thought.


Offering him a small, polite smile, she asked, "Is Mom awake yet?"


"She is. While you were changing, Ashley brought her a bowl of porridge. She actually ate some-seems like her appetite's coming back," Carl said.


Eliana gave a quiet nod, then handed him the bundle of Goosegrass she'd brought home.


"This is what I went out to get for her," she explained."Add it to the pot with the medicine I started earlier and let it simmer for thirty minutes before giving it to her. I'm going to check on her now."


Carl's brows lifted. "So you went out just to buy a herb for her?"



"That's right," she answered softly.


Emotion welled in Carl's eyes, and genuine gratitude warmed his voice.



"I'll get the medicine right away," he said firmly.  When it came to Eliana's skills, he never doubted her for a second.


Ever since Eliana's last treatment, their mother had claimed to feel lighter and more at ease, and that alone had cemented Carl's faith in her abilities.


Carl carried the Goosegrass toward the kitchen while Eliana made her way to Stella's room.


She hadn't even raised her hand to knock when the door swung open, and Ashley Castro, the housekeeper, stepped into the hall.


After the Murray famnily's decline, most of the staff had been dismissed-only Ashley and her husband,Jordy,had stayed on.


Ashley greeted Eliana warmly, her eyes soft with a familiar fondness born from years past, when she had cared for Eliana as a child.


Although the memories weren't there, Eliana could see the sincerity in her gaze.

 
"You must be Ashley," Eliana said with a polite smile. "Thank you for everything you've been doing."


Moisture glimmered in Ashley's eyes. "You don't need to thank me. This is simply what I owe. If the Murray family hadn't stepped in back then, my boy wouldn't be alive today... so no matter what comes,Jordy and I aren't going anywhere."


Jordy-her husband-had clearly made the same VOW.





In that moment, Eliana understood why they alone had chosen to remain when everyone else was gone.


Grateful for their unwavering loyalty, she silently promised herself they would never regret their decision.



"I'm going to check on my mom," Eliana said,her voice steady.


"Of course. She was just asking for you," Ashley replied quickly.


With a small nod, Eliana stepped past her and into the room. Her earlier research had revealed that Stella came from the distinguished Buckley family of Eighvale-a celebrated beauty in her youth and someone her relatives had once pinned high hopes on.


But instead of following the path they had chosen for her, Stella had married Louis, who at the time was nothing more than a modest civil servant. The decision had cost her dearly. On the day of her wedding, her family had cut her off entirely.


When Eliana walked in, Stella was just setting down the phone. Warmth lit her eyes as she looked over."Welcome home, Lia. That dress looks beautiful on you."


For as long as she could remember, Stella had wanted to dress Eliana like a princess, though those blissful years had been cut short, barely lasting three.



With a hopeful spark in her eyes, she asked, "Do you like the clothes I picked out for you?"


"| do," Eliana replied with a small nod. "This is only the beginning. More will arrive soon,"Stella said with a smile.


"I'll never be able to wear them all..." Eliana answered, her voice carrying a hint of hesitation.


"Then let them wait in the closet. A young woman should always have more choices than she needs,"Stella replied gently, taking Eliana's hand and studying her face as if she wanted to memorize every detail.



Shifting under the weight of that gaze, Eliana steered the conversation elsewhere. "How have you been feeling?"


"Better than before," Stella answered warmly. "I have more energy now, and my thoughts aren't so foggy anymore."


"I've learned medicine," Eliana remarked softly."I'll help you recover step by step until you're completely well."

 
Stella nodded, though it wasn't Eliana's medical skill that moved her-it was the fact she cared enough to try.




Patting the space beside her, Stella gestured for Eliana to sit. "Lia, there's something important I need to tell you."
 ###Chapter 23 Learning About Her Engagement





Eliana leaned forward, her posture stiff with focus."What is it you need to tell me?"


Stella's lips parted, but she paused, as though every word had to be weighed before release. "I've arranged a marriage for you."


The shock hit instantly-Eliana's head lifted, her gaze locking on her mother in disbelief.


Several seconds ticked by before she could speak."Mom... I've barely come home, and you're already pushing me into marriage?"


A hollow feeling settled in her chest. Was this just like Janessa all over again-someone who saw her as a responsibility to pass off rather than family to cherish? If so, she would walk away without hesitation. But then Stella's eyes glistened with unshed tears. "I wish I could keep you here with me longer. You've heard enough to know our situation is dangerous.I may not be able to protect you much longer... sol need to find someone who can."



Understanding dawned, quiet but sure-Stella wasn't trying to get rid of her; she was trying to protect her.


Eliana's expression softened, and she reached for her mother's hand. "You don't have to do this for me.I can stand on my own. I don't need a man to keep me safe or give me a good life. I can manage that myself."


Stella shook her head slowly. "It's more complicated than you think. Your dad's been taken in for investigation. Someone is working against us, and our company's been dragged into it as well. The only way I'll be at peace is if someone powerful is there to protect you."


The Murray household was already walking a tightrope, and Eliana's sudden return had never been part of the plan. For Stella, keeping her safe became  the first priority.



With a crease forming between her brows, Eliana asked, "Who's really pulling the strings against us?"


"This isn't a single enemy," Stella replied, her tone unyielding. "There's more than one person waiting to see our family collapse. Their influence runs deep-far deeper than anything your dad or I can counter.I can't promise you'll be untouched, so you have to trust me on this."



"Mom..." Eliana's voice wavered with hesitation.



Placing a steadying hand over her daughter's, Stella said, "You don't need to worry. The man I chose for you is decent. He's the head of the Pearson family in Eighvale-young, accomplished, and more than capable. I made a verbal agreement with the Pearsons for you years ago, and they just confirmed it. The engagement will be made officialthis month."


"The head of the Pearson family? You mean...Jermaine?" Eliana asked, her voice tightening. A flicker of surprise crossed Stella's face. "You've met him?"



Choosing not to give herself away, Eliana kept her tone casual. "Carl mentioned a few prominent names on the way back."


Stella seemed satisfied with that answer. "He pays attention, I'll give him that. But it isn't Jermaine I've chosen. It's another Pearson son-Tristan. His background has its complications, but from everything l've learned, he's trustworthy. More importantly, he carries the Pearson name, and no one would dare cross him."



The name gave Eliana pause. She knew almost nothing about this man.


Yet her mind drifted to the young man she'd encountered at the Clarkes' estate earlier. Could they be one and the same? She distinctly remembered hearing someone address him as Mr.Pearson.


"In the next few days, I'll set up a meeting between you two," Stella continued. "Spend some time with  him. If he doesn't suit you, I'll look for another option."


Even so, Stella doubted she could find anyone as solid and untouchable as Tristan right now.


"You don't need to worry," Stella said with quiet resolve. "This engagement is only a safeguard. Once your dad gets through this storm, and if you still feel nothing for Tristan, I'll end it myself."


Eliana's lips curved into a strained smile, her words ready on her tongue.


But the door opened, and Jordy stepped in. "Mrs.Murray, we've got a problem. A group is here claiming the estate."


Stella's expression hardened instantly. "Claiming it?On what grounds?"


"They're saying the property was forcibly mortgaged and that we have three days to clear out," Jordy explained grimly.


A sharp edge entered Stella's voice. "That's  impossible. Even if the company went bankrupt, this estate was never mortgaged. What right do they have to take it?"


"I'm not certain," Jordy admitted. "But I checked the paperwork-it's stamped with the court's seal."


Stella made to rise from the bed, but Eliana placed a firm hand on her shoulder.


"Mom, you're still recovering. Let Carl and me handle this," Eliana said gently.


"Are you sure the two of you can manage?" Stella asked,her worry plain.


"If we can't, I'll call you right away," Eliana replied.


"Fine," Stella responded. "Jordy, take Carl and Sean with you-and make sure Eliana isn't harmed."


Stella didn't yet realize Sean was nowhere in the house.




"Will do," Jordy said without missing a beat.


Eliana kept close behind as they made their way downstairs. The moment they stepped into the living room, the air was heavy with tension-Carl stood rigid, locked in a standoff with three men in tailored suits.



"This is my home," Carl snapped, his voice sharp with anger. "You have no right to seize it. Leave now,or I'll have the police here in minutes."


The man at the front let out a cold, derisive laugh."Still in the dark about your own situation, I see. lf you want to play tough, then forget the three days-we'll have you out before the sun goes down."


Carl snapped, fury rising fast, "You-"


Before the words could leave his mouth, Eliana stepped forward, positioning herself squarely between him and the intruders.



Her tone was calm but carried an edge. "Show me the contract. I want to see exactly what you're basing this on."


For a brief moment, something like admiration flickered in the leader's eyes, but it vanished beneath a stony mask. "And who might you be?"


"I'm part of the family," Eliana said evenly. "That gives me every right to examine your contract."


One eyebrow arched, the man in front flicked the document toward her. "Be my guest. Read every line if you want. It's all there-your property was sold under a court order, and my boss already owns it."


She didn't bother engaging with his smugness,her attention fixed on the pages in her hands.


The court's seal was authentic, and the wording was crystal clear-the estate had been mortgaged,seized, and auctioned off.


The winning bid? A meager ten million.


Carl leaned in to read over her shoulder.



His temper snapped as he scanned the text. "We never mortgaged this property/! We didn't even know it went to auction. Who the hell are you people, and who signed off on this?" "Not our problem," the man said flatly. "We followed legal procedure and bought it fair and square. Our boss just isn't fond of the small house to the west.Move out peacefully, and you can live there."


Carl's voice rose into a roar. "Bastard! That's where we keep the dogs! You're telling us to live in a kennel?"


"Take it or leave it," the man scoffed. "A dog house is us being generous-otherwise, the street's always an option."


Another man let out a low, derisive laugh. "Still clinging to the illusion that you're the old powerful Murray family? Your company's gone under,your kin are sitting in prison, and you think you can keep living in such an estate?"


"You..." Carl drew in a sharp breath, ready to fire back-but the sound of tires outside cut him short.



At the gates, several unfamiliar cars stood parked,and Sean came striding in, his gaze sweeping the room. He took in the tense standoff in seconds, his eyes locking on Eliana with a flash of hostility. "This mess is on you!"



Carl's face hardened. "Sean, if you're set on blaming someone, look at them-not Lia."


Sean gave a cold snort. "I'm guessing you haven't heard. She marched herself over to the Clarkes'home and tried to con them. What's happening now is probably payback."


"Con?" Carl turned toward Eliana. "Lia, did you really go to the Clarkes'?"


"I did," she said without hesitation. "But I went to treat someone,not to cheat anyone."


Carl's voice firmed. "You hear that? You jumped to conclusions. Apologize to her."


Sean's temper flared. "Apologize? I watched it happen with my own eyes. You'd side with her-a woman who's barely stepped back into this family-over me, your own brother? She played the part of some famed doctor, and Miguel ended up coughing blood. That's why the Clarke family is retaliating. 1told her to apologize, and instead she ran back here acting like she's done nothing wrong. Don't let her fool you."
###Chapter 24 She Carried Herself As If Born To Command





Carl refused to waver in his trust for Eliana."Something's not right here. Let's hear her out before you jump to conclusions."


"There's nothing left to hear! I saw it with my own eyes, and I know what I heard!"


The tension between Carl and Sean built fast, both men edging toward a full-blown shouting match.


The leader of the group sighed, rubbing at his ear with exaggerated impatience. "If you two want to fucking tear into each other, do it back in your damned kennel. I'm not wasting my time on your bullshit barking."


"Watch your tone. Do you even know who you're talking to?" Sean's voice snapped like a whip before he closed the distance in two strides and drove his fist squarely into the man's face.


The blow came so fast that the man staggered back,vision swimming.


Clutching his rapidly swelling eye, he shouted,"You bastard! You think you can hit me and walk away?Guys,get him!"


Two men sprang forward without hesitation, crashing into Sean as fists started flying.


Sean moved with the precision of someone who had trained for years, but his attackers weren't amateurs -they matched him blow for blow, the fight locked in a tense stalemate.



Carl's voice cracked as he shouted over the noise."Enough! Stop it right now! All of you!"


Then, slicing through the chaos, came Eliana's voice -calm, cold, and dangerous. "One more move, and I'll put him down myself."


"Stand down, all of you!" the leader yelled, his voice cutting through the din. Both of his men froze, glancing toward him-only to spot Eliana now behind him, the edge of a dagger glinting at his throat.


"Niko..." The name slipped from one of them, and neither dared to go near Sean again. They retreated in slow, cautious steps.


Sean's eyes widened. "Eliana, easy! Don't actually do it! You've already caused enough chaos-our family can't handle another mess likethis!"


Carl's jaw tightened, his voice rising. "She wouldn't be in this position if you hadn't thrown the first punch! How many times has Mom told you to think before you act? Why can't you ever learn?"


"Save the lecture and just tell her to release him!"Sean snapped back.


All the while, Eliana's grip stayed firm, her expression unshaken. She'd never meant to take a life, but she wanted them to believe she might.


Her gaze locked on the man in her hold, her voice low and icy. "Where's your boss? I need a word with him."



Niko Hughes let out a mocking laugh. "And what makes you think you're worthy of meeting our boss?"


Eliana's brow arched, the blade at his throat pressing in just enough to make her point. "If you won't take me to him, I'll slit your throat and wait for him to come find me."



"You-"



Before he could finish, one of his men blurted out,"She's insane! Don't do anything stupid. The boss is in the car outside the estate. Hurt Niko, and you'll regret it."


"Then start walking," Eliana instructed, her tone leaving no room for argument.


With no other choice, the two men moved ahead,glancing back every so often as they led the way.


Sean took a step forward, but Eliana stopped him with a quick glance. "Go home. I'll handle this myself."


Sean's face didn't shift. "Fine. You caused the mess -clean it up."



It was true enough. If the Clarke family was goingto ease up, it would come down to how she handled things. He doubted his presence would change the outcome, so he stayed behind.


Carl, on the other hand, frowned deeply. "Lia, are you sure you can manage on your own? Let me come with you."


"Relax. I'll be back before you know it. If you tag along, I'll just have to waste time looking after you."


Carl's worry didn't fade, but in the end, he did as she said.



Something about her tone made it impossible to argue. Maybe it was the sheer force behind her words-or maybe it was the mystery of how someone who had once toiled in the fields now carried herself like she'd been born to command. By then, Eliana had already marched Niko to the gates of the estate.


One of his men rushed ahead to a sleek black car at the front, yanked the door open, and bent down to speak to whoever was inside.


Twisting slightly, Niko shot her a sidelong glance."Let me go now, and you might just walk away in one piece."


A cold laugh left Eliana's lips. "Say another word,and I'll make sure they can't piece your body back together."


Niko's expression soured, though he kept quiet. The boss was here, and in Niko's mind, that sealed her fate. No one laid a finger on his boss's right-hand man and lived to brag about it-letting it slide would shred his boss's reputation.


The car door swung open with deliberate slowness.


A polished shoe hit the floor first, followed by the rest of a tall frame, his rugged features coming into view beneath the glow of the lights.


It was Leroy Natt-the infamous head of the Vulture Brotherhood.



The moment Niko spotted him, he erupted in desperation. "Boss! Get me out of this! She's crazy enough to hold me hostage-spitting right in the face of our Vulture Brotherhood!"


Leroy had already been irritated when his men reported that Niko had been overpowered by a woman. In his mind, Niko's capture was humiliating enough.


But the second he heard Niko's words, his irritation hardened into something far more dangerous.


Predatory energy radiated off him as his gaze lifted to size up Eliana.


Niko's body blocked most of her from view, but he caught the outline of a delicate frame and the glint of a blade at his man's throat. His eyes narrowed to slits. "Do yourself a favor and let him go. If you don't, you'll wish you'd never crossed me. My dogs haven't eaten yet... and they're not picky about what kind of meat they get."


At his command, a wave of hulking men spilled out from the vehicles behind him, each one radiating menace.



Instead of flinching, Eliana drove her boot hard into Niko's side, sending him sprawling.


He hit the floor face-first, the impact echoing his humiliation for all to see.


The sight alone was an insult Leroy couldn't ignore. A shadow darkened his features as he leveled a glare at her.


Then his focus sharpened-and in an instant, that glare fractured into disbelief. His eyes, cold and narrow only seconds ago, flew open wide.


Hertha? The name slammed into Leroy's thoughts with the weight of memory. She was the one who had  slipped him food when hunger gnawed his bones.The one who had shown him a path when he'd been cornered by nothing but dead ends. Without her, the man he had become wouldn't even exist.



But the whole thing didn't make sense. The person gripping Niko was supposed to be a Murray.Why in hell was it Hertha standing there?


Leroy blinked hard, disbelief clawing at him, then rubbed his eyes as if the gesture could erase an impossible vision.


When his sight steadied, there was no mistake. It was Hertha.Absolutely her!


Leroy opened his mouth to speak, but Niko scrambled up from the floor and staggered toward him. "Boss! This bitch is spitting on the name of the Vulture Brotherhood. You need to kill her-if you don't, our reputation's as good as-argh!"


The plea ended in a howl as Leroy's boot slammed into him, sending him sprawling again. Both of the men who had accompanied Niko froze in shock.Why on earth did their leader attack Niko?Had they misread the entire situation?


They were seconds away from urging Leroy to focus on Eliana when he strode past them, seized Niko by the collar, and hauled him forward with brutal force-dragging him straight toward her.
###Chapter 25 Slapping Sean



"Ow-Boss,what the hell? Let go! What are you doing?"Niko's voice broke in pain, his body twisting as he instinctively tried to break free.



Leroy didn't spare him a glance. He dragged Niko forward in long, unhurried strides until they stood directly in front of Eliana. Only then did he release his grip, letting Niko stumble and drop heavily to the ground



Without a word, Leroy stepped back several paces and bent at the waist in a deep, deliberate bow. "I'm sorry,Hertha."



The name hit Niko like a thunderclap. Halfway to pushing himself upright, he froze solid.


Every member of the Vulture Brotherhood knew that name by heart.



Rule number one-never cross the Onyx Syndicate.Rule number two-never, under any circumstance,cross its leader, Hertha.



Leroy owed that woman his life.


Was this Murray girl really Hertha? Could this delicate woman be the same woman who commanded the Onyx Syndicate?



Realization sank in like ice water down his spine. He had just insulted the one person Leroy would kill to protect. Niko's thoughts tangled,his face shifting from pale to ashen. He stayed exactly where he was, too rattled to move.



Eliana, on the other hand, was the picture of composure. A faint, knowing smile curved her lips as she met Leroy's gaze. "It's been a long time, Leroy. I was starting to wonder if you'd forgotten me."


Leroy shook his head quickly, almost offended by the thought. "Even if I forgot my own name, I'dnever have the nerve to forget you."



Without breaking stride, he planted his boot firmly on Niko's stomach. "This idiot dared to offend you. I'll drag him back and make sure he learns his place."



Niko's eyes went wide with panic. "Please-have mercy! Hertha, I'm begging you, don't hold it against me. I swear, I didn't know who you were. If I had,I wouldn't have even breathed in your direction."



The bitter taste of regret hit him hard. Only minutes ago, he'd been barking at her to let him go-now it felt like he'd aimed a gun at his own foot and pulled the trigger. Eliana lifted her hand, her tone calm but edged."Leave it. He didn't know any better. I'll act as though none of this happened-but if there's a next time,I won't need you to deal with him. I'll take care of it myself."



"You shouldn't have to waste your time on the likes of him," Leroy replied, his voice respectful but warm with gratitude. "It would only sully your hands." He meant every word-after all, she had once saved his life and changed the course of it entirely.



Leroy gave Niko's leg a sharp kick. "Move it-and thank her for letting you walk out of here alive."


Still shaken, Niko dropped to his knees in front of Eliana without hesitation. "Thank you! I'll never forget this mercy. I was an idiot before. If you ever need anything-anything at all-just say the word and I'll make it happen."



Eliana arched a brow, silently acknowledging his apology.



In truth, Niko hadn't done anything that seriously harmed her or her family.



Leroy caught the look and gave a dismissive wave,signaling for Niko to get out of sight.



Once they were alone, he stepped in closer, lowering his voice. "Hertha, what's the story here? How did you end up as a Murray? Did my people get the wrong information,or..."



"No mistake," Eliana replied evenly. "I've reunited with my family."


His eyes narrowed in surprise. "Reunited? You're telling me you're actually Louis and Stella's daughter?"



"Yes."



The single word was all Leroy needed. He'd always known she had family somewhere, but the idea of her actually reuniting with them had never crossed his mind.



Why she'd chosen this moment,he didn't dare pry into.Instead, he inclined his head. "Ifthe Murrays are your blood, then this estate stays with them. Keep that contract close-no one will ever try to take it from them again."



Eliana accepted the document without hesitation."I'lL have Seth wire the amount you paid for the property back to your account."


Leroy's head shook instantly. "No. I won't take a penny from you. You saved my life-without you, I'd have died hungry in some back alley of Eighvale. Let this be my way of saying thanks." Gratitude's a rare thing these days," Eliana replied,her voice cool. "Unlike certain people who stay ungrateful no matter how much care they received."



She was referring to Leyla.


The hint of approval in Eliana's tone lit up Leroy's face with pride. "Will you be here for a while, or heading back to Eighvale soon?"


"I'm not leaving," she said evenly. "The Onyx Syndicate is moving here with me."


Leroy's face lit up like he'd just been handed a winning ticket. Working under her wasn't something he'd ever thought possible-the Onyx Syndicate's standards were sky-high, and he'd never quite made the cut. But now? Now he had his own crew and a direct connection to her.


"That's the best news I've heard all year. From this day on, the Vulture Brotherhood is at your command.I know every corner of this city-whatever you need,just tell me."


Eliana considered him for a beat before speaking."Then you can start by handling something for me."


"Name it," he said without hesitation.



"My mother swears this estate was never put up as collateral.I want to know who did it behind our backs."


Leroy's mouth curved into a confident grin. "Piece of cake. I'll have the answer to you by tomorrow."


"I'll be expecting it," she replied.


They traded contact information before she motioned toward the gates. "Go on. I should get back and tell them everything's fine before they start worrying.Take your men and clear out."


"Understood." With her permission given, Leroy didn't waste a second. In moments, his buddies had piled into their vehicles and disappeared down the road.



Eliana turned on her heel and made her way back toward the main house, the contract tucked safely in her hand.



Eliana hadn't even reached the living room when she caught sight of Stella descending the staircase, her voice calling out for an update.


Sean stepped forward before anyone else could speak."Mom,what are you doing out of bed?"



"I came down because I was worried about Eliana..."



That single sentence tugged at something warm inside Eliana, and she almost stepped forward-until Sean's next words soured the air. "Worried about her? You  should be worrying about the rest of us. Those men here for the estate? That's all because of her."



Eliana's expression hardened instantly. Sean had always been quick to act, slow to think.


Carl's voice cut through, sharp with disapproval. "Sean,stop talking nonsense."



"Nonsense?" Sean scoffed. "Mom, you clearly don't know the whole story. Eliana went straight to meet the Clarkes earlier. Heard they had some famed doctor, then pretended to be one herself. Tied to treat Miguel and made him cough up blood instead.I told her to apologize, but she refused. And wouldn't you know it-right after we got back, people showed up to take our estate. If that's not the Clarkes taking revenge, what else could it be? You're defending her while she's putting our home on the chopping block."



Eliana stayed quiet, her gaze fixed on Stella, watching closely for the woman's reaction.


Respect and trust were a two-way street. If Stella was as quick to turn on her as Sean was, then Eliana knew she'd have little reason to keep calling this place home.



Without warning, Stella strode straight up to Sean and brought her hand across his face. The sharp crack rang through the living room like a whip. Eliana froze where she stood, caught off guard by the sudden blow.



Sean's eyes widened. He clutched his cheek, staring at Stella in disbelief. "Mom, what was that for? If anyone deserves a slap, it's Eliana-"


The rest of his sentence was cut short by a second,harder strike, the sound even louder than thefirst.
###Chapter 26 A New Wave of Visitors
Sean stayed rooted to the spot, his bewildered eyes fixed on Stella.



Her gaze cut into him like ice. "Why don't you go on?Ask me again why I slapped you."


Sean's chin dipped, shoulders stiff. "You're my mother.If you want to hit me or scold me, I've got no right to complain. I'll take it."



From the doorway, Eliana's brow arched ever so slightly.



In her mind, she conceded that perhaps Sean wasn't completely hopeless-at least he still showed respect to his mother.



Stella's voice lost a shade of its heat. "I hit you because Lia is your sister, yet you speak of her like she's a stranger-or worse, an enemy."


Sean's jaw tightened. "You're right. I shouldn't have been so harsh. But what I said wasn't a lie."


Stella's eyes narrowed, her tone turning deliberate "Did you see it happen with your own eyes? Were you standing there when she pretended to be some doctor and treated Miguel, only for him to cough up blood?"



Sean's lips parted, but no words came right away. He remembered slipping out when he was supposed to be reflecting on his behavior. And he hadn't actually seen any of it for himself.


With an awkward cough, he finally muttered, "l..didn't witness it, but Leyla told me directly."


The shift in Stella's face was immediate. "Leyla is the one who filled your head with this?"


"Yes. You know how close she is to Hector. She was walking out of the Clarkes' residence when she told me, so I figured she wouldn't lie about it," Sean insisted.


Her expression stayed icy. "Which means you've been repeating accusations you never saw with your own eyes."


That jab left Sean standing there, tongue-tied.


Closing her eyes, Stella drew in a long, steady breath.


When she spoke again, her voice carried the weight of a lesson. "Then I was right to slap some sense into you. Words about things you haven't seen may not be the truth. And even when you do see something, it  doesn't mean you understand it. I've told you countless times to think before you open your mouth.All those hours you've spent throwing punches..maybe it's time you learned to sit still and read a book.As of today, you're done with the Fist Guild."



Sean's voice rose in alarm."Mom..."



Before Stella could respond, Eliana walked into the living room."Mom."



The moment Stella's eyes landed on her,the hard edge in her face melted away. She nearly stepped forward on impulse, ready to ask if anyone had dared mistreat her.



But Eliana gave a small shake of her head. "No. I've already taken care of it. They won't be coming back to stake a claim on our home."



That caught Stella off guard. "You managed that...on your own?”



"Yes." Eliana's tone was matter-of-fact as she added,"They happen to answer to a friend of mine. Once my friend stepped in, the problem vanished."



Sean leaned in from the side, suspicion sharp in his voice. "A friend? You've barely set foot in Qidence.Who exactly are these friends-and don't tell me they're the shady kind." Stella's sharp glare cut Sean off mid-breath, the unspoken warning enough to shut him up.


Shifting her focus, she addressed Eliana, saying,"Did you ask your friend whether this estate really went into foreclosure?"



"He isn't completely certain yet," Eliana answered evenly. "But he promised to dig into it and give me a clear answer by tomorrow."



Sean's expression said it all-he didn't believe a word.In his mind, there was nothing to investigate. This was clearly Eliana smoothing things over with the Clarkes after provoking them earlier.


Stella gave a slow nod. "The moment you hear back,I want to know. And if your friend truly went out ofhis way to help us, we'll thank him properly-with dinner."


"I get it," Eliana replied without hesitation.



Before anyone could say more, the video doorbell chimed. A man's voice, slightly winded and middle-aged, came through the speaker. "Hello? Anyone home?" I'm sent by Mr. Jeffry Clarke to deliver a few things.


The moment the words came through the speaker,Sean practically jumped. "Mom! See? The man works for the Clarke family! Didn't I tell you Leyla wouldn't  lie? Eliana's the one who stirred them up!"


Stella's gaze shifted to Carl, a subtle signal for him to answer the door.


But Sean slid in front of him, arms spread like a barricade. "Don't! First they came for the estate-now who knows what else they're after?"



"Move aside, Sean." Stella's voice was firm enough to cut glass.



Grudgingly, he stepped back, though his glare never left Eliana. Every glance he threw her way dripped with accusation.



Eliana didn't bother acknowledging him. Her voice was calm, almost too calm, as she said to Stella, "Mom,you have to believe me. I never tricked or hurt anyone.I went to the Clarkes' estate because someone needed treatment-nothing more."



Sean jumped on the words like a wolf on prey."Ha!Hear that? She admits it-she really did go there!"



Stella winced, her patience thinning under the weight of his raised voice. She pressed her hands over her ears,trying to dull the sting of Sean's voice.



"We'll hear the truth when the representative steps inside. Until then, hold your tongue," she said, her voice firm enough to clip the air. Sean bit down on his reply, lips pressed into a tight line.



Carl used the pause to slip toward the door, while Stella's fingers closed warmly around Eliana's.


Whether Eliana spoke the truth or not, Stella had already made her choice-she would shield her daughter, even if it meant defending her through a mistake.



In response, Eliana's eyes softened, a quiet reassurance passing between them without a word spoken.



Her confidence was unshaken. The visitor wasn't here to stir up trouble.



Across the room, Sean's gaze flicked to their joined hands, a knot tightening in his chest.


Part of him longed for Stella to finally see what he and Leyla had been warning about.


Yet,beneath the bitterness, there lingered a reluctant wish-that the Clarkes had come for reasons that wouldn't harm his sister.



Blood was blood, and some instincts ran deeper than pride. The seconds dragged,heavy and slow,until the sound of footsteps broke the silence.



From their weight and rhythm, it was clear more than one visitor had crossed the threshold.



The rhythm of footsteps told a clear story-several people were approaching, not just one.


Even Stella felt a flicker of unease now. She could face trouble without flinching, but the thought of failing to shield Eliana gnawed at her.



"Mrs. Murray..." A voice cut through the air, drawing every pair of eyes in the room.



Carl reappeared from the doorway, leading in the man they'd seen on the video doorbell. He was middle-aged,polished, and trailed by four suited bodyguards,each balancing ornate gift boxes in their arms.



Stella's brows lifted in surprise as her gaze met the newcomer's. "Hello... and these are?"


The man gave a respectful bow, his tone smooth and practiced. "I'm Mr. Jeffry Clarke's personal assistant.He sent me to deliver these gifts as a token of gratitude."


In that instant, the pieces clicked for Stella. She had already seen proof of Eliana's skill with her own eyes -this only confirmed it.


She was about to respond when Sean's voice cut in like a jagged edge, saying, "Gifts? What gifts? Last I heard,Miguel was coughing up blood after she treated him. So why are you here smiling and handing out boxes? Don't try to butter us up before you bite."
###Chapter 27 Is There Some Misunderstanding
Sean stood in front of Stella, issuing a stern warning,"The Murray name may be struggling, but I'm with the Fist Guild. Pull anything in front of mny mother and l won't be gentle."



Startled by his hard edge, the assistant asked, "Why would you think that?"



"How else am I supposed to take it? She already had Miguel coughing blood, yet you show up handing out gifts like that's kindness. You think we're fools?" Sean retorted.



Seeing he would get nowhere with him, the assistant turned to Eliana. "What is going on, Ms. Murray? Have you explained this to your family?"



Eliana replied,"He wouldn't believe me when l explained. He doesn't believe I'm a doctor. Hope you can clear it up for me."



He remembered Leyla and her firm claimn that Eliana was a fraud. Families should trust their own the most,yet he sensed they kept Eliana at arm's length. Still,the doubt made sense because she had only just come back and remained a little distant. Feeling for Eliana, the assistant laid everything out,saying, "Please listen. Let me explain what happened.Not long ago,Mr.Miguel Clarke declined so badly that his doctor told us to go home and prepare for the worst. In that panic, we asked Ms. Murray for help. She treated him today. What she did was remarkable.Because of her, Mr. Clarke has stabilized, and he can even get out of bed and walk on his own now. She had to leave quickly, and the Clarkes forgot to hand over their gifts of thanks, so they sent me to bring them. They meant to come themselves, but the house is packed with guests, so they couldn't step out. They asked me to arrive ahead of them. Once the old man is a bit stronger, he will come in person to say thank you."



Each detail pushed Sean's eyes wider until they looked ready to pop.


"No... This can't be real... Leyla told me Eliana nearly killed Miguel..." he stammered,shaken.



The assistant met Sean's stare and said, "While she was treating him, the heart monitor did flatline..."



Without wasting a beat, Sean shot a look at Stella to tell her his words had been right.


Right then, the assistant continued, "Later on, we learned it was nothing but a mix-up. Turns out the sensor on Mr. Clarke's finger had slipped, so the  machine caught no heartbeat."



Disbelief stiffened his features, and he struggled to trust what he was hearing. "Wait... did she actually heal him? Or is this only a brief improvement?"



With a deep frown, the assistant said, "Please mind your words. Mr. Clarke is doing very well now. Before today, he slept for at least twenty hours a day and could barely finish a sentence. Now he can walk on his own. The hospital doctors examined him and confirmed that his vital signs are fully stable. We owe this to Ms. Murray!"



With a cold edge, Stella warned Sean, "Mind what you say. Apologize now."



Sean could only mutter a soft apology under his breath.



Lucky for him, the assistant let it slide. "There's no need for that. Ms. Murray has helped the entire Clarke family, and we won't fuss over something this small."



Those remarks left him with nothing to say.



In the end, she truly had healed Miguel.



By then, the question of whether she was an imposter no longer mattered. The result was what counted.



He finally understood why they arrived with so many  gifts, and each looked worth a good sum.



Heat rose across his cheeks, and he could not tell if it came from Stella's earlier slaps or from the assistant's words.


Then, all at once, another thought struck him."What about the people who came to take our estate? Since Eliana healed Miguel, why send people to threaten us?"



Confusion flickered across the assistant's face. "Take your estate? I think there's a misunderstanding. We are the only ones the Clarke family sent. Nobody else came."



With a dry scoff, Carl said, "Are you still not seeing it,Sean? Those men didn't work for the Clarke family.Every Clarke is grateful to Lia, so why would they send anyone to take our house?"



Leaning in, the assistant asked, "Has anyone stirred up trouble under the Clarke family's name? Please tell me.We will not let anyone smear our name or damage our ties with Ms. Murray!"



Sean looked embarrassed. "No... nobody. I just got it wrong."



"That settles it," the assistant said, and he bowed deeply to Eliana. "Ms. Murray, we thank you again for saving Mr. Clarke. Please accept these gifts as a sign of our gratitude." Eliana's eyes moved over the expensive gifts, and she read the message the Clarke family meant to send. If she took them, the Clarkes would stop standing against the Murray family. And she would still have to see Mliguel again next year for another round of treatment.



Usually she refused work like this, since life and death sat outside any doctor's promise.



However, the Murray famnily needed allies more than rivals in times like these. For that reason, she nodded and took the gifts.



Relief eased over the assistant because he could go back without worry.


"I will not keep you any longer. Goodbye," he said,keeping his tone polite.



With a brief nod, Stella told Carl to escort the assistant out, then she fixed a cold stare on Sean.



Awkwardness weighed on him, and he kept his eyes down and stayed quiet.


With no warmth at all, Stella said, "Kneel!"


He never went against Stella's orders despite his many faults. Right away he dropped to his knees in front of her. "Do you understand why I told you to kneel?" Stella asked in a cold tone.



Sean used what little wit he had left to think. "Because I rushed to judge and said Eliana killed Miguel..."



"Not even close!" Her voice turned colder. "I told you to kneel because you cared only about feeding your pride and ignored what was best for this famnily. To chase your own answer, you kept badgering the assistant until you heard the words you wanted."



Sean fell silent.



"Do you realize that if Eliana had not healed Miguel,what you said could have turned the Clarke family against us?" Stella continued.



Right then a cold ripple finally ran dowvn Sean's spine.He understood then that he had acted rashly and thought only of himself.
###Chapter 28 Her Fiancé



"I'm sorry... Mom... I really messed up." This time,Sean's admission came from more than just a bruised ego.



His bolunder wasn't just about trusting Leyla too much;it was also born from that stubborn streak of his, the need to be right even if it meant pushing others into silence.



Once Sean decided on something, he wanted everyone around him to accept it without debate.Many had called him argumentative, and they weren't wrong.



Leyla had never challenged him, which only drew him closer to her over the years.



Now, standing here in front of his mother, he was starting to wonder if that blind agreement had done him more harm than good.


"In the past, your recklessness might have been excused! Your father and I could shield you back then.But times have changed. You can't keep going on like this-your attitude has to change!"



With his head bowed, Sean muttered, "You're right..."Stella's breath came sharp before she continued,her tone laced with disappointment. "Your two older brothers are still out there running themselves ragged for your father, hardly getting a bite to eat. And you?You nearly jeopardized the entire family with your impulsive choices!"



The guilt hit him hard enough to make him wish he could land a punch on himself. "I was wrong, Mom."


Rather than answer him, Stella reached for Eliana's hand instead. "Eliana, you've had a rough day. You went to the Clarke family all by yourself and even managed to lessen the threat against us, and yet Sean turned against you..."


Eliana gave a small shake of her head and replied,-"It's okay. I don't feel wronged."


"I'm angry for you! You are his sister, his blood. Instead,he clings to someone who abandons all of the second trouble comes knocking! It makes my blood boil!"



Stella's agitation grew with each word, her breathing turning uneven until Eliana hurried to steady her.



"Mom,please calm down. Your health comes first."



Sean's nerves frayed as panic set in. "Please, Mom,you can hit me, yell at me, anything you want-just don't work yourself up like this. I swear I've learned my lesson. I should never have spoken without knowing the facts. You have my word that I wvill never do it again!"



Stella steadied her breathing, though her reddened eyes betrayed the storm still swirling inside her."Sean,I just want you to start thinking before you act, and stop clinging so tightly to your own opinions."


Shame etched itself into Sean's features. "Everyting that happened was my fault. From now on, I'll do whatever you tell me to. And, Lia, I owe you an apology. If you're angry, you can hit me."


Eliana's posture tensed for a moment. "There's no need for that..." she replied evenly. Violence had never appealed to her.



If Sean could avoid repeating the foolishness of today,she would consider that enough of an apology.


A long sigh slipped from Stella as she said, "Our family has problems,but none that can't be solved. What we can't afford is to turn on each other-because that's when our enemies will find a way in."


Bowing his head, Sean said, "Mom, I'm terribly sorry..."



"Go to your room and think about your actions. This time, I expect you to mean it."


"Yes, Mom." Sean's nod was firm, though his mind churned with realization.



Little by little, he realized Leyla might not be the person he had imagined, and she wasn't nearly as untrustworthy as he once thought. It was time to reflect for real.



By then, Stella's medicine had been prepared, and with Ashley's assistance, she made her way upstairs.


Carl came through the door not long after.



Noticing Eliana sitting alone in the living room,he tilted his head. "Lia, where is everyone?"


"All of them went to their rooms."



Carl nodded, his eyes brightening. "You're incredible.I've never seen the Clarkes treat us with so much respect before."



The admiration in his gaze was unmistakable.



Eliana had long since learned to take his doting in stride.



Before Carl could speak again, she said, "I need your help with something."



"Name it."



"I have a few friends looking for a large space to work in-somewhere quiet would be perfect."



Carl thought for a beat before answering, "There's an old factory on the west side. We once planned to make it a tourist spot, but the road access is so bad it's been sitting empty ever since."



"Could my friends use it for a while?"



"Absolutely!" he replied instantly, not a flicker of doubt in his tone. Meeting Lia's needs felt like meeting his own, and her happiness was the only return he wanted. That patch of land meant nothing to him.



"Give me two days, and I'll transfer the property to your name. You can lease it to your friends and keep the rent money for yourself," he added.


The offer brought a quiet thrill to Eliana. She could have rented somewhere on her own, but securing such a big space out of the blue would only invite questions. The Onyx Syndicate still needed to keep their heads down until the handover was complete.



With the Murray name attached to the property,no one would think twice.



Being a member of the Murray family had its perks.


"Thank you, Carl," she said sincerely.


"My pleasure. You must be exhausted after that visit to the Clarkes. I've already run a hot bath for you-it should still be ready. Go take a good bath and relax."


"Thanks."



"Head upstairs, take a bath, and rest for a while. I'll call you down when dinner's ready."


"Okay." She gave a small nod before heading up the stairs and slipping into her room.



The space was a vision in pink, untouched since the day Eliana was separated from her family.


When Leyla was adopted, she'd been given another room entirely.



That decision had spoken volumes-the Murrays had never truly let Eliana go. They had kept this place waiting, as though she might walk back through the door at any moment.



Every inch was spotless, Ashley's handiwork shining in the polished surfaces.


Eliana's fingertips trailed over each familiar piece of furniture, and with every touch came a subtle wave of comfort that eased the hollow ache in her chest.



Inside the bathroom,warm steam curled up from the tub Carl had promised to prepare, rose petals floating lazily on the surface. Easing herself into the fragrant water, Eliana let out a slow, contented breath.



Her moment of peace broke when the phone began to ring.



Seth's name flashed across the screen. "Boss,remember how you asked me to check into the Pearson family? I think I've found something."


"Let's hear it."



"There are two sons in the family-Jermaine and Tristan. Everyone thinks Tristan's the illegitimate one,but here's the twist. Take a guess."


"Stop making me wait. Spit it out."


"Tristan is actually the legitimate heir. His father's mistress swapped him at birth with her own son,Jermaine.The truth only came out last month."



Eliana raised her eyebrows and replied, "That explains why the Pearsons suddenly named a new heir around then."



"Jermaine's been shipped overseas, and Tristan's taken the reins. On top of that, he's proven sharp and has already reshaped the Pearson Group headquarters in Eighvale within a month." Eliana's thoughts drifted to the man she had crossed paths with earlier that day. "Send me a photo of him."



"Got it. Sending now."


Within moments her phone buzzed with Seth's photo.



Even in the photo, the man's striking features and commanding presence were impossible to miss.


"So,it really is him..."



"What was that?"



"Nothing," Eliana said. "Get me his address. I need to meet him."



"Got it."
###Chapter 29 Fragments Of Forgotten Memories
Everyone knew where Tristan could be found, though no one said it aloud.



It didn't take Seth long to uncover that he was living in the Maples Villa.



"That place used to be owned by a foreigner," Seth informed her. "When he died, his kids put it up for auction, and it sold for an outrageous price. Tristan's the one living there now."



"I'll pay him a visit tomorrow," said Eliana without hesitation.



"That place doesn't welcome strangers. Security there is a nightmare to get past," Seth warned.



Eliana acknowledged, "I'm aware. I'll reach out to him first. If he's open to meeting me, I won't have to set foot there."



Once their call ended, Seth turned to deal with his pending work, but a subordinate rushed in with news."Seth, there's a problem. Someone just stole surveillance footage from Glory Hotel." Seth's expression hardened instantly.


That hotel was under their control.


Not long ago, a traitor from the Onyx Syndicate had tampered with the private bath Eliana often used,drugging it and causing her to lose her virginity.


That single act had pushed her into a spiral of despair and nearly ripped the Onyx Syndicate apart with infighting



To pull Eliana back from the brink, Seth had brought in a hypnotist to erase the memory, allowing her to move on and giving the Onyx Syndicate a chance to recover.



Even so, the wounds to them had not fully healed.



Seth had made it clear to everyone involved that the matter was never to be spoken of again and had even pushed for relocating the syndicate to Qidence so nothing would trigger her memories.



The moment Seth heard about the stolen footage,every instinct went on high alert. "Do we know who's behind it?" he asked.



"The hacker's on another level. We're working on it,but we'll need at least two more days to track their IP and figure out who they are," the subordinate answered.



In short, the thief was still a ghost.


Seth shot to his feet, his jaw set. "Throw everything we've got at their firewall. I wvant them exposed."



They had erased that footage more than once.



Chances were slim the other side could recover it, but the thought still gnawed at him.



This was about Eliana, and he would never allow anyone else to dig up her past.


"Got it!" the subordinate answered without hesitation.



In an instant, the syndicate buzzed with activity,each member rushing to their assigned tasks.


Far removed from the chaos, Eliana remained completely unaware.



After taking a short rest in her room,she made her way downstairs for dinner.


All four family members gathered around the dining table.



Sean kept his eyes lowered, not uttering a single word,the weight of guilt pressing heavily on him.


Carl and Stella, on the other hand,busied themselves  with serving Eliana, piling her plate with food.


Even then, Stella seemed dissatisfied. "I'll make you some nourishing soup later. You're far too slim, and you should be eating more," she said firmly.



Eliana's figure was naturally slender, her beauty elegant yet healthy, not frail.



Still, Stella had always preferred seeing her child with a little more softness around the edges.



Not wanting to reject their care, Eliana ended up eating far more than she intended, her stomach so full it left her sluggish.



Only then did Stella's expression ease. "Much better.I'll see to it that you grow healthy and strong."


There was a quiet determination in Stella's heart to make up for the years she had missed in caring for her daughter.



"Since I'm still recovering and can't go out, I'll have Carl take you to the mall to pick out some clothes you like," she added.



"My closet is already packed to bursting..." Eliana protested quickly.



"If that's the case, then get yourself a few handbags instead. Your welcome party's in a few days, so add  some jewelry to the list too," Stella replied.



"For now, I'd rather not spend on things like that,especially with how things are for us," Eliana answered.



"There's no need to worry about the cost. We might not be what we once were, but we're nowhere near so poor that we can't afford such things. Just go and enjoy yourself," Stella reassured her.



Something in Stella's certainty made Eliana pause, her curiosity quietly stirring.


From whispers exchanged by the household staff,Eliana had gathered that the family's finances were in a dangerous state.



Earlier that very day, they had nearly lost their home altogether.


Why, then, was Stella suddenly so intent on sending her shopping with Carl? Could there be another reason buried beneath the family's decline?



The longer she dwelled on it, the more it gnawed at her.



Ever since her return, Stella hadn't once busied herself with anything related to Louis's detention.Every bit of her attention had been fixed on Eliana.



It was easy enough to believe that Stella's affection came from guilt or maternal instinct. But what about Louis, her husband? How could she not seem worried for him at all? The thought unsettled Eliana.



Even so, Stella's persistence left her wvith no graceful way to refuse, and she eventually gave a reluctant nod.



Carl's cheerful personality spared him from overthinking any of it. All he cared about was the chance to take Eliana out and spoil her.



For years, he had quietly wished he could reunite with her and give her everything she deserved.



Now his wish was finally within reach.



Unable to contain his excitement, he turned to Eliana with an eager grin and asked when they should get going.



"Anytime works for me," Eliana replied lightly.



"In that case, let's leave right now!" Carl declared,then glanced at Sean. "Hey, Sean,want to tag along?"



Sean's eyes flickered toward Eliana, uncertainty clouding his expression. Part of him wanted to choose something special for her, yet the memory of how he had doubted her earlier made him afraid she might reject the gesture.



Sensing his hesitation, Eliana's voice stayed even as she said, "If you're free, then come with us."


A spark of relief and happiness lit up in Sean's gaze."Alright."


Carl's smile widened, pleased by the small truce forming between them.



Putting an arm around Sean's shoulder, he laughed."Perfect! You've got deeper pockets than I do, so you can pick up the tab today!"



Sean's only reply was a simple, "Alright."



Speaking his feelings had never been his strength,especially when it came to showing care for Eliana.



In his mind, paying for everything was the clearest way to express it.


Back when Leyla had wanted something,he never hesitated to buy it for her. Lavish presents always brought a smile to her face.



Because of that, he naturally assumed that expensive gifts would have the same effect on Eliana.



Before long, the three of them stepped into Qidence's most exclusive mall, a place lined with high -end boutiques and gleaming luxury storefronts.


Passing by a designer jewelry shop, Sean slowed his pace and said to the other two, "I'm going to the restroom. You two can keep looking around."


"Okay," answered Eliana and Carl in unison, continuing down the row of stores.



Using the moment to slip away, Sean stepped into the jewelry store without another word.



Meanwhile, Carl turned to Eliana. "Lia, what brand of bag catches your eye?"



As soon as the words left his mouth, it struck him that she'd spent most of her life in the countryside and probably wasn't familiar with luxury brands.


To spare her any discomfort, he quickly changed his approach. "What about color? Or size-do you prefer something big or small?"


Eliana wasn't picky at all. "I'm fine with anything,as long as it's practical."



She gestured toward a nearby sports shop. "Those backpacks over there look nice."



Back in Eighvale, she had an entire room lined with luxury handbags, yet she favored sturdy canvas ones for carrying medical tools and other essentials.



Hearing her words, Carl felt very distressed for her. In their world, a woman's handbag was more than storage-it was a symbol of standing and identity



To him, her lack of pretense made her all the more remarkable. In that moment, he decided he would shower her with all the love and care in the world.


"Come on, let's look at these," Carl said, pointing toward the row of luxury brand boutiques and steering her in that direction.



Across the mall, Neal was inside a Chanel store,carefully selecting a gift for Khloe.

###Chapter 30 Encountering Neal



Khloe's mood was already hanging by a thead. By the time she got back from a day of swallowing her anger,she unleashed it on her own apartment-crystal vases,picture frames, whatever was in reach took the brunt of her temper.



Neal knew words wouldn't calm her, so he settled on a different tactic-buy her a designer handbag,hoping the gesture might soften her edge.



What he didn't dare admit-at least not yet-was that he'd taken his mother to Qidence earlier.


Khloe's dislike for his mother had always been thinly veiled at best.



That meant he'd have to get her in a good mood before even thinking about telling her.


The problem was, his wallet wasn't exactly flush.Splurging wasn't on the table.



Eventually,his search ended with a modest handbag.



Khloe usually turned her nose up at anything too plain,but this one came in a rare shade-one her impressive  closet hadn't claimed yet.



He was just about to flag down a saleswoman. "Hi,I'm looking for-"



The newcomer moved with a glow that seemed to command the room, and her face sparked an instant,nagging recognition.



Memory struck like a flash-he'd glimpsed that same figure earlier in the day, right outside the herbal pharmacy.



Could it be Eliana? The girl who used to come home dust-streaked from the fields? Wasn't she supposed to be dead? And yet,here she was-alive,breathtaking,and carrying herself like she'd never known dirt under her nails.



Neal's breath caught, his eyes fixed on the figure ahead.



He started to move toward her, ready to close the distance and be sure, when a man stepped into view right behind Eliana.



The newcomer wore a suit cut to perfection, his polished demeanor matched by the overly warm smile he aimed at Eliana.



Recognition clicked instantly-Carl. Neal had crossed paths with him a few times at the kind of parties he only attended because of Khloe.



For a split second, doubt crept in. Maybe it wasn't her after all.



He slipped behind a towering potted plant, phone already in hand, and pulled up Janessa's contact for a video call.



The screen lit up to Janessa dusting a shelf, hair tied back and sleeves rolled up.



Neal had put her in a downstairs unit precisely to avoid Khloe showing up at his place unannounced.



"What's going on, Neal? Are you finally introducing me to Khloe?" Janessa's eyes brightened with hope.


His tone stayed sharp. "That's not what this is about.I need you to tell me if this is Eliana."


Tilting his phone, he switched the camera and aimed it straight at the girl's face.


Shock flickered across Janessa's face, her voice sharp with disbelief. "I thought that bitch burned to death!How the hell is she still breathing?"


Neal's eyes narrowed, his tone clipped. "You're absolutely sure it's Eliana?" "Of course I'm sure," Janessa retorted without hesitation. "I'm the one who sold her to Emma."



The statement landed hard, slicing through Neal's thoughts like ice water.



So it was true-Eliana was alive. The questions came fast and relentless. Had she turned up in Qidence by accident, or was this calculated? Was she here to settle old scores? And Carl-what was he to her? A man from the Murray family didn't just fall into the orbit of someone with Eliana's past. If she decided to use him, would the Clarkes find out what his mother had done? Or would Eliana take it straight to the police?



Neal's head swirled with possibilities, but Janessa's expression showed not a shred of awareness of the danger curling around them.



Her voice bubbled with excitement as she continued,"If she's alive, that's even better! Emma still owes me the final payment. We can grab her again and sell her off for an even bigger payout. Qidence is full of rich people-the price would blow Emma's offer out of the water. Once we cash in, I can throw you a grand wedding,and the Clarkes won't dare look down on us."



Neal's patience frayed to its limit. Did she really think this was some lawless backwater where people could be snatched and sold like livestock? And no matter how lavish the wedding, he knew the truth-his family would never be considered a real match for the Clarke family.



"Enough!" Neal interjected sharply. "You should be hoping she doesn't go straight to the police."



Janessa scoffed, "Police? Why would we be scared of them? Khloe's on our side. We've got nothing to worry about."



Her ignorance made Neal's jaw tighten. She had no clue that the law didn't bend for anyone, no matter who stood behind them.



If things ever spiraled out of control, the Clarke family would turn their backs on him in a heartbeat-unless had already sealed the deal by marrying Khloe.



Exasperation edged his voice. "This is Qidence,not some lawless village! You know what, forget it. I'm done wasting my breath. I'm hanging up."



There was no point trying to reason with someone as clueless as Janessa.



He ended the call without another word, his eyes narrowing on Eliana in the distance.



Though his mother's words were somewhat foolish,they did remind him of something He needed to get his hands on Eliana. Leaving her free to move around was far too dangerous.



Qidence wasn't a quiet little town-it was worse. In a city where gangs could be bought with the right amount of cash, anything was possible.


As long as she kept breathing, Neal's life would never be free of that shadow. Which meant waiting for trouble to come knocking wasn't an option.







Across the store, Carl had already gathered several handbags and laid them out. "Lia, tell me which one you like."



Eliana's gaze drifted over the selection. None of the handbags struck her as practical;all form, no function -and certainly useless for carrying her medical kit.


"I'm not interested in any of these," she said plainly.



Carl blinked, caught off guard. "What?"



He hadn't expected that answer, not when every piece he'd chosen was from the latest trend lists.



Before he could respond, a saleswoman appeared with an iPad in hand. "Sir, our display is limited. If you'd like,you can browse on this. Anything you choose, I can have brought out from the warehouse." "Alright," Carl answered, taking the iPad and scrolling through the images, stopping now and then to turn the screen toward Eliana. "What about this one? Or this?"



His calm persistence was hard to miss-even Neal,lurking behind the cover of a tall plant, found himself surprised.


To Neal, that level of patience only meant one thing: Carl was trying to charm Eliana.



In his view, a man only would show such patience when he was courting a woman he hadn't won over yet.



That possibility made the situation far more tangled.



After all, even a weakened giant still cast a dangerous shadow. Going up against Carl was like stepping in front of a moving train-Neal knew it was suicide without a solid plan.



An idea struck, and he immediately pulled out his phone. "Vulture Brotherhood, right? Still taking jobs?I've got a target for you-need her taken, fast."



Once the terms were settled, he drifted toward a saleswoman,leaning in tospeak quietly.


Her brow furrowed. "I'm not sure we're allowed  to do  that."



"Not allowed?" Neal's voice dropped to a chill. "Do you have any idea who l am? I'mn Khloe Clarke's fiancé."


Everyone in the store knew Khloe's status as a VIP client, and this saleswoman had seen Neal by her side more than once.



A few seconds of hesitation passed before she decided he wasn't worth crossing. She gave a small nod and made her way over to Carl.


"Sir, the iPad isn't the best for browsing.Would you like to see the selection in our warehouse?"



Carl agreed easily. "Sounds good. Lia, let's go check it out."


The saleswoman quickly added, "I'm afraid our policy doesn't allow outside guests. Two would draw attention. Only one person can come."


Eliana leaned back, her tone lazy. "Carl, just pick one for me. I'll wait here."



"Alright. I'll make it a surprise," Carl said with a smile before following the saleswoman toward the warehouse.



Shopping had never been Eliana's idea of a good time.A yawn slipped out as she turned toward the store's  sofa,ready to sink into it, when a blur of movement crossed her path.



Her gaze sharpened instantly-something about the stride, the build-looked far too much like Neal.



"Hey! Stop right there!" The words left her mouth before she even thought about it.


The man ahead suddenly picked up speed.



That reaction told her everything she needed to know.



Without a second's hesitation, Eliana pushed forward and went after him.
###Chapter 31 You Aiming For My Head



Crowds swirled through the shopping mall, voices and footsteps blending into a restless hum.



Neal pushed his way through without a hint of apology,barreling down the escalator two steps at a time.


Eliana trailed after him, careful with each step so she wouldn't bump into anyone.



For a moment, she had assumed Janessa had sold her off withouut him knowing.


Now the truth felt heavier. Neal had known all along,and she suspected it might have been his scheme from the start.



Outside the mall, she chased him down until he ducked into a narrow alley, where she finally caught up.



Her gaze turned frost-cold, and her voice carried a quiet edge. "Neal, what's got you running like that?"


"Eliana? You're actually here?" He blinked as if shocked to see her. Then his eyes swept over her face with a look that turned her stomach. "Damn. I wasn't sure at first, but yeah, it's you. You've changed..prettier than I remember. Life in Eighvale must've been sweet. Bet the men there spoiled you rotten. So,what's next? You setting your sights on Qidence now?"


She let out a dry laugh. "Word is you're tying the knot with some wealthy Qidence socialite. So which is it,Neal? Planning to live off her money or aiming for full-time gigolo?"



"You-" The words caught in his throat as he shot her a glare.



But just as quickly, he chuckled and shrugged. "Still got that sharp mouth, huh? That's always been your problem. Men prefer women who know how to be gentle and compliant. Still, if you're ready to be different, I wouldn't object to being with you again.I'm a man after all, so does it really matter who you end up with? Whatever another man could offer, I can match it-and more."



Neal's voice carried an almost believable edge, as though he meant every word. If she agreed to stay with him, he could spare her life. Killing her wasn't necessary-not when her beauty was enough to cloud his judgment. The fact she'd been with other men didn't matter; he could let that slide.



Eliana's eyes burned with contempt. "You? Worthy of me? Don't make me laugh." Another word from him felt like poison in her ears; she refused to listen to any more.



Closing the distance, she fixed him with a stare as cold as steel. "Let's settle the score once and for all."


Neal didn't even flinch, as if her threat was nothing worth taking seriously.


Rather than step back, he moved forward, smirking as though this was some kind of game.


The moment his foot landed forward, Eliana's hand shot out, twisting into his collar. She yanked him forward and slammed his head into the wall.


A dull, heavy crack rang through the narrow space.Neal staggered, pain flashing so sharp it nearly knocked him down.



Something warm trickled down his face; when his fingers brushed it, they came away red.



"You crazy bitch! You're asking for it!"



He was furious, ignoring the pain in his head,he lunged at Eliana. But he never even grazed her. Her foot came up in a clean, brutal kick that sent him airborne.He slammed against the opposite wall and dropped,coughing blood, his body too spent to rise again.
Without a shred of mercy, Eliana closed in.



Malice poured off her like heat from a flame, and she looked every bit the bringer of retribution. "The moment you guys sold me, Neal, did you ever picture yourself dying at my hands?"



Shock flared in Neal's eyes. The strength Eliana displayed was far beyond anything he'd imagined.When he caught the glint of cold intent in her gaze,a thin thread of fear coiled in his chest. "H-Hold on...what are you planning to do?"



"Didn't I tell you before-today, we settle the score once and for all." The metal in her hand caught the dim light, glinting like a promise of pain.


Killing him wasn't the goal. Death was a mercy. She preferred the kind of punishment that left someone wishing for it.


Ideas flashed in her mind-endless ways to strip Neal of peace,piece by piece.



Sensing the threat closing in, Neal turned and ran.



But the alley's walls caged him in, trapping him like a cornered rat.



"Help! Somebody-help!" His voice cracked, and sweat slicked his forehead. It had never crossed his mind that Eliana could push him this far. What ir the hell had she picked up during her years in Eighvalle?



Her footsteps closed the distance until only a few strides remained. Then he spotted dark silhouettes at the alley's mouth-men in black coats. They had arrived! The Vulture Brotherhood had finally showed up!



Relief surged through him as he waved frantically "Over here! I'm the one who called! Take this lunatic down!"



From the entrance, Niko strode forward with the four at his back.



At Neal's shout, Niko jerked his chin, signaling his men to rush Eliana.



Footsteps pounded closer, and Eliana turned to see four men charging at her, her eyes narrowing with a dangerous edge. So this was Neal's plan-lure her here,box her in, and finish her. His scheming was sharper than most gave him credit for.



Still, she was no easy prey-anyone aiming to harm her had better think twice about whether they were up to the task.



Before she could make her move, her gaze drifted  past the four men and locked on the figure standing behind them. Her steps slowed. Wasn't Niko one of Leroy's men?



Recognition struck Niko at the same instant, and his eyes widened as though he had seen a ghost.Hertha?No...not again. The new order he'd received had been to catch her alive. Was that bastard trying to start trouble, or just throwing them to the wolves?Memories hit like a punch-how Leroy had nearly killed him over this woman before. He had survived only by groveling and bowing until his knees ached.One wrong move now and Leroy wouldn't bother giving him another chance.



"Hold it!" Niko barked, raising a hand to halt his crew.


Neal, clueless about the tangled history between the Vulture Brotherhood and Eliana, snapped in frustration,"What's the matter with you? Don't just stand there-grab her! I'll make it worth your while!"


Moments earlier, he'd been weighing whether to keep Eliana alive and under his thumb, but that thought had died the moment she'd nearly ended him. Any softness toward her had turned to pure hatred. Now,only her death would satisfy him.



Yet before his rage could spill further, Niko stepped past his men, lowered his head, and bent into a deep bow before Eliana. "Good day,Hertha." Neal was dumbfounded. Hertha? What was that? His gaze darted between them. Was the man addressing Eliana? Did he actually know her? The realization left him dumbfounded.



A faint smile played on Eliana's lips as she folded her arms. "Fancy running into you again, Niko. Last time you came for my home-this time, you aiming for my head?"



Sweat beaded at his temple, and he let out a strained laugh. "Please don't say that. We'd never dare.I swear,we had no idea it was you... If we had, we wouldn't have wasted a second on this fool. Please, overlook our mistake."



Her mouth curved in a slow, knowing smile. "Mistakes born of ignorance don't count."



Relief washed over him, and he straightened a little."Still, this idiot had the guts to pay us to kidnap you.That's asking for death. If you'll allow it, we'll deal with him right now and make sure he understands how stupid he's been."



Eliana raised her eyebrows,agreeing.



Putting her hands on Neal felt like touching something filthy-better to let others do the work.


Taking her silence as permission, Niko signaled his men and began moving in on Neal
###Chapter 32 Do You Consider Us Friends



Neal hadn't foreseen his hired muscle turning on him -much less bowing to Eliana as if she were the one pulling their strings.


His first instinct was to bolt, but the cold, unyielding wall at his back killed that thought instantly.


Trapped with no way out, he felt like prey caught in a cage.


The blood drained from his face. "No... no,no! I paid you! You can't turn on melike this!"



Each step the men took toward him made his pulse slam harder. "How much did she give you? I'll double it-no,triple!"


These weren't the kind of men you bargained with for mercy, and Neal knew it.



If they got their hands on him, it wouldn't just ruin his future-it would erase it entirely.



Words tumbled out in desperation. "If triple's not enough, just say the number! You know the Clarke family in Qidence? I'm about to marry their daughter.  Whatever you want, I can get it for you."


At the mention of the Clarke name, Eliana's brows drew together, surprise flickering in her eyes. She hadn't expected that connection.


Niko's lip curled into a cold smirk. "This isn't about the cash.Boys-make sure he remembers this day every time he breathes."



"Yes!" A chorus of agreement rang out from Niko's four men before they lunged at Neal, fists and boots landing with merciless precision.


They struck where it hurt the most, each blow calculated to send shockwaves of pain through his body.


"Argh! Somebody help me!" Neal's screams tore from his throat, his mind burning with hatred for Eliana.Why hadn't that fire taken her? Life would be so much easier if she'd just stayed dead.


The thought barely left his mind before the rhythm of approaching footsteps cut through the chaos.


"Hey! Who's there? Stop right now!"


The noise had drawn a handful of bystanders, their faces tense as they took in the scene


One of them fumbled for a phone, speaking fast "Police? Yeah, we've got a street fight-send someone quick."



The moment the police call registered, Niko's expression tightened. "Hertha, what's the move?"


That split second of uncertainty was all Neal needed.He bolted for the mouth of the alley,legs pumping in desperation.


Eliana's fingers twitched, and a gleam of silver cut through the air, landing with surgical precision in the small of his back.



"Argh-" Neal's cry split the air as pain shot through him. He ripped the needle free and staggered onward,still determined to escape.



A faint,knowing smile played at Eliana's lips as she watched him disappear down the street.


Niko and his crew took a step forward, ready to run him down.



"Let him go." Eliana's voice cut through, calm and certain.



"But he hasn't gotten what's coming to him yet!" Niko exclaimed,his frustration flaring.


The wounds they'd given Neal were hardly enough for satisfaction. "He has," Eliana replied, her tone carrying an edge of quiet assurance. "He just doesn't know it yet."


The strike she'd delivered would leave Neal cursing every step he took for days. With her goal met, there was no reason to waste energy on pursuit.


Her voice stayed even as she said, "The police are already on their way. You don't want them asking questions about who you are-get moving."


Niko wavered. "But-"



"No buts. Go," Eliana interjected, her tone leaving no room for argument.



Reluctance flickered across his face, but he gave a sharp nod and motioned for his men to clear out.



A sudden buzz from her phone drew her attention.


Carl's name lit the screen.


When she answered, his voice came warm and casual."Lia, where are you? I've got a bag picked out for you."


"I needed some air," Eliana replied smoothly. "Meet me at Entrance One."



"Got it. I'll be right there," Carl said without hesitation.


She ended the call and started toward the mouth of  the alley.


The police station wasn't far, and sirens hadn't taken long to respond.


Just as she stepped into the open, two uniformed officers intercepted her. "Were y/ou involved in the fight here?"


Eliana didn't even have the chance to open her mouth before a couple of bystanders jumped in. "That's her!We saw her telling those guys to beat up some man..."


The officers' eyes hardened. "Ma'am, we'll need to see your identification."



A quiet curse formed in her head-her driver's license was in her old bag, the one Janessa had stolen.



"It's not on me," she said evenly.


"Then you'll have to come with us," one officer stated,leaving no room for debate.


Eliana's lips pressed into a thin line, ready to argue,when the low purr of an engine slid up beside her.


A sleek luxury car stopped, its tinted window gliding down to reveal a face carved in perfect lines. It was Tristan.


 
"And what exactly are you doing here?" His gaze  flicked over the scene, curiosity sparking in his eyes.


Of all the people to run into now, Eliana thought bitterly, it had to be him-someone with ties to her that were already too tangled for comfort, and at the worst possible moment.


"Nothing important," she answered coolly.


Recognition flickered in the officers' eyes. "Mr.Pearson..."





Tristan offered a faint nod in return.



He'd shared a dinner with the police chief,only a few days ago, and apparently, the chief had made sure his men knew exactly who Tristan was.


One of the officers' gazes drifted between them before he asked, "Is she with you?"



A spark of amusement lit Tristan's eyes as he turned to Eliana. "Would you say we're friends?"



Her lips pressed into a thin line. He was toying with her-she could hear it in his tone.



Still, a trip to the police station was the last thing she wanted.



With clear reluctance, she gave a short nod. "Yes." "I'm not so sure," Tristan replied, his expression impossible to read. "I don't even know your name."


Eliana's brow creased.What game was he playing now?Was he really going to stand there and let her fend for herself?


Eliana drew in a slow breath, ready to answer, when one of the officers cut her off, saying, "If she's not with you, sir, we'll be taking her in for questioning."


They moved as if to guide Eliana toward the police car.




Before they could, Tristan's voice slid in, calm but edged with intent. "We may not be friends yet, but I'd like the chance. How about letting her go-as a favor to me?"



An awkward chuckle passed between the two officers,followed by eager nods.


"Of course. We're happy to oblige," one of them said quickly. "You're free to go, miss."


With the supposed victim long gone, there was no reason for the officers to push the matter-especially not when Tristan's position in it was already clear.


They returned to their vehicle, the engine humming to life before the police car rolled away. The small crowd, now bored without any drama to watch, drifted off in different directions.


When Eliana's eyes met Tristan's, there was something in his gaze she couldn't quite name. It felt almost as though he wasn't seeing her at all, but a ghost from his past standing in her place.


If that was the case, it wasn't her problem.


"Thanks for stepping in. And for what you did earlier,"Eliana said,her tone steady.


Tristan's mouth curved in the faintest of smiles."Spoken gratitude doesn't do much for me."


Eliana let a few seconds pass before asking, "Didn't you say someone in your family was ill?"


Tristan gave a short nod. "That's right."


"I can make time to see them," she suggested.


A faint smile touched his lips. "Interesting. I've heard it's quite hard to enlist your help. Seems I'm an exception."



"I settle what I owe," she replied evenly. "Consider it repayment for the two favors you did me today."


"In that case, I'll accept. How's tomorrow?" Tristan asked. Eliana shook her head. "I can't get to Eighvale in the next couple of days."


With her return to the Murray family still fresh, she wasn't about to give them a reason to start speculating.


"Then at least hear the details first," Tristan said. "If it's not something you can handle, you'll know before you make the trip."


"Fine," she answered with a small nod.



"Ten o'clock tomorrow. Pearson Group's branch office," he said.


The window slid up, and the sleek car drifted back into traffic until it disappeared from sight.


From the driver's seat, Rocco caught the slight curve of Tristan's mouth in the rearview mirror-a rare sign of good spirits.


It startled him. In all his time behind the wheel, he'd never seen Tristan look quite like that. It wasn't just a good mood-it was anticipation, and it was aimed directly at tomorrow's meeting. 
###Chapter 33 Damon's Injury



Rocco hesitated before asking, his tone tinged with curiosity, "That young lady just now-was she the famous doctor who saved Mr. Clarke?"



Tristan gave a small nod. "She is."


"I didn't expect her to be so young... but there's something about her. I could swear l've seen her before."



Tristan's eyes slid toward him. "You've felt that too?"



"You think the same?"



Tristan offered no reply.


Sooner or later, the corrupted video would be repaired.And when that moment came, one glance would be all it took to know the truth. Pressed for time, he'd left for the event without even catching her name.



Noticing Tristan's silence, Rocco kept his thoughts to himself and focused on weaving the car smoothly through the traffic.



At that moment, Carl appeared,striding toward Eliana."Eliana, are you hurt? I heard police sirens blaring and couldn't spot you at Entrance One, so l camne running." His gaze brimmed with genuine worry.


Some of the frost in Eliana's expression eased. "I'm fine.I heard them too and came over to see what was happening."


Relief washed over Carl's face as he finally let out a slow breath.



When he'd returned from picking out the bag and couldn't find Eliana, icy dread had gripped him. The thought of losing his sister a second time nearly robbed him of breath.



Relief only came when he saw her unharmed.



"So,where's Sean?" Eliana asked casually.


It was only then that Carl thought of Sean. His brow creased in surprise. "Now that you mention it, I haven't seen him since we split up. No idea what he's doing. He swore he'd stick with you while you shopped ..."



Whether Sean had been by her side or not didn't matter to Eliana. A man with no place for her in his heart had no place in her thoughts either. "Maybe something urgent blindsided him at the very last second."



"Even if that's true, he could've given us a heads-up. What's going on with him? You know what-forget wondering, I'm calling." He yanked his phone from his pocket, thumb flying over the screen. Sean's phone was switched off.



Eliana glanced at him. "Couldn't get through?"


"Yeah... Don't read too much into it. That's just his style-shows up, then disappears. It's not about you;he's probably got his hands full."


Her voice stayed steady. "In that case, let's head back."



"You still haven't had a look at the bag I picked out for you."



"I'll take a look once we're home."


"Okay, I'll pull the car around." Carl hurried off,returning a short while later with the car.


As Eliana reached for the door handle, her gaze caught Niko across the street, standing with several men and giving her a subtle wave.


She offered a faint nod before sliding into the seat.


Her thoughts wandered, turning over the question of what business the Vulture Brotherhood had in Qidence.



The Onyx Syndicate, despite its formidable reach, had always steered clear of illegal ventures. Their suppression in Eighvale had been the result of stepping on the wrong interests-not breaking the law.


The Vulture Brotherhood, however... She figured she'd have to carve out time soon for a frank conversation with Leroy. If they were going to go far,the money fueling their journey needed to be earned honestly.



Carl's car roared down the road, and before long, they arrived home.



Even before stepping into the living room, both Carl and Eliana caught the murmur of voices drifting out.



Was there someone here? The earlier incident with the Vulture Brotherhood demanding the estate still weighed heavily on them, quickening their pace toward the sound.



Crossing into the foyer, they found a man assisting another seated in a wheelchair. Both were strikingly good-looking, and on closer inspection, shared features with Carl-though each looked a little worn around the edges. Were these two possibly...


"Damon! Sawyer!" Carl's voice broke into a startled cry,sealing the truth Eliana had just suspected.


Both men turned at once, and the moment their gazes landed on Eliana, their expressions softened into radiant, almost disbelieving joy. "Lia... is that really you?" the man in the wheelchair asked first, his voice trembling with emotion.


Eliana gave a quiet nod.



With tears glistening in her eyes, Stella stepped forward and introduced them. "Eliana, this is Damon -your eldest brother-and this is your second brother,Sawyer."


The one seated in the wheelchair, his posture dignified despite his frailty, was none other than Damon Murray.Sawyer Murray, her second brother, was the one pushing the wheelchair.


Eliana felt little more than a faint ripple of recognition.Too many years had passed, and she had been far too young back then to truly remember these brothers.


With a small, detached nod, she greeted them.


"Eliana." Damon's voice shook as he reached out a trembling hand toward her. The sudden shift of his weight made the wheelchair tip precariously to one side.



"Damon!" The startled cry went up as everyone scrambled to grab the wheelchair before it tipped.


Eliana moved first, steadying Damon with a firm grip just in time. "You okay?" she asked, her voice low with concern.


Instead of answering about himself, Damon's gaze swept over her in worry. "You didn't get hurt, did you?"


The unexpected tenderness in his tone made her chest tighten. She gave a small shake of her head. "I'm fine.What about you?"


A faint flush of shame crossed his face as he murmured, "I'm alright... I'm sorry I scared you."


Only then did Carl and Sawyer let out the breath they'd been holding. One of them guided Damon back into the wheelchair, while the other gripped the handles firmly, making sure it stayed steady this time.


Eliana's gaze lingered on Damon's motionless legs,a faint furrow forming between her brows, before she turned toward Stella. "Is his condition something that might heal... or is it..."


Stella brushed away the fresh streak of tears on her cheeks, her voice breaking as she admitted, "It's permanent... Two years ago, he suffered a terrible injury, and since then, his legs have never recovered."


The heaviness in her tone hinted at a story left untold,planting a quiet unease in Eliana's heart.


Yet,with Stella offering no more, she swallowed her questions. After Stella and Sawyer wheeled Damon back to his room,Eliana shifted her attention to Carl. "Tell me the truth-what happened to Damon's legs? Why can't he walk again?"



Carl glanced around, then leaned in so only she could hear.His voice was low and grim. "It was Brenda White.She's the one who destroyed him."



"Brenda White?" The name stirred a faint memory,though Eliana couldn't quite place it.


Carl leaned closer, lowering his voice. "She was Damon's fiancée. That day, she insisted on trying horseback riding. The horse panicked... Damon ran in to pull her out of danger-and paid the price."


His tone grew heavier as he added, "We never blamed her. Damon made his own choice to save her. But once it became clear his legs wouldn't recover, she started avoiding us. I even saw her on another man's arm not long ago. We're not saying she has to marry him... but refusing to even see him?" He shook his head.



"Damon risked everything to save her, yet she's never even offered him a word of thanks. And her family?After the disaster, they didn't bother with so much as a single phone call. You probably don't know this,but Damon was once the pride of our family-a prodigy from the start. He even won first place in an elite  international hacker competition. But after losing in love and the use of his legs, he's been sinking deeper into despair. There were times... he even tried to take his own life. Every bit of it traces back to Brenda."


Carl's voice rose with each word, fury sharpening every syllable.


At that moment, the reason Brenda's name had sounded so familiar finally clicked for Eliana.
###Chapter 34 One Failure After Another



Brenda carried the bloodline of Zach White.



From Eighvale, Zach had waged war against the Onyx Syndicate for years, striking both in the open and from the shadows.


He'd even been the first to formally petition the government to erase the syndicate entirely.


When the biggest blows against them landed, his hand had always been in it.


No wonder the name Brenda rang a bell-she was Zach's one and only treasured daughnter.


Eliana's gaze sharpened, a predator's glint in her eyes."In that case,it's time to settle both old scores and new ones."



Carl blinked, startled. "Old and new? What are you talking about?"


Realizing she'd said too much, Eliana muttered,"Nothing important."


Carl's brow furrowed. "Lia, whatever's running through your head, don't go charging in. Our family isn't what it used to be. The Whites could crush us with a single move. We wait until Dad's out before doing anything,understood?"



"Relax," Eliana replied with a faint smile. "I know where the line is. I'm not about to lose my head over this."



Carl finally let out a long breath. "Right now, nothing matters more to this family than keeping you safe. As long as you're fine, we can all breathe easier. Just promise me you won't let anything like that mess with the Clarke family happen again. You were lucky to cure Miguel, but if something had gone wrong,you could have..."



Eliana's lips curved into a gentle smile. "I understand,Carl. Don't worry."



She knew his concern for her was genuine and she appreciated it.



But the feud with the White family went far beyond Damon. It was a matter that touched the Onyx Syndicate as well. That grudge had been written in her mind long before this, and now there was simply another tally added to the list.


There was no reason for Carl to hear any of this. For people like him, knowledge wasn't protection-it was a liability.



Footsteps sounded from the staircase, drawing Eliana's attention.



Sawyer appeared, dressed in clean clothes that gave him the look of an effortlessly charming young gentleman.



The dark smudges beneath his eyes betrayed the exhaustion he couldn't hide. Still, his gaze lit up the moment it landed on her. "Lia, I'm Sawyer. When you were little, you'd always sneak off with me to the supermarket for candy..."



While he spoke, he pulled out something from behind his back as if by magic-a candy curved into two tiny rabbits locked in a tug-of-war over a carrot. The detail was so vivid it almost looked alive.


"Lia,you loved rabbits when you were little. This is for you," he said, his eyes bright with quiet anticipation.


Eliana wasn't that child anymore, and sweets had long since lost their charm for her. Still, she valued his thoughts.



Earlier, Damon's excitement had nearly sent him tumbling from his wheelchair. Now, it was clear Sawyer's care for her ran just as deep.



That thought warmed her enough to accept the gift with a smile. "Thank you, Sawyer."


"Go on, taste it," he said gently.


Eliana gave a small nod, studying the delicate design in her hands, unsure where to even begin without ruining the artistry.


Carl caught her hesitation and let out a chuckle. "Lia,don't hold back. Sawyer learned how to make this just for you. Anytime you want one, he'll do it. If you don't believe me, check his room-it's practically overflowing with tools."


That revelation stopped Eliana cold. She'd assumed Sawyer had simply picked up the skill by chance,never imagining he'd learned it with her in mind.



"I was awful at it before, and you never liked what l made," Sawyer admitted, his smile warm and unhurried."But I've gotten better. I just hope it's good enough now."



Her chest tightened as her lips curved upward. There was even a faint shimmer in her eyes when she murmured, "Thank you, Sawyer."


"My pleasure," he replied earnestly. "From now on,I'll make one for you every single day."


"Alright..." she responded softly, nodding before taking a bite. The sugar melted on her tongue. Sweet enough to seep past her guard and into her heart.


"How's Dad doing?" Carl finally asked.


Eliana's gaze shifted toward Sawyer as well.


Sawyer let out a weary breath. "It's a mess. Damon and I tried everything, but we couldn't even get close to him. They kept us in for questioning the whole day..We'll have to come up with another approach."


Carl hesitated before saying, "Tell me honestly,Sawyer-did Dad really do something wrong?"


A deep crease formed between Sawyer's brows.course not. I know him. He would never."


"I believe that too," Carl admitted, "but if nothing happened,why won't they let us see him?"


"He's being framed," Sawyer said without a flicker of doubt.



Carl fell quiet. He'd always been wrapped up in his art,never bothering with business or politics.


Moments like this only reminded him how useless that made him now.



His hands tangled in his hair. "I'm no help to anyone...completely useless." "Don't say that," Sawyer replied, his tone softening as he turned to Eliana. "Finding Lia was already a huge service to our family."


Carl's gaze dropped to the floor. "That's only because everyone else was tied up with Dad's situation, and l happened to be the only one free..."


He knew perfectly well that anyone in the Murray family, given access to the database, could have tracked Eliana down.



His role had been more of a messenger than a real contributor.



Eliana reached over and gave his arm a reassuring squeeze. "Carl, don't take this on yourself. You're not to blame for not being able to do more. None of us could have predicted this, but I believe Dad's going to be fine."



Even if things ggot worse, she had no intention of letting harm come to him.


Heat crept into Carl's cheeks. Eliana had only just stepped into this world and should have been the one feeling unsettled-yet somehow, she was the one reassuring him.


"I won't let it get to me, Lia," he said quickly Before Sawyer could add his own reassurance, the sharp trill of his phone cut through the moment. One glance at the caller ID made his brow tighten.


"Another problem with the project? Alright, I get it. I'll head over right now."


Once the call ended, Sawyer turned to them. "Carl, Lia,let Mom know I need to step out for a bit. I won't be long."


"Where are you off to? Did something go wrong with that project you put money into again?" Carl asked,his voice tinged with worry.


"Yeah... but it's nothing major. Just don't mention it to Mom-I don't want her stressing over it," Sawyer said.


He reached over to gently ruffle Eliana's hair. "I'm heading out now. Tomorrow, I'll make it up to you with something good to eat."



"Alright," Eliana replied with a small nod, her gaze following him as he walked away.


As soon as the door closed behind him, Carl let out a long sigh. "Sawyer's had a rough run too. He used to have the Midas touch with investments, but these last couple of years... one failure after another."


He stopped there, catching himself before he piled more worries onto Eliana's shoulders.



Carl quickly shifted his tone. "But this time, I'm certain there's nothing to worry about. This project is a guaranteed win."


"Yeah..." Eliana murmured, giving a small nod.


"It's late. You've been through a lot today. Go get some rest," Carl said with quiet warmth.



"Alright." She nodded again and started for the stairs.


Passing Sawyer's room, she noticed the door standing slightly open and couldn't resist a quick glance inside.



The sight stopped her-rows of creations and tools neatly arranged, the room looking more like a candy art workshop than a bedroom.



A thought took shape in her mind, and she turned away, heading straight for her own room.


Once inside,she pulled out her phone and dialed Seth."I need you to dig into why my brother Sawyer's investments have tanked over the past two years," she instructed.



"Got it," Seth replied without hesitation.


True to the Onyx Syndicate's reputation, results came fast. Before long, Seth's voice was back on the line.confirmed it-someone's been sabotaging him from the shadows."
###Chapter 35 Sean's Missing



The news didn't catch Elana off guard.


A man with Sawyer's track record didn't just go from an investment prodigy to two straight years of failure without someone pulling strings against him.


That meant trouble was being planted deliberately-and repeatedly.


"Who's behind it?" she asked.



Seth flipped through the report his team had compiled."The most recent collapse happened when a major incident broke out right before the project wrapped.Before that, a partner was suddenly accused of design plagiarism, and the whole thing shut down. And earlier still, a food venture he backed got hit with safety violations-everything was pulled from the shelves."



Eliana's eyes narrowed. "Different culprits every time,then."



"Exactly," Seth answered.



"And this time?" Eliana asked.



"This time it's a big amusement park. No scandal-just an investor suddenly backing out," Seth explained. "In that case," Eliana said, her tone measured, "have two people approach him, show interest, and talk investment."



"Yes, understood," Seth replied.



"And keep digging," she added. "Different faces or not, there's one mind orchestrating this."


"Got it. I've already told our team to keep digging, and I'll update you the moment something comes up,"Seth said.


When the call ended, a dull throb began to pulse at Eliana's temples, the ache spreading just enough to make her wince.



The lingering effects of the drug Janessa had slipped her back in the countryside still hadn't fully faded.


She reached for her medical kit, selecting a few silver needles and carefully sterilizing them.


One by one, she applied them with practiced precision.Within minutes,the pressure in her head eased, and she could feel the remaining toxins dispersing.


Once finished, she slipped into her pajamas and stretched out on the bed. The soft pink sheets seemed to cradle her, coaxing her toward sleep. Dreams soon took her. She found herself in the familiar warmth of a hot spring, sinking into the water -until a sudden wave of heat surged through her body. From the mist, a man staggered forward,pinning her down.


"No..." Her voice shook as she fought to push him away, but her strength bled out of her limbs like water."Let me go..."


She strained to see his face, but the heavy steam curling in the air kept him shrouded from view.



When his hands ripped through her drenched clothes,the steam parted just enough for her to see his face -it was Tristan.



A sharp knock shattered the image.


Her eyes flew open to the delicate crystal chandelier overhead. She was back in her pink bed, the whole thing nothing more than a dream.


Pushing herself upright, she drew in a shaky breath.


A strange unease lingered. Why would her mind conjure something like that? It had felt vivid, almost tangible, as if it had truly happened.


Stranger still-it was Tristan in her dream. A man she'd crossed paths with only twice. 
Was she really so shallow that a handsome face was enough to invade her sleep?


The thought made her let out a soft, self-mocking laugh.




Another knock followed, this time with Carl's voice filtering through the door. "Lia, are you awake?"


Eliana steadied herself before answering in an even tone, "I'm up."


From the hallway, Carl's voice came through."Ashley's in the kitchen making breakfast. We weren't sure what you'd want, so I figured I'd check... or do you want to grab a little more sleep?"


A glance at her phone told her it was already nine.


Normally, she woke on her own around six, but this morning had stretched on far longer than usual.Maybe it was the bed-too soft, too warm,too tempting to leave.


She swung her legs over the side and opened the door. "I'm not picky. Anything's fine."


"How about trying my sandwiches?" Carl offered.


"I thought Ashley was cooking," she said, brows lifting slightly. "Sawyer made you a special candy yesterday, so 1figured I'd show off a little too," Carl replied with a faint grin.


The memory of her reaction to Sawyer's gift still tugged at him, a quiet flicker of jealousy pushing him to make something of his own for her.


Eliana's lips curved. "Alright, I'll try them."


"Good. I'll head down. Come when you're ready," Carl said before turning away.



"Okay." She gave a small nod, watching him disappear down the hall before slipping into the bathroom to splash her face with cold water.



She had chosen jeans for the day,paired with a fitted light-blue top and a timeless Chanel jacket-an effortless blend of freshness and quiet elegance.


By the time she made her way downstairs, Carl's sandwiches were already plated.


The table wasn't just about sandwiches,though-it held a spread of dishes in all sorts of flavors and styles.



Damon had finished his meal and was now entertaining himself by chatting to the parrot in its cage. When his eyes caught sight of her, they brightened instantly. "Eliana, you look amazing today."


A faint warmth crept into her cheeks as she returned his smile. "Thanks... Where's Mom?"


"She ate earlier and went upstairs to rest," Damon said.


Eliana gave a small nod.



Stella's health had always been fragile, her condition delicate enough to demand gentle, carefully paced treatment.Recovery for someone like her couldn't be rushed-it had to be gradual.


Just then, Carl stepped out of the kitchen, carrying a bowl of liquid medicine-the exact formula Eliana had suggested for Stella the day before.


"Enjoy your breakfast, Eliana. Once it cools,it won't taste the same," Carl said, balancing the bowl of herbal medicine in his hands. "I'll take this up to Mom."



"Alright." Eliana slid into a chair and reached for her breakfast. The sound of approaching footsteps drew her attention toward the doorway.


Sawyer stepped in, the fatigue of a sleepless night still lingering on his face-but it couldn't dim the spark of joy in his eyes. "Something good happen?" Eliana asked, already guessing the answer.



"You're my lucky star, Lia," Sawyer said with an infectious grin. "Yesterday, my project was in shambles after an investor backed out. I was up all night trying to figure out what to do. But this morning,out of nowhere, someone stepped in with funding Not just a little-enough to keep everything moving and get me out of trouble."



A warm smile touched Eliana's lips. "That's great news.Congratulations."



"Still want some candy art? I'll make something for you right after breakfast. Just say the word-animals,flowers, anything you want," Sawyer suggested,clearly riding the high of his good fortune.


She chuckled softly. "No rush. Take care of work first.We'll have plenty of time for candies."


"Deal. And once I've made enough, I'm buying you a whole house just to display them," Sawyer said,grinning from ear to ear.



"Alright," Eliana said with a small nod.


Damon leaned forward eagerly. "So this means the project's guaranteed to succeed now?" Sawyer's eyes shimmered, his answer coming with absolute certainty. "Yes."



"That's amazing-congratulations!" Damon grinned.sharing in the excitement.



"It's all because of Lia," Sawyer said, his gaze warm as it lingered on her. "The past two years have been nothing but setbacks for me, but ever since she came back, my luck's changed completely."



"True," Damon responded. "Since she's been home.Mom's energy has improved so much. She even slept soundly last night, which hasn't happened in ages."


Their conversation was cut short when Carl came rushing down the stairs, his voice tinged with concern."Damon,you were up first-did you see Sean at all this morning?"


Damon gave a small shake of his head. "No. He's usually the last one up-I'm guessing he's still asleep in his room."



"He's not there," Carl said sharply. "The bed's perfectly made, and it looks like he never came home at all last night."



That made Damon's brows knit together. "That's strange. He always comes back to sleep, no matter how late it is. And if he doesn't, he lets us know first."
###Chapter 36 Damon Pushed Past The Trauma
Sawyer and Damon exchanged a tense look, both clearly unsettled by Sean's absence and the possibility that something might have happened to him.



"When was the last time you saw him?" Damon asked.



Carl answered without hesitation, "After dinner last night. He and I took Lia out shopping. At one point, he said he needed the restroom... and then he never came back. We called his phone, but it wouldn't connect. Figured he was busy, so we went home first.I didn't think for a second he wouldn't come back at all."



Eliana remembered Carl mentioning that Damon was once an elite hacker. "Damon, could you track his phone?" she suggested.



Her question was met with a heavy silence between the men.



She glanced between them, confused. "What is it?"



Carl stepped closer and lowered his voice. "Damon met Brenda during a hacking competition. After what happened... he hasn't touched a computer since." Understanding clicked instantly for Eliana. After a short pause, she turned back to Damon. "Sean's missing. And with everything going on in the family right now, I think it's time to set the past aside-at least until we find him."



Truthfully, Sean's fate didn't stir much in her. But Stella's did. With Stella's fragile health, even a little more stress could make recovery that much harder.


Seated in his wheelchair, Damon lowered his gaze,saying nothing.



"Damon..." Eliana's voice softened but stayed firm."You know the state our family is in. If something's really happened to Sean, what do you think it will do to Mom?"



Carl gave her sleeve a small tug. "Leave it, Lia. I've got a friend who's skilled in hacking-we could get his help instead..."



"No," Eliana interjected sharply. "Our family is already under fire from every direction. If word gets out that Sean's missing too, people will start thinking we're easy prey."



What none of them knew was that Eliana herself ranked among the best hackers in the world. Still,she wanted Damon to take this step-to confront what he'd been avoiding since his accident. Hiding from it forever wasn't an answer.


"Lia..." Sawyer tried to step in, but before he could,Damon's fists tightened in his lap.


"She's right," Damon said, resolve breaking through his hesitation. "My legs might be useless, but my hands aren't. I can't turn my back on Sean just because of my own problems."


"But Damon..." Sawyer's tone was thick with worry.


After his incident, Damon had been left battling more than just physical injury-his PTSD had kept him chained just as tightly as the wheelchair.



Three months ago, a single glance at a hacking competition poster had nearly sent him over the edge.He'd locked himself in his study, skipped meals for days, and shut out the world.


That memory still gnawed at Sawyer, making him wary now.



"Enough," Damon said, cutting through the silence with a force that left no space for debate. "Lia's right.If we don't track down Sean ourselves, the whole city will think we are ripe for the taking."


His eyes fixed on Carl. "Take me to the study." The resolve in his voice made argument pointless.Carl and Sawyer each took a side, practically carrying him up the stairs as his legs hung useless beneath him.



Inside the study, the glow of three dormant monitors faced them like silent sentinels. Damon positioned himself in front of the one in the center. He inhaled deeply before pressing the power button.



Even that small act brought a tremor to his hand and beads of sweat to his brow.



"Damon..." Sawyer's voice carried both worry and hesitation. "If this pushes you too far, we can reach out to my friend. He's skilled-and he wouldn't breathe a word."



"No," Damon said, his tone sharp as a blade. "I'll handle it."



For a moment, Damon let his eyes drift shut, then snapped them open with a new spark of determination.



This wasn't just about finding Sean-it was about reclaiming a part of himself, defending their family's pride, and proving to Eliana that his strength hadn't been buried by tragedy.



Damon's fingertips hovered over the keyboard, the familiar ridges under his skin sending a ripple of tension through him. In the space of a heartbeat, old wounds tore open in his mind-memories sharp enough to slice through his resolve.



Eliana caught the faint tremor in his hands and the sheen of sweat on his brow. Her gaze sharpened.


Without a word, she slipped a silver needle from the lining of her sleeve.



A single, fluid motion sent it sliding into a precise point on Damon's body before anyone could notice.


There was no sting, only a sudden, startling clarity


His breathing steadied. His vision sharpened.



He straightened in his chair and locked onto the task,eyes scanning the screen as his fingers began to move.


Eliana withdrew the needle as silently as she'd placed it.




At first, his keystrokes stumbled, halting and unsure.But within minutes, they picked up speed, his hands sweeping over the keys until they became little more than flickering shadows against the glow of the monitors.



Minutes later, the flashing lines of code led Damon straight to an answer. 
"I've got him," he said, a sudden spark lighting his eyes."Sean's phone last pinged at No. 111 Maple Street."


Relief rippled through the room-not just because Sean's trail had been found, but because Damon had pushed past the shadow that had gripped him for so long.



Sawyer leaned forward, curious. "Never heard of it.What kind of place is that?"


Carl, quick to answer, said, "It's the training base for the Fist Guild."



"Fist Guild..." Eliana murmured. The name stirred something in her memory.



That was no ordinary boxing gym. Its members were fighters through and through, honed by brutal training and dangerous bouts.



The founder's fame had been built under the guidance of a world-class boxing champion.


But it wasn't the history that caught her attention-it was the present. Two years ago, the guild changed hands. Its current owner was a greedy opportunist who had once taken a deal to cripple the Onyx Syndicate,leaving several of her people badly injured

 
Eliana had never forgotten that debt. Circumstances in  Eighvale had kept her from paying it back at the time,and by the time she returned, the Fist Guild had vanished back to Qidence.



Carl assumed she might not be familiar with the place and gave a quick rundown. "The Fist Guild's not just a regular gym. Sean's been with them for five years.He used to think before acting, but now... if there's a problem, his first instinct is to throw a punch. He's more hot-headed every year."


Sawyer exhaled heavily. "I've told him more than once to walk away from that place, but he won't hear it."


Carl's jaw tightened. "If he's there now, it's because he chose to be. Still, he could've at least called. We've been climbing the walls with worry."


Damon,who had been silent until then, finally spoke."I know someone inside the guild. He's an old contact.If I see him, I can find out exactly what's going on with Sean." He turned to Sawyer. "Grab the keys. You're driving."


Sawyer didn't hesitate."Let's go."


Without wasting another second, the two slipped out the door.



Eliana told them she hadn't slept well and needed some rest, then made her way back to her room. The moment she stepped inside, she swung open the window, slipped out, and flagged down a taxi headed for the Fist Guild.
 ###Chapter 37 Came To Sean's Rescue



Sean's last-recorded location might have been in the Fist Guild, but Eliana couldn't shake the knot of distrust tightening in her chest.



While Damon,Sawyer, and Carl could find the silver lining in any situation, she had always braced herself for the worst.



She didn't bother fishing for rumors this time. Going straight to the Fist Guild seemed the quickest way to get answers.



The visit wasn't an impulsive decision. She had been waiting for the right moment to settle old grievances with them.



To her, the timing finally felt perfect.


On the drive over, she dialed Seth and said, "I need the full layout of the Fist Guild. Send it to me now."


"Got it," replied Seth withouta hint of hesitation. He immediately started compiling the information.



They had been preparing for a confrontation with the Fist Guild for quite a while, so most of the groundwork  was already done.


Within minutes, Seth forwarded the map to her and added, "We're still short on manpower in Qidence.Stay sharp. I'll have the rest move in faster to back you up.


"Fine," Eliana responded, ending the call as her attention locked on the digital layout glowing on her phone.



At that moment, the door to Tristan's office swung open.



Rocco strode in, his face set in stone. "Sir, we've got trouble."



Tristan slid his pen onto the desk and leaned back in his chair. The black suit he wore was tailored to perfection, collar fastened all the way up,giving him an air of untouchable authority.



"Spit it out," he said, his tone calm but expectant.



"Some thugs stormed our new place on Maple Street.They demanded we pay them protection fee.When our guys refused, two of them ended up in the hospital," said Rocco.



"Protection fee?" Tristan let out a low,humorless chuckle, as though Rocco had just told the most absurd story. "Who's stupid enough to try that?" "I checked. It's the Fist Guild. They were at our opening two days ago, but they left when they saw how many men we had on site," Rocco explained.



"Of course it's them." Tristan's eyes hardened, a dangerous glint flickering in them.


"You want me to involve the cops?" asked Rocco.



"They've already been told," Tristan remarked, his voice turning to ice. "That was two days ago, and still nothing. Someone's protecting them from the inside."



He pushed back his chair and rose without hesitation."Nothing on my plate this morning. I'll handle this in person."



Seeing the culprits with his own eyes mattered more than hearing secondhand reports. If the police were useless, he'd make sure the matter was handled his way.



For months, he'd been waiting for the right moment to wipe out the thugs plaguing Qidence.







Inside the Fist Guild's headquarters, Sean was strapped to a heavy, custom-built chair. His face was a swollen mess, a thin line of blood sliding from the corner of his mouth. Men in matching boxing uniforms formed a half-circle in front of him, though one figure in a tailored suit clearly didn't belong among them.



The suited man's gaze was sharp and restless. "Still not ready to talk?"



"I told you, I didn't take anything!" Sean's voice cracked under the pain, but he forced it louder."I've never even laid eyes on the boxing manual you keep mentioning! Mr. Moore, you have to believe me!"


That man was Flint Moore, the new leader of the Fist Guild.



A year ago, his father, Kohen Moore, had stepped down for health reasons,leaving Flint to take over the guild.



"Never took it?" Flint's laugh came out low and mocking, like he was humoring a child who thought lies could save him.



He closed the distance with a slow, almost pleasant smile that didn't reach his eyes. Without warning,his hand fisted in Sean's short hair, yanking his head back before slamming it hard against the chair.


The crack of impact thudded through the room.


Black spots swam across Sean's vision, and for a moment, the world tilted toward unconsciousness.



"The manual's gone missing, and you just happened to be there when it happened." Flint's voice was sharp enough to cut. "Don't play dumb. Confess now, or you won't walk out of here breathing."



Sean fought to draw air into his lungs, his ribs aching with every breath.



"I went into that jewelry store to buy something fancy for my sister," he muttered. "I didn't even know it belonged to you. I never saw that manual you're talking about."



Flint's jaw tightened, his patience clearly fraying."Slice the tendons in one of his arms. Let's see how long he keeps pretending."



Sean's stomach turned cold, his eyes flying wide.



The guild he had once admired now stood ready to mutilate him without hesitation.



And Flint-the man he had once respected-looked nothing short of ruthless.



"You wouldn't dare! I'm a Murray!" Sean's voice cracked between fury and disbelief. "If you touch me,you'll regret it!"


Flint's laugh was low and scornful. "You think your  family still hold any weight? You're not even worth the dirt on my shoes."



"You-" Sean's voice broke with rage, but Flint didn't let him finish.



"Why are you still standing there? Cut the tendons,"Flint snapped, his tone laced with impatience.



One of the men shifted uneasily before speaking. "Mr.Moore... he's still MAurray blood. Even if the family's lost their power, they've still got a name people remember. If this turns ugly or the cops start sniffing around-"



Flint's eyes turned to ice as he stepped closer. "You're telling me a bankrupt family still makes you lose sleep at night?"



The man's head dropped instantly, his shoulders stiff.



"Then stop wasting my time. Do it," Flint instructed.



"Understood." The reply came quick and clipped.


"Wait! Don't-" Sean's voice cracked into desperation,but the iron restraints didn't budge. The chair held him in place like a vice, and every frantic twist only made the metal bite harder into his skin.



Two men moved in fast, their expressions unreadable as they closed the gap. One man pinned Sean's right hand to the armrest,while the other lifted a knife, its blade catching the dim light.



Before the strike could land, a sharp crack split the air -a small stone zipped in from the doorway, smashing into the knife and sending it spinning from the man's grip.



Metal rang out as the blade slammed against the wall and skittered across the floor.


"Who's there?" Flint's voice dropped to an icy growl.



All eyes snapped toward the entrance.



Framed by the light spilling in, a slim figure stepped into the room.



Sean followed their gaze, and when he made out her features, his breath caught. "Lia? What the hell are you doing here?"


Flint's attention shifted, his gaze narrowing as the figure moved closer.


The newcomer was young, with skin as smooth as porcelain and long hair tumbling loosely over her shoulders,shifting with each step.



Her beauty was arresting, but it was the sharp glint in  her eyes-cold and cutting-that made the room feel a little smaller. Even the men in boxing uniforms found themselves avoiding her stare.



"Lia?" Flint's gaze flicked from Sean back to the woman. "So... you're Eliana."


Flint studied her face, catching the faint similarity between her and Sean.



"You're his sister? Pretty little thing," he said,a greedy smile tugging at his lips.


Sean shook himself free from the haze of shock. "Lia!Get out of here! You can't be in this place-leave now!"



But Eliana didn't break stride. Her gaze stayed locked ahead, her steps unhurried, as though the chaos around her didn't exist.



Flint's grin widened, the gleam in his eyes shifting into something darker. "Got some fire, haven't you? I like that. Say yes to me, and maybe your brother walks out of here in one piece."


"Lia, I'm telling you-Run!" Sean's voice cracked under the weight of panic.


The shout seemed to pull him backward through time,to days when a small girl with bright eyes and a sweet laugh would tug at his sleeve, calling his name like it was the only word she knew. That day, she had tugged on his sleeve, begging him to take her to watch the fireworks explode over the biggest river in Qidence.



In the haze of his own amusement and carelessness,he had let go of her for just a moment-long enough to lose her.



The weight of her disappearance had always fallen directly on his shoulders.


When she finally came back, guilt and shame tangled together inside him, smothering any relief he might have felt.



Now, all he could do was wish he'd been a better brother.



He wished he'd never let his own fun take priority over keeping her safe.



The memory burned sharper the more he thought about it, and the words ripped out of him before he could stop them. "Lia, get out of here!"
  
###Chapter 38 Be Outmatched



Eliana's eyes slid over to Sean, her expression unreadable.


Bruising had puffed his face until he was hardly recognizable.


Still, there was something in his gaze-an intensity she'd never seen before.


"Forget about me and get out. Leave now," urged Sean.





With a calm tone, Eliana said, "There's no way I could explain it to Mom if you die here."


"Tell her I ran off," Sean said. "I never listened to her.I caused the most trouble and pulled the most pranks.She will believe it."



"That is enough!" Flint exclaimed. He had been ignored long enough. "Take the woman. I've been grilling him all night-time for a little entertainment."


"Got it!" members of the Fist Guild answered at once,and they moved in without giving Eliana a second thought.


Two at the front reached for her arms. They never got the chance to touch her. Eliana's foot lashed out, and both were sent sprawling, crashing hard against the floor.



That burst of speed and strength stunned everyone for a heartbeat.



Flint narrowed his eyes as a thought clicked. How had she slipped into here with guards at every door?



He did not get the chance to piece it together when a sharp smell hit him.



Several members suddenly went limp and dropped to the floor in an instant.


"Everyone, hold your breath! The air's poisoned!"Flint's voice ripped through the room, his collar pressed tight over his nose and mouth as he barked the warning.



The warning came far too late. Bodies were already scattered across the floor, half a dozen in total, and the rest clung to the walls, their knees buckling as if the strength had been drained from them.



"Don't just stand there-get that window open!" Flint commanded,his voice cracking with urgency.



One man rushed forward, boots pounding against the floor. Before he could close the distance, Eliana caught him by the collar and drove her elbow hard into his head,dropping him in an instant.



A second man made it through and shoved the window wide.



The scene outside froze him-people lay scattered across the ground, every single one unconscious.



"They're all down, Mr. Moore!" he called, fear rattling his words.



"I can see that," Flint answered, voice clipped and cold. His eyes fixed on Eliana, and in that instant, he knew she was something far more dangerous than she appeared.



"Take her down! Anyone who brings this woman in will earn the rank of second-in-command of the guild!"


The shout from Flint lit a fire under the few men still standing, and they rushed at Eliana with wild determination.



Tied to the chair, Sean slumped against the ropes drifting toward unconsciousness, yet his dimming eyes still caught sight of Eliana defeating the guild's core fighters one after another.



His mind pulled him back to that day she had returned, when she'd wrenched his arm out of its socket with an ease that made it feel like child's play.


Back then, he'd chalked it up to being unprepared



Now the truth slammed into him. Even if he poured every ounce of strength into the fight, he would never match her.



How was it possible? She had always been the quiet woman tending her fields far from the noise of the world, right? How could she be so invincible? The thought left him bewildered.



But he didn't have time to ponder further as the poison took its toll, and he fainted completely.


Across the room, Eliana finished with Flint's last subordinate.



She stepped over the groaning man without a pause,closing the distance between herself and Flint.


Flint instinctively backed away, eyes darting. "Who...Who are you?"



Her gaze slid to Sean's limp body, and a faint smile tugged at her lips. "Tell me, Flint... have you ever heard of the Onyx Syndicate?"


Flint's breath hitched, and recognition flared in his stare. "Onyx Syndicate... You're Hertha from the Onyx Syndicate..."



Eliana closed the distance with steady,unhurried steps and said, "You've at least got the sense to see what's in front of you. Not long ago, your men laid hands on mine, and today you dared to harm my brother. So tell me, Flint-how do you think I should settle this score?"



The heavy haze of poison had thinned, letting the air clear enough to breathe.



Flint yanked the cloth from his face and tossed aside his suit jacket with a flick. "Settle score? You'd better prove you're worth the fight!"


In one quick motion, he snatched a knife from the floor and charged straight at Eliana. His movements outclassed those of the men she'd already defeated,the speed behind each strike catching the eye.


Eliana had burned through much of her strength making her entrance, and now she found herself straining against Flint.



Nothing in her mind had prepared her for how capable he truly was.



The Fist Guild's reports had painted a picture of Flint as less skilled than Kohen. Something in that assessment had gone terribly wrong. Beads of sweat began to gather on Eliana's brow as she slowly shifted from pressing the attack to struggling on the defense.



Flint caught sight of it and let a cruel smile stretch across his face. "So you believe a woman like you can even the score with me? I'll see to it you never walk away from this fight alive," he said.


His strikes came faster after that, each one heavier than the last.



No one could deny her strength, yet too much of her energy had been drained by the earlier clash with his men.



Her stamina was fading fast, and each breath came harder than the last.



Earlier, Flint had hung back, not out of mercy, but to dodge her poison and let time drain her strength.



He understood that facing her at her peak condition would mean certain defeat.


Rather than rushing the fight, he toyed with her,circling and chipping away at her stamina like a predator toying with cornered prey.



At last, his patience paid off, and his strike landed clean against the side of her neck. The world tilted around her. Her legs buckled, and the floor rushed up to meet her.



Flint's grin spread as he crouched down, tilting her chin upward between his fingers."So,you came all this way to settle scores? Let's see you try now."



Her stare cut through him, cold and unflinching


"Still not giving in? The deal's still open. Be my mistress, and I'll make sure you and your brother live to see tomorrow," Flint said.



His lust wasn't the only thing driving him. Calculations gleamed in his eyes.



With Eliana at his side, the Onyx Syndicate would fall neatly into his hands.



"You don't deserve!" Eliana retorted, her tone laced with contempt.



Even as she spoke, a thin glimmer of silver slid from her sleeve, poised to strike. Before she could move,a dark blur crashed into the scene,seizing Flint by the throat and slamming him against the wall.


"Ugh-" The impact drove the air from Flint's lungs,and blood spewed from his mouth.



Shock rooted her in place, her gaze drawn instinctively to the figure before her.



Only his back was visible, wide and commanding, his presence impossible to ignore.



Sunlight caught on the forearms revealed by his rolled sleeves, their muscles firm and defined.


Without a word, he stepped to Flint's side and brought his hand down in a swift blow, knocking him out.



Once certain Flint was unconscious, the man finally turned his eyes to her.
###Chapter 39 Stepping In Three Times
Darkness swallowed Eliana before she could even take in the man's features, her body giving way as consciousness slipped.



Just before her head met the floor, a strong hand caught her, steadying her face with surprising care.


"Si!" Rocco burst through the doorway, eyes darting to the figure in Tristan's arms. Only when he stepped closer did he recognize Eliana.



His expression shifted as realization struck. "She? Then the people fainting outside... all of that was her doing?"


"That's right." Tristan gave a brief nod, his gaze flicking toward Sean slumped in the chair. "Take him too."



"And the Fist Guild members?" Rocco asked, already bracing for the answer.



"Get Simon here. Tell himn he has two paths-face the Fist Guild head-on, or deal with me instead." Tristan ordered,his voice sharp.



Rocco's expression tightened as he replied, "Got it." For years, the police had avoided going up against the Fist Guild, knowing just how shrewd and slippery the group could be.


They operated under the harmless guise of a boxing gym, hiding their backroom dealings behind locked doors.



Tracking their crimes had always been like trying to follow smoke in the dark.


Worse still, their members included people with connections high enough to keep them untouchable -men like Sean.


Simon Quimby, the police chief, was only weeks from retirement and had no appetite for the mess that would follow if he challenged them now.


Yet Tristan's words left no room for escape. This time,Simon would have to move.



Tristan had planned to anchor his influence in Qidence without stirring trouble with either the Fist Guild or the police.



That intention shattered the moment instinct outweighed restraint.


Rocco remained on-siteto wait for Simon's men,while Doran took charge of transporting Sean. Inside the car, Doran settled into the driver's seat and glanced at Tristan, asking, "Where do you want them taken,sir?"



His eyes shifted from Eliana, limp in his arms, to Sean,slumped against the passenger seat. "We're going to my place," he said.



"Got it." Doran pressed down on the accelerator,and the vehicle sped through the city streets toward their destination.



Security gates parted one by one until they reached the lakeside property.


When Tristan stepped out, still carrying Eliana,his personal doctor was already standing at the entrance.


A meticulous examination later, the doctor finally spoke. "She's collapsed from fatigue and has also inhaled a mild toxin. I've given her an injection-she'll come around soon."



"And the man?" Tristan asked.



"His condition is serious but stable. No danger to his life. I'll begin treatment immediately," the doctor answered.



"Do it," Tristan said. "Yes,sir."



Tristan's gaze lingered on Eliana as she lay on the bed.Her brows drew together in discomfort, and the color had drained from her lips, leaving them ghostly pale.


He leaned closer, intending to adjust her blanket,when her eyes snapped open. In a flash, a silver needle shot toward his eye.


Before it could close the last five centimeters, his hand locked around her wrist. His expression didn't change. "That's a curious way to repay the man who just saved your life."


Her eyes adjusted, and the face before her came into focus-it was Tristan.



The needle in her grip had been pure reflex,her body reacting to the sense of someone closing in. She hadn't expected him.



The pressure driving the needle forward eased,and Tristan let go of her hand without another word.


Glancing around, she took in the unfamiliar room,every detail putting her on guard. "Where am I? And how exactly did I end up here?"


Fragments of memory returned-she'd been inside the Fist Guild gym. "I was there on my own business," Tristan replied in an even tone. "Found you passed out. Since I had no idea where you live, I brought you here instead."


Realization clicked into place. This had to be the Maples Villa.



As if reading her thoughts, Tristan said plainly,"You're in the Maples Villa."



Another memory slammed into her-the moment she had been seconds away from a deadly fight with Flint,when a sudden strike had sent him sprawling.



"So that was you," she murmured.



"Correct." His brow lifted in quiet amusement."Seems you're stacking up debts with me."



She held his gaze, silent long enough for the air to feel weighted, before saying,"What do you want me to do for you?"



"What's that supposed to mean?" Tristan asked.



"This makes the third time you've stepped in for me.If you have something you need from me,you can ask now," Eliana answered with quiet composure.



Trusting that anyone would step in three times without wanting something back felt impossible to her.



A low, almost mocking laugh slipped from Tristan."What? Hard to believe I might actually enjoy lending a hand?"



Eliana met his gaze in silence.


If he truly were as generous and uncomplicated as he claimed, there was no way he could have risen to control the intricate Pearson family in such a short span.



Her thoughts settled, and she finally said, "Please spare me the guessing. Just tell me what you want. I'm not the type to keep debts hanging over my head."


A quiet sigh escaped Tristan, the kind that hinted at reluctant amusement. She might look agreeable on the surface, but he was learning she was as unyielding as they came.


"Alright then," he said at last. "My father's been unwell recently.I want you to treat him."



"That's it?" Eliana asked, skepticism lining her voice.She had already given that promise before.


Tristan replied, "For anything else, give me some time.Nothing else comes to mind just yet."


"Fine." She gave a single nod. her.



A low, almost mocking laugh slipped from Tristan."What? Hard to believe I might actually enjoy lending a hand?"

Tristan replied, "For anything else, give me some time.Nothing else comes to mind just yet."


"Fine." She gave a single nod. His lips lifted faintly as he dragged a chair closer and sat beside her. "I've helped you three times now. Are you going to tell me your name?"


"Eliana," she answered.



"Eliana," Tristan repeated, letting the sound linger."It suits you."



Eliana gave a perfunctory smile and asked about Sean,"That man tied to the chair earlier-what happened to him?"



"He's in the room next door. My doctor is with him,"Tristan answered without hesitation.



At that, Eliana flung the blanket aside, swinging her legs to get up-only to freeze mid-motion when she realized her clothes were entirely different.



Her eyes snapped to Tristan, the chill in them sharp enough to cut.



Both hands lifted in a placating gesture, he said,"Don't get the wrong idea. I had one of the maids change you."



Eliana's gaze narrowed, studying his face for the slightest crack in composure.


 
With a half-shrug and a weary breath, Tristan added,  "Trust me, I wouldn't sink low enough to take advantage of someone unconscious."



The coldness in her stare melted away completely at that.



"I appreciate it," she said at last.



"You've got it backwards. I'm the one who should be thanking you." His mouth curved into a smile as his eyes lingered on her.



A flicker of surprise crossed her face."Thanking me?"



"Yes, the Pearson Group has just shifted its focus to Qidence, and the Fist Guild has been causing trouble repeatedly. I went there today to deal with them,but thanks to you, that mess got handled a lot faster,"Tristan explained.



Now it made sense to her why he had turned up at the Fist Guild gym in the first place.


"And the head of the Fist Guild?" Eliana asked,thinking of Flint.



"Probably sitting under a bright light at the police station as we speak," Tristan replied.



She gave a short nod, ready to ask about seeing Sean,when a knock sounded and a man in a white coat rushed in. "Mr. Pearson, the gentleman next door just started vomiting blood, I-" the doctor said.


A sudden rush of air cut him off as a shadow darted past. By the time he registered the movement,the bed was empty-Eliana was gone.


Another blast of wind followed an instant later. Tristan,too,had vanished from the room.



The doctor stared at the doorway in disbelief.
###Chapter 40 Stay As Long As You Need
Next door, Sean had seemed to be recovering until a single sip of water set off a harsh cough that ended in a spray of blood. The color was almost black, carrying a heaviness that made the air in the room feel colder.



When Eliana stepped inside, the floor was already streaked with a dark, spreading pool.


"Lia..." Sean's voice cracked; his eyes lit faintly the moment they landed on her.



"Please keep our relationship a secret for now," she murmured.



She didn't fully trust Tristan. His ties ran deep and tangled,and she wasn't ready for him to know she bore the Murray bloodline.



Sean didn't ask why and simply nodded.



"Are you alright? Did they do anything to you?"



"I'm fine," she replied, her voice steady but quiet.


She bent over him, studying his face and pulse for any sign of something worse. After several tense seconds, she let her breath go and turned toward Tristan, who lingered just inside the doorway.



"Where did you stash my clothes?" she asked, her gaze fixed on Tristan.



A slight tilt of Tristian's head was all it took for Doran to step forward, a bag already in hand.


When she opened it, her clothes were folded inside,along with the familiar pouch she never traveled without.



Her hand slipped into the pouch, pulling out a slim glass bottle. She shook out a single black pill and pressed it into Sean's palm. "Take this."


In the past, Sean would've questioned her first. This time, he didn't hesitate-he swallowed it in one motion.



She followed with one of her own, the pill disappearing down her throat without a pause.



Tristan's eyes stayed on her. "That's the antidote to the toxin, isn't it?"



"It is," she said, holding another pill toward him. "You were in that room too. Take one. That gym was swarming with people, and I had to play it differently to make sure we could get out clean."



His gaze lingered, steady and unblinking, loaded with unspoken judgment.



Eliana read the unspoken accusation in his eyes-he was telling her without words that her plan had fallen short.



Irritation flared, and she retorted, "That's on Flint Moore.The man's slipperier than l expected. If I'd seen it coming, he wouldn't have lasted long enough to call it a fight."



Storming the Fist Guild gym alone hadn't been an act of ego. She knew she had the skill to break them apart piece by piece.



What she hadn't counted on was Seth's intel being off -and Flint proving far more dangerous and unpredictable than expected. That miscalculation had cost her the win.



"I never said a word," Tristan remarked, his tone carrying more weight than the words themselves.


Her mouth opened, but nothing came out. Whatever she had been about to say withered, and she lost the urge to speak to him entirely.


The shift in her expression told Tristian enough-she was angry-but for once, he truly hadn't said anything. He drew a breath to respond, but the door opened and Rocco stepped inside.



"Sir..." His eyes flicked towvard Eliana and Sean, as if debating whether to continue.



"There's no one here who doesn't need to hear it,"Tristan said.



Rocco nodded and spoke quickly. "The Fist Guild's members have all been rounded up, but things on the floor are messy. The police chief has hit a wall,and he's asking for you to come in person."



"I get it," Tristan said with a nod. His attention shifted to Eliana. "Why don't you both stay here until this is settled? You could use the rest."



"That won't be necessary," Eliana replied without hesitation. "We've already imposed on you long enough. We'll be leaving now."



She slipped an arm under Sean's to help him up.


The moment his feet hit the floor, his legs gave out,and he nearly crumpled.


A reluctant sigh escaped her. "Looks like we might have to trouble you a bit longer."



"There's more than enough space here," Tristan said  with a faint smile. "Stay as long as you need. I'll take care of the situation and be back soon."



She gave a short nod, watching him disappear through the door.



Turning back to Sean, she eased him onto the bed and asked, "Tell me how you're actually feeling."



"I'm fine," he said quickly, trying to sound casual.



Eliana's brow tightened. "I'm your doctor right now. If you want to survive this, drop the act and tell me the truth."



Sean exhaled and replied, "Earlier, it was bad.I couldn't catch my breath. But after your pill,it's easier to breathe...only my chest feels like it's been crushed."



Sean's body swayed, the pain threatening to drag him under, his legs barely able to hold him up.



Eliana didn't waste a second before stepping in to check him again.



"Does it hurt when I press here?" she asked, applying gentle pressure.



"No," he answered, shaking his head.



Eliana shifted her hand to another spot. "And here?" 
His face drained of color, lips paling as he flinched.


Pulling her hand back, she said firmly, "Two ribs are fractured. You'll need real rest if you expect them to heal. Nothing else is wrong."


Rib fractures weren't like cuts or sprains-there was no treatment except patience.



As a trained boxer, Sean understood exactly what that diagnosis meant.


"How am I supposed to face Mom like this?" he asked,worry creeping into his voice.



Eliana's tone turned sharp. "Now you're thinking about how she'll react? You should've thought about that before running off like you were untouchable."



"I wasn't acting without thinking," Sean said quickly."I slipped away, planning to surprise you with a custom jewelry set. I'd just finished the design with the clerk when members of the Fist Guild grabbed me."



"Why would they do that if you're connected to them?"Eliana asked, her brows knitting in confusion.



Sean's expression darkened. "The store's owned by the Fist Guild. In fact, the whole mall belongs to them.Something went missing from the jewelry store, and they accused me of stealing it." "What exactly did they say was taken?" Eliana asked.


rare boxing manual," he answered, his voice tight."But I swear I never touched it."


She believed him-he had no reason to lie to her about something like this.


"Alright," she said with a firm nod. "I'll find out the truth."



In her mind, there was no question. If the Fist Guild had ignored Sean's ties and treated him like a criminal,the missing item had to be important-important enough to matter even to the Onyx Syndicate.



Since the real thief had set Sean up, she wasn't going to let them walk free, no matter that the Fist Guild was already in custody.



"Weren't you living in the countryside all this time?When did you learn to fight like that?" asked Sean.



"Who decided people in the countryside can't be skilled fighters?" she replied evenly.


Sean didn't hesitate. "True. Plenty of masters retire to quiet places where no one will find them."



Midway through speaking, a wave of fatigue hit him hard. The sedative the doctor had given before his coughing fit was starting to work, its effects dulling the pain and pulling him toward sleep



Catching the change in his expression, Eliana said,"Rest for a while. When you're feeling stronger, we'll head back home."



"Alright," Sean murmured, sinking back into the bed.


"Mind if I borrow your phone to tell the family you're safe?" she asked.



"Go ahead." He passed it over without hesitation. The screen was cracked in two places, but it still lit up.



A photo filled the display-Sean and Leyla, standing side by side.


From the cap and gown Leyla wore, Eliana guessed it was taken on Leyla's graduation day.



Sean caught her glance and scratched the back of his neck. "Leyla told me to set it as my wallpaper.I just..never got around to changing it."

###Chapter 41 Could This Be Tristan's Girlfriend


To Eliana, feeling jealous-whether over romance, friendship, or blood ties-was nothing more than petty and pointless.

If she had to work hard to obtain those things, it meant they were never truly meant for her.

Without paying Sean's uncomfortable look any mind, she busied herself with his phone, fingers gliding over the screen as she composed a message to Damon.

The text, phrased as though Sean had written it, assured Damon that Sean was perfectly safe.

The text claimed Sean had left town on personal business and hadn't been able to return home the night before.

The moment the message sent, the phone began to ring-Damon was calling.

A short message clearly wasn't enough to calm him.

Expecting this, Eliana slipped the phone into Sean's hand without hesitation.

He brought it to his ear, trying to sound as normal as he could while telling Damon he was all right.

Damon's voice came through sharp and annoyed, but after a few scolding words, the call came to an end.

A weary breath escaped Sean, and under the pull of the medication, he soon drifted into sleep.

With quiet steps, Eliana slipped out of the room.

Rocco had already left with Tristan, and that left Doran stationed outside, alert and ready to respond if anything came up.

Knowing she might be the very person Tristan had been searching for, Doran didn't dare drop his guard.

"How is Sean doing now?" he asked,his voice polite. "He's asleep and doing fine," replied Eliana.

"Good to hear. Would you care for a short walk? The villa grounds are entirely private, and the scenery's worth enjoying. It might help you relax," Doran suggested.

The doctor beside him added, "You should get some fresh air. It'll help clear the toxins out of your system."

She already understood the truth in that. Part of her wanted to see just how tightly guarded this villa really was. It wasn't often that Seth gave out explicit warnings about a location's security.

"Sure, I'd love to." She gave a small nod and added, "But I'd rather explore on my own."

There was a pause before Doran responded, "In that case, I'll take you to get your face scanned first."

"My face scanned?" she asked, lifting a brow.

"Yes," said Doran with a trace of pride. "This place is fitted with Pearson Group's most advanced surveillance tech."

As Doran explained, the system's design became clear to Eiana. Instead of relying on guards, every measure depended on an Al network. Anyone who hadn't been logged into the system would be flagged the moment they stepped past the perimeter. If the system judged it necessary, it could even deploy an anesthetic to drop the intruder on the spot.

That realization made Eliana feel unexpectedly relieved. It was a good thing she'd made that unplanned stop at the Fist Guild gym. Her original route would've taken her straight here. Had she walked in without knowing any of this, things could've taken an ugly turn fast. Chances were high she'd have been knocked flat before even making it to the front door.

Her face was scanned and uploaded in no time.

Doran said, "You're now officially cleared. You can go wherever you like inside or outside the grounds. And if something comes up, just call for me. The system will ping me, and I'll come find you."

Her answer was a simple nod of acknowledgment.

Stepping outside the villa, she caught sight of a lake shimmering under the light, framed by dense maple trees.

Since autumn hadn't arrived yet, the leaves were still holding onto their green. But once fall rolled in, this entire place would probably look like a painting.

As Eliana followed the path halfway around the lake's edge, her eyes caught a glimpse of a modest two-story cottage nestled in the distance. The maple forest concealed it so well that anyone standing at the main building would never know it existed.

Though modest in size, the cottage carried a quiet charm.

Eliana was just about to speculate on how long it had stood there when the door creaked open without warning.

A woman stepped out in a tight dress. The fabric clung to her frame, the high slit revealing a flash of thigh,while the low neckline framed delicate shoulders and a smooth collarbone. Sunlight caught in her golden hair,making her presence hard to ignore.

Could this be Tristan's girlfriend? But that wouldn't make sense. He was supposed to be engaged to her.How could he have another woman tucked away here and still act like nothing was wrong?

That thought brought a flicker of disgust to Eliana's face. Her brows drew together, her opinion of Tristan dropping even further.

While she looked the woman over, the stranger didn't hesitate to return the favor.

This was Anaya-the woman Tristan had taken from Moonlight Club and stashed away at the cottage.

From the moment she arrived, she had made several attempts to flee, only to be dragged back each time by Tristan's men.

Over time, she caught on. There weren't many guards around, but that didn't mean the place lacked surveillance. Hidden cameras could be anywhere. Behind a rock or inside a branch.

Eventually, she stopped trying. There was no way out.

Part of her began to think that maybe, if enough time passed, Tristan might come to feel something for her. Even if tat never happened, her position here gave her certain advantages. She imagined the possibility of sharing his bed and having his baby, perhaps after too much to drink.

If that happened, past grudges would lose their bite, and she'd no longer have to fear him using her history against her.

But just when she stepped outside to stretch her legs, she caught sight of Eliana standing at her door.

Despite the loose lounge clothes, Eliana had a naturally elegant shape that couldn't be hidden. Her bare face, untouched by makeup, was shockingly beautiful. There was no doubt-she had the kind of beauty that turned heads wherever she went.

With just one look, Anaya could tell she was trouble. The sort of woman who didn't even have to try to draw a man's attention away.

Tension tightened in her gaze as she strode over and stopped in front of Eliana. "Who exactly are you? And how did you end up here?"

The question came edged with the confidence of someone who considered herself the mistress of the place.

Now that they were face to face, she couldn't ignore the quiet intensity that clung to Eliana. It was more than just good looks-it was the kind of presence that made others shrink without trying.

Right away, Anaya knew she was dealing with someone dangerous.

Technically,Eliana was standing on Tristan's territory. And he had gone out of his way to help her.

That fact wasn't lost on her, so she pushed down her distaste and kept her tone civil. "I didn't mean to cause any trouble. Just stepped out to get some air. I'll be on my way."

"You're a guest?" Anaya gave her a slow once-over and said, "That's strange. I usually know about everyone who comes here."

"It might've been a last-minute visit. MMaybe Mr. Pearson didn't get the chance to fill you in," said Eliana,keeping her expression even. The reply told Anaya everything-this woman had completely misread her role in Tristan's life. Feeling a small thrill of victory, she leaned in and said, "I don't enjoy seeing Tristan entertain other women. If you've got nothing else to do, it's best you leave."

Eliana's voice came out cold and sharp. "Don't worry. I won't overstay. You'll have him all to yourself soon enough."

She didn't wait for a reply. She turned around and walked away without hesitation.

Anaya stood in place, eyes fixed on her fading figure. If she wanted to secure her place, she'd need to act quickly and have Tristan's baby. Opportunities like this didn't wait around forever.

###Chapter 42 Calling Off The Engagement


Anaya understood her talents had limits, yet she relied on her own repertoire-especially the kind that worked behind closed doors.

Her attempt at the Moonlight Club had fallen flat the other night, but the situation had been far from ideal.

With Tristan's men crowding the room, she hadn't found a single opening to act.

Still, she was certain that the moment she caught him alone, her chance would arrive.

Eliana walked on for a long stretch before sensing the woman's eyes finally drift away.

She had a sharp instinct for reading people's real character, and this one radiated the air of someone well-versed in handling men.

It startled her that Tristan would bother with a woman like that. Unexpected as it was, it somehow fit.

There was no chance her engagement to Tristan would moveforward now.

When Eliana returned to the villa, Doran was already hurryingtoward her, a trace of concern in his eyes."You're back so soon? Did you finish your walk?"

"I did," Eliana replied, her tone giving nothing away.

"Would you like some coffee? We just got a fresh batch of beans-supposed to be top quality," Doran offered eagerly.

"That's kind of you, but don't trouble yourself. I'll'go check on Sean Murray," she said, giving a small shake of her head.

Without another word, she made her way upstairs, her steps calm but deliberate.

Scratching at his hair, Doran leaned toward his subordinate and murmured, "Did I mess up somehow? She looked like she took that the wrong way." His subordinate blinked in confusion. "Doesn't seem like you said anything bad. But women... they're a mystery. Guys like us, still single, don't stand a chance at figuring them out."

"Guess you've got a point." With that, Doran let the thought drift away.

Upstairs, Sean had already woken from his nap and was testing whether he could ease himself out of bed when Eliana stepped through the doorway.

Eliana's voice stayed even as she asked, "How's your body holding up?"

Sean straightened slowly, testing his balance. "Much better. I think I can walk on my own now."

While his scrapes were nothing serious, every breath sent a sharp stab through his ribs.

Eliana stepped closer, her fingers deft and sure as she slid a few silver needles into precise acupuncture points. The pain in his chest eased almost instantly.

"Wow, that's incredible," Sean murmured, wide-eyed with surprise.

Eliana didn't acknowledge the compliment, only remarking, "If you walk through the door like this, Mom will worry herself sick. I'd rather you stay at a hospital for a few days to recover. Does that sound reasonable to you?"

"Sure... if it keeps her from worrying, I'll go along with it," Sean said with an easy shrug.

"Then it's decided. I've numbed the pain for now, so let's head out while we can," Eliana said.

"Got it." Sean dipped his head in agreement and followed her from the room.

When they reached the bottom of the stairs, Doran stepped forward in a rush. "Already on your way?" he asked,eyebrows lifting.

"That's right." Eliana's eyes drifted toward the snug two-story cottage. "We've troubled you guys here long enough-it's time to clear out."

"Don't say that! Since you'll be looking after Mr. Elbert Pearson from now on, the doors here are always open to you," Doran said quickly, his tone full of welcome. Eliana's lips curved in a faint, private sneer.

They might be fine with it,but she was certain the woman she'd encountered earlier wasn't.

Besides, she'd never been one to impose on others.

Her tone left no room for argument. "Thank you for the kindness, but there's no need. When Mr. Pearson returns, please let him know l'Il visit his father when I have the chance."

Doran's anxiety mounted.

With Tristan still absent and Eliana preparing to leave, he had no idea how he'd explain this later.

He racked his brain, even weighing whether to stop Eliana and Sean by force, when footsteps echoed from outside.

Turning toward the sound, he caught sight of Tristan striding back. Since this place was near the police station, Tristan hadn't been gone long before returning.

"Leaving already?" Tristan asked, stepping into the room with sunlight spilling across his shoulders.

His tall frame closed the distance between them in a few long strides.

"He's fine now, so we won't impose any longer," Eliana said.

After a brief pause, she asked, "So, how did things turn out?"

"All of them have been detained and will face trial soon. The Fist Guild is finished," Tristan repled.

His speed in resolving the matter was nothing short of remarkable.

Eliana dipped her head slightly. "That's probably for the best. They won't be coming after you again."

Tristan inclined his head in agreement before adding, "Still, a few from the Fist Guild are unaccounted for.
You'd better keep your guard up for now and avoid unnecessary trouble."

"Thanks for the warning. We'll make sure to stay cautious," she assured him.

"It's not easy to catch a taxi out here. If you're okay with it, I can give you a ride," Tristan offered. She almost turned him down, but one glance at Sean's pale complexion-and the thought of nis pain returning-made refusal impossible. "In that case, we'll trouble you one last time," she said.

"No trouble at all. I'm heading back to the office anyway." His easy smile accompanied a casual gesture for them to follow.

They walked together toward the car, Tristan sliding into the front passenger seat while Eliana and Sean settled into the back.

The car eased out of Maples Villa, its tires whispering against the pavement.

Eliana lingered in silence before her curiosity slipped out. "Mr. Pearson, is it true you're about to get engaged?"

From the rearview mirror, Tristan's gaze met hers, his eyes cool yet edged with a hint of amusement."Seems you're not just a renowned doctor-you read minds too. It's true-my family arranged a marriage for me."


Family? So it wasn't by choice. That suited Eliana just fine.

She chose her words with care, her tone steady. "If there's already someone you care for, you shouldn't wait too long. A loveless marriage will only make both of you miserable."

Tristan's shoulders went rigid. How could she possibly know there was someone else in his heart? His gaze flicked toward Doran, who instantly shook his head in silent denial.

Turning back to the rearview mirror, Tristan's voice was even. "Do you want me to end the engagement?"

"Yes, absolutely," Eliana answered without hesitation-then caught herself. A faint, apologetic smile softened her tone. "I only mean that mutual affection should be the foundation of marriage. Without it,you're both just wasting precious years. Don't you agree?"

Tristan's mouth curved in faint agreement. "As it happens, I feel the same. I'd intended to end the engagement today, but the Fist Guild mess got in the way."

A spark of satisfaction lit in Eliana's chest. "If that's the case, there's no reason to waste another minute.I can deliver the news on your behalf."

He arched a brow, turning his head to study her. His gaze, dark and incisive, seemed to strip away every layer.

Eliana briefly questioned whether he knew she was Louis and Stella's daughter.

Instead, his voice came low and deliberate. "Do you have close ties with the Murray family?"

Her eyes flicked toward Sean. "If I didn't, I wouldn't have saved him."

Tristan's gaze sharpened. "What exactly is your connection to the Murray family?"

Eliana's lips curved faintly. "Are you trying to dig into my background?"

"Not at all-just curious," he replied with a small shake of his head.

"There's no need for curiosity," she said evenly. "I'll take care of calling off the engagement. You get what you want without wasting time. Isn't that simpler?"

The thought of visiting the Murray family had never appealed to Tristan.

After saving Sean today, he figured the Murray family owed him a favor and wouldn't take offense at breaking the engagement.

"In that case, I'll leave it in your hands: My thanks," he said at last.

"Happy to oblige," Eliana answered without hesitation, genuinely eager to see it done.
###Chapter 43 I Owe You My Life


The vehicle pulled into the front entrance of a hospital.

Thanks to Tristan's influence, the staff moved swiftly, clearing every obstacle until Sean was resting comfortably ina VIP suite.

A heavy workload waited for Tristan back at the office, so he didn't stay a second longer than necessary.

While the nurse adjusted the IV line, Eliana stood nearby, her gaze fixed on Sean. "You're staying here until those wounds close up. No disappearing, no wandering. And make sure you call home so Mom isn't left worrying herself sick. She's had enough stress already."

Her tone made it clear-this was about Stella, not him.

Sean caught on instantly. She hadn't stepped in to save him because of her care for him. It was for Stella's sake.

Though slightly disappointed, he forced a smile. "Still... thanks. If you hadn't shown up today, I might've lost my hand-or worse. My life's yours now."

Eliana's answer was cool. "I have no use foryour life. Just stop giving Mom reasons to lose sleep. That's all l want."


She turned as if the matter was closed.

"Lia-" Sean called after her.

She glanced back, a hint of impatience in her eyes."What now?"

"Back in the car, Tristan mentioned breaking off an engagement... Was he talking about that arrangement between you two?" Sean asked, his words halting midway.

Eliana answered with a simple nod. Sean studied her for a beat. "You're clearly not interested in marrying himn, but have you thought about what happens once people hear he called it off? Some might think twice before approaching you, let alone marrying you!"

A short, dry laugh escaped Eliana. "You think marriage is the only way forward? I'm doing perfectly fine without it."

"It's fine if you never marry," Sean said quickly. "We'll make sure you're taken care of. I just don't want to see you dragged through the mud by people who gossip for sport."

Her voice stayed even. "What people say isn't mine to control, and I'm not wasting energy caring about it. If that's all, I'm leaving."

He almost stopped her-wanting to point out that Tristan had handled things well today, that he was steady and dependable, that the Pearson name carried weight.

But the reminder of his own position made him bite his tongue.

In the end, all he could manage to say was, "Watch yourself on the way back."

Eliana offered no reply and slipped out of the hospital room without a backward glance.

Once in the hallway, she made a quick call, instructing several Onyx Syndicate members in Qidence to keep watch over Sean's room without drawing attention.

Tristan's warning echoed in her mind-several Fist Guild members had been missing during the raid and were still at large.

If they learned Sean had cost them their prized boxing manual, there was every chance they'd come for him again.

Until Stella regained her strength, Sean's safety was non-negotiable.

A taxi carried her back toward the Murrays' estate.

When it rolled to a stop, she spotted Stella standing in the doorway, worry etched across her face. Her plan to slip in quietly vanished. With no escape, she squared her shoulders and stepped out.

"Lia!" Carl reached her first, lowering his voice. "Mom nearly called the police when she realized you weren't home. Damon told her you'd checked in, so she calmed down. Don't let that happen again."

Eliana gave a slight nod before crossing over to Stella. "Mom..."

Stella pulled her in immediately, her hands running over Eliana's arms and shoulders as if checking for injuries. Only when she was satisfied did her grip loosen. "Where did you go? With Sean gone,I was worried he dragged you off somewhere again."

When Eliana was only three, Sean had once taken her out to play-and somehow managed to lose her.

Now, with both of them absent at the same time, that old panic from more than twenty years ago came rushing back to Stella.

Choosing not to bring Sean into the conversation, Eliana followed Carl's lead. "I went to meet someone.Damon and Carl already knew."

"Then why ignore my calls?" Stella asked.

Pulling her phone from her pocket, Eliana saw the screen was spiderwebbed with cracks, the device dead."It's broken."

Stella let out a breath of relief. "If you're safe, that's what matters. Forget the phone."

She turned to Carl. "Get her a new one." Then, taking Eliana by the arm and leading her toward the house,she asked, "Who did you see today?"

A quick answer formed in Eliana's mind. "Tristan."'

That brought Stella to a stop, her brows lifting. "You met with him? What did you talk about? How do you feel about him? And why didn't you tell me beforehand? I could've gone with you."

Faced with the flood of questions, Eliana decided not to hold back. "I went to his place-and ran into his girlfriend." Stella's eyes went wide. "His girlfriend?"

Clearly,Elbert had never shared that piece of information with her.

"Yes," Eliana said with a nod. "They looked genuinely happy together."

"Is that so?" Stella's tone shifted, her expression hard to read.

She had thought Tristan was the best choice to protect Eliana, yet learning he already had someone in his life threw all her plans into disarray.

"I told him straight," Eliana continued. "We can be friends, but marriage is off the table. He also asked me to pass along an apology to you."

For a long moment, Stella didn'trespond. Then she exhaled slowly. "If he already has a girlfriend, then we won't interfere...I truly didn't know. Had I known, I wouldn't have tried to push the two of you together."

"Well, now you do," Eliana said lightly.

Stella let out another sigh. "In that case, we'll drop it. I'll speak to his father and make sure it's settled.I'll find someone better for you."

Eliana jumped in before Stella could press further. "No, Mom. I really do want to stay here with you for a few more years. I can look after myself, and if I can't, well... I've got brothers, don't l? I'm sure they'll step in.Right,Carl?"

"Definitely!" Carl said without hesitation. "Mom, all of us will keep an eye on Lia."

Stella's eyes cut to him, sharp and unamused. "Keep an eye on her? Then explain how she,ended up going out alone. Lia might not be fully aware of our situation, but you do. Or are you pretending you don't?"

Carl gave an awkward laugh and scratched the back of his neck. "That won't happen again, I promise. Next time she leaves, I'll be stuck to her like glue."

Only then did Stella seem willing to let it go.
 
Inside the house, Ashley guided Stella upstairs to rest. Cart rolled forward and lovered his voice. "Lis, next time you step out,just tell us first. Don't start pulling stunts fike Sean."

" will.l understand. And.. sorry for making you all worry," Elana sald softly.

"Ht's fine-no need to apologize," Damon said in a low, reassuring tone. "What matters is you're safe. As for Sean,he's out of town handling somne business and will be back once it's settled."

Eliana's face remained composed,her only response a small nod of acknowledgment.

The door swung open, and Sawyer stepped in from outside.

After giving Eliana a quick nod of greeting, he turned to Damon. "Any word on Sean? Something big just happened"
###Chapter 44 Offering To Treat Damon


"We tracked Sean down," said Damon. "He's away from the city and hasn't run into trouble. But tell me-what do you mean 'something big happened'?"

Relief softened Sawyer's face before he answered, "Word just came in. The police rounded up everyone from the Fist Guild. The place is finished. Completely shut down."

"You're joking, right?" Damon and Carl blurted together, their disbelief hanging in the air.

"Where'd you hear that? Can you be sure?" Damon pressed,his voice steadier this time.

"It's confirmed," Sawyer replied. "I've checked. There's no mistake."

Damon fell silent for a beat, then asked, "Do you think Sean's name will come up?"

"Doesn't seem likely," Sawyer said. "He was only training there, never officially joined. And he kept clear of whatever dirty business they had going on."

Tension eased from Damon's face as he said, "Good thing Mom refused to et him sign up back then. If she had, he'd be caught up in this mess."

"I'll give him a call and tell him to come home," Sawyer suggested.

Eliana's voice cut in before he could move. "Sawyer, maybe it's smarter if Sean stays away for now. With things so tense, someone might decide to point fingers just because he spent time there at the Fist Guild."

Seated in his wheelchair, Damon spoke up. "She's right. Let him wait it out. If he's here,his temper might push him to defend the Fist Guild-and that's the last thing we need."

Sawyer gave a short nod. "Fair enough. I'll send him a message, tell him to lay low out of town until the dust clears."

That decision eased some of the weight in Eliana's chest. When dinner drew near, Stella's spirits had lifted slightly. Still, the newsabout the Fist Guild weighed on her,and worry clouded her eyes.

"He's out there all alone. I just hope he can look after himself," she murmured.

Eliana offered a gentle reassurance, saying, "He's an adult now and knows how to take care of himself.What matters most is that you focus on getting your strength back."

Stella's lips curved into a gentle smile. "Alright."

Once the meal was over, Carl and Sawyer each took an arm to help Damon up the stairs.

From the foot of the staircase, Eliana's eyes lingered on his slightly slouched figure, an ache forming in her chest.

A man that decent shouldn't have had his life altered by misfortune. It was his own kindness that had cost him the use of his legs.

To Eliana, fate had dealt a cruel hand-good people should never be the ones to bear such weight.

After bidding Stella good night and reminding her to take her medicine later, Eliana followed them up to the second floor.

Inside Damon's room, she stepped forward and said plainly, "If it's alright with you, l'd like to examine your Jegs."

Almost without thinking, he drew them back, his lips curling into a rueful smile. "I appreciate the thought,but it's pointless. Countless specialists have looked at them, and every one of them said the same thing-there's no cure. And after all these years, there's even less chance now."

In the days when the Murray family was thriving, Louis and Stella had chased down the best specialists for him.

Each visit had brought a flicker of hope, only for that hope to be crushed again and again.

After enough heartbreak, he stopped agreeing to see any doctor at all. To him, living without hope was easier than living with the crushing weight of disappointment.

Carl caught Eliana's eye and seemed to read her thoughts at once.

Stepping forward, he said, "Damon, I've seen what Lia can do with my own eyes. When you weren't home a few days ago, Mom collapsed after Leyla upset her, and Eliana brought her back around."

Sawyer added, "It's true. Mom's been looking healthier these past days, and she's been sleeping well.Damon, maybe you should let her try."

Still, Damon's head moved in a slow, stubborn shake.

He already knew the state Stella was in.

To him, fainting from anger wasn't some rare, complicated ailment-it was the kind of thing any half-decent doctor could hadle.

His hesitation toward Eliana wasn't about mistrust, It was the fear of dragging himself through another cycle of hope, only to end up crushed all over again.

So his tone was resolute when he said, "There's no point in pushing this. I've learned to live like this. Lia already has her hands full looking after Mom. If she had to care for me too, it would wear her down. We can wait until Mom's health is completely back before talking about anything else."

"Damon..." Carl's tone carried the start of another plea, but Eliana's quiet shake of the head stopped him cold.

When Damon was settled in bed, the three quietly stepped out of the room.

Sawyer, sensing Eliana might take the refusal personally, said, "Don't let it get to you. He trusts you. He just can't shoulder more pressure and disappointment right now."

"I know," she replied with a calm nod.

Night fell quickly.

Fresh from her shower, Eliana spotted a missed call from Leroy and immediately rang him back. The moment he answered, his voice carried urgency. "Hertha, I've got the information you wanted. Turns out Leyla mortgaged the Murrays' estate. Louis signed it over to her when she turned eighteen."

The news didn't shock Eliana, though one question still gnawed at her.

"If the property was already hers, and she sold it through proper channels, then why did the court foreclose on it?"she asked.

On the other end, Leroy explained, "She's been living off the Murray Group for years, even set up two subsidiaries under its name. When the Murray Group collapsed, her companies lost every order and went under too. The foreclosure came after that. And here's the kicker-she had enough to cover the shortfall but deliberately let it slide so the estate would be seized."

A sharp chill settled in Eliana's gaze. "So... she couldn't care less if the Murray family ended up on the street."

"People like her never lose sleep over anyone else's misfortune," Leroy said with quiet disdain.

A quiet hum was all Eliana gave in reply before Leoy continued, "There's more. She's got another business,this one under Hector's name. Since it doesn't rely on the Murray Group, it's been untouched."

"What kind of business are we talking about?" Eliana asked.

"It's a fashion design firm," Leroy answered.

"Alright. I know," she said, her tone almost offhand.

"If that's all, I'll let you get back to your evening," Leroy replied.

"Hold on. There's more I want to discuss, but it's not something to go over on the phone. If you're free tomorrow, let's sit down over a meal," Eliana suggested.

"Always free for you," Leroy replied without hesitation.

"Tomorrow at noon, then," Eliana replied without a second thought.

"Perfect. I'll handle the reservation and text you the address," Leroy answered. "Fine by me," she answered.

When the call ended, her eyes flicked to the clock-half past ten.

She rose from her seat, dug into her bag, and pulled out two small items before slipping quietly from the room.

The Murray household kept to an early schedule, so the entire place lay in silence at this hour.

Her steps carried her to Damon's door, and she eased the knob without making a sound.

The room lay in darkness, though the curtains stood open to let the moonlight in.

Bathed in the pale glow, Damon lay still on the bed, fast asleep.

Moving with care, she approached and set a scented candle aglow.
###Chapter 45 Neal's Face Was Ruined


A faint aroma drifted through the air from the candle Eliana had set alight. Its effect was gentle yet insidious,coaxing those already asleep into an even deeper rest that clung to them like heavy fog.

Anyone still awake, however, would feel nothing at all.

Once she had given the candle a moment to work, Eliana flicked on the room's lights.

"Damon?" Her voice held a careful edge, yet the figure on the bed remained motionless.

Loose silk pajama pants clung softly to Damon's legs. Kneeling beside him, Eliana pushed the fabric upward and began her examination.

His muscles had already started to lose their tone from long disuse, the beginnings of atrophy showing in the softened contours of his calves. Without timely treatment, he could never walk on his own again.

Fortunately, she didn't come into his life too late.

She reached for her medical kit, drawing out her acupuncture tools before beginning the delicate work.

Half an hour slipped by before she packed her instruments away, turned off the lights, and slipped quietly out of the room.

Morning came in what felt like the blink of an eye.

With her welcome-home banquet scheduled for the next day, all of Eliana's brothers except Damon were caught up in preparations.

Stella, on the other hand, took her to a beauty salon for some pampering.

Eliana's skin was naturally soft, but the facial left it even smoother, supple and radiant.

"Miss Murray, your complexion is flawless, and you're breathtaking! If you joined the entertainment industry,you'd be a star in no time," a beautician said, her eyes shining with admiration. The praise lit up Stella's face with pride.

"Get her a membership card. I'll bring her in for a facial every week," Stella instructed.

Eliana quickly stepped in. "Mom, you don't have to spend on this for mne. I'm not interested in such things.You should keep your money for what really matters."

Stella waved off her concern with a smile. "Don't worry, Lia. I can afford it." She gave the beautician a nod to go ahead with the registration.

Another staff member approached. "Mrs. Murray, your spa room is ready. Would you like to head in now?"

Turning to Eliana, Stella asked, "Why don't you join me for a treatment?"

Eliana's answer was immediate. She had never liked strangers touching her, and her head shook firmly. "I'll pass. You go enjoy it-it's good for your health. I'll wait outside."

Her refusa left no room for persuasion, and Stella relented. "Alright. Grab some coffee and relax while I'm inside. I won't be long."

"Okay," Eliana responded with a small nod.

Once Stella disappeared into the spa room, Eliana, with nothing else to occupy her, began to wander through the salon.

The beauty salon occupied an expansive three-story building, all polished glass and soft lighting.

Passing one of the treatment rooms, Eliana caught the sound of a voice she knew all too well.

It was Neal's voice.

Her steps froze, and she tilted her head toward the open gap in the doorway. "What do you mean there's no fix?" Neal's tone was sharp enough to cut glass. "My face was perfectly fine a few days ago! Now it looks like this-don't tell me it's not because of your products. How am I supposed to go out in public like this?"

Eliana eased the door open just enough to peek inside. Neal's once-smooth face was now a horror of swollen pustules, the skin inflamed and glistening with pus-like the mottled hide of a sick toad. One of the staff spoke in a measured, soothing tone. "Sir, please try to relax. We'll start with a tnorough rinse to clear the pus, then apply our ointment. You should see improvement quickly."

Neal let out a sharp breath but eventually leaned back into the chair, irritation still etched across his face.

It had been his looks that first caught Khloe's attention. If those looks were destroyed, there was no way he could hope to marry her.

That thought made his voice snap again. "Stop wasting time-fix it now!"

Just outside the door, Eliana's lips curved into a faint, knowing smile at the sound of his overbearing tone.

Neal's face hadn't been ruined by the salon's products at all-it was the work of the silver needle Eliana had flicked into him without notice.

The needle's tip carried a specially prepared toxin, one that would ensure his features never returned to their former glory.

Since his charm and livelihood had always hinged on his appearance, Eliana couldn't help but wonder what he'd become once that advantage was gone.

For Neal and Janessa, the Clarke family had been their shortcut to instant success.

To lose that dream right as it was within reach would cut deeper than death.

And yet,Eliana knew this was only the first act-she intended for them to endure much more.

With the door closed behind her, Eliana made her way back to the lounge to wait for Stella.

Day by day, Stella's health had improved. When she stepped out from her spa session, her cheeks were warm with color, and she looked almost indistinguishable from someone in perfect health.

They were just about to leave when an all-too-familiar figure crossed their path.

A slightly plump middle-aged woman, dripping in expensive fabrics and wearing her arrogance like perfume,sauntered over.

Her smile didn't quite reach her eyes as she addressed Stella, saying, "Mrs. Murray, I hear your husband still hasn't been released. And here you are, finding the time for a facial instead of trying to get him out.Your composure is truly remarkable."

The words carried the tone of a compliment, but the sting beneath them accused Stella of pampering herself while neglecting Louis's plight.

Stella's face cooled instantly, her expression hardening to stone. She had her reasons for not stepping in to rescue Louis, and none of them were anyone else's concern-least of all the woman standing before her,Addie White, Brenda's mother.

Before, their families were set to become in-laws. But after Damon's legs were crippled, the White family had begun to quietly distance themselves, offering subtle snubs while pretending nothing had changed.

Back then, they'd been careful, keeping their disdain behind closed doors.

Now that the Murray family had fallen into bankruptcy, Addie didn't bother to hide her contempt-mockery came easier than sympathy.

The realization sent a tremor through Stella's hands.

Eliana noticed and slipped her hand gently over Stella's, a quiet anchor that softened her expression just enough.

Turning her gaze on Addie, Stella's voice was calm but sharp as glass. "Mrs. White, it's been some time.trust you've been well? And Brenda, too? I do wonder, though... when the night is quiet, does she ever think about the man who lost the use of his legs saving her life?"

Color drained from Addie's face, her eyes skittering away. No rebuttal came. She gave a small cough instead. "We'll make inquiries about Mr. Murray's situation. But from here on, I'd appreciate it if you didn't bring up the past."

With a flick of her wrist, she signaled to a bodyguard, who immediately stepped forward and offered an invitation.

She extended the envelope toward Stella, her tone dripping with polite formality. "Brenda will be getting engaged soon. This is an invitation to the banquet. Mrs. Murray, if you still care about Mr. Murray's situation and wish for our family's support, please see that Damon receives this-and encourage him to attend."

It wasn't that she truly wanted Damon there. But if he failed to show up, tongues would wag about the White family's ingratitude.

His presence, however, would paint a very different picture-one of two families who had spoken, reached an understanding, and parted on amicable terms, with Damon personally offering Brenda his blessing.

That, more than anything, would silence the whispers.

After all, if the Murray family themselves showed no resentment, there would be no room left for gossip.
###Chapter 46 Don't Let Anything Slip


A beat later, Stella slapped the invitation from Addie's grasp, her eyes narrowing with contempt.

"You wvant Damon there just so your White family can parade around pretending you're not ungrateful," she said with a cold, mocking laugh. "Forget it. Everyone's going to see exactly what kind of people your family really are."

Addie's gaze sharpened into a challenge. "You might want to think twice. If Damon doesn't attend, your family will find itself cut off from every circle that matters. And as for when your husband can walk free again..." She let the pause hang, her voice dripping with veiled menace. "That could take a very long time."

But Stella didn't flinch. Not even a hint of doubt flickered across her face. "Our family's affairs are ours to handle-your White family doesn't need to meddle. You'd do better to mind your own steps. One wrong move, and trouble might find you."

With that warning, she swept out of the room.

Eliana lingered for a heartbeat before stooping to retrieve the discarded invitation.

Her lips curved into a pleasant smile as she turned to Addie. "Mrs. White, would you happen to have another invitation? I'd like to bring Damon along."

The White family had been keeping close tabs on the Murray family and knew they'd just reunited with their long-lost daughter.

"So, you're her lost daughter?" Addie ventured.

"That's right," Eliana replied with a steady nod.

Addie's gaze swept over Eliana, lingering with faint appraisal.

Her features were striking, a flawless echo of Stella's youthful beauty.

In a wealthy household, such looks could be an advantage-but in a family stripped of its fortune, beauty this dazzling could just as easily turn into a burden.

A practiced smile curved across Addie's lips as she said warmly, course, I'd be delighted if you came along with Damon."

At her signal, the bodyguard beside her stepped forward and promptly produced another invitation.

Eliana reached out to take it, her expression composed.

Looking entirely satisfied,Addie clasped her hand in a graceful grip. "Your mother has always been a remarkable woman," she said, her tone sweet but edged. "If only she weren't quite so stubborn. You, on the other hand, are sharper-more sensible. When I'm idle, I like playing matchmaker, and if you and Damon attend, I'll see that you meet a man truly worth your while. Your family's no longer as prosperous as it once was, so it's best to secure a good match early. Don't repeat your mother's mistake of sacrificing everything for pride."

Sliding both invitations into her bag, Eliana offered a faint, courteous smile. "I'm grateful for your insight."

Without another glance, she turned and strode out.

Addie's eyes followed her retreating figure, and with a slight tilt of her chin, she signafed to the bodyguard at her side.

The bodyguard leaned closer, and Addie's lips curved faintly as she asked, "Has Barry been hanging around Qidence lately?"

Barry White-Zach's wayward nephew-was infamous for his aimless days and reckless antics.

Years ago, Zach had lined up a respectable marriage for Barry, but just before the engagement, news broke that he'd gotten another woman pregnant. The wedding collapsed in disgrace.

These days, Barry's illegitimate son was already four, and no decent young woman wanted to marry a man with that kind of baggage, no matter how hard his family tried to salvage his reputation.

But after seeing Eliana today, Addie's mind sparked with a scheme. If Eliana ended up with Barry, outsiders would have no grounds to accuse them of ingratitude.
Even without tying the knot with Damon, she thought Barry's marriage to Eliana made little difference.

The bodyguard gave a curt nod. "Yes, he's here."

"Tell him to stay home and mind himself until the engagement banquet," Addie ordered,her tone clipped.

"Got it," the bodyguard replied with a firm nod.




Outside, Eliana hurried to catch up with Stella. "Mom, slow down... Please, don't work yourself up. Your health comes first."

Meeting her daughter's worried gaze, Stella's eyes brimmed with tears.

"Lia.." Her voice trembled with regret. "I never should have trusted Addie enough to introduce Damon to Brenda. If they'd never met, Brenda wouldn't have pushed him to take her horseback riding. Then his legs wouldn't have suffered any injury. I'm to blame. I'm completely to blame!"

Eliana guided her gently into the back seat, one hand steadying her arm, the other smoothing her coat."Mom, you have to stop punishing yourself. None of this is on you," she said softly, her tone warm yet firm."If anyone deserves the blame, it's the White family. They're ungrateful and small-minded-we gain nothing by sinking to their level. Right now, what matters most is your health. If you let that woman's spite make you ill, you're giving her exactly what she wants. We can't let those we love suffer while our enemies laugh."

Stella let out a shaky breath, each word from Eliana settling deep in her chest, easing the weight pressing on her heart. Her sobs finally quieted, and she clasped Eliana's hand with renewed strength. "You're right.I won't let them gloat over my misery. I'lI take care of myself and wait for your dad's release."

"That's the spirit." Eliana's lips curved in agreement, though a faint unease tugged at her.

Stella was handling the news of Louis being taken far too calmly for the woman she knew.
/
Eliana couldn't reconcile this composed, almost detached demeanor with Addie's portrayal of her-or with the wife who would have been frantic over her husband's fate.

Was it because their marriage had grown cold? Or was Stella hiding something deeper beneath that steady voice?

Eliana leaned toward the latter suspicion.

After a pause, she asked gently, "Mom, do you have any plan for dealing with Dad's situation? Or anyone you can reach out to for help? I can help you track them down."

Stella gave a faint shake of her head. "He's been wrongly accused. Once the truth comes out, they'll let him go. You don't need to worry about it."

Her answer felt evasive, lacking the weight of cerainty.

The more Eliana listened, the stronger her unease grew-convinced now that Stella was keeping something from her.

After they returned home, Stella slipped away to her bedroom.

She didn't lie down to rest-instead, she reached for her phone and dialed a number.

The call connected almost instantly, and a deep, steady male voice came through. "Stella, what's happened?"

Taking a moment to weigh her words, she asked softly, "Louis has been locked up for nearly a week now.How much longer until he's released?"

The man's tone remained unruffled. "If we stick to the original plan, at least two months. We've been using Louis and a few of our other men as bait to draw out those pests and wipe them out. Why the sudden concern? Something wrong at home?"

Hearing his even voice, Stella realized her emotions had gotten the better of her. She had been far too impulsive today.

She drew in a steadying breath before answering, her voice low. "It's nothing seriouIs... We just found Lia after all these years, and she hasn't seen Louis since she came home. I guess I'm feeling a little on edge."

"I get it," the man replied gently. "But this isn't something we can rush. One wrong move could wreck everything, and I'm sure you understand that." After a beat, his tone softened even more. "Still, don't worry-l've got people on the inside keeping an eye on him. He won't be mistreated. Just make sure you don't let anything slip. Not even your sons can know about this."

"I know," Stella murmured, her expression firm. "I've kept it from them from the very start."

"That's fine. I have other business to handle, so I'll end the call here. Tomorrow, my son will attend the welcome-home party and bring Lia a lavish gift-though he might not be able to make a formal appearance,"the man said.

"I understand. It's perfectly fine if he can't come," Stella replied warmly.

"It's not about convenience-it's my personal gesture," he said firmly.

Realizing she couldn't refuse without offending him, Stellagave a quiet nod of agreement.

Soon enough, the day of the welcome-home party arrived.
###Chapter 47 Welcome-home Party


The once-still halls of the Murray estate now buzzed with movement and chatter.

Many of the servants who had been dismissed in the family's darker days had returned of their own accord,a silent testament to how well they had once been treated in this household.

Even so, the bustle of activity didn't match the turnout-few actual guests had made an appearance.

Perhaps sensing the possibility of Eliana's spirits dipping, Damon, Sawyer, and Carl each stepped forward with gifts in hand.

From Damon came a striking painting-one he had purchased for a steep sum back before the Murray fortune crumbled. The massive piece, stretching three meters across, had once claimed pride of place on the wall of his bedroom, a sign of how much it meant to him.

Sawyer's offering wasn't of high monetary value, but its worth was in the hours of care behind it-a towering three-tier cake he had labored over through the night. Its beauty drew a low murmur of admiration from those who saw it. Every swirl of frosting and every delicate sugar detail spoke of the effort he had poured into it.

Carl's turn came with a promise fulfilled-he handed over the signed transfer contract for the plot of land he had pledged to her earlier.

Warmth bloomed quietly in Eliana's chest. Whether or not anyone else came today hardly mattered; solitude had been her companion for years. Still, there had been times when watching others reunite with loved ones had left her feeling a quiet ache.

Now, she stood among people she could call her own-and who claimed her as theirs.

The moment settled over her like sunlight-until Jordy burst through the doorway holding a small jewelry box. "This just arrived. The sender said it's from Sean."

Eliana's hand hovered, expression tightening, though she made no move to take it.
Carl,curiosity already getting the better of him, flipped the lid open. flipped the lid open. Inside lay a necklace, its centerpiece a flame-shaped pendant cut from rich red ruby, framed with glittering diamonds that caught the light in a sharp, dazzling blaze.

"That's stunning. Lia, it'd look incredible on you. Who'd have guessed Sean could be this... thoughtful?"Carl remarked.

Eliana didn't answer. Instead, she handed the matter off, asking Ashley to put away the gifts for safekeeping.

At that moment, Stella stepped forward with something of her own to present. It was unlike the others-a charity foundation dedicated to reuniting abducted children with their families.

Speaking softly, she told Eliana, "We created this three months after you disappeared. Your father and I wanted to give hope to parents searching for their children. Now, I'm placing it in your hands. It has fifty million in funding and a team of dozens ready to follow your lead."

The name on the contract caught Eliana off guard.

"Angel Children Foundation..."she murmured under her breath.

The name was one she knew well. Over the years, the organization had restored countless children to their families-some from households of great influence and means.

With this in her hands, she understood that if a day came when she needed help, those families would stand beside her.

t was clear Stella had thought far ahead, making sure Eliana would never face trouble without resources.

'Thank you, Mom.." The words came from a place deep in her heart.

Glad you like it," Stella replied, her smile warm and certain.

different image surfaced in Eliana's mind-Janessa, who had once used her and even sold her without a econd thought.

he villagers' old saying echoed in her memory, the one they repeated whenurging her to stay in the ountryside and marry Neal: "Life is the same, no matter who you're with."
 She knew now those words were a lie. Life could change entirely, depending on the hands that held you.

"Mrs. Murray..." Two guests stepped forward with polite smiles, saying, "We've already delivered our gifts,and since there are other matters we must attend to, we'll be taking our leave."

Nearly ah hour had crawled by, and aside from those two, the only people who remained were a handful of steadfast senior executives from the Murray Group.

They barely filled a single table, and the aif around them felt restless, uneasy.

The departing guests feared that the longer they stayed, the more they'd be lumped in with the Murray family-an association Qidence's high society would surely mock.

Both already regretted walking through the door.

Forcing her lips into a polite curve, Stellareplied, "I appreciate you making time in your busy schedules.If you have pressing business, please don't let me keep you."

"Of course. Goodbye." Relief flickered across their faces, and they turned to leave-only for movement at the entrance to halt them.

Everyone's eyes followed the movement until the figure stepped fully inside. It was Leyla, the very woman who had so publicly severed ties with them not long ago.

The two guests exchanged a quick glance, sensing the scent of scandal.

Everyone had heard the story-Leyla's dramatic break from the Murrays, Stella collapsing from anger, and Carl making sure the whole affair became public knowledge.

He had despised Leyla's betrayal and wanted the world to see her for what she was.

But even he hadn't expected her to show her face here.

The guests who had been ready to go now lingered, curiosity holding them in place.

"What are you doing here?" Stella's voice was cool, stripped of warmth.

Once,she had treated Leyla as if she were her own flesh and blood, lavishing her with affection That ended the day Leyla revealed herself to be ungrateful-and Stella had no desire to welcome her back.

Leyla strode in with an easy smile, her tone smooth. "I'm here for the welcome-home party."

Her gaze swept over the nearly empty hall, and the glint in her eyes carried more than a trace of satisfaction.

"You're not wanted here. Leave at once." Carl's tone cut through the air without hesitation.

"Carl, you're certain you want me gone?" Her finger swept toward the empty rows of chairs."With so few guests here, tossing me out will make this place feel like a tomb."

Eliana's tone stayed flat, her expression unchanging. "Noise levels don't concern you. Say what you actually came for."

Her reason for showing up had nothing to do with trading insults alone.

Closing the distance to Stella, she cut straight in. "When I turned eighteen, Dad gifted me the estate and signed it into my name. I'm here to take back what's mine."

Stella's eyes narrowed to slits before she snapped, "You cut all ties with the family. This estate has no connection to you anymore."

A low laugh slid from Leyla's lips. "You don't get to decide that. Dad legally transferred it to me with a contract. If you'd rather avoid a court battle, bring me the deed now. If not, I'll win it back through legal means."

"YOU-"Stella was about to lash out.

Eliana stepped forward, placing herself in front of Stella. "The transfer happened, yes. But you mortgaged the property to the court, and we bought it back. That makes it ours now. Even if you appeal, the ruling won't change."

Her composure faltered, and she shot Eliana a look as sharp as glass. How could she possibly know about the mortgage? The thought dug into her.

The shock was written plainly on Damon, Sawyer, and Carl's faces. Carl spoke up first, "So the reason those people came to claim the estate was because you pawned it off to the court? Leyla, how could you be so cold? Do you even realize that without Eliana, we'd be left to live on the street?"
 ###Chapter 48 Leyla's Shamelessness


Leyla's eyes swept over the Murrays, her expression as cold as glass. "So Eliana actually managed to reclaim the estate?"

How the hell could some country bumpkin pull off something like that? If she truly had that kind of influence,the city's high-born nobles wouldn't have skipped her so-called welcome party.

The more Leyla thought about it, the more convinced she was that the Clarke family had surely lent a'hand-especially since Eliana had gotten lucky that day, stumbling into Miguel's good graces after curing him by chance.

Even caught in the open, Leyla didn't flinch.

She let out a faint, dismissive laugh. "Whether you'll live in the street or beg in the gutter, why should I give a damn? I gave you your shot, remember? But you threw it away and pushed things between us past the breaking point. And now you've got the nerve to act like I should feel bad?"

Truth be told, she'd never cared much for the estate. Her own home suited her just fine.

But the day before, Hector had offhandedly mentioned a client with eyes on the property-and that was reason enough for her to swoop in and stake a claim on his behalf.

If not for that, she wouldn't have bothered tangling herself up with the Murrays again.

Remembering why she'd come, Leyla fixed them with an icy look. "I'm only here today'because of our history. If you'd shown a little courtesy, I might have let you keep some small cabin to live in. But clearly,that's unnecessary. When Dad promised me the property, I recorded it. With that proof, I can take it back entirely."

The Murrays turned ashen the moment they heard it.

"Leyla, how on earth can you be this shameless?!" Carl barked, his voice shaking with fury. Eliana let out a sharp, derisive scoff, inwardly marveling at Leyla's sheer ignorance of the law.Did she really believe that waving around a flimsy recording would be enough to seize the property? Gifts could be rescinded-had she truly never grasped such a basic principle? The thought was downright ridiculous.

Then again, perhaps Leyla did know better. Perhaps she simply assumed the Murray family,weakened as they were, would be easy prey, and that she could toss the law aside for a brazen, daylight grab.

Eliana was just parting her lips to speak when a deep, resonant voice rolled in from the doorway."Leyla Murray,your shamelessness is truly something to behold."

Eliana's gaze snapped in the direction of the sound, and her breath caught at the sight of a familiar,'striking face.

The man stood tall in a black shirt and perfectly tailored trousers, every movement steeped in the elegance of a nobleman. His features were cut with the precision of a sculptor's hand-handsome enough to steal attention in any room-yet it was the glacial sharpness in his gaze that commanded silence.

It was none other than Tristan.

For some reason,Eliana couldn't bring herself to look him in the eye.

Maybe it was the guilt of having deliberately concealed her identity from him that day.

But now she recognized the inevitable-there was no keeping it in the shadows.

Her head turned instinctively, as if avoiding his eyes could erase the truth. She prayed Tristan hadn't caught the flicker of recognition.

"Mr. Pearson?" Leyla's voice faltered, her composure slipping at the sight of him.

She hadn't expected him here of all places. The Murray family's fall from grace had been devastating, their welcome-home party for Eliana so sparsely attended. Why would someone of his elite position show up at a place like this?

In his presence, Leyla dared not be reckless. She forced a brittle smile, choosing her words with care. "Mr.Pearson, this is a private Murray family matter. Are you sure you want to get involved?" "Family matter?" His deep voice carried a razor's edge. "Excellent. Because the Murray family's matters are mine as well. Are you seriously unaware that l've been engaged to their little daughter all this time?"

Leyla's eyes flew wide as she blurted out, "What did you just say?"

She stood frozen, unable to fathom it. Surely she would have known something like this.

Sensing that Tristan was stepping in ontheir behalf, Stella wasted no time clarifying."Long before Tristan and Lia were even born, Mrs. Pearson and I made an agreement-that our children would marry once they were grown."

Leyla's complexion drained of color, disbelief tightening her features.

She couldn't fathom what she'd just heard. Not once had anyone breathed a word of this to her.

Had she known, there's no way the engagement would have ended up in Eliana's hands-a girl she dismissed as nothing more than a backwoods nobody.

With Eliana gone all those years, Leyla had stepped neatly into her place, confident it was hers to keep.

Now she saw it for what it was-Stella had deliberately kept her in the dark.

The people who claimed to have done so much for her had been quietly saving the real prize for Eliana all along. No wonder Eliana had the audacity to pose as a famed healer when Miguel's life hung by a thread.She hadn't been acting on sheer nerve-she'd been relying on the shield of her engagement to Tristan.

With everything clicking into place, Leyla realized she was in a tight spot.

For all her pride and education, she couldn't ignore the truth. The Murray family had reclaimed the estate by lawful means.

Even so, she had tried to take advantage of their current weakness to forcefully seize it.

But with Tristan now openly backing the Murray family, she could no longer make such a blatant grab without exposing herself.

Leyla's face stayed rigid, her voiceclipped with restrained irritation.. Pearson, since you've spoken, I'll honor your words.They can keep the estate."

Sawyer's jaw tightened as he countered sharply, "Keep it? The estate has always belonged to us!"

"That's right!" Carl shot back, his tone rising. "It might have been yours once, but you pawned it off to the court. From that moment, it stopped being yours entirely. Where do you get the gall to act like you're granting it to us?"

Leyla's glare swept over them, her chest tight with indignation, convinced she was staring at a pack of ungrateful parasites.

When she got back to Hector, she resolved to ask him to personally step in and wrest the property back on her behalf.

Drawing in a slow breath, she forced a breezy smile. "Why are you two nitpicking over every word? You're not novelists-must you be so exact? Fine, I take back what I said about letting you keep it. Happy now? No need to blow it out of proportion."

Her careless tone made Sawyer and Carl flush with rage, and their reddened faces gave her a flicker of satisfaction.

She turned to leave, already plotting a different way to reclaim the property once she came back.

But before she could take another step, a deep, weathered voice called from the doorway, laced with disdain. "Is this the woman you mean to marry?"

Leyla's back went rigid at the sound of the voice, its familiarity cutting through her like a blade.

She whipped her head around and found Miguel staring at her, eyes steeped in contempt.

Beyond him, the entire Clarke family-everyone but Khloe-stood in a tidy row at the doorway.

Even Hector, who had so often been her ally, now wore a grim frown.

"Hector.." she began, her tone edged with unease, ready to justify herself.

He strode forward, his face darkening, and spoke in a low, biting voice. "Just look at the mess you've made!" Her throat tightened with bitterness. "I was only doing it for you... You said yesterday that you had a client..."

"Shut up!" Hector cut her off through clenched teeth. "Even if I wanted this property, this isn't how to get it.I told you to see if they'd sell it tome, not storm in and try to seize it."

After all, if the client caught wind that the estate was taken by force, they'd surely back away from the deal.

Leyla's breath caught at his rebuke, panic flashing in her eyes. "I didn't realize at the time... but, Hector,everything I did was for you.."

"Hector! What are you wasting words on her for? Get over here, now!" Jeffry's voice rang out, sharp with command.

He had never harbored much fondness for Leyla-though that stemmed mostly from the bitter, long-standing feud between the Clarke and Murray families.

When it came to Leyla, he had nothing significant against her.

But after seeing her shamelessness laid bare today, there was no way he would ever permit someone like her to marry into the Clarke family.
###Chapter 49 The Questions Were Answered All At Once


Hector couldn't deny his feelings for Leyla, and knowing she had acted with him in mind, he found it hard to be harsh with her.

However, since his family was all angry with her now, he leaned in close to murmur, "Go on home," before turning his back to rejoin them.

Left standing alone, Leyla refused to let the Murrays see even a flicker of defeat in her. Her chin lifted, her grievances swallowed, and she strode away without looking back.

In her mind, it wasn't only her dignity that had been bruised-she was certain the Murray family had been equally shamed.

After all, they had thrown an extravagant welcome-home banquet, complete with a towering champagne display, yet the turnout had been pitiful.

Soon enough, she was convinced, the high society would be snickering at the Murrays behind closed doors.

Part of her wanted to linger by the entrance, clinging to the hope of running into Sean.

Instead, Jordy's voice cut through her thoughts. "Aren't you leaving?"

She shot him a sharp glare. "Whether I go or stay is none of your business-you're just a servant. Know your place!"

His face didn't so much as twitch as he responded, "You're right. I'm just a servant. But you seem to have forgotten-you're no longer part of the Murray family. That gives me the right to show you the door."

"You-" The word snapped from her lips, but the thought of creating more trouble for herself, especially with the Clarke family inside, kept her from saying more. She stalked off with a glare instead.

Back inside the hall, Miguel made his way to Stella and Eliana, bowing low in gratitude.

Stella quickly reached out to steady him. "Mr. Clarke, please, there's no need for such formality." Miguel shook his head. "There is every need. Without your daughter,I'd already be nothing more than ashes in an urn."

The words made Tristan's gaze snap sharply toward Eliana.

Recognition hit him instantly-she was Stella's daughter.

The questions that had clouded his mind-why she would risk her life storming into the Fist Guild gym for Sean,how she had known about his engagement to Miss Murray-were answered all at once.

He understood now that her goal was for him to be the one to end their engagement on her behalf.

Feeling the weight of Tristan's stare, Eliana shifted slightly, avoiding his eyes. "Mr. Clarke, there's no need for such formality..," she said softly.

Stella, oblivious to Eliana's unease, turned her attention to their guest. With visitors arriving, joy lit her expression. "How are you feeling these days, Mr. Clarke?" she asked warmly.

"I'm doing much better. Not long ago, I couldn't even manage daily tasks, but now I'm attending a banquet,"Miguel replied with a faint smile.

"We're honored you came in person. Please, have a seat," Stella said with genuine sincerity.

"Of course," Miguel nodded and settled into a chair.

Turning next to Tristan, Stella added, "Mr. Pearson, please sit as well."

Tristan's nod came with a look toward Eliana-brief, pointed, and unreadable-before he moved past her to sit.

The two guests who had been on the verge of leaving quickly reconsidered. Seeing such influential figures seated at the table, they hurried to join them.

Sharing a table with such influential company sent a thrill through them, erasing any trace of earlier disappointment.

It didn't take long for word to spread-both the Clarke and Pearson families had shown up at the Murray banquet.

Within an hour, the once nearly empty banquet hall had swelled with people, many of whom hadn't even been invited.

The commotion reached the White family soon enough.

Addie's brow furrowed. "The Clarke family? Weren't they always on bad terms with the Murray family? Why would they show up now-especially when the Murrays have fallen?"

Zach's eyes narrowed. "Forget the Clarke family. The real question is-why is Tristan there?"

That was the point worth worrying over-how Tristan truly viewed the Murrays

In Qidence, his name alone carried enough weight to shift the balance in any circle.

Silence hung between them until Zach's eyes drifted toward Brenda, who sat quietly on the sofa. "Brenda."

Her head lifted in mild surprise.

"I want you to take two gifts and pay the Murray family a visit," Zach said evenly.

Brenda's eyes went wide."Dad, have you lost it? I'm about to get engaged to Cullen, and you want me walking into the Murrays' place now?"

With a frown, Zach said, "This isn't about doing favors forthe Murray family. It's about Tristan. The Pearson Group's expansion this year is centered in Qidence, and we can't afford not to establish a link with him."

Earlier in the year, Zach had spent months shuttling between Qidence and Eighvale, searching for a way into the Pearson family's circle.

At one point, he had even put himself on the line, stepping in to help a woman against the Onyx Syndicate,hoping she would open the door to Tristan.

All that effort had gone nowhere-the woman still hadn't introduced them-and in the end, he'd returned to Qidence empty-handed.

Now, to his irritation, the Murrays-whom they had deliberately kept at arm's length-were already in 
Tristan's orbit.

Fixing Brenda with a steady look, he added, "When you're there, make sure Tristan notices you.If you can't manage that, at least figure out exactly where he stands with the Murrays."

Brenda let out a sharp laugh. "So if Tristan's close to the Murray family, you expect me to what? Dump Cullen and run back to that cripple? Forget it! That's never happening. I couldn't stand Darnon even before-dense as a stone, that one. You shoved me into that relationship, and now that he's stuck in a wheelchair,I wouldn't go near him if my life depended on it."

Zach's expression darkened instantly. "Who said anything about you getting back with him? I'm telling you to gather information and get Tristan to notice you. What nonsense are you spouting? And is that any way to speak to me?"

Turning her,head sharply, Brenda snapped,"I'm not going. If you want to play matchmaker, you do it yourself."

She knew exactly what the Murray family thought of her.

Walking into their banquet would be like stepping straight into a wall of mockery.

Brenda wasn't the kind to swallow her pride, and she had no intenion of subjecting herself to that humiliation.

Zach's voice dropped to a cold threat. "Not going? Okay. From today on, you won't be leaving this house.Forget about your engagement banquet with Cullen too."

Truthfully, Cullen had never been his ideal choice.

The only reason Zach had allowed the engagement was to prevent the Murray family from pushing Damon onto her.

Brenda's eyes widened, disbelief written all over her face. "You're threatening me now?"

"I-" Zach started to retort.

Before tempers could flare any further, Addie stepped in, taking Zach by the arm. "Honey, don't work yourself up. You know what the doctor said about your blood pressure."

Turning to Brenda, Addie said firmly, "Brenda, say sorry to your father."

Neither Zach nor Brenda budged, both turning their heads away in silent defiance.

A thought suddenly lit inAddie's mind, and she spoke again. "Honey, maybe this isn't the right time for Brenda to show her face at the Murray family's banquet. Why don't we send Barry instead?"

Zach's brows pulled together. "Barry? Why are you bringing him into this?"

Leaning in close,Addie murmured something in Zach's ear. Slowly, the tension in his face eased.

"So you're thinking we set Barry up with that Murray daughter who just came back from the countryside?"

Addie said with a faint smile, "That's exactly it. If the Murrays really are tight with the Pearsons, we can't keep avoiding them. But if Barry marries their daughter, the whole situation flips in our favor."

Zach rubbed his chin, his voice losing some of its bite. "What if she's not interested in him?"

Barry's name had been dragged through the mud more than once.

Addie replied, "She's just a girl from the countryside. She probably doesn't know better. And with the Murrays losing influence, Barry's still a solid prospect for her. When I spoke with her the other day, she struck me as the type who'd jump at the chance to marry into money-naive and eager."
###Chapter 50 Irritation With Eliana


Addie brought up her recent run-in with Eliana at the beauty salon.

Zach's brow arched. "You're telling me she didn't turn you down when you offered to help her find a match?"

"Not at all," Addie said, her tone carrying a hint of amusement. "She seemed pleased, even kept it from Stella, and told me she'd bring Damon to Brenda's engagement banquet. I'd say she's dazzled by the city's shine... Shame for her that the Murray Group collapsed right before she came back."

The irritation on Zach's face eased, though doubt lingered in his voice. "You really think Barry-picky as he is-would go for a woman from the countryside? He's not exactly the type to take orders from us."

With a confident smile, Addie said, "You haven't seen her, Zach. She's even more stunning than Stella was in her youth. And you know the Murrays-beauty runs in the family."

Zach said decisively, "Then quit wasting time. Call Barry and tell him to visit the Murray family today."

After a pause, he added, "And make sure he brings something with him. No showing up empty-handed."

That sealed it-he was on board with Addie's plan to pair Eliana with Barry.

Addie's eyes lit with satisfaction as she reached for her phone.

Across the room, Brenda had been watching quietly. She stood, expressionless, and started for the stairs.

Zach's voice stopped her halfway. "Have you truly thought it through-marrying Cullen?"

Her gaze turned cold as she looked back. "Why wouldn't l? He's a perfect fit. Graduated from a top university. Only twenty-eight and already a mid-level manager at a Fortune 500 company. I respect a man who climbs on his own, not one like Damon who survives on his family's name."

Zach's lips curled into a sneer. "Mid-level manager? Don't kid yourself. Without my help, he'd still be a nobody working for the White Group." And it was true-without Zach's help, Cullen Reid would still be another nameless employee at the White Group.

Brenda, however, had no interest in hearing it. In her eyes, Cullen was charming, humorous, and never afraid to put in the effort to keep her happy-everything Damon was not. Damon, in her mind, was the awkward type who couldn't string together a complete sentence when they first met.

Truthfully, she had once felt a flicker of gratitude toward Damon.

If not for him, she would have been trampled under a horse's hooves that day.

That gratitude soured the moment she slipped by to visit himin secret and caught sight of his reality-needing assistance just to get to the bathroom. From then on, whatever warmth she'd felt dissolved.

When whispers began about her being ungrateful, she foundherself wishing Damon would simply disappear for good.

One thing was certain-she could marry anyone but him. She refused to chain her future to a man in a wheelchair.

Cullen's bank account might not stretch far, and his yearly salary couldn't even buy her a high-end car.

That hardly mattered to Brenda. Her family's fortune meant she would never go without.

What she lacked was love, not money. If Cullen could give her that, she wouldn't care if she married into a family of average means.

Zach studied the stubborn set of her face and let out a weary sigh. "If that's your choice, then go ahead.Just don't come to me later with regrets."

Without answering, Brenda turned on her heel and climbed the stairs, not sparing him a glance.

In her mind, there was no doubt-she could regret marrying Cullen, but marrying the crippled Damon would be a lifetime sentence. Inside the Murrays' estate, Jordy was darting from one end of the hall to the other.

The crowd kept growing, and the stock of drinks they'd bought earlier was nearly gone, forcing him to place a rushed order for more.

Oddly enough, the busier he became, the broader his grin grew.

He remembered Leyla refusing to leave earlier, her eyes sharp with the hope of watching the Murrays embarrass themselves.

That hope had been crushed-no one dared mock them now.

Eliana, on the other hand, found the crowd exhausting.

Surrounded by eager young women, she was trapped in small talk she had no interest in entertaining.

At first, she kept her composure, listening politely. But as the chatter drifted far from her, the Murrays, or even lighthearted topics like handbags and fine jewelry, and began circling solely around Tristan, her patience thinned.

"Eliana, how exactly do you know Mr. Pearson? When did you first meet him?" one of them asked without warning.

The question didn't catch her off guard.

It wasn't hard to guess that these wealthy socialites had no genuine interest in her, someone they dismissed as a country outsider, especially now that the Murray name had lost its shine.

They weren't here to get to know her; their target was clear.

With that clear in her mind, Eliana kept her face unreadable and said, "We've only just met. I barely know him."

The women picked up on her cool tone, and a flicker of discomfort passed between them.

Once, the Murray family had commanded their full attention.

But because of her family's fallen social standing, Eliana meant nothing to them now. Still, their reason for being here outweighed their irritation, so they pushed down their pride and forced their smiles to stay in place.

Not two minutes passed before another couldn't hold back and circled the conversation right back to Tristan. "Eliana, what kind of things does Tristan enjoy? Does he have anything he usually does for fun?"

wouldn't know," she said simply.

If anything, she probably knew even less about him than they did.

Her honesty was met with silent skepticism.

Since Tristan had shown up in person at her welcome-home banquet, they refused to believe she didn't know him well. In their minds, she was simply keeping him to herself, afraid one of them might try to take him.

They sneered inwardly, convinced that even if he turned every single one of them down, he would never be interested in Eliana.

Pretty or not, she was still, in their eyes, a bumpkin.

Before arriving, they had already done their homework, digging up the fact that Eliana had once been engaged back when she was still living in the countryside.

That made themall the more certain she was being brazen, daring enough to keep quiet about anything involving Tristan.

"Eliana..." One of them held out a bracelet toward her.

She didn't accept it. A faint crease formed on her brow as she asked,"What are you trying to do?"

The young lady's smile didn't waver. "Picked this up at an auction for three million. Looks like it was made for you. Take it, and maybe you can tell us what Tristan's into."

Eliana responded, "I've already told you, I don't know. If you're that curious, you can go ask him yourself.He's right there." The women traded sharp glances, their irritation with her building to the edge.

One finally snapped, saying, "Don't tell me you actually think Mr. Pearson showed up at your welcome-horne banquet because he's interested in you."

With someone leading the charge, another one chimed in, "You should be grateful we're even talking to you.Try showing a little respect."

"That's right! You're just some woman from the countryside. Do you really believe you could marry into a famly like his? Stop fooling yourself," another voice added.

Eliana's gaze swept over them, cold and unflinching. "Not everyone spends their days swooning over Tristan like you do."

The bluntness left them speechless. Before any could recover, she said, "I'm going to the bathroom. Have a lovely evening."

Without another look back, she walked away.

If not for the fact that she now bore the Murray name, and that this banquet had been arranged by Stella in her honor, Eliana wouldn't have spared them a single word.

The mood had already soured, so she saw no reason to keep up appearances.

A sudden longing for her friends from the Onyx Syndicate caught her off guard

Still, she reminded herself the separation wouldn't last.

Earlier that day, Carl had handed her the factory, and by tomorrow, the Onyx Syndicate would be starting its move to Qidence.

As she slipped into the night, she planned to tell Seth the news straightaway.

She never noticed the quiet footsteps trailing behind her.
 ###Chapter 51 Attempting To Stealing His Fiancée


Laughter, chatter, and the clinking of glasses filled every corner of the villa, and no matter how far Eliana walked, the noise followed her like a stubborn shadow. Only when the hum of voices dimmed did she slip her phone from her pocket and dial Seth.

"The transfer we talked about can get underway tomorrow," she said.

Seth was delighted. "That place is massive. Even if you just leased it, you'd rake in a fortune. Are you telling me Carl really handed it over to you?"

"He did," replied Eliana.

"Sounds like the Murray family's treating you better than I expected," Seth answered.

She didn't deny it. Aside from Sean's occasional outbursts, the rest of the family had shown her genuine kindness-none more so than Stella.

Time spent with Stella had given her a taste of something she'd never known before-maternal warmth, the kind that felt like stumbling upon a hidden treasure.

Eliana's light sleeping habits meant she noticed the quiet moments, like Stella gently tucking her in at night.\

For someone who had grown up without a mother's care, that simple act felt like something rare and priceless.

Over the line, Seth said, "If they're good to you, do you want me to dig into who set your father up? We could find out the truth."

Back when Eliana's identity as the Murray daughter was revealed, Seth had already run a surface check.
/
The truth had been clear-Louis had been set up-but he hadn't pushed deeper. because she hadn't given the word.

She hesitated, then replied, "Let's hold off for now." From the way Stella had reacted, there was more to the matter than it seemed.

The Onyx Syndicate already had eyes on them, and probing into Louis's case would only invite trouble Besides, she had a strong feeling Louis might have walked into it on purpose. That made rash moves dangerous.

"Got it," Seth replied. He took her caution for mistrust toward the Murray family and left it there. "I'll get things lined up so the transfer starts first thing tomorrow."

"Alright. They're going to have a rough time settling in, so see to it that everyone gets a good reward tonight from me," Eliana instructed.

"Understood!"

Once the call ended, her eyes lifted to the lone morning star gleaming like a jewel in the dark sky.

She decided to linger under the night for a while, anything to postpone crossing paths with the so-called elite waiting inside.

The silence lasted only a few seconds before a strange tension crept into her senses. Someone unfamiliar was drawing near.

Her brows knit together, yet she kept her gaze fixed on the heavens, pretending nothing had changed.

A short distance away, Barry advanced with cautious steps.

He hadn't wanted to set foot in the Murray estate. In his mind, marrying a girl from the countryside was unthinkable.

But Zach's orders weren't something he could ignore, not when he still owed both Zach and Addie enough to sink him for life. His pride could wait.

That resolve cracked the moment he saw Eliana.

Even among the parade of beautiful women in the Murray halls, Eliana drew every eye without effort.

One look, and Barry was captivated. When she slipped outside alone, he cut short his conversation with another guest and trailed after her.

Believing she had no idea he was behind her, he closed in and reached to pull her into his arms.

Before his hand could reach her, Eliana caught him and flipped him over her shoulder, slamming him hard onto the floor.

Pain clenched his jaw as he tried to push himself up, only to feel a knife press against his throat the very next moment.

"Tell me, who the hell are you?" Eliana demanded.

Pain and humiliation flared in Barry, but when he looked up, the sight of her face bathed in moonlight stole the heat from his anger.

For extraordinary beauty like this, he thought, maybe she could be forgiven for putting him on the ground.

A quick, eager smile spread across his face. "Hey now, no need to get the wrong idea. I'm not some creep..."

"Talk. Who are you? Because if you don't, I might just forget to keep this knife steady." Eliana cut in, her voice low and dangerous.

Barry was hooked. The beauty alone was enough to turn heads, but it was the confidence in her posture,the edge in her tone-she was unlike any woman he'd ever crossed paths with. And he wanted her.

"I'm your fiancé. Name's Barry. You can call me that," he said without a hint of shame.

"Fiancé?" Eliana found it amusing. "That's interesting. Considering I wasn't aware I'd ágreed to marry anyone named Barry."

If anything, she already had two names tied to her in that regard-Tristan and Neal. This stranger certainly wasn't either of them.

Trying to keep his eyes off the knife, Barry quickly said, "I'm Barry White. My uncle and his wife sent me here,told me you were going to be my bride." Eliana asked disdainfully, "And who exactly are they?"

"My uncle is Zach White. I'm guessing they've told you about me?" Barry asked, his voice careful but probing.

"Zach White?" Eliana's brows lifted, a glint of mockery flashing in her eyes. "So his wife works fast-already arranging me a future husband."

A flicker of excitement lit Barry's face. "Then Addie has spoken to you about me. How about putting that knife down? I'm really your future fiancé..."

Noticing the knife still in her grip, he quickly added, "Listen, if you marry me, I'll make sure you're taken care of. Anything you want, it's yours. And your father-since he's been taken in-we've got the power to pull some strings and get him released."

Eliana almost laughed outright. She was seconds from calling Jordy to drag Barry out when a rich, smooth voice cut through the night. "Seems the title of Ms. Murray's fiancé is in high demand tonight..."

Both she and Barry turned toward the sound-and were met with a vision framed in moonlight.

The man stood tall in a fitted black suit, a faint, unreadable smile on his lips.

But his eyes, dark and unyielding, were locked on Barry with a chill sharp enough to bite.

It was none other than Tristan.

Barry's mouth went dry, his eyes going wide. "M-Mr. Pearson..."

A slight tilt of Tristan's head was all it took. Rocco and Doran mnoved in, each gripping a shoúlder and forcing Barry down until his knees slammed the ground.

Pain shot up Barry's legs, dragging a hiss from his throat, but he swallowed it quickly, replacing it with a forced, toothy smile. "Mr. Pearson, what's going on? I don't understand... I haven't done anything wrong."

Tristan stepped forward, his gaze unwavering. "No, you haven't-unless you count attempting to steal my fiancée." "Y-your fiancée?" Barry blurted, whipping around to stare at Eliana as if the words themselves were absurd.A country-raised girl like her-Tristan's fiancée? No way. If that were true, why would Addie be arranging his marriage to Eliana? And the Pearsons? With their standards, they'd never welcome the disgraced Murray family,let alone replace the well-bred Leyla with someone who'd grown up far from privilege.

"Mr. Pearson, there's got to be a mistake here. Ms. Murray is about to get engaged to me.."
###Chapter 52 Aren't You Forgetting To Explain Something


Barry had barely closed his mouth when Tristan's eyes turned cold as ice.

Doran traded a knowing smirk with Rocco.

Neither of them thought Barry had the nerve to go head-to-head with Tristan over Eliana.

"It looks like your ears aren't working too well," Tristan remarked coldly.

Before Barry could respond, Doran, standing at his right, swung his hand in a quick arc and landed a crisp slap across his cheek.

The sound cracked, and Barry's ear rang so hard it felt like it might burst.

Stepping forward with deceptive calm, Tristan asked, "Does that help your hearing any?"

"I... I..." Barry stammered, his eyes darting to Eliana as though she might save him.

Her lips pressed tight, and the insult in her gaze was unmistakable.

"Kindly escort this fool out of here," she told Doran and Rocco, turning away.

"Gladly!" Doran answered. He didn't bother waiting for Rocco, grabbing Barry by the collar and hauling him toward the manor gates.

"Get your hands off me!" Barry squirmed against his grip.

Without warning, Doran's hand shot out and struck the back of Barry's neck, knocking him unconscious.

The air went still again.

Sensing Tristan wanted a private word with Eliana, Rocco quickened his pace to help Doran haul the unconscious body away.

Once they reached the gates, Doran asked,where's the drop-off point for him?" Rocco's gaze swept over Barry with open disgust. "Send him back to wherever he crawled from. Wno does he think hecompeting with Mr.Pearson?"

"1' rough him upfirst, then dump him at the White family's doorstepDoran replied with a short nod.

"Make sure the beating happens far from Ms. Murray's property," Rocco warned. "Her home shouldn't be tainted by this trash."




Eliana still couldn't bring herself to meet Tristan's eyes.

She cleared her throat awkwardly and muttered,"Thanks for stepping in,"then made for the villa.

Their shoulders nearly brushed when Tristan's hand caught her wrist."Ms. Murray, aren't you forgetting to explain something?"

The sudden grip left Eliana with no choice but to turn toward him.

The moonlight painted his features in silver, making him look even sharper.than he had in daylight.

Still, she wasn't admiring him. She was looking for a way out. A pang of regret hit her for lying earlier. Being caught in it now made her stomach twist. She cleared her throat once more and said, "You already figured out my identity, right? Is there something else you need to hear?"

"Was hiding who you are just a way to trick me into ending our engagement?" Tristan asked.

Eliana's brows drew together. "Trick you into backing out? You were ready to call it off yourself."

Tristan froze for a split second before blurting out, "I had no idea you were the one promised to me since young."

The remark made her lips twitch in faint amusement. With a sharp tug, she freed her hand from his hold. Her voice turned cold. "So what? If you'd known it was me, would that have changed anything? Don't forget your girlfriend waiting for you at your place. Or has she slipped your mind already?"

Tristan was taken aback."What girlfriend?" Her contempt only deepened. It seemed every man really was the same, cold and heartless.

Without softening, she fixed her gaze on him. "Do you enjoy pretending you don't have a girlfriend, or is that just second nature by now?"

Tristan's confusion only seemed to grow. "I'm not pretending. I really don't have a girlfriend."

"You-" Eliana's voice faltered, ready to turn sharp.

Before she could finish, Carl's voice rang out from across the lawn. "Lia? Is that really you?"

Eliana stopped mid-sentence and lifted a hand to signal him.

A moment later, Carl closed the gap, a grin on his face. "We've been searching all over. Mom's ready to make the formal introductions..."

Only when he caught his breath did Carl notice the figure standing a step behind her.

Tristan's black suit blended so well with the evening shadows that Carl had nearly missed him. There was something about the man's presence that seemed to pull the air tighter.

Recognition flickered in Carl's eyes. "Mr. Pearson, didn't expect to see you out here."

Tristan's gaze shifted toward Eliana, and he replied, "I stepped out for air and took a wrong turn. Luckily,your sister happened to find me."

He made a point of stressing the words "your sister" when he spoke.

Her shoulders tensed, and she quickly turned to Carl.Mom looking for me?"

"That's right. Nearly everyone's here, and shę's ready to present you," replied Carl.

"Then let's head back," she told him.

Carl agreed with a short nod before turning to Tristan. "Mr. Pearson, come along. We'll lead you there."

Tristan gave a faint nod and trailed after them into the main house.

Sawyer was the first to cross their path. "Lia, there you are. We've been searching everywhere. Where did you Tun off to?"

"Just needed a breath of fresh air. It was getting stifling inside," Eliana answered.

"Feeling any better now?" Sawyer's voice held genuine concern.

"Yes." She gave a brief nod.

"That's good to hear. You'd better go see Mom," Sawyer told her.

Without so much as a glance toward Tristan, she moved off toward Stella.

The two men followved close behind.

Sawyer caught sight of Tristan walking in with them, Leaning closer to Carl, he kept his tone low."Mind telling me why Mr. Pearson was tagging along with you two?"

Carl replied, "He got lost. It's not like this place is a maze, but he still wandered off. Guess a good sense of direction isn't part of that big-shot reputation of his."

"Lost?" Sawyer's brow knit as suspicion flickered in his eyes. He turned his head almost by instinct.

By chance, Tristan was already looking back. Their eyes met, and a subtle weight settled over the air.

Sawyer forced a strained smile and offered a short nod.

Tristan answered with a quiet one of his own.

Looking away, Sawyer couldn't shake the thought that a man like Tristan shouldn't be the type to get turned around so easily.

But with the evening still unfolding, he pushed the thought to the back of his mind.

Not far from them, Stella exchanged a few quiet words with Eliana before guiding her toward the center of the hall.

A raised platform waited, a microphone gleaming under the lights. Stella stepped forward, greeting the guests with a few warm words before her tone softened. °This is my daughter, Eliana. When she was only three, I lost her...

Her voice wavered, emotion catching in her throat.

Eliana rested a gentle hand on her back. Stella drew in a steady breath, smiling faintly before continuing,"But fortune smiled on me, and I was given the chance to find her again. I've dreamed of hosting this welcome-home banquet for so many years, and now that dream is finally real. Lia, from this day on, we will never be apart again."

With a warm smile, Eliana answered,"Yes.We'll stay together forever."

The room filled with applause.

While some offered genuine congratulations, most cast curious glances toward Tristan.

When they saw him clapping, they quickly joined in, the sound swelling as though each wanted to outdo the others.

Soon,the banquet drew to a close, and Tristan made his way toward Stella.
###Chapter 53 It's Better To Give Us Time


Since Stella was still regaining her strength, the duty of escorting guests out fell to Carl and Sawyer.

As the guest of honor, Eliana found herself swept into the stream of farewells whether she liked it or not.

While the bustle carried on, Tristan stepped toward Stella.

The sight of the tall, refined man brought a quiet warmth to her expression. There had been a time when they might have become family, but that path had closed long ago. She admired him still, though she had no intention of meddling in the life he had now.

"I have a feeling I know what's on your mind. If you have a moment, why don't we sit down and talk?" Stella suggested.

The evening's pace had left her feeling slightly unsteady; she needed to take a seat and get some rest.

Tristan offered no protest, and together they walked to the lounge on the first floor.

When she reached for the coffee pot, he was already stepping in."A∥low me."

With smooth, practiced movements, he filled her cup first before tending to his own, the faint steam curling upward between them.

The small act stirred a hint of regret in her. Men with that kind of grace and consideration were rare in their world. Louis had spoken highly of Tristan after meeting him only once, and now she understood why. Still,some things were left to chance, and his heart was clearly promised elsewhere.

"Have some coffee. Watch out-it's hot,"Tristan said, his tone warm but careful.

"Ah, yes." The words pulled Stella from her thoughts, and she offered him a gentle smile."We've had so many visitors today. I'm sorry if our reception fell short."

"You've been nothing but gracious. I'm the one who arrived without notice. If anyone should apologize, it's me." It struck Stella then that she had never actually sent him an invitation. She'd meant to, but after hearing from Eliana that he was already seeing someone, she had decided against it.

"When Lia brought it up earlier, I felt it was a shame. I'll speak to your father myself.Since you and Eliana clearly weren't meant to be, I see no point in forcing it. We can let the engagement go and keep our families close in other ways."

The words carried the quiet assurance that Stella had no objection to breaking things off.

Tristan's brows tightened ever so slightly.

"I'm curious... What exactly did she say to you?" He gave a short pause before adding, "I tend to be vague without realizing it, so maybe she read me wrong."

Read him wrong? Stella faltered for a moment, then said, "Lia told me you already had a girlfriend. That you couldn't agree to this marriage, and she was just passing along your refusal."

"Girlfriend?" The word seemed to catch Tristan off guard. "I'm not seeing anyone. Work has been taking up all mytime, so I haven't even thought about it."

Her eyes grew wide with surprise. "No one at all? But Lia swore you had someone you truly cared for-"

"Then she must have misunderstood."

"Well..." A spark of hope flashed in Stella's gaze. "So you're telling me.:. there's no one?"

He gave a single, firm nod. "That's right. No one."

Her eyes brightened all over again. Still, she knew better than to assume his being unattached meant he'd agree to marry. Eliana.

Choosing her words with care, she said,"Your mother and I were close. We even carried you both at the same time, which is why we arranged this match in the first place."	/

Tristan nodded in response.

Eighvale had been Stella's home for most of her life before she married Louis, and her bond with Joanne Pearson, Tristan's mother, went back to the days when they ran through its streets as inseparable girls.

Fate,however,had played its tricks. Tristan had been placed in the wrong family at birth, and by the time he was restored to his own, Joanne was already gone.

Though the memories never belonged to him, his father had once told him about the friendship between Stella and Joanne.

Something about the way she carried herself stirred an odd flicker of familiarity in him.

"But," said Stella as she steered the talk elsewhere, "I've never been one to control my children's lives. Love should be a choice you youngsters make for yourself."

Her gaze held steady while she continued, "You know what our family's going through. That scandal tied to Sheldon Torres has made us easy prey for gossip. I only spoke to your father about the engagement because | wanted to protect Lia. You know her background. She grew up far from us, surviving hardships out in the countryside. I can take whatever's thrown at me, but I can't watch her get dragged down with me.I figured if you were there beside her, no one would dare touch her."

Stella's eyes reddened as she spoke.

Tristan reached over and passed her a tissue.

With a small, thankful smile, Stella took it. "I let my emotions get the.better of me. You probably thinkI'm being foolish."

Tristan shook his head with quiet certainty."What I see is how deeply you care for Eliana. I've never had the chance to feel what a mother's loveis like."

Her hand stopped mid-motion as she dabbed at her tears. Silence lingered before she said softly,"YOU mother was an extraordinary woman. If she'd known you were her son from the start, she would have moved heaven and earth to keep you from suffering."

Tristan nodded. "I believe that. A woman without compassion wouldn't have allowed a child born outside her marriage to live in peace. If she hadn't been kind, I might not even be standing here." Tears shimmered in Stella's reddened eyes as she murmured, "Her compassion saved her own child...I believe she can rest easy now, knowing the man you've become."

A faint smile tugged at Tristan's mouth. "I believe so too."

Long before he knew the truth about his birth, he had crossed paths with Joanne. Back then, in her eyes.he was only the unwanted child of another woman yet she had never treated him with malice. On rare occasions, she had even extended a kindness he wasn't expecting.

In his mind, she remained one of the rarest sorts of people-good through and through.

Regret lingered that they had never been mother and son in life.

A quiet heaviness settled between them.

Breaking it with a small smile, Stella said, "You camne to tell me about calling off the engagement, didn't you?It's alright. I won't bring it up again, and I'Il speak to your father myself. Thinking I could use your happiness as a shield for Lia...that was selfish of me."

"Not at all." Tristan sat up straighter, his voice firm. "I've met Eliana enough times to know... she's remarkable."

Her expression froze, disbelief flickering in her eyes. "Are you serious? This isn't just something you're saying to comfort me?"

"I mean every word. But I'd rather keep the engagement off the table for now. She doesn't return my feelings, and I think it's better to give us time. If we push the idea now, I'm afraid she'll only distance herself further."

Stella nodded eagerly."Alright. We'll leave it be for now."

"Still, I promise you this. Engagement or not, I'll look out for her. No one will lay a hand on her without answering to me."

She was just opening her mouth to thank him when the door creaked open.
 ###Chapter 54| Really Don't Have A Girlfriend


The door eased open, and standing there was Eliana herself.

Her white gown caught the light, its soft shimmer giving her the delicate beauty of a white rose in full bloom.Yet beneath that elegance lurked a sharpness that warned against getting too close.

Even Tristan wouldn't dare get too close to someone like her, not when one glance could cut him to the bone.

"Lia, come over here," Stella called out, beckoning her closer.

"Mom..." Eliana stepped forward, her eyes sliding warily toward Tristan before shifting to Stella. "Ashley told me you were feeling tired and went upstairs to rest, but when I checked, you weren't there... I didn't expect to find you here instead."

With an easy smile, Stella tugged her down beside her. "Tristan's mother and I were very close. Since it's not often we run into each other, we decided to catch up."

"You can catch up anytime," said Eliana, her smile polite but thin."Still, you've had a long day. You should be resting upstairs."

A faint ache in Stella's lower back reminded her that Eliana was right.

Satisfied that she'd said all she needed, she nodded. "Alright, I'll head up now. See Tristan out for me later,will you?"

"Of course," Eliana replied.

Once Ashley arrived to escort Stella away, the pleasant curve of Eliana's lips disappeared.

Her eyes fixed on Tristan, her voice level. "What exactly did you two talk about?"

Tristan's fingers idly rotated the coffee cup in his hand. "Nothing important-just setting the record straight on a few things." "What exactly?" she asked, her tone pressing for detail.

His eyes met hers with a deliberate steadiness. "Some misunderstandings. Between you and me.

Elíana continued to ask, "And what misunderstandings would those be?"

"Well, for starters... the idea that I already have a girlfriend," Tristan said evenly.

Eliana's brow knit in displeasure. "You do have a girlfriend, so what's there to misinterpret? I'm well aware you only came near me to help with your father's injury. Don't worry-I gave my word, and I won't take it back. But I'd appreciate it if you stopped feeding my mother stories."

Tristan tilted his head slightly. "What stories did I supposedly tell?"

"How should I know every word you said?" she retorted.

"If you don't know, then what makes you so sure I said anything untrue to your mom?" Tristan asked, his tone calm.

"You-" The word slipped out, but she quickly clamped down, reminding herself it wasn't worth sparring with him.

A slow breath steadied her before she asked, "Forget everything else-did you mention the Fist Guild incident to my mom?"

Tristan raised an eyebrow lightly. "Now that you've brought it up, I realize I haven't told her yet. Maybe I should let her know how her daughter took on the entire Fist Guild members alone. That way, she won't lose sleep worrying about you."

The moment he rose from his seat, she felt a spike of panic.

Her hand shot out to grab his sleeve, but the pull came too strong.Fabric slid under her grip, nearly yanking half his jacket off. A button popped from the black shirt beneath, revealing the lean line of his collarbone.

Frozen, she released him at once. "I... didn't mean to do that."

Tristan's gaze held no trace of anger-only a slow, knowing smile. "We may have an engagement arranged back when we were children but there's really no need to rush. Some things are better when the timing is right, wouldn't you agree?"

What was he even talking about? Eliana could barely process the absurdity of his words.

A shadow crossed her face as she said, "I already said it wasn't intentional. Now put your jacket back on."

The thought of anyone walking in and seeing them like this made her stomach knot.

Tristan, on the other hand, seemed entirely unbothered.

"One of my shirt buttons just came off," he remarked casually.

"So?" Eiana asked.

"So you're going to sew it back on. Otherwise, if someone catches a glimpse, my good name will be ruined,"Tristan replied without a hint of shame.

Grinding her teeth, Eliana demanded, "What 'good name' are you even worried about?"

"My standing as a respectable, unattached man," Tristan answered seriously.

Her hands curled into fists as she forced herself to stay calm. "Fine. Just stay here. I'll go get Ashley," she said at last.

"You can't. If she hears about it, that so-called good name of mine will be finished anyway," Tristan replied.

"She isn't the type to gossip. And besides, nothing happened between us. There's no risk of a misunderstanding," Eliana reassured him.

"Are you truly certain you're not worried about mjsunderstandings?" He leaned back slightly, eyes fixed on her.

Something in his look made her feel he was quietly scheming.

Still, she held his gaze and said evenly,"Absolutely certain."

"Fine then, forget the sewing. I'll just head straight to your mom and share how fearlessly you handled yourself, so she never needs to worry about anyone pushing you around again," Tristan said with a slow nod.

A jolt of alarm shot through Eliana. "You can't tell her anything! Not a word about the Fist Guild,and definitely not about Sean's injury."

"Oh?" Tristan raised an eyebrow.

"I suppose I can keep that a secret

but ony if you do something for me in return. Seems fair, doesn't it?"

Forcing her voice to stay even, she asked, "What is it you want me to do?"

"Nothing complicated," Tristan replied. "The Pearson Group is holding a charity exhibition in a few days.
There'll be several famous paintings on display, and I need someone to attend with me."

Her brows knit together. "You mean you want me to go as your date?"

"Well, look at that. You have beauty and brains. You're spot on," Tristan replied.

A small step closed the distance between them. "By the way, can I call you Eliana?"

The request was ordinary, but when he spoke her name,the warmth in his voice unsettled her.

Her skin even prickled with goosebumps. "You'd better stick with Ms. Murray!"

Tristan's lips curved slightly. "Strange, I'm starting to think 'Eliana' has a nice ring to it."

It became painfully clear to her that in a battle of words, he was far too skilled.

So she let the fight drop altogether.

She simply said, "Call me whatever you want! But if you expect me to go with you to this exhibition, what about your supposed girlfriend? Shouldn't she be the one on your arm? Or are you not worried she'll be furious?"

Tristan's expression stayed calm. "I don't have a girlfriend, so there's nothing to fear."

Her brows drew together. "Afraid to admit it? What happens when she hears you denying her existence-do you think she'll just smile and let it slide?"

Tristan was utterly confused. "Who exactly told you l have one?"

"She did," Eliana replied matter-of-factly.

"And who is this mysterious 'she'?" Tristan pressed.

"Your girlfriend," she answered without blinking.

"Like | said, I don't have a girlfriend..." Tristan realized that they were going in circles.

A hand dragged across his forehead before he muttered, "Whoever planted that idea in your head was wrong. It's nothing but gossip. I've never been involved with anyone."

Her eyes narrowed on him. "You almost sound proud of that."

"Shouldn't a spotless reputation be worth some pride?" Tristan retorted smoothly.

"Fine,whatever. I'll go. But you have to keep your mouth shut around my mom. Her health isn't that good,and the last thing she needs is bad news. That means nothing about Sean, and nothing about the Fist Guild," she said firmly.

Tristan replied earnestly, "If you show up as promised, you have my word-not a single word will escape me."

"Good. I'll agree, but make sure you set things straight with your girlfriend. I don't need drama, and I won't stand for being accused of something I didn't do," Eliana warned.

"I've said it before, and I'll say it again-I really don't have a girlfriend," Tristan remarked with a sigh
###Chapter 55 Wasn't Eliana The Woman He Had Been Searching For


Eliana had no intention of dragging out the pointless debate over Tristan's alleged girlfriend, so she moved to end things. "It's getting late. You're a busy man-you should be on your way."

"I'm hot in a hurry," Tristan replied smoothly."My coffee's not finished yet."

Her knuckles tightened as she fought the urge to punch his smug face. "Then finish it quickly," she said through cenched teeth.

Every extra second with him felt like testing the limits of her own patience-and her restraint.

Back when they first met, she hadn't pegged him as this shameless. Somehow, each meeting only seemed to strip away more of his restraint. Perhaps that explained why he and Jermaine were brothers-they were cut from the same irritating cloth.

At least Jermaine spoke like a normal person before pulling something indecent. Tristan's style was different -he kept his actions clean while making his words unbearable.

Either way, she had no fondness for either man.

With deliberate leisure, Tristan shrugged into his jacket, then settled back into his seat as if the evening belonged to him.

A single sip touched his lips before he set the cup back down.

He then said casually, "That reminds me. I forgot to ask-did you happen to visit the Glory Hotel in Eighvale about a year ago?"

The words came with a gaze that pinned her in place, watching for even the faintest flicker of reaction.

Her brows drew together. "A year ago? What's this about?"

"Just answer me, or I might make this coffee last all night," Tristan said. Biting back her irritation, she replied evenly,"1go there often. I like the hot springs there. Hot springs are good for recovery, especially for someone who trains physically. WNhy does it matter?"

Her voice stayed steady, and her face revealed nothing-no guilt,no nerves.

Even after admitting she'd been to the hotel, her answer didn't seem to satisfy him.

Maybe too much time had passed, and she had let the memory fade? Still, that felt unlikely.

For something like that, Tristan believed a girl would carry the memory for the rest of her life.

He certainly did. That day still found its way into his dreams more often than he cared to admit.

The haze of the moment had kept her face hidden, but the feeling it left behind had never slipped away.

Maybe he'd þeen wrong all along, and Eliana wasn't the woman he had been searching for.

The idea stirred a mess of emotions inside him.

That mysterious girl had burned herself into his memory, yet meeting Eliana had pulled him toward her in a way he couldn't quite explain.

A quiet part of him wanted her to be the same person. And his instincts insisted she was.

Refusing to let the matter drop, he asked again, "When you visited, did anything... out of the ordinary happen?"

Her brows knit in confusion."Out of the ordinary? What exactly are you asking?"

"Anything at all," Tristan said lightly. "Just making conversation."

Whatever patience she had left snapped. Her hand shot out, grabbing his coffee cup and tipping it onto the tray with a sharp clink. "Nothing unusual or strange. But you are certainly a strange one. Planning to make yourself at home here forever?"

Before he could answer, his phone buzzed on the table. Rocco's name flashed on the screen. He didn't usually call unless something was wrong. Tristan answered, cutting in before his friend could speak. "I'll be there shortly."

The call ended as he rose to his feet and he said to Eliana, "Apologies for barging in today. Don't forget our arrangement.I'4l send a car for you when the exhibition comes around."

Without waiting for her reply, he turned and walked out.

As Tristan's figure vanished through the coffee room door, Eliana exhaled a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding.

Turning away from the table, she left the room and made her way upstairs to check on Stella.

After a full day of activity, Stella would need acupuncture to help ease her tension.

Meanwhile, downstairs, Sawyer had just finished seeing the last guests out and was heading toward the stairs for a long, hot shower when Tristan's tall frame appeared in the hallway.

An involuntary twitch pulled at Sawyer's eyelid as he stepped forward. "Mr. Pearson, you're still around?"

Tristan's mouth curved intoa faint smile. "Had a little talk with Eliana, that's all."

While speaking, his fingers drifted casually to his collar.

The small gesture drew Sawyer's eyes-and that was when he noticed the black shirt missing a button.

For someone of Tristan's stature, showing up to a formal banquet with a shirt in that state seemed unlikely unless the damage had happened tonight.

The thought sent Sawyer's gaze upward justin time to catch Eliana hurrying up the stairs.

An assumption formed almost instantly, and it wasn't a modest one. He didn't expect her to be so forward.

Still, with his entire family fond of Tristan, Sawyer found himself thinking it wouldn't be such a bad match.

"Hey, Sawyer?" Tristan's voice cut into his thoughts.

The sound jolted Sawyer back to the present. Composure sliding back into place, he replied with a polite smile, "What can I do for you, Mr.Pearson?" "I was thinking," Tristan said with a faint smirk, "we're the same age and move in the same circ'es0drop the formalities? Call me Tristan, and I'll call you Sawyer."

"Well..."Sawyer hesitated, uncertain If that was wise.

Even at their strongest, the Murray family hadn't reached the Pearson family's level of influence.

And now, with the Murrays facing hardship, the gap felt wider than ever.

After all, plenty of people would consider it an honor to call Tristan by his name.

Tristan didn't give Sawer the option to refuse. His hand came down in a light pat on Sawyer's shoulder."You've had a long day-go get some rest. I've got a few things to take care of, soI'll be heading out.P'stop by again sometime."

Without waiting for a reply, he crossed the hall in long, confident strides.

Thoughts spun quickly through Sawyer's head.

They had only met a handful of times, and though they weren't friends, he had learned enough to know Tristan's nature.

Friendliness for the sake of small talk wasn't Tristan's style.

Sawyer couldn't shake the thought that-Tristan's friendliness might have more to do with Eliana than with him.

His mind jumped back to the banquet, remembering how Tristan had reappeared from outside with Eliana by his side-Carl claiming they'd gotten lost.

Yet tonight, Tristan left without a single mention.of losing his way. That alone told Sawyer the man knew exactly where he was going.

Pieces that once felt scattered now fit together neatly./

The idea settled in Sawyer's mind: the Murray family could be preparing for a wedding soon.

But the thought of his father still sitting in a prison cell stole the shine from that vision. Would Louis even get the chance to watch Eliana walk down the aisle?

Two days slipped by before he had time to dwell on it further.

During that time, Leyla busied herself with outings among her closest friends-afternoons at the spa,lunches at fashionable cafés-hoping to catch whispers of gossip about the Murray family.

She expected to hear snickers about a lavish banquet that barely drew any guests.

But the silence on the matter stretched on for two full days.

Eventually,she could no longer keep up the act.

At lunch, she let out a sigh that sounded almost unplanned.

Two elegantly dressed women across the table immediately glanced her way.

"Leyla, what's the matter?" one asked.

Her head tilted as Leyla gave a faint smile tinged with bitterness."O, nothing... I'm just feeling low."

"And why's that?" the other asked.

With another breath, Leyla let her voice soften. "It's because of the Murray family. They threw me out for Eliana's sake, but even after all that, I never felt hatred toward them. They raised me, after all, and I'll always be grateful for that."
  ###Chapter 56 Looked Like A Fool


Leyla let out a faint, pitiful sob, dabbing at eyes that were perfectly dry before continuing,"When I learned they were hosting a welcome-home banquet for Eliana, I went out of my way to warn them. With their situation right now, I said no one would bother showing up. But they ignored me completely and still threw an extravagant event just for her. Now, I'm sure everyone is laughing behind their backs."

Her gaze dropped, as though weighed down by worry.

The silence that followed dragged on far too long.

When she finally glanced up, both women across the table were staring at her with parted lips, their expressions caught somewhere between shock and hesitation.

A flicker of unease twisted in her chest until Leyla finally asked, "What's going on?"

One of them let out a half-smile. "If that's what's bothering you, Leyla, you can stop worrying."

"Stop worrying? What are you talking about?" Her brows knit in confusion.

Another friend of Leyla jumped in, her tone almost amused. "Because two nights ago, that banquet was nothing like you described. It wasn't empty-not even close. The place was overflowing. Anyone who showed up late had to stand because every seat was taken."

Leyla's eyes went wide, the disbelief sharp in her voice. "That's impossible!"

Catching herself, she quickly softened her tone, smoothing her expression. "If you're only saying that to make me feel better, there's no need. Everyone knows the Murray family's fall from grace is the talk of the city..."
·/
"It's the truth," the first girl said firmly. "I'm not trying to soothe your ego. It realy is true. Practically every prominent family in Qidence showed up to their banquet."

The color drained from Leyla's face. It was unthinkable-the Murray family hadn't become a public embarrassment at all.Which meant the only person who looked like a fool now.., was her.

The other girl leaned in and said, "I was dragged there too, thanks to my family insisting I meet i is an. Bur Eliana? That bitch wouldn't even bother to introduce us, let alone share what he likes."

Her tone carried a sharp edge, thick with contempt for Eliana.

In their eyes, a woman like Eliana was beneath them. She was expected to lower her head, speak plainly, and never dare to compete with them for Tristan's attention.

Those words jolted Leyla, stirring the memory that both the Clarke family and Tristan had visited the Murray estate that day.

The realization hit her hard. Once those two names were on the guest list, what wealthy family would dare stay away? Even if it was nothing more than a performance, they would still have to show their faces for the sake of prestige.

It suddenly became clear why no one had dared to sneer at the Murray family's banquet these past two days.Damn it! How did she not foresee this?

Leyla's lips pressed into a thin line, a flicker of cold calculation flashing in her eyes

Meanwhile,the two girls kept badmouthing Eliana, completely missing the change in Leyla's mood.

Before long, the focus of the conversation turned back to Leyla.

The spark came when one of them mentioned the upcoming charity exhibition hosted by the Pearson Group.

"Leyla, you're incredible with oil paints. Didn't Davin Gordon himself praise your work? Word is he's going to be there. Since you're acquainted with him, could you hook us up with invitations?"

Another girl jumped at the chance, saying,"|fyou manage to get one, grab another for me,'alright?"

"Same here. I'd love to go, but my family didn't get an invite," the first girl added.

The immediate urge to decline rose inside her. Truthfully, she had only met Davin once.

Her win in that oil painting competition had given her the chance to speak with him, but the paio she'r been praised for wasn't even hers-it was a perfect copy of Carl's work.

Her talent lay in copying, not in creating something from her own mind.

Whenever an oil painting competition came around, she would slip into Carl's room in search of "inspiration."

Carl might have lacked brilliance in most areas, but his talent for oilpainting was undeniable, though it remained a secret to almost everyone.

"I...I've been swamped lately, so I won't be able to makeit," she said, offering a flimsy excuse.

Deep down, she knew Davin would never hand her an invitation, much less several for her friends.

One of the girls urged, "Busy or not, you have to be there. There's going to be an oil painting contest at the exhibition. Leyla, if you enter, you could take the championship. They say the prize is huge. You really can't miss it."

Leyla's lips curved into a faint smile that didn't reach her eyes.

Since cutting ties with the Murray family, she no longer had the chance to slip into Carl's studio for "inspiration".

Without those borrowed ideas, stepping into that competition would leave her floundering with nothing to present.

The moment that happened, every whisper about Leyla's so-called talent would turn into a confirmed truth -she was a fraud.

Resolving to avoid the risk, she shook her head and said, "I'm swamped right now. Otherwise, I'd be there without a doubt."

The two girls looked disappointed."What a shame," said one girl, clearly disappointed.

Refusing to back down, the other spoke again. "If you won't compete, at least try to get us invitations You've been kind enough to forgive the Murray family, so doing us this little favor should be nothing for you"

"I'll see if I can," said Leyla, keeping her tone vague. "But whether you get them or not depends on whether Mr.Gordon has extras."

"That's fine. As long as you try, we won't hold it against you if it doesn't work out." Both girls nodded in agreement.

Despite their words, Leyla could already sense the distance they would put between themselves and her if she failed.

Without the Murray name behind her, she knew she would be treated like no one.

Her smile tightened further, feeling heavier than before.

Finishing her meal in haste, she grabbed her keys and headed straight for Hector's villa.

Inside, the place felt hollow,the only sound coming from a maid methodically tidying the room.

"Has Hector been here today?" she asked, a trace of hope in her voice.

The maid paused briefly before answering, "No. No one's been by."

Disappointment flickered in Leyla's eyes, dulling their brightness.

Ever since they parted ways at the Murray estate, Hector had neither visited nor returned her calls.

A chilling thought gnawed at her-was he planning to cut her off completely? She found herself pacing in front of the tall window, her steps quickand restless.

With her ties to the Murray family severed, the safety net she once had was gone. If Hector turned away from her now, she would be left with nothing.

Halfway through another anxious turn,Leyla froze. Doing nothing would only let the distance grow. Hector's feelings for her might still exist, but without contact,they could fade like smoke. She needed to close that gap before it vanished.

Snatching her phone from the table, Leyla dialed a number she knew belonged to one of Hector's men.

The call was answered almost instantly. "Hello, Ms. Murray?"

"Where's Hector right now?" Leyla asked without preamble.

"I'm sorry, I can't give you that information," the subordinate replied.

"Then don't," Leyla said coolly. "But when Hector and I mnake up, the first thing I'll do is tell him to replace you."

The blatant threat made the subordinate relent. "He is at the Clarke estate, though he'll be leaving soon. If you plan to see him, you might want to wait until he's done."

"Where's he headed?" Leyla asked curtly.

"To the Pearson Group's charity exhibition," the subordinate answered without hesitation.

"I understand," Leyla murmured before ending the call.

There was only one conclusion left-she would have to be at that exhibition.
 ###Chapter 57 How Dare You Hit Me


Leyla couldn't wait any longer. She had to see Hector. With so many women admiring him, a few days apar felt dangerous. What if his feelings shifted?

Without wasting time, she found Davin's number, cleared her throat, and dialed.

The call connected swiftly, and a low, weathered voice came through, "Hello, who is this?"

"Hello, this is Leyla Murray," She introduced herself quickly.

Davin might not have saved her number, but he remembered her."Oh,I remember you-the young lady who won the oil painting competition."

Leyla blinked in mild surprise."Yes, that's me. You still remnember me?"

"Of course. Your piece was very creative, blending elements from different countries into one canvas. I still recall it clearly.So,what can I do for you?"

Leyla got straight to the point, asking if he could get her an invitation.

Davin said. "I'd planned to take two students with me, but they're heading abroad for an exhibition.Since you're interested, I'll give you the extra invitations."

Leyla's face lit up. "I really appreciate it! I can come to your place right away."

"Alright, I'll text you my address and wait for you. By the way, there's a competition at this éxhibition. It'd be great if you could take part," he added.

Leyla's smile faltered. Original works had never been her strength-her imagination just wasn't enough. But she knew if she refused, Davin might not hand over the invitations at all. So she swallowed her reluctance and agreed.

But instead of heading to Davin's immediately, Leyla made a detour to the Murray estate. Luckily, Eliana wasn't home to meddle-only Damon and Carl were there.

Stella had gone with Sawyer to thank Miguel in person.

The Clarkes had been gracious with gifts at the banquet, and Stella wanted to show that her family was wvilling to let the past rest. She'd even brought gifts with her today. In their world, more friends were always better than more enemies.

Leyla keyed in the familiar code and strode into the living room.

Carl was making coffee for Damon. The moment his eyes landed on her, his expression soured."What are you doing here again? We made it clear a few days ago-this place isn't yours anymore."

Leyla's gaze swept over the two of them. "Relax, I'm not here to claim the place. I'm here to take what's mine."

Carl snorted, "And what here belongs to you?"

"My room still has plenty of my clothes. Autumn's coming-I need them," she said.

"Your clothes? Those were bought with our family fortune! I'd rather burn them than let you take them," Carl snapped.

Leyla's face hardened. "I don't have time to argue. Those clothes were bought with money I earned over the years. You have no right to touch them."

"You-" Carl started forward, furious.

Just then, Damon's voice cut in from his wheelchair. "Let her take them. I don't want any of her stupid things left in this house."

Leyla frowned.

In the past, Damon had been kind to her. But ever since Eliana arrived, even he had changed. His indifference now only confirmed what she already suspected-she'd been nothing but a stand-in for Eliana.

Not that it mattered anymore. She'd never wanted their affection. She turned to Carl. "You heard him. He agrees."

"Then take your things and go," Damon said flatly. "Don't show up here again."

Carl's voice was equally cold. "Did you hear him? Take your stuff and leave."

Leyla shot them both a cutting glare. Fools-short-sighted and snobbish.

Once she married Hector, she'd make sure they regretted every word.

She didn't waste time arguing. She went upstairs-not to her own room, but to Carl's. The walls were lined with his paintings.

She didn't take any, but she took pictures of each one before leaving.

Then she headed to her own room, packed a few clothes, and dragged her suitcase downstairs.

Carl blocked her way, glancing at it suspiciously. "Everything in there yours?"

Leyla popped it open. Inside were only her clothes.

"See for yourself. Want me to pull each piece out for inspection?" she said, chin tilted high.

Carl's brow furrowed. He had the nagging sense she was up to something, but the suitcase checked out.

Reluctantly, he stepped aside. "Take it-and get lost."

Leyla shut the suitcase, walked a few steps, then looked back."You might feel smug now, but when your money runs dry, you'll come crawling to me. And when that day comes, you'll cry and apologize for what you said today."

Carl scoffed. "We'd rather starve than beg you. And you'd better hold on to Hector. He might decide to leave you one day, and then you'll be the one left crying."

"There's no need for your concern. Hector and I are doing just fine. When we marry, I'll send you an invitation," she sneered.

Damon didn't even blink. "Don't bother. None of us will attend." Leyla's face darkened. That stung more than Carl's barbs.

Then an idea came to her. Her lips curved slightly."1got Brenda's engagement invitation yestero:d yoi get yours,Damon?"

Damon's expression froze, and the color drained from his face, leaving him pale.

Leyla's satisfaction bloomed. Knowing Damon so well, she knew Brenda's engagement would hit him hard.

"If you didn't, I can give you mine," she said sweetly. "Even if you can't be with her, seeing her happy should make you happy too,right?"

Damon's chest tightened painfully.

Before he could answer, Carl snatched up a feather duster and swung it at her."You wretched woman,get out!"

The blow landed on her arm, leaving an angry red mark on her skin. Her eyes blazed. "How dare you hit me?"

"Why not? Now get out!" Carl barked.

He raised the duster again, but Leyla, having made her point, decided she'd had enough. She spun on her heel and stormed out, suitcase wheels rattling behind her.
###Chapter 58 Relapse


Leyla bolted off in an absurdly frantic rush, yet still found thespite to glance over her shoulder."Darnon,you might sneer at me, but who the hell even respects you? You're nothing but a useless cripple now!"

"Shut the fuck up! I must teach you a lesson!" Carl roared, charging after her.

She quickened her steps, her retreating figure flailing like some ridiculous sideshow act.

Carl was about to close the distance and fling more venom her way when Jordy's alarmed voice cut through the air. "Are you okay?"

Carl spun around and froze-Damon's hand was clamped to his chest, his face twisted in pain. The sight jolted him to the core.

He dropped the chase at once, rushing back to Damon's side."Damon, what's wrong? Is it your chest?" he asked urgently.

"I'm fine... I'll be alright in a minute," Damon answered, his voice thin and strained.

He knew exactly what was happening.

Aside from his legs, nothing in his body was truly failing-but the trauma he'd suffered had left deep psychological scars.

The tightness in his chest now was the same old ghost, a relapse that made it feel as if he couldn't draw air.Sometimes the mind could forge symptoms the body obeyed.

Not daring to leave him for even a second, Carl fetched the portable oxygen tank Damon had relied on before and quickly fitted the mask over his face, letting the steady hiss of oxygen soothe his breathing.

Damon finally felt the tightness in his chest loosen, his breaths evening out until he could draw air without aid.

"I'm fine now," he said quietly, slipping the oxygen mask from his face and setting it aside. A flicker of determination crossed his pale features. "Don't tell Mom-or anyone else-about what happened todiay.They have enough on their shoulders without me adding to it."

The strain already hanging over the family felt heavy enough to crush them, he refused to be another burden.

"Carl.Jordy.You heard me?"

Though both exchanged uneasy glances, they eventually gave stiff nods.

Once Damon was settled back into bed, his breathing steadier, Carl stepped out into the hallway. He pulled out his phone with a furrowed brow, an unshakable urge gnawing at him-Eliana needed to know.

At the factory Carl had given her, Eliana busied herself alongside the Onyx Syndicate members, directing the setup and overseeing the move.

The syndicate couldn't shift their entire operation in one go, so the relocation was happening in careful,staggered waves.

Seth arrived with the first batch, bringing along a few of her most trusted subordinates-not just for the work, but because it had been days since they'd last seen her.

The moment they stepped inside, the room warmed with the hum of greetings and laughter.

Among them was Kathy Vance, one of the organization's rare young women. Her eyes brimmed the moment she spotted Eliana. "I heard that when you went to see Janessa, that heartless bitch drugged you and nearly sold you off. I wanted to rush to your side right away, but without your say-so, I didn't dare."

With a gentle smile, Eliana reached up to brush a loose strand from Kathy's cheek."Don't cry," she murmured. "It spoils that pretty face. And look-I'm doing fine now, aren'tl?"

Kathy still shook her head, her brow knitting. "But you've gotten so thin..."

"Have I really?" Eliana blinked,caught off guard.

"Yes," Kathy said with conviction."Your waist is so tiny-your chin's sharper than ever." Eliana gave a light laugh. "That's just your imagination. If anything, I've actually put on a bit."

After she returned to the Murray family, Stella had deemed her far too slender and ordered Ashiey to prepare rich, varied meas for her every day-so many that Eliana often left the table uncomfortably full. At this rate, she half-feared she'd soon be waddling instead of walking.

"Anyway, without me fussing over you, you've gotten thinner. Stay for dinner-I'll put together a feast you won't forget," Kathy said with a warm but insistent smile.

As the youngest daughter of the illustrious Vance family-culinary royalty in the nation-she carried the legacy of a household famous for exquisite pastries and a chain of more than a hundred stores. Hef skill in the kitchen, honed from childhood, meant even her simplest dishes came out rich with flavor and irresistible aroma.

Yet, even with all her mastery, she still trailed a littlebehind Eliana's talent.

One unforgettable meal from Eliana had left Kathy so dazzled she'd pursued her relentlessly. In the end,Eliana finally agreed to allow her to join the Onyx Syndicate.

The syndicate was never short on brilliance-its ranks brimmed with experts from every imaginable field.

Because of that,they could take on nearly any assignment-so long as it didn't veer into anything illegal.

Even so, requests for her to cook were rare within the Onyx Syndicate, which was why, on idle days, Kathy often busied herself in the kitchen and whipped up meals for the members.

Her favorite to cook for was always Eliana, who never failed to share little tips that sharpened her culinary skills.

To Kathy, Eliana was a woman who could do anything.

"I don't think I can stay tonight. There's an exhibition I have to attend later. I'll be here for, lunch tomorrow,alright?" Eliana said.

Kathy nodded, her expression tinged with regret, and looped her arm through Eliana's. "Then make sure you're here at noon. I'Il hit the market early and bring back the best ingredients I can find." "Deal," Eliana replied with a small, knowing smile.

Eliana's phone chimed, and she saw Carl's name flash on the screen.

Handing a quick smile to Kathy, she told her to keep helping before slipping the phone to her ear.

"Lia, are you finished spending time with your friends?" Carl's voice came through, low and familiar.

"Not yet," she answered, a thread of curiosity creeping in. "Why? Did something happen?"

"Nothing urgent, just..." His tone dropped as he quietly described what had taken place earlier."Damon didn't want me to say anything, but you told me to keep you updated on anything at home-so I'm tellíng you now."

"You did the right thing," Eliana said warmly.

Carl's face lit up at her words, his grin wide with pride. Then he told her everything that had happened at home.


"How's Damon now?" Eliana asked, her tone turning earnest.

"He's stable. I've put him on an oxygen mask, and the color's back in his face,"Carl reported.

"Good. If his breathing falters again, let him use it right away. His body's fine-it's his mind that's weighing on him. Don't stress over it too much. I'll head back onceI finish up here," she instructed.

"Got it!" Carl replied with a firm nod.

Elianatilted her head, her tone laced with skepticism."Did Leyla really come all the way back just to grab a few clothes?"

She had already checked the bank records-Leyla still had over thirty million sitting untouched. The idea that she would return to her old room for nothing more than a handful of outfits struck her as far too suspicious.

"Yeah," Carl replied after a beat, rubbing the back of his neck. "I was half afraid she'd sneak something else into her luggage, but when I looked inside, it was only clothes. Nothing else." Eliana then warned, "Don't breathe a word of it to Mom-it'll only weigh on her."

"Understood," Carl said with a short nod.

When the call ended, Eliana kept the phone in her hand, her eyes narrowing in thought.

Concern for the Murray family tugged at her. That was why she'd had discreet cameras installed on every floor-two of them positioned in the dimlylit corridor on the second floor, their presence invisible to the casual eye.

She scrubbed through the footage to the moment Carl had mentioned and, sure enough, Leyla emerged on the second-floor feed.

Instead of heading to her own room, however, Leyla slipped straight into Carl's first.

There were no cameras inside the bedrooms-privacy rules saw to that-so all Eliana could do was watch Leyla vanish behind the door and reappear several minutes later.

What caught Eliana's attention was that Leyla came out empty-handed.

What on earth could be in Carl's room that was worth risking a lecture just to step inside?

After a thoughtful pause, Eliana decided the quickest way to get answers was to call Carl directly.

After hearing her words, Carl frowned in confusion. "What could she possibly want in my room? There's nothing in there except a few paintings I've sketched in my spare time."

"Paintings?" Eliana's tone carried a hint of intrigue.

"Yeah," Carl admitted with a small shrug. "It's the only hobby l've really stuck with."

Her eyes narrowed ever so slightly, the gears turning in her mind.

A theory was taking shape, and she suspected it wouldn't be long before she proved herself right
###Chapter 59 Tristan's Magnetic Presence


"She probably just went in to snoop. There wasn't anything worth much in there, right?" Eliana asked.

"Yeah. I'm not into all those fancy luxury things... but I do like buying them for you," Carl replied with a sheepish grin.

"Good. As long as nothing valuable was there,"Eliana said, her tone hardening. "Next time she shows up,don't let her in again. And change the front-gate code-no point giving her another chance to upset Damon."

Close acquaintance could always strike where it hurt the most. Leyla was that type-cold-blooded enough to twist the knife without hesitation.

Damon had once treated her kindly, yet she had the heart to hurt him with her words.

Eliana wasn't going to let her get away with it.

"Alright, I'll change it right now."

"No rush," she replied, "I'll send you an address. Go change clothes and be on your way immediately."

Carl agreed without bothering to ask for more details.

Before she could offer more explanation, her phone buzzed with another incoming call.

She checked the caller,ID. Tristan.

She hung up on Carl and answered.

"Eliana, you haven't forgotten our agreement, have you?" Tristan's voice came low, warm, and velvety enough to curl around her like smoke.

"Relax.I remember. I'll be at the exhibition in an houshe replied.

"How about I come get you now? I've got a dress for you, and I can bring it along."
"No need," she said flatly. '"T'm not home. I'll head over right away when I'm done."

"Where are you? I can meet you instead," Tristan pressed.

"You're being a little too nosy, aren't you? I said I'll meet you there.

Something in her tone must have reached him because he gave a low chuckle and backed off."Alright then.
Call me when you arrive-I'll have someone escort you in."

"Okay. Bye for now." Eliana ended the call.

She turned just as Seth rushed in, arms full of documents. He wasn't sure where to keep them.

"They should go in innermost room," Elaina told him.

"Gotit!"

The minutes bled away in a blur of tasks. By the time Eliana checked her watch,she had twenty minutes left.

She grabbed her bag and had Seth drive her straight to the venue-an exhibition hall named The Infinite.

It was the crown jewel of Qidence's art scene, a space every top artist dreamed of booking, where reputations were made and careers cemented.

Eliana knew it well-the curator had invited her more than once to showcase her paintings.

But to her, painting was just a quiet hobby, not a career move, so she'd always declined.

Meanwhile, Leyla arrived at the entrance of the exhibition hall with a friend who'd been buzzing with anticipation fordays.

"Leyla, you're amazing!" the friend gushed, clutching her arm. "Even my dad couldn't get tickets, and you got them for me! You should've seen his face when I told him-I think he was jealous."

Leyla let a faint smile slip, basking in the admiration. "It was nothing."

The praise settled over her like warm silk, feeding her smug satisfaction.

Pulling out her phone, she dialed Davin's number. "Mr. Gordon, my friend and I are at the entrance." ＂Alright， I甲 come get you，＂ he replied.

Minutes later, Davin appeared at the doors, and the crowd's humn rose instantly.

"Isn't that the oil painting master, Davin Gordon?I can't believe he's here...If I'd known he would be hers today, I'd have given my ticket to my grandpa-he's a huge fan of Mr. Gordon."

"Looks like he's meeting someone. Who could be so important that he would come out to meet them himself?"

Leyla caught the whispers and fought to keep the smug smile off her face.

She lifted a hand in a graceful wave. "Mr. Gordon!"

Spotting her through the crowd, Davin's eyes lit with recognition. He gave a brief nod and, flanked by two security guards, made his way toward Leyla.

The movement drew stares instantly. Heads turned. Envy shimmered in the air like static.

Some recognized her. The whispers picked up again. "Isn't that Leyla from the Murray family? She knows Mr.Gordon? Could she be his newest student?"

"Didn't he stop taking students years ago.Maybe her talent's so extraordinary he made an exception."

"That's probably the case,"

"Wait.You mean that Murray family? The bankrupt one?"

"Yeah. I heard they just brought back some long-lost daughter from the countryside. Stella kicked Leyla out afterwards."

"What?!" an incredulous voice exclaimed. "They kicked out someone handpicked by Mr. Gordon? Didn't they realize her potentials?

"Exactly. No wonder the family's in ruins-short-sighted, the lot of them."

"I heard all six sons are incompetent. And that daughter they brought back from the countryside? Probably not worth much either. Tossing a gem for rubble. Pathetic!" Exactly. It would be a miracle if they still manage to stay afloat after now."

The voices blended into a cruel undercurrent around her, every comment nastier than the last.

Leyla caught enough to know what was being said, but she kept her expression smooth, as though the words had slid right past her.

She smiled up at Davin. "Thank you for gifting me the tickets,Mr.Gordon."

Davin, older and slightly hard of hearing, was unaware of the murmurs. Stroking his graying beard, he said warmly, "When I saw your painting last time, I knew you had remarkable talent. It's my honor you could make it today."

"You flatter me," Leyla said, voice laced with faux modesty.

"Not at all. You've got more skill than the other students I teach. I'm eager to see what you do in today's competition."

Her eyes brightened. "Will you be competing too?"

He chuckled, shaking his head. "I'm too old for that. This is your stage, not mine. I'll be sitting with the other judges."

Leyla nodded with practiced grace. "I understand. I'll do my best not to disappoint you."

Davin gave her a warm smile."Good. There's stiff competition today. Don't put too much pressure on yourself. Win or lose, treat it as a learning experience."

"Alright."

"Come," he said, gesturing toward the hall. "Let's go in."

"Okay." With her.friend in tow, Leyla followed him toward the entrance.

The ticket check hadn't begun yet, so those without connections could only watch from the sidelines, their envy trailing after her like a shadow.

Inside, the space was even more breathtaking than it looked from outside. Paintings for the charity auction hung suspended from sleek, nearly invisible wires, giving the entire half a futurtstic air.

"This place is gorgeous," her friend breathed, scanning the crowd for Tristan.

A moment later, her eyes lit up as she spotted him standing before a painting that seemed to be floating in air.

She gripped Leyla's sleeve. "Leyla-look. Mr. Pearson's over there."

Following her gaze, Leylä's eyes landed on Tristan.

Today,he wore a midnight-blue suit that fit like it had been made for him. On his chest, an obsidian-studded brooch caught the light in subtle flashes. The combination of elegance and restraint made his presence magnetic.

He had a way of owning any room he stepped into. Even without the weight of Pearson Group's power, his presence alone turned heads-magnetic, effortless, impossible to ignore.
 ###Chapter 60 She Occupied Far Too Much Of His Thoughts


Leyla's breath caught for a moment as her gaze swept over Tristan's tall frame and chiseled features.

He was the sort of man she had never dared to imagine for herself.

Yet the warmth in her chest chilled when she recalled the sight of him shielding Eliana that day.

She couldn't make sense of why he had chosen to stand on Eliana's side.

The thought made her avert her eyes, not wanting to draw his attention and risk stirring memories of the welcome-home banquet.

But before she could quietly fade into the background, Davin's voice broke in, smooth and deliberate."Leyla, let me introduce you to today's host," he said, a knowing smile tugging at his lips. "He's a friend of mine-perhaps the two of you will find some common ground."

Leyla's first instinct was to turn him down, but the thought stalled when she recalled the deep-rooted ties between the Murray and Pearson families.

It occurred to her that Tristan's defense of Eliana that day might not have been about Eliana at all, but simply loyalty to the Murray family's nạme.

If she could sway Tristan's view of her, the Murray family might lose their final pillar of support.

With that in mind, she set her pride aside and gave a small nod of assent.

Her friend made a move to follow, but when Davin offered no invitation, she faltered. Forcing a casual smile,she excused herself. "You go on ahead, Leyla. I'll just take a little stroll."

"Alright," Leyla replied, her voice light but her eyes already fixed on the opportunity ahead.'




Meanwhile,Tristan stood before a large canvas, his gaze lingering on every brushstroke. The oil painting, titled "Cold Moon", glowed softly under the gaflery lights. In the upper left corner, the neat signature read Riley.

Riley's name was well-known in alite oil painting, yet the artist's identity remained an enigrna. No one could say for certain whether Rlley was a man or a woman-though whispers in the art world favored the assumption of a teolusive, male genius. The belief had been rooted in the bold strokes and sweeping grandeur of the paintings-styles many in the art world still insisted women couldn't master.

Tristan had long held Rlley's work in the highest regard. Years ago, he had bid fiercely at an auction, paying an extravagant sum to claim every piece Riley had ever put up for sale. The painting now featured in the charity gala was one of his personal favorites, and under any other circumstance, he would never have parted with it. Yet for the sake of the cause, he had reluctantly allowed it to go under auction.

As Tristan's gaze lingered on the artist's signature, a sudden memory flickered-Eliana's neat handwriting on the prescription she had prepared for Miguel.

The handwriting bore an uncanny resemblance to Riley's, making Tristan's chest tighten for a beat.

Then, with a wry, self-deprecating smile, he shook his head. He was clearly losing his grip-seeing traces of Eliana everywhere, even in a few lines of ink.

They had barely known each other a week, yet she occupied far too much of his thoughts.

A troubling thought flickered through himn: when the blurred screenshot from the surveillance footage was finally sharpened, what if the figure he'd been holding so dearly in his heart turned out not to be Eliana at all?

Perhaps he told himself to keep his emotions in check until the restored screenshot gave him certainty.

But he had overlooked one truth-some impulses in life simply refused to be reined in, sneezes and feelings chief among them.

Tristan had been seconds away from calling to see if Eliana had arrived when Davin's voice carried from behind.

This charity exhibition bore Davin's mark in more ways than one-he had donated a number of his paintings without asking for a cent.

Turning with an easy smile, Tristan's expression shifted the instant his gaze landed on Leyla at Davin's side the warmth in his eyes icing over in a heartbeat. "And who might this be?"

Davin, oblivious to the frost in Tristan's gaze-likely because Tristan's expression was almost always unreadable-tilted his head with a friendly smile. "Do my teacher's paintings appeal to you?"

Tristan's brow arched in faint surprise. He cast a brief glance over his shoulder at the artwork, then turned back to ask, "Riley is your teacher?"

A proud smile lit Davin's face as he nodded. "Yes. It's been an honor to learn from Riley. My painting had stalled for a while, yet thanks to my teacher, I pushed past that block and improved dramatically."

Davin's eyes lit with open admiration at the mention of Riley, but the warmth faded quickly as he remembered why he'd come. Turning back to Tristan, he gestured toward Leyla beside him. "This is a remarkably gifted artist I met at a recent oil painting competition. I invited her here especially to take part in today's event."

Leyla tilted her chin ever so slightly, summoning what she believed to be her most dazzling smile.'"Nice to meet you, Mr. Pearson," she greeted, her voice honeyed with practiced charm.

Inwardly, she reasoned that even if Tristan still resened her for past incidents, he wouldn't risk embarrassing her in front of Davin-a man who held considerable sway in the oil painting world.

To her astonishment,Tristan didn't even grant her the courtesy of a glance.

His sharp eyes stayed on Davin, his voice calm yet cool as polished steel. "Mr. Gordon, Lknow you prize artistic talent," he remarked, a faint arch to his brow. "But there are times when it pays to be far more discerning."

Leyla's smile faltered, her expression turning rigid as if the muscles in her face had locked in place.

Davin,standing close by, stiffened as well, his surprise flashing openly across his features.

Before he could press Tristan for an explanation, Tristan's voice cut in, cold and measured. "I have business to handle. Please enjoy the event."

Without another glance, he strode past Leyla, his broad shoulders brushing the air beside her as though she weren't there at all, heading straight for the entrance.

A new message from Eliana lit his phone screen-she'd just arrived.

Davin's gaze followed Tristan's retreating figure, a faint frown creasing his brow before he slowly turned his eyes back to Leyla. "Do you have something against him?"

Tristan's reputation for cool detachment was well-known, but even then, he was unfailingly courteous.

This was the first time Davin had ever seen him treat someone with such blatant frostiness-and judging by his tone, Tristan even had an opinion about him as well.

That shift in manner made Davin's own warmth toward Leyla fade, his expression cooling.

Leyla dropped her gaze, putting on an air of innocence. "We don't have any issues-it's only because of my sister that he dislikes me."

Davin's brows drew together. "Your sister?"

Leyla gave a small, almost pitiful nod, her lashes lowering as if to hide a flicker of hurt. "You've probably heard bits about me. Because my sister hates me, he's likely taken on her dislike."

Davin did know her story-how the Murray family had cast her aside once they'd found their true-born daughter.

His frown deepened."And why would she hate you?"

With a dainty swipe at imaginary tears, Leyla sighed, "Because the whole Murray family has always favored me over her. She's convinced I stole them from her, so she pushed them into choosing between us."

Her voice came out ragged, trembling as though she might shatter at any moment.

Davin's brows knit even tighter. "That's absurd! You were a child-being adopted wasn't your choice. The Murray family took you in of their own-will. How can she hold that against you? That's petty beyond reason." Leyla curved her lips in a faint, joyless smile. "Don't let it rile you. I've already made my peace witn it. ve learned to stand on my own since leaving the Murray family."

Davin's chest tightened with sympathy, yet he knew it was still a matter between family-one he had no right to step into.

After a thoughtful pause, he made up his mind. "Leyla, how would you feel about becoming my student?"

A spark of exhilaration lit up in her eyes.

She had lied to salvage her reputation and undermine Eliana's, but instead, she'd stumbled upon an unexpected stroke of fortune.
###Chapter 61 Did I Keep You Waiting
 Had Leyla discovered earlier that Davin was a man who carried both unshakable principles and a generous heart, she would have approached him long ago to earn his goodwill. If she had managed that,becoming his student might have happened much sooner.


With that title, the Clarkes could have seen her as a worthy match and perhaps welcomed her into their fold without hesitation. Still, she knew it wasn't too late to change her path now.


"Absolutely, I'd be honored! I only worry that my skills might fall short and end up tarnishing your name," said ,Leyla, her heart alight with excitement even as she kept her tone humble and her expression modest.


With a faint smile, Davin gave her shoulder a reassuring pat. "There's no need to downplay yourself.I know how to recognize talent when I see it." Her work already carried a distinct signature, though it still bore the traces of youthful inexperience. With the right guidance, he figured, she had the potential to become renowned all over the world.



"Thank you so much!" Leyla replied without hesitation.


At that same time, Elíana reached the entrance of the exhibition hall. She'd tapped out a quick message to Tristan,then lifted her eyes to take in the sweeping architecture.


What most people didn't realize was that this masterpiece had been her creation, completed when she was just eighteen.


Now, seeing it rise before her in all its glory stirred a deep swell of emotion within her.



Her quiet moment was broken when a voice called out-someone who had attended her welcome banquet just days earlier.


"Isn't that Ms. Murray? She got invited as well?"


The comment sparked curiosity among those nearby,and heads turned toward where the speaker was looking.



At the far edge of the red carpet stood a young woman radiating a poised elegance.



Instead of a gown like the other women wore,she was dressed in a crisp white suit tailored to perfection.



Beneath the jacket was a silky white blouse, its collar slightly open to reveal a graceful collarbone adorned with a diamond pendant that caught the light with every movement. Straight white trousers flowed seamlessly down her long legs, enhancing her striking height.


When the breeze swept past, the hem of her jacket swayed, as though even the wind acknowledged her quiet authority.



She carried herself with effortless authority, the kind that made her seem like the one running the entire event.



One sweeping glance from her was enough to draw collective awe, especially from those wvho had previously dismissed her in favor of Leyla's so-called brilliance.



"Wasn't she supposed to have grown up in a poor family? How can she carry herself like that?"


"She's far prettier than Leyla. "



Not everyone was willing to join in the admiration.One voice cut through with a sneer. "Oh, please. It's just the outfit. Dress any woman well enough and she'll look the part. For all we know, she's hiding a terrible figure under that suit. Her family's broke, but they must have scraped together enough to hire a whole team of stylists to make sure she passes for refined."



The speaker's original plan had been to tear down Eliana's appearance by claiming her beauty was all makeup.



Yet the sunlight betrayed the truth-her skin was flawless, untouched by even the faintest trace of cosmetics. Unable to fault her appearance, the woman who had mocked Eliana earlier latched onto something else."So she's pretty, big deal. Leyla's got Davin Gordon himself greeting her, while Eliana's standing here like the rest of us, waiting for a ticket check."


Until then, Eliana had been absorbed in admiring the building she had brought to life on paper years ago,only now noticing the quiet murmurs around her.


Though the words were hushed, one name reached her ears-Davin Gordon.



Were they talking about that stubborn old man who had insisted she should take him on as a student? So he was here today.


Of course he'd be here; he never missed an art exhibition. Actually, the timing worked in her favor.'Lately, his work had shown a clear decline in finesse,and she wasn't about to let that association dull her own name. This might be her chance to remind him,tactfully or not, to sharpen his skills where they'd begun to slip.



A sudden stir ran through the entrance as a.group stepped into view.



All eyes shifted toward the newcomers without a second thought. At the center of the entourage strode an impossibly handsome man, flanked on all sides by bodyguards.



It was as if he carried his own glow, each step drawing quiet awe, and the girls near the doors could only gasp.



"Oh my God!"


"That's got to be Mr. Pearson. I heard he was attractive, but seeing him up close... it's almost unreal.I'd call this trip worth it already."


"Wait, that's really Mr. Pearson? He looks like he walked straight out of a movie."


"I've heard his brother, Jermaine Pearson, is more handsome than most celebrities. But now that Tristan Pearson's here, I can't even remember what Jermaine looks like."



"Keep your voice down. It's not wise to talk too freely about the Pearsons."



That single reminder smothered the murmurs in an instant.


Still, the question lingered-what was Tristan doing here now? Was he waiting to receive someone important? Who could warrant Tristan Pearson's personal welcome? Could it be Elbert Pearson himself?But if the rumors were true,Elbert was still confined to bed and couldn't possibly appear in public.


Speculation only deepened with every passing second.


From her spot near the entrance, Eliana finally caught sight of him after several long minutes.


Her brows knit together, and she shifted forward, but the press of bodies around her kept her from moving any closer.



People surged forward,each trying to get as close to Tristan as possible, desperate to grab this rare moment.



The guests might have been dripping with wealth or power, but at an event hosted by the Pearson family,status melted away-no one wanted to squander a chance to stand in Tristan's shadow.



'Blocked from advancing, Eliana was just about to call and ask him to send someone to escort her in through a quieter entrance-when she caught sight of him moving directly toward her with his entourage in tow.



Tristan had already seen her.


In an instant, his bodyguards moved into action,parting the crowd with swift, decisive gestures.

 
Within moments, the space ahead of her was clear. Tristan stopped right in front of Eliana, disregarding the curious stares around them, and said, "Did I keep you waiting? I ran into someone unpleasant and missed your message.Took me a couple of minutes to get here."



The moment his voice carried over the crowd, the buzzing chatter died.



Eyes widened across the crowd as realization sank in -the person he had come to greet was Eliana!


Some blinked hard, even rubbed their eyes,convinced they were mistaken.



And yet the truth was undeniable. Tristan, whose expression was usually cool and unreadable, was looking at her with unmistakable warmth and a smile that broke his usual composure.


Since when had he ever smiled like that? The answer was never.



"It's fine, I only just got here. We should get going."Eliana had already felt the weight of people's eyes before he appeared.



Once he showed up, it was as though every eye in the place had latched onto her.


She had no interest in being paraded like some curiosity, so she kept it brief and started walking inside.


To the onlookers, it appeared as though she remained completely unaffected by Tristan's presence.
###Chapter 62 Twisting Eliana's Words
Having grown used to Eliana's cool detachment,Tristan trailed after her with casual ease.



The moment his gaze landed on her, a faint smile tugged at his lips-and stayed there, unbroken.



Any earlier vow to keep his emotions in check evaporated from his mind.


Flanked by a wall of bodyguards in crisp black suits,the pair strode swiftly into the venue.



The entrance hush lasted only a beat before the crowd collected themselves.



Several men,their initial shock fading into tight-lipped displeasure, exchanged loaded glances.


These were not ordinary guests-they were business heavyweights with ongoing projects under the Pearson Group's umbrella-yet not one of them had ever been honored with Tristan's personal welcome.



Eliana,however, gave no indication she was impressed.Her chin lifted slightly, her eyes calm but edged with pride, as though Tristan's presence carried no weight in her world at all.



Back when the Murray family still reigned among the city's elite, such behavior might have been tolerated



But now that the Murray Group had collapsed into bankruptcy, the men in attendance considered them beneath even polishing their shoes. To see Tristan,calm and attentive toward Eliana despite her frosty demeanor, was something they could neither accept nor understand.



Among the women, the disapproval was just as sharp -particularly from the younger ones.


Tristan's striking looks had set many hearts racing,making him the ideal man in their eyes. Yet here was Eliana, the very woman they had dismissed, carrying herself with imperious confidence in his presence.


The sight stoked their resentment and jealousy until it burned at its peak.


At that moment, movement at the entrance drew their attention. Security staff began inspecting invitations with meticulous care.



This charity exhibition wasn't just any social event-it was an exclusive gathering of the city's most influential, and the coveted invitations were few and fiercely sought after. The guests had arrived brimming with anticipation,clutching their invitations as if they were golden tickets.



Yet the moment they saw Tristan personally usher Eliana inside, their excitement dimmed, and the invites in their hands suddenly felt far less precious.


Not everyone reacted with bitterness. The shrewder among them quickly recalculated, deciding there was merit in aligning themselves with Eliana once inside.



They reasoned that Tristan wouldn't extend such courtesy to someone of modest background without a compelling reason-befriend her, and perhaps his favor would follow.



To them, quiet contempt and polite flattery were not contradictions but parallel strategies.



By then, Eliana had already stepped into the heart of the event.



The building was arranged in three distinct sections: a welcoming foyer dominated by a gleaming sign-in board, the central exhibition hall beyond it,and on either side of the space, the conference area to the left and a plush lounge area with a dining section to the right.



Following Tristan's lead, Eliana walked past the sign-in desk and entered the heart of the exhibition.



Rows of artworks floated weightlessly, suspended by levitation technology, their frames glinting under the ambient lighting. Eliana's lashes trembled as she took them in.



It had started as nothing more than a pitch to the curator, yet here it was, alive and breathtaking.


Assuming her gaze meant fascination, Tristan inclined his head. "Would you like me to give you the full tour?Today's charity auction is showcasing internationally renowned pieces."


Noticing the curious stares from every direction,Eliana's brows drew together. "No, that's alright. Go take care of what you need to. I'll look around on my own."



With the event about to begin and final preparations still pending, he simply nodded. "Very well. Once things are underway, I'll come find you."



Turning to Rocco, he added in a low, firm tone,"Stay with Eliana."



Rocco straightened as he replied, his tone brisk with agreement, "Got it."


Doran's eyes kept drifting toward him, tinged with envy. Tagging along with Tristan meant endless errands, while being paired with Eliana looked more like a leisurely stroll than work. It felt to him as though Tristan were playing favorites.



Then another thought struck-maybe Tristan believed Rocco's looks outshone his own, and that was why he'd entrusted him with Eliana. That thought alone soothed Doran's pride.



Completely oblivious to Doran's silent grumbling,Rocco offered Eliana a polite, almost formal gesture,inviting her forward.



She inclined her head in acknowledgment, then began to wander deeper into the exhibition hall at a slow,measured pace.



Tristan lingered for a few seconds, watching Eliana's retreatingfigure before Doran's voice drew him back to the matter at hand.



The guest list included prominent figures from the political sphere,among them Rupert Oliver, the newly appointed mayor who had only stepped into office a few days earlier.



The former mayor's abrupt removal for investigation -over matters closely entangled with Louis' troubles -was still the talk of the city.



"I've spoken with Mayor Oliver before. He's not hard to work with. But..." Doran began, then paused mid- thought.



Tristan's eyes narrowed slightly. "But what?"



Doran rubbed the back of his neck, a flicker of hesitation crossing his face. "He kept asking if there was someone you favored. I dodged the question as best I could."



A knowing look crossed Tristan's features, the corners of his mouth lifting faintly. "Perfect. I'll answer him myself."



···...


In the main exhibition hall. Eliana came to a halt before a certain canvas, her gaze settling on it for a lingering moment.



The painting wasn't the work of just any artist-it belonged to her own student, Davin.


"Ms. Murray, are you a fan of Mr. Gordon's work?"Rocco inquired, watching her closely.


She gave a casual shrug and answered, "Not really."



Her blunt answer carried through the hushed admiration of those gathered nearby, drawing curious glances.



Among them stood the young woman Leyla had brought along.


Already harboring resentment toward Eliana-especially after Eliana refused to share Tristan's preferences at their last meeting-the woman seized her chance to speak. Her lips curled with disdain.


"Mr. Gordon is a legendary artist. I get that you don't know the first thing about art-you're just a country bumpkin-but don't spout igmorant monsense," she remarked, each word laced with malice.



Rocco's brow furrowed as it ready to fire back, but Eliana reached out and gently touched his arm, a small shake of her head urging him to stand down."Leave it," she murmuired



Her restraint, however, was not shared by the other party.



The moment Eliana turned to walk away, the woman darted forward, stepping directly into Eliana's way."Hold it! You really think you can insult Mr. Gordon and just stroll off?"



Eliana's gaze finally met hers, cool and unhurried.



Recognition flickered instantly-this was the same sharp-tongued girl from her welcome-home banquet,the one who had sneered about her being a country bumpkin chasing a wealthy husband. The woman was none other than Frieda Larson.



"It's you again," Eliana muttered evenly.


Frieda gave a derisive snort. "You bad-mouthed Mr.Gordon and think you can just walk away? Not happening. You owe him an apology! Don't you all agree?"



The group gathered in front of the painting happened to be admirers of Davin's work, and they eagerly rallied behind Frieda's call. "Exactly! You'd better apologize to him!"



"You're spouting nonsense without knowing a thing!Do you even know Mr. Gordon's here today? One word out of place and we'll make sure you regret it!"



Eliana's gaze swept over them, her expressioncool and unyielding. "AlL I said was that I don't care for his painting. Since when does that count as an insult?"



Frieda's lips curled in disdain. "You knew he was here,yet you declared your dislike for his work in front of everyone. How is that not insulting him?"



It was clear to anyone paying attention that she was deliberately twisting Eliana's words.


Still, Eliana found the whole exchange faintly amusing rather than infuriating. "This piece is poorly executed. Why shouldn't I be allowed to say I don't like it?"



"Poorly executed? You're just babbling without a clue what you're talking about," Frieda scoffed, her tone dripping with disdain.



"I'm only speaking the truth," Eliana replied evenly,her voice calm but steady.



"Oh really? Then enlighten us-what exactly is so poorly done?" Frieda pressed, her eyes narrowing.


She had always assumed anyone from the countryside had a shallow grasp of art, and she was certain Eliana wouldn't be able to give a single insightful critique.
###Chapter 63 Criticizing Davin's Work
Eliana had no patience for pointless chatter with Frieda."I'm busy and have no time to waste here," she said curtly, already turning to leave with Rocco.


She had come to the main exhibition hall to find Davin.Since she hadn't found him yet, she certainly wasn't going to waste energy sparring with Frieda



If she wanted to point out Davin's flaws, she would do it directly to him, not through someone who had no stake in the matter.



But Eliana's calm dismissal only fueled Frieda's suspicions.



She became certain that Eliana didn't understand art at all-merely pretending to know, and criticizing Davin's work for attention.



Frieda even doubted Eliana could recognize Davin if she saw him.



When Eliana moved to walk off, Frieda wasn't about to let her go without a parting shot She grabbed Eliana's arm and barked, "You're not going anywhere until you explain yourself-and apologize for your ignorance!"



Eliana narrowed her eyes, ready to pull free, but Rocco stepped in first,prying Frieda's hand off her. "Keep your hands to yourself!" he snapped.



Frieda had never seen him before-Rocco hadn't been at that welcome banquet that day-so she assumed he was Eliana's bodyguard.



Her face tightened in annoyance. "And who exactly do you think you are? How dare you lay a hand on me?"


"I'm-" Rocco began, but the words were cut short by a stir in the crowd



"Mr. Gordon is here!"



"Yeah, he's arrivedl"



Frieda's head snapped toward the commotion.



Sure enough,Davin was making his way into the hall,quickly surrounded by an eager crowd.



Most people here were art lovers; Davin Gordon was a name that commanded respect.



Forgetting Rocco entirely, Frieda hurried toward him and called out loudly, "Mr. Gordon! Someone here is insulting you and your work!" Davin's brows drew together. He could take criticism -but not baseless insults. "Who is it?" he asked.



"It's her!" Frieda pointed in Eliana's direction.



From where he stood, Davin could only see the outline of a slim young woman-Rocco's tall frame blocked most of her face.



"Oh... the young lady,"he said with a slight frown."She's still so young. She might know must about painting Forget it. I'm not going to argue with her."



He was turning to go when Eliana's voice cut across the space "Your painting skills have regressed significantly"



The words hit Davin like a slap His face darkened.He hadn't heard Eliana's voice in years, so it didn't register immediately-but that phrase "regressed significantly" caught his attention.



"Oh? And how exactly did you reach that conclusion,young lady?"



Frieda rounded on Eliana, her tone dripping with contempt. "Mr. Gordon is asking you! Speak up! How dare you-someone who clearly knows nothing about art-criticize him?"



From her angle, Eliana could see his face clearly.He  had aged in the two years since they'd last met


For that reason alone, she didn't want to tear him down in public. "I'll tell you privately," she said.


"Hah!" Frieda scoffed. "You're bluffing. You don't know what you're talking about."


Davin's voice cut through her mockery. "I welcome criticism from anyone.No need for privacy-go ahead."


Since he insisted, Eliana stepped toward one of his paintings. "This landscape-you painted it recently,right?


Davin nodded. "Last month. It's one of my proudest works. Let's hear your insight."


Eliana's gaze swept over the canvas, sharp and deliberate. "At first glance, it's impressive. The mist drapes over the mountains beautifully, and the stream at the base balances the composition. But..."



She shifted her tone."The rockwork-while strong-lacks a natural grace.Here-"



She pointed to the lower corner. "These strokes feel forced, as if you were trying too hard to convey strength, and in doing so, you lost the natural ruggedness and spontaneity of the stone."



Davin's face tightened. Frieda opened her mouth to fire back, but Davin's look silenced her. "Let her continue," he ordered.


He'd noticed that exact flaw before. Hearing Eliana pinpoint it intrigued him.



Reluctantly, Frieda kept quiet.


Eliana went on, "And here-the ripples. They look winding at first, but when you really look, the brushwork is too calculated. You've trapped the water inside your own structure, when real water flows without restraint."



Each observation drew more hostility from the onlookers. They weren't opposed to hearing a critique -but coming from her? That was too much.


"What does she know? Paintings are supposed to be precise!"


"Mr. Gordon, don't listen to her-she's clueless."



"Exactly. I've followed your work for years. She's just spouting nonsense."


Davin ignored them entirely. At his level, true,unflinching feedback was rare.


Only a few were bold enough. Riley gave it. And now.the young woman before him too. He was pleased that someone besides Riley could offer him suggestions.



Eliana raised a brow and finished, "And the mist-it's too heavy-handed. You've tried to force a dreamlike atmosphere, but mist should be fleeting, not smeared on."



The crowd bristled even more.



This painting was "Mountain Mist". Without thick mist,what was it supposed to be? And it was displayed in the main hall-proof that the Pearson Group valued it.



"Where's this country girl from, thinking she can talk down to Mr. Gordon?"



"She's talking nonsense-none of it makes sense."



"Indeed!"



Frieda was already bristling from Eliana's sharp,confident critique. So when the crowd started piling on her,Frieda jumped right in, snapping, "What do you know about oil paintings, about landscapes, you little country bumpkin?"


"Enough!" Davin's voice cracked through the noise,sharp and cold.



Frieda froze. He was glaring at her-really glaring-  and her stomach gave a nervous twist.



"Mr. Gordon, I was just speaking up for you..." she stammered.



"I know you were," Davin said evenly, "but the young lady is right."


Frieda's eyes widened in disbelief. Right? He was saying Eliana was right? He wasn't angry at all? This was Davin Gordon-master of oil painting, a man people in the art world practically bowed to-and he was siding with a country girl who had just criticized him?



Frieda couldn't wrap her head around it.. Gordon,


But Davin didn't let her finish. He simply turned away,cutting through the crowd with long strides until he was standing in front of Eliana.
###Chapter 64 She's Riley



Davin approached Eliana with an eager gleam in his eyes. "Younng lady, you're absolutely right. I've felt something was off about my recent works, but l couldn't put my finger on it. Could you tell me how to avoid this in the future?"



Eliana gave a small, knowing smile. "The problem isn't in the mountains, or the flowing water, or the mist. It's that you've started wanting too much. That hunger has dulled the very thing that made your work extraordinary-its essence. That's why your paintings feel...expressive lately."



Hearing that, Davin was taken aback.


He remembered Riley once telling him that the essence of his works was his greatest strength.



And now, hearing Eliana say the same-and point out it was gone-everything clicked.



"What? Mr. Gordon, your paintings have always been expressive!" Frieda's voice cut in sharply. "Don't let a few words from her shake your confidence. We all know your work's value. Trust yourself." She'd seen Davin's expression change and panicked. If he started taking Eliana seriously, it would make Frieda look like an ignorant fool-especially after she'd just called Eliana a country bumpkin who didn't understand art.



She couldn't let Eliana's opinion stick with him.



"Enough." Davin's tone was firm. "I'm not doubting myself because of her. I've felt something was wrong for a while now. She simply helped me see it clearly.Please step aside-I need to thank this young lady properly."



"No, don't listen to her." Frieda blocked him outright,desperation flashing across her face.



If Davin thanked Eliana in front of everyone, Frieda would never live it down. Everyone would think she was the one who didn't understand art. She couldn't let that happen.



She turned to Eliana, voice edged with challenge."If you're so skilled at painting that even Mr. Gordon's work doesn't impress you, then why haven't I ever heard of you in the art world?"



Eliana had been calmly studying Davin's painting.



But now, she turned toward Frieda with a look of amusement and mild mockery. "Who says I'm not in the art world?" The change in angle revealed her petite, delicate features. Davin's eyes widened-bright and alive again.



Recognition hit him. He knew her.



His beard quivered, but for a moment, he couldn't speak.



Frieda didn't notice his reaction. She laughed, smug and dismissive. "Eliana, you're delusional. My family collects masterpieces from renowned artists. If you had any reputation in the art world, I would have heard of you."



Frieda was certain that she had never heard of Eliana's name in the art world.



"It's not surprising you haven't," Eliana said evenly."I don't paint under my real name."



Frieda's brow arched. "Oh? Then what name do you use?" she scoffed.



"Riley," Eliana replied.


The name dropped like a stone in still water-instantly sending ripples through the crowd.


"Riley? The legendary painter?"


"She's actually Riley? No wonder her critique made sense to Mr. Gordon." "Oh my God... we're actually meeting Riley? This trip was absolutely worth it!"


Even those who weren't Davin's fans surged closer at the name.



"Riley? Is Riley really here?"



"Quick! Let me see!"



"Don't push me!"



Even if they were not all Davin's fans, they all adored Riley. Riley's work was unmatched in this era, but she was famously elusive-rarely releasing paintings and never appearing in public. They all wanted to catch a glimpse of him.



Rocco,standing nearby, stared at Eliana in shock. He knew the name well. Tristan admired Riley more than any other artist.


Tristan went out of his way to buy all the paintings Riley released on the market, paying above market price. And it turned out, Riley was Eliana?


Rocco's expression shifted with mixed emotions,but his gaze on Eliana didn't waver. He'd once thought she wasn't good enough for Tristan, but since Tristan didn't mind, he'd kept his mouth shut. After all, what mattered most was Tristan's taste, not his own. But now, his opinion had taken a complete turn. Eliana wasn't just a skilled doctor-she was also gifted with a paintbrush.



The discovery left him itching to run straight to Tristan with the intriguing news.


Across the way, Frieda's face darkened as she watched everyone buying into Eliana's words and rushing over to her.



She refused to believe it.



Her hands curled into fists, and at last, she snapped,her voice ringing out, "Everyone, calm down! Don't let her fool you! There's no way she's Riley!"


Her outburst doused the crowd's excitement like a bucket of cold water.



Murmurs rippled through the onlookers as doubt crept back in.



Someone finally asked outright, "You're saying you're Riley-do you have any proof?"



"Yeah," another chimed in, "I've never seen Riley in person, but I've heard in the art scene that Riley's a man."



"Right! And I heard Riley's quite old. You're young, and a woman... why should we believe you?" others echoed.



Frieda's lips curled in triumph. At last, people were thinking straight.


Believing Eliana on a few words alone would have been downright foolish.


She was glad there were still some sensible heads in the crowd.


She stepped forward, spearheading the attack."You claim you're Riley? Then prove it! If you can't, I should call the police right now and have you arrested for impersonation and attempted fraud!"


"No point talking to her," someone added. "Riley's paintings are priceless. She's obviously trying to scam us!"



"Call the police! Have her arrested!" another voice joined in.


Some people immediately pulled out their phones,ready to call the police.


Others closed in around Eliana, forming a tight ring to block any chance of escape.



Just then, Tristan arrived. He'd come to see what the fuss was about, with Doran close behind. The last thing he expected was to find Eliana at the center of the uproar-surrounded, shouted at, and accused from every direction.
###Chapter 65 | Dare Anyone To Lay A Finger On Her
Tristan had been wondering which fool dared to stir up trouble on his territory.



But now, watching Eliana trapped within the hostile circle, every muscle in his spine coiled tight.


His handsome features, moments before carved in indifference, hardened into ice as his gaze pierced through the mob surrounding Eliana.



Raw fury crashed through him like wildfire,threatening to shatter the iron control he maintained over his emotions.



Before Doran could react, Tristan launched himself toward the gathering storm of people.



However, before he could do anything, a weathered yet commanding voice boomed across the chaos, "I dare anyone to call the police!"



The voice belonged to Davin.



Though he had studied under Riley-Eliana's secret identity-her demanding schedule had kept them apart for over a year. Now, seeing her again, his heart  hammered with overwhelming joy.



The rush of emotion had struck his chest like a physical blow, paralyzing him when she first faced their accusations.



Now,with the crushing weight lifted from his chest,he shoved through the crowd and planted himself like a shield before Eliana. "I dare anyone to lay a finger on her!"



Tristan froze mid-stride, his intended words stolen from his lips.



Shock rippled through the gathered crowd alike.Bewilderment painted their faces as they struggled to understand why Davin would champion Eliana. After all,she had torn apart his work and stood accused of masquerading as Riley.



Frieda broke the stunned silence first. "Mr. Gordon,why are you defending her?"



Had Davin lost his mind? Or did Eliana's beauty cloud his judgment? The questions swirled through Frieda's confused thoughts.



Several onlookers remembered Davin's public declaraton that Riley served as his teacher.


Voices rose in agreement with Frieda. "Exactly. Mr.Gordon, why defend someone who mocked your  teacher?"



Rage coursed through Davin's trembling frame.Yet his stooped shoulders squared with remarkable dignity.His tolerance shattered completely as he roared above their voices, "Have you all lost your minds? She impersonated no one. She's Riley-the real Riley,my teacher!"



His declaration crashed into absolute silence.



The revelation struck everyone speechless, Tristan included.



He had harbored suspicions that Eliana was Riley-her handwriting mirrored Riley's too perfectly to ignore.But the universal assumption that Riley was male had buried those doubts quickly.



Now Davin had shattered that assumption with his public revelation.



Tristan's white-knuckled fists gradually relaxed. He realized the hero's role had been claimed by another.Relief and disappointment warred within him in equal measure. A smile crept across his lips without his permission.



Frieda's eyes bulged with shock. Eliana as Riley? The notion seemed impossible!



Her voice cracked as she stammered, "Mr. Gordon, are  you certain? Did I mishear you?"


Davin fixed Frieda with a withering stare. Had she not obstructed his view, he would have recognized Eliana immediately.



He had always held her in the highest reverence,despite the decades that separated their ages.


When Frieda dared question Eliana's identity, his face transformed into a mask of outrage. "Though age has dimmed my eyes, I'm not so decrepit that I cannot recognize my own teacher! I stake my entire reputation on this truth-she is Riley, the legendary painter!"



Davin's fierce endorsement silenced every skeptical voice.


After all, Davin himself had spoken. No one would gamble their reputation on a lie.


Yet disbelief lingered-Riley, a woman? And so remarkably young?



"A year has passed since I last saw my teacher, and with you guysblocking my view, I failed to recognize her immediately. That failure rests on my shoulders alone. But anyone who questions her identity now questions my honor!" Davin declared with unwavering conviction. Nervous glances ricocheted through the crowd.



At that moment, Larry Craig, the exhibition's curator,burst through the crowd after hearing the disturbance.



The instant his gaze found Eliana,his eyes blazed with recognition, and he fought through the crowd to reach her, dropping into a respectful bow.



His words tumbled out in breathless excitement,"Far too long, Riley! Why didn't you announce your visit?would have rolled out the red carpet myself!"


If Davin's revelation had been a bombshell, Larry's confirmation struck like lightning.



Two titans of the art world acknowledging Eliana as Riley sealed her identity beyond question.



Doubt evaporated like morning mist.



Apologies erupted from the crowd like a dam bursting.



"Forgive us, Riley. We were blind to your identity."



"My ignorance shames me. Please accept my apologies."


"Your youth caught us all off guard. We were fools!Please forgive us!"


 
Each apology struck Frieda like a physical blow,her  face burning with crushing humiliation.



The truth hit her like a sledgehammer-Eliana was actually Riley.



She had dug deep into Eliana's background, collecting every scrap of information Leyla offered.


According to her intelligence, Eliana was nothing more than a rural nobody the Murrays had dragged back to the city-uneducated and unremarkable.


Reality had just delivered a devastating blow to her assumptions.



Frieda's thoughts turned venomous toward Leyla-how dare she withhold the truth that despite Eliana's humble origins, she commanded national fame as Riley, a master of oil painting.


Had Leyla revealed this truth earlier, she reasoned bitterly, this public humiliation could have been avoided entirely.



While the crowd surged forward in their newfound worship,clamoring for photos with Eliana, Frieda ground her teeth in raw jealousy and began her silent retreat.



A sharp command cut through her escape. "Stop right there!" Rocco's voice rang with authority.



He had stood guard over Eliana, ready to shield her from the mob's rage.Now, with her safety secured, his hunter's gaze locked onto Frieda.


Frieda froze mid-step, her spine turning to steel as she lifted her chin.



Within heartbeats, Rocco materialized in front of her like a shadow given form.



Frieda's brow furrowed as she demanded, "What do you want?"


Riley or not, Frieda refused to tolerate disrespect from a mere bodyguard.


She was, after all, a Larson-heiress to an empire.


Rocco's steel-gray eyes bored into her soul, his voice dropping to arctic temperatures. "You poisoned this crowd with lies, nearly destroying Ms. Murray's reputation in the process. Did you honestly believe you could simply walk away unscathed?"
###Chapter 66 You Truly Surprised Me
Frieda had never once treated Rocco with an ounce of respect.


Curling her lip, she scoffed disdainfully, "So tell me-what exactly do you want?"


Rocco's voice came back steady and cold.	"An apology."


Earlier, everyone who had doubted Eliana's identity had already offered their apologies.


Yet the very one who had started the whole mess-Frieda-refused to show the slightest hint of regret.



If not for her deliberate provocation, no one would have questioned who Eliana was in the first place.



At his demand, Frieda let out a sharp laugh dripping with scorn. "You think you can force me to apologize?For what, exactly? I didn't do anything wrong.Everyone else doubted Eliana was Riley at the beginning,too. Now the truth's out-end of story. As for you, you're not qualified to make me apologize!Get the hell out of my way before I completely snap!" Rocco's brows drew tight with disgust. He had never encountered a woman so outrageously shameless.


She stirred up chaos, refused to apologize, and carried herself as though she wasn't the one at fault. How could she show such appalling audacity? The fury building in his chest pushed him to speak.



But before he could, a deep, cutting voice slid from behind him. "He might not have the right to demand an apology-so what about me?"


Rocco spun at once. Tristan stood there, gaze locked on Frieda, his face hard as carved stone.



Frieda whipped toward the voice, only to meet Tristan's glacial stare. Her blood seemed to drain in an instant, her palms dampening with a nervous sweat.



This was the first time she had ever been this close to him.



Yet the moment was nothing like the dazzling encounter she had once dreamed of.


Tristan up close was no longer the man who once made her pulse race-he was a figure that sent a shiver of dread down her spine.



His eyes were like shards of ice, and the weight of his gaze made her throat tighten. She instinctively swallowed the lump in her throat,her voice quaking as she stammered a greeting, "Mr.Pearson..."



Once upon a time, she had fantasized about speaking to him face-to-face. Now that it had come true,her tongue felt clumsy, and her fear stole the rest of her words.



Tristan advanced, his polished shoes clicking softly against the floor, and stopped just half a step from her. "I'll ask you this-he may not have the right to demand an apology, but do l?"



Being confronted by the man she had admired for so long left Frieda humiliated, more so because he was openly defending Eliana-the woman she loathed most.



Her fear twisted into resentment, burning hot beneath her skin, and she forced out a shaky protest. "Mr.Pearson,I...I admit I might've spoken too harshly, but ...”



Tristan shut her down harshly, unwilling to tolerate even a shred of her excuses. "I'll make this simple.You either apologize to Eliana on your own,or I'll have my men pin you down until you beg for her forgiveness."


 
Frieda's complexion turned ghostly white, though she  forced herself to feign composure. "Mr. Pearson,perhaps you don't know who I am. My dad owns the Larson Group. I've heard your Pearson Group is interested in partnering with our Larson Group on a major project?"



A thin smile curved Tristan's lips, cold and humorless."Oh, so you're a Larson. In that case, go home and tell your dad the deal is off," he declared sharply.



Frieda's heart lurched violently-she hadn't expected him torisk a business alliance for Eliana's sake.



With her family's interests on the line, she had no choice but to choke down her pride. Biting her lip,she choked the words out. "I'll apologize. Please don't cancel the collaboration."



Tristan offered no reply, his jaw tight as he flicked his chin toward Eliana, ordering Frieda to apologize without a word.



Tension drained from Frieda's shoulders as relief set in.She loathed the thought of bowing her head, but her family's interests outweighed her own pride.


Under Tristan's glacial stare, she forced her steps toward Eliana.



Eliana, drained from fending off waves of insincere apologies all day, instinctively furrowed her brows when Frieda drew near. "What now?" she asked, her  tone edged with weariness.



That impatient look nearly made Frieda snap, but she swallowed her fury. Grinding her teeth, she forced the words out.



"I judged you wrongly before. I... apologize. I'm sorry."


Eliana's brow arched, genuine surprise flickering across her face.



She clearly hadn't imagined Frieda would ever lower her head so quickly.



The flicker of Tristan's gaze brushed the edge of her vision, and in that instant, Eliana grasped the situation.


"Keep your apology-I don't want it. From now on,stay the hell away from me. I don't ever want you in my sight again," she stated with a casual shrug.



The remark made Frieda's face twist with bitterness.How on earth could Eliana dismiss her even after she'd forced herself to apologize?


Before Frieda could snap back, an icy shiver crawled up her spine. She didn't have to turn around to know Tristan's eyes were still on her.



Forcing down her fury, she inhaled sharply and said through clenched teeth, "I understand. I spoke out of turn earlier. I'll take my leave now." Not daring to linger another second, she hurried out of the exhibition hall.



She had walked in with confidence, but left carrying nothing but humiliation and defeat.



The moment Frieda walked out, Tristan signaled Doran to clear the gawkers before striding over to Eliana.


He said with a teasing glint, "I didn't realize you were not only a famed doctor but also a celebrated artist.You've managed to surprise me again. Makes me wonder how many more secrets you're keeping."



Pressing her lips Together Eliana remarked, "There's more than you can imagine that you don't know."



A faint smile tugged at his mouth. "Is that so? Then I'll enjoy uncovering those little mnysteries one at a time."



Her gaze hardened as she countered, "Don't waste your time. Once I've repaid what I owe you, there won't be anything left between us."


His expression soured at that, though he quickly shifted the subject.



"I understand your wish to stay out of the spotlight.I've already made it clear to the others that your identity is not to be discussed. No one here will mention Riley." Relief washed over her, tempered by the uncomfortable awareness that she was now indebted to him again.



Sensing her unease, he said smoothly, "Don't trouble yourself over that. I won't be collecting on this favor."



Her eyebrows drew together as the words slipped out."And what exactly do you mean by that?"



"Nothing at all," Tristan replied smoothly. "The exhibition's about to begin. Come on-time for you to step into your role as my date. A few of the guests l invited are eager to meet you." He offered his arm with a practiced gesture.



She let his words hang in the air.



Getting to close to a man who already had a girlfriend wasn't something she'd tolerate, and linking arms with him felt far too intimate.



She stayed rooted beside him, refusing the offer without a word.



Tristan didn't push the matter. Instead, he strode toward the conference hall, and she followed in step.



Behind them, Davin and Larry instinctively made to trail after. But Tristan caught their movement, his eyes flicking toward Rocco in silent command.He had no intention of letting anyone else hover too close-especially when it came to Eliana.



Rocco grasped the intention immediately, raising a hand to halt them. "Stay put. The exhibition's about to officially open, and I'd like everyone ready for the upcoming oil painting competition."


Davin barely cared about the contest anymore. His eyes lit up as he blurted, "Everything's already in place.I just want a quick word with my teacher..."



It wasn't often he ran into her, and countless questions pressed at his lips.



Larry, sharper than his companion, noticed Tristan leading Eliana away himself.Interrupting now would be reckless.



He quickly  tugged Davin back and insisted, "Mr.Gordon, Riley isn't leaving just yet. Let's get through the competition first-I still need to go over the final judging plan with you."


Without waiting for more protest, he steered Davin firmly into the private room behind the main exhibition hall.


At the same time, Leyla reappeared in the main hall,  freshly touched up after her trip to the restroom.
###Chapter 67 Determined To Change Her Mind
Leyla had just wrapped up her discussion with Davin about the competition's process and took the chance to probe him about the other participants.



When she learned they were mostly nobodies, her confidence soared. She bid Davin a brief farewell and headed for the restroom to touch up her makeup.



Davin had mentioned that Tristan himself would be presenting the award to the first place once the results were in.



That alone was enough to stir her ambition. Sure,Tristan's obvious favoritism toward Eliana annoyed her,but it wasn't enough to keep her from wanting to leave a good impression on him.



Everyone acted out of self-interest in the end, and gaining Tristan's favor sat rightat the top of her list.



And if she did catch his eye? Well,then Hector would serve as a convenient backup.



Hector's family had never liked her, and if she married him,it would mean endless family strife. But Tristan's family? That was a different story. Elbert supposedly didn't have long left, and Joanne had passed away years ago.



If Leyla married Tristan, she would be the sole mistress of the household-no mother-in-law,no meddling relatives.



Of course, these were only thoughts she kept to herself.



Whether it would work out was uncertain, but trying cost nothing.



Because of this little fantasy, she lingered in the restroom, fussing with her appearance, and completely missed the scene where Eliana revealed her identity as Riley.



She also had no clue that Davin, the man she admired,was actually Eliana's student.


When Leyla finally stepped out, Hector still hadn't arrived. She wandered around, searching for him,but found neither Hector nor Davin. So she decided to look for Frieda instead.



One lap around the venue and still nothing. Her frown deepened. Where on earth had Frieda gone?


Pulling her phone from her bag, she dialed Frieda's number. The call was rejected outright.


She shrugged it off at first, assuming Frieda was busy nearby.


But after a few minutes without spotting her, she tried again.



This time, Frieda picked up.



Before Leyla could speak, Frieda's voice came through the phone, sharp and brimming with anger. "Why are you calling me again? I don't want to talk to you anymore!"


Frieda was still seething. If Leyla hadn't hidden the fact that Eliana was actually Riley,she wouldn't have been humiliated today. She wouldn't have offended Tristan. And her family's cooperation with the Pearson Group wouldn't be hanging by a thread.


She was so angry that she had declined the first call.



But after Leyla's second attempt, the ringing became too much, and Frieda answered-though her frustration bled through every word.



Leyla blinked at the outburst, tamping down her irritation. "Frieda, what's wrong?"



Frieda laughed coldly. "You have the nerve to ask me that?" Leyla's patience thinned. Without her, Frieda wouldn't have even set foot in the exhibition. How could she be so rude to her now?



But she swallowed the retort and asked instead,"What happened? Who got you so worked up?


"Who else? Eliana Murray!" Frieda snapped.



"Eliana?" Leyla's brows drew together.



"I want to know," Frieda continued through clenched teeth, "why you hid her exceptional painting talent from me."



For a moment, Leyla stared blankly at the wall, then gave a short laugh. "Frieda, you must be mistak<en.She's just a country bumpkin. Exceptional talent in painting? Don't make me laugh."


Then something occurred to her, and her eyes narrowed."Wait-did she tell you that?"


"Of course." Frieda snapped,her tone icy.


"You've been fooled," Leyla said with confidence."She lies through her teeth. Not a word she says is true.How could you believe her?"



Frieda froze at the other end. Did that mean Leyla truly didn't know Eliana was the legendary Riley? With that in mind, she tentatively asked, "Why do you think Eliana is lying?"



"Because this isn't her first time," Leyla said. "Just last week,she claimed she was some renowned doctor."



She still believed that Miguel's recovery had been nothing but blind luck-Eliana stumbling into the right place at the right time.


Hearing no response, Leyla assumed Frieda was realizing the truth and was simply too angry to speak.So she pressed on. "From now on, don't believe a word Eliana says. Just trust me."


Frieda almost laughed. To her, Leyla's arrogance was both ridiculous and pathetic.



She opened her mouth to tell her the truth but stopped. If Leyla hadn't misled her, she wouldn't have been thrown out in disgrace today.



No-let her find out the hard way.


"Whether I believe her or not doesn't matter anymore,"Frieda said coolly. "I have something urgent to do,so I gotta go. Take care."



She hung up without another word.



They had never been real friends. Frieda's humiliation had been bitter, and she wasn't about to save Leyla from the same fate. She wanted Leyla to be embarrassed as well. The thought alone eased her temper.



Leyla stared at the screen, her irritation bubbling over.How could Frieda be so ungrateful? She had brought her to the exhibition, and this was the thanks she got?Was it because she wasn't a Murray anymore?


If she'd known Frieda was this type of person, she'd have brought someone else. She regretted her choice now. There had been no shortage of people begging her for an invitation earlier today. Too late now.



Shoving the phone back in her bag, Leyla opened her photo album.



Inside were dozens of Carl's paintings-images she'd quietly snapped.



Today's competition allowed free expression,the only rule being that it had to be in oil paint.


Perfect. Carl excelled at oil painting. All Leyla needed to do was memorize one of his works and reproduce it.



She began scrolling, carefully selecting her choice.


Meanwhile, Tristan was leading Eliana toward the  conference hall.



He couldn't help glancing at her profile-flawless,every angle as captivating as the last.



At first, it had been her resemblance to the girl who once helped him that caught his attention.



But after seeing her heal with skill and fight with precision, his interest had shifted into something deeper.



Now, knowing she was Riley-his favorite artist in Esaton-his admiration had only grown.



She was like a treasure chest, always revealing something new each time he thought he'd figured her out.



The problem was, her attitude toward him had cooled since the Fist Guild incident.



He didn't know what had caused the shift, but he wasn't angry. If anything, it made him more determined to change her mind.



He had never gone out of his way to please anyone before. As the head of the Pearson Group, he certainly didn't need to. Winning someone over was uncharted territory for him.



So,he relied on instinct. "I really like you... I mean, your paintings," Tristan finally managed,after much thought.
###Chapter 68 His Fiancée



Eliana was startled by Tristan's sudden comment.


But then, she relaxed when she realized he was only talking about her paintings. "Thank you," she said simply.



"Honestly, I never imagined Riley could be a woman.Even more surprising-you're Riley," Tristan remarked.



Eliana shrugged. "Painting's just a hobby. I've never really mentioned it to anyone."



If Frieda's stunt today hadn't happened, she wouldn't have revealed her identity at all.



"But who taught you to paint?" Tristan asked, curious.



Eliana gave him a sideways glance. "You seem to enjoy digging into people's backgrounds."



"Just curious," he replied easily.



"Curiosity killed the cat. Haven't you heard of the old saying?" Eliana asked.



"Fortunately, I'm not a cat," he said with a smirk



She let that one go. There were things she didn't plan on telling anyone-not



even Seth or Kathy-like who her mentor was.



Some secrets were better kept to herself. If it was made public, she could be considered a freak.



So she changed the subject. "Where exactly are we going?"



They had already left the main conference area,walking down a quieter corridor lined with closed doors. The carpet beneath their feet was thick,patterned in intricate swirls.



Although Eliana had designed the building, it was her first time visiting it.


Tristan stopped and looked at her. "To help me out-as my companion," he said casually.



Her brow furrowed. "What does that mean?"



"There are plenty of guests here today, but the ones who really matter are in this area. I need you to fend someone off for me."



"I'm still not following."



"You'll understand soon enough. When the time comes, just play along," he said as he stopped in front of a door.



He pushed open the door.



With a soft click, the door swung open.



Eliana looked up and found herself staring into a spacious living room, light streaming in from a massive floor-to-ceiling window. Well-dressed men and women clustered in small groups, chatting over drinks.


Out of all the faces,she recognized only one-Hector,Leyla's boyfriend.



Judging by the way he was running around with a coffee pot,his standing here wasn't all that impressive.



"The coffee beans here aren't a the best," Hector said with a respectful smile as he handed a cup to a middle -aged man. "Mayor Oliver, since you enjoy coffee, I'll invite you and your daughter to Galaxy Café sometime.They have a much better brew."



Rupert nodded politely. "Sure. I've heard of that place,but never been there. I'm swamped with a critical case right now-no time to slip away."


Hector's brows lifted. "Is this case tied to the previous mayor?"



He was clearly hinting at Sheldon Torres. That scandal even implicated Louis. Rupert ignored him, turning instead to a short-haired young woman at his side. "Celine, if you're free, go have coffee with Hector. If it's good, bring back some beans for me."



Celine nodded eagerly. "Alright, Dad."



Just then, the door opened wider and Tristan stepped in with Eliana.



Their arrival drew every eye in the room.



Celine Oliver's eyes lit up at the sight of Tristan-until she noticed Eliana beside him. Her expression tightened instantly.



"Tristan, you're finally here," a man near the door said with a smile, walking over. "I heard there was a commotion outside. What happened?"



"Just a misunderstanding. It's handled," Tristan replied smoothly.



"That's good. We were about to come check." The man appeared relieved.



"No need. Really, it was nothing."



The man's eyes shifted to Eliana. "And this is..."


Before she could answer, Tristan slipped his hand into hers. "This is my fiancée, Eliana Murray." Eliana's first instinct was to pull back, but Tristan's grip only tightened, leaving her no choice but to play along.



She shot him a quick look, catching on to whatever game he was playing.


Suppressing a sigh, she decided to play along.


She owed him, after all. There was no way out of it.



The man's brows rose in surprise.



But he quickly regained his composure and greeted Eliana warmly, "Pleasure to meet you, Ms. Murray.Tristan's mentioned a fiancée before, but we didn't believe him. Now I see why he locked it down so early -if I were him, I'd have done the same. You're such a beauty."



Eliana forced a polite smile, about to respond when Tristan's voice cut in-cool and sharp. "Mr. Miller,you're pushing fifty. Maybe skip those kinds of jokes."


The jab was veiled in humor, but the chill underneath was unmistakable.



Percy Miller's smile faltered. He opened his mouth to explain,but Tristan was already steering Eliana toward Rupert. "Mayor Oliver,let me introduce-"



"I heard. No need to repeat," Rupert interrupted,his tone frosty.



Beside him, Celine's face had gone pale.



Eliana didn't need an explanation.



When Tristan said he needed her help, she thought it might be something serious.


Turns out, she was here to block his admirer. He could've warned her.



Her irritation spiked. She dug her nails into his hand,hard.



Tristan didn't so much as flinch,still wearing that calm,unbothered smile.



"That's not right. Introductions should be done properly. This is my fiancée, Eliana Murray. Eliana, this is Mayor Rupert Oliver."



Eliana wasn't the type to butter up someone who clearly disliked her-not even for show.



She gave a brief nod. "Hello."


 
Rupert's expression darkened further. Sensing the tension, others hurried to change the subject,drawing Rupert into safer conversation.


Tristan guided Eliana to an empty chair and poured her a cup of coffee himself. "Sit. Have some coffee and snacks. No need to be formal-everyone here knows each other.


She offered him a stiff smile and took the cup.



Soon,Tristan was pulled into a separate discussion.



Eliana, knowing she was almost invisible in this setting,stayed quiet and sipped her coffee.



Hector had remarked earlier that the coffee was stale,but to her, it was pleasant-mellow, with the faintest sweet aftertaste.



"Excuse me-your last name's Murray, isn't it?" a woman's voice suddenly came from beside her.
###Chapter 69 Playing The Victim



Eliana turned toward the voice.



Right-Celine Oliver. Rupert's daughter.



The very same woman Tristan had asked her to help keep at arm's length.



Eliana hated situations like this one.



Once, a guy from the Onyx Syndicate had begged her to pretend to be his girlfriend just to shake off a clingy admirer.



It had worked-the woman left him alone-but then the trouble had landed squarely on Eliana instead.That had only ended when Eliana got tired of the nonsense and took matters into her own hands.



Now here she was again, walking straight into déjà vu.Her first instinct had been to say no. But she owed Tristan, and she'd promised to help.



If she'd known she had to help him get rid of an admirer, she'd have told him to forget it. She would have preferred to repay him in some other way. Now, she could only hope Celine wasn't the unreasonable sort.



Meeting Celine's gaze, Eliana gave a polite nod. "Yeah,I'm Eliana Murray."


Celine let out a drawn-out, almost amused,"Alright,"and slid into the seat beside her.



"My dad's been working nonstop on a case lately," she began.'"It involves someone with the last name Murray... I wonder if that person might be related to you,Ms.Murray?"



Eliana's eyelids twitched. "What's his name?"


Celine held her gaze deliberately. "Louis Murray.Chairman of the Murray Group."



Eliana's grip on her coffee cup tightened.



Her silence was all the confirmation Celine needed-or at least thought she needed. But she kept going anyway, voice syrupy sweet. "The surname Murray isn't exactly common, especially among Qidence.I was just curious, so I asked. I hope you don't mind."


"I don't mind," Eliana replied evenly.


"And Louis... is he related to you?" Celine pressed.



Eliana didn't bother dodging it. "He's my father." Celine's brows arched. She'd suspected, sure-but hearing it out loud still made her pause. Not because Louis was Eliana's father, but because Tristan was engaged to Louis's daughter.



Everyone in Qidence knew the Murrays were in shambles. Louis was facing sentencing any day now.


In Celine's mind, Tristan was far too shrewd to actually marry into that mess.



She assumed he was just temporarily dazzled-after all, Eliana was undeniably beautiful.


Outwardly, Celine's face stayed warm and pleasant.She reached over to take Eliana's hand, wearing a smile that didn't touch her eyes "I'm sorry, Eliana. I didn't mean to stir anything up-it just felt like such a coincidence.I didn't expect..."


Eliana calmly pulled her hand back. "No need to apologize. You didn't know."



Celine nodded, then-just as quickly-took her hand again. "Now that we've met, we're friends. I'll mention your dad's case to my dad. Maybe we can help...within legal limits, of course."



Her lips curved kindly, but there wvas a chill in her gaze.


Eliana's expression iced over. She yanked her hand  away and narrowed her eyes at her. "Let me make one thing clear-l've got a temper. If anyone dares to mess with me, my family, or my friends, I won't let it slide."



Celine blinked, taken aback. "Have you got the wrong idea? I'm being sincere here. I said that because I care."


"Then I'll pretend I heard nothing," Eliana said evenly."And you'd better act like you know nothing either.Otherwise, I won't hesitate to take action."



Celine's face crumpled into an even more aggrieved expression. "Eliana, you've really misunderstood me.I feel a connection with you, and I genuinely want to be friends. I have no ill intentions-I'd never mess with you,your family, or your friends..."



She suddenly leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper right by Eliana's ear. "I think you understand me perfectly. You've got two choices-either break up with Tristan right now, or I'll have your dad do it for you. What do you think?"



Her tone was heavy with threat.



But before Celine could blink, Eliana suddenly-tipped her coffee cup-splashing the drink all over herself.


The coffee wasn't hot,bout Eliana still cried out in pain,tears instantly welling and spilling down her cheeks Tristan's head snapped toward her. The moment he saw her crying, he crossed the room in long strides."What happened?"



Eliana kept her gaze fixed on Celine. Her voice trembled as she spoke. "Ms. Oliver, I know you like Tristan, but how could you... not only splash coffee on me, but threaten me with my father's case?"


Celine froze, caught off guard by the accusation.


A faint, cold smile flashed in Eliana's eyes. If Celine wanted to act, she would match her scene for scene.After all, she was here to put on a performance-and she didn't mind adding an extra act.


"Celine, what's going on?" Rupert's voice cut through the tension as he approached, his expression grim.


One by one, the others in the room gathered around.


"She splashed coffee on herself and accused me of it!"Celine ground out through clenched teeth.


Rupert's gaze sharpened on Eliana. "Ms. Murray, you do realize slander is a criminal offense?"



As Eliana's tears flowed even more freely. Her voice trembled as she turned pleading eyes to Tristan. "1didn't slander her... She whispered to me that if l didn't break up with you, she'd have her father go after mine. I refused, and then she splashed coffee on me. Tristan, you have to believe me. If you don't,we can check the surveillance!"



She had already noticed when she walked in that there were no cameras in the room.



With the kind of people present here, surveillance was deliberately avoided.


"I didn't do it! You're lying! I won't let you get away with this!" The gentle mask Celine had worn earlier was gone,replaced by raw fury.



Eliana flinched, curling closer to Tristan as if seeking protection. "Tristan, I can take her bullying and slandering me-but please don't let her hurt my father..."



Her tear-streaked face was the picture of delicate beauty, tugging at the heartstrings of everyone watching.



Tristan's expression frosted, his eyes glinting with an icy resolve.



He gently took Eliana's hand-the supposedly scalded one-and said in a low, steady voice, "Don't worry.I won't let anyone touch you or your father."



Then he looked over his shoulder. "Doran,take Eliana and treat her hand." "Understood!" Doran stepped forward without delay,moving to shield Eliana from the crowd. "Ms. Murray,please,this way."
###Chapter 70 Rupert Apologized



Uncertainty clouded Eliana's features, but Rocco gave her a reassuring nod. "You don't need to worry. Mr.Pearson and I can handle things from here. Go take care of that burn."



Relief, faint but real, flickered across Eliana's face as she let Doran lead her away. Every few steps, she glanced back, clearly reluctant to go.



Watching Eliana retreat only fueled Celine's growing rage.



Scheming had always been Celine's specialty, yet somehow the tables had turned, leaving her looking foolish in front of everyone-all because of Eliana,whom she'd never taken seriously.



Boiling over,Celine lost her composure and screamed,"You're not going anywhere! Get back here and clear my name!"


Momentum carried her forward, ready to chase Eliana down, but Rupert's hand clamped onto her arm and held her in place. A harsh yank pulled her back. "Stay put!" Eyes wide with shock, Celine spun to face her father."Dad, are you doubting me now? You really believe that bumpkin instead of your own daughter?"


Before Rupert could gather a reply, Tristan moved in with cool confidence,cutting off the moment.



"Mayor Oliver, you owe me answers. Your daughter has been mistreating my fiancée. If word gets out,how do you expect me to protect my reputation?" he said,voice sharp.



A storm gathered behind Rupert's eyes as the reality of the situation hit him.



Navigating politics had always come easily, but this kind of direct challenge from someone so much younger was entirely new-and infuriating.



"You-" His instinct was to push back, but the words caught in his throat.



A raised hand from Tristan cut him off before another word could leave his lips. Tristan said coolly, "Let's put my reputation aside, shall we? This mess isn't just my problem-you're the one in hot water if this goes public. As mayor, you're supposed to set an example.If people find out your daughter's been throwing your name around to scare people, your bosses upstairs won't be happy. You know that as well as I do." A few carefully chosen words from Tristan left Rupert reeling, his confidence knocked sideways.


People whispered that Tristan was young, but everyone knew he could take complaints to the top with a single call.



That understanding crept across Rupert's face,darkening his mood. The threat was clear. No comeback would save him now.



Inside the crowd, some faces like Hector's lingered hopefully,angling for Rupert's approval.


Even so, a larger group began drifting toward Tristan's side,eager for any chance to win his favor.


Ripples of agreement moved through the gathering,as more voices chimed in.



"Mayor Oliver, maybe it's time to set some boundaries with your daughter," one person suggested, loud enough for everyone to hear.


"We're all professionals here. It's bad form to drag personal drama into the open," another echoed,glancing around for support.


Others played both sides, dropping flattering remarks that still pushed Rupert into a corner. "Oh, let's not get carried away. He knows better than to let things  get out of hand. He'd never excuse something like this from his daughter. Am I right,Mayor Oliver?"



A storm brewed in Rupert's eyes as he faced the chorus of opinions. "All of you-"


However,when he caught the steely, expectant gazes all around him, any harsh retort died on his tongue.


Steeling himself, he exhaled slowly and looked to Tristan. "You seem to have a better handle on this than anyone, Tristan. What's your suggestion for settling things?"


Without hesitation, Tristan answered, "To start, an apology from Ms. Oliver seems fair."



Rage threatened to boil over in Celine, her temples pulsing with frustration. "I've told you already! I did not throw coffee at her! I'm not about to say sorry for something I didn't do."


Tristan's eyes narrowed, curiosity coloring his voice."Are you sure about that? You all call Eliana a country girl-simple, honest, the kind who stops to help a stranger on the street. Lying just isn't in her nature."


Earlier, Celine had mocked Eliana's rural upbringing,so Tristan decided to turn those words back on her,probing with a measured tone.



Stunned for a split second, Celine's expression grew  stormy, but she refused to back down. "That wasn't me! | wouldn't throw coffee at her with half the city watching. I'm not reckless."



Advancing a step, Tristan refused to let her off the hook. "Is that really the story you're sticking to?"


Hand pressed to her chest, Celine insisted, "I give you my word-I did nothing wrong!"



A low, amused laugh escaped Tristan. "If that's how you want it, I'll accept this as nothing more than a misunderstanding. Eliana isn't one to carry grudges over something so trivial. However..."


Switching to a more deliberate tone, Tristan continued,"You know, h entire world revolves around her family.She might joke about little things, but she'd never lie about something as serious as her father's troubles.According to her, you dangled Mr. Murray's predicament over her head. Are you really going to claim she made that up? In the end, she's just a girl from the countryside-she wouldn't know a mayor from a city councilman, let alone play games with power. The idea that she's inventing this is a stretch,don't you think?"



Celine's posture went rigid, her fists knotting in the fabric of her dress.



With only a moment's hesitation, she forced her  expression back to cool defiance. "That's not true.I never threatened her," she declared,voice flat.



Even so, that split-second flicker of panic didn't escape anyone. The room was full of skilled players;none were fooled by her sudden composure. People exchanged knowing glances.



Tristan didn't miss a beat. "Mayor Oliver, I'm sure you're overwhelmed with public business, but some matters at home require attention too.Words tossed carelessly can bring a world of trouble. You're well aware of that."



A muscle in Rupert's forehead twitched, and he fought to keep his frustration in check.



Jaw clenched, he pinned Celine with a hard look."You're going to apologize to Tristan-right now."



Pride wouldn't let her budge. Not even a crack appeared in her mask. Celine simply stared straight ahead,refusing to give in.



A stubborn glare fixed on her face, Celine retorted,"Absolutely not! I refuse to apologize. Eliana Murry is making all of this up!"



Anger threatened to boil over.Knowing how much the Murray family meant to Eliana, she quietly hatched a plan-maybe she could convince her dad to make Louis's time behind bars even harder, just to get even. Rupert's patience ran thin. "I'm not asking again.Apologize-now!"


Frustration and wounded pride tangled in Celine's voice as she bit down on her words. "I'm telling the truth,Dad.Please don't-"



But Rupert wouldn't let her finish. "If you won't do it,then I will. Clearly, this is on me-I must have failed somewhere as a father for you to act this way."



Turning his attention to Tristan, Rupert straightened his jacket and spoke with a forced smile. "Tristan,let's put this incident behind us for my sake. I'm willing to take responsibility and consider it resolved."


"Dad..." A strangled protest caught in Celine's throat.


Panic flashed in her eyes; having Rupert apologize for her was even more humiliating than doing it herself.



Without giving her a chance to interrupt again, Rupert continued,"To make amends, I'll see that Ms. Murray receives ten times the medical costs, plus something extra for the trouble we've caused. And I'll apologize to her personally."



Rupert lowered his head, humility heavy in his posture.



Across from him,Tristan stayed perfectly composed,offering no sign of forgiveness. "Bankruptcy or not, the Murray family have me behind them now. They won't ever go hungry," he said coolly. "Keep your compensation."



Tristan dismissed Rupert's attempt at an apology with a wave of his hand, and the mayor's expression grew darker by the second.



Yet cornered by circumstance, Rupert had no other cards left to play.



A brand-new mayor couldn't afford to make an enemy of someone like Tristan-his every move was under a microscope.


Searching for a solution, Rupert's voice broke through the tension. "Just tell me what you want, Tristan. How do we put an end to this? Is it an apology you want-or are you expecting me to humble myself right here and now?"



Celine,watching the exchange, could hardly keep her anxiety in check. "Dad,please-"


Rupert cut her off sharply, his patience gone,exclaiming, "Enough out of you! You've made things bad enough already."



Any protest Celine might have made died on her lips,forced into silence by her father's glare.



A small, knowing grin touched Tristan's mouth as he  replied,"No one here expects you to grovel. Eliana would never want to see something so humiliating-she's not that kind of person."



Shadow crept across Rupert's features as he pressed for clarity. "Then tell me, what exactly do you want from us?"



Arching one brow, Tristan answered with calm certainty, "Honestly, Eliana isn't worried about herself.Her main concern is what happens to her father. In light of everything that happened today-if you're hoping to ease her mind and also protect your own standing-there's a straightforward fix. I hope you can step away from his case entirely. Assign it to someone impartial and let them handle it from now on. It's the safest move for everyone, and it spares you any future whispers or doubts about your involvement.Wouldn't you agree that's the best solution?"
###Chapter 71 Ensuring Such Trouble Never Arose Again
Rupert's brows drew together the moment he heard the suggestion.



Stepping away from Louis's case would also mean giving up control of Sheldon's.


Yet the very people who had backed him for the mayor's seat had done so with the goal of taking Sheldon down.



After a pause that seemed to stretch, Rupert snapped,"Impossible! This matter is too significant. I can't just step aside without authority to do so."


Tristan replied calmly, "If it's too much for you,then I'll take it to the higher-ups and request your removal from the case."



The words landed like a blow, making Rupert's pulse jolt. Grinding his teeth, he said stiffly, "There's no need for that. I'll keep my personal affairs separate from my duties."



Tristan's gaze didn't soften as he replied, "Even so,your connection to Celine Oliver makes it hard for me to feel reassured. Perhaps I should call the higher-ups  right now and explain the situation."



He let his hand drift toward his phone, the motion deliberate.



"Hold on!" Rupert's voice broke with urgency.


The possibility of this reaching the top was unthinkable-one leak, and his mayoral seat could be stripped away.


Drawing in several steadying breaths, he measured his options, then gave in. "Fine. I'll step back from the case."



A slow smile curved Tristan's lips. This was the moment he had been waiting for-not a hollow apology, but a binding concession.


He understood perfectly that Eliana cared less about hearing Celine's apology than about ensuring such trouble never arose again.



With a single nod, Tristan said, "In that case, let's consider the matter closed. I trust everyone here will keep today's disagreement to themselves."



Heads nodded all around in quiet agreement.



"We didn't see a thing."



"That's right, we were only here for coffee and a bit of conversation."



Once everyone voiced their agreement, Tristan lifted a hand in acknowledgment. "Then allow me to thank you all on Mayor Oliver's behalf."


Rupert's expression sank another shade darker.


Seeing no reason to stay, he gave a curt farewell.


Tristan, keeping up the appearance of courtesy, said,"There's still a competition later. Wouldn't you like to watch?"



"Absolutely not! I have urgent matters that cannot wait!"Rupert's refusal came swift and sharp.



Tristan gave a short nod. "Fair enough. If that's the case, you'd better hurry and get that withdrawal report sent to the higher-ups..."



The scowl on Rupert's face deepened, and he clamped his mouth shut. Without another word,he grabbed Celine and pulled her toward the back exit of the exhibition hall.



Inside the car, Celine leaned forward, her voice tight with worry. "Dad, are you seriously backing out of the case? If you do, what are you going to tell them? You swore you would-"



Her words were cut short when his palm cracked against her cheek.



The force snapped her head sideways, and for a moment, her vision swarmed with dizzy flickers, her vision swarmed with dizzy flickers.



By the time her senses cleared, Rupert's voice was cold enough to freeze. "You dare question me? This entire mess is on you! If not for your recklessness,how would I be backed into a corner? How would I be forced to abandon the case?"



Her shoulders hunched instinctively under the weight of his anger.


She pressed her teeth into her lip before murmuring,"I swear, I didn't spill coffee on her."


Rupert's mouth twisted into a mocking smile. "And the threats? Are you denying those too?"


The words stole the air from Celine's lungs, and she dropped her gaze without answering.



With a look that said he already knew the truth,Rupert asked, "So, do you finally understand where you went wrong?"


Celine nodded and replied, "I do. I shouldn't have used your name to scare her.I-"


"Wrong!" Rupert cut her off sharply. "That's not the  real issue."



The sudden correction left her frozen in place,confusion clouding her face.If not that,then what?


With his eyes closing for a moment, Rupert said, "You lost your head when it came to Eliana Murray.You thought she was easy to handle, and that arrogance blinded you,letting her set you up."


Celine's fingers curled slowly into her palms.


She had,without a doubt, misjudged Eliana. Never had she imagined Eliana could be so cunning and convincing.



Though disappointment was clear in his tone, there was something else in Rupert's eyes-a trace of disbelief. "You've always been composed,clever,and patient. What happened today? Tristan may be outstanding, with a strong family name and plenty of talent. Men like him are rare. But you've only spoken to him once. Why throw your sense away so easily,giving Eliana the perfect chance to lead you around?"


Still keeping her eyes on the floor,Celine said nothing.


It wasn't true that she'd only met Tristan once.


Since their days in elementary school, their paths had crossed more than once. In those years, they shared the same classroom.



Her looks were different back then, and she was often singled out and picked on for it.



One particularly cruel day pushed her to the edge, and she tried to take her own life-until Tristan stepped in,urging her to hold on. He told her that if she didn't want to be an easy target, she needed to learn to fight back.



From that moment, he was the only glimmer of hope she had during her school years.


Yet now, he had no recognition of her, nor any memory of their shared past.



During the nights when Celine felt she couldn't endure anymore, thoughts of him were the only thing that kept her from breaking.



The moment she found out she would see him today,she poured her heart into her appearance.



Even so, her father's attempts to set them up were brushed aside when Tristan explained that he already had a fiancée.



She assumed at first that it was just an excuse, right up until she saw Tristan approaching with Eliana's hand clasped in his. That sight nearly shattered her ability to keep her emotions in check. It was in that moment that her judgment slipped away entirely.



She had also failed to measure Eliana properly,which led to her being played right into Eliana's hands.


With Celine keeping quiet, Rupert let out a heavy breath. "Enough! This is the first serious misstep you've made all these years. I'll let it go this time, but there will never be a second chance."


Without a word, Celine nodded in agreement. She promised herself she would never let her impulses rule her like that again.



The car merged onto the main road at a steady pace.


After mulling over her words, Celine finally asked,"Does this mean you're truly stepping away from the case?"



"Do you honestly think I have any choice? We've already handed them the upper hand. If I refuse to step away from the case, the fallout will only grow. At worst, I'll take a reprimand now," Rupert answered.



"Are you sure pulling out is the only option we have left?" Celine pressed.


"There's nothing else to be done. I have to remove  myself completely from the matter. If I don't, and something happens to Louis, I'll be the one taking the fall," Rupert explained.



The choice weighed heavily on him, and for once,retreat felt like the only option.



Celine's lips pressed into a thin line.


Reading the unwillingness on her face, Rupert's tone hardened. "You're staying home until this blows over.Don't step outside. When the problem is dealt with,we'll find another solution. Until then, avoid any connection with the Murray family. Even if they insult you to your face,you will endure it."


Celine nodded, her face pale. "Alright."


Elsewhere, Doran guided Eliana into a small resting room.


Since the exhibition hall lacked a medical station,Doran suggested she run cool water over the burn while he went to get ointment.



Eliana flatly refused, "I don't need it."


"That's not an option. If you don't treat it now,you could end up with blisters," Doran said, concerned.


Lifting her hand, Eliana revealed smooth, unmarked skin-no sign of the scald at all.
###Chapter 72 You're Concerned About Me



In the blink of an eye, every trace of grievance, fear,and unease on Eliana's face melted away, leaving behind the cool, composed expression she wore so naturally.



Doran, too honest to mask his reaction, blinked in shock and blurted out, "Wait, were you acting this whole time?"



Without a hint of hesitation,Eliana replied,"Yes.Every bit of it was an act."



"Then I've got to hand it to you-your acting's first-rate." Doran fumbled for words, needing a moment before that line finally came out.


That remark made Eliana lift a brow in mild surprise.



From what she'd seen, she'd assumed everyone working under Tristan was shrewd and calculating.Doran,however,seemed built of simpler stuff.



Before she could say more, the door swung open and Tristan stepped inside.



His expression revealed nothing,his voice even as he  said, "Doran, you can go now."


"Got it!" Doran replied quickly, slipping out and pulling the door shut behind him.



Spotting Rocco on guard outside, Doran grabbed his arm and whispered urgently, "You won't believe this -Ms. Murray was pretending just now!"


"You're only figuring that out now?" Rocco's reply was flat.



"Hold on..." Doran scratched at his head. "You knew the whole time?"



Rocco gave a slow nod.



A wave of frustration hit Doran. "Don't tell me I'm the only one who didn't catch on?"



Another calm nod from Rocco, followed by a firm pat on Doran's shoulder. "Relax. I'll set you up with an appointment at the top brain clinic in Qidence."



"What's that supposed to mean?" Doran asked, his brows knitting.


"Take a wild guess." Rocco's lips curved into a knowing smirk.



It took Doran a long moment to piece it together,only to realize Rocco was calling him dense enough to  actually need that brain check-up.



The insult lit a spark of defiance in him, and for a second, he considered throwing down a challenge right then and there.



"Cut it out before Mr. Pearson hears us. I'm not about to disturb whatever's going on inside," Rocco murmured.



The warning was enough to make Doranswallow his pride,though the sting of humiliation lingered.



After a pause, another thought crept in. He frowned and asked, "Be honest, Rocco-don't you think Ms.Murray is a little too scheming? Can we really trust her around Mr.Pearson?"



Rocco didn't even hesitate. "Why not? He can read people better than anyone. If anything, a woman with brains suits him far more than a foolish one."



Pressing his lips into a thin line, Doran muttered, "If we're talking about that, then I'd say Colleen is also-"



"Stop. Don't bring her up, especially when Ms.Murray's around," Rocco said firmly.



"What's there to worry about? It's not like she can hear us... and I do think Colleen's amazing too," Doran insisted. One sharp look from Rocco was all it took for him to clamp his mouth shut.







Meanwhile, inside the room, the door had barely closed before Tristan got straight to business. "The issue you asked me to handle is resolved. Rupert's agreed to step away from the case entirely."



Eliana took it in without surprise. She'd always known he was perceptive enough to catch her meaning without needing to spell it out.



She nodded. "I appreciate it."



"Let me see your hand," Tristan said suddenly,his voice leaving little room for refusal.


Lifting both hands in mild confusion, Eliana asked,"What's the matter?"



Instead of answering, he reached for her left hand,turning it over in his grasp as if searching for something specific.


Her brows drew together. "What exactly are you checking for?"



"You were splashed with coffee, weren't you?" Tristan asked. The question caught Eliana off guard."Wait-you didn't realize I was faking?"


"Even so, the coffee still hit your skin," Tristan replied,unmoved.



"It wasn't boiling-barely warm, really," she explained.



He ignored the explanation, his eyes scanning her hand with meticulous care. Only after making sure there was no sign of injury did he finally release her.



"Next time you pull something like that, make sure it doesn't actually put you in harm's way. Got it?" His voice carried an unshakable sincerity.



The seriousness in his expression unsettled Eliana more than she cared to admit. She cleared her throat lightly and said, "Alright, I get it... But tell me, will this whole situation end up causing trouble for you?"



Tristan's gaze sharpened. "And which situation do you mean?"



"Mayor Oliver backed down from my father's case,but I'm worried he'll come after you the first chance he gets," Eliana explained



Tristan looked at her intently, the anticipation in his eyes evident. "So, you're concerned about me?" he asked. "Naturally. I don't like dragging other people into my mess," Eliana replied without hesitation.



That answer didn't seem to satisfy him. "If I cared about being dragged in, I never would've played along in the first place," he said with an easy shrug. "Right now, you should be more focused on yourself. Thanks to me, you've got Celine gunning for you, and she's not the forgiving type."



"You think I'm the sort who worries about payback?"Eliana replied with an easy smile.


A faint smile tugged at his lips. "Exactly. Neither of us scares easily, so there's no need for either of us to worry."



"You'd better remember you said that. If things get messy for you, you can't pin it on me," Eliana replied without hesitation.



"I wouldn't blame you-no matter how things turn out,"he said with quiet certainty.



Something in his tone struck her as oddly off.



Looking away, she asked, "You only brought me here as your date to keep Celine at bay, right? Now that you've done that, can I go?"


"Leaving already? I thought you still had another  performance lined up," Tristan replied.


Eliana's brows knit in confusion. "Performance? What are you talking about?"


"On my way here, Rocco told me Carl was spotted at the entrance," Tristan explained. "I assume you're the one who called him over."



That reminder hit her like a jolt-Eliana had almost forgotten her original goal of digging into what Leyla had been doing in Carl's room.


If Tristan hadn't brought it up, she might have forgotten entirely.


"Is Carl still waiting outside?" she asked quickly.


"I had someone take him to the conference area,"Tristan replied.



"Then I'll go see him," Eliana said without hesitation.


"Let me come with you," Tristan suggested immediately.



"You don't have to. You've got your own affairs to handle," Eliana rejected, moving to the door and slipping out.


Just outside, Rocco gave Tristan a questioning glance,silently asking if he should shadow her. A small shake of Tristan's head gave his answer.



If Eliana didn't want him following her, he had no intention of forcing it.



He felt certain that with her about to make her move,the entertainment was only moments away.


Over in the main exhibition hall, Leyla had been lingering expectantly for Hector, though he was nowhere in sight.



Just as she began to suspect he might skip the event entirely, his figure emerged from the direction of the conference area.



Dressed in a pristine white tailcoat, Hector carried himself like a man born to refinement, hispresence drawing more than a few admiring glances from nearby women.



An instinctive unease settled over Leyla.


While he could never rival Tristan in her mind, Hector still far outshone the typical rich young man. A man like him-handsome,well-connected,and wealthy-was a prize few would ignore, and she had no intention of letting another woman get to him first.



With practiced precision, she smoothed her hair,double-checked her makeup, and swept toward him. At that moment, Hector was speaking into his phone,recounting to Jeffry what had taken place in the private room earlier.



Jeffry's tone sharpened with surprise. "Eliana Murray again? And what exactly is she to Tristan?"


"He said she's his fiancée," Hector answered flatly.



"Fiancée?" Jeffry repeated, startled. "It's lucky we made it clear to the Murray family that day-that there's no enmity between us anymore. Otherwise,this would've been a real mess."



Hector kept his response to himself.



His dislike for the Murray family-especially Eliana-ran deep, and it all stemmed from Leyla.



Jeffry continued, "From now on, keep your distance from Leyla. The Murrays aren't exactly fond of her these days."


"I-"Hector began, but his words faltered the instant he spotted Leyla heading his way from across the room.
###Chapter 73 Manipulating Hector

Draped in a soft blend of blue and pink, Leyla moved with the poise of someone who knew eyes would follow her.



The moment Hector laid eyes on it, he knew it was the very dress he'd purchased for her the month before.


Back then, it had only existed in glossy magazine pages,out of stock everywhere, and had arrived while he was away.



Seeing it on her now only confirmed his instincts-his choice had been flawless. The gown framed her figure even better than it had on the professional model.Her makeup, more polished than usual, gave her the delicate allure of a decadent dessert just waiting to be savored.



Leyla's gentle elegance had always been the style Hector admired most.



Even after a short separation, he felt the ache of missing her,though his mind insisted their relationship needed to end.



When she drew nearer, a sudden tightness gripped his throat, making it hard to swallow.



Through the phone pressed to his ear, Jeffry continued, "That Leyla is both foolish and petty-she's not worth your time. A man in your position can have anyone.Cut her loose, and the sooner the better.Understand?"



The sound of his father's words snapped Hector out of the daze Leyla had put him in.



"I know," he muttered vaguely before ending the call with some flimsy excuse.



It never crossed Jeffry's mind that Leyla might be at the charity event-he assumed she had no standing to be there-so he didn't realize Hector had hung up just to give her his attention.



"Hector..." Leyla's voice trembled as she reached him,her eyes glistening before she could say more. "I've missed you so much..."


Her voice softened into silence as a tear slipped down her cheek, catching the light in a way that made it impossible to doubt her yearning.



Growing up among six Murray boys,each with their own personalities, had taught her exactly how to draw a man's heart closer.



For days she had perfected this tearful look in front of her mirror, adjusting every flicker of her gaze until it felt natural. Now was the moment to put it to use.



When Hector's eyes softened with worry and a flicker of regret, she knew her preparation had paid off.



Rather than rush into more words, she let her eyes linger on him, drinking in his presence as though she'd been starved of it.


The sight chipped away at his resolve until it was gone completely.



Closing the distance in a few steady steps,he paused briefly before taking her hand in a firm hold."Leyla,I'm sorry. I've been buried in work these past days and ended up neglecting you."



The warmth of his grip eased something tight in her chest, and she allowed herself an inward sigh of relief.Hector still cared.



With her free hand, she gave her thigh a discreet pinch, just enough to make her eyes sting with fresh tears.



This time, she kept them from spilling,allowing them to glimmer at the edge as if her emotions were barely restrained.



That almost-breaking expression twisted the guilt deeper into his chest. "I'm sorry. I won't make you  wait again. No matter how busy I am, I'll find the time for you."



Through those shimmering eyes, she appeared as though she longed for him but refused to hinder his important work.


She gave a small shake of her head and replied,"Don't worry about it. If you're busy, go ahead. I've been tied up with a few things myself, and I might not make it back for a while."



Those words caught Hector's attention instantly."What's been keeping you so busy? I thought your company went under with the Murray Group."



"Actually, this matter has nothing to do with the company. It's something personal."


"And what personal matter would that be?" Hector asked, unaware she had already taken the lead in steering the conversation.



By now, Leyla had full control of the exchange.In an unhurried tone, she asked, "Have you heard of Davin Gordon?"



"You mean the renowned oil painting master?"Hector's surprise was clear.


"Exactly. That's the one." "My father's art collection includes several of his works."



A grin stretched across Leyla's face. "He decided I would be his last student, and I've been soaking up everything he teaches about painting. He actually suggested I enter the oil painting contest at today's exhibition."



Excitement flickered in Hector's eyes. "Seriously?"



"You think I'd make up something like that? You know I never lie to you."


That was enough for Hector. He trusted her word right away.


Given where Leyla stood now, Davin's support made all the difference. Without him, she wouldn't have made it into the competition at all, much less stood a chance of qualifying. That realization sent a wave of hope through Hector.


His dad had never been fond of Leyla, blaming her for past slip-ups and thinking she'd never amount to much. The moment his dad discovered that Leyla was now under Davin's wing, he'd have to reconsider. The thought sparked Hector's enthusiasm as he leaned forward. "So,what do you think-can you win this thing?" Leyla nodded and replied, "I won't pretend I'm guaranteed first place, but I've got a strong shot. Mr.Gordon told me about the others in the running."



Those competitors had talent, sure. None, however,could match Carl's abilities. And Leyla's knack for imitation was top-notch. If she could capture even eighty percent of what made Carl's piece special, the trophy would likely end up in her hands.


Hector could barely contain himself. "That's perfect.Go get ready. I'm making a call."



"To who?"



"My dad."



Leyla's eyes widened in surprise. "Why are you calling him? Well, he's always warned you not to get too close to me."



"That was another story. Listen, the moment you win today, he's going to change his tune and let you in. I'm certain of it."



Leyla paused for a moment, then straightened her shoulders with a sense of resolve. "If that's how it is,I'll get ready now. Call him once I'm set."



"You've got it." Hoping to give Leyla an edge, Hector spoke to the staff and secured a quiet spot just for  her. Thanks to his efforts, Leyla remained tucked away,unaware when Carl showed up.


With hands in his pockets, Carl lost himself in the details of a painting called Corner of Broken Stones.On a ledge carved from ancient rock,a single bloom clung to life.



Anyone looking could sense the flower's unstoppable energy right away.


"This is brilliant!" Carl blurted out, his eyes drawn to the signature in gold at the bottom right. It was Riley's name.



Recognition dawned on Carl at once. So that explained the power of the piece. Riley's style was plain, but his work always stuck in the mind.



Most oil painting legends, as far as Carl was concerned,cared more about self-praise than true art. In his eyes,even his offhand sketches could rival their best efforts.



But Riley Wade stood apart as the only painter Carl truly respected. He could also make room in his heart for Davin.



Davin's paintings caught Carl's attention because hints of Riley's teaching always showed through.


Finding out later that Davin had trained under Riley made everything fall into place for Carl.


"Carl! Over here!" A cheerful voice echoed from behind,brightening the silence.



Carl spun away from the painting, his face lighting up at the sight of Eliana. "I've been searching for you!Where did you disappear to?"
###Chapter 74 I'll Win It For You
Explaining that she'd only been helping Tristan getting rid of unwanted admirer felt unnecessary, so Eliana put on a mock frown instead. "Were you actually looking for me earlier? Because from where I stood,it looked,like you were far too busy admiring the paintings here."



Carl's trusting nature made him falter immediately under her words.



Rubbing the back of his head, he blurted out, "I swear,I was searching for you the whole time! I just happened to pass by that piece, and it caught my eye.I stopped for a moment-just a few seconds-to appreciate it. Then I was going to keep looking for you."



Noticing the genuine worry in his face, Eliana's lips curved into a reassuring smile. "I'm teasing you. I'm not upset. But now you've got me curious-what sort of painting could hold your attention like that?"



The tension left Carl's shoulders as he explained, "It's the work of an artist I really admire."



Intrigued, Eliana leaned slightly to glance past him. One look was all it took to recognize the piece-her own creation, "Rubble Corner".



She remembered clearly how someone had once reached out to the Onyx Syndicate to commission a painting from Riley.



The price had been too good to ignore, so she had accepted and painted this herself.


Never had she imagined it would end up displayed here.



A thought slipped in uninvited-could Tristan have been the one who placed that order? He had once said he liked her art. Maybe that hadn't been flattery at all.



Realizing she was letting her thoughts drift toward Tristan again,she pulled herself back sharply.


After all, he was already involved with someone, and she had nothing but disdain for that woman.



Becoming part of that equation was something she would never allow.



Shaking off the thought entirely, Eliana turned back to Carl. "If you're that fond of it, I'll give you a Riley painting of your own."  Carl was taken aback. "You own his work? Those are worth a fortune! How in the world did you get one?"



Tricking Carl never required much effort, so Eliana spun a story without hesitation. "Riley once visited my village for inspiration, and I practically begged for a personal piece."



His eyes went wide. "Wait-Riley actually agreed?"


"Of course, she's talented, generous and stunning."Eliana nodded.



"Stunning? And you said 'she'? Hold on, I thought Riley was some old man!" Carl exclaimed.



"Old man? No. She's a gorgeous young woman,"Eliana replied smoothly.



"You're serious? She's a young man?" Carl drew in a sharp breath, then leaned closer. "Does she have a boyfriend? Think I might have a shot?"


The question made Eliana inwardly wince.She should have told him that she was Riley.



She regretted lying to Carl now, as covering it up was just too troublesome.



Eliana could only vaguely reply, "Don't even think about it, Carl. She's already engaged." His face fell for a moment before lighting up again."Well, either way, thanks, Lia. Once you've got that painting,you must give it to me! Or I can buy it-either works."



Eliana waved the offer away. "Forget about paying me.I'm no art collector, so I'll just hand it over."



"Thanks!" Carl's grin spread from ear to ear.


"There's nothing to thank me for. Didn't you give me a whole factory?" Eliana reminded him with a faint smile.



"That's different. Taking care of you is what I should be doing. I am your brother, after all," Carl said with quiet conviction.


Her lips curved further, a quiet warmth blooming in her chest.


Moments like this reminded her exactly how different the Murray family was from Janessa.



In Janessa's eyes, nothing Eliana did-no matter the effort or sacrifice-was ever considered a gift. It was simply what she owed.


If Janessa demanded Eliana's very life, she was expected to hand it over without protest. The Murray family could not have been more different.



If Eliana ever asked for their lves, she knew they would give them freely.


Holding onto that thought, she softened her voice."We're family. There's no need for formal words-that would only make us strangers. But I do have something I need your help with right now."


"What is it? Just tell me, I'll handle it!" Carl replied without missing a beat, his eagerness plain.


She leaned closer, motioning for him to comenearer,and murmured her request in his ear.


Her plan was for him to take part in the day's oil painting competition.



Without the slightest pause, Carl nodded."Consider it done! If you want first place, I'll win it for you!"



He had never once shown his work to the public, but if Eliana asked, there was nothing he wouldn't do-not even step into a competition.



The host's voice rang out across the exhibition hall."The charity auction is about to begin. Guests, please proceed to the conference hall." Eliana shook her head lightly and said, "We're not going there, Carl. I'll take you to meet the curator so you can register for the competition."



"Alright," Carl agreed without hesitation.



HHe would go anywhere she led him.


At that same time, Leyla stepped out from the private room Hector had arranged for her and began making her way toward the conference hall.


Halfway there,she crossed paths with Jeffry,who had come at Hector's request.



Jeffry had been questioning Hector about the urgent matter that required him to rush over.


The moment his eyes landed on Leyla, his face darkened like a storm rolling in.


Hisglare was sharp enough to cut. "Tell me, Hector-did you drag me here just so I could see her? Did you conveniently forget everything I told you over the phone?"



"I wouldn't dare..." Hector replied quickly, trying to keep his tone steady.


"Hmph! Wouldn't dare? Sounds to me like you've grown far too bold!" Jeffry snapped,his temper flaring  as he turned to leave.



Hector stepped forward to block him. "Dad,wait-please don't go. Let me explain what actually happened."



Not wanting to risk being cut off,he launched into a quick recounting of the day's events.


The moment he mentioned Davin taking Leyla on as a student, Jeffry's expression froze for a fraction of a second.


"Mr. Gordon agreed to mentor her? Are you telling the truth, or are you feeding me a lie?" Jeffry demanded.



"For something like this, even if I wanted to lie, it wouldn't hold up for long," Hector said firmly."Besides, he is here today-you can ask him yourself."



Some of the tension drained from Jeffry's face.



Seeing that,Hector continued, "She didn't come with me today. Mr. Gordon brought her himself and recommended her for the oil painting competition."



Jeffry lifted his brows slightly, a silent signal for himn to go on.



"The winner," Hector explained, "won't just get a hefty cash prize. They'll also become the chief designer for the new product logo for the Pearson Group's  Qidence branch. Leyla says she's confident she'll take the top spot."


The scowl melted from Jeffry's face, replaced by something far more neutral.



If this turned out to be true, he figured Leyla might not be as worthless as he'd assumed.



Securing the chief designer position would mean the Clarke family could strengthen its relationship with the Pearsons without much effort.



With that thought in mind, his gaze drifted to Leyla,standing a short distance away. At last, he motioned her forward. "Get over here."



Summoning her composure, Leyla stepped closer and greeted him politely. "Hi, Mr. Clarke..."


Jeffry gave a brief nod before asking, "Hector tells me you're confident you can win the championship.Is that so?"-



"Yes. I'll put everything I have into it," Leyla answered without hesitation.



Jeffry raised an eyebrow. "Then I'll give you the opportunity to prove it."


Leyla's chest tightened with excitement. "I appreciate it! I promise I'll take the championship!" Jeffry remained silent after that.


In his mind, victory would have to be earned-it wasn't something that could be guaranteed with empty promises.


Elsewhere, word reached Tristan that Jeffry had arrived.



He ordered Rocco to escort Jeffry to a front-row seat in the conference hall.


It wasn't a personal greeting, but it was still a gesture of considerable respect.


After all, the only person Tristan had chosen to greet in person that day was Eliana.
###Chapter 75 The Same Painting
In the hall, after the host finished warming up the crowd,it was finally Tristan's turn to take the stage.


Unlike many company heads who loved long speeches, Tristan simply said a few words before announcing the start of the charity/auction.


Jeffry hadn't originally planned to attend, but since he had shown up, he made a token effort by purchasing a few items to show support for Tristan.



The Pearson Group was no longer something Jeffry wanted to oppose.



Instead,they preferred cooperation whenever possible.



Others shared the same attitude-eager to win Tristan's favor and take part in the auction.


The atmosphere in the hall grew increasingly lively,especially when Riley's masterpiece was unveiled.



At that point, it wasn't just about charity or flattery-everyone genuinely wanted to own that painting.



Leyla wasn't particularly interested in art herself, but she  knew who Riley was, and more importantly, Davin was   both fan and disciple of Riley. If she won this work for Davin, he would definitely be tou ched.With that thought in mind, she gently coaxed Hector
Hector had never been stingy with money. If you like it, I'll win it for you," he said, lifting his paddle without hesitation. However,  after several rounds of bidding, a man  stepped  up to whisper something to the auctioneer. The  man was none other than Doran, Tristan's right-hand After hearing Doran's words, the auctioneer nodded and signaled  two assistants. The assistants moved quickly and brought a display d onto the stage. The auctioneer raised his microphone. "Mr. Shaw has it the fuse on this work!" Instantly   the previously enthusiasticcrowd fell silent,even Hector lowered his paddle. Leyla  blinked in confusion and tugged at Hector's e. "Hector,why did you stop bidding? What does light the  fuse＇ mean？  Why is everyone suddenly quiet？
Before Hector could respond, a girl seated nearby scoffed. "Mr. Clarke, your date doesn't even know what 'lighting the fuse' means? That's funny.What is she-straight off some farm?"



Leyla's cheeks flushed pink, embarrassment flooding her. She worried Hector might be irritated by her ignorance.



Fortunately, Hector didn't waver. "Leyla isn't some country girl. It's just that if she wants something,I usually buy it outright-she's never needed to attend auctions."



The girl, silenced, stood up and left.


Leyla's unease only deepened. She glanced at Hector."Do you know her?"


"She's not a local, now working on a project with our family. My dad asked me to always look out for her,which apparently caused a misunderstanding. But 1cleared it up with her yesterday."



Leyla nodded,though a sliver of anxiety twisted in her chest. No wonder the girl had spoken so rudely-she obviously lied Hector. Thank goodness his heart was still with herself. Otherwise, another woman could easily have snatched him away. She clenched her fists,more determined than ever to win the competition today. When no further bids were made, the assistants confirmed the status and carried the artwork backstage.



Soon after, the next auction item was brought out-a painting by a foreign artist.


Hector explained, "In auctions, lighting the fuse means that no matter how high others bid, that personwill top it-without limit-until everyone elsegives up."



Leyla's eyes widened. "So even if we went up to a hundred million, he'd still bid more?"



Hector nodded.



She stared, stunned by such boldness and wealth."Aren't they afraid someone might drive the price up on purpose?"



Hector chuckled. "Anyone who dares to do that doesn't fear a bidding war. If you don't have serious firepower, you don't even think about it."


Leyla lowered her gaze. "I didn't even know any of this. Did I embarrass you?"


Hector shook his head. "I've been to countless auctions over the years, and this is only the second time I've ever seen it happen. It's not your fault." "You've seen it before? Who did it?"



”Tristan."



Leyla instinctively looked toward the front row and saw Doran leaning in to whisper to Tristan. "Is that man Tristan's assistant?"



"Yes," Hector confirmed, then added thoughtfully,"That's strange."



"Strange? Didn't you just say Tristan did it before?Why would that be odd?"


Hector explained, "Because the last time he did it-was also for this work of Riley."



Leyla froze. The same painting? That was odd,really.



And this piece had originally come from Tristan's own collection.


If he'd wanted to keep it, he could have simply left it out of the auction.



Instead, he put it up for charity... only to buy it back at an astronomical price.



Clearly, Tristan had his own unique way of thinking Otherwise, he wouldn't have spoken up at the Murray family banquet on Eliana's behalf. It was a shame Leyla couldn't buy the painting for Davin. What she didn't realize was that Tristan's logic made perfect sense-to him.



He had only discovered today that Eliana was actually Riley.



Tristan had always admired Riley's work and collected many of her pieces.



That was exactly why Corner of Broken Stones ended up in the auction-he'd acquired several.


But the moment he found out Eliana was Riley,everything changed.



He would never allow someone else to own her artwork, no matter how many he already possessed.


If he had known sooner, he never would have donated the painting.


With Tristan lighting the fuse, no one dared bid again.


An hour later, the auction wrapped up quietly, with all proceeds going towards building a school for disadvantaged children.


Once the gavel came down, the host stepped forward with the microphone. "The auction has concluded.Now we move on to the second part of today's program1..." The host introduced the oil-painting competition.



When he announced that the champion would be responsible for the exterior and logo design of the Pearson Group's new product line, the room stirred.



"I thought the top prize was just a million in cash-now the winner gets to design for Pearson Group?"



"That new product's an electric car, right? So the winner designs the emblem!"


"Whoever snags that deal is incredibly lucky."



"Shame I can't paint-I'd sign up on the spot."


Leyla listened to the excited chatter around her,heart bubbling with anticipation.


So the new product was an electric car.If she won the competition, she'd make a name for herself in the country.
###Chapter 76 The Judges 'Panel
As Leyla rode her wave of excitement, she suddenly noticed Jeffry glancing back at her.


She straightened in her seat, recognizing that look-his nod of approval, granting her the opportunity she'd been hoping for.


A flutter of nerves stirred in her chest, even as her pulse raced with anticipation. But reminding herself that today's contestants weren't on her level, she quickly calmed her racing heart.


Soon, the hall was cleared, and contestants filed in one after another based on their registration numbers.



In search of fresh talent, Pearson Group had placed an age cap on entries.


As a result, none of the veteran artists were eligible -only fresh-faced newcomers like Leyla.



Before she walked in, Hector had fussed over her,reminding, "My dad's staying till the results are announced. Don't let him down, okay?"



Leyla said confidently, "Relax, I've got this." Hector nodded, pressed a kiss to her forehead, and watched her disappear inside.


Because Davin himself had recommended Leyla, and she'd completed her registration early,she was given a seat near the front.



The moment she sat down, she closed her eyes and replayed in her mind one of Carl's paintings-the one she had hopes of mimicking.



Her recall was impressive; with her eyes shut, it was as though the painting itself hung right in front of her.


A satisfied little smile appeared on her lips.


But when she opened her eyes again... she froze.There, seated at the very center of the judges' panel,were Tristan-and Eliana.



Leyla's eyes widened. Eliana... was on the judges 'panel? WWould this affect her chances of winning?


After a beat, she squared her shoulders and abruptly rose to her feet.



Larry, one of the judges, noticed her standing and frowned. "Young lady, the competition is about to start. Please take your seat."


Eliana instinctively followed his line of sight. That was  when she met Leyla's glare-sharp, openly dissatisfied.


She lifted a brow, immediately sensing that Leyla's issue was directed at her.



Sure enough, Leyla spoke up the next moment,her voice loud and carrying, "Mr. Craig, I'm sorry, but I'd like to say something."



Knowing she was Davin's newly accepted student,Larry indulged her, "Very well-please speak."


Leyla didn't hesitate. "Before I came in, I was told outsiders weren't allowed entry. So why is she here?And why is she sitting on the judges' panel?"



As she spoke, she pointed boldly at Eliana.



Eliana's expression didn't waver. She had already guessed Leyla's irritation was aimed her way.


Tristan, however, immediately frowned beside her, his face turning cold. "Who said she's unrelated to the competition?" His voice was firm and icy. "I invited her to be a judge."



Leyla subconsciously shrank from his intense stare-but thinking of her ambition, she forced herself to stand tall.


"Mr.Pearson, I know you're close to her, but this is a serious competition. How can you let someone who  knows nothing about oil-painting sit as a judge?”



Gasps rippled through the room. They didn't expect Leyla not to know that the internationally famed Riley was Eliana's pseudonym.



Feeling countless eyes fixed on her, Leyla's confidence began to crack.


At the very back, Carl almost shot to his feet when he heard Leyla challenging Eliana. But before he could speak, Eliana gave him the smallest shake of her head.With effort,he swallowed his temper and relaxed back in his seat.



Eliana finally looked at Leyla again-not angry,simply cool-and gave a light laugh. "If someone finds my presence inappropriate, I'll step down."


Truthfully,she hadn't wanted to be judge in the first place.



She had only agreed after Tristan, Larry, and Davin had pleaded with her, over and over, to join the judges ' panel. Not having to sit there wasting her day was,frankly, preferable in her opinion.



Eliana rose to her feet, ready to leave.


Davin quickly reached out and gently stopped her,leaning in to whisper, "Please don't mind her. She's my newest student and doesn't know who you are my  mentor. I'll talk to her afterward!"


"She's your student?" Eliana lifted her brows.genuinely surprised.



"Yes... why?" Davin looked confused.



Eliana shook her head, her tone carrying a quiet,layered meaning. "You really are getting old-your judgment is slipping."



Davin looked even more lost. "What? I seriously don't understand."



"You don't need to," Eliana replied lightly. "You'll figure it out soon enough."


She then turned towards Tristan and said, "I'll wait outside until the competition's over."



Tristan gave a single nod.


A moment later, he stood up as well. "This young lady just made me realize I know nothing about oil-painting either-which makes me unqualified to sit on this panel. Mr. Craig, Mr. Gordon, I'll leave this to you."


With that, he moved to Eliana's side, the steel in his expression shifting into something warm. "Come on.We'll leave together."



Eliana frowned slightly. "You really don't have to..." Tristan lowered his voice. "You're not the only one who doesn't feel like wasting time in there."



Eliana pressed her lips together, choosing not to argue.



The two walked out in tow, leaving the remaining judges exchanging baffled glances.


Larry and Davin's expressions darkened-Davin's most of all.



Though he didn't fully understand Eliana's earlier comment,Leyla's attitude toward her had clearly crossed a line.



Leyla was only his newly taken-in student.Eliana,on the other hand, was someone he had respected and admired for years. His teacher.


Still, knowing Leyla had spoken out of ignorance,he swallowed his anger-for now-intending to reprimand her properly once the competition ended.


Even so, the displeasure in his gaze was hard to miss.



Leyla could feel it-the displeasure in Davin's gaze-and a wave of indignation rose in her chest. Why was he siding with Eliana, an outsider?



Almost immediately,she found a reason to console herself. Davin must simply be upset that Tristan had  walked out as well.



So she wasn't worried. Once the competition was over, she would tell Davin the truth-that Eliana was Louis's daughter who had been bullying her.



And at that time, a principled and righteous man like Davin, no matter how close Eliana was to Tristan,would surely not stand on her side.


Unfortunately, it wasn't only the judges' panel that was upset with Leyla. The contestants were equally displeased.



Riley leaving was one thing-but Tristan also walking out was another matter entirely. Most of them didn't fancy their chances at winning, but they all knew that if Tristan could remember them even a little, it mnight give them an edge when applying for a designer position at Pearson Group later



Now, thanks to Leyla, even that slim opportunity had vanished. Unable to hold it in, several contestants began venting in low voices



"She's such a busybody!"



"Why stick her nose into everything? What does any of that have to do with her?"



"I really can't tell if she came here to compete-or just to stir up trouble!"
###Chapter 77 Be Drawn To Eliana
"Calling her a busybody is too lenient."


"I agree! She's just downright spiteful!"


The muttering around the room quickly swelled,voices rising with irritation.



A good number in the crowd were loyal supporters of Riley, eager for the rare chance to have their work critiqued by her. They'd come with high hopes, only to watch them crumble to dust







The disappointment curdled into anger, and the harsh remarks carried easily to Leyla's ears. Her lips pressed into a thin line. In her mind, those who lacked artistic understanding had no business being here. Their departure should have been a blessing to anyone with real talent. Yet instead of gratitude, she was met with petty insults.Were these people completely unhinged?



Still,she brushed their words aside with cool disdain. In her eyes, the outcome was already decided-victors were the ones who wrote history, and soon enough,she would be the one holding the pen. Settle down, all of you!" Larry's voice cut through the noise as he rose from his seat. "Check your painting supplies. If you're missing anything, speak up now. If everything's in order, we'll start the competition immediately."



"No tools missing over here."



"All set on my side, too."



Larry gave a short nod. "Alright then, the competition begins now! You've got two hours to finish your work.There's no set theme, but it must be in oil. Let your creativity lead the way."



The moment his words landed, brushes began to move and pencils scratched across canvases.



Since the rules didn't dictate a subject, most had already envisioned their final piece before the clock even started.



Leyla, in particular, skipped any preliminary sketching altogether, diving straight into her painting with swift,assured strokes.



The decisiveness caught Davin's attention. Though her earlier clash with Riley still left a bitter taste, he couldn't deny the precision and natural skill in her technique. 
In the farthest corner, Carl was the last to pick up his brush.



Roped into the contest at the last minute,he had only just learned the details. He spent a good while mapping out his composition before finally applying the first stroke of color.



Meanwhile, the auction had wound down, and those not competing were escorted into a lavish lounge.



There, crystal glasses gleamed with fine liquor, and trays of delicate, artful pastries awaited them.



Hector set a plate with a delicate slice of dessert in front of Jeffry. "Dad, you came straight here without dinner. You should eat something to tide you over."



For weeks, Jeffry had been distant toward his son.yet tonight he didn't push the offering away.



A father could be disappointed, even angry, but the bond of blood made it hard to close his heart entirely.


On top of that, his opinion of Leyla had improved somewhat,and Hector's small act of goodwill gave him an easy chance to soften his stance.



Relief flickered across Hector's face, though before he could speak further, a murmur rose from the lounge entrance. Both men turned to see the cause.



Eliana stepped inside, her arrival pulling every eye toward her as if she carried her own spotlight.


Hector realized this was the first time he had truly taken in her appearance.


Leyla's beauty was undeniable, but Eliana... she possessed a glow that edged beyond it.


While Leyla's elegance came wrapped in a luxurious gown, Eliana's magnetism was sharpened by a chic,perfectly tailored suit that spoke of sophistication.


The memory of their first meeting flashed in his mind -her clothes then had been worn and plain, more fitting for a beggar than a guest in high society.



Now,dressed in refined attire, she radiated a poised,noble grace that made every other socialite in the room fade into the scenery.


Jeffry's gaze lingered on Eliana, taking in every detail of her refined poise. Admiration stirred in his eyes,though it was tinged with something almost wistful. "If she hadn't been separated from the Murrays, maybe the one by your side wouldn't be Leyla at all, but her.A girl like that would be a credit to you-and to me.And when it comes to health, she's the sort who could outlast any ailment. After all, she could even heal  even what others can't."



The remark made Hector's brow crease instinctively."Dad, Leyla is my girlfriend. I truly care for her..."


Even as he defended her, the suggestion his father had planted worked its way into his thoughts like a seed taking root, subtle and unnoticed.


Jeffry's eyes cut to his son with quiet certainty."I know you better than you think. This talk of 'genuine feelings'-it's just the thrill of wanting what your mother and I disapprove of. If there were no opposition, and you married Leyla without any hindrance,I doubt it would last."



Hector found himself unable to respond.


Jeffry let out a quiet sigh and gave his head a small shake. "Alright, enough of this topic. If you claim your feelings are real, I'll take your word for it. Since you're so determined, I'll give Leyla a fair shot. But she'll need to prove herself by winning today's competition -show me she's worth something."


"She'll win," Hector answered without hesitation, his tone brimming with certainty.


Before he could say more, movement at the doorway drew every eye.


Tristan had arrived. Without hesitation, his steps  carried him straight to Eliana's side, as though that was where he belonged.



Catching sight of the two together, the Clarke men exchanged a brief, unreadable glance before making their way over.



Jeffry greeted them first.


Both acknowledged him with slight nods, their cool,self-possessed air almost identical- so much so it set Hector oddly on edge.


The feeling was unfamiliar, and for reasons Hector couldn't pinpoint, it left him unsettled.


Jeffry began cautiously. "Dr. Murray, I wanted to ask you a few things concerning my father's health..."


Because Eliana had already committed to Miguel's treatment, walking away halfway was never an option in her mind.



She gave a simple nod. "Go ahead."



For a moment, Jeffry's lips parted, but no words followed. Something in his expression suggested hesitation.



Sensing it, Tristan interjected smoothly, "I've got something personal to handle. You two carry on." 
He stepped away without looking back.


"Now that we're alone, you can speak freely." Eliana shifted her focus back to Jeffry.


At last, Jeffry got to the point. "It's not actually about my father-it's about a friend of his. The man's illness mirrors my father's, and after hearing of his recovery,he came to me seeking help..."



Eliana lifted a hand, cutting him off. "There's no need to go further. I treated your father because I gave my word. That doesn't mean I'm obliged to help someone else."



Jeffry leaned forward, almost urgent. "If it's a matter of payment,I can meet whatever price you set."


"Then have him submit a request through the Onyx Syndicate," Eliana replied evenly. "But whether I agree will depend entirely on my mood-and on whether l see any reason to deal with him at all."



Even hearing that limited assurance was enough to make Jeffry's expression warm. "I appreciate it.I'll pass along what you've said."


While the two spoke, Hector's gaze never left Eliana.It struck him that this was the first time he'd truly studied her up close. With every passing second, her beauty seemed more striking, almost disarming.


Leyla shared a hint of her features, and Leyla's looks were already celebrated. Yet, side by side in his mind,the difference was undeniable.



Somewhere deep inside, a small, unacknowledged doubt began to take root-and without him realizing,it quietly pushed deeper.
###Chapter 78 Did Leyla Honestly Think She Was In...



Eliana tilted her head slightly, her tone calm but firm."By the way, just call me Eliana from now on. I'd rather people didn't know too much about who I am."



She wasn't living off her medical skills anymore, and the thought of strangers constantly showing up at her door was more nuisance than honor.



Jeffry's lips curved in an easy smile. "Alright. Eliana it is."



He reached back and gave Hector a light tug forward."Hector's been feeling bad ever since that day. Says he shouldn't have doubted you-let alone threatened you to treat his grandpa. He asked to come along today so he could apologize in person."



Jeffry's eyes held a quiet intent. He wanted these two to at least be on civil terms.


Sure,Hector had mentioned on the phone that Tristan had gone public, calling Eliana his fiancée. But Jeffry knew Elbert too well-profits first, always.



The Murray family was no longer what it had been now.No matter how gifted Eliana was as a healer, Elbert  would never welcome a daughter-in-law from such a fallen background.



Jeffery was certain Tristan and Eliana would eventually split. But he didn't mind Eliana's background.


He hoped Hector and Eliana could work out beautifully.


Hector swallowed, his voice low but earnest. "Ms.Murray... I'm really sorry. That day, I let my panic for my grandpa's health cloud my judgment. I spoke out of line and acted even worse."



Eliana's brows lifted, a faint, unreadable smile touching her lips. "Quite a thoughtful grandson,huh?"



Her tone made Hector feel it wasn't entirely a compliment.


Still, he forced a polite smile. "Can you forgive me?Let's forget it ever happened. If you or your family ever need help, you can come to me anytime."


Eliana couldn't care less about his offer. She barely resisted the urge toroll her eyes.



She wasn't the type to hold grudges over every little thing-some people, she could forgive easily.


But there were others she knew from the first meeting she'd never trust, let alone befriend. Hector fell squarely in that second category.



If the Murray and Clarke families weren't in the middle of smoothing things over, she wouldn't even be standing here entertaining his empty words.



She fixed Hector a stare, her expression unreadable."I've got one principle-if people don't bother me,l don't bother them. But if someone crosses me,I don't let it slide. So, as long as you stay out of mmy way,I'll pretend nothing ever happened."


The words hit Hector like a sudden drop in temperature. Why was she so warm with his dad but cold towards him?



His dad had doubted her too, hadn't he?



He opened his mouth to reply, but a sharp, cutting voice sliced through the air. "Hector, what are you doing here?"



They turned towards the voice. Leyla stood at the entrance, cheeks still flushed from her competition.



She'd been buzzing with confidence, eager to find Hector and brag about her sure-win performance.


But then she'd spotted him-shoulders hunched,speaking low to Eliana, eyes carrying a strange mix of flattery and... something else. Something like  admiration he didn't want to admit.



Leyla couldn't understand why he would start having a good impression about Eliana. Was he merely feeding her ego? The Clarke family was gullible enough to still believe Miguel's recovery was Eliana's doing.



Playing nice to her for the sake of the family made sense. But why that flicker of reluctance? It was almost.as if Hector wanted Eliana, knew he couldn't have her,yet couldn't bring himself to let go.



The thought clawed at Leyla's composure, making her chest tighten and her pulse spike. Before she could stop herself, she stomped toward them.



When Hector looked up and saw her, his gaze slipped away,avoiding hers without even knowing why.



He cleared his throat, masking the sudden awkwardness. "What are you doing here?"


"I finished my painting," Leyla said, her tone light,her expression carefully smoothed over. She gave Jeffry a polite nod, pretending the storm in her chest didn't exist.



But once they weren't looking, she shot Eliana a glare -sharp and cutting-loaded with unspoken warning.



Eliana blinked at her, puzzled. What was that about?  Did Leyla honestly think she was into Hector? The idea almost made her laugh.



Hector wasn't her type-not even close. His presence alone irritated her, and the last thing she'd ever do was play the "other woman", especially for a man already tied to someone like Leyla.


Disgust tightened in her chest. She turned to Jeffry."I've got things to handle.I'll head out now."


Before anyone could say a word, she turned on her heel and walked away, not looking back.



Jeffry's jaw ticked, his displeasure simnmering-not at Eliana, but at Leyla.



He'd planned to smooth things over and maybe talk Eliana into reconsidering helping Miguel's friend, but Leyla's sudden entrance had chased her off.


His voice was cool when he turned to her. "Why'd you come out so quickly? I saw the others were still at it.Did you walk out of the competition?"


Leyla straightened. "No... I didn't." She softened her tone, trying to explain. "An hour's plenty for me.I already finished."



Copying an image lodged in her mind was second nature to her-it didn't require much thinking. That was why she was always the first to wrap up.


Jeffry's expression eased a fraction. "Alright then.We'll just wait for the results."



The results would be posted within an hour after the competition ended. There was nothing to do now but wait.



Leyla's confidence returned in full force. "Don't worry.This one's mine-no contest." Her certainty was enough to push Jeffry's irritation to the side.



Hector,too, momentarily forgot his complex feelings for Eliana.



Jeffry drifted off to greet a few of the big shots present,leaving Hector and Leyla alone.



"Hungry?" Hector asked. "Want me to grab you something sweet?"



But Leyla wasn't thinking about food. She was thinking about the look she'd caught in his eyes earlier. That flicker of reluctance.



The question burned in her throat until she couldn't hold it back. "What exactly were you talking about with that bumpkin?"



Hector's brows knit. His voice was quiet but firm. "Don't call her that. She's talented."



Leyla's face went pale, eyes wide with disbelief."Hector... are you scolding me for her?"



The question seemed to snap him back. He shook his head quickly. "No. I'm saying, if my dad hears you talk like that, he's going to be mad at you again."


Her lips pressed into a thin line. "Okay," she murmured.But she wasn't letting it go. "You still haven't answered me. What were you talking about?"


Hector kept his tone even. "Nothing much. My grandpa's friend needs her help with a health problem.My dad and I were trying to get her to assist him."


Leyla's brows pulled together. "Weren't you skeptical about her being the miracle healer? Why the sudden   "



"She's proved it," Hector cut in. "My grandpa's health has gotten much better."



The words hit her likea slap. Heat flared under her skin, and her hands curled into fists so tight her nails bit into her palms.



The sharp sting was the only thing keeping her anger in check.



Not here. Not now.She would wait Once the results were announced and she claimed her victory, no one-not Jeffry, not Hector, or anyone else-would have any reason to look down on her again.
###Chapter 79 Undeserving Of Even A Moment's...
"Leyla, are you annoyed?" Hector's voice cut through the tension as he finally registered the storm brewing in Leyla's eyes.



Leyla had barely managed to rein in her emotions,but his delayed concern struck like a match to dry kindling,igniting her fury once more.



Once upon a time, Hector could read the slightest shift in her emotions like pages in an open book. Now,he remained oblivious to her distress until it practically screamed at him.



The bitter realization twisted her features into a mask of cold resolve. "If you saw me flirting with another man,wouldn't you be mad?"



Hector's brow furrowed into deep lines of confusion."When was I ever flirting with Eliana? You're spinning fantasies out of thin air. Didn't I just walk you through everything? I was simply seeking her assistance with my grandpa's friend's medical condition."



"So you're painting me as the unreasonable one?"Leyla's words dripped with ice,each syllable carefully measured.  Hector's expression darkened further, irritation beginning to simmer beneath his controlled facade.



"Regardless, you've completely misread the situation.If you have nothing productive to occupy your time,perhaps you should grab some food. A clea head might serve you better than wild accusations,"he declared with dismissive authority.



Leyla's eyes flew wide open, disbelief crashing over her like a cold wave as she realized he wasn't even attempting to comfort her wounded heart. The sensation of their connection dissolving like sand through her fingers filled her with a panic so profound it defied words.



"L.." The words caught in her throat, desperate to escape but trapped by her overwhelming emotions.


However, Hector severed her attempt at communication with ruthless efficiency. "Enough of this drama.- My dad is making his rounds with the guests, and I need to join him. Stay here and get some food into your system."


With those cutting words, he strode away toward Jeffry, abandoning Leyla to stand alone, her heart drowning in a sea of bitter resentment.


Yet she remained rooted to the spot, too afraid that pursuing him would only stoke the flames of his  growing irritation.



Frustration consumed her as she bit down hard on her lower lip, her rage and bitterness demanding an outlet.Her eyes began scanning the crowd for Eliana.



Meanwhile,Eliana had retreated to a quiet corner of the main exhibition hall when Seth's call buzzed through her phone.



"We've hit a roadblock and desperately need your expertise," Seth's voice carried urgent concern.



"What's the situation?" Eliana's response came swift and focused.



"We've been commissioned to penetrate a firewall,but it's proving to be a fortress that our current team can't crack," Seth explained, frustration bleeding through his professional tone.



Eliana swept her gaze across the elegant venue,quickly realizing that no suitable workstation existed for her to unleash her digital prowess.



"How time-sensitive is this operation?" she inquired,already calculating alternatives.



"Extremely urgent. We need to penetrate that firewall within the hour," Seth confirmed,his voice tight with pressure. "I'm currently tied up at this event and can't slip away...However, I know someone whose skills rival my own.Let me connect you with him-I'll forward his details shortly," Eliana offered, her mind already working through the solution.



"Perfect!" Seth's relief was audible through the phone.



The moment she disconnected from Seth, Eliana's fingers moved across her phone screen, calling Damon. He was exactly the ally this situation demanded.



When Damon had demonstrated his digital mastery by tracking down Sean, Eliana recognized a talent that matched her own formidable abilities.



With her current obligations keeping her anchored to the venue, recruiting Damon seemed like the ideal solution.



The phone barely completed its first ring before Damon's warm voice flowed through the speaker. "Hi,Lia,what's happening?"



His voice carried the same tender quality that defined his entire being-soft, caring, and infinitely patient.


Eliana wasted no time on pleasantries. "Damon,I need your particular expertise for something urgent.Would you be able to-" "Yes." His answer came before she could complete her request,swift and unwavering."What do you need?Whatever lies within my power, I'll make it happen."



Warmth bloomed in Eliana's chest at his immediate trust and support. "I have a friend who needs a skilled hacker to break through a particularly stubborn firewall. Could you lend him your talents?"


At her words, Damon's hands tightened involuntarily where they rested upon his motionless legs, a subtle betrayal of his inner turmoil.


Every encounter with a computer awakened the demons of his past, flooding him with agonizing memories.



Yet his recent experience using his digital skills to locate Sean had taught him a crucial lesson-running from pain only gave it more power, while facing it directly offered the path to healing.


Drawing strength from that hard-won wisdom, he inhaled deeply and steadied his resolve. "Absolutely.Have your friend reach out to me."



"Thank you so much!" Joy colored Eliana's voice as relief washed over her.



"Helping you brings me purpose. I only fear that l might disappoint you and prove inadequate..." His  voice trailed off with a weary sigh.


Eliana's expression grew fierce with protective determination. "Damon, you are anything but inadequate. Trust in my judgment if you can't trust your. own worth yet, but know that your value is immeasurable."



The White family had poisoned Damon's mind with their toxic manipulation, but Eliana had sworn to herself that she would shatter those mental chains and help him reclaim his sense of self-worth.



"Thank you, Lia." The words emerged as barely more than a whisper, heavy with emotion.



"I'll have my friend reach out to you immediately."Eliana assured him, already moving to make the connection.



"Understood," Damon confirmed with quiet resolve.



The call disconnected with a soft click, and Eliana immediately forwarded Damon's information to Seth.



Once the message was sent, she lifted her gaze toward the expansive sky beyond the windows.



The sunset painted the horizon in brilliant strokes of gold and crimson, creating a masterpiece that rivaled any artist's greatest work. Eliana's heart ached with the knowledge that without Brenda's toxic influence, Damon's life could have blazed with the same magnificent brilliance as the sunset before her.



Sadly, the universe didn't deal in hypothetical scenarios or second chances.



The memory of Damon's haunted expressions-those moments when his pain broke through his gentle facade-drew a heavy sigh from her lips.



At least time remained on their side, offering hope for healing and redemption.



Her hands formed determined fists as she renewed her vow to help Damon reclaim the radiant future that should have always been his.



As Eliana pivoted to check whether Carl had emerged,she caught sight of Leyla charging toward her like a woman possessed.



Eliana's features hardened into an mask of ice-cold disdain. "I strongly recommend you save yourself from further humiliation."



"Further humiliation?" Leyla's laughter rang hollow and bitter with rage. "Who exactly is the embarrassment here? You've already stolen my family away, and now you're setting your sights on my boyfriend as well?" The accusation struck Eliana as so absurd that she almost laughed.Leyla clearly inhabited a fantasy realm where logic and conscience held no meaning.


A cruel smile twisted Eliana's lips as she delivered her cutting response. "Have you lost your mind, or simply your memory? Allow me to refresh your selective recollection. You were the one who demanded the Murray family sever all ties. You forced them to sign that agreement, cutting yourself off completely.Meanwhile, I was born with Murray blood flowing through my veins. So tell me, who exactly is stealing from whom? And here's a final reality check-while you worship Hector like some precious treasure,I see him as nothing more than worthless garbage,undeserving of even a moment's consideration."



With every syllable, Leyla's expression grew darker,as if storm clouds were gathering across her features.


The Murray family accusations left her speechless-she had indeed committed those very acts. However,when it came to Hector, she refused to back down without a fight.


Rage propelled her words forward like bullets. "If Hector means nothing to you, why waste time conversing with him? Don't you fear Tristan discovering your double-dealing? Or perhaps you recognize that you're just a backwoods nobody who'll  never gain acceptance from the Pearson family, so you're keeping Hector as your backup plan?"


"A backup plan?" Eliana's laughter dripped with contempt. "Hector lacks the basic qualifications to serve as anyone's second choice, let alone mine."



Leyla's composure shattered completely. "How dare you speak about him with such disrespect!"



"And what if I continue? What action will you take to stop me? If you're so enamored with that particular piece of trash, then maintain better control over him and prevent him from polluting my presence ever again." Eliana's voice carried the chill of arctic wind.



Hector's shifting behavior toward her hadn't escaped her notice, and his obvious interest only deepened her revulsion.



The fact that he maintained his relationship with Leyla while simultaneously pursuing her marked him as the lowest form of scum in her estimation.



Irritation flared within Eliana as she delivered her final warning. "Before my remaining patience evaporates entirely, I suggest you remove yourself from my field of vision."



Having delivered her ultimatum, she spun on her heel and prepared to walk away. But Leyla's arm shot out like a barrier, blocking her escape route. "Promise me you won't steal Hector away before you leav/e!"



Eliana swatted Leyla's arm aside with sharp, impatient force.



A twisted inspiration struck Leyla, and she raised her own hand high before delivering a vicious slap across her own cheek.
###Chapter 80 I'm So Proud Of You



Leyla had pampered her skin for years with religious devotion, cultivating a delicate, rose-tinted complexion that caught the light like polished porcelain.



The violent crack of her palm against her own flesh left an immediate crimson handprint blazing across her pale cheek.



Eliana's eyebrows drew together in disgust at the pathetic display. "What kind of sick performance is this? Do you enjoy hurting yourself? If so, take your twisted theatrics home where they belong. This is revolting."



A triumphant laugh bubbled from Leyla's throat."What are you even talking about? You're obviously the one who struck me! Soon everyone will discover your true nature-a violent, unstable woman with a vicious temper!"



She couldn't fathom how Tristan and Hector could possibly like someone so dangerously unpredictable over her.



The moment Leyla opened her mouth to scream,  Eliana's hand moved like lightning, producing a gleaming silver needle that she drove into a precise pressure point on Leyla's neck with surgical precision.


The needle disappeared as swiftly as it had appeared,leaving barely a trace of its presence.


A sharp pinch flared across Leyla's neck, and when she attempted to voice her outrage, only silence emerged from her throat. Her eyes flew wide with terror and confusion as she stared at Eliana, her expression screaming desperate questions about what dark magic had rendered her mute.



The connection between that tiny prick on her neck and her sudden inability to speak defied all logic and reason.



A cold smile spread across Eliana's lips as she delivered her explanation with clinical detachment."Don't panic. I simply found your screeching unbearable and employed a basic acupuncture technique to grant us all some peace. Your voice will return in under ten minutes. However, before you attempt your little victim charade, I suggest you examine the ceiling and count exactly how many surveillance cameras are recording your pathetic performance."



Having delivered her cutting remarks, Eliana dismissed Leyla with a contemptuous push and strode away with regal composure.



She could have easily remnained to watch Leyla summon witnesses, then wielded the surveillance footage like a weapon to destroy this stupid woman's reputation publicly.



However, Leyla simply wasn't significant enough to warrant such elaborate revenge.



She had never viewed Leyla as anything more than a minor irritation undeserving of serious attention.



These childish manipulations were old tricks that Eliana had encountered countless times before.



Wasting energy on such a trivial adversary held no appeal for someone of Eliana's caliber.



As Eliana's figure receded, Leyla's first instinct screamed at her to give chase. But Eliana's warning echoed in her mind, forcing her head to snap upward toward the ceiling.



The expansive exhibition space bristled with surveillance cameras like electronic sentinels watching every corner.


Leyla's face transformed in an instant, color draining away as her thoughts spun wildly through the implications. Of course-with priceless masterpieces adorning these walls, comprehensive surveillance  would be absolutely essential.


The devastating realization crashed over her like a cold wave-Eliana had penetrated her scheme from the very beginning but hadn't considered it worth acknowledging.



Leyla's fingers found the tiny puncture wound on her neck, and a cocktail of rage and bone-deep fear coursed through her veins like ice water. For the first time,the terrifying possibility that she was completely outmatched by Eliana settled into her consciousness like a lead weight.



The acknowledgment of her own inadequacy filled her with such profound dread that her hands began to shake with barely contained terror.



Strategic thinking gradually replaced her panic as she recognized the brutal truth-facing Eliana alone would be suicide. She desperately needed powerful allies.


Before seeking reinforcements, however, she had to secure the foundation she already possessed.



Hector remained her sole remaining asset, and she had to bind his devotion to her with unbreakable chains.Losing him would leave her with absolutely nothing-no power, no protection, no future.


This sobering reality redirected her priorities completely, sending her away from any thoughts of  pursuing Eliana and toward the resting area where Hector waited.



Victory in the competition would surely transform Jeffry's perception of her worth, and marriage to Hector would provide the wealth and influence necessary to wage war against Eliana on equal terms







Meanwhile, Eliana had positioned herself at the conference area's exit, patiently awaiting Carl's emergence.



A steady stream of contestants had completed their work and was flowing out through the doors.



Word had spread among them like wildfire-Eliana was the legendary painter Riley.



The moment they spotted her, their faces transformed with star-struck excitement.



"Riley, would you honor me with your autograph?"



"We witnessed that earlier incident. Please don't lower yourself to engage with such a pathetic creature."


"Absolutely right. Someone of your extraordinary caliber could preside as head judge over international art competitions-this local event is beneath your talents." The admiring contestants unleashed a torrent of praise that Eliana couldn't stem quickly enough-Carl had already absorbed every word.



He stared at Eliana with complete bewilderment written across his features. "Lia, what's happening here?Why are they addressing you as Riley?"



Discomfort settled over Eliana like an ill-fitting cloak.Her multiple personas had remained carefully hidden from the Murray family through deliberate deception.



Janessa's brutal betrayals had forged her heart into steel, making her incapable of extending trust easily -even to those who shared her blood.



The prospect of enduring another devastating betrayal was simply too dangerous to risk.



Consequently, she had buried her impressive accomplishments beneath the humble facade of a simple country girl surviving on agricultural labor.



Yet as genuine affection blossomed between her and the Murray family, she began to understand that certain secrets had outlived their protective purpose.



Every Murray except Sean had proven themselves deserving of her confidence, particularly Carl, whose unwavering loyalty had earned him a special place in her guarded heart. "Carl, take a deep breath. I'll walk you through everything," Eliana promised with gentle firmness


Once she had graciously acknowledged her admirers,she guided Carl away to a secluded corner where they could speak privately.


"Lia, are you truly the famous painter Riley?" Carl's question burst forth with barely contained excitement.



Eliana's head moved in confirmation. "Yes,I am Riley.I owe you a sincere apology. Carl. I've been concealing this truth from you and weaving lies to protect it..."



Shame colored her cheeks as her words faded into uncomfortable silence.



What happened next caught her completely off guard -Carl swept her into an enthusiastic embrace."You've made me so incredibly proud! I'm one of your devoted admirers too! Your paintings speak to my soul! Lia, my respect for you has reached new heights.You can repair vehicles, heal the sick, and create masterpieces! You're absolutely phenomenal! From this moment forward, you're my ultimate inspiration and idol!"



Carl's explosive joy took Eliana completely by surprise.She had braced herself for his hurt and anger over her prolonged deception. Even without outright fury, she had anticipated seeing pain in his eyes, considering how he had always offered her nothing but genuine honesty.



Instead, Carl appeared to harbor absolutely no resentment or wounded feelings.



She gave him a gentle poke, her voice filled wvith amazement."Carl, doesn't this make you angry at all?"


Confusion painted Carl's features. "Why would I feel angry? You're the most extraordinary person I know I'm absolutely ecstatic, not upset in the slightest."



"But I deliberately misled you, spinning stories about how I can get a work of Riley..." Eliana's explanation carried the weight of her guilt.



Carl's bewilderment deepened into pure joy. "But if you're Riley, that means I can request original artwork directly from the source! How could I possibly be unhappy about that? This is the most wonderful revelation imaginable!"



Eliana found herself rendered speechless by his boundless enthusiasm. The realization struck her powerfully-Carl possessed a genuinely pure and generous spirit that defied conventional expectations.Within his worldview, harboring resentment toward her appeared to be an impossibility. Apparently, no action of hers could diminish his capacity for  understanding and acceptance.



This profound recognition sent waves of deep emotion coursing through Eliana's heart.


While Carl remained lost in his euphoric state, Eliana suddenly seized his sleeve with urgent fingers,"Carl,since you've taken this revelation so well,let me share something that might actually provoke your anger,"



Carl's expression shifted to complete bewilderment,marveling at how even Eliana's cryptic statements somehow enhanced his admiration for her mysterious complexity.
###Chapter 81 I'm Going To Get The Truth From Her Right Now


Carl's gaze softened as he leaned toward Eliana. "Lia, you can tell me anything. I promise I won't get upset,"he said, his voice steady with determination.

More than anything, he wanted to shower Eliana with every ounce of care he had to give.

She hesitated only a moment before stating, "I think Leyla's sudden trip back to our he for her clothes was just an excuse. From the hallway camera, I saw her slip upstairs and go into your room. I'm worried she was there to copy your paintings."

The color drained from Carl's face, his composure snapping despite his vow. "I'll question her right now," he growled.

In the past, if Leyla had tried to mimic his work, he would have brushed it off-art had never been something he guarded jealously.

But now, everything had changed. When their family collapsed, Leyla's first instinct had been to cut all ties with them.

Worse still, she had gone so far as to sell their home without a second thought, even if it left them wandering without a home.

To Carl, that kind of cold-blooded betrayal meant she didn't deserve to benefit from him in the slightest.He would rather burn every canvas he owned than allow Leyla to copy a single brushstroke.

He started to storm off to confront her, but Eliana stepped quickly into his path."Carl, where are you heading?" she asked, her hand lightly catching his arm.

"You're suspicious of her, aren't you? I'm going to get the truth from her right now!" Carl said, his voice edged with anger.

Eliana found herself momentarily speechless, realizing that being too blunt and straightforward wasn't always the smartest path. With a weary sigh, she murmured, "Carl, don't be impulsive. If you rush to confront her now, she'll just deny everything. It's better to wait until her painting is actually on display. Once you're certain she copied yours,then you can expose her in front of everyone. If I'm wrong, though, it'll only give her the chance to turn things around and put the blame on us instead."

Deep down, Carl felt almost sure Leyla had slipped into his room under the guise of collecting her belongings, when in reality, she wanted another look at his work.

After all, she had plagiarized him before-her last victory at a competition had been with a painting that was nothing more than a stolen version of his own.

Though Carl couldn't stand Leyla, he swallowed his anger for the sake of the Murray family's dignity.

Since Eliana had urged him not to act recklessly, he forced himself to hold back.

He always listened to her, trusting she would never steer him wrong.

After a moment's thought, he gave a reluctant nod. "Alright, I'll let it go for now. Once the competition results are announced,every painting will be on display."

Eliana's lips curved into a gentle smile. "Exactly. We need to stay composed when it matters most."

"I'll listen to you." He dipped his head once more, this time with quiet resolve.

Eliana reminded with calm insistence, "But don't reveal that I'm Riley just yet-especially not to Mom.Her health is still fragile, and the last thing she needs is any emotional shock. What matters most is keeping her steady."

Since Stella's well-being was at stake, Carl gave in at once. He lifted a hand as if taking an oath. "Relax, Lia.I might enjoy swapping stories now and then, but I'm not careless. I know when to keep my mouth shut."

Her shoulders eased a little, and she gave a small nod. "Alright, then."

While the two of them spoke quietly, every contestant had already set down their brushes, and the judges moved on to deliberation.

Soon the results would light up the massive screen in the main exhibition hall, drawing the crowd out of the lounge and back into the center of the event.

Tristan, as the organizer, stayed out of sight, overseeing the process with the judges instead of appearing among the guests.

From the lounge, Jeffry and Hector emerged together, with Leyla slipping silently in their wake.

The strange silencing effect still clung to her like a shadow, leaving her unable to speak.

Hector noticed nothing unusual, assuming her wordless tension was just nerves.

With a faint smile meant to reassure her, he murmured, "Don't let it get to you. I trust you."

Her lips pressed together as she nodded, emotions twisting in her chest. Almost unconsciously,her gaze swept over the crowd in search of Eliana.

She spotted her almost at once-Eliana's presence was impossible to overlook.

But then her eyes shifted, and she froze when she saw Carl standing firmly at Eliana's side. Her eyes flew wide,leaving her mind briefly blank.

She hadn't anticipated running into him here.

Panic prickled at the edges of her thoughts. If Carl recognized her painting as a stolen imitation of his,everything she'd worked for would crumble.

Her fingers twisted the fabric of her skirt in a tight grip as her thoughts raced.

She couldn't allow Carl to remain here-not if she wanted her secret to stay hidden.

She whipped out her phone and hurriedly typed a message to Carl "I need to speak with you alone. It's about something important concerning your family. Could you step out for a moment?"

A second later, the screen flashed a notification-her message hadn't gone through.

The truth sank in-Carl had already shut her out by blocking her number.

Rage flared in her chest. Her fingers curled into tight fists as she brushed past Hector without sparing him a glance, striding straight toward Carl.

At that exact moment, the constricting silence lifted.

Her throat loosened, and when she tentatively tested her voice, words came freely. Relief flickered across her face.Luck was finally on her side again.

Picking up her pace, she quickly closed the distance between them until she was standing right in front of him.

"Carl.." she purred, her tone smooth and syrupy, as though nothing had ever gone wrong between her and the Murray family.

A frown tugged at Carl's face on instinct."If you've got something to say, then spit it out. Don't talk to me in that disgusting voice."

A shadow swept across Leyla's expression without warning.

The moment she noticed the mocking smirks flickering among the onlookers, her cheeks burned darker.

She couldn't believe Carl would humiliate her so openly, especially when they had once been family.

Biting back her temper, she steadied herself, cleared her throat, and forced her voice back into its natural tone. "Carl, there's something urgent I need to discuss with you. Could we step outside for a moment?"

Carl's scowl grew heavier, cutting deep lines across his face. "I don't have a single word to waste on you."

Leyla had anticipated Carl's resistance, so she had already armed herself with bait.

She leaned in, her voice dropping to a hushed whisper. "It's about Rowell. Don't you want to hear?"

Carl's features tightened, a flicker of hesitation breaking his composure.

Seizing the moment, Leyla pressed on. "Aren't you curious why Rowell's career has stalled all these years?
His acting is sharp, his résumé solid-yet success never comes his way." Her words hooked him instantly. Carl faltered, about to let her lead him outside when Eliana suddenly stepped in. "Carl, where are you going?" she asked, catching his movement.

He shifted uneasily, guilt flashing across his face. "I... I just have something to handle. I'll be back soon," he muttered.

Eliana's gaze lingered on Leyla, quietly certain the outburst had been stirred up by her.

With a calm smile, she leaned toward him and said softly, "No matter how urgent it feels, wait until the competition is finished first."

Carl shifted uncertainly, caught between the two.

Seeing him hesitate, Leyla quickly pressed in, her tone urgent. "You need to think clearly. Don't let someone who doesn't understand delay you."

The remark snapped Carl back into place. His jaw tightened, and he shot her a sharp look. "Don't you dare talk about Lia that way. She's right-whatever it is,it can wait until the competition's over. A few minutes won't change anything."

"You..." Leyla choked on her words, unable to respond.

When Carl refused to budge, her eyes burned with fury as she shot Eliana a venomous glare.

Why did that fucking bitch always manage to wreck her plans? Resentment twisted hot in her chest until it nearly consumed her.

Yet for all her hatred, there was nothing she could do against Eliana, and the helplessness gnawed at her until she felt as though her skin might crawl apart.

At that moment, a voice boomed from the main exhibition hall's speakers. "The results of the annual oil painting competition are now officially announced. Please turn your attention to the big screen!"
###Chapter 82 Two Champions


Leyla's heart hammered against her ribs like a caged bird desperate for escape upon hearing the announcement.

Terror of discovery drove her away from Eliana and Carl's vicinity with urgent steps, propelling her back toward the safety of Hector and Jeffry's presence.

However,a suffocating dread continued to coil through her chest like poisonous smoke.

"Leyla, are you alright? Your face has gone completely white. Are you feeling sick?" Hector's voice carried genuine worry as he registered the ghostly pallor that had drained all color from her features.

Jeffry's sharp gaze swept over her with curious concern, searching for answers in her troubled expression.

Leyla summoned a brittle smile that felt like it might shatter at any moment. "I'm perfectly fine."

The moment those hollow reassurances escaped her lips, her anxiety swelled into a crushing wave that threatened to drown her composure.

Following a moment of desperate calculation, Leyla sank her teeth into her lower lip and ventured carefully,"Jeffry, I understand how demanding your schedule must be. If urgent matters require your attention elsewhere, please don't feel obligated to remain here. We can certainly update you on the competition outcomes later."

Jeffry's brow creased with puzzlement, while Hector mirrored his bewildered expression.

Hector's confusion spilled into his words. "Leyla, what's gotten into you? The results are being revealed at this very moment, and Dad came specifically to witness your triumph in person."

Jeffry's head moved in agreement, his typically stern features softening with unexpected kindness as he offered comfort. "There's no need for such overwhelming nerves. Even if victory eludes you today, life wvill continue, and other opportunities will arise." Her acceptance as Davi's student had already secured her artistic future with promising prospects.

Consequently,regardless of today's outcome, Jeffry's perception of her worth had evolved significantly,opening doors for her to demonstrate her capabilities.

The smile that twisted Leyla's lips resembled a pained grimace more than any expression of joy as his words reached her ears.

Desperation clawed at her as she realized the futility of her situation-Jeffry remained immovable, and Carl proved even more impossible to divert from his purpose.

Her only refuge lay in desperate, silent prayers that Carl would remain oblivious to her theft, or that some miraculous emergency would demand his immediate departure.

Under such circumstances, her artistic crime would remain buried in shadows, known to no one.

Though Leyla's thoughts spun like a tempest of panic and calculation, the clock had advanced merely two agonizing minutes.

Without warning, electric excitement rippled through the assembled crowd as the massive screen in the main hall blazed to life with the champion's identity.

"Hurry! Let's see who won!"

"The winner's name is finally revealed!"

Humanity flowed toward the display like a rushing river, their collective mass blocking the crucial announcement from distant view.

Hector seized Leyla's hand and carved a path through the dense crowd with determined force.

Jeffry preserved his dignified composure as a man of influence, refusing to join the undignified scramble,yet his keen eyes remained fixed on Hector's face, ready to read victory or defeat in his son's expressions.

Simultaneously, Eliana and Carl joined the surge of bodies pressing toward the revelation.

The moment Eliana's presence became known, the masses automatically created a respectful path, allowing her unobstructed passage.

In the following heartbeat, the screen blazed with three bold characters that seemed to burn themselves into everyone's retinas: "Champion, Leyla Murray."

Eliana's eyebrows drew together in a delicate frown of confusion. Something felt terribly wrong-how had Carl been denied the victory that should have been his?

Doubt began creeping into her usually confident assessment, making her question whether her instincts had led her astray.

The logic seemed impossible-if Leyla had indeed stolen Carl's work, how could the copy somehow eclipse the original masterpiece?

Carl's eyes found the crushing announcement, and disappointment settled across his features like a heavy shroud.

"I'm sorry, Lia. I've failed you completely." His apology emerged as barely more than a whisper,heavy with self-reproach.

Eliana emerged from her stunned state and offered him a gentle shake of her head, accompanied by a warm smile meant to ease his pain. "Don't worry about it, Carl. This is merely one competition among many.Losing today doesn't diminish your incredible talent in the slightest."

Despiteher reassuring words, Carl's spirits remained crushed under the weight of defeat.

A heavy sigh escaped his lips as he admitted, "It appears our suspicions were completely unfounded."

Eliana's head moved in reluctant agreement, experiencing the unfamiliar sensation of questioning her usually reliable instincts.

At the same moment, Leyla and Hector's eyes absorbed the shocking revelation.

Pure joy transformed Hector's face as his fingers closed around Leyla's hand with triumphant pressure."Leyla, didn't I tell you those nerves were unnecessary? You've claimed the championship! My heartiest congratulations!" From his vantage point, Jeffry witnessed the explosion of happiness across his son's features and drew the obvious conclusion. He advanced through the crowd and verified that Leyla's name indeed blazed across the display in letters of victory.

Relief flooded through him instantly as he reconsidered his son's romantic choices with newfound respect-perhaps Hector's judgment possessed more merit than he had previously acknowledged.

"Congratulations," Jeffry said.

Even as triumph coursed through her veins, an undercurrent of anxiety continued to poison her joy.

The terrifying possibility that Carl would recognize his stolen creation the moment it appeared on screen haunted her thoughts like a specter.

This fear drove her to seek escape as she announced with forced casualness, "Thank you both so much.There's an urgent matter I must handle briefly-I'll return momentarily."

Jeffry granted his permission with a nod, while Leyla's gaze zeroed in on Eliana and Carl with predatory focus, drawing courage from a deep breath before advancing toward her targets.

She carefully crafted a mask of serene composure, employing honeyed tones calculated to irritate and provoke them into leaving. "How thoughtful of you both to remain here just to offer your congratulations."

Carl's eyes blazed with barely contained fury as he opened his mouth to unleash his thoughts, but Eliana's restraining hand silenced him before the words could escape.

"Indeed, congratulations on obtaining exactly what you desired. Carl, we should take our leave now," she declared with cool dignity.

Carl's agreement came with a sharp nod, but just as they prepared to depart, an imposing figure materialized through the crowd, flanked by an intimidating phalanx of professional bodyguards.

The commanding presence belonged to none other than Tristan himself.

Every gaze in the vicinity snapped toward him like iron filings drawn to a powerful magnet.

Davin, Larry, and the remaining panel of judges formed a distinguished procession behind Tristan's authoritative figure.

Tristan's voice carried across the hushed crowd with deliberate gravity, "Ladies and gentlemen,concerning today's competition results, the judging panel encountered significant disagreement regarding the rightful champion.Following extensive deliberation, we reached a unanimous decision that this year's competition shall honor not only Leyla Murray, but also a second, equally deserving champion."

His announcement ignited an immediate explosion of excited chatter that rippled through the assembled spectators.

"What? A second champion?"
少
"Who could it possibly be? Were the works so evenly matched?"

Eliana's eyes automatically sought Carl's face before swiveling toward Tristan with growing anticipation.

Tristan's gaze found hers at that precise moment, his mouth forming the ghost of a smile as he proclaimed with crystal clarity, "The second champion is Carl Murray."

The announcement struck. Leyla like a physical blow, her eyes flying wide with pure terror and disbelief.Carl?! The name echoed through her mind like a death knell. How was this possible?! Had he taken part in the competition too? When was this? How had she remained completely oblivious to his participation?Wasn't painting merely a casual hobby for him, something he pursued without any competitive ambition?What had driven him to break that pattern now? Questions bombarded her consciousness like artilleryfire.

Panic crashed over her in devastating waves, making her legs tremble and her world tilt dangerously off its axis.

Though surprise flickered across her features, Eliana's face blossomed into genuine joy as she offered her heartfelt praise. "Carl, you've achieved championship status as well! This is absolutely wonderful news!"

Carl, still reeling from the unexpected honor, broke into a radiant smile that transformed his entire face upon hearing her celebration. "This is incredible! I haven't disappointed you after all."

A bittersweet smile tugged at Eliana's lips as she recognized that Carl valued her approval far more than any competitive victory could ever mean to him. At that crucial moment, Tristan's voice commanded attention once more. "The time has arrived to unveil the masterpieces created by our dual champions."

Eliana's eyebrow arched with knowing anticipation as her gaze shifted meaningfully toward Leyla.

Exactly as she had predicted, Leyla's complexion drained of all color in an instant.

The sight confirmed what her instincts had been screaming all along-her judgment remained as sharp and reliable as ever.

In the next breath, the massive screen illuminated with both Carl and Leyla's artistic creations displayed side by side.

One canvas captured the delicate beauty of wintersweet blossoms, while the other blazed with the golden radiance of sunflowers.

Despite the contrasting subject matter, the artistic techniques and stylistic approaches were so remarkably alike they could have emerged from a single hand.

An untrained observer might easily assume both masterpieces had flowed from the same creative genius.

The assembled spectators erupted into another wave of animated discussion.

"Now I understand why they both claimed victory! These pieces are absolutely breathtaking-no wonder the judges struggled to choose between such extraordinary talent."

"With artistic abilities of this caliber, both champions are destined to become legendary figures in the oil painting community!"

However, several particularly observant individuals began expressing troubling concerns.

"Am I the only one who notices that these two paintings share an unnervingly identical artistic style?"
 
###Chapter 83 Are You Threatening Me

The announcement sparked an uproar that rippled through the hall. People's curiosity quickly snowballed into a chorus of speculation.

"Why do these paintings look almost the same?"
"It feels like the same artist painted both pieces."

"That's right! Notice how the petals are outlined and how the whole image comes together. They're practically from the same painter!"

The rising whispers reached Leyla's ears, and color drained from her face. Jeffry and Hector no longer crossed her mind. Escaping this place was the only thought pressing against her chest. Everything else could wait.

Yet,before she couldslip past the crowd, a slender but unyielding hand clampedaround her arm.
"Running off so soon?" Eliana's lips curled up, but her voice carried a dangerous edge.

Normally, she wouldn't waste time dragging someone down in public, but Leyla had crossed the line by stealing Carl's design for her own advantage.

When hardship fell on the Murray family, Leyla had been the first to abandon them. Now that opportunity was at stake, she dared to crawl back-and claim Carl's work as hers.

She clung when it benefited her, discarded when it didn't. The world didn't bend so easily to that kind of selfishness.

This wasn't about petty humiliation. Eliana wanted fairness restored.
"Get your hands off me!" Leyla snapped in a low voice, her eyes glittering with fury beneath the makeup,though her tone lacked courage.
With a calm, almost mocking smile, Eliana replied, "I'll let you walk away. Just not this moment." While speaking, she cast a knowing look at Carl.

Catching her signal, Carl moved toward Tristan and Davin without hesitation.

Leyla's first instinct was to reach out and stop him. However, Eliana's grip on her arm was unyielding, giving her no room to break free.

Any attempt to push forward was instantly shut down.

Frustration welled up inside Leyla as she watched Carl already launching into an explanation for Tristan and Davin.

Davin's expression darkened as his brows drew together. "Wait a minute. Are you telling us Leyla stole your idea?"

Carl replied without flinching, "She didn't just take my concept. She recreated my entire painting. There's an identical painting sitting in my room right now. If you need proof, I can have someone bring it over."

Davin opened his mouth to respond, but a sudden thought made him pause.

Pulling out his phone, he scrolled through his gallery and held the screen out to Carl. "Do you recognize this one?"

One glance was enough for Carl to recognize the painting. "That design came from me too, but those brushstrokes aren't mine. Someone else painted it."

In other words, another blatant plagiarism.

Davin's expression grew even darker.

Realization dawned for Tristan, who now saw the direction Eliana wanted to steer this confrontation. He couldn't hide his amusement. Anything with her at the center had a way of pullinghim in.

He spoke up, saying, "Let's not jump to conclusions without proof. Since today's event is tied to Pearson Group's latest launch... Mr. Murray, if you're willing, let's get that painting brought here."

"Absolutely!" Carl wasted no time pulling out his phone and punched in Jordy's number, his tone brisk. "Bring the painting right away. Yes, the one on the desk dated the first of this month."

"Right away!" Jordy ended the call and rushed off to retrieve it.

Luckily, the Murray estate sat only a short drivefrom the exhibition hall, and with clear roads, twenty minutes would be more than enough.

Tristan shared a quick glance with Rocco, who instantly got the message and hurried backstage. Rocco's voice rang out over the speakers. "Attention, everyone. Due to a recent development in the competition,we'll be delaying the announcement of the final winner by thirty minutes. We apologize for the unexpected wait and appreciate your patience."

That brief announcement sent a new wave of whispers rippling through the crowd. "Weren't they supposed to share the championship? Why is there trouble now?"

"Honestly, it's not surprising. Since this contest is about picking a lead designer, only one can win in the end. They have to make a decision."

Meanwhile,a few in the audience who knew the art world started putting the pieces together.

"Could it be that the paintings look too much alike?"

"Maybe we're looking at a case of plagiarism."

Speculation buzzed around the venue, but all eyes now watched for any hint about who would take the crown.

Finally, Eliana let go of Leyla's hand.

Whether Leyla stood there or not, the truth would surface all the same.

Still, Leyla refused to surrender.

She rushed toward Davin, voice trembling with uncertainty. "Mr. Gordon, please..."

Davin averted his eyes. "I've got nothing to say to you right now."

Suspicion kept him silent. Leyla would get nothing more from him until every piece of evidence was in place. A flicker of worry darkened Leyla's features. "Please, I'm begging you-don't let their lies fool you. I need you to believe me."

Davin answered without a trace of feeling, "No matter what the truth is, I'll uncover it soon enough.Lies or not, the facts won't stay hidden for long."

Leyla's fingers twisted together as she shot a desperate look at Carl.

Carl's expression remained icy, watching her like she was nothing more than a stranger.

Leyla's breath hitched. She'd sensed for a long time that he never truly accepted her.

Even so, she refused to stand idly by and do nothing. "Carl, could we have a word in private? I only need a minute."

"Say what you have to say."

"Let's step aside, just for a second."

"There's no need for secrets. If you've got something to share, spit it out."

Leyla bit back her frustration and said, "I need to tell you something important. It's about Rowell. Aren't you the least bit curious?"

The moment she brought up Rowell Murray, Carl's another brother, Carl paused, weighing her words,before finally walking with Leyla to a quiet corner.

Carl looked at her with little warmth. "Well? I'm listening."

Leyla clung to Carl's sleeve and said, "You already know my entry borrowed from your earlier work, don't you?"

"Borrowed, you say?" Carl let out a sharp laugh, skepticism written across his face. "Are you sure you didn't just take it outright?"

Years of hearing his biting remarks had taught Leyla how to mask her pain. She managed a strained grin and said, "That's right, I admit I copied. I'm only asking you to let it slide this one time. Think back to the days when we still called each other family. I swear I won't touch your work ever again."

"Family? Perhaps that word meant something before you made my mom put her name on those disownment papers. Whatever was left between us died that day."

Leyla let go of her hand, her voice trembling. "But if I tell you what's been holding Rowell back all this time-what's really kept him from makingit in the showbiz-would you help me, just this once?"

A flicker of surprise crossed Carl's face. "You're saying you actually know?"

"I do. But you' have to give me your word first. Otherwise, Rowell might never get his shot, and he'll be stuck playing bit parts forever."

Carl's stare grew sharper. "So you're threatening me now?"

"It isn't blackmail. I'm offering you a fair exchange. Does the deal interest you or not?"
###Chapter 84 Are You Thinking Of Turning Tristan For Help


Carl's fists tightened without him realizing, the veins along his forehead standing out in sharp relief.

"Since you already knew the truth, why keep it from me and Rowell?" His voice was sharp and cold.

With her lips pressed into a thin line, Leyla replied, "Because the mastermind is someone I can't afford to offend."

"You-" Carl began, his anger ready to spill over.

But Leyla cut him off without hesitation. "Carl, enough of this back-and-forth. Just give me a straight answer. Are you going to take this deal or not?"

Grinding his teeth so hard it hurt, Carl teetered on the edge of losing control.

Leyla's tone shifted suddenly, soft and coaxing. "Only this once. I'm asking you."

He shut his eyes for a moment, feeling pulled apart inside.

He knew letting Leyla have her way was wrong, and Eliana would see it as a betrayal.

But Rowell's situation weighed on him. After a long pause, he said, "Alright. I'll do it. Tell me what you need."

Leyla's shoulders dropped in relief, and a faint smile appeared. "It's simple. Just convince Rowell to move to a different agency. If he refuses, then getting him a new agent will do."

Carl's eyes stayed locked on her. "Are you saying his agent is behind the problem?"

Leyla waved her finger. "A mere agent? Please. He's only carrying out orders from higher up."

Carl's brow furrowed, suspicion creeping into his tone. "Higher up? Are you talking about Pearson Entertainment's top brass?"

"You could call it that," Leyla answered, tilting her head. "But it's not exactly them. Ever heard of Paula Pearson?" Carl gave a short nod. "I know her. She's Tristan's cousin."

"That's right. She couldn't get Rowell to care for her, so she pulled strings through the company's executives to make his career miserable. That's why he's been buried in forgettable roles, always kept out of the spotlight," I.eyla explained.

Heat rose in Carl's chest, and his hands trembled with fury. He remembered Paula well-she'd come to his home a few years ago.

His parents had treated her with warmth, but Rowell had never given her the time of day.

After that visit, Paula had disappeared from their lives.

Carl had assumed she had moved on. It hadn't crossed his mind that she'd been quietly sabotaging Rowell all this time.

"You should have told me this a long time ago!" he snapped.

Leyla shrugged casually and replied, "And what would that change? Rowell's locked into a ten-year deal with Pearson Entertainment. Walking away means paying a massive breach penalty. Plus, I don't think he's clueless. He's just been enduring it. But it won't last forever. Three more years, and he can finally walk free."

Carl's rage flared even hotter. "Three years? Do you have any idea how mnuch that costs an actor's career?"

An actor's prime was tied to the glow of youth. At only eighteen, Rowell had handed Pearson Entertainment the golden years of his career.

Carl couldn't stomach the idea that Rowell had to pay such a steep price simply because he had refused to be Paula's boyfriend.

It wasn't as though Rowell had wronged her-he had only failed to return her affections.

"Why are you directing your anger at me?" Leyla shot back, her lips pressed into a thin line. "Paula's still a Pearson. Honestly, Rowell was an idiot. Even if he didn't like her, he could have dated her, used the connection, and broken it off later. Instead, he pushed her away and made her despise him. Tell me that's not a mistake in judgment." "There's no point talking to someone who thinks like that," Carl remarked before turning to leave.

Leyla's steps quickened until she was beside him. "I've told you what's going on, so don't you dare back out now.Plus, I need you to clear something up-tell everyone we've been practicing painting together, which is why our work looks alike. For the accusation of copying, tell them you just remembered wrong. Oh, and you'll need to step down from the competition voluntarily. Understood?"

Carl's eyes lingered on her for a moment before he moved past without another word.

Leyla's lips curled into a self-satisfied smile. For all their constant bickering, she understood exactly what kind of man he was. Once he made a promise, his straightforward nature wouldn't allow him to break it.

The tension in her chest eased at last. Ever since she'd spotted him at the venue, the encounter had weighed heavily on her; now, that burden had lifted.

Pushing stray strands of hair back into place, she lifted her chin and stepped forward with confidence.

It didn't take long before Jeffry and Hector came into view, searching for her.

They spotted her emerging from the direction of the conference hall and rushed over to meet her.

Hector was quick to speak. "Leyla, where have you been?"

Leyla answered without flinching, "Carl stopped me because he wanted to talk. Why? Did something urgent come up?"

Jeffry leaned in, eager to know more. "Have you heard the announcement? What's this talk about the championship being disputed? I thought you already secured it. Did something go wrong?"

Leyla had rehearsed her response long before this moment. "This competition is mainly for the Pearson Group to find a chief designer for their new energy vehicle project. But there can only be one chief designer,so the championship needs further discussion."

Jeffry's face tightened. "Wait, are you telling me you might lose the championship?"

Leyla responded, "Don't worry, I know where I stand. Carl just tried to convince me to drop out by playing on our history as siblings. He admitted he doesn't measure up to me, and that's why he wanted me to step aside. Of course, I refused. The fact that he resorted to that tells me he's already cracking under the pressure."

Jeffry scowled, his expression darker now. "I always thought the Murrays had the same integrity as Eliana.I never imagined Carl would act like this."

The mention of Eliana made Leyla uneasy, though she kept it hidden. She said, "I can't really blame him. His family is in a rough spot right now, as you're aware. This championship feels like their lifeline."

Jeffry gave a slow nod. "I get it. He does need this win. Still, there's a right way and a wrong way to handle things. With Eliana keeping their family steady, they won't collapse. Besides, we'll give them some support.You can tell Carl that even if you walk away with the championship, the Clarke family is willing to bring him on as a designer."

Leyla gave a curt nod, showing little interest.

There wasn't a shred of concern in her heart for what might happen to the Murray family.

In truth, she wished for their misfortune to stretch on endlessly.

For her, their ongoing downfall would stand as proof that breaking away from them was the right move, and that none of them would ever get the chance to laugh in her face.

Elsewhere, Eliana caught up to Carl. "Carl, where did you disappear to just now?"

A bit of nervousness flashed across Carl's face as he answered, "Leyla approached me and wanted to talk about something."

Eliana fixed her eyes on him. "What did she want to discuss?"

Carl paused before answering, "It's about Rowell."

He took a breath and told Eliana what had happened.

"Paula Pearson?" Eliana repeated, glancing over at Tristan.

The moment she looked his way, Tristan noticed and locked eyes with her. But she turned her attention elsewhere, refusing to let him catch her staring.

She asked Carl further, "How is she connected to Tristan?"

"She's his cousin," Carl responded.

That was all Eliana needed to hear to understand why Paula could so easily move the top executives at Pearson Entertainment.

After all, Pearson Entertainment, a powerhouse under the Pearson Group, managed a roster of major celebrities and ranked among the biggest entertainment companies in the nation.

"That explains it," Eliana replied, ner head nodding in understanding. "I'll take care of this myself."

Casting a wary look in Tristan's direction, Carl dropped his voice. "Lia, what are you planning? Are you thinking of turning to Tristan for help?"
###Chapter 85 You Lied To Me!


Eliana's lips curved in an easy smile. "Please don't underestimate me. For something this small, I don't need anyone's help."

Carl had always thought highly of her. When he'd watched her kneel by the roadside and change a tire on her own, he'd known she wasn't like most girls.

Now that he knew she was Riley, he had even more reason not to doubt her. "I'm not underestimating you,"he said, his brows drawing together, "but this involves the Pearson family..."

The Murray family had never been on the same level as the Pearsons-and now, the gap was wider than ever.

Eliana simply patted his shoulder. "Relax. I've got my own way of handling it. Leave it to me."

Carl hesitated, then nodded.

For reasons he couldn't explain, he had a feeling there was nothing in this world she couldn't manage.

Before long,hurried footsteps approached.Jordy arrived, slightly out of breath.

Thanks to Tristan's prior arrangements, he met no resistance-Doran personally led him straight to Tristan.

The judges were already gathered in the meeting area, waiting.

Within minutes, they were following Tristan back to the main exhibition hall.

Tristan took the microphone from Rocco, then handed it to Davin. "She's your student. You should announce it."

Tristan's words landed like a weight in Davin's chest, making his heart ache. Clearing his throat, he stepped forward."Ladies and gentlemen..."

The crowdstilled instantly. People pulled closer. Leyla stood poised, her chin lifted slightly, a confident smile playing on her lips. Finally. This was it-the moment she would be named the winner.

She cast a glance toward Carl. He met her eyes briefly before turning away with an expression of cold disdain.

She didn't care what he thought. She'd achieved exactly what she wanted.

His opinion of her meant nothing.

In truth, his displeasure towards her was valid.

The spotlight meant for him was now on her. She'd taken credit for his work, and for that, of course, he resented her.

The audience leaned forward, anticipation buzzing through the air. This wasn't just a title.

The champion would become the chief designer for Pearson Group's new project and be hailed as a rising star in the art world. Soon, their name would be known across the country.

Davin's voice rang out. "The outstanding winner of today's competition is..."

Leyla's heart thrummed with excitement. She straightened, already imagining the applause, the flood of congratulations, and Jeffry's proud words.

She didn't expect what came next. "Carl Murray!"

For a second, Leyla's smile stayed, frozen in place-until the meaning sank in. Carl Murray? Her stomach dropped. No, that couldn't be right. It couldn't be. There had to be a mistake. According to their agreement,Carl should've pulled out of the competition long ago.

Beside her, Hector frowned. "Leyla, why isn't the champion-"

He didn't finish. Leyla was already moving, her heels striking the floor in sharp, deliberate beats as she closed the distance to Carl.

Carl was still speaking with Eliana when movement caught his eye. He stopped mid-sentence, his gaze shifting to Leyla as she strode toward them, her expression stormy. "Is there something you need?" he asked evenly.

"Something I need?" Leyla's laugh was bitter, almost mocking. "Don't play dumb with me. You know exactly why I'm here. You promised me! How could you go back on your word?"

Eliana blinked, glancing between them. "Carl... what did you promise her?"

Carl gave a light shrug. "Leyla, I did promise you. But l'also promised Lia I'd win a championship for her. And she asked first-"

"You lied to me!" Leyla's voice cracked with fury as she lifted her hand to slap him.

But before her palm could connect, Eliana's fingers closed around her wrist like a vice. "Everyone has a limit," Eliana said coldly. "How dare you try to hit my brother in front of me?"

"You bitch!" Leyla spat. "I should hit you too! This is all your fault-everything!" She tried to wrench her wrist free, but Eliana's grip didn't budge.

Leyla's other hand shot up,but Eliana was quicker. She shoved Leyla back hard.

Unprepared,Leyla staggered backward.Hector appeared just in time to catch her.

"Hector..." Her voice trembled, tears welling up and spilling down her cheeks.

Hector's jaw tightened. Nearly two years together, and seeing her so "wronged" pricked something in him.He steadied her, giving her shoulder a reassuring pat.

Then he turned to glare at Eliana. He said sharply, "Everyone deserves respect, no matter their position.How can you bully Leyla like this?"

He'd only seen Eliana shove Leyla and missed her attempts to strike first.

Eliana snorted, her tone laced with contempt."|diiot. Protecting an ungrateful traitor."

Hector's face darkened."You-"

Before he could finish, Davin's voice boomed through the speakers. "In addition to announcing the final champion, we have another matter to address. Effective immediately-Leyla Murray is permanently disqualified from The Infinite and banned from all official oil painting competitions."

Gasps rippled through the crowd. Leyla froze, her blood draining from her face.

"Why?" Hector was the first to speak, his voice ringing with outrage. "What could she possibly have done to deserve that?"

Leyla's hand clung desperately to his sleeve. "Hector... just let it go..."

"Let it go? No. You might stay silent, but I won't stand by while you're bullied."

"Hector, please..." she pleaded.

But Davin's voice cut through again, colder this time. "Since you insist on knowing, I'll tell you. The painting Leyla submitted in this competition has been proven to be a direct copy of Carl Murray's work. And not only this time-her winning piece in the last competition was alsoplagiarized from Carl. If you doubt me, look at the screen."

The big screen lit up, showing Carl's originals alongside Leyla's submissions.

The resemblance was undeniable-identical in composition and detail, the only difference being Carl's superior technique and more natural brushwork.

Hector stared at the screen, shock flashing in his eyes. Then he turned sharply to Leyla."Your paintings...you copied them from your brother?"
###Chapter 86 You're My Beloved Fiancée


Before Leyla could utter a word, Carl stepped forward with blazing displeasure etched across his face. "Let me make one thing crystal clear," he declared, his voice cutting through the crowd's murmur. "I don't have a sister who steals my work and lacks basic morals. My sister has always been Eliana-and no one else!"

His eyes flashed with righteous anger as he continued. "As for Leyla, when our family faced bankruptcy,instead of standing by us, she immediately demanded that my sick mother cut all ties with her and sign a formal document severing our family bond! I happen to have that very agreement right here. Everyone, see for yourselves!"

With those damning words, he pulled out the crumpled agreement and held it high for everyone to witness.

Leyla staggered backward, her legs threatening to buckle beneath her as the blood drained from her face.

The crowd erupted into shocked whispers that spread like wildfire through the gallery.

"Stealing someone's artwork is bad enough-it shows what kind of person she really is. But abandoning the family that raised her? That proves she's completely heartless."

"No wonder they banned her from future competitions. Someone like that has no right entering any contest ever again!"

"I heard the Murray family rescued,her from an orphanage when she was just a child. Without their kindness, she'd probably still be there. Talk about biting the hand that feeds you!"

"They must be cursed to have taken in such a backstabbing ingrate!"

As the cruel words crashed over her like ocean waves, Leyla's face drained of all color.

"Shut up, all of you!" she screamed, her voice cracking with desperate fury. "You know absolutely nothing about my situation, so how dare you judge me like this?!"

The accusation stung because it held a grain of truth-she had indeed cut ties with the Murray family the moment their financial empire began to crumble.

Yet deep in her heart, she believed they bore equal responsibility for what had happened.

Had they truly adopted her out of pure kindness, or was it simply because she looked like Eliana as a child?

She was convinced they had merely used her as a replacement to fill the gaping hole left by Eliana's disappearance,treating her like an emotional Band-Aid for their grief! If even married couples abandoned each other during major crises, why should an adopted daughter be held to a higher standard?

Armed with this twisted logic, Leyla convinced herself that she had done absolutely nothing wrong.

She remained certain that with her adorable childhood looks, countless other families would have eagerly adopted her without the Murrays ever entering the picture. Therefore, in her mind, she owed them absolutely nothing-not gratitude, not loyalty.

"You self-righteous hypocrites understand nothing about my life, yet you dare stand on your moral pedestals to condemn me!" she shrieked at the crowd, her carefully constructed facade finally shattering into a million pieces.

The gathered spectators shook their heads in unified disgust, their expressions growing darker by the second.



"Look at her-completely unrepentant even now!"

"Terrible people never see their own evil-that's what makes them so dangerous."

"Don't waste your breath on someone like her. Selfish people like that only care about themselves-she'll never listen to reason."

Though their voices fell silent, their eyes burned with increasing revulsion as they stared at Leyla like she was something toxic they wanted to scrape off their shoes.

Those contemptuous stares ignited a firestorm of rage and self-pity within Leyla's chest.

She whirled around to face Hector, tears streaming down her cheeks. "Hector, they're ganging up on me!They're being so cruel, andl-" "Enough! Just stop!" Hector's voice thundered, silencing everyone. "You stole someone else's masterpiece and lied to my face, making me believe it was your original creation. Leyla, you've disappointed me beyond words!" He shook his head slowly, his handsome features twisted with unmistakable disappointment and revulsion.

Leyla felt as though the ground had opened beneath her feet-she couldn't fathom that even Hector now looked at her with such obvious disgust.

The irony cut like a blade through her heart-after all, Hector himself had been the mastermind who suggested she abandon the Murray family during their darkest financial hour.

Since Jeffry harbored deep animosity toward the Murrays, Hector had whispered poisonous advice that cutting all ties might finally earn her Jeffry's acceptance.

Those manipulative words had driven her to ruthlessly draft the document that severed every bond with the people who had raised her from childhood.

But now he stared at her with the same cold disdain as every other person in the room. The betrayal felt like swallowing shards of glass-Leyla simply couldn't accept this cruel reality.

"Hector, you can't abandon me like this!" Leyla lunged forward and seized his hand with desperate fingers,her voice breaking with raw desperation.

However, he yanked his hand away as if her touch burned him. "Take some time to pull yourself together!"he snapped coldly.

With those cutting words, Hector spun on his heel and strode away without a backward glance.

Deep down, his feelings for her hadn't completely died, but today she had humiliated him so thoroughly that his pride couldn't bear it.

For the moment, the sight of her face made his stomach churn with shame and regret.

Jeffry had vanished like smoke the instant Leyla's plagiarism blazed across the massive display screen for eve ryone to witness. Just then, Tristan emerged from the crowd like an avenging angel and addressed Leyla with icy politeness."Please remove yourself from the premises immediately. We don't welcome individuals of questionable character."

Following his commanding words, Rocco and Doran materialized beside him like twin shadows. "Miss," they said in unison, their voices dripping with barely contained menace,I you walk out on your own two feet,or shall we 'assist' you with your departure?"

"I'll leave by myself! Leyla snarled at them with the fury of a cornered wildcat,her beautiful features twisted into an ugly mask of rage as she whirled around to make her humiliating exit.

As she stumbled toward the exit, she carved this moment of public disgrace into her memory like words etched in stone, swearing a silent oath that someday she would make every single one of them pay dearly for this humiliation.

After Leyla's dramatic departure, the excited chatter gradually faded into blessed silence.

The crowd's attention shifted like a tide toward Carl, showering the rising star of design and oil painting with enthusiastic congratulations and admiring praise.

Meanwhile, Tristan moved through the dispersing crowd with the fluid grace of a predator until he reached Eliana's side.

Leaning close enough that his breath tickled her ear, he murmured in a voice meant for her alone, "That was quite the spectacular drama you orchestrated. I'm curious-should I expect more such entertaining displays in the future?"

Eliana fixedhim with a withering glare that could have frozen hellfire. "Has anyone ever mentioned that you're incredibly nosy and should mind your own business?"

Tristan lifted his broad shoulders in an infuriatingly casual shrug. "Not really. You have the distinguished honor of being the very first."

"It seems your so-called friends are nothing but shameless flatterers who wouldn't recognize honesty if it slapped them in the face," Eliana observed with cutting sarcasm. Tristan arched one dark eyebrow with genuine amusement dancing in his eyes. "Well then, now I have the rare privilege of a friend who actually tells me the brutal truth."

"Who in their right mind said we were friends?" Eliana shot back with the speed of a striking viper.

"Oh, my mistake." Tristan tapped his forehead with exaggerated contrition, though his eyes sparkled with mischief. "I nearly forgot the most important detail-you're not my friend at all. You're my beloved fiancée."

Eliana rolled her eyes and hissed with arctic coldness, "Since you already have a girlfriend warming your bed,you should show some basic decency and keep your distance. I'd rather not deal with some jealous woman coming after me because of your wandering attention."

Tristan's casual demeanor cracked as a deep frown carved lines across his forehead. "Who the hell told you I have a girlfriend?"

"If you don't want the whole world to know about your romantic escapades, then maybe you shouldn't conduct them in public," Eliana sneered.

"I swear I don't-" Tristan began desperately, his usual composure finally cracking as he attempted to set the record straight.

However, before he could complete his urgent explanation, Davin materialized beside them with the worst possible timning imaginable.

"Riley, will you be gracing our city of Qidence with your presence for an extended visit?" he inquired with the eager anticipation.

Eliana's harsh expression melted into something warmer and more genuine as she turned to face the distinguished older gentleman."Yes."

"That's absolutely wonderful news! When your schedule permits, I would be deeply honored if you'd visit my humble home for coffee and perhaps share some of your invaluable wisdom with an old man."

Given the special bond they shared and the genuine affection she held for him, Eliana didn't hesitate for even a heartbeat before agreeing. "Splendid! Well then, I should take my leave now. After all the drama and excitement of today's events,I'm feeling rather drained and need to retreat home for some much-needed rest," Davin declared with a weary smile. Eliana had started to nod her understanding when something made her pause-Davin's usually vibrant complexion had taken on an unhealthy pallor that sent alarm bells ringing in her mind.
A concerned frown creased her brow as she studied his face with growing worry. "Davin, when was your last medical examination?"
Davin released a soft chuckle that held more resignation than humor. "At my advanced age, such things seem rather pointless. When the Grim Reaper comes calling, he comes calling. No sense in wasting precious medical resources on an old fossil like me." His tone remained deliberately light and dismissive, completely oblivious to the potential danger lurking within his own body.
Eliana's voice sharpened with professional concern. "Your color is all wrong-something's definitely not right. Please let me examine you properly."
"These weary old bones are just feeling their age, nothing more. A few hours of proper rest will have me right as rain again-mark my words." Davin brushed away her concern with a gentle yet firm gesture.

But Eliana's trained instincts refused to be silenced so easily. She frantically rummaged through her bag until her fingers closed around a small pill, which she pressed firmly into Davin's weathered palm.
Then she gripped his hand with both of hers, her voice deadly serious. "I suspect you may be developing a serious heart condition. Promise me that after you rest, you'll go straight to the hospitaI for a complete cardiac workup. If you experience any sudden chest pain or discomfort-any at all-swallow this pil immediately before calling an ambulance."
"Very well, if it will ease your worried mind." Davin carefully tucked the life-saving pill into his vest pocket,gave Eliana one last gentle wave, and slowly made his way toward the exit.
As hisfootsteps echoed through the marble foyer toward the grand entrance, he discovered Leyla lurking in the shadows like a predator lying in wait, her presence clearly no coincidence.
###Chapter 87 You Must Be Mistaken


"Mr. Gordon! It's me,Leyla!"

At the sound of her voice, Davin's expression darkened.

Flanked by two bodyguards, he had no intention of stopping.

But when she kept chasing after the car, breathless and desperate, he finally lifted a hand. The driver brought the car to a halt.

The window slid down, and Davin leaned back, expression flat as stone, waiting for her to catch up.

"Mr. Gordon!" Leyla's face was streaked with tears. "I thought you'd already given up on me."

His brows pulled together. "Don't get the wrong idea. I stopped only to make things clear. I don't take students with stained record. From this moment on, you're no longer my student. And you are not to use my name again."

Leyla's lips trembled, her complexion draining to paper-white. But she had expected this. She swallowed hard,forcing her voice steady."1know plagiarism was wrong... but I had no choice. My sister pushed me into it. She did it for her brother's sake."

Davin's eyes flickered, the first crack in his calm mask. He hadn't known. After exposing Leyla's plagiarism,he'd left unsettled-missing the scene where Carl delivered the severance papers.

He had no idea about the twisted ties between Leyla and Eliana.

Now,he was a little hesitate.

Seeing his hesitation, Leyla rushed on, "Please, just give me a moment to explain everything."

Davin was strict to the bone, bound by rules. But if there was another truth behind all this, he couldn't ignore it. Conveniently, there was a café nearby. He exhaled and gave a curt nod. "You have the time it takes to finish a cup of coffee."

Leyla's eyes lit up with relief."Thank you!"

He'd hear her out first before he decided to completely cut her off.

"Let's go," he said.

"Alright."

Inside, Leyla steered him to a private room away from prying eyes. "I'll have an lced Black," she told the waiter, then turned quickly. "What about you?"

"Anything will do."

"How about their signature drink?"

He gave a dismissive wave. "Doesn't matter." He wasn't exactly here to chill over drinks.

The drinks arrived soon after.

Davin took one sip, then cut straight through the silence. "Whatever you've got to say-say it now."

Leyla gripped her cup, eyes lowering. Her voice trembled as she began. "This morning, I planned to compete with my own skill. But before the contest even started, my sister came to me."

Davin's gaze sharpened.

"She told me she knew who my real parents were." Leyla's fingers tightened around the glass. "You know l was adopted and when she returned to the family, I was cast out. I begged her for answers about my parents, and she said if I wanted the truth, I had to follow her plan."

She took a shaky breath before continuing. "She forced me to copy her brother's painting-the champion,Carl Murray. That's why I did it. I never wanted to plagiarize!"

Davin studied her closely, his tone edged with doubt. "You expect me to believe that?"

"Of course! Think about it. Carl himself was competing. If I copied his work, wouldn't I just be digging my own grave? Why would I set myself up to be humiliated like that?"

Davin's expression darkened, deep lnes carving across his face. If she was telling the truth, then she wasn't the sole culprit-she had been cornered.

But then something clicked in his mind. Eliana Murray and Carl Murray Both had the surname Murray.His eyes narrowed.Could it be...

His curiosity piqued, Davin asked Leyla, "What is your sister's name?"

"Eliana Murray." Leyla blurted. "You saw her today-she's always beside Carl."

Silence.A heavy,suffocating silence. Davin's gaze snapped to her, sharp and cutting.

His stomach churned with disbelief. While he had been listening with patience, she had dared spin such a massive lie? If Eliana weren't his teacher, he might've bought Leyla's story.

His voice dropped low. "Are you absolutely sure everything you just said is true?"

Leyla caught the odd glint in his eyes but pushed on, nodding furiously. "I swear on my life. Everything I said is the truth."

The weight of her words only deepened the look on Davin's face.

He let out a low chuckle. "Leyla, do you know what my biggest regret latelyis?"

She blinked at him, startled."What?"

"Taking you as my student."

Her eyes widened in disbelief."Why?"

His voice cracked like a whip. "I must've been out of my mind to take in someone who fabricates lies so easily."

"No, please, I'm not lying. Everything I told you is true! You know my past, don't you?" A thousand retorts surged in Davin's mind, but he bit them back. He knew his teacher too well. This nonsense about a vicious sister and being cast out-it didn't deserve his breath.

He exhaled sharply.

"Enough. From now on, we have no connection. Don't dare say you are my student again. If you do, l'll take legaI action." He rose to leave.

Panic surged through Leyla, and she grabbed his sleeve. "You really don't believe me? I swear I was forced-Eliana threatened me, that's why I plagiarized Carl's-"

"Shut up!" The words thundered out, followed by the sharp crack of his palm against her cheek.

Leyla staggered, her ears ringing. Through the haze of pain, she still caught his furious voice.

"Lie to me if you want-I don't care. But you will never slander my teacher!"

His chest heaved, anger boiling. In that instant, Tristan's coldness toward Leyla came back to him, and Eliana's pointed words when Leyla tried to force her off the judging panel.

Back then, he hadn't understood. But now he did. He was truly losing clarity. To have taken someone like Leyla as his latest student.

Leyla's head snapped up, her face pale with shock. "Your teacher? When did I ever slander your teacher?"

Davin let out a cold sneer. "It seems you still don't know. That so-called 'vicious sister' of yours... is my teacher Riley."

Leyla's eyes bulged in shock. "You're saying Eliana is Riley? That's impossible! You must be mistaken!"

"Really?" He let out a cold snort. "I could be wrong about any other matter, but not this."
###Chapter 88 Refusing To Save Him


Leyla couldn't wrap her head around what she had just heard. How could Eliana possibly be the legendary oil painting master, Riley? Davin had to be mistaken. Or worse, Eliana had fooled him.

But then she remembered... Frieda had said the same thing. Her stomach twisted. Could it really be true?Was it possible Eliana was Riley?

Davin's voice cut through her thoughts. "When I hit a dead end in my painting, it was Riley who tutored me-personally. I begged her to take me in as her student. And you think I mistook her for someone else? Don't make me laugh."

Leyla's eyes bulged, nearly popping out of their sockets.

Personally tutored him? That meant he'd seen Riley face-to-face. And... Eliana really was his teacher. She had mocked Eliana right in front of Davin. She had shot herself in the leg.

The memory of his odd expression when she spoke... And Frieda's fury on the phone-everything snapped into place. Eliana wasn't some nobody. She was the great oil painting master herself.

Leyla's face went chalk white, then burned crimson in a rush of fury. Her jaw tightened, lips trembling as her expression froze.

She thought she could sweet-talk her.way into Davin's good graces, trick him into keeping her as a student.Little did she know she was making a fool of herself.

There was no way she could become his student ever again. She had only just gained the title of Davin's student, only just tasted it and it was slipping away before she'd even worn it properly.

Her whole body quivered with rage.

She wasn't sure whether she was angrier at Eliana... or at herself.

"Move," Davin snapped. "I'm done wasting my time." He shoved past her and headed for the door. He reached for the doorknob-then froze. A stabbing pain ripped through his chest. His breath caught,legs buckled, and he collapsed, clutching at his shirt as though he could hold his heart together with his bare hands.

Leyla stumbled forward, startled. "What's wrong?"

"My...chest..." He choked on the words, face twisted with agony.

Her pulse quickened. Why was this happening? "Do you-do you have a heart condition?"

At that moment, Davin remembered Eliana's warning before he left. She had told him something might be wrong with his heart and handedshim a pill, insisting he carry it.

With trembling fingers, he fumbled for it in his pocket.

The pill slipped from his hand, clinking against the floor and rolling to rest at Leyla's feet. His voice came out broken, desperate. "The pill... give me the pill..

Leyla bent to pick it up, her hand hovering over the small white tablet.

She straightened slowly, eyes narrowing as a cold gleam slid across her face. She said softly, twisting the pill between her fingers, "Didn't you just say I'm no longer your student?"

A thin smile curled her lips, sharp as glass. "Then why should I give this to you?"

His eyes widened in disbelief. He never imagined she could be this cruel. "Give it...to me..."

She tilted her head, voice laced with venom. "No. I despise Eliana Murray. So why would I give you, her student,the pill?"

A laugh bubbled from her throat, brittle and giddy, like she had just stumbled upon the sweetest irony.

Today had left her humiliated, disgraced beyond bearing. But if Davin died here, that shame would vanish.

And when Eliana learned her student was gone, surely she would grieve.

That thought alone filled Leyla with savage delight. Why would she save him? Davin's chest throbbed harder with every beat, pain exploding through his ribs. Gasping, he summoned the last of his strength, forcing out a broken plea. "Someone... help-"

Before he could finish, Leyla lunged forward, clamping her hand over his mouth.

The sound died in his throat.

Davin's eyes widened in horror. He clawed at her wrist, fingers trembling with desperation. But he didn't have much strength left.

His hands slipped uselessly against her skin, unable to break her grip.

His breath came shorter and weaker. His hold on her hand faltered, then slackened altogether.

His eyes fluttered closed, and his body sagged,motionless.

Leyla snatched her hand back on instinct, chest rising and falling in shallow bursts. But his fingers still clung to her, cold and rigid, leaving her frozen in place.

Was he...dead? She leaned closer, watching his chest. Nothing moved. No breath. No rise, no fall.

Her stomach twisted. Relief? Terror? She couldn't tell. Gritting her teeth, she pried his hand off hers. His fingernails dragged across her skin, leaving two angry, bloody scratches on her wrist.

"Ouch!" She winced, sucking in a sharp breath.

She quickly yanked down her sleeve to cover the marks.

Fear rushed in where her rage had been. Outside, Davin's bodyguards were waiting. They'd seen her bring him in. If he was dead... she'd be the first suspect. She needed to come up with something.

She began pacing, mind spinning, hands wringing together. Then an idea flashed in her mind.

Dragging Davin's limp weight, she propped him into a chair, slumping him forward as though he'd collapsed mid-thought. Her chest burned with the effort. She shoved the pill-the one that might have saved him-out the window into the greenery below.

By the time she was done, her lungs screamed for air. She steadied her breathing, smoothed her clothes, and ran to the door. Throwing it open, she cried out,voice trembling but loud enough to carry, "Help! Somebody help! Mr. Gordon just slumped!"

The two bodyguards outside dropped thei cigarettes, rushing in.

"Mr. Gordon!" one of them shouted, hurrying to Davin's side. They shook him, checked for a pulse,panic flashing in their eyes.

Davin remained unresponsive. One bodyguard grabbed his phone, calling for an ambulance while the other tried to administer emergency aid.

Leyla stood near the wall, wringing her hands, eyes wet with false tears.

The bodyguard on the phone split his attention, murmuring reassurances to Leyla even as he barked details to the emergency line.

Within moments, café staff crowded into the room, their anxious voices rising and overlapping until the air was thick with confusion and panic.


......

Meanwhile,across town, Eliana and Carl were just leaving the exhibition hall when Tristan's voice called out.

"Mr. Murray, wait a moment." Carl turned, polite. Tristan's eyes glinted. "You do know what the prize is for the winner this time, don't you?"

Carl nodded."Lia told me."

"Good." Tristan's lips curved faintly.

Carl chuckled. "If you don't mind, I can start right away."

Since the Murray family's downfall, their remaining money had been bleeding away fast. Servants had been dismissed, luxuries cut, but it wasn't enough.

Sawyer's project needed funding, and Carl had felt powerless-until now.

If Pearson Group gave him a position, at least he could shoulder some weight. Tristan gave a crisp nod. "Alright then. You can report to the branch office tomorrow. I'll have a position arranged."

Carl opened his mouth to thank him-when Rocco rushed in, face pale, voice breathless. "Mr. Pearson,something's happened."
###Chapter 89 Wasn't That Foolish Of Him


Tristan's brows drew together in suspicion. Rocco was usually composed-unlike Doran, he rarely looked rattled-so this unsettled edge immediately put him on guard.

"What happened?" Tristan pressed, his voice sharp.

Rocco's gaze flicked toward Eliana, who was already staring at him intently, waiting. "Word just came in-Mr.Davin Gordon suffered a heart attack."

Eliana's eyes flew wide, her body leaning forward as she demanded, "When did it happen? How is he now?Which hospital are they taking him to?"

"Only a few minutes ago," Rocco immediately answered. "He hasn't even reached the hospital yet. His family's rushing him to the hospial. If we leave right away, we might catch up."

Eliana shifted toward Carl, her words edged with urgency."Did you drive here?"

Carl gave a brisk nod.

"Hand me the keys," Eliana insisted firmly.

"Huh? Oh-sure..." He hadn't even finished processing her urgency when she snatched the keys straight from his hand and bolted.

Carl blinked at the empty space where she'd been. How could anyone move that fast? He then spun around,only to find Tristan had vanished as well.

What the hell? Did the two of them just slip away like smoke? When Carl shifted his gaze once more, Rocco was nowhere to be found.

Left standing there, Carl blinked in disbelief. Was he really the only normal person?

Thankfully, Jordy appeared just then, striding over with concern etched across his face. "Why are you out here by yourself? Where's Eliana?" "Jordy, can you give me a ride?" Carl asked.

"Of course."

"Good. Take me straight to the nearest hospital-right away."

"Got it!" Jordy answered, already moving.

After a short while, Carl found himself standing before an electric moped. "This is your means of transportation?" he asked, incredulous.

Jordy rubbed the back of his neck as he defended himself. "It's the weekend. Traffic's a nightmare, and I didn't want to crawl here in a car, so l figured this would be faster."

"Never mind. Just hand over the keys!" Carl snapped.

Snatching them from Jordy's hand, he mounted the moped and shot off without another word, leaving Jordy staring after him in stunned confusion. WVhy the rush?

Moments ago, Eliana slid into Carl's car, buckling her seatbelt. Before she could even settle in, the passenger door swung open.

Her brows knitted together as Tristan dropped himself into the seat beside her, leaning back with easy confidence, making it obvious he intended to tag along.

As her glare slid toward him, Tristan drawled with a crooked grin,"What? Am I not allowed to hitch a ride?"

Eliana's eyes flicked to the rearview mirror.

A sedan trailed them, Rocco behind the wheel. It was Tristan's car. Why had Tristan insisted on climbing into her car instead of his own?

Kicking him out would cost precious seconds, and time was the one thing she couldn't afford to waste. With a sharp press of her foot, she gunned the accelerator and shot onto the main road, weaving into traffic.

Her hands gripped the wheel with practiced ease, but the clogged streets quickly swallowed her momentum. A chorus of blaring horns boxed her in. She slammed her palm against her own horn, its shrill blast cutting through the din. But the jam refused to budge. A driver in the next lane rolled down his window, sneering as he lifted a middle finger, mocking her impatience.

"Damn it!" A shadow crossed Eliana's face, turning her features severe.

Had time not been slipping away, she wouldn't be blaring the horn in desperation.

Beside her, Tristan stayed composed, his voice steady as he tried to cut through her panic. "Take a breath.
The hospital is one of the best when it comes to cardiology. Davin will be in good hands."

Eliana's fingers tightened around,the steering wheel, knuckles paling as her pulse raced.

Tristan leaned slightly toward her, his tone firm yet patient. "Driving like this only makes things more dangerous.The faster you push, the messier it gets. You need to keep your head clear. When we get there,they might needyou-and if you burn yourself out on the road, you won't be able to help him at all."

Some of the tension in her expression loosened, her rigid shoulders sinking an inch.

"That's more like it," Tristan said quietly, a faint nod of approval softening his features.

Eliana kept her eyes locked on the gridlocked road, her teeth tugging anxiously at her lower lip.

Her voice came out low, almost as if she were talking to both Tristan and herself. "This happened because of me."

Tristan glanced at her,brow creasing in confusion.

Drawing in a shaky breath, she admitted, "When he walked out earlier, I could tell he wasn't well. I should've gone with him-should've pushed him to see a doctor. But I didn't. I convinced myself he was just tired."

A faint scowl pulled at Tristan's face as he answered, "You've already done your part. Nobody can predict everything. If people could see every accident coming, the world would be nothing but panic."

Her lips parted as though she wanted to argue, but no words came.

Despite his usual mischief, she couldn't deny that his blunt reassurance had steadied her heart more than
she expected. Like a steady hand calming the turmoil inside her, the thought cracked her open.

"At first, I never wanted to take him as my apprentice. Taking on an apprentice means a responsibility and would complicate things."

Just like today. If she hadn't known Davin, if there were no ties between them, she wouldn't be carrying this weight now.

"But you still accepted him," Tristan remarked, his gaze fixed steadily on her.

She halted briefly, a strained laugh escaping before she went on,"YOUmight think Davin is easygoing, but once he sets his mind on something, there's no shaking him off."

"How so?" Tristan asked, his voice steady.

He had a way of listening that made her feel as if every word mattered. His gaze stayed fixed on her face,calm and attentive, and that quiet respect loosened something in her chest.

Turning her eyes away, she added, "The moment I helped him that first time, he started showing up again and again, pestering me toa take him as my apprentice. Back then, he didn't know I was Riley. Each visit he dragged along gifts, piling them higher and higher. I grew so weary of it that I packed up and moved elsewhere. But months later, when I finally returned to my old place, I discovered he'd been waiting there day after day, never leaving. That winter the snow fell thick and merciless, yet he stood in it as if the cold couldn't touch him. I began to fear he really might freeze to death. In the end, I had no choice. To keep it from turning into a matter of life and death, I finally took him in as an apprentice. The instant I agreed, he dropped to his knees in the snow and bowed deeply-then collapsed right there in the frost. Tell me,wasn't that utterly foolish of him?"

Though her tone was chastising, her reddened eyes betrayed her feelings.

Tristan silently extended a tissue, but Eliana ignored it, stubbornly swallowing her tears.

When he pulled the tissue back, a notion flickered across his mind-if she had once taken Davin as an apprentice out of pity, maybe, with persistence, he too might...

Before the thought could form fully, Eliana's gloom suddenly lifted. She leaned forward, hastily cranking down the car window. "Carl!" she called out.

Tristan followed her line of sight and spotted Carl zooming past on an electric moped.

"Lia? You're still stuck here?" Carl queried, his voice carrying over the hum of the motor.

Without wasting breath, Eliana lunged forward and seized the moped's handlebars. "Get down, Carl! We're switching!"

"Huh? Oh, alright," Carl stammered, nodding quickly. He slid off the seat, and Eliana swung herself onto it in one swift motion.

"Careful. This thing packs more power than it looks," Carl warned, hovering uneasily beside her.

She gave a curt nod, tossed the car keys into his hand, and prepared to speed away-when the seat behind her sank under sudden weight.

Eliana darted a glance over her shoulder. Somehow, Tristan had slipped out of the car without her noticing and made himself comfortable on the back.
###Chapter 90 He Doesn't Trust Her


Eliana narrowed her eyes at Tristan. "Why are you following me again?"

Tristan arched a brow, lips curving with mischief. "Take me with you."

"No." Her refusal was sharp, merciless."You're too heavy. You'll just slow me down. Get off."

His expression faltered, feigning hurt. "Can't believe you're this heartless. I was just comforting you earlier,and now you're tossing me aside like some broken tool?"

Elianna didn't blink. "Get off," she repeated.

With a sigh, Tristan shifted to climb down-then paused, as if remembering something. "You sure you want to ditch me? My presence has its worth you know. You could use my pull."

Eliana hesitated, lips pressed into a thin line. After a brief pause, she gave in. "Fine. Hold on tight.If you fall,it's not my problem."

Tristan's arms slid firm around her waist.

Eliana stiffened, her face darkening. She almost shoved him off on the spot.

"Didn't you tell me to hold on tight?" he said innocently,eyes gleaming with mischief. "If | fall-"

"Shut up and hold still!" she snapped. The throttle roared as she twisted it hard.

The moped shot forward, tires screeching lightly against the asphalt. Eliana forced herself to ignore the weight of his arms cinched around her waist.

At least he behaved-his hands stayed steady, not daring to roam.

And that was for his own good.

If he tried anything, she wouldn't care about his status-she'd throw him off in a heartbeat. The moped weaved swiftly through traffic, cutting straight toward the hospital.

On the way, curious onlookers rolled down their windows, jeering at Tristan for being a grown man letting a woman drive him.

But Tristan only sat there with the faintest curl of a smile on his lips-smug, arrogant, and so infuriating it made one's palms itch to smack him.

Luckily, Eliana was too focused on reaching the hospital to notice his expression.



On the surgical floor, Leyla paced restlessly, heels clicking against the cold tile.

It wasn't Davin's survival she worried about-quite the opposite. She prayed he would die quickly.

If he woke up and revealed she had refused to give his pill back, she would be facing jail term. If she had known he still had a chance of surviving, she would have waited until he was brain dead before calling for help. She had been careless.

"Miss Murray."

Davin's son, daughter-in-law, and grandson had just rushed over. Believing Leyla had found Davin unconscious and called for help, they thanked her profusely.

Jonny Gordon, Davin's grandson, approached with a bottle of water. "Miss Murray, you've been waiting here with us for so long. Please sit down and have some water."

"Thanks, but I don't needit." Leyla shook her head, feigning real concern.

Until she was certain Davin was dead, she couldn't relax.

Her refusal only deepened Jonny's gratitude. "You said earlier my grandpa took you as his student. If he knew how much you cared for him, he'd be touched. But your health matters too-you shouldn't wear yourself out."

"Alright... thank you." This time she accepted the water. Their fingers brushed lightly, a fleeting touch.

Jonny froze. A strange coolness lingered on his fingertips.

When he glanced up, he caught the shimmer of her watery eyes, the smoothness of her skin. His heart gave a sudden, unfamiliar thump.

Raised strictly by Davin, Jonny rarely interacted with women. Even the accidental brush of Leyla's fingers sent blood rushing to his face.

Leyla noticed, of course.

But with Davin's fate still hanging in the balance-and knowing the Gordons, for all their wealth, were still beneath the Clarke family's standing-she brushed it aside.

She brought the bottle to her lips with practiced grace, taking a small sip. Afterwards, she resumed her pacing, unable to bring herself to stay calm.

The door swung open at last.

A doctor in scrubs stepped out, mask hiding most of his face.

Leyla's eyes lit up. She rushed forward even faster than the Gordons."Doctor,how is he?"

The doctor said, "We're doing our best to save him. But we need a family member to sign the surgical consent.Are you his family?"

Leyla's smile thinned. She shook her head and stepped back. Davin might actually survive? At his age,surviving this ordeal was nothing short of remarkable. Most people his age never made it past the operating table.

"Doctor, does he have a real chance of making it?" Davin's son, Stan Gordon, asked anxiously after signing the consent.

The doctor hesitated. "I'm not the lead surgeon, so I can't say for certain. But you should prepare yourselves for any outcome. At his age, there's a strong possibility he won't pull through." Stan and his wife were visible shaken bythe news.

Leyla,however, felt her heart lift. Davin might not pull through? Great news.

"Please, doctor, do everything possible! Money is no issue," Stan pressed.

"We'll do our best," the doctor assured before turning back toward the OR.

At that moment, a cool, cutting voice broke across the corridor."Leyla? What are you doing here?"

Everyone stiffened, eyes snapping towards the direction of the voice.

From the end of the corridor, aslender figure approached. She seized Leyla's wrist, eyes burning. "I'm talking to you! Why are you here?"

Pain shot through Leyla's arm, her composure cracking.

She glared, startled at the sight of her.

Eliana?

Her long hair, disheveled by the wind, framed her striking face, lending her an edge both wild and captivating.

Leyla's gut clenched with a surge of panic.

She swallowed hard, masking it with a feigned calm."Let go of me-you're hurting me!"

Before Eliana could answer, a firm hand closed around her wrist.

Jonny.

He didn't know who she was, only that she was striking-and far too forceful. Her sharp tone and domineering grip left an immediate sour impression. "Miss, whoever you are, let go of Miss Murray."

The Gordon couple rushed forward. "Who are you?"

Expressionless, Eliana released Leyla's wrist but didn't break eye contact. Her gaze stayed locked on Leyla, cold and probing, as if stripping away the mask Leyla wore. Her instincts bristled. Davin himself had exposed Leyla for plagiarizing Carl's work-there was no way she was standing here out of genuine concern.Something else was at play.

But the Gordon family's interference stopped her from digging further.

"I'm Eliana Murray," she said evenly, letting her eyes sweep over the family. "Davin is my student."

Her words landed in silence,met with skeptical stares.

Jonny's jaw tightened. The way she had handed Leyla already created a bad impression on him.He couldn't trust anything she said.grandpa,your student? You've got to be joking."
###Chapter 91 Hospital Director's Endorsement


Stan's voice was ice-cold. "Miss, if you're here to scam us, take it elsewhere. How can you claim to be my father's teacher? His teacher is the famous painter Riley."

Eliana's expression didn't waver. "I am Riley."

Stan burst into laughter. "What a joke! If you're going to lie, at least make it believable. Leave now, or I'll call the police."

"Call them if you like," Eliana said flatly. She brushed past them and turned to the doctor. "How is he?"

The doctor hesitated."He is-"

"Doctor, don't waste your time with her!" Jonny cut him off sharply. He stepped forward, reaching for Eliana's arm. "She's an impostor. None of us know her. We'll have her removed immediately." Eliana slid aside before he could touch her.

"Get lost!" she snapped.

Jonny's face darkened with fury. "You're looking for trouble!"

Eliana met his glare head-on, her tone cool and unyielding. "I'm here to save Davin. As long as he's still breathing, I might be able to pull him back."

Jonny sneered, "Save my grandpa? Weren't you just claiming to be Riley, a great painter? What now? You've stopped painting and turned into a doctor? Can't you come up with a more believable lie?"

Eliana's glared at him. "Are you trying to stand in my way?"

Now she understood-this man was Davin's grandson.

If he would pose a problem, she wouldn't hesitate to knock him out and go in anyway.

Before she could move, Leyla's voice rang out. "I know her. She can't cure anyone. I've seen her deceive people before."

Jonny's disgust deepened instantly. "I knew it! Get out-now!"

Stan wasn't having it either. He barked at the doctor, "Call security and throw this liar out!"

"I am not a liar!" Eliana snapped, fixing her gaze on the doctor. "I have a medical license. Let me into the operating room. Every second wasted reduces his chances of survival. If anything goes wrong, I'll bear the responsibility."

"Well..." the doctor faltered. His eyes flicked between Eliana and the Gordons. But in the end, he chose to trust the patient's family. He couldn't possibly allow a totaI stranger into the operating room.

"Miss, if you keep interfering, I'll call security."

"I-" Eliana opened her mouth to argue, but heavy footsteps echoed down the corridor.

A familiar male voice rang out. "Let her in."

Everyone turned toward the sound.

They saw several figures approaching quickly, Tristan at the lead.

Everyone present was visibly startled.

"Mr. Pearson? Why are you here?" Stan hurried forward in surprise.

The doctor followed Stan, glancing at the elderly man walking beside Tristan. "Mr. Hewitt? You're here as well?"

It was Moran Hewitt, the director of the hospital himself.

After arriving at the hospital, Tristan had deliberately split from Eliana to find the director.

He knew hospitals ran under strict rules. No matter how skilled Eliana was, without official approval she would never be allowed into the operating room. That was why Tristan hadn't walked over with her.

"I'm here to save your old man," Tristan said simply, his face unreadable. His connection with Davin was mostly business. Normally, he wouldn't interfere this directly. But with Davin's life hanging by a thread, he had no choice but to step in.

At Tristan's words, Stan's eyes lit up. "Thank you, Mr. Pearson. You are so kind..."

Tristan's lips curved in a faint smile. "Don't thank me. Thank her."

He tilted his chin toward Eliana.

Stan followed his gaze, and when his eyes landed on Eliana, his face froze in shock. "She..."

"She's the renowned doctor from Eighvale," Tristan announced calmly.

Stan's eyes widened in disbelief. "What? She is-"

"That's right," Tristan cut him off, his tone edged with steel. "So-are you still going to stop her from saving your father?"

Stan's fists clenched at his sides. For several tense seconds, he hesitated. Then he drew in a deep breath and nodded. "I tust your judgment."

Leyla paled. She hurried forward to protest, but Tristan's cold, piercing gaze pinned her in pace.

"Dad..." Jonny tried again, his voice thick with disapproval. "We don't even know who this woman really is.How can we-"

"Shut up!" Stan barked, silencing him.

Tristan had vouched for Eliana, leaving Stan no room to argue. Even if she were a complete novice, he had to agree.

If anything went wrong, Tristan would bear the responsibility. They had nothing to lose.

Besides, Stan knew Tristan. He wasn't the type of man to gamble recklessly. If he vouched for Eliana, then he was certain she could save Davin.

"Have you decided?" Tristan asked, his tone edged with impatience. "Yes," Stan said quickly. "We'll trust you."

"Good." Tristan gave a curt nod, then turned to Moran. "Mr. Hewitt, thank you."

Moran waved a hand, his tone firm. "It's nothing, just doing my job. Having such a legendary doctor perform surgery here is an honor for our hospital."

He held out an official document, granting Eliana the title of Visiting Specialist at the hospital.

With this, she could step into the operating room freely, saving lives whenever she wished.

Armed with the director's endorsement letter, the attending doctor no longer dared to stop Eliana.Straightening respectfully, he gestured toward the operating room.

"Lead the way," Eliana said crisply.

Just before entering, she turned to Tristan and gave him a small nod.

Tristan's lips curved into a faint smile-steady, reassuring.

For reasons she couldn't name, it eased the tension in her chest.

Then, with a dull thud, the operating room doors swung shut, sealing her from view.

The Gordons thanked Tristan over and over before urging him to sit.

He accepted with a quiet grace, lowering himself onto the waiting bench.

Leyla's lips curved faintly. The sight of Eliana disappearing into surgery filled her with twisted relief.

She was certain Eliana couldn't possibly save Davin.

Her presence inside would only spell disaster. Davin was as good as dead. The thought settled her nerves.She decided to take her leave then.

The longer she lingered, the more likely Eliana would start questioning her presence. Better to leave before suspicion arose. It was the end for Davin anyway.

Leyla turned to go, moving quietly down the corridor. "Miss Murray, are you leaving?" Jonny's voice rang out behind her.

Her body stiffened. Slowly, she turned. Jonny's curious gaze was on her... but it was Tristan's icy stare beyond him that sent a chill stabbing straight through her chest.

Her heart lurched violently. She internally cursed Jonny for his meddling.
###Chapter 92 Leading The Surgery


"Ms. Murray, is everything alright?" Jonny noticed Leyla standing off to the side, unusually quiet, and approached herin a few quick steps.

Steeling herself against Tristan's cold stare, Leyla forced a thin, polite smile. "Sorry, something just came up at home.I really need to head out right now. Please let me know if you hear anything about Mr. Gordon, and I'll come straight back."

Wasting no time, Jonny, eager to keep in touch, took out his phone and exchanged numbers with her before she could disappear.

"Alright, I'll get going then," Leyla said, ready to make her escape now that their connection was secured.

Suddenly, just as Jonny started to step aside, Rocco and Doran moved in and blocked the doorway,standing shoulder to shoulder.

Eyebrows drawn together, Leyla eyed them warily. "What's this about? Why are you blocking my way?"

Unfazed, Doran gave a blunt answer."Leaving isn't an option right now."

Leyla's patience wore thin. "You can't just keep me here! That's not how this works."

Before she could raise her voice, Rocco softened the tension with a gentle tone."You've got it all wrong. We just need to clear up a few things-once that's done, you're free to leave."

With Doran playing the heavy and Rocco talking circles, Leyla found it impossible to let her irritation show."Whatever this is, can it wait? I have somewhere I absolutely need to be."

A hint of mischief played across Rocco's face. "So, what's so pressing? Maybe I can lend a hand."

Leyla kept her tone cool. "It's personal, really. Nothing I can't handle on my own."

Unmoved,Rocco continued, "Even so, I'll have to ask you to wait just a little longer. Whatever it is, it can't take priority over Mr. Gordon's condition. As his student, you have a responsibility to stay, don't you agree?" Words tangled on Leyla's tongue. "I mean, I...”

Suddenly, Tristan's authority cut throughthe tension. "That's enough. Rocco, you'll escort her. Make sure her urgent business is taken care of, then bring her right back."

"Understood!" Rocco replied without hesitation.

Of course,Leyla had no real emergency-she'd only been looking for a way out.

Nerves ghawed at her as she weighed her options. Bolting now would only raise more red flags. Choosing to play along, she sighed and gave in. "Alright, you win. Nothing is more important than Davin right now. My own stuff can wait."

Stepping back from the exit, she made it clear she wasn't going to argue anymore.

Doran finally let his arm drop, but his gaze never wavered, keeping a silent watch to make sure Leyla didn't try to bolt.

Rocco led Leyla aside, voice gentle yet probing. "Ms. Murray, we just want to get a clear picture. Can you walk us through exactly what led to Mr. Gordon's sudden collapse?"

Leyla had already explained the details to Davin's family, but she gathered herself and recounted everything once more. "I was standing near the entrance of the exhibition hall when Mr. Gordon spotted me and asked for a quick word. We went to a cafe close by and took a seat together."

Rocco asked, "What happened after that?"

She continued, "We hadn't talked for long before he started to complain about some pain in his chest.I immediately wanted him to see a doctor, but he just brushed it off and insisted it was nothing serious.Within a few minutes, his face lost all color, and he started breathing fast. By the time I tried to react, he had already collapsed. I ran out for help right away, and from there, he was rushed here. That's everything."

Jonny,standing nearby, joined in with a nod. "I've been living with him for years. He's mentioned chest pain recently, but he's too stubborn to let anyone take him to the hospital. He just chalks it up to old age. I actually made plans to take him for a check-up after the event today, but I never imagined things would turn out like this." Emotion tangled Jonny's words as he tried to speak.

In his family, he liked Davin the best.

Throughout his childhood, Jonny had spent nearly every day learning to paint and sharing a home with Davin, while his own parents were always somewhere far away, chasing careers.

A thoughtful glance passed between Rocco and Tristan. Tristan took a moment, then cut to the heart of things. "What about the bodyguards who were with your grandpa?"

"They went down to the main desk to handle the hospital paperwork," Jonny explained quietly.

Without a word, Tristan nodded at Rocco, who took the cue and slipped out to track down the missing bodyguards.

Inside, Leyla's nerves prickled, but she forced herself to appear calm. Only she and Davin knew the real story of what happened in that private room. If Davin didn't survive, she'd stay out of trouble. Without evidence,no accusation would stick. Innocent until proven guilty wasn't just a phrase; it was the rule.

Back in the operating theater, Eliana had stepped up, taking command as the lead surgeon, all eyes in the room turning to her.

Every gaze in the operating room gravitated toward her, watching her take charge.

Bright lights glared overhead, filling the room with heat, and soon sweat gathered along Eliana's brow.

A nurse wasted no time, stepping in tó dab the moisture away.

At first, skepticism hung in the air. None of the surgical team were pleased with Eliana's sudden promotion,least of all the former lead surgeon, who now found himself assisting a much younger doctor.

Normally,someone of Eliana's age would still be observing procedures or helping out on the sidelines.Instead, she now led the operation-backed by a direct order from the hospital's director.

That demotion stung, and the original lead surgeon could hardly believe the hospital would risk a patient's life for politics-at least, not until Eliana began to work.Precision guided every incision she made, each movement efficient and clean, leaving even the harshest critic without a single word to say.

Years of experience in cardiac surgery gave the former lead an eye for skill. Within minutes, he realized Eliana was operating at a level well beyond his own.

That revelation shifted his perspective entirely, and rather than resist, he welcomed the chance to stay by her side. For him, it became a rare opportunity to learn from someone truly exceptional.

In medicine, true professionals understood that real talent deserved respect. Genuine skill always won out,and losing a title to someone more gifted was no shame.

At this point, any doubts about Eliana's ability had vanished from the former lead surgeon's mind.

Minutes dragged on, tension building with each passing second.

No one in the operating room allowed their focus to waver for even a moment.

Nearly two and a half hours slipped by, the clock's slow hands tracking every nerve-wracking minute-until suddenly,alarms shattered the silence.

Panic flashed through the team. "This isn't good. He's still bleeding out, and his blood pressure just tanked..."



Sharp concentration replaced every trace of doubt on Eliana's face, but her fingers never trembled."Dowe have ECMO here?"

The former head surgeon quickly replied, "We do."

"Get VA-ECMO set up. Now," Eliana instructed without missing a beat.

One nurse hesitated, concern flickering in her voice. "We'llneed a green light from his family to proceed..."

A clear,urgent voice cut through the hesitation. "Skip the paperwork. I'll take responsibility and sign whatever's needed."

Relief washed over the nurse. "Understood." Wasting no time, Eliana scrawled her signature and turned to initiate ECMO.

This wasn't just any intervention-ECMO was top-tier technology for cases of critical heart or lung failure,exactly what Davin was facing now. However, the machine could drain a fortune in just hours.

Neither Eliana nor the Gordon family flinched at the expense.

Right now, nothing mattered more than saving Davin's life.

Still, every expert in the room understood the risks. ECMO wasn't just costly; it was a high-stakes procedure. One wrong move, and things could spiral even faster.

Blocking out every distraction, Elfana gave Davin her full attention.

All the while, a silent plea circled in her mind-she was willing to do anything for him to survive this ordeal.
###Chapter 93 Her Fascination Faded


The air outside the operating room grew heavier as the minutes dragged on, the Gordon family's anxiou faces reflecting the strain.

"How much longer is this going to take?" Stan's wife, Leonie Gordon, asked, her nerves tightening with eac passing minute.

Davin had always treated her with kindness, and she feared something had gone wrong.

Stan leaned back slightly, trying to sound steady. "Heart surgery takes time. It's not something that end quickly."

Jonny,however,offered no comfort. His words carried a sharp edge."If you ask me, this whole delay because that woman interfered. Without her meddling, things would've gone smoothly."

Doran cut him off with a voice as sharp as a blade, "Please watch your tongue. Loose words could cost yo far more than you're prepared to pay."

The grim set of Doran's jaw gave him the air of a merciless judge.

Jonny felt his throat tighten, swallowing hard as fear silenced him, though resentment still smoldered in hi chest.

Yes, Tristan wielded immense influence, but this was the Gordons' family affair. What right did he have t interfere? And why had he allowed an untrustworthy woman into the operating room? If Davin's life wa jeopardized, not even Tristan would escape unscathed.

Leyla, by contrast, seemed to ease more with every passing minute. The longer the surgery dragged on, th more serious it appeared.

She leaned toward Jonny with feigned composure. "Your grandpa is a nice man; he will be fine. You dor need to worry so much-he'll come through this." Her words struck a tender chord in him, warming the fear that clutched his chest. "Thank you for staying here with us."

"There's no need for gratitude," she replied earnestly, her gaze steady, as though reassuring herself as much as him. "The man inside isn't just your grandpa-he's my teacher too."

Just then, Rocco came back.

Two hours earlier, Tristan had sent him to question the two bodyguards who escorted Davin.

Their stories mostly matched what Leyla had claimed, though a few cracks showed in the details.

Suspicious,Rocco had gone to comb through the café himself, which cost him precious time.

Now,leaning close, he murmured a brief report into Tristan's ear.

Tristan's expression barely shifted, but a cold gleam slid toward Leyla like the edge of a blade.

A chill prickled across her back, and she quickly turned away, unwilling to meet that glacial stare.

Ever since that first encounter with Tristan at the Clarkes' estate, she couldn't help but feel drawn to him.
Handsome, wealthy-what woman wouldn't be intrigued?

But the more she interacted with him, the faster that shallow fascination faded.

Tristan carried himself with an icy detachment that made her uneasy, even frightened.

These days,just catching sight of him stirred the urge to shrink back into the shadows.

Unfortunately, in the narrow hallway, there was nowhere to slip away.

The sound of steady footsteps echoed closer, followed by Rocco's low voice.

"Miss Murray, I just finished questioning Mr. Gordon's two bodyguards. According to them, he never approached you at the exhibition hall's entrance. In fact, it was you who ran after their car, persuading him to follow you into the café."

Leyla's face drained of color, and the Gordons immediately shifted their gaze toward her, suspicion flickering in their eyes.

"Then tell me, why would you twist the truth, claiming he came looking for you when it was the other way around?" Rocco pressed, his tone sharp.

Before Leyla could form a reply, Jonny cut in defensively., what's the point of dragging this out?"

He didn't see the reason behind everyone aiming their questions at Leyla.

Rocco met Jonny's skeptical stare with a faintly amused smile. "I have my reasons for asking."

Doran, however, spoke with blunt authority. "Do you really not understand? We believe your grandpa's sudden collapse may be tied to her."

Jonny froze, stunned by the accusation, and blurted out, "No way-that's not possible! People don't just cause heart attacks!"

Before he could say more, Leyla tugged lightly at his sleeve and offered a strained smile. "I slipped up earlier, so it's only natural they'd be upset with me. You must know-whatever's wrong with your grandpa,I'm not the cause."

Jonny gave her a firm nod. "Of course I trust you."

Rocco, however, wouldn't relent. "Miss Murray, answer my question."

Fighting down her frustration, Leyla stepped forward, her voice sharp with defiance. "Yes, I lied!"

His brows lifted in cold curiosity. "And why would you do that?"

"Because..." Her gaze flickered downward as her cheeks burned. "I was ashamed! I begged him to forgive me,and how could I possibly bare something that personal in front of you? You know everything happened earlier today-you must already know why I needed his forgiveness. Now that you've heard the truth behind my lie, is that enough for you?"

Her expression was a swirl of anger and wounded pride, tinged with reluctant shame. The mix was so precise it almost looked rehearsed.
For a fleeting moment, Rocco wavered. But he quickly steadied himself. Extending his hand, he revealed a small pill resting in his palm. "Then tell me-have you seen this before?"

Leyla stiffened in surprise. That pill-she had hurled it out the window. How on earth had he retrieved it?

Still, she smoothed her expression, masking the jolt in her chest with practiced indifference."What pill? I've never laid eyes on that before," she said lightly, feigning ignorance.

Such a tiny thing couldn't possibly carry fingerprints. That thought steadied her, and her face remained calm,not a flicker of panic showing.

Rocco studied her for a long moment, but her composed mask gave away nothing. At last, he slipped the pill back into his pocket and retreated to stand at Tristan's side.

Tristan held back his words, his gaze sharp and cold.

The truth about Leyla's role in Davin's sudden heart attack would surface only when the old man woke,yet his instincts already painted her as guilty.③

The tension broke when the operatig room doors pushed open.

A doctor appeared, gripping a paper in one hand.

Instanly, everyone surged toward him.

"The patient's blood pressure has plunged to a critical low," the doctor said, his tone grim.in grave danger-someone must sign this emergency authorization right away..."

Leonie's lips drained of color, and she swayed so hard she nearly collapsed. Stan caught her quickly,steadying her before she could fall.

Having lost her parents so young, she had always relied on Davin, who treated her like his own child. That lifelong kindness burned in her memory, and now the bad news shattered her composure-tears streamed unchecked down her face.

Jonny's eyes brimmed red, though he forced them dry. Clutching the doctor's arm with trembling strength,he demanded,"Tell me-what role does the doctor who went in earlier play in this surgery?" The doctor said calmly, "Dr. Murray is serving as our lead surgeon now."

"Lead surgeon?" Jonny's eyelids jerked uncontrollably, his composure shattering. He lunged forward and seized the doctor's collar. "She's barely out of school! How much real experience could she possibly have?How could you let someone like her take charge of such a critical surgery? My grandpa's condition is life and death-are you telling me his condition is because of her mistake? Did she cause this?"
###Chapter 94 Scratch On Her Wrist


A prickling sense of dread crawled up Jonny's neck as soon as the last word left his lips.

Though he didn't dare turn around, he could feel it-the razor-sharp stare drilling into him from across the room.

Every instinct screamed that the glare came straight from Tristan.

That was when it hit Jonny-Eliana wasn't just anyone; she carried Tristan's endorsement.

Doubting her meant doubting Tristan himself.

Panic twisted in Jonny's gut, robbing him of his composure. No matter how worried he was about Davin,he couldn't forget the kind of power Tristan wielded. Nobody crossed Tristan lightly.

A cold sweat broke out along Jonny's hairline. While he struggled to come up with a way out, the doctor's voice cut through the tension, full of outrage. "What nonsense are you spouting?"

Tristan had been on the verge of rebuking Jonny for his thoughtlessness, but the interruption gave him pause.

Stepping forward, the doctor continued, "Dr. Murray is extremely skilled. Dr. Hardy chose her for chief surgeon on his own-and for good reason."

Shock rippled through the Gordons.

After all, Mercer Hardy's reputation as the best heart specialist at the hospital was what built the hospital's fame to begin with.

Frustration coloring his tone, the doctor didn't hold back. "If you'd seen Dr. Murray in that operating room,you'd know exactly what she's capable of. Dr. Hardy himself now assists her-it's that simple. Without her intervention, the patient would have left us hours ago. Try to show some respect. Dr. Murray was trying hard to save your grandpa." Jonny's jaw hung slack, disbelief painted across his face. Words completely deserted him. Recognition of Eliana's real talent had never crossed his mind, let alone the idea that she'd earned such swift respect from both Mercer Hardy and this outspoken doctor.

Impressing those two so quickly-especially when it meant riskig offense to the patient's family-said everything about her reputation.

Awareness dawned in Jonny's eyes, the sting of embarrassment mixing with genuine guilt.

This outcome was the last thing he'd expected.

Hoping to smooth things over, Stan stepped in. "Doctor, please accept our apologies. Jonny sometimes lets his nerves get the better of him, especially when family is involved. He meant no real offense.Please let Dr.Murray know that we see her as a savior. No matter how things turn out, our gratitude to her runs deep."

A faint, derisive sound escaped the doctor, who dismissed the confrontation with a single glance before disappearing through the operating room doors.

Every second counted inside as the surgical team fought desperately to keep Davin tethered to life. There was no space for petty arguments-only focus and skill.

Cameras captured every movement and decision in that room. If tragedy struck, the record would show Eliana had done everything humanly possible.

Once again, the thick doors swung shut, sealing away hope and fear together.

Unease rippled through the corridor. Stan and Leonie traded tense glances, each casting a silent rebuke at Jonny for his reckless behavior.How could he be so naive, wasting days with his canvases while forgetting the weight of a name like Tristan's? Anyone that man vouched for deserved respect, not doubt. But irritation aside, Jonny was still their own flesh and blood.

Clearing his throat, Stan crossed over to Tristan, his words careful. "Mr. Pearson, I apologize for my son's thoughtless remarks. He was acting out of worry, not disrespect. Please accept our regrets."

Tristan's expression didn't shift, his tone cool as glass. "You should count yourselves fortunate that Davin was Eliana's protégé. In any other case, Jonny wouldn't have gotten a word in-let alone a second chance." Stan's jaw slackened with shock. Eliana? Was he referring to that young female doctor? Was she really the mentor behind his father's progress? The idea that someone could bridge the worlds of art and medicine with such mastery felt almost unreal.

Nearby, realization finally dawned on Jonny. Tristan's words made it clear-if not for the bond between Eliana and Davin, she never would have agreed to help.

Gratitude should have been their first response, yet he'd managed only rudeness and suspicion. Regret flickered across his face, his feelings tangled between shame and disbelief.

A memory of the doctor's fierce loyalty to Eliana flashed through Tristan's mind. He pressed a palm to his forehead, unable to shake the sense that someone else always got to be the hero in Eliana's story.

At that moment, Rocco stepped in beside Tristan, lowering his voice. "Mr. Pearson, there's something you need to know about Leyla..."

"We'll talk once Davin comes around," said Tristan, his faith in Eliana unwavering.

Confidence radiated from him-he had no doubt Davin would pull through.

On the sidelines, Leyla watched Tristan's group for any sign of anger or blame. Their calmness gave her a sliver of comfort.

In her mind, the ordeal would be over the moment Davin breathed his last.

Regret crept in, sour and unexpected. Had she acted sooner and given Davin the medicine, the praise might have been hers instead of this awkward spotlight.

A moment later, Leyla pushed those thoughts aside.

All that mattered now was Eliana's suffering. If tragedy struck, Leyla was certain guilt would eat Eliana alive -and Leyla would savor every second.

Leyla's mind spun back to old grudges. If Eliana hadn't shown up at the exhibition hall with Carl, none of this chaos would have happened. The Clarke family's approval would already be hers.

The room thickened with unease as the minutes crawled by, each tick of the clock building the tension higher.

The double doors swung open at last, and Eliana stepped out, Mercer and the rest of the surgical team trailing behind her.

In an instant, the anxious crowd surged forward. Tristan stood, making his way to the front with urgent strides.

Stan wastedno time, his concern spilling out. "Dr. Murray, please-how's my father? Is he all right?"

The abrupt shift in the Gordon family's demeanor caught Eliana off guard. Their tone was suddenly respectful,even deferential-so different from before.

Shaking off her surprise, she answered steadily, "The operation wasn't easy. There were moments we nearly lost him, but we managed to pull him through. Everything went as well as we could have hoped. Still, waking up will be Davin's own fight now."

Relief flooded Stan and Leonie's faces. They glanced at one another, then started to bow deeply in gratitude.

"You saved his life, Dr. Murray," Stan said, his voice thick with emotion. "We owe you a debt that can never be repaid. If there's ever anything you need, we'll be there."

Eliana gently stopped them, her hand raised. "No need for such formality. Davin is my student. I simply did what any teacher should."

Jonny hovered,caught between wanting to apologize and desperate to thank her.

She turned away from him, addressing Stan once more, saying, "I can't promise when he'll wake. He's in the ICU now-visitors aren't allowed inside yet, but you can see him through the observation window."

"Dr. Murray, thank you-truly, thank you!" Stan's relief was unmistakable.

A small nod was Eliana's only response before she shifted her attention and strode straight toward Leyla.

Hearing that the operation had gone well, Leyla felt her confidence evaporate. Her legs nearly gave out beneath her. Instinct begged her to bolt, but pride anchored her in place as Eliana advanced.

Feigning poise, Leyla asked, "Did you want something from me?"

In a swift, unexpected motion, Eliana seized Leyla's wrist and pulled up her sleeve, exposing bare skin for all to see.

"What do you think you're doing? Let go!" Leyla exclaimed, yanking her hand, outrage in her eyes.

Unmoved, Eliana leaned in, her voice low and pointed. "Care to explain how you got this scratch on your wrist?"
###Chapter 95 You'd Better Not Be Lying


The moment the words left Eliana's mouth, every gaze slid to Leyla's wrist-including her own.

In all the chaos, she had totally forgotten about the scratch marks.

Now that Eliana mentioned it, her memory flickered back-Davin had scratched her during the struggle.

A flash of panic crossed her eyes before she quickly masked it with a look of wounded innocence.

"Mr. Gordon said his chest hurt, so I tried to help him. He scratched me by accident. Why even bring it up?"Leyla asked, feigning confusion.

Eliana's eyes darkened. Earlier, in the operating room, she'd checked whether Davin had swallowed her pill.

If he had, the surgery would've been smoother; the pill she'd developed was designed to protect the heart.

But during the examination, she noticed dried blood under his fingernails.

She checked for the pill, butit was missing.

That alone had stirred suspicion. And now, seeing the scratch on Leyla's wrist, Eliana was almost certain.

Still, she needed proof-Davin's own words-to corner Leyla completely.

Fixing her with a cool stare, Eliana said evenly, "You'd better not be lying."

Leyla's brows furrowed. "Why would I lie about this?"

Eliana didn't bother to reply her.

The truth would surface once Davin woke up.

She'd deliberately exaggerated earlier, just loud enough for Leyla to hear.

In reality, Davin had an eighty-percent chance of waking within the week. She stepped toward Tristan, meeting his gaze with a faint, weary smile. "Looks like I owe you another favor."

Tristan gave a light shrug. "Don't worry. You don't need to pay me back."

Eliana didn't say anything else.

Leyla, however, felt a feeling of unease settle in her chest at his words-only to quickly smother the thought.She hadn't forgotten that Tristan was engaged.

Just then, Jonny appeared at her side, concern etched on his face as he asked about the injury on her wrist.

Leyla shook her head lightly. "It's nothing, just a scratch."

Jonny frowned. "That's not nothing. If it gets infected, you'll regret it. Come on, I'll take you to get it treated."

Eager to leave the tense atmosphere, Leyla didn't resist and allowed him to guide her away.

Doran instinctively moved to block them, but Tristan's sharp look held him back.

Eliana hadn't objected, which meant she had her reasons. Tristan saw no point in interfering.

Besides, Jonny's blind devotion was pathetic, but harmless. Detaining him would only breed resentment.

Soon after, Stan and Leonie hurried over to thank Eliana and Tristan before rushing off to see Davin through the ICU viewing window. Visitors were not allowed in just yet.

Watching them go, Tristan chuckled under his breath. "Davin's grandson really can't see straight."

Eliana's lips curved faintly, dismissively. "He'll see through Leyla's true color soon. No sense in arguing about it now."

Tristan's tone turned thoughtful. "You're convinced she had something to do with this?"

Eliana shook her head. "I can't say for sure she provoked Davin and made him collapse. But the pill I gave him... it's gone. Davin wouldn't throw away even a scrap of paper I gave him. There's no way he'd discard that pill." Just then, Rocco rushed over and opened his palm. Resting there was a pill. "Ms. Murray-is this the one you gave him?"

Eliana's eyes widened. She snatched it up immediately. "Where did you find this?"

Rocco explained, "Mr. Pearson suspected Leyla, so I retraced her steps. At the café, I searched the private room and found this suck on the window ledge."

Rocco had seen Eliana hand the pill to Davin earlier, so he recognized it immediately and brought it back.

Eliana's eyes burned hotter with anger. "Leyla must have tossedit."

Tristan's brows knitted. "Want me to drag her back here?"

Eliana shook her head. "No need. Once Davin wakes, the truth will come out."

Tristan accepted that with a short nod, then turned to Doran. "Post two people by the ICU. Quietly. If anyone suspicious shows up, take them down immediately."

"Understood." Doran snapped to attention and left to carry out the order.

On Tristan's order, he ran through names of men he could trust for a job like this.

When he was gone, Eliana looked back at Tristan. "Thank you for today. I've been stretched thin lately. I may not be able to make the trip to Eighvale. If you can, bring your father to Qidence. It'll be easier for me to treat him here."

Tristan gave a small nod."Consider it done."

Elbert's condition wasn't critical, so there was no rush.

He glanced at her. "Where are you headed next?"

"Home. Carl texted-he's been waiting in the parking lot," Eliana said.

A flicker of disappointment crossed his features. She didn't need him to drive her.

Still, he smothered it wth calm patience. They had time. He could wait. "I'll walk you there," he offered.

Eliana opened her mouth to refuse. "No-"

Tristan cut her off smoothly. "Rocco's car is there too. We're heading in the same direction."

Eliana let the protest die on her lips.

As they walked, Tristan shifted the conversation. "The authorities picked up a few more members of the Fist Guild, but remnants are still out there-especially Kohen, their former leader. Be careful. His reputation is darker than Flint's, and people say he's even more skilled."

"I'll keep that in mind," Eliana said. "Thanks for the warning."

"I'll push for the rest of them to be caught soon," Tristan added.

Before she could respond, Carl and Jordy came running over.

"Lia, how's Davin?" Carl's voice cracked with urgency.

Eliana's tone softened, steady and reassuring. "The surgery's over. He's unconscious for now, but there shouldn't be any major problems."

Carl let out a long breath. Relief washed over his features. "That's great news. I wanted to check for myself but didn't want to make a mess of things, so I waited here. By the way-Mom called. She's wondering why we're still out. I gave her an excuse, but we'd better head back before she grows suspicious."

Eliana nodded in agreement. Then she turned, gave Tristan a brief nod of farewell, and slid into a car.

Halfway through the drive, Carl's phone rang again. He put it on speaker. Stella's voice, bright with excitement,filled the car. "Carl, get home quick-and bring Lia. Rowell's back."

Eliana blinked in surprise. Rowell? She remembered the name. Once a minor celebrity in the entertainment world-until Paula had all but smothered his career, unable to stand his rejection of her.
 ###Chapter 96 A Cross-Dresser


Carl seemed to read Eliana's thoughts, giving her a quick nod before speaking into the speaker.

"Got it,Mom.Lia and I are heading back now."

"Alright," Stella's voice crackled through the line, then the call ended.

In the brief silence that followed, Eliana's mind spun.

She had already met four of the six sons of Stella and Louise, each with such distinct personalities that it felt like meeting characters from different worlds. But Rowell remained a mystery.

Despite his excellent qualifications, he had been reduced to a nobody in the entertainment industry because of a woman. Would he be bitter like Damon, wearing his frustration like a cloak?

Rowell old than you?"she asked suddenly.

"Yes, but he's younger than Damon and Sawyer. He and Harold are twins," Carl replied without hesitation.

"Harold? You mean the one doing medical aid abroad?" she pressed further.

"Yes." Carl gave her a half-smile, though there was something wistful in his tone. "You don't remember?Back when we were kids, whenever we went out together, people couldn't take their eyes off them. They were so identical. They always took the spotlight after you."

Eliana chuckled. "Well, 1 honestly don't remember having twin brothers."

"That's because you were too young. Besides, Mom carries the twin gene. She even has a twin sister, but...well, her side of the family cut ties with us long ago."

Carl's voice dropped. He shot her a sly glance. "Which means, Lia... if you ever have kids, you might give birth to twins too."

Eliana shook her head instantly. "No, thank you. I don't want that many children." Her mother believed in large families-equating noise with happiness, children with prosperity. And in her pursuit of a daughter, Stella had ended up with far too many births.

But Eliana never shared that belief. Besides... she never wanted to get married, let alone start a family.

Seeing so many different kinds of people, she found being single cleaner, freer-better.

Carl, of course, saw things differently. "Having lots of children makes a family lively and warm-just like ours."

Eliana shot him a sideways glance, lips curling into a wry smile. "Easy for you to say. You men don't have to give birth. Of course, you think it's wonderful. Look at Mom-her body is frail now because she had too many children."

Her words made Carl pause. Slowly, he nodded, his expression sobering. "That's true."

The car grew quiet for a moment, the hum of the road filling the space. Then Carl broke it with a question that had been gnawing at him. "Lia, where did you learn your medical skills and painting? You... you seem to master everything effortlessly."

Eliana raised an eyebrow, turning the question back on him. "Where did you learn to paint?"

Carl narrowed his eyes. "Don't change the subject. I'm serious. Where did you learn all these things?"

Eliana's lips curved into a teasing smile. "From parallel universes. Can you believe that?"

Carl scoffed outright. "If you don't want to tell me, just admit it. Don't try to fool me with nonsense. I'm not that gullible. I'm actually pretty smart,you know."

Eliana chuckled softly but didn't explain further. She wasn't lying. She had indeed learned her skills from parallel uuniverses.

When she was fourteen, she had run away from her village to survive on her own.

That fateful night, with nowhere to go and a snowstorm raging, she had nearly frozen to death.

That was when the "System" had found her. Dragged into a parallel universe, she had been forced to complete bizarre tasks in exchange for her survival.

Every world demanded something new of her-medicine, art, strategy, performance. She had learned each skill under the harshest conditions, her life always hanging by a thread.

Task after task. World after world. A hundred universes. A hundred different lives. Until, finally, she returned.Alive.Changed.

She had gone through too much to waste her hard-earned abilities. That was why she founded the Onyx Syndicate, built from the countlessskills she had acquired.

But no one could ever believe her real story. So, she told a simpler one-that she had trained under many masters, each teaching her something different.

It wasn't a lie. In those parallel worlds, she had indeed apprenticed under countless teachers-men and women who had stood as the very pinnacles of their realms.

Soon,they reached home. Eliana pushed the thoughts aside.

Stepping into the living room, she half-expected to see a man as strikingly handsome as Carl or her other brothers.Instead, her eyes landed on a woman-a radiant beauty wwith golden, wavy hair, her arm linked with Stella's as they chatted warmly.

Could this be Rowell's girlfriend? Confused, Eliana scanned the room. No unfamiliar man. Only Damon and Sawyer were there, both wearing the same look of weary resignation as their eyes rested on the blonde.

"Lia,welcome home! Come here, darling." Stella spotted her at once, her smile widening as she waved her closer.

Eliana nodded politely and walked over with Carl at her side.

"Mom, who is this?" she asked, curiosity slipping into her tone.

Stella's smile softened. She glanced at the blonde beauty beside her, then shook her head with amusement."This is Rowell."

Eliana froze. Her eyes widened, and she blurted out, "Rowell??" "Hi, Lia!" the blonde replied cheerfully-only, the voice was unmistakably male.

Eliana's eyes widened even further. Rowell...a cross-dresser?

Seeing the shock written across her face, Rowell quickly abandoned the act. He tugged off the wig and stood up in haste, his smile apologetic. "Lia, don't misunderstand. It's not what you think. I just came back from a film set. I didn't even get the chance to remove the makeup."

Relief washed over Eliana. So this wasn't some strange hobby-it was work.

Carl chuckled,punching Rowell lightly on the chest. "Rowell, what the hell were you filming? I didn't even recognize you."

Rowell shrugged,though the motion seemed more bitter than casual. "It's work. One of the actresses for a minor role quit suddenly, and my agent shoved me into the part. It was smaIl anyway-I've already finished filming."

Eliana, however, didn't miss the flicker in his eyes. That smile might have looked careless, but the frustration hidden behind it was sharp.

No decent agent would force a male actor into such a role unless there was someone pulling strings.

Eliana was sure that it must be related to Paula.

Feigning innocence, she stepped forward and extended her hand. "Welcome home, Rowell."

Rowell wipedhis hand before taking hers, a faint smile tugging at his lips. "I should be the one saying that.Welcome home,Lia."

Then,as though suddenly remembering something, he reached into his backpack and pulled out a stack of glossy photographs. Each one bore the signature of a popular celebrity. "Young girls love stars these days.I didn't know who you liked, so after I heard you were coming back, I collected as many autographs as I could for you."

Eliana accepted the hefty bundle. The weight alone told her how much effort he had gone through.

Rowell wasn't doing well in the industry. For him to gather signatures from so many celebrities must be no easy task.

Eliana wasn't even a fan of celebrities.

But in that moment, these autographs became precious to her-not because of whose names were scrawled on them, but because of who had collected them.

"Thank you, Rowell. I love them," she said with a bright smile. Already, her mind was moving ahead, mapping the solution.

For most people, fixing his situation would have been close to impossible. But for her? It was just a small problem. One she could solve inthree days.
###Chapter 97 Damon's Worry


Eliana wasn't the type to meddle in other people's business. But for those who treated her sincerely, she would always return the favor.

Rowell was beaming. From the very first moment he met Eliana, he'd felt that inexplicable bond only siblings could share.

"As long as you like it," hesaid warmly.

Just then, Damon spoke up. "Lia, help me upstairs. There are things we need to talk about."

Eliana immediately thought of the time she'd introduced Damon to Seth. She still wasn't sure how that situation had resolved. "Perfect. I have something I need to talk to you about too," she said.

"I'll help Damon upstairs with you!" Rowell volunteered enthusiastically-only to have Carl catch him by the collar.

"In those heels? Please. You'll break your ankle and send all three of you tumbling down the stairs."

Rowell lifted his chin confidently. "Relax, I've been practicing in these heels for days-I'm solid. Watch this."

He strutted forward with surprising ease, as though he were born wearing them.

But Eliana's sharp eyes caught the faint bruises circling his ankles-the kind the kind that only came from past sprains and tumbles.

Her gaze flickered with a complicated mix of emotion.

Despite constant setbacks, Rowell wasn't like Damon, who had once sunk into despair. Instead, he remained endlessly optimistic.

"Rowell," she said gently, pushing back her thoughts. "Stay with Mom. Let Carl help me."

Carl puffed his chest in pride at being selected, while Rowell scoffed, rolling his eyes before obediently returning to Stella's side.

As soon as Rowell stepped out of earshot, his face changed-all cheer gone. "Mom," he whispered seriously, "I've been looking into Dad's case. He's innocent-got dragged in by someone else's scandal.That someone was just cannon fodder in a bigger power struggle. And in the end... Dad became the scapegoat of scapegoats. This time... we're in real trouble."

Stella's smile froze. She hadn't expected Rowell to uncover so much. She quickly grabbed his hand. "Rowell,leave this to me.I have my own way of handling your father's case. Don't trouble yourself."

"But Mom-"

"Do as I say," Stella cut him off in a clipped tone. "This isn't up for discussion."

Rowell was taken aback by her unusual sternness. He swallowed, then nodded reluctantly. "Alright."

"Now go upstairs and change back into something decent. Wearing that... it's strange." She sighed softly.She did want a daughter, but she already had one. Rowell was better off as a son.

Rowell grinned and went to change.

Meanwhile upstairs in Damon's room, the moment Elianna and Damon were alone, his expression sharpened. "Lia, that person you asked me to help-who is he exactly?" he asked in a low tone.

Eliana's gaze flickered. She kept her tone light. "Why are you suddenly asking?"

"Because while I was doing that task, I realized-that wasn't the work of just one man. He belongs to a group.And that group has a powerful background. I'm worried... you might be walking into danger."

Eliana's smile didn't waver. "Don't worry. He's an old friend. He wouldn't harm me."

Damon frowned. "Do you even know what organization he belongs to?"

Eliana hesitated...then slowly shook her head. "No."

Damon's face darkened. "And yet you say he's an old friend? Lia, people's hearts are the hardest to read.I don't want you getting hurt. Stop contacting him. I'm warning you-l sense danger." Eliana's gaze was calm, unwavering. "I can protect myself."

Seeing he couldn't change her mind, Damon let out a heavy sigh. "Do you know whose firewall they wanted me to crack?"

Eliana hadn't gotten the chance to ask Seth, so she simply followed Damon's lead. "Whose firewall is it?"

Damon's gaze hardened. "Tristan's."

Eliana's eyes widened in surprise. Tristan? Why would Seth target him?

"They wanted me to get in and erase a certain video file," Damon explained. "I don't know what's in it, but Tristan isn't someone you can afford to provoke. If he finds out you were involved, I'm afraid..."

His eyes brimmed with worry-not for himself, but for her.

Eliana, smiled, unbothered. "Damon, did you leave any traces after breaching the firewall?"

He shook his head. "No."

"Then there's nothing to worry about. With your skills, Tristan will never trace it back. He'll never know."

Damon frowned. "Nothing is one hundred percent certain. Better safe than sorry."

Just then, a knock sounded at the door.

Carl stepped in with two glasses of water. Noticing the tension in the room, he asked, "What's wrong?"

Damon quickly shook his head. "Nothing. I was just reminding Lia of a few things."

Carl didn't press. "Alright then. Mom wants us downstairs for dinner. Let me help you down."

"Okay."

Carl and Eliana supported Damon on both sides as they went downstairs.

Later that night, Damon summoned Carl to his room. His expression was grim. "Carl, stick close to Lia these next few days. Make sure she's safe." Carl frowned. "Is she in danger?"

Damon avoided mentioning Tristan. "Just a precaution. She made some... friends while she was away in the countryside. She's too trusting, too naive. I'm worried she might get misled."

Carl's lips twitched. Naive? If anything, Eliana had more lie experience than all of them put together.

But since he had promised her to keep her secrets, he only nodded."Leave it to me."

"Good. Also, check on Sean. The heat's cooled down. If he can come back, have him return. I'll feel more at ease knowing he's guarding Lia."

"Understood."

Elianna had her bath and changed into dark clothes.

Once the monitors confirmed the whole household was asleep, she slipped out quietly and made her way to the Onyx Syndicate's new base in Qidence.

In just one afternoon, the abandoned factory had been turned into a fortress-guards stationed everywhere.From the outside, it still looked like nothing more than a crumbling ruin.

The gates creaked open. The men greeted her in unison.

Eliana gave a brief nod and headed straight for Seth.

He was mid-conversation with his subordinates, but the moment she stepped inside, he quickly greeted her.

Eliana didn't reply. She pulled out a chair, sat down, and crossed her arms.

Her eyes lingered on him, sharp and unrelenting. Seth shifted uncomfortably under her stare.

"Why are youlooking at me like that? You're scaring me."
###Chapter 98 Tristan's Fury


Seth's arms were folded so tightly across his chest, he looked like he was holding himself together.

Eliana wasn't fooled by his rigid stance. "Drop the act." She leaned back against the desk, her gaze sharp."Out of everyone, you're the last person who'd ever be afraid of me. So why don't you quit pretending and tell me-why did you hack into Tristan's firewall?"

The color drained from his face. His lips parted but no sound came out. "Who told you that?" he finally asked,voice hoarse.

He'd made it clear-no one was to breathe a word of the incident to Eliana.

That wound was hers to carry, and he refused to let anyone tear it open again.

If it hadn't been for her, he wouldn't even be alive. Her stepfather's wrath would have beaten him straight into the grave. But she had stood up for him, shielding him like a sister would.

"Damon told me." Her gaze didn't waver. "If he hadn't, would you have kept it from me?"

Seth stiffened. He had never revealed to Damon whose firewall he wanted to breach. If Damon had found out, it wasn't because someone had told him-it was because he had uncovered it himself.

Which meant his skills weren't just advanced. They were terrifying.

He cleared his throat, a little too quickly. "I wasn't trying to keep anything from you, honestly. It's just... this came as a client's request." He hesitated, eyes flicking over her face before he added, softer, "But I've been hearing things. About you and Tristan getting closer. And I worried you'd let feelings get in the way-that you wouldn't take this order if you knew."

"You don't need to worry," she said calmly. "I know my priority when it comes to men and money."

He swallowed hard. "I believe you."

Her eyes narrowed. "Then tell me the truth. Who placed the order? And what was in the footage file they wanted gone?"

One lie had a way of birthing a hundred more. Seth understood that now-too late.

But once he'd set foot on this path, there was no turning back.

The truth felt like a blade waiting to fall, andall he could do was stall for time. The longer Eliana remained in the dark, the safer she was... or so he told himself.

Drawing in a steadying breath, Seth forced the name past his lips."Jared Owen."

The room went silent. Eliana visibly turned pale.

Jared's name hung in the air like poison. In the Onyx Syndicate, it had long been a taboo-a past no one dared bring up.

Eliana's jaw tightened. Of course Seth had wanted to keep it from her. Her fingers curled into fists, nails biting her palms, but her voice was ice-cold when she finally spoke.

"From now on, don't take any more orders from him. This is the last time." She decided not to press further about the firewall.

"Understood!" Seth answered quickly, straightening as though her tone jolted him to attention. Relief washed through him.

At least he'd had the sense to use Jared's name. Anyone else, and she would've kept digging.

Still... guilt pinched at him. Because invoking Jared also reopened the very wound Eliana had fought so hard to bury.

Once, Jared had been her everything-her lover, her future. Everyone had expected their wedding. Until he'd thrown her aside like an old coat, chasing ambition into another woman's arms.

Eliana's subordinates had sworn vengeance, eager to make Jared pay. But Eliana had stopped them.

After that, his name was scrubbed from their world, as though he'd never existed.

Now, under the flicker of workshop light, Eliana's mask of calm couldn't hide the storm in her eyes.Seth swallowed hard.He regretted mentioning Jared... but at the same time, he didn't. At least it ended her questioning.

Trying to steer her away from the shadows, he forced a smile. "I've got a surprise for you.Come with me."

Her gaze lingered on him for a heartbeat, then she blinked, pulling herself back from memories that threatened to consume her. With a faint nod, she followed.

The abandoned factory had four workshops in total.

They stepped into Workshop D. The air smelled faintly of dust and cement. At the center, a gaping pit stretched over seven feet deep, its edges jagged under the dim lights.

Eliana stopped short. "What is this?"

Seth grinned, pride lighting his face. "I thought our headquarters on the surface was too easy to spot. So, I had the men dig an underground space. Once the rooms are done, we'll disguise the top as a dye factory.Even if anyone snoops around, all they'll see is harmless industry."

Eliana's nodded approvingly. "That's a good idea. But keep the noise down. We don't want to draw attention."

"Got it. Leave it to me! In under a month, our underground headquarters will be ready," Seth said with conviction, his voice brimming with pride.

Eliana nodded again, patting him lightly on the shoulder. "You've all worked hard. Treat yourselves to a proper meal tonight-put it on my tab."

"Thanks!" Seth and the others cheered in unison.

A faint smile tugged at Eliana's lips before she glanced at the time.getting late. I should head back now.Keep me updated if anything comes up."

"Alright." Seth nodded respectfully.

After exchanging goodbyes, Eliana hang around-she left for her home. Under the starlit sky, the sprawling manor estate silent and grand.

As she had done every night, she moved quietly into Damon's room. She lit a faintly sweet-scented candle,switched on the lamp, and began tending to his legs with practiced care.

By the time she finished, it was already past two in the morning.

She changed into her pajamas and lay down on her bed, but sleep refused to come.

Seth's earlier words echoed in her mind-Jared. She had done her best to bury every memory of him.

But the thought of him reopened old wounds.

Jared, with his promises. He had said he would make her happy, that he would love her just as he always had-but he could not marry her. He had begged for her understanding.

Of course, she hadn't understood. How could she? She would never become the shameful shadow in another woman's marriage. And so, she had walked away, outwardly decisive, but bleeding within.

Eliana closed her eyes. A single hot tear slid down her cheek.

Just then, her phone vibrated beneath the pillow.

She stiffened. Who could be texting her at this hour?

Pulling it out, she saw Tristan's name flash across the screen. His text read, "Are you asleep?"

Her brows knitted. What was he thinking, reaching out to her at this time of night?

Before she could put the phone aside, another message appeared. "I need to talk to you. Come to my office tomorrow morning."

Eliana pressed her lips into a thin line. With deliberate calm, she powered off the phone, set it aside, and lit another candle, this one infused with sleep-inducing herbs. Slowly, at last, her body relaxed and drifted into slumber.

Meanwhile, on the other side of the city, Tristan's face was thunderous. The air in the room seemed to crackle with his fury, heavy enough to suffocate. Rocco and Doran stood stiffly before him, their heads lowered, neither daring to make the slightest sound.
Tristan's temper was infamous, but tonight, his rage was something else entirely. They had never seen him that furious.
Their firewall was breached. The surveillance footage they had worked so hard to recover had been destroyed.
One more night and the file would have been restored to high definition. But now...ruined.
The two men shifted uneasily under Tristan's icy glare. Shame pressed down on them like a weight.
They had always boasted their firewall was impenetrable, flawless-yet now, that illusion had shattered.
The failure was more than technical. It was personal.
The silence stretched, suffocating, until Tristan finally spoke-his voice low and measured. "Find out who wanted to destroy that file."
Rocco nodded quickly, almost stumbling over his words. "We'Il track them down. There aren't many hackers with skills this advanced-we'll narrow it down fast."
"Get out," Tristan cut in coldly.
"Yes, sir!" Both men bowed their heads and turned toward the door.
But before they could cross the threshold, Rocco's phone buzzed. He glanced at the screen-and his expression lit up with sudden relief. He rushed back inside.
Tristan's eyes narrowed, irritation flashing across his face. "What is it now?"
"Good news," Rocco said, breathless. "Our team managed to back up the footage. The file's safe-it's preserved on a flash drive."
For the first time that night, Tristan's expression shifted, the fury in his eyes cooling to a dangerous calm."At least someone on your team has some wit." Rocco seized the opening. "We'll keep investigating the breach. And I'll have the team start restoring the file again immediately."
Tristan leaned back, but his gaze remained razor sharp. "This time," he said quietly, "don't let me down.""Understood!" Rocco nodded with renewed vigor.
###Chapter 99 He Meant To End Her Life


Rocco didn't risk lingering. He slipped out in haste, pulling the door shut behind him to grant Tristan privacy.

Doran hurried after him, voice dropping to a tense whisper. "Do we have a backup?"

"Yeah," Rocco muttered, exhaling hard, the strain evident in his tone. "Lucky for us, that new kid in tech likes saving extra copies. Without him, we'd be finished."

Relief swept over Doran's face as he released a shaky breath. "Who could've guessed someone would actually break through our firewall? And worse-get away with it. If only we'd caught it sooner..."

Rocco's jaw tightened. "From here on out, whatever we're handling, security comes first. We can't leave weak spots like this again. This disaster happened because we got cocky. That ends now."

Doran scrunched his nose as he noted, "You're starting to sound just like Mr. Pearson."

Rocco shot him a hard glare. "Cut the chatter and focus. Get that video restored immediately before this turns into a bigger mess."

Doran only gave a careless shrug. "Restored or not, what's the point? He already believes the woman that night was Eliana Murray."

"It doesn't hurt to be cautious. What if he's wrong?"

Still looking unbothered, Doran responded,"Whether or not she's the woman in the video, his clearly taken an interest in her."

Rocco shook his head firmly. "That's a different matter. He has always been the kind of man who remembers even the smallest kindness and returns it tenfold. Without that woman, he might have been cast out of the Pearson family long ago. She's his true benefactor. And if she turns out not to be Miss Murray,then he'll find another way to repay her."

Doran finally conceded with a faint grunt, "Fair point..." Their conversation trailed off as the two men walkedaway.

Not long after, a slender figure slipped into view along the second-floor corridor.

Anaya had been waiting for what felt like forever, her legs nearly numb from crouching there while Doran and Rocco lingered in Tristan's room.

Yet when she imagined what could come next, she pulled herself together with renewed strength. Tonight,Tristan would finally belong to her!

She straightened her posture, a confident smile curving her lips as she swayed her hips toward his door.She lifted her hand and knocked lightly, anticipation tightening her chest.

Inside, Tristan had just stripped off his shirt, ready to shower. His broad, muscular frame gleamed faintly in the dim golden glow.

At the knock, he assumed it was Rocco returning with more updates. Without bothering to cover himself, his voice came low and casual. "Come in."

Anaya seized the moment,.pushing the door wide. Her eyes devoured the sight of his sculpted body-broad shoulders tapering into firm, defined abs, every muscle chiseled from years of disciplined training. His v-line dipped beneath his waistband, leaving no trace of softness anywhere.

The moment she took it in, her heart kicked into overdrive.

She had come intending to seduce him, but the moment her eyes landed on him, her own composure faltered.

Desire swept through her with startling force, the same feverish rush she imagined men felt when confronted with a temptress.

The sheer perfection of his physique alone was enough to set her skin burning-let alone the face above it,so devastatingly handsome it felt otherworldly.

Tristan,assuming the knock had been Rocco, hadn't even looked up at first.

Only when the silence dragged on did he finally lift his head. His gaze hardened at once. Standing in the doorway was Anaya in a clingy strap dress, her eyes glittering with bold desire as they raked over him.

His brows knit, and a cold shadow crossed his face. "What the hell are you doing here? Get out."

Anaya brushed off his coldness and moved closer, arms lifting to circle his waist.

Before she could even touch him, a sharp kick slammed into her stomach, launching her backward into the door with a bone-rattling crash.

"Ugh-" she gasped, clutching her ribs, terror flashing in her wide eyes.

Her strap dress clung loosely to her frame, leaving her vulnerable and exposed.

She had expected Tristan might at least waver at the sight, but instead, he struck with ruthless precision, as if showing a shred of compassion to a woman was beyond his nature.

"I..." Her trembling voice broke off.

"I'll say it one last time-get the fuck out. Stay another second, and tonight will be your end." His gaze burned with hostility, an icy, murderous aura radiating from him like a blade poised to strike.

Anaya shook with desperation, ignoring the sharp ache ripping through her stomach and back as she scrambled toward the exit.

But before her hand touched the doorframe, Tristan's deep voice cut across the room."Stop."

Her legs froze mid-stride, and a flicker of hope lit her tear-rimmed eyes. She was right! Men were all the same. None of them could resist a woman willing to throw herself into their arms, especially one who worked so hard to polish her looks and keep her figure flawless.

Turning back, she forced a sultry smile through the pain twisting her abdomen.

"Mr. Pearson..." Her tone dripped with sugary sweetness.

Yet her triumph lasted only a heartbeat. Tristan's voice followed, colder than steel. "Did you run into Eliana that day?" Anaya froze in disbelief.Had she really misread him this badly?

Tristan's voice dropped to a frigid edge. "Answer!"

Her gut tightened under the weight of his stare, fear slithering back over her skin.

She forced down a hard swallow. "Eliana? Who's that supposed to be?"

"A young lady," he said flatly.

The word struck her like a stone. In this place, aside from the middle-aged cook in her fifties, everyone was male.

There was no mistaking it-if she had crossed paths with Eliana, she would know exactly who Tristan meant.

His sharp eyes caught the brief flash of panic on her face.

"I... I might've seen some young lady," she admitted, her voice turning defensive. "But so what? Why does that matter to you?"

Tristan's dark gaze pierced through her, his lips curling into a smile that carried no warmth. "Did you tell her you were my girlfriend?"

Anaya's stomach dropped, panic clawing at her chest, though instinct pushed her head into a frantic shake."No, that's not true. I never told her a thing."

A low, mirthless chuckle escaped Tristan, cold enough to freeze the air between them.

He closed the distance with deliberate steps, his presence radiating raw menace. "So that's it. That's why she thought I was already taken. You planted that idea...

Shaking her head frantically, she replied, "No, I didn't..."

Before the words could leave her mouth, Tristan's hand clamped around her throat.

Air vanished instantly. Despair crashed over her as she clawed at his grip, her lungs burning with the suffocating pressure. Tristan's voice rang in her ears, razor-edged and merciless. "Do you understand she's the one l claimed the moment I laid eyes on her? She's destined to be my wife. And you made her believe I'm nothing but a fickle man who can't keep to one woman. Now tell me, how do you think I should repay you for that?"

The deliberate weight he put on the word "repay" sent Anaya's stomach dropping, terror clawing up her throat.

"I'm sorry..." Anaya rasped, her voice a broken whisper forced through his tightening hold, too frightened now to offer a single excuse.

"Sorry?" His eyes glinted with frost as his hand constricted around her neck. "What good is sorry to me?"

A strangled cry tore from her lips as air fled her lungs. Panic surged, her body thrashing against his grip, but his strength was unyielding.

For the first time, she felt it-Tristan's intention was real. He meant to end her life.

Regret clawed at her chest. If she had known how much Eliana meant to him, she would never have dared to speak so recklessly, no matter how arrogant she felt at the time.

She had truly believed Eliana was just another woman like her, scheming for a chance to slip into Tristan's bed.

But reality cut with the bite of jagged ice. Eliana wasn't chasing after him at all-he was the one chasing her.She was the girl he valued, the one he had chosen.

And now... any chance Anaya had was gone. All that remained was the bitter weight of regret.
###Chapter 100 Seeds Of Mistrust

Each breath became harder for Anaya to draw, her face darkening to a dangerous shade.

It felt as if Tristan would crush the life from her, but before that became reality, two shadows rushed inand tore him away.

Air came flooding back-Anaya gasped, desperate for oxygen, chest heaving like someone who'd just surfaced from drowning.

The sharp sting in her lungs reminded her she'd never truly valued every breath until now.

On the other side of the struggle, Rocco and Doran clung to Tristan, straining against his raw power.

Tristan's fury bordered on uncontrollable, forcing both men to use every ounce of strength just to keep him back.

"Sir, please-this isn't the way," Rocco persuaded, voice tense. "If you end up killing her, how do we ever explain that to Hector?"

A dangerous chill flickered in Tristan's gaze. "Hector? Since when do I owe him any explanation?"

Rocco tried to reason further, holding firm. "I know, but think it through-"

"Release me," Tristan snapped, his patience gone.

Uncertainty made Rocco hesitate, but he held his ground."Sirwe-"

Tristan exhaled sharply, the fight draining from his shoulders.sover. I'm done. I won't kill her."

For a split second, he'd been ready to end Anaya then and there-not only for planting doubts in Eliana's mind, but because he had no patience for schemers who thrived on chaos.

Once before, it was another scheme that forced Elbert's hand-he'd sent Tristan off to Qidence.

Now, Anaya's antics touched a nerve Tristanrarely let anyone see. Even so, he never allowed rage to cloud his judgment. Everything he'd just done was calculated-just enough to remind Anaya where she stood.
A silent exchange passed between Doran and Rocco, and at last, they loosened their grip on Tristan.
True to his word, Tristan stepped back, making no move to harm Anaya further.
No sooner had he let go than Anaya hurried to his side, gratitude spilling from her lips. "Thank you for your mercy.I swear,you'll never have trouble from me again."
A cold laugh escaped Tristan, eyes glittering with disdain. "Taking your life wouldn't be worth the trouble.Doran, make sure she returns to, Clarkes' estate in style-she's earned a mountain of gifts for her week in my company. Let's show our appreciation."
Surprise flickered across Doran's face. How could Tristan's mood flip from lethal to lavish in a heartbeat?
Rocco,on the other hand, caught on instantly-he knew Tristan well enough to recognize the strategy.
"Allow me, sir," Rocco suggested smoothly, already making plans to carry out the order.

Tristan didn't waste another word-he simply turned and disappeared into his suite.

In a daze, Anaya barely had time to process what happened before she was whisked away, dressed in new clothes and seated in the back of a sleek car.
Rocco supervised as boxes of extravagant gifts piled into the trunk, turning the trip into something resembling a royal procession.
Confusion warred with pleasure inside Anaya. Since when did Tristan show generosity, and why direct it at her?
Only when she arrived at the Clarke estate did the reason begin to take shape.

Hector stood waiting, eyes hardening as he surveyed the bounty of gifts and the smug smile on Anaya's face."Explain yourself.Why would Tristan send you back like this?"

Anaya stammered, "I have no idea. He's impossible to read-I can never guess what's on his mind." A bitter laugh escaped Hector before he stepped closer, gripping her chin in his hand. "You really don't get it? Here's the truth-Tristan wants you here to keep tabs on me. You're supposed to run back and spill every secret.Isn't that it?"
Anaya recoiled,genuine shock widening her eyes.that's not what this is about!"
A cold smirk twisted across his face. "Not true? Since when did Tristan develop a charitable streak? Drop the act. I've seen women like you before-always gravitating toward power. Don't waste your time plotting.Whatever you're up to, it won't work on me."
Ice settled in Anaya's chest. "That's not fair! I haven't done anything. Tristan never asked me to spy,and I would never betray your trust...
With a flick of his hand, Hector shoved her away, distaste clear in every movement. "Get her out of my sight.If she won't come clean, there's no reason to keep her around."
"Understood!" His guards wasted no time, grabbing hold of Anaya.
Panic rising, she pleaded desperately, "Please, you have to believe me! I'm loyal-I would never cross you!"
"Enough. Take her away," Hector snapped,turning his back.
Dragged down the hall, Anaya finally understood the truth behind Tristan's generous farewNell.
The gifts weren't kindness at all-they were part of his plan to paint her as a traitor and set Hector against her.
She'd tried to poison Eliana's relationship with Tristan, only for him to repay her in kind-turning her into a wedge between herself and Hector.
Seeds of mistrust were all Tristan needed to scatter. Hector's suspicious nature did the rest. Doubt once planted would take root and spread-Hector would never look at her the same way again.
So much for kindness; this was retribution, pure and simple.
After the chaos faded and Anaya was dragged away, a tense silence settled over the room. Peace brought Hector no comfort-restlessness gnawed at him even more. For years, Anaya had been nothing but a pawn, usefulfor luring and intimidating the influential. Now, he was forced to destroy his own chess piece.

A sudden commotion broke his thoughts. One of his men hurried in, voice low but urgent. "Mr. Clarke,Ms.Murray has arrived and wishes to see you."

For a split second, hope flickered in Hector's eyes. He leaned forward, anticipation sharpening his tone."Who are we talking about?"

"It's Leyla Murray, sir," the man answered.

Disappointment hit hard-Hector's mood turned icy in an instant. "Send her away. I don't want to see her."

The messenger hesitated, uncertain, but finally delivered Leyla's stubborn response. "She says she's not leaving, no matter what you decide."

A bitter smile played on Hector's lips. "Then let her wait. If she's that determined, let's see how long she lasts."

Exits lined every corridor of the estate, and Hector found it mildly amusing-if Leyla managed to corner him,she would deserve some recognition.

Memories of the humiliation she caused him at the exhibition hall flashed across his mind, souring whatever warmth he once felt for her.

There was a time when Leyla stood out-beautiful, refined, the pride of the Murray family.

Now, all he saw was a liability-someone whose presence brought nothing but shame and inconvenience.



As the sun dipped below the horizon, a chill crept into the air.

Autumn's approach sharpened the wind, each gust slicing through the darkness.

Hours slipped by as Leyla stood rooted at the gates, her body aching, legs numb from standing so long. Not a single servant appeared to offer her entry. Stubbornness anchored her in place. Pride refused to let her walk away.

Surely Hector hadn't erased every feeling for her-not yet.

If she could just look him in the eye, she'd explain what really happened, undo the damage.

But dawn arrived, painting the sky gray. The gates never moved. The house behind them remained silent and closed.

Leyla shivered in the predawn chill, rubbing her numb fingers together in a futile attempt to ward off the cold.

Hope flickered when a servant finally appeared at the gates-but it died the moment she heard the news.

News of Hector's departure hit Leyla like a slap. "He's gone?" Disbelief colored her voice.

"Yes, you should be on your way as well," the servant replied, his words clipped and final before he vanished inside.

A surge of anger threatened to spill over, but Leyla kept her composure, refusing to give the staff the satisfaction.

Deep down, she convinced herself this was just a temporary setback. Hector's temper would cool eventually-he always forgave her in the end.

Clinging to that hope, she trudged across town, determined to take refuge in the apartment Hector had once arranged for her.

Frustration mounted as she jabbed the keypad repeatedly, each failed attempt greeted by an unforgiving beep.

Puzzled, she rang the housekeeper-only tohear that she was gone and the place was already up for sale.

Shock left Leyla reeling. The home she once shared with Hector had been stripped away, just like that.

With her accounts empty and every asset sold to cover mounting debts, Leyla found herself forced to check into a bland hotel. Just as despair began to settle in, her phone vibrated-a voice message from Jonny, gentle and sincere.

He wanted to know if her injured wrist was feeling any better.

Leyla's lips curled into a faint smile. An idea began to take shape.
